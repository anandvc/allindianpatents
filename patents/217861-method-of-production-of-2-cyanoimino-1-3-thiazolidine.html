				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for industrially producing 2-cyanoimino-l,3-thiazolidine useful as an intermediate material of Pharmaceuticals or agrothemicals. More specifically, it relates to a method for producing a high purity 2-cyanoimino-l,3-thiazolidine using a high purity, stable intermediate N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester, which is.obtained from an alkali metal cyanide compound, an alkali metal hydroxide, a lower alcohol, chlorine and cyanamide. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Several methods have been known for the production of an N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester. For example, 1) European Patent Publication EP14,064 (A2) (1980), Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-186412 (1993), and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-186413 (1993) propose a method for obtaining N-cyanocarbonimidic acid methyl ester from sodium hydroxide and methanol and gaseous state or liquid state chlorocyan/cyanogen chloride and cyanamide. This reaction is believed to be expressed by the following formula:<br>
OCH3<br>
Cl-CN+NaOH-f2CH3OH   —&gt;   HN=C	+NaCl+H20<br>
OCH,<br>
OCH3	OCH3<br>
^<br>
+NH2CN + HC1   - &gt;    NC-N=C	+NH<cl></cl>
OCH3	OCH3<br>
Further, 2) German Patent Publication DE3,225,249 |A1) (1983) proposes a method for obtaining N-<br><br>
cyanocarbonimidic acid methyl ester from sodium cyaniae, sodium hydroxide, methanol, chlorine and cyanamide as shown in the following formula:<br>
OCH3<br>
-^     /<br>
NaCN+N,aOH+Cl2+2CH3OH 	&gt; HN=C      + 2NaCl+H20<br>

HN=C      + NH2CN+HC1 	&gt; NC-N=C      +NH<c1></c1>
OCH3	OCH3<br>
On the other hand, 3) as a method for producing 2-cyanoimino-1,3-thiazolidine, the method of using N-cyanocarbonimidodithioic acid ester is described in Arch, Pharm. (Weiheim, Ger.), 305 (10), P731 (1972), Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 48-91064, Gazz. Chim. Ital., 110 (506), P345, WO 92-17462 (1992), etc. This reaction is'believed to be expressed by the following formula:<br>
SCH3<br>
NC-N=C      +H2N   SH 	&gt; NC-N-<t i></t>
SCH3	N<br>
Further, 4) as a method using similar starting naterials, there is the disclosure in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 60-28969 (1985). This reaction is believed to be expressed by the following formula:<br>
K<br>
NC-N=C        +Br   HH2 	&gt;<br>
SCH,<br>
NC-NK   I +CH3SH+KBr N<br><br>
Further, 5) regarding the method of using an N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester, J. Heterocycl. Chem,, 24 (1), P275 (1987) describes a method of using a diphenyl ester. This reaction formula is as follows:-<br>

SH    —^   NC-NK	+ 2C,H5OH<br>
x      '        b  D<br>

Further, 6) the method of using N-cyahocarbonimidic acid methyl ester is described in Org. Prep. Proced. Int., 26 (6), P721 (1991), German Patent DE4427539 (Al) (1996), and European Patent EP695744 (Al) (1996). This reaction formula is as follows:<br>
/OCHi   _^  A<br>
NC-N=C	+H2N        SH   	&gt;    NC-N=<t j></t>
OCH3	N<br>
However, in the first proposal of using<br>
chlorocyan/cyanogen chloride, it is necessary to handle strongly poisonous chlorocyan/cyanogen chloride starting material as a gas. Special care have to be taken over the material and air-tightness of the system and the treatment facilities for the exhaust, drainage, etc., and therefore the use of this method on an industrial scale was difficult.<br>
Further, also in the second proposal, a stable yield of the formed N-cyanocarbonimidic acid methyl ester could not be expected. Depending on the situation, the yield sometimes extremely decreased. Quality-wise as well, not only the purity is low, but also the stability becomes poor, and furthermore the hygroscopicity is strong and long term storage is not possible, and therefore it is difficult and uneconomical to use this method on an industrial scale.<br>
Further, many N-cyanocarbonimidic acid esters are<br><br>
high in solubility in organic solvents. Accordingly, when concentrating and precipitating a solution containing the same to obtain crystals, the stability is poor and, therefore, the loss in the concentration stage is large and the yield becomes poor. Further, since due to the properties thereof, many esters easily hydrolyze, care is required in the temperature at the time of extraction or separation of liquid. Thus there has been a demand for simply separating and drying the products so as to obtain stable products.<br>
Further, in particular, when methylene chloride is used among the organic solvents, since the boiling point of the methylene chloride is low, there are the problems that the yield is usually only about 50% and the cost of the starting materials becomes high. To raise the yield, special equipment such as a coolant recirculating system becomes necessary and therefore new capital investment is required.<br>
On the other hand, in the third and fourth proposals using another compound, that is, N-<br>
cyanocarbonimidodithioic acid ester, as the starting material for the 2-cyanoimino-l,3-thiazolidine, the toxicity or inflammability or odor of the gaseous methyl mercaptan dissociating at the time of the reaction becomes a problem. Further, in the preparation of the compound, there is the problem that carbon disulfide having an extremely high inflammability or toxicity has to be used.<br>
In the case of an N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester, there are the effects that, since phenol or alcohol is produced as a byproduct, it is easily to recover and recycle and simultaneously the problem of toxicity or odor is eliminated. In the fifth proposal, the diphenoxy compound used is high in the price thereof and difficult to acquire. In the sixth proposal, the purity of the formed 2-cyanoimino-l,3-thiazolidine is low and regardless of the method of production, inherently<br><br>
requiring careful control, the settings of the conditions were insufficient and an industrially stable supply of products was difficult.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to solve the above problems in the prior art and to develop a method for safely industrially producing, inexpensive N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester and 2-cyanoimino- 1,3-thiazolidine.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing an N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester and 2-cyanoimino-l,3-thiazolidine, as a high quality crystal, with a good yield and high purity.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it is possible to produce a high purity, stable N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester by reacting an alkali metal cyanide compound, an alkali metal hydroxide, a lower alcohol and chlorine in an aqueous solution to form an carbonimidic acid ester solution, then adding an organic solvent thereto, followed by adding a cyanamide solution to form an N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester, and further extracting the resultant ester with an organic solvent extracting solution, followed by washing with an aqueous solution of a reducing agent.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it is possible to produce high purity 2-cyanoimino-l, 3-thiazolidine by reacting the high purity, stable N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester obtained in the above method with 2-aminoethanethiol to be cyclized, in particular, without complicated purification. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a graph showing the relationship between the purity and the melting point of N-cyanocarbonimidic acid methyl ester.<br>
MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail below.<br><br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to produce the intended 2-cyanoimino-l,3-thiazolidine easily and safely, with the use of an alkali metal cyanide compound, an alkali metal hydroxide, a lower alcohol, chlorine and cyanamide to react with 2~ aminoethanethiol through an intermediate N-cyanocarboniinidic acid ester.<br>
The first reaction of the present invention is considered to progress by the following formula:<br>

OCH,<br>

In the present invention, first, the alkali metal cyanide compound, alkali metal hydroxide, and lower alcohol are dissolved in water, then chlorine gas is blown thereto to react and produce an carbonimidic acid ester solution. In this reaction, the alkali metal hydroxide should be added in an amount of preferably 0.5 to 3 equivalents, more preferably 1.0 to 1.2 equivalents, to one mole of the alkali metal cyanide compound. Further, in this reaction, a lower alcohol should be added in an amount of preferably about 2.0 to 5.0 equivalents, more preferably 2.8 to 3.2 equivalents, to one mole of the alkali metal cyanide compound. Further, in this reaction, chlorine should be added in an amount of preferably about 0.5 'to 1.5 equivalents, more preferably 0.8 to 1.2 equivalents, to one mole of an alkali metal cyanide compound. When the chlorine is insufficient, the yield is decreased. Even when an excess amount of the chlorine is used, the intermediate tends to break down and become a dialkyl carbonic acid ester and the yield tends to decrease.<br><br>
Specific examples of the alkali metal cyan compound are sodium cyanate, potassium cyanate, etc., but, from the viewpoint of economy and reactivity, the use of sodium cyanide is preferable.<br>
Specific examples of the alkali metal hydroxide are sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc., but, from the viewpoint of economy and reactivity, the use of sodium hydroxide is preferable.<br>
Specific examples of the lower alcohol are methanol, ethanol, normal propanol, isopropanol, etc., but the use of methanol is preferable from the viewpoint of economy and reactivity.<br>
The temperature of this reaction may be suitably selected from the viewpoint of the suppression of decomposition of the starting materials or imide carbonate ester formed and secondary reactions, but -5°C to 10°C is most preferable. The reaction time is not particularly limited, but is preferably 5 to 20 hours, more preferably 6 to 10 hours.<br>
In the present invention, an organic solvent is added to the carbonimidic acid ester solution, then cyanamide is added in an amount of preferably about 0.2 to 1.0 mole, more preferably 0.7 to 0.8 mole, to one mole of the alkali metal cyanide compound so as to produce an carbonimidic acid ester solution. At this time, an acid is preferably used to control the pH to 6.7 to 7.0.<br>
The cyanamide used in this reaction can be added as a crystal or solution. The solvent, when it is used as a solution, is not particularly limited if the solvent can dissolve the starting materials and does not react with the reaction starting materials and reaction intermediates, but water is preferably used in view of its low price and high safety. At that time, the concentration of cyanamide is preferably about 5 to 100% by weight, more preferably 10 to 60% by weight.<br>
The reaction temperature of the reaction is not particularly limited, but the reaction can be preferably<br><br>
performed at 30°C, or less but 10 to 25°C is most preferable from the viewpoint of the reaction speed, the suppression of the decomposition of the starting materials or N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester formed, etc. The time of addition of the cyanamide is not particularly limited, but preferably is 1 to 10 minutes, more preferably 2 to 5 minutes. Further, as the aging time, the reaction should be completed in 1 to 5 hours and more preferably 2 to 3 hours.<br>
Specific examples of the acid for the control of the pH are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, etc., but it is preferable to use hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid from the viewpoint of economy.<br>
After the reaction is completed, the oil layer is separated and is extracted one to five times using an equal weight or two times the weight of the organic solvent based upon the reaction solution.<br>
Specific examples of the organic solvent for the extract of the N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester are methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, toluene, xylene, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, etc. From the viewpoint of stability considering the temperature at the time of recovery or the economy considering the facility for concentration and from the extraction efficiency, the use of chloroform is preferable. The extraction temperature is not particularly limited, but it is possible to carry out the extraction at a temperature of 25 °C or less, and 0 to 15°C is most preferable from the viewpoint of the extraction speed, the suppression of the decomposition of the starting materials or the formed N-cyanimide carbonate ester or secondary reactions, etc. The extraction time is not particularly limited, but preferably is 30 minutes to 2 hours, more preferably 30 iiinutes to 1 hour.<br>
In the present invention, the extracted N-cyanimide<br><br>
carbonate ester is then washed with an aqueous solution of a reducing agent and dehydrated. Due to this treatment, not only is it possible to ensure the stability of the N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester in the manufacturing process, but also it is possible to obtain a stable, high purity final product.<br>
Specific examples of the reducing agent for the washing are sodium hydrogensulfite, sodium sulfite, sodium thiosulfate, etc., but from the viewpoint of the economy considering the stability in an aqueous solution or reducing ability, sodium hydrogensulfite or sodium sulfite is desirable.<br>
Further, the concentration and amount of the use of the aqueous solution of the reducing agent for the washing is not particularly limited, but the concentration of the aqueous solution of 1 to 50% by weight and the use of 1/20 to 1/2 of the weight of the extract are preferable, but from the viewpoint of the volumetric efficiency, the suppression of the load on the treatment of the wastewater, etc., the washing is most preferably carried out at a concentration of the aqueous solution of 2 to 10% by weight and using 1/10 to 1/5 of the weight, of the extract.<br>
The temperature of this washing is not particularly limited, but the washing is preferably suitably performed at a temperature of not more than 25°C. From the viewpoint of the suppression of the decomposition of the materials or produced N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester and secondary reactions etc., 0 to 15°C is most preferable. The extraction time is not particularly limited, but is preferably 30 minutes to 2 hours, more preferably 40 minutes to 1 hour.<br>
On the other hand, Specific examples of the desiccant for the dehydration treatment are sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride, a molecular sieve, etc., but from the viewpoint of economy considering the efficiency of dehydration or solubility<br><br>
in the extract, the use of a molecular sieve is desirable. In particular, it is possible to use Molecular Sieve (3A)'.<br>
These extracts are concentrated in vacuo. After concentrated, the concentrate is gradually cooled to a temperature of, for example, 5°C or less to precipitate a crystal of N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester. The slurry is separated. The yield of the crystal thus obtained is usually at least 60% (based on alkali metal cyanide compound). The purity is at least 99% (purity measured by HPLC method). Further, the rate of production, including the filtrate, is at usually at least 90% (based on alkali metal cyanide compound).<br>
The temperature for the concentration is not particularly limited, but the concentration may be suitably carried out at 50°C or less. The use of a temperature of 35 to 45°C is most preferable from the viewpoint of the extraction speed, suppression of the decomposition of the starting materials or the formed N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester and secondary reactions, etc. The concentration time is not particularly limited, but preferably is 30 minutes to 10 hours, more preferably 4 hours to 7 hours.<br>
Further, the filtrate after separation can be recycled as it is for the extraction of the next reaction.<br>
It is essential that the above crystal is dried by completely removing the organic solvent at the same time as the drying using a box type drier, fluidized drier, flash drier, or other known drier, in particular when used for the next reaction. In particular, when used as a material for the below-mentioned 2-cyanoimino-l,3-thiazolidine, even if remaining in an amount on the order of several percent, sometimes no product is obtained at all.<br>
The drying conditions differ depending on the drier, but when using a box type drier, from the viewpoint of<br><br>
the dehydration speed and prevention of decomposition of the N-cya.nocarbonimidic acid ester anhydride, the solution is preferably dried at a drying temperature of 10 to 80°C, more preferably 30 to 50°C, for preferably a drying time of 30 minutes to 10 hours, more preferably 1 to 8 hours.<br>
The second reaction of the present invention is believed to proceed as in the following formula:<br>

OCH3	N<br>
In the present invention, a 2-aminoethanethiol mineral acid salt is added to an alkali aqueous solution to react with the N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester formed from the above reaction.<br>
As the 2-aminoethanethiol salt, a hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, carbonate, acetate, etc. may be used, but from the reactivity, the use of a mineral acid salt is preferable. A hydrochloride is more preferable from the viewpoint of the solubility, economy, etc.<br>
Further, as the alkali used for the neutralization, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc. may be used, but sodium hydroxide is preferable from the viewpoint of economy and reactivity.<br>
The preferable addition amount of alkali to the 2-aminoethanethiol salt is 1.9 to 2.1 equivalents per mole of the 2-aminoethanethiol salt, more preferably 1.95 to 2.05 equivalents.<br>
Further, instead of a 2-aminoethanethiol, it is possible to use the free compound for the reaction. In this case, it is also possible to use the same, in the form of a solution. The preferable amount of alkali added to the 2-aminoethanethiol is 0.9 to 1.1 equivalents per mole of the 2-aminoethanethiol salt, more preferably 0.95 to 1.05 equivalents.<br><br>
The 2-aminoethanethiol solution used was obtained by using the same solvent as the reaction solvent or a solvent miscible with the reaction solvent and adjusted to a concentration of 20 to 30% by weight.<br>
The reaction temperature, when adding an N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester, is preferably 20°C or less from the viewpoint of prevention of decomposition of the N-cyanocarbonimidic acid ester solution. If considering the reaction speed, 0°C to 10°C is further preferred. The preferable reaction time is 20 minutes to 3 hours. In the present invention, the pH of the above reaction solution is adjusted with an acid, then heated to carry out a desired cyclization reaction to obtain a crystal of the intended 2-cyanoimino-l,3-thiazolidine. This cyclization reaction is preferably carried out at a pH of 10 to 11, more preferably a pH of 10.2 to 10.6. The acid usable for the adjustment of pH is not particularly limited, but mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid may be exemplified. The use of various types of solvents is also possible, but the use of hydrochloric acid is preferable from the viewpoint of the reactivity, easy availability, having, etc. This reaction is carried out by adding an acid of a concentration of, for example, 5 to 100% by weight at a speed maintaining a reaction temperature of 10 to 30°C, more preferably a reaction temperature of 15 to 25°C.<br>
The reaction temperature of the cyclization reaction-is preferably a temperature of 45°C or less from the viewpoint of prevention of polymerization and other secondary reactions. Considering the reaction speed, a temperature of 35 to 40°C is further preferable. The reaction time is not particularly limited, but is preferably 5 to 15 hours, more preferably 7 to 10 hours.<br>
After the end of the reaction, the reaction solution is gradually cooled to, for example, a temperature of 15°C or less and adjusted in pH, then the crystal of 2-<br><br>
cyanoiraino-1,3-thiazolidine is precipitated. The pH is adjusted to preferably a pH of 5.5 to 7.5, more preferably a pH of 6.6 to 7.0. The acid usable for adjusting the pH is not particularly limited. For example, mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, may be exemplified. Various solutions may be used, but the use of hydrochloric acid is preferably from the viewpoint of the reactivity or easy availability. This slurry solution is cooled to a temperature of, for example, 1B°C or less, then the slurry is separated. The yield of the crystal of 2-cyanoimino-1,3-thiazolidine thus obtained is usually at least 80% (based on cyanamide) and the purity at•least 99% (measured by HPLC).<br>
The drying conditions differ depending on the drier, but when using a box type drier, from the viewpoint of the prevention of decomposition of the 2-cyanoimino-l, 3-thiazolidine, the solution is preferably dried at a drying temperature of 60 to 80°C, more preferably 65 to 75°C, for preferably a drying time of 30 minutes to 48 hours, more preferably 8 to 16 hours. Examples<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail by the following Examples, but the present invention is, of course, not limited to these Examples. Eo<amp_le__l></amp_le__l>
A 1000 ml four-necked flask provided with a thermometer and stirring device was charged with 108 g (6.0 moles) of water. While stirring, 256.0 g (1.6 moles) of a 25% by weight aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and 70.9 g (1.5 moles) of sodium cyanide were added. While maintaining the temperature at 5°C or less, chlorine gas (1.5 moles) was reacted over 6 hours. After the end of the reaction, the residual chlorine gas was exhausted outside of the system by nitrogen gas. Next, while maintaining the temperature of 5°C or less, a 36% by weight aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid was<br><br>
added, the pH was adjusted to 7.0, then 350 ml (2.0 moles) of chloroform was added.<br>
142.0 g (0.85 mole) of a 25% by weight aqueous solution of cyanamide was added and a 36% by weight aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid was gradually added, whereby a reaction was carried out for 2 hours, while adjusting the pH to 6.6 to 7.0.
