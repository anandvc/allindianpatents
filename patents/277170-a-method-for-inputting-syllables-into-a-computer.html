SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR INPUTTING SYLLABLES INTO A COMPUTER<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a user interface in a computer system, and more particularly relates to data entry into a computer.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Generally, data entry into computers is performed using keyboards. The complexity and size of keyboards depend on the number and type of characters present in a script. Typically, phonetic scripts, such as Indic, Sinhalese, Burmese, Thai, Vietnamese, and the like tend to have large and/or complex character sets. Such scripts can present great difficulties in the design as well as use of these keyboards. For example, Indic scripts have nearly 30 to 40 consonants, 12 to 15 vowels, and about 12 to 15 phonetic modifiers and half consonant modifiers. It can be envisioned that various combinations of these consonants, vowels, and modifiers can result in forming a significantly large character set. To accommodate such a large character set, the amount of keyboard area required can be very large and would be impossible to build or use such a keyboard as a practical matter.<br>
As a result, the current techniques employ either a keyboard where several key strokes may be required to enter a desired syllable or a character recognition technique that recognizes entire characters. The keyboard approach provides incomplete visibility of the entire character map at any given point of time. In addition, these keyboards are non-intuitive and can require extensive practice period for proficiency. Further, character entries using such keyboards tend to be very slow. Furthermore, the increasing demand for smaller and smaller devices is driving keyboard designs toward a smaller one-handed keypad making it impractical to use keyboards accommodating such large character sets. This can pose a severe problem for handheld devices, such as PDAs, which currently use graffiti keypads or T9 keyboards.<br>
The character recognition approach requires entering characters using a pen to naturally write an entire character on a graphics tablet. In this approach, the character recognition technique attempts to find the character that most closely matches the strokes entered on the tablet. Most of the current handwritten character recognition techniques<br>
 <br>
recognize neatly printed characters. However, the recognition accuracy of handwritten characters in scripts having complex shapes, such as Indic, Arabic, and the like is significantly poor.<br>
Currently, handwritten character recognition techniques are not robust enough to handle the different writing styles of an arbitrary user of such characters in phonetic scripts and hence tend to have significantly lower recognition accuracy. In addition, the current handwritten character recognition techniques are not capable of handling characters of scripts, such as Indic, Arabic, South-east Asian, and the like, which have complex shapes and require writing these shapes neatly by using strokes in a particular direction and order. Further, the characters in phonetic scripts are generally highly cursive in nature at the syllable level, which makes it even more difficult for the current handwritten character recognition techniques to recognize such handwritten characters.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In the following detailed description of the various embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.<br>
The term "shape recognizer" means a recognition algorithm that classifies input patterns into one of a plurality of classes, the parameters and/or structure of such a classifier being determined from the statistics of the input patterns. Examples of algorithms used in the handwritten character recognizer include neural networks, radial basis functions, classification and regression trees, parametric Bayesian models, mixtures of experts, polynomial classifiers, and the like. Other examples of handwritten character recognizers are obvious to those skilled in the art of pattern recognition.<br>
 <br>
The terms "character recognizer", "handwritten character recognizer", "handwritten character recognition engine", "online handwritten character recognition engine", "handwritten gesture recognition engine" and "handwritten shape recognition engine", and "shape recognizer" are used interchangeably throughout the document. All of these terms refer to shape recognition engine operating on a base character and a linguistic data base to recognize and produce a desired syllable or character.<br>
The term "phonetic script" refers to scripts, such as Indic which are vowel dominant. In these scripts, the consonant in their pure form do not include the vowel sounds. Vowels have to be attached to the consonants to make them complete. In a full consonant approach, the consonant is assumed to have the vowel attached to it by default. Grammatically, another vowel cannot be attached to it. One uses the matra forms of other vowels (i.e., modifiers, vowel signs, and so on) as a separate entity which are attached to the full consonant.<br>
The term "digitizing tablet" refers to an input device for obtaining graphics input. It is connected to a computer and includes some form of a pen-like pointing device called a transducer. The tablet has a flat surface with a defined space, or active area, where the user can place a gesture character map of a desired phonetic script; the map can be an overlay. A pointing device is then used to pinpoint areas within the map, and the tablet sends associate character and/or modifier data to the gesture-keypad-engine. The flat surface along with the pen-like pointing device provides a more natural drawing motion for users to input data into a computer.<br>
In the specification and claims herein, the word "pen" is used. When used in the specification and claims, this word shall mean a position designating device that is sensed by the input tablet or touchpad. For a standard graphics tablet, this is a special stylus, while for a standard capacitive touchpad, this is a finger. The special stylus can be used to draw or trace images, which are then converted to digital data that can be processed by the computer.<br>
 <br>
The term "character" refers to a member of alphabetic, logographic, and/or phonetic/syllabic character set, which includes syllables, alphabets, numerals, and punctuation marks. The term "syllable" refers to a unit of spoken language consisting of a single uninterrupted sound formed by a vowel, diphthong, or syllabic consonant alone, or by any of these sounds preceded, followed, or surrounded by one or more consonants.<br>
Further, the terms "selecting a character from a set of characters" and "locating a character from a set of characters" are used interchangeably throughout the document. Furthermore, the terms "entering one or more natural handwritten modifier strokes" and "locating one or more natural handwritten modifier strokes" are used interchangeably throughout the document.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an example method 100 of inputting shapes into a computer. At step 110, this example method 100 locates a base shape from a set of shapes using a digitizing tablet. At 120, one or more modifying gestures are drawn substantially over and/or around the located base shape using the digitizing tablet to form a desired shape.<br>
At 130, an associated data of the formed desired shape is inputted into a gesture-keypad-engine via the digitizing tablet upon completion of the drawing of the one or more modifying gestures. In some embodiments, the associated data of the located base shape is inputted into the gesture-keypad-engine via the digitizing tablet upon inputting a selection gesture into the computer when the located base character does not need any modifying gestures.<br>
At 140, a candidate shape is produced by the gesture-keypad-engine. Then at 150, the produced candidate shape is outputted. The outputted candidate shape can be transmitted using a communication channel, such as a radio wave, printed using a printer, pronounced in a speaker using text-to-speech engine, and/or displayed using a computer monitor.<br>
Referring now to FIG.2, there is illustrated a schematic diagram of a displayed candidate shape 200 formed by using the steps described above with reference to FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 2, a desired shape of letter "U" is formed by first locating a base shape<br>
 <br>
210 from a set of shapes and then modifying the located base shape 210 by drawing a modifying gesture 220 to produce the candidate shape of letter "U" 200.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, there is illustrated a schematic diagram of another displayed candidate shape "W" 300 formed, similarly to the candidate shape "U" shown in FIG. 1, by using the steps described above with reference to FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 3, a desired shape of letter "W" is formed by first locating a base shape 310 from a set of shapes and then modifying the located base shape 310 by drawing a modifying gesture 320 to produce the candidate shape of letter "U" 300. It can be envisioned that by using the above-described technique many such combinations of shapes, forms, and/or characters can be formed. Also, it can be envisioned that by using only a few basic shapes, forms, and/or characters, a significantly large number of desired shapes, forms, and/or characters can be formed and inputted into a computer. This can considerably reduce the required keyboard area in a user input device.<br>
The present invention is described in detail further below using Devanagiri text input, which typically presents unique challenges for data entry into a computer using a keyboard. The following describes a new scheme for entering syllables of phonetic scripts, such as Indie, using a gesture based keyboard approach. The technique uses a spatial location of a base character using a typical keyboard or other such user input devices followed by one or more natural pen gestures substantially over the base character position to modify the base character to produce a desired syllable. This is accomplished by inputting the above two inputs into a gesture-keypad-engine, which outputs a candidate syllable.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates an example method 400 of inputting syllables of a phonetic script into a computer. At step 410, this example method 400 locates a base character from a set of characters using a digitizing tablet to form a desired syllable.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, there is illustrated a screen shot 500 of selecting a base character 530 using a stylus 520 on an electronic tablet 510 which has a flat surface with a defined active area. As shown in FIG. 5, the defined active area has a map of a<br>
 <br>
Gesture board including syllables from an Indic script (Hindi) having a large character set. As shown in FIG. 5, a user places the stylus 520 over a base character and selects the desired base character 530 by placing the stylus 520 substantially over the desired base character 530. Also shown in FIG. 5, is a cursor 550 disposed in its initial starting position on a display device 540 disposed on the electronic tablet 510.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 5, the display device 540 shown in the screen shot 500 can be integrated into the digitizing tablet 500 and/or it can be operatively coupled to an external display device, such as a computer monitor, television (TV) screen, plasma display, liquid crystal display (LCD), and so on. It can be seen in FIG. 5, that the map of the gesture board 510 includes characters, such as vowels, vowel modifiers, consonants, consonant modifiers, English numerals, phonetic script numerals, and special characters. Special characters can include characters, such as space, back space, delete, and the like.<br>
At 415, the method 400 checks whether one or more modifying gestures are needed for the located base character to form the desired syllable. In some embodiments, the located base character is modified by drawing the one or more modifying gestures substantially over and/or around the located base character to form a current desired syllable. In some embodiments, the located base character is modified with one or more natural handwritten modifying gestures using the digitizing tablet to form the current desired syllable.<br>
Based on the determination at 415, if the one or more modifying gestures are needed for the located base character to form the desired syllable, the method 400 goes to act 420. At 420, the located base character is modified by drawing a first modifying gesture over the located base character.<br>
At 425, the method 400 checks whether first drawn modifying gesture is a valid modifier. Based on the determination at 415, if the drawn modifying gesture is a valid modifier, then the method 400 goes to 430 and inputs an associated data of the located base character and the first drawing modifying gesture into a gesture-keypad-engine via the digitizing tablet upon completion of the drawing of the first modifying gesture. In some<br>
 <br>
embodiments, the formed current desired syllable is inputted into a gesture-keypad-engine via the digitizing tablet upon completion of the drawing of the one or more modifying gestures.<br>
At 435, the gesture-keypad-engine then produces a current candidate syllable based on the inputted associated data. At 440, the method 400 checks to determine if a second modifying gesture is needed to the produced candidate syllable. If a second modifying gesture is needed, then the method 400 goes to act 420 and repeats acts 420-440 to form a current candidate syllable. If the second modifying gesture is not needed, then the method 400 goes to act 445 and outputs the current candidate syllable.<br>
At 470, the method 400 checks to determine if a next syllable is needed to form a word. If a next syllable is not needed to form the word, then the method 400 goes to act 480 and stops forming the next syllable to form the word as described above. If the next syllable is needed to form the word, the method 400 goes to act 410 and repeats acts 410-480 to select, modify, input and display the next syllable of the word. In some embodiments, the next candidate syllable is cursively connected to the current candidate syllable and displayed on a display device, such as a computer monitor.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6, there is illustrated a screen shot 600 of drawing a desired modifying gesture 610 substantially over and/or around the located base character 530 to form a current desired syllable using the stylus 520. It can be seen in FIG. 6 that the drawn modifying gesture 610 is shown in a light contrasting color to give a feedback to the user of the modifier drawn around the located base character 530 and also to give a feeling of natural pen gesture, i.e., to give a natural feeling of handwriting to facilitate easier entry of desired one or more modifying gestures over the located base character 530.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, upon completion of the drawing of the desired modifying gesture 610 substantially over and/or around the located base character 530, the associated data of the current desired syllable is inputted into a gesture-keypad-engine (not shown). The gesture-keypad-engine then produces a current candidate syllable. The produced current candidate syllable 620 is then displayed on the display device 540.<br>
 <br>
Referring now to FIGS. 7-9, there is illustrated screen shots 700-900 of selecting a next base character 705, by sequentially drawing one or more modifying gestures 710, 810, and 910, and progressively inputting the base character 705 along with the drawn one or more modifying gestures 710, 810, and 910 into the gesture-keypad-engine to continuously produce next candidate syllables 720, 820, and 920, respectively. As shown in FIGS. 7-9, the produced next candidate syllables 720, 820, and 920 are displayed progressively on the display device 540 until the next desired syllable 920 is formed. It can be seen in FIGS 7-9, that while drawing the one or more modifying gestures 710, 810, and 910, the drawn portion of the modifying gestures 710, 810, and 910 are shown in a light contrasting color to facilitate the natural pen gesture. Also shown in FIGS. 7-9, is the next candidate syllable cursively connected with the current candidate syllable.<br>
In these embodiments, based on the determination at 415, if one or more modifying gestures are not needed, the method 400 goes to act 450 and draws a gesture to select the base character. At 455, an associated digital data of the located base character is inputted into the gesture-keypad-engine upon drawing the gesture to select the base character. At 460, a current candidate syllable is produced based on the inputted associated digital data of the base character. At 465, the produced current candidate syllable is displayed and goes to act 470.<br>
At 470, the method 400 checks to determine if a next syllable is needed to complete the word. If so, then the method 400 goes back to act 410 to select a next base character. If not, the method 400 goes to act 480 and stops.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 10, there is illustrated a screen shot 1000 of locating a next base character 1010 on the map of the gesture board 510 and gesturing down on the next character 1010 using the stylus 520 to select and input the associated data into the gesture-keypad-engine. Upon completion of the inputting of the associated data of the located base character, the next base character 1010 is displayed on the display device 540, such as the one shown in FIG. 5 and/or on any other display device connected to the electronic tablet 510.<br>
 <br>
Referring now to FIG. 11, there is illustrated a screen shot 1100 of selecting a space character 1110 using the stylus 520 on the gesture board 510 to input a space character into the gesture-keypad-engine (not shown) to produce a space character after completing the formation of the word 1130 using the above-described acts 410-480, Also shown in FIG. 11, is the displaying of the produced space character 1120 after the completion of the formation of the word 1130. It can be envisioned that subsequent words can be formed similarly using the above-described syllable entry technique.<br>
Although the flowcharts 100 and 400 includes acts 110-150 and 410-480, respectively, that are arranged serially in the exemplary embodiments, other embodiments of the subject matter may execute two or more steps in parallel, using multiple processors or a single processor organized as two or more virtual machines or sub-processors. Moreover, still other embodiments may implement the steps as two or more specific interconnected hardware modules with related control and data signals communicated between and through the modules, or as portions of an application-specific integrated circuit. Thus, the exemplary process flow diagrams are applicable to software, firmware, and/or hardware implementations.<br>
