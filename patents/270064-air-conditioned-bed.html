				<td>1.	HELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to air-conditioning the enclosed place for taking rest. Confining the cool air in the desired area was the objective. This invention relates to saving the electricity by cooling only the desired area. In particular, this invention is also related to solving the problems like, humidity, noise pollution, mosquitoes and interrupted power supply while taking rest. Besides, the invention also requires lower power compressors for cooling the desired place that eventually save lots of power and thus makes air-conditioning affordable even for a common man.<br>
2.	BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The common practice of air-conditioning requires a lots of electricity consumption because it requires air-conditioning of the whole room. From the point of view of affordability the consumption of electricity is the prime factor for an ordinary customer. Since most of the houses are not constructed for air conditioning so, proper insulation, false sealing and door closers, which are mandatory for effective air-conditioning, are not taken<br>
care of while constructing the house. Above all, the whole room requires lots of cooling and therefore air-conditioning of such rooms requires very high consumption of electricity and high-powered air conditioners. Generally, a person taking sleep/rest requires only his bed air-conditioned. In practice an air-conditioner cools whole room, which is often not required. Continuous electricity supply is another problem for maintaining a constant temperature by air-conditioning. Since high-powered air-conditioners are required for rooms not designed for air-conditioning, it is often difficult to run them on inverter and impossible for running them on inverter for long duration. So, air-conditioner does not ensure unabated cooling by air-conditioner and thus maintenance of a constant temperature is difficult to achieve.<br>
In the densely populated urban areas, noise pollution is another factor that disturbs people resting after day's hard labor. Most of the houses are not constructed sound proof. Therefore, sound pollution, even in air-conditioned rooms, keep rest elusive to people staying in such rooms.<br>
Mosquitoes are another problem to take rest or even stay in a place full of mosquitoes. Air conditioning is just a solution to soaring temperature. People use uncomfortable and uneasy ways like mosquito net, mosquito repellant cream and mosquito repellant coil/liquid/sprays to keep mosquito away.<br>
The wastage in cooling the whole room when cooling of only the resting area i.e. bed was required was realized. An attempt was made to avoid wastage of cooling by producing portable air-conditioners of different types, for personal air-conditioning. But they could not solve the problem of air-conditioning the desired area.<br>
3.   SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The invented device is an enclosed air-conditioned bed that is a cozy place for resting/sleeping. The objective of the invention is to make air-conditioning affordable by saving in power consumption and providing air-conditioning even in the case of power failure by the means of inverter. The enclosed bed is a small place to maintain free from flying insects like mosquitoes. The airtight enclosure  is made of insulator substances and  its  soundproof<br>
quality keeps noise disturbance away. Most of the modern air-conditioners have humidity control function. Hence, in sum total, this air-conditioned bed is an ideal rest-taking device, which is free from all the problems faced even by ordinary air-conditioner users.<br>
4.   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Unit Used:-<br>
Ti = inside temperature;<br>
RH = Relative humidity;<br>
BTU = British thermal unit;<br>
Sec = second;<br>
Mm =millimeter;<br>
Amp = amper;<br>
To = outside temperature;<br>
Cfm - cubic feet per minute; and<br>
Deg C = degree Centigrade (Celsius).<br>
Air-Conditioner power calculations:<br>
IfTi = 23 deg C,RH = 50-45<br>
And To = 40 deg C, RH =100<br>
Heat to be lost per pound of dry air = 25+15 = 40 BTU.<br><br>
Heat influx = 550.8 watts for polystyrene foam insulation, (sensible heat)<br>
Heat generation for 2 persons (adults) = 2X102.55 = 205.1 watts (134.78<br>
watt sensible heat and 70.32 latent heat)<br>
Minimum ventilation per person = 5 cfm,<br>
Or, 10 cfm for 2 persons.<br>
Hence heat load = 756 watts and 10 cfm of ventilation<br>
10cfm = 0.17cfs.<br>
28 kg of air occupies 22.4 cubic meter<br>
or 61.6 pounds occupy 791 cub ft<br>
or 01 cub ft. weighs 0.08 pounds.<br>
Hence, sensible heat due to 0.17 cu ft/sec ventilation = 0.08 X 0.17 X 40<br>
BTU/sec.<br>
= 1920 BTU/hr = 562 watts.<br>
Total heat load = 756 + 562 = 1318 watts.<br>
Assuming Cop of a standard refrigeration cycle ~ 4.<br>
Power consumption of compressor ~ 1318/4 = 329 watts at continuous<br>
duty cycle of compressor.<br>
Tonnage of this Air-conditioner (AC) =1318/3500 =0.377 Tons.<br>
Hence an AC of 0.5 tons capacity would be sufficient to cool the space in<br>
the bed.<br>
A 0.5-ton AC would draw about 4 amps current. This translates to about 880 VA. But since starting current is about 6 times rated current, intermittently power would go up 4.8 KVA. Hence a 5 KVA inverter should be able to run 0.5-ton AC. The calculations show that at the most 0.377-ton power AC is sufficient to make the invention successful. The requirement of the inverter would be 5 KVA. These are theoretical calculations based upon hypothetical condition. In real time situation human body should not radiate this much heat in an air-conditioned environment. Therefore, lesser power should be required to maintain the requisite temperature.<br>
In the figure 1, insulated walls have been mounted upon the bed by the support of steel angles. A roof has been laid of the same or similar insulated material to make the enclosed place airtight. The cool air outlet of the AC is mounted upon one side of the vertical wall in which hole for inserting the face of the AC has been created. The insulated walls are double sheets of some insulating material and polystyrene foam sheet of 5 mm width has been filled to fill the gap between the insulating sheets. The power cord is connected to the power supply and the inverter. To get inside and come outside the enclosed bed sliding doors have been placed<br>
on both the sides of the bed. The doors have been fitted with large transparent polycarbonate double walled windows.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
