The present invention relates to progesterone receptor modulating compounds as well as to the use of these compounds in therapy.<br>
Intracellular receptors are a class of structurally related proteins involve d in the regulation of gene proteins. Steroid receptors are a subset of these receptors, including the progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineratocorticoid receptor (MR). Regulation of a gene by such factors requires the intracellular receptor and a corresponding ligand which has the ability to selectively bind to the receptor in a way that affects gene transcription.<br>
Progesterone receptor modulators (progestagens) are known to play a n important role in the health of women. The natural ligand for the PR receptor is the steroid hormone progesterone, but synthetic compounds have been made which may also serve as ligands (see e.g. Jones et al U.S., Patent No. 5,688,810).<br>
Progestagens are currently widely used for hormonal contraception and in HRT. Other important clinical applications of progestagens are treatment of gynaecological disorders (e.g. endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, severe premenstrual syndrome), breast cancer, and luteal support during IVF. PR agonists are used in birth control formulations, whereas PR antagonists may be used in contraception, hormone dependent cancers, hormone displacement therapy, endometriosis etc.<br>
The current steroidal progestagens have been proven to be quite safe and are well tolerated. Sometimes, however, side effects (e.g. breast tenderness, headaches, depression, and weight gain) have been reported that are attributed to these steroidal progestagens, either alone or in comb ination with estrogenic compounds .<br>
Steroidal ligands for one receptor often show cross-reactivity with other steroidal receptors. Many progestagens also bind e.g. to the glucocorticoid receptor. Non¬steroidal progestagens have no molecular structural simi iarity with steroids and therefore one might also expect differences in physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, tissue distribution (e.g. CNS versus peripheral) and, more importantly, non-steroidal progestagens may show no/less cross-reactivity to other steroid receptors. Therefore, non-steroidal progestagens will score differently in these respects.<br><br>
The present invention provides non-steroidal compounds that modulate progesterone receptor activity. More particularly, the present invention provides high affinity non¬steroidal compounds which are agonists, partial agonists or antagonists of the progesterone receptor. Preferably these compounds are highly specific for the "progesterone receptor. According to the present invention compounds are provided having a general Formula I, , a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutical acceptable salt of either the compound or the prodrug.<br><br>

The sequences of steps to synthesize the compounds of the present invention are shown in Schemes l-XVIII. In each of the Schemes the R groups correspond to the substitution pattern noted in the Examples and to Formula I.<br><br>
Tetracyclic templates (such as structure 11) were constructed by routine synthetic methods as described in Scheme i. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution of 2-fluoro nitrophenyls with appropriately substituted phenols, thiophenols or anilines provided the diaryl ethers, thioethers or amines 1, respectively, in the case of X=CH2, structure 1 was commercially available. Reduction of the nitro group with SnCI 2 yielded the aniline derivatives 2. Acylation of the aniline functionality with 5-chlorovaleryl chloride yielded the amides 3. Subsequent ring closure was accomplished by treatment of the amide with PPA at 150°C. Treatment of imine structures 4 with sodium methoxide resulted in an intramolecular cyclization and afforded the tetracyclic systems 5. Reaction of the enamine functionality with trichloroacetyl chloride yielded the trichloroacetyl derivatives 6. The trichloroacetyl functionality was transformed into methyl ester derivatives 7 on treatment with sodium methoxide. Subsequent reduction of the alkene functionality of the unsaturated carboxylates 7 with borane gave exclusively cis isomers such as structures 8. Epimehsation to the trans isomers 9 was accomplished upon treatment of 8 with sodium methoxide. Saponification of the ester afforded the carboxyiate 10 which subsequently was transformed via a classic Curtius reaction to an amine functionality resulting in the trans-1-amino-tetrahydropyrido-dibenz(ox/othi/odi)azepine derivatives<br>
II.	The racemic mixture was separated into its pure enantiomers via chiral HPLC (OJ<br>
column (25x0.46 cm)).<br>
The tetracyclic compounds (11) were employed as starting materials in Schemes II and<br>
III.	In Scheme II is depicted the acylation of the amine functionality of structure 11,<br>
which was accomplished via various different routine synthetic methods (i.e. acid<br>
chlorides, anhydrides, carboxylic acids with coupling reagents, or amidation). The<br>
resulting amide structures 12 were target of subsequent modification. Treatment of the<br>
amides such as structure 12 with phosphorous pentasulfide afforded the thioamides 13.<br>
Alkylation of the amide in 12 with alkylating agents in the presence of sodium hydride<br>
afforded structures 14. Structures 15 have been prepared via amidine formation of the<br>
amine functionality of 11 by treatment with nitrile derivatives such as<br>
trifluoroacetonitrile.<br><br><br>
Scheme HI describes the formation of the urethane structures 16 starting from 11 via reaction with chloroformates in the presence of sodium bicarbonate. Treatment of structure 11 with isothiocyanates afforded the thiourea derivatives 17. Reductive alkylation of the amine functionality in structure 11 with aldehydes in the presence of sodium tnacetoxyborohydnde afforded structures 18. Alkylation of the amine functionality with 2-methoxyethyl bromide afforded structures 26, Structures 27 were obtained by treatment with (-butyl bromoacetate.<br><br><br>
Direct   electrophilic   aromatic   substitutions   on   core   structures   afforded   various alternative aromatic substituted derivatives (Scheme IV-V).<br>
Scheme IV<br><br><br>
In Scheme IV is described the chiorinaiion of 12 wherein R3 is CI with N-chlorosuccinimide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCI; this resulted in the formation of the two different substituted structures 19A and 19B, which were easily separated. In contrast, bromination of 12 with N-bromosuccinimide under identical conditions yielded only the compound with structure 20. Reductive dehalogenation of the chloro compound (12) was achieved by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of Pd/C and HCI to yield the hydro derivative 21. Nitration of structure 12 with nitric acid gave completely selectively the mono-substituted derivative 22.<br>
Direct chlorination on structure 21 (Scheme V) with N-chlorosuccinimide afforded the two regioisomers 23A and 23B, two compounds which were easily separated by chromatographical methods.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme VI reduction of the nitro functionality of structures such as 22 with SnCl2-2H20 in ethanol gave the aniline derivatives 24. Sulfonation or acylation of this aniline functionality afforded the substituted compounds such as structure 25,<br><br>
As outlined in Scheme VII, treatment of dichloro compound 19B with K2CO3 resulted in the formation of the corresponding amine 28 and subsequent formylation with ethyl formate afforded structure 29.<br><br><br>
Schemes VIII and IX describe the synthesis of bromo derivatives 36 where R4 = Br. Imine formation by treatment of a mixture of the amine and salicyl aldehyde with  p-toluenesuifonic acid and subsequent ring closure by etherification afforded tricyclic intermediates 31.<br><br>
Scheme IX describes the sequences of steps to synthesize compounds 36 starting from tricyclic intermediates such as compounds 31. Treatment of tricyclic imine 31 with glutaric anhydride afforded tetracycles 32. A Curtius rearrangement with DPPA and an alcohol resulted in the formation of urethane structures 33. Reduction of the amide functionality was accomplished by applying borane in THF. Treatment of urethane structures 34 with HBr in acetic acid afforded amines 35. Acylation of the amine functionality with trifluoroacetic anhydride afforded the corresponding amides 36.<br><br><br>
Bromo derivatives 36 were employed as starting materials in scheme X. Stille reactions afforded compounds with an acetyl (structures 37) or a vinyl functionality {structures 39). Treatment of bromo derivatives 36 with CuCN yielded the corresponding cyano compounds 38. Compound 40 was synthesized by a Negishi reaction with a palladium catalyst and methylzinc chloride. Treatment of bromo derivatives 36 with Cul and NaOMe yielded methoxy derivatives 41.<br><br>
The synthesis of compounds 46 proceeded similar to the route described for bromo derivatives 36. The tricyclic intermediate 45 was synthesized in a different manner than described in scheme XI. The synthesis started with an etheriftcation followed by a<br><br>
reduction of the nitro functionality and a formylation of the amine 43. Treatment with PPA then effected ring closure to tricyclic compound 45.<br>
Scheme XI<br><br>
The bromo derivative 46 was used as starting material in scheme XII where a vinyl (structure 49) and an acetyl derivative (structure 47) were formed by a Stiile reaction. A nitrile functionality was introduced by treatment with CuCN. A benzylamine was introduced by a Buchwald reaction; subsequ ent hydrogenation of this product generated the amine 51. A reaction with propionyl chloride afforded the corresponding amide (structure 52).<br><br><br>
The synthesis of derivatives with R5H is described in Schemes XIII and XIV. The tricyclic intermediate was obtained by imine formation and subsequent ring closure through etherification.<br>
Scheme XIII<br><br><br>
Cyano derivative 56, methyl derivative 57 and dichloro compound 58 were obtained by treatment of compound 55 with CuCN, methylzinc chloride or NCS, respectively, as was described in Scheme X.<br>
Scheme XIV<br><br>
The synthetic route towards fluoro derivatives  61  (R5 and/or R10 -F) is shown in Scheme  XV and is similar to the synthetic route towards derivatives with  R5 *H (Scheme XIII). In this case, ring closure by etherification was accomplished by using a microwave.<br>
Scheme XV<br><br>
Derivatives with X = N-Me (structures 67, 68 and 69) were synthesized according to Scheme XVI. Tricyclic intermediate 65 was synthesized by a coupling of 4-ch!oro-1-fluoro-2-nitrobenzene and W-methylaniline, followed by a reduction of the nitro functionality and a formylation of the amine. Rina closure towards intrme.diRtp 65 was<br><br>
accomplished by treatment with PPA. The sequences of steps to synthesiz e compouna<br>
66 from compound 65 are described in scheme IX. The amine functionality of<br>
compound 66 was acylated to yield amide 67 or alkylated to afford compound 68.<br>
Subsequent	saponification	afforded	compound	69.<br>
Scheme XVI<br><br>
The route towards derivatives with X=N-H proceeded via tricyclic amide 72, which was obtained by an intramolecular condensation. Reduction with LtAIH 4 and subsequent oxidation with MnOs afforded tricyclic intermediate 74. The corresponding amide 75 was synthesized as described in Scheme IX.<br><br><br>
Application of 3-methyl glutaric anhydride in the formation of tetracyclic intermediate 78 and subsequent urethane formation resulted in a mixture of isomers 80, 81 and 82, as shown in Scheme XVIII. Treatment with HBr in acetic acid, followed by an acylation and separation of the isomers, resulted in the formation of amides 86, 87 and 88.<br><br><br>
Methods to determine receptor binding as well as in vitro and in vivo assays to determine biological activity of the compounds are well known. In general, expressed receptor is treated with a compound of the invention and binding or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response is measured.<br>
To measure a functional response, isolated DNA encoding the progesterone receptor gene, preferably the human receptor, is expressed in suitable host cells. Such a cell might be the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell, but other cells are also suitable. Preferably the cells are of mammalian origin.<br>
Methods to construct recombinant progesterone receptor-expressing cell lines are well known in the art (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, latest edition). Expression of receptor  is   attained   by   expression   of the   DNA  encoding   the   desired   protein.<br><br>
Techniques for site-directed mutagenesis, ligation of additional sequences, PCR, and' construction of suitable expression systems are all, by now, well known in the art. Portions or all of the DNA encoding the desi red protein can be constructed synthetically using standard solid phase techniques, preferably to include restriction sites for ease of ligation. Suitable control elements for transcription and translation of the included coding sequence can be provided through the DNA coding sequences. As is well known, expression systems are now available which are compatible with a wide variety of hosts, including prokaryotic hosts such as bacteria and eukaryotic hosts such as yeast, plant cells, insect cells, mammalian cells, avian cells and the like.<br>
Cells expressing the receptor are then contacted with a compound of the invention to observe binding, or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response.<br>
Alternatively, isolated cytosol containing the expressed receptor may be used to measure binding of a compound of the invention.<br>
For measurement of binding, radioactive or fluorescence -labelled compounds may be used. As reference compound, the native hormone, or other compounds binding to the receptor, can be used. As an alternative, competition binding assays can be performed as well.<br>
Another assay involves screening for progesterone receptor agonist compounds of the invention by determining regulation of receptor mediated natural target gene mRNA, i.e genes regulated by the receptor through binding of the receptor in the promoter region of the gene. The levels of target gene mRNA will be reduced or increased, depending on the inhibitory or stimulating effect of a compound of the invention upon binding to the receptor.<br>
In addition to direct measurement of mRNA levels in the exposed cells, cells can be used which in addition to transfection with receptor encoding DNA have also been transfected with a second DNA encoding a reporter gene, the expression of which responds to binding of the receptor towards responsive elements in the promoter of the particular reporter gene. Such responsive elements might be classical hormone responsive elements, well known in the art and described e.g., in Beato, M, Chalepakis, G, Schauer, M, Slater, EP (1989) J. Steroid Biochem. 5:737-47 or might be constructed in such a way that they are connected to novel responsive elements. In general, reporter gene expression might be controlled by any response element reacting to progesterone receptor binding. Suitable reporter genes are e.g. LacZ, alkaline phosphatase, firefly luciferase and green fluorescence protein.<br>
For selecting active agonist compounds on the progesterone receptor, testing at 10 " M must result in an activity of more than 30% of the maximal activity when (16a)-16-ethyl-21~hydroxy-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (Org 2058) is used as a reference. For selecting antagonist compounds on the progesterone receptor, testing at 10 "5 M must<br><br>
result in an activity of more than 10% of the maxima I activity when (6 p, 11 p, 17p)-11 -[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-4',5'-dihydro-6-methylspiro[estra-4,9-diene-17J2,(3'H)-furan]-3-one (Org 31710} is used as a reference. Another criterion might be the ECsovaiue, which must be 
The skilled artisan will recognize that desirable EC50 values are dependent on the compound of the invention which is being tested. For example, a compound with an EC50 which is less than 10~5 M is, generally, considered a candidate for drug selection. Preferably this value is lower than 10"7 M. However, a compound which has a higher ECsc, but is selective for the particular receptor, may still be a candidate for drug selection.<br>
Basically any transactivation assay in mammalian cells (cell line or primary culture), that can yield information about the possible receptor activation can be used for the purpose of selecting potent ligands. The added value of using several cell systems, . with cells which originate from different organs, will be that information on the p otential tissue specificity of the ligands is obtained. Examples of cells frequently used to this end are, besides CHO cells, a.o. T47D cells, MCF7 cells, ECC-1 cells, HeLa cells, primary cultures of endometrial cells, and pituitary cells.<br>
The invention further resides in a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound having the general Formula I or a salt thereof.<br>
Thus, the compounds according to the invention can be used in therapy.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be applied clinically i n those regimens<br>
where progestagens are used.<br>
The invention therefore resides in the use of a compound having the general Formula I for the manufacture of a medicament for modulating progesterone receptor mediated health conditions in women, more in particular hormone dependent cancers such as breast, ovary and uterus cancer; endometriosis and fertility control. The invention also relates to a treatment of the conditions identified above by administering a compound of the invention.<br>
Suitable administration routes for the compounds of Formula I or pharmaceutical acceptable salts thereof, also referred to herein as the active ingredient, are intramuscular injections, subcutaneous injections, intravenous injections or intraperitoneal injections, oral and in tranasal administration. Preferably, the compounds can be administered orally. The exact dose and regimen of administration of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, will necessarily be dependent upon the therapeutic effect to be achieved (e.g. treatment of infertility; contraception, endometriosis) and may vary with the particular comDound tho mi ,to r rr,;~;.r.+.-~tion,<br><br>
and the age and condition of the individual subject to whom the medicament is to be administered.<br>
In general, parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon adsorption. However, a dosage for humans preferably contains 0.0001 -25 mg per kg body weight. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple subdoses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day, or, in case of female recipients, as doses to be administered at appropriate (daily) intervals throughout the menstrual cycle. The dosage as well as the regimen of administration may differ between a female and a male recipient.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound according to Formula I in admixture with pharmaceutical acceptable auxiliaries, and optionally other therapeutic agents. The auxiliaries must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical {including transdermal, buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration or administration via an implant- The compositions may be prepared by any method well Known in the art of pharmacy, for example, using methods such as those described in Gennaro ef a/., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (18th ed., Mack Publishing company, 1990, see especially Part 8: Pharmaceutical Preparations and Their Manufacture).<br>
Such methods include the step of bringing in association the active ingredient with any auxiliary agent. The auxiliary agent(s), also named accessory ingredients, include those conventional in the art (Gennaro, supra), such as, fillers, binders, diluents, disintegrants, lubricants, colorants, flavouring agents and wetting agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete dosage units such as pills, tablets or capsules, or as a powder or granules, or as a solution or suspen sion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus or paste. The compositions can further be processed into a suppository or enema for rectal administration.<br>
The invention further includes a pharmaceutical composition, as hereinbefore described, in combination with packaging materia!, including instructions for the use of the composition for the use as hereinbefore described.<br>
For parenteral administration, suitable compositions include aqueous and non -aqueous sterile injection. The compositions  may  be presented  in  unit-dose or multi-dose<br><br>
containers, for example sealed vials and ampoules, and may be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of sterile liquid carrier, for example, water prior to use.<br>
Compositions or formulations suitable for administration by nasal inhalation include fine dusts or mists which may be generated by means of metered dose pressurized aerosols, nebulisers or insufflators.<br>
The derivatives of the invention can also be administered in the form of devices, consisting of a core of active material, encased by a release rate -regulating membrane. Such implants are to be applied subcutaneously or locally, and will release the active ingredient at an approximately constant rate over relatively larg e periods of time, for instance from weeks to years. Methods for the preparation of implantable pharmaceutical devices as such are known in the art, for example as described in European Patent 0,303,306 (AKZO N.V.).<br>
