The stator part of a conventional electric motor is mounted on a mounting plate. The rotor shaft of the motor has an end projecting into a flexible coupling which is also fixed to the end of a 5  tangential fan impeller.<br>
Further devices are known from US 5,181,884 and US 4,511,786.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
10<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a ventilating device, the extent of which can be easily adapted to the space available therefor. It is a further object of the invention to provide a ventilating device which can be easily installed in new as well as existing buildings while allowing for individual control of the temperature of the rooms of the<br>
15  building. It is a still further object to provide a ventilating device which is capable of utilising the space available in a room to a maximum degree. It is a further object to ' provide a ventilating device which generates only as little aerodynamic noise as possible. it is a.further object to provide a ventilating device for a building which is easy and cheap   to manufacture and install. It is a further object of the invention to provide a Ventilating<br>
20 device which can be used as a heat exchanger and which can easily be mounted to cooling or heating pipes of a building.<br>
Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a ventilating device comprising:<br>
-	at least two impellers extending in a longitudinal direction around an axis of rotation,<br>
25       each of the impellers being adapted to suck air from an ambient atmosphere in a<br>
transverse direction over a substantial part of the impeller's length,<br>
-	a motor, which is preferably electrically driven, connected to the impellers, so as to<br>
cause rotation of the impellers around said axis,<br>
-	at least one holding member at each end of each of the impellers for holding the<br>
30       impellers,<br>
-	a cover for covering the holder and the impellers, and having openings formed therein<br>
so as to allow a flow of air into and out of the impellers, the cover comprising a<br>
connector for connecting the cover to the holding member,<br>
wherein the holding member is adapted to cooperate with the connector of the cover, so 35  as to connect or fix the cover to the holding member.<br><br>
The holding member may be adapted to releasably connect or fix the cover to the holding member, or the holding member may alternatively be secured to the cover.The connector may comprise one part or an assembly of a plurality of parts for connecting or fixing the holding member to the cover. 5<br>
Accordingly, a unit is provided in which the impellers, the cover, optionally a chassis and optionally one or more pipes containing a heating or cooling fluid are integrated. This has the advantageous effect that the ventilating device is easy to install, e.g., in existing buildings. Moreover, the impellers may be mounted in such a way that they are easy to<br>
10  remove, e.g., for cleaning purposes. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, no channels or pipes are needed for conveying the air flow emerging from the impellers to the cover outlet which confers reduced pressure drop and thus reduced power consumption as well as a reduced aerodynamic noise level. Moreover, due to the integrated nature of the device, the weight of the device may be very low thereby<br>
15 facilitating installation of the device.<br>
Each of the impellers preferably have blades extending along substantially the entire length of the impeller. Each impeller is preferably adapted to suck air into the impeller in a first transverse direction and to blow air out of the impeller in a second transverse<br>
20 direction which may, .e.g., be perpendicular to the first transverse direction. The motor may be connected to a series of impellers at one end of a series of impellers, in which case the impellers may be mutually interconnected by a coupling or force transmission assembly, so that rotation of the motor may cause rotation of a plurality of impellers. Alternatively, the motor may be arranged between two impellers, in which case each of<br>
25 the two impellers may be connected to further impellers or mounted to other impellers. The motor may comprise any conventional and commercially available electrically driven motor producing an appropriate power at an appropriate rate of revolution.<br>
The device may be adapted to be mounted to a pipe containing a heating or a cooling 30   fluid and to hold the impellers and the pipe in fixed positions in relation to each other, the impellers and the cover being adapted to cause a substantial part of the flow of air emerging from the impellers to flow in a transverse direction along the outer surface of the pipe and back to the ambient atmosphere. If the device is adapted to hold two pipes, e.g. a supply pipe and a return pipe, the device is preferably adapted to cause 40-60% of the<br><br>
air flow emerging from the impellers to flow around one of the pipes and the rest of the flow to flow around the other pipe.<br>
The pipe or pipes may be held by the holding member, or they may be held by a separate 5 frame or pipe clip. The separate frame or pipe clip may be connected to the holding member in a secured or a releasable manner.<br>
The pipe containing fluid may be a hot water pipe, a steam pipe or a hot air duct connected to or being part of a source of hot water or air or steam, e.g., a district heating 10 source or a central heating source connected to or comprised in a building. The fluid may comprise water, steam or air or any other suitable medium. On its outer surface the pipe may be provided with fins or ribs for improving heat transmission.<br>
In case the ventilating device is used for cooling purposes and a pipe containing a cooling 15 fluid, an absorption layer or pad may be provided for absorbing condense water. The absorption layer or pad may be provided in a drip tray comprised in the device. A drip tray is.in particular useful in case the pipes extend in a non-horizontal direction. The. .. absorption layer may be made from a cloth of an inorganic material, such as from cellulose fibres. The layer is preferably adapted to distribute condense water droplets over 20 the entire area of the layer. As an alternative to the absorption layer, or in addition to the absorption layer, a draining pipe for leading away condense water may be provided. The draining pipe may comprise one or more openings for letting condense water into the pipe, such as for example a longitudinally extending slot at the top of the pipe. The draining pipe may be mounted to or held by the holding member, or it may be mounted to 25 or be an integrated part of the cover. Suction may be provided in the draining pipe in order to actively suck condense water from absorption layer or pad and/or the drip tray.<br>
The holding member may be made from steel or any other metal, such as Aluminium or a coated Aluminium, or from a plastic material and may be adapted to be securely fixed in<br>
30 relation to, e.g., a wall or a floor of a building. It may comprise bores or grooves for the pipe and/or for bearings for the impellers. The holding member is preferably designed such that it can easily be detached from the impellers and/or the pipe, including any possible optional return pipe for the fluid. A groove for holding a pipe or a bearing for an impeller may be built as a resilient clip surrounding the pipe or impeller bearing over a part<br>
35  of its periphery only. Alternatively, or additionally, the holding member may be provided<br><br>
with a through-going bore or hole for receiving and holding the impeller bearing or pipe. The holding member may be adapted to hold one impeller only, or it may be adapted to hold two impellers in an end-to-end fashion. Preferably, each impeller is supported by a holding member at each of its ends. Each holding member may be adapted to be fitted 5  into a transition between two walls of a room or into a transition between wall and floor, or wall and ceiling. A chassis may be provided, the holding members being mounted or connected to the chassis.<br>
The heat transfer may be relatively high in view of the noise generated by the device as 10  compared to prior art devices. In a typical application of the ventilating device, when used as a heat exchanger, the heat exchange is 200 - 400 Watt per meter, such as approximately 300 Watt per meter, at an impeller speed of 1000 - 2000 rpm, such as approximately 1500 rpm, and at a temperature difference between the ambient air and the fluid of 30-40°C, such as approximately 35°C, and with two pipes, such as a supply and a 15  return flow pipe.<br>
Preferably, the impellers and their bearings are constructed so that the mechanical arid aerodynamic noise generated by the impellers and their bearings is not detectable by the human ear at a distance of 1 meter from the device, i.e. the noise being less than 20<br>
20  dB(A). If a higher noise level is acceptable, e.g., in an office building where approximately twice as much noise as the aforementioned noise level is acceptable due to noise generated by ventilators of, e.g., computers, the transmitted effect may be as high as 400 - 800 Watt per meter, such as approximately 600 Watt per meter under the above-mentioned circumstances.<br>
25<br>
The cover may be made from metal, such as Aluminium, steel or a steel alloy, or it may be made from a plastics material. The cover preferably comprises one or more openings for allowing air entering and leaving the impellers to pass therethrough. The openings may be made as louvers. The cover may be adapted to be fixed or detachably mounted to<br>
30  a wall or a floor of a building, or it may be adapted to be fixed or detachably mounted or connected, e.g. pivotally connected, to the holding members. The cover may be formed as a plate with 90° bend extending along its entire length. It may be provided with a projection or a collar portion for engaging with one or more corresponding grooves in the holding members. The cover may have two sets of openings, one set being provided at<br>
35  one surface of the cover and allowing air to enter the impellers in the first transverse<br><br>
direction, and another set provided at another surface and allowing air to escape or emerge from the impellers in the second transverse direction. In case the longitudinal extent of the ventilating device is greater than the length of cover available, a plurality of covers may be arranged in a series. 5<br>
1<br>
It will be appreciated that while the ventilating device is easy to assemble and install as well in new buildings as in existing buildings, the length of the ventilating device can easily be varied by varying the number of impellers and holding members and adjusting the length of the cover accordingly. Due to the integration of pipe and impeller by means of 10  the holding member, the invention allows for a compact design, while the ventilating device is not dependent on the presence of other exterior devices than the pipe connected to a cooling or heating source. Thus, the ventilating device according to the invention is flexible and easy to handle.<br>
15  The pipe preferably constitutes a supply pipe for the fluid. The ventilating device may in addition to the pipe, or supply pipe, comprise a return pipe for the fluid, in which case the device may be adapted to hold the return pipe in relation to the impellers and the supply pipe. The holding member may hold the return pipe irva fixed position in relation to the impellers and the supply pipe. The pipe or the supply pipe may comprise a finned pipe.<br>
20  Preferably, the impeller and the cover as well as any baffles or guide members included in the ventilating device are designed in such a way as to cause a major part of the flow emerging from the impeller, and preferably the entire flow, to flow past the supply pipe. A longitudinally extending baffle for guiding the flow is preferably mounted to the inner side of the cover. The baffle or guide member is preferably designed so as to minimise<br>
25 aerodynamic noise and may be coated with or made from a heat insulating material. The baffle or guide member may be a separate element, or alternatively an integrated part of the cover. In case the baffle or guide member is a separate element, it may be adapted to be mounted on the pipe or pipes, e.g., by a clip-on mechanism. In case the baffle or guide member is integral with the cover, the cover and baffle/guide may be made in one piece,<br>
30  e.g., by moulding or extruding, or from a plastics material.<br>
For heating purposes, the supply pipe may be at a higher temperature than the temperature of the ambient air, whereas for cooling purposes the fluid in the supply pipe may be at a lower temperature than the temperature of the ambient air. The cover may, 35  preferably on its inner surface facing the pipe and the impeller, be coated or provided with<br><br>
a heat insulating material, so as to minimise the rate of heat exchange between the pipe(s) and the ambient air when the impeller is not operating.<br>
A plurality of impellers may be mounted on a common shaft in a series with the motor 5  arranged at one end of the series. Alternatively, the motor may be arranged between two of the impellers in the series. More than one motor may be provided in the ventilating device.<br>
Each of the holding members preferably comprises a bearing arrangement for the impeller<br>
10 or impellers being held by the bearing arrangement. The bearing may comprise ball or roller bearings, including needle bearings, sleeve bearings or journal bearing. Preferably, a bearing block abutting the outer surface of the ball or roller bearings is provided, the bearing block being fitted into a bore or groove in the holding member. The bearing block is preferably made from a heavy and cheap material, such as a metal, such as steel, zinc<br>
15 or brass, and may serve to dampen vibrations. The bearing may be adapted to dampen vibrations of the impellers, so as to dampen mechanical noise generated by the impellers and associated moving parts, and/or so as to extent the life time of moving parts. In order to dampen vibrations, a resilient ring may be fitted between the bearing block and a bore or groove in the holding member.<br>
20<br>
In order to transmit rotation from one impeller to another, a collar member may be provided, the collar member having, at one side, a collar portion into which an end portion of an impeller is fitted. The collar member may be mounted on one end of a shaft extending through the bearing. At the other end of the shaft, a further collar member may<br>
25  be mounted, which collar member is in engagement with a further impeller. Preferably the collar portion of the collar member is in engagement with a ring-shaped member provided on the outer periphery at the impellers at their respective ends. Rotation may be transmitted from one impeller to another by means of the two impellers' respective collar members and the shaft onto which both collar members are mounted. The collar member<br>
30  may further be adapted to dampen vibrations. Preferably, the collar member is made from a resilient material. This makes it possible to easily remove the impellers, e.g., for cleaning purposes.<br>
Preferably, the resilient ring is made from a material which is softer than the material from 35 which the resilient collar member is made. The resilient rings may be made from a soft<br><br>
rubber material, such as poron. The collar member may be made from a harder rubber material, such as silicon, or from plastic, such as from polyethylene which may be formed, e.g., by injection moulding.<br>
5  In order to control the rate of heat exchanged by the ventilating device and thereby to control the temperature of, e.g., a room in which the ventilating device is installed, a thermostat for metering the ambient temperature and for controlling the speed of rotation of the impellers in response to the ambient temperature may be provided.<br>
10  In a second aspect, the invention relates to a ventilating device comprising:<br>
-    at least two impellers extending in a longitudinal direction around an axis of rotation, each of the impellers being adapted to suck air from an ambient atmosphere in a transverse direction over a substantial part of the impeller's length, 15 -    a motor, preferably an electrically driven motor, connected to at least a first one of the impellers, so as to cause rotation of the impellers around said axis,      at least one coupling or force transmitting assembly for transmitting a driving force from said first impeller to a second one of the impellers.<br>
20 Thus, only one motor is applied for driving a plurality of impellers, thereby reducing the number of motors needed in an application of the ventilating device, as only one motor is required for driving two, three, four, five, six or more impellers, such as seven, eight, nine, ten or more than ten impellers, and as power supply for one one motor only is needed. Thereby, the costs involved in manufacturing, installing and running the device may be<br>
25 lower than if more motors were needed, and installation of the device may be facilitated. Further, the flow of air into and out of the device may be evenly distributed over the length of the device, as the entire length or nearly the entire length of the device may be occupied by impellers.<br>
30 The motor may be provided at one end of the first impeller, and the coupling may be provided at an end of the impeller which is opposite to the end to which the motor is connected. Thus, a driving force is applied to the first impeller at one end thereof, the driving force being transmitted from the first impeller to the second impeller at the opposite end of the first impeller. The coupling may be made so that it comprises one or<br>
35  more parts which engages the outer periphery of the first and/or second impeller and<br><br>
which transmits a driving force from the first impeller to the second impeller. Additionally or alternatively, the coupling may comprise a shaft interconnecting the first and the second impeller, or it may comprise a friction coupling such as, e.g. a coupling wherein a disc at one end of the first impeller is in forced frictional engagement with another disc at 5  an end of the second impeller, or a coupling wherein the two impellers have parts which are in forced mutual engagement by electromagnetic forces.<br>
As described above in connection with the device according to the first aspect of the invention, the coupling may comprise a collar member having a collar portion into which 10  an end portion of a first impeller is fitted. The collar member may be mounted on one end of a shaft extending through a bearing, and a further collar member may be provided at the other end of the shaft, which further collar member is in engagement with a second impeller, so as to transmit rotation from one impeller to another.<br>
15 At least one holding member may be provided at each end of each of the impellers for holding the impellers. The device may further com prise a cover for covering the'holding members and the impellers, the cover having openings formed therein, so as to allow a flow of air into and out of the impellers. It should be understood that any and all features, parts, characteristics and functionalities<br>
20 described above in connection with the device of the first aspect of the invention may also be incorporated in the device according to the second aspect of the invention.<br>
In a third aspect, the invention relates to a method of operating a ventilating device according to the invention and having or being mounted to a heating or cooling pipe, the<br>
25  method comprising counteracting heat transmission due to natural convention by operating the impellers in such a way as to achieve convection opposite to the natural convection. Such a method may applied in case no heat transmission is desired. As natural convection is usually conferred by the pipe containing the heating or the cooling fluid, a certain amount of heat is transmitted due to natural convection, i.e. convection not<br>
30 conferred by a flow of air emerging from the impellers. Such natural convection may be counteracted or eliminated by operating the impellers so as to achieve convection opposite to the natural convection.<br>
In ail aspects of the present invention, the impellers may be electronically controlled and 35  operationally connected, e.g., to a thermometer. The rotational speed of the impellers may<br><br>
be controlled in a discrete or a continuous way. The control system for controlling the rotational speed of the impellers may be a commercially available system known perse, such as a pulse wide modulating (pwm) control system.<br>
5  In a further aspect, the invention relates to a building comprising a plurality of rooms and at least one ventilating device according to the first aspect of the invention, and optionally at least on pipe containing a heating or cooling fluid, wherein the pipe extends between at least two rooms. Preferably, a motor and a thermostat is provided in each room, each thermostat being adapted to control the speed of rotation of the associated motor, so as to 10  individually control the temperature in each of the rooms. The cover may be interrupted at the transition at a wall or a horizontal division between two rooms.<br>
The pipe may extend between two rooms at the same level, or it may extend in an upright direction, e.g., between two rooms at two different levels. Likewise, one motor may drive a 15  plurality of impellers in a plurality or rooms, whereby the impellers in the two or more rooms are interconnected by means of the coupling mentioned above in connection with the first and second aspects of the invention.<br>
A beneficial effect of the device and the building according to the invention is that no 20 valves for controlling a flow of heating or cooling fluid is necessary. This reduces flow resistance in the pipes, thereby reducing the amount of power needed for conveying the fluid through the pipe or pipes. Moreover, no independent control of the flow of the heating or cooling fluid to different rooms of the building is necessary.<br>
25  In case the device is used as a cooling device, the pipe containing the cooling fluid may extend 2-10 meters into the ground, thereby conferring a temperature of the cooling fluid, e.g., water, of approximately 10-12°C.<br>
The invention further relates to a mounting member for holding at least one pipe in a fixed 30 position, the pipe extending in a longitudinal direction, and the mounting member being adapted to fix the pipe in a transverse direction in relation to the mounting member and to releasably fix the pipe in relation to the mounting member. The mounting member has an open face through which the pipe can be inserted into the mounting member in the transverse direction by relative movement between the mounting member and the pipe. 35 The mounting member may be adapted to hold at least two pipes in a fixed position.<br><br>
When mounted in the mounting member the two pipes may be arranged along a straight line extending in the transverse direction, the mounting member preferably having an open face at one end of the straight line through which the pipes may be inserted into the mounting member. 5<br>
The mounting member may be adapted to be brought into engagement with the pipe or pipes by clipping. The mounting member may further be adapted to hold an impeller in fixed relation to the pipe or pipes, e.g. a bore extending through the mounting member for holding the impeller. The mounting member may be comprised in a ventilating device 10  according to the first and second aspect of the invention.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention relates to a building comprising:<br>
-	at least two rooms,<br>
-	a heating or cooling pipe extending from a first one of the rooms to a second one of 15        the rooms,<br><br>
