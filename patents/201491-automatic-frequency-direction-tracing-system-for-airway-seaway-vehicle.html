				<td>This invention is related to frequency trace mover which can be used in sea route and airline vehicles. This is a new invention in which a antenna (yogi) is used. The rotating antenna with normal speed receives frequency from a particular direction from o to 360 degrees and this power is fed to the magnetic needle through proper arrangements. The arrangements are explained in detail. The power to the needle depends upon the power from the frequency trace mover settings. A ruder connected to the vehicle will turn towards the direction of the needle of the compass and allows the machine to move in the required direction.

Field of Invention<br>
This invention is about Automatic Frequency Direction Tracing System for Airway, Seaway Vehicle which can be used for Airline and Sea route, training vehicles.<br>
Steering is an important one to drive a vehicle, As it is known it is used in changing the direction of the vehicle. The change in direction of the vehicle is done by applying a force to the steering in the clockwise or in the anticlockwise directions. In this invention Automatic Frequency Direction Tracing System for Airway, Seaway Vehicle ,the force required to change the direction of the vehicle is generated by the needle of a compass. The antenna gets the required force from the magnetic needle of the particular compass. The magnetic needle of the compass always pointing to the north and the south poles. The compass can be rotated in any direction starting from 0^ to 360^. The north pole of the needle always pointing to the north direction and south pole of the needle always pointing to the south direction. Automatic Frequency Direction Tracing System for Airway, Seaway Vehicle changes its direction by using a magnetic energy, which is generated during the movement of the compass needle. This system attached to the vehicle works with the help of a Ruder. If it is fited in a moving machine(say a boat) , it will change its direction automatically as it is tumed by the frequency generator with the help of the RT amplifier. The compass must be kept stable in the boat or the vehicle. While fitting the compass on the vehicle, the north pole of the, needle should point to the north direction and also the vehicle (eg. boat) should face the north direction. The working of the system is as follows. The circuits for the Light Depending Resistance (LDR) is fixed in the box present at the base of the compass. The input and output units are connected at the outside of the compass. Inside the compass, 360 LDRs are connected in a circular fashion, with 2 cm height and 1 mm width. For each LDR separate connections are available in a disc. Two laser guns are fixed on both sides of the magnetic needle. The north pole of the needle Vi has the Qi laser gun. The south pole of the nelde V2 has the Q2 laser gun. The Q2 laser gun helps in controlling the weight of the Q\ laser gun. The diameter of the<br>
Nowadays, all the self-operating vehicles are having the capability to operate only in a particular direction starting fi-om zero degree. Since Automatic Frequency Direction Tracing System for Airway, Seaway Vehicle are functioning with the help of the<br><br>
compass, they have the capability of changing the direction automatically, to a distance to where the gravitational force is felt. Since it functions from 0° - 360°, it has the capability of attending particular target according to the frequency generated by the antenna. It can function in sea route as well as in airline. If this system is fixed in a boat or aircraft, the direction of motion of the vehicle can be controlled from 0 degree to 360 degree according to the requirements.<br>

Background of invention<br>
All the vehicles have a steering to turn the direction. When driving road vehicles, the identification of the direction is not at all a problem. But in the case of air and water vehicles, identification of direction is one of the major problems. Here, sea vehicle, a boat is considered for reference. It is easy to identify the direction with the help of an antenna. The needle of the compass stands always in the north-south direction. This typical characteristic of the needle of the compass, is used in the automatic Automatic Frequency Direction Tracing System for Airway, Seaway Vehicle to change the direction of the boat. Brief Description of Drawing Fig.l<br>
Part: A<br>
Rotateable Yagi- uda Antenna:<br>
It is a very compact one. It has a unidirectional radiation pattern. This antenna is usually a folded type dipole. It consists of a single reflector, and several director elements. Director 1 acts as a driver element for director 2 and so on. The gain is improved considerably by adding a number of such directors. This is a conductor which intercepts, the electro magnetic waves. Hence a voltage is induced in the antenna. The induced voltage is given to the receiver through a feeder wire. A frequency turning circuit is placed at the input of the receiver.<br><br>
This frequency turning circuit selects the desired carrier frequency. That is it responds only to the voltage at which it is turned, and rejects all the other frequencies. The voltage picked up is given to the RF amplifier.<br>
This antenna is rotating continuously in the clockwise direction. It is rotating with the normal speed.<br>
Part:B<br>
RF Amplifier:<br>
It is a tuned amplifier. It amplifies the input RF signal. Its output is given to the mixer<br>
unit.<br>
Part: C<br>
Sound Detector:<br>
Output of last IF stage is fed to the second detector which is a linear diode detector. The detector demodulates the IF signal. Hence the output of the detector stage gives the original modulated frequency. For satisfactory operation the voltage fed to the detector be atleast Iv. Hence the preceding amplifier stages are carefully designed.<br>
Part: D<br>
Relay driver<br>
When the signal is received from the detector stage, it activates the base terminal of Q3. So it is in conduction state, the collector terminal goes to 0 volts. At this time the next transistor Q4 is in cutoff state and the relay is not energized (OFF).<br>
Suppose the signal is not received by detector stage, the collector terminal of Q3 is positive voltage and it is transferred to the transistor Q4, and it energizes the relay and changes the switching contacts. The diode Dl protect the transistor Q4 from reverse bias current.<br>
Here the relay is an electromagnetic type. That is it will change the switching contacts when the supply voltage is applied between the coils .<br><br>
Part:E<br>
There are 360 relays are connected to the corresponding 360 LDRs. The power to these relays and the LDRs coming from the corresponding strips in the plastic disc. (Part H)<br>
Relay<br>
Magnetic relay has three terminals. They are common (COM), normally closed (N/C) and normally open (N/O). When the relay is not energized means, the common and N/C are in contact and N/O is in the open circuit condition. If the coil is energized means the contact will be changed to n/o and common. Part:?<br>
Inside the compass at a height of 2 cm, totally 360 LDRs are arranged circularly at the ratio of ILDR per degree. The LDRs at the layer operate only for Qi laser Guns in the compass needle. All the 360 LDRs from 1^ are connected to the power supply, which activate the stepper motor. Hence all the 360 LDRs in Part P do the job of turning the boat in the required direction with the help of the stepper motor. The LDRs in the required angles can be made ON or OFF, to do this, each LDR has a separate connector these are available in Part H. Part Q:<br>
The north pole of the magnetic needle will stand always in the north direction. The laser gun, which is fixed on the magnetic needle, will rotate explicitly along the needle and functions the LDRs which is placed in a circular fashion. The LDR activates the motor and changes the direction of the boat. There are two Laser Guns (Qi &amp; Q2) fixed in the magnetic needle. These Laser Guns are emitting laser beam with the help of Mercury Batteries. The laser Gun Qi is fixed on the North Pole Needle, The Laser Gun Q2 is fixed in the south pole needle. The V2 needle does not have any specific functions. It is fixed to the balance the wight of the needle.<br>
Part: R<br>
The LDR circuit it is used to give the correct polarity to the stepper motor at the current time.<br>
Part: S<br>
The Stepper operator is used to give the power supply to the stepper motor which is indicated in Part R.<br><br>
Part T :-<br>
It is a stepper motor, which rotates in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions. The power required to operate it is obtained from part 'R'. The pulley of the stepper motor attached to the flat gear gets ejected from the flat gear when the power cut occurs. The important task to turn the ruder is carried out by this stepper motor. So, it works only for a particular instant of time and turns the boat. It pushes the flat gear attached to it in the forward or backward directions. It is pushed only for a particular distance and caught hold by the flat gear at the same position till the power cut occurs. So the ruder attached to it is turned a little and stopped in the same position. But the boat running on the water keeps on turning. The compass is turned at this time, but the needle Vi stands pointing to the north direction. Due to the LDRs kept ON at T' start working. While the compass turns, the LDR kept OFF at the particular degree in the compass cuts OFF the power to the stepper motor. As soon as the Qi laser beam from Vi arrives straight to this LDR and so the stepper motor gets ejected of from the flat gear. So the boat moves towards the same direction in which it was turned previously.<br>
Fig 2<br>
Relay Circuit<br>
The Relay circuit is used to give power to the power supply. The relay circuit is shown in Part A.<br>
Fig, 3 Part F:<br>
It is a long steel rod. Antenna is fixed at the top of the rod, as shown in sections B to<br>
E in fig 1. A rod "g" is fitted in the lower side of the Antenna. It rotates itself as the Antenna<br>
rotates. The pulley fitted with lower side of the Antenna is inside the Gear box. Since the gear<br>
box is fitted with the motor, as the motor rotates the Antenna also rotates.<br>
PartG:<br>
This is a horizontal plastic rod. Three steel brushes are fitted with the horizontal plastic rod, which is in Part G. Each brush is connected to a relay (E) separately. The brush gives the power to the relay compass by copper plates. Plates are connected with the plastic disc.<br><br>
Part H: Copper strips<br>
Copper strips are fitted in the rim of the plastic disc. Totally 360 copper strips are available. Each strip is interconnected. That is Each strip is connected to the individual LDRs through the 360 relays. The power obtained from the N/C power form relay reaches through the brush of G to the W part of the compass. Individual strips (360) are cormected to the 360 LDRs. Parti:<br>
It is a plastic disc. The antenna is capable of rotating freely at the center of the disc. The copper rings K, J and H - 360 pieces of copper plates are fitted in the plastic disc. A clamp is fitted in the chise for immovable stability. Part J:<br>

PartK:<br>
It is the first ring made up of copper plate. The power (N/0) getting form the relay by the first brush gives to Y of the compass and line of Pi LDR.<br>
PartL:<br>
It is a gearbox placed at the lower side of the Antenna. It is used to rotate the Antenna with enough speed.<br>
PartM:<br>
It's a motor to rotate the Antenna. It is fitted with the gearbox.<br>
PartN:<br>
It is a clamp, which is used to hold the plastic disc. Fig 4:<br>
The compass is constructed within the open able glass box. Its magnetic needle rotates in its central portion as axis. Two laser Guns are fixed in the two sides of the magnetic needle. It emits laser beams with the help of Mercury batteries. The Laser Guns present in the North side (Qi) is fixed just lower than the south side. The outer wall of the compass is made of fiber.  Inside this, 360 LDRs are arranged in a circular fashion with ILDR for each<br><br>
degree (360 x 4 = 360 LDRs).   These LDRs (C) are arranged in such a way that the laser beam from the north side of the needle exactly falls on them. Fig 5 :-Part: V<br>
The important part in the compass is the needle (V). The needle is kept above the compass, so it can rotate freely. In this, the part, which is facing the North Pole is called Vi and the part, which is facing the South Pole, is called V2.<br>
Part Pi :-<br>
To operate the boat correctly in a particular direction, initially the the North pole is set. As the LDR 1 at 1 ° in part P remains ON, initially the boat moves first towards the north direction. The boat moves in the same north direction in which it was moving. The power supply section will operate the part p according to the relay value setup.. Hence the LDRs from 1° to P2 of part T' are operated and the needle of the compass is turned to the left side. Since the P2 activates the motor, the boat is accurately turned to the right.<br>
PartV2<br>
The V2 laser gun does not have any specific function. It is fixed to balance the needle and also for the rotation of the needle<br>
Part W,X and Y:-<br>
These are the input pins used to give power to the Relay, kept at the inner portion of the compass. Each LDR has separate pin connections. That is not shown in the fig.5. Only three such pins are shown in fig 5.<br>
PartZ:<br>
It is the output terminal from the compass given to the stepper motor.<br>
Fig: 6<br>
PartU:<br>
It is called a flat gear. The flat gear is arranged to move easily through the clamps either forward and backward. The stepper motor is attached over this. A ruder is attached to the flat gear. The flat gear is moving forward and backward according to the direction of rotation of the stepper motor and hence turns the ruder attached with it is moving right or left.<br><br>
PartO:<br>
It is the clamp used to fix the flat gear constantly or to move it forward and backward smoothly.<br>
Part Ui :<br>
Ruder is used to turn the direction of motion of seaway and airway vehicles. The top view of this is a long cone shape. Bottom of which is capable of rotating with respect to the axis. The edge of the ruder is connected with the flat gear using a rod. While the flat gear moves forward and backward the ruder will turn towards right or left. It is shown in the fig.6<br>
Part U2:<br>
U2 is the axis of the ruder. Ruder is turning left to right with respect to this.<br>
Detailed Description of Drawing<br>
FIG:1<br>
PartP:<br>
Light Depending Resistance (LDR)<br>
Inside the compass at a height of 2 cm, totally 360 LDRs are arranged circularly at the ratio of ILDR per degree. The LDRs at the first layer operates only for Qi laser Gun arranged in the compass needle. Each LDR is numbered in order by which they are arranged from the left of the compass. All the 360 LDRs from 1*^ are connected to the power supply, which activates the stepper motor. Hence all the 360 LDRs in Part P do the job of turning the boat in the required direction with the help of the stepper motor. The LDRs in the required angles can be made ON or OFF, using the individual switches available in Part H. Part S (Stepper Operator Circuit):<br>
Stepper operater is used to give the power supply to the stepper motor according to the direction indicated from part R.<br>
PartT (Stepper Motor) :<br>
This stepper motor is working according to the power supply from part S. A flat gear is connected with the Pulley of the stepper motor.<br><br>
Fig 4 :-<br>
It is used to find the direction of the compass. This compass is mostly used in water and air transport vehicles. Generally a magnetic needle is placed in the center of the openable glass box and the walls of the box is made of fiber. The magnetic needle will rotate with respect to its axis.<br>
The compass is constructed within the glass box. The walls of the box is made of fiber. The magnetic needle rotates with respect to its axis. Two laser Guns are fixed at the two sides of the magnetic needle. Only Vi laser can fianction. It emits laser beams with the help of Mercury batteries Inside the compass, 360 LDRs are arranged in a circular fashion with ILDR for each degree (360 x 1 = 360 LDRs). These LDRs (P) are arranged in such a way that the laser beam from the north side of the needle falls on them. The Laser Guns are arranged in such a way that the beam falls clearly on only one LDR at a time.<br>
Part Pi 1st LDR<br>
To operate the boat correctly in a particular direction, initially the North Pole of the compass is setup. As the LDR 1 at 1° in part P remains on initially (the LDR at north side of compass), the boat moves first towards north direction. (We can also set the boat to move in some other direction first). Part P2 LDR<br>
The power supply section will operate the part P according to the disc (H) value setup first. Hence the LDRs from 1° to P2 of part T' are operated the compass is turned to the right side. Since the LDR Pi at P2 activates the motor, the boat is accurately turned to the right. Then as the LDR P2 is kept off, the needle stops at this point Vi.<br>
Part W,X and Y :-<br>
These are the input pins used to give power to the individual kept at the irmer portion of the compass. Fig 5: PartV: Magnetic Needle<br><br>
The important part of the compass is the needle (P). This needle is made up otTight weightea magnetic plate. The needle is kept above the compass, so it can rotate freely. In this, the part, which facing the North Pole is called Vi and the part, which facing the South Pole, is called V2. The V2 laser gun does not have any specific function. It is fixed only to balance (weight) the needle.<br>
PartQ: Laser<br>
The north pole of the magnetic needle will stand always in north direction. The laser Gun, which is fixed on the magnetic needle, will rotate explicitly along the needle and activate the LDRs placed in a circular fashion. The LDR activates the motor and changes the direction of the boat. There are two Laser Guns (Qi &amp; Q2) fixed in their magnetic needle. These Laser Guns are emitting laser beam with the help of two Batteries. The laser beam generated from the laser gun is exactly focused on to the corresponding LDRs present in the compass. The LDR's are connected to a stepper motor.<br>
The laser Gim Q2 is fixed on the South Pole The V2 laser gun does not have any specific<br>
function.  It is fixed only to balance the weight of the needle and also for the rotation of the<br>
needle.<br>
Part P (LDR):<br>
Inside the compass in which the Light Dependent Resistance (LDR) are arranged in a circular fashion. There are 360 LDRs in one circle with 1 LDR per degree are arranged. These LDRs are used to change the direction of the boat.<br>
Part Qi (Laser Emitting Gun):<br>
The laser Gun is fixed in the needle. This Gun is getting power from the Mercury cell. The laser beam from this Gun is exactly focused to fall on the particular LDR in the compass.<br>
Part G :-<br>
This is a stepper motor, which rotates in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions. The power required to operate it is obtained from part 'P' which is shown in fig 5. The gear attached to the pulley of this motor moves over the flat gear only for the particular time interval and gets ejected from the flat gear when the power cut occurs. The important task is<br><br>
to turn to the ruder and it is carried out by the stepper motor. It pushes the flat gear attached to it in the forward or backward direction. It is pushed only for a particular distance and caught hold by the flat gear at the same position till the power cut occurs. But the ruder attached to it is turned a little and stopped in the same position. So the boat running on the water keeps on turning upto a desired direction. The compass alone turns at this time, but still the needle Vi stands pointing to the north direction. Because of this the LDRs kept ON at T' start working. While the compass turns, the LDR kept OFF at the particular degree of Pa in the compass cuts OFF the power to the stepper motor. As soon as the Q\ laser beam from Vi arrives straight to this LDR the stepper motor gets ejected. So the boat moves towards the direction to which it was turned previously.<br>
Fig 6<br>
PartU:<br>
It is called a flat gear. The flat gear is arranged to move easily through the clamps either forward or backward. The stepper motor is attached to the flat gear. At one end of the flat gear, proper arrangements are made to attach the ruder. According to the direction of rotation of the stepper motor over, the flat gear, which is moving in the forward and backward and directions, so also the ruder attached with it will turn to the right or left respectively.<br>
PartZ:<br>
It is the output terminal from the compass given to the stepper motor.<br>
Part O:<br>
It is the clamp used to gently hold the flat gear constantly or to allow it to move in the forward and backward directions smoothly.<br>
Part Ui:<br>
Ruder is used to turn the direction of motion of seaway and airway vehicles. The top view of this is a long cone shaped one. Bottom of which is capable of rotating with respect to the fixed axis. The edge of the ruder is connected with the flat gear using a rod which acts as the axis for rotation. While the flat gear moves forward and backward the ruder will also turn towards right or left. It is shown in the fig.6<br>
Part U2 :U2 is the axis of the ruder. Ruder will be turning left or right with respect to this.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the Automatic Frequency Direction Tracing System for Airway ,Seaway Vehicle the force to change the direction is given by the compass. The force obtained here is generated from the magnetic needle of the compass. Inner and lower to the compass at a height of 2 CM , totally 360 LDRs are arranged circularly at the ratio of 1 LDR per degree.<br>
The frequency generated from which direction the corresponding side Light Depending Resistance works with the current from the frequency. The magnetic needle in the compass is capable of constantly pointing to the North Pole and South Pole.<br>
The compass has to be fixed constantly in the machine using Automatic Frequency Direction Tracing System for Airway ,Seaway Vehicle. While fixing, the front tip of the device must be pointing north (i.e.) parallel to the magnetic needle and receive the signal and move the signal to the area from which it is generated.<br>
The LDR present inside the compass helps to function the stepper motor thereby helps the compass to rotate. The needle constantly helps to rotate the compass. The boat rotate with respective to the rotation of the compass. The circuits to maintain proper functioning of the Light Depending Resistance (LDR) are placed in the box below the compass. The input and output power pins are attached to the outside of the compass. At the inner portion of the compass totally 360 LDR are arranged circularly at ratio 1 LDR per degree.<br>
The compass has an openable glass box. The walls of the box are made up of fiber. The magnetic needle uses its central portion as axis for rotation. Laser Guns are fixed on both side of magnetic needle. At its inner portion 360 LDRs are arranged circularly (P) at the ratio of ILDR per degree such that the Laser beam from Qi exactly falls on them.<br>
The North portion of the magnetic needle will keep constantly facing north. The Laser Gun arranged here will operate the LDRs arranged circularly by rotating outwardly from the needle.<br><br>
The 360 LDRs arranged at the ratio of 1 LDR per degree at the layer at 2 cm height and 1 mm width at the inner portion of the compass will operate only for the Laser beam from Qi Laser Gun. Each LDR is numbered in order how they are arranged from the left of the compass. All the 360 LDRs from 1° are connected to the power supply of the stepper motor. All the LDRs are connected in series. The power which is obtained from any angle of the disc is fed to the corresponding LDR and is used to tum the boat with the help of stepper motor<br>
Initially the boat is directed towards the predefined direction. When the antenna rotating above the boat receives certain frequency, the first LDR at Pi inside the compass receives the signal to generate the power. The LDRs before the required degree must be kept ON and the remaining LDRs must be kept OFF. When the laser beam comes towards the remaining LDRs which are kept OFF, the power supply to the stepper motor is stopped and so the stepper motor is get ejected from the fait gear. Due to this the boat remained untumed and moves in the same direction in which it was previously turned.<br>
Initially the North Pole of the compass is set to operate the boat in a particular direction. As the LDR at 1° of part P (LDR at north side of the compass) remains ON initially, the boat moves first in the north direction. (We can also set the Boat to move in some other direction). The power obtained by the rotating antenna is received by the LDR at the P2 position of the compass through the relay. Hence the power received the LDR at the position Pi of the compass is stopped. Now the laser beam from the laser gun falls on the P2 LDR and it is started working. That is the LDR is activating the stepper motor. The stepper motor hear moves on the moving flat gear. Then the ruder connected to the flat gear tums. So the boat also turn's towards the angle from the position Pi to P2. As the boat tums the compass attached to the boat also rotating and the needle points upto P2. Since the power is not obtained by the LDR which is next to P2 the boat moves in the same direction of P2 of the compass. Then the boat moves in the direction from which angle the power gain is obtained.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
