				<td>A SEGMENTAL RETAINING WALL AND A WALL BLOCK AND A SOIL<br>
REINFORCEMENT BAR THEREFOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to earth retaining walls. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to a segmental retaining wall comprising retaining means for attaching<br>
reinforcement members to the retaining wall, and also to a wall block and a soil 5<br>
reinforcement member retainer bar therefor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Segmental retaining walls commonly comprise courses of modular units (blocks).<br>
The blocks are typically made of concrete. The blocks are typically dry- stacked (no mortar or grout<br>
is used), and often include one or more features adapted to properly locate adjacent 10 blocks and/or<br>
courses with respect to one another, and to provide resistance to shear forces from course to course.<br>
The weight of the blocks is typically in the range often to one hundred fifty pounds per unit. Segmental<br>
retaining walls commonly are used for architectural and site development applications. Such walls<br>
are subjected to high loads exerted by the soil behind the walls. These loads are affected by,<br>
among other things, the character of the soil, the 15 presence of water, temperature and<br>
shrinkage effects and seismic loads. To handle the loads, segmental retaining wall systems<br>
often comprise one or more layers of soil reinforcement material extending from between the<br>
courses of blocks back into the soil behind the blocks. The reinforcement material is typically<br>
in the form of a geogrid or a geofabric. Geogrids often are configured in a lattice arrangement and<br>
are constructed of 20 polymer fibers or processed plastic sheet material (punched and<br>
stretched, such as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,374,798), while reinforcement<br>
fabrics are constructed of woven, nonwoven, or knitted polymer fibers or plastics. These<br>
reinforcement members typically extend rearwardly from the wall and into the soil to stabilize the<br>
soil against movement and thereby create a more stable soil mass which results in a 25<br>
more structurally secure retaining wall. In other instances, the reinforcement<br>
members comprise tie-back rods that are secured to the wall and which<br>
similarly extend back into the soil.<br>
Although several different forms of reinforcement members have been<br>
developed, opportunities for improvement remain with respect to attachment of the<br>
reinforcement members to the facing blocks in the retaining wall systems. As a<br>
general proposition, the more efficient the block/grid connection, the fewer the layers<br>
of grid that should be required in the wall system. The cost of reinforcing grid can be<br>
a significant portion of the cost of the wall system, so highly efficient block/grid<br>
connections are desirable.<br>
Many segmental retaining wall systems rely primarily upon frictional forces to<br>
hold the reinforcement material between adjacent courses of block. These systems<br>
may also include locating pins or integral locator/shear resistance features that<br>
enhance the block/grid connection to varying degrees. Examples of such systems<br>
include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4.914.876, 5,709,062. and 5.827.015.<br>
These systems cannot take advantage of the full tensile strength of the common<br>
reinforcement materials, however, because the block/grid holding forces that can be<br>
generated in these systems is typically less than the tensile forces that the reinforcing<br>
materials themselves can withstand.<br>
One of the many advantages of segmental retaining wall systems over other<br>
types of retaining walls is their flexibility. They do not generally require elaborate<br>
foundations, and they can perform well in situations where there is differential settling<br>
of the earth, or frost heaving, for example, occurs. Even so. these types of conditions<br>
might result in differentials in the block/grid connections across the wall in systems<br>
that rely primarily on fricitional connection of blocks to grid.<br>
In an effort to improve the grid/block connection efficiency, several current<br>
retaining wall systems have been developed that mechanically connect the<br>
reinforcement members to the blocks. In several such systems, rake shaped connector<br>
bars are positioned transversely in the center of the contact area between adjacent<br>
stacked blocks with the prongs of the connector bars extending through elongated<br>
apertures provided in the geogrid to retain it in place. Examples of this type of system<br>
are shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,607,262 (FIGS. 1-7), 5,417,523, and 5,540.525.<br>
These systems are only effective if the geogrid used is of a construction such that the<br>
cross-members that engage the prongs of the connector will resist the tensile forces<br>
exerted on the grid by the soil. There are only a few such grids currently available<br>
and, thus, the wall builder or contractor has to select geogrid products from a limited<br>
number of reinforcement member manufacturers when such an attachment system is<br>
used. These systems also rely upon the prongs of the rake connectors being in register<br>
with the apertures in the grid material and in contact with the grid cross members. If<br>
the connector prongs do not line up with the grid apertures, installation becomes a<br>
problem. Variability in the grid manufacturing process means that the apertures in this<br>
type of grid frequently are not perfectly regular. A solution to this problem has been<br>
to use short connector rakes that only engage several grid apertures, rather than long<br>
connectors that engage all of the apertures in a row across the grid layer. This<br>
solution eases installation problems, but would appear to make the connection<br>
mechanism less efficient, with the consequence that the full strength of the grid<br>
cannot be taken advantage of in the design of the wall system. These devices are<br>
subject to the same criticisms as the pure friction connector systems.<br>
A third type of connector system uses a channel that, in cross-section, has a<br>
relatively large inner portion and a very narrow opening out of that portion. The grid<br>
is provided with a bead or equivalent enlargement along its leading edge. The grid is<br>
then threaded into the channel from the side, so that the grid layer extends out through<br>
the narrow channel opening, but the bead is captured in the larger inner portion. An<br>
example of this type of connection is shown in FIGS. 9-10 of U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,607,262. While this system overcomes differential settling concerns, it is very<br>
difficult to use in the field, and relies upon special grid configurations.<br>
A modification of the third type of connector system described above is one in<br>
which the channel into which the bead fits is formed by a combination of the lower<br>
and adjacent upper block, so that the enlarged/beaded end of the grid can simply be<br>
laid in the partial channel of the lower blocks, and will be captured when the upper<br>
blocks are laid. This system simplifies installation, but does not resolve the<br>
aforementioned performance concerns. In a variation of this system, the end of a<br>
panel of geogrid material is wrapped around a bar, which is then placed in a<br>
hollowed-out portion of the facing unit which is provided with an integral stop to<br>
resist pullout of the bar. Rather than being held in place by the next above facing<br>
unit, the wrapped bar is then weighted down with earth or gravel fill dumped on top<br>
of it in the hollowed out portion of the facing unit. This system is shown in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,066,169. Not only is the facing unit of this system extremely complex and difficult to make,<br>
but the installation process is difficult and requires the use of very narrow panels of grid<br>
material.<br>
From the above, it can be appreciated that it would be desirable to have a segmental<br>
retaining wall system comprising a facing block of a relatively simple shape to facilitate high<br>
speed mass production, and wherein the block can be mechanically connected to the<br>
reinforcement material in a fashion that is highly efficient, so that a higher percentage of the<br>
full design strength of the reinforcement can be taken advantage of, wherein the system can<br>
be used with a wide variety of the commonly available geogrids and fabrics, wherein the<br>
grid/block connection mechanism is secure even i n differential settling conditions, and<br>
wherein the system is easy to work with in the field during installation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring now in more detail to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate<br>
corresponding parts throughout the several views. FIG. 1 illustrates the general concept<br>
of a segmental retaining wall 10 constructed in accordance with the present invention.<br>
As depicted in this figure, the retaining wall 10 comprises a plurality of wall blocks 12<br>
that are stacked atop each other in ascending courses 14. When stacked in this manner,<br>
the wall blocks 12 together form an exterior or decorative surface 15 which faces<br>
outwardly away from the soil, and an interior surface 17 which faces inwardly toward<br>
the soil.<br>
Generally speaking, the standard wall blocks 12 that comprise the majority of<br>
any given wall are substantially identical in size and shape for ease of block fabrication<br>
and wall construction. Accordingly, each block 12 typically is configured so as to mate<br>
with vertically adjacent blocks 12 when the blocks 12 are stacked atop one another to<br>
form the retaining wall 10. Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, each wall block 12 comprises an<br>
exterior face 24, an opposed interior face 26, a top surface 28, a bottom surface 30, and<br>
two opposed sides 32. Because the exterior faces 24 of the blocks 12 form the exterior<br>
surface 15 of the retaining wall 10, the exterior faces 24 typically are provided with an<br>
ornamental texture or facing to create a visually pleasing facade. Also, the exterior face<br>
24 of each wall block 12 is preferably sloped inwardly from the bottom surface 30 to the<br>
top surface 28 in an incline ratio of approximately 30 to 1. This inward slope of each<br>
block exterior surface 15 creates an aggregate inward slope effect over the entire<br>
retaining wall 10 which counteracts the outward leaning impression which can be<br>
created by such walls when viewed by the observer. Contrary to the exterior faces 24,<br>
the interior faces 26 of the wall blocks 12 preferably are configured in an upright or<br>
vertical orientation and, therefore, form an upright, yet stepped (FIG. 8), interior surface<br>
17 of the retaining wall 10.<br>
The top and bottom surfaces 28 and 30 of each block 12 are preferably, but not<br>
necessarily, parallel to each other so that, when stacked on top of one another, an upright<br>
wall 10 is formed. As shown most clearly in FIGS. 2 and 3, a curved edge 33 is<br>
preferably formed at the junction of the top surface 28 and the interior surface 26 to<br>
avoid abrasion of reinforcement members that will be secured to the wall formed by the<br>
blocks 12. Similar to the top and bottom surfaces 28 and 30, the opposed sides 32 are<br>
preferably, but not necessarily, parallel to each other. However, as known in the art, the<br>
opposed sides 32 can be inwardly or outwardly tapered from the exterior face 24 of the<br>
block 12 to the interior face 26 of the block 12 to form curved walls of nearly any shape.<br>
Preferably, the wall blocks 12 further include interior openings 34 which reduce the<br>
amount of concrete or other materials needed to fabricate the blocks 12 and reduce the<br>
weight of the blocks 12 to simplify wall construction. Although depicted in the figures<br>
as being arranged in a horizontal orientation, these openings 34 could be arranged in a<br>
vertical orientation, if desired. In either case, the openings 34 are sized so as to<br>
maximize the strength of the blocks while still permitting space for connecting tie-back<br>
reinforcement members (not shown) to the wall. One tie-back system particularly well-<br>
suited for walls constructed with the inventive blocks 12 is that disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 09/261,420, filed March 3, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference into the present disclosure.<br>
As mentioned above, the wall blocks 12 comprise retaining means for attaching<br>
reinforcement members (e.g.. geogrids) to the retaining wall 10. Preferably, these<br>
retaining means include a channel 16 that is formed in each block 12. Preferably, each<br>
block 12 has a channel 16 provided in its top surface 28 as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3,<br>
although alternative placement is feasible. By way of example, the channel 16<br>
alternatively could be provided in the bottom surface 30 or the interior face 26 of the<br>
wall block 12. When provided in the interior face 26 of the block 12, the channel 16 can<br>
' be arranged either horizontally or vertically therein, although horizontal placement is<br>
preferred. When the channel 16 is provided in the top surface 28 as illustrated in FIGS.<br>
2 and 3, however, the channel 16 preferably extends transversely across the block 12<br>
from one side 32 of the block 12 to the other, usually parallel to the interior surface 26 of<br>
the block 12. As illustrated most clearly in FIG. 4, the channel 16 is defined by a front<br>
wall 36, a rear wall 38, and a bottom surface 40. The front wall 36 preferably includes a<br>
shoulder 42 that extends inwardly toward the interior face 26 of the wall block 12. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the shoulder 42 is defined by two substantially planar surfaces 43<br>
and 44. The first planar surface 43 extends inwardly from the top surface 28 of the block<br>
at an angle of approximately 90°. The second planar surface 44 extends from the first<br>
planar surface 43 at an oblique angle toward the exterior face 24 of the block 12. By<br>
way of example, the second planar surface 44 can extend from the first planar surface 43<br>
at an angle of approximately 45°. Preferably, however, the oblique angle will range<br>
from approximately 20° to approximately 70°.<br>
Positioned opposite the front wall 36. the rear wall 38 of the channel 16<br>
preferably includes an inwardly extending shoulder 45. However, the rear wall shoulder<br>
45 preferably is arranged as a radiused curve so as to form a substantially arcuate edge<br>
46 and an oblique planar portion 47. As shown in FIG. 4, the bottom surface 40 of the<br>
channel 16 can also be formed as a radiused curve. In a preferred embodiment, this<br>
curve comprises a radius of curvature of approximately 2 inches. This curvature<br>
provides room for the flanges 18 of blocks 12 of upper courses during wall construction<br>
and space for a retaining bar (FIG. 7) when a reinforcement member is secured to the<br>
wall. Although the channels 16 have been described herein as being arranged in<br>
specifically defined configurations, it will be apparent from the present disclosure that<br>
these channels 16 could be arranged in alternative configurations. As is discussed<br>
hereinafter, an important consideration is that the channel 16 be appropriately situated<br>
and configured to work in conjunction with a reinforcement retaining bar 22 (described<br>
in more detail hereinafter) to facilitate mechanical clamping of reinforcement members<br>
such as geogrids. with limited opportunity for block failure. A further consideration is<br>
that the channel 16 can be situated and configured to work in conjunction with a mating<br>
flange of a block in an adjacent course to properly locate the courses with respect to each<br>
ather, to provide resistance to shear forces tending to displace the adjacent courses with<br>
respect to each other, and to provide resistance to overturning rotation of the upper block<br>
with respect to the adjacent lower block. Depending upon the particular implements used<br>
to retain the reinforcement members, the placement of the channel 16. and the deeree of<br>
course-to-courseengagement of blocks desired, the walls 36, 38 of the channel 16 can be<br>
formed without shoulders to simplify block construction.<br>
Where a high degree of engagement between blocks in adjacent courses is<br>
desired (particularly to prevent the upper block from rotating or overturning during wall<br>
construction), as in the preferred embodiment, the front wall shoulder 42 is specifically<br>
adapted to receive a flange 18 that extends from substantially each block 12. Most<br>
preferably, the flange 18 is provided on the bottom surface 30 of the block 12 and. like<br>
the channel 16, extends transversely from one side 32 of the block to the other side 32.<br>
As is illustrated in FIG. 5. the flange 18 is defined by a front surface 48, a rear surface<br>
50, and a bottom surface 52. Both the front surface 48 and the rear surface 50 extend<br>
obliquely toward the exterior face 24 of the wall block 12 such that the entire flange 18<br>
extends towards the exterior face 24 of the block. When the front wall 36 of the block<br>
channels 16 comprise first and second planar surfaces 43 and 44 as described<br>
hereinbefore, the front surface 48 of the flange 18 comprises mating first and second<br>
planar surfaces 55 and 57. As with the like named surfaces of the channel 16, these first<br>
and second planar surfaces 55 and 57 are arranged with the first planar surface 55<br>
extending from the block at an angle of approximately 90° while the second planar<br>
surface 57 extends obliquely from the first planar surface 55 at an angle of<br>
approximately 45°. To provide for the engagement between vertically adjacent wall<br>
blocks 12. the blocks 12 can be placed on top of lower wall blocks 12 such that the<br>
flanges 18 extend into the channels 16. Once so situated, the upper wall blocks 12 can<br>
be urged forwardly along the lower blocks 12 so that the front surfaces 48 and, in<br>
particular, the first planar surfaces 43 and 55 and the second planar surfaces 44 and 57<br>
abut each other. This abutment prevents the blocks 12 from rotating forward or<br>
overturning and also provides some resistance to shear forces which may be exerted on<br>
the wall structure. In the presently preferred embodiment, the flange measures about<br>
1.30 inches from its juncture with the block body to its bottom surface 52. and is about<br>
1.48 inches thick in the plane of its juncture with the block body. These dimensions give<br>
adequate strength to the flange.<br>
The relative front-to-back locations of the flange 18 and channel 16 establish the<br>
appropriate location of adjacent courses of block. In the preferred wall structure, the<br>
wall has a batter of about 4 degrees. These translates to a course-to-course setback of<br>
about 1 inch with blocks of the preferred dimensions. The presently preferred<br>
dimensions of the block are about 15 inches from top face to bottom face, about 8 inches<br>
from side to side, and about 12 inches from from to back. The preferred weight is about<br>
75 to 85 pounds. As is known in the art. alternative locating means can be used.<br>
Examples of alternative locating systems include those of U.S. Patent Nos. 4.914.876.<br>
5,257.880,5.607,262, and 5,827,015.<br>
Preferably, the block of the present invention is made from a high strength<br>
concrete block mix. which meets or exceeds the ASTM standard for segmental retaining<br>
wall blocks. ASTM C1372-97, with the additional requirements that the allowable<br>
maximum 24 hour cold water absorption is 7%, and the minimum net area compressive<br>
strength is about 3500 psi. It is preferably made in a standard concrete block, paver, or<br>
concrete products machine, by a process generally described in. for example. U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,827,015, which is incorporated herein by reference. The shape of the blocks of the<br>
present invention are such that they readily can be made with such equipment. They will<br>
preferably be cast on their sides so that the critical channels and flanges are formed by<br>
fixed steel mold parts. When cast on their sides, the blocks are of such a configuration<br>
as to be easily stripped from the molds.<br>
The retaining means of the disclosed system typically further include a<br>
reinforcement member retaining bar 22, shown most clearly in FIG. 6. As indicated in<br>
this figure, the retaining bar 22 is specifically sized and configured to fit within the<br>
channel 16. In a preferred arrangement, the retaining bar 22 has a plurality of different<br>
surfaces: a top surface 54, a bottom surface 56, a front surface 58, and a rear surface 60.<br>
Preferably, the top surface 54 is substantially planar in shape while the bottom surface 56<br>
is arcuate in shape. In particular, the bottom surface 56 is adapted to follow the contours<br>
of the bottom surface 40 of the channel 16. The front surface 58 and the rear surface 60<br>
preferably are planar in shape. Preferably, the front surface 58 extends perpendicularly<br>
downward from the top surface 54 so as to mate with the front wall 36 of the channel 16<br>
and the rear surface 60 extends obliquely from the top surface 54 to likewise mate with<br>
the rear wall 38. The preferred dimensions of the bar are about 0.6 inch thick at its<br>
thickest location, about 0.18 inch at its thinnest location, and about 2 inches from leading<br>
edge to trailing edge. Preferably, the bar is 64 inches long, but shorter lengths may be<br>
required for tight radius curves.<br>
It is presently preferred that the bar has the solid configuration shown in FIG. 6.<br>
However, the bar can have a hollow configuration, such as that shown in FIG. 10. As is<br>
illustrated in this figure, the retaining bar 22' similarly includes top, bottom, front, and<br>
rear surfaces 54'-60', but the interior of the bar 22' includes a plurality of voids 61.<br>
Through provision of such voids 61, both the volume of the materials and weight of the<br>
bar 22' can be reduced.<br>
The retaining bar 22. 22' can be constructed of a polymeric or other material.<br>
The material needs to be such that its long-term performance in the prevailing<br>
environment will be suitable. The presently preferred material for the bar is regrind<br>
CPVC. available from Intek Plastics. Inc. We understand this material to comprise about<br>
80% CPVC, about 10% weatherable PVC, and about 10% rigid PVC. Presently, for the<br>
preferred bar dimensions, we prefer a material that meets or exceeds the following<br>
properties: Young's Modulus = 60,000 psi; Engineering Yield Stress = 2,048,000 psi;<br>
Engineering Strain = 3.41 x 10"2 in/in. Different properties may be appropriate if<br>
different dimensions or materials are used for the bar. As shown in FIG. 7, the retaining<br>
bar 22 can be positioned on top of a reinforcement member 20 in the channel 16 by<br>
inserting the retaining bar 22 into the channel 16 by twisting the bar 22 downwardly into<br>
place within the channel 16. The channel 16 needs to be dimensioned to accept the bar<br>
16, the flange 18, and a layer of reinforcement material. In the presently preferred<br>
embodiment, a dimension of 0.06 inches is assumed for the thickness of the<br>
reinforcementmaterial. This dimension is about that of the thickest geogrids presently<br>
known. If the channel is sized to accommodate reinforcement material of this<br>
dimension, it can then function with a wide range of reinforcing materials.<br>
Once correctly inserted within the channel 16, the retaining bar 22, 22' is<br>
securely held within the channel 16 and, in turn, securely holds the reinforcement<br>
member 20 in place. The retaining bar 22, 22' bears against the rear wall 38 of the<br>
channel and also contacts the bottom surface 52 of the flange 18 of a block situated<br>
above (FIG. 9) when a tensile load is applied to the reinforcement member 20. The<br>
retaining bar 22,22' therefore prevents the reinforcement member 20 from being pulled<br>
out from the retaining wall 10. More specifically, when a tensile force is applied to the<br>
reinforcement member 20 from the soil side of the retaining wall 10, the retaining bar 22.<br>
22' is pulled upwardly in the channel. Contact with the flange inserted into the channel<br>
causes the bar to rotate and move further upwardly and backwardly within the channel<br>
16. clamping the reinforcement member 20 between the retaining bar 22 and the rear<br>
wall of the channel 16.<br>
This clamping system creates a highly efficient connection between block and<br>
grid. In a standard connection test of the type which is well-known to those of skill in<br>
the segmental retaining wall an, the following connection strengths were achieved using<br>
TC Mirafi 5XT geogrid:<br>
The long term design strength of the Mirafi 5XT grid, according to the NCMA<br>
design methodology is 1084 lbs/ft, so it is apparent that the connection strength<br>
generated by the current clamp system is highly efficient.<br>
Testing with TC Mirafi 10XT geogrid (NCMA long term design strength of<br>
2602 lbs/ft) yielded the following results:<br>
The system of the present invention can be used to construct any number of<br>
different configurations of segmentai retaining walls. FIG. 8 illustrates another example<br>
of such a retaining wall 66. To construct such a wail 66, a leveling pad 68 is normally<br>
laid to provide a foundation upon which to build the wall 66. Typically, this leveling<br>
pad 68 comprises a layer of compacted, crushed stone that is embedded under the soil to<br>
protect the wall foundation. Once the leveling pad 68 is laid and compacted, a plurality<br>
of foundation blocks 70 are aligned along the length of the pad 68. Preferably, each of<br>
the foundation blocks 70 is solid and provided with a channel 16 in its top surface. Since<br>
there are no lower courses with which to engage, the foundation blocks 70 are normally<br>
not provided with flanges. Additionally, as depicted in the figure, the foundation blocks<br>
70 can be relatively short in height, for example, approximately half as tall as the<br>
standard wall blocks 12 that comprise the majority of the wall 66. Although such<br>
foundation blocks 70 typically are used in the first course of the retaining wall 66. it is to<br>
be noted that the standard wall blocks 12 could be used to form this course, if desired.<br>
After the first, or foundation, course has been formed with either the foundation<br>
blocks 70 or wall blocks 12. the next course of blocks 12 can be laid. The wall blocks 12<br>
are placed on top of the blocks 70 of the foundation course with the flanges 18. if<br>
provided, extending into the channels 16 of the lower blocks 70. As can be appreciated<br>
from FIG. 8, and with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5, the from surfaces 48 of the flanges 18<br>
mate with the front wall shoulders 42 of the channels 16 such that each flange 18 extends<br>
underneath the shoulders 42. This mating relationship holds the wall block 12 in place<br>
atop the lower blocks 70 and prevents the wall blocks 12 from tipping forward, thereby<br>
providing integral locking means for the blocks 12.<br>
Once the first normal wall course has been formed atop the foundation course,<br>
backfill soil. S. can be placed behind the blocks 12. Typically, a non-woven filter fabric<br>
72 is provided between the wail 66 and the backfill soil to prevent the introduction of<br>
paniculate matter between the courses of blocks 12 due to water migration within the<br>
soil. Alternatively, a layer of gravel aggregate can be provided between the wail and the<br>
soil to serve the same function. Additional ascending courses thereafter are laid in the<br>
manner described above. Although alternative configurations are possible, a<br>
reinforcement member 20 typically is laid between every other course of blocks 12 as<br>
indicated in FIG. 8. It will be appreciated, however, that greater or fewer reinforcement<br>
members 20 can be provided depending upon the particular reinforcement needs of the<br>
construction site. Preferably, these reinforcement members 20 are composed of a<br>
flexible polymeric materials. As described above, the reinforcement members 20 are<br>
positioned so that they extend from the exterior surface 15 of the retaining wail 66. into<br>
the channel 16, and past the interior surface 17 of the retaining wall 66 to extend into the<br>
soil. As shown most clearly in FIG. 9, a reinforcement member retaining bar 22 is<br>
placed on top of the reinforcement member 20 in the channel 16. When the next course<br>
of blocks 12 is laid, the flanges 18 of the upper blocks 12 extend into the channels 16 in<br>
which the retaining bar 22 is disposed.<br>
Construction of the retaining wall 66 continues in this manner until the desired<br>
height is attained. As indicated in FIG. 8, the setback of the wall blocks 12 creates a net<br>
inward setback appearance of the retaining wall 66. Additionally, the configuration the<br>
blocks 12 creates an aesthetically pleasing stepped appearance for the exterior surface of<br>
the wall 66. Where the full height of a wall block 12 is unnecessary or not desired, short<br>
wall blocks 74 can be used to form the top or other course. Preferably, these short wall<br>
blocks 74 are solid and approximately half the height of the standard wall blocks 12.<br>
Once the retaining wall 66 has been raised to the desired height, cap blocks 76 can be<br>
used to complete the wall 66. As shown in FIG. 8, these cap blocks 76 can be provided<br>
with a flange 18. but do not have an upper channel in that further construction will not be<br>
conducted. The cap blocks 76 can be fixed in position with concrete adhesive and<br>
provided with an ornamental pattern similar to the exterior faces of the blocks 12. if<br>
desired. By way of example, the cap blocks 76 can be designed to extend out over their<br>
subjacent blocks 74 to provide an aesthetic lip as illustrated in FIG. 8. Additionally, a<br>
subsurface collector drain 78 can be provided within the backfill soil to remove excess<br>
water collected therein.<br>
FIGS. 11-17 depict an alternative wall block 100 constructed in accordance with<br>
the present invention. In that the alternative block 100 shares many common features<br>
with the preferred wall block 12, the following description of the wall block 100 is<br>
focused upon the differences of this block 100. As illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12, each<br>
wall block 100 comprises an exterior face 102, an opposed interior face 104, a top<br>
surface 106, a bottom surface 108, and two opposed sides 110. As with the preferred<br>
block 12, the exterior faces 102 of the blocks 100 typically are provided with an<br>
ornamental texture or facing that is sloped inwardly from the bottom surface 108 to the<br>
top surface 106. Also like the preferred block 12, the interior faces 104 of the wall<br>
blocks 100 preferably are configured in an upright or vertical orientation. Perferably the<br>
wall blocks 100 further include interior openings 112.<br>
As with the preferred blocks 12, the wall blocks 100 each preferably comprises a<br>
channel 114. Preferably, once such channel 114 is provided in the top surface 106 of<br>
each block 100, although alternative placement is feasible. The channel extends<br>
transversely across the block 100 from one side 110 of the block 100 to the other side<br>
110. As illustrated in FIG. 13. the channel 114 is defined by a front wall 118. a rear wall<br>
120. and a channel bottom surface 122. The front wall 118 can include a shoulder 124<br>
that extends inwardly toward the interior face 104 of the wall block 100. As indicated in<br>
FIG. 13. the shoulder 124 can be arranged as a curved lip such that the channel 114<br>
comprises a first substantially arcuate edge 126.<br>
Positioned opposite the front wall 118, the rear wall 120 of the channel 114 also<br>
preferably includes an inwardly extending shoulder 128. The rear wall shoulder 128<br>
preferably is arranged as a curved lip so as to form a second substantially arcuate edge<br>
130 of the channel 114. Although the shoulders 124. 128 have been described herein as<br>
being arranged as curved lips, it will be apparent from the present disclosure that<br>
alternative arrangements are feasible. Indeed, depending upon the particular implements<br>
used to retain the reinforcement members, the placement of the channel 114. and the<br>
degree of course-to-course locking desired, the walls 118. 120 can be formed without<br>
such shoulders 124, 128 to simplify block construction.<br>
Where a high degree of block engagement in adjacent courses is desired, the<br>
channel 114 is specifically adapted to receive a flange 116 that extends from the block<br>
100. Preferably, the flange 116 is provided on the bottom surface 108 of the block 100<br>
and extends transversely from one side 110 of the block 100 to the other side 110. As is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 14, the flange 116 is defined by a from surface 132, a rear surface 134.<br>
and a bottom surface 136. Both the front'surface 132 and the rear surface 134 extend<br>
toward the exterior face 102 of the wall block 100. With this configuration, the blocks<br>
100 can be placed on top of lower wall blocks 100 such that the flanges 116 extend into<br>
the channels 114. Once so situated, the courses of blocks 100 will resist shear forces in<br>
similar manner to courses containing the preferred blocks 12.<br>
When the alternative wall block 100 is used to form a retaining wall, preferably a<br>
third embodiment of a reinforcement member retaining bar 138 is used. Shown most<br>
clearly in FIG. 15. the retaining bar 138 comprises a plurality of different surfaces: a top<br>
surface 140, a bottom surface 142, a first upright surface 144, a second upright surface<br>
146, a first oblique surface 148, and a second oblique surface 150. Preferably, the top<br>
surface 140 and the bottom surface 142 are parallel to each other as are the first oblique<br>
surface 148 and the second oblique surface 150. Similarly, the first upright surface 144<br>
and the second upright surface 146 preferably are parallel to each other such that the first<br>
upright surface 144 extends perpendicularly from the top surface 140 and the second<br>
upright surface 146 extends perpendicularly from the bottom surface 142.<br>
Configured in this arrangement, the retaining bar 138 can be positioned on top of<br>
a reinforcement member 20 in the channels 114 by inserting the retaining bar 138 into<br>
the channels 114 in the manner depicted in FIG. 16. In that the bar 138 is designed to fit<br>
closely between the front and rear walls 118 and 120 of the channels 114 when in place,<br>
a longitudinal notch 152 can be provided in the channel 114 to accommodate the second<br>
upright surface 146 during the downward insertion of the bar 138, as illustrated in both<br>
FIGS. 16 and 17.<br>
While preferred embodiments of the invention have been disclosed in detail in<br>
the foregoing description and drawings, it will be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
that variations and modifications thereof can be made without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims. For instance, although<br>
particular block configurations have been identified herein, persons having ordinary skill<br>
in the art will appreciate that the concepts disclosed herein, in particular the retaining<br>
means described herein, are applicable to prior and future wall block designs.<br>
