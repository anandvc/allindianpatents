				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved carton for the storage of liquidores and particulate material. In particular, though not limited thereto, this invention relates to a carton having an integrally formed discharge spout for discharge of the materials contained therein.<br>
Cartons for storage and dispersing of particulate or granular materials are known in the art. Such cartons normally comprises a rectangular or square container with flaps at the upper or lower and. Normally, the lower and flaps are sealed, whereas the upper and flaps can be opened to allow a discharge of the material. However, a disadvantage associated with such a construction of a carton is that an opening of the upper flaps allows an ingress of moisture within the carton.    <br>
To obviate    such a      disadvantage,       a carton      is	also<br>
known         know having	both  the     upper         and     lower and<br>
flaps in a sealed relationship, and that it becomes necessary to pierce a hole in a sidewall or the upper flaps so as to allow a discharge of the material. As the hole remains in an open state, it also allows an ingress of moisture within the carton.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a carton having a discharge spout which no longer allows an ingress of moisture within the carton.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a carton having a discharge spout which can be actuated into an open and closed status.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved carton characterised by an outlet adapted to be opened or closed by a spout member (6), said spout member comprising a pair of side walls (7a, 7b) spaced from each other and having a base plate (8) therebetween, said spout member having an angular movement with respect to said carton so as to cause an opening or closure of said outlet.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig.l      shows  an  isomatric  view  of the  carton with a  cut  view  of  one  sidewall;<br>
Fig.2      shows  a  front  view  of the  carton; Fig.3      shows  a  side view of the carton; Figs 4a to 4c   show  the spout member.<br>
Referring to the drawings, and with particular reference to figs. 1 to 3, carton 1 of the present invention comprises a front wall 1 a, a back wall 1 b and side walls 2 a and 2 b. Carton 1 further comprises a base 3, which normally consists of lower flaps in a sealed relationship. Carton 1 further comprises an upper end 4, also normally consisting of upper flaps, which in the present instance are also in a sealed relationship so as to ensure that there is an absence of ingress of any moisture into said container. Container 1 may be made of any suitable material<br>
cardboard. Container 1 has an inner lining 5. Though Figs. 1 to 3 illustrate carton 1 to have a lining 5, however and in accordance with another embodiment carton 1 does not have an innner 1 i n i n g .<br>
Specifically, the present invention resides in the provision of a spout member 6 provided with one of the wall surfaces or upper end 4 of container 1. However, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment, spout member 6 is provided with sidewall 2a, as it does facilitate a grip of the container during a material discharge operation. In the instance where the container is round in shape, spout member 6 is provided with upper end 4.<br>
Spout member 6 is preferably made of metal, such as aluminium and comprises two sidewalls 7a and 7b disposed in a spaced relationship to each other and having a base plate 8 at the proximal end. The upper end 7a and 7b of each said side walls 7a and 7b respectively are arcuate. The<br>
lower   end  7 a  arid   7 b    of  sidewalls 7a  and  7b<br>
respectively are  longitudinal  surfaces.<br>
Reference is made in particular to base plate 8. As shown in F'igs. 4b and 4c, base plate 8 has a plurality of spaced teeth 9 projecting inwardly of spout member 6, which firstly allows spout member 6 to be field to container 1, and secondly allows spout member to have an angular movement so as to cause an outlet 10 in container 1. Outlet 10 is normally formed by piercing a hole or opening in container 1. In operation, a stapling operation is effected so that teeth 9 pierce the innerlinging 5 and then bent by any suitable force so as to complete a stapling operation.<br>
Discharge   outlet    10  is    generally   of    a rectangular   or   square  shape  and  such  that    the sides add upper are out  the  lower add   off outlet  10 extending  into  a flap  to which said  teeth 9  are  held.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1.	An improved carton characterised by an outlet adapted to be opened or closed by<br>
a spout member (6), said spout member comprising a pair of side walls (7a, 7b)<br>
spaced from each other and having a base plate (8) therebetween, said spout<br>
member having an angular movement with respect to said carton so as to cause an<br>
opening or closure of said outlet.<br>
2.	A carton as claimed in claim 1 wherein said base plate (8) is provided with a<br>
plurality of spaced teeth (9) projecting inwardly.<br>
3.	A carton as claimed in claim 1 wherein side wall and base plate are integrally<br>
formed and said side wall is having an upper arcuate surface.<br>
4.	A carton as claimed in claims 1 to 3 is provided with an inner lining.<br>
5.	A carton as claimed in claims 2 to 4 wherein said sidewall (7a,7b) and base plate<br>
(8) are integrally formed.<br>
6.	A carton as claimed in claim 1 wherein an inner lining (5) is provided within said<br>
carton.<br>
7.	A carton as claimed in claim 2 wherein said spout member (6) is of metal, such as<br>
aluminium.<br>
8.	A carton substantially as herein described and illustrated with reference to<br>
accompanying drawings.<br></td>
