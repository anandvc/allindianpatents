				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a photocrosslinkable polyarylene sulfides. More particularly it relates to a process for the preparation of polyarylene sulphides soluble in organic solvents and are photocrosslinkable to yield tough films. The photocrosslinkable polyarylene sulphides prepared by the process are new and can be used for high performance coating applications.<br>
Polyphenylene sulfide PPS in an important engineering polymer in the family of polyarylene sulphides. PPS is an high performance polymer with wide range of applications such as corrosion' resistant coatings, pump impeller, ball valves, chemical tower packing and number of molded engineering articles.<br>
PPS is conventionally synthesised by reacting 1,4 dichloro benzene with sodium sulfide in N-methyl pyrollidone at high temperatures and pressures. During the course of the reaction the polymer due to it's insolubility precipitates out of the system. As a consequence of this, the molecular weight of the polymer will not increase beyond the certain range which leads to the broad range molecular weight distribution. Such a low molecular weight PPS is suitable for the coating purposes.<br>
PPS for coating applications is formulated as a dispersion in water along with additives such as fillers, surface active agents, pigments etc. The coatings have to be thermally cured at temperatures in the range of 360 to 400 °C for a period' of ranging from 20 to 45 minutes.<br>
The disadvantnges of thermal curing can be overcome if a photocurable system can be synthesized. The advantages of photo-<br>
curable system are that the process would be techno-economically viable and faster curing times would be possible. This would result in faster processing cycles.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of photocrosslinkable polyarylene polymers.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of photocrosslinkable polyarylene sulphides of molecular weights in the acceptable range for coating applications that overcome the limitations of thermally curing systems.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for"the preparation of photocrosslinkable polyarylene sulphides that can be cured with UV source to tough films.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of photocrosslinkable copolysulfides which comprises reacting in an inert atmosphere 2,6 Bis (4-chloro benzylidene) cyclohexanone, alkali metal sulfides and 1,4 dihalo benzene, in the presence of a polar aprotic solvent at temperatures in the range of 170 to 220°C for a period ranging from 4 to 12 hours, cooling the reaction mixture to ambient temperature, pouring the reactants .into acidified alkanol and removing the product by conventional methods, washing with water to remove the unreacted<br>
material and by product and drying to get the final product.<br>
