METHOD FOR PRODUCING CIS-3-SUBSTITUTED-3-AZABICYCL0[3.2.1 ]0CTAN-8-0L DERIVATIVE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel method for producing a cis-3-substituted-3-a2abicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8"Ol derivative which is a useful intermediate for agricultural chemicals or pharmaceutical products.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-223777, filed August 30,2007, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
As a method for producing a cis-3-substituted-3fa2abicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-ol derivative, for example, a method m which 3-methyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-one is reduced with metallic sodium, and is then heated for 230 hours in the presence of benzophenone is known (refer to Non-Patent Document 1).<br>
In addition, a method is known m which 3-methyi-3-azabicyclot3.2.1]octan-8-one is reduced by a routine procedure to obtain the trans form thereof, and is then converted into triflate, followed by the inversion thereof with an acid (refer to Non-Patent Document 2).<br>
Meanwhile, a racemization reaction of optically active alcohols using a ruthenium complex as a catalyst is known (refer to Non-Patent Documents 3 and 4).<br><br>
[0003]<br>
[Non-Patent Document 1] J. Org. Chem., 1963,28,2407 [Non-Patent Document 2] J. Med. Chem., 2003,46,1456 [Non-Patent Document 3] J. Organomet., Chem., 2002,652,105 [Non-Patent Document 4] Tetrahedron Lett., 2003.44, 7521<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]<br>
However, the method described in Non-Patent Document 1 has problems that reaction time is long, and moreover, the yield of the target cis form is low. In the method of Non-Patent Document 2, there are problems as an industrial production method because the reaction has to undergo multiple stages and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid anhydride used as a reagent is expensive. On the other hand, an example in which a hydrogen transfer reaction using a transition metal complex is applied for a racemization reaction has been conventionally known. However, in the case of racemization, since the inversion process advances only up to 50% at a maximum, it has been considered that a preferential inversion from one isomer to another isomer is not possible.<br>
[0005]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a cis-3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-ol derivative which is industrially useful, with a high yield and versatility.<br>

[0016] (Ketone compound)<br>
A ketone compound used in the present invention is a compoimd represented by a formula R-CO-R.

preferred. R and R may be the same or may be different from each other. In addition, R. and R may form a 5- to 10-membered ring together.<br>
Among these various possibilities, an alicyclic ketone compound in which R and R' are forming a 5- to 10-membered ring together is more preferable, and an alicyclic ketone compound having a 6-membered ring structure is particularly desirable.<br>

The amount of aluminum compound added is typically within a range from 10 to 200 mol% and preferably within a range from 30 to 100 mol%, with respect to 1 mole of a raw material compound. In addition, the amount of ketone compound added is typically within a range from 10 to 500 mol% and preferably within a range from 90 to 300 mol%, with respect to 1 mole of a raw material con(ipound. The isomerization reaction is typically conducted at a temperature within a range from room temperature to reflux temperature.<br>
[0018]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the method by which a trans-3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3,2.1]j-8-ol derivative or a mixture of the trans- and cis-3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-ol derivatives serving as a raw material is made available. However, it can be acquired by heating a 3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-one derivative under reflux in a solvent, in the presence of an aluminum compound represented by the aforementioned formula A1(0R')3 (in the formula, R represents a hydrocarbon group in which a carbon atom having an oXygen atom bonded thereto is a secondar&gt;' carbon atom), thereby conducting a reduction reaction.<br>
Here, as the aforementioned 3-substituted-3-azatiicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-one derivative, for example, a compound represented by the formula (3) shown below can be mentioned. Note that the 3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-one derivative may have a substituent on the azabicyclo [3.2,1] octane ring, in a similar manner to that of the 3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-ol derivatives represented by the aforementioned chemical formula (1) or (2), and examples of the substituent include the same substituents as those exemplified for the substituents of the 3-substituted-3-<br><br>
a2abicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-ol derivatives represented by the aforementioned chemical formula (1) or (2).<br><br>
(In the formula, R is as defined above.)<br>
The amount of aluminum compound added when conducting the aforementioned reduction reaction is typically within a range from 10 to 200 mol% and preferably within a range from 30 to 100 mol%, with respect to 1 mole of a 3-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-one derivative.<br>
After obtaining a trans-3-substituted-3-azabicyclt)[3.2.1]8-ol derivative or a mijcture of the trans- and cis-3-substituted-3-a2abicyclo[|3.2.1]octan-8-ol derivatives by the above method, it is preferable to remove a hydrogen donor compound, such as an alcohol, from the reaction solution by a method such as vacuum concentration.<br>
