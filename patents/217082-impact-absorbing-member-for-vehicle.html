DESCRIPTION<br>
IMPACT ABSORBING MEMBER FOR VEHICLE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a member for absorbing an impact or the energy therefrom, provided inside a vehicle structural member such as a door, a door trim, a body side panel, a roof panel, a pillar, and a bumper, for absorbing the impact from the inside such as the collision of a passenger against the inner wall of the vehicle structural member or the impact from the outside such as the collision with another vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As this kind of an energy absorbing member for a vehicle, the official gazette of Japanese Patent No. 3,313,999 discloses an energy absorbing component with a hollow double wall structure, produced by blow molding of thermoplastics, forming recessed ribs from the front surface wall and the rear surface wall with the top end parts thereof bonded with each other so as to be integrated for improving the impact absorbing property, and the official gazette of Japanese Patent Application Laid Open (JP-A) No. 2002-187508 discloses one comprising an interlocking rib for integrally linking a plurality of recessed ribs for improving the energy absorbing property.<br>
This kind of an energy absorbing member is designed to be provided inside a vehicle structural member such as a door and a body side panel.    It has been found that a sufficient shock absorbing property is not obtained by merely linking a plurality of the recessed ribs integrally as shown in the official gazette of Japanese Patent Application Laid Open (JP-A) No.<br><br>
Moreover, according to the energy absorbing member for a vehicle as disclosed in the official gazette of Japanese Patent No. 3,313,999 produced by forming recessed ribs from the front surface wall and the rear surface wall with the top end parts thereof bonded with each other so as to be integrated, it is pointed out that although the shock absorbing property with respect to the stress by the impact is high, in the case the stress by the impact is applied continuously, the recessed ribs buckle so that the impact absorbing property is deteriorated remarkably so that the intended shock absorbing property is not obtained.<br>
Furthermore, since the welded surface produced by forming recessed ribs from the front surface wall and the rear surface wall and welding the top end parts with each other in the blow molding process is formed by pressuring a parison in a molten state by a mold, the resin in the molten state is pushed out to the outer circumference of the bonding part so as to generate puddle as shown in FIG. 11.    The marks a', b' denote a recessed rib, c' a bonding part, and d' a resin puddle swelling to the outside of the bonding part c\    Thereby, a notch part is formed or the thickness of the recessed rib becomes uneven so that the shock absorbing performance of the energy absorbing member is lowered, and thus a desired shock absorbing effect cannot be obtained.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In FIGS. 1 and 2, the reference numeral 1 denotes an energy absorbing member for a vehicle.    The energy absorbing member for a vehicle 1 comprised of a thermoplastic resin. It is molded integrally by blow molding, and comprises a hollow part 2, and a plurality of recessed ribs 5, 6 formed by denting both a first wall 3 and a second wall 4 facing with each other, with the top end parts of the first and the second recessed ribs 5, 6 contacted with each other so as to provide a welded surface 7.<br>
The height from the first wall 3 to the welded surface 7 of the first recessed ribs 5 is formed to 15.0 to 45.0 mm, and the height from the second wall 4 to the welded surface 7 of the second recessed ribs 6 is formed to 15.0 to 45.0 mm.    By forming the height of the first recessed ribs 5 and the<br><br>
second recessed ribs 6 in a range of 15.0 to 45.0 mm, the impact at the time of the collision can be absorbed sufficiently in the process of crushing the recessed ribs so that a preferable energy absorbing member for a vehicle can be produced.    The average distance between the first wall 3 and the second wall 4 of the energy absorbing member for a vehicle 1 is 30.0 to 90.0 mm, and the average thickness is 2.0 to 5.0 mm.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention shown in FIGS. 3 to 6, the energy absorbing member for a vehicle 1 comprises an interlocking rib 8 for integrally linking a plurality of adjacent recessed ribs 5.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the interlocking rib 8 is formed on a virtual straight lines c.    The virtual straight lines are positioned with the angle 6 formed with respect to the horizontal line d in a range of 30 to 60°.    The ratio of the adjacent recessed ribs 5 formed on the virtual straight line with the interlocking ribs 8 formed is 10% to 60%.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the depth of interlocking ribs 8 is formed in a range of 3.0 
Furthermore, the interlocking ribs 8 are formed such that the total length of all the interlocking ribs is in a range of 10 to 60% with respect to the total length of all the segments virtual lines on both walls from edge to edge.    In particular, it is preferable that they are formed only in one of the<br><br>
first wall 3 and the second wall 4, with the ratio of 25%.<br>
Here, according to the energy absorbing member shown in FIG. 4, the interlocking ribs 8 are disposed only in the first wall 3, out of the 38 recessed ribs 5, 6 formed in the first wall 3 and the second wall 4 on the virtual straight line c, with the virtual straight line disposed in a range of 30 to 60° of the angle G with respect to the horizontal line d so as to link the adjacent first recessed ribs 5 with each other only in one inclination direction for 50% of those on the virtual lines.    That is, out of the 56 interlocking ribs formable by the calculation, 14 interlocking ribs are formed such that the interlocking ribs 8 are formed by a 25% ratio of the total of the first and second recessed ribs 5, 6 formed on the virtual straight lines.    According to an energy absorbing member shown in FIG. 6, by the same calculation, the interlocking ribs are formed by a 14.3% ratio.<br>
In the case where the depth b of the interlocking ribs 8 is less than 3 mm, the strength needed for constantly maintaining the posture of the recessed ribs 5 is insufficient so as to generate sideways toppling.    Moreover, in the case the depth b of the interlocking ribs 8 is larger than the value of the square root of the two times of the thickness a of the energy absorbing member for a vehicle 1, the interlocking ribs 8 are contacted with the facing wall before providing full performance in the process of crushing the first and second recessed ribs 5, 6 at the time of collision so that the desired energy absorbing performance cannot be obtained.<br>
The interlocking ribs 8 for linking a plurality of the recessed ribs 5 is open or closed such as illustrated in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 7 and 8. According to the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 8, the closed interlocking rib 8, so-called inner rib, is formed hidden inside the hollow part 2.    The inner rib is produced by temporarily forming a groove-like rib from the first wall 3<br><br>
toward the hollow part 2 direction at the time of blow molding, and integrating into a plate-like rib by the blow pressure.    The desired energy absorbing performance can be obtained by accordingly providing the interlocking rib 8 as the inner rib.<br>
A cross-sectional enlarged view of a pair of the recessed ribs is shown in FIGS. 9 to 11.    On the welded surface 7 with the top end parts of the first recessed rib 5 and the second recessed rib 6 welded and integrated, a swelling part 9 is formed integrally, with a hollow part 10 formed in the swelling part 9.<br>
The swelling part 9 formed on the welded surface 7 of the first and second recessed ribs 5, 6 may be formed as a stepwise fashion 17 with both end parts of the welded surface 7 projecting as shown in FIG. 10.<br>
FIGS. 17 and 18 show a blow molding step for forming the swelling part 9.    In FIGS, 17 and 18, the reference numerals 11,11 denote a pair of split mold halves, 12, 12 denote cavities, and 13, 13 denote recessed rib forming parts.    One of the recessed rib forming parts, 13, 13 has a swelling part forming member 14.    The reference numeral 15 denotes a parison, and 16 an extrusion head.<br>
As shown in FIG. 17, by disposing the parison 15 between the pair of the split mold halves 11, 11, closing the mold as shown in FIG. 18, and blowing a pressurized fluid into the parison 15 for blow molding, the pressed resin flows into the swelling part forming part 14 so as to form the swelling part 9 on the welded surface 7 to be formed by being pressed by the top end surfaces of the recessed rib forming parts 13, 13.    Then, since the waste of the resin to the outer circumference of the welded surface 7 can be prevented according to the influx to the swelling part forming part 14 of the flowing resin pressed by the top end surfaces of the recessed rib forming parts 13, 13,<br><br>
the resin puddle is not generated on me outer circumierence 01 tne weiaea surface 7 so that the thickness irregularity is not generated in the welded surface 7 as well.    By changing the position and the shape of the swelling part forming part 14 of the recessed rib forming parts 13, 13, the stepwise parts 17 shown in FIG. 10 can be formed.<br>
Moreover, by forming the swelling part 9 projecting stepwise from the welded surface toward the first wall 3 or the second wall 4, with the height thereof in a range of 0.5 to 6.0 mm in the recessed rib 20 axis direction, generation of the resin puddle on the outer circumference of the bonding part can be prevented preferably.    Furthermore, by forming the hollow part 10 in the swelling part 9, the thickness of the welded surface 7 can be formed evenly so that an energy absorbing member having the stable energy absorbing property can be formed.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 12 to 14, the energy absorbing member for a vehicle 1 according to the invention comprises at least one pair of recessed ribs 20 having a welded surface 7 with the top end parts of the first recessed rib 5 and second side rib 6 welded and integrated, and at least one pair of recessed ribs 19 having an interval 18 of 5.0 to 18.0 mm on average with the top end parts of the first recessed rib and the second recessed rib adjacent with each other.<br>
It is preferable that the recessed ribs 20 having the welded surface 7, the fused ribs, are about approximately 50 to 80% with respect to the total number of the recessed ribs. In such an embodiment, some ribs are configured such that the rib from the first wall is separated from its corresponding rib from the second wall by an interval. Such a configuration generally occurs in about approximately 50 to 20% of the ribs in a component.<br>
Moreover, the facing interval of the top end parts of the recessed ribs<br><br>
19 having the interval with the top end parts provided adjacently is preferably 5.0 to 18.0 mm on average.<br>
According to the recessed ribs shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, one of the pair of the recessed ribs 19 having the interval 18 with the top end parts provided adjacently has the top end part formed as a concave surface part 21, and the other one has the top end part formed as a convex surface part 22, respectively.    Then, by forming the top end parts accordingly, in the state with the recessed ribs 5, 6 deformed by receiving the impact so as to have the top end parts thereof contacted with each other, displacement with each other can be prevented so that the energy absorbing property of the energy absorbing member for a vehicle 1 can further be improved.    The concave and convex surfaces of the recessed ribs 5, 6 may be provided in any mating fashion.<br>
The energy absorbing member for a vehicle 1 according to the invention is blow molded as shown in FIGS. 15 and 16.    The reference numerals 11, 11 are a pair of split mold halves.    The split mold halves 11,11 are provided with recessed rib forming parts 13,13 for forming the recessed ribs 5, 6.    The reference numeral 15 denotes a parison, and 16 an extrusion head.<br>
As the thermoplastic resin for providing the energy absorbing member for a vehicle 1 according to the invention, a resin having large mechanical strength and high degree of rigidity can be used.    Examples thereof include a polyolefin resin such as a high density polyethylene resin and a polypropylene resin, a styrene resin such as a polystyrene resin, an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS resin), an acrylonitrile-styrene resin (AS resin) and an acrylonitrile-acrylic rubber-styrene copolymer (AAS resin), a polyester resin such as a<br><br>
polyethylene terephthalate, a polycarbonate resin, a polyamide resin, a polyphenylene ether resin (PPO resin), and a blended composite thereof.<br>
The energy absorbing member for a vehicle 1 according to the invention is provided inside a vehicle structural member such as a door of, a door trim, a body side panel, a roof panel, a pillar, a bumper, or the like. FIG. 19 shows an embodiment of providing the energy absorbing member for a vehicle 1 according to the invention inside a door trim 24 of a door 23, FIG. 20 shows an embodiment of providing the same inside a rear pillar 25 of an automobile, FIG. 21 shows an embodiment of providing the same inside a rear bumper 26, and FIG. 22 shows an embodiment of providing the same between a bumper fascia 27 and a bumper beam 28 of an automobile bumper.    In FIG, 20, the mark A denotes the head of a passenger.<br>
Moreover, FIG. 23 illustrates an energy absorbing member for a vehicle 1 according to one embodiment of the present invention which comprises the recessed rib 5 provided by denting the first wall 3 toward the facing second wall 4. The welded surface 7 with the top end part of the recessed rib and the second wall welded such that the height of the recessed rib from the first wall 3 to the welded surface 7 is about approximately 15.0 to 45.0 mm.<br>
