SCREW RETENTION DEVICE Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to screw retention devices, and more particularly to a screw retention device having a serrated holding portion for engagement with corresponding serrations on  a screw to be retained.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
When using a fastener, such as a screw, there is a risk that vibrations, or other conditions, will cause the screw to shift in posit ion, loosen and, in some cases, fall out. To prevent the screw from shifting or falling out/ numerous screw retention devices and methods have been developed. As shown in Figure 4, a known device 200 is disclosed for preventing fall out. The device 200 includes a wiring mechanism 202 that is used to wire a pair of tightened screw heads 204, 206 together.<br>
Another known device 220 is shown in Figures 5a-5c. The known device 220 includes a tightening plate 222, best shown in Figure 5a, having a.pair of holes 224 dimensioned to receive screws 226. The screws 226, as best shown in Figure 5b, have a triangular head portion 228 and a threaded shaft 230. To install the tightening plate 222, the screw shaft 230 is positioned through a hole 224 of the tightening plate 222 prior to being threadingly engaged with another object. As shown in Figure 5c, each tightening plate 222 receives two screws 22 6.  When the screws are fastened, the edge 232 of the<br><br>
tightening plate 222 is bent in the direction designated as X, shown in Figure 5c, to fit the shape of the screw.  When the edges 232 are bent around the screw 22 6, the bent edges prevent the triangular head 228 from rotating.  Thus, the screw 226 is maintained in position.<br>
The known methods of retaining screws in a static position are complicated and time consuming. Accordingly, there is a need for a simplified method and device to retain screws in a static position.<br>
Summary of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
A screw retention device is disclosed for maintaining at least a pair of screws in a substantially static position. The terra screw is used herein to refer to any fastener that threadingly engages an object. The screw retention device preferably includes at least two clamping portions, each-clamping portion defining a recess therein for receiving and securely retaining a screw. The clamping portions include a serrated surface extending circumferentially around an inside periphery of the clamping portion, surrounding the recess. The serrated surface of the clamping portion corresponds to and engages with a serrated surface on the screw to retain the screw. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the screw retention device is press fitted onto the screws.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the serrated surface of the clamping portion extends around the entire inside periphery of the clamping portion and the serrated surface of the screw extends around the entire outside periphery of the screw. The screw retention device is snap fit onto the screws and the serrated surface of the clamping portions engage the serrated surface of the screws.<br><br>
The screws preferably have a conical head portion to facilitate "Che installation of the screw retention device. During installation, the clamping portions slide down the conical head portion of the screw until the serrated surface of the clamping portions engages the serrated surface of the screw. In a more preferred embodiment, the conical head portion of the screw is dimensioned to overlap the top surface of the screw retention device when the device is installed, and restrict the movement of the device in the direction of the axis of the screw.<br>
The screw retention device is preferably made of an elastic material that provides elastic yield during the installation of the device. In one embodiment of the invention, the screw retention device comprises rubber. In another embodiment of the invention, the screw retention device comprises a relatively harder material, such as plastic. If a relatively harder material is used, slits-, are provided in the screw retention device, extending from the recess, to facilitate the installation of the device.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the clamping portions include a serrated surface and a non-serrated surface on the inside periphery surrounding the recess. The non-serrated surface is preferably disposed proximal the slit . To facilitate the removal of the screw retention device from the screws, the clamping portions preferably include a pair of extension handles. The extension handles operate such that by pulling the handles apart/ the recess is expanded and the serrated surface of the clamping portion disengages from the serrated surface of the screw.<br>
Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description. It is to be understood,  however,  that  the  detailed  description  and<br><br>

In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the serrated surface 24 extends circumferentially along the entire inside circumference 22 of the screw engagement portions 16, 18. In another embodiment of the inventionr the serrated surface 2 4 extends partially along the inside circumference 22 of the screw engagement portions 16, 18 (not shown).<br>
The screw retention device 10 is configured to be used in conjunction with screws having a serrated section, as described more fully below. As shown in Figure 1, screw 100 includes a shaft 102 and a head 104. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the head 104 includes a conical section 106 and a serrated section 108. The serrated section 108 of the screw 100 is configured to correspond to and engage with the serrated surface 24 of the screw engagement portions 16, 18, when the screw retention device 10 is installed on the screw 100.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the screw retention device 10 engages two screws 100.  When installed, the first engagement portion 16 of the screw retention device 10 engages-a first screw and the second engagement portion 13 of the screw retention device 10 engages a second screw.<br><br>
Specifically, the serrated surfaces 2 4 of the engagement portions 16, 18 are configured to engage the serrated section 108 of the screws 100. To install the screw retention device 10 on the screws 100, the first and second engagement portions 16, 18 are aligned with the first and second screws, respectively. The screw retention device is "pressed onto the screws until the engagement portions 16, 18 slip over the conical section 106 of the screws- The shape of the conical section 106 facilitates the movement of the engagement portions 16, 13 toward the serrated section 108. Upon passing the conical section 106 of the screw, the serrated surfaces 24 of the engagement portions 16, 18 mesh with the serrated sections 10S of the screws. when the serrated surfaces 24 engages the serrated sections 103 of the screws, the screws are substantially maintained in a static position until the screw retention device is removed.<br>
The conical section 106 of the screw 100 is preferably dimensioned to restrict the movement of the screw retention device 10. Specifically, when the screw retention device 10 is installed on the screw 100, the edge 110 of the conical section 106 of the screw 100 at least partially overlaps the top surface 2 6 of the screw retention device 10, such that, the motion of the screw retention device 10 is restricted in the direction of the center axis A of the screw 100.<br>
To facilitate the installation of the screw retention device 10 on the screws, the screw retention device 10 is preferably comprised of an elastic material that provides elastic yield when the screw retention device 10 is pressed onto the head portion 104 of the screw 100. In a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the screw retention device 10 comprises rubber. The elasticity of the screw retention device 10 allows the device to be snap-fit (or press<br>
fif on rn t h p hP^H nnrti'nn 104 of  the screw.<br><br>
In the embodiment of the invention shewn m Figure 1, tne screw retention device 10 immobilizes a pair of screws 100 simultaneously. The screw retention device 10, shown in Fiqure 1, includes two engagement portions IS, IS each engagement portion engaging a screw. In another embodiment of the invention (not shown)/ the screw retention device 10 includes three or more engagement portions, each engagement portion engaging one screw. The screw retention device 10 operates in the same manner as the previous embodiment in that the serrated surface 24 of each engagement portion 16, 18 engages the serrated section 108 of a screw 100. However/ additional engagement portions can be added, and the length and shape of the screw retention device can be altered to accommodate additional screws, without departing from the inventive concept disclosed herein.<br>
Yet another preferred embodiment of the screw retention device of the present invention is shown in Figure 2 and designated as numeral 30. Screw retention device 30 has a first clamping portion 36 at a first end 32 of the screw retention device 30 and a second clamping portion 38 at a second end 34 of the screw retention device 30. The first and second clamping portions 36, 38, are connected to each other by-a connecting arm 40. Each of the first clamping portion 36 and the second clamping portion 38 define a recess 42 therein. The recess is preferably dimensioned to receive a screw 100 and securely retain the screw 100 in the recess 42.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, as shown in Figure 2, the clamping portions 36, 38 each have an the inside circumference 44, The inside circumference 44 of the clamping portions 36, 38 preferably carries a serrated portion 46 and a non-serrated portion 48. The serrated portion 4 6 preferably, at least partially, surrounds the recess 42 at a location distal from the connecting arm 40.  The non-serrated<br><br>
portion 4 8 preferably,  at least partially,  surrounds the recess 42 at a location proximal the connecting  arm 40.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the screw retention device 30 comprises a relatively rigid material. Specifically, the material of the screw retention device 30 shown in Figure 2 is more rigid than the material of the screw retention device 10 shown in Figure 1. In a preferred embodiment of. the invention, the material of the screw retention device 3 0, shown in Figure 2, provides an elastic yield to facilitate the installation of the screw retention device 30 onto the screws 100 and the removal of the screw retention device 30 therefrom. In a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the screw retention device 30 comprises plastic.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the screw retention device 30 engages two screws 100, as shown in Figure 2. To install the screw retention device 30, the first clamping portion 36 of the screw retention device 30 is aligned with a first screw and the second clamping portion 38 of the screw retention device 30 is aligned with a second screw. The screw-retention device is then pressed onto the screws until the clamping portions 36, 38 slip over the conical section 106 of the screws. As discussed above, the shape of the conical section 1C6 facilitates the movement of the clamping portions 3 6, 3 8 toward the serrated section 108 of the screw. Upon passing the conical section 106 of the screw, the serrated portion 46 of' the clamping portions 36, 38 mesh with the serrated sections 108 of the screws, When the serrated portions 4 6 engage the serrated sections 103 of the screws, the screws are substantially maintained in a static position until the screw retention device 30 is removed.<br>
The screw retention device 30 preferably includes a slit 50 extending from each of the first and second clamping<br><br>
portions 36, 38 in the direction of the connecting arm 40. Because the screw retention device 30 is made of a relatively rigid material, the slits 50 facilitate the deformation of the clamping portions 36, 38 as the screw retention device 30 is installed on the screws. Specifically, as the clamping portions 36, 38 are pressed over the head 104 of the screw 100, the slit 50 allows the recess 42 of the clamping portion<br>
3	6, 3 8 to expand. The recess remains expanded as the screw<br>
retention device 30 is pressed over the conical section 106 of<br>
the screw. When the serrated portion 46 of the clamping<br>
portion 36, 38 arrives at the serrated section- 108 of the<br>
screw, the screw retention device 30 snaps back into its<br>
normal state from its expanded state.<br>
Since the screw retention device 30 of the embodiment shown in Figure 2 is made of a relatively rigid material, the connecting arm 40 is difficult to compress in the longitudinal direction. Accordingly, to fit the screw retention device 30 on the screws, the length of the connecting arm, L, must be equivalent or shorter than the distance, B, between the screws. In the event that the distance between the screws, B, is slightly larger than the length of the connecting arm, L, the clamping portions 36, 38 will still be able to engage the serrated sections 108 of the screws. Namely, the serrated portion 46 of the clamping portion 36, 38 meshes with the serrated section 108 and securely maintains the screw in place. To retain the position of a screw, it is not required that the screw retention device 30 include a serrated portion<br>
4	6 that extends circumferentially around the entire inside<br>
circumference 44 of the clamping portions 36, 38. As shown<br>
in Figure 2 r and discussed above, the serrated portion 46<br>
extends partially around the inside circumference 44 of the<br>
clamping portions 36, 38, By providing the serrated portion<br>
4 6 at a location distal from the connecting arm 40, the screw<br><br>
retention device 30 can engage the serrated section 109 of a pair of screws that are apart a distance that is greater than the length of the connecting arm, L.<br>
The screw retention device 30 preferably includes handles 52. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the handles 52 are integrally attached to and extend from the clamping portion 36, 38. When the screw retention device 30 is installed on ' the screws 100, the handles 52 are used to facilitate the removal of the screw retention device 30 from the screws. Specifically, the handles 52 are preferably pulled apart in the direction depicted as C in Figure 2. By pulling the handles 52 apart, the recess 42 of the clamping portions 36, 38 is expanded and the serrated portion 46 of the screw retention device is disengaged from the serrated section 108 of the screw. The screw retention device ca.n then be removed from the screws.<br>
As discussed with respect to the embodiment shown in Figure 1, the screw retention device 3 0 is not limited to having two clamping portions 3 6, 3 8. The screw retention device 30 can include three or more clamping portions, each clamping portion engaging one screw. The screw retention device having three or more clamping portions would operate in the -same manner as the embodiment shown in Figure 2, in that the serrated portion 46 of each clamping portion engages the serrated section of a screw 100. As such, additional clamping portions can be added, and the length and shape of the screw retention device can be altered to accommodate additional screws, without departing from the inventive concept disclosed herein.<br>
An  alternative embodiment of the screw retention device of the present invention is shown in Figure 3 and designated as numeral 60, In this embodiment of the invention, the screw retention device 60 has a plurality of clamping portions 62.<br><br>
Each clamping portion includes a pair of slits' 64 to accommodate 3 yield in the material of the screw retention . device during installation. The clamping portions 62 each have a serrated portion 66 (not shown) that engages the serrated section 108 of the screw and retains the screw in a substantially static position.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 3, six screws 100 are installed on. a disc brake rotor 120 in a circular relationship. The shape of the screw retention device 60 substantially corresponds to the layout of the screws 100. Each clamping portion 62 is configured to align and engage with a corresponding screw. To install, the screw retention device 60 is snap fit or press fit onto the plurality of screws. Although Figure 3 depicts a disc brake rotor, the present invention is not limited to be used solely in such an application. Rather, the screw retention device can be used in any application wherein it is desirable to maintain a plurality of fasteners in a substantially static position.<br>
