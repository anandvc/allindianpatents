BETA-AMINO HETEROCYCLIC DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE INHIBITORS FOR THE TREATMENT OR PREVENTION OF DIABETES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes refers to a disease process derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose or hyperglycemia in the fasting state or af:er administration of glucose durins an oral glucose tolerance rest. Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with alterations oi the lipid. lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism and other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Therefore patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus are at especially increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular -disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutical control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and hypertension are critically important m the ciinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NEDDM), patients often have plasma insulin levels that are the same or even elevated compared to nondiabetic subjects; however, these patients have developed a resistance to the insulin stimulating effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, which are muscle, liver and adipose tissues, and the plasma insulin levels, while elevated, are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance.<br>
Insulin resistance is not primarily due to a diminished number of insulin receptors but to a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet understood. This resistance to insulin responsiveness results in insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver.<br>
The available treatments for type 2 diabetes, which have not changed substantially in many years, have recognized limitations. While physical exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will dramatically improve the diabetic condition, compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of saturated fat. Increasing the plasma level of insulin by administration of sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide and glipizide) or meglitinide.<br><br>
which stimulate the pancreaticβ—cells to secrete more insulin, and/or by injection of insulin when sulfonylureas or meelitinide become ineffective, can result in insulin concentrations high enough to stimulate the very insulin-resistant tissues. However, dangerously low levels of plasma glucose can result from administration of insulin or insulin secre'tagogues *,sulfonylureas or rr.eglitinide), and an increased level of insulin resistance due to the even higher plasma insulin levels can occur. The bisuanides increase insulin sensitivitv resulting in some correction of hyperglycemia. However, the two biguanides, phenformin and metformin, can induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea. Metformin has fewer side effects than phenformin and is often prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.<br>
The glitazones (i.e. 5-benzylthiazolidine-2.4-ciones) are a more recently described class of compounds with potential for ameliorating many symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These agents substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of type 2 diabetes resulting in partial or complete correction of tfie elevated plasma levels of glucose without occurrence of hypoglycemia. The glitazones that are currently marketed are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR). primarily the PPAR-gamma subtype. PPAR-gamma agonism is generally believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensititization that is observed with the glitazones. Newer PPAR agonists that are being tested for treatment of Type II diabetes are agonists of the alpha, gamma or delta subtype, or a combination of these, and in many cases are chemically different from the glitazones (i.e., they are not thiazolidinediones). Serious,side effects (e.g. liver toxicity) have occurred with some of the glitazones, such as troglitazone.<br>
Additional methods of treating the disease are still under investigation. New biochemical approaches that have been recently introduced or are still under development include treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g. acarbose) and protein tyrosine phosphatase-lB (PTP-1B) inhibitors.<br>
Compounds that are inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV ("DP-IV" or "DPP-IV") enzyme are also under investigation as drugs that may be useful in the treatment of diabetes, and particularly type 2 diabetes. See for example WO 97/40832, WO 98/19998. U.S. Patent No. 5.939.560, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 6: 1163-1166 (1996): and Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.. 6: 2745-274S (1996). The usefulness of DP-IV inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is based on the fact that DP-IV in vivo readily inactivates glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). GLP-1 and GIP are incretins and are produced when food is consumed. The incretins stimulate production of insulin. Inhibition of DP-IV leads to decreased inactivation of the incretins, and this in turn results in increased effectiveness of the incretins in stimulating production of insulin by the pancreas. DP-IV inhibition therefore results in an<br><br>
increased level of serum insulin. Advantageously, since the incretins are produced by the body only when food is consumed, DP-TV inhibition is not expected to increase the level of insulin at inappropriate times, such as between meals, which can lead to excessively low hiood sugar (hypoglycemia). Inhibition of DP-IV is therefore expected :o increase insulin without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, which is a dangerous side effect associated with the use of insulin secretagogues.<br>
DP-IV inhibitors also have other theraoeutic utilities, as discussed herein. DP-Pv"<br>
inhibitors have not been studied extensively to date, especially for utilities other than diabetes.<br>
New compounds are needed so that improved DP-TV inhibitors can be found for the treatment of<br>
diabetes and potentially other diseases and conditions. The therapeutic potential of DP-IV<br>
inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is discussed by DJ. Drucker in Exp. Opin. Invest.<br>
Drugs, 12; S7-I00 (2003) and by K. Augustyns, et al., in Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents. 13: 499-510<br>
(2003).	-   ■<br>

The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers. diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. The compounds of the present invention have one asymmetric center at the carbon atom marked with an * in formula la. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various subsiituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this inventien.- The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers, which have different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts. For example, a ketone and its enol form are keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of the present invention.—<br>
Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred stereochemistry. Formula la shows the preferred sterochemistry at the carbon atom to which is attached the amino group of the beta amino acid from which these compounds are prepared.<br>
The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.<br>
If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantionierically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The' coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the<br><br>
added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods arc well known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may he obtained by szereosdective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by me:hecs well known in the art.<br>

The utility.of.the compounds in accordance with the present invention as . inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme activity may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art. Inhibition constants are determined as follows. A continuous tluorometric assay is employed with the substrate Gly-Pro-AMC, which is cleaved by DP-FV to release the fluorescent AMC leaving group. The kinetic parameters that describe this reaction are as follows: Km = 50μM; kcal = 75 s_i; kcat/Km = 1.5 x 106 M'V1.   A typical reaction contains approximately 50 pM enzyme, 50 jiM Gly-Pro-AMC. and buffer (100mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) in a total reaction volume of 10CTμl. Liberation of AMC is monitored continuously in a 96-well plate fluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Under these conditions, approximately 0.8μM AMC is produced in 30 minutes at 25 degrees C. The enzyme used in these studies was soluble (transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic extension excluded) human protein produced in a baculovirus expression systerr (Bac-To-BacT Gibco BRL). The kinetic constants for hydrolysis of Gly-Pro-AMC and GLP-1 were found to be in accord with literature values for the native enzyme. To measure the dissociation constants for compounds, solutions of inhibitor in DMSO were added to reactions containing enzyme and substrate (final DMSO concentration is 1%). All experiments were conducted at room temperature using the standard reaction conditions described above. To determine the dissociation constants (Kj)? reaction rates were fit by non-linear regression to the Michaelis-Menton equation for competitive inhibition. The errors in reproducing the dissociation constants are typically less than two-fold.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the foIIowing examples had activity in inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme in the aforementioned assays, generally v.ith an IC50 of less<br><br>
than about 1 μM. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of theTompounds in use as inhibitors the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme activity.<br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme (DP-IV) is a cell surface protein that has been implicated in a wide range of biological functions. It has a broad tissue distribution (intestine, kidney, liver, pancreas, placenta, thymus, spleen, epithelial cells, vascular endothelium, lymphoid and myeloid cells, serum), and distinct tissue and cell-type expression levels. DP-IV is identical to the T ceil activation marker CD26, and it can cleave a number of immunoregulatory, endocrine, and neurological peptides in vitro. This has suggested a potential roie for this peptidase in a variety of disease processes in humans or other species.<br>
Accordingly, the subject compounds are useful in a method for the prevention or treatment of the following diseases, disorders and conditions.<br>
Tvpe n Diabetes and Related Disorders: It is well established that the incretins GLP-1 and GIP are rapidly inactivated in vivo by DP-TV. Studies with DP-IV-deficient mice and preliminary clinical trials indicate that DP-IV inhibition increases the steady state concentrations of GLP-1 and GIP, resulting in improved glucose tolerance. By analogy to GLP-l and GIP. it is likely that other glucagon family peptides involved in glucose regulation are also inactivated by DP-IV (eg.    -PACAP). Inactivation of these peptides by DP-IV may also play a role in glucose homeostasis. The DP-IV inhibitors of the present invention therefore have utility in the treatment of Type II diabetes and in the treatment and prevention of the numerous conditions that often accompany Type II diabetes, including Syndrome X (also known as Metabolic Syndrome), reactive hypoglycemia, and diabetic dyslipidemia. Obesity, discussed below, is another condition that is often found with Type II diabetes that may respond to treatment with the compounds of this invention.<br>
The following diseases, disorders and conditions are related to Type 2 diabetes, and therefore may be treated, controlled or in some cases prevented, by treatment with the compounds of this invention: (1) hyperglycemia, (2) low glucose tolerance. (3) insulin resistance. (4) obesity, (5) lipid disorders, (6) dyslipidemia, (7) hyperlipidemia, (S) hypertriglyceridemia, (9) hypercholesterolemia, (10) low HDL levels, (11) high LDL levels, (12) atherosclerosis and its sequelae, (13) vascular restenosis, (14) irritable bowel syndrome, (15) inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, (16) other inflammatory conditions, (17)   pancreatitis, (18) abdominal obesity, (19) neurodegenerative disease. (20) retinopathy, (21) nephropathy, (22) neuropathy, (23)-Syndrome X, (24) ovarian hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovarian syndrome), and other disorders where insulin resistance is a component. In Syndrome X. also known as Metabolic Syndrome, obesity is thought to promote insulin resistance, diabetes.<br><br>
dyslipidemia, hypertension, and increased cardiovascular risk. Therefore, DP-IV inhibitors may also be useful to treat hypertension associated with this condition.<br>
Obesity: DP-IV inhibitors mav be useful for the treatment of obesitv. This is based on the observed inhibitory effects on food intake and gastric emptying of GLP-1 and GLP-2. Exogenous administration of GLP-1 in humans sianificantlv decreases food intake and slows gastric emptying (Am. J. PhvsioL 277: R910-R916 (1999)). ICV administration of GLP-1 ir. rats and mice also has profound effects on food intake (Nature Medicine. 2: 1254-1258 (1996". This inhibition of feeding is not observed in GLP-1 Rc"'~) mice, indicating that these effects arc mediated through brain GLP-1 receptors. By analogy to GLP-i, it is likely that GLP-2 is also regulated by DP-IV. ICV administration of GLP-2 also inhibits food intake, analogous to the effects observed with GLP-1 (Nature Medicine. 6: S02-807 (2000)). In addition, studies with DP-IV deficient mice suggest that these animals are resistant to diet-induced obesity and associated pathology (e.g. hyperinsulinonemia).<br>
Growth Hormone Deficiency. DP-IV inhibition mav be useful for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency, based on the hypothesis that growth-hormone releasing factor (GRF). a peptide that stimulates release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary, is cleaved by the DP-IV enzyme in vivo (WO 00/56297). The following data provide evidence that GRF is an endogenous substrate: (1) GRF is efficiently cleaved in vitro to generate the inactive product GRF[3-44] (BBA 1122: 147-153 (1992)): (2) GRF is rapidly degraded in plasma to GRF[3-44V. this is prevented by the DP-IV inhibitor diprotin A; and (3) GRF[3-44] is found in the plasma of a human GRF transgenic pig (J. Clin. Invest., 83: 1533-1540 (1989)). Thus DP-IV inhibitors may be useful for the same spectrum of indications which have been considered for growth hormone secretasosues.<br>
Intestinal Injury: The potential for using DP-IV inhibitors for the treatment of intestinal injury is suggested by the results of studies indicating that glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), a likely endogenous substrate for DP-IV, may exhibit trophic effects on the intestinal epithelium (Regulatory Peptides, 90: 27-32 (2000)). Administration of GLP-2 results in increased small bowel mass in rodents and attenuates intestinal injury in rodent models of colitis and enteritis.<br>
Immunosuppression: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for modulation of the immune response-based upon studies implicating the DP-IV enzyme in T cell activation and in ehemokine processing, and efficacy of DP-IV inhibitors in in vivo models of disease. DP-IV has been shown<br><br>
to be identical to CD26, a cell surface marker for activated immune cells. The expression o\ CD26 is regulated by the differentiation and activation status of immune cells. It is generally-accepted that CD26 functions as a co-stimulatory molecule in in vitro models of T ceil activation. A number of chemokjnes contain proline in the penultimate position, presumably to protect them from degradation by non-specific aminopeptidases. Many of these have been shown to be processed in vitro by DP-IV. In several cases (RANTES. LD"S-beta, MDC, eotaxin, SDF-lalpha), cleavage results in an altered activity in chemotaxis and signaling assays. Receptor selectivity also appears to be modified in some cases (RANTES). Multiple N-terminally truncated, forms of a number of chemokjnes have been identified in in vitro cell culture systems, including the predicted products of DP-IV hydrolysis.<br>
DP-IV inhibitors have been shown to be efficacious immunosuppressants in animal models of transplantation and arthritis. Prodipine t,Pro-Pro-diphenyl-phosphonate). an irreversible inhibitor of DP-IV, was shown to double cardiac allograft survival in rats from day 7 to day 14 (Transplantation, 63: 1495-1500 (1997)). DP-IV inhibitors have been tested in collagen and alkvldiamine-induced arthritis in rats and showed a statistically significant attenuation of hind paw swelling in this model flnt, J. Immunopharmacologv. 19:15-24 (1997) and Immunopharmacologv, 40: 21-26(1998)]. DP-IV is upregulated in a number of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis. Graves' disease, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Immunology Todav, 20: 367-375 (1999)).<br>
HTV Infection: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of HIV infection or AIDS because a number of chemokines which inhibit HTV' cell entry are potential substrates for DP-IV (Immunology Today 20: 367-375 (1999)). In the case of SDF-lalpha, cleavage decreases antiviral activity (PNAS, 95: 6331-6 (1993)).   Thus, stabilization of SDF-lalpha through inhibition of DP-IV would be expected to decrease HTV infectivity.<br>
Hematopoiesis: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of hematopoiesis because DP-IV may be involved in hematopoiesis. A DP-IV inhibitor, Val-Boro-Pro, stimulated hematopoiesis in a mouse model of cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia (WO 99/56753).<br>
Neuronal Disorders: DP-rv inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of various neuronal or psychiatric disorders because a number of pepiides implicated in a variety of neuronal processes are cleaved in vitro by DP-IV. A DP-IV inhibitor thus may have'a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of neuronal disorders. Endomorphin-2. beta-casomorphin, and substance P have all been shown to be in vitro substrates for DP-IV. In all cases, in vitro<br><br>
cleavage is highly efficient, with kcal/Km about 106 M'Y1 or greater. In an electric shock jump test model of analeesia in rats, a DP-IV inhibitor showed a significant effect that was independent of the presence o^exogenous endomorphin-2 
Neuroptotective and neuroregenerative effects of DP-IV inhibitors were also evidenced by the inhibitors' ability to protect motor neurons from excitotoxie cell death, to protect striatal innervation of dopaminergic neurons when administered concurrently with MPTP, and to promote recovery of striatal innervation density when given in a therapeutic manner following MPTP treatment [see Yong-Q. Wu, et a;.. 'Neuroprotective Effects of Inhibitors of Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IY In Vitro and In Vivo.'* Int. Conf. On Dipentidvl Ammopeptidases: Basic Science and Clinical Applications. September 26-29. 2002 (Berlin. Germany)].<br>
Tumor Invasion and Metastasis: DP-IV 'inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of tumor invasion and metastasis because an increase or decrease in expression of several ectopeptidases including DP-IV has been observed during the transformation of normal cells to a malignant phenotype (J. Exp. Med., 190: 301-305 (1999)). Up- or down-regulation of these proteins appears to be tissue and cell-type specific. For example, increased CD26/DP-IV ..expression has been observed on T cell lymphoma, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, cell-derived thyroid carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, and breast carcinomas. Thus. DP-IV inhibitors may have utility in the treatment of such carcinomas.<br>
Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: DP-TV inhibition may be useful for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy because increased DP-IV activity was noted in prostate tissue from patients with BPH (Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem.. 30: 333-33S (1992)).<br>
Sperm motilitv/male contraception: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the altering sperm motility and for male contraception because in seminal fluid, prostatosomes. prostate derived organelles important for sperm motility, possess very high levels of DP-TV activity (Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem., 30: 333-338 (1992)).<br>
Gingivitis,: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment of gingivitis he:ause DP-IV activity was found in gingival crevicular fluid and in some studies correlated with periodontal disease seventy (Arch. Oral Biol.. 37: 167-173 (1992)).<br><br>
Osteoporosis: DP-TV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis because GIP receptors are present in osteoblasts.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have utility in treating or preventing one or more of the following conditions or diseases: (1) hyperglycemia, (2) low glucose tolerance. 1.5) insulin resistance, (4) obesity, (5) lipid disorders, (6) dyslipidemia, (7) hyperlipemia, i S) hypertriglyceridemia, (9) hypercholesterolemia,   (10) low HDL levels.

Such other drug(s) may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor. contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of Formula I.   When a compound of Formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I is preferred. However, the combination therapy may also include therapies in which the compound of Formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compounds of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly.

Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials are made according to procedures known in the art or as illustrated herein.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared from beta amino acid intermediates such as those of formula II and substituted hexahydrodiazepinone intermediates such as those of formula III, using standard peptide coupling conditions followed by deprotection. The preparation of these intermediates is described in the following Schemes.<br><br><br>
where Ar, Rl. R^. R^, RS. and R? are as defined above and P is a suitable nitrogen protecting group such as tert-butoxycavbonyl t'BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (Chz). or 9-fiaorenylmethoxycarbonyl ( Fmoc).<br><br>
Compounds of formula II are commercially available, known in the literature or may be conveniently prepared by a variety of methods familiar to those skilled in the art. One common route is illustrated in Scheme 1. Protected alpha-amino acid_K which may be commercially available or readily prepared from the corresponding amino acta by protection using, for example, di-f«?rf-butyl dicarbonate (for P = BOC). carbobenzyloxy chloride ('for P = Cbz), or iV-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy)succinimide (for P = Fmoc). is treated with isobu:yl chloroformate and a base such as triethylamine orA^V-diisopropylethylarrune, followed by diazomethane. The resultant diazoketone is then treated with silver benzoate in a solvent such as methanol or aqueous dioxane and may be subjected to sonication following the procedure of Sewald et al., Synthesis, 837 (1997) in order to provide the beta amino acid n. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, for the preparation of enantiomericaily pure beta amino acids n, enantiomericaily pure alpha amino acids I may be used. Alternate routes to the protected beta-amino acid intermediates II can be found in the following reviews: E. Juarisii. Enantioselective Synthesis of fl-Amino Acids, Ed., Wiley-VCH, New York: 1997; Juaristi et aL AldrichimicaActa.27: 3 (1994); and Cole et al.. Tetrahedron. 32: 9517 (1994).<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula 1U are commercially available, known in the literature or may be conveniently prepared by a variety of methods familiar to those skilled in the art. One convenient method wherein Rl is hydrogen is shown in Scheme 2. Ammo ester.2« conveniendy used as its hydrochloride salt, is condensed with acrylonitrile 3 and the amino group of the product formed is protected, for example, as its terr-butoxylcarbonyl (Boc) derivative, to pro*, ide 4. which is reduced to the primary amine 5. Cyclization of 5 to iV-proteered hexahydrodiazepinone 7 can be conducted by using trimethylaluminum. Alternatively, the amino ester 5 can be hydrolyzed to the acid 6 and cyclized bv usins amino acid coupling reasents such as EDC to provide intermediate 7. Deprotection, for example, in the case of Boc. by treatment with acid such as hvdrosen chloride in dioxane or trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane. provides Intermediate DJa.<br><br><br>
An alternate method of preparing hexahydrodiazepinone Ulb (wherein R-. R$. and R9 are hvdrosen) is shown in Scheme 3. a-Ketoaeids S, such as pvruvic acid, can be condensed with an aminopropionitrile 9 to provide the cyanoethyl oxopropanamides 10, which can be reductively cyclized to hexahydrodiazepinone Ulb with a reducing agent such as platinum oxide and hydrogen.<br><br>
Hexafiydrodiazepinone intermediates HI and intermediates for their synthesis can be modified in various ways. For example, the amide nitrogen of intermediate 7. prepared as outlined in Scheme 2, can be alkylated by deprotonation with a base such as sodium hydride<br><br>
followed bv treatment with an alkvl halide as shown in Scheme 4. Deorotection of the resulting intermediate _U provides intermediate HI.<br><br>
Another such example is illustrated in Scheme 5. Protected hexahydrodiazepinone JJ2, which may be prepared as described for Intermediate JJ_ in Scheme 4 wherein R-* and R$ are hydrogen, or by protection of intermediate Ola from Scheme 3 \\ herein R5 is hvdroaen, can be alkylated bv using bases such as LDA followed bv treatment with various alkyl halides. The process may be repeated to install a second alkyl group. RS. Deprotection provides Intermediate m.<br><br><br>
Intermediates II and HI are coupled under standard peptide coupling conditions, for example, using l-ethyI-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and l-hydro\ybenzotria;:ole (EDC/HOBT) or 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-I-yl)-NwVfyV'jV'-tetramethyIuromum hexafluorophosphate and l-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HATU/HOAT) in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or dichloromethane for 3 to 4S hours at ambient temperature to provide Intermediate 13_ as shown in Scheme 6. In some cases, Intermediate HI may be a salt. such as a hydrochloride or trifluoroacetic acid salt, and in these cases it is convenient to add a. base, generally iV.N-diisopropylethylamine, to the coupling reaction. The protecting group is then removed with, for example, trifluoroacetic acid or methanolic hydrogen chloride in the case of Boc to give the desired amine I. The product is purified, if necessary, by recrystallization, trituration, preparative thin layer chromatography, flash chromatography on silica gel. such as with a Biotage® apparatus, or HPLG. Compounds that are purified by HPLC may be isolated as the corresponding salt. Purification of intermediates is achieved'in the same manner.<br>
In some cases the product I or synthetic intermediates illustrated in the above schemes may be further modified, for example, by manipulation of suhstituents on Ar. RK P^4, or<br><br>
RA These manipulations may include, but are not limited to, reduction, oxidation, alleviation, .icvlation. and hydrolysis reactions that are commonly known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In some cases the order of carrying out the foregoing reaction schemes may '^e ■■ aned to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products. The following examples are provided so that the invention might be more fully understood. These examples are illustrative only and should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br><br>
