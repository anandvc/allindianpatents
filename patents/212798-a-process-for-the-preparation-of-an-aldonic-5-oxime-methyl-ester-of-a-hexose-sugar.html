BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to multistep synthesis of a 1,5-dideoxy-l,5-imino hexitol from a ketoaldonic acid methyl ester of a hexose sugar with protected hydroxy1 groups and to novel intermediates In particular the present invention relates to processes which enable the production of novel intermediates to the hexitol and in particular, a ketoaldonic acid methyl ester oxime or alkylimine, which forms the ring structure of the hexitol by alternate routes-<br>
(2)	Description of Related art<br>
Over the last three decades there has been a continued interest in natural and synthetic imino-sugars because of their high potency as glycosidase inhibitors ((a) Grabner, R. W., et al., U.S. Patent No, 5,695,969; (b) Boshagen, H,, etal., U.S. Patent No, 4,940,705; (c) Shilvock, J. P,, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 37 8569-8572 (1996); (d) Rajanikanth, D- B., et al., J.

Res. 26 182-190 (1993); (s) Kajimoto, T., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113 6678-6680 (1991)). Glycosidases catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages and are the key enzymes in the degradation of complex carbohydrates. One of their main metabolic roles is the conversion of complex non-absorbable carbohydrates into absorbable mono- or oligosaccharides (Truscheit, E., et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 20 744-761 (1981)). The rapid action of these enzymes can lead, however, to undesirable elevations in blood glucose in diabetes. Iminosugars have been shown to act as glycosidase inhibitors and to retard and regulate the intestinal carbohydrate digestion. They are therefore excellent drug candidates for diabetes therapy (Liu, P.S., U.S. Patent No. 4,634,765 (1987)).  An even more exciting<br><br>
potential use of iminosugars is in the treatment of cancer and viral diseases (Rohrschneider, L. R,;- et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,837,237 (1989)),  It has been shown that modification of oligosaccharide structures may alter metastatic capacity of cancer cells and 1,5-diimino-1,5-dideoxyglucitol   (deoxynojirimycin)   (1) (Tsuruoka, T., etal-, U.S. Patent No, 5,250,545 (1993)) swainsonine (2) (Dennis, J. W., Cancer Res. 46 5131"'5136 (1986)) and castanospermine (3) (Humphries, M. J,, et al.. Cancer Res. 46 5215-5222 (1986)) (Figure 1.) can markedly inhibit metastasis of cancer cells.   They might, therefore, be used for the effective treatment of cancer.<br><br>
N-Butyl-deoxynoj irimyciin shows excellent activity against herpes virus (Jacob, G. S., et al-, U.S. Patent No. 4,957,926 (1990)) whilst having low cyto-toxicity and no inhibitory effect on the growth of normal cells. The greatest prospect for the use of iminosugars as drugs is probably for the treatment of AIDS. Glycosidase inhibitors prevent the processing of N-1inked complex oligosaccharides. This results in the disruption of the synthesis of viral coat glycoproteins<br><br>
such as the critical one called gpl20.  This supposedly<br>
leads to the loss of recognition by the CD-4 receptor of<br>
the target cell with concomitant reduction of syncytia<br>
formation  resulting  in  the  reduction  of  virus<br>
infectivity and the inhibition of viral replication<br>
(Walker, B. D., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84<br>
8120-8124 (1987); Karpas, A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>

The chemical synthesis of nojirimycin derivatives are generally too involved and not suitable for commercial applications. The chemo-microbiological method patented by Grabner (U.S. Patent No. 5,695,969; U.S. Patent No. 5,610,039)) provides an elegant method for transforming a sugar into its imino-derivative by reductive animation of a 5-keto aldose obtained by bacterial oxidation of glucose. The method is in particular however, not applicable to the D-galacto derivatives of the present invention.<br>

In particular, the present invention relates to methyl~2, 3, 4, 6"tetra-0-acetyl-L-arabino-5-hexulosonic acid oxime 5 (Figure 1) as an intermediate for the synthesis of D-dideoxy galacto nojirimycins 2- The present invention provides a method for the preparation of 1,5-imino-l,5-dideoxy and 1,5,6-triteoxy alditols with the D-galacto configurations starting from |3-glactosides via hexulosonic acid oximes which have not been reported before now. The procedure is especially valuable because of its high stereoselectivity and straightforwardness. The key steps are the reduction of the oxime derivatives to the lactams which is then further reduced to the target compounds. The C6 position can be deoxygenated during the reduction if it bears an acetoxy group. The trideoxy imino sugars are then produced. Deacetylation prior to oxime reduction gives the dideoxy compounds,<br>
The present invention provides a simple access to D-galactonojirimycins from the new oxime intermediate methyl  2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl~L-arabino-5-hexulosonic<br><br>
acid oxime 5. The method also allows access to the 5-amino-5-deoxy-D-galacturonic acid 5-lactams. This also is not known before now although the gluco-isomer has been made by the oxidation of nojirimycin (Kajimoto, T., et al., J, Am. Chem. Soc. 113 6187-6196 (1991)) - In this method, the ketoaldonic acid methyl ester is converted to the previously unreported oxime which is then reduced to the amine which cyclizes to give the lactam. The lactam is reduced to the imino sugar by borane or a metal hydride reagent. (Scheme 1) . Despite the formation of both the cis- and trans oximes, no L-derivatives are formed Reduction of the peracetylated oxime leads to deoxygenation of the 6 position to give the tri-deoxydiiminoalditol (dideoxy-D-gaiacto-nojirimycin 4).<br>
EXAMPLE 1 Methyl-2 ,3 ,4 ,6~tetra-0-acetyl-L-arabino~5~ hexulosonic acid oxime, 5 The ketoaldonic acid 4 (7g, 18-61 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (16 ml) and the solution cooled to 0°C, Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (2 g, 28.77 mmol) was then added and the solution stirred at 0°C for 15 minutes and then for another 2 hours at room temperature. The mixture was poured onto ice and water and then extracted three times with chloroform. The combined chloroform layers were subsequently washed with water, dried with Na2SO4 and then evaporated. Crystallization from hot ethanol gave white crystals of the oxime (85%) as a mixture of cis-trans isomers: 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ  isomer 1:1,98 (s, 3 H, OAc) , 2.01 (s, 3 H,<br><br>

1, 5-imino-l, 5, 6-trideoxy-D~galactlto (dideoxy-D-galacto) nojirimycin, 7. This was prepared from the oxime 5 (7,4 g, 18.92 mmol) by reduction with hydrogen on palladium in acetic acid. The intermediate amino ester was cyclized to form a lactam 6 that was then reduced by borane. Flash column chromatography using a chloroform-methanol (6:1) mixture gave (dideoxy-D-galacto)nojirimycin 7 (1,5 g, 30%): [α]23D+27.0o (c 1.3, CHCI3), lit, + 49.00 (c 1, CHCI3) [20]; 1H NMR (D2O) 5 1.21 (d, 3H, J5, 6 6.6 Hz, H-6), 2.73 (t, IH, Jia,ie=^ia,2 11,9 Hz, H-la), 3.30 (dd, IH, J1e,2 5.4 Hz, H-le) , 3,37 (m, IH, H-5), 3.50 (dd, IH, J2,3 9-6 Hz, J3.4 3,1 Hz, H-3), 3,90 (d, IH, J4.5 3.1 Hz, H-4), 3.91 (ddd, IH, H-2) ; 13C NMR (D2O) 5 14.2, 46.1, 55,0, 64.4, 69.9, 73.1.<br>
Methy1-2,3,4 -e-tetra-O-acetyl-D-xylo-S-hexulosonic acid oximes are intermediates for the preparation of di and tri-deoxynojirimycins, The present invention provides a general method for the preparation of 1,5-imino-l,5-6,trideoxy alditols with the D~gluco configurations starting from the previously unreported methyl-2,3, 4,6-tetra-0-acetyl-D-xylo-5-hexulosonic acid oxime 9   (Figure 2) ,  The key steps are<br><br>
the selective reduction of the oxime derivatives to lactams which are further reduced to the target compounds. The C6 position can be deoxygenated during the reduction if it bears an acetoxy group. The trideoxy imino sugars are then produced. Deacetylation prior to oxime reduction gives the dideoxy compounds-<br>
The present invention provides a simple access to D-gluco nojirimycins from the new oxime intermediate Methy1-2,3,4,6-tetra-0-acetyl-L-arabino-5-hexulosonic acid oxime. The method also allows access to the 5-amino-5-deoxy-D-glucuronic acid 5-lactams. This also is known from the oxidation of nojirimycin (Kajimoto, T., et al., J, Am. Chem. Soc, 113 6187-6196 (1991)). It is an excellent glycosidase inhibitor at concentrations 100 times lower than most of the other inhibitors tested (Kajimoto, T., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113 6187-6196 (1991)) . In the method we describe here the ketoaldonic acid methyl ester is converted to the previously unreported oxime which is then reduced to the amine which cyclizes to give the lactam. The lactam is reduced to the imino sugar by borane or a metal hydride reagent. (Pathway 1)- Despite the formation of both the cis-  and trans oximes, no L-derivatives are formed. Reduction of the peracetylated oxime leads to deoxygenation of the 6 position to give the tri-deoxydiiminoalditol (dideoxy-D-giuco-nojirimycin) 14, Access to the 6-hydroxy derivatives was readily achieved by deacetylating the oxime with hydrazine prior to reduction- The deacetylation yielded the acyl hydrazide in quantitative yield (Pathway 2) .<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
