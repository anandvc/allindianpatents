				<td>MULTIMERIC COMPLEXES OF ANTIGENS AND ADJUVANTS<br>
Introduction.<br>
This invention relates to macromolecular assemblies, such as<br>
fusion proteins, comprising an adjuvant and an antigen, which<br>
assemblies provoke an enhanced immune response to the antigen<br>
in comparison to the antigen alone.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
Adjuvants enhance the immune response to antigens and are<br>
therefore useful in vaccines. However, there are only a<br>
limited number of adjuvants approved for use in humans, and as<br>
stronger adjuvants are known from research on animals, a clear<br>
need exists for stronger immunological adjuvants which are<br>
safe to use in man. For a recent review, see "Advances in<br>
vaccine adjuvants" (Nature Biotechnology, 1999, Volume 17,<br>
pages 1075-1081). A critical feature of any adjuvant for<br>
widespread use in man is that it should be very safe,<br>
particularly if it is to be used in routine prophylaxis in<br>
very large numbers of healthy people.<br>
The complement system consists of a set of serum proteins that<br>
are important in the response of the immune system to foreign<br>
antigens. The complement system becomes activated when its<br>
primary components are cleaved and the products, alone or with<br>
other proteins, activate additional complement proteins<br>
resulting in a proteolytic cascade. Activation of the<br>
complement system leads to a variety of responses including<br>
increased vascular permeability, chemotaxis of phagocytic<br>
cells, activation of inflammatory cells, opsonisation of<br>
foreign particles, direct killing of cells and tissue damage.<br><br>
Activation of the complement system may be triggered by<br>
antigen-antibody complexes (the classical pathway) or a normal<br>
slow activation may be amplified in the presence of cell walls<br>
of invading organisms such as bacteria and viruses (the<br>
alternative pathway). The complement system interacts with<br>
the cellular immune system through a specific pathway<br>
involving C3, a protein central to both classical and<br>
alternative pathways. The proteolytic activation of C3 gives<br>
rise to a large fragment (C3b) and exposes a chemically<br>
reactive internal thiolester linkage which can react<br>
covalently with external nucleophiles such as the cell surface<br>
proteins of invading organisms or foreign cells. As a result,<br>
the potential antigen is "tagged" with C3b and remains<br>
attached to that protein as it undergoes further proteolysis<br>
to iC3b and C3d,g. The latter fragments are, respectively,<br>
ligands for the complement receptors CR3 and CR2; (CR2 is also<br>
referred to as CD21). Thus the labelling of antigen by C3b<br>
can result in a targeting mechanism for cells of the immune<br>
system bearing these receptors.<br>
That such targeting is important for augmentation of the<br>
immune response is first shown by experiments in which mice<br>
were depleted of circulating C3 and then challenged with an<br>
antigen (sheep erythrocytes). Removal of C3 reduced the<br>
antibody response to this antigen (M.B. Pepys, J. Exp. Med.,<br>
140, 126-145, 1974). The role of C3 was confirmed by studies<br>
in animals genetically deficient in either C3 or the upstream<br>
components of the complement cascade which generate C3b, i.e.<br>
C2 and C4 (J.M. Ahearn and D.T. Fearon, Adv. Immunol., 46,<br>
183-219, 1989). More recently, it has been shown that linear<br>
conjugation of a model antigen with more than two copies of<br>
the murine C3d fragment sequence resulted in a very large<br>
(1000-10000-fold) increase in antibody response in mice<br><br>
compared with unmodified antigen controls (P.W. Dempsey et al,<br>
Science, 271, 348-350, 1996; W096/17625, PCT/GB95/02851). The<br>
increase could be produced without the use of conventional<br>
adjuvants such as Freund's complete adjuvant, which is too<br>
toxic to be used in humans. The mechanism of this remarkable<br>
effect was demonstrated to be high-affinity binding of the<br>
multivalent C3d construct to CR2 on B-cells, followed by co-<br>
ligation of CR2 with another B-cell membrane protein, CD19 and<br>
with membrane-bound immunoglobulin to generate a signal to the<br>
B-cell nucleus.<br>
However, it has proved difficult to produce large amounts of<br>
homogenous recombinant proteins containing three copies of<br>
C3d. The principal problems have been :<br>
i) the genetic instability of the constructs containing<br>
(three) repeated sequences and<br>
ii) the folding (or solubilisation and refolding) of the<br>
recombinant protein from inclusion bodies formed in<br>
Escherichia coli.<br>
One approach taken to minimise the genetic instability of<br>
constructs containing repeated copies of the C3d gene is<br>
described in WO99/35260 and WO01/77324. The technology<br>
described in these applications is to use non-identical<br>
sequences of DNA encoding repeats of C3d.<br>
WO00/69907 and WO00/69886, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference, describe polypeptide<br>
monomers capable of assembling into a multimeric form. The<br>
monomers are derived from chaperone proteins, particularly<br>
GroES or Cpn10 family members.<br>
A multimerisation system using the complement 4 binding<br><br>
protein (C4bp) is described in WO 91/114 61. Human C4b-binding<br>
protein (C4BP) is a plasma glycoprotein of high molecular mass<br>
(570 kDa) which has a spider like structure made of seven<br>
identical alpha-chains and a single beta-chain. The C4bp alpha<br>
chain has a C-terminal core region responsible for assembly of<br>
the molecule into a multimer. According to the standard<br>
model, the cysteine at position +4 98 of one C4bp monomer forms<br>
a disulphide bond with the cysteine at position +510 of<br>
another monomer. A minor form comprising only seven alpha-<br>
chains has also been found in human plasma. The natural<br>
function of this plasma glycoprotein is to inhibit the<br>
classical pathway of complement activation.<br>
WO 91/11461 proposes that the ability of the C4bp protein to<br>
multimerise can be used to make fusion proteins comprising all<br>
or part of C4bp and a biological protein of interest. The<br>
fusion protein will form multimers which provides a platform<br>
for the protein of interest, in which said protein has an<br>
enhanced serum half-life and increased affinity or avidity for<br>
its targets'. Fusion proteins of C4bp were targeted as the<br>
focus of novel delivery and carrier systems for therapeutic<br>
products in WO 91/11461.<br>
Most of the alpha-chain of C4bp is composed of eight tandemly<br>
arranged domains of approximately 60 amino acids in length<br>
known as complement control protein (CCP) repeats. Inclusion<br>
of one or more of these domains was preferred in the fusion<br>
proteins described in WO 91/114 61, but it has since been<br>
demonstrated that all CCPs can be deleted (leaving only the C-<br>
terminal 57 amino acids) without preventing multimerisation<br>
(Libyh M. T. et al., (1997) Blood, 90, 3978-3983). This C-<br>
terminal region of C4bp is referred to as the C4bp core.<br><br>
Libyh et al., (1997), describe a protein multimerisation<br>
system which is based on the C-terminal part of the alpha<br>
chain of C4bp. The C-terminal part of the C4bp lacks lacks the<br>
ability to inhibit the classical pathway of complement<br>
activation, but is responsible for polymerisation of C4bp in<br>
the cytoplasm of CHO cells producing C4bp. Libyh et al. were<br>
able to induce spontaneous multimerisation of associated<br>
antibody fragments to create homomultimers of scFv fragments<br>
using the C4bp fragment. The C-terminal portion of C4bp used<br>
was placed C-terminal to the scFv sequence, optionally spaced<br>
by a MYC tag.<br>
The use of C4bp is also described in Oudin et al. (2000,<br>
Journal of Immunology, Vol. 164:1505) and Christiansen et al.<br>
(2000, Journal of Virology, Vol. 74:4672). Self-assembling<br>
multimeric soluble CD4-C4bp fusion protein have also been<br>
demonstrated in Shinya et al (1999, Biomed &amp; Pharmacother,<br>
Vol. 53: 471) where the fusion proteins were expressed in the<br>
human 2 93 cell line.<br>
Summary of the Invention.<br>
The present invention provides a product comprising:<br>
a first component which is a scaffold;<br>
a second component which is an adjuvant, preferably a<br>
polypeptide which is a ligand for CD21 or a cell surface<br>
molecule on B cells or T cells or follicular dendritic or<br>
other antigen presenting cells; and<br>
a third component which is an antigen.<br>
The first component provides for assembly of multiple copies<br>
of the second component in a multi-component product such that<br>
the multiple copies of the second component are associated<br><br>
with one or more copies of the antigen.<br>
In a preferred aspect, the invention provides:<br>
a first component which is a polypeptide scaffold;<br>
a second component which is a polypeptide which is a<br>
ligand for CD21 or a cell surface molecule on B cells or T<br>
cells or on follicular dendritic or other antigen presenting<br>
cells; and<br>
a third component which is an antigen.<br>
The first and second components may be in the form of a fusion<br>
protein. When the third component is also a polypeptide, the<br>
three components are present as a fusion protein.<br>
Alternatively the third component is covalently linked to a<br>
fusion of the first two components.<br>
In some cases, where the first component is itself an antigen,<br>
the first and third components may be the same molecule.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, the designation of "first",<br>
"second" and "third" components does not imply or indicate a<br>
specific linear order in the product of the three components.<br>
The three components may be joined in any order.<br>
Thus where all three components are polypeptides and the<br>
product is made as a fusion protein, the N- to C- terminal<br>
order of the three components may be in any permutation.<br>
Further, as indicated below, in some cases the first component<br>
may include loop regions which can be replaced by one or other<br>
of the second and third components.<br>
The product of the present invention provides for the<br>
immunostimulatory second component to be formed into a multi-<br><br>
component product, and to be expressed using recombinant DNA<br>
technology without the need to use DNA sequences having tandem<br>
repeat sequences.<br>
The invention further provides nucleic acid encoding a fusion<br>
protein of said first and second components and, where said<br>
third component is a polypeptide, nucleic acid encoding all<br>
three components. The invention also provides vectors<br>
comprising said nucleic acids and host cells carrying said<br>
vectors.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of<br>
making a product comprising:<br>
a first component which is a polypeptide scaffold;<br>
a second component which is a polypeptide which is a<br>
ligand for CD21 or a cell surface molecule on B cells or T<br>
cells or follicular dendritic or other antigen presenting<br>
cells; and<br>
a third component which is a polypeptide antigen,<br>
the method comprising expressing nucleic acid encoding the<br>
three components in the form of a fusion protein, and<br>
recovering the product.<br>

the method comprising expressing nucleic acid encoding the<br>
first and second components in the form of a fusion protein,<br><br>
joining said fusion protein to the third component, and<br>
recovering the product.<br>
The methods of making the product may be performed in<br>
eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells.<br>
The invention also provides a method of inducing an immune<br>
response to an antigen which method comprises administering to<br>
a subject an effective amount of a product according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention also provides the use of a product of the<br>
invention for a method of treatment of the human or animal<br>
body, particularly a method of inducing an immune response.<br>
The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a product of the invention in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention.<br>
Scaffold<br>
This refers to any macromolecular assembly which is capable of<br>
being a scaffold to which the second and third components may<br>
be attached. It may be a protein or other polymeric molecule<br>
(composed for example of sugars) or a prokaryotic or<br>
eukaryotic cell wall or a virus. The cell walls, or viruses<br>
or proteins may be incomplete, that is lacking components<br>
normally present in the organism in which it is found; the<br>
important feature for this invention is that the scaffold is<br>
capable of uniting into a single assembly more than one<br>
adjuvant molecule and more that one antigen molecule.<br>
As is described in more detail herein, there are two main<br>
classes of scaffold contemplated. The first is a complex<br>
macromolecular product, including a virus or cell, onto which<br>
multiple copies of the second and, where applicable, third<br>
component are attached, either separately or as a fusion of<br>
the second and third components. Alternatively, the scaffold<br>
is present in a 1:1 ratio with the second component. When the<br>
product is in the form of a fusion protein then the third<br>
component is also present in a 1:1:1 ratio with the second and<br>
first components.<br><br>
Cell wall or viral scaffolds are known in the art for other<br>
purposes. Surface display of proteins, whether on prokaryotic<br>
(Samuelson et al., 2002, J. Biotechnol 96,129-154; Lang H.,<br>
2001, Nat. Biotechnol.,19, 75-78) or eukaryotic cell walls<br>
(Shusta E.V. et al., 1999, J. Mol. Biol. 292, 949-956) or<br>
viruses, such as bacteriophages (Sidhu S.S., 2001, Biomol.<br>
Eng.,18, 57-63) have been described. The distinctive feature<br>
of this aspect of the invention is that the objects displayed<br>
on the cell wall include more than one copy of an adjuvant<br>
molecule simultaneously present with an antigen. The antigen<br>
may be fused directly to the adjuvant (such as C3d), but need<br>
not be.<br>
Thus in one embodiment, the surface of a cell, such as a<br>
bacterium, can serve as the scaffold. When the adjuvant is<br>
fused genetically to a second component normally expressed on.<br>
the surface of the bacterium, multiple copies of the adjuvant<br>
are displayed on the surface of the bacterium. This has the<br>
effect of eliciting an improved immune response against the<br>
bacterium, when the bacterium infects a host. The antigen may<br>
be the cell wall of the bacterium, or an antigen separately<br>
but simultaneously expressed on the surface of the bacterium.<br>
The infection may be deliberate, by the administration of the<br>
modified bacterium to the host. The bacterium may be<br>
administered either after being killed, or in a live but<br>
attenuated form.<br>
Similarly, eukaryotic cells may be used as the scaffold. In<br>
such a case, the cell surface displaying more than one copy of<br>
the adjuvant can be used to elicit an immune response to other<br>
(normal or abnormal) cell surface components.<br>
In contrast to the fusion proteins described in W096/17625,<br><br>
(PCT/GB95/02851), there need not be a covalent linkage either<br>
at all between the antigen and adjuvant, or the covalent<br>
linkage may only be indirect, being mediated by the scaffold.<br>
Furthermore, W096/17625 teaches that the fusion of a single<br>
copy of the C3d protein to an antigen decreases the immune<br>
response to that antigen. In this invention, in direct<br>
contrast, either the display of multiple single (monomeric)<br>
copies of the adjuvant, or the fusion of a single copy of the<br>
antigen to a single copy of the adjuvant, which are then fused<br>
to a scaffold, results in an increased immune response to the<br>
antigen.<br>
The antigen may be the cell wall itself or a second protein or<br>
glycoprotein. In the case of organisms where the protective<br>
antigen is the capsule, as in the case of pneumococci, the<br>
display of more than one copy of the adjuvant will improve the<br>
immune response to the capsular antigens.<br>
In the case of viruses, the antigen may be the virus itself,<br>
which thus acts simultaneously as antigen and scaffold. An<br>
example is provided of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen.<br>
Methods for preparing a recombinant HBsAg vaccine are<br>
described in United States Patent 4,769,238. Although this<br>
recombinant HBsAg is a very successful vaccine, there remain a<br>
substantial number of vaccine recipients who are "poor<br>
responders". The addition of a new adjuvant to this existing<br>
vaccine will enable the vaccination of such poor responders,<br>
and the post-infection vaccination of chronic carriers of this<br>
virus. One method envisaged of adding the adjuvant to this<br>
vaccine is the genetic fusion of the coding sequence of the an<br>
adjuvant protein, such as and preferably the human C3d<br>
protein, to the C-terminus of the gene encoding the 226 amino<br>
acid residue protein that is the S protein of the hepatitis B<br><br>
virus. The coding sequence for the adjuvant can be added,<br>
optimally with codons preferred for high-level expression in<br>
yeast, in-frame to the S protein coding sequence present in<br>
the plasmids described in the United States Patent 4,769,238<br>
referred to above. The sequence of the S protein may be<br>
modified to include variant sequences, known as "escape<br>
mutants" (Cooreman M.P. et al., 2001, J. Biomed. Sci. 8, 237r-<br>
24 7) or antigens not normally found in the hepatitis B vaccine<br>
(Fomsgaard A. et al. 1998, Scand. J. Immunol., 47, 289-295).<br>
As described in that article, the modified vaccine containing<br>
the C3d adjuvant can be administered as DNA in order to obtain<br>
an immune response.<br>
Thus in another embodiment, the polypeptide scaffold may be<br>
itself an antigen. Thus the surface antigen of hepatitis B<br>
virus, which assembles into oligomeric structures, can<br>
simultaneously be the first and third component of the<br>
invention. As first remarked on in 1956 (FHC Crick, JD<br>
Watson, Nature, 177, 473) the finite nucleic acid content of<br>
viruses severely restricts the number of amino acids that<br>
viruses can encode. As a consequence, the protein coat can<br>
not be constructed from a very large number of different<br>
protein molecules. Instead it must be constructed from a<br>
number of identical small sub-units arranged in a regular<br>
manner. Thus most viruses will be capable of simultaneously<br>
being both the first and third component of the invention.<br>
A polypeptide scaffold is a protein, or part thereof, whose<br>
function is to determine the structure of the protein itself,<br>
or of a group of associated proteins or other molecules.<br>
Polypeptide scaffolds therefore have a defined three-<br>
dimensional structure when assembled, and have the capacity to<br>
support molecules or polypeptides - in or on the said<br><br>
structure. Advantageously, a scaffold has the ability to<br>
assume a variety of viable geometries, in relation to the<br>
three-dimensional structure of the scaffold and/or the<br>
insertion site of the polypeptides.<br>
In another embodiment, the scaffold may serve as the adjuvant,<br>
i.e. the first and second components will be the same. The<br>
scaffold which is an adjuvant may be a C4bp core protein or a<br>
fragment of the C4bp alpha chain, described in further detail<br>
herein.<br>
In one embodiment, the scaffold is a cochaperonin Cpn10/Hsp10<br>
scaffold. Cpn10 is a widespread component of the Cpn60/Cpnl0<br>
chaperonin system. Examples of Cpn10 include human<br>
mitochondrial Cpn10, bacterial GroES and bacteriophage T4<br>
Gp31. Further members of the Cpn10 family will be known to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
The invention moreover comprises the use of derivatives of<br>
naturally-occurring scaffolds. Derivatives of scaffolds<br>
(including scaffolds of the Cpn10 and 60 families) comprise<br>
mutants thereof, which may contain amino acid deletions,<br>
additions or substitutions (especially replacement of Cys<br>
residues in Gp31), hybrids formed by fusion of different<br>
members of the Cpn10 or Cpn60 families and/or circular<br>
permutated protein scaffolds, subject to the maintenance of<br>
the "oligomerisation" property described herein.<br>
Polypeptide scaffolds assemble to form a multimeric product.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the multimeric<br>
product may have any shape and may comprise any number of<br>
individual scaffold units.<br><br>
Preferably, the mutimeric product comprises between 2 and 20<br>
scaffold units, advantageously between 5 and 15 units, and<br>
ideally about 10 units. The scaffold of Cpn10 family members<br>
comprises seven protein units, in the shape of a seven-<br>
membered ring or annulus. Advantageously, therefore, the<br>
multimeric product is a seven-membered ring.<br>
It is known that Cpn10 subunits possess a "mobile loop" within<br>
their structure. The mobile loop is positioned between amino<br>
acids 15 and 34, preferably between amino acids 16 to 33, of<br>
the sequence of Escherichia coli GroES, and equivalent<br>
positions on other members of the Cpn10 family. The mobile<br>
loop of T4 Gp31 is located between residues 22 to 45,<br>
advantageously 23 to 44. The polypeptide sequence of the<br>
second or third component may be inserted by replacing all or<br>
part of the mobile loop of a Cpn10 family polypeptide.<br>
Where the polypeptide scaffold is a Cpn10 family polypeptide,<br>
the second or third component polypeptide may moreover be<br>
incorporated at the N or C terminus thereof, (which terminus<br>
may be the natural or a modified N or C terminus) or in<br>
positions which are equivalent to the roof beta hairpin of<br>
Cpn10 family peptides. This position is located between<br>
positions 54 and 67, advantageously 55 to 66, and preferably<br>
59 to 61 of bacteriophage T4 Gp31, or between positions 43 to<br>
63, preferably 44 to 62, advantageously 56 to 57 of E. coli<br>
GroES.<br>
In another embodiment, the polypeptide scaffold may be a C4bp<br>
protein or part thereof retaining the C4bp core protein<br>
region.<br>
Human C4 binding protein (hC4bp) is a molecule possessing many<br><br>
attractive characteristics as a delivery vehicle for bioactive<br>
molecules. Human C4bp is involved in the human complement<br>
system - a group of immune system proteins whose functions<br>
include lysing invading cells, activating phagocytic cells and<br>
facilitating the clearance of foreign substances from the<br>
system. It regulates the activity of proteins in this system,<br>
particularly C4 protein. Structurally, hC4bp is a flexible,<br>
disulfide-bonded molecule expected to have long serum half-<br>
life and the ability to target bioactive molecules to the<br>
lymph nodes. The serum form of hC4bp has a molecular weight of<br>
about 590 kD. On reducing SDS gels, hC4bp produces a strong<br>
band at about 70 kD, indicating a disulfide-bonded multimeric<br>
protein.<br>
A cDNA encoding the C4bp monomer has been cloned and<br>
characterized [L.P. Chung et al., (1985) "Molecular Cloning<br>
and Characterization of the cDNA Coding for C4b-Binding<br>
Protein of the Classical Pathway of the Human Complement<br>
System", Biochem. J., 230, 133-141 ]. Chung et al. refers to<br>
hC4bp as a polypeptide of 54 9 amino acids. The polypeptide<br>
predicted from the DNA sequence has a molecular weight of<br>
about 61.5 kD, rather than 70 kD as actually measured on<br>
reducing SDS gels. The difference in molecular weight<br>
apparently is due to glycosylation of the serum form of the<br>
polypeptide. The first 4 91 amino acids from the N-terminus of<br>
the Chung et al. sequence are divisible into eight domains<br>
called short consensus repeat regions (SCRs) of about sixty<br>
amino acids each. These regions are designated, from N-<br>
terminus to C-terminus, SCR8 to SCR1. The SCR domains are<br>
defined as follows: SCR8 - +1 to +61; SCR7 - +62 to +123; SCR6<br>
-	+124 to +187; SCR5 - +188 to +247; SCR4 - +248 to +313; SCR3<br>
-	+314 to +374; SCR2 - +375 to +432; SCRl - +433 to +491.<br>
These domains, which share significant sequence homology, each<br><br>
contain four similarly situated cysteine residues. These<br>
cysteine residues form intra-domain disulfide bonds in a<br>
regular pattern [J. Janatova et al.r (1989) "Disulfide Bonds<br>
Are Localized Within the Short Consensus Repeat Units of<br>
Complement Regulatory Proteins: C4b-Binding Protein",<br>
Biochemistry, 28, 4754-47 61 ]. Within each SCR domain, the<br>
first cysteine residue bonds with the third and the second<br>
cysteine residue bonds with the fourth, forming a double-loop<br>
amino acid sequence. Thus, the SCRs are connected like beads<br>
on a string. This pattern of intra-domain disulfide bonding is<br>
responsible for the conformational flexibility of the C4bp<br>
monomer. In addition to the eight SCR domains, hC4bp also has<br>
a 57 amino acid sequence at the C-terminus, the C4bp core,<br>
which bears no homology to the other regions of the protein.<br>
This region is responsible for assembly of the molecule into a<br>
multimer.<br>
Thus the polypeptide scaffold may be a C4bp core and<br>
optionally one or more SCRs fused to the core.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the polypeptide<br>
scaffold is the core protein of C4bp alpha chain.<br>
A polypeptide scaffold may additionally comprise N- or C-<br>
terminal extensions such as flexible linkers such as (Glym-<br>
Ser)n (where m and n -are from 1 to 4) . These are used in the<br>
art to attach protein domains (particularly antibody V<br>
domains) to each other. Thus the first component may be<br>
linked to the second and/or third component by such a linker.<br>
It is preferred that the first component is at the C-terminal<br>
of the product, when the core protein of C4bp alpha chain is<br>
the scaffold.<br><br>
Core protein of C4bp alpha, chain.<br>
This is referred to herein as the "C4bp core protein" or "core<br>
protein", or "C4bp scaffold". The terms are used<br>
interchangeably. This protein may be a mammalian C4bp core<br>
protein or a fragment thereof capable of forming multimers, or<br>
a synthetic variant thereof capable of forming multimers.<br>
The sequences of a number of mammalian C4bp proteins are<br>
available in the art. These include human C4bp core protein<br>
(SEQ ID N0:1). There are a number of homologues of human C4bp<br>
core protein available in the art. There are two types of<br>
homologue: orthologues and paralogues. Orthologues are defined<br>
as homologous genes in different organisms, i.e. the genes<br>
share a common ancestor coincident with the speciation event<br>
that generated them. Paralogues are defined as homologous<br>
genes in the same organism derived from a gene, chromosome or<br>
genome duplication, i.e. the common ancestor of the genes<br>
occurred since the last speciation event.<br>
For example, a search of GenBank indicates mammalian C4bp core<br>
homologue proteins in species including rabbit, rat, mouse and<br>
bovine origin (SEQ ID NO:2-5 respectively). Paralogues have<br>
been identified in pig (ApoR), guinea pig (AM67) and mouse<br>
(ZP3); shown as SEQ ID NO:6-8 respectively.<br>
An alignment of SEQ ID N0s:l-8 is shown as Figure 1. It can<br>
be seen that all eight sequences have a high degree of<br>
similarity, though with a greater degree of variation at the<br>
C-terminal end. Further C4bp core proteins may be identified<br>
by searching databases of DNA or protein sequences, using<br>
commonly available search programs such as BLAST.<br>
Where a C4bp protein from a desired mammalian source is not<br><br>
available in a database, it may be obtained using routine<br>
cloning methodology well established in the art. In essence,<br>
such techniques comprise using nucleic acid encoding one of<br>
the available C4bp core proteins as a probe to recover and to<br>
determine the sequence of the C4bp core proteins from other<br>
species of interest. A wide variety of techniques are<br>
available for this, for example PCR amplification and cloning<br>
of the gene using a suitable source of mRNA (e.g. from an<br>
embryo or an actively dividing differentiated or tumour cell),<br>
or by methods comprising obtaining a cDNA library from the<br>
mammal, e.g. a cDNA library from one of the above-mentioned<br>
sources, probing said library with a known C4bp nucleic acid<br>
under conditions of medium to high stringency (for example<br>
0.03M sodium chloride and 0.03M sodium citrate at from about<br>
50°C to about 60°C), and recovering a cDNA encoding all or<br>
part of the C4bp protein of that mammal. Where a partial cDNA<br>
is obtained, the full length coding sequence may be determined<br>
by primer extension techniques.<br>
A fragment of a C4bp core protein capable of forming multimers<br>
may comprise at least 47 amino acids, preferably at least 50<br>
amino acids. The ability of the fragment to form multimers<br>
may be tested by expressing the fragment in a prokaryotic host<br>
cell according to the invention, and recovering the C4bp<br>
fragment under conditions which result in multimerisation of<br>
the full 57 amino acid C4bp core, and determining whether the<br>
fragment also forms multimers. Desirably a fragment of C4bp<br>
core comprises at least residues 6-52 of SEQ ID NO:l or the<br>
corresponding residues of its homologues.<br>
The human C4bp core protein of SEQ ID NO:l corresponds to<br>
amino acids +493 to +549 of full length C4bp protein sequence.<br>
A fragment of this known in the art to form multimers<br><br>
corresponds to amino acids +498 to +549 of C4bp core protein.<br>
Variants of C4bp core and fragments capable of forming<br>
multimers, which variants likewise retain the ability to form<br>
multimers (which may be determined as described above for<br>
fragments) may also be used. The variant will preferably have<br>
at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, even more<br>
preferably at least 90%, for example at least 95% or most<br>
preferably at least 98% sequence identity to a wild type<br>
mammalian C4bp core or a multimer-forming fragment thereof.<br>
In one aspect, the C4bp core will be a core which includes the<br>
two cysteine residues which appear at positions 6 and 18 of<br>
SEQ ID Nos:l-3 and 5-8. Desirably, the variant will retain<br>
the relative spacing between these two residues.<br>
The above-specified degree of identity will be to any one of<br>
SEQ ID NOs::l-8 or a multimer-forming fragment thereof.<br>
Most preferably the specified degree of identity will be to<br>
SEQ ID N0:1 or a multimer-forming fragment thereof.<br>
The degree of sequence identity may be determined by the<br>
algorithm GAP, part of the "Wisconsin package" of algorithms<br>
widely used in the art and available from Accelrys (formerly<br>
Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) . GAP uses the Needleman<br>
and Wunsch algorithm to align two complete sequences in a way<br>
that maximises the number of matches and minimises the number<br>
of gaps. GAP is useful for alignment of short closely related<br>
sequences of similar length, and thus is suitable for<br>
determining if a sequence meets the identity levels mentioned<br>
above. GAP may be used with default parameters.<br>
Synthetic variants of a mammalian C4bp core protein include<br><br>
those with one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or<br>
insertions or additions to the C- or N-termini. Substitutions<br>
are particularly envisaged. Substitutions include<br>
conservative substitutions. Examples of conservative<br>
substitutions include those set out in the following table,<br>
where amino acids on the same block in the second column and<br>
preferably in the same line in the third column may be<br>
substituted for each other:<br><br>
Examples of fragments and variants of the C4bp core protein<br>
which may be made and tested for their ability to form<br>
multimers thus include SEQ ID NOs: 9 to 16, shown in Table 1<br>
below:<br><br>
A=SEQ ID NO:; B= sequence, C= % identity, calculated by<br>
reference to a fragment of SEQ ID N0:1 of the same length.<br>
where deletions of the sequence are made, apart from N- or C-<br><br>
terminal truncations, these will preferably be limited to no<br>
more than one, two or three deletions which may be contiguous<br>
or non-contiguous.<br>
Where insertions are made, or N- or C-terminal extensions to<br>
the core protein sequence, these will also be desirably<br>
limited in number so that the size of the core protein does<br>
not exceed the length of the wild type sequence by more than<br>
20, preferably by more than 15, more preferably no more than<br>
10, amino acids. Thus in the case of SEQ ID NO:l, the core<br>
protein, when modified by insertion or elongation, will<br>
desirably be no more than 77 amino acids in length.<br>
Second component.<br>
The product, of the invention will comprise the scaffold as<br>
described above linked to the second component either directly<br>
or indirectly and the third component.<br>
The second component may be any ligand for CD21 or CD19, as<br>
described in US-A-6,238,670, and WO99./35260, the contents of<br>
which are hereby incorporated by reference. The second<br>
component may also be a ligand for a cell surface molecule on<br>
B cells or T cells or follicular dendritic or other antigen<br>
presenting cells.<br>
Preferably, the second component is C3d, particularly human<br>
C3d.<br>
The nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of<br>
mouse C3d are disclosed in Domdey et al. (1982) Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 79: 7619-7623 and Fey et al. (1983) Ann. N.Y.<br>
Acad. Sci. 421: 307-312). The nucleotide sequence and<br>
predicted amino acid sequence for human C3d are disclosed in<br><br>
de Bruijn and Fey (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Scl. USA 82:708-<br>
712. Nucleic acid encoding C3d from other species may be<br>
isolated using the human or mouse sequence information to<br>
prepare one or more probes for use in standard hybridisation<br>
methods. When C3d is to be employed in the invention and<br>
administered to a subject, the C3d may be matched to the<br>
species to be immunised (e.g. mouse C3d to be used in mouse,<br>
human C3d in human and so on) . Furthermore, the codons chosen<br>
may also be optimised for the species to be immunised, for<br>
example using codons that are efficiently translated in<br>
mammalian hosts.<br>
Where the second component is linked by a peptide linker to<br>
the first and/or third component, the linker may be a flexible<br>
linker as described above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the second component is N-terminal<br>
to the first component, and C-terminal to the antigen (where<br>
the antigen is a polypeptide) when the scaffold is the C4bp<br>
core protein. Where the antigen is not a polypeptide, the<br>
antigen may be covalently linked to either of the first or<br>
second components.<br>
Antigen.<br>
Antigens may be any product of prophylactic value; they might<br>
be useful for vaccination. The invention allows rapid<br>
progress from nucleotide sequences to the production of<br>
recombinant antigens attached to an adjuvant in a polyvalent<br>
form.<br>
Bacterial immunogens, parasitic immunogens and viral<br>
immunogens are useful as polypeptide moieties to create<br>
multimeric or hetero-multimeric C4bp fusion proteins useful as<br><br>
vaccines.<br>
Bacterial sources of these immunogens include those<br>
responsible for bacterial pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia,<br>
meningitis, cholera, tetanus, tuberculosis and leprosy.<br>
Parasitic sources include malarial parasites, such as<br>
Plasmodium.<br>
Viral sources include poxviruses, e.g., cowpox virus and orf<br>
virus; herpes viruses, e.g., herpes simplex virus type 1 and<br>
2, B-virus, varicellazoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and<br>
Epstein-Barr virus; adenoviruses, e.g., mastadenovirus;<br>
papovaviruses, e.g., papillomaviruses such as HPV16, and<br>
polyomaviruses such as BK and JC virus; parvoviruses, e.g.,<br>
adeno-associated virus; reoviruses, e.g., reoviruses 1, 2 and<br>
3; orbiviruses, e.g., Colorado tick fever; rotaviruses, e.g.,<br>
human rotaviruses; alphaviruses, e.g., Eastern encephalitis<br>
virus and. Venezuelan encephalitis virus; rubiviruses, e.g.,<br>
rubella; flaviviruses, e.g., yellow fever virus, Dengue fever<br>
viruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, Tick-borne encephalitis<br>
virus and hepatitis C virus; coronaviruses, e.g., human<br>
coronaviruses; paramyxoviruses, e.g., parainfluenza 1, 2, 3<br>
and 4 and mumps; morbilliviruses, e.g., measles virus;<br>
pneumovirus, e.g., respiratory syncytial virus;<br>
vesiculoviruses, e.g., vesicular stomatitis virus;<br>
lyssaviruses, e.g., rabies virus; orthomyxoviruses, e.g.,<br>
influenza A and B; bunyaviruses e.g., LaCrosse virus;<br>
phleboviruses, e.g., Rift Valley fever virus; nairoviruses,<br>
e.g., Congo hemorrhagic fever virus; hepadnaviridae, e.g.,<br>
hepatitis B; arenaviruses, e.g., 1cm virus, Lasso virus and<br>
Junin virus; retroviruses, e.g., HTLV I, HTLV II, HIV-1 and<br>
HIV-2; enteroviruses, e.g., polio virus 1,- 2 and 3, coxsackie<br><br>
viruses, echoviruses, human enteroviruses, hepatitis A virus,<br>
hepatitis E virus, and Norwalk-virus; rhinoviruses e.g., human<br>
rhinovirus; and filoviridae, e.g., Marburg (disease) virus and<br>
Ebola virus.<br>
Antigens from these bacterial, viral and parasitic sources may<br>
be used in the production of multimeric proteins useful as<br>
vaccines. The multimers may comprise a mixture of monomers<br>
carrying different antigens.<br>
Immunogens to human proteins for research or therapeutic<br>
purposes may be made. These have many applications not only<br>
in vaccination but also in research. For example, the<br>
generation of human gene sequence data by the human genome<br>
project has made the generation of antisera reactive to new<br>
polypeptides a pressing requirement. The same requirement<br>
applies to prokaryotic, such as bacterial, and other<br>
eukaryotic, including fungal, gene products.<br>
Non-polypeptide immunogens may be, for example, carbohydrates<br>
or nucleic acids. The polysaccharide coats of Neisseria<br>
species or of Streptococcus pneumoniae species are examples of<br>
carbohydrates which may be used for the purposes of the<br>
invention.<br>
The antigen may be any size conventional in the art for<br>
vaccines, ranging from small polypeptides to larger proteins.<br>
Due to the nature of the present invention, antigens of up to<br>
100 kDa, and more preferably up to 50 kDa, such as up to 30<br>
kDa in size are preferred.<br>
Where a non-polypeptide immunogen is part of the product of<br>
the invention, the immunogen may be covalently attached to the<br><br>
first and second components of the product using routine<br>
synthetic methods. Generally, the immunogen may be attached<br>
to either the N- or C-terminal of a fusion protein comprising<br>
the first and second components, or to an amino acid side<br>
chain group (for example the epsilon-amino group of lysine),<br>
or a combination thereof. More than one immunogen per fusion<br>
protein may be added. To facilitate the coupling, a cysteine<br>
residue may be added to the fusion protein, for example as the<br>
C-terminus.<br>
The present invention has many advantages in the generation of<br>
an immune response. For example, the use of multimers can<br>
permit the presentation of a number of antigens,<br>
simultaneously, to the immune system. This allows the<br>
preparation of polyvalent vaccines, capable of raising an<br>
immune response to more than one epitope, which may be present<br>
on a single organism or a number of different organisms. Thus,<br>
vaccines formed according to the invention may be used for<br>
simultaneous vaccination against more than one disease, or to<br>
target simultaneously a plurality of epitopes on a given<br>
pathogen. The epitopes may be present in a single monomer<br>
units or on different monomer units which are combined to<br>
provide a heteromultimer.<br>
Human C4bp core fusion proteins or human Cpn10 fusion proteins<br>
in particular are useful in the context of immunisations,<br>
because the core protein and human Cpn10 are not only present<br>
normally in the serum or plasma of the recipient of the<br>
immunisation, but also because they do not themselves evoke an<br>
immune response. C4bp proteins are known in a number of<br>
mammalian species, and the appropriate homologues for<br>
mammalian species may be found by those skilled in the art<br>
using standard gene cloning techniques.<br><br>
Nucleic Acids.<br>
Products of the invention may be produced by expression of a<br>
fusion protein of at least the first and second components in<br>
a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell, using a nucleic acid<br>
construct encoding the protein. Where the third component is<br>
a polypeptide, the expression of all three components from a<br>
nucleic acid sequence can be used to produce a product of the<br>
invention.<br>
Thus the invention provides a nucleic acid construct,<br>
generally DNA or RNA, which encodes a product of the<br>
invention.<br>
The construct will generally be in the form of a replicable<br>
vector, in which sequence encoding the protein is operably<br>
linked to a promoter suitable for expression of the protein in<br>
a desired host cell.<br>
The vectors may be provided with an origin of replication and<br>
optionally a regulator of the promoter. The vectors may<br>
contain one; or more selectable marker genes. There are a wide<br>
variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression vectors known<br>
as such in the art, and the present invention may utilise any<br>
vector according to the individual preferences of those of<br>
skill in the art.<br>
A wide variety of prokaryotic host cells can be used in the<br>
method of the present invention. These hosts may include<br>
strains of Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Lactobacillus,<br>
Thermophilus, Salmonella, Enterobacteriacae or Streptomyces.<br>
For example, if E. coli from the genera Escherichia is used in<br>
the method of the invention, preferred strains of this<br>
bacterium to use would include BL21(DE3) and their derivatives<br><br>
including C41(DE3), C43(DE3) or C0214(DE3), as described and<br>
made available in WO98/02559.<br>
Even more preferably, derivatives of these strains lacking the<br>
prophage DE3 may be used when the promoter is not the T7<br>
promoter.<br>
Prokaryotic vectors includes vectors bacterial plasmids, e.g.,<br>
plasmids derived from E. coli including ColEI, pCRl, pBR322,<br>
pMB9 and their derivatives, wider host range plasmids, e.g.,<br>
RP4; phage DNAs, e.g., the numerous derivatives of phage A,<br>
e.g., NM989, and other DNA phages, e.g., M13 and filamentous<br>
single stranded DNA phages. These and other vectors may be<br>
manipulated using standard recombinant DNA methodology to<br>
introduce a nucleic acid of the invention operably linked to a<br>
promoter.<br>
The promoter may be an inducible promoter. Suitable promoters<br>
include the T7 promoter, the tac promoter, the trp promoter,<br>
the lambda promoters PL or PR and others well known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
A wide variety of eukaryotic host cells may also be used,<br>
including for example yeast, insect and mammalian cells.<br>
Mammalian cells include CHO and mouse cells, African green<br>
monkey cells, such as COS-1, and human cells.<br>
Many eukaryotic vectors suitable for expression of proteins<br>
are known. These vectors may be designed to be chromosomally<br>
incorporated into a eukaryotic cell genome or to be maintained<br>
extrachromosomally, or to be maintained only transiently in<br>
eukaryotic cells. The nucleic acid may be operably linked to<br>
a suitable promoter, such as a strong viral promoter including<br><br>
a CMV promoter, and SV40 T-antigen promoter or a retroviral<br>
LTR.<br>
To obtain a product of the invention, host cells carrying a<br>
vector of the invention may be cultured under conditions<br>
suitable for expression of the protein, and the protein<br>
recovered from the cells of the culture medium.<br>
Compositions<br>
Products according to the invention may be prepared in the<br>
form of a pharmaceutical composition. The product will be<br>
present with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers<br>
or diluents. The composition will be prepared according to<br>
the intended use and route of administration of the product.<br>
Thus the invention provides a composition comprising a product<br>
of the invention in multimeric form together with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, and the use<br>
of such a composition in methods of immunotherapy for<br>
treatment or prophylaxis of a human or animal subject.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents include those<br>
used in formulations suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical<br>
(including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral<br>
(including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous,<br>
intradermal, intrathecal and epidural) administration. The<br>
formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form<br>
and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the<br>
art of pharmacy.<br>
Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can, for<br>
example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc, a fusion<br>
protein of the invention optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in<br>
a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline aqueous<br><br>
dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a<br>
solution or suspension. If desired, the composition to be<br>
administered may also auxiliary substances such as pH<br>
buffering agents and the like. Actual methods of preparing<br>
such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those<br>
skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton,<br>
Pennsylvania, 19th Edition, 1995.<br>
The composition or formulation to be administered will, in any<br>
event, contain a quantity of the active compound(s) in an<br>
amount effective to alleviate the symptoms of the subject<br>
being treated. Dosage forms or compositions containing active<br>
ingredient in the range of 0.25 to 95% with the balance made<br>
up from non-toxic carrier may be prepared.<br>
Parenteral administration is generally characterized by<br>
injection, either subcutaneously, intramuscularly or<br>
intravenously. Injectables can be prepared in conventional<br>
forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms<br>
suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to<br>
injection, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for<br>
example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the<br>
like. A more recently devised approach for parenteral<br>
administration employs the implantation of a slow-release or<br>
sustained-release system, such that a constant level of dosage<br>
is maintained. See, e.g., US Patent No. 3,710,795.<br>
Doses of the product will be dependent upon the nature of the<br>
antigen and may be determined according to current practice<br>
for administration of that antigen in conventional vaccine<br>
formulations.<br><br>
DNA vaccines<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a eukaryotic<br>
expression vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding<br>
a recombinant fusion protein comprising the three component<br>
product of the invention for use in the treatment of the human<br>
or animal body.<br>
Such treatment would achieve its therapeutic effect by<br>
introduction of a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen<br>
for the purposes of raising an immune response. Delivery of<br>
nucleic acids can be achieved using a plasmid vector (in<br>
"naked" or formulated form) or a recombinant expression<br>
vector. To illustrate how the invention may be performed with<br>
plasmid vectors, the publication of Green T.D, et al., 2001,<br>
in Vaccine 20, 242-248 serves as an example. These authors<br>
showed that using a DNA vaccine expressing a fusion of the<br>
measles hemagglutinin protein and three copies of C3d,<br>
enhanced titers of neutralizing antibody were obtained. In<br>
the present invention, the second and third copies of C3d<br>
would be replaced with the sequence encoding the C4bp alpha<br>
chain core, resulting in an oligomeric antigen-adjuvant fusion<br>
protein. This plasmid would be smaller in size (because the<br>
core coding sequence is much shorter than that encoding two<br>
copies of C3d) and more stable because of the absence of<br>
repeated sequences.<br>
Various viral vectors which can be utilized for gene delivery<br>
include adenovirus, herpes virus, vaccinia or an RNA virus<br>
such as a retrovirus. The retroviral vector may be a<br>
derivative of a murine or avian retrovirus. Examples of<br>
retroviral vectors in which a single foreign gene can be<br>
inserted include, but are not limited to: Moloney murine<br>
leukaemia virus (MoMuLV), Harvey murine sarcoma virus<br><br>
(HaMuSV), murine mammary tumour virus (MuMTV), and Rous<br>
Sarcoma Virus (RSV) . When the subject is a human, a vector<br>
such as the gibbon ape leukaemia virus (GaLV) can be utilized.<br>
The vector will include a transcriptional regulatory sequence,<br>
particularly a promoter region sufficient to direct the<br>
initiation of RNA synthesis. Suitable eukaryotic promoters<br>
include the promoter of the mouse metallothionein I gene<br>
(Hamer et al., 1982, J. Molec. Appl. Genet. 1: 273 )/ the TK<br>
promoter of Herpes virus (McKnight, 1982, Cell 31: 355 ); the<br>
SV40 early promoter (Benoist et al., 1981, Nature 290: 304 );<br>
the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (Gorman et al., 1982, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79: 6777); and the cytomegalovirus<br>
promoter (Foecking et al., 1980, Gene 45: 101 ).<br>
Administration of vectors of this aspect of the invention to a<br>
subject, either as a plasmid vector or as part of a viral<br>
vector can be affected by many different routes. Plasmid DNA<br>
can be "naked" or formulated with cationic and neutral lipids<br>
(liposomes) or microencapsulated for either direct or indirect<br>
delivery. The DNA sequences can also be contained within a<br>
viral (e.g., adenoviral, retroviral, herpesvius, pox virus)<br>
vector, which can be used for either direct or indirect<br>
delivery. Delivery routes include but are not limited to<br>
intramuscular, intradermal (Sato, Y. et al., 1996, Science<br>
273: 352-354), intravenous, intra-arterial, intrathecal,<br>
intrahepatic, inhalation, intravaginal instillation (Bagarazzi<br>
et al., 1997, J Med. Primatol. 26:27), intrarectal,<br>
intratumour or intraperitoneal.<br>
Thus the invention includes a vector as described herein as a<br>
pharmaceutical composition useful for allowing transfection of<br>
some cells with the DNA vector such that a therapeutic<br><br>
polypeptide will be expressed and have a therapeutic effect,<br>
namely to induce an immune response to an antigen. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are<br>
prepared by bringing the construct according to the present<br>
invention into a form suitable for administration to a subject<br>
using solvents, carriers, delivery systems, excipients, and<br>
additives or auxiliaries. Frequently used solvents include<br>
sterile water and saline (buffered or not). One carrier<br>
includes gold particles, which are delivered biolistically<br>
(i.e., under gas pressure). Other frequently used carriers or<br>
delivery systems include cationic liposomes, cochleates and<br>
microcapsules, which may be given as a liquid solution,<br>
enclosed within a delivery capsule or incorporated into food.<br>
An alternative formulation for the administration of gene<br>
delivery vectors involves liposomes. Liposome encapsulation<br>
provides an alternative formulation for the administration of<br>
polynucleotides and expression vectors. Liposomes are<br>
microscopic vesicles that consist of one or more lipid<br>
bilayers surrounding aqueous compartments. See, generally,<br>
Bakker-Woudenberg et al, 1993, Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol.<br>
Infect. Dis. 12 (Suppl. 1): S61, and Kim, 1993, Drugs 46: 618.<br>
Liposomes are similar in composition to cellular membranes and<br>
as a result, liposomes can be administered safely and are<br>
biodegradable. Depending on the method of preparation,<br>
liposomes may be unilamellar or multilamellar, and liposomes<br>
can vary in size with diameters ranging from 0.02 uM to<br>
greater than 10 uM. See, for example, Machy et al., 1987,<br>
LIPOSOMES IN CELL BIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY (John Libbey) , and<br>
Ostro et al., 1989, American J. Hosp. Phann. 46: 1576.<br>
Expression vectors can be encapsulated within liposomes using<br>
standard techniques. A variety of different liposome<br><br>
compositions and methods for synthesis are known to those of<br>
skill in the art. See, for example, US-A-4,844,904, US-A-<br>
5,000,959, US-A-4,863,740, US-A-5,589,466, US-A-5,580,859, and<br>
US-A-4,975,282, all of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
In general, the dosage of administered liposome-encapsulated<br>
vectors will vary depending upon such factors as the patient's<br>
age, weight, height, sex, general medical condition and<br>
previous medical history. Dose ranges for particular<br>
formulations can be determined by using a suitable animal<br>
model.<br>
Cell culturing.<br>
Plasmids encoding fusion proteins in accordance with the<br>
invention may be introduced into the host cells using<br>
conventional transformation techniques, and the cells cultured<br>
under conditions to facilitate the production of the fusion<br>
protein. Where an inducible promoter is used, the cells may<br>
initially be cultured in the absence of the inducer, which may<br>
then be added once the cells are growing at a higher density<br>
in order to maximise recovery of protein.<br>
Cell culture conditions are widely known in the art and may be<br>
used in accordance with procedures known as such.<br>
In a particular aspect, when the first component is a C4bp<br>
core protein, the fusion of at least the first two components,<br>
and where applicable, all three components, may be expressed<br>
in a prokaryotic expression system. To date, fusion proteins<br>
based on C4bp core protein have been expressed in eukaryotic<br>
cells. The yields of fusion protein from eukaryotic cells has<br>
rarely reached 2 micrograms per millilitre of culture<br><br>
supernatant (Oudin et al, ibid) and this could be achieved<br>
only after rounds of gene amplification. This level is too<br>
low for the economic production of large quantities of many<br>
fusion protein for therapeutic use.<br>
Although WO91/00567 suggests that prokaryotic host cells may<br>
be used in the production of C4bp-based proteins, there is no<br>
experimental demonstration of any such production. A number<br>
of considerations however, would suggest that the use of<br>
prokaryotic systems would be disadvantageous. In particular,<br>
many eukaryotic proteins lose some or all of their active<br>
folded structure when expressed in cells such as E. coli.<br>
Other eukaryotic proteins denature or are completely inactive<br>
when expressed in prokaryotic cells.<br>
C4bp is a secreted protein in mammals, and these are known in<br>
the art to be particularly difficult to produce in a correctly<br>
folded form in prokaryotes. Proteins with disulphide bridges<br>
are particularly problematic, as are those that require<br>
oligomerisation. Disulphide bonds are not normally produced in<br>
the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm, and when<br>
they can form, they can stabilise misfolded or aggregated<br>
forms of the protein.<br>
Usually, recombinant proteins expressed in prokaryotes are<br>
aggregated inside inclusion bodies within the host prokaryotic<br>
cell. These are discrete particles or globules separate from<br>
the rest of the cell which contain the expressed proteins<br>
usually in an agglomerated or inactive form. The presence of<br>
the expressed protein in the inclusion bodies makes it<br>
difficult to recover the protein in active soluble form as the<br>
necessary refolding techniques are techniques are inefficient<br>
and costly. Proteins purified from inclusion bodies have to be<br><br>
laboriously manipulated, denatured and refolded to obtain<br>
active functional proteins at relatively poor yields.<br>
With regard to expressing C4bp core fusion proteins in<br>
prokaryotic cells, other considerations have also to be taken<br>
into account. Firstly, each core monomer retains two cysteine<br>
residues, and according to the model of C4bp multimers<br>
accepted in the art, these cysteines are required to form<br>
inter-molecular disulphide bonds during the assembly of<br>
multimers. The reducing environment of the prokaryotic<br>
cytosol such as the bacterial cytosol would be expected to<br>
prevent the formation of C4bp core multimers by reducing these<br>
disulphide bonds.<br>
Secondly, multimers are assembled during passage through the<br>
eukaryotic secretion apparatus, which is known to assist<br>
protein folding in ways not available in prokaryotes (e.g. the<br>
presence of protein disulphide isomerase and unique<br>
chaperones). Thirdly, even under conditions where relatively<br>
small yields were obtained in eukaryotic cells (micrograms per<br>
millilitre), this secretory pathway is unable to produce<br>
homogenous protein.<br>
Further, the inventors have also found that proteins fused to<br>
the C4bp core produced in the prokaryotic expression systems<br>
retain their functional activity. The present invention<br>
therefore provides a method for obtaining a recombinant fusion<br>
protein comprising a scaffold of a C-terminal core protein of<br>
C4bp alpha chain and a second component, and optionally a<br>
third component, said recombinant fusion protein being capable<br>
of forming multimers in soluble form in the cytosol of a<br>
prokaryotic host cell, the method including the steps of<br>
(i) providing a prokaryotic host cell carrying a nucleic<br><br>
acid encoding said recombinant protein operably linked to<br>
a promoter functional in said prokaryotic cell;<br>
(ii) culturing the host cell under conditions wherein<br>
said recombinant protein is expressed; and<br>
(iii) recovering the recombinant protein wherein said<br>
protein is recovered in multimeric form.<br>
We have found that the yield of protein in cell cultures of<br>
the invention can be relatively high, for example greater than<br>
2 mg/1 of culture, such as greater than 5 mg/1 of culture,<br>
preferably greater than 10 mg/1 of culture, such as greater<br>
than 20 mg/1 culture, and even more preferably greater than<br>
100 mg/1 culture.<br>
C4bp core fusion proteins of the invention comprise a C4bp<br>
core protein sequence fused, at the N- or C-terminus, to one<br>
of the other components of the invention. In a preferred<br>
arrangement, the order of components from the N- to C-terminal<br>
of a fusion protein is N-third component - second component -<br>
first component-C.<br>
We have found that proteins falling within the above<br>
definition can be expressed in and recovered from bacterial<br>
expression systems in multimeric form without the need for<br>
scaffold refolding. We have expressed proteins which include<br>
C4bp core and which are capable of carrying an antigen and a<br>
second component which have a monomer weight up to about 30<br>
kDa. The invention may thus be used to express proteins in<br>
this size range, and more generally for proteins up to about<br>
100 kDa, more preferably about 50 kDa.<br>
The fact that this system allows production of soluble protein<br>
in E. coli enables using it to produce, as folded soluble<br><br>
proteins, domains or fragments of proteins that would not fold<br>
when expressed on their own due to a lack of constraint on<br>
their C-terminal and /or N-terminal ends. Engineering a<br>
specific cleavage site enables production of the free domain<br>
of interest. Similarly constraining the N-terminal and/or C-<br>
terminal end of a peptide of interest could be beneficial<br>
during refolding processes. Furthermore, as the oligo-<br>
merisation structure is very resistant to denaturation and to<br>
disassembly, it would be stable during denaturation of the<br>
inserted protein. Therefore, during refolding, for an equal<br>
amount of protein of interest, the actual concentration of<br>
free protein would be diminished by a factor equal to the<br>
oligomerisation number. Oligomerisation may also be<br>
beneficial for purification purposes as many methods in<br>
protein technology are not optimised to work with proteins and<br>
specifically peptides of very low molecular weight.<br>
Recovery of protein from culture.<br>
Once the cells have been grown to allow for production of the<br>
protein, the protein may be recovered from the cells. Because<br>
we have found that surprisingly, the protein remains soluble,<br>
the cells will usually be spun down and lysed by sonication,<br>
for example, which keeps the protein fraction soluble and<br>
allows this fraction to remain in the supernatant following a<br>
further higher speed (e.g. 15,000 rpm for 1 hour)<br>
centrifugation.<br>
The fusion protein in the supernatant protein fraction may be<br>
purified further by any suitable combination of standard<br>
protein chromatography techniques. We have used ion-exchange<br>
chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography.<br>
Other chromatographic techniques, such as affinity<br>
chromatography, may also be used.<br><br>
In one embodiment, we have found that heating the supernatant<br>
sample either after centrifugation of the lysate, or after any<br>
of the other purification steps will assist recovery of the<br>
protein. The sample may be heated to about 70 - 80 °C for a<br>
period of about 10 to 30 minutes, though this embodiment is<br>
not preferred when the second component is C3d.<br>
Depending on the intended uses of the protein, the protein may<br>
be subjected to further purification steps, for example<br>
dialysis, or to concentration steps, for example freeze<br>
drying.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following examples.<br>
Example 1 - Epitope-C3d-C4bp fusion protein.<br>
This example illustrates the fusion of an epitope (comprising<br>
amino acids 8-22 of human Cpn10) to human C3d which is itself<br>
fused to the N-terminus of the human C4bp core protein. The<br>
fusion protein was expressed in, and purified from, the<br>
bacterial strain C41(DE3). The protein behaved as an oligomer<br>
on gel filtration.<br>
The methodology illustrated in this example may be extended to<br>
provide a three component product of the invention, for<br>
example by replacing the Cpn10 epitope with other antigen-<br>
encoding DNA in the construct described below. Alternatively,<br>
the recovered protein may be covalently linked to an antigen<br>
provided by other means.<br>
Cloning.<br>
A XbaI-BamHI fragment of 975bp, (encoding the T7 ribosome<br>
binding site, residues 8-22 of human Cpn10 (the epitope) and<br><br>
residues 995 to 1287 of human C3d) from pAVD 95 (the<br>
expression construct for C3d7(l)in Example 2 below) was<br>
ligated into pAVD 77 (pRSETa-Db-C4bp) previously digested with<br>
XbaI and BamHI. This fused the human Cpn10 and C3d protein<br>
fragments to the C-terminal 57 residues of the alpha chain of<br>
human C4bp. The construction, called pAVD94, was checked by<br>
PCR and double digestion.<br>
The amino acid sequence of the fusion protein of the construct<br>
is as follows:<br><br>
The residues 2-16 of SEQ ID NO:17 correspond to residues 8-22<br>
of human Cpn10 (the epitope), residues 19-311 of SEQ ID N0:17<br>
to human C3d residues 995 to 1287, and residues 314-370 of SEQ<br>
ID NO:17 to the 57 residues of the human C4bp core protein. A<br>
GS linker sequence, in bold in the sequence above, appears<br>
between the three components.<br>
The protein has an estimated molecular weight of 41,485<br>
Daltons, a theoretical pi of 5.51 and an estimated extinction<br>
coefficient of 45090 M-1cm-1. On this basis, to calculate the<br>
concentration we use: Abs 0,1%(=lg/l)=1.087.<br>
Expression<br>
The plasmid pAVD94 encoding the epitope-C3d-C4bp core protein<br><br>
was expressed in the E. coli strain C41(DE3). After overnight<br>
growth at 25°C without induction, the protein was well<br>
expressed. After cell lysis in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH8/100<br>
mM NaCl using a French press, almost half of the protein was<br>
found to be in the supernatant.<br>
Purification of C3d-C4bp<br>
The soluble fraction of epitope-C3d-C4bp was purified from 1<br>
litre of culture using three purification steps : an anion<br>
exchange column, a cation exchange column and a gel filtration<br>
column.<br>
Anionic column (Mono Q HR 16/10)<br>
The column was equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8/100<br>
mM NaCl. The protein was eluted with a gradient of 20 column<br>
volumes from 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8/100 mM NaCl (Buffer A)<br>
to 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8/1M NaCl (Buffer B). The protein<br>
eluted at approximately 350 mM NaCl.<br>
The MonoQ fractions containing epitope-C3d-C4bp were dialysed<br>
against 20mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7/100 mM NaCl before loading<br>
on a cationic column.<br>
Cationic column (Mono S HR 10/10)<br>
The fractions after the column Mono Q containing epitope-C3d-<br>
C4bp were loaded on a cationic column (Mono S HR 10/10)<br>
equilibrated with 20mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7/100 mM NaCl. The<br>
protein was eluted with a gradient of 20 column volumes from<br>
20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7/100 mM NaCl (Buffer A) to 20 mM<br>
Tris-HCl buffer pH 7/1M NaCl (Buffer B). The protein eluted at<br>
approximately 350 mM NaCl.<br>
The fractions containing the epitope-C3d-C4bp without the<br>
major contaminant (&gt;66 Kda) were pooled, concentrated and<br><br>
loaded on a gel filtration column.<br>
Gel filtration column (Superdex 200 26/60 prep grade)<br>
The fractions from the Mono S column containing epitope-C3d-<br>
C4bp were loaded on a Gel Filtration column (Superdex 200<br>
26/60 prep grade) equilibrated with 50 mM Na phosphate pH<br>
7.4/150 mM NaCl. The protein eluted with 152.69 ml of buffer<br>
as a nice symmetric peak. This elution volume shows that the<br>
protein is oligomeric. After the column, the protein<br>
concentration was 0.45 mg/ml. The protein was concentrated to<br>
1.5 mg/ml and stored at -70°C with 10% Glycerol. The protein<br>
was at least 90% pure.<br>
Example 2 - Insertion of the human C3d molecule in the mobile<br>
loop of Human Cpn10 (C3d7).<br>
This example describes the purification of the soluble portion<br>
of three similar C3d7 constructs and their expression at 25°C.<br>
C3d7(l)<br>
A 42.85 kDa tri-partite fusion protein, comprising human C3d<br>
replacing the mobile loop of human Cpn10 (truncated at its N-<br>
terminus) and a C-terminal myc tag epitope, with the amino<br>
acid sequence. SEQ ID NO:18, was expressed from the plasmid<br>
pAVD 95 in the E. coli strain C41(DE3) at 25°C.<br><br><br><br>
Human Cpn10 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18 are residues<br>
1-16 and 311-377. The human C3d amino acid sequence is from<br>
17-310 of SEQ ID NO: 18, and the myc-tag epitope amino acid<br>
sequence from 378-387.<br>
The DNA sequence (an NdeI-HindIII restriction fragment)<br>
encoding this fusion protein was cloned between the NdeI-<br>
HindIII sites of a pRSET derived plasmid, placing the coding<br>
sequence under the control of the T7 promoter.<br>
C3d7(2)<br>
A second fusion protein, differing only in the positioning of<br>
human C3d insertion in place of the mobile loop of human Cpn10<br>
was similarly constructed. This has the sequence of SEQ ID<br>
NO:19:<br><br>
Amino acid residues 1-20 and 315-378 are derived from human<br>
Cpn10, flanking the human C3d amino acid sequence. The myc-<br>
tag epitope amino acid sequence is from 379-388.<br>
C3d7 (3)<br>
Likewise, a third fusion protein called C3d7(3) with the<br><br><br>
The human Cpn10 amino acid sequence is 1-18 and 313-373<br>
flanking the human C3d amino acid sequence, and the myc-tag<br>
epitope amino acid sequence is 374-383.<br>
Expression of C3d7(l).<br>
To have this protein in a soluble form, we expressed pAVD95 in<br>
the E. coll strain C41(DE3) at 25°C. After an overnight<br>
induction at 25°C with 0.5 mM IPTG the protein was expressed<br>
and almost half of the protein was found to be in the<br>
supernatant.<br>
Purification<br>
The soluble fraction of C3d7(l) was purified using two<br>
purification steps, namely an anionic column, followed by a<br>
gel filtration column.<br>
Anionic column (Mono Q HR 16/10)<br>
The column was equilibrated in 20 mM Tris pH 8. The protein<br>
was eluted with a gradient of 20 column volumes from 20 mM<br>
Tris pH 8 to 20 mM Tris pH 8, 1M NaCl. The protein eluted with<br>
approximately 350 mM NaCl in one fraction (E3) of 5 ml.<br><br>
Gel filtration column (Superdex 200 26/60 prep grade)<br>
The fraction E3 of the column Mono Q was loaded on a gel<br>
Filtration column (Superdex 200 26/60 prep grade) equilibrated<br>
with 50 mM Na phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl. The protein was<br>
eluted with 150 ml of buffer. The elution volume of ovalbumin<br>
(MW=43 Kd) on the same column was 167 ml. This indicates that<br>
the protein is oligomeric.<br>
Circular Dichroism<br>
Analysis of the protein by Far UV Circular Dichroism indicated<br>
the presence of secondary structure. The deconvolution of the<br>
spectrum gave a percentage of alpha-helix around 49 %. This<br>
percentage is in agreement with the percentage determined by<br>
modelling (48% of alpha-helix) . This -is a good indication<br>
that the protein is correctly folded.<br>
The protein was concentrated to 1.2 mg/ml in 50mM sodium<br>
phosphate, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl.<br>
Example 3 - CR2 binding activity of C3d7(l) and epitope-C3d-<br>
C4bp.<br>
ELISA Assay Method<br>
The epiotope-C3d-C4bp molecule prepared as in Example 1 and<br>
the C3d7(l) prepared as in Example 2 were assayed over a<br>
concentration range from 500nM - O.OlnM and compared against<br>
human C3d (Calbiochem) and a linear trimer of human C3d,<br>
called C3d3 or APT2029, constructed and prepared as described<br>
in WO99/35260. The results are shown in Figures 2 and 4.<br>
Briefly, the assay method was as follows:<br>
A IgG constant region-CD21 fusion protein, was expressed and<br>
purified in tissue culture cells and the purified protein was<br><br>
used to coat the wells of an ELISA plate. The various C3d<br>
molecules were added, in a range of concentrations, to these<br>
wells and incubated. After incubation, the wells were<br>
extensively washed, before adding a biotinylated anti-C3d<br>
monoclonal antibody. After incubation and washing, a<br>
horseradish peroxidase(HRP)-labelled anti-biotin antibody was<br>
added. Following a further incubation and washing step, a<br>
substrate for HRP was added and the generation of a coloured<br>
product from the substrate by the HRP was measured at an<br>
absorbance of 450 nanometres. The assay is illustrated as a<br>
cartoon in Figure 3.<br>
Clearly the epitope-C3d-C4bp molecule binds to the C3d<br>
receptor CD21 much better than the monomeric C3d does and<br>
better than even the linear trimer C3d3 at several<br>
concentrations, as seen in Figure 2.<br>
The assay was repeated three times with C3d7(l) and the<br>
gradients of each response averaged and compared. Figure 4<br>
shows the results of one of these assays.<br>
In comparing the results between C3d7(l) and the Calbiochem<br>
C3d (which is in monomeric form), the Abs 450 of the C3d7(l)<br>
increases at a lower concentration than the monomeric C3d.<br>
This indicates that the C3d is in a multimeric form.<br>
Example 4 - CR2 binding activity of C3d7(l), (2) &amp; (3).<br>
The second binding experiment of example 3 was repeated as<br>
described in Example 3 with C3d7(l), (2) and (3), all of which<br>
were prepared as described above in Example 2.<br>
The binding of these three proteins in an ELISA assay is shown<br><br>
as Figure 5. The data show that C3d7(l), C3d7(2) and C3d7(3)<br>
all conclusively bind to CR2. The gradient of the linear<br>
portion of the binding curve gives an indication of<br>
multimerisation of the proteins as shown by the 3.4 fold<br>
increase in gradient between the monomeric C3d (supplied by<br>
Calbiochem) and the linear trimer of C3d3, called APT2029. The<br>
gradient for the linear portion of the three C3d7 constructs<br>
suggests that they are all multimerised.<br>
Example 5 - Analysis by immunofluorescent flow cytometry.<br>
The CR2 binding activity of the C3d7 constructs on the<br>
immortalised human CD21+ Raji lymphoblastoid cell line and<br>
human CD20+/CD4- / CD8- peripheral blood lymphocytes was<br>
tested. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out using a<br>
Becton Dickenson FACSCalibur; 10,000 events were acquired.<br>
Immortalised Raji (B cells) and Jurkat (T cells) cells were<br>
washed in PBS and incubated with optimised dilutions of FITC<br>
conjugated, anti-human, CD3 (pan-T cell marker), CD20 (pan-B<br>
cell marker) and CD21 (CR2 marker) (DAKO) monoclonal<br>
antibodies (Mabs). This verified that Raji cells are CD21+,<br>
CD20+ whereas Jurkat cells are CD21dim, CD3+.<br>
Binding of C3d7(1-3) is detected on Raji (CD21+/CD20+) cells,<br>
but not Jurkat (CD3+/CD21dim) cells.<br>
Using a single staining immunofluorescence assay format,<br>
washed Raji and Jurkat cells (lxl06/ml) were incubated with<br>
100nM (final dilution) of C3d7(l), C3d7(2), C3d7(3), human<br>
monomeric C3d (Calbiochem) and human linear trimer C3d3<br>
(APT2029) for 30 minutes at room temperature, washed in ice-<br>
cold PBS and then incubated with an optimised dilution of Cy3<br>
(a pink fluorophore) conjugated anti-human C3d monoclonal<br><br>
antibody (Mab) for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark, washed again<br>
and resuspended in 0.5ml ice-cold PBS. Figure 6 shows the<br>
results of this analysis.<br>
C3d7(l) and C3d7(2) conclusively bind to CD21+ cells and not to<br>
CD3+/CD21dim cells. The increase in signal intensity gives an<br>
indication of multimerisation shown by the 7 and 9 fold signal<br>
intensity increase between C3d (Calbiochem) , C3d7(l) and<br>
C3d7(2) respectively compared with the 6.4 fold increase with<br>
C3d3 (APT2029) .<br>
Binding of C3d7(1) on the surface of CD20+/CD4-/CD8- human<br>
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs)<br>
This experiment was conducted using a double staining<br>
immunofluorescence assay format. Human PBLs were isolated from<br>
blood by density gradient centrifugation through Ficoll.<br>
Contaminating erythrocytes were removed by lysis. Washed PBLs<br>
at lxl06/ml were incubated with 200nM (final dilution) C3d7(l)<br>
or human linear trimer C3d3 (APT2029) for 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature, washed in ice-cold PBS and then incubated with<br>
optimised dilutions of Cy3-anti-human C3d Mab and FITC-anti<br>
CD4 (Th cell marker), anti CD8 (CTL marker) anti-CD20 (B cell<br>
marker) Mabs (DAKO) for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark, washed<br>
and resuspended in 0.3ml ice-cold PBS prior to flow cytometry<br>
analysis; 5,000 events were acquired.<br>
Analysis of the data indicated that C3d7(l) conclusively binds<br>
to the PBL B (CD20+) cell population (presumed to be CD21+), in<br>
a similar manner to that seen with the linear trimer human<br>
C3d3 called APT2029.<br><br>
