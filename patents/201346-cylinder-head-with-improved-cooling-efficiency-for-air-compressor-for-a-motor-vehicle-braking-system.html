The invention relates to air compressors and more especially it relates to a reciprocating air compressor.<br>
Reciprocating compressors comprises a piston and cylinder arrangement with a cylinder head assembly over the cylinder. The cylinder head assembly is made of cylinder head, inlet valve and delivery valve and valve plate with inlet and delivery holes. The cylinder head has an inlet port opening to the inlet cavity and a delivery port opening into the delivery cavity. The inlet valve opens during induction stroke of the piston and the delivery valve opens during the delivery stroke of the piston. The air compressor intakes air at lower pressure through the inlet holes and compresses it to higher pressure and temperature through the delivery holes. The delivery cavity portion of the cylinder head is provided with extended surface for better heat extraction from the hot air. In the conventional design, the hot air takes a shorter path from the delivery passage to the delivery port rendering the extended surfaces less efficient in extracting the heat resulting in higher temperature of the delivered air.<br>
The heat transfer in the cylinder head takes place by three ways. The heat transfer from the hot air to cylinder head takes place by convection process. The heat transfer from the cylinder head inner surface to exterior surface takes place by conduction process. The heat transfer from cylinder head walls to cooling medium takes place by convection process. The present invention is addressed at improving convective heat transfer from hot air to the cylinder head.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The inventors have made great effort to provide a system, which will meet the requirement of the industry and overcome the problem associated in the prior art.<br><br>
To achieve the above object according to first aspect and feature of the present invention there is provided a system to improve cooling efficiency for air compressor for a motor vehicle braking system.<br>
According to second aspect and feature of the invention in addition to the first feature the invention comprises a system, which is unique, rugged, efficient and economical.<br>
At the outset of the description which follows it is to be understood that ensuring description only illustrate a particular form of this invention. However, such particular form is only an exemplary embodiment, and without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and reading of the invention and not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
Accordingly the salient feature of the present invention is in the provision of a new element called baffle, which will reduce the temperature of the air being delivered by diverting the hot air over the extended surfaces.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a baffle made out of sheet metal fastened along with delivery valve over the delivery hole of the valve plate. The baffle obstructs the direct flow of compressed hot air to the delivery port and provides a diverted flow path over the extended surfaces inside the delivery cavity. The extended surfaces are made more efficient in extracting heat from the hot air. Higher the heat being extracted lower is the temperature of compressed air being delivered. Hence the new design improves the cooling efficiency of the cylinder head in the air compressor.<br>
In prior art designs, such diversion of compressed air to achieve better cooling of delivery air are known. However in such prior art arrangements, the hot delivery air is made to circulate around the intake air cavity, which will heat up the intake air<br><br>
and hence counteract the benefit of the longer flow path of the delivery air. In the present invention, the hot delivery air has minimal contact with the intake air. Another aspect of the present invention is that the baffle made of conducting material like steel provides additional heat transfer surface for the delivery air and the heat thus transferred to the baffle can be effectively removed through the valve plate to which it is firmly attached.<br>
In conventional design, the free end of the delivery valve that lifts during discharge needs to be guided by guidance in the valve governing plate. In the present invention, the new device, baffle has been designed to guide the free end of the delivery valve.<br>
The special features of the baffle are<br>
a)	It is formed to a shape to provide a diverted path over the extended heat transfer area of the delivery cavity.<br>
b)	It is formed to a shape to provide a longer flow path to the air enabling higher stagnation time and higher probability of heat extraction, without delivery air substantially contacting the intake air cavity.<br>
c)	The baffle itself forms additional heat transfer area<br>
d)	It is shaped to guide the free end of the delivery valve.<br>
e)	It enables reusability.<br>
f)	It is fastened along with the delivery valve requiring no additional fasteners.<br>
The foregoing description outlined rather broadly preferred and alternative feature of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject of claims of the<br><br>
invention. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiment as a basis for designing and modifying other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the art should realise such equivalent conception do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.<br>
The drawings are given by way of non-limitative example to explain the nature of the invention.<br>
The accompanying drawings are intended to provide further understanding of invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of invention. The drawings illustrate an embodiment of invention and together with the description illustrate principle of invention.<br>
The drawings should not be taken as implying any necessary limitation on the essential scope of invention.<br>
The various features of the novelty, which characterise the invention, are pointed out particulariy in the claims annexed to and forming part of disclosure. For a better understanding of invention, its operating advantages, and specific objects obtained by its use, reference should be made to the drawings and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated and described preferred embodiments of invention.<br>
Cylinder head with improved cooling efficiency for air compressor in a motor vehicle braking system is characterised by incorporation of this specially designed baffle, the said baffle being fastened to the valve plate such that the baffle in the cylinder head of the air compressor allows the hot air to flow over the extended surfaces of the delivery cavity making it more efficient in extracting the heat thereby improves the cooling efficiency of cylinder head in the air compressor.<br><br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of several possible embodiments of the baffle proposed herein. In the drawings,<br>
Figure 1 - illustrates the sectional view of the cylinder head of the air compressor without baffle.<br>
Figure 2 - Illustrates the sectional view of the cylinder head of the air compressor according to the present invention with baffle.<br>
Figure 3 - illustrates the 3 dimensional view of the baffle.<br>
Figure 4 - illustrates the exploded view of the cylinder head of the air compressor, incorporating baffle according to invention.<br>
Figure 1<br>
The configuration of a conventional cylinder head assembly is illustrated in figure 1.<br>
The cylinder head assembly consists of a cylinder head (6), valve plate (2), Inlet valve (9) and Delivery valve (3). The entire cylinder head assembly is mounted on the cylinder block (1). The delivery cavity of the cylinder head (6) consists of plurality of pin (5) like projections so as to increase the surface area of cooling. The valve plate (2) has two delivery passages (8) to allow the passage of compressed air from cylinder bore to delivery cavity. Further there is provided delivery valve (3) over the delivery passage (8). A governor plate (4) is placed over the delivery valve (3) so as to control the lift of the delivery valve (3).<br>
The compressed air at higher temperature takes a shorter path from the delivery passage (8) to reach the delivery port (7). The pins (5) closer to the delivery port, which are located in path of air flow transfers heat more effectively. The pins (5), which are located away from the deliverv oort (7^ are ineffective in pyfrflntinn thc^<br><br>
heat from the hot air. The movement of the air flow is indicated by arrows. The very objective of the invention is to over come the problem associated with the prior art. The problem of inefficient transfer of heat from hot air to the pin (5) and other heat extracting surfaces is addressed by incorporation of baffle in the delivery cavity of the cylinder head. The configuration of the baffle plate is explained in detail in figure 3 of the drawings.<br>
Figure 2<br>
This figure illustrates the location of the baffle with in the delivery cavity of the cylinder head. The baffle (10) is being fastened over the valve plate (2) along with the delivery valve (3) and governor plate (4). The baffle (10) obstructs the direct flow of the hot air to delivery port (7) and allows it to flow through the intended path. The hot air flows over the heat extracting pins (5) provided in the delivery cavity of the cylinder head (6) making it more efficient in extracting the heat. The profile of the baffle (10) allows the air to take longer path, thereby higher air stagnation time resulting in higher chances of heat extraction. The movement of the air flow is indicated by arrows. The essential difference in the air flow according to the invention is that substantially all the heat extracting surface is effectively utilised. The air is directed advantageously to pass through entire heat extracting surface so that heat transfer is maximised enabling thereby the objective of the invention. Additionally the surface area provided by the metallic baffle also extracts heat from the hot air, the heat flowing through conduction to the valve plate (2) through gap free contact between the baffle and the valve plate and further the heat flows convectively from the valve plate to the cooling medium, which circulates through the valve plate.<br><br>
Figure 3<br>
The baffle is provided with a base plate (16) at one end. The base plate (16) is folded to form a folded layer (12) so that in between the folded layer (12) and the base plate (12), the governor plate (4) can be accommodated. Above the folded layer (12), there is provided a wall (13), which terminates at the roof (17). The base plate (16) is provided with notch (11) to guide the delivery valve (3). In the other end, the baffle has a horizontal strip (15) having a hole for fixing over the valve plate (2). One end of the roof (17) has semi circular profile and the other end has plurality of projections to match with the profile of the delivery cavity.<br>
The proximal side wall (12) facing towards the delivery port (7) obstructs the direct flow of air. The distal side wall (14) facing away from the delivery port (7) has wide opening to allow the air flow. In conventional design the governor plate (4) guides the free end of the delivery valve (3). In the novel design a provision is made for guiding the free end of the delivery valve (3). This provision will restrict the swivel moment of the delivery valve (3). The profile of the air flow diverting baffle allows for higher air stagnation time resulting in higher probability of heat extraction.<br>
Figure 4<br>
Figure 4 is the exploded view of the cylinder head assembly illustrating heat extracting surface including plurality of pins (5) incorporating inside the delivery cavity. The baffle (10), governor plate (4) and delivery valve (3) are fastened over the valve plate (2). As explained in the description, enhancement of the cooling efficiency is obtained by providing baffle(IO) at the appropriate place to improve the heat transfer considerably. Additionally the contact of hot air with the intake air cavity (18) is through the wall (19) constructed such that the surface area of this wall is a minimum and hence the effect of the hot air heating the intake air is reduced to a<br><br>
minimum, which is another advantage over the prior art. In prior art, where such longer path of the delivery air is achieved, the hot air is made to circulate around the intake cavity, increasing the possibility of delivery air heating up the intake air.<br>
It is understood that the invention has been explained in relation to specific embodiment. It is inferred that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention and it is not intended that illustrative of the present invention and it is not intended that the invention be limited or restrictive thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. All substitution, alterations and modification of the present invention, which come within the scope of the following claims, are to which the preset invention is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
The scope of the invention should therefore be determined not with reference to the above description but should be determined not with reference to the above description but should be determined with reference to appended claims along with full scope of equivalent to which such claims area entitled.<br><br><br><br><br>
