[Title of Invention]  CATIONIC ELECTRODEPOSITION COATING<br>
COMPOSITION<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a cationic electrodeposition coating composition that has excellent electrodeposition coating applicability onto hot dip galvanized steel sheets, and that can provide a cationic electrodeposition coating film having excellent anti-corrosion properties and a superior finish, in particular, a superior finish at a dried film thickness of 15 µm.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Because of their excellent coating operability and good anti-corrosion properties of the resulting coating films, cationic electrodeposition coating compositions are widely used as undercoating compositions for conductive metal products such as automobile bodies, which are required to have the aforementioned properties. In electrodeposition coating using cationic electrodeposition coating compositions, attempts are made to maintain the inner film thickness of bag portions and gap portions to ensure anti-corrosion properties, and to optimize or make the outer film thickness uniform (for example, to ensure the film thickness of a portion where finish and anti-corrosion properties are valued) for improving the quality of automobile bodies and reducing the cost.<br>
However, in coating films obtained using conventional electrodeposition coating compositions, a reduction in thickness from 20 µm to 15 µm may result in a poor finish due to an uneven substrate and a reduction in heat flow properties. Further, for the purpose of improving finish, if the amount of plastic components used<br>
in the coating film is increased to improve heat flow properties during heating and drying, anti-corrosion properties tend to be lowered. Because of these factors, it was difficult to provide an electrodeposition coating film having both satisfactory finish and anti-corrosion properties at a dried film thickness of 15 µm.<br>
In view of these circumstances, the development of a cationic electrodeposition coating composition that exhibits excellent electrodeposition coating applicability onto hot dip galvanized steel sheets in an article having complicated bag portions and gap portions; and that provides a cationic electrodeposition coating film having excellent anti-corrosion properties and a superior finish, in particular, a superior finish at a dried film thickness<br>
of 15 µm, has been desired.<br>
Patent Literature 1 discloses a method for producing a coating film, the method being characterized in that, in the electrodeposition coating of a cationic electrodeposition coating composition, the electric quantity required for initiating the deposition of a coating film is 100 to 400 C/m2, and the polarization resistance value per unit film thickness is 50 to 300 kΩ-cm2/µm.  This method considers various resin components.<br>
Further, Patent Literature 2 discloses an anion electrodeposition coating composition comprising a carboxyl group-containing polyester resin and a cross-linking agent, the composition further comprising a resol phenolic resin to improve anti-corrosion properties.<br>
However, the above findings cannot provide an electrodeposition coating film having excellent anti-corrosion properties and a satisfactory finish, particularly, a satisfactory finish at a dried film thickness of 15 µm.<br>

To improve anti-corrosion properties and finish, especially, anti-corrosion properties and finish at a<br>
dried film thickness of 15 µm, the cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention includes phenolic hydroxy group-containing resin (B) .<br>
Phenolic hydroxy group-containing resin (B) is obtainable by reacting the above-mentioned diepoxy compound (bll) and/or the above-mentioned epoxy resin (bl2) having an epoxy equivalent of 170 to 500 with bisphenol compound (bl3) at a equivalent ratio of [ (epoxy groups in diepoxy compound (bll) and epoxy resin (bl2))/[phenol groups in bisphenol compound (bl3)] being 0.5 to 0.85, preferably 0.5 to 0.83, and more preferably 0.5 to 0.8.<br>
Herein, diepoxy compound (bll) indicates, as explained above, compound (1) represented by Formula (1) and/or compound (2) represented by Formula (2).<br>
As diepoxy compound (bll), epoxy resin (bl2)<br>
having an epoxy equivalent of 170 to 500, and bisphenol compound (bl3), those described in the section "Amino group-containing modified epoxy resin (Al)" can be used.<br>
Phenolic hydroxy group-containing resin (B) can be produced by mixing diepoxy compound (bll) and/or epoxy resin (bl2) having an epoxy equivalent of 170 to 500, and bisphenol compound (bl3) to make these three compounds react in the presence of a suitably selected reaction catalyst such as dimethylbenzylamine, tributylamine and like tertiary amines; tetraethylammonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium bromide and like quaternary ammonium salts, at a reaction temperature of about 80 to 200°C, and preferably about 90 to 180°C, for 1 to 6 hours, and preferably 1 to 5 hours.<br>
From the standpoint of improvement in finish and anti-corrosion properties, particularly, finish and anti-corrosion properties at a dried film thickness of 15 µm, it is preferable that the thus obtained phenolic hydroxy group-containing resin (B) have a phenolic hydroxy equivalent of 20 to 112 mg KOH/g, particularly 25 to 110 mg KOH/g, and a number average molecular weight of 800 to 7,000, particularly 900 to 5,000.<br>
Blocked polyisocyanate curing agent (C)<br>
When amino group-containing modified epoxy resin (A) and phenolic hydroxy group-containing resin (B) are used in combination with blocked polyisocyanate curing agent (C) in the cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention, a heat-curable cationic electrodeposition coating composition can be obtained.<br>
The aforementioned blocked polyisocyanate curing agent (C) is an almost stoichiometric amounts addition-reaction product of a polyisocyanate compound and an isocyanate blocking agent.   Polyisocyanate<br>
compounds usable in blocked polyisocyanate curing agent (C) may be known compounds. Examples thereof include aromatic, aliphatic or alicyclic polyisocyanate compounds such as tolylene diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, phenylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-2,2'-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-2,4'-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate, crude MDI (polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate), bis(isocyanatemethyl)cyclohexane, tetramethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, methylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, etc.; cyclopolymers or biurets of these polyisocyanate compounds; and combinations thereof.<br>

The isocyanate blocking agent is added to isocyanate groups of a polyisocyanate compound to block the isocyanate groups. The blocked polyisocyanate compound obtained by such an addition is stable at room temperature; however, it is desirable that the blocking agent be dissociated to regenerate free isocyanate groups, when heated to a baking temperature of a coating film (usually about 100°C to about 200°C).<br>
Examples of blocking agents usable in blocked polyisocyanate curing agent (C) include<br>

The above proportions are preferable to achieve excellent coating composition stability and to provide a coated article having excellent electrodeposition coating applicability onto hot dip galvanized steel sheets, and excellent anti-corrosion properties and a superior finish, particularly, excellent anti-corrosion properties and a superior finish at a dried film thickness of 15 µm.<br>
In the production of a cationic electrodeposition coating composition containing amino group-containing modified epoxy resin (A) as a resin component, amino group-containing modified epoxy resin (A) , phenolic hydroxy group-containing resin (B), and blocked polyisocyanate curing agent (C) are fully mixed, if necessary, with organic solvents and various additives, etc., such as surfactants, surface-adjusting agents, etc. to thereby prepare a preparation resin. The prepared preparation resin is rendered water-soluble or water-dispersible with organic carboxylic acid etc. to thereby obtain an emulsion.<br>
The neutralization of the preparation resin may generally be performed using a known organic carboxylic acid; of these, acetic acid, formic acid, lactic acid, and mixtures thereof are preferable.  Subsequently, a pigment dispersion paste is added to the emulsion, which is then adjusted using water to produce a cationic<br>
electrodeposition coating composition.<br>
The above-mentioned pigment dispersion paste is a dispersion preliminarily comprising fine particles of a coloring pigment, a rust-preventive pigment, an extender pigment, etc., and may be prepared by, for example, mixing a resin for pigment dispersion, a neutralizer, a pigment compound, etc., and dispersing the resulting mixture in a dispersion mixer such as a ball mill, sand mill, pebble mill, or the like.<br>
Known resins may be used as the above-mentioned resin for pigment dispersion. Examples thereof include base resins having hydroxy and cationic groups; resins such as tertiary amine-type epoxy resins, quaternary ammonium salt-type epoxy resins, tertiary sulfonium salt-type epoxy resins, etc.<br>
There is no particular limitation to the aforementioned pigment compounds, and usable examples include coloring pigments such as titanium oxide, carbon black, colcothar, etc.; extender pigments such as clay, mica, baryta, calcium carbonate, silica, etc.; and rust-preventive pigments such as aluminum phosphomolybdate, aluminum tripolyphosphate, zinc oxide (zinc white), etc.<br>
In order to inhibit corrosion or prevent rust, bismuth compounds may be used. Examples thereof include bismuth oxide, bismuth hydroxide, basic bismuth carbonate, bismuth nitrate, bismuth silicate, organic acid bismuth, etc.<br>
In order to improve the curability of the coating films, organic tin compounds, such as dibutyltin dibenzoate, dioctyltin oxide, dibutyltin oxide, etc. may be used.  However, in place of these organic tin compounds, rust-preventive pigments and/or bismuth compounds such as the above-mentioned zinc oxide (zinc white), etc. may also be used (in an increased amount), and/or refined for use, in order to improve the curability of the coating films.<br>
The amount of the pigment compounds used is preferably 1 to 100 parts by mass, particularly 10 to 50 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of the total solids of the base resin and the curing agent.<br>
Examples of articles on which the cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention is coated include automobile bodies, parts for two-wheeled vehicles, home appliances and other appliances, etc. Articles are not particularly limited as long as they are made of metal.<br>
Examples of metal steel sheets to be coated include cold-rolled steel sheets, hot dip galvanized steel sheets, electro-galvanized steel sheets, electrolytic zinc-iron duplex plated steel sheets, organic composite plated steel sheets, aluminium substrates, magnesium substrates, and the like. If necessary, these metal sheets may be washed using alkali degreasing etc., and subjected to surface treatment such as phosphate chemical conversion treatment, chromate treatment, etc.<br>
The cationic electrodeposition coating composition may be applied on a desired substrate surface by electrodeposition coating. Cationic electrodeposition coating is generally performed by adjusting the temperature of an electrodeposition bath to usually 15 to 35°C, and applying a current at a load voltage of 100 to 400V using a to-be-coated article as a cathode. The electrodeposition bath comprises an electrodeposition coating composition diluted with deionized water or the like to a solids content of about 5 to about 40 mass%, and whose pH has been adjusted to 5.5 to 9.0.  In general, after the electrodeposition coating, the article is fully washed with ultrafiltrate (UF filtrate), reverse osmosis water (RO water), industrial water, deionized water or the like to remove the cationic electrodeposition coating composition excessively adhered to the coated object.<br>
The thickness of the electrodeposition coating film is not particularly limited, but is generally 5 to 40 urn, and preferably 12 to 30 urn, based on the thickness of the dried coating film. The baking and drying of the coating film is performed by heating the electrodeposition coating film at a surface temperature of the coated article of 110 to 200°C, preferably 140 to 180°C for 10 to 180 minutes, preferably 20 to 50 minutes by means of a dryer such as an electric hot-air dryer, gas hot-air dryer or the like. By such baking and drying, a cured coating film is obtained.<br>
The cationic electrodeposition coating film obtained by baking and drying as above has a center line mean roughness (Ra) of 0.20 µm or less, preferably 0.05 to 0.18 µm (at a cut off of 0.8 mm) at a dried film thickness of 15 µm, and has an excellent finish. The center line mean roughness (Ra) in the roughness curve is defined by JIS B 601.<br>

The higher the amount of deposition (%), the better.<br>
(Note 9): Electrodeposition coating applicability onto hot dip galvanized steel sheets<br>
A hot dip galvanized steel sheet (0.8 mm x 150 mm x 70mm) treated by chemical conversion with Palbond #3020 (trade name of a zinc phosphate treatment agent produced by Nihon Parkerizing Co., Ltd.) was immersed for use as a cathode in a bath containing an electrodeposition<br>
coating composition (30°C). Electrodeposition coating was performed by adjusting the current application time at a<br>
voltage of 210V, thereby obtaining a 15 µm coating film. The number of pinholes was counted in 10 x 10 cm of the test piece obtained by heat-curing the resulting coating<br>
film at 170°C for 20 minutes.<br>
A: No pinhole.<br>
B: One small pinhole (gas pinhole) was observed. However,<br>
since the pinhole was small enough to be sealed by an<br>
intermediate coating film, there were no problems.<br>
C: 2 to 5 pinholes.<br>
D: 10 or more pinholes.<br>
(Note 10): Surface roughness of electrodeposition coating film<br>
The center line mean roughness (Ra) of each of the electrodeposition coating films (dried film thickness:<br>
15 µm) obtained in the Examples and Comparative Examples<br>
was measured using Surfcom 301 (trade name of a surface<br>
roughness measuring instrument produced by Mitsutoyo<br>
Corporation) according to JIS B 0601 (Definition and<br>
Indication of Surface Roughness, 1982). The smaller the<br>
Ra, the better. The surface roughness of each of the<br>
electrodeposition coating films was evaluated by "center<br>
line mean roughness (Ra)" according to the following<br>
criteria:<br>
A: Ra was less than 0.20.<br>
B: Ra was not less than 0.20 and less than 0.50.<br>
C: Ra was not less than 0.50 and less than 0.70.<br>
D: Ra was not less than 0.70.<br>
(Note 11): Anti-corrosion properties<br>
Each of the test plates containing a cationic electrodeposition coating film (dried film thickness: 15<br>
µm) obtained in the Examples and Comparative Examples was cross-cut with a knife so that the cut reached the substrate. The test plate was then subjected to a salt spray test at 35°C for 840 hours in accordance with JIS Z-2371. Anti-corrosion properties were rated based on the width of rust or blister resulting from the cut portion according to the following criteria:<br>
A: The maximum width of rust or blister resulting from the cut was not more than 2.0 mm (on one side). B: The maximum width of rust or blister from the cut was more than 2.0 mm and not more than 3.0 mm (on one side) . C: The maximum width of rust or blister from the cut was more than 3.0 mm and not more than 3.5 mm (on one side). D: The maximum width of rust or blister from the cut was more than 3.5 mm (on one side).<br>
Comprehensive evaluation:<br>
In the field of cationic electrodeposition<br><br>
coating compositions to which the present invention belongs, it is extremely important that compositions excel in terms of the following properties, i.e., throwing power, electrodeposition coating applicability onto hot dip galvanized steel sheets, surface roughness of the electrodeposition coating film, and anti-corrosion properties. Specifically, it is necessary that the amount of deposition (%) be at least 60%, and that all of the other properties be rated as A or B. The other properties being rated as A is more preferable.<br>
Hence, each of the cationic electrodeposition coating compositions was comprehensively evaluated according to the following criteria:<br>
A: The amount of deposition was at least 60%, and the other three properties were rated as either A or B (including at least one A).<br>
B: The amount of deposition was at least 60%, and the other three properties were all rated as B. C: The amount of deposition was at least 50% and less than 60%, and the other three properties were rated as A, B or C; or the amount of deposition was at least 60%, and the other three properties were rated as A, B, or C (including at least one C).<br>
D: The amount of deposition was less than 50%; or the other three properties were rated as A, B, C, or D (including at least one D).<br>
[Industrial Applicability]<br>
The present invention can provide a coated article that has excellent anti-corrosion properties and a superior finish.<br>
