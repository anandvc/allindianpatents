TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention refers to a process for breaking<br>
the carbon chains of organic molecules of non-gaseous<br>
materials and related apparatus.<br>
More specifically, the present invention refers to a<br>
process that by breaking the chains of organic molecules<br>
allows aliphatic or cyclic organic macromolecules,<br>
typically present in synthetic waste of plastic material,<br>
to be transformed into molecules with a carbon number<br>
preferably not greater than 20, typical of light fuels,<br>
and into molecules that will not be burnt that comprise<br>
polluting elements.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
As known, the breaking of the carbon-carbon bonds of<br>
organic molecules takes place above all by thermal<br>
cracking, also known as pyrolisis, or cracking in the oil<br>
industry. The cracking reaction allows the molecular<br>
weight of the hydrocarbons present in the crude oil to be<br>
reduced to product lighter products.<br>
Currently, cracking is carried out mostly with methods<br>
that are purely thermal (thermal cracking) or thermal-<br>
catalytic (catalytic cracking).<br>
Thermal cracking processes are conducted both in liquid<br>
phase, and in gas phase, at variable pressure from 10 to<br>
100 atm and at temperatures of between 450 and 600°C. The<br>
carbon-carbon bonds are broken by supplying heat from the<br>
outside.<br>
Catalytic cracking processes, more widely used by the oil<br>
industry, are conducted with the use of suitable<br>
catalysts, for example azodicarbonamide, which allow<br><br>
operation at slightly lower temperatures, about 500°C,<br>
and at ambient pressure.<br>
In both cases operating temperatures are reached by<br>
administering the necessary heat from the outside. Since<br>
administration from the outside is often hindered by the<br>
deposition of solid products (coke) on the exchange<br>
surfaces of the reactor, oxidation cracking is used, in<br>
which part of the required heat is developed inside the<br>
reaction by partial combustion of the hydrocarbons,<br>
supplying air or oxygen.<br>
In the last case, at the same time as the cracking<br>
reactions, polymerisation and condensation reactions also<br>
take place with formation of new carbon-carbon bonds.<br>
Such reactions, which also comprise the formation of<br>
coke, are undesired and can be reduced, but not avoided,<br>
by selecting suitable operating conditions.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, there is a great need to have a process for<br>
breaking chains of organic molecules of non-gaseous<br>
materials that allows aliphatic molecules to be produced<br>
with a number of carbon atoms preferably not greater than<br>
20, with a high yield of gaseous and liquid compounds,<br>
starting from aliphatic or cyclic organic macromolecules,<br>
with low costs and lower energy consumption.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a<br>
process having characteristics such as to satisfy the<br>
aforementioned requirements and at the same time to avoid<br>
the aforementioned drawbacks with reference to the prior<br>
art.<br>
A further purpose is to provide an apparatus specifically<br>
made to carry out such a process and that is at the same<br>
time simple, relatively easy to make, safe to use and that<br>
operates effectively, as well as being relatively<br><br>
inexpensive.<br>
Such purposes are accomplished through a process and<br>
an apparatus in accordance, respectively, with claim 1 and<br>
with claim 5 of the present invention.<br>
The dependent claims outline preferred and particularly<br>
advantageous embodiments of the process and of the <br>
apparatus according to the invention.	<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to the aforementioned figures, an apparatus<br>
for breaking the chains of organic molecules of solid<br>
materials, in accordance with the present invention is<br>
globally indicated with 1.<br>
The apparatus 1 in brief comprises a reactor 10 with an<br>
inlet opening 11 for the organic material to be<br>
processed, in fragmented or ground form, which shall be<br>
discussed in greater detail hereafter, and an outlet<br>
opening 12 for the products obtained.<br><br>
A feeding system 20 is connected to the inlet opening 11.<br>
In the example (see Fig.3), said feeding system 20<br>
comprising a horizontal worm screw 21 actuated through a<br>
geared motor 25 and provided at one end with a radial<br>
inlet mouth 22 for the material, facing upwards, and at<br>
the other end with an axial outlet mouth 23 placed in<br>
communication laterally with the inlet opening 11 of the<br>
reactor through a connection flange 24.<br>
At the inlet mouth 22 an agitator 26 with four blades 26a<br>
is arranged, actuated by a geared motor 27 and positioned<br>
at the base of and inside a cylindrical container 28,<br>
which is provided with a level indicator 29 and with an<br>
inspection hatch 213, communicating at the bottom with<br>
the inlet mouth 22 and at the top with a loading hopper<br>
210. Said hopper 210 communicates at the top with an<br>
aspirator 211 and a feeding duct 212 and at the bottom<br>
with a rotary valve 214. The hopper 210 comprises a<br>
cyclone separator, if necessary. The worm screw 21 has<br>
the function of dosing and feeding the material to the<br>
reactor 10.<br>
A separation system 30 is connected to the outlet opening<br>
12 of the reactor 10. In the example (see left hand side<br>
of Fig.2), said separation system 30 comprises a double<br>
worm screw-shaped extractor 31 with vertical axis,<br>
laterally connected to the outlet opening 12 of the<br>
reactor 10 through a flange 32 and closed sealed on top.<br>
The worm screw extractor 31 is provided with a pair of<br>
counter-rotating helicoids, or screws 33, (only one of<br>
which can be seen in figure 2) that intersect one<br>
another, actuated by a geared motor 34 to thrust<br>
downwards. Each screw 33 has two areas having the helix<br>
with a different pitch and thickness, a top area 35a<br>
where the helix has a small thickness (narrow crests) and<br><br>
has a small pitch, and a bottom area 35b where the same<br>
helix has a larger thickness (wide crests) and a larger<br>
pitch.<br>
An outlet duct 36 for the products in gas a vapour phase<br>
laterally extends from the top area 35a of the extractor<br>
31. Whereas the products in solid phase come out through<br>
axial openings 37, formed at the bottom.<br>
The outlet duct 36 for gas/vapours is connected to a<br>
vacuum pump (not illustrated) suitable for placing the<br>
extractor 31 in depression promoting the extraction of<br>
the light components. The current of gas/vapours coming<br>
out from the extractor 31 is then cooled to obtain the<br>
liquid phase from it separating it from the gaseous<br>
phase.<br>
The connection between the extractor 31 and the reactor<br>
10 through the flange 32 takes place laterally and<br>
centrally with respect to the two helicoids 33 at the<br>
bottom area 35b where the helix has the greater thickness<br>
and pitch. The flange 32 is provided with a sluice valve<br>
39 actuated by a hydraulic piston 40 to regulate the<br>
passage of products from the reactor 10 to the extractor<br>
31.<br>
In order to avoid the dispersion of heat, the worm screw<br>
extractor 31, usually made from steel, is insulated<br>
through an encasing jacket 38, made, for example, from<br>
ceramic wool.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the reactor 10<br>
is in the form of an assembly 13 comprising a cylindrical<br>
jacket 14 with a rotor 15 having a substantially<br>
horizontal axis on the inside. The inlet opening 11 is<br>
arranged radially at an end of the jacket 14, whereas the<br>
outlet opening 12 is arranged axially at the opposite end<br>
intercepted by the valve 39. In particular, the rotor 15<br><br>
is formed from a shaft 16 that comprises a plurality of<br>
squashing elements (15a-15h) , which we shall discuss more<br>
hereafter, fitted onto the shaft 16 so as to rotate with<br>
it.<br>
The shaft 16 is connected to a geared motor 17.<br>
In order to break the carbon chains of the organic<br>
material fed through the feeding system 20, the rotor 15<br>
has a configuration such as to manage to subject the<br>
material to a mechanical action such as to obtain a<br>
mixture with pasty consistency, i.e. that is soft and<br>
yielding to the touch.<br>
Such a mechanical action causes a stretching and a<br>
squashing of the material in the reactor 10 that make it<br>
assume the pasty consistency.<br>
In particular, this mechanical action creates great<br>
friction inside the organic material causing a<br>
temperature and pressure increase that triggers reactions<br>
that break the long molecular bonds, until products with<br>
short chains are obtained, i.e. products with a number of<br>
carbon atoms preferably less than 20.<br>
The breaking of the molecular chains can occur with<br>
exothermal reactions, which themselves contribute to the<br>
temperature increase inside the reactor 10 until values<br>
of over 350°C are reached, according to the internal and<br>
external friction that develops in the material and that<br>
also depends upon the type of material processed.<br>
The pressure undergone by the material inside the reactor<br>
10 is such as to generate the flow between the rotor 15<br>
and the jacket 14, which gives rise to the squashing and<br>
stretching actions.<br>
The peripheral speed of the worm screw shall be between<br>
100 and 400 m/min. according to the viscosity of the<br>
material.<br><br>
To avoid the formation of oxidised products, the reaction<br>
inside the reactor 10 is made to occur in the total<br>
absence of air. This also allows high yields of liquid<br>
and gaseous hydrocarbons with low molecular weight, i.e.<br>
preferably no more than 20 carbon atoms, to be obtained.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment and for better resistance<br>
to wear, the elements forming the peripheral part of the<br>
rotor 15 and that are in direct contact with the material<br>
are made from hydrocarbon-based sintered steel.<br>
In the example (see Fig.4), the elements, adjacent to one<br>
another to form a single rotor 15, are eight in number.<br>
Starting from the inlet opening 11 of the material (on<br>
the right in the figures) the following can be<br>
identified:<br>
the jacket 14 having an internal diameter equal to D;<br>
-	a first element 15a having a four-threaded screw, with<br>
constant pitch, diameter not less than D and with core<br>
equal to at least 0.5 D, suitable for thrusting the<br>
material towards the outlet, said first element 15a<br>
exerts a mechanical action such as to advance the<br>
material with the minimum possible temperature increase;<br>
-	a second circular cylindrical element 15b having a<br>
diameter not greater than the diameter of the core of the<br>
element 15a sufficient to allow the material pushed<br>
forwards by the element 15a to flow into the interspace<br>
between said second element 15b and the jacket 14 and at<br>
the same time such as to prevent the passage of air<br>
coming from the inlet 11 thanks to the creation of a plug<br>
formed by the material itself that moves forward<br>
practically without temperature increase.<br>
In the example said second element has a length at least<br>
equal to half the diameter D.<br>
-	a third element 15c 'with single-threaded screw, with<br><br>
pitch P equal to at least 2D, diameter of the core not<br>
less than 0.85D, and length between 0.75 and 1.0 P<br>
suitable for thrusting the material towards the outlet<br>
12;<br>
-	a fourth element 15d with a screw identical to the<br>
third element 15c, but with opposite winding of the<br>
helix; such a fourth element 15d thrusts the material<br>
back to further increase the stress to which the material<br>
is subjected in order to reach the temperature necessary<br>
to trigger the reactions, possibly even exothermal, for<br>
breaking the long chains. Basically, the material is<br>
"remixed" in the area of the third 15c and fourth element<br>
15d;<br>
the thrusting towards the outlet 12 exerted by the<br>
element 15c overpowers the opposite thrusting exerted by<br>
15d since in the portion in question the viscosity of the<br>
material drastically decreases;<br>
- a fifth element 15e with a screw, preferably not<br>
longer than 1.5 turns, with winding in accordance with<br>
the fourth element 15d, but with shorter pitch, in the<br>
example equal to 0.5 D;<br>
-	a sixth element 15f with a screw, having the same pitch<br>
as the fifth element 15e with a screw with opposite<br>
winding of the helix, i.e. thrusting towards the outlet<br><br>
12, and of slightly greater length, for example equal to<br>
2 turns.<br>
The length of the fifth and sixth element is about 0.85<br>
D.<br>
The fifth 15e and sixth element 15f also contribute to<br>
the creation of great friction inside the material, which<br>
overall advances towards the outlet 12;<br>
-	a seventh circular cylindrical or frustoconical element<br>
15g having a greater diameter than the second element 15b<br><br>
and such as to be arranged a distance of between 2 and 4<br>
mm from the jacket 14, so as to obtain a stretching with<br>
high friction of the material that with the subsequent<br>
cooling reaches a liquid and gaseous consistency, with<br>
solid residues. In this area the breaking of the carbon<br>
chains is completed to obtain a high yield of low<br>
molecular weight compounds.<br>
In the example, said seventh element 15g is 3 to 4 times<br>
the length of D.<br>
- an eighth element 15h with a screw of the same type as<br>
the first element 15a, which thrusts the material that is<br>
now entirely processed, and therefore in the form of<br>
finished product, towards the outlet opening 12.<br>
Basically, the area (Fig.5) occupied from the third<br>
element 15c up to the seventh element 15g is where the<br>
chemical breaking actions by thermo-mechanical action of<br>
the molecular chains take place.<br>
In the example, the overall length of the rotor 15 is<br>
equal to 15 to 20 times D and the geared motor that<br>
actuates it absorbs from 0.2 to 0.6 kWh per Kg of<br>
material treated. Moreover, the jacket 14 is made in many<br>
pieces, in the example three. In particular, in the area<br>
in which the chemical reactions take place, the portion<br>
of jacket facing towards the inside of the reactor 10 is<br>
made with a ceramic cylinder 140 having high mechanical,<br>
thermal and chemical resistance.<br>
In order to avoid the dispersion of heat, the reactor 10<br>
is insulated through an encasing jacket 110, made, for<br>
example, from ceramic wool.<br>
Operatively, the organic material to be processed, which<br>
comprises solid organic substances having chemical bonds<br>
with long chains, generally more than 20 carbon atoms, is<br>
fed through a suitable transporter, for example pneumatic<br><br>
or using a worm screw, in broken up solid form or paste<br>
form through the feeding duct 212. In the case of broken<br>
up solid form a cyclone separator is arranged in the<br>
loading hopper 210.<br>
The material falls by gravity and passes through the<br>
rotary valve 214, into the container 28 where it is mixed<br>
by the agitator 26, which conveys the material towards<br>
the inlet mouth 22 of the worm screw 21. The worm screw<br>
21 doses and feeds the material to the reactor 10 through<br>
the inlet opening 11. The rotor 15 thrusts the material,<br>
which during the journey undergoes the chemical<br>
transformation, towards the outlet opening 12. From here<br>
the reaction products are sent, by opening the valve 39,<br>
to the worm screw extractor 31 of the separation system<br>
30, where the double screw 33 promotes the separation of<br>
the gas and solid phases. The products in gas and vapour<br>
phase go out through the duct 36, whereas the products in<br>
solid phase go out through the bottom openings 37.<br>
The mechanical action exerted by the rotor 15 on the<br>
material generates friction that raises the temperature<br>
of the material itself up to at least 250°C. This allows<br>
the chemical reactions necessary to break the long chains<br>
of the organic compounds to begin (in the area of the<br>
third element 15c). The triggering of the reactions is<br>
caused by the mechanical action of the third element 15c.<br>
In addition, the total absence of air, thanks to the plug<br>
of material that is formed in the area of the second<br>
element 15b, prevents the formation of undesired oxidised<br>
products (such as aldehydes) and improves the yield of<br>
the compounds with shorter chains.<br>
Basically, not only heat is not supplied from the<br>
outside, but the entry of air into the reactor 10 is also<br>
prevented, at least in the portion in which the chain-<br><br>
breaking reactions occur.<br>
However, in the last portion, with the reactions already<br>
substantially having occurred, it is sometimes advisable<br>
to carry out heating with electrical resistances or<br>
equivalent means.<br>
Therefore, the breaking of the molecular bonds is started<br>
and aided by the heat that develops inside the reactor<br>
following the mechanical action exerted exclusively by<br>
the rotor 15, which is made to rotate with peripheral<br>
speed of more than 100 m/min.<br>
To make it easier to manage the apparatus it is possible<br>
to implement a control and management system that,<br>
suitably programmed, allows all of the operations to be<br>
carried out automatically.<br>
The initial solid organic material can be of any origin,<br>
for example plastic materials (even non-homogeneous ones<br>
that therefore cannot be recycled with conventional<br>
processes), vulcanised or thermoplastic rubbers<br>
originating from industrial waste and vehicle tyres,<br>
vegetable meals, pasty or semi-liquid products, etc.<br>
In the treatment of materials originating from the<br>
recovery of tyres and vegetable-based meals, it has been<br>
observed that there are more solid carbon residues than<br>
with other materials.<br>
To reduce such residues it is preferable to add hydrogen<br>
inside the reactor 10, in the portion in which the<br>
reactions take place (between the fourth 15d and the<br>
sixth element 15f). Alternatively, it is possible to use<br>
less expensive methane.<br>
The described process applied to the treatment of tyres<br>
allows a vast range of products to be obtained, such as<br>
devulcanised rubbers that can be reused mixed with new<br><br>
raw materials, hydrocarbons like fuels of the liquid gas<br><br>
type (LPG), hydrocarbons like petrol or diesel, heavy<br>
oil, carbon residue that can also be used as an additive<br>
for bitumen, or else with possible addition of overheated<br>
steam, it can be used as a fuel.<br>
The treatment of non-homogeneous plastic materials with<br>
the described process allows gaseous hydrocarbons, liquid<br>
hydrocarbons, and small amounts of solid carbon residues<br>
to be obtained.<br>
As can be appreciated from what has been described, the<br>
process and the apparatus according to the present<br>
invention allow the requirements to be satisfied and allow<br>
the drawbacks mentioned in the introductory part of the<br>
present description with reference to the prior art to be<br>
overcome.<br>
Indeed, the process allows the carbon links to be broken<br>
and allows a high yield of products with a low number of<br>
carbon atoms to be obtained, without needing to supply<br>
heat from the outside, with a consequent saving of<br>
energy, preventing the entry of air inside the reactor, in<br>
the absence of any catalyst, allowing gas and liquid fuel<br>
to be obtained.<br>
Moreover, said process can be carried out with a simple<br>
apparatus that requires little maintenance, like for<br>
example a worm screw-shaped reactor.<br>
In addition, the process does not give rise to any type<br>
of emission into the atmosphere.<br>
A thermodynamic cracking process is thus obtained that<br>
uses just the mechanical action on the material to be<br>
treated, in the absence of air, causing a temperature<br>
increase up to the decomposition temperature by internal<br>
and external friction.<br>
Obviously, a man skilled in the art can make numerous<br>
modifications and variations to the process and to the<br><br>
