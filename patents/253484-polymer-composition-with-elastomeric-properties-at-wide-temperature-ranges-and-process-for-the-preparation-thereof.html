				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the techniques used in obtaining polymer compositions and, more particularly, it relates to a copolymer composition having elastomeric properties at wide temperature ranges.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is a vast amount of polymer composition applications wherein the elements or objects therefrom require having elastomeric properties, that is, to exhibit extensibility and flexibility properties allowing them to recover their shape after being considerably extended.<br>
Due to the above, a great variety of materials having elastomeric properties have been developed over time, with styrene-butadiene copolymers being among the most renowned and widely used ones:<br>
Although it is possible to find in the state of the art a great variety of elastomeric polymer compositions having various mechanical or physical properties such as hardness, tensile strength, or modulus of elasticity, among others, the compositions known so far lose their elastomeric properties with temperature, which limits the optimal performance thereof when they are to be used in high-temperature applications.<br>
With the development of more effective polymerization catalyzers, such as the one depicted in the patent application MX 9801717, it has been possible to control the structure of polymers, allowing thus to obtain regularity in chains. Thus, in the case of styrene elastomers, syndiotactic polystyrene has been used in order to achieve beneficial results for the properties of the polymer compositions therefrom.<br>
For instance, US Patent 5,260,394 depicts a syndiotactic polystyrene copolymer with inserts of olefin and/or dienic monomers exhibiting proper chemical and thermal resistance properties, in addition to allowing an appropriate processing and good compatibility with other compositions. The copolymers depicted therein aim<br>
to have materials with good processing by injection molding due to their low glass transition temperature.<br>
Likewise, US Patent 5,352,727 depicts a syndiotactic polystyrene composition modified with rubber aiming to provide such composition with better processing properties when it is reprocessed after being used once, keeping its mechanical and heat decomposition resistance properties after being reprocessed.<br>
Generally, other documents such as US Patents 6,046,275; US 6,191,197; US 5,352,727; US 5,260,394; US 5,543,462; and US 5,777,028 use various mixtures of syndiotactic polystyrene with other polymers or copolymers allowing to modify the mechanical and processing properties of such a polymer compositions.<br>
However, none of these documents introduce a composition having elastomeric properties at wide temperature ranges since, due to the nature of the compatibilizing agents normally used to obtain compositions in stereoregular polymers, such compositions cannot be used at low temperatures and therefore the use of this kind of materials continues to be limited to temperatures over -4 °F.<br>
According to the above, we have pretended to overcome the disadvantages of known elastomeric compositions by obtaining a polymer composition not also having elastomeric properties at wide temperature ranges, but which can be used at high temperatures and keeps its impact strength, chemical, mechanical, and wear resistance properties under high temperatures, in addition to keep its elastomeric properties at temperatures under -4 °F.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Considering the limitations of the compositions depicted in the previous art, it is an object of the present invention to provide a polymer composition having elastomeric properties at wide temperature ranges, which is homogeneous and compatible, such composition resulting from stereoregular polymers and not requiring the use of additional compatibilizing agents.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a polymer composition having elastomeric properties at wide temperature ranges which keeps<br>
its chemical, mechanical, and wear resistance properties, as well as its processing and impact strength properties.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a polymer composition having elastomeric properties at wide temperature ranges which is compatible with other polymer materials when being mixed with them.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a polymer composition having elastomeric properties at wide temperature ranges which may be properly processed as a film, by thermoforming, injection, or extrusion.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Novel aspects considered to be characteristic of the present invention will be established with detail in the appended claims. However, the operation, as well as other objects and advantages thereof, will be better understood in the light of the following detailed description of a specific embodiment thereof, considered according to the appended figure, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a graph of the modulus of elasticity (G') of some embodiments of the polymer composition of the present invention which are illustrated in the example.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been found that a combination of dienic vinyl aromatic polymers having an orderly structure may result in a polymer composition having elastomeric properties at a temperature range from -121 °F (188.15 K) to 572 °F (573.15 K).<br>
More specifically, the polymer composition of the present invention allowing to achieve elastomeric behavior at wide temperature ranges comprises from 15 to 85% by weight of a copolymer having at least a block from 10 to 5000 structural sequences, which are mainly syndiotactic in nature, of monomer units resulting from at least one substituted or unsubstituted vinyl aromatic monomer, and at least one block formed from 10 to 4000 monomer units resulting from at least one dienic monomer having mainly a 1,4-cis structure; from 15 to 85% by weight of a polymer resulting from dienic monomers, having a molecular weight from 1000 to 600000, the<br>
contents of 1,4-cis-type monomer units being of at least 90%; and up to 70% of a polymer resulting from substituted or unsubstituted vinyl aromatic monomers, having a molecular weight from 1000 to 500000 and a degree of syndiotacticity in terms of syndiotactic pentads of at least 95%.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, vinyl aromatic monomers are selected from styrene and substituted styrene, the substituents being preferably selected from the alkyl, halide, alkoxyl, and amine groups. In a specific embodiment, vinyl aromatic monomers are selected from styrene, 4-methyl-styrene, 4-ter-butyl styrene, 4-methoxy styrene, 4-trimethylsililoxy styrene, 4-bromo styrene, and 4-(N-N'-dimethyl amine) styrene.<br>
Regarding the dienic monomer, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the dienic monomer is selected from buta-1,3-diene and 2-methyl buta-1,3-diene.<br>
In an additional embodiment of the polymer composition of the present invention, the fraction formed by the monomer units resulting from the dienic monomer may be partially or fully hydrogenated, that is, monomer units -CH2-CH=CH-CH2- may be partially or fully converted into the monomer units -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, whereas the monomer units -CH2-C(CH=CH2)H- may be partially or fully converted into the monomer units -CH2-C(CH2-CH3)H-, 95% of the monomer units resulting from the dienic monomer being preferably hydrogenated.<br>
In an additional embodiment of the present invention, the polymer composition contains from 0.01 to 4% by weight of at least one organic or inorganic additive depending on the final destination of the composition and, more preferably, less than 3.7%.<br>
Preferably, inorganic additives are selected from compounds containing aluminum and, more preferably, aluminum oxide, or compounds with the general formula (-AI(X)O-)n, wherein X is a hydroxyl, alkoxyde, or alkyl group, which are obtained by making react the compounds having the general formula (-AI(R)O-)m with water or alcohols, wherein R is an alkyl group, n and m are natural numbers which may be residues from the catalytic system.<br>
Likewise, it is preferred that organic additives include at least one antioxidant agent, preferably selected from useful antioxidants in compositions<br>
ontaining   styrene   and   butadiene   and,   more   preferably,   selected  from   those containing phenols, phosphates, and amines.<br>
The polymer composition of the present invention has a first glass transition temperature (Tg 1) within the temperature range between -148 °F and -194 °F; a second glass transition temperature (Tg 2) within the temperature range between 203 °F and 248 °F; as well as a melting temperature Tm within the temperature range between 428 °F and 572 °F. The elastomeric behavior of the polymer composition of the present invention ranges from -121 °F up to the dienic-polymer degradation temperature. Likewise, the modulus of elasticity may vary between 10 and 1000 MPa within the temperature range between -121 °F and 194 °F, and between 3 and 100 MPa within the temperature range between 248 °F and the dienic polymer temperature.<br>
The polymer composition of the present invention may be prepared by a process comprising a first contact polymerization stage of at least one vinyl aromatic monomer which is polymerizable by a catalytic system as that comprising a pre-catalyzer consisting of one or more compounds pertaining to the class of compounds such as titanium fluorenyl trialkoxyde (IV), and an activating compound selected from aluminum compounds obtained by trialkylaluminum hydrolysis and, more preferably, a methyl aluminoxane, such as that depicted in the patent application MX 9801717, in mass form or with the presence of a dissolvent selected from aromatic dissolvent and, more preferably, toluene, as well as from aliphatic dissolvents and, more preferably, 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane, or a mixture thereof, at a temperature between 32 °F and 194 °F for a period of time between 1 and 30 minutes; such a contact being followed by a second polymerization stage through subsequent addition of a dienic monomer at a temperature between 32 °F and 158 °F to form an unsaturated polymer composition.<br>
The unsaturated polymer composition is polymerized for period of time between 10 minutes and 6 hours, and it is then mixed with an alcohol selected from aliphatic alcohols in order to end the polymerization reaction. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the aliphatic alcohol has from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, with isopropanol being preferred.<br>
Once the reaction has come to an end, the composition is finally subjected to a stage of catalytic residue removal by using a mixture of an aliphatic<br>
alcohol and a solvent with at least one substituted or unsubstituted aromatic ring. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the aliphatic alcohol: aromatic solvent ratio is between 0.5:1 and 5:1, with a 1:1 ratio being preferred. The aliphatic alcohol from the stage of catalytic residue removal is preferably selected from alcohols having between 1 and 4 carbon atoms, preferably isopropanol, with the preferred aromatic solvent being toluene.<br>
In an additional embodiment of the present invention, it has been surprisingly found that, at the end of the dienic monomer polymerization stage or once the dienic monomer has been converted at least by 50%, the non-hydrogenated polymer composition may be subjected to a hydrogenation stage in situ by direct contact with hydrogen at a partial hydrogen pressure between 10 and 150 psig and a temperature between 32 °F and 194 °F and, more preferably, a partial hydrogen pressure between 20 and 100 psig and a temperature between 68 °F and 158 °F. It is yet more surprising that the hydrogenation stage of the non-hydrogenated polymer composition may be performed without the need of using additional hydrogenation catalyzers, which results in materials having up to 95% of hydrogenated polybutadiene.<br>
The polymer composition of the present invention will be illustrated more clearly by the following examples, which are presented only as an illustration and thus do not limit the same.<br>
Polymerization processes were performed according to what is depicted below.<br>

Figure 1 compares the viscoelastic behavior of the polymer compositions of the present invention with that of a conventional SBR elastomer. It is clearly seen that the modulus of elasticity (G1) of the polymer composition of the present invention is maintained within the temperature range from -121 °F to 536 °F,<br>
a range in which the material of the present invention does not flow. Conversely, a conventional elastomer loses its viscoelastic properties before the polystyrene-stage Tg takes place, at about 158 °F.<br>
