TITLE: CONCEALED CAR GEARSHIFT LEVER LOCK BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is related to a car gearshift lever lock, and more particularly to one that improves locking efficiency and prevents from tempering.<br>
(b)	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Number of sedans is ever increasing by year as people pursue transportation comfort and convenience thanks to the upgraded income. Additional to traffic jam and fighting for a parking space, burglar is the worst nightmare to the car owner.    Therefore, most of the car owners will have install burglarproof device to their cars.   Among all the burglarproof devices, the gearshift level lock that prevents the burglar from shifting the gear is most popular, and particularly the concealed gearshift level lock is preferred for reason that it only allows the bolt exposed without compromising the appearance of the interior.   The concealed gearshift level lock of the prior art, as illustrated in FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings, is essentially having fixed a transmission (not illustrated) faceplate to the chassis 11 of a car 1 with the gearshift lever 13 exposed upward through the center of the faceplate 12; a lid 14 provided on the faceplate 12, and a rubber protection hood 15 provided<br><br>
at and seal up where the gearshift lever 13 meets the lid 14 so to fend off foreign matter. A gearshift lever lock 2 has the lower end of a positioning steel plate 21 screwed to the chassis 11, and a lockset 22 is provided on the upper end of the positioning steel plate 21 to permit a bolt 23 to penetrate through the lockset 22 and expose at the other side of the gearshift lever 13 for the bolt 23 to prevent the gearshift lever 13 from moving ahead thus to secure the gearshift lever 13. Even a burglar has managed to enter into the car and start the engine he wouldn't be able to shift the gear. The prior art does prevent the gearshift lever from tampering. However, upon its installation, multiple holes must be drilled on the chassis 11 since the positioning steel plate 21 has its lower end screwed to the chassis. The drilling would have to affect the strength of the chassis. Therefore, all manufacturers of higher-end cars strictly prohibit the car owners from any of such drilling to the chassis. Furthermore, the end of the bolt 23 exposed from the side of the gearshift lever 13 is not provided any positioning structure, meaning, the bolt is in suspension status. That is, the bolt 23 is only supported on the side where the lockset 2 is provided to result in poor fixation of the bolt. Any burglar could easily force the gearshift lever up by inserting a hollow tube onto the exposed end of the bolt 23. Once the bolt 23 is forced to move up at where beyond the gearshift lever 13, the gearshift lever is released so that the burglar could easily drive away the car. This provides further improvement to the prior art of the concealed gearshift lever lock.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary purpose of the present invention is to provide a concealed gearshift lever lock mat improves the locking efficiency. Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a concealed gearshift lever lock that prevents the positioning plate from being removed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following descriptions are of exemplary embodiments only, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the following description provides a convenient illustration for implementing exemplary embodiments of the invention. Various changes to the described embodiments may be made in the function and arrangement of the elements described without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2 and. 3, a gearshift lever lock of the present invention is comprised of a positioning plate 3, a lockset 4 and a bolt 5.   Wherein, the positioning plate 3 approximately indicates a U shape and two corresponding locking holes 31,32 are respectively provided on both sides.   Two fixation members 33 each provided with an eyelet 331 are respectively extending from both sides at the close end of the positioning plate 3.   One hole 61 is each provided at four comers of a transmission (not illustrated) faceplate 6 in a diameter slightly greater than that of the eyelet 331.   The chassis 7 of the car has a fastener 71 to penetrate through the hole 61, and further through the positioning plate 3 before being screwed to the upper side of the faceplate 6 by means of a grub nut 8.   The lockset 4 is attached to one side of the positioning plate 3 by means of a hook 41 or any other proper means in<br><br>
practice.   A locking hole 42 provided on the lockset 4 and is merely at where in relation to a locking hole 31 of the positioning plate 3.    Accordingly, the bolt 5 penetrates through the lockset 4 and exposed out of another locking 32 provided on the other side of the positioning plate 3 to lock up.   Also referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the bolt 5 is made resting against the front side end or tie rear side end of a gearshift lever 9 so to restrict the gearshift lever 9 in position preventing from being moved to its front or rear, thus it is impossible to execute shifting gear.<br>
Now referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, the grub nut 8 has a polygonal head 81 and a conic base 82 in an arrow shape with its point at the top is provided beneath the polygonal head 81.   A tube 83 in a smaller outer diameter is extended from the conic base 82, and a screw hole 84 is provided through the conic base 82 and the tube 83.   Meanwhile, the tube 83 is provided in a height lower than that of the fixation member 33 so that when the grub nut 8 is screwed to the fastener 71, the height of the 83 is at where lower than that of the fixation member 33 for preventing the tube 83 from holding against the faceplate 6 and losing the packing torque.    Once the grub nut 8 is tightened up and subsequent rotation is forced, the strength at the section where the head 81 meets the conic base is comparatively weaker due to the tube 83 is in smaller outer diameter, the section will break up and the head 81 will clear<br><br>
away from the conic base 82 when the torque applied thereon becomes greater than the strength.   After the head breaks up, the conic base 81 remains firmly secured since it is prevented from being rotated, by a wrench.   Since the positioning plate 3 cannot be removed, the locking result provided by the gearshift lock is assured.   Whereas the fastener 71 used to lock up both of the positioning plate 3 and the faceplate 6 is originally used to secure the faceplate (5 and the chassis 7, there is no need to drill holes on the chassis as observed in the prior art to cause strength failure to the chassis 7.   Furthermore, as illustrated in FIG. 8, the eyelet 331 to the fixation member 33 is made in a form of a bore having a larger upper section and a smaller lower section for the lower end of the conic base 82 of the grub nut 8 to settle in the eyelet 331, thus to reduce the size of the base conic 82 protruding from the fixation member 33 for further preventing tampering.<br>
As the positioning plate 3 indicates a U shape and two locking holes 31, 32 are respectively provided on both sides of the positioning plate 3, the bolt 5 inserted through and locked by those two locking holes 31,32 are supported on both sides of the positioning plate 3 to further secure the bolt 5 and keep its end exposed out of the locking hole 32 is minimized; accordingly, if a tube is used to attempt inserting onto the bolt 5, the moment is too small to be applied any force to destroy the bolt 5 to ensure of the locking effect.<br><br>
The structure of the present invention is innovative, and provides the improved function for anti-burglar for the car to meet the requirements of a utility patent.   Therefore, this application is duly filed accordingly.<br>
It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together may also find a useful application in other types of methods differing from the type described above.<br>
While certain novel features of this invention have been shown and described and are pointed out in the annexed claim, it is not intended to be limited to the details above, since it will be understood that various omissions, modifications, substitutions and changes in the forms and details of the device illustrated and in its operation can be made by those skilled in the art without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
