				<td>PHOSPHONOOXY QUINAZOLINE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR PHARMACEUTICAL USE<br>
The present invention relates to certain quinazoline derivatives for use in the treatment of certain diseases in particular to proliferative disease such as cancer and in the preparation of medicaments for use in the treatment of proliferative disease, to novel quinazoline compounds and to processes for their preparation, as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient.<br>
Cancer (and other hyperproliferative disease) is characterised by uncontrolled cellular proliferation. This loss of the normal regulation of cell proliferation often appears to occur as the result of genetic damage to cellular pathways that control progress through the cell cycle. In eukaryotes, an ordered cascade of protein phosphorylation is thought to control the cell cycle. Several families of protein kinases that play critical roles in this cascade have now been identified. The activity of many of these kinases is increased in human tumours when compared to normal tissue. This can occur by either increased levels of expression of the protein (as a result of gene amplification for example), or by changes in expression of co activators or inhibitory proteins.<br>
The first identified, and most widely studied of these cell cycle regulators have been the cyclin dependent kinases (or CDKs). Activity of specific CDKs at specific times is essential for both initiation and coordinated progress through the cell cycle. For example, the CDK4 protein appears to control entry into the cell cycle (the GO-G1-S transition) by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma gene product pRb. This stimulates the release of the transcription factor E2F from pRb, which then acts to increase the transcription of genes necessary for entry into S phase. The catalytic activity of CDK4 is stimulated by binding to a partner protein, Cyclin D. One of the first demonstrations of a direct link between cancer and the cell cycle was made with the observation that the Cyclin Dl gene was amplified and cyclin D protein levels increased (and hence the activity of CDK4 increased) in many human tumours (Reviewed in Sherr, 1996, Science 274: 1672-1677; Pines, 1995, Seminars in Cancer Biology 6: 63-72). Other studies (Loda et al., 1997, Nature Medicine 3(2): 231 -234; Gemma et al., 1996, International Journal of Cancer 68(5): 605-11; Elledge et al. 1996, Trends in Cell Biology 6; 388-392) have shown that negative regulators of CDK function are frequently down regulated or deleted in human tumours again leading to inappropriate activation of these kinases.<br><br>
More recently, protein kinases that are structurally distinct from the CDK family have been identified which play critical roles in regulating the cell cycle and which also appear to be important in oncogenesis. These include the newly identified human homologues of the Drosophila aurora and S.cerevisiae Ipll proteins. The three human homologues of these genes Aurora-A, Aurora-B and Aurora-C (also known as aurora2, auroral and auroraS respectively) encode cell cycle regulated serine-threonine protein kinases (summarised in Adams et al, 2001, Trends in Cell Biology. 11(2): 49-54).  These show a peak of expression and kinase activity through G2 and mitosis. Several observations implicate the involvement of human aurora proteins in cancer. The Aurora-A gene maps to chromosome 20ql3, a region that is frequently amplified in human tumours including both breast and colon tumours. Aurora-A may be the major target gene of this amplicon, since Aurora-A DNA is amplified and mRNA overexpressed in greater than 50% of primary human colorectal cancers. In these tumours Aurora-A protein levels appear greatly elevated compared to adjacent normal tissue. In addition, transfection of rodent fibroblasts with human Aurora-A leads to transformation, conferring the ability to grow in soft agar and form tumours in nude mice (Bischoff et al., 1998, The EMBO Journal. 17(11): 3052-3065). Other work (Zhou et al., 1998, Nature Genetics. 20(2): 189-93) has shown that artificial overexpression of Aurora-A. leads to an increase in centrosome number and an increase in aneuploidy, a known event in :he development of cancer. Further work has shown an increase hi expression of Aurora-B Adams et al., 2001, Chromsoma. 110(2):65-74) and Aurora-C (Kimura et al, 1999, Journal jf Biological Chemistry, 274(11): 7334-40) in tumour cells when compared to normal cells.<br>
Importantly, it has also been demonstrated that abrogation of Aurora-A expression and unction by antisense oligonucleotide treatment of human tumour cell lines (WO 97/22702 tnd WO 99/37788) leads to cell cycle arrest and exerts an antiproliferative effect in these amour cell lines. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors of Aurora-A and Aurora-B have ieen demonstrated to have an antiproliferative effect in human tumour cells (Keen et al. 2001 'oster #2455, American Association of Cancer research annual meeting), as has selective brogation of Aurora-B expression alone by siRNA treatment (Ditchfield et al. 2003, journal f Cell Biology, 161(2): 267-280). This indicates that inhibition of the function of Aurora-A ad/or Aurora-B will have an antiproliferative effect that may be useful in the treatment of uman tumours and other hyperproliferative disease. Further, inhibition of Aurora kinases as a therapeutic approach to these diseases may have significant advantages over targeting signalling pathways upstream of the cell cycle (e.g. those activated by growth factor receptor<br><br>
tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or other receptors). Since the cell cycle is ultimately downstream of all of these diverse signalling events, cell cycle directed therapies such as inhibition of Aurora kinases would be predicted to be active across all proliferating tumour cells, whilst approaches directed at specific signalling molecules (e.g. EGFR) would be predicted to be active only in the subset of rumour cells which express those receptors. It is also believed that significant "cross talk" exists between these signalling pathways meaning that inhibition of one component may be compensated for by another.<br>
A number of quinazoline derivatives have been proposed hitherto for use in the inhibition of various kinases. For example, WO 96/09294, WO 96/15118 and WO 99/06378 describe the use of certain quinazoline compounds as receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which may be useful in the treatment of proliferative disease and WO 00/21955 discloses certain quinazoline derivatives as inhibitors of the effects of VEGF.<br>
Quinazoline derivatives have also been disclosed for use in the inhibition of Aurora-A kinase. WO 02/00649 discloses quinazoline derivative bearing a 5-membered heteroaromatic ring where the ring is, in particular, substituted thiazole or substituted thiophene and co-pending patent application WO 03/055491 discloses quinazoline derivatives bearing an optionally substituted pyrazole ring. However despite the compounds of WO 02/00649 and WO 03/055491 there still exists the need for further compounds having Aurora kinase inhibitory properties.<br>
The applicants have been successful in finding a novel series of compounds which inhibit the effects of the Aurora kinases and in particular Aurora-A and/or Aurora-B kinase and which have certain properties that make them particularly useful in formulating medicaments for the treatment of disease. In particular the compounds are of use in the treatment of proliferative disease such as cancer occurring as either solid and haematological tumours where Aurora kinases are known to be active, and especially in diseases such as colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, pancreatic or bladder and renal cancer as well as leukaemias and lymphomas.<br>

It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substiruent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogen group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or alkyl sulphonyl.<br>
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1991). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br><br>
protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or ter/-butoxycarbonyl group, an aryhnethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a /er/'-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example., by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group maybe removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaniinopropylamirie, or with hydrazine. A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, fo* example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an ^cyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide-Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, "by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a tert-bntyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, t&gt;y hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br><br>

The compounds of the invention inhibit the serine-threonine kinase activity of the Aurora kinases, in particular Aurora-A and/or Aurora-B and thus inhibit the cell cycle aid cell proliferation. These properties may be assessed for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below.   Whilst not wishing to be bound by theoretical constraints, it is believed that the compounds of formula (I) described herein may act as prodrugs. In procedures (c) and (d) set out below it is believed that a phosphonooxy group present in he compound of formula (I) is cleaved in situ to yield a hydroxy group and that such cleavaje is necessary for activity is these assays, (a)       In Vitro Aurora-A kinase inhibition test<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit serine-threonine kiase activity. DNA encoding Aurora-A may be obtained by total gene synthesis or by cloning.rhis DNA may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with serine-threonine kinase activity, hi the case of Aurora-A, the coding sequence was isolate! from cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the BamHl and Notl restriction endonuclease sites of the baculovirus expression vector pFastBac HTc (GibcoBRL/Life technologies). The 5' PCR primer contained a recognition sequence for tb restriction endonuclease BamHl 5' to the Aurora-A coding sequence. This allowed the<br><br>
insertion of the Aurora-A gene in frame with the 6 histidine residues, spacer region and rTEV protease cleavage site encoded by the pFastBac HTc vector. The 3' PCR primer replaced the Aurora-A stop codon with additional coding sequence followed by a stop codon and a recognition sequence for the restriction endonuclease Notl. This additional coding sequence (5' TAG CCA TAG GAT GTT CCA GAT TAG GCT TCT TAA 3') encoded for the polypeptide sequence YPYDVPDYAS. This sequence, derived from the influenza hemagglutin protein, is frequently used as a tag epitope sequence that can be identified using specific monoclonal antibodies. The recombinant pFastBac vector therefore encoded for an N-terrninally 6 bis tagged, C terminally influenza hemagglutin epitope tagged Aurora-A protein. Details of the methods for the assembly of recombinant DNA molecules can be found in standard texts, for example Sambrook et al. 1989, Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press and Ausubel et al. 1999, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons hie.<br>
Production of recombinant virus can be performed following manufacturer's protocol from GibcoBRL. Briefly, the pFastBac-1 vector carrying the Aurora-A gene was transformed into E. coli DHlOBac cells containing the baculovirus genome (bacmid DNA) and via a transposition event in the cells, a region of the pFastBac vector containing gentamycin resistance gene and the Aurora-A gene including the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter was transposed directly into the bacmid DNA. By selection on gentamycin, kanamycin, tetracycline and X-gal, resultant white colonies should contain recombinant bacmid DNA encoding Aurora-A. Bacmid DNA was extracted from a small scale culture of several BHIOBac white colonies and transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda S£21 cells grown in TCI00 medium (GibcoBRL) containing 10% serum using CellFECTIN reagent (GibcoBRL) following manufacturer's instructions. Virus particles were harvested by collecting cell culture medium 72 hrs post transfection. 0.5 mis of medium was used to infect 100 ml suspension culture of S£21 s containing 1 x 107 cells/ml. Cell culture medium was harvested 48 hrs post infection and virus titre determined using a standard plaque assay procedure. Virus stocks were used to infect Sf9 and "High 5" cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 to ascertain expression of recombinant Aurora-A protein.<br>
For the large scale expression of Aurora-A kinase activity, Sf21 insect cells were grown at 28°C in TCI 00 medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Viralex) and 0.2% F68 Pluronic (Sigma) on a Wheaton roller rig at 3 r.p.m. When the cell density reached 1.2xl06 cells ml"1 they were infected with plaque-pure Aurora-A recombinant virus at a<br><br>
multiplicity of infection of 1 and harvested 48 hours later. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4°C. Frozen insect cell pellets containing a total of 2.0 x 108 cells were thawed and diluted with lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES (N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-[2-ethanesulphonic acid]) pH7.4 at 4°C, 100 mM KC1,25 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF (phenyknethylsulphonyl fluoride), 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM imidazole, 1 ug/ml aprotinin, 1 ug/ml pepstatin, 1 pg/ml leupeptin), using 1.0 ml per 3 x 107 cells. Lysis was achieved using a dounce homogeniser, following which the lysate was centrifuged at 41,000^ for 35 minutes. Aspirated supernatant was pumped onto a 5 mm diameter chromatography column containing 500 pi Ni NTA (nitrilo-tri-acetic acid) agarose (Qiagen, product no. 30250) which had been equilibrated in lysis buffer. A baseline level of UV absorbance for the eluent was reached after washing the column with 12 ml of lysis buffer followed by 7 ml of wash buffer (25 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C , 100 mM KC1,20 mM imidazole, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Bound Aurora-A protein was eluted from the column using elution buffer (25 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C , 100 mM KC1, 400 mM imidazole, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). An elution fraction (2.5 ml) corresponding to the peak in UV absorbance was collected. The elution fraction, containing active Aurora-A kinase, was dialysed exhaustively against dialysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C , 45% glycerol (v/v), 100 mM KC1, 0.25% Nonidet P40 (v/v), 1 mM dithiothreitol).<br>
Each new batch of Aurora-A enzyme was titrated in the assay by dilution with enzyme diluent (25mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 12.5mM KC1, 0.6mM DTT). For a typical batch, stock enzyme is diluted 1 in 666 with enzyme diluent and 20ul of dilute enzyme is used for each assay well. Test compounds (at lOmM in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) were diluted with water and lOfil of diluted compound was transferred to wells in the assay plates. "Total" and "blank" control wells contained 2.5% DMSO instead of compound. Twenty microlitres of freshly diluted enzyme was added to all wells, apart from "blank" wells. Twenty microlitres of enzyme diluent was added to "blank" wells. Twenty microlitres of reaction mix (25 mM Tris-HCl, 78.4 mM KC1, 2.5 mM NaF, 0.6 mM dithiothreitol, 6.25 mM MnCl2, 6.25 mM ATP, 7.5 uM peptide substrate [biotin-LRRWSLGLRRWSLGLRRWSLGLRRWSLG]) containing 0.2 \id ['y33P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia, specific activity &gt;2500 Ci/mmol) was then added to all test wells to start the reaction. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. To stop the reaction 100 jil 20% v/v orthophosphoric acid was added to all wells. The peptide substrate was captured on positively-charged nitrocellulose P30 filtermat (Whatman) using a 96-well plate harvester (TomTek) and then assayed for<br><br>
incorporation of 33P with a Beta plate counter. "Blank" (no enzyme) and "total" (no compound) control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50% inhibition of enzyme activity.<br>
In this test, the compounds of the invention give 50% inhibition of enzyme activity at concentrations of 0.3 nM to 1000 nM and in particular compound 5 in Table 1 gave 50% inhibition of enzyme activity at a concentration of 5.5 nM.<br>
(b) In Vitro Aurora-B kinase inhibition test<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit serine-threonine kinase activity. DNA encoding Aurora-B may be obtained by total gene synthesis or by cloning. This DNA may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with serine-threonine kinase activity, hi the case of Aurora-B, the coding sequence was isolated from cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the pFastBac system in a manner similar to that described above for Aurora-A (i.e. to direct expression of a 6-histidine tagged Aurora-B protein).<br>
For the large scale expression of Aurora-B kinase activity, Sf21 insect cells were grown at 28°C in TC100 medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Viralex) and 0.2% F68 Pluronic (Sigma) on a Wheaton roller rig at 3 r.p.m. When the cell density reached 1.2x106 cells ml"1 they were infected with plaque-pure Aurora-B recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1 and harvested 48 hours later. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4°C. Frozen insect cell pellets containing a total of 2.0 x 108 cells were thawed and diluted with lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES (N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-[2-ethanesulphonic acid]) pH7.5 at 4°C , 1 mM NaaVCU, 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 ug/ml aprotinin, 1 ug/ml pepstatin, 1 ug/ml leupeptin), using 1.0 ml per 2 x 107 cells. Lysis was achieved using a sonication homogeniser, following which the lysate was centriruged at 41,000g for 35 minutes. Aspirated supernatant was pumped onto a 5 mm diameter chromatography column containing 1.0 ml CM sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which had been equilibrated in lysis buffer. A baseline level of UV absorbance for the eluent was reached after washing the column with 12 ml of lysis buffer followed by 7 ml of wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C, 1 mM dithiothreitol). Bound Aurora-B B protein was eluted from the column using a gradient of elution buffer (50 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C, 0.6 M NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, running from 0% elution buffer to 100% elution buffer over 15 minutes at a flowrate of 0.5 ml/min). Elution fractions (1.0 ml)<br><br>
corresponding to the peak in UV absorbance was collected. Elution fractions were dialysed exhaustively against dialysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C, 45% glycerol (v/v), 100 mM KC1, 0.05% (v/v) IGEPAL CA630 (Sigma Aldrich), 1 mM dithiothreitol). Dialysed fractions were assayed for Aurora-B kinase activity.<br>
Each new batch of Aurora-B enzyme was titrated in the assay by dilution with enzyme diluent (25 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5,12.5 mM KC1, 0.6 mM DTT). For a typical batch, stock enzyme is diluted 1 in 40 with enzyme diluent and 20|il of dilute enzyme is used for each assay well. Test compounds (at 10 mM in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) were diluted with water and lOjil of diluted compound was transferred to wells in the assay plates. 'Total" and "blank" control wells contained 2.5% DMSO instead of compound. Twenty microlitres of freshly diluted enzyme was added to all wells, apart from "blank" wells. Twenty microlitres of enzyme diluent was added to "blank" wells. Twenty microlitres of reaction mix (25 mM Tris-HCl, 78.4 mM KC1, 2.5 mM NaF, 0.6 mM dithiothreitol, 6.25 mM MnCl2, 37.5 mM ATP, 25 |iM peptide substrate [biotin-LRRWSLGLPvRWSLGLRRWSLGLRRWSLG]) containing 0.2u.Ci [733P]ATP (Arnersham Pharmacia, specific activity &gt;2500Ci/mrnol) was then added to all test wells to start the reaction. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. To stop the reaction lOOjxl 20% v/v orthophosphoric acid was added to all wells. The peptide substrate was captured on positively-charged nitrocellulose P30 filtermat (Whatman) using a 96-well plate harvester (TomTek) and then assayed for incorporation of 33P with a Beta plate counter. "Blank" (no enzyme) and "total" (no compound) control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50% inhibition of enzyme activity.<br>
In this test, the compounds of the invention give 50% inhibition of enzyme activity at concentrations of 0.3 nM to 1000 nM and in particular compound 5 in Table 1 gave 50% inhibition of enzyme activity at a concentration of 1.6 nM.<br>
(c) In Vitro cell proliferation assay<br>
This and other assays can be used to determine the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth of adherent mammalian cell lines, for example the human rumour cell line SW620 (ATCC CCL-227). This assay determines the ability of at test compound to inhibit the incorporation of the thymidine analogue, 5'-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) into cellular DNA. SW620 or other adherent cells were typically-seeded at IxlO5 cells per well in L-l 5 media (GIBCO) plus 5% foetal calf serum, 1% L-glutamine (100 pi / well) in 96 well tissue<br><br>
culture treated 96 well plates (Costar) and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day the cells were dosed with compound (diluted from 10 mM stock in DMSO using L-15 (with 5% PCS, 1% L-glutamine). Untreated control wells and wells containing a compound known to give 100% inhibition of BrdU incorporation were included on each plate. After 48 hours in the presence / absence of test compound the ability of the cells to incorporate BrdU over a 2 hour labelling period was determined using a Boehringer (Roche) Cell Proliferation BrdU ELISA kit (cat. No. 1 647 229) according to manufacturers directions. Briefly, 15 p.1 of BrdU labelling reagent (diluted 1:100 in media - L-15, 5% PCS, 1 % L-glutamine) was added to each well and the plate returned to a humidified (+5% €62) 37°C incubator for 2 hours. After 2 hours the labelling reagent was removed by decanting and tapping the plate on a paper towel. FixDenat solution (50 |J.l per well) was added and the plates .incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes with shaking. The FixDenat solution was removed by decanting and tapping the inverted plate on a paper towel. The plate was then washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 100 ul /well of Anti-BrdU-POD antibody solution (diluted 1:100 in antibody dilution buffer) added. The plate was then incubated at room temperature with shaking for 90 minutes. Unbound Anti-BrdU-POD antibody was removed by decanting and washing the plate 4 times with PBS before being blotted dry. TMB substrate solution was added (100 fil/well) and incubated for approximately 10 minutes at room temperature with shaking until a colour change was apparent. The optical density of the wells was then determined at 690 nm wavelength using a Titertek Multiscan plate reader. The values from compound treated, untreated and 100% inhibition controls were used to determine the dilution range of a test compound that gave 50% inhibition of BrdU incorporation. The compounds of the invention are active at 0.3 nM to 10000 nM in this test and in particular compound 5 in table 1 was active at 0.1 nM.<br>
(d) In Vitro cell cycle analysis assay<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to arrest cells in specific phases of the cell cycle. Many different mammalian cell lines could be used in this assay and SW620 cells are included here as an example. SW620 cells were seeded at 7 x 10s cells per T25 flask (Costar) in 5 ml L-15 (5% PCS, 1% L-glutamine). Flasks were then incubated overnight in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% C02. The following day, 5 (il of L-15 (5% PCS, 1% L-glutamine) carrying the appropriate concentration of test compound solubilised in DMSO was added to the flask . A no compound control treatments was also included (0.5% DMSO). The<br><br>
cells were then incubated for a defined time (24 hours) with compound. After this time the media was aspirated from the cells and they were washed with 5 ml of prewarmed (37°C) sterile PBS A, then detached from the flask by brief incubation with trypsin and followed by resuspension in 5 ml of 1 % Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) in sterile PBS A. The samples were then centrifuged at 2200 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated to leave 200 jil of the PBS/BSA solution. The pellet was resuspended in this 200 pi of solution by pipetting 10 times to create a single cell suspension. One ml of ice-cold 80% ethanol was slowly added to each cell suspension and the samples stored at -20°C overnight or until required for staining. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, ethanol aspirated off and pellets resuspended in 200 Jll PBS containing 100 |J,g/ml RNAse (Sigma Aldrich) and 10 |ig/ml Propidium Iodide (Sigma Aldrich). Cell suspensions were incubated at 37°C for SOmin, a further 200 fil PBS added and samples stored in the dark at 4°C overnight.<br>
Each sample was then syringed 10 times using 21-guage needle. The samples were then transferred to LPS tubes and DNA content per cell analysed by Fluorescence activated cell sorting (F ACS) using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Typically 30,000 events were counted and recorded using CellQuest vl.l software (Verity Software). Cell cycle distribution of the population was calculated using Modfit software (Verity Software) and expressed as percentage of cells with 2N (GO/G1), 2N-4N (S phase) and with 4N (G2/M) DNA content.<br>
The compounds of the invention are active in this test at 0.3nM to lOOOOnM.<br>
