Matrix coatings are coating system which uses a direct coating of both these above mentioned coating chemistry or by using two or multiple stations for coating and application of a film forming matrix so as to protect the packaged liquid and yet not allow the inner formed coating to become a non-soluble film in totality.<br><br>
Background<br>
Disposal of packaging, particularly of environmentally harmful packages, have been a nightmare for many countries. Many products have been put forward for solving this problem but usually are showing us the way towards landmass filling or partial bio degradation by compost method or oxidative method or by thermal method etc. This disposal of so-called bio degradeable packages takes a long time.<br>
There was a need to have a proper package, which can be disposed off properly and nearly instantly, using the existing infrastructure of sewage system. Preferably the remnants of the disposed package should be recyclable, is also the need of the day.<br>
