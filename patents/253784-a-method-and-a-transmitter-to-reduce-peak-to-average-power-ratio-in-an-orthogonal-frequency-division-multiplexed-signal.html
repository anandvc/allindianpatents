				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to signal processing for radio frequency signals, and<br>
more particularly to signal processing for reducing the peak to average power (PAR) ratio in<br>
orthogonal frequency division modulated (OFDM) radio frequency signals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION HD Radio™ digital broadcasting is a medium for providing digital-quality<br>
audio, superior to existing analog broadcasting formats. Both AM and FM HD Radio™<br>
signals can be transmitted in a hybrid format where the digitally modulated signal coexists<br>
with the currently broadcast analog AM or FM signal, or in an all-digital format without an<br>
analog signal. In-band-on-channel (IBOC) HD Radio™ systems require no new spectral<br>
allocations because each HD Radio™ signal is simultaneously transmitted within the same<br>
spectral mask of an existing AM or FM channel allocation. IBOC HD Radio™ promotes<br>
economy of spectrum while enabling broadcasters to supply digital quality audio to their<br>
present base of listeners. An HD Radio™ digital broadcasting system is described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,549,544, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
 One proposed FM HD Radio™ broadcasting system uses a set of orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) subcarriers to transmit a digital signal. OFDM<br>
modulation is a well-known technique that modulates a vector of information symbols in<br>
parallel over a number of individual orthogonally-spaced subcarriers. An OFDM signal<br>
includes multiple subcarriers modulated at different equally spaced frequencies, which are<br>
orthogonal to each other. OFDM modulation has proven to be an effective means for<br>
transmission over channels that experience various types of multipath and linear distortion.<br>
This ensures that different subcarriers do not interfere with each other under normal channel<br>
conditions.<br>
 In conventional serial modulation (not OFDM), a number (e.g. 100) of QPSK<br>
symbols (200 bits) is modulated in a sequence of 100 complex QPSK symbols over a total<br>
time interval T. In contrast OFDM groups these symbols as a vector and transmits the QPSK<br>
symbols in parallel as 100 subcarriers each modulating a single QPSK symbol. Each of the<br>
parallel OFDM subcarriers in this example occupies approximately one hundredth of the<br>
serial QPSK bandwidth and spans approximately the same time T. Both the bandwidth and<br>
throughput of the serial and OFDM transmissions are approximately the same. Small<br><br>
differences in the time and bandwidth are a result of channel filtering for mostly the serial<br>
transmission, and guard time (if any) in the OFDM case.<br>
 Unfiltered QPSK modulation results in a constant signal magnitude where<br>
only the phase is modulated. Therefore its Peak-To-Average Power Ratio (PAR) is one, and<br>
the power efficiency of the transmitter's high power amplifier (HPA) is high. More<br>
conventional filtered QPSK (i.e., square-root Nyquist filtering) results in a small amplitude<br>
modulation component of the modulated signal where its PAR is small (typically about 1 or 2<br>
dB), and the HPA efficiency is high, but not as high as unfiltered QPSK.<br>
 The magnitude of the transmitted signal in such a system with OFDM<br>
modulation occasionally has very high peaks. Therefore the linear power amplifiers used in<br>
these transmitters need to operate with large power back-offs so that the out-of-band emission<br>
power is below the imposed mask limits. This results in expensive and inefficient amplifiers.<br>
For a large number of subcarriers, each complex dimension (inphase and quadrature) of the<br>
OFDM signal approaches a Gaussian distribution. This results in a signal magnitude (square<br>
root of power) Probability Density Function (PDF) that approaches a Rayleigh distribution.<br>
 Although the Rayleigh distribution has theoretically infinite peaks, the OFDM<br>
peak is limited by the number of parallel subcarriers (e.g., 100, or 20 dB), or more practically<br>
the typical peak can be limited to about 12 dB since there is little distortion in clipping the<br>
improbable tails (e.g., above 12 dB PAR) of the Rayleigh PDF. HPA power efficiency is<br>
affected since a large power backoff is required in operation to minimize peak distortion.<br>
This peak distortion not only distorts (adds noise) the subcarrier modulation, but unwanted<br>
out-of-band emission occurs due to intermodulation distortion. This leakage, being highest<br>
immediately outside the intended spectral occupancy, can be particularly difficult to suppress<br>
with filters after the HPA output. Hence, there is a need to reduce the peak-to-average power<br>
ratio (PAR) for an OFDM signal.<br>
 Several different types of PAR reduction techniques have been proposed.<br>
Some types require additional coding or phase rotation of the subcarriers. However these<br>
PAR reduction techniques require reliable side information to undo the manipulations upon<br>
demodulation, and are less attractive. Another class of PAR reduction techniques relies on an<br>
iterative algorithm to clip and predistort (or constrain) the signal to achieve the PAR<br>
reduction and suppress out-of-band emissions, requiring no additional side information.<br>
These techniques are disclosed in A. Shastri &amp; B. Kroeger, "Method and Apparatus for<br>
Reducing Peak to Average Power Ratio in Digital Broadcasting Systems," U.S. Patent No.<br><br>
6,128,350, Oct. 3, 2000, and B. Krongold &amp; D. Jones, "PAR Reduction In OFDM Via Active<br>
Constellation Extension," IEEE Trans. Broadcasting, Vol. 49, No. 3, pp. 258-268, Sept. 2003.<br>
 This invention provides a method for reducing the PAR of electronic signals<br>
using OFDM, such as may be used in FM HD Radio™ systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 This invention provides a method of reducing peak-to-average power ratio in<br>
an OFDM signal comprising the steps of modulating a set of subcarriers with a set of data<br>
symbol vectors to produce a first modulated signal, limiting the magnitude of the first<br>
modulated signal to produce a first limited modulated signal, demodulating the first limited<br>
modulated signal to recover distorted input symbol vectors, constraining the distorted input<br>
symbol vectors to values greater than or equal to a minimum threshold value to produce<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of the<br>
frequency allocations and relative power spectral density of the signal components for a<br>
hybrid FM IBOC HD Radio™ signal 10. The hybrid format includes the conventional FM<br>
stereo analog signal 12 having a power spectral density represented by the triangular shape 14<br>
positioned in a central frequency band 16 portion of the channel. The Power Spectral Density<br>
(PSD) of a typical analog FM broadcast signal is roughly triangular with a slope of about<br>
-0.35 dB/kHz from the center frequency. A plurality of digitally modulated evenly spaced<br>
subcarriers are positioned on either side of the analog FM signal, in an upper sideband 18 and<br>
a lower sideband 20, and are transmitted concurrently with the analog FM signal. All of the<br>
carriers are transmitted at a power level that falls within the United States Federal<br>
Communications Commission channel mask 22. The vertical axis in FIG. 1 shows the peak<br>
power spectral density as opposed to a more conventional average power spectral density<br>
characterization.<br>
 In one proposed FM Hybrid HD Radio™ modulation format, a group of<br>
evenly spaced orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) subcarriers are placed on<br>
each side of the host analog FM signal occupying the spectrum from about 129 kHz through<br>
about 199 kHz away from the host FM center frequency as illustrated by the upper sideband<br>
and the lower sideband in FIG. 1. In this hybrid system the total digital signal power in the<br>
OFDM modulated subcarriers in each sideband is set to about -23 dBc (relative to its host<br>
analog FM power). The digital signal is transmitted on the OFDM subcarriers located on<br>
either side of the analog spectrum. The digital OFDM signal includes 191 subcarriers above<br>
and 191 subcarriers below the host FM spectrum. Each subcarrier is QPSK modulated at a<br>
symbol rate of 344.53125 Hz. The in-phase and quadrature phase pulse shapes are root<br>
raised cosine tapered (excess time=7/128) at the edges to suppress the spectral sidelobes.<br>
This pulse shape results in orthogonal subcarrier frequency spacing of 363.3728 Hz.<br>
 The digitally modulated portion of the hybrid signal is a subset of an all-digital<br>
DAB signal that will be transmitted in the all-digital IBOC DAB format. The spectral<br>
placement and relative signal power density levels of the OFDM digital subcarriers in a<br>
proposed all-digital FM DAB format illustrated by item number 24, is shown in FIG. 2. The<br>
analog FM signal of FIG. 1 has been replaced by an optional additional group of OFDM<br>
subcarriers, referred to as the extended all-digital signal 26, located in the central frequency<br>
band 28. Once again evenly spaced OFDM subcarriers are positioned in an upper sideband<br><br>
30 and a lower sideband 32. The sidebands of the all-digital format of FIG. 2 are wider than<br>
the sidebands of PIG. I. In addition, the power spectral density level of the all-digital IBOC<br>
signal sidebands is set about 10 dB higher than that allowed in the hybrid IBOC sidebands.<br>
This provides the all-digital IBOC signal with a significant performance advantage.<br>
Furthermore the power spectral density of the extended all-digital signal is about 15 dB<br>
below that of the hybrid IBOC sidebands. This minimizes or eliminates any interference<br>
problems for adjacent hybrid or all-digital IBOC signals while providing additional capacity<br>
for other digital services.<br>
 The all-digital mode of FIG. 2 is a logical extension of the hybrid mode where<br>
the analog signal, which previously occupied the central ±100 kHz region is replaced with<br>
low level digital subcarriers. Located on either side of the low-level carriers are two digital<br>
sidebands that differ from the hybrid mode by increasing the bandwidth to about 100 kHz and<br>
increasing the power by about 10 dB. A proposed all-digital system includes 267 carriers in<br>
each sideband and 559 carriers in the center. Each digital subcarrier is QPSK modulated.<br>
The in-phase and quadrature phase pulse shapes are root raised cosine tapered (excess<br>
time=7/128) at the edges to suppress the spectral sidelobes. This pulse shape results in<br>
orthogonal subcarrier frequency spacing of 363.3728 Hz. The power spectral density plots<br>
for the transmitted signal should be well within the all-digital FM IBOC mask.<br>
 FIGs. 1 and 2 show ideal spectrums of the FM HD Radio™ system hybrid and<br>
all-digital signals, along with their proposed spectral masks governing out-of-band emissions.<br>
Although the ideal signals are contained within their masks, nonlinear distortion, such as high<br>
power amplifier (HPA) compression or peak clipping, raise the out-of-band emissions and<br>
must be controlled for efficient HPA operation.<br>
 FIG. 3 is a simplified functional block diagram of a transmitter system<br>
including the PAR reduction algorithm inserted between the OFDM modulator and the HPA.<br>
The transmitter 40 includes a symbol generator 42 that produces OFDM symbol data vectors<br>
consisting of a group of Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) data symbols containing the<br>
information to be transmitted on each of the active subcarriers. These symbols are passed to<br>
modulator 44 wherein each OFDM symbol data vector is modulated to produce the digital<br>
me-domain signal samples (normalized). This modulation includes passing the data<br>
symbols through an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to realize the OFDM modulation.<br>
cyclic prefix, along with a root raised cosine window, is applied to the modulated signal<br>
excess time=7/128). The combination of the IFFT and the windowing operation is referred<br><br>
to henceforth as the OFDM modulator. The modulated output of OFDM modulator is passed<br>
as an input to the PAR reduction algorithm 46. The output 48 of this block is amplified by<br>
high power amplifier 50 and forms the signal to be transmitted with a reduced PAR at<br>
antenna 52.<br>
 A top-level flowchart of major PAR reduction algorithm steps is presented in<br>
FIG. 4. This flowchart starts at block 60 and shows the operations of inputting OFDM<br>
symbol data, through outputting modulated and PAR-reduced time domain signal samples for<br>
each OFDM symbol. The Input Symbol Data Vector block 62 shows that the input is a data<br>
vector comprising the bit pairs for each active QPSK subcarrier for the OFDM symbol. This<br>
can be viewed as the frequency-domain representation for each FFT bin (subcarrier) prior to<br>
OFDM modulation, where the FFT converts a complex time-domain signal block into<br>
complex frequency component bins uniformly spaced over the sample-rate bandwidth. Each<br>
active bin is represented by a complex binary number for QPSK modulation on that bin<br>
(subcarrier). Active bins with intentionally-reduced signal levels can be scaled to other<br>
binary sets of levels. Inactive bins are set to zero.<br>
 The Equalization Compensation block 64 shows an optional equalization<br>
compensation step. When linear distortion (filtering) is a significant factor at the<br>
transmitter's output network (HPA output), then equalization compensation can be used to<br>
precorrect the input to the HPA. The equalization compensation uses a vector (the same size<br>
as the input vector) containing the reciprocal of the complex output gain (linear distortion) for<br>
each subcarrier. The complex gain associated with each bin is a complex number which, in<br>
effect, multiplies (distorts) the original complex frequency sample (bin). Each of the<br>
elements of the input vector is multiplied by each of the corresponding element of the<br>
equalization vector to yield an equalized input symbol data vector.<br>
 The Modulate OFDM Symbol block 66 shows that the input symbol data<br>
vector is converted into a time domain signal for each OFDM symbol. This transformation is<br>
performed via an inverse complex fast Fourier transform (IFFT), then a cyclic prefix with a<br>
predetermined guard time is appended to the end of the output vector prior to tapering the<br>
ends of the symbol with a root-Nyquist pulse shape. This guard time, cyclic prefix extension,<br>
and windowing are used to improve the signal's performance in the presence of multipath<br>
interference, as well as suppress the frequency sidelobes of the subcarriers resulting in<br>
reduced out-of-band emissions.<br><br>
 The PAR reduction algorithm iterations block 68 represents the algorithms<br>
used in reducing the PAR of the modulated OFDM symbol. The details of these algorithms<br>
are described later and in the flowchart of FIG. 5.<br>
 The Output OFDM Symbol block 70 outputs the time domain samples of the<br>
PAR-reduced OFDM signal. Then the process continues for subsequent OFDM symbols.<br>
 A flowchart showing more details of the PAR reduction algorithm iterations<br>
block 68 of FIG. 4 is presented in FIG. 5. The input 72 to this flowchart is a sequence of<br>
modulated OFDM symbols, while the output 74 is the PAR-reduced version of these<br>
symbols. This iterative algorithm continues to reduce the PAR of the symbol while<br>
constraining the frequency domain (symbol vector) distortion and out-of-band emissions to<br>
acceptable levels. After some iterations, the algorithm converges to an acceptable<br>
compromise PAR while constraining the distortion to acceptable levels.<br>
 Block 76 represents an optional AM/PM compensation. This function can be<br>
used to partially compensate for the AM/PM distortion introduced by the HPA. AM/PM is<br>
generally characterized by a slight delay in the time domain signal peaks as the signal in the<br>
HPA approaches saturation. By modeling this effect within the PAR reduction iterative<br>
process, the AM/PM degradation can be reduced.<br>
 The Clip Signal Magnitudes block 78 represents a function that clips (limits)<br>
the magnitudes of the complex time domain OFDM symbol samples to a predetermined value<br>
(e.g. 1.5 times the rms level, or 3.52 dB PAR). The peak to average power reduction is<br>
accomplished by clipping or limiting the peak magnitudes. The phase of each sample is<br>
preserved. This clipping process introduces distortion and out-of-band emissions which are<br>
later corrected in the frequency domain processing within the iteration.<br>
 The Demodulate OFDM Signal block 80 illustrates the demodulation process<br>
that is the reverse of the modulate OFDM symbol process described previously. The<br>
demodulation steps include weighting and folding of the ends (where the cyclic prefix was<br>
appended in the previous modulation step) of the symbol time, then computing an FFT to<br>
yield a somewhat distorted version of the input symbol data vector.<br>
 The Remove Eq. (if Eq. Comp. active) block 82 shows that if the optional<br>
frequency-domain equalization compensation of FIG. 4 was performed, then this equalization<br>
must be temporarily removed for some of the next steps of the algorithm in this iteration.<br>
The vector used to remove the equalization is similar to the original equalization vector, but<br>
all the elements are reciprocals of the original equalization vector.<br><br>
 The Constrain QPSK Constellations &amp; Apply Mask block 84 shows the<br>
removal of significant distortion introduced by the previous signal clipping process. The<br>
intermodulation distortion caused by clipping introduces noise (distortion) into all the<br>
frequency bins of the symbol vector. This function constrains the distortion components to<br>
acceptable levels. This distortion cannot be entirely eliminated since this would have the<br>
undesirable effect of restoring the peaks back into the time domain signal. Instead the<br>
distortion is modified in such a way as to minimize the degradation in QPSK demodulation<br>
performance, and suppress out-of-band emissions to an acceptable level based upon a<br>
predefined out-of-band emissions mask vector. More details of this process are presented<br>
later. This process results in partial peak regrowth of the time domain signal. Multiple<br>
iterations of the PAR algorithm tend toward convergence to minimize the peaks while<br>
constraining the intermodulation products to acceptable levels.<br>
 The Restore Eq. (if Eq. Comp. active) block 86 shows that if the optional<br>
frequency-domain equalization compensation was performed in a previous step, then this<br>
equalization must be restored since it was removed in an intermediate step prior to this one.<br>
 The Modulate OFDM Symbol block 88 shows conversion of the input symbol<br>
data vector into a time-domain signal for each OFDM symbol. This step has been described<br>
in the identical block of FIG. 4.<br>
 The Last Iter? Block 90 shows that the iterative algorithm ends on the last<br>
iteration (a predetermined number of, for example, 4) for this PAR-reduced OFDM symbol.<br>
 The modulation and demodulation steps are illustrated by the following<br>
algorithm descriptions.<br><br><br><br>
 The clipping process acts upon the magnitudes of the complex OFDM symbol<br>
samples. For convenience, the nominal RMS value of the input complex OFDM time domain<br>
signal samples is scaled to one. An effective value of the clip magnitude level was<br>
experimentally determined to be about 1.5 (3.5 dB PAR). The units are in magnitude<br>
(voltage) of the complex time-domain samples previously normalized to an rms magnitude of<br>
1. The samples with magnitudes below 1.5 are unaffected. However, samples above 1.5<br>
magnitude are set to 1.5 while preserving the phase of the input sample. Detecting samples<br>
above the clip level can be performed using the magnitude squared samples to minimize<br>
computations of the square root. The following algorithm can be used as an example:<br><br>
Although both soft and hard limiting functions can be used for clipping, the hard limiting<br>
function illustrated in the plot of FIG. 6 has been shown to be simple and effective for this<br>
example. If the final PAR-reduced time domain signal applied to the HPA is still expected to<br>
experience some compression at these reduced peaks, then a soft clipping or compression<br>
modeling the HPA should be included in this clipping process. By inclusion of additional<br>
HPA compression, the PAR iterations will result in reducing the effects of this distortion.<br>
 Soft clipping is a more gradual limiting function than hard clipping. Some<br>
HP As tend to gradually compress the peaks as they approach high values as opposed to hard<br>
limiting where the signal is linear up to the limiting value. If the compression of the HPA<br>
can be accurately modeled, then this type of clipping may be more effective in some cases.<br><br>
 The results of the clipping process after eight iterations of the PAR reduction<br>
algorithm is shown in the plots of FIG. 7. Signal energies indicative of the PAR (instead of<br>
magnitudes) indicate a PAR of about 4 dB after the PAR reduction algorithm. The OFDM<br>
symbol consists of 2160 samples (after a cyclic prefix extension from 2048). The three plots<br>
include the unprocessed OFDM signal 100, the PAR-reduced signal 102, and the average<br>
signal power 104. The average signal power is equal to 1.<br>
 Significant distortion introduced by the signal clipping process is removed by<br>
constraining QPSK constellations and applying a mask. The intermodulation distortion,<br>
caused by clipping, introduces noise (distortion) into all the frequency bins of the symbol<br>
vector. This function constrains the distortion components to acceptable levels. This<br>
distortion cannot be entirely eliminated since this would have the undesirable effect of<br>
restoring the peaks back into the time domain signal. Instead the distortion is modified in<br>
such a way as to minimize the degradation in QPSK demodulation performance, and suppress<br>
out-of-band emissions to an acceptable level based upon a predefined out-of-band emissions<br>
mask vector. This process results in partial peak regrowth of the time domain signal.<br>
Multiple iterations tend toward convergence to minimize the peaks while constraining the<br>
intermodulation products to acceptable levels.<br>
 The QPSK constellations of the active subcarriers are constrained to minimize<br>
degradation in BER (Bit error rate) performance. In the absence of noise and distortion the<br>
ideal QPSK constellation consists of complex constellation points (normalized for<br>
convenience) at (+1.+1), (+1,-1), (-1,-1) and (-1,-1) depending upon the two bits each symbol<br>
conveys. QPSK can also be viewed as a pair of orthogonal BPSK signals, where each of the<br>
BPSK components carries one bit. The PAR reduction algorithm, in particular the clipping,<br>
adds noise to the constellation points. A bit error occurs when the additive noise changes the<br>
polarity of one of the bits; for example if a +1.0 is corrupted to -0.1 (the noise component is<br>
-1.1 in this case). The channel adds more noise to the received signal and the BER<br>
performance is a function of the margin of the transmitted signal. In other words, if an ideal<br>
transmitted signal component +1.0 is corrupted by the PAR algorithm to output +0.5, then the<br>
system loses 6 dB of margin for that particular bit. However other bits in the PAR reduction<br>
process can actually be enhanced since some of the distortion components will increase the<br>
+1.0 value (e.g. +1.2, or 3.5 dB improvement). Even with Forward Error Correction (FEC)<br>
improving the output BER at the receiver, the performance is degraded by the code bits that<br>
decrease the margin. Therefore the PAR reduction algorithm constrains the loss in margin to<br><br>
an acceptable level relative to 1.0 (e.g., 0.85). So when the previous clipping process distorts<br>
a bit component to a value of less than a predetermined threshold (e.g. +0.85, or -0.85 for<br>
negative polarity), then the vector is appropriately constrained to the threshold (+0.85, or -<br>
0.85 for negative polarity). The bits with a magnitude greater than 0.85 remain unchanged.<br>
This constraint has the effect of minimizing the worst case margin loss for any particular bit,<br>
while causing only modest peak signal regrowth in the time domain signal. The process of<br>
constraining the QPSK constellation points is illustrated in FIG. 8, where the threshold in this<br>
example is set to 0.85, and superimposing the points for several hundred QPSK symbols.<br>
Although some of the bits actually experience an increase in signal margin, the overall loss in<br>
BER performance is minimal.<br>
 The appropriate value for the threshold is a compromise between loss of BER<br>
margin and peak regrowth. For example, if the threshold is set to 0.95, then the BER margin<br>
loss is even less, but the peak regrowth is greater. Successive iterations of the clipping and<br>
constraint processes continue to reduce the PAR while it meets the constellation constraints<br>
as it converges to some minimum PAR value. An example of the QPSK constraint algorithm<br>
is:<br>
  i<br>
 In the algorithm above, dn is the appropriate complex element of the input<br>
OFDM symbol data vector where dn is the complex (possibly scaled) binary data for the<br>
corresponding QPSK symbol. The complex QPSKn value is the PAR-reduced version of that<br>
element after clipping and constraint iterations. Scaling of dn allows active subcarriers at<br>
different levels used in the all-digital option discussed later.<br>
 Some broadcasting systems may use reference subcarriers to aid in coherent<br>
signal tracking and to estimate channel state information (CSI) for subsequent FEC soft-<br>
decoding. It is desirable for these subcarriers to have no distortion from the PAR reduction<br>
algorithm. For these subcarriers the constraint could be to correct these QPSK constellations<br>
to exactly the original OFDM symbol data vector values. Since the number of reference<br>
subcarriers is typically small relative to the data bearing subcarriers, the regrowth of time<br>
domain peaks in the modulated signal is minimal.<br>
 The nonactive subcarriers are also constrained to suppress out-of-band<br>
emissions within an acceptable predetermined mask level. An out-of-band emission mask is<br><br>
a vector of the same size as the OFDM symbol vector, where the inactive subcarriers are<br>
associated with a maximum mask magnitude defined for each inactive subcarrier. The<br>
inactive subcarriers for each OFDM symbol vector are constrained to not exceed the mask<br>
magnitude (or magnitude squared for computational efficiency) value. Each subcarrier (FFT<br>
bin) is unaffected when its value is below the mask. When a bin exceeds this mask, the<br>
magnitude is constrained to the mask level while preserving the phase of the bin. The<br>
following algorithm achieves this mask constraint:<br><br>
 A spectral plot of the modulated signal after the PAR reduction algorithm is<br>
shown in FIG. 9. HD Radio™ systems can broadcast in various modes as discussed in the<br>
previously mentioned U.S. Patent No. 6,549,544. The signal in FIG. 9 represents an FM<br>
Hybrid mode (MP1) utilizing active subcarriers in the frequency range of approximately 129<br>
through 199 kHz on either side of the center FM frequency. There are 191 subcarriers on<br>
each sideband (382 total) where every 19th subcarrier is a reference subcarrier. The FM<br>
analog signal spectrum is omitted in this plot where only the digital portion 110 of the signal<br>
spectrum is shown. Notice that the noise outside the active subcarriers is constrained to be<br>
under the mask 112.<br>
 The PAR performance using the algorithms just described was simulated with<br>
the results presented in FIGs. 10 and 11. FIG. 10 is a graph showing simulated average PAR<br>
results for the PAR reduction algorithm for HD Radio™ FM Hybrid mode MP1 over a range<br>
of constraint values (limits between 0.825 and 0.9). FIG. 11 is a graph showing simulated<br>
peak PAR results for the PAR reduction algorithm for HD Radio™ FM Hybrid mode MP1<br>
over a range of constraint values (limits between 0.825 and 0.9).<br>
 The simulations span 64 OFDM symbols where the resulting PAR values were<br>
shown as average or peak over the 64 OFDM symbols in the two plots. The PAR reduction<br>
shows improvement as it tends to converge over eight iterations. A good value for the QPSK<br>
constraint (limit) seems to be about 0.85. In this case the average PAR achieved is less than 5<br>
dB within four iterations of the algorithm. This compares to an initial PAR of roughly 10 dB.<br><br>
An average PAR of less than 4 dB can be achieved with multiple iterations resulting in a<br>
potential average PAR reduction of greater than 6 dB for this example.<br>
For comparison, FIGs. 12, 13 and 14 show the PAR performance for HD<br>
Radio™ FM Hybrid Mode (MP3) where 267 subcarriers (534 total) are active on each<br>
sideband. The results here are similar to the MP1 mode, but the PAR reduction is slightly<br>
less due to proportionally more constraints in the increased number of subcarriers. In FIG.<br>
12, the digital portion is labeled 114, and the mask is labeled 116.<br>
Constraining QPSK constellations in an all-digital mode can now be<br>
described. The HD Radio™ all-digital FM mode (MP4) fills the entire ±200 kHz of<br>
bandwidth with active subcarriers with no FM analog signal present. The new secondary<br>
subcarriers within ±100 kHz are transmitted at a reduced level nominally 20 dB below the<br>
primary subcarriers beyond ±100 kHz. This is where a scaling of the secondary subcarriers<br>
(bins) of the OFDM data vector is used on the binary data. Although the same PAR<br>
reduction algorithm described previously could be applied, the relative distortion in mostly<br>
the outer secondary subcarriers is increased. This increase in relative distortion is due to the<br>
intermodulation products of the nearby primary subcarriers that are 20 dB higher in level. An<br>
additional constraint is placed upon these secondary subcarriers to further reduce this<br>
increased relative distortion.<br>
 Although it would be possible to prohibit any distortion in the secondary<br>
subcarriers by constraining them to the input OFDM symbol data vector, this is overly<br>
restrictive and would result in increased peak regrowth in the time domain signal. However<br>
the previously described constraint allows the distortion values to be relatively large even<br>
though the constraint for margin at the threshold value (e.g. 0.85) is imposed. This distortion<br>
results in significant increase in subcarrier power due to the distortion components greater<br>
than the nominal 1.0 values. A solution to this problem is to first constrain the constellation<br>
as previously described for the primary subcarriers. An additional constraint is imposed on<br>
the secondary subcarriers where the constrained new constellation value is an average of the<br>
newly constrained output and the input OFDM symbol data vector. This averaging reduces<br>
the large distortion values so that the resulting distortion is similar (proportional) to the<br>
primary subcarriers. A weighted average can further be used to adjust the degree of<br>
distortion reduction. Simulations have shown this to be effective. The results of the<br>
simulations are presented in FIGs. 15, 16 and 17. In FIG. 15, the digitally modulated signal<br><br>
is labeled 118, and the mask is labeled 120. An algorithm to constrain the QPSK<br>
constellation for the secondary subcarriers S is:<br><br>
 The PAR reduction performance for the all-digital mode is less than for the<br>
hybrid modes due to the additional constraint on the secondary subcarriers. However the<br>
average PAR of less than 6 dB after four iterations is still an improvement of over 4 dB<br>
compared to the original signal.<br>
 Optional Equalization Compensation can be used for HPA output filtering.<br>
Linear distortion at the transmitter output can result from limited HPA bandwidth and<br>
additional filtering at the output network due to antenna combining or for the reduction of<br>
out-of-band emissions. A linear equalizer could be placed before the HPA to compensate for<br>
these effects. However, in a transmission system using the PAR reduction algorithm, this<br>
compensation would result in peak regrowth of the signal. This peak regrowth occurs<br>
because the phases and amplitudes of the signal have been slightly modified in the PAR<br>
algorithm to, in effect, cancel at the peaks. The equalization applied outside the PAR<br>
algorithm would change the phase and amplitude relationships where the peaks would not<br>
cancel in the same way. Placing this equalization prior to the previously-described PAR<br>
algorithm is also ineffective since the PAR algorithm will undo the equalization. However a<br>
modification to the PAR algorithm to include equalization can be effective.<br>
 The equalization compensation uses a vector (the same size as the OFDM<br>
symbol input vector) containing the reciprocal of the complex output gain (linear distortion)<br>
values for each subcarrier (active or inactive). Each of the elements of the input vector is<br>
multiplied by each of the corresponding elements of the equalization vector to yield an<br>
equalized input OFDM symbol data vector. The OFDM modulation and demodulation steps<br>
in the above algorithm remain unchanged, although the resulting OFDM symbol time domain<br>
samples are somewhat different due to the equalization. The equalization within the PAR<br>
reduction algorithm is either removed or restored at several steps in the algorithm such that<br><br>
the QPSK constraints imposed on the OFDM symbol vectors does not undo the equalization.<br>
Examples of the Equalization Compensation and removal algorithms are:<br><br>
The effect is that the algorithm will continue to reduce the peaks with each<br>
iteration in the same manner as the PAR algorithm without equalization. However, the<br>
equalization is preserved through the PAR reduction process. Simulation results confirm that<br>
the PAR reduction performance with phase equalization is statistically identical to the<br>
performance without equalization. This is to be expected since distortions and peaks are<br>
iteratively corrected and converge in the same manner. However PAR reduction with severe<br>
amplitude equalization may be somewhat affected since this could change the effective power<br>
in the equalized output depending on the severity of subsequent filtering effects. For<br>
example, if a significant number of subcarriers are attenuated by 20 dB at the HPA output,<br>
the equalization would require proportionally more power to compensate for these<br>
subcarriers. The interaction of the intermodulation distortion over all the subcarriers of<br>
different equalized levels may have some effect on the potential PAR reduction.<br>
Furthermore, severe linear distortion can result in OFDM intercarrier interference as well as<br>
intersymbol interference which are not compensated in this algorithm. However,<br>
equalization for severely filtered HPA output signals should be used with caution.<br>
 In some applications the desired equalization may not be a predetermined<br>
fixed vector. Filtering and antenna/HPA output network impedance matching may change<br><br>
due to factors such as temperature, snow and aging. A feedback signal can be used to update<br>
the characteristics of the filtering which could adaptively update the equalization vector used<br>
in the PAR reduction algorithm. The feedback signal can be derived from a receiver<br>
(antenna) placed in a location near the exciter where it is unaffected by multipath distortion<br>
such that the receiver can measure the effects of filtering and linear distortion of the<br>
transmitted signal. This measured linear distortion can be converted into an equalization<br>
vector to be used in the PAR algorithm.<br>
 The AM/PM compensation function can be used to partially compensate for<br>
the AM/PM conversion introduced by the HPA. AM/PM is generally characterized by a<br>
slight delay in the time domain signal peaks as the signal in the HPA approaches saturation.<br>
By modeling this effect within the PAR reduction iterative process, the AM/PM degradation<br>
can be reduced. The AM/PM compensation is a bit more complex than the compensation<br>
(equalization) for linear distortion described previously. This is because the effects of<br>
AM/PM conversion are dependent on the instantaneous magnitudes of the OFDM symbol<br>
time domain samples. However the AM/PM can be introduced into the PAR reduction<br>
algorithm and be compensated in the iterative process of constraining the resulting<br>
constellations in the normal fashion. The AM/PM conversion is introduced immediately after<br>
the OFDM modulation steps in the algorithm. Unfortunately there are convergence issues to<br>
deal with in this case since the peaks are reduced in each iteration. Since the peaks are most<br>
affected by the AM/PM conversion, these effects will change with each iteration. There are<br>
two aspects of the algorithm to consider first, the modeling of the AM/PM conversion as it<br>
affects the time domain samples; and second, a method for improving the convergence of the<br>
compensation with changing peaks for each iteration.<br>
 The AM/PM conversion for a particular HPA should be accurately<br>
characterized to achieve a benefit in compensation. This characterization should be<br>
converted in units of time delay as a function of instantaneous magnitude. An example of<br>
this characteristic is shown in FIG. 18. For convenience the AM/PM conversion time units<br>
can be characterized in terms of samples of delay as a function of magnitude, and the<br>
maximum delay to be compensated is limited to one signal sample (2160 samples/OFDM<br>
symbol for the HD Radio™ FM system). The effect of this AM/PM conversion is to "smear"<br>
each complex OFDM symbol time domain sample into the next sample; the smearing being a<br>
function of the sample magnitude. An example of the AM/PM conversion is shown in FIG.<br><br>
18, and an example of an algorithm used to impose the AM/PM conversion onto the signal<br>
follows:<br><br>
 This algorithm acts as a nonlinear FIR filter whose coefficients are a dynamic<br>
function of the AM/PM conversion for each sample. However a more complex and accurate<br>
model can be generated if necessary to achieve the desired effect. The main issue with this<br>
simple algorithm is the changing peaks with each iteration of the algorithm, and its affect on<br>
convergence to an acceptable PAR reduction. To improve convergence, the algorithm is<br>
modified to gradually increase the effect of the AM/PM conversion with each iteration until<br>
the final iteration where the full effect is imposed. This can be achieved by multiplying the<br>
actual value of conversion by the present iteration number by the final iteration number.<br>
Simulation results reveal that this significantly improves convergence to achieve a lower<br>
PAR. An example of the modified AM/PM algorithm is shown next where an example<br>
AM/PM conversion proportional to the magnitude cubed of FIG. 18 is used.<br><br>
 In some applications the desired AM/PM conversion compensation may not be<br>
a predetermined fixed function. A feedback signal can be used to update the AM/PM<br>
function or a parameter in the function. Although simulation results showed reasonably good<br>
performance for this example, the actual characteristics may need further modification to<br>
yield good results with a particular HPA. It may be the case where the AM/PM conversion<br>
may not be sufficiently stable or accurately characterized to achieve good performance.<br>
Therefore, it should be tested for any particular HPA type.<br>
 This invention provides a method for reducing peak to average power ratio<br>
(PAR) in a radio frequency signal modulated with OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexed) symbols. The method comprises an iterative process including the steps of<br>
modulating a set of subcarriers with a set of data symbol vectors (OFDM modulation) to<br><br>
produce a modulated signal; limiting the magnitude of the first modulated signal to produce a<br>
first limited modulated signal; demodulating the first limited modulated signal to recover the<br>
distorted input symbols (constellation points); constraining the new input data symbol vectors<br>
in such a manner as to minimize the negative effects of the limiting to produce constrained<br>
data symbol vectors, and suppressing out-of-band leakage; and remodulating the constrained<br>
OFDM symbol data vector. This process is performed by subsequent iterations of the above<br>
algorithm to further reduce the PAR ratio. Although various methods have been proposed,<br>
this method offers improved performance for reducing the PAR while controlling undesirable<br>
out-of-band emissions. It also includes equalization within the PAR reduction algorithm to<br>
compensate for the effects of linear filter-like distortion caused by the HPA output network,<br>
as well as partial compensation for nonlinear signal compression and AM/PM conversion<br>
below the peaks of the PAR-reduced signal.	,<br>
 This invention can be applied to reduce the PAR of electronic signals using<br>
OFDM, such as may be used in FM HD Radio™ systems. This invention also provides a<br>
means for equalizing the signal within the PAR reduction algorithm to compensate for linear<br>
distortion cause by the HPA output network (filter). Further compensation techniques for<br>
nonlinear distortions, such as AM/PM conversion, are also discussed. Optimization in PAR<br>
reduction performance for iBiquity Digital Corporation's HD Radio™ system is discussed as<br>
an example and application of the technique.<br>
 The algorithms were simulated and showed good performance. Improved<br>
features include provision for an out-of-band spectral mask, improved performance for<br>
secondary subcarriers in an all-digital system with different subcarrier levels, an option for<br>
equalization of the HPA output network, and AM/PM conversion compensation.<br>
 This invention controls out-of-band spectral emissions through use of a<br>
spectral mask. In one embodiment, improved algorithm parameters yield better performance.<br>
Reference subcarrier constellations can be restored with negligible peak regrowth.<br>
Equalization of linear distortion can be introduced by HPA output network. Convergence<br>
criteria can be used to reduce the distortion in lower-level secondary subcarriers. The effects<br>
of AM/PM distortion can be suppressed. All of these improvements can be performed within<br>
the PAR correction iterations instead of after the PAR algorithm, which would have resulted<br>
in peak regrowth.<br>
 While the present invention has been described in terms of several<br>
embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes can be made<br><br>
