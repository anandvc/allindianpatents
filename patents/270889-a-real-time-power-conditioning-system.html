3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
the<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to solar photovoltaic efficiency synchronized generation interactive load control system.<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention concerns the method and system of grid connected solar photovoltaic energy distribution management system, whereof energy distribution is implemented on real time interaction between the maximum power generation availability of source and demand driven load optimization.<br>
Background:<br>
Advantage-In Prior art referred here in entirety, determination of distribution of energy to plural loads, during modulation period, the energy supplied from atleast one generator is of predetermined quantity of energy to any one of electrical loads effected by generator emitting during predetermined fraction of modulation period of electrical signal power corresponds to demand by electrical load. Thus the temporal distribution of electrical signal is precisely determined as function of temporal length and power of electrical signal in same modulation period effected by predetermined calculation processing in microprocessor with one or more memory units.<br>
Problem-Flexibility and effectiveness of distribution system is reduced as Energy supplied is of predetermined quantity thereby limiting the utility of the system within the predetermined range defined by the precursive parameters to be functioned in microprocessor interfaced with memory units.<br>
Advantage-Step of classification of electrical signal in priority order is in accordance with predetermined priority criterion; each classification step follows by step of distribution and step of     assessing if distribution is optimum by calculation of<br>
2 <br><br>
efficiency factor and distributed at best value of efficiency factor. Electrical signal of power whose temporal length equal to pre-selected range is selected.<br>
Problem-Predetermined priority criterion defeat the aim of the system to assess and supply the load demand on real time basis which is need of modern power systems. Optimization of distribution by supplying the energy at best efficiency factor does not guarantee power transfer at best power factor which needs to be near unity, for efficient power system.<br>
Advantage-There is further defined a reduction factor for average electrical power emitted by generator, said reduction factor then applied to each predetermined quantity of energy to be supplied to corresponding electrical load.<br>
Problem-As predetermined reduction factor applied does not account for the source generated power availability and maximum power that can be transfers at that instance, it hampers the application suitability of power system.<br>
Summary of Invention :<br>
Therefore it is preferable to use a system having flexibility to supply the energy based on interaction of source generation availability with the load demand at any instance effected by the real time voltage, current and maximum power output, solar photovoltaic source connected through charge controller to the battery unit, compared with real time voltage, current, power, power factor, frequency and efficiency of the output of the converter connected with utility grid. Thereby the priority criterion to be set is function of classification of connected load demand which can be supplied by the solar photovoltaic source at best efficiency and load power factor by recursively following the output voltage and current waveform over the modulation period and correcting the temporal length of electrical,signal to precisely match the zero crossing of the current and voltage waveform. The system improves the stability of system and markedly abates the ripples and harmonic<br>
3<br><br>
distortion factor. The problem of intermittency faced by the clean energy generation such as wind, solar can be addressed by battery backup hybrid system scheduled for grid synchronized supply of available source generated energy by optimizing the load demand over energy usage pattern.<br>
Disadvantage of system:<br>
Even at the best matching of generated supply to load demand, the distribution reliability of power system can not be achieved 100% due to uncertain availability of natural resource such as solar irradiation and instantaneous changes in load demand pattern. Also the higher cost of silicon modules used for solar photovoltaic generation and backup batteries doesn't make this system economically affordable with the conventional energy sources.<br>
In the prior art systems the back-up load is distributed through the switches where there is a delay and time lack the load power factor is fluctuating which needs to be stabilize for a better distribution system which hampers the efficiency as well as increases the maintenance cost and vene not suitable for modern day equipments.<br>
The inventor has program a logic in the micro controller to obviate the above drawbacks.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a solar photovoltaic power conditioning system comprising the input circuit and an output circuit said input circuit comprising two low power filter for current as well as voltage which converts into DC power which filtered in a high power filter to intrigrate in a intrigrator which connected to a comparator as one input and other input of comparator is connected to DC input as a reference said comparator comprising analogue circuit which convert voltage into current said current is pass through the micro controller which has a program logic for maximum power point tracking. The power module is directly connected to solar/battery source as well as source from micro controller.<br>
4<br><br>
The said  power is connected to power factor controller to stabilize the current and voltage and supplied to the load for further distribution.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to figures| 1 to 4 in the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure - 1 is block diagram of clean energy source with solar photovoltaic module Figure - 2 the block diagram for solar photovoltaic load control system Figure - 3   the graphic representations of current voltage module Figure - 4  is current power factor circuit diagram<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail may . be made to the above described embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as described in the accompanying specification.<br>
