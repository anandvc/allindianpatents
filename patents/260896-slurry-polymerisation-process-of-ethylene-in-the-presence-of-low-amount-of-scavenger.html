				<td>SLURRY POLYMERISATION PROCESS OF ETHYLENE IN THE<br>
PRESENCE OF LOW AMOUNT OF SCAVENGER<br>
The present invention concerns an ethylene polymerisation process using a<br>
metallocene-type catalyst.<br>
Olefin polymerisation processes are well known. Among the processes, slurry<br>
polymerisation in suspension in a solvent is extensively practiced. In such<br>
polymerisation process, monomer, diluent, catalyst, co-catalyst and optionally<br>
comonomer and hydrogen are fed to a reactor where the monomer is<br>
polymerised. A component acting as a scavenger of water, oxygen and other<br>
impurities, which may be present in the polymerisation medium, is usually<br>
added to the reactor. The diluent does not react but is typically used to control<br>
solids concentration. Such polymerisation process is typically performed in a<br>
stirred tank reactor, or in a loop reactor. One or more reactors can be used. In<br>
such process, solid polymer particles are grown on small catalyst particles. The<br>
released heat of polymerisation is eliminated through cooling of the reactor<br>
walls.<br>
When metallocene type catalyst is used in the polymerisation process, it has<br>
been found that on an industrial scale whereas the polymer particles are<br>
insoluble or substantially insoluble in the diluent, the polymer product has<br>
some tendency to deposit on the walls of the polymerisation reactor. This so-<br>
called "sheeting" leads to a decrease in the efficiency of heat exchange<br>
between the reactor bulk and the coolant around the reactor. This leads in<br>
some cases to an overheating of the reactor, which may cause the loss of the<br>
reactor control forcing the shutdown of the reactor for cleaning.<br><br>
Attempts to avoid build-up of polymer on the walls of the polymerisation reactor<br>
during slurry polymerisation have been made by adding an anti-fouling agent in<br>
the polymerisation medium. Typically, the anti-fouling agent acts for example<br>
to make the medium more conductive, thus preventing to some extent the<br>
formation of electrostatic charges, which is one of the causes of the build-up of<br>
polymer on the walls of the reactor.<br>
However, there have been some problems associated with such agents such<br>
as e.g. an increase of catalyst consumption due to a loss of activity in the<br>
presence of the anti-fouling agent, even at the low levels typically used in the<br>
polymerisation processes.<br>
EP 0 781 300 relates to a continuous process for the polymerisation of one or<br>
more olefins utilising a metallocene catalyst or catalyst system in a continuous<br>
slurry or gas phase polymerisation process. The invention is more particularly<br>
drawn to a gas phase polymerisation process for polymerising one or more<br>
olefins in the presence of a metallocene catalyst system in a fluidized bed<br>
reactor in the absence of or with a low amount of a scavenger. A batch slurry<br>
polymerisation is only exemplified in the presence of triethylaluminium used as<br>
scavenger. The document however fails to teach how to avoid the fouling in a<br>
slurry polymerisation process.<br>
US 2005/0153830 relates to olefin polymerisation catalyst compositions and<br>
methods for the polymerisation and copolymerisation of olefins, including<br>
polymerisation methods using a supported catalyst composition. This document<br>
also relates to a catalyst composition comprising the contact product of a first<br>
metallocene compound, a second metallocene compound, at least one<br>
chemically-treated solid oxide, and at least one organaluminium compound.<br><br>
US 5,891,814 discloses slurry or gas phase polymerisation process of<br>
propylene or ethylene with a catalyst system comprising two metallocenes. The<br>
catalyst system may be combined with one or more additives such as<br>
scavengers. Among scavengers, triethylaluminium, trimethylaluminium, tri-<br>
isobutylaluminium and tri-n-hexylaluminium are cited.<br>
US 2005/0070675 relates to polymerisation of ethylene and optional<br>
comonomers using a supported metallocene catalyst, an alumoxane activator<br>
and triisobutylaluminium.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for reducing the<br>
amount of sheeting which occurs in the reactor during the slurry polymerisation<br>
of ethylene utilising a metallocene type catalyst.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a polymerisation process<br>
of ethylene with a good productivity.<br>
At least one of the above objects is at least partially achieved by the invention.<br>
In the present invention, the sheeting of the reactor is evaluated by measuring<br>
the thermal conductibility of the reactor walls. When sheeting increases on the<br>
reactor walls, the thermal conductibility decreases.<br>
The present inventors have found a process for producing polyethylene that at<br>
least partly solve the problems encountered in the prior art, the process<br>
comprising polymerising ethylene alone or in combination with one or more<br>
alpha-olefinic comonomers in the presence of a supported metallocene<br><br>
catalyst, a polymerisation diluent, and a scavenger represented by the formula<br>
AIRX wherein each R is the same or different and is an alkyl group, said alkyl<br>
group having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, and x is 3, said scavenger being<br>
introduced in an amount of from 5 to 40 ppm by weight based on the total<br>
amount of the diluent and reactants present.<br>
In the present invention, reactants are ethylene, supported metallocene<br>
catalyst, scavenger, alpha-olefinic comonomers and hydrogen; and the diluent<br>
is an inert polymerisation diluent, such as e.g. isobutane.<br>
Preferably, the scavengers are alkyl aluminiums, more preferably trialkyl<br>
aluminiums such as but not limited to tri-n-propylaluminium, tri-<br>
isopropylaluminium, tri-n-butylaluminium, triisobutylaluminium, tri-n-<br>
pentylaluminium, tri-n-hexylaluminium, tri-n-octylaluminium. The most preferred<br>
trialkylaluminium scavenger is the triisobutylaluminium (TIBAL).<br>
Preferably, the scavenger is introduced in an amount of from 5, 10 or 15 ppm<br>
by weight up to 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 ppm by weight based on the total amount<br>
of diluent and reactants present.<br>
Alternatively, the amount of scavenger introduced may be expressed in grams<br>
per ton of the total diluent and reactants. According to this alternative, the<br>
scavenger is introduced in an amount of from 5 g/ton to 40 g/ton based on the<br>
total amount of diluent and reactants present.<br>
However expressed, this is most easily obtained in a continuous process by<br>
introducing 5 to 40 ppm (or g/ton) of scavenger in the diluent and reactants fed<br>
to the reactor.<br><br>
Preferably, the scavenger is introduced in an amount of from 5, 10 or 15 g/ton<br>
up to 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 g/ton based on the total amount of diluent and<br>
reactants present.<br>
Without being wishing to be bound by a theory, it is believed that the sheeting<br>
of the reactor may be explained as follows. At the exit of the reactor, the<br>
polymer slurry and the scavenger are taken from the reactor to a flash tank<br>
through a flash line that is heated with steam. This water in the flash line reacts<br>
with the scavenger for forming undesired reaction products leading to the<br>
formation of e.g. isobutylaluminoxane when TIBAL is used as scavenger.<br>
Isobutylaluminoxane is sufficiently soluble to serve as an effective reagent to<br>
remove the metallocene from its support leading to a homogeneous<br>
metallocene active site, which polymerises the ethylene anywhere in the<br>
reaction medium even on the reactor walls, thus leading to the sheeting of the<br>
reactor.<br>
It has been surprisingly found by the present inventors that by using the<br>
scavengers selected in the present invention in the amount described<br>
hereabove, sheeting of the reactor walls is significantly reduced or even<br>
essentially avoided while keeping the catalyst productivity and the resin<br>
properties similar to those obtained by an equivalent polymerisation process<br>
wherein usual amounts of scavenger comprised between 60 and 100 ppm by<br>
weight based on the total amount of diluent and reactants are used. This was<br>
not found to be obtainable by using other scavengers than those selected in<br>
the present invention.<br><br>
Another advantage of the process of the invention relies on the fact that even if<br>
the scavenger amount is significantly reduced, small variations of the<br>
scavenger concentration do not affect the properties of the final resin produced<br>
and the catalyst productivity.<br>
Our invention differs from the prior art EP 0 781 300 by a selection on slurry<br>
polymerisation process, which occurs in the presence of specific scavengers<br>
present in well defined quantity. This allows getting a good catalyst activity,<br>
which is not always observed when triethylaluminium is used. EP 0 781 300<br>
does not suggest to a skilled person that by selecting the scavenger as in the<br>
present invention, a similar or even better catalyst activity is obtained. Indeed,<br>
it has been observed that the present scavengers used with the metallocene<br>
catalyst described in the invention lead to a more stable catalyst activity than<br>
when triethylaluminium is used.<br>
In the present invention, the polyethylene is a homopolymer or a copolymer of<br>
ethylene with an alpha-olefinic comonomer selected from the group consisting<br>
of propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 4-methyl-1-pentene and mixtures<br>
thereof, the preferred comonomer being 1-hexene. The invention is preferably<br>
applied to the copolymerisation of ethylene.<br>
The metallocene catalyst used in the process of the invention has the general<br>
formula:<br><br>
wherein (C5R'K) is a cyclopentadienyl or substituted cyclopentadienyl,<br>
each R' being the same or different and is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical<br>
such as alkyl, alkenyl, aryl or arylalkyl radical containing from 1 to 20<br>
carbon atoms or two carbon atoms joined together to form a C4-C6 ring,<br>
R is a substituted or unsubstituted C1-C4 alkylidene radical, a dialkyl<br>
germanium or a dialkyl silicon or a di-aloxysilane, or an alkyl phosphine or<br>
amine radical bridging two (C5R'k)2 such as defined hereabove,<br>
Q is a hydrocarbyl radical such as aryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkylaryl, or aryl alkyl<br>
radical having from 1-20 carbon atoms, hydrocarboxy radical having 1-20<br>
carbon atoms or halogen and can be the same or different from each other,<br>
Z is the valence of the transition metal and<br>
M is a group IVb, Vb or Vlb transition metal,<br>
Preferably, (C5R'k) is a tetra hydrogenated indenyl group. More preferably,<br>
(C5R'k) is an unsubstituted tetra hydrogenated indenyl group.<br>
Preferably, M is a group IVb transition metal, more preferably M is zirconium.<br>
Preferably, Q is an alkyl having from 1-4 carbon atoms or an alkyl having 6<br>
carbon atoms or a halogen, more preferably Q is methyl or chlorine.<br>
Preferably, R is a substituted or unsubstituted C1-C4 alkylidene radical, more<br>
preferably ethylene or isopropylidene.<br>
Preferably, the invention is particularly applicable to a bridged bis (tetrahydro-<br>
indenyl) zirconium dichloride, more preferably an ethylene bis (tetrahydro-<br>
indenyl) zirconium dichloride.<br><br>
The metallocene catalyst can be activated and is supported according to any<br>
known method.<br>
The polymerisation of ethylene in the present invention occurs in slurry phase.<br>
Slurry processes generally include forming a suspension of solid particulate<br>
polymer in a liquid polymerisation diluent. The diluent employed should be inert<br>
as well as liquid under the conditions of polymerisation. Typical polymerisation<br>
diluents include hydrocarbons with 4 to 7 carbon atoms such as e.g. isobutane<br>
or hexane. Preferably, isobutane is used.<br>
The polymerisation may take place in a single stirred reactor or in a single loop<br>
reactor.<br>
Preferably, the polymerisation takes place in two stirred reactors or in two<br>
slurry loop reactors, which can be used in parallel or in series. Preferably, the<br>
reactors are loop reactors connected in series.<br>
The polymerisation may be performed in the range of from 60°C to 110°C,<br>
preferably from 70°C to 100°C and at a pressure of from 20 to 60 bars.<br>
The polymerisation may be performed in the presence of hydrogen.<br>
According to one embodiment, the invention is directed to a slurry phase<br>
process wherein ethylene, polymerisation diluent, supported metallocene<br>
catalyst, scavenger, optionally comonomers and optionally hydrogen are fed to<br>
one reactor.<br><br>
According to another embodiment, the invention is directed to a slurry phase<br>
process in two loop reactors connected in series wherein ethylene,<br>
polymerisation diluent, supported metallocene catalyst, scavenger, optionally<br>
comonomers and optionally hydrogen are fed to a first reactor, the amount of<br>
scavenger added to the first reactor being in the range such as disclosed here<br>
above and wherein additional ethylene, additional polymerisation diluent,<br>
additional scavenger, optionally additional comonomers, optionally additional<br>
supported metallocene catalyst and optionally additional hydrogen are fed to a<br>
second reactor, the amount of the additional scavenger introduced into the<br>
second reactor being in the range of from 5 to 40 ppm by weight based on the<br>
additional diluent and additional reactants introduced into the second reactor.<br>
Preferably, comonomer is added to the first reactor.<br>
Preferably, additional comonomer is added to the second reactor.<br>
Preferably, there is no additional supported metallocene catalyst introduced<br>
into the second reactor.<br>
Preferably, the additional amount of scavenger introduced into the second<br>
reactor ranges from 5, 10 or 15 ppm by weight up to 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 ppm<br>
by weight based on the additional diluent and additional reactants introduced<br>
into the second reactor. At any given time of the process, the amount of<br>
scavenger is between 5 to 40 ppm, based on the total amount of the diluent<br>
and reactants present. This is most easily obtained in a continuous process by<br>
introducing 5 to 40 ppm of scavenger in the diluent and reactants fed to each<br>
reactor.<br><br>
Preferably, the additional amount of scavenger introduced into the second<br>
reactor is equal to or lower than the amount of scavenger introduced to the first<br>
reactor. Preferably, the additional amount of scavenger introduced into the<br>
second reactor is from 40 to 70 percent of the amount of scavenger introduced<br>
into the first reactor.<br>
Still according to another embodiment, the diluent is recycled into the process.<br>
In this case, the scavenger is first neutralised with an aqueous solution before<br>
recycling the polymerisation diluent into the reactor. The aqueous solution is<br>
preferably water such as steam.<br>
For the neutralisation of the scavenger, a mole ratio of water to the scavenger<br>
of from 3, 10, 20 or 30 up to 50, 60, 100, 150 or 300 is used.<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly found that by controlling, in a industrial<br>
polymerisation process, on the one hand the amount of the scavenger<br>
introduced into the reactor and on the other hand the quantity of aqueous<br>
solution necessary to neutralise the scavenger before the polymerisation<br>
diluent is recycled into the process, a reduction of sheeting of the reactor walls<br>
is achieved.<br>
It is believed that controlling the amount of water used to neutralise the<br>
scavenger limits the unavoidable presence of small amounts of water, which<br>
typically is not completely separated in the recycle purification system and<br>
which is thus further recycled to the reactor wherein it may react with the<br>
scavenger forming undesired reaction products leading to the formation of e.g.<br>
isobutylaluminoxane when TIBAL is used as scavenger. Isobutylaluminoxane is<br>
sufficiently soluble to serve as an effective reagent to remove the metallocene<br><br>
from its support leading to a homogeneous metallocene active site, which<br>
polymerises the ethylene anywhere in the reaction medium even on the reactor<br>
walls, thus leading to the sheeting of the reactor.<br>
The invention further provides the use of a scavenger represented by the<br>
formula AIRX wherein each R is the same or different and is an alkyl group,<br>
said alkyl group having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms; and x is 3 in a slurry process<br>
for producing polyethylene, the process comprising polymerising ethylene<br>
alone or in combination with one or more alpha-olefinic comonomers in the<br>
presence of a supported metallocene catalyst, a polymerisation diluent and<br>
optionally hydrogen, said scavenger being present in an amount of from 5 to 40<br>
ppm by weight based on the total amount of diluent and reactants present.<br>
Example 1 and comparative example<br>
The polymerisations were carried out in a liquid-full slurry loop reactor in the<br>
presence of ethylene, hexene, hydogen, triisobutylaluminium, isobutane and<br>
metallocene catalyst. The metallocene catalyst was an activated and supported<br>
ethylene bis (4,5,6,7,tetrahydro-1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride.<br>
The comparative example differs from the example essentially by the TIBAL<br>
content. The polymerisation conditions are indicated in table 1.<br><br><br>
C2 = ethylene<br>
C6 = 1 -hexene<br>
i-C4 = isobutane<br>
TIBAL = triisobutylaluminium was added as a ten percent by weight solution in<br>
hexane. The solution was introduced at a rate of 0.6kg/h in the example and at<br>
a rate of 5.0kg/h in the comparative example.<br>
During the polymerisation, fouling occurred on the walls of the reactor in the<br>
comparative example. This was not the case in the example.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
A polymerisation was carried out in two liquid-full slurry loop reactors<br>
connected in series in the presence of ethylene, hexene, hydogen, tri-<br>
isobutylaluminium, isobutane and metallocene catalyst. The metallocene<br>
catalyst was an activated and supported ethylene bis (4,5,6,7,tetrahydro-1-<br>
indenyl) zirconium dichloride. Ethylene, hexane, hydrogen, isobutane,<br>
triisobutylaluminium and catalyst were introduced into reactor 1 in quantities<br>
such as mentioned in table 2. Additional ethylene, additional hexene, additional<br>
hydrogen, additional isobutane and additional triisobutylaluminium were added<br>
to reactor 2 in quantities such as mentioned in table 2. Additional catalyst was<br>
not introduced into reactor 2.<br><br><br>
