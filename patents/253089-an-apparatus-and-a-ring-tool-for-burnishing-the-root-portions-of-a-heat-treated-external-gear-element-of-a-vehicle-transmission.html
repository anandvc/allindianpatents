APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR STRENGTHENING GEAR TEETH<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to an improved apparatus and<br>
method for isolated burnishing or plastically deforming the root portions only of<br>
external automotive transmission gear elements to thereby increase gear tooth<br>
bending strength.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Gear sets or gear trains are common to mechanical and electro-<br>
mechanical systems requiring rotational motion and power transmission, and are<br>
therefore often utilized in systems ranging in complexity from a simple wrist watch<br>
or wind-up toy to advanced modern automotive transmissions. A gear set consists<br>
of two or more mechanical gear elements. Each gear element is engageable,<br>
meshable, or otherwise matable with at least one other gear element in the gear set<br>
for the purpose of transmitting power and motion between the various gear elements<br>
comprising the gear set. The specific gear element or series of elements chosen for<br>
any given application will largely depend upon the dynamics of the system into<br>
which the gear set is employed, as well as the respective forces or loads to which the<br>
individual gear elements that comprise the gear set are subjected.<br>
[0003]       Complex mechanical systems, for example automotive transmissions,<br>
commonly use a planetary gear set or sets comprised of any number of inter-meshed<br>
external gear elements such as sun gears or ring gears, and internal gear elements<br>
such as pinion gears, with the terms "external" and "internal" referring to the<br>
projecting direction of the gear teeth ringing the gear element. Each mating gear<br>
element within a planetary gear set of a transmission has a plurality of mating or<br>
meshing gear teeth, with each gear tooth typically having an involute surface profile.<br>
In an involute profile, contact between mating gear teeth is retained within a flat<br>
plane as the curved flanks of the gear teeth rotatably engage and disengage, thereby<br>
isolating all physical contact between the mating gear teeth to the active or contact<br><br>
GP-303246-PTT-DLT<br>
2<br>
surface portions of the gear flanks. Positioned between the mating gear teeth are<br>
non-contactable root portions each having a generally semi-circular profile. The<br>
semi-circular profiles of the root portions of involute gear teeth are, as part of the<br>
gear formation step, typically formed by milling or hobbing processes which cut or<br>
remove excess material from the metal gear blanks. While the involute design has<br>
many known inherent advantages, the rotational forces to which the involute gear<br>
elements are subjected are also known to place substantial tensile stress or bending<br>
force on the root portions of the gear tooth.<br>
[0004]       Therefore, it is advantageous to strengthen the gear element to prevent<br>
failure from the various stresses applied to thereto. Strengthening typically takes the<br>
form of hardening by way of initial heat-treating of the entire gear element. Heat-<br>
treated gear elements are then commonly subjected to additional finishing steps<br>
applied to shape the surface asperity profile of the gear flanks in order to increase<br>
the overall micro-level hardness of the gear element. Two of the more common<br>
finishing steps are abrasive grinding and shot peening. With abrasive grinding, a<br>
grinding tool is used to mechanically shave or grind the entire profile of the gear<br>
tooth, including the exposed gear root portions. Complete shaving of the entire<br>
gear tooth profile is often considered necessary in order to avoid "steps" or<br>
unevenness along the continuous gear tooth surfaces. Common abrasive grinding<br>
techniques include diamond grinding and, more commonly, cubic born nitride or<br>
CBN grinding. With shot peening, also known as metal bead blasting, metal shot<br>
or small spheres are blasted or shot into the exposed gear surfaces to plastically<br>
deform the impacted surface layers to thereby introduce compressive residual<br>
stresses and increase the micro-hardness of the surfaces. However, because all of<br>
the exposed surfaces of the gear element are equally affected by the bombardment<br>
of metal shot, the asperity profile of the exposed flanks of the gear tooth may be<br>
altered beyond that which is desirable, and, as a result, the gear elements might<br>
have to be subjected to additional finishing steps such as polishing and/or glass-<br>
bead blasting.<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	Accordingly, an improved gear tooth strengthening method is<br>
provided for increasing the operating life of a gear element having a plurality of<br>
projecting gear teeth. The method includes heat-treating the gear element as a<br>
preliminary step, and then plastically deforming the surfaces of the exposed gear<br>
roots to a predetermined depth without also thereby plastically-deforming the<br>
exposed active surfaces of the gear flanks. In so hardening only the gear roots, the<br>
compressive residual stress of the gear root is increased without changing the profile<br>
of the gear flanks, resulting in improved overall bending strength of the gear tooth.<br>
[0006]       In one aspect of the invention, the root hardness of an external gear<br>
element is increased using an improved ring tool having a plurality of hardened,<br>
inwardly-projecting burnishing teeth that are matable with the gear tooth roots of an<br>
external gear element and are operable to impart a predetermined level of plastic<br>
deformation to the root surfaces without thereby touching the exposed gear flanks of<br>
the gear element when the gear element is passed through the ring tool.<br>
[0007]       In another aspect of the invention, the improved ring tool is constructed<br>
at least partially of carbide and further has a plurality of broaching surfaces for<br>
qualifying the size of the gear element being formed, with the gear element being<br>
selected from the external gear element group consisting of sun gear and pinion<br>
gear.<br>
[0008]       The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of<br>
the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0013]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers<br>
correspond to like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is<br>
shown in Figure 1 a gear set 10, shown here as a representative planetary gear set,<br>
consisting of a first external gear element 12, a first internal gear element 13, and<br>
a plurality of second external gear elements 14. Although depicted in Figure 1 as a<br>
planetary gear set, gear set 10 may also take the form of, for example, a linear<br>
gear train or a more complex planetary gear set having a greater number of<br>
meshing gears. Meshing first and second external gear elements 12, 14 are shown<br>
in Figure 1 as a representative sun gear and pinion gear, respectively, which will<br>
be used hereinafter for the purpose of explaining the invention. However, the<br>
invention would be equally suitable for any pair of mating gear elements within a<br>
gear set or gear train.<br>
[0014]      As shown in Figures 1 and 2, first and second external gear elements<br>
12, 14 have a plurality of gear teeth 16a, 16b, respectively, extending radially<br>
outward from the gear elements 12, 14. Gear teeth 16a, 16b are equally spaced<br>
around the outer perimeter of gear elements 12, 14. Gear element 12 has a<br>
plurality of gear teeth 16a that are mutually meshable or engageable with the<br>
plurality of identical meshable gear teeth 16b of mating gear element 14. Once so<br>
mutually engaged, gear teeth 16a, 16b then cooperate to transmit rotational<br>
motion, as represented by the various arrows 18 in Figure 1. The profiles of gear<br>
teeth 16a, 16b are preferably the involute profile common to vehicle transmissions<br>
and other high-speed, high-stress systems. Such an involute profile is shown in<br>
greater detail in Figure 2.<br><br>
GP-303246-PTT-DLT<br>
6<br>
[0015]      The plurality of gear teeth 16a of gear element 12 each have a pair of<br>
opposing active surfaces or flanks 20a, the flanks 20a encompassing the entire<br>
expanse of contact surfaces between the mating gears. These contact surfaces are<br>
represented in Figure 2 approximately as the line or path AB. Likewise, identical<br>
gear teeth 16b each have a pair of flanks 20b opposable with the flanks 20a of gear<br>
teeth 16a, with the contact surfaces of flanks 20b described approximately by the<br>
line or path CD. Gear element 12 has a generally or substantially semi-circular<br>
root portion 22a having a plastically-deformable root surface 24a, shown as a<br>
dotted line, disposed between each of gear teeth 16a. Likewise, gear element 14<br>
has a preferably identical generally or substantially semi-circular root portion 22b<br>
having a plastically-deformable root surface 24b, shown as a dotted line, disposed<br>
between each of the gear teeth 16b.<br>
[0016]       As mating gear teeth 16a, 16b come into direct dynamic contact and<br>
engage, revolve, and subsequently disengage through one complete rotational cycle,<br>
mutual opposing force is brought to bear on the active surfaces or flanks 20a, 20b of<br>
mating gear elements 12, 14, respectively. Bending fatigue may therefore appear<br>
below or radially inward of the flanks 20a, 20b of the respective root portions 22a,<br>
22b due to the mutual opposing force or tensile stress exerted on the flanks 20a, 20b,<br>
as represented by arrows 21a, 21b of Figure 2. Material failure or crack propagation<br>
could result approximately along the direction of arrows 21a, 21b unless roots 22a,<br>
22b of gear elements 12,14 are strong enough to resist the tensile stresses. In<br>
accordance with the invention, therefore, the life of gear set 10 is increased by<br>
hardening the root portions 22a, 22b to create a plastically-deformed root surface<br>
24a, 24b to thereby increase the bending strength of gear teeth 16a, 16b,<br>
respectively, without also thereby contacting the flanks 20a, 20b, and/or altering the<br>
geometry of the flanks 20a, 20b.<br>
[0017]      Looking again to Figure 2, gear elements 12, 14, have substantially<br>
semi-circular root portions 22a, 22b, respectively, each having a plastically-<br>
deformable root surface 24a, 24b, as previously described herein. The root<br>
portions 22a, 22b are typically milled or hobbed out of a gear blank during the<br><br>
GP-303246-PTT-DLT<br>
7<br>
initial gear manufacturing process, with the kinematics of the gear nobbing process<br>
alone typically determining the final geometry of the root portions 22a, 22b. By<br>
contrast, in accordance with the invention, geometry of the root portions 22a, 22b<br>
are determined by broaching and burnishing which isolates hardening to the root<br>
portions 22a, 22b of gear elements 12, 14.<br>
[0018]      To isolate hardening to the root portions 22a, 22b, an improved<br>
forming tool or ring tool 30 is provided as shown in Figures 3 and 4. Ring tool 30<br>
preferably has a circular perimeter 28 and a plurality of radially-inwardly<br>
projecting burnishing teeth 32. Referring to Figure 4, each burnishing tooth 32 has<br>
an identical, generally semi-circular and substantially convex hardened forming<br>
surface 38 configured to plastically-deform the opposing root portions 22a, 22b<br>
(Figure 2) and to broach or cut any excess material from the surfaces of mating<br>
root portions 22a, 22b. Plastic deformation is provided generally by forming or<br>
coating the plurality of burnishing teeth 32 from or with material having a suitably<br>
elevated surface hardness relative to the surface hardness of the root portions 22a,<br>
22b of the gear element being formed. Broaching is provided generally by forming<br>
a cutting surface or broaching edge 36 (see Figure 4) along the entirety of the<br>
forming surface 38 of burnishing teeth 32.<br>
[0019]	More specifically, the broaching capability of the invention is<br>
provided by a projecting or protruding broaching edge 36 as shown in Figure 4,<br>
the broaching edge 36 spanning approximately the entire span of generally or<br>
substantially semicircular burnishing edge 38 and being configured to remove<br>
excess stock material from the gear element being formed. Preferably, the<br>
broaching edge 36 of each of burnishing teeth 32 is provided by way of a slightly<br>
concave face 44 ringed or surrounded by a suitably sharp cutting surface, as shown<br>
in Figure 4. Removal of excess material is accomplished as the broaching edge 36<br>
cuts, shaves, or broaches material in excess of the center diameter 42 of the ring<br>
tool 30 as the gear element being formed passes through the ring tool 30, as with<br>
representative gear element 12 in Figure 3. Broaching of excess gear element<br><br>
GP-303246-PTT-DLT<br>
8<br>
material, specifically excess material around the root portions 22a is necessary in<br>
order to prevent damage to the ring tool 30 and/or gear element 12, due to the<br>
presence of excessive material in and around the root portions 22a. Excessive<br>
material may be present in the root portions of the gear elements being formed<br>
such as 22a, 22b of gear elements 12, 14 due to the larger tolerances used in the<br>
formation of the root portions 22a, 22b during manufacturing of the gear blank<br>
(not shown), or the material may be left behind after the initial hobbing process<br>
used to form the root portions 22a, 22b. Also, heat applied during initial hardening<br>
heat treatment may expand and distort the gear blank after formation, increasing<br>
the geometry of the gear element until the geometry is no longer within tolerance.<br>
Because damage may occur to either or both the gear element and ring tool 30 as<br>
the larger than desirable gear element being formed is forced through the ring tool<br>
30, broaching surfaces 36 operable to cut or broach the excess material and<br>
thereby prevent such damage are provided in accordance with the invention.<br>
[0020]      Ring tool 30 also provides a burnishing capability and therefore is<br>
appropriately sized and shaped to impart to the gear element to be formed the<br>
desired depth of plastic deformation. In Figure 3, gear element 12 is used as an<br>
exemplary or representative gear, although one skilled in the art will recognize that<br>
gear element 14 or another external gear element may likewise be used as<br>
explained hereinafter. An external gear such as gear element 12 is passable under<br>
an external force appropriate for providing a predetermined level of plastic<br>
deformation to the root surfaces 24a of contacted root portions 22a. The<br>
plastically-deformed layers 24a of root portions 22a of gear teeth 16a, as well as<br>
the plastically-deformed layers 24b of root portions 22b of gear teeth 16b, are<br>
shown as dotted lines in Figure 2. As ring tool 30 performs as a forming tool,<br>
those skilled in the art of tool making would recognize various methods for holding<br>
ring tool 30 stationary with respect to the gear element being formed. For instance,<br>
ring tool 30 may be secured within a manual fixture or within a fixture-portion of a<br>
piece of capital equipment such as a press, while the gear element, such as gear<br><br>
GP-303246-PTT-DLT<br>
9<br>
element 12 of Figure 3, is moved through the ring tool 30 under a force suitable to<br>
impart the desired level of plastic deformation to the root surface 24a.<br>
[0021]      Variables that will affect the final depth of the plastically-deformable<br>
root surfaces 24a, 24b and the geometry of root portions 22a, 22b include both the<br>
relative hardness and the geometrical variance and/or tolerance between the mating<br>
ring tool 30 and the gear element being formed. Ideally, the gear element being<br>
formed is heat-treated prior to burnishing to prevent the loss of the residual stress<br>
benefits of burnishing due to martensitic transformation. Likewise, the amount of<br>
force used to move the gear element through the ring tool 30 is a function of the<br>
desired predetermined level of broaching and/or burnishing, and may be<br>
manipulated to produce the desired surface hardness on the root surface such as<br>
24a of gear element 12. As stated earlier herewithin, to ensure proper hardening of<br>
the root surfaces such as 24a, the ring tool 30, and in particular the plurality of<br>
burnishing teeth 32, are formed of a material having sufficiently greater surface<br>
hardness than that of the gear element being hardened, so as to adequately<br>
plastically deform the root surface 24a, 24b as a result of mutual, forceful contact<br>
between the ring tool 30 and the gear element.<br>
[0022]      Preferably, at least the forming surface 38 portion of burnishing tooth<br>
32 is constructed using carbide or a suitable high-speed tool steel having Rockwell<br>
C hardness (RC) of at least approximately 5-10 Rc greater than that of the gear<br>
element being formed. As representative external gear elements 12, 14 are<br>
preferably constructed of 5120 steel or other suitable material having a hardness of<br>
approximately 55-65 RC, the preferred hardness of the mating burnishing teeth 32<br>
is approximately 60-75 RC, although harder burnishing teeth may also be provided<br>
using specialized 75 RC or harder grades of carbide. Non-forming surface 40 of<br>
burnishing tooth 32, describing the expanse of gear tooth surface not including<br>
forming surface 38 and represented approximately by the line traced along the<br>
curve of the burnishing tooth 32 between points E and F in Figure 4, does not<br>
make contact with any surface of the gear element being formed during the<br><br>
GP-303246-PTT-DLT<br>
10<br>
broaching or burnishing process. Therefore, hardening of non-forming surfaces 40<br>
is not essential, although equal hardening of all material surfaces of ring tool 30 is<br>
desirable in order to ensure the overall structural integrity of the ring tool 30.<br>
[0023]      The size of ring tool 30 and the number, shape, and size of burnishing<br>
teeth 32 are dependent on the design of the gear element to be formed. That is, as<br>
ring tool 30 is a tool or mold through which a formed and heat-treated gear<br>
element such as 12 is passed, the geometry of ring tool 30 is configured to match<br>
the geometry of the gear element 12 to be hardened. For example, as shown in<br>
Figure 3, if gear element 12 were to have twenty separate gear teeth 16a, a ring<br>
tool 30 having twenty separate opposing burnishing teeth 32 would be required,<br>
with ring tool 30 being appropriately sized to allow a pre-selected mating gear<br>
element 12 to pass through ring tool 30 under the required force necessary to<br>
affect the desired changes to the root portion 22a.<br>
[0024]      As previously discussed herewithin, mating rotating gear elements such<br>
as gear elements 12, 14 create mutual tensile stress which may then manifest itself<br>
as bending fatigue radiating outward from root portions 22a, 22b, respectively.<br>
Each of gear elements 12, 14 possesses a predetermined material strength. If the<br>
tensile stress imparted to the gear tooth 16a, 16b exceeds such material strength,<br>
one or both of the gear elements 12, 14 will fail in the form of crack initiation,<br>
which may then propragate with the continued application of tensile stress. By<br>
adding compressive residual stress to the root portions 22a, 22b of representative<br>
gear elements 12, 14, the strength of material of the gear elements is thereby<br>
increased, with the object of increasing the strength of material to a level above<br>
that of the tensile stress imparted on the mating gear elements 12, 14. The use of<br>
ring tool 30 as herein described produces the required compressive residual stress<br>
in the form of plastic deformation of the root surfaces such as 24a of a gear<br>
element such as sun gear 12 after the gear element 12 has passed through the<br>
improved ring tool 30.<br><br>
GP-303246-PTT-DLT<br>
11<br>
[0025]      Those skilled in the art will recognize that excessive plastic deformation<br>
may damage the gear element, while insufficient plastic deformation will not<br>
produce compressive residual stress levels sufficient to elevate the strength of<br>
material of the gear element enough to prevent damage from bending fatigue. To<br>
strike the desired balance, the preferred depth of plastic deformation of plastically-<br>
deformable root surfaces 24a, 24b in accordance with the invention is<br>
approximately 2 to 5 micrometers (µ). To impart such a level of deformation, the<br>
profile of gear elements 12, 14 after qualifying broaching are approximately 2 to<br>
5µ larger than the profile of the ring tool 30. In this manner, passing the softer gear<br>
element through the harder ring tool 30 will result in the desired 2 to 5µ deformation<br>
of the root portions 22a, 22b.<br>
[0026]       While the invention has been described previously herewithin in relation<br>
to an external gear element, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention<br>
is equally applicable to internal gear elements such as ring gear 13 of Figure 1 by<br>
reversing the orientation of burnishing teeth 32 of ring tool 30, that is, by so<br>
configuring outwardly-projecting burnishing teeth 32 to burnish only the root<br>
portions of the teeth of the ring gear 13.<br>
[0027]       While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize<br>
various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the<br>
scope of the appended claims.<br><br>

external gear element of a vehicle transmission, the ring tool comprising a generally<br>
circular main ring having a plurality of hardened burnishing teeth projecting radially<br>
inwardly therefrom, wherein said burnishing teeth are operable to impart a<br>
plastically-deformed layer to said root portions when said gear element is passed<br>
through said ring-tool.<br>
15.	The ring tool of claim 14, wherein said main ring and/or said<br>
burnishing teeth are at least partially comprised of carbide.<br>
16.	The ring tool of claim 14, wherein said plurality of gear teeth<br>
each have an involute profile, and wherein said plurality of gear tooth roots each<br>
have a generally semi-circular profile.<br>
17.	The ring tool of claim 14, wherein said external gear element<br>
is selected from the group consisting of sun gear and pinion gear.<br>
18.	The ring tool of claim 14, wherein said plastically-deformed<br>
layer is approximately 2 to 5 micrometers.<br>
19.	The ring tool of claim 14, wherein the surface hardness of<br>
said burnishing teeth is approximately 5 to 10 RC greater than that of said root<br>
portions.<br><br>
An apparatus and method for increasing the operating life of a<br>
rotating gear element including a plurality of outwardly-projecting gear teeth each<br>
having an involute profile, with each gear tooth having a pair of flanks and a pair of<br>
generally semi-circular root portions. A ring tool having a plurality of hardened,<br>
inwardly-projecting burnishing teeth is employed to plastically deform only the root<br>
portions of the gear element being formed, while avoiding contact with the flanks as<br>
the gear element is passed through the ring tool. The ring tool also includes a<br>
plurality of broaching surfaces or cutting edges for removing excess stock material<br>
from the surfaces of the root portions. The ring tool increases the compressive<br>
residual stresses in the root portion of the gear element being formed, thereby<br>
creating an optimal residual stress profile and greater bending strength within the<br>
root portion of the gear element.</td>
