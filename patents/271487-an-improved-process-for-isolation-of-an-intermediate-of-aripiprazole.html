3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
An improved process for synthesis and isolation of Aripiprazole.<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention mainly relates to an improved and commercially viable process for synthesis of Aripiprazole, 7-[4-[4-(2, 3-dichlorophenyl)-l-piperazinyl] butoxy]-3, 4-dihydro-2 (IH)-quinolinone having good yield and purity. Furthermore relates to the simple isolation for Aripiprazole over the existing prior art.<br>
Background of Invention:<br>
Aripiprazole, 7-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-l-piperazinyl] butoxy]-3,4-dihydro-2 (1H)-quinolinone is used for treating schizophrenia and its preparation is firstly described in European Patent EP 367, 141 (1990) and use of Aripiprazole as anti-psychotic agent is mentioned in J.Med.Chem. Vol.41, PP.658-667 (1998).<br>
The process for preparation of Aripiprazole (I) referred as title compound as described in<br>
the European Patent EP 367, 141 (1990) is reproduced in scheme-I:<br>
Scheme-I:<br><br>
The above said process involves reaction of 7-hydroxy-3, 4-dihydro-2 (lH)-quinolinone (II) with 1, 4-dibromobutane (III) in water using potassium carbonate as base at reflux temperature. The product was isolated by extraction of reaction mixture with methylene chloride. The isolated product was purified by column chromatography and was recrystallized from hexane and ethanol. 7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2 (1H)-quinolinone (IV) thus obtained was condensed with l-(2, 3-dichlorophenyl) piperazine hydrochloride (V) in acetonitrile using sodium iodide as catalyst and triethylamine as base to obtain crude aripiprazole. The crude aripiprazole was further crystallized from ethanol twice to obtain pure aripiprazole pure.<br>
The drawback in the above process is the yield and the purity of the first stage product obtained from condensation of 7-hydroxy-3, 4-dihydro-2- (lH)-quinolinone with 1, 4-dibromobutane. The crude product obtained from the reaction is very impure and hence purified by column chromatography followed   by crystallization from hexane and ethanol.<br>
According to our preferred embodiment, the methodology was developed for the purification of intermediate 7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2 (lH)-quinolinone (IV) such that the tedious and cumbersome operation on large-scale separation by column chromatography was eliminated which has been well depicted in example. Further the modification in isolation process of crude aripiprazole offered a distinct advantage in obtaining better purity of final product.<br>
According to WO 2006/038220, the key intermediate used in the preparation of aripiprazole, 7-hydroxy-3, 4-dihydro-2- (lH)-quinolinone (II) is prepared from 3-hydroxy aniline (VI) and 3-chloropropionyl chloride (VII)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In this preparation method for compound II, besides the required product, the other unwanted isomer of the formula (VIII) is also forms, which in turn reacts similarly to that of 7-hydroxy-3, 4-dihydro-2- (lH)-quinolinone. The impurity emanating from this compound continues to be present in the final drug aripiprazole. The purification process employed for removal of this impurity result in lowering of overall yield of aripiprazole.<br>
In our embodiment, the aripiprazole prepared from the intermediate 7-hydroxy-3, 4-dihydro-2- (lH)-quinolinone (II) (which is depicted in following example) shows the percentage of undesired analogue emanating from formula(VIII) well within usual pharmaceutical limits of 0.05%.<br>
Objective of Invention:<br>
The main object of present invention is to provide an industrially applicable and commercially feasible process for the preparation of Aripiprazole. Furthermore, another object of present invention is to provide aripiprazole with desired purity and yield. Another object of present invention is to provide simple method of isolation for aripiprazole over the existing prior art.<br><br>
Summary of Invention:<br>
The present invention mainly concern with industrially feasible and cost effective concomitant with green chemistry process for preparation of aripiprazole. The invented process has added advantage of the improved purity of Aripiprazole.<br>
This method further provides substantial benefits relative to previously used or suggested production methods. For example, the starting materials, intermediates, liquid media, and catalysts used are relatively easy to handle and to dispose off, if necessary. Importantly, the present method provides high yields of the desired product or products so that substantial process efficiencies are achieved.<br>
The present invention carried out in two steps which has been briefly summarize below<br>
and elaborately in forgoing example.<br>
Step-1<br>
Preparation of 7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(lH)-quinolinone.<br>
7- hydroxy -3,4-dihydro -2(lH)-quinolinone was reacted with 1,4- dibromobutane in<br>
presence of potassium carbonate and water at 80 °C to obtain crude 7-(4-bromobutoxy )-<br>
3,4-dihydro-2(lH) quinolinone which was purified by treatment of silica gel charcoal<br>
mixture in methylene dichloride to obtained pure 7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3,4-dihydro -2(1 H)-<br>
quinolinone<br>
Step-2<br>
Preparation of Aripiprazole.<br>
The purified 7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(lH)-quinolinone was reacted with sodium<br>
iodide in acetonitrile followed  by reaction with   l-(2, 3-dichlorophenyl) piperazine<br>
hydrochloride in presence of triethylamine at reflux temperature. The isolated crude<br><br>
aripirazole was purified &amp; recrystallised from ethanol to obtain a pure title compound (Aripiprazole).<br>
Detail description of Invention:<br>
According to present invention, the preparation of aripiprazole involves two steps, which<br>
has been depicted as follows.<br>
Step I:<br>
In   step   I,   the   7-hydroxy-3,   4-dihydro-2(lH)   quinolinone   is   reacted   with   1,   4-<br>
dibromobutane in water at 75-85°C using potassium carbonate as base. After completion<br>
of reaction, the crude 7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(lH) quinolinone is isolated after<br>
addition of hexane.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The isolated crude 7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(lH) quinolinone (IV) was dissolved<br>
in methylene chloride and was cooled to 0-5°C. The solution obtained was stirred with<br>
charcoal and silica at 0-5°C for 45 min. and filtered. The charcoal-silica bed was washed<br>
with cold methylene chloride. The procedure of charcoal - silica was repeated two times<br>
on the methylene chloride solution. The HPLC purity of 7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-<br>
2(1H) quinolinone obtained after isolation from methylene chloride was found to be &gt;<br>
99%. The details of the isolation process are given in example.<br><br>
Step II:<br>
In step II, 7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(lH) quinolinone (IV) is reacted with sodium iodide in acetonitrile followed by l-(2, 3-dichlorophenyl piperazine) hydrochloride (V) in presence of triethylamine.<br><br>
SCHEME IV	ARIPIPRAZOLE<br>
The reaction was carried out by heating at reflux temperature for 4 hrs. After completion of reaction, it was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The isolated solids were again re-suspended in acetonitrile and triethyl amine and were heated to reflux temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and solids were isolated by filtration. The isolated solids were suspended in methylene chloride and water mixture. The mixture was basified using liquor ammonia. The organic layer was separated and evaporated to obtain the solid residue, which was crystallized twice from ethanol to obtain pure aripiprazole. The modifications in isolation procedure offered an advantage in improving the purity of aripiprazole.<br>
The aripiprazole isolated from this improved process has the HPLC purity more than 99.9%.<br>

moles) of l-(2, 3-dichlorophenyl) piperazine hydrochloride and 43.75 ml (0.314 moles) of triethylamine was added and further refluxed for 4 hrs. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and stirred for 2 hrs. The solids were filtered and washed with cold (10°C) acetonitrile (30 ml). (Wet weight - 109 - 111 gms).<br>
The solid product was taken in 328 ml of acetonitrile and 21.9 ml of triethylamine. The reaction mass was refluxed for 30 min., cooled to room temperature and stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The solids were filtered and washed with cold acetonitrile (54 ml). The solids were dried in oven at 60°C. (Yield: 88 gms).<br>
The solid product (88 gms) was taken in water (440 ml). The pH was adjusted to 8-9 with liquor ammonia. The reaction mass was stirred at 50-55°C for 30 min. The reaction mass was extracted with methylene chloride (10 parts) at 35-38°C. The organic phase was washed with water (2 x 100 ml), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to obtain crude Aripiprazole. The crude aripiprazole thus obtained was recrystallized from ethanol twice to yield 67.0 gms of pure aripiprazole having HPLC purity &gt; 99.9%.<br><br>
