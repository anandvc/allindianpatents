				<td>This invention relates to a novel process and in particular to a process for preparing<br>
certain substituted thiazolidinedione derivatives and to certain intermediates to the<br>
substituted thiazolidinedione derivatives 	<br>
Eurspean	Patent Application,	-Number  discloses certain<br>
thiazolidinedione derivatives of formula (A):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a tautomeric form thereof or a pharmaceutical acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, wherein: Aa represents a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic heterocyclyl group; Ra represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an acyl group, an aralkyl group, wherein the aryl moiety may be substituted or unsubstituted, or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group;<br>
RD and Rc each represent hydrogen or Rb and Rc together represent a bond;<br>
Ab represents a benzene ring having in total up to five substituents; and<br>
n' represents an integer in the range of from 2 to 6.<br>
EP   0306228	also discloses a process for reducing the compounds of formula<br>
(A) wherein RD and Rc together represent a bond (the 'benzylidene thiazolidine-2, 4-diones') to the corresponding compounds of formula (A) wherein R" and Rc each represent hydrogen (the_'benzylthia7olidine-2. 4-diones'). The particular reduction methods disclosed inEP 03Â® 62.28-are catalytic hydrogenation methods and dissolving metal reduction methods.<br>
Selective reduction of the exocyclic double bond in the benzylidene thiazolidine-2, 4-dione moiety by complex hydride reducing agents is not considered to provide the basis for a viable commercial process due to a general expectation that the required selectivity would not be achieved, with particular reference to the aluminium hydrides, and/or that the reaction would give poor yields. We have now surprisingly discovered that a benzylidene thiazolidine-2,4-dione group is selectively<br>
reduced to the corresponding benzyl thiazolidine-2,4-dione, by use of a complex hydride reducing agent in a high yielding and commercially viable process.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention discloses a process for preparation of a substituted thiazolidinedione derivative of formula I having structural formula I :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a tautomeric form thereof or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, wherein J is selected from O or S; T is selected from a group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group and T1 is selected from O or S; and said process comprises, reduction of a compound of formula II having structural formula II :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a tautomeric form thereof or salt thereof or solvate thereof, wherein T, J and T1 are as defined, in relation to compound of formula I with a complex hydride reducing agent or its source, such as herein described, at a temperature varying from ambient to elevated temperature to result in a compound of formula I, as described above, which, thereafter, is converted in a conventional manner to its tautomeric form or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a tautomeric form thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, wherein:<br>
J represents O or S;<br>
T represents a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group and T"l is O or S;<br>
which process comprises, reducing a compound of formula (II):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a tautomeric form thereof or a salt thereof or a solvate thereof, wherein T and T1 are as defined in relation to formula (I), with a complex hydride reducing agent or a source of a complex hydride reducing agent; and thereafter, as required, preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate of the compound of formula (I) or a tautomeric form thereof.<br>
Suitable complex hydride reducing agents include borohydride reducing agents and aluminium hydride reducing agents.<br>
Suitable borohydride reducing agents include diborane and metal borohydrides.<br>
A suitable metal borohydride is an alkali metal borohydride, such as a lithium, sodium or potassium borohydride, especially lithium or potassium.<br>
Borohydrides include unsubstituted and substituted borohydrides.<br>
Suitable substituted borohydrides include borohydrides with up to three substituents on boron selected from such as alkyl and phenyl groups.<br>
Suitable alkyl groups are C1-6alkyl groups, such as ethyl and, especially, butyl groups.<br>
Particular butyl groups are sec and ten butyl groups.<br>
Particular borohydride reducing agents are those which comprise the trihydroborane, triethylborane, tributylborane or triphenylborane moiety.<br>
Favoured borohydride reducing agents include lithium tri-sec-butyl borohydride, potassium tri-sec-butyl borohydride/lithium chloride, sodium tri-sec-butyl borohydride, potassium triphenylborohydride, lithium triethylborohydride, lithium borohydride and sodium borohydride.<br>
One preferred borohydride reducing agent is lithium borohydride.<br>
One preferred borohydride reducing agent is lithium tri-sec-butyl borohydride.<br>
When an unsubstituted metal borohydride is used as the reducing agent, it is preferred if the reduction is carried out in the presence of a base such as pyridine a substituted pyridine, quinoline, a substituted quinoline, a secondary or tertiary amine, such as piperidine or triethylamine, or a phosphine such as triphenylphosphine.<br>
Conveniently, the said base is used as a solvent or co-solvent for the reaction.<br>
A preferred base is pyridine.<br>
A suitable aluminium hydride reducing agent is lithium aluminium hydride.<br>
The reaction conditions for the reduction reaction are the appropriate conditions dictated by the nature of the complex hydride reducing agent chosen:<br>
In one aspect, when the reagent is a borohydride reducing reagent suitable solvents include alkanols, such as methanol and ethanol, tetrahydrofuran and pyridine or mixtures thereof.<br>
When the reducing reagent is an alkali metal borohydride a preferred solvent is pyridine/tetrahydrofuran.<br>
When the reducing reagent is an alkali metal trialkyl or triphenyl borohydride, a preferred solvent is tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The borohydride reduction is carried out at a temperature which provides a suitable rate of formation of the required product, usually at ambient or an elevated temperature, suitably at an elevated temperature, preferably above 50Â°C, for example 65Â°C and conveniently at the reflux temperature of the required solvent. Usually the reactants are mixed at ambient temperature and the reaction mixture is heated at the refiux temperature of the solvent.<br>
In a further aspect, when the reagent is an aluminium hydride reducing reagent, suitable solvents include aprotic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The aluminium hydride reduction is carried out at a temperature which provides a suitable rate of formation of the required product, usually at low to ambient temperature, for example a temperature in the range of from -10 to 10Â°C, suitably in the range of from -5 to 0Â°C.<br>
It is considered that the reduction of the compounds of formula (II), wherein T1 is S, especially when the reducing agent is a borohydride reducing agent, proceeds via an intermediate of formula (III):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
tautomeric form thereof, or salt thereof, or a solvate thereof, wherein J and T are as defined in relation to formula (I).<br>
The intermediate of formula (III) is obtained in better yield when the reduction is carried out at low temperature. Thus, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of the above defined formula (III), which process comprises, reducing a compound of the above defined formula (II) with a metal hydride reducing agent, preferably a borohydride reducing agent, preferably wherein the reaction is carried at low temperature, suitably below ambient temperature, for example between 0Â° and 5Â°C; and thereafter, as required, preparing a salt or a solvate of the compound of formula (III).<br>
A preferred reducing agent for preparing a compound of formula (III) is lithium or potassium tri-sec-butylborohydride (also known as "L-selectride" or "K-selectride"), preferably lithium tri-sec-butylborohydride.<br>

Suitable general reaction conditions for the borohydride and aluminium hydride reductions are also as described in "Reductions by the Alumino- and Borohydrides in Organic Synthesis" by J. Seyden-Penne (VCH Publishers, Inc. / Lavoisier - Tec &amp; Doc, published 1991) and the references disclosed therein.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) (or (III)) are isolated from the reaction and subsequently purified by use of conventional isolation and purification methods such as chromatography and crystallization/recrystalliazation.<br>
The complex hydride reducing agents of the process are usually commercially available or they can be prepared using conventional procedures, for example the borohydride and aluminium hydride reagents can be prepared using methods such as those described in "Reductions by the Alumino- and Borohydrides in Organic Synthesis" (ibid) and particularly in the references cited therein.<br>
Certain of the borohydride reducing agents are conveniently prepared in situ. For example, lithium tri-sec-butyl borohydride is conveniently prepared from tri-5<?c-butyl borane and lithium aluminium hydride.<br/>
Also, lithium borohydride is conveniently prepared from sodium borohydride and a lithium salt according to known procedures such as those disclosed in Inorg. Chem. 1981, 20, 4454; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953, 75, 209; Nature 1954, 173, 125 and J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955, 77, 6209.<br>

(a) Using lithium tri-sec-butyl borohydrjde,<br>
A 1M solution of lithium tri-sec-butyl borohydride in tetrahydrofuran (220 ml, 0.22 moles) was added to a suspension of IIB (35.5 g, 0.1 moles) in tetrahydrofuran (310 ml) at 25Â°C over 30 minutes. The resulting mixture was heated and held at reflux temperature for two and a half hours, and then cooled to 5Â°C. An aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (10% w/v, 100 ml, 0.25 moles) was added, followed by 27% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (50 ml, 0.4 moles). The resultant solution was stirred at 25Â°C for three hours, diluted with water (100 ml), and then concentrated via vacuum distillation until a residual volume of 300 ml was achieved. Hydrochloric acid (2.5 M, approx. 200 ml) was added to the rapidly stirred mixture at 20 to 25Â° C and the resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with water, and dried at 50 dec C in<br>
vacuo, to give (IA) (34.4 g). The crude product was recrystallised from 99% IMS (20 ml per g of crude (IA) giving a 79% overall yield.<br>
(b) Using lithium borohydride,<br>
A solution of lithium borohydride (67.5gy 3.1 mole) in tetrahydrofuran (1.54L) was added via cannular to a stirred suspension of (IIB) (500g, 1.4mol) in tetrahydrofuran (950ml) and pyridine (1.13L) at room temperature under nitrogen over 1.5 hours. The mixture was heated to reflux, stirred for 3 hours and cooled to room temperature. The stirred reaction mixture was quenched into hydrochloric acid (670ml) and water (4.4L) at 8Â°C over 0.67 hours using tetrahydrofuran (250ml) to wash out residual material. The quench mixture was stirred at 26Â°C for 0.25 hours, heated to reflux and stirred for 0.75 hours. The hot mixture was allowed to stand for 0.17 hours, filtered through celite, the residue was pulled to dryness and washed with water (500ml). The aqueous washings were added to the filtrate and stirred at room temperature for 14 hours. The precipitated product was collected by filtration under vacuo, pulled to dryness, washed with water (2.8 L) and pulled dry. The damp solid was washed with industrial methylated spirit (2 x 500ml), and dried at 45Â°C for 72 hours to give (IA) (386.5g, 77%).<br>
c)	Using sodium borohydride and lithium chloride, (in-situ preparation of lithium<br>
horohvdride&gt;<br>
A solution of sodium borohydride (0.24g, 6.34mmole) in pyridine (5ml) was stirred at 25Â°C under nitrogen for 0.25 hours then heated to 65Â°C under reflux. A solution of lithium chloride (0.40g, 9.44mmole) in pyridine (5ml) was added dropwise via cannular to the stirred mixture at 65Â°C which was then held at this temperature for 2 hours, diluted with tetrahydrofuran (20ml) and heated at reflux for a further 0.5 hours. The mixture was cooled to 30Â°C, (IIB) (1.0g, 2.82mmole) was added in portions and the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 4 hours. A solution of hydrochloric acid (1ml) and water (10ml) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture at 5Â°C . The mixture was concentrated in vacuo, pyridine (4ml) and water (6ml) were added and the mixture was stirred at 5Â°C with the pH being adjusted to 6 using hydrochloric acid. Water (10ml) was added and the mixture was stirred for 15 hours. The suspension was filtered, the residue was washed with water (10ml), pulled dry and dried at 50Â°C for 24h to give (IA), (0.88g, 88%).<br>
Example 2: Preparation of 5- {4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy]benzyl} -2r4-thiazolidinedione (IA) via reduction of 5-{4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy]benzylidene}2,4-thiazolidinedione (IIB), using lithium aluminium hydride.<br>
To a suspension of lithium aluminium hydride (1.13 g, 1 mole equivalent) in tetrahydrofuran (200 ml) at 0Â°C was added (IIB) (10 g, 1 mole equivalent) in portions over 15 minutes. The temperature was kept below 5Â°C during the addition. The mixture was stirred at 0Â°C for 30 minutes, and then at 10Â°C until the reaction was judged to be complete by HPLC (1.75 hours). The solution yield of (LA) was 69%.<br>
Example 3: Preparation of 5-{4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy]benzyl}-5-{l-[2,4-dioxothiazolidin-5-yl]-l-[4-(2-(N-methyl-N-(2-<br>
pyridyl)amino)ethoxy)phenyI]methyl}'2,4-thiazolidinedione (IIIA) from 5-{4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy]benzylidene}2,4-thiazolidinedione(IIB).<br>
To a solution of compound (IIB) (3.56 g) in tetrahydrofuran (THF, 120 ml) at -5 to 0Â°C was added a 1M solution of lithium tri-sec-butylborohydride (L-selectride) in THF (22 ml). The resulting mixture was stirred for 40 minutes, and then cooled to -10Â°C to stop the reaction. Sodium hydroxide solution (10% w/w, 40 ml) was carefully added, followed by aqueous hydrogen peroxide (27% w/w, 10 ml) to ensure destruction of the borohydride reagent. THF was removed in vacuo, and the aqueous mixture was neutralised to pH 7 using 2M hydrochloric acid. The resulting solid was filtered and discarded, and the filtrate was cooled to 4Â°C. After standing overnight a second crop of solid was obtained and this was purified twice by flash column chromatography using dichloromethane/methanol as eluent. Compound (IIIQwas isolated as white crystals (109 mg, 3% isolated yield).<br>
Example 4. Preparation of 5-{4-[2-(5-ethyl-2-pyridyl)ethoxy]benzyl}-2,4-thiazolidine-2,4-dione (ID) via reduction of 5-{4-[2-(5-ethyl-2-pyridyl)ethoxy]benzilidene}-2,4-thiazolidine-2,4-dione (IID).<br>
A 2.0 M solution of lithium borohydride in tetrahydrofuran (31 ml, 62.0 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred suspension of 5-{4-[2-(5-ethyl-2-pyridyl)ethoxy]benzilidene}-2,4-thiazoiidiae-2,4-dioiie (10.0 g, 28.22 mmoi) in ieirahydrofuran (19 mi) and pyridine (23 mi) at 30Â°C under nitrogen. The resulting mixture was heated under reflux for 4 h (reaction monitored by HPLC) and then cooled to ambient temperature and added dropwise to an efficiently stirred solution of cone, hydrochloric acid (13.5 ml) in water (88.7 ml) between<br>
10Â°C and 20Â°C. The resulting orange suspension was heated to reflux temperature and held for 30 minutes and then cooled to ambient temperature. The resulting suspension was stirred for 30 minutes and the product was collected by filtration and washed with water (20 ml x 3).   The crude product was heated to reflux in acetic acid (50 ml) and charcoal was added (1.5 g) to the resulting solution, which was then diluted with ethanol (50 ml), filtered through celite, and the celite bed washed through with hot ethanol (50 ml). The filtrate and washings were combined and allowed to cool to 5Â°C resulting in crystallisation of a white solid which was isolated by filtration to give compound (ID) (5.29 g, 53%). A second crop of material was obtained by partial concentration of the mother liquor (0.81 g, 8.1%).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
