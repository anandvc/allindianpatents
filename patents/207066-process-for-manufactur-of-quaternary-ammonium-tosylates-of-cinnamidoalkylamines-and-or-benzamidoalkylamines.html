Process for manufacture of quaternary ammonium tosylates of cinnamidoalkylamines and / or benzamidoalkylamines<br>
APPLICANT<br>
Galaxy Surfactants Ltd.,<br>
C-49/2, TTC Industrial Area, Pawne, Navi-Mumbai 400 703, Maharashtra, India.<br>
A Public Limited Company Registered under Indian Company's Act - 1956<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
ORIGIANL<br><br><br>
 21-8-2003<br><br>
GRANTED<br><br>
8-1-2004<br><br>
Field of Invention :<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for manufacture of cationic, quaternary ammonium tosylate salts of cinnamidoalkylamines and / or benzamidoalkylamines. This invention particularly relates to the synthesis of tailor made non-hydrolyzable, non-irritating compounds having substantivity to cotton, wool, skin and hair and UV-radiation absorbing properties useful in personal care and fabric care formulations.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
US patent 5,427,773 (1995) discloses preparation of cationic substantive photofilters like dodecyl dimethyl amino benzamido propyl dimethyl ammonium tosylate. In this process, a primary amino group of iV.iV-dimethyl propyl diamine is reacted with dimethyl amino benzoic acid to form an amidoamine and then the tertiary amino group of the amidoamine is quatemised with alkyl tosylate. Similarly, US Patent 6,613,340 (2003) discloses cationic tosylate salts from cinnamidoalkylamines following the same methodology. The procedures described in both patents are very tedious where alkyl tosylates used for quaternisation are prepared from fatty alcohols and tosyl chloride. This reaction is done in a suitable solvent using stoichiometric quantities of tertiary amine bases like triethylamine or pyridine. The organic bases mop up the hydrochloric acid generated and the subsequent hydrochloride-base salt that is formed as a by¬product has to be removed by washing the reaction mixture with water. This significantly increases the effluent load. Another disadvantage of this process is that the reaction of preparation of alkyl tosylate is carried out in halogenated solvents like dichloromethane or aromatic solvents. Purification of alkyl tosylate also results in significant loss of yield and simultaneous increase in effluent treatment. This is mainly due to the presence of unconverted fatty alcohols. The quaternisation of cinnamidoalkylamines and / or benzamidoalkylamines with alkyl tosylate does not give quantitative conversion and hence the after purification step the isolated yields of quatemised UV-absorbers range between 65 to 70 %.<br>
In summary, all these factors make the process for making quatemised UV-absorbers not only tedious and expensive but also non-environment friendly. Hence, there is a need for a simple, quantitative and eco-friendly process for making these substantive UV-absorbers.<br>
Object of the invention :<br>
The main object of the present invention is to make the process of synthesizing the tosylate quaternary salts of cinnamidoalkylamines and / or benzamidoalkylamines simple, quantitative and eco-friendly.<br><br><br>
Summary of the invention :<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing quaternary ammonium tosylates of cinnamidoalkylamines and / or benzamidoalkylamines of Formula I,<br>
Formula I<br><br>
wherein;<br>
ArCO is selected fromp-Af,Af-dimethylamino benzoyl and / or p-methoxy cinnamoyl;<br>
Ri is selected from H or alkyl groups containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
R2 and R3 are independently selected from alkyl groups containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms;<br>
R4is selected from alkyl or alkenyl groups containing from 8 to 22 carbons;<br>
n is an integer having values from 1 to 6;<br>
comprising steps of<br>
(i) quatemisation of 1.0 mole of cinnamidoalkylamine and / or benzamidoalkylamine of Formula II with 1.0 mole of alkylating compound of Formula HI, wherein, R\, R2, R3, R4 and n is same as that in the compound of said Formula I, with or without solvent, to obtain a quaternary ammonium halide of Formula IV;<br><br><br>
(ii) treating the aqueous solution of quaternary ammonium halide of Formula IV obtained in step (i) with stoichiometric quantity of sodium p-toluene sulphonate to get water insoluble quaternary ammonium tosylate of Formula I;<br>
Formula IV<br><br>
and the products made by the process.<br>
Detailed description of the invention :<br>
The process of making compounds of Formula I described in the present invention comprises of two steps, a) synthesis of quaternary ammonium halides of Formula IV and b) conversion of water soluble quaternary compounds of Formula IV to water-insoluble quaternary ammonium tosylates.<br>
In the process described in the present invention, the cinnamidoalkylamines and / or benzamidoalkylamines of Formula HI are synthesised as per the literature procedures [US patent 5,427,773 (1995), US Patent 6,613,340 (2003)]. These UV-absorbing amidoamines are quaternised using commercially available alkyl halides of Formula III in aqueous / alcoholic medium to give quantitative generation of corresponding water-soluble, UV-absorbing, quaternary ammonium halides of Formula IV. The reaction can be carried out in water, alcohols or mixtures thereof.<br>
The quaternisation reaction can be conveniently done in a pressure reactor as well as in an open system. The temperatures suitable for pressure reaction range from about 100 - 135°C with the pressures up to 50 psi. The pressures are governed by the amount of solvent and the temperature selected for the reaction. The conditions of reaction in an open vessel also get dictated by the choice of solvent. The progress of the reaction is monitored by measuring the amount of unreacted alkylating agent by chromatography or by estimation of unquaternized amidoamine or by estimation of X", the halide anion.<br>
Alternately, quaternisations can be carried out by directly reacting cinnamidoalkylamines and / or benzamidoalkylamines of Formula II with alkyl halides of Formula HI at from about 100 to 140°C for 4 to 24 hours without any solvent and in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen. The progress of the reaction is monitored by estimation of unquaternised tertiary amine as well as by the estimation of liberated halide.<br>
In another embodiment, the process of the present invention relates to manufacture of quaternary ammonium tosylates of Formula I, in which ArCO is selected from p-JV.iV-dimethylamino<br><br>
benzoyl and / or p-methoxy cinnamoyl; R1 is selected from H or alkyl groups containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R2 and R3 are independently selected from alkyl groups containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms; R4 is selected from alkyl or alkenyl groups containing from 8 to 22 carbons; n is an integer having values from 1 to 6; from the compounds of Formula II, m, IV and sodium p-toluene sulphonate, with respective substituents ArCO, R1, R2, R3, and n of Formula n, R4 of Fonnula HI and ArCO, R1 R2, R3, R4, and n of Formula IV as defined for the compounds of Formula I in this embodiment.<br>

A process for preparing quaternary ammonium tosylates of cinnamidoalkylamines and / or benzamidoalkylamines of general Formula I from cinnamidoalkylamines and / or benzamidoalkylamines, fatty alkyl halides and sodium p-toluene sulphonate, substantially as herein described, in the text and in the examples.<br><br><br>
Advantages of the process :<br>
The quatemised UV-absorbers of the present invention containing cinnamidoalkylamine and / or benzamidoalkylamine moieties absorb very strongly in UV-B region. They are very substantive to skin, hair and fabric and due to the long alkyl chain they provide softening / conditioning effect.<br>
The processes described for above molecules in US Patent 5,427,773 (1995) and US Patent 6,613,340 (2003) are multi-step, low yielding and non eco-friendly. They involve use of p-toluene sulphonyl chloride as well as halogenated solvents. Since the synthetic routes described in these patents go via sulphonyl chloride, it necessitates use of an organic base. Thus, use of solvents, generation of by-products like salt of organic base-hydrochloride and the necessary purification steps that result in not only lower yield of isolated product but heavy load on effluent treatment. This can be easily eliminated by the new process described in the present invention. The process of the present invention is a simple one with quantitative conversions and does not generate effluents and hence environment friendly. This is achieved through designing this novel process that avoids solvents including halogenated ones, reagents like p-toluene sulphonyl chloride and organic bases.<br><br><br>
