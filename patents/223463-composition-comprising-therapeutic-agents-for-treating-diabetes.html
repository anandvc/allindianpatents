SPECIFICATION Therapeutic Agents for Diabetes<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to new agents for preventing/treating diabetes, more concretely pharmaceutical compositions comprising a combination of a compound represented by the following formula (I) with a specified medicament(s), and particularly drugs for preventing or treating diabetes.<br>
Diabetes is metabolic disorders caused by an absolute or a relative shortage of insulin that is only hypoglycemic hormone, and has a main feature of continuous hyperglycemia. The continuity of hyperglycemic status not only makes the metabolic disorders caused by a shortage of insulin worse but also causes microangiopathy in a kidney, nerves, retinas, and the like; and macroangiopathy such as arteriosclerosis. As a result, such a status seriously spoils a healthy life. Therefore, the object of controlling diabetes is to prevent the occurrence of the chronic complication and slow the progression thereof by improving the hyperglycemic status.<br>
Hypoglycemic agents such as insulin preparations, insulin secretagogues, insulin sensitizers and or-glucosidase inhibitors have been widely applied as the method for the clinical treatment. Each of these hypoglycemic agents has many problems though the availability of such agents has been confirmed. For example, in the case of the diabetic patients whose pancreatic insulin secretion ability seriously lowers, effectiveness of insulin secretagogues and insulin sensitizers is diminished. Similarly, in the case of the diabetic patients whose insulin resistance is significantly high, effectiveness of insulin preparations and insulin secretagogues is diminished.<br>
It  is   thought  to   be   useful   that   agents   having   different   action<br><br>
mechanisms are combined to use in order to complement the above disadvantages of the hypoglycemic agents. However, the use of the combination of the existing hypoglycemic agents has a limitation in improving the hyperglycemic status in point of corresponding to various pathology of diabetes.<br>
As one of the main actions of insulin relating to the hypoglycemic actions, insulin has the action which reinforces the sugar transportation ability of peripheral cells and, as a result, lowers the blood glucose level. The compound of the formula (I) described in the patent application (WO02/44180) according to the present applicant has the effect of reinforcing the sugar transportation and is useful for treating the diabetic patients. Namely, the compound of the formula (I) is the compound which lowers the blood glucose level by reinforcing the sugar transportation activity of the peripheral cells, and can be oral administered agents having a new action mechanism.<br>
Further, though the effect of reinforcing the sugar transportation of the compound of the formula (I) has been described in the patent application (WO02/44180), the combinational effect thereof with the other agent(s) has not been described.<br>

Evaluation of the sugar transportation activity:<br>
1.   Preparation of adipose cells of rats^<br>
After the decapitation and venesection of 6 male Wistar rats (body weights 150 to 200 g), an incision was made in the abdomen of each rat to extract 6 g in total of epididymal adipose tissues. The tissues were finely cut into 2 mm x 2 mm pieces in 6 ml of KRH (Krebs-Ringer Hepes,<br><br>
composition- 130 mM of sodium chloride, 4.7 mM of potassium chloride, 1.2 mM of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 1.2 mM of magnesium sulfate, 1 mM of calcium chloride and 25 mM of Hepes, pH=7.6) containing 5 % of BSA (bovine serum albumin). 24 mg of collagenase (type I) was added thereto and the digestion treatment was conducted for about 40 minutes to obtain about 6 ml of isolated adipose cells. The collagenase was removed by the buffer exchange. 2 % BSA/KRH solution was added to the residue for the re-suspension to obtain 45 ml of an adipose cell suspension.<br>
2.   Evaluation of the sugar transportation activity'<br>
The sugar transportation activity of the compound (I) of the present invention was evaluated with reference to a method described in a literature [Annual Review of Biochemistry, Vol. 55, p. 1059 (1986)]. In the test, 200 U L of the adipose cell suspension was poured in each polystyrene test tube, 100 fi L of the solution of the test substance (by dilution of 10 mg/mL dimethyl sulfoxide solution with KRH) was added thereto, and the obtained mixture was shaken and then cultured at 37°C for 30 minutes.<br>
The sugar transportation activity was evaluated by measuring the quantity of 2-[uC(U)]-deoxy-D-glucose incorporated per a unit time. Namely, 2-[14C(U)l-deoxy-D-glucose was added to the adipose cell suspension after the pre-culture (the final concentration: 0.5 fi Ci/sample). 5 minutes after, cytochalasin B (final concentration: 10 /iM) was added to the mixture to terminate the sugar transportation. After forming a dinonyl phthalate layer, the obtained mixture was centrifuged to separate the adipose cells from the buffer. The quantity of 2-[14C(U)]-deoxy-D-glucose contained in the adipose cell layer was determined with a liquid scintillation counter to determine the quantity of the incorporated sugar. In this evaluation system, when insulin (100 nM) having the effect of reinforcing the sugar transportation was used, the effect was about 7 times as high as that obtained in the insulin-free control group.<br><br>
The results of the evaluation of the sugar transportation activity obtained by using 100  g/mL of the compound (I) of the present invention are shown in Table 3. The sugar transportation activity in Table 3 was evaluated on the basis of the reinforcing effect of insulin (100 nM).

Namely, when the compound of the formula (I) and at least one kind of an agent selected from above Group A are combined to use, remarkable antidiabetic activity is obtained as compared with the cases in which the compound of the formula (I) or at least one kind of an agent is used by itself. Therefore, the present invention is useful as agents for preventing/treating diabetes, diabetic complication, hyperinsulinemia, disorders of glucose metabolism or obesity.<br>
Since agents for preventing/treating diabetes of the present invention including the combination or mixture of the compound of the formula (I) and at least other one kind of an agent provide the antidiabetic activity, which cannot be obtained by using the conventional hypoglycemic agents, the present invention is highly useful for preventing or treating the diseases<br><br>
