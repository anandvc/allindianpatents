				<td>HEAT TRANSFER TUBE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to heat transfer tubes that may be used in<br>
heat exchangers and other components in air conditioners, refrigerators and<br>
other such devices. The present invention relates more particularly to heat<br>
transfer tubes having grooved inner surfaces that form fins along the inner<br>
surface of the tubes for improved heat transfer performance.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Heat transfer tubes with grooved inner surfaces are used primarily as<br>
evaporator tubes or condenser tubes in heat exchangers for air conditioning and<br>
refrigeration. It is known to provide heat transfer tubes with grooves and<br>
alternating "fins" on their inner surfaces. The grooves and the fins cooperate to<br>
enhance turbulence of fluid heat transfer mediums, such as refrigerants,<br>
delivered within the tube. This turbulence enhances heat transfer performance.<br>
The grooves and fins also provide extra surface area and capillary effects for<br>
additional heat exchange. This basic premise is taught in U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,847,212 to Withers, Jr. et al.<br>
It is further known in the art to provide internally enhanced<br>
heat exchange tubes made by differing methods; namely - seamless<br>
tubes and welded tubes. A seamless tube may include internal fins and<br>
grooves produced by passing a circular grooved member through the interior of<br>
the seamless tube to create fins on the inner surface of the tube. However, the<br>
shape and height of the resulting fins are limited by the contour of the circular<br><br>
member and method of formation. Accordingly, the heat transfer potential of<br>
such tubes is also limited.<br>
A welded tube, however, is made by forming a fiat workpiece into a<br>
circular shape and men welding the edges to form a tube. Since the workpiece<br>
may be worked before formation when flat, the potential for varying fin<br>
height, shape and various other parameters is increased. Accordingly, the heat<br>
transfer potential of such tubes is also increased.<br>
This method of tube formation is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,704,424 to Kohn,, et al. Kohn, et al. discloses a welded heat transfer tube<br>
having a grooved inner surface. In the described and claimed production<br>
method, a flat metallic board material is rounded in the lateral direction until<br>
the side edges are brought into contact with each other. At that point, the two<br>
edges of the board material are electrically seam welded together to form the<br>
completed tube. As stated therein, an advantage of this method is that any<br>
internal fins or grooves can be embossed onto one side of the tube while the<br>
metallic board is still flat, thereby permitting increased freedom of design<br>
attributes.<br>
Such design freedom is a key consideration in heat transfer tube<br>
design. It is a common goal to increase heat exchange performance by<br>
changing the pattern, shapes and sizes of grooves and fins of a tube. To that<br>
end, tube manufacturers have gone to great expense to experiment with<br>
alternative designs. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,791,405 to Takima et al.<br>
discloses a tube having grooved inner surfaces that have fins formed<br>
consecutively in a circumferential direction on the inner surface of the tube.<br>
A plurality of configurations are shown in the various drawing figures. U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,332,034 and 5,458,191 to Chiang et al. and U.S Patent No.<br>
5,975.196 to Gaffaney et al. all disclose a variation of this design referred to<br>
in this application as a cross-cut design. Fins are formed on the inner tube<br>
surface with a first embossing roller. A second embossing roller then makes<br><br><br>
cuts or notches cross-wise over and through the fins. This process is costly as at least two embossing<br>
rollers are required to form the cross-cut design. Moreover, the fins disclosed in all of the designs of<br>
these patents are separated by empty troughs or grooves. None of the designs capitalize on this empty<br>
area to enhance the heat transfer characteristics of the tubes.<br>
While these inner surface tube designs aim to improve the heat transfer performance of the<br>
tube, there remains a need in the industry to continue to improve upon tube designs by modifying<br>
existing and creating new designs that enhance heat transfer performance. Additionally, a need also<br>
exists to create designs and patterns that can be transferred onto the tubes more quickly and cost-<br>
effectively. As described hereinbelow, the applicant has developed new geometries for heat transfer<br>
tubes and, as a result, significantly improved heat transfer performance.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a heat transfer tube comprising an inner surface<br>
and an outer surface, wherein the inner surface comprises a plurality of primary fins, a plurality of<br>
intermediate fins, and a plurality of grooves defined by adjacent primary fins, the plurality of<br>
intermediate fins being positioned in at least some of the plurality of grooves to form a grid like<br>
pattern on the inner surface of the tube, at least a first portion of primary fins and intermediate fins<br>
being separated from at least a second portion of primary fins and intermediate fins by a channel that<br>
runs along a portion of the length of the inner surface of the tube.<br>
The invention further provides a tube comprising an inner surface and a longitudinal axis,<br>
wherein the inner surface comprises :<br>
a. a plurality of primary fins, wherein at least some of the plurality of primary fins are<br>
oriented substantially parallel to each other and wherein at least some of the plurality of primary fins<br>
are oriented at an angle relative to the longitudinal axis wherein the plurality of primary fins is<br>
divided into a first portion of primary fins and a second portion of primary fins;<br>
b. a plural ity of grooves defined by adjacent primary fins;<br>
c. a plurality of intermediate fins, wherein the plurality of intermediate fins are<br>
positioned in at least some of the plurality of grooves and wherein at least some of the intermediate<br>
fins are oriented at an angle relative to at least some of the primary fins, and<br>
d. a trenched groove that runs between the first portion of primary fins and the second<br>
portion of primary fins.<br>
The invention further provides a heat transfer tube comprising an inner surface and an outer<br>
surface, wherein the inner surface comprises:<br>
a. two sets of fins, comprising (i) a plurality of adjacent primary fins defining a groove<br>
between adjacent primary fins; and (ii) a plurality of short, intermediate fins positioned in at least<br>
some of the grooves between the adjacent primary fins, wherein the plurality of short intermediate<br>
fins are provided in a number greater than the number of adjacent primary fins; and<br>
b. a channel dividing the two set of fins providing a trench for fluid transfer mediums to<br>
flow between the two sets of fins.<br>
The invention further provides a tube comprising an inner surface and an outer surface<br>
wherein the inner surface comprises:<br>
a. a first set of a plurality of primary fins positioned substantially parallel to one another<br>
and defining (i) a plurality of primary fin axes and (ii) a first set of grooves between each set of<br>
adjacent primary fins;<br>
b. a first set of plurality of intermediate fins provided in an amount greater than the<br>
amount of the first set of primary fins, wherein the first set of a plurality of intermediate fins is<br>
positioned substantially parallel to one another in at least some of the first set of grooves,<br>
c. a second set of a plurality of primary fins positioned substantially parallel to one<br>
another and spaced apart from the first set of primary fins by a channel, wherein the second set of a<br>
plurality of primary fins define (i) a plurality of primary fin axes and (ii) a second set of grooves<br>
between each set of adjacent primary fins;<br>
d. a second set of a plurality of intermediate fins provided in an amount greater than the<br>
amount of the second set of primary fins, wherein the second set of a plurality of intermediate fins is<br>
positioned substantially parallel to one another in at least some of the second set of grooves, and<br>
e. a channel that separates the first set of primary and intermediate fins from the second<br>
set of primary and intermediate fins.<br>
Generally described, the present invention comprises an improved heat transfer tube and a<br>
method of formation thereof. The inner surface of the tube, after the design of the present invention<br>
has been embossed on a metal board and the board formed and welded into the tube, will have a<br>
primary set of fins and an intermediate sets of fins positioned in the areas between the primary fins<br>
and at an angle relative to the primary fins. While intermediate fins may be used with primary fins<br>
arranged in any pattern, in a preferred embodiment of the inner surface tube design, the intermediate<br>
fins are positioned relative to the primary fins to result in a grid-like appearance. Tests show that the<br>
performance of tubes having the intermediate fin designs of the present invention is significantly<br>
enhanced.<br>
The method of the present invention comprises rolling a flat metallic board<br>
between a first set of rollers shaped to create the primary and intermediate fin<br>
designs on at least one side of the board. While previous<br>
designs with similar performance use additional roller sets, the basic designs<br>
of the present invention may be transferred onto the board using a single roller<br>
set, thereby reducing manufacturing costs. Subsequent sets of rollers may be<br>
used, however, to impart additional design features to the board. After the<br>
desired pattern has been transferred onto the board with the rollers, the board<br>
is then formed and welded into a tube, so that, at a minimum, the inner surface<br>
design of the resulting tube includes the intermediate fins as contemplated by<br>
the present invention.<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide improved heat<br>
transfer tubes.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
Like existing designs, the inner surface design of the tube 10 of the<br>
present invention, one embodiment of which is illustrated in FIGS. 1-3,<br>
includes a set of primary fins 12 that run parallel to each other along the inner<br>
surface 20 of the tube 10. The cross-sectional shape of the primary fins 12<br>
may assume any shape, such as those disclosed in FIGS. 6-11, but preferably<br>
is triangular-shaped, having angled, straight sides 14, a rounded tip 16, and<br>
rounded edges 18 at the interface of the sides 14 and inner surface 20 of the<br>
tube 10 (see FIG. 4). The height of the primary fins HP may vary depending<br>
on the diameter of the tube 10 and the particular application, but is preferably<br>
between .004 - .02 inches. As shown in FIG. 3, the primary fins 12 may be<br>
positioned at a primary fin angle 0 between 0°-90° relative to the longitudinal<br>
axis 22 of the tube 10. Angle 9 is preferably between 5°-50° and more<br>
preferably between 5°-30°. Finally, the number of primary fins 12 positioned<br>
along the inner surface 20 of a tube 10, and thus the primary fin pitch PP<br>
(defined as the distance between the tip or centerpoint of two adjacent primary<br>
fins measured along a line drawn perpendicular to the primary fins), may vary,<br>
depending on the height HP and shape of the primary fins 12, the primary fin<br>
angle 0, and the diameter of the tube 10. Moreover, the primary fin shape,<br>
height HP, angle 9, and pitch PP may vary within a single tube 10, depending<br>
on the application.<br>
Unlike previous designs, the designs of the present invention capitalize<br>
on the empty areas or grooves 24 between the primary fins 12 to the enhance<br>
heat transfer characteristics of the tubes. Intermediate fins 26 are formed in<br>
the grooves 24 defined by the primary fins 12 to give the inner surface tube<br>
design a grid-like appearance. The intermediate fins increase the turbulence<br>
of the fluid and the inside surface area, and thereby the heat transfer<br>
performance of the tube 10. Additionally, the intermediate fin designs<br>
contemplated by the present invention may be incorporated onto the same<br>
roller as the primary fin design, thereby reducing the manufacturing costs of<br>
the tube 10.<br>
The intermediate fins 26 preferably extend the width of the groove 24<br>
to connect adjacent primary fins 12 (as shown in FIG. 3). Just as with the<br>
primary fins 12, the intermediate fins 26 may assume a variety of shapes,<br>
including but not limited to those shown in FIGS. 5-11. The intermediate fins<br>
26 may be, but do not have to be, shaped similar to the primary fins 12, as<br>
shown in FIG. 5. As with the primary fins 12, the number of intermediate fins<br>
26 positioned between the primary fins 12 (and therefore the intermediate fin<br>
pitch P1, defined as the distance between the tip or centerpoint of two adjacent<br>
intermediate fins measured along a line drawn perpendicular to the<br>
intermediate fins) and the height of the intermediate fins HI may be adjusted<br>
depending on the particular application. The height of the intermediate fins HI<br>
may, but do not have to, extend beyond the height of the primary fins HP. As<br>
shown in FIG. 3, the intermediate fins 26 are positioned at an intermediate fin<br>
angle ß measured from the counter-clockwise direction relative to the primary<br>
fins 12. Intermediate fin angle ß may be any angle more than 0°, but is<br>
preferably between 45°-135°.<br>
As with the primary fins, the intermediate fin shape, height HI, pitch PI,<br>
and angle ß need not be constant for all intermediate fins 26 in a tube 10, but<br>
rather all or some of these features may vary in a tube 10 depending on the<br>
application. For example, FIG. 12 illustrates a cross-section of a spread out<br>
tube 10 having an inner surface tube design with a variety of intermediate fin<br>
shapes, heights (HI-I, HI-2, and HI-3), and pitches (PI-I and PI-2).<br>
As shown in FIGS. 13-16, intermediate fins 26 may be used in<br>
conjunction with primary fins 12 arranged in any pattern, including, but not<br>
limited to, all of the patterns disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,791,405 to Takima<br>
et al., the entirety of which being herein incorporated by reference. For<br>
example, FIGS. 13-16 illustrate embodiments where some of the primary fins<br>
12 are arranged at an angle relative to other of the primary fins 12. In FIGS.<br>
13 and 14, the primary fins 12 intersect Similarly, in FIG. 16, portions of<br>
primary and intermediate fins run along the length of tube 10 while adjacent<br>
portions of primary and intermediate fins are arranged at angles thereto. In<br>
FIG. 15, the primary fins 12 do not intersect, but rather are separated by a<br>
channel 50 that runs along the length of the inner surface 20 of tube 10. More<br>
than one channel 50 may be provided along the inner surface 20 of tube 10.<br>
The depth of channel 50 into tube 10 can be varied depending on the<br>
application. Moreover, the surface of channel 50 can be, but does not have to<br>
be, smooth. Rather, grooves, ridges, and/or other features to roughen the<br>
surface of channel 50 can be provided.<br>
Additionally, instead of connecting adjacent primary fins 12, the<br>
intermediate fins 26 may be free-standing geometrical shapes, such as cones,<br>
pyramids, cylinders, etc. (as shown in FIG. 18).<br>
One skilled in the art would understand how to manipulate inner<br>
surface tube design variables of the primary and intermediate fins, including<br>
fin arrangement, shape, height HP and HI, angles 0 and ß and pitches PP and<br>
PI to tailor the inner surface tube design to a particular application in order to<br>
obtain the desired heat transfer characteristics.<br>
The tubes having patterns in accordance with the present invention<br>
may be manufactured using production methods and apparatuses well known<br>
in the art, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5.704.424 to Kohn, et al.,<br>
the entirety of which is herein incorporated by reference. As explained in<br>
Kohn, et al., a flat board, generally of metal, is passed between sets of rollers<br>
which emboss the upper and lower surface of the board. The board is then<br>
gradually shaped in subsequent processing steps until its edges meet and are<br>
welded to form a tube 10. The tube may be formed into any shape, including<br>
those illustrated in FIGS. 20-25. While round tubes have traditionally been<br>
used and are well-suited for purposes of the present invention, enhanced heat<br>
transfer properties have been realized using tubes 10 having a cross-sectional<br>
shape flatter than traditional round tubes, such as those illustrated in FIGS. 22,<br>
23, and 25. Consequently, it may be preferable during the shaping stage of<br>
production, but before the welding stage, to form tubes 10 having a flatter<br>
shape. Alternatively. the_tubes 10 may be formed into the traditinoal round<br>
shape and subsequently compressed to flatten the cross-sectional shape of the<br>
tube 10. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the tube 10<br>
may be formed into any shape, including but not limited to those illustrated in<br>
FIGS. 20-25, depending on the application.<br>
The tube 10 (and therefore the board) may be made from a variety of<br>
materials possessing suitable physical properties including structural integrity,<br>
malleability, and plasticity, such as copper and copper alloys and aluminum<br>
and aluminum alloys. A preferred material is deoxidized copper. While the<br>
width of the flat board will vary according to the desired tube diameter, a flat<br>
board having a width of approximately 1.25 inches to form a standard 3/8"<br>
tube outside diameter is a common size for the present application.<br>
To form the desired pattern on the board, the board is passed through a<br>
first set of deforming or embossing rollers 28, which consists of an upper<br>
roller 30 and a lower roller 32 (see FIG. 19). The pattern on the upper roller<br>
30 is an interlocking image of the desired primary and intermediate fin pattern<br>
for the inner surface of the tube 10 (i.e. the pattern on the upper roller<br>
interlocks with the embossed pattern on the tube). Similarly, the pattern of the<br>
lower roller 32 is an interlocking image of the desired pattern (if any) of the<br>
outer surface of the tube 10. FIG. 19 illustrates one set of rollers 28, the upper<br>
roller 30 having a pattern that includes an intermediate fin design as<br>
contemplated by the present invention.<br>
Note, however, that to manufacture a tube in accordance with the<br>
embodiment shown in FIG. 15, one or more longitudinal channels 50 are<br>
preferably first embossed along at least a portion of the length of the board<br>
with an embossing roller having ridges around the circumference of the roller.<br>
These ridges form the channels in the smooth board. The number of ridges<br>
provided on the roller coincides with the number of channels embossed on the<br>
board. After channel formation, the board is then subjected to the rollers 28 as<br>
described above. In this way, the pattern on the upper roller 30 is not<br>
embossed onto the depressed channels 50 in the board.<br>
The patterns on the rollers may be made by machining grooves on the<br>
roller surface. As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, because<br>
of the interlocking-image relationship between the rollers and the board, when<br>
the board is passed through the rollers, the grooves on the rollers form fins on<br>
the board and the portions of the roller surface not machined form grooves on<br>
the board. When the board is subsequently rolled and welded, the desired<br>
inner and outer patterns are thereby located on the tube.<br>
An advantage of the tubes formed in accordance with the present<br>
invention is that the primary and intermediate fin designs of the tubes may be<br>
machined on the roller and formed on the board with a single roller set, as<br>
opposed to the two sets of rollers (and consequently two embossing steps) that<br>
have traditionally been necessary to create existing inner surface tube designs,<br>
such as the cross-cut design, that enhance tube performance. Elimination of a<br>
roller set and embossing stage from the manufacturing process can reduce the<br>
manufacturing time and cost of the tube.<br>
However, while only one roller set is necessary to create the primary<br>
and intermediate fin designs of the present invention, subsequent and<br>
additional rollers may be used impart additional design features to the board.<br>
For example, a second set of rollers may be used to make cuts 38 cross-wise<br>
over and at least partially through the fins to result in a cross-cut design, as<br>
shown in FIG. 17.<br>
In an alternative design, the primary and intermediate fins form the<br>
sidewalls of a chamber. The tops of the primary fins may be formed, such as,<br>
for example, by pressing them with a second roller, to extend or flare laterally<br>
to partially, but not entirely, close the chamber. Rather, a small opening<br>
through which fluid is able to flow into the chamber remains at the top of the<br>
chamber. Such chambers enhance nucleate boiling of the fluid and thereby<br>
improve evaporation heat transfer.<br>
In addition to potentially reducing manufacturing costs, tubes having<br>
designs in accordance with the present invention also outperform existing<br>
tubes. FIGS. 26-29 graphically illustrate the enhanced performance of such<br>
tubes in condensation obtainable by incorporating intermediate fins into the<br>
inner surface tube design. Performance tests were conducted on four<br>
condenser tubes for two separate refrigerants (R-407c and R-22). The<br>
following copper tubes, each of which had a different inner surface design,<br>
were tested:<br>
(1) "Turbo-A®," a seamless or welded tube made by Wolverine<br>
Tube for evaporator and condenser coils in air conditioning and refrigeration<br>
with internal fins that run parallel to each other at an angle to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the tube along the inner surface thereof (designated "Turbo-A®");<br>
(2) a cross-cut tube made by Wolverine Tube for evaporator and<br>
condenser coils (designated "Cross-Cut");<br>
(3) a tube with an intermediate fin design in accordance with the<br>
present invention (designated "New Design"); and<br>
(4) a tube with an intermediate fin design in accordance with the<br>
present invention whereby the primary and intermediate fins have been cross-<br>
cut with a second roller (designated "New Design X").<br>
Figs. 26 and 27 reflect data obtained using R-22 refrigerant. Figs. 28<br>
and 29 reflect data obtained using R-407 refrigerant. The general testing<br>
conditions represented by these graphs are as follows:<br>
Evaporation Condensation<br>
Saturation Temperature 35° (1.67° C) 105°F(40.6°C)<br>
Tube Length 12 ft (3.66 m) 12 ft (3.66 m)<br>
Inlet Vapor Quality 10% 80%<br>
Outlet Vapor Quality 80% 10%<br>
The data was obtained for flowing refrigerant at different flow rates.<br>
Accordingly, the "x" plane of all the graphs is expressed in terms of mass flux<br>
(lb./hr. ft2). Figs. 26 and 28 show heat transfer performance. Accordingly, the<br>
"y" plane of these two graphs is expressed in terms of heat transfer co-<br>
efficient (Btu/hr. fit2). Figs. 27 and 29 show pressure drop information.<br>
Accordingly, the "y" plane of these two graphs is expressed in terms of<br>
pressure per square inch (PSI).<br>
The data for the R-407c refrigerant (Figs. 28 and 29), which is a<br>
zeotropic mixture, indicates that the condensation heat transfer perfonnance of<br>
the New Design is approximately 35% improved over the Turbo-A® design.<br>
Further, the New Design provides increased performance (by approximately<br>
15%) over the standard Cross-Cut design, which is currently regarded as the<br>
leading performer in condensation performance among widely<br>
commercialized tubes. In terms of pressure drop performance, the New<br>
Design performs as well as the Turbo-A® design and approximately 10%<br>
lower than the standard Cross-Cut design. The pressure drop is a very<br>
important design parameter in heat exchanger design. With the current<br>
technology in heat exchangers, a 5% decrease in pressure drop can sometimes<br>
provide as much benefit as a 10% increase in heat transfer performance.<br>
The new design makes use of an interesting phenomenon in two-phase<br>
heat transfer. In a tube embodiment of the present invention, where a fluid is<br>
condensing on the inside of the tube, the pressure drop is mainly regulated by<br>
the liquid-vapor interface. The heat transfer is controlled by the liquid-solid<br>
interface. The intermediate fins affect the liquid layer, thereby increasing the<br>
heat transfer, but do not impact the pressure drop. The relationship between<br>
the heat transfer and pressure drop is captured by the efficiency factor.<br>
With use of the R-22 refrigerant (Figs. 26 and 27), the New Design X<br>
outperformed the Turbo-A® and Cross-Cut designs with respect to heat<br>
transfer by nearly the same percentages as the New Design did in the R-407c<br>
tests. The inventor has no reason to believe that similar performance<br>
improvement will not be obtained using other refrigerants such as R-410(a) or<br>
R-134(a), and other similar fluids.<br>
FIGS. 30 and 31 compare the efficiency factors of the Cross-Cut<br>
design with the efficiency factors of the New Design (FIG. 30) and the New<br>
Design X (FIG. 31). The efficiency factor is a good indicator of the actual<br>
performance benefits associated with a tube inner surface because it reflects<br>
both the benefit of additional heat transfer and the drawback of additional<br>
pressure drop. In general, the efficiency factor of a tube is defined as the<br>
increase in heat transfer of that tube over a standard tube (in this case, the<br>
Turbo-A®) divided by the increase in pressure drop of that tube over the<br>
standard tube. The efficiency factors plotted in FIGS. 30 and 31 for the<br>
Cross-Cut were calculated as follows:<br>
The efficiency factors of the New Design and the New Design X, plotted in<br>
FIGS. 30 and 31, respectively, were similarly calculated.<br>
As can be seen in FIGS. 30 and 31, the efficiency factors for the New<br>
Design and the New Design X are all (with the exception of one) above "1",<br>
which indicates that the efficiency of both of these new designs is better than<br>
that of the standard Turbo-A® by as much as 40% in R-22 condensation (FIG.<br>
31) and by up to 35% in R-407c condensation (FIG. 30). Moreover, by<br>
comparing the efficiency factors of the Cross-Cut (FIGS. 30 and 31) plotted<br>
against the New Design (FIG. 30) and New Design X (FIG. 31), it is apparent<br>
that the efficiencies of the new designs are consistently better than the Cross-<br>
Cut tube by 20% in R-22 condensation (FIG. 31) and 10% in R-407c<br>
condensation (FIG. 30).<br>
Additionally, tests also demonstrate mat tubes having inner surfaces<br>
similar to those shown in Figs. 13 and 15 also outperform Turbo-A® tubes.<br>
The results of such tests are shown in Figs. 32 and 33, wherein a tube having<br>
an inner surface in accordance with Fig. 13 is designated "New Design 2" and<br>
a tube having an inner surface in accordance with Fig. 15 is designated "New<br>
Design 3." Figs. 32 and 33 reflect data obtained using R-22 refrigerant under<br>
the same condensation testing conditions described above.<br>
Figs. 32 and 33 show heat transfer performance and pressure drop,<br>
respectively. The data, as reflected in Figs. 32 and 33, indicates that the<br>
condensation heat transfer performance of the New Design 2 and New Design<br>
3 is approximately 80% and 40% improved, respectively, over the Turbo-A®<br>
design. Further, while the pressure drop for the New Design 2 increased over<br>
Turbo-A®, the New Design 3 exhibited pressure drop comparable to Turbo-<br>
A®. This data suggests that significant heat transfer benefits can be realized<br>
by incorporating the New Design 3 into existing systems to replace Turbo-A®<br>
tubes. In addition, by preventing the pattern from forming on a portion of the<br>
tube (i.e., in the channels 50), the amount of material in a unit length of tube is<br>
reduced. This results in significant cost savings to customers.<br>
Moreover, the New Design 2 may be particularly beneficial<br>
incorporated into redesigned systems. This is particularly significant in light<br>
of recent measures to increase efficiencies of air-conditioning equipment. By<br>
using the New Design 2 surface, one can attain increased performance in the<br>
same size of equipment or reduce the size of equipment Thus, it would be<br>
possible to reduce or eliminate expensive redesign efforts. In addition, by<br>
reducing the size of the system, one also reduces the amount of other<br>
components, like metal for the base, aluminum for the fins and tubing lines,<br>
that can result in considerable savings to the customer.<br>
Thus it is seen that a tube providing intermediate fins represents a<br>
significant improvement over cross-cut and single helical ridge designs. This<br>
new design thus advances the state of the art. It will be understood by those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art that various modifications may be made to the<br>
preferred embodiments within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined<br>
by the appended claims.<br>
