METHODS FOR MODULATING OSTEOCHONDRAL DEVELOPMENT<br>
USING PULSED ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD THERAPY<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application<br>
60/687,430 filed June 3, 2005, U.S. provisional patent application 60/693,490<br>
filed June 23, 2005, U.S. provisional patent application 60/782,462 filed March<br>
15,2006 and U.S. provisional patent application 60/790,128 filed April 7, 2006 .<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Diseases and injuries associated with bone and cartilage have a<br>
significant impact on the population. Approximately five million bone fractures<br>
occur annually in the United States alone. About 10% of these have delayed<br>
healing and of these, 150,000 to 200,000 nonunion fractures occur accompanied<br>
by loss of productivity and independence. In the case of cartilage, severe and<br>
chronic forms of knee joint cartilage damage can lead to greater deterioration of<br>
the joint cartilage and may eventually lead to a total knee joint replacement.<br>
Approximately 200,000 total knee replacement operations are performed<br>
annually and the artificial joint generally lasts only 10 to 15 years leading to<br>
similar losses in productivity and independence.<br>
Furthermore, the incidence of bone fractures is also expected to remain<br>
high in view of the incidence of osteoporosis as a major public health threat for<br>
an estimated 44 million Americans. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are<br>
estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to<br>
have low bone mass, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis. One in two<br>
women and one in four men over age 50 will have an osteoporosis-related<br>
fracture in their remaining life. Osteoporosis is responsible for more than 1.5<br>
million fractures annually, including: 300,000 hip fractures; 700,000 vertebral<br>
fractures; 250,000 wrist fractures; and 300,000 fractures at other sites. The<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
estimated national direct expenditures (hospitals and nursing homes) for<br>
osteoporotic hip fractures were $18 Billion in 2002 (National Osteoporosis<br>
Foundation Annual Report, 2002).<br>
Several treatments are currently available to treat recalcitrant fractures<br>
such as internal and external fixation, bone grafts or graft substitutes including<br>
demineralized bone matrix, platelet extracts and bone matrix protein, and<br>
biophysical stimulation such as mechanical strain applied through external<br>
fixators or ultrasound and electromagnetic fields.<br>
Similarly, typical treatment for cartilage injury, depending on lesion and<br>
symptom severity, are rest and other conservative treatments, minor arthroscopic<br>
surgery to clean up and smooth the surface of the damaged cartilage area, and<br>
other surgical procedures such as microfracture, drilling, and abrasion. All of<br>
these may provide symptomatic relief, but the benefit is usually only temporary,<br>
especially if the person's pre-injury activity level is maintained.<br>
Bone and other tissues such as cartilage respond to electrical signals in a<br>
physiologically useful manner. Bioelectrical stimulation devices applied to non-<br>
unions and delayed unions were initiated in the 1960s and is now applied to bone<br>
and cartilage (Clombor and Aaron, Foot Ankle Clin. 2005, (4):579-93).<br>
Currently, a market and general acceptance of their role in clinical practice has<br>
been established. Less well-known outcomes attributed to bioelectrical<br>
stimulation are positive bone density changes (Tabrah, 1990), and prevention of<br>
osteoporosis (Chang, 2003). A recent report offered adjunctive evidence that<br>
stimulation with pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) significantly accelerates<br>
bone formed during distraction osteogenesis (Fredericks, 2003).<br>
At present, clinical use of electrotherapy for bone repair consists of<br>
electrodes implanted directly into the repair site or noninvasive capacitive or<br>
inductive coupling. Direct current (DC) is applied via one electrode (cathode)<br>
placed in the tissue target at the site of bone repair and the anode placed in soft<br>
tissues. DC currents of 5-100 ÂµA are sufficient to stimulate osteogenesis. The<br>
capacitative coupling technique uses external skin electrodes placed on opposite<br>
sides of the fracture site. Sinusoidal waves of 20-200Hz are typically employed<br>
to induce l-100mV/cm electric fields in the repair site.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
The inductive coupling (PEMF) technique induces a time-varying electric<br>
field at the repair site by applying a time-varying magnetic field via one or two<br>
electrical coils. The induced electric field acts as a triggering mechanism which<br>
modulates the normal process of molecular regulation of bone-repair mediated by<br>
many growth factors. Bassett et al., were the first to report a PEMF signal could<br>
accelerate bone repair by 150% in a canine. Experimental models of bone repair<br>
show enhanced cell proliferation, calcification, and increased mechanical strength<br>
with DC currents. Such approaches also hold potential for cartilage injuries.<br>
Wounded tissue has an electrical potential relative to normal tissue.<br>
Electrical signals measured at wound sites, termed the "injury potential" or<br>
"current of injury", are DC (direct current) only, changing slowly with time.<br>
Bone fracture repair and nerve re-growth potentials are typically faster than usual<br>
in the vicinity of a negative electrode but slower near a positive one, where in<br>
some cases tissue atrophy or necrosis may occur. For this reason, most recent<br>
research has focused on higher-frequency, more complex signals often with no<br>
net DC component.<br>
Unfortunately, most electrotherapeutic devices now available rely on<br>
direct implantation of electrodes or entire electronic packages, or on inductive<br>
coupling through the skin using coils which generate time-varying magnetic<br>
fields, thereby inducing weak eddy currents within body tissues which<br>
inefficiently provides the signal to tissues and thus in addition to bulky coils<br>
requires relatively large signal generators and battery packs. The need for<br>
surgery and biocompatible materials in the one case, and excessive circuit<br>
complexity and input power in the other, has kept the price of most such<br>
apparatus relatively high, and has also restricted the application of such devices<br>
to highly trained personnel. There remains a need, therefore, for a versatile, cost-<br>
effective apparatus that can be used to provide bioelectric stimulation to<br>
differentially modulate the growth of osteochondral tissue to promote proper<br>
development and healing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to its major aspects and broadly stated, the present invention<br>
provides a method for modulating the growth or repair of, for example bone<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
tissue or cartilage, by administering an electrical signal to developing or damaged<br>
bone or cartilage tissue.<br>
The present invention overcomes the shortcomings of prior art devices<br>
and methods by enabling the delivery of bioelectrical signals optimized to<br>
correspond to selected features of natural body signals resulting in accelerated<br>
and more permanent healing. The signals described herein conform to selected<br>
features of natural signals and consequently tissues subjected to<br>
electrostimulation according to the present invention undergo minimal<br>
physiological stress. In addition, the present invention is non-invasive and cost-<br>
effective making it desirable for multiple applications for personal and individual<br>
use. Furthermore, the present methods provide electrical stimulation where the<br>
electrical signals closely mimic selected characteristics of natural body signals.<br>
The stimulated tissue is therefore subjected to minimal stress and growth and<br>
repair is greatly facilitated.<br>
In contrast to conventional TENS-type devices, which are aimed at<br>
blocking pain impulses in the nervous system, the apparatus used with the present<br>
methods operates at a stimulus level which is below the normal human threshold<br>
level of pain sensation and as such, most users do not experience any sensation<br>
during treatment to repair or promote growth of bone.<br>
The technology described herein uses a class of waveforms, some of<br>
which are novel and other which are known to have positive biological effects on<br>
tissues when applied through inductive coils, but have not been demonstrated to<br>
have positive biological effects through electrodes until now.<br>
Although no commercial bioelectrical devices are currently approved for<br>
osteoporosis therapy, the present invention provides a promising candidate. As<br>
demonstrated herein, unique pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) wave patterns<br>
may be advantageously applied at both a macroscopic level (i.e. common bone<br>
fractures) as well as at microscopic levels (i.e. osteoblast development). Certain<br>
embodiments of the invention maximize the utility and application of desired<br>
PEMF waveforms: for example, the spine, hip and/or wrist are the most common<br>
sites of osteoporotic fracture, for such types of fractures the inventors provide<br>
simple, self-adhesive, skin contact electrode pads as electrotherapeutic delivery<br>
vehicles. The use of such electrode pads results in the improvement of bone mass<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
at such key anatomical sites. At a microscopic level, the present inventors have<br>
identified specific PEMF waveforms and frequencies that optimize osteoblast<br>
development. As described in greater detail in the Examples (see Example 1) the<br>
inventors demonstrate that PEMF signals enhance osteoblast mineralization and<br>
matrix production, and that the signal confers structural features as well. The<br>
inventors also show that other PEMF signals enhanced cell proliferation and<br>
accompanying increases in bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). While both<br>
pulse-burst and continuous electrical signals may be used in the present<br>
invention, the administration of continuous rather than pulse-burst signals<br>
provided the more pronounced effects on proliferation and mineralization.<br>
The electrical signals of the present invention may be used to promote the<br>
repair and growth of structural tissues such as bone and cartilage. However, such<br>
systems and methods need not be confined to use with intact organisms, since<br>
isolated cells or tissue cultures can also be affected by electrotherapeutic<br>
waveforms (appropriate electrical stimuli have been observed to modify the rates<br>
of cell metabolism, secretion, and replication). Electrical signals are generally<br>
applicable to other connective tissues such as skin, ligaments, tendons, and the<br>
like. The electrical signals described herein may be used to stimulate other<br>
tissues to increase repair of the tissues and promote growth of tissues for<br>
transplantation purposes. Isolated skin cells, for example, might be treated with<br>
the devices and waveforms of the present invention in an appropriate growth<br>
medium to increase cell proliferation and differentiation in the preparation of<br>
tissue-cultured, autogenous skin-graft material. In a like manner, these<br>
bioelectric signals can be applied directly to injured or diseased skin tissue to<br>
enhance healing.<br>
Exogenous delivery of bioelectrical signals and progenitor cells such as<br>
bone marrow stromal cells-BMSCs to a fracture can lead to enhanced healing and<br>
repair of recalcitrant fractures. Both of these factors (bioelectricity and cell<br>
recruitment) are, in fact, parts of the natural healing process. For these<br>
applications, electrical stimulation using the waveforms described herein can be<br>
applied immediately after injury with an electrotherapy system. The<br>
electrotherapy system may be lightweight, compact and portable. Both electrical<br>
stimulation and universal cell-based therapy can be applied within a few days<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
after injury. Autologous cells may be added at time further after injury. The<br>
present invention also provides methods to induce bone repair or development<br>
that regenerates natural tissues rather than scar tissue.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide methods<br>
for modulating the proliferation and differentiation of bone tissue for facilitation<br>
of bone repair and development by administering novel electrical signals to bone<br>
tissue.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide novel culture<br>
systems comprising the use of PEMF for bone tissue engineering.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide novel culture<br>
systems of progenitor cells in combination with electrical stimulation.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide kits for the growth<br>
of autologous and allogeneic tissues for transplantation into a host in need<br>
thereof.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide methods for<br>
electrically stimulating uncommitted progenitor cells in vitro or in vivo to induce<br>
proliferation or differentiation.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide methods for<br>
modulating the growth of cartilage, bone or other connective tissue.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide methods for<br>
modulating the expression and release of bone morphogenic proteins.<br>
These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become apparent after review of the following detailed description of the<br>
disclosed embodiments and the appended claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following description includes the best presently contemplated mode<br>
of carrying out the invention. This description is made for the purpose of<br>
illustrating the general principles of the inventions and should not be taken in a<br>
limiting sense. The text of the references mentioned herein are hereby<br>
incorporated in their entireties by reference, including U.S. Provisional<br>
Application Ser. Nos. 60/687,430, 60/693,490, 60/782,462 and 60/790,128.<br>
It should be understood that the present in vitro applications of the<br>
invention described herein may also be extrapolated for in vivo applications,<br>
therapies and the like. One of ordinary skill will appreciate that technology<br>
developed using reduced preparations and in vitro models may ultimately be used<br>
for in vivo applications. Effective values and ranges for electrical stimulation in<br>
vivo may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or<br>
animal model test systems.<br>
The present invention enables the delivery of bioelectrical signals<br>
optimized to correspond to selected characteristics of natural body signals<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
resulting in accelerated and more permanent healing. The signals described<br>
herein uniquely conform to selected features of natural signals and consequently<br>
tissues subjected to electrostimulation according to the present invention undergo<br>
minimal physiological stress. In addition, the present invention is non-invasive<br>
and cost-effective making it desirable for multiple applications for personal and<br>
individual use.<br>
Bone remodeling<br>
Bone is one of the most rigid tissues of the human body. As the main<br>
component of the human skeleton, it not only supports muscular structures but<br>
protects vital organs in the cranial and thoracic cavities. Bone is composed of<br>
intercellular calcified material (the bone extracellular matrix) and different cell<br>
types: osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts. The extracellular matrix is<br>
composed of organic and inorganic components. The organic component<br>
includes cells, collagens, proteoglycans, hyaluronan and other proteins,<br>
phospholipids and growth factors. The rigidity of bone comes from the<br>
mineralized inorganic component which is predominantly calcium and<br>
phosphorus crystallized in the form of hydroxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. The<br>
combination of collagen and hydroxyapatite confers the hardness and stiffness<br>
characteristics of bone.<br>
Osteoblasts are derived from progenitor cells of mesenchymal origin and<br>
are localized at the surfaces next to emerging bone matrix and arranged side-by-<br>
side. The primary function of osteoblasts is the elaboration and development of<br>
bone matrix and to play a role in matrix mineralization. Osteoblasts are called<br>
osteocytes when embedded in the lacunae of the bone matrix and adopt a slightly<br>
different morphology and retain contact with other osteocytes. Osteoclasts are<br>
larger multinucleate cells containing receptors for calcitonin and integrin and<br>
other specialized structural features. The primary function of osteoclasts is to<br>
resorb both inorganic and organic components of calcified bone matrix.<br>
Bone remodeling is the fundamental and highly integrated process of<br>
resorption and formation of bone tissue that results in precisely balanced skeletal<br>
mass with renewal of the mineralized matrix. This renewable process is achieved<br>
without compromising the overall anatomical architecture of bones. This<br>
continuous process of internal turnover ensures that bone maintains a capacity for<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
true regeneration and maintenance of bone integrity by continuous repairing of<br>
microfractures and alterations in response to stress. The architecture and<br>
composition of the adult skeleton is in perpetually dynamic equilibrium.<br>
Remodeling also provides a means for release of calcium in response to<br>
homeostatic demands. Conditions that influence bone remodeling include<br>
mechanical stimuli such as immobilization or weightlessness, electric current or<br>
electromagnetic fields such as capacitively coupled electric field or pulsed<br>
electromagnetic field, hormonal changes or in response to certain inflammatory<br>
diseases.<br>
Bone remodeling occurs through orchestrated cycles of activity that<br>
include activation, resorption, reversal, formation, and quiescence steps.<br>
Activation is characterized by the existence of a thin layer of lining cells. Then<br>
circulating mononuclear cells of hematopoetic lineage begin to migrate into the<br>
activation site and fuse together to form osteoclasts. Activation is followed by<br>
resorption where active osteoclasts excavate a bony surface. This step typically<br>
lasts about 2-4 weeks. Reversal occurs following resorption and continues for a<br>
period of 9 days during this time inactive pre-osteoblasts are present in the<br>
resorption depressions. The next step is formation and takes about 3-4 months.<br>
During this stage active osteoblasts refill the excavation site. The last phase of<br>
bone remodeling is quiescence where no remodeling activity occurs until the<br>
beginning of the next remodeling cycle. Ideally the quantity of bone fill must<br>
equal the quantity resorbed with no loss of bone mass.<br>
Waveforms<br>
The present invention provides electrical signals and waveforms that<br>
enable specific actions on biological tissues. Such waveforms are effective for<br>
both in vivo and in vitro applications. Osteochondral tissues are shown herein to<br>
respond differently to markedly different frequencies and waveforms.<br>
Of particular interest are signals comprising alternating rectangular or<br>
quasirectangular pulses having opposite polarities and unequal lengths, thereby<br>
forming rectangular, asymmetric pulse trains. Pulses of specific lengths have<br>
been theorized to activate specific cell biochemical mechanisms, especially the<br>
binding of calcium or other small, mobile, charged species to receptors on the cell<br>
membrane, or their (usually slower) unbinding. The portions of such a train<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
having opposite polarities may balance to yield substantially a net zero charge,<br>
and the train may be either continuous or divided into pulse bursts separated by<br>
intervals of substantially zero signal. Stimuli administered in pulse-burst mode<br>
have similar actions to those administered as continuous trains, but their actions<br>
may differ in detail due to the ability (theoretically) of charged species to unbind<br>
from receptors during the zero-signal periods, and required administration<br>
schedules may also differ.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic view of a base waveform 20 effective for<br>
stimulating bone and cartilage tissue, where a line 22 represents the waveform in<br>
continuous mode, and line 24 represents the same waveform on a longer time<br>
scale in pulse-burst mode, levels 26 and 28 represent two different characteristic<br>
values of voltage or current, and intervals 30, 32, 34 and 36 represent the timing<br>
between specific transitions. Levels 26 and 28 are usually selected so that, when<br>
averaged over a full cycle of the waveform, there is no net direct-current (D.C.)<br>
component although levels 26 and 28 may be selected to result in a net positive or<br>
net negative D.C. component if desired. In real-world applications, waveform<br>
such as 20 is typically modified in that all voltages or currents decay<br>
exponentially toward some intermediate level between levels 26 and 28, with a<br>
decay time constant preferably longer than interval 34. The result is represented<br>
by a line 38. The waveforms described herein generally have two signal<br>
components: a longer component shown as interval 30 and a shorter component<br>
shown as interval 32 relative to each other.<br>
Variation in the short and long signal component lengths confers specific<br>
effects of a stimulated tissue. Pulse lengths of interest in this invention may be<br>
defined as follows, in order of increasing length:<br>
Length Î±: between 5 and 75 Âµsec in duration, preferably between 10 and 50 Âµsec<br>
in duration, more preferably between 20 and 35 Âµsec in duration and most<br>
preferably about 28 Âµsec in duration.<br>
Length p: between 20 and 100 Âµsec in duration, preferably between 40 and 80<br>
fisec in duration, more preferably between 50 and 70 Âµsec in duration and most<br>
preferably about 60 Âµsec in duration.<br>

Length y: between 100 and 1000 Âµsec in duration, preferably between 150 and<br>
800 Âµsec in duration, more preferably between 180 and 500 Âµsec in duration and<br>
most preferably about 200 Âµsec in duration.<br>
Length 5: in excess of 1 millisecond in duration, preferably between 5 and 100<br>
msec in duration, more preferably between 10 and 20 msec in duration and most<br>
preferably about 13 msec in duration.<br>
In a first embodiment the electrical signal has a shorter component of<br>
length a and a longer component of length (3: thus having, with the most<br>
preferable pulse lengths of each type (28 Âµsec and 60 Âµsec respectively), a<br>
frequency of about 11.4 KHz. Signals comprised of pulses alternately of length a<br>
and length Î² are referred to herein as "type A" signals and their waveforms as<br>
"type A" waveforms. An example a "type-A signal administered as a continuous<br>
pulse train is shown in Figure 2a. Signals such as this are useful for promoting<br>
the proliferation of a tissue sample or culture for a variety of biological or<br>
therapeutic applications.<br>
In pulse-burst mode, "type A" waveforms would be turned on in bursts of<br>
about 0.5 to 500 msec, preferably about 50 msec, with bursts repeated at 0.1-10<br>
Hz or preferably about 1 Hz. An example of this type of waveform is shown in<br>
Figure 2b.<br>
In a second embodiment the electrical signal has a shorter component of<br>
length a but a longer component of length Î³: thus having, with the most<br>
preferable pulse lengths of each type (28 Âµsec and 200 Âµsec respectively), a<br>
frequency of about 4.4 KHz. Signals comprised of pulses alternately of length a<br>
and length Î³ are referred to herein as "type B" signals and their waveforms as<br>
"type B" waveforms. Such waveforms were previously described in U.S. patent<br>
application no. 10/875,801 (publication no. 2004/0267333). An example of a<br>
"type-B" signal administered as a continuous pulse train is shown in Figure 3a.<br>
Signals such as this are useful in pain relief and in promoting bone healing, and<br>
also stimulate the development of cancellous-bone-like structures in osteoblast<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
cultures in vitro, with applications to the field of surgical bone repair and grafting<br>
materials.<br>
In pulse-burst mode, "type B" waveforms are turned on in bursts of about<br>
1 to 50 msec, preferably about 5 msec, with bursts repeated at 5-100 Hz or<br>
preferably about 15 Hz. An example of this type of waveform is shown in Figure<br>
3 b. This waveform is similar in shape and amplitude to effective currents<br>
delivered by typical inductive (coil) electromagnetic devices that are commonly<br>
used in non-union bone stimulation products e.g. EBI MEDICA, INC.Â®<br>
(Parsippany, NJ) and ORTHOFIX, INC.Â® (McKinney, TX).<br>
In a third embodiment the electrical signal has a shorter component of<br>
length Î² but a longer component of length y: thus having, with the most<br>
preferable pulse lengths of each type (60 Âµsec and 200 Âµsec respectively) a<br>
frequency of about 3.8 KHz. Signals comprised of pulses alternately of length<br>
(3 and length Î³ are referred to herein as "type C" signals and their waveforms as<br>
"type C" waveforms. Signals such as this are useful in promoting bone<br>
regeneration, maturation and calcification.<br>
In pulse-burst mode, "type C" waveforms are turned on in bursts of about<br>
1 to 50 msec, preferably about 5 msec, with bursts repeated at 5-100 Hz or<br>
preferably about 15 Hz, much the same as "type B." This waveform is similar in<br>
shape and amplitude to effective currents delivered by other typical inductive<br>
(coil) electromagnetic devices commonly used in non-union bone stimulation<br>
products, e.g. the ORTHOFIX, INC.Â® (McKinney, TX) PhysioStim LiteÂ® which<br>
is designed to promote healing of spinal fusions.<br>
In a fourth embodiment the electrical signal has a shorter component of<br>
length Î³ and a longer component of length 5: thus having, with the most<br>
preferable pulse lengths of each type (200 Âµsec and 13 msec respectively) a<br>
frequency of about 75 Hz. Signals comprised of pulses alternately of length y and<br>
length 8 are referred to herein as "type D" signals and their waveforms as "type<br>
D" waveforms. Signals such as this are useful especially in promoting cartilage<br>
healing and bone calcification, and in treating or reversing osteoporosis and<br>
osteoarthritis. While broadly similar to that delivered through electrodes by the<br>
BIONICARE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES INC.Â® BIO-1000â¢, as shown in<br>
Figure 3 of U.S. Patent #5,273,033 which is here incorporated by reference, the<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
"type D" signal differs substantially in wave shape (it is rectangular rather than<br>
exponential) and in the fact that it is preferably charge-balanced.<br>
In pulse-burst mode, "type D" waveforms are turned on in bursts of at<br>
least 100 msec, preferably about 1 second, with bursts repeated at intervals of one<br>
second or more.<br>
The signal intensity may also vary; indeed, more powerful signals often<br>
give no more benefit than weaker ones, and sometimes less. For a typical signal<br>
(such as the signal of Figure 1), a peak effectiveness typically falls somewhere<br>
between one and ten microamperes per square centimeter ÂµA/cm2), and a<br>
crossover point at about a hundred times this value. Beyond this point, the signal<br>
may slow healing or may itself cause further injury.<br>
Of particular relevance to the present methods are electrical signals or<br>
waveforms, that run in continuous mode instead of burst mode. (For example<br>
Figures 2a or 3a). Continuously run signals have effects similar to those of pulse-<br>
burst signals, but may require different delivery schedules to achieve similar<br>
results.<br>
For the waveforms used with the methods of the present invention, typical<br>
applied average current densities are between 0.1 and 1000 microamperes per<br>
square centimeter, preferably between 0.3 and 300 microamperes per square<br>
centimeter, more preferably between 1 and 100 microamperes per square<br>
centimeter, and most preferably about 10 microamperes per square centimeter,<br>
resulting in voltage gradients ranging between 0.01 and 1000, 0.03 and 300, 0.1<br>
and 100, and 1 and 10 microamperes per centimeter, respectively, in typical body<br>
tissues. The individual nearly-square wave signal is asynchronous with a long<br>
positive segment and a short negative segment or vice versa. The positive and<br>
negative portions balance to yield a zero net charge or optionally may be charge<br>
imbalanced with an equalizing pulse at the end of the pulse to provide zero net<br>
charge balance over the waveform as a whole. These waveforms delivered by<br>
skin electrodes use continuous rectangular or approximately rectangular rather<br>
than sinusoidal or strongly exponentially decaying waveforms. Other waveforms<br>
useful in the methods of the present invention are disclosed in published U.S.<br>
patent application 10/875,801 (publication no. 2004/0267333) incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety.<br>

WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
The electrical signals described above may be administered to cells,<br>
biological tissues or individuals in need of treatment for intermittent treatment<br>
intervals or continuously throughout the day. A treatment interval is defined<br>
herein as a time interval that a waveform is administered in pulse or continuous<br>
mode. Treatment intervals may be about 10 minutes to about 4 hours in duration,<br>
about 30 minutes to about 2.5 hours in duration or about 1 hour in duration.<br>
Treatment intervals may occur between about 1 and 100 times per day. The<br>
duration and frequency of treatment intervals may be adjusted for each case to<br>
obtain an effective amount of electrical stimulation to promote cell proliferation,<br>
cell differentiation, bone growth, development or repair. The parameters are<br>
adjusted to determine the most effective treatment parameters.<br>
Signals do not necessarily require long hours of duration in the treatment<br>
interval although 24 hours administration may be used if desired. Typically, 30<br>
minutes (repeated several times a day) is required for biological effectiveness. In<br>
vitro cell proliferation may be measured by standard means such as cell counts,<br>
increases in nucleic acid or protein synthesis. Upregulation or down regulation of<br>
matrix proteins (collagen types I, III, and IV) as well as growth factors and<br>
cytokines (such as TGF-B, VEGF, SLPI, FN, MMPs) may also be measured<br>
(mRNA and protein synthesis). In vivo effects may be determined by rate of<br>
healing of an injury or measuring bone mass density. Other diagnostic methods<br>
for proliferation, differentiation or mineralization of bone tissue will be readily<br>
apparent to one of ordinary skill.<br>
In one embodiment, proliferation-promoting and differentiation-<br>
promoting signals are used sequentially. This combination of waveforms is used<br>
to increase the cell number and then promote differentiation of the cells. As an<br>
example, the sequential use of proliferation and differentiation signals may be<br>
used to promote proliferation of osteoblasts and then differentiation of the<br>
osteoblasts into mineral producing osteocytes that promote mineralization of<br>
bone or vice versa. For example, a treatment paradigm may be used where a<br>
proliferation-promoting A-type signal is administered first to a cell population in<br>
vitro or ex vivo for hours, days or weeks and then the proliferation promoting<br>
signal is replaced with a mineralization-promoting B-type signal for hours, days<br>
or weeks until bone mineralization has been effected. The tissue produced may<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
then be transplanted for patient benefit. Both signals may also be applied<br>
simultaneously to promote both proliferation, differentiation and mineralization<br>
simultaneously.<br>
The electric signals may be delivered by skin electrodes, or<br>
electrochemical connection. Skin electrodes are available commercially in sizes<br>
such as 1 1/2 X 12, 2 X 3 1/2, and 2X2 inches that may be useful for application<br>
to the spine, hips, and arm, respectively. These reusable electrodes are<br>
advantageous because they do not contain latex and have not shown significant<br>
skin irritation. The reusable electrodes can be used multiple times; also reducing<br>
costs to the patient. Such electrodes may include electrodes #214 (1/5" x 13"),<br>
#220 (2"x2") and #230 (2"x3/5") (KOALATY PRODUCTSÂ®, Tampa, FL.) or<br>
electrodes #T2020 (2"x2") and #T2030 (2"x3.5") (VERMED, INCÂ®, Bellows<br>
Falls, VT).<br>
There are multiple advantages of using skin electrodes instead of<br>
electromagnetic coils. Firstly, skin electrodes are more efficient. With electrodes,<br>
only the signal which will actually be sent into the body must be generated. With<br>
a coil, because of poor electromagnetic coupling with the tissues, the signal put in<br>
must be many, many times stronger than that desired in the tissues. This makes<br>
the required generating circuitry for electrodes potentially much simpler than for<br>
coils, while requiring much less power to operate. Secondly, skin electrodes are<br>
more user friendly. Skin electrodes have at most a few percent of the weight<br>
and bulk of coils needed to deliver equivalent signal levels. Similarly, because of<br>
better coupling efficiency the signal generators to drive electrodes can be made<br>
much smaller and lighter than those for coils. After a short time, a wearer hardly<br>
notices they are there. Thirdly, skin electrodes are more economical. Unlike<br>
coils, which cost hundreds to thousands of dollars each, electrodes are "throw-<br>
away" items typically costing less than a dollar. Also, because of greater<br>
efficiency and simplicity, the signal generators and batteries to drive them can be<br>
small and inexpensive to manufacture compared with those for coils. Fourthly,<br>
skin electrodes permit simpler battery construction and longer battery life<br>
facilitating the ease and patient compliance of using the device. Lastly, skin<br>
electrodes are more versatile than electromagnetic coils. Coils must be built to<br>
match the geometric characteristics of body parts to which they will be applied,<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
and each must be large enough to surround or enclose the part to be treated. This<br>
means to "cover" the body there must be many, many different coil sizes and<br>
shapes, some of them quite large. With electrodes, on the other hand, current<br>
distribution is determined by electrode placement only and readily predictable<br>
throughout the volume between, so the body may be "covered" with just a few<br>
electrode types plus a list of well-chosen placements.<br>
Stimulation systems<br>
Also contemplated by the present invention are biological systems that<br>
include cells and stimulators for delivering electrical signals to cells. Such cells<br>
may include, but are not limited to, precursor cells such as stem cells,<br>
uncommitted progenitors, committed progenitor cells, multipotent progenitors,<br>
pluripotent progenitors or cells at other stages of differentiation. Such cells may<br>
be embryonic, fetal, or adult cells and may be harvested or isolated from<br>
autologous or allogeneic sources. In one embodiment proliferative cells are used<br>
although non-proliferative cells may also be used in the methods described<br>
herein. Such cells may be combined in vitro, for example in tissue culture, or in<br>
vivo for tissue engineering or tissue repair applications. Transplanted stem cells<br>
may be selectively attracted to sites of injury or disease and then electrically<br>
stimulated to provide enhanced healing.<br>
Stimulating cell cultures in accordance with the method and purpose of<br>
the present invention also requires a practical means of delivering uniform<br>
waveforms simultaneously to many culture wells without disturbing the<br>
incubation process or causing contamination. Devices are provided herein for<br>
electrically stimulating cultures during incubation that preferably contain six<br>
tissue culture wells connected as a multi-well system using specially designed<br>
capacitively coupled anodized electrode systems for signal administration. By<br>
using a ribbon cable attachment, leaks at the seal of the incubator are minimized<br>
maintaining the controlled CO2 environment for the cultures. A typical setup is<br>
shown, in partly schematic form, in Figure 4.<br>
In the setup shown for example in Figure 4, six tissue culture wells 110a<br>
through 110f are interconnected and each well includes electrodes 140 at the<br>
chamber ends formed by two 15-mm and one 7.5-mm straight segments of wire,<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
joined by hairpin bends and connected by a right-angle bend to the central part<br>
142 of the bridge 112. Seven such bridges are shown in Figure 4. The electrodes<br>
140 are sized to fit the end walls of a Lab-Tek II slide chamber, which measures<br>
18 by 48 millimeters internally with a typical 3-mm fill depth. The capacitance<br>
of such an electrode is about 0.56 microfarad. Bridges 112a and 112g differ in<br>
having end-well spirals 144 each containing about 15cm of wire. The resulting<br>
capacitance between the bridge wire 112a or 112g and the corresponding silver<br>
electrode 104, is about 2.3 microfarads.<br>
Bridges 112a, 112b and so forth, formed of solid, relatively inert metal,<br>
connect chambers 110a, 110b and so forth electrically in series between end wells<br>
106a and 106b. While six chambers 110a through 1 lOf, and seven bridges 112a<br>
through 112g, are shown here, any other convenient numbers "n" of chambers<br>
and "n+1" of bridges could be used. In addition, a plurality of such series-<br>
connected groups each comprised of "n" chambers, "n+1" bridges and two end<br>
wells could be used with a single signal source 100, using a signal distribution<br>
means such as a resistor network to divide the signal energy among the groups, as<br>
is well known in the art of electronic signaling.<br>
The total electrical impedance of the setup shown, with twelve chamber<br>
electrode ends, two end-well spiral electrode 106 and six chambers as described,<br>
is chiefly capacitive at 0.045 microfarad plus a resistive component of about<br>
10,000 ohms. A series resistor (not shown) connected between signal source 100<br>
and end well 106a can both regulate the applied current to a desired level and also<br>
"swamp out" the capacitive part of the series reactance. For example, with a 1-<br>
Megohm resistor the frequency response is uniform within +/- 3 dB from 5 Hz to<br>
3Mhz.<br>
If desired, the signal energy distribution in a chamber may be measured<br>
with probes as shown in the magnified chamber 110b. Probes 120, made of any<br>
reasonably inert metal but preferably of 99.9% pure silver as electrodes 104a and<br>
104b, insulated except at their tips, and with these tips set a known and fixed<br>
distance apart, are immersed in medium 122 and moved into a succession of<br>
positions, preferably marking a rectangular grid. The differential voltage at each<br>
position is read by a differential amplifier 124, such as an Analog Devices<br>
AD522, and sent to an oscilloscope or other device, generally indicated by 126,<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
for display or recording. The results are conveniently represented as an array of<br>
numbers representing the ratio of signal intensity at each point to the overall<br>
average, as shown at the bottom of Figure 4 again for the magnified chamber<br>
110b. Alternatively, other means such as color-coding or three-dimensional<br>
graphing may be used.<br>
The results are conveniently represented as an array of numbers<br>

shown at the bottom of Figure 4 again for the magnified chamber 110b.<br>
Alternatively, other means such as color-coding or three-dimensional graphing<br>
may be used.<br>
As is shown by the grid in Figure 4, the signal distribution with electrodes<br>
placed at the narrow ends of a rectangular chamber is typically quite uniform<br>
save in the small regions immediately adjacent to the electrodes themselves.<br>
Uniformity also improves with time, either in medium or in plain saline, as cut or<br>
broken oxide heals. The above-average readings at lower left in Figure 4, for<br>
example, may have resulted from incompletely healed oxide at the cut wire end.<br>
For convenience in handling, minimal medium evaporation and ease in<br>
maintaining sterility, all of the chambers, bridges and end wells in a group may<br>
conveniently be assembled on a rigid glass plate or other sterilizable carrier, and<br>
one of more of these plates once assembled may then be enclosed in an outer<br>
container such as a rigid plastic box.<br>
The present invention also provides novel stimulation devices for<br>
delivering electrical signals in order to promote bone growth or repair.<br>
Specifically, novel passive electrode systems are provided for delivering<br>
electrical signals. These electrode systems couple time-varying electric signals<br>
for in vitro or in vivo applications; and replace conventional electrolyte bridge<br>
technology for the delivery of PEMF-type signals by induction in favor of a<br>
capacitive coupling. The electrode systems may be made of materials such as,<br>
but not limited to, anodized metals such as niobium, tantalum, titanium,<br>
zirconium, molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium. Aluminum and stainless steels<br>
share this property but to a much lesser degree, since they are slowly attacked by<br>
solutions containing chloride ion. At usable frequencies, typically between about<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
5Hz and 3 MHz and, with circuit refinement, from below about 1 Hz to in excess<br>
of about 30 MHz, DC current passage is negligible.<br>
Niobium is one of several metals that is self-passivating thereby forming<br>
thin but very durable surface oxide layers when exposed to oxygen and moisture.<br>
This process can be controlled by anodization. Generally self-passivation makes<br>
reliable connection with other methods difficult, however the present design<br>
uniquely uses capacitive coupling to induce a current in the electrode and thereby<br>
avoids the difficulty of forming electrical connections with other metals. This<br>
electrode system provides negligible electrolysis and no physiologically<br>
significant cytotoxicity and is also useful for in vivo applications.<br>
The wires that are used with the electrode system of the present invention<br>
are "self-protecting," forming thin, but very durable and tightly adhering surface<br>
layers of non-reactive oxides when exposed to moisture or oxygen. The oxide so<br>
formed has a high dielectric constant, and the thickness of the oxide is<br>
substantially uniform and can be closely controlled. The protective oxide coating<br>
allows the metal to act as a coupling capacitor for introducing alternating current<br>
(zero net charge, or ZNC) electric signals to culture media with even distribution<br>
and negligible electrolysis.<br>
A stimulator or other signal source, generally indicated by 100, is<br>
connected through wires, clip leads or by any other convenient means 102 to a<br>
pair of relatively inert metal electrodes 104a and 104b which are immersed in<br>
electrically conductive fluid in end wells 106a and 106b. These provide an entry<br>
point for the signal to the assembly of culture chambers 110a, 110b and so forth<br>
to which it is to be applied. Fine (99.9% pure) silver is preferred for electrodes<br>
104a and 104b, and saline (sodium chloride solution) for the fluid in end wells<br>
106a and 106b, since in use a thin layer of silver chloride forms at the interface<br>
and through a reversible electrochemical reaction facilitates the passage of<br>
electric current. Other metals and fluids, however, may also be used.<br>
Bridges 112a, 112b and so forth may be formed of any relatively inert<br>
metal provided that it is not cytotoxic. Metals typically used as inert electrodes<br>
for biological fluids are silver, gold, platinum and the other platinum-group<br>
metals. Unfortunately these are very costly, may permit or even catalyze some<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
electrochemical reactions at their surfaces (especially if minor impurities are<br>
present), and the products of such reactions may be cytotoxic.<br>
For this reason the group of so-called' "self-protecting" metals, which on<br>
contact with water or aqueous solutions form thin, continuous, highly insoluble<br>
and biologically inert surface oxide layers sealing the metal surface away from<br>
further fluid contact, are preferred in this invention. This oxide forms the only<br>
contact between the electrical signal delivery system and the culture medium.<br>
Such metals include niobium, tantalum, titanium, zirconium, molybdenum,<br>
tungsten and vanadium. Aluminum and stainless steels share this property but to<br>
a much lesser degree, since they are slowly attacked by solutions containing<br>
chloride ion (as nearly all biological fluids do).<br>
Oxide formation on such a metal can be enhanced, and the oxide<br>
thickness increased in a closely controllable manner, through anodization.<br>
Uniform oxide thickness gives uniform capacitance per unit area of metal surface,<br>
in turn yielding relatively uniform signal intensity over the surface almost<br>
regardless of its shape in the fluid. Small breaks in the oxide, caused by cutting<br>
and forming, heal rapidly by further reaction with the fluid.<br>
Niobium is preferred especially for this application since, thanks to the<br>
vivid and stable colors created by light interference in the surface oxide (Nb2O5)<br>
produced by anodization, it is popular in jewelry and thus available at reasonable<br>
cost in convenient forms and a variety of stock colors. Rio Grande Jeweler's<br>
Supply, for example, stocks 20- and 22-gauge round niobium wire pre-anodized<br>
to "purple," "pink," "dark blue," "teal," "green" and "gold," each color<br>
representing a different oxide thickness. The wire is easily worked and formed to<br>
any desired electrode shape. Given the refractive index of Nb2O5 (No = 2.30) and<br>
its dielectric constant (ÎR = 41 Îµo), the oxide thickness may be measured easily<br>
from the light reflection spectrum, and the resulting capacitance per unit of area<br>
or wire length may be calculated. "Purple" wire has the thinnest oxide, measured<br>
at 48 nM from the 420-nM peak reflectance, and thus for 22-gauge "purple" wire<br>
(.0644 cm diameter; Rio Grande catalog number 638-240) the capacitance was<br>
calculated at 0.154 microfarad per centimeter of wire length. Direct<br>
measurement initially gave much higher readings due to oxide breaks, but after<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
24 hours in saline the measured capacitance had stabilized at 0.158 microfarad<br>
per centimeter, close to the predicted value.<br>
Bridges 112a, 112b and so forth thus function electrically much as<br>
conventional salt bridges do, save that there is no possibility of fluid or ion flow<br>
through them, thus avoiding possible cross-contamination between chambers or<br>
between a chamber and an end well. In addition, the problems of evaporation<br>
and possible breakage encountered with conventional salt bridges, and the<br>
inconvenience of working with agar or other gelling agents, are avoided. Since<br>
they are electrically capacitive, the bridges block direct current and thus the<br>
signal reaching the chambers is charge-balanced between phases, with any direct-<br>
current component removed.<br>
All bridge ends making contact with the growth medium preferably have<br>
the same approximate dimensions and contain roughly the same length of wire,<br>
so all have roughly equal capacitance, and are placed against the narrow ends of<br>
culture chambers which themselves are preferably rectangular, as shown in the<br>
magnified chamber 110b in Figure 4. The bridge ends making contact with the<br>
fluid in the end wells (for example, the left ends of bridges 112a and 112g in<br>
Figure 4) may if desired be given a different form to enhance contact, decrease<br>
capacitance, and/or better fit the size and shape of the end wells if these differ<br>
from the culture chambers. For example, when using round end wells the bridge<br>
ends immersed in them may conveniently be formed as spirals 144 as shown in<br>
Figure 4.<br>
In summary therefore, the biological systems as contemplated by the<br>
present invention comprise the following elements: electrical simulators,<br>
anodized metal electrodes, and cells. Suitable PEMF signals for use in such<br>
systems include waveforms as described for example in Figures 2 or 3. Practical<br>
applications of such signals include increasing proliferation, differentiation or<br>
mineralization of bone tissue, increasing BMP expression, or increasing nitric<br>
oxide production.<br>
Tissue engineering<br>
The methods of the present invention may also be used in tissue<br>
engineering applications. Cells may be cultured using the methods and culture<br>
systems of the present invention in combination with biologically compatible<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
scaffolds to generate functional tissues in vitro or ex vivo or transplanted to form<br>
functional tissues in vivo. Transplanted or host stem cells may also be selectively<br>
transplanted or attracted to a site of injury or disease and then stimulated with the<br>
electrical signals described herein to provide enhanced healing or recovery.<br>
Tissue scaffolds may be formed from biocompatible natural polymers, synthetic<br>
polymers, or combinations thereof, into a non-woven open celled matrix having a<br>
substantially open architecture, which provides sufficient space for cell<br>
infiltration in culture or in vivo while maintaining sufficient mechanical strength<br>
to withstand the contractile, compressive or tensile forces exerted by cells<br>
growing within the scaffold during integration of the scaffold into a target site<br>
within a host. Tissue scaffolds may be rigid structures for generating solid three-<br>
dimensional structures with a defined shape or alternatively, scaffolds may be<br>
semi-solid matrices for generating flexible tissues.<br>
The methods and culture systems of the present invention include the use<br>
scaffolds made from polymers alone, copolymers, or blends thereof. The<br>
polymers may be biodegradable or biostable or combinations thereof. As used<br>
herein, "biodegradable" materials are those which contain bonds that may be<br>
cleaved under physiological conditions, including enzymatic or hydrolytic<br>
scission of the chemical bonds.<br>
Suitable natural polymers include, but are not limited to, polysaccharides<br>
such as alginate, cellulose, dextran, pullane, polyhyaluronic acid, chitin, poly(3-<br>
hydroxyalkanoate), poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) and poly(3-hydroxyfatty acid).<br>
Also contemplated within the invention are chemical derivatives of said natural<br>
polymers including substitutions and/or additions of chemical groups such as<br>
alkyl, alkylene, hydroxylations, oxidations, as well as other modifications<br>
familiar to those skilled in the art. The natural polymers may also be selected<br>
from proteins such as collagen, zein, casein, gelatin, gluten and serum albumen.<br>
Suitable synthetic polymers include, but are not limited to, polyphosphazenes,<br>
poly(vinyl alcohols), polyamides, polyester amides, poly(amino acids),<br>
polyanhydrides, polycarbonates, polyacrylates, polyalkylenes, polyalkylene<br>
glycols, polyalkylene oxides, polyalkylene terephthalates, polyortho esters,<br>
polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl esters, polyvinyl halides, polyesters, polylactides,<br>
polyglyxolides, polysiloxanes, polycaprolactones, polyhydroxybutrates,<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
polyurethanes, styrene isobutyl styrene block polymer (SIBS), and copolymers<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>
Biodegradable synthetic polymers are preferred and include, but are not<br>
limited to, poly a-hydroxy acids such as poly L-lactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic<br>
acid (PGA) and copolymers thereof (i.e., poly D,L-lactic co-glycolic acid<br>
(PLGA)), and hyaluronic acid. Poly a-hydroxy acids are approved by the FDA<br>
for human clinical use. It should be noted that certain polymers, including the<br>
polysaccharides and hyaluronic acid, are water soluble. When using water<br>
soluble polymers it is important to render these polymers partially water insoluble<br>
by chemical modification, for example, by use of a cross linker.<br>
One of the advantages of a biodegradable polymeric matrix is that<br>
angiogenic and other bioactive compounds can be incorporated directly into the<br>
matrix so that they are slowly released as the matrix degrades in vivo. As the cell-<br>
polymer structure is vascularized and the structure degrades, the cells will<br>
differentiate according to their inherent characteristics. Factors, including<br>
nutrients, growth factors, inducers of differentiation or de-differentiation (i.e.,<br>
causing differentiated cells to lose characteristics of differentiation and acquire<br>
characteristics such as proliferation and more general function), products of<br>
secretion, immunomodulators, inhibitors of inflammation, regression factors,<br>
biologically active compounds which enhance or allow ingrowth of the lymphatic<br>
network or nerve fibers, hyaluronic acid, and drugs, which are known to those<br>
skilled in the art and commercially available with instructions as to what<br>
constitutes an effective amount, from suppliers such as Collaborative Research,<br>
Sigma Chemical Co., vascular growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth<br>
factor (VEGF), EGF, and HB-EGF, could be incorporated into the matrix or<br>
provided in conjunction with the matrix. Similarly, polymers containing peptides<br>
such as the attachment peptide RGD (Arg-Gly-AsP) can be synthesized for use in<br>
forming matrices.<br>
Kits<br>
Kits are also provided in the present invention that combine electrical<br>
stimulators with biologically compatible scaffolds to support the growth and<br>
integration of cells into a unified tissue. Containers with built in electrodes may<br>
be provided with the kit and the electrodes may be made of a self-passivating<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
material or other conventional electrode materials. These kits may optionally<br>
include reagents such as growth media, and growth factors to promote integration<br>
of the cells with the scaffolds. Scaffolds included in the kit may be designed to<br>
have growth-promoting and adhesion molecules fixed to their surface. Such kits<br>
are optionally, packaged together with instructions on proper use and<br>
optimization.<br>
Cells may be provided with the kit in a preserved form with a protective<br>
material until such time that the cells are combined with other elements of the kit<br>
to produce an appropriate tissue. In one embodiment, cells are provided that are<br>
cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen or dessicated in the presence of a compound<br>
such as trehalose. Cells may be undifferentiated progenitor cells, including stem<br>
cells; pluripotent stem cells, multipotent stem cells or committed progenitors.<br>
Alternatively, terminally differentiated cells may also be used with these kits.<br>
Such kits may be designed to produce replacement tissue for use in any organ<br>
system such as, but not limited to bone, cartilage, muscle, kidney, liver, nervous<br>
system, lung, heart, vascular system etc.<br>
Cells may also be harvested Scorn a patient in need of treatment to<br>
engineer replacement tissue from the patient's own tissue. Use of the patient's<br>
own tissue provides a way to produce transplantation tissue with reduced<br>
complications associated with tissue rejection.<br>
In addition to purely electrical stimulation, a combination of electrical and<br>
mechanical stimulation in vitro may be found beneficial for some purposes.<br>
Mechanical stimulation may consist of tensile loading, compressive loading, or<br>
shear loading. Typical setups are shown in cross-section in Figures 8a through<br>
8e.<br>
In each case of loading, the test setup is built around a culture well or<br>
chamber 200 of any type familiar in the art, containing medium 202 and a layer<br>
of cells 204 typically attached to a bottom sheet or membrane 206 which may or<br>
not be a part of the rigid mechanical bottom 208 of the culture well. Electrodes<br>
210, of any useable metal as described inter alia but preferably of a self-<br>
protecting metal and more preferably of anodized niobium, are placed in chamber<br>
200 in such a way as to create relatively uniform current distribution throughout<br>
medium 202.<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
For tensile loading, membrane 206 forms an additional or "false" bottom<br>
in culture well or chamber 200 as shown in Figure 8a. Membrane 206 may be<br>
made from any suitably flexible and elastic material to which the cells will attach<br>
themselves, such as silicone rubber which has been plasma etched. Tube 212<br>
connects space 214 between membrane 206 and rigid chamber bottom 208 with<br>
an external pump or other source of steady or fluctuating pressure or vacuum<br>
216. The intermittent operation of pressure or vacuum source 216 causes<br>
membrane 206 to flex up and down, creating intermittent tension in the<br>
membrane and thus in cell layer 204 attached to it. Alternatively, source 216<br>
may apply little or no pressure across membrane 206 for an extended period,<br>
allowing cells 204 to colonize the membrane in its unstretched state, then apply a<br>
different pressure thereby stretching membrane 206, for example at a point in<br>
culture growth at which cells 204 have just reached confluence and established<br>
gap-junction contact.<br>
For compressive loading, culture well or chamber 200 is instead sealed<br>
with a cover 220 and connected to pressure source 216 directly as shown in<br>
Figure 8b. Source 216 creates a steady or fluctuating hydrostatic pressure in<br>
medium 202 which is thus applied directly to cell layer 204.<br>
As an alternative means for compressive loading, tube 212 and pressure<br>
source 216 are eliminated and chamber cover 220 takes the form of a movable<br>
piston through which steady or fluctuating pressure may be applied directly to<br>
medium 202 and thus to cells 204, as shown in Figure 8c.<br>
For shear loading, culture well 200 is connected to pressure source 216<br>
instead via two tubes 212a and 212b through which medium 202 is circulated, as<br>
shown in Figure 8d. This flow may be either constant in a single direction,<br>
intermittent, or oscillatory. Each tube is preferably equipped with baffles 220 to<br>
achieve more uniform flow, as generally indicated by arrow 222. Baffles 220<br>
may be made separate from electrodes 210 as shown, or alternatively the<br>
electrodes may be perforated or otherwise made discontinuous so as themselves<br>
to form baffles. The motion of medium 202 and its friction against cell layer 204<br>
generate the desired shear loading.<br>
As an alternative means for providing shear loading, tubes 212a and 212b<br>
and pressure source 216 are replaced with a moving impeller 230 which<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
maintains medium 202 in motion relative to cell layer 204 as generally indicated<br>
by arrow 232. Impeller 230 may take any of several forms, but may<br>
advantageously be of cylindrical form as shown in Figure 8e, where the rigid<br>
bottom 208 of chamber 200 approximates the same form and maintains a<br>
relatively uniform clearance from the impeller surface. Medium 202 is thereby<br>
swept continuously and at a steady speed over cells 204 simply by maintaining<br>
impeller 230 in rotation at a constant speed. Alternatively, changing the speed of<br>
impeller 230 will change the flow velocity and thus the level of shear loading.<br>
Electrodes 210 are not shown since they may take a variety of positions in this<br>
arrangement. Preferably, however, rigid cell floor 208 and impeller 230 are<br>
themselves made of suitable electrode metals, more preferably of self-protecting<br>
metals and most preferably of anodized niobium, and themselves function as the<br>
electrodes.<br>
Differential modulation of bone growth<br>
The waveforms of the present invention as described above are also useful<br>
in methods for promoting the growth and repair of bone tissue in vivo. As<br>
described above, stimulation with A-type waveforms promotes proliferation of<br>
cells. A-type waveforms also result in an increase in bone morphogenic proteins<br>
to promote differentiation. In one embodiment, an increase in BMP-2 and BMP-<br>
7 production is effected using A-type or to a lesser degree, B-type electrical<br>
signals. This effect is highly valuable and provides a method for enhancing the<br>
generation of sufficient tissue for proper tissue healing in vivo, or to creating<br>
tissue grafts. This signal is also valuable for providing sufficient cell mass for<br>
infiltration into a polymer scaffold for tissue engineering purposes. In another<br>
embodiment, as demonstrated by in vitro testing, stimulation in vivo provides<br>
proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts to increase the number of<br>
osteoblasts for mineralization. Such an increase in number of cells provides a<br>
method for filling in gaps or holes in developing or regenerating bone through<br>
electrical stimulation. Cells generated through proliferation induced by A-type<br>
waveforms may be used immediately, or preserved using conventional cell<br>
preservation methods until a future need arises.<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
Stimulation with B-type waveforms promotes proliferation to a small<br>
degree, and has actions different than A-type waveforms. Actions promoted by<br>
B-type waveforms include, but are not limited to mineralization, extracellular<br>
protein production, and matrix organization. The actions of B-type waveforms<br>
are also valuable and provide methods to enhance the mineralization step and<br>
ossification of new bone tissue. In one embodiment, developing or regenerating<br>
bone tissue is stimulated with B-type waveforms to enhance the rate of<br>
mineralization. It has been proposed that B-type waveforms may act through<br>
calcium/calmodulin pathways and also by stimulation of G-protein coupled<br>
receptors or mechanoreceptors on bone cells. (Bowler, Front Biosci, 1998,<br>
3:d769-780; Baribault et al, Mol Cell Biol, 2006, 26(2):709-717). As such,<br>
methods are also provided to modulate the activity of calcium/calmodulin-<br>
mediated actions as well as G protein coupled receptors and mechanoreceptors<br>
using electrical stimulation. Modulation of these cellular pathways and receptors<br>
are valuable to promote the growth and repair of bone tissue in vitro or in vivo.<br>
Stimulation with C-type waveforms promotes bone regeneration,<br>
maturation and calcification. These waveforms are also valuable and provide<br>
methods to enhance the mineralization step and ossification of new bone tissue.<br>
Stimulation using D-type waveforms promotes cartilage development and<br>
healing and bone calcification, and is useful for treating or reversing osteoporosis<br>
and osteoarthritis. Applications of these waveforms include in vivo applications<br>
such as repairing damaged cartilage, increasing bone density in patients with<br>
osteoporosis as well as in vitro applications relating to the tissue engineering of<br>
cartilage for example.<br>
Methods are also provided for combination or sequential use of the<br>
waveforms described herein for the development of a treatment regime to effect<br>
specific biological results on developing or regenerating osteochondral tissue.<br>
In one embodiment, fractures in patients with a bone disorder may be<br>
treated with signals to heal fractures and then strengthen the bone. As a non-<br>
limiting example of this embodiment, an osteoporotic patient with a fracture may<br>
be treated by first stimulating with an A-type signal to promote proliferation and<br>
release of growth factors and then a B-type waveform to promote an increase in<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
bone density at the site of repair to increase bone mass density and prevent<br>
refracture.<br>
In another embodiment, combining two or more types of waveforms<br>
described herein may be used to promote the sequential proliferation,<br>
differentiation and mineralization of osteochondral tissues. As a non-limiting<br>
example of this embodiment, a culture of osteoblasts may be grown under the<br>
influence of a A-type signal in connection with or prior to connection with a<br>
polymeric matrix. After seeding the polymeric matrix, B-type signals are then<br>
administered to the cell-matrix construct to promote mineralization of a construct<br>
useful as a bone graft.<br>
In a third embodiment, two or more signals may be administered<br>
simultaneously to promote concomitant proliferation, differentiation and<br>
mineralization of osteochondral tissue in vivo or in vitro. Different signals may<br>
also be applied sequentially to osteochondral tissue in order to yield a greater<br>
effect than delivering either signal alone. The sequential process may be repeated<br>
as needed to produce additional tissue (such as bone) by cycling through the two-<br>
step process enough times to obtain the desired biological effect. As a specific<br>
non-limiting example, A-type signals may be applied first to produce more bone<br>
cells by proliferation and then B-type signals may be applied to induce the larger<br>
number of bone cells to produce more bone tissue (matrix, mineral and<br>
organization) and then repeated if needed. The amount of bone produced using<br>
repetition of a sequential stimulation protocol would be greater than that<br>
produced by either signal alone or in combination.<br>
Progenitor cell stimulation<br>
The methods and waveforms described herein may be applied to<br>
undifferentiated precursor cells to promote proliferation and/or differentiation<br>
into committed lineages. Such progenitor cells may include, but are not limited<br>
to, stem cells, uncommitted progenitors, committed progenitor cells, multipotent<br>
progenitors, pluripotent progenitors or cells at other stages of differentiation.<br>
Also included are specifically osteoblasts and chondroblasts. In one<br>
embodiment, multipotent adult stem cells (mesenchymal stem cells or bone<br>
marrow stem cells) are stimulated with A-type signals in vitro to promote<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
proliferation and differentiation of the multipotent adult stem cells into specific<br>
pathways such as bone, connective tissues, fat etc. Combination or sequential<br>
administration with both signals is "also contemplated for progenitor cell<br>
stimulation as previously described.<br>
Alternatively, the waveforms and methods described herein may also be<br>
applied to multipotent adult stem cells (mesenchymal stem cells or bone marrow<br>
stem cells) in vivo to stimulate cells with A-type signals to promote proliferation<br>
and differentiation of the multipotent adult stem cells into specific pathways such<br>
as bone, connective tissues, fat etc. Combination or sequential administration<br>
with both signals is also contemplated.<br>
Electrical stimulation of progenitor cells may also be accompanied by<br>
proliferation and differentiation factors known to promote proliferation or<br>
differentiation of progenitor cells. Proliferation factors include any compound<br>
with mitogenic actions on cells. Such proliferation factors may include, but are<br>
not limited to bFGF, EGF, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, IGF-I, and the<br>
like. Differentiation factors include any compound with differentiating actions<br>
on cells. Such differentiation factors may include, but are not limited to retinoic<br>
acid, BMP-2, BMP-7 and the like.<br>
The electrical waveforms described herein provide differential and<br>
combination modulation on the growth and development of osteochondral tissue<br>
in vitro or in vivo. Increasing the proliferation of cells with A-type signals before<br>
mineralization increases the number of bone cells and therefore provides an<br>
increase in the subsequent mineralization effected by stimulation with B-type<br>
signals. The waveforms of the present invention also promote proliferation and<br>
differentiation of progenitor cells through the release of nitric oxide and bone<br>
morphogenic proteins.<br>
Capacitive coupling<br>
Stimulation of in vitro and in vivo preparations is often difficult with self-<br>
passivating metals because it is difficult to obtain electrical connections between<br>
metals. The present invention provides methods of obtaining the benefits of<br>
using self-passivating metal electrodes without problems associated with<br>
obtaining solid electrical connections. Capacitive coupling of these electrodes<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
provides a method to induce direct current through the self-passivating metal<br>
electrode circumventing the need for any electrical connection. In this method<br>
electrodes made from self-passivating metals such as niobium, tantalum,<br>
titanium, zirconium, molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium, aluminum and<br>
stainless steels are sterilized and placed in close proximity to a population of cells<br>
to be stimulated. Circuit wires are placed within close proximity to' the metal<br>
electrodes in a conductive medium such as saline solution and electrical signals<br>
are transmitted through the circuit wires with current being capacitively coupled<br>
from the wire through the saline and, the oxide layer into the self-passivating<br>
metal electrode to thereby stimulate the cell population. In one embodiment,<br>
capacitive coupling stimulation is used for in vitro applications such as, but not<br>
limited to, cell culture. One culture dish may be stimulated using this method or<br>
several culture dishes or wells may be linked together for uniform electrical<br>
stimulation.<br>
In another embodiment, capacitive coupling stimulation is used for in vivo<br>
applications where a sterile anodized metal electrode is implanted into a patient<br>
in need of treatment and the circuit wires are placed outside the patient in contact<br>
with the skin to induce a current in the implanted metal electrode for an effective<br>
amount of time to promote repair or growth of a tissue. For example, the outer<br>
end of the electrode may form a flat coil just beneath the skin and the signal may<br>
be coupled into it using a conventional skin contact electrode, placed on the skin<br>
directly over this coil. Portions of the capacitivley coupled electrode from which<br>
close capacitive coupling to tissues is not desired may be covered with any<br>
insulating material suitable for use in implanted circuits, as is well known in the<br>
art, thus minimizing signal loss and undesired stimulation of tissues not being<br>
treated. In a specific example such as bone repair, a sterile anodized metal<br>
electrode made from a self-passivating metal is implanted into a patient in need<br>
of treatment and stimulated. After a sufficient period of time for repair of the<br>
bone, the electrode may be removed from the patient.<br>
Increase BMP expression<br>
The present invention further includes methods and apparatuses that use<br>
A-type and B-type waveforms for promoting the expression and release of bone<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
morphogenic proteins (BMPs) from stimulated cells. The electrical signals<br>
described herein may be used to cause the release of BMPs at levels sufficient to<br>
induce a benefit to the tissues exposed to the signals. Benefit may occur in<br>
tissues not directly exposed to the signals.<br>
BMPs are polypeptides involved in osteoinduction. They are members of<br>
the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily with the exception of the BMP-<br>
1. At least 20 BMPs have been identified and studied to date, but only BMP 2, 4<br>
and 7 have been able in vitro to stimulate the entire process of stem cell<br>
differentiation into osteoblastic mature cells. Current research is trying to<br>
develop methods to deliver BMPs for orthopedic tissue regeneration.<br>
(Seeherman, Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005 Jun;16(3):329-45). Methods are<br>
provided herein to induce the release of BMPs in vitro or in vivo for orthopedic<br>
tissue regeneration through electrical stimulation instead of through delivery of<br>
exogenous BMPs in technically demanding and costly delivery methods.<br>
In one embodiment, A-type and to a lesser degree, B-type waveforms are<br>
used to induce expression and release of endogenous BMPs. Release of<br>
endogenous BMPs promotes the growth and differentiation of target tissues.<br>
Placement of stimulation electrodes provides a way to target BMP expression to<br>
localized areas of an in vitro preparation or in vivo in a patient in need of<br>
increased BMP expression. In one embodiment, BMP-2 or BMP-7 or<br>
combinations thereof are released endogenously to effect differentiation and<br>
growth of target tissue. In a specific embodiment, release of either or both of<br>
BMP-2 and BMP-7 promotes differentiation, mineralization, protein production<br>
and matrix organization in bone or cartilage tissue.<br>
Stimulation of bone, cartilage or other connective tissue cells by nitric oxide<br>
The methods and electrical signals described herein may also be used to<br>
promote repair and growth of bone, cartilage or other connective tissues. In one<br>
embodiment, a B-type waveform increases the growth of cells through the release<br>
of nitric oxide (NO). The waveforms may cause the release of nitric oxide at<br>
levels sufficient to induce a benefit to the tissues exposed to the signals. Benefit<br>
may occur in tissues not directly exposed to the signals. Bone, cartilage, or other<br>
connective tissue cell growth may be increased further by co-administration of an<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
NO donor in combination with the electrical stimulation. NO donors include but<br>
are not limited to sodium nitroprusside (SNP), SIN-1, SNAP, DEA/NO and<br>
SPER/NO. Bone, cartilage, or other connective tissue cell growth may be<br>
reduced by co-administering an NO synthase inhibitor in combination with the<br>
' electrical stimulation. Such NO synthase inhibitors include but are not limited to<br>
N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-<br>
NMMA), and 7-Nitroindazole (7-NI). Using these methods, bone, cartilage, or<br>
other connective tissue cell growth may be modulated depending on specific<br>
needs.<br>
Application of the Apparatus and Methods of the Present Invention<br>
By using the apparatus and methods of the present invention as described<br>
herein, the apparatus and methods are effective in promoting the growth,<br>
differentiation, development and mineralization of osteochondral tissue.<br>
The apparatus is believed to operate directly at the treatment site by<br>
enhancing the release of chemical factors such as cytokines which are involved in<br>
cellular responses to various physiological conditions. This results in increased<br>
blood flow and inhibits further inflammation at the treatment site, thereby enhancing<br>
the body's inherent healing processes.<br>
The present invention is especially used in accelerating healing of simple or<br>
complex (multiple or comminuted) bone fractures including, but not limited to,<br>
bones sawed or broken during surgery. The present invention can be used to<br>
promote fusion of vertebrae after spinal fusion surgery.<br>
The present invention may be used to treat nonunion fractures; treat, prevent<br>
or reverse osteoporosis; treat, prevent or reverse osteopenia; treat, prevent or reverse<br>
osteonecrosis; retard or reverse formation of woven bone (callus, bone spurs), retard<br>
or reverse bone calcium loss in prolonged bed rest, retard or reverse bone calcium<br>
loss in microgravity. In addition, the present invention may be used to increase local<br>
blood circulation, increase blood flow to areas of traumatic injury, increase blood<br>
flow to areas of chronic skin ulcers and to modulate blood clotting.<br>
One of the areas where the present invention can also be used is to accelerate<br>
the healing of damaged or torn cartilage. Also, the present invention can be used to<br>
accelerate the healing (epithelialization) of skin wounds or ulcers.<br>
The present invention may further be used to accelerate growth of cultured<br>
cells or tissues, modulate cell proliferation, modulate cell differentiation, modulate<br>
cell cycle progression, modulate the expression of transforming growth factors,<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
modulate the expression of bone morphogenetic proteins, modulate the expression of<br>
cartilage growth factors, modulate the expression of insulin-like growth factors,<br>
modulate the expression of fibroblast growth factors, modulate the expression of<br>
tumor necrosis factors, modulate the expression of interleukines and modulate the<br>
expression of cytokines.<br>
The methods and apparatuses, of the present invention are farther illustrated<br>
by the following non-limiting examples. Resort may be had to various other<br>
embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the<br>
description herein, may suggest themselves to those skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the spirit of the present invention and/or the scope of the appended<br>
claims.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Effect of PEMF Signal configuration on Mineralization and Morphology in a<br>
Primary Osteoblast Culture<br>
The goal of this study was to compare two PEMF waveform<br>
configurations delivered with capacitative coupling by evaluating biochemical<br>
and morphologic variations in a primary bone cell culture.<br>
Methods<br>
Osteoblast cell culture: Primary human osteoblasts (CAMBREXÂ®,<br>
Walkersville, MD) were expanded to 75% confluence, and plated at a density of<br>
50,000 cells/ml directly into the LAB-TEKâ¢ (NALGE NUNC<br>
INTERNATIONALâ¢, Rochester, NY) chambers described previously. Cultures<br>
were supported initially with basic osteoblast media without differentiation<br>
factors. When the cultures reached 70% confluence within the chambers, media<br>
was supplemented with hydrocortisone-21-hemisuccinate (200mM final<br>
concentration), P-glycerophosphate (10mM final concentration), and ascorbic<br>
acid. Osteoblasts were incubated in humidified air at 37Â°C, 5% CO2, 95% air for<br>
up 21 days. Media was changed every two days for the course of the experiment,<br>
4 ml supplementing each chamber.<br>
Electrical Stimulation: Cultures were stimulated for either 30 minutes or<br>
for 2 hours twice per day. Two electrical signal regimens were selectively applied<br>
to the cells, one a continuous waveform indicated as "Signal A" (60/28<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
positive/negative signal duration in usec), and the other a continuous waveform<br>
indicated as "Signal B" (200/28 positive/negative signal duration in usec).<br>
Intensity was measured in sample runs as 2.4 mV/cm (peak to peak). Non-<br>
stimulated osteoblasts (NC) were plated at identical densities (as controls) in a<br>
similar manner. The following were measured using procedures in Detailed<br>
Methods: alkaline phosphatase, calcium, osteocalcin, and histology. Each of the<br>
following graphs are keyed to the "A" signal, the "B" signal, 30-minutes duration<br>
as "1", 2-hours duration as "2", and NC (or confluence) as no current (i.e. Al<br>
would be A signal - 30 minutes; B2 would be B - 2 hours).<br>
The electrical device used herein enables the application of continuous<br>
waveform, electrical stimulation to multiple explants simultaneously. For each<br>
experiment, 6 pairs of explants were placed into individual wells in 4 ml of<br>
culture medium. Control specimens were cultured in similar conditions, the only<br>
difference being the lack of signal delivered. The present test configuration<br>
consisted of six test culture wells (17 x 42 mm) connected in series via a coiled<br>
section of niobium wire.<br>
Human osteoblast cells were established in LAB-TEKâ¢ II slide wells<br>
(NALGE NUNC INTERNATIONALâ¢, Rochester, NY), each with a surface<br>
area of about 10 cm2. Signals were applied to several chambers simultaneously<br>
by connecting them in serial via niobium wires which acted as a couple<br>
capacitance. The stimulus was either a 9 msec burst of 200/28 Âµsec bipolar<br>
rectangular pulses repeating at 15/sec, delivering 9mV/cm (similar to the standard<br>
clinical bone healing signal), designated Signal B, or a 48 msec burst of 60/28<br>
Âµsec essentially unipolar pulses delivering 4 mV/cm, designated Signal A.<br>
Cultures received either a 30-minutes or a 2-hour stimulus twice a day. Samples<br>
were taken from the media and analyzed at 7, 14, and 21 day time points for<br>
alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, matrix calcium and histology. Mineralization<br>
accompanying morphology was confirmed with Von Kossa stain. All<br>
biochemical analyses were performed by conventional assay techniques.<br>

(R&amp;D SYSTEMSâ¢, Minneapolis MN;. INVITROGEN, INC.â¢, Carlsbad, CA).<br>
Results are expressed as pg/mg of tissue per 24 hours (ÂµM/g/24hrs).<br>
Alkaline Phosphatase (AP): At the time points indicated in the study<br>
design, cells were lysed (Mammalian-PE, Genotech, St. Louis, MO) and the<br>
supernatant collected. Alkaline phosphatase was measured by the cleavage of<br>
para-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) to nitrophenyl (PNP) under basic conditions<br>
in the presence of magnesium. The end product PNP is colorimetric with an<br>
obsorption peak at 405 nanometers. Basic conditions were achieved using 0.5 M<br>
carbonate buffer at pH 10.3. Culture media was assayed directly for ALP<br>
activity. Cell layer ALP was extracted with a solution of triton X-100 and an<br>
aliquot measured for ALP activity. Alkaline Phosphatase was measured in both<br>
the supernatant and in the membrane following lysis buffer extraction (Figure 5).<br>
As expected from other studies (Lohman, 2003), alkaline phosphatase expression<br>
peaked near 7 days in the membrane. In the cells cultured under the "B" stimulus<br>
however, culture media continued to demonstrate an increase in measurable AP.<br>
Osteocalcin: Osteocalcin (5800 daltons) is a specific product of the<br>
osteoblast. A small amount of osteocalcin is released directly into the circulation;<br>
it is primarily deposited into the bone matrix. Studies have shown that<br>
osteocalcin circulates both as the intact (1-49) protein and as N-terminal<br>
fragments. The major N-terminal fragment is the peptide (1-43). A Mid-Tact<br>
Osteocalcin Elisa Kit was selected for its high specificity. The assay is highly<br>
sensitive (0.5ng/ml) and required only a 25 microliter sample. Standards run<br>
simultaneously with our experimental groups offered a strong correlation to the<br>
expected values provided by BTI manufacturers (BTI, Stoughton, MA).<br>
Osteocalcin deposition, measured subsequent to quenching the cultures and<br>
determined from the matrix component, was more pronounced following the "B"<br>
stimulus and highest at 21 days (Figure 6).<br>
DNA content: Cell layer was extracted with 0.1 N sodium hydroxide and<br>
an aliquot assayed for DNA content using CyQuant assay kit (INVITROGEN,<br>
INC.â¢, Carlsbad, CA,). For cell samples extracted for ALP content with triton<br>
X-100 the extract was adjusted to 0.1N sodium hydroxide using 1 N sodium<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
hydroxide. Standard curves contain matching buffer. For samples also requiring<br>
protein content an aliquot was measured for protein using dye binding method<br>
(Bradford).<br>
Calcium: Calcium was determined by Schwarzenbach methodology with<br>
o-cresolphthalein complexone, which forms a violet colored complex. By adding<br>
2 ml of 0.5 M acetic acid overnight, calcium was dissolved and content was<br>
quantified against standards by colorimetric assay at 552 nm (CORE<br>
LABORATORY SUPPLIESâ¢, Canton, MI).<br>
Calcium Distribution in the culture was also assessed by histology. Cells<br>
were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, washed with cacodylate buffer, washed with<br>
PBS and then hydrated for staining as indicated. Each time period was run in<br>
tandem; representative morphology is presented for 21 days, comparing the "A"<br>
signal, with the "B" signal, and comparing both signals to the control (Figure 6).<br>
For signal B, the most striking observation was in the distribution of the calcium<br>
with an apparent preferential alignment that we interpreted as a "pseudo-<br>
cancellous" bone. For signal A, there appeared to be qualitatively more cell<br>
proliferation and less matrix production than signal B (however, signal A clearly<br>
had more matrix than with controls).<br>
Osteometric analysis was developed and modified from the methodology<br>
of Croucher. In this two dimensional chamber system, mean trabecular area<br>
relative to total area of the grid sampled was studied. Using minimum of 20 fields<br>
from two chambers at each intensity, the study examined bone formation, osteoid<br>
width, and cell number. Random specific grids were developed for direct<br>
comparison and to remove bias. Additionally, osteoblast cultures in both<br>
stimulated and control chambers was stained directly by VonKossa method<br>
(Mallory, 1961) to examine histology and qualify the distribution of calcium<br>
within the cultures.<br>
Conclusion<br>
Alkaline phosphatase, which rose to a peak near the 10-14 day level and<br>
then gradually subsided, was increased in the supernatant stimulated by Signal B.<br>
Osteocalcin deposition , measured subsequent to quenching the cultures and<br>
determined from the matrix component, was more pronounced following Signal<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
B only and increased to its highest point at 21 days. Matrix calcium measured in<br>
mg/dl, and matrix calcium as a function of the area of the tissue culture plate<br>
were greatest with Signal B only Mineral distribution as noted by histology and<br>
Von Kossa staining validated the biochemical data from the assays. The B<br>
stimulus conferred a greater amount of mineral, and moreover suggested a<br>
reticulated 2-dimensional pattern that.may offer analogous tension' dynamics as<br>
would be expected in a 3-D trabecular array. Cell proliferation appeared<br>
qualitatively higher with Signal A vs control, whereas significantly increased<br>
mineralization and pattern was apparent at 21 days with Signal B.<br>
That the two signal configuration produced very different effects is<br>
readily explainable by a signal to noise ratio (SNR) analysis which showed the<br>
detectability of signal B was 10X higher than signal A, assuming a Ca/CaM<br>
target. This study demonstrates for the first time that PEMF has the potential to<br>
effect structural changed resonant with tissue morphology. The geometric pattern<br>
apparent at 21 days of culture, mirrored the trabecular reticulation consonant with<br>
cancellous bone and starkly contrasted the random orientation of the cells in both<br>
the control and the cultures exposed to signal A at all time points evaluated.<br>
Such outcomes suggest that preferred signal configurations can effect structural<br>
hierarchies that previously were confined to tissue-level observations.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Use of a Niobium "Salt" Bridge for In Vitro PEMF stimulation<br>
Introduction<br>
A passive electrode system using anodized niobium wire was developed<br>
to couple time-varying electric signals into culture chambers. The intent of the<br>
design was to reduce complexity and improve reproducibility by replacing<br>
conventional electrolyte bridge technology for delivery of PEMF-type signals,<br>
such as those induced in tissue by the EBI repetitive pulse burst bone grown<br>
stimulator, capacitively rather than inductively, in vitro for cellular, tissue<br>
studies. Anodized niobium wire is readily available and requires only simple<br>
hand tools to form the electrode bridge. At usable frequencies, typically between<br>
5 Hz and 3 MHz, DC current passage is negligible.<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
Background<br>
Capacitively-coupled electric fields have typically been introduced to<br>
culture media with conventional electrolyte salt bridges which have limited<br>
frequency response and are difficult to use without risk of contamination for<br>
extended exposure times. Niobium (columbium) is one of several metals which<br>
are self-passivating, forming thin but very durable surface oxide layers when<br>
exposed to oxygen or moisture. Others are tantalum, titanium, and to a much<br>
lesser degree, stainless steels. The process can be accelerated and controlled by<br>
anodization. A problem with self-passivation is that it makes reliable connection<br>
with other metals difficult. The present design avoids that difficulty.<br>
Materials and Methods.<br>
Niobium oxide, Nb2O5, is hard, transparent, electrically insulating and<br>
inert to water, common reagents and biological fluids over a wide pH range.<br>
Anodizing niobium forms Nb2O5 with uniform thickness, showing a range of<br>
vivid light-interference colors valued for jewelry since no dye is added, and<br>
yields stable and reproducible capacitances. Jeweler's niobium is sold in<br>
standard colors each representing a different oxide thickness. Since the dielectric<br>
contact of Nb2O5 is unusually high (ÎR= 41Î0) and the layers are thin (48-70 nm),<br>
their capacitances are surprisingly large. "Purple" niobium has the thinnest oxide<br>
and highest measures capacitance: 0.158 ÂµF/cm for 22-gauge wire (Rio Grande<br>
#638-240), near the calculated value for 48 nM oxide (420 nM peak reflectance).<br>
In water or physiological salines, cut wire ends and small flaws formed in<br>
bending quickly heal over with oxide, with no need for re-anodization.<br>
The Niobium bridge:<br>
In this application niobium oxide forms the only electrical contact with<br>
the medium and PEMF-type signals pass thought it capacitively. At signal levels<br>
below a few milliamperes, there is negligible electrolysis or pH change to cause<br>
artifacts. Multiple chambers may be joined in series, each receiving identical<br>
signals. Each niobium bridge is bent forming a sheet-like electrode at each end,<br>
with a typical capacitance of 0.56ÂµF. Placing electrode bridges at the ends of a<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
rectangular chamber creates nearly uniform current distribution and voltage<br>
gradients throughout the medium. Gradients measured in a typical setup of<br>
culture changer, electrodes and PEMF-type signal as was previously shown in<br>
Figure 4 and described in the accompanying text, show a mean variation of Â±3%,<br>
mainly near electrodes or where the medium varies significantly in depth. A<br>
chamber or several joined in series are energized through special niobium end<br>
bridges, each with its outer end coupled capacitively through saline to a silver<br>
strip electrode forming a connection terminal. This removes any need to connect<br>
niobium to itself or to any other metal. Current is controlled by a series limiting<br>
resistance Rlim. The resulting bandpass (Â±3dB of nominal) varies somewhat with<br>
Rlim but in a test setup ran from 5 Hz to 3 MHz, the highest frequency tried.<br>
PEMF-type signals can thus be delivered undistorted in vitro via capacitive<br>
coupling.<br>
Experimental:<br>
The utility of the niobium electrode bridge was tested on osteoblast and<br>
chondrocyte cultures using a B-type waveform as previously described. With<br>
this signal applied to OGMâ¢ osteoblast medium (CAMBREXÂ®, Walkersville,<br>
MD) without cells present, the measured pH after 24 hours was 8.29 compared<br>
with 8.27 in non-energized controls, suggesting negligible electrolysis. Absence<br>
of physiologically significant cytotoxicity was shown by robust proliferation of<br>
osteoblasts, differentiation and development of a cancellous bone-like structure<br>
over 21 days in OGMâ¢ using both A-type and B-type waveforms, After 30<br>
minute and 2 hour exposure for 21 days to the waveform in culture, cells and<br>
matrix were analyzed with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). No niobium could be<br>
detected. In other studies a B-type signal was applied to human cartilage cells<br>
(HCC) in culture medium containing 1% fetal calf serum for 96 hours. The B-<br>
type signal caused a 154% increase in cell number as measure by DNA content of<br>
cell lawyer, again showing no significant cytotoxicity. In a direct comparison<br>
between the capacitively coupled signal and an otherwise identical but<br>
electromagnetically coupled signal, each delivered 30 minutes daily for four<br>
days, measured increases in osteoblast number by DNA differed significantly<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
from controls (157% for niobium, 164% for EM coupled) but not from each<br>
other.<br>
Conclusions.<br>
A novel niobium electrode bridge has been developed to apply<br>
capacitively coupled PEMF-type signals to cells/tissues in culture. The bandpass<br>
of the niobium bridge is 5Hz to 3MHz, so PEMF-type signals like those used<br>
clinically for bone and wound repair pass without distortion. Unlike standard<br>
electrolyte bridge configurations , the niobium bridge provides uniform current<br>
density within the culture dish. Application for extended PEMF exposures shows<br>
no electrolysis or physiologically significant cytotoxicity.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Stimulation of cartilage cells using a capactively coupled PEMF signal<br>
Introduction<br>
A PEMF signal similar to that used clinically for bone repair is currently<br>
being tested for its ability to reduce pain in joints of arthritic patients. Of interest<br>
is whether this pain relief signal can also improve the underlying problem of<br>
impaired cartilage.<br>
Background<br>
Compared to drug therapies and biologies, PEMF based therapeutics offer<br>
a treatment that is easy to use, non-invasive, involves no foreign agent with<br>
potential side effects, and has zero clearance time. Issues with PEMF<br>
therapeutics include identifying responsive cells, elucidating a physical<br>
transduction site on a cell, and determining the biological mechanism of action<br>
that results in a cell response. The purpose of this study was to determine<br>
whether a specific PEMF signal currently being tested for pain relief<br>
(MEDRELIEFÂ®, Healthonics, Inc, GA) could stimulate cartilage cells in vitro and<br>
whether a biological mechanism of action could be unraveled.<br>
Methods<br>
Normal human cartilage cells (HCC; CAMBREXÂ®, Walkersville, MD)<br>
were plated in rectangular cell chambers in monolayer. PEMF application was<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
capacitively coupled through a niobium electrode bridge system which allowed a<br>
time varying current to flow uniformly through the chambers. A pulse-burst B-<br>
type signal as described herein is composed of a 10-msec burst of asymmetric<br>
rectangular pulses, 200/28 microseconds in width, repeated at 15 Hz. The PEMF<br>
signal was applied for 30 minutes per treatment, Cell growth was assessed by<br>
DNA content of the cell layer. Nitric oxide (NO) content of culture media was<br>
assessed by the Griess reaction using an assay kit from INVITROGEN INC.Â®<br>
(Carlsbad, CA). Results are expressed as micromoles of NO per cell number as<br>
assessed by DNA content of the cell layer.<br>
Results<br>
A PEMF signal applied at 400 micro-amperes, peak-to-peak, to HCC cells<br>
grown in cultured media containing 1% fetal calf serum, every 12 hours over a 96<br>
hour period resulted in increased cell growth of 153 Â± 22%, p
was conditioned culture media collected 24 hours after the first PEMF treatment<br>
shows and increase in NO of 196 Â± 14%, p
significant levels at 96 hours. Under similar conditions when SNP (an NO<br>
donor- sodium nitroprusside) was added to a final concentration of 3 micrograms/<br>
ml there was also an increase in NO at 24 hours (174 Â± 26%, p
increase in cell number at 96 hours (168 Â± 22%, p
treated controls. In a subsequent experiment the serum concentration was<br>
reduced to 0.1%, the PEMF applied at 40 microAmps once every 24 hours, and<br>
measurements taken after 72 hours. PEMF treatment increased NO content in<br>
conditioned culture media to 154 Â± 30%, 
treatment increased cell number and this cell response was attenuated by L-<br>
NAME (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor).<br>
Conclusion<br>
These results suggest that a PEMF signal currently being tested to reduce<br>
joint pain due to arthritis may also provide a benefit to cartilage. The data<br>
indicates human cartilage cells can respond to this signal with increased cell<br>
growth. Furthermore, a possible biologic mechanism of action for PEMF<br>
stimulated cartilage cell growth is through release of NO. A similar response of<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
cartilage calls to an NO-donor supports this hypothesis. Although not conclusive,<br>
the data suggest that increased cell growth following PEMF treatment is either<br>
mediated by NO, or that NO is a required step in the mechanism for PEMF to<br>
produce increased cell growth.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
PEMF stimulation of BMP production in a primary osteoblast culture:<br>
Dependence on signal configuration and exposure duration.<br>
Introduction<br>
As an adjunct to surgery in spine fusion, or for treatment of recalcitrant<br>
non-unions in long bones, PEMF has proven effective as a non-surgical<br>
therapeutic. Pilot work has demonstrated that osteoblasts respond differently to<br>
both signal configuration and duration. One key difference included a proclivity<br>
for depositing matrix in lieu of cell proliferation. Based on a proven efficacy of<br>
BMP in spine fusion and in non-unions, and on efforts demonstrating that BMP-2<br>
and BMP-4 are stimulated by PEMF (Bodamyali, 1998), our study focused on<br>
better understanding whether previous cell responses could be correlated with<br>
BMP regulation.<br>
Objective<br>
This study compared two PEMF waveform configurations delivered with<br>
capacitive coupling, correlating biochemical and morphologic variations in a<br>
primary bone cell culture with BMP regulation.<br>
Methodology<br>
Normal human osteoblast cells were established in 10 cm2 individual<br>
culture chambers. Signals were applied to several chambers simultaneously by<br>
connecting them in series via niobium wires which acted as a coupling<br>
capacitance. Stimuli consisted of a continuous train of either 60/28 microseconds<br>
rectangular, bipolar pulses designated as "signal A", or 200/28 microsecond<br>
rectangular, bipolar pulses designated as signal B, applying peak to peak electric<br>
fields of 1.2 mV/cm (in A) or 2.4 mV/cm (in B) uniformly to the cultures.<br>
Cultures were exposed for 30 minutes (1), or 2 hours (2), twice a day, yielding<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
groups Al, A2, Bl and B2 for comparison. Aliquots previously used for<br>
membrane protein determinations were analyzed for BMP protein by ELISA<br>
assay, and matrices previously used to determine calcium and interpret<br>
morphology were used to isolate RNA that was subsequently analyzed by a two-<br>
step reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using known and<br>
available sequence primers for (18s RNA) BMP-2 and BMP-7. Both the signal<br>
that stimulated proliferation and that which stimulated matrix deposition were<br>
analyzed for BMP regulation and protein translation. Samples from 7-, 14-, and<br>
21-day time points were used to assure identical comparisons for the assay.<br>
Results<br>
The chief outcomes of this experiment were sixfold; 1) BMP protein and<br>
mRNA for BMP were elevated in response to both stimuli, particularly that of the<br>
"A" signal; 2) the 30 minute stimulus delivered twice per day offered nearly 40-<br>
fold increase in BMP-2 expression at 21 days compared to the 2-hour treatment,<br>
with the majority of the gain achieved during the period between 14-21 days; 3)<br>
the 30-minute stimulus for the "A" signal provided a 15-fold increase in BMP-7<br>
expression, again almost entirely noted between the 14- and 21- day analyses; 4)<br>
only moderate increases in either BMP-2 or BMP-7 were seen with respect to the<br>
"B" signal; 5) this study provides the first evidence that BMP-7 expression is<br>
promoted by PEMF stimulation and 6) although the proliferation assessment was<br>
qualitative, the mitogenic nature of BMP deposition is in accord with previously<br>
published work. Work evaluating PEMF on a transformed cell line for short<br>
periods of time suggests that neither BMP-3 nor BMP-6 is stimulated (Yajima,<br>
1996). We did not evaluate our model with respect to these growth factors.<br>
Conclusion<br>
Given the body of work that has shown BMP-2 to have morphogenetic<br>
and mitogenic properties, the proliferation of the cells in response to the "A"<br>
signal is not surprising. That the two signal configurations produced very<br>
different effects is potentially explainable by a SNR analysis that suggest the<br>
dose of signal "B" can be 10x higher than signal "A" with the assumption of a<br>
Ca/CaM transduction pathway. Perhaps more unexpected was the normalized<br>
BMP-2 and BMP-7 levels despite the exaggerated matrix deposition afforded by<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2006/132855	PCT/US2006/020819<br>
the "B" signal. Bone formation is acutely dependent on a balance of growth<br>
factor and microtopography of the surface- in fact, the presence of a smooth<br>
surface overrides the cell response to BMP-2 and accentuates dystrophic<br>
mineralization. Given the high degree of matrix organization and deposition<br>
seen in response to the "B" signal, BMP transduction in and of itself seems<br>
insufficient for productive bone formation and may occur by a separate targeting<br>
mechanism.<br>

each day. The patient remained on the same medications, supplements and<br>
activity for a one year period. Follow up bone density scanning at 6 months and<br>
12 months, revealed a 16% and 29% increase in bone mass density.<br><br>

mode stimulation of cells with charge-balanced signals may be used. Bone, cartilage<br>
and other connective tissue growth is stimulated in part by nitric oxide release through<br>
electrical stimulation and may be modulated through co-administration of NO donors<br>
and NO synthase inhibitors. Bone, cartilage and other connective tissue growth is<br>
stimulated in part by release of BMP-2 and BMP-7 response to electrical stimulation to<br>
promote differentiation of cells. The methods and devices described are useful in<br>
promoting repair of bone fractures, cartilage and connective tissue repair as well as for<br>
engineering tissue for transplantation.<br></td>
