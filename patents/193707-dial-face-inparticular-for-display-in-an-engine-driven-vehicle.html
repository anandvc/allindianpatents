				<td>1A<br>
The invention comprises a dial face, in particular a display in an engine-driven	<br>
vehicle,with a flat base surface to which colours are applied to represent a scale and/or signs and/or symbols and to cover the areas outside the contours of the scale, signs or symbols.<br>
The method of creating coloured representations on such dials is known by which certain colours are applied at places where a scale, signs or symbols are to be represented and seen in the given colour. Such colour application is done by means of serigraphy and requires use of an ink in precisely the desired colour Since dial faces for displays in engine-driven vehicles usually require a number of colour applications, all of the various inks must be available in the different colours as required. The colour tones of the inks used for various displays are usually not identical, necessitating the warehousing of a large number of inks / colours and requiring considerable retooling when the dial faces to be printed are changed.<br>
The task to be solved by the invention is thus manufacture of a dial face that can be produced in a wide variety of colour tones by simple means<br><br>
2<br>
 The invention solves this task by having the colours of the scale and/or signs and/or symbols consist of a layered system of layers in different colours partly or completely superimposed over one another. This design makes it possible to obtain any colour tone desired on the basis of the primary colours by means of superimposed printing. Thus only the primary colours need be available, minimizing colour (ink) warehousing volumes. Retooling to change colours for different dial faces is no longer necessary.<br>
The flat dial base surface can be opaque - preferably coloured white -, transparent, translucent or translucent for a light source on the side facing away from the observer. The impinging light then reflected from the dial base or the light shining through the base shines through the superposed transparent colour layers, thus producing the desired colour tone by way of mixing.<br>
A particularly fine structure, facilitating very fine, smooth colour shade transitions, is achieved by applying the transparent colour layers in the layered system in a dot matrix to the dial base, whereby the dots of the matrix grid have a density of c. 400-3,000 dots per inch, in particular around 800 per inch. This produces a high-definition dot matrix such that the human eye does not see it as a grid, but rather as a homogeneous colour.<br>
The dots of the dot matrix may be either of the same size or of different sizes.<br><br>
3<br>
As an alternative to transparent layers of colour applied in a dot matrix, these transparent colour layers can also be applied as continuous fields of colour to the dial base, whereby the continuous colour fields should preferably correspond to the colours of the scale and/or signs and/or symbols.<br>
If the transparent colour layers of the layered system are coated on the observer side with a transflective colour layer, impinging light from the front renders visible the colour of the transflective colour layer and light transmitted through from the back of the dial face renders visible the colour of the transparent colour layers or a mixed shade comprising the transparent colour layers and the transflective layer.<br>
The preferred colour for the transflective colour layer in this system is white.<br>
If the transflective colour layer is spared in parts of the scale and/or signs and/or symbols and if, in the spared area, an additional system of transparent colour layers is applied to the dial base, the spared area appears in a different colour under direct (impinging) light than the sections covered by the transparent colour layer. This makes it possible to show a certain part, e.g. the end segment of a scale, for example in red, with the rest of the scale appearing in white<br>
To render the uneven distribution of light intensity from the light source illuminating the dial face from behind more uniform, a layer rendering the distribution of light uniform, corresponding to the light intensity distribution from the light source and covering the dial base partly or completely, can be applied to the dial base on the side of the first and/or additional layered system facing away from the observer<br><br>
4<br>
If in the above configuration the layer applied to render light distribution uniform comprises colour layers superimposed partially or wholly, applied either as a dot matrix or continuous colour of variable density, a fine structuring of this colour application is also able to produce smooth transitions in the layer applied to render light distribution uniform corresponding to the very finest differences in light intensity.<br>
The first layer system and/or the transflective layer and/or the additional layer system and/or the layer applied to render light distribution uniform may be applied to the dial base either on the side facing the observer or the side facing away from the observer. Applying all layers to the same side of the dial base simplifies print application of these layers.<br>
The dial base surface may consist of a foil, in particular made of polycarbonate.<br>
To enhance the adhesion of the colour layer to the base surface, in particular on the foil base surface, a bonding agent layer can be applied between the base surface and colour layer on the side of the base surface bearing a colour layer.<br>
The colour covering the sections outside the scale, sign or symbol contours may be a colour that is opaque to a great extent, in particular black. This raises the degree of contrast between the field of the display and the scale, signs or symbols, thus improving their legibility<br>
Each of the transparent colour layers of the first and/or additional layer system can be applied to the base surface in a separate printing step.<br><br>
5<br>
If the first and/or additional layer system is applied to the base surface as a separately produced layer system, these layer systems can be produced with a high degree of dimensional precision, avoiding register mark problems when printing on the base surface.<br>
The first layer system and/or the transflective layer and/or the additional layer system and/or the layer applied to render light distribution uniform and/or the opaque colour can be applied to the base surface in separate printing steps.<br>
A simplification of the printing procedure and enhancement of dimensional precision of the individual layers in relation to one another is achieved by applying the first layer system and/or the transflective layer and/or the additional layer system and/or the layer applied to render light distribution uniform and/or the opaque colour to the base surface as a separately produced layer system.<br>
The accompanying drawing shows exemplary configurations of the invention described in detail here:<br>
Figure 1	View of a dial face<br>
Figure 2	First exemplary configuration of a dial face segment in cross-section<br>
Figure 3	Second exemplary configuration of a dial face segment in cross-section<br>
Figure 4	Third exemplary configuration of a dial face segment in cross-section<br>
Figure 5	Fourth exemplary configuration of a dial face segment in cross-section<br><br>
6<br>
The dial face in figure 1 is a dial face for a display in an engine-driven vehicle featuring scale 1 with symbol for fuel tank filling level, a scale 2 for travelling speed, scale 3 for engine rpm and scale for with symbol for washing water filling level. There are also two flashing arrows to indicate turning direction 5 and a row of symbols with warning fields for battery, high-beam driving light and oil level.<br>
The exemplary configurations in figures 2-5 of dial face segments in cross-section show a base surface 7 consisting of a polycarbonate foil and transparent in figures 2-4 In figure 5, the base surface is shown in an opaque black version. Of course the base surfaces, in particular in figures 3 and 5, could also consist of a different material, e.g. paper or carton, either translucent or non-translucent.<br>
In figures 2-5, the first layer seen from the side of an observer of the display is a transparent anti-glare layer 8 with an irregularly structured surface followed by an opaque black colour layer 9 covering the entire base surface 7 except the scales and symbols. If the sides of the base surface facing the observer has an irregularly structured surface, the anti-glare layer 8 is not required.<br>
Colour layer 9 could also be slightly translucent. All that is necessary is that the contrast with the scales and symbols be sufficient.<br><br>
7<br>
In figures 2-4, at least in the areas of the scales and symbols, a further colour layer 10 is included which is transflective and preferably white.<br>
In further areas 12 of the scales and symbols in figures 2-4, a layer system 13 consisting of several transparent colour layers partly or wholly superimposed, such that when illuminated from the observer side (daylight, impinging light), area 11 of the scales and symbols appears white and area 12 of the scales and symbols appears in the mixed colour shade of the layer system 13 (e.g. red).<br>
The exemplary configurations of figures 2 and 4 show displays that can be illuminated for night operation by a light source 14 placed on the side not facing the observer.<br>
To have the areas 11 of the scales and symbols appear in a different colour during operation of the light source 14, e.g. green from the colour that appears when the light source 14 is not activated, an additional layer system 15 is located behind the first layer system 13 and consists of several partly or wholly superimposed transparent colour layers. Between this layer system 15 and the light source 14 there is a layer applied to render light distribution uniform 16, the light permeability of which is, for example, inversely proportional to the light intensity distribution of light source 14, such that light permeates the layer applied to render light distribution uniform 16 with the same intensity beyond the surface of the dial face.<br>
In addition to this, figure 2 shows the layer applied to render light distribution uniform 16 provided with a reflection layer 17 in the areas vis-a-vis the for the most part opaque colour layer 9, through which reflection layer the dispersed light exiting at areas 11 and 12 on the side not facing the observer in the dial base 7 is repeatedly<br><br>
8<br>
reflected to the observer side until its exits at areas 11 or 12 to the observer side. This prevents light leakage within the dial face to a great extent.<br>
Figure 5 shows a dial face for a display illuminated by impinging light coming from a source to the side of the observer This can be achieved by ambient light or a light source placed in front of the display.<br>
In area 11 of the scales and symbols, a layer system 13 consisting of several transparent colour layers, partly or wholly superimposed is located behind the opaque colour layer 9, the mixed shade from which is visible to the observer. Behind layer system 13 on base 7 there is a reflection layer 18, also located behind area 12 of the scales and symbols.<br>
The light hitting the dial face from the observer side enters and passes through areas 11 and 12 up to reflection layer 18, where it is reflected to the observer side Since the light in area 11 must pass through the transparent layer system 13, this area appears in the mixed shade of layer system 13 with the reflected light. Area 12, on the other hand, appears in the colour in which the light is reflected from the reflection layer.<br>
Both layer systems 13 and 15 and the additional colour layers 9 and 10 as well as the layer applied to render light distribution uniform 16 and, if relevant, reflection layers 17 and 18 comprise several partly or wholly superimposed transparent colour layers with either the same or differing colours, applied to the base 7 in the form of a dot matrix or continuous colour field. The colours of these layers are produced in a simple manner by using the primary colours yellow, magenta, cyan and black as well<br><br>
9<br>
as white, whereby each mixture of the primary colours visible to the observer results from light penetrating through the layer system. Thus any colour shade can be produced on the basis of these primary colours without having to prepare a colour application (ink) especially for each colour. These colours are supplemented by the white surfaces and the colour white. Of course a premixed colour could also be used.<br>
A digital process can be used to print the dial face simply, with a high level of precision and minimum time required<br><br>
