				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new dopamine D3 and D2 receptor subtype<br>
preferring ligands of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers<br>
and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates and/or<br>
polymorphs thereof. The invention also relates to processes for preparing the<br>
same, to compositions containing the same and to their use in the treatment<br>
and/or prevention of conditions which requires modulation of dopamine receptors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cyclohexane derivatives that are useful as therapeutics for the treatment of<br>
pain are described in International Patent Publication No. WO 99/67206.<br>
Compounds containing a cyclohexane, pyrimidine and piperazine ring are<br>
described in European Patent No. EP 431,580 and U.S. Patent No. 4,957,921.<br>
These compounds act as central nervous system agents and dopaminergic<br>
agents, respectively. These compounds, however, do not contain an alkyl-amino<br>
group in the 2-position of the pyrimidine ring. Dopamine D3 receptor modulator<br>
compounds containing a pyrimidine and piperazine ring are described in U.S.<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 2004/259882. These compounds do not,<br>
however, contain a cyclohexane ring.<br>
2-Amino-6-chloro-4-(N-methylpiperazino)pyrimidines as inhibitors of<br>
spiroperidol binding are described in, e.g., J. Med. Chem., 25, 1459, (1982).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that in contrast to the compounds described<br>
above, the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention have high or very<br>
high affinity for dopamine D3 receptors, and moderate to high affinity for dopamine<br>
D2 receptors always in such a combination that the D3 affinity is 5 to 50 fold higher<br>
than the D2 affinity. In addition, the compounds of the present invention show even<br>
higher selectivity over other receptors. For example, these compounds do not<br>
show affinity for alpha-1 adrenoceptors, i.e., their inhibitor constants (Ki) are<br>
higher or much higher than 1000 nM.<br><br>
The dual {i.e. D3 and D2) receptor functional antagonism coupled in the<br>
above mentioned particular proportion is especially important as it allows the<br>
simultaneous manifestation of the beneficial modulation of both D3 and D2<br>
receptors, however, without the appearance of the known disadvantages of each<br>
individual receptor action.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) will be referred to in this application as "D3/D2<br>
ligands".<br>
The present invention relates to new piperazine derivatives of formula (I):<br>
wherein<br>

and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts<br>
and/or hydrates and/or solvates and/or polymorphs thereof, to processes for<br>
preparing the same, to pharmacological compositions containing the same and to<br>
their use in the treatment and/or prevention of pathological conditions which<br>
require the modulation of dopamine receptors, such as, but not limited to,<br>
psychoses {e.g. schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorders), drug (e.g. alcohol,<br>
cocaine, nicotine, opioids) abuse, cognitive impairment accompanying<br>
schizophrenia, mild-to-moderate cognitive deficits, dementia, psychotic states<br>
associated with dementia, eating disorders (e.g. bulimia nervosa, etc.), attention<br>
deficit disorders, hyperactivity disorders, psychotic depression, mania, bipolar<br>
disorder, paranoid and delusional disorders, dyskinetic disorders (e.g. Parkinson's<br>
disease, neuroleptic induced parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia), depression and<br>
depressive states, anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunctions (eg. erectile<br>
dysfunctions), sleep disorders, emesis, aggression, autism and pain.<br>
The present invention also relates to compounds of formula (III):<br>
wherein<br>
R1 represents hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl group, and<br>
R2 represents hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl group.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present invention relates to compounds of formula (I):<br>
wherein<br>
Q represents C1-4 alkyl, -NR R , phenyl, optionally substituted phenyl, 1-<br>
pyrrolidinyl, 1-piperidinyl, 4-R5-piperazin-1-yl or 4-morpholinyl group;<br>
R1 represents hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl group;<br>
R2 represents hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl group;<br>
R3 represents hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl group, phenyl or optionally substituted<br>
phenyl;<br>
R4 represents hydrogen, C1-4alkyl group, phenyl or optionally substituted<br>
phenyl;<br>
R5 represents hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl group;<br>
and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates and/or<br>
polymorphs thereof.<br>
The term "optionally substituted phenyl" as used herein means a phenyl<br>
group which can be substituted in any position by one or more halogen, C1-4 alkyl,<br>
C1-4 alkoxy, trifluoromethyl and/or cyano group, or combinations thereof.<br>
The present invention also relates to salts of compounds of formula (I)<br>
formed with acids.<br><br>
Both organic and inorganic acids can be used for the formation of acid<br>
addition salts. Suitable inorganic acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric<br>
acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid. Representatives of monovalent<br>
organic acids include, but are not limited to, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic<br>
acid, and different butyric acids, valeric acids and capric acids. Representatives of<br>
bivalent organic acids include, but are not limited to, oxalic acid, malonic acid,<br>
maleic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid. Other organic acids can also be used,<br>
such as hydroxy acids, for example, citric acid, tartaric acid, or aromatic carboxylic<br>
acids, for example, benzoic acid or salicylic acid, as well as aliphatic and aromatic<br>
sulfonic acids, for example, methanesulfonic acid, naphtalenesulfonic acid and p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid. A preferred group of acid addition salts are those in which the<br>
acid component itself is physiologically acceptable and does not have a<br>
therapeutic effect in the applied dose and/or it does not have unfavourable<br>
influence on the effect of the active ingredient. These acid addition salts are<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Acid addition salts which are not<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be advantageous in the<br>
purification and isolation of the desired compounds of formula (I), and are<br>
therefore also included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Solvates and/or hydrates of compounds of formula (I), as well as solvates<br>
and/or hydrates of salts of compounds of formula (I) are also included within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that compounds of Formula I<br>
can exist in different tautomeric and geometrical isomeric forms. For example, the<br>
compounds of formula (I) exist in the form of cis and trans isomers with respect to<br>
the configuration of the cyclohexane ring. The compounds of present invention are<br>
preferably in the trans configuration. In addition, certain compounds of formula (I)<br>
can exist as stereoisomers and diastereomers. All of these compounds, including<br>
cis isomers, trans isomers, diastereomic mixtures, racemates, nonracemic<br>
mixtures of enantiomers, substantially pure, and pure enantiomers, are within the<br>
scope of the present invention. Substantially pure enantiomers contain no more<br>
than 5% w/w of the corresponding opposite enantiomer, preferably no more than<br>
2%, most preferably no more than 1%.<br><br>
The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racenmic nnixtures<br>
according to conventional processes, for example, by the formation of<br>
diastereoisomeric salts using an optically active acid or base or formation of<br>
covalent diastereomers. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric,<br>
diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid.<br>
Mixtures of diastereoisomers can be separated into their individual diastereomers<br>
on the basis of their physical and/or chemical differences by methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional<br>
crystallization. The optically active bases or acids are then liberated from the<br>
separated diastereomeric salts. A different process for separation of optical<br>
isomers involves the use of chiral chromatography (e.g., chiral HPLC columns),<br>
with or without conventional derivation, optimally chosen to maximize the<br>
separation of the enantiomers. Suitable chiral HPLC columns are manufactured<br>
by Diacel, e.g., Chiracel OD and Chiracel OJ among many others, all routinely<br>
selectable. Enzymatic separations, with or without derivitization, are also useful.<br>
The optically active compounds of formulas (I) can likewise be obtained by utilizing<br>
optically active starting materials in chiral synthesis processes under reaction<br>
conditions which do not cause racemization.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will also recognize that some of the<br>
compounds of formula (I) can exist in different polymorphic forms. As known in<br>
the art, polymorphism is an ability of a compound to crystallize as more than one<br>
distinct crystalline or "polymorphic" species. A polymorph is a solid crystalline<br>
phase of a compound with at least two different arrangements or polymorphic<br>
forms of that compound molecule in the solid state. Polymorphic forms of any<br>
given compound are defined by the same chemical formula or composition and<br>
are as distinct in chemical structure as crystalline structures of two different<br>
chemical compounds.<br>
As used herein in the present specification and claims a "compound of<br>
formula (I)" will be deemed to encompass both the free base and salts, e.g.,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, thereof.<br>
In certain embodiments, preferred compounds of the invention are those<br>
compounds of formula (I) wherein<br>
Q represents C1-4 alkyl, NR3R4 or 4-morpholinyi group,<br>
R1 represents hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl group;<br>
R2 represents hydrogen or C1-4alkyl group;<br>
R3 represents hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl group;<br>
R4 represents hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl group;<br>

Methods of Treatment<br>
The compounds of formula (I) of the present invention, in contrast to known<br>
antipsychotics, have been found to exhibit very high affinity for dopamine D3<br>
receptors, high-to-moderate affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and no affinity for<br>
adrenergic alpha-1 receptors. The compounds are expected to be useful in the<br>
treatment and/or prevention of disease states in which D3 and/or D2 receptors are<br>
involved in the disease pathology and thus their modulation is required, or in which<br>
modulation of D3 and/or D2 receptors exerts beneficial effect on the state and/or<br>
process of the disease.<br>
Dysfunction of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system is involved in the<br>
pathology of several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as<br>
schizophrenia, mania, bipolar disorders, drug abuse, dementia, cognitive<br>
dysfunctions, and Parkinson's disease. The effects of neurotransmitter dopamine<br>
is mediated via at least five distinct dopamine receptors belonging to D1- {i.e. D1<br>
and D5) or D2- (i e. D2, D3 and D4) families. D3 receptors have been shown to have<br>
characteristic distribution in the mammalian brain. Namely, they were found in high<br>
densities in certain limbic structures such as nucleus accumbens, olfactory<br>
tubercle and islands of Calleja. Therefore, preferential targeting of the D3<br>
receptors may be a promising approach for more selective modulation of certain<br>
dopaminergic functions and consequently offers successful therapeutic<br>
interventions in several abnormalities such as schizophrenia, emotional or<br>
cognitive dysfunctions (see, e.g., Sokoloff, P. et al.: Nature 1990, 347:146;<br>
Schwartz, J.C. et al.: Clin. Neuropharmacol. 1993, 16:295; Schwartz, J.C. et al.:<br>
Brain Res. Rev. 2000, 31:277; Levant, B.: Pharmacol, Rev. 1997, 49:231; Laszy,<br>
J. et al.: Psychopharmacol. 2005, 179:567), drug abuse (see, e.g., Piila, C. et al.:<br>
Nature 199, 400:371; Heidbreder, C.A. et al.: Brain Res. Rev. 2005, 49:77),<br>
Parkinson's disease (see, e.g., Levant, B. et al.: CNS Drugs 1999, 12:391; Joyce,<br>
J.N.: Pharmacol. Therap. 2001, 90:231; Bezard, E. et al.: Nature Medicine 2003,<br>
9:762) and pain (see, e.g., Levant, B. etal.: Neurosci. Lett. 2001, 303:9).<br>
The dopamine D2 receptors are widely distributed in the brain and are<br>
known to be involved in numerous physiological functions and pathological states.<br>
D2 antagonists are, for example, widely used as antipsychotics. However, it is also<br>
well known that massive antagonism of the D2 receptors leads to unwanted side<br>
effects, such as extrapyramidal motor symptoms, psychomotor sedation, cognitive<br>
blunting and endocrine alterations. These side effects seriously restrict the<br>
therapeutic utilization of D2 antagonist compounds (see, e.g., Wong, A.H.C. et al.:<br>
Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2003, 27:269.; Stahl, S.M. 2002, Essential<br>
Psychopharmacology. Neuroscientific Basis and Practical Applications. 2nd Ed.<br>
Cambridge University Press).<br>
Cardiovascular side effects (such as orthostatic hypotension associated<br>
with dizziness, tachycardia and sometimes syncope) of the first generation<br><br>
antipsychotics {e.g. chlorpromazine, thioridazine, chlorprothixene) and second<br>
generation antipsychotics (e.g. olanzapine, risperidone) are well documented (see,<br>
e.g., Pacher, P. and Kecskemeti, V.: Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004, 10:2463;<br>
.Brunton.L., Lazo, J. and Parker, K. (eds) Goodman and Oilman's The<br>
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th Edition, Mc Graw Hill, 2005, p.462.;<br>
Stahl, S.M. 2002, Essential Psychopharmacology. Neuroscientific Basis and<br>
Practical Applications. 2"" Ed. p. 409, Cambridge University Press, 2000;<br>
http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2006/Sep_Pls/RisperdalConsta_PI.pdf;<br>
http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2006/Aug_Pls/Zyprexa_PI.pdf). Side effects<br>
of this sort hamper or seriously limit the antipsychotic therapy especially in the<br>
initial period. All the above mentioned first and second generation antipsychotics<br>
show considerable {i.e. nanomolar) affinities to adrenergic alpha-1 receptors and it<br>
is a common view that the majority of their cardiovascular side effects are mainly<br>
related to their alpha-1 antagonist actions. Thus, the lack of adrenergic alpha-1<br>
activity is a highly desirable feature of a potential antipsychotic compound.<br>
The present invention provides novel compounds of formula (I) and/or<br>
geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or<br>
hydrates and/or solvates and/or polymorphs thereof which have high affinity for<br>
dopamine D3 receptors (Ki values less than 3 nM) and, simultaneously, have<br>
high-to-moderate affinity for dopamine D2 receptors (Ki values of 10 to 50 nM)<br>
always in a such combination that the D3 affinity is 5 to 50-times higher than the D2<br>
affinity. In addition, compounds of formula (I) have no affinity to adrenergic alpha-1<br>
receptors.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating<br>
conditions which require preferential modulation of dopamine D3 and/or D2<br>
receptors, such as, but not limited to, psychoses (e.g. schizophrenia, schizo-<br>
affective disorders), cognitive impairment accompanying schizophrenia, mild-to-<br>
moderate cognitive deficits, dementia, psychotic states associated with dementia,<br>
psychotic depression, mania, bipolar disorder, paranoid and delusional disorders,<br>
dyskinetic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic induced<br>
parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, eating disorders (e.g. bulimia nervosa), attention<br>
deficit disorders, hyperactivity disorders, depression and depressive states,<br><br>
anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunctions (e.g. erectile dysfunctions), sleep disorders,<br>
emesis, aggression, autism, drug (e.g. alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, opioids) abuse<br>
and pain, which comprises administering to a subject in need thereof an effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or<br>
stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates<br>
and/or polymorphs thereof.<br>
The invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (I) and/or<br>
geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or<br>
hydrates and/or solvates and/or polymorphs thereof in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of conditions which require modulation of dopamine<br>
receptors, especially dopamine D3 and/or D2 receptors.<br>
A preferred use for D3/D2 ligands according to the present invention is in the<br>
treatment of schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorders, cognitive impairment<br>
accompanying schizophrenia, mild-to-moderate cognitive deficits, dementia,<br>
psychotic states associated with dementia, psychotic depression, mania, bipolar<br>
disorder, paranoid and delusional disorders, dyskinetic disorders such as<br>
Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic induced parkinsonism, depression and<br>
depressive states, anxiety disorders, and drug abuse {e.g. cocaine abuse).<br>
The particular combination of the two receptor-actions described above<br>
allows the simultaneous manifestation of the beneficial actions of D3 functional<br>
antagonism (e.g. cognitive enhancer effect, inhibition of extrapyramidal motor<br>
symptoms, inhibitory action on drug abuse) and that of the D2 functional<br>
antagonism (e.g. antipsychotic effect). Furthermore, the same combination<br>
surprisingly results in cancelling out the disadvantageous features of D2<br>
antagonism (e.g. extrapyramidal symptoms, psychomotor sedation, cognitive<br>
disturbances).<br>

Biological Test Methods<br>
1. D3 receptor binding<br>
Binding assays were carried out on rat recombinant D3 receptors (Perkin-<br>
Elmer, Cat. No. 6110139) expressed in Sf9 cells using [^H]spiperone (0.44-1.49<br>
nM) as ligand and haloperidol (10 |jM) for determination of non-specific binding.<br>
The assay was performed according to the supplier's assay protocol (Cat.No.:<br>
3110139).<br>
2. D2 Receptor Binding<br>
D2 receptor binding was determined as described by Creese et al. {Eur. J.<br>
Pharmacol., 60:55-66, 1979) on rat brain striatal membrane preparation using<br>
[3H]spiperone (0.4-1.3 nM) as ligand. Non-specific binding was determined in the<br>
presence of 1 pM (+) butaclamol.<br>
3. Alpha-1 Receptor Binding<br>
Alpha-1 receptor binding studies were performed according to the methods<br>
described by Greengrass and Bremner {Eur. J. Pharmacol., 55:323-326, 1979) on<br>
rat cortical membrane preparation using [^H]-prazosine (0.22-0.37 nM) as ligand.<br>
The non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 pM phentolamine.<br>
4. Amphetamine-Induced Hypermotility<br>
One hour after the oral administration of doses of the test compound or<br>
vehicle, male Wistar rats were subcutaneously treated with d-amphetamine (0.5<br>
mg/kg, sc.) and were individually placed in activity cages for one hour. Locomotor<br>
activity was measured in a four-channel activity monitor equipped with infrared<br>
photobeams Horizontal movement was determined as the number of beam<br>
interruptions. Mean ± SE of horizontal activity data of each group was calculated.<br>
Percent inhibition of amphetamine-induced increase in locomotion was calculated<br>
for each dose of the tested compound. The ED-50 value was determined by linear<br>
regression fitted to the dose-response plot.<br>
5. Catalepsy Test<br>
Thirty minutes after the oral treatment with the test compounds male Wistar<br>
rats weighing 200-220 g (n=10/group) were placed in extra-ordinary position:<br>
placing both forepaws of the rat on a 10 cm high podium. Animals were<br>
considered to be cataleptic if they did not correct their body posture within 30 sec.<br>
The frequency of cataleptic animals was determined at one, two, three, four and<br>
five hours after the treatment. Minimum effective (cataleptic) dose was defined as<br>
the dose causing catalepsy at least at two readings (i.e. either at two time points in<br>
the same animal or in two different animals at any of the time points).<br>
6. Scopolamine-lnduced Learning Disturbance in the Water-Labyrinth<br>
The learning process of rats was assessed in a 3-choice point water-<br>
labyrinth system. The number of directional turning errors was recorded in three<br>
daily trials for three experimental days. Male Wistar rats weighing 180-200 g (n=10<br>
per groups) were treated orally with vehicle or the test compounds 1 hour before<br>
each daily session. Scopolamine (3 mg/kg ip.) as amnestic agent was injected 30<br>
minutes prior to the first daily trial. Mean ± SE of errors committed in all the trials<br>
was calculated in each group. Percent inhibition of scopolamine-induced increase<br>
in the number of errors was calculated for each dose of the tested compound.<br>
Dopamine D3 and D2 and adrenergic alpha-1 receptor binding data of<br>
selected compounds of the present invention are listed in Table 1. Ki (nM) data<br>
are given.<br>
Table 1.<br>
The most prominent side effects of the first generation antipsychotic<br>
compounds {e.g. chlorpromazine and haloperidol) and at higher doses even those<br>
of second generation (atypical) antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone) are the<br>
extrapyramidal symptoms such as pseudo-parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia<br>
and the orthostatic hypotension. The former two are the result of massive<br>
blockade of D2 receptors in the basal ganglia whereas the latter is the<br>
consequence of antagonism of alpha-1 receptors.<br><br>
As can be seen from Table 1, the compounds of the present invention are<br>
very highly potent ligands at D3 receptors (Ki values are less than 3 nM) and<br>
moderately potent ligands at dopamine D2 receptors (Ki values between 5 and 50<br>
nM) showing 5 to 50 fold selectivity for D3 over D2 receptors. Coupling the very<br>
high D3 affinity to the moderate D2 affinity in this particular proportion allows the<br>
beneficial {e.g. antipsychotic) actions of a D2 antagonist to be preserved, while at<br>
the same time, impeding (by the D3 effects) the appearance of the<br>
disadvantageous consequences of massive D2 receptor blockade, such as<br>
extrapyramidal symptoms or cognitive disturbances. It is therefore anticipated that<br>
no or greatly diminished adverse effects related to D2 receptors will occur in the<br>
course of therapeutical application of compounds of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, as well as favourably modulating the dopamine D2 receptor-<br>
mediated functions, action of the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention<br>
on dopamine D3 receptors will also result in additional therapeutically beneficial<br>
effects e.g. cognitive improvement, diminution of negative and depressive<br>
symptoms. In addition, the compounds have no affinity to adrenergic alpha-1<br>
receptors (Ki values are higher than 1000 nM for each compound) and thus have<br>
extremely high D3/alpha-1 selectivity. From the lack of affinity of the compounds to<br>
adrenergic alpha-1 receptors the lack of cardiovascular side effects {e.g.<br>
orthostatic hypotension and associated symptoms such as dizziness, tachycardia)<br>
is anticipated.<br>
The beneficial effects of the compounds of formula (I) of the present<br>
invention carrying the above described particular combination of D3 and D2<br>
receptor binding affinities were demonstrated in vivo, in methods used to measure<br>
antipsychotic effect (amphetamine hypermotility), cognitive enhancer activity<br>
(scopolamine-induced learning disturbance) and extrapyramidal side-effect<br>
(catalepsy test).The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3.<br>
Table 2<br>
Effects of compounds of formula (I) on amphetamine-Induced hypermotlllty<br>
and in the catalepsy test<br>
As can be seen from Table 2, compounds of formula (I) of the present<br>
invention have highly potent antipsychotic activity (inhibition of amphetamine-<br>
induced hypermotility) as can be predicted from their high to moderate dopamine<br>
D2 receptor affinities. With regard to cataleptogenic (i.e. extrapyramidal side<br>
effect-inducing) potential, compounds of formula (I) of the present invention are<br>
highly superior to the reference drugs olanzapine and risperidone both In absolute<br>
(MED) and relative (Tl) terms. Since olanzapine and risperidone show equal<br>
binding affinity to the D3 and D2 dopamine receptors (see Table 1) whereas<br>
compounds of formula (I) of the present invention preferably bind to the D3<br>
receptor (their D3 affinity is 5 to 50 fold higher than the D2 affinity) in such a way<br>
that they have high or very high affinity to dopamine D3 receptors and moderate to<br>
high affinity to dopamine D2 receptors, the results of Table 2 also demonstrate that<br>
such particular combination of D3 and D2 affinities indeed result in preservation of<br>
the beneficial antipsychotic action with simultaneous elimination of the<br>
disadvantageous extrapyramidal side-effect (catalepsy).<br>
Table 3<br>
Effects of compounds of formula (I) on scopolamlne-induced learning<br>
disturbance<br>
a: negative values mean further impairment in learning performance<br>
Data in Table 3 show that compounds of formula (I) of the present invention<br>
do exert cognitive enhancing effect (as evidenced by the considerable inhibition of<br>
the learning disrupting effect of scopolamine) in contrast to olanzapine and<br>
risperidone which further impaired rather than improved the learning performance<br>
of scopolamine treated animals. These findings demonstrate the beneficial effect<br>
of the very high to high D3 receptor affinity characteristic for the compounds of<br>
formula (I) of the present invention and also point to the importance of the<br>
particular 5 to 50-fold D3/D2 selectivity ratio possessed by these compounds. In<br>
the case of risperidone and olanzapine, compounds which showed equal affinity to<br>
the D3 and D2 receptors, the deleterious effect of D2 antagonism on learning<br>
overcame the beneficial cognitive action of D3 antagonism while in case of<br>
compounds of formula (I) of the present invention the 5 to 50-fold higher D3<br>
receptor affinity cancelled out the disadvantageous effect (cognitive disturbance in<br>
this case) of D2 antagonism.<br>
