BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.       Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a communication device to be used for communication between people, where the communication device has a simplified interface which may be limited to a keypad, light sources and audio capabilities.<br>
2.       Brief Description of Related Developments<br>
Communication devices or mobile phones are widely known In different shapes and fomis, and include deferent kinds of internees and fonctionalities. Known communication devices are in many aspects quite compticated for the user to operate since they require a level of understanding and abilities. New users, user lacking understanding, or those not having technical abififfes are in many cases shut out from using the communication devices since they have a complicated user interfece. E.g. people that not are able to read for some reason will have difficulties reading the display and what is shown on tbe display.<br>
Furthemiore, some users may be interested in providing cxxDwunication devices to other persons. The reason for this could be, for example, maintaining communication witti an elderly parent or a child that is starting to be out on his own, or in the case of an employee that an employer wants to contact or be contacted by. There could of course be many other reasons for a user to provide another person with a communication device, but one common aspect may be that the user having the interest may also be the main-subscriber or the person financially responsible for the communication devices that they are providing to others, for purposes of this invention, this<br><br>
person will be referred to as the responsible person. The responsible person therefore may have an interest in controlling or limiting the use of the communication devices provided to others, white enabling the others to get in contact with him/her in a simple way.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The claimed invention aims to provide a communication device with a user interface that is generally simple and operable. It further aims to provide a communication device that enables a responsibte person to supply others with a communication device and still have control over the communication device and the costs incurred by the use of it.<br>
It is a feature of the present Invention to pro\nde a communication device having a user interface enabling operation of the communication device t)y an inexperienced user, or a user lacking knowledge or abilities to operate previously kriown communication devices.<br>
According to one embodiment of the claimed invention this feature is provided by a communication device having voice playback capabilities and a limited keypad to communicate the state of the communication devk:e to the user.<br>
Another feature of the invention is to provide a method for operating a communicatJon device without using a conventional display in a manner that can give feedback to a user of the communication device.<br>
According to another embodiment of the claimed invention this feature Is provided by a method for operaUng a user interface of a communication devk^e that is provided with voice playback capabilities, where the voice playback capabilities enable at least the follovwng operations on the communication device:<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect, the invention wilt t&gt;e described with reference to a communication device. Figures 1-5 show different embodiments of the communication device of the present invention. As will be seen, the communication device in figure 6 is provided with a user intertace having a speaker 2 (only openings are shown), a keypad 3, a battery 4, a set of tight sources, for oxampie, a set of discrete LED's 5, a buzzer 19 and a microphone 6 (only openings are shown).<br>
T?)e keypad 3 has a first group of keys 7 designated as user.defirjed keys, by means of which the user can make telephone calls, send a text message (SMS), etc. The user-defined keys 7 are provided writh a different colour, size or otherwise unique appearance to differentiate between or among the user-defined keys.<br>
Ttie keypad 3 addftronalfy comprises two soft keys 8 and a navigation-key 9. The soft keys 8 are used for estabtishing a call or a conference call. terminating a call, refecting an incoming call, turning the communKStfon device on or off, or selecting items or functionalities in a navigation menu. associated with the user internee.<br>
The navigation-key 9 is an up/down key and is placed centrally on the front surface of the phone. A user may be able to control this key with his thumb. This may be an optimum site to place an input key requiring precise motor movements. Many experienced phone users may be used to one-hand handling or operations. The phone may be placed in the hand between the fingertips and the palm of the hand, freeing the thumb for inputting information.<br><br>
analog to dig'stai form in an A/D converter (not shown) before the speech is encoded in an audio part 10 which includes a digital signal processor. The encoded speech signal is ti-ansferred to a processor 11 which may be a physical layer processor and whirfi e.g. supports communication de^^ce software. The processor 11 also forms the interface to the peripheral temiinals of the apparatus. Including RAM and ROM hiemories 12 and 13, a , SIM card 14, a set of light sources, for example, a set of discrete LED's 20/21 and the keypad 3 (figure 6) as well as a data terminal, power supply, etc ^not shown). The pnacessor 11 confavte the communicatfon wfth the network via the transmitter/receiver circuit 15 and an antenna 16. The audio part 10 speech-decodes the signal, which is transferred from the processor 11 to the speaker 2 via a D/A converter (not shown).<br>
The processor 11 is connected via a bus 17 or other electncal connecfing means to a RAM memory 12 and a Flash ROM memory 13, a SIM-card 14, the LEO'S 20/21 and the keypad 3 (as well as a data terminal, power supply, etc, not shown). Furfrtermore a phonebook 18 is connected to the processor 11 via the bus 17. The phonebook 18 may be stored on the SIM card 1'4, and/or in the Ffastx ROiW memory 12.<br>
One embodiment of the communicatfon device of the inventlofi is adapted for use in connection with a GSM network, but, of course, the invention may<br><br>
also be applied in connection with other communication terminal networte, for example, cellular networks, various forms of cordless communication terminai systems, or dual band communication tenninals accessing sets of these systems/networks.<br>
The communicatior) device may initially l&gt;e in an idle mode, vvhiOt means that the communication terminal may be turned on and ready to be used for any possible operalion. The communication device may be turned on or off by a long-press of one of the soft-keys 8. When turned on, the communication device may flash one or more discrete light sources, for example, LED's 20 to indicate ttiat the communication device in switched on. This flashing may be unique so as not be conftised with other indications.<br>
As described above ta connection wiUi ^gure 6, the communtcatton device is provided with a number of Tight sources or LED's 5. The LED's 5 are arranged to support the operation of the communication de\^ce. In the preferred embodiment shown in figure 6 are a fiist group of LED's 20 which may be airanged tike a hatf circle in relation to the two soft keys 8 and the navigation-key 9, and a second group of LED's 21 which may be arranged in relation to the  user-defined keys 7.  Depending of the status of the communk;at(on device, the different groups of LED's 20 and 21 may indicate different things. The first groups of LED's 20 that are disposed around the two soft keys 8 and the navigation-key 9 may Indicate the battery charging level and the strength of the network signal when the communication device is in the ready to operate mode. The left four LED's 20 may indicate the strength of the network signal, where the weakest network signal is indicated by only one LED 20 flashing, the LED's 20 most to the right of the four left LED's 20 or the bottom of the hatf-ctrde. and Bie strongest network signal is indicated by having the four left LED's 20 flashing.  Likewise, the four right LED's 20 may be used to indicate the battery charging level, where<br><br>
the lowest battery charging level signal is indicated by only one LED 20 flashing, the LED 20 most to the left of the four right LED's 20 or the bottom of the hatf-circle, and the highest battery charging level is indicated by the four right LED's 20 flashing. The LED's 5 are associated with the user interfece to indicate different states of the communication device.<br>
Since the embodiment shown in figure 6 does not include a convanBonal display to show the user the operation, the combination of the LED's 5 and voice playback capability may be used to guide the user in the operation of the communication device. A first example of this Is to scroll the phonebook of the communication device, where the user presses the left soMey 8 to enter the phoneboolc. This will flash the LED 20 Ajrthest io the (eft and the number/person entry allocat&amp;i to that position will be played on speater to the user By using the navigation-key 9 the user will foe able to scroll to other positions in the phonetx)ok, where anotiier LED's 20 will be flashing and voice-playback will indicate the number/person entry allocated to the spedTic position, in one embodiment, the enfry positrons availabfe In the phonebook may be limited by the number of LED's 20.   (n other embodiments, there may t&gt;e more or less LED's 20 in the communication device and the numbw of available speed dial numbers may con-espond.to the numtwr of LED's 20. One or more of the user defined keys 7 may be designated a .favourite key 7A and may also be used for allocating phone numbers fiiom the phonebook. A favourite key 7A may be defined so that a simple press on the corresponding key will initiate the set-up of the phone call to a phone having the number allocated to that key 7.  Typically the numtier allocated to the favourite key 7 may be supplied by the responsible person of the communication device whereas the user can more freely decide other phone, numbers. One way to allocate the numbers is simply locate the numbers on the first eleven positions on the SIM  card  14 associated v^th the communication device. Other ways of allocating numbers will be described<br>
8<br><br>
later. There is a timeout in this mode where the LED's 20 start to flash and the speed dial selection is switched off to save the battery.<br>
When making a phone call using any of the favourite keys 7A, the LED's 21 placed in relation to the corresponding favourite key may flash. Likewise the LED's 21 will flash when receiving calls (e.g. fast flashing) from a favourite key number, and the LED's 21 may also be used when the user has a missed call from one of the favourite numfaere {slow flashing). The favourite key 7A can further be used for sending a short message that indicates to another person that the user wants to be called up, a "Call Me" message. Th&amp; communication device has the ability to easily send "Call Me" messages to numbers associated to the favourite k^ 7A. To send a "Call Me" message to one of the favourites numbers, the user simply long-presses the corresponding favourite key 7A. tn one embodiment, it may only be possible to send "Call Me" messages to the numbers associated with favourite keys 7A and not to any number in the phonebook or other phone numbers. The "Call Me" message is typk?ally a pre-defined short message that indicates that the user want to be called up by the person associated to the '^vourlte key 7A. The favourite keys 7A may be divided into kinds, for example, a primary speed-diat key ('Master* key) and secondary speed-dial keys, They may differ m their physical appearance, where primary speed-dial key ^pically may be bigger than two secondary speed-^Jial keys. They may of course  differ in other ways as well,  e.g.  colour or shape.  Another functionality is that the user can assign a Voice tag' for each of the speed dial or favourite keys 7k. This coukl be used to gh^ voice playback capabilify to the user when he/she is calling the speed dial numbers, i.e. when the user then presses any of the speed dial keys 7, the user will immediately hear in the earpiece/speaker 2 the recorded 'rmne' for the person or other indication of the number being called. Another way of setting up calls can be using voice recognition, where the user i^v&amp; sritsr&amp;ci as<br><br>
voice tag for each speed dial key and possibly for each other number in the phonebook. The voice caHing can be initiated by pressing the left soft-key 8 as the user normally does when he want to use a name from the phonebook, where after the user says the name or other word associated to the number and the communication device sets up the call.<br>
An ongoing call is Indicated by e.g. flashing a\] LSD's 20 and 21 ev^ry second. The speaker/earpiece 2 volume can be adjusted during the call with the navigation-key 9. Scrolling down decreases the volurhe and scrolling up increases the volume. The present volume level will be indicated witii flashing LED's 20, where a single flashing LED 20 indicates a tow votume level and where eight flashing LED's 20 indicates that the maximum volume level is selected. The volume level is shown for a few seconds with the LED's 20 before a timer turns them off, The user presses the right soft-key B to end an active/ongoing call.<br>
if the user presses the navigation-key 9 from idle mode tfie menu structure will be available, the cunenfly active/highKghted menu in the structure is indicated by flashing one of the LED's 20, typically the most left or right LED 20, and the voice play-back capability will prompt the name of the menu. To select a menu, the user simply presses the \^ soft-tey 8. Whenever the user presses the navigation-key 9, the communication device will 'prompt* the corresponding menu and the con-esponding LED 20 will be updated. The method of also using the LED's 20 for indicating the current menu can allow users who have 'learned' the menu structure to operate basfc functions even without voice prompts. Sub-menus may also contain spoken 'chotees', which the user then can scroll and select; just like the 'main menu. To exit ttie menu structure, the user can press the right soft-key 8.<br>
In the shown embodiment the communication device is provided with eight LED's 20, which limit the number of menus on &amp;acti level, T^e number of<br>
fo<br><br>
LED'S 20 can of course be different within the scope of the invention and not limited to just eight LED's 20. The voice/speech prompts are used to give various feedback to the end user, e.g. when scrolling the menu system supported in the communication device. The voice prompts are pre-recorded and are outputted through the earpiece/speaker 2.<br>
In the menu structure there typically can be the following different menus and sub-menus:<br>
•	Ksypad Lock<br>
•	Ringing volume<br>
•	Change ringing tone<br>
•	Show Battery and signal level status<br>
•	Read out operator name<br>
•	Indicate if Roaming<br>
•	Changing   Language  (defeult  language  will  be  based  on  SIM nationality)<br>
•	Calling Line Identification dependent ringing tones set-up<br>
•	Reception of new ringing tones OTA via smart message + assign<br>
•	Recordabie ringing tone<br>
•	Simple alarm feature/count down; Maybe with pj^efined 'dela/ which can be 'multiplied*<br>
•	To-do list based on multiple voice memos<br>
//<br><br>
•	Time read aloud / tower clock beeps (Requires NITS or manual tim&amp; entry)<br>
•	Date read aioud<br>
•	Voice skfns; let phone talk with different voices<br>
•	Restore factoiv settings.<br>
•	Presence indication for Favourites<br>
•	Erase all SMS and/or SMS auto-erase on/off<br>
The content of the menus can of course be different, likewise can the number of menus be different within the scope of the invention.<br>
To avoid any undesired calf set-up when the communication device is tumed-on and in an idle state the keypad 3 can be locked or made non-responsive to unintentional key-press by the user. Keypad can be activated and de&gt;acfjvated by pressing two keys at the same time OR by pressing two keys after eadi other, e.g. pressing the left soft-key S and another key. The indication of keypad locked status of the communk^ation device could be indicated by flashing ALL LED's when any key is pressed (except for left soft-key 8). If it is chosen to unlock the keypad 3 with a key cornbinatton (e.g. left soft-key 8 and favourite key/primary speed-dial key 7A), the user could get help with LED's when unlocking keys; When (efl soft-key 8 is pressed, the LED 21 behind the primary speed-dial key will be flashing to indkrate, which key to press next The key-Jock is aiso provided with a time¬out that requires that the two key-presses need to be done within a certain time or the timer will be reset<br>
The user can answer any incoming call by pressing the left soft-key 8 or if the incoming caft is from one of the favourTtes, the caJf can also be answered<br>
/Z<br><br>
by pressing the corresponding favourites key 7A, e.g. the Master-key. An incoming call can be answered even when keypad is locked, An incoming call is indicated by playing ringing tone and by flashing the LED's 20 and 21 by a flashing pattern or just by flashing al( the LED's 20 and 21. There will typically be a distinct tone for each of the 3 main speed dial number plus a 'generic' one for all other numbers in the phonobook. The flashing of (he LED's 20 and 21 assures that an incoming call is indicated even though the communication device has been set to silent. In case a call is received from one of the fevourites the corresponding LED 21 for that favourite is also lit or flashing. Pressing the right soft-key 3 can reject any incoming call. The ringing volume can be adjusted during incoming calls by simply press the navigation-key 9 up/down during &amp;n incoming call. Pressing dovm decreases the ringing volume level and pressing up increases the ringing volume level. The LED's 20 indicates the ringing volume level. No flashing LED's 20 means silent and eight flashing LED's 20 means maximum ringing volume ievef. Whenever adjusting the ringing volume will be stored and used for all future calls or until ringing volume is adjusted again. As said the LED's 20 wilt show Che current ringing level and a timer turn offs ttie LEO's 20 after a certain timeout. The user can also adjust the ringing volume vja the (voice) menu system.<br>
A waiting call fe indicated with a 'beep' in the speaker/earpiece 2, The LED's 20 and 21 can also be used to indicate a waiting call. To answer a vt^iting call, the user can answer/swap the call by pressing the (eft soft-key 8; in this case two calls will then be active at the same time. The User can swap between the calls with the left sofl-key 8 and end the acdVe-caK with the right soft-key 8, When a call is waiting the user can also £^o
iS<br><br>
Finally, the user can of course ignore the waiting call. The missed call will be Indicated as a 'normal' missed call to the user.<br>
The assignment of the numbere to the favourite keys 7A can be done In several ways. As mentioned above can it be done with autonassigning the first three entries from SIM card 14(and/or the three names fhsm SIM Called with the names '1*. '2' and '3'); this allows setting up the numbere in a normal phone, or by a dealer or an operator. If FDN (Fixed Dialling Number) is active, the first 3 FDN numbers can be used. Manual input by; e.g. very-long-pressing a favourite key 7A and then using any of the "manual" (voice or keypad driven) number input methods. Another method is the "Over-The-Air^, OTA method using a special smart message/busings card format ftat is send to the communication device and accepted by the user upon arrival. The number sent by OTA can be spoken to ttie user by the voice playback capability or perhaps using the LED's 20 and 21, Yet another method is Call Line identification (CLl), where the user assign the last received number to any of the favourites, e.g, by very-long-pressing ttie con^ponding key 7,<br>
A missed call from a favourite/speed dial is Indicated by flashing the LED 21 for the corresponding favourite key 7A. This flashing will continue until the user has called the person associated to that speed dial key 7 or until the communication device has been switched off and then on. The user may be able to see whether there are 2 or more missed calls from the person. The user may also see if there are missed calls from any of other speed dial numbers in the pfionsbook since the corresponding LED 20 wiH flasf'i.<br>
Missed calls from persons other ^an the ones stored on the Speed dial keys (favourites or tfie phonebook) can be indteated with LED's 20 or/and21, e.g. a certain pattern is run and user can 'hear* the number spoken from the menu. Possibly this missed call may be used or added to the phonebook and may be used for speed dial. Another possibility is to have an option to get Voice prompts' for all numbers that are mfesed calls or having a 'DTMF<br>
V4-<br><br>
tone playing' option for all missed calls and using this method together with a fixed line phone, the user can 'automatically' dial the numbers back. The user can use the last received or missed call by pressing the right soft-key 8 twice. It might also be possible to scroU down in a menu or sub-menu to find the last received or missed call and to cad back to the person associated with that number.<br>
Using the communication device for calling any number over and above the eleven speed dial options, corresponding to the number of favourite keys and LED's 20, is not obvious since the communication device does not have any numerical keys that can be used for input of the phone number or other numbers. The other numbers that need to be entered can e;g. be a pin code that are used according to the GSM specificatiDn to activate the SIM can! 13, Below is shown a couple of methods to enter numbers on a communication device not having numerical ksys.<br>
The number input methods have in common that a menu or mode need to be activated, whk;h is done as shown above with pressing the natation-key 3 and using the left soft-key 3 to setect the desired Iceypad digit Input mode or menu after being prompt by voice play-back. A first mettiod utilises the scroll-keys to scroll digits one by one; whenever tfw user scrolls dowi or up, the next/previous digit is 'spolcen' as *voice play-back". The user can selects a digit by pressing the left soft-key 8. To dial the number, the user presses the left soft-key 8 once more after entering the last digit. The second method is simitar to the first method but using LED's to indicate, which digit that is highlighted. The eight LED's 20 can indicate the numbers 1to 8 from left to right and having the LED's 21 allocated to the secondary speed dial keys to indicate 0 and 9. Other solutions are of course possible. The third rriethod is based on mapping digit groups to each of the keys (including (he navigation-key 9 and the favourites keys 7A); e.g. 1-3 to-scroll up, 4-6 to scroll down, 7-9 to first favourites keys, etc, The user can then<br>

'guess' what is being typed in without voice playback. An option with voice playback of the entire number coutd of course be a possible option. The fourth method Is based on 'colour combinations', in other words based on pressing two of the (coloured) fevourite keys 7A consecutively, The favourite keys 7A need in this method to be coloured differently This method farther requires a smaN leaflet wt»fch explains what key different combinations will give, e.g.: Yetlow-Yellow gives "1', Blue-Blue gives '2', Yellow-Blue for '3' etc. See figures 9 and 10 for an example of colour coding and a simple number combination using the colour codes. This method could even be ext&amp;cided (wfth 3 key-presses) to also cover (Ladn) text input A fffth method can be voice Input, where the user say the desired numbers In a sequence and confrmis the number with the left soft-key 8.<br>
tn summary can ttie left soft-key 8 be used to answer calls, cat! one of the phonebook speed dials, selecting (voice) menus (Yes) and from idle mode is tiie left soft-key 8 used to enter selecfion of phonebook speed dials. The right soft-key 8 is used to power on/off the communication device, used to reject incoming calls, used to 'exif menus and e.g. other 'modes'. The navigation^ey 9 is used to control volume, adjusting ringing tone volume, and for scrolling voice menus and other 'lists' (e.g. the phonebook speed diais). The primary speed dial key links to the most used speed dial numb&amp;r. Short-press to dial the number associated to the speed dial key. Long-press to send 'Call me' message to the speed dial number. The secondary speed dials keys (2) links to contains two other speed dial number and are used In same way as the primaty speed dial key. The eight LED's 20 -can be maybe divkJed into two groups with each 4 LED's 20. These LED's 20 are used for multiple purposes, e.g. for indicating progress ('running'), for indroating 'errors' and status (flashing in various ways), as 'scroll bars' in the voice menu and for indicating levels (battery/signal).<br>
f£<br><br>
Please note that the LED's 20 and 21 can be flashing in different ways to show different tt^ings to the user. This cati be done by using different colours and flashing patterns. The examples given in the application are only examples and can of course be changed within the scope of the invention.<br>
The invention is not limited to the above-described examples or to the drawings showing examples of an embodiment, but can be varied within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
