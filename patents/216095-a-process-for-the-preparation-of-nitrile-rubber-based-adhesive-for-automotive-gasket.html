				<td>This invention relates to the process for the preparation of "Nitrite rubber based adhesive. Particularly this invention relates to the preparation of nitrite rubber adhesive which can bond surfaces of tin and asbestos, for making automotive gaskets.<br>
The nitrite phenolic contact adhesives are therefore, used in a wide variety of structural and non structural applications. The most important property of nitrite rubbers is their resistance towards the petroleum oils. This property increased as the acrylonitrile content of the co-polymer is increased. The increase in acrylonitirle content also improves its compatability with phenolic resins. The phenolic resins so chosen, functions as viscosity stabiliser, tackifier and also as a cross linking resin with the unsaturation and carboxyl groups of the nitrite rubber and these impart good strength, durability and heat resistance. The strength of such a structural bond depends not only upon the adhesive but also on the processing conditions such as heat cure schedule. The ratio of phenolic resin to nitrite rubber may be varied over a broad range and this ratio determines the property of the adhesive.<br>
The literature on nitrite - phenolic contact adhesives is available in the form of patents and also technical articles as shown below:<br>
M.H.Pintell   U.S.P.2,711,380 (1955) R.J.Reid   U.S.P.   2,514,222 (1950) HAHusseyand O.D.Wright U.S.P. 2,653,884 (1953) A.W.Bethune SAMPE.J 11(3) 4 (1975)<br>
These patents have described nitrite - phenolic contact adhesives especially useful for bonding rubber and other materials and are normaly termed<br><br>
as non-structural adhesives, due to the fact that the bonds strengths developed are not significant. These nitrile - phenolic contact adhesive bonds are not resistant towards ketonic solvents, and also at the same time the curing temperatures were of about the order of 250°C for over a long period of 30 minutes. Therefore, the present invention provides the preparation of nitrile rubber based adhesives for manufacture of gaskets required for automobiles which exhibit excellent resistance towards ketonic solvents. The curing temperatures are reduced drastically to the order of 180 - 200°C for much lower durations such as 20 minutes.<br>
A principal novel feature of the compositions of the present invention is that the methylol groups of phenolic resin react with the unsaturation present in the nitrile rubbers and thereby giving a chroman type of ring structure and also in some cases it reacts with the carboxy group present in the nitrile rubber, giving a wide variety of cross linked structures responsible for the excellent bonding properties. These adhesive compositions give bonds with high peel strength and impact resistance. These properties are particularly useful in bonding the tin surfaces and asbestos surfaces to give high quality gaskets for automobiles.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a formulation for the preparation of nitrile rubber based<br>
exhibits excellent resistance towards hydrocarbons, ketonic solvents;   and also<br>
esjstance towards the antifreeze solutions.    These properties are must for aking a successful and high performance gasket adhesive.    All the raw V materials used may be of commercial grade.<br>
adhesive for the automobiles which/<br><br>
The process of invention is described here under:<br>
The nitrile rubber having medium to high percentage (15 - 35%) acrylonitrile was milled over twin roll rubber mill while incorporating the additives such as stearic acid, sulphur, zinc oxide in it. The phenolic resin which is used as tackifier in this invention is a novolac resin compounded with hexamine to an extent of 6-15%.<br>
The major advantage of this type of novolac resins is that no water of reaction is evolved during the cure with hexamine. The amount of hexamine in the high end of this range is used where optimum hot strength is required. The molecular weights of phenolic novolac resin used in this investigation are in the range of 500 - 900. The milled rubber sheets were then cut into small pieces and were added into a stainless steel vertical churner and then dissolved in a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and methylisobutylketone, mixed solvents. Seperately, phenolic resin was dissolved in methylethylketone and this solution was then added to the vertical reactor. The adhesive is then discharged and stored in the metal containers.<br>
To evaluate the bond strength of the adhesive, the adhesive was applied by K-coater on both the tin plate and the asbestos sheet of 5cm x 5cm size producing a thickness of approximately 0.03mm. The composites were then prepared by pressing both the surfaces in a hydraulic press. These are termed as wet laminated composites. In the other set of composites, the gummed surfaces of tin and asbestos were dried at 130°C for 15 - 20 sec. and then laminated in the hydraulic press. These laminates are termed as heat reactivated laminates.<br><br>
These laminates were then cured for 10 - 30 min. at temperatures ranging from 150°C - 230°C in a hot air oven. The samples were then tested for their resistance to methylethylketone by immersing the composite panels for 2 h. in this solvent. The bond strength was estimated by driving a 2.5cm wide stainless steel spatula at 45°C from the interface of the joint as hard as possible while preventing the bowing of the spatula. The percent amount of asbestos facing remaining on the tin surface was assessed visually. This test was also conducted on series of samples after immersion in wateranti freeze mixture at 90°C for 24 h.<br>
In another test, the resistivity of the cured neoprene rubber with phenolic resin adhesive on tin surface was tested for the fluid resistance in fluids such as methylethylketone and the antifreeze solutions. The tests were conducted on previously solvent degreased tin plates of 100mm x 25mm size, dried and preweighed before the application of the adhesive. The tin plates were then coated with this adhesive to give a thickness of approximately 0.03mm. After air drying for 30 min., the tin plates were baked at temperatures ranging from 150°C -230°C for 5-30 min. The tin plates were then weighed to give the weight of the adhesive applied on them. The adhesive coated tin plates were then placed in a soxhlet extraction apparatus and extracted with methylethylketone for 5 h. The tin plates were then removed, dried and were re-weighed. The percentage adhesive remained on the tin plates was then estimated.<br>
Similar test pieces were prepared using stainless steel panels instead of tin panels for water - anti freeze 1:1 mixture resistance test as the anti freeze mixture effects the tin plates. The samples were dipped in boiling anti freeze -water mixture for 5 h. in this test.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of nitrile rubber based adhesive for automotive gasket which comprises:<br>
i milling of nitrile rubber having 15-35% acrylonitrile content as herein described with additive of softening agent ranging 0-1% , vulcanizing agent as sulphur ranging 0-3% and lubricating metal oxide ranging 0-3% such as herein described in a twin roll shear mill;<br>
ii. dissolving the milled mixture of rubber and ingredients obtained in step i) in a mixture of solvent of methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone and the ratio of the said solvents being in the range of 1:1 to 2:1 and the ratio of said rubber mixture and that of the solvent being kept ranging 1:4 to 1:6.5 , stirring the said mixture in a vertical churner /reactor at 60-70 rpm , temperature ranging 30-35°C for a period ranging 6-8 hours to get a homogenous solution ; iii. adding a solution of about 23%w/v of phenolic resin of novolac type containing hexamine ranging 6-15% in methyl ethyl ketone to the homogenous mixture as obtained in step ii) and further stirring the mixture solution for a period of about 1 hour;<br>
iv. adding antioxidant such as herein described to the homogenous mixture as obtained in step iii) and the concentration of antioxidant addition being in the range of o.l to 0.2 of the weight of total phenolic resin added in step iii) to obtain the nitrile rubber based adhesive ; characterized in that the adhesive contains 52-60% nitrile rubber and 40-47% of phenolic resin.<br><br>
