				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of molybdemum disilicide (MoSi2) - reaction bonded silicon carbide (RBSC) composite useful as a structural ceramic material.<br>
In the process of the present invention, synthesis of this duplex non-oxide ceramic is made using infiltration of a melt of alloyed molybdenum (Mo) and silicon (Si) into a porous compact of commercial silicon carbide (SiC) powder together with carbon at high temperatures, which leads to the reaction of silicon (Si) with both carbon (C) and molybdenum (Mo) resulting in the formation of silicon carbide ( SiC ) and molybdenum disilicide ( MoSi2 ) . The novelty of the present invention is that unlike other alloyed melt infiltration technique, the alloyed melt in the present case is not made of the ceramic compounds, but it is prepared directly from elemental source of raw materials. In the process of present invention of MoSi2 reinforced RBSC composite, elemental Mo and Si are used to prepare the infiltrating alloyed melt.<br>
The duplex non-oxide ceramic made of MoSi2 reinforced RBSC, hereinafter designated as MoSi2-RBSC, shows excellent physico-chemical properties like, high oxidation, corrosion and thermal shock resistance, superb high temperature strength and toughness together with other related properties, e.g., Young's modulus, hardness, etc., and therefore, is of great technological importance. . These properties can be exploited during the applications of the material in the fields of kiln furniture particularly for heating sanitary wares, saggers, crucibles, for calcining fluorescent powder<br>
in fluorescent lamp industries, high speed and high service life domestic and industrial burners, rocket nozzles, recuperators for waste heat utilisation in indirect furnaces, heat-exchangers, indirectly fired open/combined cycle gas turbines to generate electric power, pump seals for pumps handling corrosive fluids, wear resistant inserts, etc.<br>
RBSC is normally prepared by infiltrating molten silicon in inert atmosphere into a porous preform of silicon carbide and carbon powder, when silicon reacts with carbon to form newer silicon carbide which precipitates on the existing silicon carbide particles and bind them together. However, the process suffers from a disadvantage, that this exerts the chances of occurrence of free silicon in the final product. The free silicon phase being less refractory than SiC is known to have deleterious effect on almost all the physico-chemical and thermo-mechanical properties of reaction bonded silicon carbide both at room temperature and high temperatures. This difficulty has led to the development of melt infiltration technique in which the liquid infiltrant is taken in the form of a alloy of silicon normally with transition elements.<br>
In the case of MoSi2-RBSC non-oxide ceramic, the alloy infiltrant is normally made from the reaction between silicon and the binary compound MoSi2 [Liquid phase reaction bonding of silicon carbide using alloys of silicon -molybdenum melts - R. P. Messener and Y. M. Chiang, J. American Ceramic Soc. v73(5) 1990, pp.1193-1200]. The process appears to be expensive since it involves use of costly MoSi2 compound.<br>
In an other study, molten MoSi2 is infiltrated into a porous RBSC material in which the free silicon phase removed using evacuation at high<br>
temperature [Microstructure and mechanical properties of RBSC/MoSi2 composite - C. B. Lim, T. Yano and T. Iseki, J. Materials Science, v24, 1989, pp.4144-51]. The process is also expected to be expensive since it involves molten MoSi2 which is prepared at a very high temperature of around 2050°C.<br>
Infiltration of porous RBSC with alloyed melt comprising of Mo, Si and aluminium (Al) at high temperature (around 1950°C) has also been reported [High temperature strength of melt infiltrated SiC-Mo(Al,Si)2 composites - K. Shobu, E. Tani, M. Akiyama and T. Watanabe, J. American Ceramic Soc., v79(2), 1996, pp.544-46] for the preparation of Mo(Al,Si)2-RBSC composite and the process may be expensive because of the involvement of very high temperature. The formation of NbSi2-RBSC composite using infiltration of molten niobium (Nb) alloyed melt into a micro-porous preform of carbon (C) has recently been published [Reaction melt infiltration of silicon - niobium alloys into microporous carbon - M. Singh and D. R. Behrendt, J. Materials Research v9(7), 1994, pp. 1701-08] but the resulting composite has been, reported to contain appreciable amount of detrimental silicon phase.<br>
A few work in the related fields has been patented. The process patented by Taylor [Cold moulded dense silicon carbide articles and method of making the shapes, K. M. Taylor, USP 3,205,043, Sept. 7, 1965] involves the infiltration of high-char-yielding organic into a resin bonded compact of granular SiC followed by subsequent siliconisation. This process leads to the presence of appreciable porosity in the intermediate stage which gives appreciable amount of residual silicon to be present in the final product,<br>
which is detrimental so far as the thermomechanical and other properties are concerned. The process patented by Fitschmun [Method of making silicon carbide article of less than full density, D. R. Fitschmum, USP 3,947,550 Mar. 30, 1976] involves direct combination of silicon and carbon and thereby increses the chances of increasing amount of porosity to be present in the final product. Hence the properties are deteriorated. In an other work [Manufacture of silicon carbide ceramics free of residual silicon, T. R. Grossman, USP 5,571,758 Nov. 5, 1996], the amount of silicon was reduced by nitriding the phase. The precursor was a composite of carbon particulate with SiC fibre in the form of a wick. The process is still costly as it involves two stage process. Refractory grade reaction bonded SiC was prepared [Secondarily formed silicon carbide and free carbon containing microporous silicon carbide ceramics and their manufacture and use, I. Elstner, et.al, WOP 9633,959 Oct. 31, 1996] using anthracite/ graphite carbon. The product is essensially porous and is of inferior quality.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of MoSi2 - reaction bonded silicon carbide composite useful as a structural ceramic material which obviates the drawbacks as mentioned above.<br>
Another object is to provide an economical process for the preparation of MoSi2-RBSC composite.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to prepare MoSi2-RBSC composite using elemental Mo and Si.<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of a duplex non-oxide ceramic particularly MoSi2 - RBSC<br>
sintered composite using alloyed Mo/Si infiltrating melt prepared from elemental combination of powder Mo and Si. The uniqueness of the process is that, it demonstrates the possibility of using elemental Mo and Si as the infiltrating components and thereby making the overall process cheaper because of avoidance of costly MoSi2 compound in the melt formulation. Besides, both the elemental Mo and Si are readily available in very pure form.<br>
The process of the present invention involves the alloyed Mo/Si melt infiltration at high temperature into a porous compact of silicon and carbon when a part of silicon of the melt reacts with carbon to form newer silicon carbide (SiC) grains which act as the bond between the existing silicon carbide particles. The remaining silicon on reaction with alloying Mo gets converted to refractory MoSi2 phase. The presence of MoSi2 phase in the resulting composite by virtue of its brittle to ductile transition characteristics at around<br>
10000C is expected to improve the fracture toughness of the final composite particularly at<br>
 high temperature. The low temperature fracture properties may also excel by the matrix<br>
microcracking caused by the differential thermal expansion between matrix SiC and reinforcing MoSi2. Moreover, MoSi2 is known to form a dihedral angle of around 120° and as a result there is a strong possibility of crack deflection along the SiC-MoSi2 interface contributing higher fracture strength.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of MoSi2 - reaction bonded silicon carbide composite useful as a structural ceramic material, which comprises :<br>
(i) mixing elemental Mo and elemental Si powder in the desired ratio, heating the mix so obtained in a non-reacting atmosphere to a temperature in the range of 1600°C to 1800°C, to obtain a homogenous melt,<br>
(ii) mixing SiC and C powders in the desired ratio,<br>
(iii) preparing a green preform of desired shape and size by conventional ceramic fabrication methods using SiC and C mix obtained in<br>
step(ii),<br>
(iv) heating the SiC and C green preform so obtained in step (iii) in the presence of the Mo-Si homogenised melt obtained in step (i) to a temperature range of 1650°C to 1850°C in an inert atmosphere to obtain the MoSi2-RBSC composite.<br>
The   present   invention  provides   an   improved  process   for  the<br>
preparation of MoSi2 - reaction bonded silicon carbide composite useful as a<br>
structural ceramic material which is a new and   cheaper process for the<br>
preparation of MoSi2-RBSC composite. The steps to carry out the process<br>
are as follows :	<br>
1. Preparation of infiltrating alloyed melt from elemental source, such as,<br>
elemental Mo and elemental Si powders by proper weighing and intimate<br>
mixing followed by heating   in a non-reacting atmosphere, such as, in<br>
pure argon gas atmosphere or vacuum, to a temperature in the range of<br>
1600 to 1800°C forhomogenisation.<br>
2.	Preparation of SiC and C compact by proper weighing and mixing<br>
followed by preparing the shape of a billet or any other required shape by<br>
using conventional methods of ceramic fabrication, such as, uniaxial<br>
pressing, isostatic pressing, and extrusion.<br>
3.	Heating the SiC and C compact obtained in step (2) above in presence of<br>
the melt obained in step (1) above at a temperature in the range of 1650<br>
to 1850°C to obtain the duplex non-oxide ceramic.<br>
Particularly for the preparation MoSi2-RBSC composite, the ratio of C:SiC and the volume fraction of SiC in the green compact may be varied according to the ratio of MoSi2, Si and SiC desired in the final product.<br>
The weight ratio of C:SiC and volume fraction of SiC in the green compact may be in the ranges of 0.1 to 0.6 and 0.30 to 0.34 respectively.<br>
The elemental Mo and Si powders used may be of commercial grade having purity &gt;99% and &gt;98% respectively and may be of -200 BSS size each.<br>
The concentration of the alloying Mo in Si/Mo melt may be in the range of 5.13 to 26.8 weight %.<br>
The particle size of commercial grade SiC may vary from -1200 grit (1.63 micron mean diameter) to -400 grit (23.65 micron mean diameter).<br>
The particle size of carbon used may 4-6 micron.<br>
The following examples are given to illustrate the process of the invention and the manner in which it may be carried out in practice; however, this should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

mixed with/PVA solutiom again mixed and finally pressed isostatically in<br>
the shape of a billet. The billet is dried at 120°C and its physical parameters, like, dimensions, weight and green density are measured.<br>

The advantages of the process for production of MoSi2-RBSC composite are :<br>

is of commercial variety.<br>

the volume fractions of SiC in the starting compact, complete elimination<br>
of free silicon in the composite matrix is possible.<br><br><br>
