				<td>Crystalline forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
The present invention relates to crystal forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydro-<br>
chloride and hydrates and solvates thereof. This invention also relates to processes for pre-<br>
paring the crystal forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride and hydrates<br>
and solvates thereof. This invention also relates to compositions comprising selected and<br>
stable crystal forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride or a hydrate there-<br>
of and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
It is known that the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitting catecholamines from phenylalanine<br>
requires tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor, (6R)-2-amino-4-oxo-6-[(1R,2S)-1,2-dihydroxypropyl]-<br>
5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine according to formula (I),<br><br>
at the monooxygenation step of phenylalanine and tyrosine. It is supposed that the catechol-<br>
amine biosynthesis is regulated in a great extent by tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor, and that a<br>
decrease of the cofactor in central nerve systems causes several neurological disorders<br>
such as parkinsonism and atypical phenylketonuria. Thelcompound of formula I is therefore<br>
an effective therapeutic agent for treatment of said disorders in mammals in need thereof.<br>
The compound of formula I is difficult to handle and it is therefore produced and offered as<br>
its dihydrochloride salt (Schircks Laboratories, CH-8645 Jona, Switzerland) even in ampou-<br>
les sealed under nitrogen to prevent degradation of the substance due to its hygroscopic na-<br>
ture and sensitivity to oxidation. US-A-4 649 197 discloses that separation of (6R)- and 6(S)-<br>
L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride into its diastereomers is difficult due to the poor<br>
crystallinity of 6(R,S)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride. In EP-A1-0 079 574 is<br>
described the preparation of tetrahydrobiopterin, where a solid tetrahydrobiopterin dihydro-<br><br>
chloride is obtained as an intermediate. S. Matsuura et al. describes in Chemistry Letters<br>
1984, pages 735-738 and Heterocycles, Vol. 23, No. 12, 1985 pages 3115-3120 6(R)-tetra-<br>
hydrobiopterin dihydrochloride as a crystalline solid in form of colourless needles, which are<br>
characterized by X-ray analysis disclosed in J. Biochem. 98, 1341-1348 (1985). An optical<br>
rotation of 6.81° was found the crystalline product, which is quite similar to the optical rota-<br>
tion of 6.51 ° reported for a crystalline solid in form of white crystals in example 6 of EP-A2-0<br>
191 335.<br>
Results obtained during investigation and development of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin<br>
dihydrochloride development revealed that the known crystallinesolids can be designated<br>
as form B, for which was found a characteristic X-ray powder diffraction pattern with charac-<br>
teristic peaks expressed in d-values (A):<br>
8.7 (vs), 6.9 (w), 5.90 (vw), 5.63 (m), 5.07 (m), 4.76 (m), 4.40 (m), 4.15 (w), 4.00 (s), 3.95<br>
(m), 3.52 (m), 3.44 (w), 3.32 (m), 3.23 (s), 3.17 (w), 3.11 (vs), 3.06 (w), 2.99 (w), 2.96 (w),<br>
2.94 (m), 2.87 (w), 2.84 (s), 2.82 (m), 2.69 (w), 2.59 (w), 2.44 (w). A characteristic X-ray<br>
powder diffraction pattern is exhibited in Figure 2.<br>
Here and in the following the abbreviations in brackets mean: (vs) = very strong intensity; (s)<br>
= strong intensity; (m) = medium intensity; (w) = weak intensity; and (vw) = very weak inten-<br>
sity.<br>
Polymorph B is a slightly hygroscopic anhydrate with the highest thermodynamic stability<br>
above about 20 °C. Furthermore, form B can be easily processed and handled due to its<br>
thermal stability, possibility for preparation by targeted conditions, its suitable morphology<br>
and particle size. Melting point is near 260 °C (ΔHf &gt; 140 J/g), but no clear melting point can<br>
be detected due to decomposition prior and during melting. These outstanding properties<br>
renders polymorph form B especially feasible for pharmaceutical application, which are<br>
prepared at elevated temperatures. Polymorph B can be obtained as a fine powder with a<br>
particle size that may range from 0.2 µm to 500 µm.<br>
Hovever, there is a need for other stable forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihy-<br>
drochloride with satisfactory chemical and physical stability for a safe handling during ma-<br>
nufacture and formulation as well as providing a high 6torage stability in its pure form or in<br>
formulations. In addition, there is a strong need for processes to produce polymorph B and<br><br>
chloride is obtained as an intermediate. S. Matsuura et al. describes in Chemistry Letters<br>

renders polymorph form B especially feasible for pharmaceutical application, which are<br>
prepared at elevated temperatures. Polymorph B can be obtained as a fine powder with a<br>
particle size that may range from 0.2 µm to 500 µm.<br>
However, there is a need for other stable forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihy-<br>
drochloride with satisfactory chemical and physical stability for a safe handling during ma-<br>
nufacture and formulation as well as providing a high storage stability in its pure form or in<br>
formulations. In addition, there is a strong need for processes to produce polymorph B and<br><br>
other crystalline forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride on a large scale<br>
in a controlled manner<br>
Results obtained during development of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
indicated that the compound may exist in different crystalline forms, including polymorphic<br>
forms and solvates. The continued interest in this area requires an efficient and reliable me-<br>
thod for the preparation of the individual crystal forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin<br>
dihydrochloride and controlled crystallization conditions to provide crystal forms, that are<br>
preferably stable and easy to handle and to process in the manufacture and preparation of<br>
formulations, and that provide a high storage stability in substance form or as formulated<br>
product, or which provide less stable forms suitable as intermediates for controlled crystalli-<br>
sation for the manufacture of stable forms.<br>

morph N of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride, which exhibits a character-<br>
ristic X-ray powder diffraction pattern as exhibited in Figure 14.<br>
Form N may contain in total up to 10% of isopropanol and water, which suggests that form N<br>
is a slightly hygroscopic isopropanol solvate. Form N may be obtained through washing of<br>
form D with isopropanol and subsequent drying in vacuum at about 30 °C. Form N is espe-<br>
cially suitable as intermediate and starting material to produce stable polymorph forms. Po-<br>
lymorph form N can be prepared as a solid powder with desired medium particle size range<br>
which is typically ranging from 1 µm to about 500 µm.<br>
For the preparation of the polymorph forms, there may be used crystallisation techniques<br>
well known in the art, such as stirring of a suspension (phase equilibration in), preci pitation,<br>
re-crystallisation, evaporation, solvent like water sorption methods or decomposition of sol-<br>
vates. Diluted, saturated or super-saturated solutions may be used for crystallisation, with or<br>
without seeding with suitable nucleating agents. Temperatures up to 100 °C may be applied<br>
to form solutions. Cooling to initiate crystallisation and precipitation down to -100 °C and<br>
preferably down to -30 °C may be applied. Meta-stable polymorphs or pseudo-polymorphic<br>
forms can be used to prepare solutions or suspensions for the preparation of more stable<br>
forms and to achieve higher concentrations in the solutions.<br>
4. Preparation of polymorph forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
Polymorph form A<br>
Polymorph form A may be obtained by freeze drying or water removal of solutions of (6R)-L-<br>
erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride in water. A further object of the invention is a<br>
process for the preparation of polymorph form A of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihy-<br>
drochloride, comprising dissolving (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride at am-<br>
bient temperatures in water, (1) cooling the solution to low temperatures for solidifying the<br>
solution, and removing water under reduced pressure, or (2) removing water from said aque-<br>
ous solution.<br><br>
The crystalline form A can be isolated by filtration and then dried to evaporate absorbed wa-<br>
ter from the product. Drying conditions and methods are known and drying of the isolated<br>
product or water removal pursuant to variant (2) according to the invention may be carried<br>
out in applying elevated temperatures, for example up to 80 °C, preferably in the range from<br>
30 °C to 80 °C, under vacuum or elevated temperatures and vacuum. Prior to isolation of a<br>
precipitate obtained in variant (2), the suspension may be stirred for a certain time for phase<br>
equilibration. The concentration of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride in the<br>
aqueous solution may be from 5 to 40 percent by weight, referred to the solution.<br>
Ambient temperatures may mean a range from 30 to 120 °C. Low temperatures may mean<br>
temperatures below -40 °C and preferably below -60 °C and to -180 °C. A fast cooling is<br>
preferred to obtain solid solutions as starting material. A reduced pressure is applied until<br>
the solvent is completely removed. Freeze drying is a technology well known in the art. The<br>
time to complete solvent removal is dependent on the applied vacuum, which may be from<br>
0.01 to 1 mbar, the solvent used and the freezing temperature.<br>
Polymorph form A is stable at room temperature or below room temperature under substan-<br>
tially water free conditions, which is demonstrated with phase equilibration tests of suspen-<br>
sions in tetrahydrofuran or tertiary-butyl methyl ether stirred for five days and 18 hours re-<br>
spectively under nitrogen at room temperature. Filtration and air drying at room temperature<br>
yields unchanged polymorph form A.<br>
Polymorph B<br>
All crystal forms (polymorphs, hydrates and solvates), inclusive crystal form B, can be used<br>
for the preparation of the most stable polymorph B.<br>
Polymorph B may be obtained by phase equilibration of suspensions of amorphous or other<br>
forms than polymorph form B, such as polymorph A, in suitable polar and non aqueous sol-<br>
vents. The present invention also refers to a process for the preparation of polymorph form B<br>
of (6R)-L-erythrotetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride, comprising dispersion of particles of a<br>
solid form, preferably other than form B, of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochlori-<br>
de in a solvent at room temperature, stirring the suspension at ambient temperatures for a<br><br>
time sufficient to produce polymorph form B, thereafter isolating crystalline form B and re-<br>
moving the solvent from the isolated form B.<br>
Ambient temperatures may mean temperatures in a range from 0 °C to 60 °C, preferably 20<br>
°C to 40 °C. The applied temperature may be changed during treatment and stirring by de-<br>
creasing the temperature stepwise or continuously. Suitable solvents are for example me-<br>
thanol, ethanol, isopropanol, other C3- and C4-alcohols, acetic acid, acetonitrile, tetrahydro-<br>
furane, methyl-t-butyl ether, 1,4-dioxane, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, other C3-C6-ace-<br>
tates, methyl ethyl ketone and other methyl-C3-C5alkyl-ketones. The time to complete phase<br>
equilibration may be up to 30 hours and preferably up to 20 hours or less than 20 hours.<br>
Polymorph B may also be obtained by crystallisation from solvent mixtures containing up to<br>
about 5% water, especially from mixtures of ethanol, acetic acid and water. The present in-<br>
vention also refers to a process for the preparation of polymorph form B of (6R)-L-erythro-<br>
tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride, comprising dissolution, optionally at elevated tempera-<br>
tures, preferably of a solid lower energy form than form B or of form B of (6R)-L-erythro-tet-<br>
rahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride in a solvent mixture comprising ethanol, acetic acid and<br>
water, addition of seeds to the solution, cooling the obtained suspension and isolation of the<br>
formed crystals.<br>
Dissolution may be carried out at room temperature or up to 70 °C, preferably up to 50 °C.<br>
There may be used the final solvent mixture for dissolution or the starting material may be<br>
first dissolved in water and the other solvents may than be added both or one after the other<br>
solvent. The composition of the solvent mixture may comprise a volume ratio of water: ace-<br>
tic acid : tetrahydrofurane of 1 : 3: 2 to 1: 9:4 and preferably 1 : 5:4. The solution is prefe-<br>
rably stirred. Cooling may mean temperatures down to -40 °C to 0 °C, preferably down to 10<br>
°C to 30 °C. Suitable seeds are polymorph form B from another batch or crystals having a<br>
similar or identical morphology. After isolation, the crystalline form B can be washed with a<br>
non-solvent such as acetone or tetrahydrofurane and dried in usual manner.<br>
Polymorph B may also be obtained by crystallisation from aqueous solutions through the ad-<br>
dition of non-solvents such as methanol, ethanol and acetic acid. The crystallisation and iso-<br>
lation procedure can be advantageously carried out at room temperature without cooling the<br>
solution. This process is therefore very suitable to be carried out at an industrial scale.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention refers to a process for the preparation of<br>
polymorph form B of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride, comprising disso-<br>
lution of a solid form other than form B or of form B of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin<br>
dihydrochloride in water at ambient temperatures, adding a non-solvent in an amount<br>
sufficient to form a suspension, optionally stirring the suspension for a certain time, and<br>
thereafter isolation of the formed crystals.<br>
A crystallization experiment from solution can be followed by a subsequent suspension equi-<br>
libration under ambient conditions.<br>
Ambient temperatures may mean a temperature in the range of 10 to 40 °C, and most prefe-<br>
rably room temperature. The concentration of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydro-<br>
chloride in the aqueous solution may be from 10 to 80 percent by weight, more preferably<br>
from 20 to 60 percent by weight, referred to the solution. Preferred non-solvents are metha-<br>
nol, ethanol and acetic acid. The non-solvent may be added to the aqueous solution. More<br>
preferably, the aqueous solution is added to the non-solvent. The stirring time after formation<br>
of the suspension may be up to 30 hours and preferably up to 20 hours or less than 20<br>
hours. Isolation by filtration and drying is carried out in known manner as described before.<br>
Polymorph form B is a very stable crystalline form, that can be easily filtered off, dried and<br>
ground to particle sizes desired for pharmaceutical formulations. These outstanding proper-<br>
ties renders polymorph form B especially feasible for pharmaceutical application.<br>
Polymorph F<br>
Polymorph F may be obtained by phase equilibration of suspensions of polymorph form A in<br>
suitable polar and non-aqueous solvents, which scarcely dissolve said lower energy forms,<br>
especially alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and isopropanol. The present in-<br>
vention also refers to a process for the preparation of polymorph form F of (6R)-L-erythro-<br>
tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride, comprising dispersion of particles of solid form A of<br>
(6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride in a non-aqueous solvent that scarcely<br>
dissolves said (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride below room temperature,<br>
stirring the suspension at said temperatures for a time sufficient to produce polymorph form<br>
F, thereafter isolating crystalline form F and removing the solvent from the isolated form F.<br>
Removing of solvent and drying may be carried out under air, dry air or a dry protection gas<br>
such as nitrogen or noble gases and at or below room temperature, for example down to 0<br><br>
°C. The temperature during phase equilibration is preferably from 5 to 15 °C and most pre-<br>
ferably about 10 °C.<br>
Polymorph J<br>
Polymorph J may be obtained by dehydration of form E at moderate temperatures under va-<br>
cuum. The present invention also refers to a process for the preparation of polymorph form J<br>
of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride, comprising preparation of form E and<br>
removing the water from form E by treating form E in a vacuum drier to obtain form J at mo-<br>
derate temperatures which may mean a temperature in the range of 25 to 70 °C, and most<br>
preferably 30 to 50 °C.<br>
Polymorph K<br>
Polymorph K may be obtained by crystallization from mixtures of polar solvents containing<br>
small amounts of water and in the presence of small amounts of ascorbic acid. Solvents for<br>
the solvent mixture may be selected from acetic acid and an alcohol such as methanol, etha-<br>
nol, n- or isopropanol. The present invention also refers to a process for the preparation of<br>
polymorph form K of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride, comprising dissol-<br>
ving (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride in a mixture of acetic acid and an al-<br>
cohol or tetrahydrofurane containing small amounts of water and a small amount of ascorbic<br>
acid at elevated temperatures, lowering temperature below room temperature to crystallise<br>
said dihydrochloride, isolating the precipitate and drying the isolated precipitate at elevated<br>
temperature optionally under vacuum. Suitable alcohols are for example methanol, ethanol,<br>
propanol and isopropanol, whereby ethanol is preferred. The ratio of acetic acid to alcohol or<br>
tetrahydrofurane may be from 2:1 to 1:2 and preferably about 1:1. Dissolution of (6R)-L-ery-<br>
thro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride can be carried out in presence of a higher water<br>
content and more of the antisolvent mixture can be added to obtain complete precipitation.<br>
The amount of water in the final composition may be from 0.5 to 5 percent by weight and the<br>
amount of ascorbic acid may be from 0.01 to 0.5 percent by weight, both referred to the<br>
solvent mixture. The temperature for dissolution may be in the range from 30 to 100 and<br>
preferably 35 to 70 °C and the drying temperature may be in the range from 30 to 50 °C.<br>
The precipitate may be washed with an alcohol such as ethanol after isolation, e.g. filtration.<br>
The polymorph K can easily be converted in the most stable form B by phase equilibration in<br>
e.g. isopropanol and optionally seeding with form B crystals at above room temperature<br>
such as temperatures from 30 to 40 °C.<br><br>
5. Preparation of hydrate forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
Form C<br>
Hydrate form C may be obtained by phase equilibration at ambient temperatures of a poly-<br>
morph form such as polymorph B suspension in a non-solvent which contains water in an<br>
amount of preferably about 5 percent by weight, referred to the solvent. The present invent-<br>
tion also refers to a process for the preparation of hydrate form C of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahy-<br>
drobiopterin dihydrochloride, comprising suspending (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihy-<br>
drochloride in a non-solvent such as heptane, C1-C4-alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 1-<br>
or 2-propanol, acetates, such as ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetic acid or ethers such as<br>
terahydrofuran, dioxane, tertiary-butyl methyl ether, or binary or ternary mixtures of such<br>
non-solvents, to which sufficient water is added to form a monohydrate, and stirring the sus-<br>
pension at or below ambient temperatures (e.g. 0 to 30 °C) for a time sufficient to form a mo-<br>
nohydrate. Sufficient water may mean from 1 to 10 and preferably from 3 to 8 percent by<br>
weight of water, referred to the amount of solvent. The solids may be filtered off and dried in<br>
air at about room temperature. The solid can absorb some water and therefore possess a<br>
higher water content than the theoretical value of 5.5 percent by weight. Hydrate form C is<br>
unstable with respect to forms D and B, and easily converted to polymorph form B at tempe-<br>
ratures of about 40 °C in air and lower relative humidity. Form C can be transformed into the<br>
more stable hydrate D by suspension equilibration at room temperature.<br>
Form D<br>
Hydrate form D may be obtained by adding at about room temperature concentrated aque-<br>
ous solutions of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride to an excess of a non-sol-<br>
vent such as hexane, heptane, dichloromethane, 1- or 2-propanol, acetone, ethyl acetate,<br>
acetonitril, acetic acid or ethers such as terahydrofuran, dioxane, tertiary-butyl methyl ether,<br>
or mixtures of such non-solvents, and stirring the suspension at ambient temperatures. The<br>
crystalline solid can be filtered off and then dried under dry nitrogen at ambient temperatu-<br>
res. A preferred non-solvent is isopropanol. The addition of the aqueous solution may car-<br>
ried out drop-wise to avoid a sudden precipitation. The present invention also refers to a pro-<br>
cess for the preparation of hydrate form D of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochlo-<br>
ride, comprising adding at about room temperature a concentrated aqueous solutions of<br>
(6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride to an excess of a non-solvent and stirring<br>
the suspension at ambient temperatures. Excess of non-solvent may mean a ratio of aque-<br>
ous to the non solvent from 1:10 to 1:1000. Form D contains a small excess of water, related<br><br>
to the monohydrate, and it is believed that it is absorbed water due to the slightly hygrosco-<br>
pic nature of this crystalline hydrate. Hydrate form D is deemed to be the most stable one<br>
under the known hydrates at ambient temperatures and a relative humidity of less than 70%.<br>
Hydrate form D may be used for formulations prepared under conditions, where this hydrate<br>
is stable. Ambient temperature may mean 20 to 30 °C.<br>
Hydrate form E<br>
Hydrate form E may be obtained by adding concentrated aqueous solutions of (6R)-L-ery-<br>
thro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride to an excess of a non-solvent cooled to temperatu-<br>
res from about 10 to -10 °C and preferably between 0 to 10 °C and stirring the suspension at<br>
said temperatures. The crystalline solid can be filtered off and then dried under dry nitrogen<br>
at ambient temperatures. Non-solvents are for example such as hexane, heptane, dichloro-<br>
methane, 1- or 2-propanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetic acid or ethers such as<br>
terahydrofuran, dioxane, tertiary-butyl methyl ether, or mixtures of such non-solvents. A pre-<br>
ferred non-solvent is isopropanol. The addition of the aqueous solution may carried out drop-<br>
wise to avoid a sudden precipitation. The present invention also refers to a process for the<br>
preparation of hydrate form E of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride, compri-<br>
sing adding a concentrated aqueous solutions of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydro-<br>
chloride to an excess of a non-solvent which is cooled to temperatures from about 10 to -10<br>
°C, and stirring the suspension at ambient temperatures. Excess of non-solvent may mean a<br>
ratio of aqueous to the non solvent from 1:10 to 1:1000. A preferred non-solvent is tetrahy-<br>
drofuran. Another preparation process comprises exposing polymorph form B to an air atmo-<br>
sphere with a relative humidity of 70 to 90%, preferably about 80%. Hydrate form E is dee-<br>
med to be a dihydrate, whereby some additional water may be absorbed. Polymorph form E<br>
can be transformed into polymorph J upon drying under vacuum at moderate temperatures,<br>
which may mean between 20°C and 50°C at pressures between 0 and 100 mbar. Form E is<br>
especially suitable for formulations in semi solid forms because of its stability at high relative<br>
humidities.<br>
Form H<br>
Hydrate form H may be obtained by dissolving at ambient temperatures (6R)-L-erythro-tetra-<br>
hydrobiopterin dihydrochloride in a mixture of acetic acid and water, adding then a non-sol-<br>
vent to precipitate a crystalline solid, cooling the obtained suspension and stirring the cooled<br>
suspension for a certain time. The crystalline solid is filtered off and then dried under vacu-<br>
um at ambient temperatures. Non-solvents are for example such as hexane, heptane, di-<br><br>
chloromethane, 1- or 2-propanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetic acid or ethers<br>
such as terahydrofuran, dioxane, tertiary-butyl methyl ether, or mixtures of such non-sol-<br>
vents. A preferred non-solvent is tetrahydrofuran. The present invention also refers to a pro-<br>
cess for the preparation of hydrate form H of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochlo-<br>
ride, comprising dissolving at ambient temperatures (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihy-<br>
drochloride in a mixture of acetic acid and a less amount than that of acetic acid of water,<br>
adding a non-solvent and cooling the obtained suspension to temperatures in the range of -<br>
10 to 10 X, and preferably -5 to 5 °C, and stirring the suspension at said temperature for a<br>
certain time. Certain time may mean 1 to 20 hours. The weight ratio of acetic acid to water<br>
may be from 2:1 to 25:1 and preferably 5:1 to 15:1. The weight ratio of acetic acid/water to<br>
the non-solvent may be from 1:2 to 1:5. Hydrate form H seems to be a monohydrate with a<br>
slight excess of water absorbed due to the hygroscopic nature.<br>
Form O<br>
Hydrate form O can be prepared by exposure of polymorphic form F to a nitrogen atmosphe-<br>
re containing water vapour with a resulting relative humidity of about 52% for about 24<br>
hours. The fact that form F, which is a slightly hygroscopic anhydrate, can be used to prepa-<br>
re form O under 52% relative humidity suggests that form O is a hydrate, which is more<br>
stable than form F under ambient temperature and humidity conditions.<br>
6. Preparation of solvate forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
Form G<br>
Ethanol solvate form G may be obtained by crystallisation of L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin<br>
dihydrochloride dissolved in water and adding a large excess of ethanol, stirring the obtained<br>
suspension at or below ambient temperatures and drying the isolated solid under air or nitro-<br>
gen at about room temperature. Here, a large excess of ethanol means a resulting mixture<br>
of ethanol and water with less than 10% water, preferably about 3 to 6%. The present in-<br>
vention also refers to a process for the preparation of ethanolate form G of (6R)-L-erythro-<br>
tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride, comprising dissolving at about room temperature to<br>
temperatures of 75 °C (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride in water or in a<br>
mixture of water and ethanol, cooling a heated solution to room temperature and down to 5<br>
to 10 °C, adding optionally ethanol to complete precipitation, stirring the obtained suspen-<br>
sion at temperatures of 20 to 5 °C, filtering off the white, crystalline solid and drying the solid<br>
under air or a protection gas such as nitrogen at temperatures about room temperature. The<br><br>
process may be carried out in a first variant in dissolving (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin<br>
dihydrochloride at about room temperature in a lower amount of water and then adding an<br>
excess of ethanol and then stirring the obtained suspension for a time sufficient for phase<br>
equilibration. In a second variant, (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride may be<br>
suspended in ethanol, optionally adding a lower amount of water, and heating the suspen-<br>
sion and dissolute (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride, cooling down the so-<br>
lution to temperatures of about 5 to 15 °C, adding additional ethanol to the suspension and<br>
then stirring the obtained suspension for a time sufficient for phase equilibration.<br>
Form I<br>
Acetic acid solvate form I may be obtained by dissolution of L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin<br>
dihydrochloride in a mixture of acetic acid and water at elevated temperature, adding further<br>
acetic acid to the solution, cooling down to a temperature of about 10 °C, then warming up<br>
the formed suspension to about 15 °C, and then stirring the obtained suspension for a time<br>
sufficient for phase equilibration, which may last up to 3 days. The crystalline solid is then<br>
filtered off and dried under air or a protection gas such as nitrogen at temperatures about<br>
room temperature.<br>
Form L<br>
Form L may be obtained by suspending hydrate form E at room temperature in ethanol and<br>
stirring the suspension at temperatures from 0 to 10 °C, preferably about 5 °C, for a time<br>
sufficient for phase equilibration, which may be 10 to 20 hours. The crystalline solid is then<br>
filtered off and dried preferably under reduced pressure at 30°C or under nitrogen. Analysis<br>
by TG-FTIR suggests that form L may contain variable amounts of ethanol and water, i.e. it<br>
can exist as an polymorph (anhydrate), as a mixed ethanol solvate / hydrate, or even as a<br>
hydrate.<br>
Form M<br>
Ethanol solvate form M may be obtained by dissolution of L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin di-<br>
hydrochloride in ethanol and evaporation of the solution under nitrogen at ambient tempe-<br>
rature, i.e., between 10°C and 40°C. Form M may also be obtained by drying of form G un-<br>
der a slight flow of dry nitrogen at a rate of about 20 to 100 ml/min. Depending on the extent<br>
of drying under nitrogen, the remaining amount of ethanol may be variable, i.e. from about<br>
3% to 13%.<br><br>
Form N<br>
The isopropanol form N may be obtained by dissolution of L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin di-<br>
hydrochloride in 4.0 ml of a mixture of isopropanol and water (mixing volume ratio for ex-<br>
ample 4:1). To this solution is slowly added isopropanol (IPA, for example about4.0 ml) and<br>
the resulting suspension is cooled to 0°C and stirred for several hours (e.g. about 10 to 18<br>
hours) at this temperature. The suspension is filtered and the solid residue washed with iso-<br>
propanol at room temperature. The obtained crystalline material is then dried at ambient<br>
temperature (e.g. about 20 to 30°C) and reduced pressure (about 2 to 10 mbar) for several<br>
hours (e.g. about 5 to 20 hours). TG-FTIR shows a weight loss of 9.0% between 25 to 200<br>
°C, which is attributed to both isopropanol and water. This result suggests that form N can<br>
exist either in form of an isopropanol solvate, or in form of mixed isopropanol solvate /<br>
hydrate, or as an non-solvated form containing a small amount of water.<br>
A further object of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising solid crystal<br>
forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride selected from the group consis-<br>
ting of forms A, B, D, E, F, J, K, L and O or a combination thereof, and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
As mentioned above, it was found that crystal form B is the most stable form of all found<br>
crystal forms. Crystal form B is especially suitable for various types and a broad range of<br>
formulations, even in presence of humid components without formation of hydrates.<br>
Accordingly, this invention is also directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
pure polymorph form B of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride and a phar-<br>
maceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
In principle, also forms A, D, E, F, J, K, L and O are suitable for use in pharmaceutical for-<br>
mulations and accordingly, this invention is also directed to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising forms A, D, E, F, J, K, L and O of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydro-<br>
chloride and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. For forms A, F, J, K and L are<br>
preferably used dry formulation components and products may be kept in sealed containers,<br>
mainly to avoid formation of hydrates. Hydrate forms D, E and O can be used directly in pre-<br>
sence of humid components for the formulation and air humidity must not be excluded.<br><br>
It was surprisingly found that hydrate form D is the most stable form under the hydrates and<br>
forms B and D are especially suitable to be used in pharmaceutical formulations. Forms B<br>
and D presents some advantages like an aimed manufacture, good handling due to conveni-<br>
ent crystal size and morphology, very good stability under production conditions of various<br>
types of formulation, storage stability, higher solubility, and high bio-availability.<br>
Accordingly, this invention is particularly directed to a pharmaceutical composition compri-<br>

pterin dihydrochloride for the manufacture of a medicament useful in the treatment of neuro-<br>

The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting the scope.<br>
A) Preparation of polymorph forms<br>
Within the Examples A1, A5, A6 and A7 (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
from Schircks Laboratories, CH-8645 Jona, Switzerland was used as starting material.<br>
Example A1: Preparation of polymorph form A of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydro-<br>
chloride<br>
1.05 gram of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride are dissolved in 4.0 ml of bi-<br>
distilled water at 23 ±2 °C. The solution is filtrated through a 0.22 µm millipore filtration unit<br>
and the filtrate is transferred into a 250 ml round flask. The solution in this flask is frozen by<br>
placing the flask into a bed with solid carbon dioxide at -78°C. The flask with the frozen<br>
content is then connected to a laboratory freeze dryer operating at a starting pressure of<br>
about 0.05 mbar. After about 20 hours the freeze drying is complete and the vacuum flask is<br>
disconnected from the freeze dryer and about 1.0 g of white, crystalline solid material is<br>
obtained. Investigation of the obtained solid by powder X-ray diffraction reveals form A,<br>
which shows the powder X-ray diffraction pattern as exhibited in table 1 and figure 1. Further<br>
investigation of the obtained solid by thermogravimetry coupled with infrared spectroscopy at<br>
a heating rate of 10°C/minute reveals a water content of about 3% with a nearly continuous<br>
release of the water between 50°C and 200°C. The sample begins to decompose above 200<br>
°C.<br><br><br><br>
Example A2: Stability of polymorph form A<br>
105 mg of polymorph A according to example A1 are suspended in 1.0 ml tertiary butyl me-<br>
thyl ether (TBME). The suspension is stirred under nitrogen atmosphere for about 18 hours<br>
at room temperature, filtrated and the white solid residue is then dried under air. Yield: 103<br>
mg of crystalline white solid, which essentially still corresponds to form A according to FT<br>
Raman spectrum and X-ray diffraction pattern.<br>
Example A3: Stability of polymorph form A<br>
90 mg of polymorph A according to example A1 are suspended in 2.0 ml tetrahydrofuran<br>
(THF) and the resulting suspension is stirred in air for five days at room temperature, filtrated<br>
and the white solid residue is then dried under air. Yield: 85 mg of crystalline white solid,<br>
which still corresponds to form A according to FT Raman spectrum and X-ray diffraction pat-<br>
tern.<br>
Example A4: Preparation of polymorph form B of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydro-<br>
chloride from polymorph form A<br>
94 mg o1 (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride as polymorph form A according<br>
to example A1 are suspended in 1.0 ml of ethanol in a 4.0 ml glass vial under nitrogen. The<br>

tion of the obtained solid sample by powder X-ray diffraction reveals a crystalline form O,<br>
which shows the powder X-ray diffraction pattern as exhibited in table 11 and in figure 15.<br><br><br><br>
C) Preparation of solvate forms of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
Example C1: Preparation of form G of(6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
from polymorph form B according to example A4<br>
245 mg of polymorph form B according to example A4 are suspended in 4.0 ml ethanol. 0.5<br>
ml water are added and the mixture is heated to 70°C to dissolve form B. The solution is<br>
cooled to 10 °C. 2 ml of ethanol are added and the formed suspension is stirred for about 4<br>
hours at 10°C. The solid is filtered off and dried for about 30 minutes under a slight flow of<br>
nitrogen at room temperature. Yield: 190 mg of crystalline white solid designated as form G.<br>
TG-FTIR shows a weight loss of 11.5% between 25 to 200 °C, which is attributed to loss of<br>
ethanol and suggests an ethanol solvate. Investigation of the obtained solid by powder X-ray<br>
diffraction reveals a crystalline form G, which shows the powder X-ray diffraction pattern as<br>
exhibited in table 12 and in figure 7.<br><br><br><br>
Example C2: Preparation of form G of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
from polymorph form B according to example A4<br>
200 mg of polymorph form B according to example A4 are dissolved in 400 nl water then<br>
precipitated with the addition of 10 ml ethanol. A precipitate is formed and the suspension is<br>
stirred for 17 hours at 0°C. The solid is filtered off and dried in air at room temperature for<br>
about 1 hour. Yield: 161 mg of crystalline white solid corresponding to ethanol solvate G<br>
according to example C1.<br>
Example C3: Preparation of form L of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
from hydrate form E according to example B8<br>
104 mg of hydrate form E according to example B8 are suspended in ethanol and the sus-<br>
pension is stirred at 4°C for about 16 hours. The solid is filtered off and dried under nitrogen<br>
at room temperature. Yield: 100 mg of crystalline white solid designated as form L. TG-FTIR<br>
shows a weight loss of 9.1% between 25 to 200 °C, which is attributed to ethanol and water.<br>
This weight loss suggests a mixed water / ethanol solvate. Investigation of the obtained solid<br>
by powder X-ray diffraction reveals a crystalline form L, which shows the powder X-ray dif-<br>
fraction pattern as exhibited in table 13 and in figure 12.<br><br><br><br>
Example C4: Preparation of form L of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
from form B according to example A4<br>
2.0 g of form B according to example A4 are dissolved in 3.0 ml of water. This solution is<br>
slowly added to 70 ml absolute ethanol (not denaturated) at room temperature. Approxima-<br>
tely 300 mg of ascorbic acid are added to the aqueous solution and the void volume of the<br>
suspension is purged with nitrogen to prevent oxidation. The resulting suspension is cooled<br>
to 0°C and stirred at this temperature for about three hours. Thereafter the suspension is fil-<br>
tered and the solid residue is washed with 6.0 g ethanol and dried for 18 hours at 35°C un-<br>
der reduced pressure (8 mbar). Yield: 1.41 g. TG-FTIR shows a weight loss of 3.0% bet-<br>
ween 25 to 200 °C, attributed to water. This results suggests that form L can exist either in<br>
form of an ethanol solvate, or in form of mixed ethanol solvate / hydrate, or as an non-sol-<br>
vated form containing as small amount of water. The solid residue comprises form L as<br>
shown by a comparison of powder X-ray diffraction pattern with that in example.<br>
Example C5: Preparation of form M of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
from polymorph form B according to example A4<br>
120 mg of form B of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride according to example<br>
A4 are dissolved in 100 ml of absolute ethanol at 40°C. This solution is evaporated to dry-<br>
ness under a slight flow of nitrogen. The obtained crystalline white solid is designated as<br>
form M. TG-FTIR shows a weight loss of 9.1% between 25 to 200 °C, attributed to ethanol<br>
and water, suggesting a mixed water/ethanol solvate. Investigation of the obtained solid by<br>
powder X-ray diffraction reveals a crystalline form M, which shows the powder X-ray dif-<br>
fraction pattern as exhibited in table 14 and in figure 13.<br><br><br>
Example C6: Preparation of form N of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride<br>
from ethanol solvate form B according to example A4<br>
250 mg of form B according to example A4 are dissolved in 4.0 ml of a mixture of isopropa-<br>
nol and water (4:1). To this solution 4.0 ml of IPA are slowly added and the resulting sus-<br>
pension is cooled to 0°C and stirred for about 18 hours at this temperature. The suspension<br>
is filtered and the solid residue washed with 4 ml of isopropanol at room temperature. The<br>
obtained crystalline material is then dried at 30°C and reduced pressure (8 mbar) for about<br>
18 hours. Yield: 150 mg. TG-FTIR shows a weight loss of 9.0% between 25 to 200 °C, which<br>
is attributed to both isopropanol and water. This result suggests that form N can exist either<br>
in form of an isopropanol solvate, or in form of mixed isopropanol solvate / hydrate, or as an<br>
non-solvated form containing a small amount of water. Investigation by powder X-ray diffrac-<br>
tion shows that the solid residue comprises form N, which shows the powder X-ray diffrac-<br>
tion pattern as exhibited in table 15 and in figure 14.<br><br>
Example C7: Preparation of acetic acid solvate form I of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin<br>
dihydrochloride from polymorph form B according to example A4<br>
252 mg of polymorph form B according to example A4 are dissolved at 40°C in 4.0 ml acetic<br>
acid /water (4:1). 4.0 ml acetic are then added acid and the solution is cooled to 5° C. The<br>
resulting suspension is stirred for 66 hours. The solid is filtered off and dried in air for 5<br>
hours at room temperature. Yield: 190 mg of crystalline white solid designated as form I. TG-<br>
FTIR reveals that form I contains about 12.7% by weight of acetic acid, which suggests an<br>
acetic acid solvate. Investigation of the obtained solid by powder X-ray diffraction reveals a<br><br>
crystalline form I, which shows the powder X-ray diffraction pattern as exhibited in table 16<br>
and in figure 9.<br><br>
Experimental:<br>
Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD): PXRD is performed either on a Philips 1710 or on a<br>
Philips X'Pert powder X-ray diffractometer using CUKΑ radiation. D-spacings are calculated<br>
from the 28 using the wavelength of the Cukα1 radiation of 1.54060 A. The X-ray tube was<br>
operated at a Voltage of 45kV (or 40 kV with X'Pert Instrument), and a current of 45 mA (or<br>
40 mA with X'Pert Instrument). A step size of 0.02°, and a counting time of 2.4 s per step is<br>
applied. Generally, 2θ values are within an error of ±0.1-0.2°. The experimental error on the<br>
d-spacing values is therefore dependent on the peak location.<br><br>
TG-FTIR: Thermogravimetric measurements are carried out with a Netzsch Thermo-Micro-<br>
balance TG 209 coupled to a Bruker FT1R Spectrometer Vector 22 (sample pans with a<br>
pinhole, N2 atmosphere, heating rate 10 K/min).<br>
Raman spectroscopy: FT-Raman spectra are recorded on a Bruker RFS 100 FT-Raman<br>
system with a near infrared Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm and a liquid nitrogen-cooled<br>
germanium detector. For each sample, 64 scans with a resolution of 2 cm-1 are accumula-<br>
ted. Generally, 300 mW laser power is used.<br>
