				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, relates to a Hybrid-TV model, wherein more than one type of interface is present to push the TV content into the consumer's home. The invention describes a method for optimizing these services related to TV content, thus enriching the user experience. More particularly the present invention relates to an optimized method for deploying the Hybrid-TV system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In order to comprehend the present state of art, extracts from patent publication US6459427 are incorporated wherein a one-way broadcasting system comprising a headend system architecture adapted to receive data from the Internet and transmit the data through a digital TV network to receivers, a mapping function for mapping the Internet data to MPEG streams, a combining function for combining the Internet data streams with digital video streams, a broadcast function for broadcasting Web content to users throughout the one way network; a linking function for linking the Internet data with digital video channels; and a navigation function for navigating broadcast data in the one way network is described. The said patent further describes a method for providing Internet data over a digital TV network. Content available on Internet which is related to broadcast video streams is received. The received content is linked to the video streams and transmitted to the TV device simultaneously with the video streams.<br><br>
Patent publication US20050193425 describes a method for delivery and presentation of content-relevant information associated with frames in an AV program enables TV viewers to retrieve information on the contents (for example, objects, items, concepts and the like) associated with a frame or a set of frames (video segments) when they watch TV or video programs. The information relevant to frame(s) is delivered to a STB or DVR by third-party service providers through back channels such as the Internet if the information of how to accurately access the frames pointed by STB users are delivered to the service providers, and the content-relevant information may be presented in the form of a GUI for the TV viewer. The said patent describes a method for providing information related to segments of a TV program video along with the video. The content related information for specific segments or frames of a TV program is obtained from the Internet or other third-party sources. The related information is synchronized with the corresponding segment or frames and is presented simultaneously to the user.<br>
Research paper titled "Using Metadata to provide scalable broadcast and internet content and services" describes a method for synchronization and presentation of content-related metadata with digital TV broadcast. Multimedia content and related information is obtained from multiple sources and combined for display on user terminals.<br>
The concept of obtaining content from multiple channels including broadcast and broadband for presentation on digital TV has been disclosed in patent publication<br><br>
numbers US6459427 and US20050193425, and said research paper. But this content when obtained to the user is coming as part of a single source (MPEG transport stream itself). The feature of presenting the broadcast program and the related content simultaneously has been disclosed in these publications too, but all of this happens within a single stream itself unlike the combination of two independent streams of content, which gets merged on a user-end device as disclosed in this invention. The concept of pre-fetching the broadband data based on user preferences has not been disclosed in these publications, as they are all part of a single stream itself and hence do not need it at all. The concept of synchronization of related content with broadcast program has been disclosed in the patent publication US20050193425, but this synchronization is different compared to this invention as it is just a single broadcast service provider sending all data together, unlike two different data sources landing on a single client device. The concept of tracking parts of broadcast data for synchronization with the broadband data, and the concept of converting EPG timeline to the local timeline have not been identified in the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are some proposals in the DVB standardization related to this topic -Hybrid-TV systems. The invention proposed herein is an optimized mechanism for the functioning of managing content in Hybrid-TV model through a hybrid device. There  have  been  discussions  in  the  DVB's  IPTV subgroup  regarding  the<br><br>
provisioning of broadcast along with a broadband connection providing content parallelly into consumer's homes in the recent weeks. This also opens up newer opportunities for an effective content transmission into the homes.<br>
This invention describes a method for managing content in Hybrid-TV model through a hybrid device. A Broadcast Service Provider (BC-SP) broadcasts programs for the TV users. Content related to the broadcasted programs is available with a Broadband Service Provider (BB-SP). A user selects one or more programs for viewing from the schedule provided by the BC-SP. The related content available with the BB-SP is chosen according to the user preferences and is downloaded by the hybrid device. Then, the downloaded content is played with the broadcast TV program synchronously.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for managing content in Hybrid-TV model for plurality of users through a hybrid device in a TV network comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	storing user profile for each TV user on the hybrid device;<br>
(b)	broadcasting programs for the TV users by a BC-SP;<br>
(c)	selecting at least one program for viewing from a first schedule (EPG)<br>
provided by the BC-SP;<br>
(d)	selecting the related content - related to the broadcast program - offered<br>
by BB-SP, which could be viewed from a second schedule (BCG) for a<br>
future broadcast program (from BC-SP);<br><br>
(e)	pre-fetching &amp; storing related content provided by the BB-SP, and selected<br>
by the user; and<br>
(f)	rendering  the  stored  content along  with  the  associated  broadcasting<br>
program synchronously.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

Figure 1 depicts the deployment scenario of a Hybrid-TV system, consisting of two service providers - Broadcast &amp; Broadband according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to<br><br>
provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention relates to the field of television (TV) broadcast. More specifically, the invention relates to the field of Hybrid-TV model, wherein, more than one medium is used to provide TV content to a user. The invention describes a method for managing content in Hybrid-TV model through a device providing hybrid interfaces. A Broadcast Service Provider (BC-SP) broadcasts programs for the TV users. Content related to the broadcasted programs is available with a BroadBand Service Provider (BB-SP). A user selects one or more programs for viewing from the schedule provided by the BC-SP. The related content available with the BB-SP is chosen according to the user preferences and is downloaded by the hybrid device, prior to the schedule when the program is broadcast. This downloaded content is rendered along with the live TV program being broadcast, and the device is expected to synchronize appropriately.<br>
This invention is centered on the process of optimizing the content flowing from the BB-SP to the Hybrid-TV device.<br>
A hybrid device could possibly be a PVR (or a Residential Gateway like device) having capabilities to "store" data and having following external interfaces -<br><br>
broadcast connectivity for handling the Digital-TV (DTV) transport stream &amp; the other for a broadband connectivity for the Internet data.<br>
DTV connection could possibly be from either of the traditional forms - cable, satellite, terrestrial, etc., shown here as being provided by the BC-SP.<br>
Broadband connection could provide data over the Internet, shown here as being provided by the BB-SP. The data we are referring here is bearing relation with the content broadcast by the BC-SP. We could assume that the BB-SP could have an understanding with the BC-SP for obtaining details about its future programs for an effective deployment of his services.<br>
Could also be that BB-SP has a wide content database that's always made available, and intelligent enough to synchronize to the content broadcast by the BC-SP.<br>
A BC-SP usually plans his list of programs to broadcast well in advance, and publishes an Electronic Program Guide (EPG), and similarly the BB-SP shall do using a Broadband Content Guide (BCG). Or it could happen that the EPG service is also being provided by the BB-SP itself (prevalent in some regions of the world) Wherein he could enhance the guide along with added services into a single entity).<br><br>
The consumer of the hybrid device (a TV-Viewer) is assumed to store his profile on it. He is expected to do this when he installs the device for the first time (multi-user capabilities may also be configured on this device for multiple users in the home). The advantage then being that the BCG services could appropriately highlight based on these preferences only, and avoid the complete list itself providing simplicity and ease of operation to the consumer.<br>
Or it could happen that although these two guides - EPG &amp; BCG - arrive separately on to the device, the device has capabilities to merge them into one appropriately and present it as a unified one to the user.<br>
Although we've suggested that the user profile has been set by the user initially, it could also be derived by the hybrid device intelligently as well, depending on the programs viewed by the user over a period of time.<br>
Consumer shall be accessing these guides to plan for the programs he/she would like to watch in advance (EPGs usually carry program information being broadcast by the BC-SP for the next one week).<br>
User previews the EPG and "selects" one or more programs that he'd be watching in the future, which could be from any of the various channels provided by the BC-SP. These programs from EPG could also be of varying timelines based on the region BC-SP is located - the hybrid device shall have necessary intelligence to<br><br>
convert these timelines into the local time of the consumer in order to maintain a common baseline on the hybrid device.<br>
Programs selected by the user from EPG, could have "parallel services" being provided - which could be viewed on the BCG. Parallel services here mean all those services which have a correlation with the TV's video content broadcast by the BC-SP, such as the audio, text, etc.<br>
Parallel services selected by the user shall be "pre-fetched" before this content is broadcast onto the consumer's hybrid device.<br>
The pre-fetch here becomes useful because the latencies on the broadband side aren't very predictable (at this point in time), and the user certainly needs perfect synchronization between both services coming from BC-SP &amp; BB-SP in order to enjoy the content completely. Else having situations with even a slight delay could spoil the user's experience of a TV program.<br>
It is important that the BB-SP has perfect knowledge of all the TV programs broadcast by the BC-SP, for their content-level synchronization. And the device's clock should always be synchronized to the BC-SP's clock (this information is available as part of this transport stream's content).<br>
The content from the BC-SP could contain advertisements (or similar information) within the content being broadcast. And when such content is observed - which<br><br>
probably may not be serviced by the BB-SP's pre-fetched content - they need to be "tracked" (perhaps using an eventing mechanism) by the hybrid device. At this point of time the pre-fetched content from BB-SP needs to "pause" for a defined interval, and continue once the advertisement is completed to continue its content-level synchronization.<br>
To better illustrate the above, let's assume that we have a BC-SP transmitting content supporting languages A &amp; B on its audio for that particular selected program. But if the user happens to be one who understands only language C. This information about the user shall be known to the device, from the user's profile it maintains. The device could then pre-fetch this form of audio content before the user actually watches this TV content &amp; store it on the hybrid device.<br>
We could have many extensions for the above, but here we are only trying to bring about the importance of "pre-fetch for a guaranteed synchronization of data from different sources". Audio was taken as an example only for illustration. This could apply for any data like subtitles, etc., i.e. for any content from BC-SP having a "correlation" with the BB-SP's content.<br>
This above scenario works well for "pre-recorded content", and perhaps not suitable for live broadcasts, as we assume that the BB-SP always provides a facility to pre-fetch data before the actual broadcast.<br><br>
Figure 1 depicts the deployment scenario of a Hybrid-TV system, consisting of two service providers - over the Broadcast &amp; Broadband mode respectively.<br>
A consumer can store his information on the hybrid device as part of the user profile. The BC-SP has a first schedule (EPG) associated with the timelines of the various programs it broadcasts. The BB-SP uses a second schedule (BCG) for indicating the timelines of the supported broadband programs which is correlated with the broadcast content. The hybrid device can convert the first schedule (EPG) and second schedule (BCG) timelines into a local time of the user in order to maintain a common baseline on the hybrid device. This related content which is selected by the user shall be pre-fetched before the content is broadcast onto the consumer's hybrid device. The first schedule (EPG) and the second schedule (BCG) can be made to synchronize for perfect viewing of the program. The first schedule (EPG) and the second schedule (BCG) can be integrated if the first schedule also comes from the BB-SP itself or if the device is intelligent to do so. The first schedule (EPG) content can be pre-selected by the user in advance, notifying the BB-SP about the user's choices. Based on the user's profile the content shall be pre-fetched from BB-SP onto the hybrid device. The pre-fetched content becomes operational when the program selected is broadcast from the BC-SP, and the pre-fetched content gets synchronized automatically for the same. If the first schedule (EPG) is available from the BC-SP, the hybrid device checks the availability of related content from BB-SP, which is done, based on the user's profile (which was initially configured by the user in the hybrid device). The second schedule (BCG) can provide the TV programs information also. A clock<br><br>
provided in the hybrid device shall be synchronized with the clock information provided by the BC-SP in its transport stream, for the pre-fetched content to play in synchronization with the BC-SP's broadcast content. The hybrid device shall pause the BB-SP content at specific intervals where the said broadcast program is interrupted (advertisements for example), where no related content was previously pre-fetched perhaps.<br>
The BroadBand Service Provider (BB-SP) shall provide "parallel services" for the programs broadcast by the Broadcast Service Provider (BC-SP). This shall be "reflected" in the Broadband Content Guide (BCG) offered by BB-SP.<br>
The Electronic Program Guide (EPG) content shall be pre-selected by the consumer in advance, for notifying the BB-SP about these choices. Based on these choices the content is "pre-fetched" from BB-SP into the hybrid device. This pre-fetched content becomes operational when the program selected is available from the BC-SP, and synchronizes itself.<br>
If the EPG is available from the BC-SP, the hybrid device shall check the availability of parallel service(s) from BB-SP. This shall be done based on the user's profile, which shall be initially configured by the user when he/she installs the hybrid device. Or the BCG could as well give the TV programs information.<br>
The clock of the hybrid device is synchronized with the clock information provided by the BC-SP. This is important for pre-fetched content to play in sync with the<br><br>
BC-SP's broadcast content.<br>
Advertisements coming in as part of the content from the BC-SP may not have an equivalent content provided by the BB-SP, and the hybrid device shall provide the necessary intelligence to pause the BB-SP content at these points for specified intervals.<br>
Note: In the above points it is attempted to use the terms user, consumer &amp; viewer interchangeably. So are the terms parallel &amp; related, services from the BB-SP.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
