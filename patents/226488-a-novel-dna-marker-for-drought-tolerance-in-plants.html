				<td>Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a novel DNA marker for drought tolerance in plants<br>
Beckground of the Invention<br>
In plants DNA markers are conventionally developed using homogenous mapping<br>
population. This is impractical where the repreductive phase cycle is long-<br>
Developmant of trail-ralated DNA marker in planta have been done in<br>
homogenous breeding populations (real leoganic lines-RIL/near isoganic Iines-<br>
NIL) focucing on trait-related physiological parameters. This ia a time consuming<br>
process, taking many years for development of RILs and NILs. Further correlation<br>
with any one phenotypic parameters often would not give a DNA marker that<br>
could ba directly correlated with a quantitative trail.<br>
Most of tha markers for drought tolerance known till data exhibit correlation with<br>
one or another physiolosical parameter associated with the trail. The different<br>
phenotypes focused on are ueually ecosystem spacific and thus would not be<br>
useful for rapid and precise assessment/screening gamplasm in laboratory<br>
plants.<br><br><br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
An object of this invention is to establish a novel DNA marker for drought<br>
tolerance in plants.<br>
A further object of this invention it to propose a DNA marker for precise selection<br>
in the laboratory of plants for ecosystem specific cultivation.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a DNA marker for developing<br>
improved varieties through plant breeding for drought tolerance.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a DNA marker for rapid diagnosis of<br>
drought tolerance trail in plants.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a DNA marker useful in<br>
identification of genes for plant transformation in developing improved varieties.<br>
Brief description of the invention<br>
According to this invention there is provided a novel DNA marker for drought<br>
tolerance in plants comprising of an amplified fragment of 1400bp.<br><br>
In accordance to this invention there is provided a method for developing a DNA<br>
marker for drought tolerance comprising extracting ganomic DNA from frozen<br>
young leaves, subjecting the DNA thus obtained to the step of calibration,<br>
subjecting tha calibrated DNA to the step of analysis. Clening tha analyzed DNA<br>
fragment sequencing tha DNA fragment to obtain tha DNA marker.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
Tha process undertaken to establish this DNA marker to novel in that it developed<br>
through correlation with trail-specific precise and rapidly accessed biochemical<br>
marker. With the use of this novel, non-obvious, inventive process, a DNA marker<br>
for drought tolerance has been established.<br>
GENOMIC DNA EXTRACTION:<br>
200mg of frozan young leaves were used for DNA isolation. Tha CTAB<br>
(cetyltrimethylemmonium bromide) method was employed to extract DNA and on<br>
an average 20μg of DNA was obtained. After agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA<br>
was calibrated on tha basis of ethidium bromide fluorescence using defined<br>
amount of DNA at standard<br><br>
RAPD STUDIES<br>
For Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, DNA of young<br>
leaves from each clone was used as template in the PCR reaction nature of<br>
total volume 25μl, conteining 26 μm dNTPs, 40ng primer and 0.3μl Taq DNA<br>
polymerase. The reaction was allowed for 45 cycles under 36° C annealing<br>
temperature. PCR products obtaimed using eleven random decamer primers such<br>
at OPAB06, OPAB18, OPAH18, OPAH02, OPAB17, OPAC19, OPAH12,<br>
OPAL04, OPAA02, OPAG13 and OPAL08, were separated on 1.2% agarose gel<br>
and visuallized over UV Iight in pretence of ethidium bromide. RAPD analysis of<br>
randomly selected plants within each clonal propagation confirmed the genetic<br>
uniformly of plants within each clonal plot (data not pretented). For use in the<br>
present study a comparative analysis obtained short listed (on the basis of<br>
drought tolerance / susceptibility) clones were undertaken. For use in the present<br>
study a comparative analysis of 10 short-listed (on the basis of drought tolerance<br>
/ susceptibility) clones was undertaken. This RAPO study was repeated (for each<br>
set of 10 clones), with leaves collected from randomly selected plants within each<br>
clonal plot. Representative gel images of RAPO pattern to shown in Figure 1a.<br>
Figure 1b shows the RAPD pattern with the tame primer on genomes of 4 clones<br>
(that are also present in Figure 1a) that exhibit drought tolerance in the field<br>
(Figrue 1b was not used for scoring RAPD bands).<br><br><br>
Primers used In the RAPD study, total number of RAPD bands observed through<br>
all the 10 clones, total number of monomophic / polymorphic bands present and<br>
percentage of polymorphic bands obtained are given in table 1.<br>
Stress related bozyme activity:<br>
Detached (water stressed), young tea leaves were extracted in extraction buffer<br>
and the extracts were run on non-denaturing gets. Activity of enzymes was<br>
studied by allowing the reaction of iso-enzyme in gets by immersing the gel in<br>
appropriate reaction mixture, followed by stopping enzyme activity by immensing<br>
gel in appropriate staining solution.<br>
SOD and APX activity:<br>
Isolated leaves were homogenized in 50mM Pottasium phosphate (pH-7.8)<br>
buffers for SOD (EC 1.15.1.1) and in 100mM Sodium Phosphate (pH. 7.8) buffer<br>
for APX (EC 1.11.1.11). Enzyme activities in the extract was visualizad on non-<br>
denaturing activity gel (12% polyacrylamide) after electrophoretic separation<br>
folowed by immesing the gel in appropriate staining solution.<br>
Elecrophoretically separated SOD isozymes were visualized by reduction of Nitro<br>
Blue Tetrezolium (NBT) by O2 generated in reaction between N,N,N1,N1-tetra<br>
methylethylem diamine (TEMED) and Riboflavin. Bands representing the<br>
isozymes remain colorless due to absence of O2 that had been scavenged by<br>
isozyme activity; rest of the gel was stained blue<br><br><br>
due to reduced NBT. Doneltometric scant (at 992.8 nm) of negatively stained<br>
isozyme activity bands is shown in Figure 2a.<br>
The APX activity gal staining was similar accepting that insteed of ribeflavin, H2O2<br>
and Atcorbate were used to ganarate O2. Negative staining of isozyme bands is<br>
documantad in a gal doc apparatus (image Master VDS, Phannacis Biotech).<br>
The negatively stained isozoma activity bands scanned at 632.8 nm; a<br>
rapresentative picture of the denstiometric scans is shown in Figura 2b.<br><br>
Ragrassion analysis was conducted using data of isozyme study (of SOD and<br>
APX) and RAPD bands. Association of RAPD markers with 800 activity and APX<br>
activity were investigated using multiple ragrassion analysis approach. Enzyme<br>
activities viz. of appropriate Suboxide dismuiase (800) and APX isozyme (peak<br>
area) were treated as dapandant variables and the various RAPD bands (Scored<br>
as 1 for presence of band and 0 for absence) were treated as independent<br>
variables. The regression analysis was based on the modal<br><br><br><br>
Where Y to the enzymatic tralt, in the RAPD marker, b the partial<br>
regression coefficient, d the between accesaion residual which is left after<br>
regression. Extant of association batween tha RAPD bands and copperzine<br>
superoxide diamutase (Cu-Zn SOD) and Atcorbate Poroxidase (APX) (band II)<br>
activites are shown in Table2.<br>
Tha sequence for this marker is being submitted for patenting. The marker could<br>
be utilized for selection of appropriate genotypes (a) for ecosystem specific<br>
cultivation (b) for developing improved varieties through plant breeding/plant<br>
transformation endeavours.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Taa clones, reported to be tolerant /sensetive to drought (on tha basis of field<br>
performance) where selected for this study<br>
• Tea clones of Darjeeling used in establishing (through RAPO and isozyme<br>
studies correlated with information on field studies) a precise DNA marker in the<br>
present study use:<br>
RR17/144, T246, CPI, TV26, TV 25, B777, AV2, K1/1, B688, T78 (all Darjeeling<br>
tea clones).<br>
• Tea clones used for validating (through RAPD studies correlated with field<br>
studies) that the established DNA marker is associated with drought tolerance<br><br><br>
in other tea clones viz the Assam tea clones:<br>
TV1, TV2, TV14, TV17, TV20, TV30 (All Assam tea clones)<br>
Leaves from plants of each of the clones listed above were collected from Ging<br>
Tea Estate, Darjeeling, and from Tea Research Association (TRA), Assam.<br>
For enzyme studies, freshly detached leaves (from the Darjeeling clones) were<br>
used for extraction within 24h.<br>
Tea plants art perennial and have long reproductive cycles. Thus for rapid<br>
avaiblebility of uniform raw material (i.e. fresh tea leaf) vegetatively propagated tea<br>
clones constitute the plant population for use in the tea industry. In such<br>
populations, linkage study through final generations is time consuming. Under<br>
such circumstances, developing DNA markers through association studies<br>
supported by regression analysis between DNA fingerprinting pattern and precise<br>
biochemical parameters of the desired phenotypic tralt in plants belonging to a<br>
narrow gone pool, could provide an useful allernative.<br>
Cell protective enzymes, specifically Cu-Zn cytosolic superoxide dismutase<br>
(SOD) and ascordate peroxedase (APX), have been reported to be correlated with<br>
drought tolerance in plants. In this study, an attempt has boon mode to establish<br>
DNA markers associated with drought tolerance in tea plants through use of<br>
regression analysis involving RAPD pattern and drought-specific isozyme activity.<br>
Fig 1a and Figure 1b shows RAPD patterns of toa clones used in establishing<br>
the DNA marker. Reproductibility of data was confirmed after observing identical<br><br><br>
fingarprinting patterns in 3 report experiments. A similar approach in<br>
demonstrating reproductibility in RAPD studies have also been reported earlier.<br>
Use of eleven primers in RAPD studies on 10 clanes revealed 180 PCR bands;<br>
among these 131 bands (i.e. 69.87% of total 180 amplified fragments) were<br>
polymorphic (table 1). This shows that the RAPD method it capable of revesting<br>
appraciable levels of polymorphism in tea plant germplesm.<br>
Bearing in mind that polymorphic markers generated from tha fingarprinting<br>
pattern of plants belonging to a narrow gana pool rapresent independent<br>
characters for specific trails, an attempt was made to develop drought tolerance-<br>
associated molecular (DMA) marker(s) using correlative studies between RAPD<br>
(ganoma) analysis and activity of drought specific isozymes. For this a study<br>
was made between easily scorable RAPD (dominant) markers and biochemical<br>
parameters (viz SOD and APX activity) of drought tolerance in pients.<br>
Activity of stress-related cell-protective enzymes has been reviewed at length.<br>
Cytosolic Cu-Zn SOD and APX are known to be associated with drought stress in<br>
plants. Isozyme marker based assessment for drought tolerance in the clones<br>
under study was mada by assessing activity of SOD and APX isozymes.<br>
Densitiomatric scan of the activity gel of SOD (Figure 2a) shows 4 major peaks;<br>
tha peak at about 29kD (band IV) represents the Cu-Zn SOD. This peak was<br>
found to show higher activity (peak area above 100 mm2) in clones RR17/144,<br>
CP1, TV26 and AV2 compared to tha area under peak IV in T24S, TV26, B777,<br><br><br>
K1/1, B688, T78 (peek araa below 70 mm3). The suggests that clones RR17/144,<br>
CP1, TV26 and AV2 possess the drought tolerant tralt.<br>
Cultivars of Nicotiena tabacum with high drought tolerance show highest<br>
aecorbate peroxidase activity. My data of APX activity fig. (2b) in drought<br>
stressed leaf (of tea) from non-daneturing polyacryamide gel electrophoresis<br>
study ravealed by NBT staining 2 isozyme bands, ona of these, namely APX II,<br>
was found to be a monomer with molacutar weight of about 29kD and the other at<br>
about 40 Kd (APX band 1). In densilometric scane of the activity gels (Fig. 2b),<br>
the 2 bands are represented as 2 peaks at about 40 KD (APX band I) and at<br>
about 29 kD (APX band II). The isozyme peak at about 29kD (APX II)<br>
exhibited particularly high activity in clones RR17/144, CP1, TV26, AV2 (peak<br>
area above 90 mm2); T246, TV25, B777, K1/1, B688, T78 exhibited lower activity<br>
(peak area below 50 mm2). It may be noted that the clones that showed high<br>
APXII activity (Figure 2b) also showed high Cu-Zn SOD activity (Figure 2a).<br>
These clones also appear drought tolerant from field performance data.<br>
Association studies between RAPD bands and trails of interest have been<br>
reported. For precision in establishment of trait-related DNA markers, have used<br>
RAPD analysis of highly diverse accessions of rice in muliple regression analysis<br>
to determine associations between the DMA merker(s) and quantitative traits, in<br>
the present study regression analysis (Table 2) in represent was undertaken to<br>
determine the association of specific isozyme activity peak areas as dependent<br>
variables and RAPD band (s) (Figure 1a) score as independent variables. Step-<br><br><br>
wise regression showed that the RAPO band (at 1400 bp) obtained with OPAH02<br>
primer has a highly significant regression coefficient for Cu/Zn SOD activity<br>
(b=0.970) and for APX II activity (b-0.968). Using Fisher's exact test (F-test) the<br>
association between Cu/Zn SOD and APX II and tha RAPO band of 1400 bp wat<br>
found to be significant at 99.9% confidence. Being associated win clones<br>
exhibiting high activity of drought tolarance-specific iaozymes this DNA band<br>
(marker) could be used in germplasm screening for drought tolarance in tea<br>
piants. This brand at 1400 bp is marked win an arrow in Fig 1a and 1b.<br>
Validation studias in date shown in RAPD patterns reveals that the same primer,<br>
viz AP0H02,)amplified a DNA fragment of 1400bp also in some Assam tea plants<br>
(marked with an arrow -Fig 3a and 3b)<br>
This band at 1400 bp is now being further characterized<br>
The DNA fragment has been further checked for its validity in other randomly<br>
selected tea plants including some Assam tea clones.<br>
Velidation studies till date shown in RAPO patterns reveals that the same primer,<br>
viz AP0H02, amplified a DNA fragment of 1400bp also in some Assam tea plants<br>
(marked win an arrow -Fig 3a and 3b)<br><br>
