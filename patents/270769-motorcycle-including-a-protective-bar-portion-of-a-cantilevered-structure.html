This application claims priority from Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2007-284224 filed on October 31, 2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to shapes of a rear side<br>
cover arranged on a rear portion of a motorcycle and a glove<br>
bar grasped by a fellow passenger.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
There are known motorcycles comprising a pair of body<br>
frames extending in a longitudinal direction of a vehicle and<br>
a seat, for a fellow passenger, arranged on the body frames.<br>
Some ones among the motorcycles comprise rear side covers that<br>
cover both body frames from outward in a vehicle width direction<br>
in order to improve a vehicle in outward appearance and style,<br>
the rear side covers being formed to project outward in the<br>
vehicle width direction (see WO2005-002954).<br>
However, there is caused a problem that such rear side<br>
covers projecting outward are susceptible to damage upon<br>
collision against a passenger and other things.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention has been thought of in view of the problem<br><br>
described above and has its object to provide a motorcycle<br>
capable of preventing damage to rear side covers.<br>
In order to solve such problem, a motorcycle according<br>
to the invention comprises a pair of body frames extending in<br>
a longitudinal direction of a vehicle, a fellow passenger seat<br>
arranged on the pair of body frames, a rear side cover that<br>
covers either of the body frames from outward in a vehicle width<br>
direction, and a glove bar fixed to at least either one of the<br>
body frames and grasped by a fellow passenger seated on the<br>
fellow passenger seat. The glove bar comprises a support<br>
portion fixed to the body frames to extend outward in the<br>
vehicle width direction and above the rear side cover, a grip<br>
supported by the support portion to extend rearwardly of the<br>
fellow passenger seat and grasped by the fellow passenger, and<br>
a protective bar portion of a cantilevered structure supported<br>
by a portion of the support portion positioned above the rear<br>
side cover to extend toward the front of a vehicle and above<br>
the rear side cover to protect the rear side cover.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to prevent<br>
damage to a rear side cover. Also, since the protective bar<br>
portion is of a cantilevered structure, it is possible to<br>
protect the rear side cover without considerably modifying the<br>
construction of general rear side covers, body frames, or the<br>
like. For example, it is possible to support the protective<br>
bar portion without the provision of any bracket or the like,<br><br>
which supports a tip end of the protective bar portion, on the<br>
body frame.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
An embodiment of the invention will be described below<br>
with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 is a side view showing<br>
a motorcycle 1 according to an embodiment of the invention and<br>
Fig. 2 is a plan view showing the motorcycle 1. Also, Fig.<br>
3 is a side view showing a rear portion of the motorcycle 1<br>
and Fig. 4 is a plan view showing the rear portion of the<br>
motorcycle 1.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 or 2, the motorcycle 1 comprises a<br>
front wheel 3, a rear wheel 4, a seat 5, an engine 10, a body<br>
frame 20, a glove bar 40, and a pair of left and right, rear<br>
side covers 30, 30. Also, the body frame 20 comprises a head<br>
pipe 21, a pair of left and right, main frames 22,, 22, and a<br>
pair of left and right seat rails 23, 23. Further, the body<br>
frame 20 comprises a left, back stay 24 and a right, back stay.<br>
In addition, Fig. 1 or 3 shows only the back stay 24 on the<br>
left in a vehicle traveling direction (direction indicated by<br>
Fr in the figures).<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the head pipe 21 is arranged at a<br>
front end of the body frame 2 0 to support a steering shaft 6<br>
rotatably. An upper portion of the steering shaft 6 is<br>
connected to a handle 8, which is arranged to extend in a vehicle<br>
width direction (direction indicated by W in Fig. 2 or 4) to<br>
change a direction of the front wheel 3, through two brackets<br>
7, 7 aligned vertically. A front fork 9 is connected to a lower<br><br>
portion of the steering shaft 6. An axle shaft of the front<br>
wheel 3 is supported by the front fork 9.<br>
Front ends of the main frames 22, 22 are connected to<br>
the head pipe 21. As shown in Fig. 2, the main frames 22, 22<br>
extend rearward (an opposite direction to a direction<br>
indicated by Fr in Figs. 1 to 4) from front ends thereof and<br>
spread outward in the vehicle width direction. Also, as shown<br>
in Fig. 1, the main frames 22 extend obliquely downward toward<br>
the rear of a vehicle body and are bent downward midway thereof.<br>
Front ends of the seat rails 23 are connected to the main frames<br>
22	and the seat rails 23 extend obliquely upward toward the<br>
rear of a vehicle body from the front ends to support the seat<br>
5 arranged thereabove. Front ends of the back stays 24,<br>
respectively, are connected to the main frames 22. Positions,<br>
in which the back stays 24 and the main frames 22 are connected<br>
to each other, are lower than those, in which the seat rails<br>
23	and the main frames 22 are connected to each other, and the<br>
back stays 24 extend obliquely upward toward the rear of a<br>
vehicle body from the positions of connection. Rear ends of<br>
the back stays are connected to the seat rails 23.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the engine 10 is arranged below the<br>
main frames 22 and suspended by the main frame 22. The rear<br>
wheel 4 is arranged on the rear of a vehicle body and positioned<br>
below the seat 5. Also, the rear wheel 4 is supported by a<br>
rear arm 11, which is arranged to extend in a longitudinal<br><br>
direction. A front end of the rear arm 11 is mounted to a pivot<br>
shaft 12 supported by the main frames 22, so that the rear wheel<br>
4 swings vertically about the pivot shaft 12 according to road<br>
surface irregularities. A driving force output from the<br>
engine 10 is transmitted to the rear wheel 4 through a chain<br>
(not shown).<br>
The seat 5 is a so-called double seat to include a front<br>
seat 5a for a driver who operates the handle 8, etc. and a rear<br>
seat 5b for a fellow passenger who is present behind the driver<br>
to ride the motorcycle 1. The front seat 5a and the rear seat<br>
5b are contiguous to each other in a state of being aligned<br>
in a longitudinal direction. Also, the rear seat 5b is<br>
provided in a higher position than that of the front seat 5a.<br>
An explanation will be given to the rear side covers 30,<br>
30. Fig. 5 is a cross sectional view showing the rear side<br>
cover 30, the seat rail 23, and the back stay 24 and taken along<br>
the line V-V in Fig. 3. In addition, since the rear side cover<br>
30 provided on the left of a vehicle body and the rear side<br>
cover 30 provided on the right of a vehicle body interpose<br>
therebetween a center line passing through a center of a vehicle<br>
body and are constructed in bilateral symmetry, an explanation<br>
will be given taking, as an example, the rear side cover 30<br>
on the left.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the rear side cover 30 is provided<br>
below the seat 5 to adjoin the seat 5 as viewed from laterally<br><br>
of a vehicle. The rear side cover 30 extends longitudinally<br>
along the seat rail 23 and the back stay 24 outwardly of the<br>
seat rail 23 and the back stay 24 in the vehicle width direction.<br>
The rear side cover 30 covers the seat rail 23 and the back<br>
stay 24 from outward in the vehicle width direction. The rear<br>
side cover 30 is formed from, for example, a resin. Also, the<br>
rear side cover 30 is mounted to, for example, the seat rails<br>
23 and supported by the seat rails 23 outwardly thereof.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 5, the rear side cover 30 is shaped<br>
to project outward in the vehicle width direction from an edge<br>
5c of the seat 5 in the vehicle width direction. That is, an<br>
upper edge 30a of the rear side cover 30 is positioned between<br>
the edge 5c of the seat 5 and the seat rails 23. The rear side<br>
cover 30 extends outward in the vehicle width direction from<br>
the upper edge 30a and is bent at an edge 30b to be directed<br>
toward a center in the vehicle width direction. The lower edge<br>
30c of the rear side cover 30 is positioned below the back stays<br>
24.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 4, a rear edge 30e, positioned<br>
on the rear of a vehicle body, out of the edge 30b is positioned<br>
outwardly of the rear seat 5b in the vehicle width direction.<br>
A distance between the rear edge 30e and the edge 5c of the<br>
rear seat 5b increases as it goes forward and a front end 30d<br>
of the rear edge 30e is positioned most away from the edge 5c.<br>
The front end 30d is positioned outwardly of a front end 5d<br><br>
of the rear seat 5b in the vehicle width direction. Also, as<br>
shown in Fig. 2, a footrest 13, on which a fellow passenger<br>
seated on the rear seat 5b puts a foot, is provided below the<br>
front end 30d. A front edge 30f, positioned on the front of<br>
a vehicle body, out of the edge 30b extends from the front end<br>
30d toward the front of a vehicle body and toward a center in<br>
the vehicle width direction.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the left and right, rear side covers<br>
30, 30, respectively, extend rearward beyond a rear edge 5e<br>
of the seat 5. A tail cowl 31 positioned rearwardly of the<br>
seat 5 bridges between rear ends 30g, 30g of the rear side covers<br>
30, 30. An outer surface of the tail cowl 31 is made smoothly<br>
contiguous to outer surfaces of the rear ends 30g without the<br>
generation of steps between it and outer surfaces of the rear<br>
side covers 30.<br>
An explanation will be given to the glove bar 40. Fig.<br>
6 is a side view showing the glove bar 40 mounted to the seat<br>
rails 23, 23 and Fig. 7 is a plan view showing the glove bar<br>
40 mounted to the seat rails 23, 23. Also, Fig. 8 is a cross<br>
sectional view taken along the line VIII-VIII in Fig. 4, Fig.<br>
9 is a cross sectional view showing the glove bar 40 and taken<br>
along the line IX-IX in Fig. 7, and Fig. 10 is a cross sectional<br>
view showing the glove bar 40 and taken along the line X-X in<br>
Fig. 7.<br>
The glove bar 40 is grasped by a fellow passenger seated<br><br>
on the rear seat 5b whereby the fellow passenger is made stable<br>
in a ride posture. As shown in Fig. 7, the glove bar 40 has<br>
a shape of bilateral symmetry to interpose therebetween a<br>
center line passing through a center of a vehicle body and<br>
includes a support portion 41, a pair of left and right grips<br>
42,	42, and a pair of left and right protective bar portions<br>
43,	43. The support portion 41, the grips 42, 42, and the<br>
protective bar portions 43, 43 are molded integrally.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the support portion 41 is fixed to<br>
the left and right seat rails 23, 23, respectively. In an<br>
example illustrated herein, the support portion 41 includes<br>
a pair of left and right fixed portions 41a, 41a positioned<br>
below the rear seat 5b (see Fig. 4). The right fixed portion<br>
41a is fixed to the right seat rail 23 by two bolts 44, 44 and<br>
the left fixed portion 41a is fixed to the left seat rail 23<br>
by two bolts 44, 44.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, 7, or 9, the fixed portions 41a are<br>
plate-shaped to extend forward from the support portion 41.<br>
The fixed portions 41a, respectively, are formed with two mount<br>
holes 41b, 41b. Plate-shaped brackets 23a, 23a having<br>
surfaces in parallel to a direction, in which the seat rails<br>
23, 23 extend, are joined to outer peripheral surfaces of the<br>
seat rails 23, 23. The brackets 23a, respectively, are formed<br>
with two mount holes 23b, 23b. The bolts 44, 44 are inserted<br>
through the mount holes 23b, 23b and the mount holes 41b, 41b<br><br>
of the fixed portion 41a. In addition, nuts 45, 45 are provided<br>
on the back side of the mount holes 23b, 23b, the nuts 45, 45<br>
being clamped to the bolts 44, 44 on the back side of the mount<br>
holes 23b, 23b (see Fig. 6) .<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the support portion 41 is plate-shaped<br>
and arranged to extend outward (left and right directions) in<br>
the vehicle width direction from a center 41g in a width<br>
direction. As shown in Fig. 4, a front edge 41c of the support<br>
portion 41 is positioned below the rear seat 5b. A rear edge<br>
41d of the support portion 41 is positioned rearwardly of the<br>
rear seat 5b.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, the support portion 41 extends outward<br>
from a center of the vehicle body with ends 41e, 41e thereof<br>
above the rear side covers 30, 30. Also, the ends 41e, 41e<br>
are bent upward above the rear side covers 30, 30.<br>
As shown in Figs. 7 and 9, a projection 41f projecting<br>
upward (toward an underside of the seat 5) and extending in<br>
the vehicle width direction is formed between the rear edge<br>
41d and the front edge 41c of the support portion 41. The<br>
projection 41f is positioned inwardly (forwardly) of the rear<br>
edge 5e of the seat 5 to prevent water, etc. from entering below<br>
the seat 5. Also, as shown in Fig. 9, the front edge 41c of<br>
the support portion 41 is inclined upward.<br>
The grips 42, 42 are rod-shaped and grasped by a fellow<br>
passenger seated on the rear seat 5b. As shown in Fig. 4 or<br><br>
7, the grips 42, 42 are provided on the both ends 41e, 41e of<br>
the support portion 41 to extend rearwardly of the both ends<br>
41e, 41e on the rear side of the rear seat 5b. Also, in an<br>
example described here, the grips 42, 42 extend rearward in<br>
a state of being inclined toward a center in the vehicle width<br>
direction from positions above the rear side cover 30. Rear<br>
ends 42a, 42a thereof are separated from each other in the<br>
vehicle width direction. Also, as shown in Fig. 4, edges 42b,<br>
42b of the grips 42 in the vehicle width direction are<br>
positioned inwardly (forwardly) of an edge 31a of the tail cowl<br>
31 as viewed in plan view of a vehicle body.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 6 or 10, the grips 42 are inclined<br>
so that the rear ends 42a, 42a thereof are higher than a front<br>
side thereof and a distance between lower surfaces 42c of the<br>
grips 42, and an upper surface of the rear side cover 30 and<br>
an upper surface of the tail cowl 31 increases as it goes<br>
rearward. Also, as shown in Fig. 3 or 8, dent portions 30h<br>
dented inward (toward the seat rails 23) are formed on portions<br>
of the rear side cover 30 positioned below the grips 42. As<br>
shown in Fig. 3, the dent portions 30h extend longitudinally<br>
below the grips 42. Thereby, gaps, into which a fellow<br>
passenger put hands when grasping the glove bar 40, are ensured<br>
between the upper surface of the rear side cover 30 or of the<br>
tail cowl 31 and the lower surfaces 42c of the grips 42.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, 7, or 10, the protective bar portions<br><br>
43, 43 extend forward above the rear side cover 30 from the<br>
ends 41e, 41e of the support portion 41 positioned above the<br>
rear side cover 30 to protect the rear side cover 30.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the protective bar portions 43 extend<br>
forward along the upper surface of the rear side cover 30 in<br>
positions spaced slightly upward from the upper surface and<br>
front ends 43a thereof are positioned outwardly of the rear<br>
seat 5b in the vehicle width direction (see Fig. 4). Also,<br>
the protective bar portions 43 are slightly inclined so that<br>
the front ends 43a are close to the upper surface of the rear<br>
side cover 30 as compared with rear portions (toward the ends<br>
41e of the support portion 41) . Also, as shown in Fig. 4, edges<br>
43b, 43b of the protective bar portions 43, 43 in the vehicle<br>
width direction are positioned outwardly of the rear edge 30e<br>
of the rear side cover 30 in the vehicle width direction as<br>
viewed in plan view of a vehicle body.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 7, the protective bar portions<br>
43 extend toward the front of a vehicle in a state of being<br>
inclined outward in the vehicle width direction. Also, the<br>
support portion 41 extends outwardly of the center 41g in the<br>
vehicle width direction in a state of being inclined toward<br>
the front of a vehicle. Thereby, an angle formed between a<br>
direction, in which the support portion 41 extends, and a<br>
direction, in which the protective bar portions 43 extend, is<br>
an obtuse angle α as viewed in plan view of a vehicle body.<br><br>
The protective bar portions 43, 43 are supported in a<br>
cantilevered manner by the ends 41e, 41e of the support portion<br>
41. That is, bases of the protective bar portions 43, 43 are<br>
supported on the ends 41e, 41e of the support portion 41 and<br>
front ends and intermediate portions of the protective bar<br>
portions 43, 43 are not fixed to a member, such as the seat<br>
rails 23, the rear side cover 30, etc., positioned therearound.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig. 10, a plurality (here,<br>
three) of recesses 4 0b opened downward (toward the upper<br>
surface of the rear side cover 30) are formed on the protective<br>
bar portion 43 and the grip 42.<br>
As described above, the motorcycle 1 comprises the pair<br>
of seat rails 23, 23 extending longitudinally of a vehicle,<br>
the seat 5, for fellow passengers, arranged on the pair of seat<br>
rails 23, 23, the rear side covers 30, 30 that cover the seat<br>
rails 23, 23 from outward in the vehicle width direction, and<br>
the glove bar 40 fixed to the seat rails 23, 23 and grasped<br>
by a fellow passenger seated on the seat 5. The glove bar 40<br>
comprises the support portion 41 fixed to the seat rails 23<br>
to extend outward in the vehicle width direction and above the<br>
rear side covers 30, the grips 42 supported by the support<br>
portion 41 to extend rearwardly of the seat 5 and grasped by<br>
a fellow passenger, and the protective bar portions 43 of a<br>
cantilevered structure supported by the ends 41e of the support<br>
portion 41 positioned above the rear side cover 30 and extending<br><br>
toward the front of a vehicle and above the rear side covers<br>
30 to protect the rear side covers 30.<br>
Thereby, it is possible to prevent damage to the rear<br>
side covers 30. Also, since the protective bar portions 43<br>
are of a cantilevered structure, it is possible to protect the<br>
rear side covers without considerably modifying the<br>
construction of general rear side covers, seat rails, or the<br>
like. For example, it is possible to protect the protective<br>
bar portions 43 without the provision of any bracket or the<br>
like, which supports the front ends 43a of the protective bar<br>
portions 43, on the seat rails 23.<br>
Also, with the motorcycle 1, the protective bar portions<br>
43, respectively, are provided on the left and right ends 41e,<br>
41e of the support portion 41. Thereby, it is possible to<br>
prevent damage to the left and right, rear side covers 30.<br>
Also, with the motorcycle 1, the support portion 41<br>
extends outward in the vehicle width direction and is inclined<br>
toward the front of a vehicle and the protective bar portions<br>
43 extend forward from the ends 41e of the support portion 41<br>
and are inclined outward in the vehicle width direction.<br>
Thereby, it is possible to increase that strength, with which<br>
the protective bar portions 43 are supported, as compared with<br>
the case where a direction, in which the support portion 41<br>
extends, and a direction, in which the protective bar portions<br>
43 extend, forms an acute angle therebetween.<br><br>
Also, with the motorcycle 1, the grips 42, respectively,<br>
are provided on the left and right of a vehicle body. Thereby,<br>
a fellow passenger can grasp the glove bar 40 with both hands,<br>
so that it is possible to make the fellow passenger stable in<br>
posture.<br>
Also, with the motorcycle 1, the grips 42, respectively,<br>
are provided on the left and right of a vehicle body and the<br>
rear ends 42a, 42a of the left and right grips 42, 42 are away<br>
from each other. Thereby, it is possible to make a fellow<br>
passenger further stable in posture while making the glove bar<br>
40 light in weight.<br>
Also, with the motorcycle 1, the left and right grips<br>
42, 42 extend rearward from the support portion 41 and,<br>
respectively, are inclined toward the center in the vehicle<br>
width direction. Thereby, a fellow passenger is made easy to<br>
grasp the grips 42, 42.<br>
Also, with the motorcycle 1, the edges 43b of the<br>
protective bar portions 43 in the vehicle width direction are<br>
positioned outwardly of the rear edge 30e of the rear side cover<br>
30 in the vehicle width direction. Thereby, it is possible<br>
to further effectively protect the rear side cover 30.<br>
Also, with the motorcycle 1, the dent portions 30h are<br>
formed on the portions of the rear side cover 30 positioned<br>
below the grips 42. Thereby, a fellow passenger is made easy<br>
to grasp the grips 42.<br><br>
Also, with the motorcycle 1, the rear side cover 30 is<br>
formed from a resin. Thereby, it is possible to achieve<br>
lightening the motorcycle 1.<br>
In addition, the invention is not limited to the<br>
motorcycle 1 described above but susceptible to various<br>
modifications. For example, with the motorcycle 1 described<br>
above, the protective bar portions 43 extend forward from the<br>
ends 41e of the support portion 41. However, the protective<br>
bar portions 4 3 may extend forward from an intermediate portion<br>
of the support portion 41.<br>
Also, with the motorcycle 1, the grips 42 extend rearward<br>
from the ends 41e of the support portion 41. However, the grips<br>
42 may extend rearward from an intermediate portion of the<br>
support portion 41.<br>
Also, with the motorcycle 1, the brackets 23a, 23a are<br>
provided on the seat rails 23, 23, respectively, and the fixed<br>
portions 41a, 41a are mounted to the respective brackets 23a,<br>
23a. However, a single bracket and a single fixed portion will<br>
do. For example, a bracket may bridge between a pair of seat<br>
rails 23, 23 and a single fixed portion provided on the support<br>
portion 41 may be mounted to the bracket.<br><br>
