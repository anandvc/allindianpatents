				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of Cellular Networks. The invention derives the new set of Proactive commands for a (U)SIM card which give more control to the cellular network operator on the UE. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of PLMN Selection By SIM card.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
UE has to register on a PLMN to get services [except emergency calls]. The PLMN to which UE registers, is known as Registered PLMN (RPLMN). When UE is registered on a PLMN, the operator of the PLMN gets revenue when the UE uses the services. So operator would like the UE to be registered on his network as much as possible. The PLMN selection algorithms on the UE side are getting complex, because of shared networks, EPLMN's, Preferred PLMN's &amp; increasing number of Radio access Technologies. With the growth of new Access Technologies &amp; network sharing, There is need for the operators to have a proper PLMN selection algorithm on the UE side, which can increase there revenue as well as which can serve the Users with Best possible service. This complexity is reflected in UE's by having proprietary PLMN selection methods by different operators, and also the changes in the specifications to include improved methods of PLMN selection.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
There is no single practical PLMN Selection algorithm which is good for all the operators. That is the reason why Network operators add their own proprietary requirements on PLMN selection algorithms by UE. The UE has to support different PLMN selection algorithm if it were to work with Different Networks, which is very difficult for implementation. The UE does not guarantee that it will work as per the network operator's requirement for PLMN selection. There is no enough control for the operator to manage the PLMN selection algorithm on the UE side. It is difficult for the UE to change the PLMN selection algorithm dynamically. Hence there is a need for operators to dynamically control the PLMN selection by UE.<br>
The weaknesses in the existing art can be summarized as below<br>
1)	The UE's from open market does not guarantee that it will work as per Operator's proprietary PLMN selection algorithm<br>
2)	The network operator has less control over the PLMN selection algorithm by the UE.<br>
3)	It is time consuming for the UE vendor to implement different PLMN selection algorithm's for different operators.<br>
4) UE does not have multiple PLMN selection algorithms since they add for the algorithm complexity &amp; code size.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is about, new set of proactive commands (proactive commands gives a mechanism whereby the (U)SIM can initiate actions to be taken by UE) which control the behaviour of the UE related to PLMN selection. Operator has to decide on when to make use of these primitives. The operator should put appropriate logic in (U) SIM cards which will trigger these commands &amp; make the UE work as per operator's requirement. There are basically two kinds of commands, the first set of commands helps the (U) SIM card to collect information about the UE/networks, the second set of command changes the behaviour of the UE in some kind, The new proactive commands are explained below.<br>
1)	SELECT PLMN [MCC + MNC + RAT]<br>
2)	SEARCH NETWORK [2G 3G WLAN]<br>
3)	SEARCH HPLMN<br>
4)	CHANGE UE MODE [GSM,UMTS,WLAN,GSM_UMTS, GSM_WLAN, UMTS_WLAN, GSM_UMTS_WLAN etc]<br>
5)	CHANGE PLMN SELECT MODE [Automatic] <br>
6)	NEVER SEARCH PLMNS<br>
7)	GET_CURRENT_PLMN_SELECT_MODE<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method of PLMN selection by SIM card wherein appropriate logic is incorporated in (U) SIM cards which trigger specific commands and make a UE work as per operator's requirement where two kinds of commands are introduced where the first set of commands helps the (U) SIM card to collect information about the UE/networks, the second set of command changes the behavior of the UE.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Detailed explanation of commands 1) SELECT PLMN [MCC + MNC + RAT]<br>
SIM shall give the MCC, MNC &amp; the RAT in this command. UE shall try to camp &amp; register to the given PLMN &amp; RAT combination. One of the possible implementation of this command is given in fig 1.<br>
When UE is in connected mode, it shall not execute this command &amp; instead shall send the failure code as "UE busy".<br>
If UE does not support the RAT, mentioned in the command, then UE shall reply with failure code "Beyond ME capabilities" If UE is in manual mode, then the failure shall be sent.<br>
While UE is in IDLE &amp; is not in "Manual mode", the Terminal response shall be sent as Successful and the following actions shall be taken by the UE<br>
*	The HPLMN/PPLMN search timer shall be paused.<br>
*	The UE shall try to camp on the PLMN mentioned by the SIM card. The result of registration/camping shall not be sent to SIM card.<br>
*	The HPLMN/PPLMN timer shall be restarted if required.<br>
The USIM card maintains 2 kinds of databases<br>
1)	list of PLMN id's, location area code and Radio Access Technology<br>
2)	The PLMN id, GPS co-ordinates x,y and the radius.<br>
This database is pre-computed and written on the sim card. The operator can modify the databases anytime through OTA e.g. in case of change in subscription. Two databases are provided since the location information can be given by 1) PLMN id , lai and cell id 2) PLMN id and GPS co¬ordinates. The GPS co-ordinates give the more accurate location information<br>
Database 1<br>
MCC MNC LAc RAT Target PLMN RAT Xxx xxx xxx xxx xxxxxx	xxx<br>
Database 2<br>
MCC MNC LAC RAT X Y Inside/Outside Radius Target PLMN RAT Xxx xxx xxx xxx x x xx	xx xx	xx<br>
Scenario 1)<br>
consider operator of PLMN A having a roaming agreement with PLMN B. In some places the PLMN A and PLMN B may overlap in such cases the operator can write the PLMN id and the LAI of the PLMN B in database 1. and also the database 2 is polulated with the x, y co-ordinates where the PLMN A and PLMN B overlap.<br>
Scenario 2: <br>
The 3G networks are not deployed in all the places. The 2G network still provides the larger coverage area. Consider the scenario as shown in diagram above, wherein the 3G coverage is present in one small part and the 2G coverage is given in larger chunk. The mobiles in border area often experience the ping pong effect. To avoid the changing of network (2G-3G and 3G to 2G), the mobiles which are in border area can register to 2G network to avoid the ping pong. The network operator will update the second database as shown below.<br>
222 123 XX 3G Xc Yc Rc Outside 222 123 2G<br>
what it means is, if the camped network is equal to 222,123 and 3G network. And if the user is in border area, then switch to 2G network. The Xc Yc and Rc help calculate whether the user is in border area or not. The parameter inside or outside helps to decide when the select PLMn sould be issues to ME.<br>
With the below sequence diagram, we try to illustrate the exchanges between ME and USIM card.<br>
Figure 10 depicts exchanges between ME and USIM card showing SELECT PLMN.<br>
af<br>
2) SEARCH NETWORK [2G 3G WLAN]<br>
SIM shall provide the list of Access Technologies, in which the UE has to search for the PLMN's, optionally SIM card can also give the band information. One of the possible implementation of this command is given in fig 2.<br>
When UE is in connected mode, it shall not execute this command &amp; instead shall send the failure code as "UE busy". If UE does not support the RAT, mentioned in the command, then UE shall reply with failure code "Beyond ME capabilities"<br>
If UE is in manual mode, then the failure shall be sent.<br>
With the advent of multimode handsets, the complexity for network search is increased. The tri-mode handsets which are capable of WLAN , GSM and WCDMA usually only search the GSM and WCDMA networks. Since the coverage of WLAN is very less, they are often not searched automatically. The decision to search the WLAN network is dependent on user. This patent provides an easy way wherein the search can be automated.<br>
The USIM card maintains the location (PLMN, LAC and cell id or the GPS co-ordinates wherein the WLAN hotspot is available). Whenever the ME<br>
does a sim write with the new location area identity. The USIM card checks if the WLAN hotspot is available in the area where user is currently located. And if yes, then the search for WLAN is triggered<br>
WLAN availability indicator Database 1 MCC MNC LAC cell Id Xxx xxx xxx xxx<br>
WLAN availability indicator Database 2 Xc Yc Rc<br>
Figure 11 depicts exchanges between ME and USIM card showing SEARCH NETWORK<br>
3)	SEARCH HPLMN [2G 3G WLAN]<br>
SIM shall provide the list of Access Technologies, in which the UE has to search for HPLMN only; optionally SIM card can also give the band information. One of the possible implementation of this command is given in fig 3.<br>
4)	CHANGE UE MODE [GSM, UMTS, WLAN, GSMJJMTS, GSM_WLAN, UMTS_WLAN, GSM_UMTS_WLAN etc]<br>
This command changes the mode of the UE, i.e. UE which is capable of <br>
GSM &amp; UMTS, can be made as single mode GSM/UMTS or it can be made as dual mode GSM-UMTS. The UE shall change its mode, if it supports the given Access Technology; else UE shall send the failure to SIM card. One of the possible implementation of this command is given in fig 4.<br>
The subscription details of the user define whether he can use the 3G services or 2G services or both. If a user having a 2G subscription uses a dual mode handsets (2G and 3G). The handset will search for 3G network and waste the battery. Since the user may change his mobile handsets, the SIM card is the best hardware to carry this subscription details. A particular file in the sim card mentions the lists of Radio Access Technologies) which the user can use. The command "Change UE mode" will be issued at power on after sim initialization is complete. The change UE mode command will carry the parameters (GSM, UMTS, WLAN, GSMJJMTS, GSM_WLAN,UMTS_WLAN, GSMJJMTSJ/VLAN etc)<br>
5)	CHANGE PLMN SELECT MODE [Automatic]<br>
When UE is in manual mode of PLMN Selection, this command will change the UE mode to Automatic. One of the possible implementation of this command is given in fig 5.<br>
6)	NEVER SEARCH PLMNS<br>
The SIM card shall provide the PLMN's list, which UE shall never try to search. This may include the PLMN's which does not exists. One of the possible implementation of this command is given in fig 6.<br>
The USIM cards have the forbidden PLMN list length as 4. since there can be many PLMN which are forbidden, the length of 4 is not enough. Even if the length of forbidden PLMN list is increased, it is still not possible to update all the forbidden PLMN's. hence the forbidden PLMN list can be defined as per the country where the ME is in . e.g: if the ME is in India , it will get the list of forbidden PLMN in India. If ME is in US, it will receives the list of forbidden PLMN's in US.<br>
The USIM card can have databases of forbidden PLMN's for various countries. Once the ME updates the location area identity, the USIM card knows the country where the ME has come. The corresponding database will be sent to ME in the "NEVER SEARCH PLMN" command.<br>
INDIA FPLMN list (x,y,z) Sri Lanka FPLMN list (xx,xx,xx) Germany FPLMN list (xx.xx.xx)<br>
Figure 12 depicts exchanges between ME and USIM card showing NEVER SEARCH PLMNS <br>
7) GET_CURRENT_PLMN_SELECT_MODE<br>
The UE shall respond to SIM card with the current PLMN selection mode (Automatic/Manual). One of the possible implementation of this command is given in fig 7.<br>
