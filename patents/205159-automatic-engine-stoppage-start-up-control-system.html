"AUTOMATIC ENGINE STOPPAGE/START-UP CONTROL SYSTEM<br><br><br><br>
HONDA GIEEN KOGYO KABUSHIKl KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
29-6-2005<br><br><br><br>
[Detailed  Description   of   the   Invention]<br>
[Technical   Field   to  Which   the   Invention   Pertains]<br><br>
The present invention relates to an automatic engine stoppage/start-up control system for stopping,<br><br><br>
No continuity in statment upon stopping a vehicle in the running state, an engine<br>
in response to a specific vehicle-stopping condition, and<br>
restarting, after stoppage, the engine in response to a<br>
specific vehicle-starting operation, and particularly to<br>
an automatic engine stoppage/start-up control system for<br>
retarding an ignition timing upon vehicle-starting<br>
acceleration as compared with an ignition timing upon<br><br>
steady   running   of   the  vehicle. <br>
[Prior  Art]<br><br>
Upon running of a scooter-type vehicle in a<br>
frequently selected intermediate engine speed range, it<br><br>
may be desirable to set the engine with an ignition timing determined such that the engine output and thermal efficiency become high, and accordingly the ignition<br>
timing in the intermediate engine speed range is<br>
generally advanced as compared with an ignition timing<br>
upon idling for ensuring a stable idling speed.<br><br>
In the case where the vehicle steadily runs in the intermediate engine speed with the ignition timing advanced as described above, however, there arises a problem that knocking is liable to occur knocking when a throttle valve is rapidly opened for rapid acceleration.<br><br><br><br>
A technique for solving such a problem has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No.  Hei 7-243373, wherein an ignition timing upon vehicle-starting<br>
acceleration from an intermediate engine speed range is retarded as compared with<br>
an ignition timing upon usual running of the vehicle.<br><br>
[Problem to be solved by the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an automatic engine stoppage/start-up<br>
control system for stopping, upon stopping a vehicle in the running state, an<br>
engine in response to a specific vehicle-stopping condition, and restarting, after<br>
stoppage, the engine in response to a specific vehicle starting operation,  said<br>
control   system   comprising   standard   ignition   timing   determining   means   for<br>
determining a standard ignition timing of an engine at least as a function of an<br><br>
engine speed; ignition timing upon acceleration correcting means for retarding an<br>
ignition timing upon acceleration of a vehicle more than said standard ignition<br>
timing  determined by  said  standard ignition  timing  determining means;   and<br>
ignition control means for executing ignition with said determined or corrected<br>
ignition timing, characterized in that:<br>
said  ignition! timing upon  acceleration  correcting  means  makes  the  retarded<br>
amount upon vehicle-starting acceleration from the engine stopping state larger<br>
than the retarded amount upon usual acceleration engine operational state.<br><br>
A vehicle including an automatic engine stoppage/start-up control system<br>
for stopping, upon stopping the vehicle in the running state, an engine in response<br>
to a specific vehicle-stopping condition, and restarting, after stoppage, the engine<br>
in response to a specific vehicle-starting operation, is required to rapidly increase,<br>
upon start-up of the vehicle, the engine speed from the stoppage state (engine<br>
speed: zero)to make occurrence of knocking easier than that upon acceleration<br><br>
from   an   intermediate   engine   speed  range.   Accordingly,   upon  vehicle-starting<br><br>
acceleration,<br><br>
it fails to perfectly prevent occurrence of knocking even if the retarded<br><br>
amount is set at the same value as that upon acceleration engine speed range.<br>
An     object        of       the	present      invention      is	to	solve<br>
the    problem    of    the     above     -     described    prior    art     system,     and    to<br><br>
provide an automatic engine stoppage/start-up control system Capable of preventing occurrence of knocking not<br>
only upon acceleration from an intermediate engine speed<br>
range but also upon vehicle-starting acceleration.<br>
To achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided an automatic engine stoppage/start-up control system for stopping, upon stopping a vehicle in the running state, an engine in response to a specific vehicle-stopping condition, and<br>
restarting, after stoppage, the engine in response to a<br><br>
specific vehicle-starting operation, the control system comprising standard ignition timing determining means for determining a standard ignition timing of an engine at<br>
least as; a function of an engine speed; ignition timing<br>
upon acceleration correcting means for retarding an<br>
ignition timing upon acceleration of a vehicle more than<br>
the standard ignition timing determined by the standard<br>
ignition timing determining means; and ignition control<br>
means for   executing ignition with the determined or<br>
corrected ignition timing, characterized in that the<br>
ignition timing upon acceleration correcting means makes<br>
the retarded amount upon vehicle - starting acceleration<br>
from   the:  engine  stopping state larger than the retarded<br>
amount upon usual acceleration from the engine<br><br>
operational state.<br>
With this configuration, it is possible to make the retarded amount upon vehicle - starting acceleration<br><br>
II<br>
different from the retarded amount upon acceleration from<br>
an intermediate engine speed range.  As a result, it is<br>
possible to prevent occurrence of knocking not only upon<br><br>
acceleration from the intermediate engine speed range but<br><br>
also upon vehicle - starting acceleration by setting the<br><br>
retarded amount upon vehicle-starting acceleration larger<br>
than the retarded amount upon usual acceleration from the<br>
intermediate engine speed range<br><br><br>

The configurations of a hinge portion for opening/closing the seat 8 and a seating switch disposed<br>
near the hinge portion will be described below.  Fig. 3 is<br>
a schematic view showing the structure of the hinge [portion for opening/closing the seat 8.  Referring to Fig.<br>
3, the seat 8 serving as a lid of the luggage box 9a is jprovided; in such a manner as to be openable/closable in the direction shown by an arrow A relative to the luggage<br><br>
box 9a.  To make the seat 8 openable/closable, the luggage box 9a is provided with a hinge shaft 1102 and a link member 11OO swingable around the hinge shaft 1102.  The other end, opposed to the end connected to the hinge shaft 1102, of the link member 1100 is turnably connected to a second hinge shaft 110 provided on a frame 8a of the seat 8.  As a result, the seat 8 can be swung around the hinge shaft 1102 in the direction shown by the arrow A and can be also swung around the second hinge shaft 110 in the direction shown by an arrow B. <br>
A spring 1103 is interposed between the link member<br>
1100 and the frame 8a for biasing the seat 8 clockwise<br>
around the second hinge shaft 110.  A seating switch 254<br>
is alsoprovided between the link member 1100 and the frame 8a When the driver sits on the seat 8 and the frame 8a is turned by a specific amount counterclockwise around the second hinge shaft 110, the seating switch 156 is turned on for detecting the seating state. <br>
The engine 1200 will be described in detail.  Fig. 4 is a sectional view of a starter/generator connected to<br>
a crank Shaft of the engine, which is equivalent to a sectional view taken on line A-A of Fig. 1.<br><br><br>
Referring to Fig. 4, a crank shaft 12 is rotatably supported via main bearings 10 and 11 by the swing unit case 31 having the hanger 37 supported by the main pipe 7, and a connecting rod 14 is connected to the crank shaft 12 via crank pin 13.  An inner rotor 15 of a starter/generator is provided on one end portion of the crank shaft 12 projecting from a crank chamber 9.<br>
The inner rotor 15 has a rotor boss 16 and<br>
permanent magnets 19 fitted around the outer peripheral surf ace of the rotor boss 16. In this embodiment, six<br>
pieces of the permanent magnets 19 made from neodymium iron boron based alloy are spaced at equal angular<br>
intervals around the crank shaft 12 .  The center hole of<br>
the rotor boss 16 is fitted around a tip taper portion of<br>
the cranlk shaft 12. A flange member 39 is disposed at one<br>
end (on the side opposed to the crank shaft 12) of the<br>
rotor boss 16.  The rotor boss 16 is fixed, together with<br>
the flange member 39, to the crank shaft 12 with a bolt<br>
20.<br><br>
The rotor boss 16 has a small diameter cylindrical<br>
portion 40 projecting on the flange member 39 side, and a<br>
bush holder 41 is slidably provided on the outer<br>
periphery of the cylindrical portion 40.  The bush holder<br><br><br>
41 is biased in the direction of the flange member 39 by<br>
i'<br>
a compression coil spring 42.  Brushes 44 biased by the<br>
       .        .<br>
compression coil spring 42 are provided on the bush<br>
holder 41.  A connecting pin 45 extending in parallel to<br>
the center axis of the crank shaft 12 passes through the<br>
rotor boss 16.  One end of the connecting shaft 45 is<br>
fixed to the brush holder 41 and the other end thereof is<br>
i, connected to a plate 46 of a governor to be described in<br>
detail later.<br><br>
	A   stator core 48 of an outer stator 47 disposed<br>
around the outer periphery of the inner rotor 15 is fixed<br>
:<br>
 to the swing unit case 31 with a bolt 49.  A power- generation coil 50 and a starting coil 51 are wound around a yoke 48a of the stator core 48.  A cylindrical<br>
portion48b extends from the stator core 48 in such a manner as to cover the bush holder 41.  A commutator<br>
 holder 52 is connected to the end portion of the<br><br>
cylindrical portion 48b, and commutator pieces 53 are fixed to the commutator holder 52 in such a manner as to be brought into slide-contact with the brushes 44.  To be more specific, the commutator pieces 53 are disposed at positions facing to the brushes 44 biased by the compression coil spring 42. <br><br>
Although only one brush 44 is shown in Fig. 4, the necessary number of the brushes 44 are actually provided along the rotational direction of the inner rotor 15.  One example ijregarding the numbers and shapes of the brushes and commutator pieces has been described in the specification of the prior application (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 9-215292) filed by the present applicant.  The stroke of the brushes 44 is limited to a specific amount in order that the brushes 44 are separated from the commutator pieces 53 when the brush holder 41 is offset on the crank shaft 12 side by the<br>
governor to be described later.  A locking means (not<br>
shown) for limiting the stroke of the brushes 44 is<br>
interposed between the brush holder 41 and the brushes 44. A governor 54 for automatically switching an<br>
engine-starting mode and a power-generation mode from<br>
each other is provided at the end portion, fitted to the<br>
crank shaft 12, of the rotor boss 16.  The governor 54 includes the above-described plate 46 and a roller 55 as<br>
a goVernor weight for offsetting the plate 46 toward the<br>
center of the crank shaft 12 in the lonqituding<br>
direction.  The roller 55 is preferably configured as a metal core covered with a resin cover; however, it may be configured as only a metal core or a resin made core.  The<br><br><br>
rotor boss 16 has a pocket 56 for housing the roller 55. The pocket 56 has a taper in cross - section which is made narrower on the outer stator 47 side.<br>
A radiator fan 57 is mounted on the flange member 39, and !&gt;a radiator 5 8 is disposed_QPposite_to the radiator fan 57.  A sprocket 59 is fixed on the crank shaft 12 at a position between the inner rotor 15 and the<br>
main—bearing 11.  A chain 60 for transmitting a power from<br>
i		<br>
the  Crank   shaft   12   for   driving   a   cam   shaft    (see   Fig.   5) is 'wound around   the   sprocket   59.     The   sprocket   59   is<br>
integrated with  a  with a gear 61 for transmitting a power to a pump for circulating lubricating oil.  The gear 61 transmits a power to a gear fixed to a drive shaft of a trochoidal pump to be described later. <br>
With this configuration, when the starter switch is depressed to apply a voltage to the commutator pieces 53 by a battery (not shown), a current flows in the starting coil 51 through the brushes 44, whereby the inner rotor 15 is rotated.  As a result, the crank shaft 12 connected to the inner rotor 15 is rotated, to thereby start the engine 1200.  As the rotational speed of the engine 1200 is increased, a centrifugal force is applied to the governor weight 55, so that the governor weight 55 is<br><br>
moved in the pocket 56 in the outer peripheral direction of the rotor boss 16, to reach a position shown by a chain line in Fig. 4.<br>
Along with the movement of the governor weight 55, the plate 46 and the connecting pin 45 connected thereto are offset as shown by chain lines in Fig. 4.  Since the other end of the connecting pin 45 is engaged with the brush holder—41 the  brush holder 41 is also offset.  The stroke of the brushes 44 is limited as described above, and therefore, when the brush holder 41 is offset by a distance larger than the critical stroke, the contact between the brushes 44 and the commutator pieces 53 is released.  After the brushes 44 are separated from the commutator pieces 53, the crank shaft 12 is rotated by the engine, so that an electric power is generated by the power-ge:neration coil 51, to supply a current to the battery:<br>
The structure of the head and its neighborhood of the engine 1200 will be described below.  Fig. 5 is a sectional side view of the head and its neighborhood of the engine.  A piston 63 disposed in a cylinder 62 is connected to a small end side of the connecting rod 14 via a piston pin 64.  An ignition plug 65 is screwed in<br><br>
the cylinder head 32 in such a manner that an electrode portion thereof faces to a combustion chamber formed between ijthe head of the piston 63 and the cylinder head 32.  The cylinder 62 is surrounded by a water jacket 66.<br>
A cam shaft 69 rotatably supported by bearings 67 and 68 is provided in the cylinder head 32 at a position over the cylinder 62.  An attachment 70 is fitted to the cam shaft 69.  A cam sprocket 72 is fixed to the attachment 70 with a bolt 71.  The chain 60 is wound around the cam sprocket 72.  The rotation of the above-described sprocket 59 (see Fig. 4), that is, the rotation of the crank shaft 12 is transmitted to the cam shaft 69 via the ichain 60.<br>
Rpcker arms 73, which are provided over the cam<br>

shaft 69, are rocked in accordance with the cam shape of<br>
the cam(shaft 69 when the cam shaft 69 is rotated.  The<br><br>
cam   shape   of   the   camshaft69 is determined   such   that  an intake   valve   95   and   an   exhaust   valve   96   are   opened/closed<br><br>
in accordance with a specific stroke of the four-cycle engine.  The intake pipe 23 is opened/closed by the intake valve 95, and an exhaust pipe 97 is opened/closed by the exhaust valve 96. .[0030]<br><br>
n exhaust cam and an intake cam are integrally formed on the cam shaft 69, and a decompression cam 98 engaged with the cam shaft 69 only in the reverse rotation direction is provided adjacently to these exhaust land intake cams.  When the cam shaft 69 is reversely rotated, the decompression cam 98 is turned while following the rotation of the cam shaft 69 in such a manner as to project from the outer peripheral shape of the exhaust cam.<br>
Accordingly, the exhaust valve 96 can be slightly<br><br>
lifted upon normal rotation of the cam shaft 69, so that he load at the compression stroke of the engine can be reduced. This makes it possible to make small a torque [upon starting the rotation of the crank shaft, and hence to reduce the size of the starter of the four-cycle engine. ; As a result, it is possible to make compact the crank and its neighborhood and hence to make large the bank angle.  In addition, after the cam is normally rotated for a while, the outer shape of the decompression the exhaust cam.<br>
A pump chamber 76 surrounded by a water pump base 74 and a water pump housing 75 is formed in the cylinder<br><br><br>
head 32.  A pump shaft 78 having an impeller 77 is disposed in the pump chamber 76.  The pump shaft 78 is fitted to the end portion of the cam shaft 69, and is rotatably supported by a bearing 79.  A drive force of the pump shaft 78 is obtained by a pin 80 engaged with the center portion of the cam sprocket 72.<br>
An air reed valve 94, which sucks air when a negative, pressure occurs in the exhaust pipe 97 to thereby(improve the emission, is provided in a head cover 81.  Whijle seal members are provided around the pump chamber 76, the description thereof is omitted.<br>
An automatic transmission for changing the rotational speed of the engine 1200 and transmitting the rotatiorial speed of the engine thus changed to a rear wheel will be described below.  Figs. 6 and 7 are sectional views showing a drive side portion and a driven side portion of the automatic transmission of the engine, respectively. <br>
Referring to Fig. 6, a pulley 83 around which a V-belt 82 is wounded is provided at the end portion, on the side opposed to the side on which the inner rotor 15 of the above - described starter/generator is provided, of the<br><br>
crank shaft 12.  The pulley 83 is composed of a fixed pulley piece 83a and a movable pulley piece 83b.  The fixed pulley piece 83a is fixed in its movement relative to the crank shaft 12 in both the rotational and axial directions.  The movable pulley piece 83b is slidable relative to the crank shaft 12 in the axial direction.  A holder plate 84 is mounted on the back surface, which is not in contact with the V-belt 82, of the movable pulley piece 83b.  The holder plate 84 is restricted in its movement relative to the crank shaft 12 in both the rotatiorial and axial directions, that is, rotated together with the crank shaft 12 .  The space surrounded by the holder plate 84 and the movable pulley piece 83b forms the pocket for housing the roller 85 as the governor weight.<br>
on the other hand, a clutch mechanism for<br>
transmitting power to fhe rear wheel 21 is configured<br>
asfollows  Referring to Fig.7 a main shaft 12 5 of the<br>
clutch is supported by a bearing 127 fitted in a case 126<br><br>
and a bearing 129 fitted in a_gear box 128.  A fixed pulley piece 132a of a pulley 132 is supported by the main shaft 125 via bearings 130 and 131.  A cup-shaped clutch plate 134 is fixed to an end portion of the main shaft 125 by means of a nut 133.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A movable pulley piece 132b of the pulley 132 is provided on a sleeve 135 of the fixed pulley piece 132a in such a manner as to slidable in the longitudinal direction of the main shaft 125.  The movable pulley piece 132b is engaged with a disk 136 in such a manner as to be movable around the main shaft 125 integrally with the disk 136.  A compression coil spring 137 is provided between the disk 136 and the movable pulley piece 132b for imparting a repulsive force thereto in the direction where a distance therebetween is extended.  A shoe 139 swingably supported by a pin 138 is provided on the disk<br><br>
136.  When the rotational speed of the disk 136 is increased, the shoe 139 is swingably moved in the outer peripheral direction by the centrifugal force applied thereto;; and is brought into contact with the inner periphery of the clutch plate 134.  A spring 140 is provided in order that when the rotational speed of the disk 136 reaches a specific value, the shoe 139 is brought into contact with the clutch plate 134.<br>
A pinion 141, which is fixed on the main shaft 125, is meshed with a gear 143 fixed to an idle shaft 142.  A pinion 144 fixed to the idle shaft 142 is meshed with a gear 146 of an output shaft 145.  The rear wheel 21 is<br><br>
composed of a rim 21a and a tire 21b fitted around the periphery of the rim 21a, and the rim 21a is fixed to the output shaft 145.<br>
with this configuration, when the engine speed is<br>
minimized, the roller 85 is located at a position shown<br>
by a solid line in Fig. 6 and thereby the V-belt 82 is<br>
woundaround the minimum diameter portion of the pulley 83. The; movable pulley piece 132b of the pulley 132 is biased by the compression coil spring 137 to be offset to<br>
a position shown by a solid line in Fig. 7, so that the<br><br>
V-belt 82 is wound around the maximum diameter portion of the pulley 132.  In such a state, since the main shaft 125 of the centrifugal clutch is rotated at the minimum speed, the cent'rifugal force applied to the disk 136 is minimized, with a result that the shoe 139 is drawn inwardly by the biasing force of the spring 140 and is thereby not brought into contact with the clutch plate<br>
134.  That is to say, the rotation of the engine is not<br>
i transmitted to the main shaft 125, so that the axle 21 is<br>
not rotated.<br><br>
As the engine speed becomes large, the roller 85 is<br>
offset in the outer peripheral direction by the<br>
centrifugal force applied thereto.  The offset position of<br><br>
the roller 85 is shown by the chain line in Fig. 6.  When the roller 85 is offset in the outer peripheral direction, the movable pulley piece 83b is pushed to the fixed pulley piece 83a side, so that the V-belt 82 is moved to the maximum diameter side of the pulley 83.  On the centrifugal clutch side, the movable pulley piece 132b, which overcomes the biasing force of the compression coil spring 137, is offset in the direction where it is separated from the fixed pulley piece 132a, so that the V-belt 82 is moved to the minimum diameter side of the pulley 132.  Accordingly, since the centrifugal force applied to the disk 136 is increased, the shoe 139 overcomes the biasing force of the spring 140 and projects; outwardly, to be thus brought into contact with the clutch plate 134.  As a result, the engine speed is transmitted to the main shaft 125, and the power is transmitted to the axle 21 via a gear train.  In this way, the winding diameter of the V-belt 82 around the pulley 83 on the crank shaft 12 side and the pulley 132 on the centrifugal clutch side is changed in accordance with the engine speed, with a result that the speed change action is thus achieved. <br>
Upon start-up of the engine, as described above, the engine can be started by applying a current to the<br><br>
starting' coil 51; however, in this embodiment, a kick<br>
| starter for starting the engine 1200 by depressing the<br>
kick pedal is additionally provided.<br>
The kick starter will be described in detail with reference to Fig. 6. A driven dog gear 86 for kick starting is fixed on the back surface of the fixed pulley piece 83a.  Meanwhile, a supporting shaft 88 having a helical gear 87 is rotatably supported on the cover 36 side.  A cap 89 is fixed to an end portion of the supporting shaft 88, and a drive dog gear 90 meshed with the driyen dog gear 86 is formed on an end surface of the cap 89 .<br>
The kick shaft 27 is turnably supported on the<br>
cover 36, and a sector helical gear 91 to be meshed__with the helical gear 87 is welded to the kick shaft 27.  The<br>
portion, projecting outwardly from the cover 36, of the kick shaft 27.  In the figure, reference numeral 92 and 93 designate return springs. <br>
With this configuration, when the kick pedal 29 is depressed, the kick shaft 27 and the sector helical gear 91, which overcome the biasing force of the return spring<br><br><br>
93, are turned.  The mutual twisting direction of the helical gear 87 and the sector helical gear 91 is set such that when the sector helical gear 91 is turned by depressing the kick pedal, the helical gears 87 and 91 generate; a force for biasing the supporting shaft 88 on<br>
the pulley 83 side.  Accordingly, when the kick pedal 29<br>
i is depressed, the supporting shaft 88 is offset to the<br>
pulley 83 side, so that the drive dog gear 90 formed on<br>
the end 'surface of the cap 89 is meshed with the driven<br>
dog gear 86.  As a result, the crank shaft 12 is rotated,<br>
to start the engine 1200.  When the engine is started, the<br>
depressing force applied to the kick pedal 29 may be<br>
weakened;.  At this time, the sector helical gear 91 is<br>
reversed; by the return springs 92 and 93, so that the<br>
engagement between the drive dog gear 90 and the driven<br>
dog gear 86 is released.<br>
Next, the feed system of lubricating oil will be described with reference to Fig. 8.  An oil feeding<br>
portion is provided under the crank chamber 9.  A pipe<br>
i line 148 for introducing oil is formed in an oil pan 147,<br>
and oil is sucked from the pipe line 148 into a<br>
trochoidal pump 149 as shown by an arrow Dl.  The oil thus<br>
sucked in the trochoidal pump 149 is compressed and<br>
discharged into a pipe line 150, passing through the pipe<br><br>
line 150 as shown by arrows D2 and D3, and is discharged<br>
into the crank chamber.<br><br>
A gear 152 is connected to a pump shaft 151 of the trochoidal pump 149, and the gear 61 connected to the crank shaft 12 is meshed with the gear 152.  That is to say, the trochoidal pump 149 is driven by rotation of the crank shaft 12, to circulate the lubricating oil. <br>
As described above, in this embodiment, the sprocket; 59 for driving the cam shaft 69 and the gear 61 for driving the oil pump are mounted on the crank shaft 12 adjacently to the bearing 11 for supporting the crank shaft 12; and the inner rotor 15 containing the permanent magnet 19 is disposed at a position near the sprocket 59 and the gear 61, that is, at a position being not apart from the. bearing 11.  In particular, the governor weight 55 of the governor mechanism for automatically switching the start-up of the engine and the power-generation from each other is disposed in the vicinity of the bearing 11. <br>
Next, the arrangement of the sensor for outputting a crank pulse will be described.  Figs. 9 and 10 are a sectional side view and a sectional front view of the crank shaft and its neighborhood, showing the arrangement<br><br><br>
of the sensor (crank pulser) for generating a crank pulse, respectively.<br><br>
     Referring to Figs. 9 and 10, the crank case is composed of a front crank case 99F and a rear crank case 99R.  A crank pulser 153 is provided on the rear crank case 99R. side in such a manner as to be perpendicular to the crank shaft 12.  A detecting end 153a of the crank pulser 153 is disposed in such a manner as to face to the outer peripheral edge of a left crank web 12L.  A projection, that is, a reluctor 154 is formed on the outer periphery of the left crank web 12L.  The crank pulser 153 is magnetically coupled with the reluctor 154, to output a detection signal of a crank angle.<br><br>
An automatic engine stoppage/start-up control system will be described below.  The system includes an idling permitting mode (hereinafter, referred to as "enginefstarting and idle switch (SW) mode"), and an idling restricting (or prohibiting) mode (hereinafter, referred to as "engine - stopping and vehicle -starting mode"). <br>
Under the "engine-starting and idle switch (SW) mode" which permits idling, idling is temporarily<br><br>
permitted after the initial start-up of the engine aftei turning on a main power source for performing warm-up operation upon start-up of the engine; and further idlir is permitted in accordance with the intention of the driver, that is, by turning on the idle switch (SW) ever in the case other than the above mentioned idling after the initial start-up of the engine. <br>
Under the "engine-stopping and vehicle - starting mode" which restricts idling, when the vehicle is stopped, the engine is automatically stopped, and when the accelerator is operated in the vehicle stoppage state, the engine is automatically restarted, enabling the vehicle to start. <br>
Fig. 11 is a block diagram showing the entire<br><br>
configuration of a start-up/stoppage control system of the engine 1200.  In the figure, parts corresponding to those described above are designated by the same<br><br>
 characters.      A starter/generator 250 provided coaxially with the crank shaft 12 includes a starter motor 171 and an AC generator (ACG) 172.  A power generated by the ACG 172 is charged in a battery 168 via a regulator rectifier 167.<br><br><br>
The regulator rectifier 167 controls the voltage outputted from the starter/generator 250 at a value in<br>
the range of 12 V to 14.5 V.  The battery 168 is used to supply,when a starter relay 162 is conducted, a drive current to the starter motor 171, and to supply a load current to various kinds of general electrical equipment 174, a main control unit 160, and the like via a main switch 173. <br>
The main control unit 160 is connected to an Ne<br>
sensor 153, an idle switch 253, a seating switch 254 a vehicular speed sensor 255, a stand by_indicator 256, a throttle sensor 257, a starter switch 258 a stop_ switch 259, a battery indicator 276, and a water temperature<br>
sensor 25l. "The Ne sensor 153 detects an engine speed Ne<br>
The idle switch 253 manual1y_ permits or restricts idling of the engine 1200.  The seating switch 254 closes the contact and outputs a signal of the "H" level when the driver sits on the seat.  The vehicular speed sensor 255 detects the vehicular speed.  The stand-by indicator 256 flashes in the "engine-stopping and vehicle-starting mode".  The throttle sensor 257 (including a throttle switch 257a) detects the throttle opening degree 0  .  The starter switch 258 drives the starter motor 171 to start the engine 1200.  The stop switch 259 outputs a signal of<br><br><br>
the "H" level in response to braking operation.  The battery indicator 276 lights up when the voltage of the battery 168 is reduced to a predetermined value (for example/ 10 V) or less to warn the driver of the shortage of the charged amount of power in the battery 168.  The water temperature sensor 251 detects the temperature of cooling [water for the engine. <br>
The main control unit 160 is also connected to an ignition controller (including an ignition coil) 161, a control terminal of the starter relay 162, a control terminal, of a head lamp driver 163, and a control terminal of a by-starter relay 164.  The ignition controller 161 ignites the ignition plug 65 in<br>
synchronization with rotation of the crank shaft 12.  The<br><br>
starter relay 162 supplies a power to the starter motor<br>
171.  The head lamp driver 163 supplies a power to the<br>
head lamp 169.  The by- starter relay 164 supplies a power<br>
to a by-starter 165 mounted to a carburetor 166.  The head<br>
lamp relay 163 is configured as switching elements such<br>
as FETs., In this case, there is adopted a so-called<br>
chopping control for substantially controlling the<br>
voltage applied to the head lamp 169 by interrupting the<br>
switching elements in accordance with a specific cycle<br>
and a specific duty ratio.<br><br><br>
Figs. 12 to 15 are block diagrams (Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4) each showing the function of the configuration of the main control unit 160.  In these figures, the same reference numerals as those described in Fig. 11 designate the same or similar parts. <br>
Figs. 16 and 17 show lists of control contents of a starter relay control unit 400, a by-starter control unit 900, a stand-by indicator control unit 600, a head lamp control unit 800, a non-seating (after vehicle stoppage) control unit 100, an ignition control unit 700, an ignition knock control unit 200, and a charging control unit 500.  These control units constitute the main control unit 160.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 12, when the state of the idling switch 253 and the state of the vehicle are_under specific conditions, the operation switching unit 300 switches the operational mode into either the "engine-starting and idle SW mode" or "engine-stopping and vehicle starting mode". <br>
A signal indicating the state of the idle switch 253 is inputted in an operational mode signal output unit<br><br>
301 of the operation switching unit 300.  The signal indicating the state of the idle switch 253 exhibits the "L"   level if the idle switch 253 is turned off (for restricting idling), and exhibits the "H" level if the idle switch 253 is turned on (for permitting idling).  The operational mode signal output unit 301 outputs an operational mode signal S301 for designating the operational mode of the main control unit 160 at either the "engine - starting and idle SW mode" or "engine-stopping and vehicle - starting mode" in response to output signals  from the idle switch 253, vehicular speed sensor 255 and water temperature sensor 155. <br>
Fig. 18 is a schematic diagram showing conditions for switching the operational modes by the operational mode signal output unit 301.  If the main switch 173 is<br>
i<br>
turned on to reset the main control unit 160 (a condition 1 is established) , the level of the operational signal S301 becomes the "L" level for activating the "engine - starting and idle SW mode". -<br>
If, under the "engine-starting and idle SW mode", the vehicular speed not less than a predetermined speed (for example, 10 km/hr) is detected, the water temperature is not less than a specific temperature (for<br><br>
example, a temperature at which the warm-up operation is assumed to have been completed), and the idle switch 253 is turned off (a condition 2 is established), the level of the operational mode signal S301 is shifted from the "L" level to the "H" level for activating the "engine-stopping and vehicle-starting mode".<br>
If under the "engine-stopping and vehicle - starting mode", the idle switch SW in the OFF state is turned into ON state, (a condition 3 is established) , the level of the operational mode signal S301 is shifted from the "H" level to the "L" level, to return the operational mode from the "engine stopping and vehicle-starting mode" into the "engine starting and idle SW mode".  In addition, if the main switch 173 is cut off (a condition 4 is established), the "engine-stopping and vehicle - starting mode" and the "engine-starting and idle SW mode" are both turned off. <br>
Referring back to Fig. 12, a crank angle (upon engine - stoppage) control unit 1000 stops, upon engine<br>
stoppage, the engine at a desired crank.angle position by<br>
reverseily rotating the starter motor 171 only for a<br><br>
predetermined time.<br><br>
A stoppage decision timer 1001 monitors the Ne<br><br><br>
sensor 153, and outputs a time-out signal ("H" level) when the state in which any signal is not outputted from the Ne sensor 153 is continued for a predetermined time Tx.  The time-out signal represents the stoppage of the engine.  The time-out signal from the stoppage decision timer 1001 is inputted in an AND circuit 1002, an AND circuit 1007, and a reverse rotation permitting timer 1004 .<br>
T,he reverse rotation permitting timer 1004 keeps a reverse (rotation permitting signal at "H" level until an elapse of a time Tback in response to the time-out signal from the stoppage decision timer 1002.  The reverse rotation permitting time Tback is a function of the<br>
temperature of cooling water of the engine, and is<br><br>
selected at a shorter timer as the temperature of cooling water becomes higher. <br>
A comparison unit 1003 compares the engine speed Ne based on the output from the Ne sensor 153 with a reference speed Nref set to be larger than a cranking speed but lower than the idling speed.  If the engine speed Ne is not less than the reference speed Nref, the comparison unit 1003 outputs a signal of the "L"   level indicating that the engine is in the ON state.  If the<br><br>
engine speed Ne is less than the reference speed Nref, the comparison unit 1003 outputs a signal of the "H" level indicating that the engine is in the OFF state.  The signal from the comparison unit 1003 is inputted in the AND circuit 1002.<br><br>
The signals outputted from the AND circuit 1002 and the reverse rotation permitting timer 1004, and the time-out signal from the stoppage decision timer 1001 are inputted in an AND circuit 1005.  The AND circuit 1005 outputs a logic product of these output signals.  The logic product is inverted by an inverter 1006 and is supplied to a reverse rotation relay 162a.<br>
The output signal from the reverse rotation<br>
permitting timer 1004 is inputted in one input terminal<br>
of an AND circuit 1007, and the time-out signal from the<br>
stoppage decision timer 1001 is inputted to the other<br>
input terminal of the AND circuit 1007.  The signal<br><br><br><br>
outputted from the AND circuit 1007 is inputted in the OR<br>
circuit 406 of a starter relay control unit 400.  It should be noted that the control content of the above-described crank angle (upon engine - stoppage) control unit 1000 has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 11-117107 by the present applicant, and therefore,<br><br><br>
the description thereof is omitted.<br>
In accordance with such a crank angle control upon stoppage of the engine, in the case where the engine is started by reversely rotating the crank shaft once and then normally rotating it, the crank shaft is reversely rotated ;for a specific reverse rotation time previously set in accordance with the rotational friction of the engine.  The reverse rotation time is set such that the crank angle position at which the reversely rotated crank shaft is stopped, that is, the normal rotation starting position comes to a position from which the crank shaft can overtake, upon normal rotation, the compression top dead center with a small torque. <br>
Referring to Fig. 12, the starter relay control unit 400 starts the starter relay 162 under a specific condition ln accordance with each of the operational modes.  The detection siqnal from the Nesensor 153 is supplied to a cranking speed-or- less deciding unit 401 and an idling speed-or - less deciding unit 407.  If the engine s'peed is a specific cranking speed (for example, 600 rpm) or less, the cranking speed-or - less deciding unit 401 outputs a signal of the "H" level.  If the engine speed is a specific idling speed (for example, 1200 rpm)<br><br><br>
or less, the idling speed-or - less deciding unit 401 outputs a signal of the "H" level.<br>
An AND circuit 402 outputs a logic product of the signal outputted from the cranking speed-or- less deciding unit 401, the signal indicating the state of the stop switch 259, and the signal indicating the state of the starter switch 258.  An AND circuit 404 outputs a logic product of the signal outputted from the idling speed-or-less deciding unit 407, the detection signal from the throttle switch 257a and the signal indicating the state of a seating switch 254.  An AND circuit 403 outputs a logic product of the signal outputted from the AND circuit 402 and the reversed signal of the operational mode signal S301.  An AND circuit 405 outputs a logic product of the signal outputted from the AND circuit 404 and the operational mode signal S301.  An OR circuit 406 outputs a logic sum of the signals outputted from the AND circuits 403 and 405 to the starter relay 162.<br>
With this starter relay control, under the "engine-starting and idle switch mode", the AND circuit 403 becomes the enable state.  As a result, when the engine speed is the cranking speed or less and the stop switch 259 is in the ON state (during braking operation), the<br><br>
starter jswitch 258 is turned on by the driver (the signal outputted from the AND circuit 402 exhibits the "H" level), and the starter relay 162 is conducted to start the starter motor 171. <br>
Under the "engine-stopping and vehicle-starting mode", the AND circuit 405 becomes the enable state.  As a result, if the throttle is opened (the signal outputted from the AND circuit 404 exhibits the "H" level) in the state in, which the engine speed is the idling speed or less and. the seating switch 254 is in the ON state (during the period in which the driver is sitting on the seat), the starter relay 162 is conducted to start the starter motor 171. <br>
In a stand-by indicator control unit 600 shown in Fig. 13/ a vehicular speed-zero deciding unit 601 receives the detection signal from the vehicular speed sensor 255 and outputs, if the vehicular speed is substantially zero, a signal of the "H" level; and an Ne deciding unit 602 receives the detection signal from the Ne sensor 153 and outputs, if the engine speed is a predetermined value or less, a signal of the "H" level. An AND circuit 603 outputs a logic product of the signals outputted from the deciding units 601 and 602.<br><br><br>
—<br>
An AND circuit 604 outputs a logic product of the signal outputted from the AND circuit 603 and the reversed, signal of the signal outputted from the seating switch 254.  An AND circuit 605 outputs a logic product of the signal outputted from the AND circuit 603 and the signal outputted from the seating switch 254.  A lighting/flashing control unit 606 outputs a lighting signal if the signal outputted from the AND circuit 604 exhibits the "H" level, and outputs a flashing signal if it exhibits the "L" level.  An AND circuit 607 outputs a logic product of the signal outputted from the lighting/flashing control unit 606 and the operational mode signal S301.  The stand-by indicator 256 lights in response to the lighting signal and flashes in response to the flashing signal. <br>
With this stand-by indicator control, as shown in Fig. 16, the stand-by indicator 256 lights up if the driver does not sit on the seat when the vehicle is in the stopping state under the "engine - stopping and vehicle-starting mode", and flashes if the driver sits on the seat when the vehicle is in the stopping state under the "engine-stopping and vehicle-starting mode".  As a result, when the stand-by indicator 256 flashes, the<br><br>
driver can recognize that he can immediately start the vehicle by opening an accelerator grip, even if the engine is in the stopping state. <br>
The ignition control unit 700 shown in Fig. 13 permits or prohibits the igniting operation by the ignition controller 161 in accordance with a specific condition under each operational mode. <br>
A running deciding unit 701 decides, on the basis of the detection signal from the vehicular speed sensor 255, whether or not the vehicle is in the running state, and outputs, if the vehicle is in the running state, a signal of the "H" level.  An OR circuit 706 outputs a logic sum of the signal outputted from the running deciding unit 701 and the signal outputted from the throttle switch 257a.  An AND circuit 707 outputs a logic product ,of the signal outputted from the seating switch 254 and the signal outputted from the OR circuit 706.  As a result, the signal outputted from the AND circuit 707 exhibits the "H" level if the throttle is opened or the vehicular speed is larger than zero, and the driver sits on the seat. <br>
The AND circuit 702 outputs a logic product of the<br><br><br>
signal outputted from the seating switch 254, the reversed signal of the signal outputted from the running deciding, unit 701, and the reversed signal of the signal outputted from the throttle switch 257a.  A timer 703 retards the input signal by a specific time (three seconds in this embodiment) and outputs the retarded input signal.  An NAND circuit 705 outputs the reversed signal of the logic product of the signal outputted from the AND circuit 702 and the signal outputted from the timer 703.  As a result, the signal outputted from the NAND circuit 705 exhibits the "L" level if the throttle is closed, the vehicular speed is zero, and the seating state of the driver is continued for three seconds. <br>
A movable contact of a switching circuit 708 is switched to the NAND circuit 705 side when the igniting operation of the ignition controller 161 is carried out and is switched to the AND circuit 707 side when the ignition operation of the ignition controller 161 is stopped  An OR circuit 709 creates a logic sum of the reversed signal of the operational mode signal S301 and the reversed signal of the signal outputted from the switching circuit 708, and outputs the logic sum to the ignition controller 161. <br><br>
The ignition control unit 700 configured as described above usually permits the ignition control under the "engine - starting and idle SW mode" because as shown in Fig. 17, the signal outputted from the OR circuit 709 usually exhibits the "H" level under the "engine-starting and idle SW mode".<br>
On the contrary, under the "engine - stopping and vehicle-starting mode", when thevehicle is stopped and the engine is automatically stopped, the ignition control unit 700 permits the ignition control under a condition that the driver is in the seatingg state and_the throttle is opened, or the vehicular speed is larger than zero.  On the their hand, in the case where the vehicle in the running state is stopped, if the seating state of the driver is detected, the ignition control is prohibited and thereby the engine is automatically stopped; however, if the seating state of the driver is not detected, the permission of the ignition control is continued and thereby the engine is not automatically stopped. <br>
Accordingly, if there occurs a failure of the seating switch 254 and thereby it cannot be detected that the driver sits on the seat although he actually sits on the seat, the engine is not automatically stopped, even<br><br>
when the vehicle in the running state is stopped, and accordingly, it is not required to start the engine for starting the vehicle.  That is to say, even if there occurs a failure of the seating switch 254 in the system permitting automatic start-up of the engine provided that the driver sits on the seat, there does not occur any hindrance in running the vehicle.<br>
Further, this embodiment is configured such that even if the seating state of the driver is detected when the vehicle in the running state is stopped, the ignition control is not immediately prohibited, but prohibited after an elapse of a specific time (three seconds in this embodiment).  Accordingly, upon temporary stoppage of the vehicle at an intersection, or upon making U-turn the vehicle in which the driver is in the seating state, the vehicular speed is substantially zero, and the throttle is nearly full-closed, the starting state of the engine can be continued. <br>
An ignition knocking control unit 200 shown in Fig. 13 prevents occurrence of knocking by retarding the ignition timing upon acceleration more than the ignition timing upon usual rotation according to each operation mode.  In particular, according to this embodiment, the<br><br>
retarded amount of the ignition timing upon vehicle-starting acceleration from the engine - stoppage state is larger than the retarded amount of the ignition timing upon usual acceleration from the engine rotating state, whereby occurrence of knocking upon vehicle-starting acceleration, which is inherent to the vehicle on which the automatic engine stoppage/start-up control system is mounted, can be perfectly prevented. <br>
A standard ignition timing represented by a degree<br>
of advance angle (deg) from the compression top dead<br>
center(TDC) is previously registered, as the function of<br>
the engine speed Ne and the throttle opening degree 6 , in<br><br>
a standard ignition timing determining unit 207.  Fig. 19<br>
is a diagram showing a relationship between the engine<br>
speed Ne, throttle opening degree 6 , and standard<br>
ignition timing according to this embodiment.  The<br>
» <br>
standard ignition timing represented by the advance angle<br>
deg is taken as 15  (deg) in an engine speed range of 2500<br>
rpm or less, and is gradually increased depending on the<br><br>
engine speed Ne around engine speed of 2500 rpm or over. —<br>
If the engine speed Ne is in a range of 700 rpm 
 <br>
engine speed Ne is in a range of 700 rpm 
<br>
If a rate of change of the throttle opening degree detected by the throttle sensor 257 exceeds a specificvalue, an acceleration deciding unit 205 decides that the ,accelerating operation has been performed and outputs an acceleration detecting signal of the "H" level. A water temperature deciding unit 206 decides the temperature of engine cooling water on the basis of the detection signal from the waster temperature sensor 155, and outputs a signal of the "H" level if the water temperatdre exceeds a specific temperature (50°C in this embodiment). <br>
An AND circuit 202 outputs a logic product of the usual acceleration signal Saccl, acceleration detection signal, water temperature decision signal, and reversed signal of the operational mode signal S301.  An AND circuit 203 outputs a logic product of the vehicle - starting<br><br>
acceleration signal Sacc2, acceleration detection signal, water temperature decision signal, and operational mode signal S36l. <br>
If the outputs from the AND circuits 202 and 203 ach exhibit the "L" level, that is, if the vehicle is not in the acceleration state, an ignition timing (upon acceleration) correcting unit 204 supplies the standard ignition timing determined by the standard ignition timing determining unit 207 (see Fig. 19) to the ignition controller 161.  The ignition controller 161 carries out<br>
I<br>
the ignition operation with the ignition timing supplied<br><br>
from the ignition timing (upon acceleration) correcting<br><br>
unit 204.<br><br>
If the signal outputted from the AND circuit 202 exhibits the "H" level, that is, if under the "engine-starting and idle SW mode" shown in Fig. 17, the engine speed Ne is in the range of 700 rpm 
the water temperature exceeds the specific value (50C m this embodiment), the ignition timing represented by the<br>
advance angle is retarded up to 7° irrespective of the result determined by the standard ignition timing determining unit 207 as shown by a broken line A in Fig.<br><br><br>
20.<br>
If the signal outputted from the AND circuit 203 exhibits the "H" level, that is, if under the "engine-stopping and vehicle-starting mode" shown in Fig. 17, the engine speed Ne is in the range of 700 rpm 
<br>
The ignition timing (upon acceleration) correcting unit 204 has a counter 204a.  If either of the signals outputted from the AND circuits 202 and 203 exhibits the "H" level, the above-described retarded ignition is immediately carried out by a specific number of times<br>
(three times in this embodiment) by means of the ignition timing (upon acceleration) correcting unit 204, and then the retarded ignition is immediately returned to the usual ignition timing determined by the standard ignition timing determining unit 207.<br><br>
According to the ignition knocking control, it is<br><br><br>
possible to make the retarded amount upon vehicle-starting lacceleration different from the retarded amount upon usual acceleration from an intermediate rotational region.  To be more specific, by setting the retarded amount uppon vehicle-starting acceleration larger than the retarded amount upon usual acceleration from the intermediate rotational region, it is possible to prevent<br><br>
occurrence of knocking not only upon the usual acceleration from the intermediate rotational region but also upon vehicle - starting acceleration.<br>
Ini'the head lamp control unit 800 shown in Fig. 14, an Ne deciding unit  801 decides, on the basis of the detection signal from the Ne sensor 153, whether or not the engine speed is a specific setting speed (less than the idling speed) or more.  If the engine speed is the setting speed or more, the Ne deciding unit 801 outputs a signal of the "H" level.  An AND circuit 802 outputs a logic product of the signal outputted from the Ne deciding unit 801 and the reversed signal of the operational mode signal S301.  An AND circuit 803 outputs a logic product of the signal outputted from the Ne deciding unit 801 and the operational mode signal S101.<br>
If the signal outputted from the AND circuit 802<br><br>
exhibits the "H" level, a lighting/dimming switching unit 804 outputs a signal of the "H" level, and if the signal outputted from the AND circuit 802 exhibits the "L" level, the lighting/dimming switching unit 804 outputs a pulse signal of the duty ratio of 50%.  If the signal outputted from the AND circuit 803 exhibits the "H" level, a lightingi/multi - stage dimming switching unit 805 outputs a signal of the "H" level, and if the signal outputted from the AND circuit 803 exhibits the "L" level, a timer 805a counts the continuation time of the outputted signal and the lighting/multi-stage dimming switching unit 805 outputs a pulse signal with its duty ratio gradually reduced depending on the continuation time of the outputted signal.  In this embodiment, the duty ratio is stepwise reduced by each 0.5 to 1 second from 95% to 50%. With such a stepwise dimming manner, since the quantity of light is instantly, linearly reduced, it is possible to achieve the power-saving and ensure a high commercial value.<br>
According to such a head lamp control, as shown in Fig. 16, the head lamp is lighted or dimmed the light depending on the engine speed Ne under the "engine-starting and idle SW mode", and is lighted and stepwise dimmed depending on the engine speed Ne under the<br><br>
"engine-stopping and vehicle - starting mode". Accordingly, it is possible to suppress the discharge of the battery upon vehicle stoppage while sufficiently keeping the visibility from a vehicle running in the opposed direction.  As a result, the amount of power in a battery charged by a generator upon starting vehicle is decreased<br>
i<br>
later on and the electronic load of the generator is reduced,  thereby enhancing the acceleration performance upon starting of vehicle.<br>
In the by-starter control unit 900 shown in Fig. 14, the detection signal from the water temperature sensor 155 is inputted in a water temperature deciding unit 901. If the water temperature is a first predetermined value (50C in this embodiment) or more, the water temperature deciding unit 901 outputs a signal of the "H" level to close the by-starter relay 164, and if the water temperature is a second predetermined value (10C in this embodiment) or less, the water temperature deciding unit 901 outputs a signal of the "L" level to open the by-starter relay 164. <br>
According to such a by-starter control, as the water temperature becomes higher, the fuel becomes denser, and as the water temperature becomes lower, the fuel<br><br>
automatically becomes thinner.  In this embodiment, the opening/closing temperature of the by-starter relay 164 employs hysteresis, so that it is possible to prevent an unnecessary opening/closing operation of the by-starter relay 164 which may be caused near a critical temperature.<br><br>
In a charging control unit 500 shown in Fig. 14, the detection signal from the vehicular speed sensor 255 and the detection signal from the throttle sensor 257 are inputted in an acceleration operation detecting unit 502. As shown in Fig. 17, if the vehicular speed is larger than zero and the throttle is changed from the full-closed state to the full-opened state for 0.3 second or less, the acceleration detecting unit 502 decides that the acceleration is performed, and outputs an acceleration detecting pulse. <br>
A charging (upon acceleration) restricting unit 504 controls a regulator rectifier 167 in response to the acceleration detecting pulse signal to reduce a charging voltage of the battery 168 from a usual voltage, that is, 14.5 V to 12.0 V.<br>
The charging (upon acceleration) restricting unit 504 starts a six-second timer 504a in response to the<br><br><br>
acceleration detecting pulse.  If the timer 504a times out; the engine speed Ne becomes the setting speed or more; or the throttle opening degree is reduced, the charging ,restriction is released to return the charging voltage from 12.0 V to 14.5 V.<br>
The detection signals from the vehicular speed sensor 255, the Ne sensor 153, and the throttle sensor 257 are inputted in the vehicle starting, operation <br>
     detectingl uit 503.  As shown in Fig. 17, if the vehicular speed is zero and the throttle is opened when the engine, speed Ne is the setting speed (2500 rpm in this embodiment) or less, the vehicle - starting operation defecting unit 503 decides that the vehicle - starting operation!, is performed, and outputs a vehicle-starting operationdetecting pulse.<br>
When detecting the vehicle-starting operation detecting pulse signal, a charging (upon vehicle start¬up) restricting unit 505 controls the regulator rectifier 167 to reduce the charging voltage of the battery 168 from the usual voltage, that is, 14.5 V to 12.0 V.<br><br>
The charging (upon vehicle start-up) restricting unit 505 starts a seven-second timer 505a in response to<br><br>
the vehicle-starting operation detecting pulse.  If the timer 505a times out; the engine speed Ne becomes the setting speed or more; or the throttle opening degree is reduced,•the charging restriction is released to return the charging voltage from 12.0 V to 14.5 V.<br>
According to such charging control, when the throttle is rapidly opened by the driver to effect rapid acceleration or starting the vehicle in the stoppage state, the charging voltage is suppressed at low to temporarily reduce the electric load of the starter/generator 250.  Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the mechanical load of the engine 1200 applied from the ,starter/generator 250 and hence to improve the accelerating performance. <br>
     The non-seating (after vehicle stoppage) control nit 100 (Shown in Fig. 15 exceptionally permits, the tart-up of the engine by the starter switch 258 which is basically prohibited, with a timing where the driver can  experimentally start the engine by the starter switch. <br>
An AND circuit 102 outputs a logic product of the operational mode signal S301 and the reversed signal of the signal from a seating switch 254.  A non-seating<br><br>
continuation deciding unit 101 has a timer 101a and detects, after automatic stoppage of the engine, the "H" level of the signal from the AND circuit 102 for a specific time or more.  To be more specific, if under the "engine - stopping and vehicle-starting mode", the non-seating state of the driver is continued for a specific time or more after automatic stoppage of the engine, the level of the signal outputted from the AND circuit 102 is set at the "H" level.  As a result, the ignition controller 161 is energized to be in the ignition permissible state. 40110]—<br>
An OR circuit 103 outputs a logic sum of the signals outputted from the starter switch 258 and the throttle switch 257a.  An AND circuit 104 creates a logic product of the signals outputted from the non-seating continuation deciding unit 101 and the OR circuit 103, and outputs it to the starter relay 162.  To be more specific,  if the starter switch 258 is turned on or the throttle is opened after the non-seating state of the driver is continued for the specific time or more after the automatic stoppage of the engine under the "engine-stopping and vehicle-starting mode" (the signal outputted from the non-seating continuation deciding unit 101 exhibits the "H" level), the starter relay 162 is<br><br><br>
energized to drive the starter motor 171.  At this time, since the ignition controller 161 is energized by the non-seating continuation deciding unit 101, the start-up of the engine can be performed. <br>
According to such non-seating control after stoppage of the vehicle, even after the engine is stopped in response to the specific vehicle-stoppage condition, the start-up of the engine is exceptionally permitted by the starter switch 258 if it is detected that the non-seating state of the driver is continued for the specific time.  Accordingly, if the driver leaves, after automatic stoppage of the engine upon stoppage of the vehicle, the vehicle without cutting-off the main power source and when the driver comes back to the vehicle afterwards, forgetting that the engine is under the automatic stoppage control and operates the starter switch 258, she/he can still start the engine in the same manner as that in the usual state in which the engine is not under the automatic stoppage control. <br>
In the above - described non-seating control after stoppage of the vehicle, the start-up of the engine by the starter switch 258 is exceptionally permitted under the condition that the non-seating state of the driver is<br><br><br>
continued for the specific time or more after automatic<br>
stoppage of the engine in the "engine-stopping and<br>
vehicle - starting mode"; however, as shown by a broken<br>
line in Fig. 15, the start-up of the engine by the<br>
starter switch 258 may be permitted by controlling the<br>
operation switching unit 300 to switch the operational<br>
mode from the "engine - stopping and vehicle - starting mode"<br>
to the "engine-starting and idle SW mode".  Alternatively,<br>
.  as shown toy the "condition 5" in Fig. 18, the start-up of the engine by the starter switch 258 may be substantially<br>
permitted! by   cutting  off   the   main   switch   173.<br><br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible<br>
to make the retarded amount upon vehicle-starting<br>
acceleration different from the retarded amount upon<br><br>
acceleration from an intermediate engine speed range.  As a result it is possible to prevent occurrence of knocking not only upon acceleration from the intermediate engine sp:eed range, but also upon vehicle-starting acceleration by setting the retarded amount upon vehicle-starting acceleration larger than the retarded amount upon usual acceleration from the intermediate engine speed range.<br><br>

a specific vehicle-stopping condition, and restarting, after stoppage,<br>
the engine in response to a specific vehicle starting operation, said<br>
control  system   comprising   standard   ignition   timing   determining<br>
means for determining a standard ignition timing of an engine at least<br>
as a function of an engine speed; ignition timing upon acceleration<br>
correcting means for retarding an ignition timing upon acceleration of<br>
a vehicle more than said standard ignition timing determined by said<br>
standard ignition  timing determining means;   and  ignition  control<br>
means for   executing  ignition  with   said   determined   or   corrected<br>
ignition timing, characterized in that:<br>
said ignition timing upon acceleration correcting means makes the<br>
l| retarded amount upon vehicle-starting acceleration from the engine<br>
stopping   state   larger   than   the   retarded   amount   upon   usual<br>
acceleration engine operational state.<br>
i<br>
2.	The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said ignition timing upon<br>
acceleration correcting means retards an ignition timing upon vehicle-<br>
starting acceleration from the engine stopping state when the engine<br><br>
speed becomes a cranking speed or more.<br>
3.	The system as claimed in claim 1, having a water temperature sensor<br>
j for detecting a cooling water temperature of the engine, wherein said<br><br><br>
ignition   timing  upon   acceleration   correcting   means   corrects   the ignition timing upon acceleration of the vehicle under a condition that<br>
the wa'ter temperature detected by said water temperature sensor<br>
becomes a specific temperature or more.<br>
4.	The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said ignition timing upon<br>
acceleration   correcting   means   makes   the   number   of   times   for<br>
retarding   operations   upon   vehicle-starting   acceleration   from   the<br>
engine  stopping state equal to the number of times for retarding<br>
operations upon usual acceleration from the engine operational state.<br>
i<br><br>
5.	The system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein when the acceleration<br>
state requiring retard of the ignition timing is detected, said ignition<br>
control means immediately executes ignition at an ignition position<br>
set in accordance with the retarded amount obtained by said ignition<br>
timing  upon acceleration correcting means by a specific number of<br>
i times, and then immediately returns said ignition operation at an<br>
ignition position obtained by said ignition timing determining means.<br>
i<br>
6.	An automatic engine stoppage/start-up control system for stopping<br>
substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.	<br>

TITLE -Atomatic engine stoppage /start -up<br>
control system<br>
 To provide an automatic engine stoppage/start-up control system capable of preventing occurrence of knocking; not only upon acceleration from an intermediate engine speed range but also upon vehicle-starting acceleration.<br>
  If under the "engine-starting and idle SW mode", the engine speed Ne is in the range of 1500 rpm 
exceeds lithe specific value, the ignition timing is<br>
t further retarded from the value upon acceleration under<br><br>
the "engine-starting and idle SW mode" to 0</control></ending></starting></ending></starting></ending></starting></td>
