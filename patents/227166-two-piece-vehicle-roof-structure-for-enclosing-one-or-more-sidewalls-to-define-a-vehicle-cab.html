				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to structural members which are used in<br>
the construction of a vehicle body. The present invention, in particular relates to<br>
that portion of the vehicle body which carries or encloses a person at the<br>
location on the body where the operation of the vehicle is controlled including<br>
constructional elements of the cab such as a framework or panel or joint or such<br>
similar element. Specifically, the present invention relates to the roof portion of<br>
the cab structure having means for the treatment of cab atmosphere, such as<br>
heating, cooling or ventilating the air within the cab. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to two piece vehicle roof-structure for enclosing one or<br>
more sidewalls to define a vehicle cab.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known that work vehicles such as agriculture tractors and equipment as<br>
well as construction equipment are frequently operated in less than ideal<br>
environment conditions. For example such equipment is often operated in<br>
uncomfortably warm or cold weather and in dusty conditions caused by the work<br>
being done by the vehicle. It has thus been desired to provide operator's stations<br>
in such vehicles which insulate the operator from such adverse environmental<br>
conditions by filtering and conditioning the air inside the cab. One approach has<br>
been to dispose the components of an HVAC system in a housing having air inlet<br><br>
and outlet apertures. The housing is then mounted to the vehicle roof or<br>
installed into the roof structure. This results in a cumbersome structure which<br>
does not optimize the available space and frequently intrudes into the operator's<br>
station impairing the free movement of the operator and sometimes obstructing<br>
the operator's field of view. Similarly, the ducts, hoses, conduits, wiring and inlet<br>
and outlet vents are typically positioned based upon available space rather than<br>
efficient ergonomic placement.<br>
Previous attempts at overcoming these disadvantages have involved the use of<br>
one piece roto-molded roof structures which have a well or compartment	<br><br>
formed therein to receive the HVAC unit and having air ducts and vents molded<br>
into the roof structure. Such attempts have created their own disadvantages. For<br>
example, roto-molded parts do not have a high degree of dimensional stability<br>
and thus present a number of fit, mount-up and aesthetic difficulties. Further,<br>
one piece designs do not allow access for servicing, and present difficulties in the<br>
routing of conduit and wiring.<br>
US 3522839 discloses an air conditioner for heating, cooling, and pressurizing<br>
vehicle cabs. This literature does not specifically discuss a vehicle roof structure.<br>
A two piece molded roof structure is provided for enclosing the cab of a work<br>
vehicle. The roof structure has an upper roof member mounted to a lower roof<br>
member. The lower roof member has a plurality of contours and apertures for<br>
receiving the components of an HVAC system, and for defining air passages.<br>
When the upper and lower roof members are joined discrete air passages are<br>
formed between the roof members. The roof structure includes fresh and<br>
recirculated air intakes communicating via an uncirculated air duct and with an<br>
HVAC core chamber housing an HVAC core. Filters are mounted in the air<br>
intakes. One or more blowers communicate between the core chamber and a<br>
conditioned air duct which has vents communicating with the cab interior. Air is<br>
thus drawn in through the intakes and directed through the unconditioned air<br>
duct to the HVAC core and then the blower expels the air into the conditioned air<br>
duct and into the vehicle cab.<br>
Accordingly, there is a clear need in the art for a molded roof structure for a<br>
work vehicle which incorporates the components of an HVAC system into the<br><br>
structure itself in a way that facilitates servicing, routing of lines, and ergonomic<br>
placement of ducts and vents.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the invention to provide a two piece<br>
roof structure having the necessary intakes, ducts and vents for the HVAC<br>
system formed therein.<br>
Another object of the invention is the provision of a two piece roof structure<br>
having means for housing the HVAC components within the roof itself.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a two piece roof structure which<br>
facilitates servicing of HVAC components and routing of HVAC lines.<br>
An additional object of the invention is the provision of a two piece roof structure<br>
which can be compression molded using known techniques.<br>
The foregoing and other objects of the invention together with the advantages<br>

[0013] To acquaint persons skilled in the art most closely related to the present<br>
invention, one preferred embodiment of the invention that illustrates the best mode<br>
now contemplated for putting the invention into practice is described herein by and<br>
with reference to, the annexed drawings that form a part of the specification. The<br>
exemplary embodiment is described in detail without attempting to show all of the<br>
various forms and modifications in which the invention might be embodied. As such,<br>
the embodiment shown and described herein is illustrative, and as will become<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art, can be modified in numerous ways within the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention-the invention being measured by the appended<br>
claims and not by the details of the specification.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompaying Drawings<br>
[0014] For a complete understanding of the objects, techniques, and structure of<br><br>
the invention reference should be made to the following detailed description and<br>

[0020] Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view of the roof structure of Fig. 1 taken along the<br>
line 6-6.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0021] Referring now to the drawings it will be seen that a two-piece molded roof is<br>
designated generally by the numeral 10. Roof 10 is comprised generally of a lower<br>
roof member 12 and an upper roof member 14. Roof members 12 and 14 are<br>
preferably compression molded from a sheet molding compound (SMC). SMC is<br>
typically a thermoset composite material comprised of polyester or vinyl ester resin,<br>
glass fiber, calcium chloride and in some cases pigment. This material is formed into<br>
parts using a vertical press with a matched steel mold. With reference to the<br>
drawings it will be seen that lower roof member 12 is a unitarily molded structure<br>
having a plurality of apertures, contours, and recesses molded therein. A core<br>
chamber 24 is provided in the lower roof member 12 for receiving the HVAC cores<br>
26. HVAC cores 26 are preferably comprised of an air conditioning evaporator 26A<br>
and a heater core 26B to provide both heating and cooling functions. The thermo-<br>
switch and resistor for the HVAC can also be mounted in the core chamber 24 by<br>
means of an appropriate bracket or the like. Core chamber 24 is also provided with<br>
a pair of condensate wells 25 having condensate drain apertures 27 therein for<br>
draining away condensate from the cores 26. Appropriate drain tubes and/or valves<br><br>
may be connected at the apertures 27 to direct the flow of condensate as needed. A<br>
pair of blowers 28 are disposed in the core chamber 24 in blower areas 30, specially<br>
contoured to receive the blowers 28. Each blower 28 has an air inlet 32 and an air<br>
outlet 34. A pair of conditioned air ducts 36 are formed in the lower roof member 12<br>
adjacent to the blower areas 30 such that conditioned air from HVAC cores 26 is<br>
passed through the blowers 28 via the air inlets 32 and expelled at an elevated<br>
pressure and velocity into the conditioned air ducts 36. The conditioned air is<br>
distributed into the cab by way of conditioned air vents 38 molded in the conditioned<br>
air ducts 36 of lower roof member 12. While the drawings depict three conditioned<br>
air vents 38 in each duct 36, those skilled in the art will recognize that more or less<br>
vents may be utilized in various locations as dictated by need or desire. It should be<br>
apparent that each conditioned air vent 38 may be fitted with control louvers (not<br>
shown) to allow an operator to more precisely control the amount and direction of air<br>
flow within the cab. Conditioned air ducts 36 may be fitted with duct covers 40 to<br>
maintain the conditioned air at an elevated pressure within the ducts 36 while<br>
allowing for insulation between the conditioned air ducts 36 and the upper roof<br>
member 14. Duct covers 40 are optional and may be used to seal the conditioned<br>
air ducts 36. Alternatively sealing means may be provided between the lower 12 and<br>
upper 14 roof members to provide air-tight enclosure of the ducts 36 in lieu of duct<br>
covers 40. It is preferred to use a foam or mastic type seal between the duct covers<br>
40 and the lower roof member 12 to ensure an air-tight enclosure.<br>
[0022] Adjacent to each conditioned air duct 36 is an unconditioned air duct 42.<br>
Each unconditioned air duct 42 includes a first air intake aperture 44 and a second<br>
air intake aperture 46. First air intake aperture 44 is disposed along the outer<br>
periphery of the lower roof member 12 and is adapted to receive a first filter element<br>
48. First filter element 48 is removably fitted into a fresh air duct 50 molded into the<br>
underside of lower roof member 12 and surrounding the first air intake aperture 44.<br>
Fresh air duct 50 is enclosed by both a removable dust tray 52 in the vicinity of the<br>
first filter element 48 and by a fresh air intake louver 54. Thus fresh air is drawn in<br>
through intake louver 54 and passed through first filter element 48 before entering<br><br>
the unconditioned air duct 42. The second air intake apertures 46 are each disposed<br>
adjacent to and opposite the first air intake apertures 44 in the unconditioned air duct<br>
42. A second filter element 56 is removably fitted to the second air intake aperture<br>
46. Those having skill in the art will recognize that the unconditioned air ducts 42<br>
are under vacuum induced by the blowers 28. Thus unconditioned air entering the<br>
second air intake aperture 46 is passed through the second filter element 56 before<br>
entering the unconditioned air duct 42. It should be apparent from the drawings that<br>
the conditioned air ducts 36 are isolated from the unconditioned air ducts 42.<br>
Accordingly, unfiltered, unconditioned air is drawn into the air intake apertures 44<br>
and 46 and passes through filter elements 48 and 56 respectively to enter the<br>
unconditioned air duct 42. The filtered air is then directed through the HVAC cores<br>
26 where it is either heated or cooled. The conditioned air then passes into the core<br>
chamber 24 and further into the blowers 28. The blowers 28 expel the conditioned<br>
air at an elevated pressure and velocity into the conditioned air duct 36 where it is<br>
directed into the cab by way of the conditioned air vents 38. Partition walls 58 are<br>
provided in the lower roof member 12 to ensure that unconditioned air is passed<br>
through, rather than around, the HVAC cores 26. Tabs 60 are provided on the<br>
HVAC core assembly to matingly engage the partition walls 58. Lines 68 to and from<br>
the HVAC cores 26 are routed through the unconditioned air ducts 42 to apertures<br>
70 provided in the lower roof member 12 for connection to components located<br>
elsewhere on the vehicle.<br>
[0023] Upper roof member 14 has essentially the same peripheral profile as the<br>
lower roof member 12. Accordingly, upper roof member 14 is matingly fitted to the<br>
lower roof member 12 to enclose the areas containing the HVAC components. As<br>
such the upper roof member 14 serves to enclose the ducts 36 and 42 and the core<br>
chamber 24 to form discrete air passages within the roof 10. However, as previously<br>
discussed above duct covers 40 may be utilized to enclose the conditioned air ducts<br>
36. Upper roof member 14 further includes removable access panels 62 and 64 to<br>
permit servicing of the HVAC components through access apertures 72 and 74<br>
respectively. It should also be noted that the roof 10 may be provided with a sun<br><br>
roof (not shown) without interfering with the HVAC system. To provide roof 10 with a<br>
sun roof it is only necessary to remove the portion of upper roof member 14<br>
designated at 75 and enclose the resulting aperture with an appropriate window or<br>
the like which may be hinged, retractable or removable. Roof member 14 also<br>
includes drainage channels 76 for directing the flow of rain. Those having skill in the<br>
art will recognize that it may be desirable to provide roof 10 with weather stripping<br>
and insulation between the members 12 and 14. It will also be recognized that roof<br>
members 12 and 14 may be joined together using any one of a number of<br>
conventional means including thread cutting fasteners and/or adhesives. It is<br>
preferred to use a mastic type seal around the periphery of the roof members 12 and<br>
14 to provide a weatherproof seal for the assembled roof 10. Foam strip insulation<br>
may also be used to seal the optional duct covers 40 and/or between the roof<br>
members. Additional foam strip insulation may be employed within the roof 10 to<br>
prevent air movement in areas where dead air is used as an insulating technique.<br>
 [0024] When assembled roof 10 serves to provide the roof portion of a cab<br>
enclosure for an agricultural vehicle or the like. As such the remainder of the cab<br>
enclosure is defined by a floor (not shown) and sidewalls 66. Sidewalls 66 may be in<br>
the form of metal, plastic or glass panels which are joined to the roof 10 through<br>
conventional means. It should be noted that the sidewalls 66 are sealed to the lower<br>
roof member 12 between the first air intake apertures 44 and the second air intake<br>
apertures 46. Thus outside air, which tends to be dirtier under working conditions, is<br>
drawn into the roof 10 by way of intake louvers 54 and is filtered by first filter<br>
elements 48. Excess debris is trapped in the dust trays 52. First filter elements 48<br>
can be serviced by removing and emptying the dust trays 52 from outside the cab to<br>
provide access to the filter element 48. Cab air is recirculated by drawing air from<br>
inside the cab through the second air intake aperture 46 and second filter element<br>
56. Second filter element 56 may be serviced from inside the cab. Unconditioned<br>
air from inside and outside the cab is combined in the unconditioned air duct 42<br>
before being directed to the HVAC cores. When assembled the roof 10 further<br>
includes a pair of drip edges 78 and 80 which serve to facilitate dripping of water at<br><br>
the prescribed locations rather than being directed to the sidewalls 66 and the seal<br>
between the sidewalls 66 and roof 10. A first drip edge 78 is provided at the joint<br>
between upper roof member 14 and lower roof member 12 around the periphery of<br>
roof 10. Drip edge 78 allows a large percentage of the water flowing off roof 10 to<br>
drip off without flowing into the sidewall area. Excess water which flows past first<br>
drip edge 78 and over the lower surface of lower roof member 12 drips away at the<br>
second drip edge 80. Second drip edge 80 is formed by a concave channel molded<br>
into lower roof member 14.<br>
[0025] It is contemplated that the various air intakes, vents, filters and the like may<br>
be provided in various locations and numbers without departing from the scope and<br>
spirit of the invention. For example it may be desirable to provide access to all filters<br>
from inside or outside the cab as the vehicle design dictates. It is further<br>
contemplated that the roof 10 may be fitted with a number of fixtures such as lights,<br>
entertainment systems or instrumentation which may necessitate relocation of the<br>
above described elements of the invention, such variations are within the scope of<br>
the invention.<br>
[0026] Thus it can be seen that the objects of the invention have been satisfied by<br>
the structure presented above. While in accordance with the patent statutes, only<br>
the best mode and preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented and<br>
described in detail, it is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the<br>
precise form disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of<br>
the above teachings. The embodiment was chosen and described to provide the<br>
best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application to<br>
thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various<br>
embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use<br>
contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the scope of the<br>
invention as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance<br>
with the breadth to which they are fairly and legally entitled.<br><br>
