METHOD FOR CONTROLLING ENGINE SPEED IN A HYBRID<br>
ELECTRIC VEHICLE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	This invention pertains generally to control systems for hybrid<br>
powertrain control systems, including those employing electro-mechanical<br>
transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Hybrid vehicles (HEVs) have propulsion systems that consist<br>
of at least one electric motor or electric machine in combination with at least<br>
one other power source. Typically, the other power source is a gasoline or<br>
diesel engine. There are various types of HEVs depending on how the electric<br>
motor(s) and other power source(s) are combined with one another in order to<br>
provide propulsion for the vehicle, including series, parallel and compound<br>
HEVs.<br>
[0003]	Powertrain architectures for HEVs manage the input and output<br>
torques of various prime movers, most commonly internal combustion engines<br>
and electric machines. Series hybrid architectures are generally characterized<br>
by an internal combustion engine driving an electric generator which in turn<br>
provides electrical power to an electric drivetrain and to an energy storage<br>
system, comprising a battery pack. The internal combustion engine in a series<br>
HEV is not directly mechanically coupled to the drivetrain. The electric<br>
generator may also operate in a motoring mode to provide a starting function<br>
to the internal combustion engine, and the electric drivetrain may recapture<br>
vehicle braking energy by also operating in a generator mode to recharge the<br>
battery pack. Parallel HEV architectures are generally characterized by an<br>
internal combustion engine and an electric motor which both have a direct<br>
mechanical coupling to the drivetrain. The drivetrain conventionally includes<br>
a shifting transmission to provide the necessary gear ratios for wide range<br>
operation.<br><br>
2<br>
[0004]	Electrically variable transmissions (EVT) are known which<br>
provide for continuously variable speed ratios by combining features from<br>
both series and parallel HEV powertrain architectures. EVTs are operable<br>
with a direct mechanical path between an internal combustion engine and a<br>
final drive unit thus enabling high transmission efficiency and application of<br>
lower cost and less massive motor hardware. EVTs are also operable with<br>
engine operation mechanically independent from the final drive or in various<br>
mechanical/electrical split contributions (i.e., input-split, output-split and<br>
compound-split configurations) thereby enabling high-torque continuously<br>
variable speed ratios, electrical energy-dominated launches, regenerative<br>
braking, engine off idling, and two-mode operation.<br>
[0005]	As noted, such complex EVT HEVs utilize one or more electric<br>
machines and require advanced energy transmission, conversion and storage<br>
systems to supply electrical energy to and receive and store electrical energy<br>
from these machines, and typically comprise, for example, at least one electric<br>
machine, power inverter module, power bus, electrical energy storage device,<br>
such as a battery, as well as various control electronics, control algorithms and<br>
other associated items. The energy storage system (ESS) may comprise any<br>
suitable energy storage system that is adapted for high-density energy storage,<br>
including a battery, ultracapacitor, or other high-density energy storage device.<br>
As used herein, reference to a battery includes not only a single battery, also<br>
includes any combination of single or multiple batteries, or cells thereof, into a<br>
battery pack or array, or a plurality of battery packs or arrays. As used herein,<br>
the term battery generally refers to any secondary or rechargeable battery.<br>
[0006]	Significant attention has been given to maintaining the<br>
operational performance of batteries used in HEV applications, including<br>
maintaining the battery pack state of charge (SOC). The SOC is defined<br>
generally as the ratio of the residual charge in a battery relative to its full<br>
charge capacity. Various hardware and software control strategies have been<br>
adjusted for determining and maintaining the SOC of the battery.<br>
[0007]	Vehicles, including HEVs, are expected to accelerate in<br>
response to operator torque requests, including achieving various launch<br>
characteristics, e.g., an elapsed time to reach a speed. A vehicle launch is<br><br>
3<br>
generally associated with starting the motion of the vehicle from a stop,<br>
typically characterized by the speed of the vehicle, such as from zero km/h to<br>
thirty km/h, and a required torque output. Launch conditions also exist during<br>
other periods of vehicle operation, such as acceleration from a low-speed<br>
interval, or seeking to maintain or increase speed while negotiating an incline.<br>
[0008]	A hybrid system application can underutilize the energy storage<br>
system, due to several factors including the size and power capacity of the<br>
primary power source, i.e., the internal combustion engine, and, the specific<br>
speed/load duty cycle of the vehicle. In at least one specific case the<br>
maximum energy storage usage has been shown to be about half of an<br>
allowable usage limit. In a hybrid system, it is desirable to make full use of<br>
the energy storage system in transient operating conditions, i.e., acceleration<br>
and decelerations, to reduce the fuel usage.<br>
[0009]	Current operating systems typically optimize fuel economy by<br>
minimizing the power losses associated with operation at a specific output<br>
torque and speed (thus a specific power). This is accomplished by solving<br>
equations at quasi-steady state operating points to direct power flows from the<br>
primary power source or the secondary power source.<br>
[0010]	Current system operation can be described with reference to an<br>
operator torque request (Toreq) in the form of a throttle tip-in/tip-out<br>
maneuver. The operator torque request (To_req) is typically input to the<br>
system via the throttle, which is linked to an output torque command<br>
(Tocmd) in the hybrid control system. The hybrid control system monitors<br>
system operation at each operating point as the vehicle accelerates, and<br>
determines a power flow from the electrical machine and the engine through<br>
the EVT for each point, typically using engine speed and torque as two key<br>
criteria to determine the power flow from the primary power source and the<br>
hybrid transmission system. Determining these points along with the operator<br>
torque request solves the dynamic system equations and determines the power<br>
flow from the energy storage system. In this maneuver the engine speed<br>
changes to follow the optimal quasi-steady state operating point. It may<br>
accelerate to a high engine speed from idle and back down as the throttle input<br>
is reduced back to zero, with additional torque generated by energy transfer to<br><br>
4<br>
the electric machine to the EVT. In the case of a throttle tip in to a steady<br>
state point, the engine reaches its optimal operating speed by following the<br>
optimal engine speed trajectory as defined by the current control system logic.<br>
In this system there are fixed ramp rates for engine speed changes. The fixed<br>
ramp rates are typically set as maximum control limits, and do not adjust for<br>
transient maneuvers. Solving the equations to meet the operator torque<br>
request in this manner does not optimize the system for transient operation.<br>
[0011]	What is needed is an optimization scheme for a hybrid<br>
powertrain system which looks at the combination of the power sources over a<br>
range of operating points that occur during a transient event, e.g., a vehicle<br>
acceleration event resulting from an operator torque request. It is desirable to<br>
develop an optimization scheme for vehicle operation which optimizes the<br>
system for transient operation and more fully utilizes the capability of the<br>
electrical energy storage system while ensuring the management and<br>
protection of the ESS under launch conditions, to meet the operator torque<br>
request.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012]	The invention may be described generally as a method for<br>
controlling operation of a hybrid powertrain, the hybrid powertrain comprising<br>
an internal combustion engine, an electric energy storage device, an electric<br>
machine, and an electro-mechanical transmission. The energy storage system<br>
and electric machine are electrically-operatively coupled for power flow<br>
therebetween. The engine, electric machine, and the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission are mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit power<br>
therebetween to generate a power flow to an output. The method comprises<br>
determining optimum engine operation and an engine capability, and an<br>
operator torque request. States of parameters of the electrical energy storage<br>
device are monitored. A limit to the engine capability is determined based<br>
upon the optimum engine operation, the engine capability, and the states of the<br>
parameters of the electrical energy storage device. Power limits of the energy<br>
storage device are determined based upon the states of the parameters of the<br>
energy storage device. The limit to the engine capability is adjusted based<br><br>
5<br>
upon the power limits of the energy storage device. The engine operation is<br>
controlled based upon the engine capability and the adjusted limit to the<br>
engine capability. These and other aspects of the invention will become<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the<br>
following detailed description of the embodiments.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0013] The invention may take physical form in certain parts and<br>
arrangement of parts, an embodiment of which is described in detail and<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and<br>
wherein:<br>
[0014] Figs. 1 and 2 are schematic diagrams of an exemplary architecture<br>
for a control system and powertrain, in accordance with the present invention;<br>
[0015] Fig. 3 is a data graph, in accordance with the present invention;<br>

invention; and,<br>
[0017] Figs. 5 and 6 are data graphs, in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0018]	Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions are for<br>
the purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of<br>
limiting the same, Fig. 1 depicts a schematic diagram of hybrid powertrain<br>
comprising an internal combustion engine, transmission, and accompanying<br>
control module 5 that have been constructed in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0019]	The invention described herein may be used as a control<br>
algorithm for operation in a hybrid powertrain system of the type described in<br>
commonly assigned US Patent Number 5,931,757, entitled TWO-MODE<br>
COMPOUND SPLIT ELECTRO-MECHANICAL VEHICULAR TRANSMISSION, which is<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety. The hybrid powertrain disclosed<br>
therein comprises a compound-split electrically variable transmission for a<br>
hybrid electric vehicle which has characteristics of both a series and a parallel<br><br>
6<br>
device which generally comprise at least one drive motor, such as an internal<br>
combustion engine, at least one electric machine that is adapted to both<br>
provide propulsion to the vehicle and generate electric power for storage on<br>
the vehicle, and the ESS which typically comprises a rechargeable or<br>
secondary battery, as described herein.<br>
[0020]	Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, a vehicular powertrain system<br>
10 is now described, comprising an internal combustion engine and an electric<br>
energy storage device which are adapted to transfer energy to electric<br>
machines and an electro-mechanical transmission. The engine and the electric<br>
machines and the electro-mechanical transmission are selectively operative to<br>
transmit torque therebetween to generate an output, typically a driveline, and<br>
having characteristics of torque and speed. The electric machines and the<br>
electro-mechanical transmission comprise one representative form of a multi-<br>
mode, compound-split, electrically variable transmission (EVT) particularly<br>
suited for implementing the controls of the present invention and designated<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The EVT 10 has an input member 12 preferably<br>
comprising shaft that is directly driven by the engine 14 or, as shown in Fig. 2,<br>
a transient torque damper 16 may be incorporated between the output member<br>
of the engine 14 and the input member of the EVT 10. The transient torque<br>
damper 16 may incorporate, or be employed in conjunction with, a torque<br>
transfer device (not shown) to permit selective engagement of the engine 14<br>
with the EVT 10, but it must be understood that such a torque transfer device<br>
is not utilized to change, or control, the mode in which the EVT 10 operates.<br>
[0021]	In the embodiment depicted the engine 14 may be a fossil fuel<br>
engine, such as a diesel engine, which is readily adapted to provide its<br>
available power output through shaft 12. The engine 14 preferably operates,<br>
after start-up, and during the majority of its input, at a constant speed or at a<br>
variety of constant speeds in accordance with a desired operating point as may<br>
be determined from operator inputs and driving conditions.<br>
[0022]	The EVT 10 utilizes three planetary gear subsets 24, 26 and 28.<br>
The first planetary gear subset 24 has an outer gear member 30, that may<br>
generally be designated as the ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear<br>
member 32, generally designated as the sun gear. A plurality of planet gear<br><br>
7<br>
members 34 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 36 such that each planet gear<br>
member 34 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 30 and the inner<br>
gear member 32.<br>
[0023]	The second planetary gear subset 26 also has an outer gear<br>
member 38, generally designated as the ring gear, which circumscribes an<br>
inner gear member 40, generally designated as the sun gear. A plurality of<br>
planet gear members 42 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 44 such that each<br>
planet gear 42 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 38 and the inner<br>
gear member 40.<br>
[0024]	The third planetary gear subset 28 also has an outer gear<br>
member 46, generally designated as the ring gear, which circumscribes an<br>
inner gear member 48, generally designated as the sun gear. A plurality of<br>
planet gear members 50 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 52 such that each<br>
planet gear 50 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 46 and the inner<br>
gear member 48.<br>
[0025]	While all three planetary gear subsets 24, 26 and 28 are<br>
"simple" planetary gear subsets in their own right, the first and second<br>
planetary gear subsets 24 and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear<br>
member 32 of the first planetary gear subset 24 is conjoined, as through a hub<br>
plate gear 54, to the outer gear member 38 of the second planetary gear subset<br>
26. The conjoined inner gear member 32 of the first planetary gear subset 24<br>
and the outer gear member 38 of the second planetary gear subset 26 are<br>
continuously connected to by a sleeve shaft 58 to a first motor/generator 56,<br>
referred to herein variously as motor A or MA.<br>
[0026]	The planetary gear subsets 24 and 26 are further compounded<br>
in that the carrier 36 of the first planetary gear subset 24 is conjoined, as<br>
through a shaft 60, to the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear subset 26. As<br>
such, carriers 36 and 44 of the first and second planetary gear subsets 24 and<br>
26, respectively, are conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to<br>
the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear subset 28, as through a torque transfer<br>
device 62 which, as will be hereinafter more fully explained, is employed to<br>
assist in the selection of the operational modes of the EVT 10. Torque transfer<br><br>
8<br>
device 62 may also be referred to herein variously as second clutch, clutch two<br>
orC2.<br>
[0027]	The carrier 52 of the third planetary gear subset 28 is connected<br>
directly to an output member 64. When the EVT 10 is used in a land vehicle,<br>
the output member 64 is typically connected to the vehicular axles (not shown)<br>
that may, in turn, terminate in the drive members (also not shown), to provide<br>
tractive torque thereto. The drive members are either front or rear wheels of<br>
the vehicle on which they are employed, or they may be the drive gear of a<br>
track vehicle.<br>
[0028]	The inner gear member 40 of the second planetary gear subset<br>
26 is connected to the inner gear member 48 of the third planetary gear subset<br>
28, as through a sleeve shaft 66 that circumscribes shaft 60. The outer gear<br>
member 46 of the third planetary gear subset 28 is selectively connected to<br>
ground, represented by the transmission housing 68, through a torque transfer<br>
device 70. Torque transfer device 70, as is also hereinafter explained, is also<br>
employed to assist in the selection of the operational modes of the EVT 10.<br>
Torque transfer device 70 may also be referred to herein variously as first<br>
clutch, clutch one or C1.<br>
[0029]	The sleeve shaft 66 is also continuously connected to a second<br>
motor/generator 72, referred to herein variously as motor B or MB. All the<br>
planetary gear subsets 24, 26 and 28 as well as motor A and motor B (56, 72)<br>
are coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft 60. It should be<br>
noted that both motors A and B are of an annular configuration which permits<br>
them to circumscribe the three planetary gear subsets 24, 26 and 28 such that<br>
the planetary gear subsets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of the<br>
motors A and B. This configuration assures that the overall envelope-i.e., the<br>
circumferential dimension--of the EVT 10 is minimized.<br>
[0030]	A drive gear 80 may be presented from the input member 12.<br>
As depicted, the drive gear 80 fixedly connects the input member 12 to the<br>
outer gear member 30 of the first planetary gear subset 24, and the drive gear<br>
80, therefore, receives power from the engine 14 and/or the motor/generators<br>
56 and/or 72. The drive gear 80 meshingly engages an idler gear 82 which, in<br>
turn, meshingly engages a transfer gear 84 that is secured to one end of a shaft<br><br>
9<br>
86. The other end of the shaft 86 may be secured to a transmission fluid pump<br>
and 88 which is supplied transmission fluid from sump 37, delivering high<br>
pressure fluid to regulator 39 which returns a portion of the fluid to sump 37<br>
and provides regulated line pressure in line 41.<br>
[0031]	In the described exemplary mechanical arrangement, the output<br>
member 64 receives power through two distinct gear trains within the EVT 10.<br>
A first mode, or gear train, is selected when the first clutch Cl is actuated in<br>
order to "ground" the outer gear member 46 of the third planetary gear subset<br>
28. A second mode, or gear train, is selected when the first clutch Cl is<br>
released and the second clutch C2 is simultaneously actuated to connect the<br>
shaft 60 to the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear subset 28. As used herein,<br>
when a mode related to a gear train is referenced an upper case designation<br>
MODE 1 or MODE 2, or Ml or M2, will generally be used.<br>
[0032]	Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the EVT 10 is<br>
capable of providing a range of output speeds from relatively slow to<br>
relatively fast within each mode of operation. This combination of two modes<br>
with a slow to fast output speed range in each mode allows the EVT 10 to<br>
propel a vehicle from a stationary condition to highway speeds. In addition, a<br>
fixed-ratio state wherein both clutches C1 and C2 are simultaneously applied<br>
is available for efficient mechanical coupling of the input member to the<br>
output member through a fixed gear ratio. Furthermore, a neutral state<br>
wherein both clutches C1 and C2 are simultaneously released is available for<br>
mechanically decoupling the output member from the transmission. Finally,<br>
the EVT 10 is capable to provide synchronized shifts between the modes<br>
wherein slip speed across both clutches Cl and C2 is substantially zero.<br>
[0033]	Engine 14 is preferably electronically controlled by engine<br>
control module (ECM) 23 as illustrated in Fig. 2. ECM 23 is a conventional<br>
microprocessor-based diesel engine control module comprising such common<br>
elements as microprocessor, read only memory ROM, random access memory<br>
RAM, electrically programmable read only memory EPROM, high speed<br>
clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) circuitry, and<br>
input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate signal conditioning<br>
and buffer circuitry. ECM 23 functions to acquire data from a variety of<br><br>
10<br>
sensors and control a variety of actuators, respectively, of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally in bi-<br>
directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Among the various<br>
parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 are oil sump and engine coolant<br>
temperatures, engine speed (Ne), turbo pressure, and ambient air temperature<br>
and pressure. Various actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include<br>
fuel injectors, fan controllers, engine preheaters including glow plugs and<br>
grid-type intake air heaters. ECM preferably provides for well known torque<br>
based controls for engine 14 in response to a torque command Tecmd<br>
provided by the EVT control system. Such engine electronics, controls and<br>
quantities are generally well known to those skilled in the art and further<br>
detailed exposition thereof is not required herein<br>
[0034]	As should be apparent from the foregoing description the EVT<br>
10 selectively receives power from the engine 14. As will now be explained<br>
with continued reference to Fig. 1, the EVT also receives power from an<br>
electric storage device, i.e., the ESS, such as one or more batteries in battery<br>
pack module (BPM) 21. The powertrain system also includes such energy<br>
storage devices which are an integral part of the power flows thereof. Other<br>
electric storage devices that have the ability to store electric power and<br>
dispense electric power may be used in place of the batteries without altering<br>
the concepts of the present invention. The BPM 21 is high-voltage, DC-<br>
coupled to dual power inverter module (DPIM) 19 via DC lines 27. Current is<br>
transferable to or from the BPM 21 in accordance with whether the BPM 21 is<br>
being charged or discharged. DPIM 19 includes a pair of power inverters and<br>
respective motor controllers configured to receive motor control commands<br>
and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration<br>
functionality. Motor controllers are microprocessor based control modules<br>
comprising such common elements as microprocessor, read only memory<br>
ROM, random access memory RAM, electrically programmable read only<br>
memory EPROM, high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to<br>
analog (D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and<br>
appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. In motoring control, the<br>
respective inverter receives current from the DC lines and provides AC current<br><br>
11<br>
to the respective motor over high voltage phase lines 29 and 31, which is<br>
converted by the electric motor into torque which is transmitted to the<br>
transmission, referred to respectively as motor torques Ta and Tb. In<br>
regeneration control, the respective inverter receives AC current from the<br>
motor over high voltage phase lines 29 and 3 land provides current to the DC<br>
lines 27. The net DC current provided to or from the inverters determines the<br>
charge or discharge operating mode of the BPM 21. Preferably, MA and MB<br>
are three-phase AC machines, and the inverters comprise complementary<br>
three-phase power electronics. Individual motor speed signals Na and Nb for<br>
MA and MB, respectively, are also derived by the DPIM 19 from the motor<br>
phase information or conventional rotation sensors. Such motors, electronics,<br>
controls and quantities are generally well known to those skilled in the art and<br>
further detailed exposition thereof is not required herein.<br>
[0035]	Each of the aforementioned control modules, i.e., system<br>
controller 43, DPIM 19, BPM 21, ECM 23, is preferably a general-purpose<br>
digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central processing<br>
unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM), random access<br>
memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM),<br>
high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) circuitry,<br>
and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate signal<br>
conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of control<br>
algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in<br>
ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each computer. The<br>
various modules communicate via controller area network (CAN) bus 25 to<br>
transfer information. The CAN bus 25 effects structured communication of<br>
control parameters and commands between the various modules. The specific<br>
communication protocol utilized is application-specific. For example the<br>
preferred protocol for heavy duty applications is the Society of Automotive<br>
Engineers standard J1939.<br>
[0036]	Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the<br>
control modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that<br>
each algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in<br>
the non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br><br>
12<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 40, and 100 milliseconds<br>
during ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may<br>
be executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0037]	In the exemplary embodiment, system controller 43 comprises<br>
a pair of microprocessor based control modules designated as vehicle control<br>
module (VCM) 15 and transmission control module (TCM) 17. VCM and<br>
TCM may provide, for example, a variety of control and diagnostic functions<br>
related to EVT and vehicle chassis including, for example, engine torque<br>
commands, input speed control, and output torque control in coordination with<br>
regenerative braking, anti-lock braking and traction control. Particularly with<br>
respect to EVT functionality, system controller 43 functions to directly acquire<br>
data from a variety of sensors and directly control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the EVT over a plurality of discrete lines. For simplicity,<br>
System controller 43 is shown generally in bi-directional interface with EVT<br>
via aggregate line 33. Of particular note, system controller 43 receives<br>
frequency signals from rotation sensors for processing into input member 12<br>
speed Ni and output member 64 speed No for use in the control of EVT 10.<br>
Also illustrated is user interface (UI) block 13 which comprises such inputs to<br>
system controller 43 such as vehicle throttle position, push button shift<br>
selector (PBSS) for available drive range selection, brake effort and fast idle<br>
requests among others, from which an operator torque request (Toreq) is<br>
determined.<br>
[0038]	System controller 43 determines an engine torque command<br>
Tecmd which is provided to ECM 23. The engine torque command Te cmd<br>
is representative of the EVT torque contribution desired from the engine.<br>
System controller 43 also determines an engine speed command, Ne_cmd,<br>
representative of the desired input speed to the EVT, which in the direct<br>
coupled arrangement between the engine arid the EVT is also the desired<br>
engine speed operating point. With the direct coupled arrangement depicted<br>
herein, the engine torque and the EVT input torque, Te and Ti respectively, are<br><br>
13<br>
equivalent and may be referred to in the alternative herein. Similarly, the<br>
engine speed and the EVT input speed, Ne and Ni respectively, are equivalent<br>
and may be referred to in the alternative herein. Desired input speed operating<br>
points are preferably determined as disclosed in commonly assigned and co-<br>
pending United States patent application Serial Numbers 10/686,508<br>
(Attorney Docket Number GP-304193) and 10/686,034 (Attorney Docket<br>
Number GP-304194) which are incorporated herein by reference. A preferred<br>
speed control for a hybrid transmission is described in detail in commonly<br>
assigned and co-pending United States patent application Serial Number<br>
10/686,511 (Attorney Docket Number GP-304140) which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0039]	With reference to Fig. 3, a plot of output speed No along the<br>
horizontal axis versus input speed Ni across the vertical axis for the EVT 10 is<br>
illustrated. Synchronous operation, that is the input speed and output speed<br>
relationships whereat both clutch C1 and C2 are operating simultaneously with<br>
substantially zero slip speed thereacross is represented by line 91. As such, it<br>
represents the input and output speed relationships substantially whereat<br>
synchronous shifting from between modes can occur or whereat direct<br>
mechanical coupling from input to output can be effected by simultaneous<br>
application of both clutches Cl and C2, also known as fixed-ratio operation.<br>
Line 91 may be variously referred to herein as synchronous line, shift ratio<br>
line or fixed-ratio line.<br>
[0040]	To the left of the shift ratio line 91 is a preferred region of<br>
operation 93 for the first mode wherein Cl is applied and C2 is released. To<br>
the right of the shift ratio line 91 is a preferred region of operation 95 for the<br>
second mode wherein Cl is released and C2 is applied. When used herein<br>
with respect to clutches Cl and C2, the term applied indicates substantial<br>
torque transfer capacity across the respective clutch while the term released<br>
indicates insubstantial torque transfer capacity across the respective clutch.<br>
Since it is generally preferred to cause shifts from one mode to the other to<br>
occur synchronously, torque transfers from one mode into the other mode are<br>
caused to occur through a two clutch application fixed ratio wherein, for a<br>
finite period prior to the release of the presently applied clutch, the presently<br><br>
14<br>
released clutch is applied. And, the mode change is completed when fixed-<br>
ratio is exited by the continued application of the clutch associated with the<br>
mode being entered and the release of the clutch associated with the mode<br>
being exited.<br>
[0041]	While region of operation 93 is generally preferred for the<br>
operation of the EVT in MODE 1, it is not meant to imply that MODE 2<br>
operation of the EVT cannot or does not occur therein. Generally, however, it<br>
is preferred to operate in MODE 1 in region 93 because MODE 1 preferably<br>
employs gearsets and motor hardware particularly well suited in various<br>
aspects (e.g., mass, size, cost, inertial capabilities) to the high launch torques<br>
of region 93. Similarly, while region of operation 95 is generally preferred<br>
for the operation of the EVT in MODE 2, it is not meant to imply that MODE<br>
1 operation of the EVT cannot or does not occur therein. Generally, however,<br>
it is preferred to operate in MODE 2 in region 95 because MODE 2 preferably<br>
employs gearsets and motor hardware particularly well suited in various<br>
aspects (e.g., mass, size, cost, inertial capabilities) to the high speeds of region<br>
93. Region 93, wherein MODE 1 operation is generally preferred, may be<br>
considered a low speed region whereas region 95, wherein MODE 2 operation<br>
is generally preferred, may be considered a high speed region. A shift into<br>
MODE 1 is considered a downshift and is associated with a higher gear ratio<br>
in accordance with the relationship of Ni/No. Likewise, a shift into MODE 2<br>
is considered an upshift and is associated with a lower gear ratio in accordance<br>
with the relationship of Ni/No.<br>
[0042]	As surmised from the above description, the energy storage<br>
system and electric machine are electrically-operatively coupled for power<br>
flow therebetween, and the engine, electric machine, and the electro-<br>
mechanical transmission are mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit<br>
power therebetween to generate a power flow to the output 64.<br>
[0043]	Referring now to Fig. 4, there is depicted a flowchart for an<br>
algorithm, in accordance with the invention. The algorithm embodies a<br>
method for controlling operation of a hybrid powertrain, e.g., the exemplary<br>
hybrid powertrain described hereinabove, to generate an output at shaft 64<br>
characterized in terms of rotational speed, No and torque, To. The algorithm<br><br>
15<br>
is preferably regularly executed during one of the aforementioned control<br>
module loop cycles, e.g., 40 milliseconds, during ongoing engine and vehicle<br>
operation, to generate an engine speed command, Necmd. The method<br>
comprises determining optimum engine operation and an engine capability,<br>
and an operator torque request (Step 402). States of parameters of the<br>
electrical energy storage device are monitored (Step 402). A limit to the<br>
engine operating capability is determined based upon the optimum engine<br>
operation and the engine capability (Steps 404, 406). Power limits of the<br>
energy storage device are determined based upon the states of the parameters<br>
of the energy storage device (Step 412). The limit to the engine capability is<br>
adjusted based upon the power limits of the energy storage device (Step 418).<br>
The engine operation is controlled based upon the engine capability and the<br>
adjusted limit to the engine capability (Step 422A, B, and C). Electric power<br>
transmitted from the energy storage device to the electric machine is<br>
controlled to meet the operator torque request based upon the engine<br>
operation, which comprises determining power output from the engine with<br>
the engine operation controlled based upon the engine capability and the<br>
adjusted limit to the engine capability. Power is transmitted from the energy<br>
storage device to the electric machine to the electro-mechanical transmission<br>
and the power output is transmitted from the engine to the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission to generate the power flow to the output to meet the operator<br>
torque request. The overall operation is now described in greater detail.<br>
[0044]	The control algorithm is preferably executed to control<br>
operation of the powertrain to provide consistent vehicle launch<br>
characteristics. Vehicle launch conditions are defined broadly as conditions<br>
under which it is desirable to discharge the battery to provide vehicle<br>
propulsion, generally where the vehicle output speed is low and the desired<br>
output torque is high, such as acceleration from a stop, acceleration up an<br>
incline, and other operating conditions where it is desirable to discharge the<br>
ESS for vehicle propulsion. Launch conditions may be defined by a range of<br>
vehicle speeds and a range of desired vehicle output torques, or commanded<br>
output torques, associated with those vehicle speeds.<br><br>
16<br>
[0045]	The method ofFig. 4 is now described in detail. Various<br>
operating states are determined, including the operator torque request (To_req)<br>
via inputs from the IU 13, optimum operating states of the engine, i.e., an<br>
optimum engine speed (Neopt) and torque output (Te opt). The optimum<br>
engine speed (Ne_opt) and torque output (Te_opt) comprise engine operating<br>
conditions which achieve optimal engine operation at ideal operating<br>
conditions, including power output, fuel economy, and emissions. States of<br>
performance parameters of the electrical energy storage device (ESS) are also<br>
monitored (Step 402). The ESS performance parameters preferably include<br>
state of charge (SOC), battery temperature (Tbat), and electrical energy<br>
throughput (Throughput, in Amp-hours/hour). A exemplary method of<br>
determining parametric battery power limits for an ESS of an HEV which<br>
takes into account the battery SOC, temperature and amp-hour throughput is<br>
described in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial<br>
No. 10/965,671 (Attorney Docket GP-304118) and U.S. Patent Number<br>
6,946,818, which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[0046]	Engine capability, in the form of an engine speed ramp rate<br>
(ARPM/At), is determined (Step 404). The engine speed ramp rate is based<br>
upon the overall capability of the engine to accelerate, taking into account<br>
various engine design and control factors, and optimized engine operation in<br>
terms of fuel consumption and engine torque generation. A typical engine can<br>
have a maximum ramp rate in the range of 600 rpm/second and an optimal<br>
ramp rate of about 300 rpm/sec.<br>
[0047]	An engine speed ramp rate limit, Lim(ARPM/At), is determined<br>
based upon the optimum engine operation, the engine capability, and the<br>
performance parameters of the electrical energy storage device, in response to<br>
the operator torque request (Step 406). For example, when the battery SOC<br>
and temperature are within normal operating ranges, the ESS is capable of<br>
supplying energy to the electric machines MA, MB to carry much of an initial<br>
torque load for accelerating the vehicle to meet the operator torque request.<br>
Conversely, when the battery SOC is reduced, or the battery temperature is<br>
elevated, the ESS may not have the same capability for generating and<br>
carrying the output torque load. Thus, the engine speed ramp rate limit is used<br><br>
17<br>
to manage and control the engine. The engine speed ramp rate limit preferably<br>
comprises an array of predetermined calibration limits, defined in terms of<br>
engine speed ramp rate ARPM/At, and retrievable based upon factors related<br>
to the SOC, temperature and throughput, and the operator torque request,<br>
which further optimize the engine operation for the specific engine as applied<br>
to the specific EVT. An exemplary calibration is depicted with reference to<br>
Fig. 6, which graphically depicts values for the engine speed ramp rate limit,<br>
Lim(ARPM/At), determined based upon a difference between the optimal<br>
engine speed, Ne_opt, and a limited engine speed, Ne_lim, based upon battery<br>
usage. The limited engine speed, Nelim is preferably determined during each<br>
loop cycle based upon the current engine speed adjusted by the engine speed<br>
rate limit determined during the previous loop cycle, to limit the engine speed<br>
ramp rate based upon the battery usage, characterized by the states of the<br>
parameters of the energy storage device. The calibration lookup is based on<br>
the input and output of the rate limit function and the condition of the batteries<br>
as characterized by the states of the SOC, temperature and throughput. The<br>
calibration depicts high, medium, and low battery usage, which are determined<br>
based upon the parameters, i.e., high battery usage is characterized by low<br>
state of charge, high temperature, and high throughput, whereas low battery<br>
usage is characterized by high state of charge, medium temperature, and low<br>
throughput. As such, high battery usage leads to the most aggressive rate<br>
limiting, and low battery usage leads to the least aggressive rate limiting,<br>
which no rate limiting comprising an unlimited state, i.e., the engine speed<br>
changes as fast as the engine can increase in speed. This allows for tuning of<br>
the engine speed ramp rate limit based on the error between the input to the<br>
rate limit and the calibrated output, i.e., the optimal engine speed, Ne opt, and<br>
the limit engine speed, Nelim.<br>
[0048]	Therefore when the system requests a large change in engine<br>
speed the engine speed ramp rate limit permits quick response to meet the<br>
system request, whereas when the change is small the engine speed is more<br>
heavily rate limited. The predetermined calibration limits are preferably<br>
determined during pre-production development of the powertrain, and stored<br><br>
18<br>
in one of the control modules for retrieval by the algorithm during ongoing<br>
operation.<br>
[0049]	When, at step 408, the engine speed ramp rate is less than the<br>
engine speed ramp rate limit, i.e., ANe/At 
speed is adjusted by the engine speed ramp rate (Step 420), and the engine<br>
speed is controlled accordingly, in the form of a command for engine speed,<br>
Ne_cmd (Step 422C).<br>
[0050]	When, at step 408, the engine speed ramp rate is greater than<br>
the engine speed ramp rate limit, i.e., ANe/At &gt; Lim(ANe/At), then the engine<br>
operation is controlled based upon the engine speed ramp rate limit (Step 410).<br>
This includes calculating power limits of the ESS, based upon states for SOC,<br>
battery temperature, and energy throughput (Step 412). The power limits<br>
comprise predetermined power flow characteristics beyond which the ESS is<br>
damaged and battery life is reduced, including deep discharging or over-<br>
charging. When the ESS is not approaching the power limits, i.e., the states of<br>
the parameters have not surpassed predetermined thresholds, then the engine<br>
speed ramp rate is controlled to the engine speed ramp rate limit, i.e.,<br>
Lim(ANe/At) (Step 416) and the engine speed is controlled accordingly, in the<br>
form of the command for engine speed, Necmd (Step 422 A). The intent of<br>
this operation is to fully use electrical energy from the ESS through the<br>
electric motors MA and MB to generate tractive torque through the EVT to<br>
meet the operator torque request.<br>
[0051]	When the ESS approaches the power limits, i.e., the states of<br>
the parameters have attained or surpassed predetermined thresholds, then the<br>
limited engine speed ramp rate, i.e., Lim(ANe/At) is adjusted by an amount<br>
sufficient to avoid exceeding with the energy storage and power limits of the<br>
ESS, thus preventing damage to the ESS (Step 418). This is preferably<br>
accomplished using a proportional-derivative type control loop that monitors<br>
the rate at which the energy storage power is approaching the limit and<br>
correspondingly adjusts the engine speed ramp rate up to the predetermined<br>
limit in order to maintain an offset from the power limit. The engine speed is<br>
controlled accordingly, in the form of the command for engine speed, Necmd<br>
(Step 422B). In such situation, the limited engine speed ramp rate, i.e.,<br><br>
19<br>
LlM(ANe/At), is selectively increased by an amount that can be as much as<br>
necessary up to the ramp-rate capability of the engine, limited by a final<br>
engine speed command, Necmd.<br>
[0052]	Controlling the engine speed comprises generating the engine<br>
speed command, Ne_cmd, which is communicated to the ECM for controlling<br>
operation of the engine. When the engine speed command is determined, as<br>
described above, the system controller 43 determines required torque outputs<br>
from MA and MB to meet the operator torque request, taking into account the<br>
contribution of the engine to meet the operator torque request. Electric power<br>
is transmitted from the energy storage device to the electric machines to meet<br>
the operator torque request based upon the engine operation, including the<br>
adjusted limit to the engine speed command, simply described as Eq. 1:<br>
[0053]	Ta + Tb + Te = To_req.	[ 1 ]<br>
[0054]	The electrical power transmitted from the energy storage device<br>
to the electric machines is converted to mechanical torque and transmitted to<br>
the electro-mechanical transmission and the power output is transmitted from<br>
the engine to the electro-mechanical transmission to generate the power flow<br>
to the output to meet the operator torque request. The system controller<br>
commands transfer of electrical power from the ESS to the electric machines<br>
MA, MB, in conjunction with the engine operation to meet the speed<br>
command, Necmd, to meet the operator torque request, Toreq.<br>
[0055]	Thus, during each loop cycle, the algorithm acts to control and<br>
limit increase in the engine speed and increase utilization of the electrical<br>
energy to generate tractive torque, so long as the battery limits are not<br>
exceeded. When battery limits are exceeded, the engine utilization is<br>
increased by adjusting the engine speed ramp rate to cause more of the tractive<br>
power to be supplied by the engine. Engine torque output is increased by an<br>
amount necessary to achieve the engine speed ramp rate and the operator<br>
torque request. The new logic also links the engine ramp rate to the current<br>
state of the energy storage system such that limits are not exceeded if the<br>
energy storage is operating at its limits. Basically the engine ramp rate is<br>
phased out as the system approaches the maximum desired use of the batteries<br>
at the current operating points. This allows the new logic to adapt for<br><br>
20<br>
different duty cycles since it tries to use the energy storage system up to the<br>
extent of their limits during all transients.<br>
[0056]	Referring now to Fig. 5, results of operating the exemplary<br>
HEV powertrain system in response to a step-input torque request from a<br>
vehicle operator are graphically depicted, wherein different aspects of the<br>
invention are depicted. The upper portion of Fig. 5 depicts accelerator pedal<br>
input, engine speed (rpm) engine and battery power (kW) and output power<br>
for normal operation, whereas the lower portion depicts accelerator pedal<br>
input, engine speed (rpm), engine and battery power (kW) and output power<br>
for operation wherein the engine speed is limited in accordance with the<br>
invention described herein. As depicted, the output power is the same for<br>
operation in both modes, whereas the engine speed ramp-rate and maximum<br>
engine speed are limited, with the battery power providing a larger portion of<br>
the overall power during the acceleration event.<br>
[0057]	Due to the dynamic charge/discharge conditions experienced<br>
by the ESS in the HEV, and the desire to monitor and control states of the<br>
battery parameters associated with these conditions, the discharge power of<br>
the ESS is limited by control actions taken as a result of the states of the ESS<br>
parameters. Consequently, when the maximum battery discharge power is<br>
limited or reduced in conjunction with such control actions, the vehicle launch<br>
performance is reduced as compared to situations wherein the batteries are<br>
capable of full utilization and provision of the maximum battery discharge<br>
power. Thus the battery discharge power limits are expanded during the<br>
launch such that more battery power is utilized for short times to provide<br>
consistent vehicle performance, without damaging the battery.<br>
[0058]	The foregoing discussion discloses and describes exemplary<br>
embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will readily<br>
recognize from such discussion, and from the accompanying drawings and<br>
