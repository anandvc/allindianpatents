THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
'COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING POLYCARBONATE"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organised under the laws of Germany, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to the use of specific triazines in the preparation of<br>
compositions containing polycarbonate and those triazines and fatty acid esters, and<br>
to  the   compositions,  to   a  method  of producing  products  containing  those<br>
compositions, and to those products.<br>
Polycarbonate sheets are known from EP-A 0 110 221 and are made available for a large number of applications. They are produced, for example, by extrusion of compositions containing polycarbonate and, optionally, by co-extrusion with further compositions containing polycarbonate and having an increased content of UV absorbers.<br>
A problem that occurs repeatedly in the extrusion of such sheets is the precipitation of volatile constituents from the moulding composition.<br>
In the machines used to produce the sheets, volatile constituents are precipitated on calibrators in the extrusion of multi-wall sheets and on rollers in the extrusion of solid sheets. Both can result in faults on the surface of the sheets.<br>
Volatile constituents are, for example, UV absorbers, mould-release agents and other low molecular weight constituents of the compositions containing polycarbonate.<br>
EP-A 0 320 632 describes co-extruded sheets of compositions containing polycarbonate, which contain a low-volatile UV absorber and may additionally contain a lubricant. A disadvantage is that, with a relatively long extrusion time, the surface of the sheets is impaired especially in the case of co-extrusion. That is caused, for example, by evaporations from the polycarbonate melt<br><br>
I<br><br>
The increased release of the UV absorber from the polycarbonate melt leads to the formation of a coating on the calibrator or the rollers and, ultimately, to the formation of faults in the surface of the sheets (e.g. white spots, ripples, etc.). At the calibrator, polycarbonate abrasion additionally leads to powdery deposits on the co-extruded polycarbonate sheets.<br>
From WO 99/05205 it is known that mould-release agent mixtures, for example consisting of fatty acid esters of pentaerythritol and of glycerol, can be used to minimise the formation on the calibrator or the rollers of a coating which leads to the formation of faults (e.g. white spots, ripples, etc.) in the surface of the sheet.<br>
The use of various UV absorbers based on substituted triazines for polycarbonate is known; for example from JP-A 09-176476, JP-A 09-057881, JP-A 09-057813 and EP-A 0 825 226.<br>
JP-A 09-176 476 describes polycarbonate compositions containing triazines and sheets and films coated therewith.<br>
JP-A 09-057 881 describes plastics corrugated sheets coated with polycarbonate compositions containing triazines.<br>
JP-A 09-057 813 describes a specific process for the production of polycarbonate sheets that contain triazines in the cover layer.<br>
EP-A 0 649 724 describes a process for the production of multi-layer plastics panels from branched polycarbonates having molecular weights Mw of from 27,000 to 29,500 g/mol by co-extrusion of a core layer and at least one cover layer containing from 1 to 15 wt.% of a UV absorber. If in the moulding compositions for producing those plastics panels there are used the mould-release agents, described in EP-A 0 300 485, glycerol monostearate, pentaerythritol tetrastearate and mixtures thereof<br><br>
with glycerol monostearate as the main component, an impairment of the surfaces of the sheets nevertheless occurs with time.<br>
Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide compositions<br>
5	containing polycarbonate that do not exhibit the mentioned disadvantages of the<br>
prior art when extruded or co-extruded.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide products, especially multi¬layer sheets, containing the compositions according to the invention.<br>
The object according to the invention is achieved by the use of compounds of formula (T)<br><br><br>
0-FT<br><br>
00<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of Ci-alkyl to Cg-alkyl, halogen and -CN, and<br>
R5    is H or Ci-alkyl to C20-alkyl,<br>
in the preparation of,compositions containing polycarbonate and fatty acid esters and one or more compounds of formula (I).<br><br>
Preferably, R5 is n-octyl.<br>
Also preferably, R1, R2, R and R4 are methyl. Particularly preferably, R5 is n-octyl and R1, R2, R3 and R4 are methyl.<br>
The object according to the invention is also achieved by compositions containing polycarbonate and fatty acid esters and one or more compounds of formula (I).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compositions according to the invention contain from 0.02 to 1 wt.% fatty acid esters. Those esters are preferably selected from the group consisting of pentaerythritol tetrastearate, glycerol monostearate and mixtures of the two.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compositions according to the invention additionally contain from 10 ppm to 3000 ppm thermostabilisers.<br>
The thermostabilisers are preferably selected from the group consisting of tris-(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite and triphenylphosphine.<br>
The object according to the invention is also achieved by a method of producing products containing a composition according to the invention by extrusion or co-extrusion or injection moulding. Extrusion or co-extrusion are preferred.<br>
The object according to the invention is also achieved by a product containing a composition according to the invention.<br>
The object according to the invention is also achieved by a multi-layer product, wherein at least one of the outer layexs contains a composition according to the invention.<br><br>
The object according to the invention is also achieved by a product containing a composition according to the invention, the product being selected from the group consisting of sheet, solid sheet, multi-wall sheet, corrugated solid sheet, corrugated multi-wall sheet, multi-wall profile, glazing, glazing for greenhouses, conservatory, bus stop, advertising hoarding, sign, protective glazing, motor vehicle glazing, window and roofing.<br>
Particularly preferred products according to the invention are multi-layer sheets that contain a composition according to the invention in at least one of the two outer layers.<br>
The products according to the invention contain a composition according to the invention. Preferably, they consist substantially of a composition according to the invention. Particularly preferably, they consist of a composition according to the invention. In the case of multi-layer products, that applies to one or more layers of the product.<br>
The composition according to the invention is preferably applied in the form of a cover layer having a thickness of preferably from 5 to 80 urn to a polycarbonate sheet, application preferably being effected by means of co-extrusion.<br>
The compositions according to the invention preferably contain from 1 to 7 wt.%, particularly preferably from 2 to 5 wt.%, compounds of formula (I).<br>
The preparation of the compounds of formula (I) may be effected by known processes. It may be carried out, for example, according to WO 00/14075, US-A 556 973, US-A 5 648 488 or US-A 5 675 004. Particular examples of the compounds of formula (I) are commercially available, for example under the name Cyasorb® UV 1164 from Cytec Industries B.V., Botlek, Netherlands.<br><br>
The compositions containing polycarbonate according to the invention have proved to be especially advantageous. They can be processed without difficulty and do not impair the goods obtained as the product. Surprisingly, it has been found that, when those compounds are used, the problems described at the beginning do not arise even when additives that are known to be volatile are added to compositions containing polycarbonate.<br>
According to the invention, polycarbonates are homopolycarbonates, copolycarbonates or thermoplastic polyester carbonates. They preferably have mean<br>
molecular weights Mw of from 18,000 to 40,000 g/mol, preferably from 26,000 to 36,000 g/mol and especially from 28,000 to 35,000 g/mol, determined by measuring the relative solution viscosity in dichloromethane or in mixtures of equal amounts by weight of phenol/o-dichlorobenzene calibrated by light scattering.<br>
The melt viscosity of the composition containing polycarbonate is preferably to be less than that of the substrate to which it is applied, where multi-layer products are produced..<br>
For the preparation of polycarbonates for the compositions containing polycarbonate, reference is made, for example, to "Schnell", Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates, Polymer Reviews, Vol. 9, Interscience Publishers, New York, London, Sydney 1964, to D.C.

There are used as chain terminators preferably phenols, such as phenol, alkylphenols, such as cresol and 4-tert-butylphenol, chlorophenol, bromophenol, cumylphenol, or mixtures thereof, in amounts of preferably from 1 to 20 mol%, particularly preferably from 2 to 10 mol%, per mol of bisphenol. Phenol, 4-tert-butylphenol and cumylphenol are preferred.<br>
Chain terminators and branching agents may be added to the syntheses separately or alternatively together with the bisphenol.<br>
The preparation of the polycarbonates for the compositions containing polycarbonate according to the invention by the melt transesterification process is described by way of example in DE-A 42 38 123.<br>
The incorporation of the UV absorbers, especially the incorporation of the compounds of formula (I), into the compositions containing polycarbonate according to the invention is carried out by conventional methods, for example by mixing solutions of the UV absorbers with solutions of the polycarbonates in suitable organic solvents, such as CH2CI2, haloalkanes, haloaromatic compounds, chlorobenzene and xylenes. The mixtures of substances are then preferably homogenised in a known manner by extrusion; the solution mixtures are removed,<br><br>
for example compounded, in a known manner, for example by evaporation of the solvent and subsequent extrusion.<br>
The compositions containing polycarbonate may additionally contain stabilisers.<br>
Suitable stabilisers for the polycarbonates for the compositions containing polycarbonate according to the invention are, for example, phosphines, phosphites or Si-containing stabilisers and other compounds described in EP-A 0 500 496. There may be mentioned by way of example triphenyl phosphites, diphenylalkyl phosphites, phenyldialkyl phosphites, tris-(nonylphenyl) phosphite, tetrakis-(2,4-di-tert-burylphenyl)-4,4'-biphenylene diphosphonite and triaryl phosphite. Triphenyl-phosphine and tris-(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite are particularly preferred.<br>
The moulding composition according to the invention contains fatty acid esters. They are (partial) esters of tetra- to hexa-hydric alcohols, especially of pentaerythritol.<br>
Tetrahydric alcohols are, for example, pentaerythritol and mesoerythritol.<br>
Pentahydric alcohols are, for example, arabitol, ribitol and xylitol.<br>
Hexahydric alcohols are, for example, mannitol, glucitol (sorbitol) and dulcitoL<br>
The esters are the monoesters, diesters, triesters, tetraesters, optionally pentaesters and hexaesters or mixtures thereof, especially static mixtures, of saturated aliphatic Cio- to C26-monocarboxylic acids, preferably with saturated aliphatic Cu- to C22-monocarboxylic acids.<br>
The commercially available fatty acid esters, especially of pentaerythritol, can contain 
 <br>
Saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids having from 10 to 26 carbon atoms are, for example, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid and cerotic acid.<br>
Preferred saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids having from 14 to 22 carbon atoms are, for example, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachic acid and behenic acid.<br>
Saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids such as palmitic acid and stearic acid are particularly preferred.<br>
The saturated aliphatic Cio- to C26-carboxylic acids and the fatty acid esters to be used according to the invention are either known as such in the literature or can be prepared according to processes known in the literature. Examples of pentaerythritol fatty acid esters are those of the particularly preferred monocarboxylic acids mentioned above.<br>
Esters of pentaeiythritol with stearic acid and palmitic acid are particularly preferred.<br>
The moulding composition according to the invention may also contain glycerol mono-fatty acid esters. Glycerol mono-fatty acid esters are esters of glycerol with saturated aliphatic Cio- to C26-monocarboxylic acids, preferably with saturated aliphatic C14- to C22-monocarboxylic acids. Their higher volatility no longer leads to the problems described at the beginning in the case of the moulding composition according to the invention.<br>
Glycerol mono-fatty acid esters are to be understood as being both those of the primary OH function of glycerol and those of the secondary OH function of glycerol, as well as mixtures of those isomeric classes of compounds. The glycerol mono-fatty<br><br>
acid esters can contain 
Saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids having from 10 to 26 carbon atoms are, for example, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid and cerotic acid.<br>
Preferred saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids having from 14 to 22 carbon atoms are, for example, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachic acid and behenic acid.<br>
Particularly preferred saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids are palmitic acid and stearic acid.<br>
The saturated aliphatic Cio- to C26-carboxylic acids and the glycerol mono-fatty acid esters to be used according to the invention are either known as such in the literature or can be prepared according to processes known in the literature (see, for example, Fieser and Fieser, Organische Chemie GmbH, Weinheim, Bergstr. 1965, Chap. 30, page 1206 ff). Examples of glycerol mono-fatty acid esters are those of the particularly preferred monocarboxylic acids mentioned above.<br>
The compositions containing polycarbonate may additionally contain antistatics. Examples of antistatics are cationic compounds, for example quaternary ammonium, phosphonium or sulfonium salts, anionic compounds, for example alkylsulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkyl phosphates, carboxylates in the form of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, non-ionic compounds, for example polyethylene glycol esters, polyethylene glycol ethers, fatty acid esters, ethoxylated fatty amines. Preferred antistatics are non-ionic compounds.<br><br>
The compositions according to the invention and the products produced therefrom may also contain organic colouring agents, inorganic colouring pigments, fluorescent colouring agents and, particularly preferably, optical brightening agents.<br>
All the materials and solutions used for the synthesis of the compositions containing polycarbonate according to the invention may be contaminated with corresponding impurities as a result of their preparation and storage, the aim being to work with starting materials that are as clean as possible.<br>
The individual constituents may in a known manner be mixed either in succession or simultaneously, either at room temperature or at elevated temperature.<br>
The additives are incorporated into the compositions containing polycarbonate in a known manner, for example by mixing polymer granules with the additives at temperatures of approximately from 200 to 3309C in conventional apparatuses such ia&amp; internal kneaders, extruders and double-shaft screws, for example by melt-compounding or melt extrusion, or by mixing the solutions of the polymer with solutions of the additives and subsequently evaporating off the solvents in a known manner.<br>
The amount of additives in the compositions containing polycarbonate may be varied within wide limits and is dependent on the desired properties of the compositions containing polycarbonate. The total amount of additives in the compositions containing polycarbonate is preferably up to 20 wt.%, especially from 0.2 to 12 wt.%, based on the weight of the compositions containing polycarbonate.<br>
As is shown by the Examples according to-the invention, the use of the compositions containing polycarbonate according to the invention as the co-extruded layer offers a significant advantage over any other compositions containing polycarbonate as the base material of sheets. That advantage occurs especially when the base material of<br><br>
the sheet is also provided with the UV absorber and the mould-release agent of the compositions containing polycarbonate according to the invention.<br>
The compositions containing polycarbonate can be used in the production of solid plastics sheets and so-called multi-wall sheets (e.g. twin-wall sheets, triple-wall sheets, etc.). The sheets also include sheets that have on one side or on both sides an additional cover layer containing the composition containing polycarbonate according to the invention.<br>
The compositions containing polycarbonate according to the invention permit the facilitated production of products, especially of sheets and products produced therefrom, such as, for example, glazing for greenhouses, conservatories, bus stops, advertising hoardings, signs, protective.glazing, motor vehicle glazing, windows or roofing.<br>
Subsequent treatment of products coated with the compositions containing polycarbonate according to the invention* such as, for example, deep-drawing or surface treatments such as, for example, the provision of scratch-resistant lacquers, water-spreading layers and the like, is possible, and the present invention also provides products produced by such processes.<br>
Co-extrusion as such is known in the literature (see, for example, EP-A 0 110 221 and EP-A 0110 238). It is preferably carried out as follows:<br>
Extruders for producing the core layer and cover layer(s) are attached to a co-extrusion adapter. The adapter is so designed that the melt forming the cover layer is applied in the form of a thin layer that adheres to the melt of the core layer.<br>
The multi-layer molten extrudate.so formed is then brought into the desired.form (multi-wall or solid sheet) in the die connected downstream. The melt is then cooled<br><br>
under controlled conditions in a known manner by means of calendering (solid sheet) or vacuum calibration (multi-wall sheet) and is then cut to length. A tempering oven for the elimination of stresses may optionally be provided downstream of the calibration. Instead of the adapter provided upstream of the die, the die itself may be in such a form that combination of the melt takes place there.<br>
The mvention is explained further by means of the Examples which follow, without being limited thereto.<br><br>
Exa<br>
10 mm twin-wall double sheets A-E, as are described, for example, in EP-A 0 110 238, were obtained from the following compositions containing polycarbonate: The base material used was Makrolon® KU 1-1243 (branched bisphenol A polycarbonate from Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany, having a melt flow index (MFR) of 6.5 g/10 min at 300°C and under a load of 1.2 kg). The base material was co-extruded with the compounds shown in the Table based on Makrolon® 3100 (linear bisphenol A polycarbonate from Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany, having a melt flow index (MFR) of 6.5 g/10 min at 300°C and under a load of 1.2 kg).<br>
The thickness of the co-ex layer was in each case approximately 50 urn.<br><br>

Pentaerythritol tetrastearate, commercially available, for example, as Loxiol EP 129 from Cognis, Diisseldorf, Germany.<br>
Glycerol monostearate, commercially available, for example, as Loxiol VPG 861 from Cognis, Dusseldorf, Germany.<br>
rris-(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)   phosphite   from   Ciba   Spezialitatenchemie, Lampertheim, Germany.<br>
Tinuvin® 360 is 2,2-memylenebis-(4-(l,l,3,3-teframethylburyl)-6-(2H-benztriazol-2-yl)phenol.<br><br>
Compound II (commercially available as Tinuvin   1577):<br><br>
The machines and apparatuses used to produce the multi-layer sheets are described below:<br>
The device consisted of<br>
-	the main extruder having a screw of length 33 D and a diameter of 70 mm with degassing<br>
-	the co-ex adapter (feedblock system)<br>
-	a co-extruder for applying the cover layer having a screw of length 25 D and a diameter of 30 mm<br>
-	the special sheet die having a width of 350 mm<br>
-	the calibrator<br>
-	the roller conveyor<br>
-	the take-off device<br>
-	the device for cutting to length (saw)<br>
-	the delivery table.<br>
The polycarbonate granules of the base material were fed to the feeding funnel of the! main extruder, and the UV co-extrusion material was fed to that of the co-extruder i Melting down and feeding of the material in question took place in the respective cylinder/screw plastification system. The two material melts were brought together y<br><br>
in the co-ex adapter and, after leaving the die and cooling in the calibrator, forn composite. The other devices served to transport the extruded sheets, cut thei length and deposit them.<br>
Co-extrusion with A (reference):<br>
first relatively small deposits after 4 hours<br>
after 3 hours, slight transverse ripples which occur at irregular intervals and<br>
impair the quality of the sheets slightly.<br>
After 4V2 hours, slightly more pronounced transverse ripples.<br>
Rating: good<br>
Co-extrusion with B:<br>
no deposits over a test duration of 5 hours<br>
Transverse rippling is very low over the entire duration of the test, so that the<br>
quality of  the sheets is not impaired<br>
Rating: very good<br>
Co-extrusion with C:<br>
first slight deposits after 2 hours<br>
after 150 minutes, slight transverse ripples which occur at irregular intervals<br>
and impair the quality of the sheets slightly.<br>
After 3.5 hours, pronounced transverse ripples.<br>
Rating: poor<br>
Co-extrusion with D:<br>
first relatively small deposits after 50 minutes<br>
after 60 minutes, slight transverse ripples which occur at irregular intervals<br>
and impair the quality of the sheets slightly.<br>
After 3 hours, pronounced transverse ripples.<br>
Rating: poor<br><br>
Co-extrusion with E:<br>
no deposits over a test duration of 5 hours<br>
Transverse rippling is very low over the entire duration of the test, so that the<br>
quality of the sheets is not impaired<br>
Rating: very good<br>
Example C shows that very poor sheet qualities are achieved with compound II.<br>
The volatility of the compound of formula (I) and of compound (II) is very similar (Table 1). It was therefore to be expected that an equally poor surface quality would be achieved with the compound of formula (I), which is chemically very similar, when the same mould-release agent mixtures were used in compositions containing polycarbonate. Surprisingly, however, it has been found that good sheet qualities could be produced with that compound over a markedly longer period of time. The sheet quality even remained better for a longer time than with the composition described in WO 9-9/05205 (here for sheet A).<br>
A comparison of tests B and D shows that the co-extrusion leads to sheets of high quality only in the case of the ternary composition, owing to a surprising synergistic effect.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.       Composition containing polycarbonate and fatty acid esters and one or more compounds of formula (I)<br><br><br>
(I)<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of Ci-alkyl to Cg-alkyl, halogen and -CN, and R5 is H or Ci-alkyl to C2o-alkyl.<br>
2.	Composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the concentration of the compounds of formula (I) in the composition is from 1 to 7 wt.%.<br>
3.	Composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the composition contains from 0.02 to 1 wt.% fatty acid ester.<br>
4.	Composition as claimed in claim 3, wherein the fatty acid esters are selected from the group consisting of pentaerythritol tetrastearate, and glycerol monostearate.<br><br><br>
5.	Composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the composition additionally contains from 10 ppm to 3000 ppm thermostabilizers.<br>
6.	Composition as claimed in claim 5, wherein the thermostabilizers are selected from the group consisting of tris-(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite and tri-phenylphosphine.<br>
7.	A	process of producing products containing the composition as claimed in any of the preceding claims, comprising the steps of:<br>
-   feeding  polycarbonate   granules   of  a  base   material   into   a feeding funnel of the main extruder;<br>
-	feeding UV co-extrusion material into a feeding funnel of a co-<br>
l<br>
extruder;<br>
-	melting down both the materials;<br>
-	bringing together the two material melts in a co-ex-adapter;<br>
-	leaving the die, followed by cooling in the calibrator to form the product.<br>
