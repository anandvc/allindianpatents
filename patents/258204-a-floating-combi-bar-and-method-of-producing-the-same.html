Floating combi-bar and mixture for producing same<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a mixture for producing a combi-bar floating in water at 20 °C (and other temperatures), i.e. having a density below 0,99821 g/mL at 20 °C. Such combi-bar hereinafter are also designated as "floating combi-bar". The present invention aiso relates to a method for producing a floating combi-bar and a combi-bar itself.<br>
The combi-bar of the present invention does not require an aeration step during prepara¬tion (during the manufacturing process) to attain buoyancy. Upon hardening at room temperature, the combi-bar of the present invention is able to float when placed in water.<br>
A combi-bar, by definition, is a bar comprising a combination of soap and non-soap surfactants.<br><br>
Background &amp; Prior Art<br>
The appeal of a floating soap-containing bar (and in particular a floating combi-bar) is that the user need not search for a missing bar in the bottom of a tub filled with soapy water. The prior art comprises floating soap bars in which air is Incorporated and is responsible for the bars to float on water. A classic example is the Ivory soap of Procter &amp; Gamble where air is mechanically whipped into the soap mass to achieve buoyancy of the final soap bar.<br>
U.S. 2,295,594 discloses a process for obtaining a floating soap comprising mechanical air entrapment through whipping and extrusion of soap in a condition of pasty cohesive-ness such that air in finely divided bubble form can be incorporated. The bars are al¬lowed to cool and harden after extrusion. The soap bar compositions do not contain any non-soap detergent active.<br>
U.S. 5,972,860 discloses an aerated detergent bar essentially incorporating inorganic salts and/or polyols and non-ionic surfactants wherein the air is in the fine bubble form and entrapped in the formulation before casting.<br>
U.S. 5,194,172 discloses an aerated freezer bar comprising fatty acid soap, sucrose, and hydrophobic material selected from waxes, and water.<br>
U.S. 5,219,487 discloses an aerated freezer soap bar comprising fatty acid soap, free fatty acid, salt, and water.<br>
U.S. 6,770,606 discloses a method whereby the air is incorporated into the bar after the soap mass is cast. Air is entrained in the bar after it has been dehydrated in the oven.<br>
U.S. 5,602,088 discloses 3 method of extruding a soap biliet with a hollow recess that is pneumatically sealed off when stamped into shape. Air trapped within the hollow recess will allow the soap to float on water.<br>
The prior arts manufacturing process comprise an air-incorporating step and correspond¬ing equipment. It was an object of the present invention to provide a floating soap-<br><br>
containing bar which can be produced without an aeration step. Additionally, corre¬sponding mixtures and production methods (methods of manufacture) should be pro¬vided.<br>
Regarding the aspect "mixture", the present invention concerns a mixture for producing a combi-bar floating in water at 20°C and other temperatures (floating combi-bar), the mixture comprising or (essentially) consisting of.<br>
i)	20 - 50 wt.%, preferably 25 - 40 wt.%, of one or more non-soap surfac-<br>
tants, preferably solid non-soap surfactants,<br>
ii)	25 - 60 wt.%, preferably 35 - 55 wt.%, of one or more free C14-C18 fatty<br>
acids,<br>
iii)	2 - 40 wt.%, preferably 5 - 25 wt.%, of one or more metal C8-C24 fatty acid<br>
soaps, and<br>
iv)	0 - 20 wt.%, preferably 2 - 20 wt.%, of further ingredients,<br>
said mixture containing less than 10 wt.% of water, preferably less than 6 wt.% of water, as a further ingredient.<br>
Particularly preferred is a mixture according to the present invention which comprises or (essentially) consists of:<br>
i)      25 - 40 wt.% of one or more non-soap surfactants, preferably solid non-soap sur¬factants,<br>
ii)      35 - 55 wt.% of one or more free C14-C18 fatty acids,<br>
iii)     5 - 25 wt.% of one or more metal C8-C24 fatty acid soaps, and<br>
iv)     2 -15 wt. % of further ingredients,<br>
said mixture containing less than 6 wt.% of water.<br><br>
It has surprisingly been found that casting a mixture according to the present invention, i.e. a mixture comprising specific amounts of non-soap ingredients, free fatty acids and soap results in a composition which can be given the shape of a combi-bar which in turn is solid at room temperature (20°C), has the ability to float on water (at 20°C and other temperatures), wherein the method of production does not need any aeration or air entrapment steps. Using the mixture of the present invention in the production of floating combt-bars results in a shortened manufacturing process and a reduction of capital investment, as air entrapment and/or aeration equipment is not necessary.<br>
The mixture of the present invention differs from prior art mixtures for producing floating soap bars as such prior art mixtures are predominately based on soap and only to a minor extent comprise non-soap surfactants and/or fatty acids. According to the present invention a considerable amount of non-soap surfactants (20 - 50 wt.%) and of free C14-C18 fatty acids (25 - 60 wt.%) is used. In contrast thereto, U.S. 5,219,487 discloses the use of 70 - 80% soap with a maximum fatty acid content of 5% while U.S. 5,972,860 discloses a composition with 20% - 50% soap and a lower amount of non-soap surfac¬tant at 1 -15%.<br>
Throughout these specification, unless indicated otherwise, all percentages and ratios given are by weight and all conditions and properties (e.g. state of aggregation) refer to 20 °C.<br>
Preferably, in mixtures of the present invention the total amount of components i), ii), and iii) Is at least 80 wt.%, and is preferably in the range of 85 to 98 wt.%.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention concerns a method for producing a combi-bar floating in water at 20 °C, comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	providing a mixture according to the present invention (as disclosed above and, preferably, as described in more detail below),<br>
b)	heating said mixture to a temperature in the range of 70 - 90°C to obtain a pour-able melt,<br><br>
c)	casting or pouring said melt into a mould,<br>
d)	cooling said melt in said mould so that the melt solidifies, and<br>
e)	removing the resulting combi-bar from said mould,<br>
wherein in the process no or only so little air or other gas is incorporated into the mixture or melt that the resulting combi-bar contains less than 2 vol% of air or other gas.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention concerns a combi-bar floating in water at 20 "C (floating combi-bar) and preferably other temperatures, comprising a mixture according to the present invention, the combi-bar containing less than 2 vol% of air or other gas. Such combi-bar is obtainable by a method according to the present invention, i.e. a method using a mixture according to the present invention.<br>
In a preferred method of the present invention, for manufacturing floating combi-bars the non-soaps surfactants (component i)) are dissolved in the molten free fatty acids (com¬ponent ii)) and thereto the fatty acid soap (component iii)) as well as the further ingredi¬ents (component iv)), if present are added. The resulting molten mass comprising com¬ponents i), ii), iii), and optionally component iv) is subsequently poured or cast into a mould (step c) and cooled in said mould to room temperature (20 °C). To aid the cooling process the moulds may be placed in a tray of cold water. When the melt has solidified (hardened), the resulting combi-bar is removed from the mould. No or only so little air or other gas is incorporated into the mixture or melt that the resulting combi-bar contains less than 2 voi% of air or other gas.<br>
The mixtures of the present invention and the corresponding combi-bars of the present invention contain less than 10 wt. % of water, preferably less than 6 wt. % of water, for the following reasons:<br>
When incorporating an amount of more than 10 wt.% of water, the mixture before casting attains a very high viscosity that is impractical for casting into moulds. However, the hardened mass still floats when placed in water.<br><br>
When incorporating an amount in a range of from 6 wt.% to 10 wt.% of water into the formulation the mixture before casting attains a high viscosity. Although the mixture can be cast into moulds, the resulting combi-bars sometimes have a rough surface which lacks smoothness. The resulting combi-bars float when placed in water.<br>
Best results are obtained when less than 6 wt.% of water are incorporated into the mixtures and combi-bars of the present invention.<br>
The mixtures and combi-bars of the present invention preferably contain not more than 5 wt.% of diofs or polyofs, e.g. glycerol (glycerine). In a preferred embodiment the total content of diols and polyols is not more than 3 wt.%.<br>
The mixtures and combi-bars of the present invention are preferably free of reducing sugars, in particular free of sucrose.<br>
The combi-bars of the present invention may be of any size or shape. Their shape for example may be round, oval, rectangular, quadratic, spherical, ellipsoidal, cuboid, helical or irregularly shaped, e.g. in the form of figures like crocodiles, cats, horses, ducks, roses, sunflowers, shells, fish, whales, dolphins, ships, stars, starfish.<br>
Hereinafter, the terms "coconut", "cocamido" or "cocoyl" or the like which are used in connection with soap or non-soap surfactants refer to materials having an approximate carbon chain length distribution of: 4-9% C8 ; 4-9% Cio, 45-55% C12, 15-21% C14, 8-13% C16, 7-14% C18, and about 5-7% oleic and 1-3% linoleic (the first six fatty acids being saturated, oleic and linoleic acid being unsaturated).<br>
Hereinafter, the term "tallow" refers to a mixture of soaps having an approximate chain length distribution of: 2-4% C14 ; 23-32% C16 ; 14-25% C18: 2-4% paimitoleic; 36-48% oleic and 2-8% linoleic (the first three fatty acids being saturated, paimitoleic, oleic and linoleic acid being unsaturated).<br><br>
Preferred Components i), ii), iii), and iv) are now described in more detail: Non-soap surfactants (component i)):<br>
The non-soap surfactants of component i) according to the present invention are subs¬tances that are preferably solid at 20 °C. Non-soap surfactants such as C8-C22 -alkyl sulphates (e.g. sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate), C8-C22-alkyl sulphoaceta-tes, sulphosuccinates (in particular di-C8-C22-alkyl-suiphosuccinates, e.g. sodium dioctyl sulphosuccinates), monoglyceride sulphates, acyl isethionates, betaines, glyceryl ether sulphonates, C8-C22-alkylsu1phonates, ether sulphonates, acylsulphonates, alkylacyl sulphonates and C8 - C16 - alkyl glucosides are preferred.<br>
Preferably mild non-soap surfactants, anionic or amphoteric, are used. Preferred surfac¬tants are sodium cocoyl isethionate, cocoamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauryl sulfo-succinate. These surfactants can commercially be obtained from (product names or trademarks): Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate [Clariant (Hostapon SCI-65), Akzo Nobel (Eifan AT 84)3, Cocamidopropy! Betaine [Goldschmidt (Tego Betaine CKD)], Sodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate [Goldschmidt (Rewopo! SB F 12 P)]. C8 - C16 - alkyl glucosides, e.g. Decyl Glucoside or Lauryl Glucoside are available as Plantaren® 1200 UP or Plantaren® 2000 UP from Henkel.<br>
Free C14-C18 fatty acids (component ii))<br>
The fatty acids of component ii) according to the present invention are, preferably satu¬rated, C14-C18 fatty acids, and can aid in lowering the pH and add hardness to the floating combi-bar. Preferred C14-C1B fatty acids are saturated, i.e. "hardened", and can be ob¬tained by hydrogenation of unsaturated C14-C18 fatty acids. Most preferred fatty acids are selected from myristic, palmitic and stearic acids.<br>
The free C14-C18 fatty acids improve the quantity and quality of the lathering characteris¬tics of bars prepared in accordance with the present invention, the advantage of free C14-C18 fatty acids being in tending to provide a lather of desirable stability and having small<br><br>
air bubbles so as to provide a rich or creamy lather. Free C14-C1B fatty acids also provide an emoliient effect, which tends to soften the skin or otherwise improve feel-on-skin characteristics and scavenge any excess alkalinity.<br>
Preferred fatty acids can commercially be obtained from (product names or trademarks): Myristic Acid [Uniqema (Prifrac 2942), Akzo Nobel (Kortacid 1499), Cognis (Edenor C14 98-100)], Mixtures of Pafmitic/Stearic Acid [Uniqema (Pristerene 4900), Akzo Nobel {Kortacid PH 10), Cognis (Edenor ST 1 MY, Edenor L2SM, Edenor FHTi)], Palmitic Acid [Akzo Nobel (Kortacid 1698), Cognis (Edenor C16 98-100)], Stearic Acid [Akzo Nobel (Kortacid 1898), Cognis (Edenor C18 98-100)].<br>
Metal C8-C24 fatty acid soaps (component iii))<br>
Component iii) according to the present invention comprises one or more metal soaps of C8-C24fatty acids. Preferred are alkali metal, in particular sodium, potassium, or lithium, magnesium, aluminum, calcium salts of fatty acids as component iii) of the floating combi-bar of the present invention. Particularly preferred are alkali metal, preferably sodium or potassium soaps, most preferably sodium soaps, of fatty acids to increase the hardness of the bar.<br>
The soaps (component iii)) of the present invention preferably contain from 8 to 18 car¬bon atoms. Commercial soaps preferred herein are generally based upon mixtures of fatty acids obtained from various natural sources. Coconut oil, for example, is a material, which has found considerable use in high-quality soap compositions. Similarly, tallow is a useful source of high-quality soaps. Other suitable sources include palm kernel oil and babassu kernel oil, olive oil and synthetic fatty acids simulating, for example, tallow. Particularly useful herein are the sodium or potassium salts of the mixtures of fatty acids derived from coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil and tallow., e.g. sodium or potassium tallow and coconut soap. These soaps and soap mixtures are preferred from the stand¬point of ready availability and ease of processing, and in view of their desirably optimum physical and performance characteristics.<br>
Suitable commercially available fatty acids soaps (component iii)) are available from Uniqema and include Prisavon 9220 (Soap from Palm/Palm Kernel fatty acids), Prisavon<br><br>
9240 (Soap from Palm/Coconut fatty acids), and Prisavon 9250 (Soap from Tal¬low/Coconut fatty acids).<br>

Method for producing combi-bar:<br>
The steps of a method for producing a combi-bar floating in water at 20°C, and, pref¬erably, other temperatures, according to the present invention, have been stated above.<br>
Preferably, the fatty acids {component ii)) are melted at a temperature in the range of 70 - 90°C, preferably in the range of 70 - 80°C. The non-soap surfactants {component i)) are then dissolved in the molten fatty acids. The metal fatty acids soap (component Hi)), preferably in the form of flakes or fine noodles, is added thereto and dissolved in the mixture of components i) and ii). The temperature may be increased to about 80 - 90°C, to keep the mixture in a molten state.<br>
It has to be noted that the dissolving of component iii) (metal CB bis C24 fatty acid soap) in the mixture becomes difficult and requires a higher processing temperature when the content of component iii) increases beyond 40% in the mixture.<br>
Cautions stirring facilitates the mixing/dissolving processes. Prolonged vigorous mixing should be avoided.<br>
Further ingredients (as stated above) may be incorporated into the mixture of com¬pounds i), ii) and iii) prior to casting the mixture into moulds.<br>
The cast moulds may be allowed to cool at room temperature, or cooling is accelerated by placing the moulds in a tray of cold water. The cast floating combi-bars can usually be removed from the moulds within 2 hours of casting.<br>
It should be noted that the mixture of the present invention should be treated gently (in particular when the mixture is used for producing floating combi-bars). For instance, processes like shearing in a sigma mixer or processing through a crutcher or soap plod¬der should be avoided. Likewise, prolonged heating of the mixture to temperatures ex¬ceeding 90 °C should be avoided. A gentle treatment of the mixture is recommended in order to preserve the floatage of the mixture or the corresponding combi-bar. It was surprisingly found that a non-gentle treatment of a mixture according to the present invention in some cases leads to a mixture with an increased density and worsened<br><br>
floatage. The reason for these effects might be a disruption of the phase of free fatty acids (component if)) and a more excessive emulsification of said free fatty acids by the surfactants (soap and non-soap, components i) and iii)). A suitable visual indicator for floatage, i.e. density, and probably the degree of emulsification of the fatty acids (com¬ponent ii)) is the opacity/translucency of the heated mixture prior to the casting process. The more opaque (i.e. the less translucent) the heated mixture is, the higher is normally the floatage (i.e. the lower is the density).<br>
It is preferred that the fatty acid phase is a continuous phrase encasing the soap and non-soap ingredients.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the present invention.<br>
Examples 1-5:<br>
According to the procedure described above under the heading "method for producing combi-bar" five samples where prepared, according to Examples 1-5. Formulation details are stated in the following table:<br><br><br><br>
Combi-bars according to Examples 1 - 5 produced with the above amounts of compo¬nents i), ii) and iii) were able to float in water at 20 °C, although the content of air or other gas in the respective combi-bars was less than 2 vol.%.<br>
Example 6:<br>
Using the ingredients stated in the following table a mixture was prepared for producing a combi-bar.<br>
As component i) a combination of anionic and amphoteric surfactants is used.<br>
For producing a combi-bar according to the present invention the molten fatty acid (Ede-nor ST 1 MY, component ii)) is used to dissolve the soap and non-soap surfactants at a working temperature of 80 -90°C. Perfume and titanium dioxide were added as further ingredients to the mixture of components i), ii) and iii) prior to casting in moulds.<br>
The cast moulds are placed on a tray of water to accelerate the cooling process, and the bars are hardened and removed from the moulds after 1 hour. The resulting combi-bars floated when placed in water.<br><br><br><br>
Example 7<br>
A process of manufacture was carried out as described in Example 6, using the ingredi¬ents stated in the following table. The resulting combi-bars floated when placed in water.<br><br><br><br>
Example 8:<br>
A process was carried out as described in Example 6, using the ingredients stated in the following table.<br><br><br><br>
The resulting combi-bars were opaque and floated when placed in water. The floating combi-bars had the following composition:<br>
i)	38.08 wt.% of non-soap surfactants, component i)<br>
ii)	43.9 wt.% of free C14-C18 fatty acids, component ii)<br>
iii)	2.84 wt.% of metal C8-C24 fatty acid soaps, component iii)<br>
iv)	15.18 wt.% further ingredients, component vi)<br>
the water content was about 5.88 wt.% and the glycerine content 4.5 wt.%. Polyethylene glycol (molecular weight 6000) as part of the translucent soap base was used to improve the hardness of the floating combi-bar.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 9:<br>
10 wt.% of soft water were incorporated into the formulation, and the mixture attained a very high viscosity that is impractical to cast in moulds. However, the hardened mass still floated when placed in water.<br>
Example 10:<br>
5 wt.% of soft water were incorporated into the formulation, and the mixture attained a high viscosity. Although the mixture can be cast into moulds, the combi-bars have a rough surface. The resulting soap combi-bars of the present invention floated when placed in water.<br>
However, water can be added to the bar by using raw materials containing water.<br>
Example 11: Relation of buoyancy to method of manufacture<br>
Experiment 1<br>
Samples were cast at different temperatures to determine if heat-treatment and possibly heat-added emulsification of fatty acids by surfactants {soap and non-soap) played a role in the buoyancy of the samples.<br>
The formulation used for samples A, B, C and D was as stated in Example 6.<br>
Sample A was processed in accordance to the invention and cast at a temperature not exceeding 90°C. It is noted that the appearance of the mixture prior to the casting proc¬ess was opaque.<br>
Sample B was subjected to additional heat and cast at a temperature not exceeding 100°C. A thin, translucent layer could be seen in the mixture prior to the casting process.<br>
Sample C was subjected to additional heating and cast at a temperature just exceeding 100°C.<br><br>
It is noted that the translucent layer had increased prior to the casting process, in com¬parison with sample B,<br>
Sample D was subjected to additional heating until sample D was a dear solution, at a temperature above 100 °C (approximately 105 °C.)<br>
The cast samples A, B, C and D where placed into a container of water and the following phenomenon was noted:<br>
Sample A floats on the water.<br>
-	Sample B is suspended in the water.<br>
