CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/834,984, filed August 2, 2006.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a valve having an integrated sensor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Valves having position sensors often have a set of predetermined valve<br>
positions that correlate to predetermined engine operating conditions. These<br>
predetermined conditions do not compensate for changes in operating<br>
conditions that are not part of the control unit's program. For example, as the<br>
components of the valve wear, contamination begins to build up inside the<br>
valve causing the flow of gas through the valve to be affected. The control unit<br>
has no way of adjusting operations in response. Therefore, there exists a<br>
need to compensate for changes in gas flow and adjust the position of the<br>
valve.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a valve having a valve body with an inlet port<br>
and an outlet port and a valve disposed between the inlet port and outlet port.<br>
A sensor is operably associated with the valve and the valve body and<br>
measures a characteristic in proximity to the valve. The sensor<br>
communicates information regarding the characteristic to a control unit that<br>
sends position commands to the valve.<br>
Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

incorporating an exhaust gas return valve, according to the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional side view of a system with an EGR valve having<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses.<br>
An exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system is shown in Figure 1<br>
generally at 10. The system 10 includes an engine 12 which has an intake<br>
manifold 14 and an exhaust manifold 16. The exhaust manifold 16 feeds<br>
exhaust gas from the engine 12 into a turbocharger unit 18. The turbocharger<br>
unit 18 has a turbine 20, and a compressor 22. The compressor 22 includes<br>
an inlet pipe 24 for receiving air from the atmosphere and feeding it into an<br>
intercooler 26. The intercooler 26 is connected to a throttle valve 28, the<br>
throttle valve 28 is used for controlling the flow of air into the intake manifold<br>
14.<br>
The system 10 also includes an EGR valve 30 for controlling the flow of<br>
exhaust gas from the exhaust manifold 16 to the intake manifold 14. There is<br>
a first conduit 32 which is connected between the exhaust manifold 14 and<br>
the EGR valve 30, and a second conduit 34 connected between the EGR<br>
valve 30 and the intake manifold 14. Both the throttle valve 28 and the EGR<br>
valve 30 are controlled by an electronic control unit (ECU) 36.<br>
Referring now to all of the figures, a cross sectional view of the EGR<br>
valve 30 is shown. The EGR valve 30 is actuated by an actuator 38. The<br>
actuator 38 in this embodiment is a solenoid. The EGR valve 30 has a valve<br>
body 40 with an inlet port 42 and an outlet port 44. Located between the inlet<br>
port 42 and the outlet port 44 is a valve 50 having a valve stem 52, and a<br>
valve member 54. The valve member 54 rests against the valve seat 56<br>
when the valve 50 is in the closed position. The inlet port 42 is in fluid<br>
connection with the first conduit 32, and the outlet port 44 is in fluid<br>
connection with the second conduit 34.<br>
Also included in the valve body 40 is a first passage 46 and a second<br>
passage 48; the valve seat 56 has a first side 58 and a second side 60. The<br>
first passage 46 is connected to the second side 60 of the valve seat 56 and<br>
the second passage 48 is connected to the first side 58 of the valve seat 56.<br>
The first passage 46 and second passage 48 are operably connected to the<br>
flow path through the valve body. A sensor 62, which in this embodiment is a<br>
pressure sensor, is integrated into the valve body 40, and is located in the first<br>
passage 46 and the second passage 48. The placement of the sensor 62 in<br>
the first passage 46 and second passage 48 allow the sensor 62 to take<br>
pressure readings on both sides of the valve 50. Furthermore, the sensor 62<br>
can take readings with minimal intrusion into the flow path of the valve 50.<br>
The valve stem 52 is connected to the solenoid 38 which acts on the<br>
valve stem 52 to move the valve member 54 between the open and closed<br>
position, or any other desired position therebetween, with respect to the valve<br>
seat 56. The amount of space created by the valve member 54 and the valve<br>
seat 56 when the valve member 54 is displaced from the valve seat 56 is<br>
referred to as an effective orifice 64. The effective orifice 64 is the amount of<br>
area available for the exhaust gas to flow through when it is flowing between<br>
the valve member 54 and the valve seat 56. This effective orifice 64 creates a<br>
restriction of exhaust gas flow and a pressure drop across the valve member<br>
54 and the valve seat 56. The size of the effective orifice 64 will vary,<br>
depending upon the position of the valve member 54 in relation to the valve<br>
seat 56. The size of the effective orifice 64 can range from zero, when the<br>
valve 50 is closed, to a size equal to or greater than the size of the valve seat<br>
56, when the valve is fully open.<br>
The actuator 38 also includes a position sensor 66 which provides a<br>
signal to the ECU 36 indicating the position of the valve member 54. This<br>
allows the ECU 36 to compare the position of the valve 50 and the pressure<br>
across the valve 50 simultaneously. It is not required that a position sensor<br>
66 be used in order to determine the appropriate position of the valve 50.<br>
Rather the data collected by the sensor 62 can be enough for the ECU 36 to<br>
make a determination of how the valve 50 needs to be adjusted.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 2 also shows a wiring harness 68<br>
which is used to connect the sensor 62 to the ECU 36. However, the<br>
embodiment in Figure 2 includes the concept of having the sensor 62 having<br>
an alternate connection 70, which would allow the connections of sensor 62 to<br>
be included in the connector 72. Having the single connector 72 for both the<br>
solenoid 38 and the sensor 62 simplifies the invention even further.<br>
The actuator 38 shown in the present embodiment of the invention is a<br>
solenoid. It is within the scope of this invention for virtually any other type of<br>
actuator to be used that will cause the desired controlled movement of the<br>
valve 50 in response to the signal from the sensor 62, and if applicable, the<br>
position sensor 66. Examples of other types of actuators 38 include, but are<br>
not limited to, D.C. motors, stepper motors, pneumatic actuators, hydraulic<br>
actuators or combinations thereof. The type of control signal generated by<br>
the ECU 36 to the actuator will depend on the type of actuator being used.<br>
For example, the control signal can be a stepped electrical pulse, an<br>
amplitude modulated signal, a pulse width modulated signal, or other<br>
electronic signals.<br>
When the system 10 and valve 50 shown in Figs. 1-2 are operated,<br>
fresh air is fed into the intake pipe 24 and is compressed by the compressor<br>
22, and fed into the intercooler 26. The air is then cooled by the intercooler<br>
26, and flows through the throttle valve 28, through the intake manifold 14,<br>
and into the engine 12. The amount of air which flows into the intake manifold<br>
14 is controlled by the throttle valve 28.<br>
The compressor 22 is powered by the turbine 20. Once the fresh air is<br>
received by the engine 12 is combined with fuel, compressed, combusted and<br>
converted to exhaust gas. The turbine 20 receives the exhaust gas from the<br>
exhaust manifold 16, and the energy from the exhaust gas is used to power<br>
the turbine 20. That power is transferred to the compressor 22, where the<br>
compressor compresses fresh air.<br>
A portion of the exhaust gas does not flow to the turbine 20. Some of<br>
the exhaust gas is recirculated back into the intake manifold and is fed into<br>
the engine 12. This portion of exhaust gas will flow from the exhaust manifold<br>
16 into the first conduit 32 and into the EGR valve 30. Once the gas flows<br>
through the EGR valve 30, it will flow into the second conduit 34, and into the<br>
intake manifold 14.<br>
The EGR valve 30 controls the amount of exhaust gas that is<br>
recirculated from the exhaust manifold 16 to the intake manifold 14. The EGR<br>
valve 30 and the throttle valve 28 are both controlled by the vehicle's ECU 36.<br>
The ECU 36 controls the amount of fresh air going into the intake manifold 14<br>
through the use of the throttle valve 28, and also controls the amount of<br>
exhaust gas which is recirculated through the use of the EGR valve 30. The<br>
sensor 62 measures a characteristic in proximity to the valve 50 relative to the<br>
valve position and flow. The sensor 62 as shown in Fig. 2 is a pressure<br>
sensor that measures pressure at the first side 58 and second side 60 of the<br>
valve 50. The sensor 62 then transmits a data signal to the ECU 36. Using<br>
the information from the signal the ECU 36 determines whether the valve 50<br>
needs to change position or be maintained. The desired position of the valve<br>
50 is achieved by the ECU 36 adjusting the control signal to the actuator 38.<br>
It should be noted that the characteristic measured is not necessarily<br>
limited to pressure; the characteristic could also be mass flow rate, volumetric<br>
flow rate, temperature, air particulate content, contamination, density, or any<br>
other type of characteristic which can be used to provide an indication of gas<br>
flow. The sensor 62 could be any type of sensor used to measure the specific<br>
characteristics listed above on the first side 58 and the second side 60 of the<br>
valve seat 56.<br>
The pressure drop can be used to calculate the amount of exhaust gas<br>
flowing through the effective orifice 64. The sensor 62 will then provide a<br>
signal to the ECU 36; the ECU 36 will then determine if the valve 50 position<br>
and control signal must change to achieve the desired exhaust gas flow<br>
through EGR valve 30. In this embodiment, ECU 36 is programmed with a<br>
map of engine 12 operating conditions, or a set of predetermined operating<br>
conditions for the valve 50, and a desired exhaust gas flow for each condition.<br>
There is an associated EGR valve 30 control signal and sensor 62 signal for<br>
each level of exhaust gas flow. The ECU 36 will receive the pressure inputs<br>
from the sensor 62 and the position sensor 66, and determine the control<br>
signal required to achieve the desired position of valve 50 and EGR valve 30<br>
and provide the required amount of exhaust gas flow. The ECU 36 will adjust<br>
the position of the valve 50 to achieve or maintain the proper amount of<br>
exhaust gas flow through the EGR valve 30.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 3<br>
which includes a separate sensor 74 used to determine the pressure in the<br>
intake manifold 14 and second side 60 of valve seat 56. The sensor 62 will<br>
then determine the level of pressure on the first side 58 of the valve seat 56.<br>
The pressure measurement taken by the sensor 62 and the separate sensor<br>
74 can also provide an indication of pressure differential, and therefore<br>
determine the amount of exhaust gas flow.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is shown in phantom in<br>
Figure 1. In this embodiment, the first conduit 32 is connected to the turbine<br>
20, instead of the exhaust manifold 16, and the second conduit 34 is<br>
connected to the inlet pipe 24 of the compressor 22. In this mode of<br>
operation, the EGR valve 30 is a "low-pressure" valve, because it is located<br>
downstream from the turbine 20, and upstream from the compressor 22. After<br>
the exhaust gas flows through the turbine 20, the exhaust gas will flow<br>
through the first conduit 32, and if the EGR valve 30 is open, the exhaust gas<br>
will flow through the EGR valve 30, through the second conduit 34, and into<br>
the inlet pipe 24. If the EGR valve 30 is closed, the exhaust gas in the first<br>
conduit 32 will flow out of an outlet pipe 76.<br>
The present invention has the advantage of measuring exhaust gas<br>
flow and adjusting the size of the effective orifice 64 accordingly to ensure the<br>
exhaust gas flow is correct for each of the engine operating conditions. This<br>
presents a significant advantage over EGR systems which use a set of<br>
predetermined valve positions for each engine operating parameter which do<br>
not take into account contamination, wear, assembly tolerances, and other<br>
external factors which can affect the flow of exhaust gas through the valve 50.<br>
These types of EGR valves infer flow from the position of the valve. The<br>
present invention has the distinct advantage of taking an actual measurement<br>
of gas pressure, and adjusting the flow of the gas to compensate for<br>
contamination, wear, assembly tolerances, and other factors affecting the flow<br>
of the gas. Essentially, the ECU 36 is using feedback from the sensor 62 and<br>
position sensor 66 to ensure there is optimal exhaust gas flow for each engine<br>
operating condition.<br>
It should be noted that the position sensor 66 can be eliminated if<br>
necessary to suit a specific application. The sensor 62 can be used to<br>
provide feedback to the ECU 36, and the ECU 36 will adjust the position of<br>
the valve 50 until the proper amount of exhaust gas flow is achieved. The<br>
actuator could also be a hydraulic actuator (not shown) where hydraulic<br>
pressure would be used to actuate the valve 50.<br>
In addition to the sensor 62 being physically integrated into the EGR<br>
valve 30, the sensor 62 can also be electrically integrated in that there can be<br>
a single electrical connector which can be used for both the EGR valve 30<br>
and the sensor 62.<br>
The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and,<br>
thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended<br>
to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded<br>
as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
