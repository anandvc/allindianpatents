				<td>RIGID CARRIER FOR A TWO-WHEELED VEHICLE<br>
The present invention refers to a rigid carrier for a two-wheeled vehicle.<br>
At present, there exist a large number of types of shapes and arrangements of rigid carriers for two-wheeled vehicles.<br>
These carriers, which, as has been said, have a wide variety of shapes and sizes, are made of different materials, and may or may not have lids, may be set, generally and more frequently, at the rear of the vehicle, and more rarely at the front. They are mechanically fixed on appropriate supports present on and integrated into the vehicle itself .<br>
Furthermore, some existing two-wheeled vehicles, in particular of the motor-vehicle type, are equipped with supporting elements or framework elements which have handles or are directly connected to, or made of a single piece with (for example, welded to), the frame itself of the vehicle, or likewise fastened on parts which are in turn connected to the vehicle.<br>
These specific supporting elements have, in particular, the purpose of serving as a rest for a possible passenger of the vehicle. In this case, in general, obviously, such resting elements are located at the rear of the vehicle.<br>
The said handles or supporting elements, which perform the same function and which are generally two in number and are located one on the right and the other on the left of the vehicle, prove particularly useful for the passenger for a number of reasons.<br>
Such supporting elements, in fact, provide both safety for the passenger, for example when the vehicle is inclined on a bend or in the case of sudden braking and acceleration, etc., and comfort during movement of the vehicle in that they provide a convenient and comfortable resting surface. The said supporting elements, in fact, may be gripped firmly by the passenger and prevent the need for the passenger to "hug" the person driving the vehicle during its motion, which renders the task of driving more difficult and dangerous for driver and passenger alike.<br>
The aforesaid handles may also prove particularly useful during manoeuvres involving displacement of the vehicle from the stationary condition, in positioning of the vehicle on its stand, and when taking the vehicle off its stand, for attaching objects, etc.<br>
It is evident that such supporting elements or handles require a specific means of fastening once the vehicle has been equipped with its other possible accessories, such as a luggage grid, a carrier or some other element.<br>
The main purpose of the present invention is to solve the drawback referred to above, i.e., to eliminate any additional operation, in the case, where, for example, also a carrier has to be fixed on the two-wheeled vehicle.<br>
Another purpose of the present invention is to find a solution to the problem referred to above that is simple and immediate, thus preventing any possible waste of time and additional costs both as regards construction and as regards assembly.<br>
These and other purposes according to the present invention are achieved by providing a rigid carrier for a two-wheeled vehicle, as set down in Claim 1.<br>
The other claims define the additional characteristics of the present invention.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of a rigid carrier for a two-wheeled vehicle according to the present invention will emerge more clearly from the ensuing description, which is given merely to provide a non-limiting example, with reference to the attached schematic drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of a carrier according to the present invention, where a portion of the frame and of the saddle of the vehicle is also schematically represented;<br>
Figure  2  is  a  top  plan  view  of  the  carrier<br>
according to the invention with its lid part removed and in which a bottom area is illustrated by the dashed lines; and<br>
Figure 3 is a section of an enlarged item taken according to the trace Ill-Ill of Figure 2.<br>
With reference to the figures, illustrated therein is a rigid carrier for a two-wheeled vehicle, indicated as a whole by 11, which is made according to the present invention and may be applied to a framework or frame of a vehicle, the said framework or frame being only partially illustrated and being designated by the reference number 12, in the vicinity of a saddle 10.<br>
The carrier 11 is basically made up of four parts, namely, a top lid 13, a base portion for containing objects 14, and two handles 15.<br>
The lid 13 is hinged in 16 to the base portion for containing objects 14 on one side so that the lid can be lifted to open the carrier. In addition, the lid is generally equipped with a lock operated by a key, partially illustrated and designated by 17.<br>
The base portion for containing objects 14 is equipped on the outside with moulded reinforcing and supporting ribs 18 and with a base plate 22, made of a single piece with the portion 14 itself and inside the latter, for rigid connection to the frame of the vehicle 12 by means of screws or other fastening means<br>
 (not shown).<br>
 Both the base portion for containing objects 14 and the top lid 13 are made out of rigid plastic material, for example by moulding.<br>
The two handles 15, one on the left and one on the right, are connected at one end to the carrier 11 and at the other to the frame 12 of the vehicle itself, so ensuring a greater safety.<br>
In the two handles 15, which may, for example, be made of polyurethane foam, suitable steel cores 19 are inserted in one end to provide a secure mechanical connection to the base portion for containing objects 14 of the carrier 11 and to provide a strengthening of the handles themselves.<br>
The steel cores 19 are set in position so that they are firmly fixed by means of screws 23 to the carrier 11 with the interposition of reinforcement plates 20 set inside the base portion for containing objects 14 of the carrier 11 itself.<br>
At the other free ends of the handles 15, slots or holes 21 are provided for attachment to the frame 12. The said slots may be made of a single piece with the handles 15 in the case where the latter are made of a rigid material. Alternatively, the slots or holes 21 are made in the free ends of the cores 19 so as to provide a secure and stable double connection.<br>
Preferably, the handles 15 have an arched shape so as to embrace the passenger seat, so making the passenger's accommodation on the vehicle more comfortable and stable.<br>
In this way, it has been possible to combine in a single element both the function of carrier and that of supporting handles for the passenger, so increasing safety and reducing the cost both as regards construction and as regards assembly on the vehicle.<br>
In fact, a carrier equipped with supporting handles for the passenger is obtained.<br>
In particular, the carrier can incorporate, made of one piece with it, either by being welded or by being directly/rigidly connected by mechanical means, such as screws, bolts, etc., two appropriately shaped handles (a right-hand one and a left-hand one), which perform all the functions which have been described and which are necessary for the passenger.<br>
On the saddle part, the carrier 11 is equipped with the ends of the handles 15 and is set at the rear of the vehicle, being rigidly and securely connected to the frame of the vehicle itself. The presence of ribs 18 renders the attachment of the carrier to the frame more stable and stronger.<br>
In addition to the advantages already mentioned, the main advantages of the carrier according to the<br>
invention lie in a greater freedom in terms of vehicle ergonomics in the direction of a greater comfort of the passenger.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
