Novel vanilloid receptor ligands and the use thereof for the production of<br>
pharmaceuticals<br>
The present invention relates to novel vanilloid receptor ligands, to processes for the<br>
production thereof, to pharmaceuticals containing said compounds and to the use of<br>
said compounds for the production of pharmaceuticals.<br>
The treatment of pain, particularly neuropathic pain, is of great significance in the<br>
medical field. There is a global need for effective pain therapies. The urgent need for<br>
action to provide a patient-friendly und targeted treatment of chronic and non-chronic<br>
states of pain, this being taken to mean the successful und satisfactory treatment of<br>
pain for patients, is documented by the large number of scientific papers which have<br>
recently appeared in the field of applied analgesics or in basic research concerning<br>
nociception.<br>
A suitable starting point for the treatment of pain; particularly of pain selected from<br>
the group consisting of acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and visceral pain,<br>
particularly preferably neuropathic pain; is the vanilloid receptor of subtype 1<br>
(VR1/TRPV1), frequently also designated as the capsaicin receptor. This receptor is<br>
stimulated, inter alia, by vanilloids such as capsaicin, heat, and protons and plays a<br>
central part in the generation of pain. Furthermore, it is significant for a large number<br>
of other physiological and pathophysiological processes such as migraine; states of<br>
depression; neurodegenerative disorders; cognitive disorders; anxiety; epilepsy;<br>
coughing; diarrhea; pruritus; inflammations; disorders of the cardiovascular system;<br><br>
food intake disorders; medicine addiction; medicine abuse and, in particular, urinary<br>
incontinence.<br>
It is thus an object of the invention to provide novel compounds which are particularly<br>
suitable for use as pharmacologically active substances in pharmaceuticals,<br>
preferably in pharmaceuticals for treatment of disorders or diseases that are at least<br>
partially mediated by vanilloid receptors 1 (VR1/TRPV1 receptors).<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that the substituted compounds of the general<br>
formula I stated below show excellent affinity to the vanilloid receptor of subtype 1<br>
(VR1/TRPV1 receptor) and are therefore particularly suitable for the prophylaxis<br>
and/or treatment of disorders or diseases which are at least partially mediated by<br>
vanilloid receptors 1 (VR1/TRPV1). The substituted compounds of the general<br>
formula I given below also show anti-inflammatory activity.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide substituted compounds of the<br>
general formula I,<br><br>
in which<br><br>

well-known to the person skilled in the art, for example, in respect of pressure or<br>
order of addition of the components. Optionally, the optimal procedure under the<br>
respective conditions can be determined by the person skilled in the art using simple<br>
preliminary tests. The intermediates and end products obtained by the<br>
aforementioned reactions can in each case be isolated and/or purified by<br>
conventional methods known to the person skilled in the art, if desired and/or<br>
necessary. Suitable purification techniques are, for example, extraction processes<br>
and chromatographic processes such as column chromatography or preparative<br>
chromatography. All of the process steps described above and the purification and/or<br>
isolation of intermediate or end products can be carried out partially or completely<br>
under a blanket of inert gas, preferably under a blanket of nitrogen.<br>
The substituted compounds according to the invention of the aforementioned general<br>

particularly physiologically compatible salts.<br><br>
The free bases of the respective substituted compounds according to the invention of<br>
the aforementioned general formula I and corresponding stereoisomers can, for<br>
example by reaction with an inorganic or organic acid, preferably with hydrochloric<br>

compatible salts. The free bases of the respective substituted compounds of the<br>
aforementioned general formula I and corresponding stereoisomers can be likewise<br>
caused to react with the free acid or a salt of a sugar substitute, such as saccharin,<br>
cyclamate, or acesulfam, to form the corresponding physiologically compatible salts.<br>
Similarly, the free acids of the substituted compounds of the aforementioned general<br>
formula I and corresponding stereoisomers can be caused to react with a suitable<br>
base to form the corresponding physiologically compatible salts. Mention may be<br>
made, for example, of the alkali-metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, or ammonium<br>
salts [NHXR4-X]+ in which x is equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and R stands for a linear or<br>

If the substituted compounds according to the invention designated by the<br>
aforementioned general formula I are obtained, following production thereof, in the<br>
form of a mixture of the stereoisomers thereof, preferably in the form of the<br>
racemates thereof or other mixtures of the various enantiomers and/or<br>
diastereoisomers thereof, these compounds can be separated and, if desired,<br>
isolated by methods known to the person skilled in the art. Mention may be made,<br>
for example, of chromatographic separation methods, particularly liquid-<br>
chromatographic methods carried out under standard pressure or at elevated<br>
pressure, preferably MPLC and HPLC methods, and also methods of fractional<br>
crystallization. In particular, individual enantiomers can be separated from each<br>
other, e.g. diastereoisomeric salts formed by means of HPLC on chiral stationary<br>
phase or by means of crystallization with chiral acids, say, (+)-tartaric acid, (-)-tartaric<br>
acid, or (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid.<br>
The substituted compounds according to the invention designated by the<br>
aforementioned general formula I and corresponding stereoisomers and in each case<br>
the corresponding acids, bases, salts, and solvates are toxicologically safe and are<br>
therefore suitable for use as pharmaceutically active substances in pharmaceuticals.<br>

Pharmacological methods:<br>
I. Functional investigation on the vanilloid receptor 1 (VRI/TRPV1 receptor)<br>
The agonistic or antagonistic action of the substances to be investigated on the<br>
vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1/TRPV1) of the species rat can be determined using the<br>
following assay. According to this assay, the Ca2+ influx through the receptor<br>
channel is quantified with the aid of a Ca2+-sensitive dye (Type Fluo-4, Molecular<br>
Probes Europe BV, Leiden Netherlands) in a fluorescent imaging plate reader<br>
(FLIPR, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA).<br>
Method:<br>
Complete medium: 50 mL of HAMS F12 Nutrient Mixture (Gibco Invitrogen GmbH,<br>
Karlsruhe, Germany) with<br>
10% by volume of FCS (fetal calf serum, Gibco Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe,<br>
Germany, heat-inactivated);<br>
2mM of L-glutamine (Sigma, Munich, Germany);<br>
1% by weight of AA solution (antibiotics/antimycotics solution, PAA, Pasching,<br>
Austria)<br>
and 25 ng/mL of Medium NGF (2.5 S, Gibco Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany)<br>
Cell culture plate: Poly-D-lysine-coated, black 96-well plates with a clear bottom (96-<br>
well black/clear plate, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) are additionally coated<br>
with laminin (Gibco Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) by diluting laminin to a<br>
concentration of 100 µg/mL with PBS (Ca-Mg-free PBS, Gibco Invitrogen GmbH,<br><br>
Karlsruhe, Germany). Aliquots having a concentration of 100 µg/mL of laminin are<br>
taken and stored at -20 °C. The aliquots are diluted with PBS in the ratio 1:10 to<br>
10 µg/mL of laminin and in each case 50 uL of the solution is pipeted into a well of<br>
the cell culture plate. The cell culture plates are incubated at 37 °C for at least two<br>
hours, the supernatant solution is aspirated and the wells are in each case washed<br>
twice with PBS. The coated cell culture plates are stored with supernatant PBS and<br>
this is removed only directly before the addition of the cells.<br>
Preparation of the cells:<br>
The vertebral column is removed from decapitated rats and this is laid directly in a<br>
cold, i.e. ice bath-surrounded, HBSS buffer (Hank's buffered saline solution, Gibco<br>
Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and 1% by volume of an AA solution<br>
(antibiotics/antimycotics solution, PAA, Pasching, Austria) is added. The vertebral<br>
column is cut in two, longitudinally, and the vertebral canal is removed together with<br>
fascias. Subsequently, the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are removed and in turn<br>
stored in cold HBSS buffer to which 1% by volume of an AA solution has been<br>
added. The DRGs completely freed from blood residues and spinal nerves are in<br>
each case transferred to 500 µL of cold collagenase Type 2 (PAA, Pasching, Austria)<br>
and incubated at 37 °C for 35 minutes. After the addition of 2.5% by volume of trypsin<br>
(PAA, Pasching, Austria), the preparation is incubated at 37 °C for a further 10<br>
minutes. On completion of incubation, the enzyme solution is carefully pipeted off<br>
and 500 uL of complete medium are added to the DRGs in each case. The DRGs are<br>
in each case repeatedly suspended, drawn through No. 1, No. 12, and No. 16<br>
needles by means of a syringe and transferred to 50 mL Falcon tubes and these are<br><br>
filled to 15 mL with complete medium. The contents of each Falcon tube are in each<br>
case filtered through a 70 µm Falcon filter insert and centrifuged at 1200 rpm and RT<br>
for 10 minutes. The resulting pellet is in each case taken up in 250 µL of complete<br>
medium and the cell count is determined.<br>
The number of cells in the suspension is adjusted to 3 x 105 per mL and in each case<br>
150 µL of this suspension are added to a well of the cell culture plates coated as<br>
described above. The plates are allowed to stand at 37 °C, 5% by volume of CO2 and<br>
95% relative humidity for two to three days in an incubator.<br>
Subsequently, the cells are loaded with 2 µM of Fluo-4 and 0.01% by volume of<br>
Pluronic F127 (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden Netherlands) in HBSS buffer<br>
(Hank's buffered saline solution, Gibco Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) at<br>
37°C for 30 min, washed 3 times with HBSS buffer and, after a further incubation of<br>
15 minutes at RT, employed in the FLIPR assay for Ca2+ measurement. The Ca2+-<br>
dependent fluorescence is measured before and after addition of substances (λex =<br>
488 nm, λem = 540 nm). Quantification is carried out by measuring the highest<br>
fluorescence intensity (FC, fluorescence counts) over time.<br>
FLIPR assay:<br>
The FLIPR protocol consists of two substance additions. Initially, the compounds to<br>
be tested (10 µM) are pipeted onto the cells and the Ca2+ influx is compared with the<br>
control (capsaicin 10 µM). Information is gained therefrom in percentage activation<br>
relative to the Ca2+ signal after addition of 10 µM of capsaicin (CP). After incubation<br>
for 5 minutes, 100 nM of capsaicin are applied and the influx of Ca2+ is likewise<br><br>
determined.<br>
Desensitizing agonists and antagonists lead to suppression of the Ca2+ influx. The<br>
percentage inhibition is calculated in comparison with the maximum inhibition<br>
achieved with 10 µM of capsaicin.<br>
Triple determinations (n=3) are carried out and these are repeated in at least 3<br>
independent experiments (N=4).<br>
Based on the percentage displacement effected by different concentrations of the<br>
compounds of the general formula I to be tested, IC50 inhibition concentrations that<br>
cause 50 percent displacement of capsaicin are calculated. Conversion using the<br>
Cheng Prusoff equation gave Ki values for the test substances (Cheng, Prusoff;<br>
Bioch. Pharmacol. 22, 3099-3108, 1973).<br>
II. Functional investigations on the vanilloid receptor (VR1)<br>
The agonistic or antagonistic action of the substances to be examined on the<br>
vanilloid receptor (VR1) can also be determined by the following assay. According to<br>
this assay, the Ca2+ influx through the canal is quantified with the aid of a Ca2+-<br>
sensitive dye (type Fluo-4, Molecular Probes, Europe BV, Leiden, Netherlands) in a<br>
fluorescent imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA).<br>
Method:<br>
Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1 cells, European Collection of Cell Cultures<br>
(ECACC) UK) are stably transfected with the VR1 gene. For carrying out functional<br>
investigations, these cells are plated on poly-D-lysine-coated, black 96-well plates<br><br>
with a clear bottom (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) in a density of 25,000<br>
cells/well. The cells are incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a culture<br>
medium (Nutrient Mixture 'am's F12, 10% by volume of FCS (fetal calf serum),<br>
18 µg/mL of L-proline). On the following day the cells are incubated with Fluo-4 (Fluo-<br>
4 2 µM, Pluronic F127 0.01 by volume, Molecular Probes in HBSS (Hank's buffered<br>
saline solution), Gibco Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 30 minutes at<br>
37 °C. The plates are then washed 3 times with HBSS buffer and, after another<br>
incubation over a period of 15 minutes at RT, are used in the FLIPR for Ca2+<br>
measurement. The Ca2+-dependent fluorescence is measured prior to and following<br>
the addition of the substances being examined (wavelength λex = 488 nm, λem = 540<br>
nm). Quantification is carried out by measuring the highest fluorescence intensity<br>
(FC, fluorescence counts) over time.<br>
FLIPR assay:<br>
The FLIPR protocol consists of two substance additions. First of all, the substances<br>
to be tested (10 µM) are pipeted onto the cells and the Ca2+ influx is compared with<br>
the control (capsaicin 10 µM) (percentage activation based on the Ca2+ signal<br>
following addition of 10 µM of capsaicin). Following incubation over a period of 5<br>
minutes 100 nM of capsaicin are applied and the influx of Ca2+ is likewise<br>
determined.<br>
Desensitizing agonists and antagonists led to a suppression of the Ca2+ influx. The<br>
percentage inhibition compared with the maximum inhibition achieved with 10 µM of<br>
capsaicin is calculated.<br><br>
Based on the percentage displacement effected by different concentrations of the<br>
compounds of the general formula I to be tested, IC50 inhibition concentrations that<br>
cause 50 percent displacement of capsaicin are calculated. Conversion using the<br>
Cheng Prusoff equation gave Ki values for the test substances (Cheng, Prusoff;<br>
Bioch. Pharmacol. 22, 3099-3108, 1973).<br>
III. Formalin test on mice<br>
The investigation for the determination of the antinociceptive action of the<br>
compounds according to the invention is carried out in the formalin test on male mice<br>
(NMRI, of 20 to 30 g body weight, Iffa, Credo, Belgium).<br>
In the formalin test, the first (early) phase (0 to 15 minutes after the formalin injection)<br>
and the second (late) phase (15 to 60 minutes after the formalin injection) are<br>
distinguished according to D. Dubuisson et al., Pain 1977, 4, 161-174. The early<br>
phase, as a direct reaction to the formalin injection, is a model of acute pain, whereas<br>
the late phase is regarded as a model of persistent (chronic) pain (T.J. Coderre et al.,<br>
Pain 1993, 52, 259-285). The appropriate literature references are incorporated<br>
herein by reference and are to be regarded as part of the disclosure.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are examined in the second phase of the<br>
formalin test, in order to obtain information concerning a substance's action on<br>
chronic/inflammatory pain.<br>
The point in time of administration of the compounds according to the invention<br>
before the formalin injection is selected according to the method of administration of<br><br>
the compounds according to the invention. Intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg of<br>
body weight of the test substances is carried out 5 minutes before the formalin<br>
injection. This is carried out by a single subcutaneous formalin injection (20 µL, 1%<br>
strength aqueous solution) into the dorsal side of the right hind paw so that in the<br>
case of free-moving experimental animals a nociceptive reaction is induced which is<br>
manifested by marked licking and biting of the relevant paw.<br>
The nociceptive behavior is then continuously registered during an investigation<br>
period of three minutes in the second (late) phase of the formalin test (21 to 24<br>
minutes after the formalin injection) by observation of the animals. Quantification of<br>
the pain behavior is carried out by summating the seconds during which the animals<br>
exhibit licking and biting of the relevant paw during the investigation period.<br>
In each case, comparison is carried out with control animals, which receive, instead<br>
of the compounds according to the invention, a vehicle (0.9% strength aqueous<br>
sodium chloride solution) prior to formalin administration. Based on the quantification<br>
of the pain behavior, the substance's action in the formalin test is determined as the<br>
degree of change compared with the corresponding control in percent.<br>
Following injection of the substances having an antinociceptive action in the formalin<br>
test, the aforementioned behavioral patterns of the animals, i.e. licking and biting,<br>
decrease or cease.<br>
IV. Test for analgesic effectiveness in the writhing test<br><br>
Investigation of the compounds of the general formula I according to the invention for<br>
analgetic effectiveness was carried out based on phenylquinone-induced writhing in<br>
mice, modified in accordance with I.e. Hendershot and J. Forsaith (1959) J.<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 125, 237-240. The corresponding literature reference is<br>
incorporated herein by reference and is to be regarded as part of the disclosure.<br>
For this purpose, male NMRI mice having a weight of from 25 to 30 g were used.<br>
Groups of 10 animals per dose of the test compound received by intraperitoneal<br>
administration, 10 minutes after intravenous administration of the compounds to be<br>
tested, 0.3 mL/mouse of a 0.02% strength aqueous solution of phenylquinone<br>
(phenylbenzoquinone, Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany and produced by adding to the<br>
solution 5% by weight of ethanol and storing it in a water bath at 45 °C). The animals<br>
were placed individually in observation cages. With the aid of a pushbutton counter,<br>
the number of pain-induced stretching movements (so-called writhing reactions -<br>
straightening of the body with stretching of the rear extremities) was counted over a<br>
period of from 5 to 20 minutes following the administration of the phenylquinone. The<br>
control was provided by animals receiving only physiological saline. All of the<br>
compounds were tested using the standard dosage of 10 mg/kg.<br>
V. Hypothermia assay in mice<br>
Description of the method:<br>
The hypothermia assay was carried out on male NMRI mice (weight 25-35 gram,<br>
breeder IFFA CREDO, Brussels, Belgium). The animals were kept under<br>
standardized conditions: light/dark rhythm (from 6:00 to 18:00 hours light phase; from<br>
18:00 to 6:00 hours dark phase), RT 19-22 °C, relative air humidity 35-70 %, 15 air<br><br>
changes per hour, air movement 
(ssniff R/M-Haltung, ssniff Spezialdiaeten GmbH, Soest, Germany) and tap water.<br>
Water and feed were withdrawn during the experiment. All animals were used only<br>
once during the experiment. The animals had an acclimatization period of at least 5<br>
days.<br>
Acute administration of capsaicin (VR-1 agonist) leads to a drop in the core<br>
temperature of the body in rats and mice due to stimulation of heat sensors. Only<br>
specifically effective VR-1 receptor antagonists can antagonize the capsaicin-induced<br>
hypothermia. By contrast, hypothermia induced by morphine is not antagonized by<br>
VR-1 antagonists. This model is therefore suitable for identifying substances with VR-<br>
1 antagonistic properties via their effect on body temperature.<br>
Measurement of the core temperature is carried out using a digital thermometer<br>
(Thermalert TH-5, physitemp, Clifton NJ, USA). The sensing element is inserted into<br>
the rectum of the animals.<br>
To give an individual basic value for each animal, the body temperature is measured<br>
twice at an interval of approximately half an hour. One group of animals (n = 6 to 10)<br>
then receives an intraperitoneal (i.p.) application of capsaicin 3 mg/kg and vehicle<br>
(control group). Another group of animals receives the substance to be tested (i.v. or<br>
p.o.) and additionally capsaicin (3 mg/kg) i.p. The administration of the test<br>
substance is carried out i.v. 10 min, or p.o 15 minutes, prior to capsaicin. The body<br>
temperature is then measured 7.5/15 and 30 min following capsaicin (i.v. + i.p.) or<br>
15/30/60/90/120 min (p.o. + i.p.) following capsaicin. In addition, one group of<br>
animals is treated with the test substance only and one group with vehicle only. The<br><br>
evaluation or representation of the measured values as mean +/- SEM of the<br>
absolute values is presented as a graphical representation. The antagonistic action is<br>
calculated as the percentage reduction of the capsaicin-induced hypothermia.<br>
VI. Neuropathic pain in mice<br>
The investigation on effectiveness on neuropathic pain was examined using the<br>
Bennett Model (chronic constriction injury; Bennett und Xie, 1988, Pain 33:87-107).<br>
Three loose ligatures are tied around the right ischiadic nerve of Ketavet/Rompun-<br>
anesthetized NMRI mice weighing 16-18 g. The animals develop hypersensitivity of<br>
the nervate paw caused by the damaged nerve, which hypersensitivity is quantified,<br>
following a recovery phase of one week, over a period of approximately three weeks<br>
by means of a cold metal plate (temperature 4 °C) (cold allodynia). The animals are<br>
observed on this plate over a period of 2 min, and the withdrawal reactions of the<br>
damaged paw are counted. Based on the pre-value prior to administration of<br>
substance, the substance's action over a certain period of time is determined at<br>
various points in time (e.g., 15, 30, 45, or 60 min following administration) and the<br>
resultant area under the curve (AUC) and/or the inhibition of cold allodynia at the<br>
individual measuring points was/were expressed as percentage action relative to the<br>
vehicle control (AUC) or to the starting value (individual measuring points). The group<br>
size is n= 10, the significance of an anti-allodynic action (*= p 
with the aid of an analysis of variance with repeated measurement and Bonferroni<br>
post hoc analysis.<br><br>

6. Preparation of specific acids<br>
Preparation of 2-(3-halogenated-4-(methylthio)phenyl)propanoic acids<br>
(cf. Examples 28, 29)<br><br>
Substituted methylthiophenylpropanoic acids can be prepared as described in<br>
US2003/225283. For this purpose, a solution of AICI3 (54.9 g, 412 mmol) in<br>
chloroform (180 mL) is cooled under an argon atmosphere to 0 °C and a solution of<br>
methyl-2-chloro-2-oxoacetate (24.3 mL, 264 mmol) in chloroform (180 mL) is added<br>
in drops. After this reaction mixture has been stirred for 30 min at 0 °C, a solution of<br>
2-chlorothioanisol (39.4 g, 247 mmol) in chloroform (180 mL) is added in drops. The<br>
red-coloured reaction mixture is slowly heated to room temperature and stirred for a<br><br>
further 4 h. The reaction mixture is then slowly stirred in ice water (700 mL) and the<br>
obtained yellow mixture is stirred for 15 min and filtered to remove the aluminium<br>
salts. The filtrate is extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 50 mL) and the combined<br>
organic phases are washed with sat. aq. sodium bicarbonate solution (1 x 50 mL).<br>
After drying of the organic phase over MgSO4 and removal of the solvent in vacuo,<br>
the (3-chloro-4-methylsulfanyl-phenyl)-oxo-methyl acetate as oil (36.4 g, 60%) is<br>
obtained (a).<br>
A solution of this ester (61.7 g, 252 mmol) in toluol (120 mL) is heated to 50 °C.<br>
While ensuring that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 60 °C, a<br>
3 M NaOH solution (105 mL, 313 mmol) is now added in drops and subsequently<br>
stirred for 1.5 h at 50 °C. After removal of the heat source, cone. HCI (10.6 mL, 290<br>
mmol) is added to the warm solution in drops and once the mixture is cooled to room<br>
temperature, it is let to stir for a further 16 h. The resultant precipitate is filtered off,<br>
washed with water (50 mL) and toluol (50 mL) and dried. The (3-chloro-4-<br>
methylsulfanyl-phenyl)-oxo-acetic acid accumulates as a white solid (57.2 g, 98%)<br>
(b).<br>
Hydrazine-hydrate (8.5 mL, 273 mmol) is provided in a reaction flask with a<br>
mechanical stirrer. After cooling to -50 °C, in one portion, the oxo-acetic acid (12.6 g,<br>
54.6 mmol) is added, which leads to an increase in temperature. The resultant milky<br>
mixture is heated to 80 °C and, after removal of the heat source, KOH (2.09 g, 31.7<br>
mmol) is added in one portion. This leads to an exothermal reaction. After cooling to<br>
80 °C, a further portion of KOH (2.09 g, 31.7 mmol) is added and in turn cooled to 80<br>
°C. This procedure is now repeated two further times. After addition of the fourth<br>
portion of KOH, the reaction mixture is boiled for 16 h at 100 °C. After cooling of the<br>
homogeneous reaction mixture to room temperature, it is diluted with water (12 mL)<br>
and, following transfer to a separating funnel, further water (12 mL) and diethylether<br><br>
(40 mL) are added. After phase separation, the organic phase is extracted with water<br>
(2x15 mL). Heptane (20 mL) is added to the combined aqueous phases and the<br>
mixture is vigorously stirred. While keeping the temperature below 50 °C by means of<br>
an ice bath, cone. HCI (26 mL) is added in drops over a period of 30 min and the<br>
resultant suspension is stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The resultant precipitate<br>
is filtered off and consecutively washed with 1 N aq. HCI solution (2x6 mL), heptane<br>
(1x12 mL) and heptane/diethyl ether (15 mL, 4:1). After drying, the (3-chloro-4-<br>
methylsulfanyl-phenyl)-acetic acid (10.48 g, 89%) is obtained as a cream-coloured<br>
solid (c).<br>
This (3-chloro-4-methylsulfanyl-phenyl)-acetic acid is now alkylated in alpha position<br>
in an analogous manner to Vazquez et al. Eur. J. Med. Chem. Chim. Ther. (1997),<br>
32, 6, 529-53. A solution of the aryl acetic acid (1.05 mmol) in dry THF (3 mL) is<br>
cooled to -78 °C and stirred under an argon atmosphere . For this purpose, a 2 M<br>
solution of LDA in hexane (1.6 mL, 3.2 mmol) and TMEDA (0.3 mL, 1.9 mmol) is<br>
added in drops over a period of 15 min. After 3 hours of slow stirring at -78 °C,<br>
methyl iodide (0.17 mL, 2.7 mmol) is added slowly while stirring. After 16 hours of<br>
stirring at room temperature, the reaction mixture is neutralized with sat. aq. NH4CI<br>
solution (10 mL) and stirred for 1 h at room temperature. After separation of the<br>
organic phase, the aqueous, alkaline phase is acidified with 5 N HCI and the product<br>
extracted with ether (3 x 20 mL). The combined organic phases are dried over<br>
Na2SO4 and the solvent is removed in vacuo. Purification by means of column<br>
chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate 8:2) produces the desired<br>
methylthiophenylpropanoic acid (d).<br><br>
Preparation of 2-(3-halogenated-4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)propanoic acids<br>
(cf. Examples 29, 31)<br><br>
In an analogous manner to the method described in US2003/225283, the<br>
methylthiophenylpropanoic acids are reacted to yield the corresponding<br>
methylsulfonylphenylpropanoic acids. In this process, a solution of<br>
methylthiophenylpropanoic acid (0.16 mmol) is dissolved in formic acid (0.19 mL, 4.8<br>
mmol) and cooled to 0 °C. After addition of 30% strength aq. hydrogen peroxide<br>
solution (0.10 mL, 0.8 mmol), stirring is performed at 0 °C for 30 min and the reaction<br>
is then quenched with 10% strength aq. sodium bisulphite solution. The reaction<br>
mixture is diluted with water (5 mL) and extracted ethyl acetate (2x5 mL). The<br>
combined organic phases are dried over Mg2SO4 and the solvent is removed in<br>
vacuo. The residue obtained is dissolved in methanol (1 mL) and a solution of<br>
KMNO4 (0.028 g, 0.176 mmol) in water (0.5 mL) is added by drops. The dark brown<br>
solution is now stirred for 30 min at room temperature and then diluted with methanol<br>
(10 mL). After filtration of the solution, the filtrate is concentrated in vacuo and<br>
purified by column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate 1:4) (a).<br><br>
Preparation of 2-(4-(N-substituted sulfamoyl)-3-fluorophenyl)propanoic acids<br>
(cf. Ex. 32)<br><br>
In an analogous manner to Greig, IR et al. J. Med. Chem. (2006), 49, 4787-7492, the<br>
bromo-fluorobenzyl-sulfonylchloride (5 mmol) is dissolved with dimethylamine (5<br>
mmol) in dichloromethane (15 mL). Pyridine (5 mmol) is added to this mixture and<br>
the mixture is stirred for 2 h at room temperature. After addition of water (15 mL), the<br>
organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase extracted with ethyl acetate (15<br>
mL). The combined organic phases are dried over Na2SO4, the solvent is removed in<br>
vacuo and the residue is purified by column chromatography (a).<br>
As described in Durandetti M. et al., Tetrahedron (2007), 63, 1146-1153, the<br>
sulfamoyl-aryl bromide is converted with ethylchloropropionate into sulfamoyl-<br>
arylpropanoic acid ester. Together with ethylchloropropionate (1.6 mL ,13 mmol),<br>
sulfamoyl-aryl bromide (10 mmol) is stirred under an argon atmosphere at room<br>
temperature in 15 ml DMF. For the purpose of activation, (1.1 g, 20 mmol) Mn,<br>
followed by 2,2'-bipyridine)nickel-(ll)-dibromide (0.26 g, 0.7 mmol) and TFA (20 mL)<br>
are then added. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1.5 h at 50 °C.<br><br>
After cooling of the reaction mixture, hydrolysis is performed with 25 mL 1 N HCI, the<br>
mixture is extracted 3 x with 25 mL diethyl ether, the combined organic phases are<br>
washed with 25 mL water and 25 mL sat. NaCI solution, dried over MgSO4 and<br>
concentrated in vacuo. The resultant precipitate is removed by suction, washed with<br>
diethyl ether and purified by means of column chromatography (b).<br>
The propionate (0.81 mmol) is then dissolved in a mixture of THF (1.6 mL, 20 mmol)<br>
and water (0.8 mL, 45 mmol). After addition of LiOH (0.058 g, 2.43 mmol), the<br>
reaction mixture is refluxed overnight. For the purpose of processing, 25 mL water<br>
and 25 mL diethyl ether are added to the mixture and the resultant phases are<br>
separated. The aqueous phase is acidified with HCI and extracted 3x with in each<br>
case 25 mL dichloromethane. After combination of the organic phases, drying over<br>
MgSO4 and concentration in vacuo, the N-substituted sulfamoyl-<br>
fluorophenylpropanoic acid can be obtained.<br><br>
Preparation of 2-(4-methoxy- and hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)propanoic acids<br>
(cf. Examples 35-38)<br><br>
In an analogous manner to the method described in WO2006/078834, on the basis of<br>
aryl bromides, phenylpropanoic acids can be obtained by reaction with<br>
diethylmalonate. For this purpose, in the first step, NaH (60%, 1.45 g, 36.2 mmol) is<br>
added to a solution of aryl bromide (16.5 mmol), CuBr (4.72 g, 32.9 mmol) and<br>
diethyl malonate (5 mL, 32.9 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (20 mL) at room temperature<br>
while stirring slowly and stirred for 16 h at 100 °C. After filtration, the filtrate is<br>
concentrated in vacuo and purified by means of column chromatography<br>
(hexane/ethyl acetate 4:1) (a).<br>
The obtained phenylmalonic acid diethyl ester (21 mmol) is now dissolved in 2 N<br>
NaOH /THF:H20 (1:1) (20 mL) and refluxed for 3 h. After acidification of the reaction<br>
mixture to pH 1 with cone HCI, stirring is carried out for a further hour at room<br>
temperature. The solution is then adjusted with 1 N NaOH to pH 13 and extracted<br>
with diethyl ether. The aqueous phase is adjusted with 1 N HCI to pH 5 and extracted<br><br>
with ethyl acetate (3 x). The combined organic phases are washed with sat. NaCI<br>
solution, dried over Na2SO4 and, after filtration, the solvent is removed in vacuo (b).<br>
This phenylacetic acid is now alkylated in an analogous manner to Vazquez et al.<br>
Eur. J. Med. Chem. Chim. Ther. (1997), 32, 6, 529-53 in alpha position. A solution of<br>
arylacetic acid (1.05 mmol) in dry THF (3 mL) is cooled under an argon atmosphere<br>
to -78 °C and stirred. For this purpose, a 2 M solution of LDA in hexane (1.6 mL, 3.2<br>
mmol) and TMEDA (0.3 mL, 1.9 mmol) is added in drops over a period of 15 min.<br>
After 3 hours of slow stirring at -78 °C, methyl iodide (0.17 mL, 2.7 mmol) is added<br>
slowly while stirring. After 16 hours of stirring at room temperature, the reaction<br>
mixture is neutralized with sat. aq. NH4CI solution (10 mL) and stirred for 1 h at room<br>
temperature. After separation of the organic phase, the aqueous, alkaline phase is<br>
acidified with 5 N HCI and the product is extracted with ether (3 x 20 mL). The<br>
combined organic phases are dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent is removed in<br>
vacuo. Purification by means of column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate 8:2)<br>
produces the desired substituted phenylmethoxy-propanoic acid (c).<br>
According to a method known to the person skilled in the art, the methoxy ether is<br>
split by means of HBr in glacial acetic acid and the corresponding phenylhydroxy-<br>
propanoic acid is obtained (d).<br>
Preparation of 2-(4-amino-3,5-difluorophenyl)propanoic acid<br>
(cf. Ex. 26)<br><br><br>
KOtBu (3.57 g, 31.85 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (30 mL) and cooled to -45 °C. A<br>
mixture of ethyl-2-chloropropionate (2 mL, 15.9 mmol) and 2,6-difluoronitrobenzene<br>
(2.5 g, 15.7 mmol) were added slowly in drops to the solution kept at -40 °C and<br>
stirred for 1 h after addition. For the purpose of processing, the reaction mixture was<br>
adjusted with 16% strength HCI to pH 4 and diluted with water (150 mL). The mixture<br>
was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 mL), the combined organic phases washed<br>
with water (50 mL) and sat. NaCI solution (2 x 50 mL) and dried over MgSO4. After<br>
removal of the solvent in vacuo, the product was obtained as an oil (4.12 g, 99%) (a).<br>
The difluoronitropropanoate (2.59 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in EtOH/acetic acid<br>
ester (200 mL, 1 : 1) and hydrated in the H cube (1 bar, 25 °C, 1 mL/min, 0.25 mol/L).<br>
After removal of the solvent in vacuo, the difluoroaminopropionate could be obtained<br>
as an oil (2.27 g, 99%) (b).<br>
The raw product of the hydrogenation (1 g, 4.36 mmol) was dissolved in THF/water<br>
(10 mL, 2 :1), LiOH (0.312 g, 13.1 mmol) added and refluxed for 16 h.<br>
Water (50 mL) and diethyl ether (25 mL) were added to the reaction mixture. After<br>
phase separation, the aqueous phase was acidified with HCI to pH 2 and extracted<br>
with dichloromethane (3 x 50 mL). The combined organic phases were dried over<br><br>
MgSO4 and the solvent removed in vacuo. The product was obtained as a white solid<br>
(0.72 g, 81%) (c).<br>
7. General instructions for the reaction of amines of the general formulas V or<br>
X with carboxylic acids of the general formula VII<br>
Method A:<br>
The acid of the general formula VII (1 equivalent), the amine of the general formulas<br>
V or X (1.2 equivalents) and EDCI (1.2 equivalents) are stirred in DMF (10 mmol of<br>
acid in 20 mL) over a period of 12 hours at RT, and water is then added. The reaction<br>
mixture is extracted with EA a number of times, the aqueous phase is saturated with<br>
NaCI and then again extracted with EA. The combined organic phases are washed<br>
with 1N hydrochloric acid and sat. aq. NaCI soln., dried over MgSO4, and the solvent<br>
is removed in vacuo. The residue is purified by means of flash chromatography<br>
(SiO2, EA/hexane 1:2).<br>
Method B:<br>
The acid of the general formula VII (1 equivalent) and the amine of the general<br>
formula V or X (1.1 equivalents) are dissolved in DCM (1 mmol acid in 6 mL), and to<br>
the solution EDCI (1.5 equivalents), HOBt (1.4 equivalents) and triethylamine (3<br>
equivalents) are added at 0 °C. The reaction mixture is stirred at RT for a period of<br>
20 h and purified by column chromatography (2:1 mixture of n-hexane/AE).<br>
