Description<br>
Method for reducing the content of N2O and NOx in gases<br>
The present invention relates to a method by means of which the content of N2O and NOx in gases, in particular in process gases or in offgases, can be reduced or eliminated entirely.<br>
Many processes, e.g. combustion processes or the industrial production of nitric acid, result in an offgas laden with nitrogen monoxide NO, nitrogen dioxide NO2 (here referred to collectively as NOx) and nitrous oxide N2O. While NO and NO2 have for a long time been recognized as compounds having an ecotoxic relevance (acid rain, smog formation) and threshold values for the maximum permissible emissions of these have been laid down worldwide, nitrous oxide has in recent years increasingly moved into the focus of environmental protection, since it makes a not inconsiderable contribution to the degradation of stratospheric ozone and to the greenhouse effect. For reasons of environmental protection, there is therefore an urgent need for technical solutions which reduce or if possible completely eliminate nitrous oxide emissions together with the NOx emissions.<br>
Numerous possible methods are already known for the separate removal of N2O and of NOx-<br>
Thus, the NOx concentration is reduced primarily by methods involving catalytic reduction of NOx which employ a variety of reducing agents; zeolite catalysts have frequently been described. Apart from Cu-exchanged zeolites, iron-containing zeolites are of , particular interest for practical  applications.  Reducing agents used are,  for<br><br><br>
In contrast to reduction of the concentration of NOx in offgases, which has been established in industry for many years, there are only a few industrial processes for eliminating N2O and these are usually based on a thermal or catalytic degradation of N2O. An overview of catalysts which have been shown to be suitable in principle for the degradation and reduction of nitrous oxide is given by Kaptei jn et al. (F. Kaptei jn, et al. , Appl. Cat. B: Environmental 9 (1996) 25-64),<br>
Once again, Fe- and Cu-zeolite catalysts appear to be particularly useful, either for pure decomposition of N2O into N2 and O2 (US-A-5,171,553) or for the catalytic reduction of N^O with the aid of, for example, NH3 to form N, and H,0.<br>
Thus, JP-A-07 060 126 describes a catalyst for the reduction of N2O with NH3 in the presence of iron-containing zeolites of the pentasil type (MFI). Since industrially usable degradation rates are achieved only at temperatures of &gt;450°C, particular demands are made of the thermal stability of the catalyst.<br>
In Catal. Lett. 62 (1999) 41-44 Mauvezin et al. give an overview of the suitability of various, iron-exchanged zeolites of the MOR, MFI, BEA, FER, FAU, MAZ and OFF types for the reduction of N2O with NH3. According to this, a decrease of &gt;70% in the N2O concentration can be achieved by NH3 addition at 450°C only in the case of Fe-BEA.<br>
Various processes variants for the simultaneous removal of<br><br>
NOx and N2O, which is particularly desirable for reasons of simplicity and economics, may likewise be found in the literature. These always describe the joint reduction of<br>
NO and RO.<br>
Thus, US-A-4,571,329 claims a process for the reduction of NOx and NjO by means of ammonia in the presence of Fe-substituted zeolite catalysts which firstly catalyze the reaction of NH3 with NOx to form H2O and N2 and secondly likewise catalyze the reaction of NH3 with N2O to form H^O and Nj. Catalysts mentioned as being suitable are iron-substituted zeolites from the group consisting of mordenite, clinoptilolite, faujasite and zeolites Y. The ratio of NH3 to NOj is at least 1.3.<br>
WO-A-00/48715 describes a process in which an offgas comprising NOx and N2O is passed at temperatures of from 200 to 600^C over an iron zeolite catalyst of the beta type (=BEA) , with the offgas further comprising NH3 in a ratio of from 0.7 to 1.4 based on the total amount of NOx and N2O. NH3 in this case likewise serves as reducing agent both for NOx and for N2O. Although the process is carried out as a single-stage process at temperatures of less than 450°C, it has the in-principle disadvantage that, like the above-mentioned methods, it requires an approximately equimolar amount of the reducing agent NH3 based on the amount of N.O to eliminate the NjO content .<br>
JP-A-51/03953 describes a process for the removal of oxides of nitrogen, comprising N.O and NOx, in which Np and NOx are reduced s imultaneously by means o f hydrocarbons. As catalyst, use is made of y-Al2O3 or zeolite support on which a metal from the group consisting of Cu, Ag, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh and Ir. This method, too, requires the .addition of reducing agent in an amount corresponding to the total<br><br>
amount of N2O and NOx.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple, economical method of simultaneously reducing the concentration of N.O and NOx in the presence of a single type of catalyst, which can be carried out at a very low operating temperature and requires a minimal consumption of reducing agent.<br>
This object is achieved by the method of the invention.<br>
The present invention provides a method of reducing the content of NOx and N2O in gases, in particular in process gases and offgases, which comprises the measures:<br>
a)	adding a reducing agent which can reduce NOx and is gaseous under the reaction conditions to the NOx-and N2O-containing gas in the amount required for reduction of the NOx,<br>
b)	introducing the gas mixture into an apparatus having a reaction zone containing one or more iron-laden zeolites whose crystal structure has no pores or channels having a width greater than or equal to 7 Angstrom,<br>
c)	setting a temperature of up to 450°C in the reaction zone and selecting a flow rate of the gas mixture and/or the amount of catalyst so that the desired degree of decomposition of N2O is achieved.<br>
To carry out the method of the invention, the N2O- and NOx-containing gas is firstly mixed with a gaseous reducing agent, preferably with NH3, and subsequently passed at a temperature of less than 450°C at the abovementioned space velocity over the catalyst for the simultaneous removal of N2O (by decomposition) and NOx (by reduction) .<br><br>
According to feature a) of the method of the invention, the reducing agent is added in the amount required for reduction of the NOx. For the purposes of the present description, this is the amount of reducing agent necessary to reduce the NOx in the gas mixture either in its entirely or down to the desired final concentration without appreciable reduction of the N2O taking place. In the calculation of the amount of reducing agent, the N2O content of the gas mixture does not play any role, since the reducing agent acts virtually selectively on NOx.<br>
The term space velocity refers to the quotient of the volume of gas mixture per hour divided by the volume of catalyst. The space velocity can thus be set via the flow rate of the gas and/or the amount of catalyst.<br>
In general, the temperature of the gas mixture in the reaction zone is from 250 to 450°C, preferably from 300 to 450°C, in particular from 350 to 450°C.<br>
The temperature, flow rate and amount of catalyst in step c) are preferably selected so that at least 50%, more preferably at least 70% and very particularly preferably at least 80%, of the N2O are decomposed in the reaction zone.<br>
The reduction of the content of NOx and N2O is carried out in the presence of a single type of catalyst, preferably a single catalyst which consists essentially of one or more iron-laden zeolites.<br>
As reducing agents for the purposes of the invention, it is possible to use substances which have a high activity and selectivity for the reduction of NO2 and whose selectivity and activity under the chosen reaction conditions is greater than for the possible reduction of N2O. Reducing<br><br>
agents which can be used for the purposes of the invention are, for example, hydrocarbons, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia or mixtures thereof, e.g. synthesis gas. Particular preference is given to ammonia.<br>
The amount of reducing agent added must not be appreciably greater than that required for the reduction of NOx- In the case of ammonia as reducing agent, use is made, depending on the extent to which the NOx content is to be reduced, of up to 1.33 (8/6) mol of ammonia per mole of NOx- If a smaller decrease in the NOx concentration is wanted, the molar amount of ammonia is 1.33*y per mole of NOx; here, y is the percentage of the NOx which is to be consumed in the reduction. The required molar ratio of reducing agent to NOx can depend on the reaction conditions. It has been found that as the pressure increases or the reaction temperature decreases, the amount of reducing agent required for complete removal of the NOx decreases. In the case of ammonia, the amount required drops from the above-mentioned 1,33 mol to 1.0 mol per mole of NOx-<br>
Catalysts used are iron-laden zeolites or mixtures of iron-laden zeolites whose crystal structure has no pores or channels having crystallographic diameters greater than or equal to 7.0 Angstrom.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that decomposition of N2O can be brought about at temperatures of 
Under the present process conditions, NH3 does not act as a reducing agent for N2O but instead selectively reduces the NOx present in the offgas.<br><br>
without being tied to any theoretical considerations, the following mechanism could provide a physicochemical explanation of the invention:<br>
In the first step of the N2O decomposition, an oxygen atom is donated to an active center (symbolized by *) of the iron zeolite catalyst in accordance with:<br>
N2O + * -&gt; N2 + 0*	eq. 1<br>
Under the assumption of an unoccupied active center on the catalyst, this decomposition of N2O occurs rapidly. However, the removal of the active oxygen atom necessary to form molecular O2 according to<br>
2 O* -^ O2 + 2*	eq. 2<br>
is comparatively slow. This means that if the reaction according to eq. 2 is accelerated, degradation of NoO also occurs more rapidly.<br>
This fxmction is performed by NO which reacts with the sorbed 0* according to<br>
NO + 0* ^ NO2 + *	eq. 3<br>
At sufficiently high temperatures, a sufficiently fast reformation of NO according to<br>
2 NO2 1^ 2 NO + O2 + *      eq. 4<br>
occurs in the presence of the catalysts used according to the invention.<br><br>
At  lower  operating  temperatures,	as  are  particularly<br>
preferred  for  the  purposes  of	the  invention,  the<br>
establishment of the NO/NO2	equilibrium occurs<br>
correspondingly slowly.<br>
Reaction of the 0* species is limited by a deficiency of NO.<br>
Since eq. 3 is a chemical equilibrium, complete reaction of 0* cannot be effected purely by introduction of NO but also requires removal of NO2. This is achieved by addition of the gaseous reducing agent, e.g. NH3, which reacts selectively with NO2 to form N2 and H2O according to<br>
6 NO2 + 8 NH3 -&gt; 7 N2 + 12 H2O   eq. 5<br>
even at low temperatures.<br>
This means that the presence of NOx and addition of a gaseous reducing agent, e.g. ammonia, accelerates the degradation of NO2 without reaction equivalents of NH3 being consumed for this purpose. The amount of NH3 required in the presence of the catalysts used according to the invention is determined by the desired removal of NOx-However, it should not be appreciably greater than that required for the reduction of NOx/ since excess NH3 blocks the decomposition of N2O and may at elevated temperatures lead to the undesirable reduction of N2O by NH3. The latter is the case particularly when iron zeolites having pores or channels larger than 7 Angstrom outside the scope of the invention are used. Examples are zeolites of the BEA type.<br>
The method of the invention therefore makes it possible to carry out both the decomposition of N2O and the reduction of NOx at a uniformly low operating temperature in a single<br><br>
catalyst bed with low consumption of gaseous reducing agents such as NH3, which has hitherto not been possible using the methods described in the prior art.<br>
This is a great advantage particularly when large amounts of N2O have to be eliminated.<br>
As a result of the use of iron-containing zeolites, preferably those of the FER, MEL and MFI types, in particular Fe-ZSM-5, the degradation of N2O by the above method in the presence of NOx occurs at low temperatures at which decomposition of N2O would not take place at all without NOx and NH3.<br>
For the purposes of the invention, the catalyst bed can be coN2Ogured in any way. It can, for example, be in the form of a tube reactor or radial basket reactor. The way in which the gaseous reducing agent is introduced into the gas stream to be treated can also be chosen freely according to the invention, as long as it is done upstream of the reaction zone. The reducing agent can, for example, be fed into the inlet line upstream of the vessel containing the catalyst bed or directly before the bed. The reducing agent can be introduced in the form of a gas or a liquid or aqueous solution which vaporizes in the gas stream to be treated.<br>
Catalysts used according to the invention preferably comprise &gt;50% by weight, in particular &gt;70% by weight, of one or more iron-laden zeolites. Thus, for example, an Fe-ZSM-5 zeolite together with a further iron-containing zeolite, e.g. an iron-containing zeolite of the MFI or FER type, may be present in the catalyst used according to the invention.<br><br>
In addition, further additives known to those skilled in the art, e.g. binders, can be present in the catalyst used according to the invention.<br>
Catalysts used according to the invention are preferably based on zeolites into which iron has been introduced by solid-state ion exchange. These are usually produced from commercially available ammonium zeolites (e.g. NH4-ZSM-5) and appropriate iron salts (e.g. FeS04 - 7 H2O) by mixing these intensively by mechanical means in a ball mill at room temperature. (Turek et al. ; Appl. Catal. 184, (1999) 249-256;   EP-A-0 955 080) .   The  disclosures  of  these references are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. The catalyst powders obtained are subsequently calcined at temperatures in the range from 400 to 600°C in air in a muffle  furnace.  After calcination,  the  iron-containing zeolites  are washed  intensively with distilled water, filtered  off  and  dried.  The  iron-containing  zeolites obtained in this way are subsequently admixed with suitable binders and mixed and,  for example,  extruded to form cylindrical  catalyst bodies.  Suitable binders are all customarily used binders;  the most useful are aluminum silicates such as kaolin.<br>
According to the present invention, the zeolites which can be used are laden with iron. The iron content can be up to 25% based on the mass of zeolite, but is preferably from 0.1 to 10%. The crystal structure of the zeolites has no pores or channels having crystallographic diameters greater than or equal to 7.0 Angstrom.<br>
The method of the invention also encompasses the use of zeolites in which part of the lattice aluminum is isomorphously substituted . by one or more elements, for example is replaced by one or more elements selected from<br><br>
among B, Be, Ga, Fe, Cr, V, As, Sb and Bi. The use of zeolites in which the lattice silicon is isomorphously substituted by one or more elements,  for example is replaced by one or more elements selected from among Ge, Ti, Zr and Hf, is likewise included.<br>
Precise details regarding the makeup or structure of the zeolites used according to the invention are given in Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types, Elsevier, 4^^ Revised Edition 1996, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
Zeolites of the MFI (pentasil) or FER (ferrierite) type are preferred according to the invention. Particular preference is given to zeolites of the Fe-ZSM-5 type.<br>
In the method of the invention, very particular preference is given to using the above-defined zeolite catalysts which have been treated with steam ("steamed") catalysts. Such treatment dealuminates the lattice of the zeolites; this treatment is known per se to those skilled in the art. These hydrothermally treated zeolite catalysts surprisingly display a particularly high activity in the method of the invention.<br>
Preference is given to using hydrothermally treated zeolite catalysts which have been laden with iron and in which the ratio of extra-lattice aluminum to lattice aluminum is at least 1:2, preferably from 1:2 to 20:1.<br>
The operating temperature of the catalyst over which N2O and NOx are eliminated is, according to the invention, 
The gas laden with nitrogen oxides is usually passed over<br><br>
the catalyst at a space velocity of from 200 to 200 000 h-1 preferably from 5 000 to 100 000 h-1 in particular from 5 000 to 50 000 h-1 and very particularly preferably from 5 000 to 30 000 h-1, based on the catalyst volLime.<br>
The choice of operating temperature is, like the space velocity selected, determined by the desired degree of removal of N2O.<br>
The desired removal of NOx is set by the amount of gaseous reducing agent, e.g. NH3, added. According to eq. 5, this is preferably about 8/6 of the amount of NOx to be removed in the case of ammonia, but at high pressures or low temperatures can also assume smaller values, as described above.<br>
The method of the invention is generally carried out at a pressure in the range from 1 to 50 bar, preferably from 1 to 25 bar.<br>
The introduction of the reducing agent upstream of the<br>
catalyst bed is carried out by means of a suitable device,<br>
e.g.  an  appropriate  pressure  valve  or  appropriately<br>
coN2Ogured nozzles.<br>
The water content of the reaction gas is preferably in the<br>
range 
vol-ume.<br>
In general, a relatively low water concentration is preferred, since higher water contents would make higher operating temperatures necessary. This could, depending on the type of zeolite used and the operating time, exceed the hydrothermal stability limits of the. catalyst and is thus to be matched to the individual case chosen.<br><br>
The presence of CO2 and of other deactivating constituents of the reaction gas which are known to those skilled in the art should also be minimized if possible, since these would have an adverse effect on the degradation of N2O.<br>
The method of the invention also succeeds in the presence of O2, since the catalysts used according to the invention have sufficient selectivities to suppress reaction of the gaseous reducing agent such as NH3 with 0^ at temperatures of 
All these influencing factors and also the chosen catalyst loading, i.e. the space velocity, need to be taken into account when choosing the appropriate operating temperature of the reaction zone.<br>
The conversions which can be achieved for N.O and NOx by means of the present method are &gt;80%, preferably &gt;90%. The method is thus superior to the prior art in terms of its performance, i.e. the achievable degrees of conversion of N2O and NOx, and also in respect of its operating and capital costs.<br>
The method of the invention can be employed, in particular, in nitric acid production, for offgases from power stations or for gas turbines. These processes produce process gases and offgases which comprise oxides of nitrogen and from which the oxides of nitrogen can be removed in an inexpensive way by means of the method indicated here.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following example:<br>
As catalyst, use is made of an iron-laden zeolite of the ZSM-5 type.<br><br>
The Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by solid-state ion exchange starting out from a commercially available zeolite in ammonimn form (ALSI-PENTA, SM27) . Details of the preparation can be taken from: M. Rauscher, K. Kesore, R. Monnig, W. Schwieger, A. TiSler, T. Turek: "Preparation of highly active Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst through solid state ion exchange for the catalytic decomposition of N2O, in Appl. Catal. 184 (1999) 249-256.<br>
The catalyst powders were calcined in air at 823K for 6 hours, washed and dried overnight at 383K. After addition of appropriate binders, they were extruded to form cylindrical catalyst bodies which were broken up to give granules having a particle size of 1-2 mm.<br>
As apparatus for reducing the NOx and N2O content, use was made of a tube reactor which was charged with such an amount of the above catalyst that a space velocity of 10 000  h-1 based on the inflowing gas stream resulted. NH3 gas was added before the reactor inlet. The operating temperature of the reactor was set by means of heating facilities. Analysis of the gas stream flowing into and out of the apparatus was carried out by means of an FTIR gas analyzer.<br>
At the inlet concentrations and operating temperatures indicated below, the degrees of removal of NOj and NOx reported in table 1 were achieved.<br>
Exanple 1: 375°C (lA) , 4000 (IB), 425° (IC)<br>
Inlet concentrations:<br>
1 000 ppm of N2O, 2 500 ppm of H2O and 2.5% by volume of 02<br>
in N2<br><br>
Example  2:   375°C  {2A) ,   400°C   (2B) ,   425°C   (2C)<br>
Inlet concentrations:<br>
1 000 ppm of N2O, 1 000 ppm of NOx, 2 500 ppm of H,0, 2.5%<br>
by volume of 02 and 1 200 ppm of NH3 in N2<br><br>
As is demonstrated in the examples, the presence of NOx and the addition of ammonia lead to a dramatic increase in the decomposition of N2O without NH3 being consumed for the reduction of N2O. The achieved decrease of about 90% in the NOx content (starting from 1 000 ppm of NOx) corresponds within measurement accuracy to the amount of NH3 added (1 200 ppm) divided by the stoichiometric reaction ratio of 8/6 in accordance with equation 5. On the other hand, the degree of N2O decomposition at a given.. NOx and NH3 concentration is dependent only on the operating temperature and the space velocity set.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
