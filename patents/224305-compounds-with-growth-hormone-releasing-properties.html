COMPOUNDS WITH GROWTH HORMONE RELEASING PROPERTIES<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, compositions containing them, and their use for treating medical disorders resulting from a deficiency in growth hormone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Growth hormone is a hormone which stimulates growth of all tissues capable of growing, in addition, growth hormone is known to have a number of effects on metabolic processes, e.g., stimulation of protein synthesis and free fatty acid mobilisation and to cause a switch in energy metabolism from carbohydrate to fatty acid metabolism. Deficiency in growth hormone can result in a number of severe medical disorders, e.g., dwarfism.<br>
Grov1H hormone is released from the pituitary. The release is under tight control of a number of hormones and neurotransmitters either directly or indirectly. Grov/th hormone release can be stimulated by growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and inhibited by somatostatin. In both cases the hormones are released from the hypothalamus but their action is mediated primarily via specific receptors located in the pituitary. Other compounds which stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary have also been described. For example arginine, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylaianine (L-Dopa), glucagon, vasopressin, PACAP (pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide), muscarinic receptor agonists and a synthetic hexapeptide, CHRP (growth hormone releasing peptide) release endogenous grov1H hormone either by a direct effect on the pituitary or by affecting the release of GHRH and/or somatostatin from the hypothalamus.<br>
In disorders or conditions where increased levels of growth hormone is desired, the protein nature of growth hormone makes anything but parenteral administration non-viable. Furthermore, other directly acting natural secretagogues, e.g., GHRH and PACAP, are longer polypeptides for which reason parenteral administration is prefen-ed.<br><br>
The use of certain compounds for increasing the levels of growth hormone in mammals has previously been proposed, e.g. in EP 18 072, EP 83 864, WO 8302272, WO 8907110, WO 8901711, WO 8910933, WO 8809780, WO 9118016, WO 9201711, WO 9304081, WO 9413696, WO 9517423, WO 9514666, WO 9615148, WO 9622997, WO 9635713, WO 9700894, WO 9722620, WO 9723508, WO 9740023, and WO 9810653.<br>
The composition of growth hormone releasing compounds is important for their growth hormone releasing potency as well as their bioavailability. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds with growth hormone releasing properties. Moreover, it is an object to provide novel growth hormone releasing compounds (growth hormone secre-tagogues) which are specific and/or selective and have no or substantially no side-effects, such as e.g. release of LH, FSH, TSH, ACTH, vasopressin, oxytocin, Cortisol and/or prolactin. It is also an object to provide compounds which have good oral bioavailability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided novel compounds which act directly on the pituitary cells under normal experimental conditions in vitro to release growth hormone therefrom.<br>
These growth hormone releasing compounds can be utilized in vitro as unique research tools for understanding, inter alia, how growth hormone secretion is regulated at the pituitary level.<br>
Moreover, the growth hormone releasing compounds of the present invention can also be administered in vivo to increase endogenous grov1H hormone release.<br><br>

General Methods<br>
The methods illustrated in below schemes I - III are by no mean intended to limit the present invention in any aspect, but should only be seen as a guidance for how the present compounds may be prepared.<br><br><br><br>
may be synthesized from a BOC-protected amino acid (cf. scheme I). The acid is transformed into an ester by reaction with or without a reagent such as e. g. 1-hydroxybenzo-trlazole, 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotnazole, or 3-hydroxy-1,2,3-benzotriazole-4(3H)-one and a arragent such e.g. as N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride or diiso-propylcarbodiimide and a catalyst such as N,N-dimethylaminopyridine. The ester may be reduced by a suitable reagent, such as diisobutylaluminum hydride in a appropriate solvent such as e.g. toluene, dichloromethane, ether, or tetrahydrofuran to give the BOC-protected aldehyde or alcohol. If the alcohol is obtained, the alcohol may be oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde, by a suitable method, such as e.g. dimethylsulfoxide/oxalyl chloride/tri-ethylamine or dimethylsufloxide/sulfotrioxide/pyridine, pyridinium dichromate, or pyridinium chlorochromate. A reductive amination with an appropriate amine N(R15)(R16) and a suitable rrsagent, such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride in a suitable solvent such as e.g. alcohols may yleld the BOC-protected amine. If at least one of R15 or R16 is hydrogen, the amino group may be protected by a method known to those skilled in the art and described in the literature as e.g. T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts Protective groups inl organic synthesis, 2nd edition, Wiley, New York, before carrylng out the following steps. The removal of the BOC-protection group can be achieved by a method known to those skilled in the art as described in T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts Protective groups in organic synthesis, 2nd,edition, Wiley, New York, such as e.g. hydrogen chloride in ethyl acetate, or tiifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane.<br><br><br><br><br>
and a suitable protected acid with or without a coupling reagent such as e.g. 1-hydroxy-benzotriazole, 1-hydroxy-7-azaben20triazole, or 3-hydroxy-1,2,3-benzotria2ole-4(3H)-one and a reagent such e.g. as N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride or diisopropylcarbodiimide in a suitable solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide or dichloro-methane (of. scheme 11). The product may be deprotected at the nitrogen of the acid by a method known for a person skilled in the art and described in the literature e.g. in T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts Protective groups in organic synthesis, 2--^ edition, Wiley, New York. The product is coupled with a suitable protected acid with or without a coupling reagent such as e.g. l-hydroxybenzotriazole, 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole, or 3-hydroxy-1,2,3-benzo-tria2ole-4(3H)-one and a reagent such e.g. as N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride or diisopropylcarbodiimide in a suitable solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide or dichloromethane. The product may be deprotected at the nitrogen of the acid by a method known for a person skilled in the art and described in the literature e.g. in T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts Protective groups in organic synthesis, 2--^ edition, Wiley, New York. The product is coupled with suitable protected acid with or without a coupling reagent such as e.g. 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, l-hydroxy-y-azabenzotriazole, or 3-hydroxy-1,2,3-benzotnazole-4(3H)-one and a reagent such e.g. as N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride or diisopropylcarbodiimide in a suitable solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide or dichloromethane.

For the above indications the dosage will vary depending on the growth hormone secretagogue employed, e.g. on the compound of formula 1 employed, on the mode of administration and on the therapy desired. However, generally dosage levels between 0.0001 and 100 mg/kg body weight daily are administered to patients and animals to obtain effective release of endogenous growth hormone. Morever the compounds of formula I have no or substantially no side-effects, when administered in the above dosage levels, such side-effects being e.g. release of LH, FSH, TSH, ACTH, vasopressin, oxytocin, Cortisol and/or prolactin. Usually, dosage forms suitable for oral, nasal, pulmonal or transdermal administration comprise from about 0.0001 mg to<br><br>
about 100 mg, preferably from about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg of the compounds of fomiula I admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>

A further use of growth hormone secretagogue compounds of formula I is in combination with other secretagogues such as GHRP (2 or 6), GHRH and its analogues, growth homione and its analogues or somatomedins including IGF-1 and IGF-2.<br><br>
Pharmacological Methods<br>
Compounds of formula I may be evaluated in vitro for their efficacy and potency to release grov1H honnone in rat pituitary primary cultures, and such evaluation may be performed as described below.<br>
The isolation of rat pituitary cells is a modification of O. Sartor et al., Endocrinology il£, 1985, pp. 952-957. Male albino Sprague-Dawley rats (250 +/- 25 grams) were purchased from Mollegaard, Lille Skensved, Denmark. The rats were housed in group cages (four animals/cage) and placed in rooms with 12 hour light cycle. The room temperature varied from 19-24°C and the humidity from 30 - 60%.<br>
The rats were decapitated and the pituitaries dissected. The neurointermediate lobes were removed and the remaining tissue was immediately placed in icecold isolation buffer (Gey's medium (Gibco 041-04030) supplemented with 0.25% D-glucose, 2% non-essential amino acids (Gibco 043-01140) and 1% bovine serum albumine (BSA) (Sigma A-4503)). The tissue was cut into small pieces and transferred to isolation buffer supplemented with 3.8 mg/mi of trypsin (Worthington #3707 TRL-3) and 330 mg/ml of DNase (Sigma D-4527). This mixture was incubated at 70 rotations/min for 35 min at 37°C in a 95/5% atmosphere of O2/CO2. The tissue was then washed three times in the above buffer. Using a standard pasteur pipette, the tissue was then aspirated into single cells. After dispersion, cells were filtered through a nylon filter (160 mm) to remove undigested tissue. The cell suspension was washed 3 times with isolation buffer supplemented with trypsin inhibitor (0.75 mg/ml, Worthington #2829) and finally resu-spended in culture medium; DMEM (Gibco 041-01965) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (Sigma H-3375), 4 mM glutamine (Gibco 043-05030H), 0.075% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma S-8875), 0.1% non-essential amino acid, 2.5% fetal calf serum (PCS, Gibco 011-06290), 3% horse serum (Gibco 034-06050), 10% fresh rat serum, 1 nM T3 (Sigma T-2752) and 40 mg/l dexamethasone (Sigma D-4902) pH 7.3, to a density of 2 x 105 cells'/ml. The cells were seeded into microtiter plates (Nunc, Denmark), 200 ml/well, and cultured for 3 days at 37°^'C and 8% CO2.<br><br>
Compound testing<br>
After culturing, the cells were washed twice with stimulation buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco 041-04020) supplemented with 1% BSA (Sigma A-4503), 0.25% D-glucose (Sigma G-5250) and 25 mM HEPES (Sigma H-3375) pH 7.3) and preincubated for 1 hour at 37'C. The buffer was exchanged with 90 ml stimulation buffer (37°C). Ten ml test compound solution was added and the plates were incubated for 15 min at 37°Cand 5% CO2. The medium was decanted and analyzed for GH content in an rGH SPA test system.<br>
All compounds were tested in doses ranging from 10 pM to 100 mM, A dose-response relation was constructed using the Hill equation (Fig P, Biosoft). The efficacy (maximal GH released, Enax) was expressed in % of the Emax of GHRP-6. The potency (EC50) was determined as the concentration inducing half maximal stimulation of the GH release.<br>
Compounds of formula I may be evaluated for their metabolic stability using the procedure described below:<br>
Compounds is dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in water. 25 ml of this solution is added to 175 ml of the respective enzyme-solution (resulting in an enzyme:substrate ratio (w/w) of approximately 1:5). The solution is left at 37°C overnight. 10 ml of the various degradation solutions is analyzed against a corresponding zero-sample using flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) with selected ion monitoring of the molecular ion. If the signal has decreased more than 20% compared to the zero-sample, the remainder of the solution is analyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry in order to identify the extent and site(s) of degradation precisely.<br>
Several standard peptides (ACTH 4-10, Angiotensin 1-14 and Glucagon) have been included in the stability tests in order to verify the ability of the various solutions to degrade peptides.<br>
Standard peptides (angiotensin 1-14, ACTH 4-10 and glucagon) were purchased from Sigma, MO, USA)<br><br>
Enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase aminopeptidase M and carboxypeptidase Y and B) were all purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany)<br>
Pancreatic enzyme mix: trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase in 100 mM ammoniumbicarbonate pH 8.0 (all concentrations 0.025 mg/ml).<br>
Carboxypeptidase mix: carboxypeptidase Y and B in 50 mM ammoniumacetate pH 4.5 (all concentrations 0.025 mg/ml).<br>
Aminopeptidase M solution: aminopeptidase M (0.025 mg/ml) in 100 mM ammoniumbicarbonate pH 8.0<br>
Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using two different mass spectrometers. A Sciex API III triple quadrupoie LC-MS instrument (Sciex instruments, Thornhill, Ontario) equipped with an electrospray ion-source and a Bio-Ion 20 time-of-flight Plasma Desorption instrument (Bio-Ion Nordic AB, Uppsala, Sweden).<br>
Quantification of the compounds (before and after degradation) was done on the API III instrument using single ion monitoring of the molecular ion in question with flow injection of the analyte. The liquid flow (MeOH:water 1:1) of 100 ml/min was controlled by an ABI 140B HPLC unit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Divisions, Foster City, CA). The instrument parameters were set to standard operation conditions, and SIM monitoring was performed using the most intense molecular ion (in most cases this corresponded to the doubly charged molecular ion).<br>
Identification of degradation products furthermore involved the use of plasma desorption mass spectrometry (PDMS) with sample application on nitrocellulose coated targets and standard instrumental settings. The accuracy of the hereby determined masses is generally better than 0.1%.<br>
Separation and isolation of degradation products was done using a HY-TACH C-18 reverse phase 4.6x105 mm HPLC column (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, CA) with a standard acetonitril: TFA separation gradient. The HPLC system used was HP1090M (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, CA).<br><br><br>
+: Stable (less than 20% decrease in SIM signal after 24 h in degradation solution) -: Unstable (more than 20% decrease in SIM signal after 24 h in degradation solution)<br>
Any novel feature or combination of features described herein is considered essential to this invention.<br><br>
