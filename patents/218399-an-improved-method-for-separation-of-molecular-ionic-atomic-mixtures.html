				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved method of separation of molecular/atomic/ionic mixtures using a judicious combination of both "Levitation" and Blow Torch  effects. Molecular mixtures are mixtures having more than one type of molecule. Atomic mixtures are mixtures having more than one type of atom. Ionic mixtures are mixtures, which contain more than one type of ion.<br>
The separation process can be used as an isolated process or in combination with another process, such as, for example catalysis.<br>
Background information and classification of methods:<br>
Mixtures of atoms or molecules which exist in nature often need to be separated for industrial and other purposes. In Biology, protein isolation is important and necessary to the study of its properties. Separation of mixtures of molecules or atoms or ions can be achieved by a number of processes. Distillation, chromatography, adsorption, membrane-based separation and crystallization are some of the conventional methods employed for separation[References 1-20]. All these methods can be classified under two types as follows:<br>
(i)       Equilibrium based methods; and<br>
(ii)      Kinetic based methods. For example, in one of the standard equilibrium based methods when a particular pressure is given to the components of mixtures, one of the component of the mixture adsorbs/absorbs while the other does not for the same pressure thus the components get separated.<br>
Kinetic based methods utilize the fact that transport properties (usually self diffusivity or transport diffusivity) of the two components are different.<br>
Separation is of great commercial importance. For example, crude oil needs to be separated into different streams each containing hydrocarbons of different sizes, Câ€ž(l 
 <br>
The economic or financial cost can be very large, when the separation methods with lower efficiency are used, since these methods are used on millions of tons of mixturra every year.<br>
In the known methods of aspiration, (References 1-12), thore exist seva:al drawbacks. For example, distillation is highly energy intensive, relatively unsafe and expensive. In Icnown membrane-based separations, diffusion is sometimes slow and a high degree of separation is not often obtained. The efficiency of separation achieved by any method may be quantified by the "sqiaration factor" (also known as "separation power") defined as:<br>
a   =    (mole ratio of A/B in extract) / (mole ratio of A/B in raffinale)<br><br><br>
0)<br>
where c is the mrasure of the composition soch as mole fraction, concentration in moles or mass per unit volume, a and b are the two components of the mixture to be separated and 1 and 2 are the two product streams alter the separation. Extract is enriched with one of the two components while raffinate is enriched with the other components. The separation factor obtained depends on the method and varies over a wide range for diffraent processes. Maay of these methods, (Referaices 1-20), are "passive", in the sense that the separation occurs because of the difference in the transport properties in the case of kinetic-based separation methods. These are fi"equently slow due to low transport coefficient of the components and therefore expensive. In an adsorption-desorption equilibrium-based separation methods difficulties associated with complete evacuation during desorption often leads to degradation in the degree of separation. In separation by commonly used methods such as distillation the energy cost is very high. One set of metiiods that is of relevance here is the separation of hydrocarbon mixtures using zeolites. These are extensively used in petrochemical refineries. In other existing "active" separation processes such as those driven by an external field or gradient, the driving force acts on both the components in the same way or direction, which leads, at best, to a r^sonable but not excellent separation.<br><br>
The purpose of this invention is to present an alternate approach in which the two components are driven in opposite directions. By doing so, we achieve a very high degree of separation which is indicated by the high separation factors obtained in this invention. The method is based on two principles, namely, the so-called levitation effect[Reference 21] and the blow-torch efFect[Reference 22], The invention will be illustrated by passing the mixture to be separated through a column of zeolites under ai^opriate conditions.<br>
Zeolites are porous solids made up of Al, Si, O and consist of interconnected network Si04 and AIO4 tetrahedra. They also have small and medium sized interconnected pores of typical dimensions 1-20A which can accommodate molecules such as hydrocarbons. In the usual separation methods, the molecular sieving property of the zeoUtes is commonly used in the separation of mixtures where molecules of different sizes diffuse or pass through at different rates. The rates are detenuined by the self diffiisivities of the different molecules. Bigger molecules typically have lower self diffiisivities.<br>
Levitation effectj;efers to the anomaly in self (fiffusivity diat has been observed in porous soUds [Reference 21]. Self diffiisivity Z) exhibits a sur|nising dependence on the size of the guest species, Ogg. This could be usually the Lenoaid-Jones guest-guest interaction parameter in molecular simulations. At small Ogg, D is linearly propOTtionai to 1/c^gg, as expected. This is the linear regime. At larger Cgg, D shows a pronounced peak which is referred to as the anomalous or the levitating regime (see Fig.l) [Reference 21],   This behavior is observed in all types of porous solids<br>
r=^^.^	(2)<br>
irrespective of the geometrical and topological details of the pore network [Reference 23]. A toneosionless parameter [Reference 21] called the levitation parameter may be defined. Here Ow is the window diameter and Ogh is the guest-host Lennard-Jones interaction parameter. The anomalous re^me is seen when 7 is close to unity and the linear regime for values of y much less than 1. The maximum in self diflusivity has its origm. in the fortuitous cancellation of the dispersion forces on the guest or diffijsant due to the host. Such an xmexpected cancellation of forces arising from the host porous mediimi occm^ when the size of the guest is comparable to the void size<br><br>
(see Figure 2). The unexpected maximum in i) is due to this (see Figure 2) when the size of the guest is comparable to the void size. Frictional forces on the guest is then lowest and this results in an increase in D. Under these conditions, it is seen that the potential energy landscape is rather flat with only smaller undulations [Reference 24], The magnitude of the peak in Z) is dependent on the temperature and degree of disorder in the void network [References 25, 26]. Generally, in most guest-host systems y is small and hence they lie in the linear regime. In order to realize the anomalous regime, a careful choice of the host system for a given guest or mixture is therefore necessary.<br>
Zeolites possess spatial and chonical inhomogoieities. The latto: is seoi in the presence of chemisoiption and chemically reactive sites within the zeolites. This is responsible for the catalytic properties of zeolites. Whenever reactions take place within zeolites, heat can be released or absorbed. Since zeolites are poor thermal conductors, this can lead to local hot or cold spots. The principle which deals with the effect of such hot regions on self diffiisivity is the Landauer blow torch effect. The effect of inhomogenous temperature was originally treated by Landuaer [Reference 22] which now goes by the name the "blow torch" effect. Briefly, he showed that introduction of a hot spot in between a lower lying minimum and barrier maximum of a bistable potential can raise the population of the higher lying minimum relative to the lower lying minimum over and above that given by the Bothmann factor (see below). Since die blowtorch effect is rather counter intuitive, following Landauer [Reference 22], we illustrate the effect of a nonuniform temperature bath on the relative populations of competing local energy minima for a bistable potential f/(x). Consider the motion of an ovwdamped particle in the potential f/(x) shown by the curve ABCD in Figure 3, subject to an uniform temperature To along the coordinate. Then, the probability of finding a particle at x is P(x) "-exp(-U(x)/ksTo). Clearly, the probability at A is higher tiian tiiat at O. Now consider rmsing the temperature of the region BC to Th, Then P(x) -exp(-U(x) )/kBT^ in BC is clearly much smaller tiian the probability Pix) at lower troiperatuje T = la. Now let us consider a situation when only P(x) is given and one wishes to find the "effective potential" that determines this P(x). Clearly, one can invert the original expression for P(x) and regard the "potential" to be given by U(x)/kBT= -lnP(x). Thus, on raising the temperature to Tb, the decrease mP (x) va. BC, implies ln(P(x) is flatter in BC.    This is equivalent to<br><br>
mo(^fying ihe "potential" to a flatter curve BC. Since the probability P(x) is unaffected in other regions, the curve outside the region BC will be the same except that the curve CD would start at C" and end at Z)" such that U(XQ) - U(XD) = 0(xc-) -U(XD-). Thus, the minimum at D is brought down relative to A. Consequently, the probability at XD. P(XD) is higher than that at the lower minimum XA. Recently, kinetic aspects have been studied [Reference 27] for an idealized situation. More recently, a more practical realization of the blow torch effect has been demonstrated in the case of zeolite [Reference 28],<br>
Thus, both the levitation and blow torch effects lead to enhanced diffusivity. Specifically, controlling and chaimelising the direction along wWch two or more components diffuse, can achieve significant or drastic improvement of the separation factors. A judicious combination of these two effects therefore can drive different components in opposite directions. This could be of cot^derable significance to the area of separation of mixtures. In the process a new conceptual basis for separation of mixtures has been introduced which helps to realize separation factors (see below) that are quantitatively superior by several orders of magnitude to the existing methods. Since both the blow torch and levitation effect can be realized in zeolites, we illustrate their combined effect on the separation of a mixture of gases confined to zeolites. The length of the separation column over which the mixture traverses is reduced significantiy from macro to microscopic dimensions in the case of porous host such as zeolite. This is detnomtrated using Monte Carlo simulations for (i) Lennard-Jones mixtures and (ii) Ne-Ar mixture.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is the primary object of the invention to provide an improved method whereby a combination of levitation and blowtorch effect is used together for the separation of molecular/atomic/ionic mixtures.<br>
It is also another object of the invention to provide an improved method for the separation of molecular/atomic/ionic mixtures, which is economical in process and efficient in operation and a substitute for traditional method of equilibrium and kinetic based methods.<br><br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an improved method with lower energy cost and higher efficiency.<br>
Further objects of the invention will be clear from the following desoiption:<br>

In the^present inventioii, an attempt has been made to study the combined influoice of both the blow torch and levitation effects on the separation process of mixtures within porous zeolites. The physical system that is simulated consists of a mixture of gases confined to NaCaA zeoUte with a composition A"ajjCfl32&gt;SiW/fÂ»tfOjÂ« (Si/Al = 1.0) crystallizing into a cubic structure (space group Fm3c) with a lattice parameter a=24.55 A [Reference 29]. Large (~11.4A dia) cages (the supercages) are interconnected in an octahedral fashicm to 6 other suporcagra via 8-ring windows of significantly narrower diameter (=4.5 A). The distance between two planes of 8-ring windows is given by half of the latdcc parameter dâ€ž=a/2=12.275A. Following our earlier work [Reference 28], we assume that a species arriving at a heterogeneous reaction site, typically located between the window and the cage (see Rg. 4) releases an amount of heat q creating a local hot zone. For the purpose of modeling, the reaction is mimicked by introducing a hot zone at ^ipropriate locations. The presence of a hot zone aids the molecules to surmount a barrier more easily. Previous studies have shown [Reference 21] that the average potential energy (PE) landscape for particles in linear (y much less than 1) and anomalous (Y=1) regimes are substantially different. For the linear regime, the potential energy maximum and minimimi are located respectively at the bottleneck (8-ring window) and the cage. For the anomalous regime, they are located at the cage and the botdeneck respectively (see Figure 4) [Reference 21].<br>
We describe the zeolite and mixture of gases intCTacting via the Lennard-Jones potential<br>
^(r)=4e[(a/r)   -(c/r)  ],   The total interaction energy of the system consists of<br>
the<br>
guest-guest, ^^r^and guest-zeolite ^g^r) terms:<br>
N N	N Nz<br>
(p=S I^+I Z^	(3)<br>
i=li=l      i=lj=l<br>
where N and Nz are the numba: of guest and zeolite atoms respectively. A modified Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm in the canonical ensemble [Reference 30] has been<br><br>
employed. Calculations have been carried out at a temperature of To = 140K with temperature of the hot spot, Tb =420K. Two sets of simulations have been carried out, Uie first (set A) relating to idealized particles to illustrate the basic effect, and the second (set B) on a realistic mixture of neon-argon. Both are modeled in terms of their Leonard-Jones potential parameters. A 1:1 mixture with a total of 256 particles corresponding to a concentration of C=l per cage (of either type chosen randomly), diffiising with zeolite NaCaA has been simulated. The system consists of 2 x 2 x 8 unit cells of zeolite Y each unit cell containing 8 cages (4= 8 x a = 196.4A), Periodic boundary conditions are imposed along the x-and y- directions. Along the z-direction repulsive (l/r*^) walls are placed. For the set A itself, two simulations LR and AR defined by their respective parameters have been carried out. The mixture LR consisting of particles with agg = 2.05A, and 2.38A, and mixture AR with Ogg = 2.38A and 3.34A. For mixture LR both the components He in the linear regime (Figure 2). For mixtures AR, one of the two components, viz., Ogg = 3.34A lies in the anomalous or levitating regime (Figure 2). The Lennard-Jones interaction parameter agg = 0.997729 kJ/mol for all the guests. For the set B simulations of neon-argon mixture, the parameters are [Reference 31]: CTNe-Ne " 2.72 A ENO-NO = 0.3908 kJ/mol, OAI^AT = 3.4lA eA^Ar = 0.9977 kj/mol. Initially a single particle of either type is placed in each cage corresponding to the equiUbrium distribution in the absence of blow torch. Tliere are two cages along each of x-, y - and z- directions per unit cell. A hot spot is placed at distances of 1.278A to the left of the 8-ring window planes along the z-direction (see Figure 4). Simulations are of 6 x 10^ MC steps which includes an initial period of 5 x 10^ MC steps required for reaching a steady state. AvCTage properties are calculated over 1 x 10^ MC steps.<br>
We first discuss the results of LR mixture of set A (with Ogg = 2.05 and 2.38A). Figure 5 shows the density profile along the z-direction, Â«, (z) for i = 1,2 along with the logarithm of the ratio ni(z) / 02(2) along the z-direction. Clearly, there is hardly any separation of the two components. The separation factor [Reference 20] is of the order of unity. In contrast, the plots of Â«/ (z) for i = 1,2 and /n(Â«i(z) / niiz)) for the mixture AR (with (Jgg = 2.38 and 3.34A) show a high degree of sQjaration (Fig. 6). The component corresponding to Ogg = 2.38A is driven to the right and accumulates at one end while the other component wth Ogg = 3.34A is driven to the ieft. At one<br><br>
extreme, the ratio Â«i(z)/Â«2{z) is 72.61, while at the other extreme a value of 0.01329 is obtmned. This corresponds to a high separation factor [Reference 20] a= 5463.<br>
Hereinafter, the applicability of method to the separation of a mixture of real gases, namely, Ne-Ar rare gas mixture using zeolite NaCaA as the porous host is demonstrated. A plot of nAr (z), nNe(z) and their ratio ln(niJiz) I nNo(z)) as a function z is shown in Fig.7. Clearly, there is an excellent separation of the two components. At the left end, the ratio HM (Z) / Â«Ne(z) is 301.81 while at the right extreme it is 0.02255. The resulting separation factor is 1.338 xlO**. Further, use of even a few more unit cells of zeolite can enhance the sqiaration factor by several orders of magnitude.<br>
It is clear from Figures 6 and 7, that a straight line fit to the plot of /n(Â«i(/)) versus / {or /n(nAr(0 "" "NOCO) versus I) provides a good approximation.   Therefore, that the<br>
Â«! / n 2  = exp   (- / / ;^ + C )	^4)<br>
ratio n\{l) I mil) (or nx^l) I Â«Ne (0) decreases in an exponential way which can be fitted to:<br>
where / is the length of the separation column and kasi.6 C are constants. U = 22.823A (mixtiire AR) and 20.6698A (Ne-Ar) and C = 4.2851 (mixture AR) and 5. 710 (Ne-Ar mixture). Hae we have fixed tiie magnitude of Â«i/nj(z = 0) to e^. From this it is easy to estimate that on doubling the length of the zeolite column from its present value Iz = 196.4A, the ratio is 1.685 ^ 10 * ** at the right extieme. It follows from equation 4 that the separation factor [Reference 20] for a separation column of length /z may be written<br>
m/ni(z = U)	, , ,,v   ,ra = â€”-)â€”-7 = exp(-i/t)-(5) m I m(z = 0)<br>
The resulting value for a on doubling the column length is 1.79 &gt;Â« 10* which is more than two orders of m^nitude improvement over the value 1.338 x 10**. In conventional methods of separation, the separation factor at best varies linearly vnih tiie length of the column [Reference 20]. The present metiiod is therefore enable of providing better than parts per billion purity with columns of microscopic dimensions.<br><br>
The eHiciency of separation is also expected to be several orders of magnitude better than obtained from conventional methods,<br>
These results can be understood by considering the nature of the potential energy landscape for particles in the linear and anomalous regimes (Figure 4), and the poaitionof the hot spots. Table 1 liststtie values of 7 for the components of the LR, AR and Ne-Ar mixtures. In the case of LR mixture, both components fall in the linear regime as their 7 values are much less than unity. For these particles, the maxima in the potential energy landscape are at the windows (zn = ndw where n is an int^er) just to the right ofthe hot spots (see Fig. 4a). Thus, the effect ofthe hotpot is to increase the escape rate over the barrier located to the right of the hot spot. Stationary populations of both species in the presence of hot spots is soon established which is nearly uniform. In contrast, for the AR mixture or Ne-Ar mixture (Table 1), while one component lies in the linear regime ( 7 much less than unity), the other component is in the anamolous regime with 7 --1. For the latter, the potential maxima are located at the cages (zn = (2n + 1) dw/2,n an integer) which are immediately to the left of the hot spot. Thus, the hot spot has the effect of driving these particles to the left, while the other component is driven to the right. Since, the hot spots are located at periodic positions, the eventual effect is to accumulate particlra of eada type at tiie left and right extremes respectively.<br>
Note that the present method crucially dqwnds on the interplay of two factors, namely, the levitation and blow torch effects. It is ^jpUcable to mixtures where the two components differ in size. The realization of the levitation effect requires a careful choice of the porous host [Reference 32], which depends on a few pertinent points. Previous studies show that the enhancement of Z) within the anomalous regime extends over a reasonably large range of Ogg [Reference 25]. This provides considerable flexibility in the choice of the host system over which the anomalous regime can be realized. There exist in nature a number of known porous solids [Reference 33] with a wide variation in pore dimensions, Further, it is also possible to vary the pore dimensions of these solids through, for instance, substitution of framework ions. Substitution of Si by Al or Si by P or Al by Ti can alter the pore dimensions [Reference 34]. Table 2 illustrates the choice ofthe zeolite as the host for a few realistic mixtures [Reference 33]. For the hydrocarbon mixture consisting of n-<br><br>
hexane, n-butane and isopentane, it is seen that isopentane alone has a y value closer to unity and therefore the appUcalioii of the pTKent method to this mixture, isopentane alone would be driven to the left while the other two would be driven to the right. Thus it is possible to separate out isopentane from other components. The other binary mixture of CCI4 and CF4 the component with y value closer to unity would be driven to left and the other component with 7 much less than 1 will be driven to the right.<br>
It is also practically possible to realize the hot spots necessary to drive the different components of the mixture. We consider hydrocarbons and other guest species sorbed within zeolite NaX. Table 3 lists isosteric heat of sorption (AH^^) of some linear alkanes, Xe and water within faujasites [Reference 33]. We have also listed the mean heat capacities (Cm) of guest-zeolite systems [Reference 33]. From these data, the maximum increase in A/can be estimated from A7"= T\,~To = AHadr/Cm which is in the range 820 K to 1300 K. Changes in temperature ofthis magnitude can be achieved if for example, a specific chemical group, which may be any group with whose mediation hot/cold spot is realized, can be attached to the oxygen of the zeolite framework at the appropriate place at the place where the hot spot is desired. The chemical group can tiien be vibrationally excited by exposing it to appropriate radiation. Thermal de-excitation of the excited group would provide constant heat source. The system would soon reach a steady state non-equilibrium state with a temperature gradient. The location of the chemical group has to be asymmetric with respect to the barrier, i.e. placed only on one side of the barrier or any place before or after an energy barrier that lies in the path of diffusion. The "barrier" here refers to the free energy barrier to diffusion path.<br>
In the method of the present invention, additional additives are introduced to realize the blow torch effect. The additional additives can be any substance through which hot or cold spot is realized. For example, molecular oxygen which realizes heat on adsorption within the zeolite or any othÂ«: such substance.<br>
The utility of the invention for separation of mixtures in the context of zeolites [Reference 35] has been successfiilly demonstrated. At a Jundamental level, this method of separation is different fmm conventional methods: the combined result of the two effects is to force the components of the mixture in opposite directions leading to high degree of separation. In contrast traditional methods of separation drive both<br><br>
the components in the same direction but at diffaent rates. For example, in distillation, the v^our pressure of both components increase on heating. Or, and increase in concentration gradient may lead to higha- self-diffusivities of both the species. Consequently, the separation factor is limited by the differential rate of the various components. More importantly at the practical level, the present method achieves sq&gt;aiation at microscopic length scales as compared to macroscopic loigth scales in conventional methods since the basic effects giving raise to the separation operate at nano length scales.<br>
The energy cost associated with the present method is expected to be significantly lower than in the traditional methods. The hot spot required in the present method will add to the energy cost. However the nano lengths at which separation is achieved impUes that the number of hot spots to be maintained are only few. Most of the energy cost in conventional methods of separation is due higher temperatures that need to be maintained over long columns. In contrast, the energy saved in the present method is large (=CpA T pa mole).<br>
As an illustration of the effiectiveness of the above method, consider the conventional method of sqjaration of hydrocarbon using zeolites [Referaice 20]. Here, the separation factor is controlled by geometrical features such as size and shape of the molecules. However, if one were to follow our method, one should attempt to make an appropriate choice of the zeoUte for use of the levitation effect along with suitably engineer hot spots that can be used to obtain orders of ms^tude improvement in separation of hydrocarbons.<br>
The method of the present invention can be applied to separation of various mixtures such as hydrocarbons, biological and ionic mixtures, mixtures of gaseous substances and mixture of proteins. The hydrocarbons for example may be a mixture of linear and branched hydrocarbons such as neopentane and n-pentane or a mixture of benzene, p-xylene, o-xylene. Mixtures of gaseous substances can be for example Ne-Ar mixture, N2+O2 mixture.<br>
While the present exercise illustrates the combined use of blow torch and levitation effect in the context of separation of mixturra, the concqrt is clearly more general and should find application in several situations, includmg biological processes. The<br><br>
present study suggests a possible mechanism by which ions diffusing across bio-membranes can do so with minimum activation energy. Further the levitation effect suggests that if the channel dimension through which the ions difiuse is about the size of the ion, then the activation energy for diffusion is lowest [Reference 25]. Finally, the present investigation provides possibilities for the design of drug delivery systems, where an encapsulated drug may be released at the affected part through the release of heat, which can be achieved through externally, provided radiation. Heat released will enhance the diffiisivity leading to dispersal of the drug.<br>
