				<td>METHOD OF PURIFYING F1SCHER-TROPSCH DERIVED WATER Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the purification of water produced during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis for which synthesis a variety of carbonaceous materials are used as feedstock.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
The applicant is aware of processes for the synthesis of water from a carbonaceous feedstock, such as natural gas and coal, which processes also produce hydrocarbons.<br>
One such process is the Fischer-Tropsch process of which the largest product is water and, to a lesser extent, hydrocarbons including olefins, paraffins, waxes, and oxygenates. There are numerous references to this process such as, for example on pages 265 to 278 of Technology of the Fischer-Tropsch process" by Mark Dry, Catal. Rev. Sci.Eng., Volume 23 (1&amp;2), 1981.<br>
The products from the Fischer-Tropsch process may be processed further, for example by hydroprocessing, to produce products including synthetic crude oil, olefins, solvents, lubricating, industrial or medicinal oil, waxy hydrocarbons, nitrogen and oxygen containing compounds, motor gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and kerosene. Lubricating oil includes automotive, jet, turbine and metal working oils. Industrial oil includes well drilling fluids, agricultural oils and heat transfer fluids.<br>
In certain areas where carbonaceous feedstocks are to be found, water is in short supply and a relatively costly commodity. Also, environmental concerns prevent the dumping of polluted water derived from the Fischer-Tropsch process into natural water ways and the sea thereby presenting a case for the production and recovery of useable water at the source of the carbonaceous feedstocks.<br>
The carbonaceous feedstocks typically include coal and natural gas that are converted to hydrocarbons, water and carbon dioxide during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Naturally, other carbonaceous feedstocks such as, for example, methane hydrates found in marine deposits, can also be used.<br>
Before the water produced during the Fischer-Tropsch process is purified in accordance with the present invention, it is typically subjected to preliminary separation aimed at isolating a water-enriched stream from the Fischer-Tropsch products.<br>
The preliminary separation process includes condensing the gaseous product from the Fischer-Tropsch reactor and separating it in a typical three-phase separator. The three streams exiting the separator are: a tail gas, a hydrocarbon condensate including mainly hydrocarbons in the C5 to C20 range and a reaction water stream containing dissolved oxygenated hydrocarbons, and suspended hydrocarbons.<br>
The reaction water stream is then separated using a coalescer that separates the reaction water stream into a hydrocarbon suspension and a water-rich stream.<br>
The coalescer is capable of removing hydrocarbons from the reaction water stream to a concentration of between 10 ppm and 1000 ppm, typically 50 ppm.<br>
The water-enriched stream thus obtained forms the feedstock for the method according to the present invention and will be denoted in this specification by the term "Fischer-Tropsch reaction water".<br>
The composition of the water-enriched stream or reaction water is largely dependent on the catalyst metal used in the Fischer-Tropsch reactor and the reaction conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure) employed. The Fischer-Tropsch reaction water can contain oxygenated hydrocarbons including aliphatic, aromatic and cyclic alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and acids, and to a lesser extent aliphatic, aromatic and cyclic hydrocarbons such as olefins and paraffins.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch reaction water may also contain small quantities of inorganic compounds including metals from the Fischer-Tropsch reactor, as well as nitrogen and sulphur containing species that originate from the feedstock.<br>
The influence of the type of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis used on the quality of Fischer-Tropsch reaction water is illustrated in typical organic analysis (Table 1) of Fischer-Tropsch reaction water generated from three different synthesis operating modes, namely:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Table 1:        Typical Organic Composition of Fischer-Tropsch reaction water from Different Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Operating Modes<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It is evident from the typical analyses of Fischer-Tropsch reaction waters of different origin (Table 1) that these waters, in particular HT Fischer-Tropsch reaction water, contain relatively high concentrations of organic compounds, and direct application or disposal of these waters is generally not feasible without further treatment to remove undesirable constituents. The degree of treatment of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction water depends largely on the intended application, and it is possible to produce a wide range of water qualities ranging from boiler feed water to partially treated water which may be suitable for discharge to the environment.<br>
It is also possible to co-treat Fischer-Tropsch reaction water with other typical process waste water as well as rain water.<br>
The water purification processes described in this invention may, after making minor adaptations, also be used for the processing of aqueous streams derived from generic synthesis gas conversion processes using metallic catalysts similar to the catalysts used during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the production of purified water from Fischer-Tropsch reaction water, which process includes at least the steps of:<br>
a)	a primary treatment stage comprising an equilibrium staged separation process having at least one stage for removing at least a fraction of non-acid oxygenated hydrocarbons from the Fischer-Tropsch reaction water to produce a primary water enriched stream;<br>
b)	a secondary treatment stage comprising biological treatment for removing at least a fraction of acidic oxygenated hydrocarbons from at least a portion of the primary water enriched stream to produce a secondary water enriched stream; and<br>
c)	a tertiary treatment stage comprising solid-liquid separation for removing at least some solids from at least a portion of the secondary water enriched stream.<br>
The term "purified water" is to be interpreted as meaning an aqueous stream having a COD of between 20 and 500 mg/l, a pH of between 6,0 and 9,0, a suspended solids content of less than 250 mg/l and a total dissolved solids content of less than 600 mg/l.<br>
The non-acid oxygenated hydrocarbons are typically comprised of compounds selected from the group including: alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, more specifically from the group including: acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, acetone, methyl-propyl-ketone, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, and heptanol.<br>
The acidic oxygenated hydrocarbons are typically selected from the group including: formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, and octanoic acid.<br>
A number of equilibrium staged separation processes are suitable for use in the primary treatment stage. Such processes may include conventional distillation processes typically used in the refining and petrochemical industry as well as solvent extraction using either conventional liquid solvents or liquefied gases.<br>
When distillation is used as the primary treatment stage, the bulk of the non-acid oxygenated hydrocarbons contained in the Rscher-Tropsch reaction water are removed, leaving predominantly mono-carboxylic acids (e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid) and optionally trace quantities of non-acid compounds. As a result of the presence of organic acids, the primary water enriched stream is known as Fischer-Tropsch acid water.<br>
The overheads from distillation may be recovered and worked-up to products, or may be used for fuel or as an energy source.<br>
The primary treatment stage may include degassing of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction water before further processing to remove compounds having a very low boiling point and dissolved gases from the Rscher-Tropsch reaction water.<br>
Typically, Fischer-Tropsch reaction water originating from HTFT iron catalyst processes which water has undergone primary treatment has limited application due to the relatively high concentrations (&gt; 1% by mass) of organic acids remaining in the Fischer-Tropsch acid water, and further treatment of the water is required. In contrast, Fischer-Tropsch reaction water originating from cobalt-based LTFT processes which water has undergone primary treatment contains significantly lower organic acid concentrations (
The biological treatment may include anaerobic treatment or aerobic treatment or a combination of anaerobic and aerobic treatment. The anaerobic and/ or aerobic treatment methods may be the same as are conventionally used for domestic and industrial wastewater treatment.<br>
The anaerobic and/ or aerobic treatment may include adding nutrients in the form of nitrogen (e.g. urea, ammonia or ammonium salts) and phosphorus (e.g. phosphate salts) containing compounds to accelerate microbiological degradation of the organic constituents. In addition, pH control using alkali salts such as lime, caustic and soda ash may be required due to the acidity of the water.<br>
Fischer-Tropsch acid waters originating from both HTFT and LTFT processes lend themselves to anaerobic digestion since they contain mainly readily digestible short-chain mono-carboxyiic acids such as acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids. Anaerobic technologies that have been successfully evaluated include Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) processes, Fixed Bed systems, Fluidized Bed reactors, Stirred Tank reactors, Membrane Bioreactors, and Baffled reactors.<br>
Apart from a water-rich stream, namely the secondary water enriched stream, anaerobic digestion typically yields methane, carbon dioxide and sludge as byproducts.<br>
The methane may be released to the environment via an acceptable system or, preferably, recovered. Recovered methane may be used as a fuel or energy source or returned for reforming (where natural gas is used as a feedstock for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process) or it may be chemically or biologically converted to products.<br>
The sludge may be incinerated, used as land fill or as a fertiliser or soil conditioner.<br>
A wide range of technologies may be used in the aerobic treatment of the water originating from step a). Such technologies may be selected from the group including: Activated Sludge processes, High-rate Compact Reactors, Biological Aerated   Filters,   Trickling   filters,   Rotating   Biological   Contacters,   Membrane<br>
Bioreactors, and Fluidised Bed reactors. The aerobic production of Single Cell Protein (SCP) has also been successfully developed.<br>
Apart from a water-rich stream, namely the secondary water enriched stream, aerobic treatment typically yields carbon dioxide and sludge as byproducts. The carbon dioxide may be released to the environment. The sludge may be incinerated, used as land fill, fertilizer, soil conditioner or as a source of SCP.<br>
Removal of the majority of the organic material from Fischer-Tropsch acid waters originating from LTFT processes may be undertaken in a single biological treatment step.<br>
Removal of the majority of the organic material from acid waters originating from HTFT processes may require a bulk organic carbon removal step (anaerobic digestion) followed by a second biological polishing step (aerobic digestion) to remove residual organic material (see also Example 2 below).<br>
The tertiary treatment stage may be aimed at removing suspended solids from the secondary water-enriched stream produced during biological treatment.<br>
Suspended solid removal may be achieved by methods selected from the group including: sand filtration, membrane separation (e.g. micro- or ultrafiltration), sedimentation (with or without the use of flocculants), dissolved air flotation (with or without the use of flocculants) and centrifugation.<br>
Local discharge standards or the intended application will dictate the required level and type of tertiary treatment.<br>
Applications for the purified water produced by the method described above may include its use as cooling water, irrigation water or general process water.<br>
The purified water typically has the following characteristics:<br>

The Fischer-Tropsch reaction which generates the Fischer-Tropsch reaction water may also produce other Fischer-Tropsch products. These Fischer-Tropsch products may be processed further, for example by hydroprocessing, to produce products including synthetic crude oil, olefins, solvents, lubricating, industrial or medicinal oil, waxy hydrocarbons, nitrogen and oxygen containing compounds, motor gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and kerosene. Lubricating oil includes automotive, jet, turbine and metal working oils. Industrial oil includes well drilling fluids, agricultural oils and heat transfer fluids.<br>

a)	a primary treatment stage including an equilibrium staged separation process<br>
having at least one stage for removing at least a fraction of non-acid<br>

a primary water enriched stream;<br>

the primary water enriched stream to produce a secondary water enriched<br>
stream;<br>
c)	a tertiary treatment stage comprising solid-liquid separation for removing at<br>
least some solids from least a portion of the secondary water enriched stream<br>
to produce a tertiary water enriched stream; and<br>
d)	a final treatment stage comprising a dissolved salt and organic removal stage<br>
for removing at least some dissolved salts and organic constituents from at<br>
least a portion of the tertiary water enriched stream.<br>
The term "highly purified water" is to be interpreted as meaning an aqueous stream having a COD of less than 50 mg/l, a pH of between 6,0 and 9,0, a suspended solids content of less than 50 mg/l and a total dissolved solids content of less than 100 mg/l.<br>
The non-acid oxygenated hydrocarbons are typically comprised of compounds selected from the group including: alcohols, ketones and aldehydes, more specifically from the group including: acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, acetone, methyl-propyi-ketone, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, and heptanol.<br>

Dissolved salts, originating from secondary treatment (i.e. pH control chemicals, nutrient addition) and/or from the co-treatment of other process effluents, can be further reduced by methods selected from the group including: ion exchange, reverse osmosis, nano-filtration and chemical precipitation processes including hot and cold lime softening.<br>
Applications for the highly purified water produced by the method described above may include its use as boiler feed water and drinking water.<br>
The highly purified water typically has the following characteristics:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Advantages inherent in the purified and highly purified water produced according to the present invention are that the water will contain only a small amount of dissolved solids because the Fischer-Tropsch reaction water is essentially a dissolved solids-free stream. The low levels of residual salts in the purified water are a result of controlled addition of chemicals used during the purification process sequence and/or the co-treatment of other dissolved solids containing effluents. The residual salts could include Ca, Mg, Na, K, CI, SO4, HCO3 and CO3 combinations. The low dissolved solids concentrations in Fischer-Tropsch reaction water can simplify and reduce the costs of the purification process.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch reaction which generates the Fischer-Tropsch reaction water may  also  produce other   Fischer-Tropsch   products.     These   Fischer-Tropsch<br>
products may be processed further, for example by hydroprocessing, to produce products including synthetic crude oil, olefins, solvents, lubricating, industrial or medicinal oil, waxy hydrocarbons, nitrogen and oxygen containing compounds, motor gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and kerosene. Lubricating oil includes automotive, jet, turbine and metal working oils. Industrial oil includes well drilling fluids, agricultural oils and heat transfer fluids.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention will now be described by way of the following non-limiting examples with reference to the accompanying drawing.<br>
Figure 1 shows a simplified block diagram of a method according to the present invention including various treatment options.<br>
The Rscher-Tropsch reaction water 12 is fed to a distillation column 14 for primary treatment.<br>
Two streams 16 and 18 exit distillation column 14. Stream 16 contains predominantly organic constituents whilst stream 18 is a primary water enriched stream.<br>
Stream 18 is then subjected to biological treatment. This can take the form of anaerobic treatment 20 and/or aerobic treatment 22. Apart from a secondary water-enriched stream 36, all three biological treatment options 20, or 22 and a combination of 20 and 22 produce sludge 28 and anaerobic treatment 20 in addition produces methane and carbon dioxide 30, whilst aerobic treatment produces carbon dioxide 38.<br>
The next treatment stage involves solid-liquid separation 32 during which solids 34 and purified water 46 are produced.<br>
An additional step involving the removal of dissolved salt and organic constituents 40 that produces concentrate 42 and highly purified water 44 can be performed after solid-liquid separation.<br>
Depending on the final intended use of the purified 46 or highly purified water 44, the minimum water quality requirements are as set out in Table 2 below and the operating conditions of the equipment used in the method as well as suitable treatment options can be selected accordingly.<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1 - Treatment of Fischer-Tropsch reaction water from a cobalt catalyst LTFT process<br>
After separation of by-products, a water enriched stream from an LTFT process was degassed at atmospheric pressure. Free hydrocarbons in the water enriched stream were reduced to 0.01 % (mass %) using a coalescer. The composition of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction water thus obtained is given in Table 1 above.<br>
Primary treatment of the Fischer Tropsch reaction water was undertaken using distillation. Analysis of the Fischer-Tropsch acid water bottoms of the distillation column is detailed in Table 3 below. With the exception of trace quantities of methanol, most other non-acid oxygenated hydrocarbons were removed from the FT reaction water during primary distillation leaving an organic acid enriched or primary<br>
water enriched stream (i.e. 0.074 mass % organic acids) with a pH value of 3.5. The measured Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the primary water enriched stream was in the order of 800 mg 02/I.<br>
The primary water enriched stream was cooled from 70 °C to 35 °C using a plate heat exchanger and fed into an open equalization tank with a Hydraulic Residence Time(HRT)of 8-12h.<br>
The primary water enriched stream underwent activated sludge treatment (aerobic treatment) to remove organic components.<br>
The activated sludge system was operated under the following conditions:<br>
•	pH:7.2 to 7.5<br>
•	Dissolved oxygen concentration in basin: &gt; 2 mg/l<br>
•	Temperature: 33-35°C<br>
•	HRT:±30 h<br>
•	COD loading rate: 0.5 -1 kg O2/m3.d<br>
•	F/M ratio: 0.2 -0.4 kg COD/kg MLSS.d<br>
•	Cell retention time (sludge age): 20 days<br>
•	Feed to recycle ratio: 1 :2.5<br>
•	Nutrients in the form of nitrogen and phosphorous containing compounds were added to sustain the process.<br>
During activated sludge treatment an average organic component removal efficiency of 92 % (± 2 %) was achieved yielding an effluent containing 0.006 % (mass %) residual organic matter and a COD concentration of 64 mg O2/I. A sludge yield of 0.15 kg sludge/kg COD removed was obtained.<br>
Activated sludge treatment yielded a secondary water-enriched stream that was subjected to sand filtration to reduce its SS concentration to 25 mg/l. The TDS of the purified water thus obtained was ca 50 mg/l. The purified water has application as a<br>
both irrigation water and process cooling water. Sludge produced in the process was incinerated.<br>
In order to produce a highly purified water stream, a portion of the purified water from the sand filter was diverted to a cross-flow membrane unit fitted with a 0.2 urn<br>
2<br>
polypropylene microfiltration membrane. A permeate flux rate of 70 - 80 l/m .h was obtained during stable operation of the unit, and the water recovery across the unit varied between 75 - 85 %. The resultant SS and COD concentrations in the permeate from the microfiltration unit were 
The pH of the purified water from the microfiltration unit was adjusted to pH 8.5 using sodium hydroxide, and the purified water was pumped to a reverse osmosis unit fitted with a high rejection sea water polyamide membrane. A permeate flux rate of 15 -25 l/m .h was obtained during stable operation of the unit, and the water recovery across the unit varied between 85 - 90 %. The reverse osmosis unit yielded a highly purified water stream containing COD and TDS concentrations of

Example 2 - Treatment of Fischer-Tropsch reaction water from an iron catalyst HTFT process<br>
After separation of by-products, a water enriched stream from an HTFT process was degassed at atmospheric pressure for a period of 30 mm in an open vessel, frse hydrocarbons in the water enriched stream were reduced to 0.01 % (mass %) using a coalescer. The composition of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction water thus obtained is given in Table 4 below.<br>
Primary treatment of the HT Fischer-Tropsch reaction water was effected using distillation. Analysis of the acid water bottoms from the distillation column is detailed in Table 5 below. It is evident from this analysis that most non-acid components were removed from the FT reaction water during primary distillation leaving an organic acid enriched or primary water enriched stream containing 1.2 % organic acids consisting predominantly of acetic acid. The measured COD of this stream was in the order of 16 000 mg O2/I-<br>
The primary water enriched stream was cooled from 60 °C to 35 °C, and fed into an open equalization tank with a HRT of 8 - 12 h. The primary water enriched stream was fed to a Down-flow Packed Bed (DPB) anaerobic digester containing plastic packing material. Lime (Ca(OH)2) was dosed into the feed to a concentration of 500 mg/l in order to adjust the pH from pH 3 to pH 4.5. Nutrients were also added to sustain the process.<br>
The DPB anaerobic digester was operated under the following conditions:<br>
•	Temperature - 35 to 38 °C<br>
•	pH-6.8-7.0<br>
•	HRT-25-30 h<br>
•	COD loading rate - 12 -16 kg O2/m3.d<br>
•	Feed to recycle ratio -1:4<br>
The COD and SS concentrations of the water enriched stream obtained from anaerobic digestion were ca. 1400 mg O2/I and ca. 500 mg SS/I, respectively. The COD removal across the reactor was in excess of 90 %.<br>
In order to further reduce the COD content, the water enriched stream obtained from anaerobic digestion was further subjected to aerobic treatment in an activated sludge basin.<br>
Additional nutrient and lime dosing was not necessary and activated sludge treatment was conducted under the following conditions:<br>
•	pH: 7.2 to 7.5<br>
•	Dissolved oxygen concentration in basin : ± 2 mg/l<br>
•	Temperature: 33 - 35 °C<br>
•	HRT:±30 h<br>
•	COD loading rate: 0.8 -1.2 kg O2/m3.d<br>
•	F/M ratio: 0.2 - 0.4 kg COD/kg MLSS.d<br>
•	Cell retention time (sludge age): 20 days<br>
•	Feed to recycle ratio: 1:2.5<br>
A sludge yield of 0.15 kg sludge/kg COD removed was achieved and the sludge produced was incinerated. The activated sludge treated effluent contained COD and SS concentrations of 100 mg O2/I and 70 mg SS/I, respectively.<br>
Activated sludge treatment yielded a secondary water-enriched stream that was subjected to sand filtration to reduce its SS concentration to 15 mg/l.<br>
The calcium concentration in the thus obtained tertiary water-enriched stream was ca. 230 mg/l and cold lime softening was used to reduce the concentration of calcium to ca. 30 mg/l giving a final TDS concentration of 95 mg/l. During the abovementioned treatment steps the COD concentration was further reduced to 45 O2 mg/l yielding a highly purified water stream.<br>
