The object of the invention is a process for the preparation of the known 17-hydroxy-<br>
6β,7β;l5β,16β-bismethylene-3-oxo-17α-pregn-4-ene-21-carboxylic acid γ-lactone (hereinafter:<br>
drospirenone) of the formula (I),<br><br>
from 15 α -hydroxy-androst-4-ene-3,17 dione of the formula (II).<br><br>
In the therapy the drospirenone is used as synthetic progestin having also<br>
anti-mineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic effects. In combination with ethynylestradiol it is<br>
marketed under the name of Yasrnin as an oral contraceptive.<br>
For the preparation of drospirenone of the formula (I) several processes are known in<br>
the chemical literature which differ in the starting material used and in the order of the reaction<br>
steps: Introduction of the functional groups is accomplished by known chemical methods.<br><br>
A synthesis of drospirenone is first disclosed in the German patent specification DE<br>
2,652,761. The synthesis starts from 3β-hydroxy-15β,16β-methyleneandrost-5-en-17-one<br>
which is reacted with l-bromo-3,3-dirnethoxypropane in tetxahydrofuran in the presence of<br>
lithium, followed by a cyclization in position 17 carried out in 70 % acetic acid to give the<br>
"lactol-ether". The hydroxy and ether groups being present in the molecule-were oxidized with<br>
cyclohexanone in the presence of aluminium isopropylate, then the double bond was<br>
izomerized by using 2N sulfuric acid to yield 17-hydroxy-15β,16β-methylene-3-oxo-17α-<br>
pregn-4-ene-21carboxylic acid γ-lactone.<br>
The "γ-lactone" so obtained was reacted with chloranil (tetrachlorobenzoquinone) in t-<br>
butanol to form the "3-oxo-andxosta-4,6-diene" in which a methylene group was introduced in<br>
positions 6,7 (by using trimethylsulfoxonium iodide and sodium hydride producing in situ a<br>
"methylide") giving the drospirenone.<br>
For the preparation of 3β-hydroxy-15β,16β-methyleneandrost-5-ene-17-one (the<br>
starting material for the above synthesis) a five step reaction route is disclosed in the German<br>
patent specification DE 1,593,500.<br>
The first synthesis for drospirenone was typically carried out by reactions difficult-to-<br>
perform and gave poor yields. Purification of the intermediates and the end-product<br>
accomplished by chromatography gave also low yields (49 %, 26 % and 16 %, respectively.<br>
In the German patent specification DE 2,746,298 intermediates which can be used also<br>
for the preparation of drospirenon are described. To form double bonds (which are required for<br>
the introduction of the methylene groups), first hydroxyl groups were brought into the<br>
molecule via a microbiological process. The dehydroepiandrosterone - the starting material for<br>
the synthesis - was hydroxylated microbiologically to give 3β,7α,15α-trihydroxyandrost-5-<br>
ene-17-one which, in turn, was oxidized in an additional fermentation step to yield 7α,15α-<br>
dihydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione. Elimination of the hydroxy group in position 15 was<br>
accomplised with p-toluenesulfonic acid catalyst yielding the "4,6,15-triene".<br>
When the 7α,15α-dihydroxy derivative was acetylated with acetic anhydride in<br>
pyridine, 3β-acetoxy-7α-hydroxyandrost-5,15-diene-17-one was obtained in one step. The<br>
methylene group was introduced into positions 15,16 as discussed above and the compound<br>
obtained was oxidized microbiologically. Subsequent ehmination of water-gave the 15β,16β-<br>
methyleneandrosta-4,6-diene-3,17-dione. Then the compound having the "diene" structure in<br><br>
the AB rings of the steroid was treated with ethylene glycol in the presence of orthoformic acid .<br>
trialkyl ester and p-toluenesulfonic acid catalyst to give the ketal in a manner known per se,<br>
said ketal was reacted with dimethoxybromopropane in the presence of lithium as described<br>
above to yield the "17-acetal", which then was cyclized'to form the corresponding "lactol-<br>
methyl ether" and this was subjected to Jones oxidation to give the corresponding "lactone".<br>
The intermediate obtained in such a way has a double bond in position 6,7 to which a<br>
methylene group can be introduced in known-manner.<br>
Theoretically another synthesis route is described for the preparation of drospirenone in<br>
the European patent specification EP 051,143 and its equivalents (US 4,416,985 and US<br>
4,614,616). The process is also published in Angew. Chem; 94, 718-719 (1982). What is novel<br>
is that the 6β,7β-methylene group is formed in a stereospecific manner by the Simmons-Smith<br>
reaction.<br>
The starting material of the process is 3β-hydroxy-15β,16β-methyleneandrost-5-en-17-<br>
one. The hydroxy in 7β position is introduced in a fermentation process using Botryodiplodia<br>
malorum, the resultant compound is acetylated in a regios elective manner with pivalic<br>
anhydride in the presence of 4-dimemylaminopyridine yielding the corressponding 3β-<br>
pivaloyloxy derivative. Said pivaloyloxy derivative was reacted with tert-butyl hydroperoxide<br>
in the presence of VO (acetonylacetonate)2 catalyst to give the 5β,6β-epoxy derivative which,<br>
in turn, was reacted with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrachloride in dichloromethane to<br>
yield the 7α-chloro derivative. Said 7α-chloro derivative was reacted with zinc in a mixture of<br>
acetic acid and tetrahydrofuran yielding the 5β-hydroxy-15β,16β-methylene-3β-<br>
pivaloyloxyandrost-6-en-17-one which then was hydrolyzed with potassium hydroxide to give<br>
3β,5β-dihydroxy-15β,16β-methyleneandrost-6-en-17-one.<br>
Into the compound having a double bond in position 6 the methylene group was<br>
introduced by using diiodomethane in the presence of zinc in ethylene glycol dimethyl ether<br>
solvent and the "6β,7β;15β,16β -dimethylene" derivative so obtained was propynylated in<br>
position 17 in the presence of potassium ethylate in tetrahydrofuran. Said 17α-β-hydroxy-1-<br>
propynyl)-6β,7β;15β,16β-dimethyleneandrostan-3β,5β,17β-triol was hydrogenated in a<br>
mixture of tetrahydrofuran, methanol and pyridine in the presence of Pd/CaCO3 or Pd/C<br>
catalyst and the compound obtained was oxidized, lactonized and dehydrated in one step by<br>
using chromium trioxide in aqueous pyridine.<br><br>
According to EP 0,051,143 instead of the pivaloyloxy protective group tert-<br>
butyldirnethylsilyl, dimethyl-(3-methylbutyl)-silyl or tribenzylsilyl substituent are also suitable.<br>
The systhesis consists of 15 steps. In the epoxidation step the use of the tert-butyl<br>
hydroperoxide is not without risk. When zinc dust is applied in a heterogeneous system under<br>
vigorous stirring a special apparatus is' required. The sodium perchlorate is a hazardous<br>
material, the carbon tetrachloride as a reactant cannot already be used-even at laboratory scale,<br>
whereas the potassium ethylate is flammable. Based on experiments, when an ethynyl group is<br>
hydrogenated, besides the completely hydrogenated product there are always partially<br>
hydrogenated impurities present and said impurities can only be separated with considerable<br>
loss of the useful compound either it is a straight chain or a cyclic one.<br>
Both the EP 075,189 and the US 4,435,327 patent specifications relate to combined<br>
synthetic/microbiological processes. Starting material for the synthesis is, again, the<br>
dehydroepiandrosterone which is dihydroxylated by a fermentation process (Colletotrichum<br>
phomoides) to give the 3β,7α,15α-trihydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one; the hydroxy substituent in<br>
position 7 of said compound is then epimerized by using 35 % perchloric acid as catalyst e. g.<br>
in a mixture of acetone and dichloro-methane; finally the 3β,7β,15α-trihydroxy derivative is<br>
reacted with pivaloyl chloride in pyridine, in the presence of 4-dimemylarninopyridine catalyst<br>
to give the 3, 15-pivaloylated derivate. An alternative process for the preparation of the<br>
compound is also disclosed.<br>
The subsequent steps of the synthesis are the same as those described in EP 051,143.<br>
Beyond that the process can be accomplished via 12 steps, it also uses the reactions<br>
mentioned before which require reactants and reaction conditions that are not without danger.<br>
In the German patent specification DE 3,626,832 a different novel method for forming<br>
the y-lactone ring is disclosed. The synthesis starts from 15β,16β-methylene-3-methoxy-<br>
androsta-3,5-diene-17-one which is reacted with 2-(1-ethoxyethoxy)-3-butenenitrile and the<br>
"unsaturated nitrile" derivative obtained is cyclized to form the γ-lactone structure in two steps.<br>
Difficulties of this process arise from the sythesis of a special reagent and the bromination in<br>
position 6.<br>
According to the German patent specification DE 1,963,3683 (=US 6,121,465) from<br>
known intermediates, i. e. from 17α(3-hydroxy-l-propynyl)-6β,7β,15β,16β-<br>
bismethyleneandrostan-3β,5β,17β-triol and 6β,7β;15β,16β-bismethylene-5β,17β-dihydroxy-3-<br><br>
oxo-1 /α-pregnane-21-carboxylic acid γ-lactone tne drosplrenone is prepared Dy a new process.<br>
The 17α-(3-hydroxy-1 -propynyl)-6β,7β; 15β,16β-bismethyleneandrostane-3β,5β, 17β-triol is<br>
hydrogenated in tetrahydrofuran in the presence of palladium/carbon; the<br>
"bismethylenepropanol" obtained was suspended in acetonitrile, the suspension is heated to 45<br>
°C, then 1 mol % of ruthenium trichloride is added in aqueous solution. Subsequently aqueous<br>
solution of sodium bromate is added dropwise, the reaction mixture is kept at 50 °C for 2 hours<br>
then worked up by extraction method. The 6β,7β; 15β,16β-bismethylene-5β, 17β-dihydroxy-3-<br>
oxo-17α-pregnane-21-carboxylic acid γ-lactone obtained is recrystallized, dehydrated with p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid and purified by chromatography. According to the specification the<br>
hydrogenation and oxidation step can be performed with 65-72 % yield. The greatest advantage<br>
of this process is that no toxic chromium compound is used. In the previous steps of the<br>
process, however, there are several details which - as it is mentioned above - make difficult to<br>
meet safety requirements and make uncertain a possible scale-up of the process.<br>
In the European patent EP 0150702 a process starting from androst-4-ene-3,17-dione is<br>
disclosed. The 15α-hydroxy derivative is prepared by a fermentation step, said compound is<br>
benzoylated to give an oily product which is reacted with trimethylsulfonium methylide<br>
prepared in situ from trimethylsulfonium iodide. From 40 g of 15α-hydroxy-androst-4-ene-<br>
3,17-dione after purification by chromatography 22.7 g of 15β,16β-methyleneandrost-4-ene-<br>
3,17-dione were obtained. The propargylation is carried out by reacting the compound with<br>
propargyl acohol in the presence of potassium ethylate. A compound mixture is obtained in<br>
which the double bond of 17β-hydroxy-17α-(3-hydroxy-1-propynyl)-15β,16β-methylene-<br>
androst-5-ene-3-one component is izomerized into the "3-oxo-androst-4-ene" in an additional<br>
reaction step. Said "propynyl" derivative is hydrogenated in the presence of<br>
tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium (I) chloride catalyst, formation of the lactone ring is carried<br>
out by using chromium trioxide in pyridine. The "γ-lactone" obtained is reacted with<br>
orthoformic acid triethyl ester to yield 3-ethoxy-17-hydroxy-15β,16β-methylene-17α-pregna-<br>
3,5-diene-21-carboxylic acid γ-lactone which at position 6 is brominated, the oily product<br>
obtained is reacted with lithium bromide and lithium carbonate in dimethylformamide at 100<br>
°C to give the 17-hydroxy-15β,16β-methylene-3-oxo-17α-pregna-4,6-diene-21-carboxylic acid<br>
γ-lactone intermediate after purification by chromatography. Difficulties arising from<br><br>
hydrogenation of propynyl compound and from the bromination at position 6 were discussed<br>
above.<br>
According to the German patent specification DE 1,920,145 3-methoxy-15|3,16j3-<br>
meth.yleneandrosta-3,5-diene-17-one is synthetized from 15β,16β-methyleneandrosta-4-ene-<br>
17-one, which is refluxed with catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid and 2,2-<br>
dimethoxypropane in the presence of methanol in dimethylformarnide. Said "3-methoxy'<br>
derivative can be used as intermediate for the preparation of drospirenone.<br>
According to recent pharmacopoieal requirements several tests (e. g. TLC or HPLC) are<br>
specified to control purity of the drugs which may contain only a limited number of impurities<br>
in limited amount. To meet these requirements it is practical to know what impurities and in<br>
which amount. are present in the intermediates. For this purpose analytical control of the<br>
intermediates at adequate level is necessary to obtain drags at plant scale in good quality and to<br>
determine which purification steps are necessary or which process steps can be combined to<br>
make the process profitable.<br>
Taking into consideration the above aspects our aim is to provide a process suitable for<br>
industrial use, which is safe and lacks the drawbacks of the previous processes and by which<br>
the drug obtained is pure and meets all the pharmacopoieal requirements. Enclosed is a flow<br>
sheet 1/1 showing the whole synthesis route in an easy-to-follow form (numbered as 1/2 and<br>
2/2 pages).<br>

The inventive step of this invention is supported by the following features:<br>
a)	The starting material of the synthesis (15 α-hydroxy-androst-4-ene-3,17-dione)<br>
can easily be prepared from androst-4-ene-3,17-dione by a fermentation process.<br>
b)	Our process consists of 8 steps, while the other processes known in the art<br>
consist of 15, 12 and 10 steps, respectively.<br>
c) According to this inventions intermediates are obtained with very good yields.<br>
In Example 1; the yield is 88 %, in Example 2; 95 %, in Example 3; 76 %, in<br>
Example 4; 95.7 %, Example 5; 83.1 %, in Example 6; 77.2 % in Example 7;<br>
94.6 %, and in Example 9; 79.8 %. Processes known in the art have much lower<br>
yields.<br>
d)	Contrary to the processes known in the art in our process we neither use<br>
reagents already prohibited (e. g. carbon tetrachloride) nor other hazardous<br>
materials (e. g. tert-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium ethylate, sodium hydride, butyl<br>
lithium and sodium perchlorate). No special apparatus is required in our process,<br>
while those using e. g. zinc, need a special stirrer for the reaction carried out in<br>
heterogenous system.<br>
e)	Intermediates obtained in our process are easy to purify or can be used in the<br>
next reaction step without purification.<br><br>
f)	Intermediates that are strategically important in our process, are novel. Such<br>
new compound are of the general formula (VI), (VII), (VIII), (IX) and (IXa).<br>
g)	Even in the case of preparation of known intermediates we made efforts to use<br>
simpler methods than those known in the chemical literature and to achive better<br>
yields. E. g. the 15-α-acetoxy-androst-4-ene-3,17-dione is prepared in a well<br>
reproducible way which is easy to scale-up with a yield of 88 %, while in the<br>
literature a yield of 62 % is given.<br>
h) In the last synthetic step the product mixture is separated by combined pre- and<br>
fine chromatography with 45 % yield which is an excellent result compared<br>
with the 16 % given in the German patent specification DE 2,652,751.<br>

Pre-purification with cyclohexane/ethyl acetate/aceton eluent mixture (ratio:64:18:18: vol %)<br>
A glass column (length: 46 cm, diameter: 2.6 cm) is packed with 120 g of silica gel<br>
(UETICON C-GEL, C-490, particle size: 15-35 urn) by the dry packing technique, wetted and<br>
conditioned with cyclohexane/ethyl acetate/acetone eluent mixture (64:18:18 vol %). 4.g of<br>
crude drospirenone is dissolved in 30 ml of ethyl acetate and the solution is loaded to column<br>
by using an eluent pump. Then the eluent is loaded to the column with a fiow. rate of 4.5<br>
ml/min. In the process UV detection' is applied. Fractions containing the target substance are<br>
analysed by TLC. Based on the TLC. results fractions containing the drospirenone are<br><br>
combined into a so called "pre-purified" and into a "mixed" fraction. Said fractions are<br>
evaporated to dryness and the solid substances are crystallized from<br>
dichloromethane/diizopropyl ether (10:90 vol %). The "mixed" fraction contains - besides the<br>
target substance drospirenon - the 6a, 7 a- isomer in nearly such amount as it is present in the<br>
starting material (25-30 9b), while the "pre-purified" fraction contains the drospirenone besides<br>
maximum 2 % of the 6a,7a- isomer. From the 4 g of drospirenone loaded approximatively<br>
1.75 g "pre-purified" drospirenone is obtained. The "mixed" fracton gave 0.95 g of dry solid,<br>
which can be recirculated into the pre-chromatographic procedure.<br>
Fine purification by HPLC<br>
A HPLC column (compacted package length: about 60 cm, diameter: 5 cm) is packed<br>
with 510 g of silica gel (UETICON C-GEL C-490, particle size:l5-35 pm) by slurry technique,<br>
then conditioned with cyclohexane/ethyl acetate/acetone eluent mixture (64:18:18 vol %). 5.1 g<br>
of pre-purified drospirenone (6α, 7α-isorner content max 2 %) is dissolved in 80 ml of ethyl<br>
acetate and is injected to the column. Elution is carried out at 40 ml/min flow rate. The elute<br>
leaving the column is subjected to UV detection. From the detected break-through of the<br>
drospirenone to the end 80 ml fractions are collected which are qualified by HPLC. Based on<br>
the HPLC analysis fractions are combined into a "mixed" and a "fine chromatographed"<br>
fraction, said fractions are evaporated and crystallized from dichloromethane/diisopropyl ether<br>
mixture (10:90 % v/v). The "mixed" crystal substance weighs0.2-0.3 g and can be recirculated<br>
into the fine chromatographic process. The "fine chromatographed" fraction gave 4.4-4.5 g of<br>
drospirenon with a 6a,7a-isomer content below 0.1 %. With repeated fine chromatography a<br>
product with the same purity is obtained.<br><br>
