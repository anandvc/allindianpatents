3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION: COMPLETE The following specification describes the invention.<br>
Original<br><br>
3 JUN 2005<br>
3-6-2005<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an improved oil separation system in a domestic kitchen chimney. It relates to an improved oil separation system comprising of specially designed centrifugal suction fans, and easily detachable oil collection saucer placed directly below the suction fan to gather the oil particles separated by reverse centrifugal fan from the kitchen smoke arising from the food being cooked in the kitchen.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
During cooking large amount of oil is used especially in Indian cooking. When food is heated in oil, semi burnt oil particles float in the smoke and settle all over the kitchen walls thus making them sticky and dirty. In addition the fumes generated while cooking contain burnt Hydrocarbons, which adversely affect the health of the persons working in the kitchen.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to eliminate the semi burnt floating oil content in the kitchen fumes and thereby reduce the risk of the deposition of hydrocarbons.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Indian Kitchen smoke contains a lot of floating oil particles. A chimney is therefore used to retain the oil particles and permit only the de-oiled smoke to exit out of kitchen walls.<br><br><br>
In prior art chimneys, a wire mesh or a non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper or wire grill is placed directly below the suction fan. The sucked kitchen smoke has to pass through the wire mesh or a non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper or wire grill. The oil particle of the sucked smoke are trapped in the wire mesh or non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper or wire grill. For cleaning purposes the wire mesh or non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper or wire ghll have to be scrubbed or washed periodically. In this process, the trapped oil is simply wasted.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to retrieve the trapped oil intact for value addition purpose. This trapped oil was wasted during the cleaning of wire mesh or non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper or wire grill in the prior art.<br>
In another prior art a wire mesh or a non-woven synthetic filter or filter paper or wire grill positioned in a perforated sheet metal tray or held in a metallic frame. The metallic tray has a number of holes on the suction side, thus the oil particles pulled up from the cooking pan are trapped in this intricate wire mesh or woven filter and also on the outer side of the tray. When this filter/mesh becomes choked with the trapped oil, it is removed and has to be scrubbed clean with the help of water, soap and brush.<br>
The prior art suffers from the following drawbacks:<br>
1. Due to the placement of the wire mesh or a non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper or wire grill on the suction side, the oil trapped is viscous i.e. thick grease thus making it very difficult for periodic cleaning.<br><br>
2.	The oil sticks to the fan blades and the oil particles being trapped, chokes the wire mesh or non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper and thus poses a serious fire hazard when entire surface of wire mesh or non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper is exposed to naked flame of the gas stove below.<br>
3.	Once the wire mesh or non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper is choked the hood does not suck the fumes in unless the wire mesh or non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper is scrubbed thoroughly, which is impossible.<br>
4.	Hence the efficiency of the system drops drastically.<br>
5.	After each cooking session the oil trapping efficiency of the wire mesh or non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper goes on declining unless the it is cleaned thoroughly after each cooking session. This cleaning of the wire mesh or non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filteT paper after each cooking session is impractical.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to remove the drawbacks of the prior art and devise an efficient Oil Separation Technique by providing a novel oil separation system in place of an oil trapping system.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to forego the use of wire mesh or non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper for trapping oil and replace it by a complete oil separation system.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to eliminate the complexities in cleaning the by providing a detachable oil collecting saucer which collects the separated oil intact. Transferring the oil from oil collecting saucer into a jar for storage or value addition purpose, can be done with the help of a spoon.<br><br>
The foregoing objects of the invention are accomplished and the problems and shortcomings associated with prior art techniques and approaches are overcome by the present invention.<br>
A better and more complete understanding of the invention may be garnered from the detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the best mode of the invention as contemplated by the inventor.<br>
COMPARATIVE STUDY OVER PRIOR ART<br>
All chimneys of prior art have electric motor fans fitted with suction fan and are powered by axle rotating motors, therefore the suction fan is mounted on the rotating axle whereas in the present invention the axle does not rotate externally but the outer casing of the motor rotates. A reversed curved cylindrical centrifugal fan is slipped around the rotating circumference of the motor. This enables to provide better air suction and consuming less electricity. The outer body rotates on lifetime-greased ball hearings.<br>
In the present invention the smoke is sucked through a non-obstructing saucer by the fan without any obstruction and the smoke is hit on a vertical fan-housing wall where the oil particles stick and start flowing by gravity towards a detachable saucer. Oil collected in the saucer is intact and can be removed with the help of a spoon. This oil can be used for other purposes.<br>
In prior art the oil sticks to the fan &amp; motor also but in the present invention the oil particles sucked by the fan do not stick to the fan &amp; motor, as they are Teflon coated. In the present invention the motor is totally enclosed and therefore the oil particles and dust cannot enter<br><br>
inside the motor. This precludes the need of periodic cleaning of motor and fan.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an efficient oil separation system without using any kind of obstruction employed in prior art.<br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention employs a high suction capacity reverse curved cylindrical centrifugal suction fan. The oil generated while cooking rises up and is pulled inside the hood by these suction fans without any obstruction of wire mesh or non-woven synthetic filter or baffle or filter paper filters. The reverse curved cylindrical suction fan has a specific fin angle in order to push maximum quantum of air and in turn increase the velocity of the air discharged from the tip-of the fin. The number of fins per suction fan may be between 5-13 numbers and areplaced at an angle between 46 to 60 deg with respect to the central axis. The smoke/fumes sucked is basically a mixture of semi-burnt oil particles, soot, odour and hot air. The smoke/fumes hit a dead wall, which has a profile of an involute. This dead wall has a rough surface finish on which the oil particles are separated from the smoke. This mixture of oil, soot and hot air on hitting the dead wall has oil as the heaviest in terms of specific weight compared to the other components The oil particles start dripping from the wall of involute and are guided through the oil guide to trickle into the detachable saucer with curved edges placed directly below each suction fan for storing the separated oil. The guide ring serves the purpose of directing the smoke into the suction fan and also guides the discharge of the separated Oil only into the oil collection saucer and nowhere else, thus keeping the internal area of the chimney also clean.<br><br>
The semi burnt oil so collected can be put to non-edible use like making soap or lubrication etc. In case of other chimneys the oil trapped is simply wasted during cleaning of the filter etc.<br>
Inspite of the aforesaid process the entire quantity of oil particles may not be separated and the de-oiled smoke may contain un-separated oil particles. In situations where ducting of de-oiled smoke is not feasible, there is a provision of an outlet for re-cycling air into the kitchen. This outlet contains a perforated filter. The de-oiled smoke is guided through the perforated filter for trapping soot, odour and residual oil particles. After passing through the perforated filter the de-oiled smoke becomes clean air and is re-cycled back into the kitchen. The perforated filter comprises of 2 layers of activated charcoal mat and a synthetic non-woven filter.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings wherein<br>
Figure 1 shows exploded view of varioes parts of an oil separation<br>
system in a chimney.<br>
Figure 2(a) shows the perspective view of a chimney.<br>
Figure 2(b) shows sectional view of a chimney.<br><br>
Now, referring to figure It is a hinged tray (1) with spring loaded latch (not shown in figure) for easy opening and clesing and cutouts (9) for housing the detachable oil collecting saucer casr bell mouth (2)<br><br>
and an opening (8) for diffusing lamp light to illuminate the kitchen platform. The kitchen smoke/fumes arising out of the utensils in which food is being cooked, is sucked by the powerful suction fan (5) without any obstruction, through a 12-20 cm hole in the middle of oil collecting saucer cum bell mouth (2) placed right below the suction fan (5) and is guided inside the fan by circular guide (3). The reverse curved cylindrical centrifugal suction fan (5) is slipped around the external rotor driven electric motor (6). The smoke sucked, which is basically a mixture of warm air, black soot, odour and semi burnt oil particles, is hit with centrifugal force of the suction fan (5), on the vertical rough surface and curved FRP wall of the involute (4a). The oil particles being heavier than other components of sucked smoke get separated here and stick to the involute wall (4a) and start trickling by gravity thrqugh the slits on the circular guide (3) and get stored in the curved circumference of the oil collecting saucer cum bell mouth (2). The oil collecting saucer cum bell mouth (2) when filled with the semi burnt oil can be easily removed by opening the tray (1).<br>
The de-oiled smoke is pushed out by the suction fan (5) through passage (4d) leading to top duct port cut out (8a) for ducting outside the kitchen.<br>
In situations where ducting is not feasible the top duct port (8a) is blocked or closed and the de-oiled smoke is pushed by the fan through passage (4b) and (4c) leading towards rectangular cut out (8b) housing the perforated filter (7). The de-oiled smoke then passes through the layers of activated carbon mats (7a) sandwiching non-woven synthetic filter (7b) inserted into the perforated filter (7) in which the soot, odour and residual oil particles are trapped and the clean air is re-cycled back into the kitchen.<br>
Figure 2(a) and 2(b) are different views with the same explanation as for figure 1.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
1.	Very easy to maintain and clean as the oil separated collects in an easy to inspect and clean oil collection saucer. The collected oil can be removed intact for value addition purpose.<br>
2.	As there is no filter on the suction side (which is actually an obstruction to suction) the efficiency of the system never reduces.<br>
3.	The oil is not exposed to naked flame and hence the problem of the hood becoming a fire aggravator is eliminated.<br>
4.	Plain surface of the tray &amp; oil collecting saucer having large openings allow large volume of air to be pulled. This ensures no oil / dust is trapped on the bottom surface of the tray - thus making cleaning very easy.<br>
5.	The collected oil can be used for different purposes. E.g. making soap, lubricants etc.<br><br><br>
