				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of producing biological fertilizer composition that comprises yeasts for fixing atmospheric Nitrogen, and decomposing insoluble compounds containing phosphorus, potassium and/or carbon. The invention also relates to methods for using the biological fertilizer to increase crop yields.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Use of fertilizer is essential in supporting the growth of high yield crops. Of the basic nutrients that plants need for healthy growth, large amounts of nitrogen (taken up as N03- or NH/), phosphorus (taken up as H2PO4"), and potassium (taken up as K+) nutrients are required by most crops on most soils (Wichmann, W. et al., IF A World Fertilizer Use Manual). Such large amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium nutrients are supplied mainly in the form of minernl fertilizers, either processed national minerals or manufactured chemicals (K.F. Isherwood, 1998, Mineral Fertilizer Use and the Environment, United Nations Environmental Programme Technical Report No.26.). The development and use of mineral fertilizers since the 1940s: has permitted significant increases in crop yields on the same to slightly less amount of cropland to support today's enormous population. Without such advances in agriculture, a great amount of pastures and forests would have been converted into cropland. (K.F. Isherwood, 1998, Mineral Fellilizer Use and the Environment. United Nations Environmental Programme Technical Report No. 26.)<br>
Despite the importance of mineral fertilizers in providing mankind with abundant agricultural products, the harm done to the environment has been recognized in the recent years. Mineral fertilizers may incurred damages to soils. For example, most nitrogen fertilizers may acidify soils, thereby adversely affecting the growth of plants and other soil organisms. Extensive use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers may also inhibit the activity of natural nitrogen fixing microorganisms, thereby decreasing the natural fertility of soils. Mineral fertilizers may also introduce toxic substances into soil and produce. For example, phosphate fertilizers processed from rock phosphate often contain small amounts of toxic elements, such as cadmium, which may build up in soil and be taken up by plants. The long term use of mineral fertilizers may also cause severe environmental pollution. For example, the loss of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers due to leaching and soil erosion has<br>
led to contamination of soil and ground water, and entrophication of surface water. Cleaning up polluted soil and water has been a complicated and difficult task. The cost for such a task is also astronomical.<br>
In search for a solution to the problem, some are going back to organic fertilizers. As is well known, organic fertilizers come from many different sources. Types of organic fertilizer include farm wastes, such as crop residues and animal manures; residues from plant and animal products, such as wood materials; and town wastes, such as sewage (Wichmann, W., et aL, IFA World Fertilizer Use Manual). Organic fertilizers are usually low in nutrients and less effective in supporting plant growth. For example, the total nutrients in cattle manure is less than 2%, and the nitrogen nutrients therein are more difficult to be effectively utilized due to their losses into the environment (K.F. Isherwood, 1998. Mineral Fertilizer Use and the Environment, United Nations Environmental Programme Technical Report No. 26.). Normally, very large amount of organic fertilizers have to be applied to soil. To reach high crop yield, organic fertilizers have only been used to supplement mmeral fertilizers. Therefore, the problems with mineral fertilizers cannot be satisfactorily solved by substituting mineral fertilizer with organic fertilizer. Furthermore, organic fertilizers also have created environmental problems. For example, some organic fertilizers, if unprocessed, contains pathogenic microorganisms, such as E. coli, Salmonella, and Coccidae. Organic fertilizers may also contain toxic chemicals and may produce undesirable odor. The use of organic fertilizer also contribute to the contamination and eutrophication of the natural water system. Therefore, in many parts of the world, including the United States, laws and regulations have been established imposing considerable restriction on both the composition and the usage of organic fertilizers.<br>
Biological fertilizers utilizing microorganisms have been proposed as alternatives to mineral fertilizers. Naturally occurring nitrogen fixing microorganisms including bacteria, such as Rhizobium, Azotobacter, and Azospirillum, (See for example, U. S. Patent No. 5,071,462) and fungi, such as Aspergillus flavus-oryzae, (See, for example, U. S. Patent No. 4,670,037) have been utilized in biological fertilizers. Naturally occurring microorganisms capable of solubilizing rock phosphate ore or other insoluble phosphates into soluble phosphates have also been utilized in biological fertilizers either separately (e.g., U. S. Patent No. 5,912,398) or in combination with nitrogen fixing microorganisms (e.g., U. 5. Patent No. 5,484,464). Genetically modified bacterial strains have also been developed and utilized in biological fertilizers. An approach based on recombinant DNA techniques has been developed to create more effective nitrogen fixing, phosphorus decomposing, and potassium decomposing bacterial strains for use in a biological fertilizer,<br>
see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,578,486; PCT publication WO 95/09814; Chinese patent publication: CN 1081662A; CN 1082016A; CN 1082017A; CN 1103060A; andCN 1109595A.<br>
However, the biological fertilizers that are based on naturally occurring microorganisms are generally not efficient enough to effectively replace mineral fertilizers. It is therefore important to develop biological fertilizers that can replace mineral fertilizers in supplying nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to crops for producing high quality agricultural products while avoiding the problems associated with mineral fertilizers. The present invention provides a method of producing biological fertilizer based on yeasts, which can replace mineral fertilizers.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides method of producing biological fertilizer compositions that comprise yeast cells. The present invention also provides the methods for using the biological fertilizer compositions.<br>
The biological fertilizer compositions of the invention can replace chemical/mineral fertilizers in supplying nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) to plants especially crop plants. The biological fertilizer compositions of the present invention can increase crop yields by 10-60%. Because the biological fertilizers of the present invention utilize metabolic activities of living yeasts to convert raw materials, such as atmospheric nitrogen and phosphorus and potassium minerals, into plant nutrients, the conversion and release of such nutrients by the yeast cells is regulated in part by the nutrient content of the soil. The nutrient content of the soil in turn depends in part on both the environment and the changing needs of plants. Therefore, the release of plant nutrients by the biological fertilizer compositions is adaptable to the soil condition and can be sustained over a period of time.<br>
In one embodiment, the biological fertilizer compositions of the invention comprise one or more yeast cell components. A yeast cell component of the biological fertilizer compositions comprises a plurality of yeast cells which are capable of performing one of the following functions, each of which results in the provision of one type of nutrients to plants: (1) fixation of atmospheric nitrogen; (2) decomposition of phosphorous minerals or compounds; (3) decomposition of potassium minerals or compounds; (4) decomposition of complex or high molecular weight carbon materials or compounds. Additional yeast cell components can be included to produce growth factors and ATP to support the other yeasts in the fertilizer compositions.<br>
The biological fertilizer compositions of the invention can further comprise an organic substrate component, and/or an inorganic substrate component. The organic substrate component of the fertilizer compositions is a primary carbon source for the yeast cells in the fertilizer. The inorganic substrate component provides the yeast cells in the fertilizer compositions minerals, materials, and compounds containing phosphorous and/or potassium. The organic and inorganic substrate component may also provide the plants with other minerals such as but not limited to calcium, magnesium, and sulfur: and micronutrients, such as but not limited to boron, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and Zinc.<br>
As used herein, the term "nitrogen fixation" or "fixation of atmospheric .nitrogen" encompasses biological processes in which molecular nitrogen or nitrogen in the atmosphere is converted into one or more nitrogenous (N) compounds, including but not limited to, ammonia, ammonium salts, urea, and nitrates.<br>
As used herein the phrase "decomposition of phosphorus minerals or compounds" refers to biological processes which convert phosphorus (P) compounds, such as but not limited to those water-insoluble phosphorus compounds present in rock phosphate, into one or more different phosphorus compound(s) which can be more readily used for survival and/or growth by plants and other yeasts. For example, the resulting phosphorus compounds may be more soluble in water, and can thus be taken up by the roots of plants.<br>
As  used  herein  the  phrase  "decomposition  of potassium  minerals   or compounds"  refers   biological  processes  which   convert   potassium    (K)   compounds,   such  as   but not  limited  to    those   water-insoluble  potassium  compounds  present   in  potassium   mica,<br>
into one or more different potassium compound(s) which can be more readily used for survival and/or growth by plants and other yeasts. For example, the resulting potassium compounds may be more soluble in water, and can fhus  be taken up by the roots of plants.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "decomposition of complex or high molecular weight carbon minerals, materials or compounds" refers to the biological conversion of a complex organic or inorganic carbon molecule into one or more carbon molecules) which usually are of a lower molecular weight, and can be more readily used for survival and/or growth by plants and other organisms, including other yeasts. For example, it encompasses the conversion of high molecular weight carbon compounds in weathered coal to simple carbohydrates, such as pentose and hexose. This process includes those reactions where long chains of carbon atoms in a polymeric carbon compound are cleaved.<br>
As used herein, the term "growth factors" refers to molecules commonly required for growth of yeasts, including but not limited to vitamins, in particular, vitamin B complexes, e.g., vitamin B-l, riboflavin (vitamin B-2), vitamin B-12, niacin (B-3), pyridoxine (B-6), pantothenic acid (B-5); folic acid; biotin; para-aminobenzoic acid; choline; and inositol.<br>
A wide variety of organic and inorganic materials may be used to supply the phosphorus, potassium, and complex high molecular weight carbon minerals, materials and compounds to be converted by the yeast cells into nutrients for use by the yeasts and the plants. The organic and inorganic materials that may be used in conjunction with the present invention include, but not limited to, minerals, such as but not limited to phosphate rock or rock phosphate, apatite, phosphorite, sylvinite, halite, camalitite, potassium mica, lignite; industrial materials or wastes, such as but not limited to coal-mine waste, weathered coal, coal-powder, and hydrocarbon waste; environmental materials and wastes, such as but not limited to sludge from sewage water treatment plant and land fills, muds, such as turf mud, mud from river and lake bed; organic wastes, such as but not limited to waste and manure from urban areas and animal manure, such as poultry manure, cattle manure, hog manure, sheep manure, and guano, waste materials from plants, waste material from animals including fish meal, bone meal, human waste, dried blood, etc., and products or by-products from fermentation of plant materials containing cellulose, starch and/or other carbohydrates.<br>
In addition, depending on needs, a disinfectant may be included in the biological fertilizer compositions. An environmentally safe disinfectant is preferred. For example, a biological disinfectant, super-CM6, can be used with environmental and organic wastes, such as waste and manure from urban areas and animal manure.<br>
In various embodiments, the biological fertilizer compositions of tbe present invention comprises at least one yeast cell component, and preferably six yeast cell components. The inventor discovered mat, under certain culture conditions, various yeast strains can be induced to exhibit the following six activities: (1) fixation of atmospheric nitrogen; (2) decomposition of phosphorus minerals or compounds; (3) decomposition of potassium minerals or compounds; (4) decomposition of complex or high molecular weight carbon materials or compounds; (5) production of excess growth fiictars in an amount that is sufficient to support the needs of other yeast strains in the fertilizer composition; and (6) production of excess ATP in an amount that is sufficient to support the needs of other yeast strains in the fertilizer composition. The culture condition determines the activity which is activated or enhanced in the cultured yeasts. The specific culture conditions for each of the six activities are described in details in sections 5.1-5.6 respectivery.<br>
According to the invention, a yeast cell component of the biological fertilizer is produced by culturing a plurality of yeast cells in an appropriate culture medium in the presence of an electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field can be generated by various means well known in the art A schematic illustration of an exemplary setup is depicted in Fig. 1. The electromagnetic field of a desired frequency and amplitude is generated by an electromagnetic source (3) which comprises one or more signal generators mat are capable of generating electromagnetic waves, preferably sinusoidal waves, in the frequency range of 100 MHz - 2000 MHz. If desirable, a signal amplifier can also be used to increase the output. The electromagnetic field can be applied to the culture by a variety of means including placing the culture in close proximity to the signal emitters. In one embodiment, the electromagnetic field is applied by electrodes that are submerged in the culture (1). In a preferred embodiment, one of the electrodes is a metal plate, and the other electrode comprises a plurality of wires configured inside the container (2) so that the energy of the electromagnetic field can be evenly distributed in the culture. The number of electrode wires used depends on both the volume of the culture and the diameter of the wire. In preferred embodiments, for a culture having a volume up to 5000 ml, one electrode wire having a diameter of between 0.1-1.2 mm can be used for each 100 ml of culture; for a culture having a volume greater than 1000 1, one electrode wire having a diameter of between 3-30 mm can be used for each 10001 of culture.<br>
The types of yeasts contemplated for use in the invention include without limitation, yeasts of the genera of Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces, Sporobolomyces, Torulopsis, Trichosporon, Wickerhomia, Ashbya, Blastomyces, Candida, Citeromyces, Crehrothncivm.

Under certain circumstances, it may be less preferable to use such pathogenic yeasts in the biological fertilizer of me invention, for example, if such use in an open field may endanger me health of human and/or other living organisms.<br>
Yeasts of the Saccharomyces genus are generally preferred. Among strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hansen is a preferred strain. The most preferred strains of yeast are Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hansen strains having accession numbers AS2.501, AS2.535, AS2.441, AS2.406, AS2382, and AS2.16 as deposited at the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC). Generally, the yeast strains can be obtained from private or public laboratory cultures, or publically accessible culture deposits, such as the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, VA 20110-2209 and me China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC), China Committee for Culture Collection of Microorganisms, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Haidian, P.O. Box 2714, Beijing, 100080, China.<br>
Although it is preferred, the preparation of the yeast cell components of the invention is not limited to starting with a pure strain of yeast. Each yeast cell component may be produced by culturing a mixture of yeast cells of different species or strains. The constituents of a yeast cell component can be determined by standard yeast identification techniques well known in the art.<br>
Some yeasts may perform one of the desired functions more efficiently than others. The ability of any species or strain of yeast to perform one of the six desired functions before or after culturing under the conditions of the invention can readily be tested by methods known in the art. For example, the amount of nitrogen fixed can be determined by a modified acetylene reduction method as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,578,486 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The modified acetylene reduction method determines the amount of nitrogen fixed by measuring the decrease in molecular nitrogen in a volume of air. The amount of nitrogen fixed can also be determined by measurement of the ammonia and nitrates produced by the yeast cells (see, for example, Grewling et ah, 1965, Cornell Agr Exp Sta Bull 960:22-25). For the other functions, the amount of phosphorus available to plants as a result of conversion from insoluble or biologically-<br>
unavailable phosphorus compounds can be determined by the molybdenum blue method (see, for example, Murphy et al, 1962, Analytica Chimica Acta 27:31-36) or the UV absorption method; whereas the amount of available potassium converted from insoluble or biologically-unavailable potassium compounds can be determined, for example, by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (see, for example, Puchyr, et al., 1986,1 Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem. 69:868-870). The ability of the yeasts to supply plant available N, P, and K after the biological fertilizer composition has been added to soil can be tested by many techniques known in the art For example, plant-available ammonia, nitrates, P, and K produced by the yeast cells in soil can be extracted and quantitatively analyzed by the Morgan soil test system (sec, for example, Lunt et al., 1950, Conn Agr Exp Sta Bull 541).<br>
Without being bound by any theory or mechanism, the inventor believes that the culture conditions activate and/or enhance the expression of a gene or a set of genes in yeast such that the yeast cells become active or more efficient in performing the respective functions.<br>
According to the invention, the biological fertilizer compositions comprises at least one yeast cell component capable of performing one of the following biological functions: (1) fixation of atmospheric nitrogen; (2) decomposition of insoluble or biologically-unavailable phosphorus minerals or compounds present in the fertilizer composition or in soil; (3) decomposition of insoluble or biologically-unavailable potassium minerals or compounds present in the fertilizer composition or in soil; (4) decomposition of complex or high molecular weight carbon materials or compounds present in the fertilizer composition or in soil; (5) production of excess growth factors in an amount that is sufficient to support the needs of other yeast strains in the fertilizer composition; and (6) production of excess ATP in an amount that is sufficient to support the needs of other yeast strains in the fertilizer composition. In preferred embodiments, the biological fertilizer compositions can comprise from one yeast strain to up to six different yeast species or strains, each cultured under specific conditions to induce or maximize its ability to perform the respective functions. It will be understood that alternative formulations are also contemplated. Thus, if desired, the biological fertilizer composition may omit one or more of the above-described yeast cell components. For example, in soil rich in biologically-available phosphorus, a fertilizer composition may be formulated to lack the component consisting of phosphorus compounds-decomposing yeast. In the most preferred embodiments of the present invention, a biological fertilizer composition that contains all six yeast cell components as well as the organic and/or inorganic substrates is contemplated. In another embodiment of the invention, where the yeast cells of the various<br>
yeast cell components are present in a mixture, the yeast cells can be cultured under certain conditions .such mat me yeast cells with different functions can supply each other with andVor rely on each other for nutrients and growth factors. As a result, a symbiosis-like relationship is established among the various yeast cell components in the fertilizer compositions of the invention. This culturing process is optional but can improve the stability and efficiency of the biological fertilizer such mat me fertilizer is made more suitable for long term use in natural soil environments. The culturing conditions for this optional process are described in Section 5.7.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the yeast cells may also be cultured under certain conditions so as to adapt the yeast cells to a particular type of soil. This culturing process is optional, and can be applied to each yeast cell component separately or to a mixture of yeast cell components. The result is better growth and survival of the yeasts in a particular soil environment The culturing conditions for this optional process are described in Section 5.8.<br>
As used herein, the biological fertilizer composition supports or enhances plant growth, if in the presence of the biological fertilizer in the soil, or applied to the roots, stems, leaves or other parts of the plant, the plant or a part of the plant gains viability, size, weight, rate of germination, rate of growth, or rate of maturation. Thus, the biological fertilizer compositions have utility in any kind of agricultural, horticultural, and forestry practices. The biological fertilizer compositions can be used for large scale commercial farming, in open fields or in greenhouse, or even in interiors for decorative plants. Preferably, the biological fertilizer is used to enhance the growth of crop plants, such as but not limited to cereal crops, vegetable crops, fruit crops, flower crops, and grass crops. For example, the biological fertilizer may be used with wheat, barley, corn, soybean, rice, oat, potato, apple, orange, tomato, melon, cherry, lemon, lettuce, carrot, sugar cane, tobacco, cotton, etc.<br>
The biological fertilizer compositions may be applied in the same manner as conventional fertilizers. As known to those skilled in the relevant art, many methods and appliances may be used. In one embodiment, culture broths of the yeast strains of the present invention are applied directly to soil or plants. In another embodiment, dried powders of the yeast strains of the present invention are applied to soil or plants. In yet another embodiment, mixtures of the yeast cell components and organic and inorganic substrate components of the present invention are applied to soil or plants. The biological fertilizer compositions may be applied to soil, by spreaders, sprayers, and other mechanized means which may be automated. The biological fertilizer compositions may be applied<br>
directly to plants, for example, by soaking seeds and/or roots, or spraying onto leaves. Such application, may be made periodically, such as once per year, or per growing season, or more frequently as desired. Tie biological fertilizer compositions of the invention can also be used in conjunction or in rotation with other types of fertilizers.<br>
Described respectively in Sections 5.1 -5.6 are the yeast cell components used for nitrogen fixation, phosphorus compound decomposition, potassium compound decomposition, complex carbon compound decomposition, growth factors production, and ATP production. Methods for preparing each yeast cell components are described. Section 5.7 describes the methods for establishing a symbiosis-like relationship among yeast strains in a fertilizer composition of the invention. Section 5.8 describes methods for adapting yeast cells of the invention to a particular type of soil. Section 5.9 describes the manufacture of the biological fertilizer compositions. Methods for the preparation of organic and inorganic raw materials and for the manufacture of the biological fertilizer, including mixing, drying, cooling, and packing, are also described. In various embodiments of the invention, standard techniques for handling, transferring, and storing microorganisms are used. Although it is not necessary, sterile conditions or clean environments are desirable when carrying out the processes of the invention.<br>
5.1. NITROGEN-FIXING YEAST CELL COMPONENT<br>
Nitrogen fixation is a process whereby atmospheric nitrogen is converted into ammonia and nitrates. Close to 800 species of naturally occurring microorganisms, mostly bacteria and cyanobacteria, from more than 70 genera have been found to be able to fix nitrogen. Some of the nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, such as Rhizoboum, form symbiotic association with plants, especially in the root of legumes. Others, such as Azotobacter, are free-living and capable of fixing nitrogen in soil.<br>
In the present invention, the ability of yeast to fix nitrogen is activated or enhanced, and the resulting nitrogen-fixing yeast cells can be used as a component of the biological fertilizer composition of the invention.<br>
According to the invention, yeast cells that have an enhanced ability to fix nitrogen are prepared by culturing the cells in the presence of an electromagnetic field in an appropriate culture medium. The frequency of the electromagnetic field for activating or enhancing nitrogen fixition in yeasts can generally be found within the range of 800 MHz -1000 MHz. After the yeast cells have been cultured for a sufficient period of time, the cells can be tested for their ability to fix nitrogen by methods well known in the art.<br>
The method of the invention for making the nitrogen-fixing yeast cells, is carried out in a liquid medium. The medium contains sources of nutrients assimilable by the yeast cells. In general, carbohydrates such as sugars, for example, sucrose, glucose, fructose, dextrose, maltose, xylose, and the like and starches, can be used either alone or in combination as sources of assimilable carbon in the culture medium. The exact quantity of the carbohydrate source or sources utilized in the medium depends in part upon the other ingredients of the medium but, in general, the amount of carbohydrate usually varies between about 0.1% and 5% by weight of the medium and preferably between about 0.5% and 2%, and most preferably about 1%. These carbon sources can be used individually, or several such carbon sources may be combined in the medium.<br>
Among the inorganic salts which can be incorporated in the culture media are the customary salts capable of yielding sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, sulfate, carbonate, and like ions. Non-limiting examples of nutrient inorganic salts are CaCO3, KH2PO4, MgSO4,NaCl, and CaSO4.<br>
Table I: Composition for a culture medium for nitrogen-fixing yeast<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It should be noted that the composition of the media provided in Table I is not intended to be limiting. Various modifications of the culture medium may be made by those skilled in the art, in view of practical and economic considerations, such as the scale of culture and local supply of media components.<br>
The process is initiated by inoculating each 100ml of medium with 1ml of an inoculum of the selected yeast strain(s) at a cell density of 103-105 cell/ml, preferably 3X102-<br>
104  cell/ml. The  process can be scaled up or down according to needs. The yeast culture is grown for ajbout 12-24 hours, preferably for about 24 hours, in the presence of an electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field, which can be applied by any means known in the art, has a frequency in the range of 860 to 870 MHz, preferably at about 865<br>
MHz, more preferably in the range of 865.522 to 865.622 MHz, and most preferably at<br>
865.572 MHz. The amplitude of the field is in the range of 1000-2000mV, preferably at about 1250mV. After mis first period of culture, me yeast cells are further incubated under substantially the same conditions for approximately another 24 hours, except that the amplitude is increased to a higher level in the range of 4000-5000 mV, preferably to about 4656 mV. An exemplary set-up of the culture process is depicted in Figure 1. The process of the invention is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 25° to 30°C; however, it is preferable to conduct the process at 28 °C. The culturing process may preferably be conducted under conditions in which the concentration of dissolved oxygen is between 0.025 to 0.8 mol/nr\ preferably 0.4 mol/m3. The oxygen level can be controlled by any conventional means known to one skilled in the art, including but not limited to stirring and/or bubbling.<br>
At the end of the culturing process, the nitrogen-fixing yeast cells may be recovered from the culture by various methods known in the art, and stored at a temperature below about 0°C to 4°C.   The nitrogen-fixing yeast cells may also be dried and stored in powder form.<br>
Any methods known in the art can be used to test the cultured yeast cells for their ability to fix nitrogen. For example, a modified acetylene reduction method for measuring nitrogen fixed by microorganisms is used to evaluate the nitrogen-fixing capability of the prepared yeast. The modified acetylene reduction method is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,578,486 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example, 1 ml of the prepared yeast culture is inoculated into 30 ml of a medium according to Table I in a sealed 250 ml flask.

5.10.1. Preparation of the Organic and Inorganic Substrate Components<br>
A wide range of organic and inorganic materials can be used in the biological fertilizer compositions of the present invention. Organic materials, such as but not limited<br>
to coal-mine waste and weathered coal, or any materials that contain more than 20% of organic substances, can be used as sources of carbon to support 'die growth of plants and yeasts. Combinations and mixtures of such organic materials can also be used. Organic compounds present in such materials are decomposed by the yeast capable of breaking complex or high molecular weight carbon-chain molecules into simple carbon compounds so that they can be used by plants and other yeast cells in the fertilizer.<br>
Inorganic materials, such as but not limited to phosphate rock and potassium mica, are included as sources of phosphorus and potassium respectively. Other phosphorous- or potassium-containing materials and minerals can also be used. These inorganic compounds are decomposed by K-decomposing and P-decomposing yeast cells into biologically available potassium and biologically available phosphorus mat can be used by the growing plants as well as the yeast cells in the fertilizer. Any organic or inorganic material may be used alone or in combination or in substitution with any other materials in the present invention. Alternatively, one or more organic or inorganic ingredients may be omitted, or substituted by another if it is deemed desirable by the particular application. For example, potassium mica can be omitted if die soil contains sufficient potassium minerals.<br>
The organic and inorganic materials used in the invention should not contain amounts of toxic substances or microorganisms that can inhibit the growth of the yeast cells or plants.<br>
The organic and inorganic components in the present invention are ground into suitable forms and sizes before incorporated into the fertilizer.
