				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Thermoplastic stiffening material for shoe production and an underlying production procedure<br>
The present invention relates to a novel thermoplastic stiffening material for the production of shoes or shoe parts including the introduction of an environmentally friendly production procedure for the making thereof.<br>
Stiffening or reinforcement materials for shoes comprise toe and counter puffs, fire-resistant soles, side reinforcements and slip belts, heel reinforcements and diverse cap combinations. Modern shoe production processes nowadays are accustomed to use these components in order to provide the shoes with convenient form and wear stability as well as rebound elasticity after the final removal of the mounting lasts.<br>
The thermoplastic shoe stiffening materials can be applied during the manufacturing process, using heat and pressure in the so called activation process to bond/glue these to the shoe upper (e.g. leather) or the textile inner lining, afterwards adapting them to the lasts' shape. DE 26 21 195 C describes the making of sheet-formed stiffening materials, where a support material is coated with a meltable powdery polymer material containing additional fillers. These meltable polymers comprise among others polyethylene, co-polymers of ethylene with vinylacetate or methylacrylate.<br>
The subject of this patent was to find a way to enlarge the filler material quantity in the mixture of powdery polymer and filler material and still gain a convenient stability of the material. The solution to this task was formed by the finding that it is possible to increase the filler quantity to 100 vol.% relating to the quantity of the meltable powdery polymer material if the particle size distribution of both materials remains comparable. It is only then that the filler particles are entirely coated with the melt polymer material, being completely attributed the polymer properties and behaving like real polymers afterwards. Wood flour and chalk are mentioned as typical filler particle examples.<br>
However, such stiffening materials do not possess the ability to bond or glue at temperatures normally present in shoe production so that there is the need for additional glueing or bonding procedures or the application of adhesive materials.<br>
EP 183 192 B2 describes a material being suited for shoe stiffening with immediate bonding or glueing qualities. It makes use of inert fillers completely made up of or entirely coated with the polymer in combination with a meltable adhesive material, for example polycaprolactone which is meltable with a relatively low melting temperature of approx. 60 °C. The adhesive material - binder ratio is 70 to 20 w.% for the binder and 30 to 80 w.% for the filler. The filler's particle size distribution ranges from 50 to 500 |im.<br>
This invention's essential feature is to be found in the fact that the fillers comprise inert polymers insoluble in the melt polymer binding or adhesive material while being in activation state, meaning that they were not solved in the melt temperature range of the binding adhesive. One of the best suited fillers was polyvinylchloride or PVC, the prerequisite of particle size contribution comparability still being given in order to establish goof inner adherence of the mixture. Other examples of binding agents or adhesives mentioned here were polyurethane and modified polyethylenvinylacetate. In order to achieve an adequate and sufficient stability during the manufacturing process, it was also necessary to apply a support material (usually non-wovens, textile materials release papers). These support materials are needed in the manufacturing process. The stiffening materials described herein do no longer require additional adhesive or binding materials and with reasonable selection of the components up to 80 w.% of the fillers might be used relating to the entire quantity of coating material. Even when cut or skived these coatings reveal the same good thermoplastic and adhesive characteristics as in the non-cut and non-skived "full" materials. Hot melt adhesives as described here show melt temperature ranges from 50 to 80 °C and bond the filler particles by means of adhesion onto their surfaces.<br>
Reinforcing and stiffening materials for shoe production are described in a series of additional patent documents. WO 00/41585 Al, applicant Texon UK and WO 00/53416, applicant Texon UK, shall take on exemplary function excluding further evaluation. A preferred method of applying these stiffening materials according to EP 183 192 is the pre¬heating of the stiffening materials which induces thermoplastic moulding or melting of the binding agent or adhesive, respectively, before it is manually positioned to the shoe shaft. Following positioning it is hot or cold pressed for forming with simultaneous glueing or bonding.<br>
This pre-heating or activation can be brought about by contact heating. In order to provide sufficient mechanical stability and controllable surface adhesiveness for hot-state handling these products are furnished with a supporting textile material. These textile materials might be open-pore fabric, tissue or non-woven fabric to be superficially covered on both sides. By applying this method one can gain sufficient mechanical stability combined with controlled and reduced surface tack; under pressure, the adhesive material forces through the textile covering during the manufacturing process. However, this method suffers from the major disadvantages of high textile material costs and the even more important lack of recycling opportunity due to textile support material's portion. It must be mentioned that "waste" from cutting and skiving of the final material /sheet material might amount to 30 % of the initial material weight.<br>
The tasks of good adhesiveness by manual positioning in hot state to the shoe shaft with good coherence or stability results in the temperature range of the manufacturing process of 50 to 100 °C and a convenient surface tack were not easy to harmonise. Up to now, these requirements could not be met and made it necessary to apply a multi-layer combination with textiles or coatings which could provide a suitable and ready-for-use stiffening material, as described above. The major disadvantages of this manufacturing process are to be found in the high costs and missing recycling possibility of the materials.<br>
The present invention's objective is to find a suitable hot-melt /filler combination or compound for any manufacturing process which entirely fulfils the above mentioned parameters, without needing to apply a multi-layer material combination and furthermore ensuring that the production wastes derived from cutting and skiving can be recycled to 100 % as raw materials.<br>
A further objective of the present invention was to select thermoplastic polymers achieving required values of stiffness and adhesiveness in combination with naturally occurring fillers like wood, wood flour or cork products, but also with inert inorganic fillers like chalk, kaolin etc.<br>
Surprisingly, it was to be found out that the above mentioned tasks can be solved by a thermoplastic stiffening material which is a hot melt/filler compound consisting of<br>
1.	one or more hot melt adhesives in a quantity of 50 to 95 w.% with a MMFR value/ melt mass flow rate (measured at 100 °C ,21.6 kg according to German DIN ISO 1133) of 2 to 300, preferably 10 to 20 cm  / 10 min<br>
2.	one or more fillers in a quantity of 50 to 5 w.%, which do not solve in the hot melt adhesive and the hot melt /filler compound simultaneously fulfilling the following parameters:<br>
4. length extension of maximum 25 %, preferable less than 20 %, measured after 5 minutes of storing in a hot cabinet at temperatures of 90 °C.<br>
The present inventive thermoplastic stiffening material for shoe manufacturing by means of a hot melt /filler compound is especially characterised by the fact that component a, the hot melt', is a mixture made up from:<br>
1. a linear polyester in a quantity of 75 to 95 w.% and/or thermoplastic polyurethane in a quantity of 75 to 95 w.% and 2. in combination with an ethylene-vinylacetate co¬polymer in a quantity of 0 to 25 w.% with a vinylacetate amounting to 10 to 40 w.% , preferably 25 to 30 w.%, and the filler being selected from the group of inorganic and mineral fillers, organic, plant-derived or vegetable fillers, polymers and their mixtures in the form of spherical, multi-edged particles having a particle size distribution of 10 to 1000 |um, preferably 45 to 500 p.m or in the form of fibres with a longitude of 45 to lOOO^m, preferably 45 to 500 (xm. Wood flour is to be chosen as preferred filler with a particle size distribution of 45 to 500 /Am. The filler also can be chalk, especially industrially used chalk with a particle size distribution of 10 to 45 (xm or a polymer e.g. polyethylenterephtalate (PET) with a particle size distribution of 45 to 500 (xm.<br>
The surface tack of the hot melt/filler compound measured according to DIN EN 14510 at 65 °C shows a value of at least 10 N (maximum 60 N), preferably 15 N, in particular 30 N. Reaching a higher tack value than 60 N strongly minimises the handling properties of the material.<br>
The length extension, representing material stability in the activated state, has been measured in a hot cabinet at 90 °C. The hanged test strips of 2 cm width and 10 cm length and 0.95 mm depth were to be taken out of the cabinet after 5 minutes of heating and the alternation of the length dimension was to be measured. Relating to the originally applied sample the change in length was measured and expressed in %.<br>
Hot melt /filler compounds which demonstrate length stretchiness of maximum 20 % at temperatures of 90 °C are the best suited materials, provided that the other parameters according to claim 1 are fulfilled.<br>
To make a method suited to the making of thermoplastic stiffening materials for shoe production by means of the hot melt /filler compound is characterised by the fact that the hot melt is melted at temperatures of maximum 220 °C and that the filler is dosed by means of a dosing apparatus to the hot melt under stirring or kneading, while the moisture and emitted gases are extracted by means of a degassing apparatus, the malleable mass to be subjected to a vacuum degassing. The malleable mass is then ready for further treatment according to the established shoe stiffening procedures.<br>

The table made use of the following abbreviations:<br>
n.n. not detectable, not measurable, because the material is not stable enough. It is not possible to activate it, e.g. impossible processing in hot state n.n. (2) not measurable due to textile support n.g. not measured<br>
NC incomplete calescence - materials separate alongside the glue strip that means between compound and surface material (leather)<br>
CF cohesion break - means there is a separation inside the compound Summary of the results;<br>
Inventive materials according to examples 1,3,5 and 8 are characterised by the fact that they fulfil all 4 parameters, they remain within the so called "product window", whereas the raw materials, products 9,10 and 12, as well as materials 13 and 14 according to EP 183 192 and DE 26 21 195 without support, deviate in at least one parameter, thereby found to be not suited and therefore set outside the product window. Furthermore, table 1 demonstrates that the suitability of some polymers is also limited. However, they they show low cohesion due to their smooth surface.<br>
Manufacturing process<br>
A hot melt adhesive with an average molecular weight of 80,000 g/mol is melted at 190 °C. The filler, a wood flour fibre mixture with a particle size distribution of 150 to 500 pan is added by means of a dosing apparatus to the hot melt under stirring and kneading and the evolving moisture and gases are removed by a degassing device. The malleable mass is further degassed by vacuum degassing.<br>
The malleable mass will be introduced into a multi-step roller calender with the temperature of each step of the calendar showing a decreasing temperature profile beginning with 40 °C and ending at 20 °C. In the calendar the malleable mass will be rolled smoothly and after cooling it will be taken off the calender in form of sheet material. This flat sheet material can be cut and skived according to established manufacturing methods for shoe toe puffs and counters. Wastes deriving from the cut and skive process can be collected and after a grinding process this ground matter can be introduced again into the process or can be used as raw material in powder form in the powder technology for the manufacture of stiffening materials.<br>
The hot melt /filler compound can also be granulated and this granulate can be melted again and extruded or calendered to a flat foil or sheet.<br>
A further method to make the inventive compounds is the injection moulding technology. The inventive hot melt /filler compound can also be the basis for a fine powder with a particle size distribution of 50 to 1000 |im and used for the manufacture of flat foils employed in the confectioning of stiffening parts.<br>
It is furthermore possible to use the hot melt /filler powder compound in the powder coating technology for the manufacture of three-dimensional stiffening elements or parts. The inventive hot melt /filler compounds or stiffening materials made according to the different methods and shoes containing these show very good wear properties. <br>
