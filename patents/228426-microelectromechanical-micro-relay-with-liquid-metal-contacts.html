				<td>MICROELECTROMECHANICAL MICRO-RELAY WITH LIQUID METAL CONTACTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to electrical and electronic circuits and components. More<br>
specifically, the present invention relates to micro-electromechanical (MEM) relays with<br>
liquid metal contacts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A MEM switch is a switch operated by an electrostatic charge, thermal,<br>
	piezoelectric or other actuation mechanisms and manufactured using micro-electromechanical<br>
	fabrication techniques. A MEM switch may control electrical, mechanical, or optical signal<br>
flow. Conventional MEM switches are usually single pole, single throw (SPST)<br>
	configurations having a rest state that is normally open. In a switch having an electrostatic<br>
	actuator, application of an electrostatic charge to the control electrode (or opposite polarity<br>
e<br>
electrostatic charges to a two-electrode configuration) will create an attractive electrostatic<br>
force ("pull") on the switch causing the switch to close. The switch opens by removal of the<br>
electrostatic charge on the control electrode(s), allowing the mechanical spring restoration<br>
force of the armature to open the switch. Actuator properties include the required make and<br>
break force, operating speed, lifetime, sealability, and chemical compatibility with the contact<br>
structure.<br>
A micro-relay includes a MEM electronic switch structure mechanically operated by a<br>
separate MEM electronic actuation structure. There is only a mechanical interface between<br>
the switch portion and the actuator portion of a micro-relay. When the switch electronic<br>
circuit is not isolated from the actuation electronic circuit, the resultant device is usually<br>
referred to as a switch instead of a micro-relay. MEM devices are typically built using<br>
substrates compatible with integratec circuit fabrication, although the electronic switch<br>
].<br><br><br><br>
structure disclosed herein does not -equire such a substrate for a successful implementation.<br>
MEM micro-relays are typically 100 micrometers on a side to a lew millimeters on a side.<br>
The electronic switch substrate mist have properties (dielectric losses, voltage, etc.)<br>
compatible with the desired switch performance and amenable to a mechanical interlace with<br>
the actuator structure if fabricated separately.<br>
MEM switches are constructed using gold or nickel (or other appropriate metals) as<br>
contact material for the device. Current fabrication technology tends to limit the type of<br>
contact metals that can be used. The contacts fabricated in a conventional manner tend to<br>
have lifetimes in the millions of cycles or less. One of the problems encountered is that<br>
microscaie contacts on MEM devices tend to have very small regions of contact surface<br>
(typically 5 micrometers by 5 nicrometers). The portion of the total contact surface that is<br>
able to carry electrical current is limited by the microscopic surface roughness and the<br>
difficulty in achieving planar alignment of the two surfaces making mechanical and electrical<br>
contact. Thus, most contacts are point contacts even on a surface that would seem to have<br>
hundreds or thousands of squire micrometers of contact surface available. The high current<br>
densities in these small effecive contact_regions create microwelds and surface melting,<br>
which if uncontrolled results in impaired or_contacts. Such metallic contacts tend to<br>
have short operational lifetimes, usually in the millions of cycles.<br>
The state of the art in macro-scale relays/switches is well developed. There has been a<br>
considerable effort in developing long life contact metallurgy for the signal contacts. The<br>
signal contact life and the appropriate contact metallurgy tends to be rated by the application,<br>
such as "dry" signals (no significant current or voltage), inductive loads and high current<br>
loads.<br>
It is known in the art that electrical contacts using mercuryjehemica! symbol fig) us an enhancement for switch contact conductivii) yields kongercontacte. It is also known<br>
that the Hg enhanced contacts are capable of operating at higher current than the same contact<br><br>
structure without mercury. Mercury wetted reed switches are an example. Other examples or<br>
mercury wetted switches are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,686,875, 4,804,932, 4,652,710,<br>
4,368,442, 4,085,392 and Japanese application 03118510 (Publication No. JP04345717A).<br>
The use of mercury droplets n a miniature relay (a device which is much larger than a<br>
MEM relay) controlled by a high voltage electrostatic signal is taught in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,912,606. U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,60(1 uses the electrostatic signal on a gate to attract liquid<br>
metal drawn from a first contact to liquid metal drawn from a second contact or to draw liquid<br>
metal from both contacts to a shorting conductor mounted on the gate in order to electrically<br>
connect the contacts.<br>
A conventional vertically activated surface micromachined electrostatic MEM micro-<br>
relay 10 structure is shown in FIG. 1. The MEM micro-relay 10 includes a single substrate 30<br>
on which is micromachined a cantilever support 34. A first signal contact 50, a second signal<br>
contact 54, and a first actuator control contact 60a are disposed on the same substrate 30. The<br>
contacts have external connections (not shown) in order to connect the micro-relay to external<br>
signals. One end of a cantilever 40 is disposed on cantilever support 34. Cantilever 40<br>
includes a second actuator control contact 60b. A second end of the cantilever 40 includes a<br>
shorting bar 52. The two conducive actuator control contacts 60a and 60b control the<br>
actuation of the MEM micro-relay 10<br>
Without a control signal, the shorting bar 52 on the cantilever 40 is positioned above<br>
the substrate 30 by the support 34. With the cantilever 40 in this position, the first and second<br>
signal contacts 50 and 54 on the substrate 30 are not electronically connected. An<br>
electrostatic force created by a potential difference between the second actuator control<br>
contact 60b and the first actuator control contact 60a on substrate 30 control connection is<br><br>
the conductive shorting bar 52 to rr ake a connection between the two signal contacts 50 and<br>
54 attached to the same substrate 30 as the cantilever 40 and cantilever support 34. When<br>
pulled to the substrate 30, the shorting bar 52 touches the first and second signal contacts 50<br>
and 54 and electrically connects them together. The cantilever 40 typically has an insulated<br>
section (not shown) separating the shorting bar 52 from the cantilever electrostatic actuator<br>
control contact 60b. Thus, the first and second signal contacts 50 and 54 are connected by the<br>
cantilever 40 shorting bar 52, which is operated by an isolated electrostatic force mechanism<br>
using the two actuator control contacts 60a and 60b surfaces. The contacts 50, 54 and the<br>
shorting bar 52 typically have short operational lifetimes due to the problems described above.<br>
The micromachined electrostatic MEM micro-relay 10 is shown as a normally open<br>
(NO) switch contact structure. The open gap between the actuator control contact 60a and the<br>
cantilever beam 40 is usually a few microns (1/1,000,000 meter) wide. The gap between the<br>
shorting bar and the signal contacts s approximately the same dimension. When the switch<br>
closes, the cantilever beam 40 is closer to but not in direct electrical contact with actuator<br>
control contact 60a.<br>
If the signal contact metal is wettable with mercury, and the rest of the micro-relay is<br>
not wettable, then the mercury could be deposited on the signal metalization and allowed to<br>
flow into the active contact area under the cantilever by capillary action. The problem of<br>
mercury bridging at these close spacings must be addressed. When the mercury contacts are<br>
not contained, the contacts are subject to all the problems described in the above referenced<br>
patents including splashing and the need for liquid metal replenishment.<br>
Mercury contacts represent a major challenge for the conventional MEM switch.<br>
The typical physical separation between the contacts on the substrate and the shorting bar is a<br>
few micrometers to a few tens of micrometers. Placing mercury on the contact surfaces<br>
during the fabrication of the micro-relay requires that the chemical process be compatible<br><br>
with mercury or other liquid metals. Mercury has limited or no compatibility with typical<br>
CMOS processes used to fabricate vertical structure micro-relays.<br>
The close separation between the shorting bar and the contacts makes it difficult to<br>
insert mercury on the contacts after the micro-relay is fully operational. Applying a mercury<br>
wetting to the fully functional contact and shorting bar surfaces would be difficult, and the<br>
problem of mercury bridging at these close spacings must be overcome. All the problems<br>
known to apply to macro-scale liquid contacts will likely apply to the structure of MEM<br>
micro-relay 10. The addition of liqu d contacts to this MEM micro-relay design thus requires<br>
the use of a different construction technique and different contact systems.<br>
A vertical structure MEM relay using electrostatic actuators can be fabricated with<br>
multiple anchor points and both contact springs and release springs as an alternative to the<br>
cantilever described in FIG. 1. An example of radio frequency (RF) relay having contact and<br>
release springs is described in Micro Machined Relay for High Frequency Application,<br>
Komura et al., OMRON Corporation 47th Annual International Relay Conference (April 19-<br>
21, 1999) Newport Beach, CA., Page 12-1, and Japanese Patent Abstract, Publication number<br>
11-134998, publication date May 21, 1999.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a conventional MEM switch with a lateral actuator. The micro-relay 10'<br>
has a substrate 32 supporting a latera actuator 70 connected to a shorting bar support 44. A<br>
first conductive control contact 60a' is mounted in the housing substrate 32 and a second<br>
conductive control contact 60b' is mounted in the substrate 32. A shorting bar 52' is disposed<br>
on the shorting bar support 44. A first signal contact 50' and a second signal contact 54' are<br>
disposed on the same housing substrate 30. The shorting bar 52' places signal contacts 50'<br>
and 54' into electrical contact when the mirco-relay 10' is in a closed position.<br>
Applying liquid contacts to this conventional micro-relay structure is also difficult for<br><br>
the reasons described above. The typical physical separation between the contacts on the<br>
substrate and the shorting bar is a f'ew micrometers. This makes it difficult to insert liquid<br>
metal (e.g. mercury) on the contacts after the MEM switch is fabricated.<br>
There is a need in the art for further improvements in MEM relays eliminating the<br>
shortcomings of the existing technology. What is needed is a long life, high current, and high<br>
voltage contact structure combined with a MEM actuator to form a direct current (DC) or RF<br>
micro-relay fabricated using m cro-electromechanical (MEM) processes. In some<br>
applications there is a need to use liquid metal contacts which do not include mercury because<br>
of environmental considerations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It would be desirable to fabricate contact structures capable of withstanding several<br>
hundred volts open circuit and amperes of current closed circuit and having an operating life<br>
of at least one billion operations. for many applications, there is a need to improve the<br>
contacts of a MEM relay with the use of liquid metal. Where mercury can be used, it is<br>
possible to separately fabricate a contact substrate containing liquid metal contacts and bond<br>
the contact substrate to an actuator substrate to form a MEM relay.<br>
Liquid metal is not restricted to mercury, as many metals and conductive alloys will<br>
liquefy at usable temperatures relative to the rest of the MEM structure. Although the<br>
physical size of conventional relays makes the concept of heating the contacts or the whole<br>
relay impractical, the microscopic nature of MEM micro-relay contacts as compared to<br>
conventional relay contacts makes it feasible to heat the contact region (or the whole MEM<br>
micro-relay) in order to obtain a liquic contact operation.<br>
The need in the art is addressed by the MEM design and method of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
In accordance with the inventive teachings, a MEM relay includes an actuator, a shorting bar<br>
disposed on the actuator, a contact substrate, and a plurality of liquid metal contacts disposed<br>
on the contact substrate such that the plurality of liquid metal contacts are placed in electrical<br>
communication when the MEM relay is in a closed state. Further, the MEM relay includes a<br>
heater disposed on said contact substrate wherein said heater is in thermal communication<br>
with the plurality of liquid metal contacts. The contact substrate can additionally include a<br>
plurality of wettable metal contacts disposed on the contact substrate wherein each of the<br>
plurality of wettable metal contacts is proximate to each of the plurality of liquid metal<br>
contacts and each of the wettable metal contacts is in electrical communication with each of<br>
the plurality of liquid metal contacts.<br>
With such an arrangement the contact system can utilize contact materials compatible<br>
with MEM fabrication techniques which can be liquefied using a heater while the relay is<br>
operating at normal temperatures. The wettable metal contacts and the liquid metal contacts<br>
provide a long life, high current, and high voltage contacts for MEM relays. Additionally in<br>
certain application, the use of mercury can be avoided.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, a MEM relay includes an actuator, a non-wetting<br>
metal shorting bar disposed on the actuator, and a contact substrate, having an upper surface<br>
and a lower surface, in a spaced apart relationship with the non-wetting metal shorting bar.<br>
The MEM relay further includes a first liquid metal contact disposed on the upper surface of<br>
the contact substrate with a first signal contact disposed on the lower surface of the contact<br>
substrate, and a first via having an outside surface and an interior surface coated with liquid<br>
metal, passing through the contact substrate, and placing the first liquid metal contact and the<br>
first signal contact in electrical communication when the MEM relay is in a closed state.<br>
Finally the MEM relay includes a second liquid metal contact disposed on said upper surface<br>
of the contact substrate with second signal contact disposed on the lower surface of the<br>
contact substrate, and a second via having an outside surface and an interior surface coated<br><br>
with liquid metal, passing through said contact substrate, and placing said second liquid metal<br>
contact and said second signal contact in electrical communication when the MEM relay is in<br>
a closed state.<br>
With such an arrangement inserting liquid metal contacts into a MEM micro-relay is<br>
accomplished by taking advantage of the capillary flow of liquid metals and inserting the<br>
liquid metal after the micro-relay is fully fabricated. This method allows a MEM contact<br>
structure to be co-fabricated with the MEM actuator.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method of fabricating a<br>
MEM relay includes the steps of providing an actuator, providing a non-wetting metal<br>
shorting bar disposed on the actuatoi, providing a contact substrate, having an upper surface<br>
and a lower surface, in a spaced apart relationship with the non-wetting metal shorting bar,<br>
and providing a first liquid metal contact disposed on the upper surface of the contact<br>
substrate. The method further includes providing a first signal contact disposed on the lower<br>
surface of the contact substrate, providing a first via having an outside surface and an interior<br>
surface coated with liquid metal, passing through the contact substrate, and placing the first<br>
liquid metal contact and the first signal contact in electrical communication when the MEM<br>
relay is in a closed state, providing a second liquid metal contact disposed on the upper<br>
surface of the contact substrate. Final y the method includes providing a second signal contact<br>
disposed on the lower surface of the contact substrate, and providing a second via having an<br>
outside surface and interior coated with liquid metal, passing through the contact substrate,<br>
and placing the second liquid metsl contact and the second signal contact in electrical<br>
communication when the MEM relay is in a closed state, and introducing liquid metal through<br>
the first and second vias to wet the first and second contacts.<br>
With such a fabrication techn que, the liquid metal contacts can receive liquid metal<br>
from an external source supplied through the vias. In addition a larger quantity of liquid<br><br>
metal can form liquid metal contact s which can form a physical electrical connection without<br>
a requirement for a conductive metal shorting bar. The contacts fabricated with the inventive<br>
technique have a longer life, can carry higher currents, and can handle higher voltage signals<br>
than typical contacts used in MEM "days.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a MEM relay includes a<br>
separately fabricated contact substrate having at least two liquid metal contacts. The control<br>
substrate is bonded to an actuator substrate. With such an arrangement the contact system is<br>
fabricated separately from the actuation system, and then the two assemblies are bonded<br>
together allowing the use of liquid metal inserted on wettable metal contact surfaces or the use<br>
of liquid metal contacts which can be placed in electrical and mechanical contact. The liquid<br>
metal wetted metal contacts and the liquid metal contacts provide a long life, high current, and<br>
high voltage contacts for MEM relays.<br>
Although the inventive teach ngs are disclosed with respect to an electrical application,<br>
the present teachings may he used for other MEM relay structures and other applications as<br>
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
These and other objects, aspects, features and advantages of the invention will become<br>
more apparent from the following drawings, detailed description and claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF "HE INVENTION<br><br>
Before proceeding with a de:ailed discussion of the instant invention, some<br>
introductory concepts and tenninolcgy are explained. The term "liquid metal contact" refers<br>
to an electric contact whose mating surface during the conduction of electric current consists<br>
of a molten metal or molten metal a loy. The liquid metal contact (molten metal) will be<br>
retained (held in place) by a solid (non-molten) structure. The solid structure may be wettable<br>
so that it will retain a layer of a liqu id metal, for example mercury. The term "liquid metal<br>
contact" can also refer to a quantity of liquid metal which forms a structure, for example a<br>
droplet, which is held in place by surface tension on a metal surface of a MEM device or a<br>
retaining structure to control the position of the liquid metal. The terms switch and relay are<br>
used interchangeably.<br>
MEM devices are typically built using substrates compatible with current integrated<br>
circuit fabrication, although some of the electronic switch or relay structures disclosed herein<br>
do not require such a substrate for a successful implementation. The electronic contact<br>
substrate must have properties (dielectric losses, voltage withstanding, etc.) compatible with<br>
the desired switch performance and amenable to an interface with the electronic actuator<br>
structure if the actuator and switch portions are fabricated separately.<br>
Conventional metal contacts on MEM devices have a limited operating life. Liquid<br>
metal contacts can improve the operating life of the contact system. However, applying liquid<br>
contacts to conventional micro-relay structures is difficult. For example, the typical physical<br>
separation between the contacts on the substrate and cantilever actuator is a few micrometers.<br>
This separation makes it difficult to insert mercury on the contacts after the MEM switch is<br>
fully operational. The use of a wide spacing on the cantilever (requiring a tall cantilever<br>
support) would increase the control voltage required for operation.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, a high performance MEM relay 100 is shown as an<br><br>
integrated package. FIG. 3 shows the general construction integrated packaging for the MEM<br>
relay 100 relay without the details of the actuator or contact mechanism. The MEM relay 100<br>
includes an actuator substrate 104 and a bonded signal contact substrate 106 (also referred to<br>
as a contact region) to form the modular relay 100. The final package (not shown) is likely to<br>
be a few millimeters on a side (as required to separate an individual die from the full substrate<br>
by mechanical sawing), with current fabrication techniques for printed wiring boards and<br>
hybrid modules dictating the require! spacing between the two signal contacts 108 and 109<br>
and the two control contacts 102a anc 102b.<br>
The MEM relay 100 is arranged to provide a self-packaging micro-relay. The addition<br>
of a top and bottom cover (not shown) to the MEM relay 100 makes a complete self-<br>
packaging assembly. The placement of external connections signal contacts 108 and 109 and<br>
control contacts 102a and 102b on the exterior of the substrates permits the full assembly to<br>
be used as a surface mount component. The MEM relay 100 may also be used as part of a<br>
higher level assembly (such as a hybrid module). Fully integrated construction eliminates the<br>
need for a separate large package or internal bonding wires associated with conventional<br>
packaging techniques.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3A, an alternate embodiment based on separate actuator and<br>
contact substrates, here a vertical MEM relay 101 is shown. The vertical MEM relay 101<br>
includes an actuator substrate 112 that is assembled with a contact substrate 114 after each<br>
substrate is separately fabricated.<br>
The actuator substrate 112 includes a machined cantilever support 120 and a first<br>
actuator control contact 124a. One end of a cantilever 122 is disposed on cantilever support<br>
120 and includes a second actuator control contact 124b. The other end of the cantilever 122<br>
includes a shorting bar 123. The two conductive actuator control contacts 124a and 124b<br>
control the actuation of the vertical MEM relay 101.<br><br>
Liquid metal signal contacts 116 and 118 are fabricated on the separate contact<br>
substrate 114. The addition of liquic contacts to vertically activated MEM switches requires<br>
that the contact substrate 114 be separately fabricated from the actuator substrate 112. The<br>
liquid signal contacts 116 and 118 preferably have a liquid metal conductive surface using<br>
mercury. A separate fabrication process for the liquid metal signal contacts 116 and 118<br>
allows the quantity of liquid metal on the contact structure to be carefully controlled. The<br>
contact substrate 114 is assembled with the actuator substrate 112 after the liquid metal is<br>
applied. It should be appreciated that additional layers can be fabricated between the liquid<br>
metal signal contacts 116 and 118 and the contact substrate 114 for example a wettable metal<br>
contact and an insulating layer.<br>
In operation, with no control signal applied, the vertical MEM relay 101 is in an open<br>
position. In this position, the short ng bar 123 on the cantilever 122 is raised above the<br>
actuator substrate 112 by the support 120 and is also raised above the contact substrate 114.<br>
The first and second liquid metal signal contacts 116 and 118 on the contact substrate 114 are<br>
not connected. An electrostatic fore; created by a potential difference between the second<br>
actuator control contact 124b and the first actuator control contact 124a on the actuator<br>
substrate 112 is used to pull the cantilever 122 down toward the actuator substrate 112. It is<br>
also used to pull the cantilever 122 down to the separately fabricated contact substrate 114<br>
which is bonded to the actuator substr.ite 112.<br>
The vertical MEM relay 101 uses the conductive shorting bar 123 to make a<br>
connection between the two signal contacts 116 and 118 attached to the separate contact<br>
substrate 114. When pulled to the separate contact substrate 114, the shorting bar 123 touches<br>
liquid metal surfaces of the first and second liquid metal signal contacts 116 and 118 and<br>
electrically connects them together. The cantilever 122 typically has an insulated section (not<br>
shown) separating the shorting bar 122 from the cantilever electrostatic control contact 124b.<br><br>
Thus, the first and second liquid metal signal contacts 116 and 118 are connected by the<br>
shorting bar 123 of cantilever 122, which is operated by an isolated electrostatic force<br>
mechanism using the surfaces of thetwo actuator control contacts 124a and 124b.<br>
The vertical MEM relay 101 is shown as a normally open (NO) switch contact<br>
structure. The open gap between the conductive control contact 124a and the cantilever beam<br>
122 is typically a few microns (1/1,0(0,000 meter) wide. When the vertical MEM relay 101 is<br>
in the closed position, the cantilever beam 122 its proximate to the conductive actuator control<br>
contact 124a. However, the control surfaces, actuator control contacts 124a and 124b, cannot<br>
be in direct electrical contact or the control signal will be shorted. Since the actuator substrate<br>
112 is separately fabricated from the contact substrate 114, the liquid metal applied to the first<br>
and second liquid metal signal contacts 116 and 118 does not interfere with the conductive<br>
actuator control contact 124a and the cantilever beam 122 operation.<br>
In operation, the contact substrate 114 is precision aligned with the cantilever beam<br>
122 and the actuator substrate 112, a lowing the cantilever beam 122 and shorting bar 123 to<br>
be drawn down to the contact subsystem including liquid metal signal contacts 116 and 118<br>
fabricated on the separate contact substrate 114 and containing liquid metal. The weak forces<br>
created by a vertical electrostatic control system for the cantilever beam actuator are an<br>
additional problem. Such weak forces limit the travel available for the cantilever beam, and<br>
any wetting of the cantilever beam by the liquid contact material may create enough surface<br>
tension that the cantilever beam may be unable to draw away from the contacts. This results<br>
in a failed (shorted) micro-relay system. To abate this problem, the shorting bar 123 is<br>
preferably non-wetting.<br>
It should be appreciated that a vertical structure MEM relay using electrostatic<br>
actuators can be fabricated with multiple anchor points and both contact springs and release<br>
springs as an alternative to the cantilever beam 122. Such a multi-layer vertical structure is<br><br><br>
amenable to the use of liquid contacts, since the contact substrate is separately fabricated from<br>
the movable actuator substrate.<br>
Separate fabrication of the actuator and the switch structures is not required where<br>
mercury is not being used as the liquid contact material and a method and structure (for<br>
example a heater (not shown) disposed on the contact substrate) can be provided to prevent<br>
the liquid contact material from solicifying at operational temperatures.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, an alternate embodiment of FIG. 1, here a simplified vertical<br>
MEM relay 110 is shown. The vertical MEM relay 110 includes some of the elements of FIG<br>
1. (like elements of the relay of FIC. 1 are provided having like reference designations) and<br>
additionally includes heater 129 dispased on contact substrate 30. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
wettable metal contacts 125 and 127 are fabricated on contact substrate 30 using nickel (Ni).<br>
Liquid metal contacts 126 and 128 are disposed on wettable metal contacts 125 and 127<br>
respectively. Surface tension has a retention effect on the liquid metal on the contact surfaces.<br>
Surface tension also helps control the loss of the liquid metal due to splashing as the contact<br>
opens. Preferably, gold (Au) is used for the liquid metal contacts 126 and 128 and can be<br>
fabricated using techniques known in the art.<br>
In operation, heater 129 supp ies sufficient heat conducted to the liquid metal contacts<br>
126 and 128 to maintain a liquid or nearly liquid contact layer. The heater 129 preferably<br>
supplies sufficient heat to cause micio-melting at the liquid metal contacts 126 and 128 layer<br>
without melting the wettable metal contacts 125 and 127. With the exception of mercury,<br>
typical contact materials will solidify at normal relay operating temperatures. To obtain the<br>
benefits of liquid metal contacts using typical materials, there must be some form of heat<br>
source to maintain the molten material state during electric current flow in the micro-relay<br>
contacts. The heat source may be external or internal. It should be appreciated that an<br>
internal heat source may be a separate heater for the contact region proximate to the liquid<br><br>
metal contacts, or it may heat the whole micro-relay. The contact region can be heated by the<br>
ohmic (Joule) heat generated in the contact material as a result of electric current flow. A<br>
combination of heating methods may be simultaneously employed. A thermally controlled<br>
actuator can also generate heat. Other heating methods are known in the art and are not<br>
specifically discussed here.<br>
The presence of a moderate resistance contact when the contacts close (1 to 10 ohms<br>
or so) will hasten the contact heating;. If the contacts are torn apart during the opening process<br>
by breaking a micro-weld, the contact surface will probably be very rough. The rough surface<br>
may result in moderate contact resistance at closure. Moderate contact resistance at closure<br>
will result in rapid heating of the liquid metal contacts 126 and 128, restoring a good contact<br>
system through the formation of the liquid metal.<br>
There is reduced damage to the liquid metal contacts 126 and 128 from sliding wear<br>
during closing or opening of the MKM relay 110 because the melting action erases any sliding<br>
wear at each closure. It should be appreciated that other relay configurations using the contact<br>
structure of MEM relay 110 can be combined with electrostatic actuators fabricated with<br>
multiple anchor points and both contact springs and release springs as an alternative to the<br>
cantilever structure. Various types of contact shapes can be used including but not limited to<br>
flat surfaces and mating surfaces such as convex and concave shapes.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4A, an alternate embodiment of FIG. 4, MEM relay 110'<br>
includes separate heaters 129' disposed on the contact substrate 30 between the contact<br>
substrate 30 and the wettable metal contacts 125 and 127 and proximate to the liquid metal<br>
contacts 126 and 128. With this arrangement of heaters 129', heat can be delivered to the<br>
liquid metal contacts 126 and 128 more efficiently and with greater control.<br><br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, a lateral MEM relay 130 capable of utilizing liquid contacts<br>
is shown. The lateral MEM relay 130 can be manufactured using a separate actuator substrate<br>
140 and a contact substrate 146, which are bonded together after the application of liquid<br>
metal to the contacts on the substrate 146 if mercury is used to wet the contacts. Alternatively<br>
a heater (not shown) can be used to provide liquid metal contacts without the need for<br>
mercury or separate fabrication and bonding.<br>
A lateral MEM actuator 170 is fabricated on the actuator substrate 140. A shorting bar<br>
support 144 is connected at one end to the lateral MEM actuator 170 and to a shorting bar 132<br>
on the other end. The lateral MEM actuator 170 can have high contact make and break forces<br>
coupled with a significant travel length to make the application of liquid contacts to the lateral<br>
structure feasible when bonding the two separately fabricated structures, the actuator substrate<br>
140 and the contact substrate 146. The shorting bar 132 is preferably fabricated as a metal<br>
structure and is non-wetting.<br>
A first wettable metal signal contact 149 and a second wettable metal signal contact<br>
153 are fabricated on the contact substrate 146. If the shorting bar 132 was wetted by the<br>
liquid metal, the contact break operation would be complicated by the bridging of the liquid<br>
metal from wetting surfaces 149 and 153 to the shorting bar 132 as the shorting bar 132 was<br>
withdrawn to open the contacts. The shorting bar 132 is preferably non-wetting to avoid this<br>
problem.<br>
If a heater (not shown) is not used, liquid metal, preferably mercury is applied to the<br>
contacts during fabrication to form the liquid metal contacts 150 and 154. The wettable metal<br>
signal contacts 149 and 153 are metal structures (preferably silver if mercury is used)<br>
anchored to the contact substrate 146 or as metal attached to the wall of the contact substrate<br>
146. Preferable construction methods include bulk or surface micro-machining or deep<br>
reactive ion etching.<br><br>
A liquid metal contact 150 is disposed on the first wettable metal signal contact 149<br>
and liquid metal contact 154 is disposed on the second wettable metal signal contact 153. If a<br>
heater (not shown) is used, gold is preferably used for the liquid metal contacts 150 and 154.<br>
The wettable metal signal contacts .49 and 153 are preferably nickel structures if gold is used<br>
as the liquid metal. It should be appreciated that there are other combinations of wettable<br>
metal and liquid metals that can be used to fabricate the contact structure. The wettable metal<br>
signal contacts 149 and 153 can he insulated from the contact substrate 146 by additional<br>
insulating layers (not shown). The insulation layer is sometimes necessary because some<br>
substrates are partially conductive. An insulating substrate would not need an insulating layer<br>
if the wettable metal contacts would adhere to the insulating substrate.<br>
In operation, the actuator 170 operates to move the shorting bar 132 toward the first<br>
liquid metal contact 150 and the second liquid metal contact 154. When the shorting bar 132<br>
contacts the liquid metal surface of the liquid metal contacts 150 and 154, both the liquid<br>
metal contacts 150 and 154 and the wettable metal signal contacts 149 and 153 are electrically<br>
connected.<br>
Returning the shorting bar 132 to the state shown in FIG. 5 opens the liquid metal<br>
contacts 150 and 154 and the wettable metal signal contacts 149 and 153. The shorting bar<br>
132 is preferably non-wetting so the contact can be more efficiently broken. If the liquid metal<br>
contacts 150 and 154 were to wet the shorting bar 132, when the liquid metal contacts 150 and<br>
154 were opened the liquid meta would adhere to the shorting bar 132 and be drawn into the<br>
gap region by liquid surface tension of the liquid metal. This could prevent the contacts from<br>
opening. To abate this problem, the shorting bar 132 is preferably non-wetting.<br>
When assembled, the lateral MEM; relay 130 operates similarly to the conventional<br>
lateral actuation micro-relay previously discussed in conjunction with FIG. 2. However, the<br><br>
use of the liquid contact surfaces made possible by the separate contact structure 146 having<br>
liquid metal contacts 150 and 154 at operational temperatures or by the use of heated liquid<br>
metal contacts at lower temperatures, allows a large current carrying cross section having a<br>
very low resistance. Careful construction permits the lateral MEM relay 130 to be useful with<br>
signals at extremely high frequencies by controlling parasitic inductance and capacitance.<br>
The ability to handle high currents is a function of the losses in the contact structure resulting<br>
in heating of the liquid metal to the vaporization point. Excessive heating can be controlled by<br>
providing a low thermal resistance (and a large thermal mass) to the heat generated at the<br>
liquid contacts. In an alternate embodiment operating at low temperatures, the lateral MEM<br>
relay 130 can include a heater structure (not shown) near the liquid metal of the liquid metal<br>
contacts 150 and 154 to keep them from solidifying. A heating structure that uses positive<br>
temperature coefficient resistive materials would not necessarily require a separate<br>
temperature sensor. As the positive temperature coefficient material is heated, the increased<br>
resistance will reduce the heat generated and stabilize the contact temperature. The ohmic<br>
losses of the liquid metal contact system will also supply heat and tend to keep the contacts in<br>
the liquid state when carrying electric current.<br>
It should be appreciated that the lateral MEM relay 130 may use any of a number of<br>
techniques to achieve actuator motion. Examples include electrostatic comb actuators,<br>
magnetic actuators, piezoelectric actuators, and thermal actuators.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6. a contact region of a lateral MEM relay 160 fabricated using<br>
an alternative liquid contact filling technique is shown. The entire contact system is not<br>
shown. FIG. 6 shows an alternate stiucture for shorting bar 132 (FIG. 5) and liquid metal<br>
contacts 150 and 154 of MEM relay 130 (FIG. 5). The MEM relay 160 does not require the<br>
bonding of a separate actuator substrate and a separate contact substrate. The lateral MEM<br>
relay 160 contact structure includes a shorting bar 184 disposed on actuator 180. The shorting<br>
bar 184 is preferably fabricated having a non-wetting metal surface. A contact substrate 1 88<br><br>
includes two liquid metal contacts 85 and 186 on a surface of the contact substrate 188<br>
spaced apart from and facing the non wetting metal shorting bar 184. Preferably, the interior<br>
surface of the substrate wall has contact surfaces which are treated to have two wetting areas<br>
(not shown) for liquid metal contacts in order to retain the liquid metals. The liquid metal<br>
contacts 185 and 186 are vertical totalizations at two locations on a surface of the contact<br>
substrate 188. Each liquid metal signal contact 185 and 186 has an electrically conducting via<br>
194 connecting it to the outside edge of the contact substrate 188. Two external signal<br>
contacts 190 and 192 are disposed on an outside edge of the contact substrate 188.<br>
The vias 194 are apertures micro-machined in the substrate. The vias 194 are access<br>
paths from one side of the substrate through the substrate to the opposite side. After micro-<br>
machining, the vias 194 may be lined with metal that is wettable with the liquid contact metal<br>
to form a metal surface through the substrate. The vias 194 are placed in the contact substrate<br>
188 after dicing of the wafer holding the individual MEM devices. The vias 194 surface area<br>
are wettable to allow capillary flow to fill the contact region with liquid metal filled from an<br>
external liquid metal source through the vias 194.<br>
Following assembly, the liquid metal is applied to the outside surface at the via 194,<br>
and capillary action draws the liquid metal into the interior. The surface tension and capillary<br>
action result in the coating of the two contact areas with liquid metal. The external access to<br>
the vias 194 is then sealed, and the two external signal contacts 190 and 192 are placed on the<br>
exterior of the contact substrate 188.<br>
In operation, the metal shorting bar 184 is preferably non-wetting with the liquid<br>
metal contacts 185 and 186 to avoid bridging of the contacts when the lateral MEM relay 160<br>
is open. When the MEM relay 160 is closed, metal shorting bar 184 contacts both liquid<br>
metal signal contacts 185 and 186 and electrically connects the two external signal contacts<br>
190 and 192 through electrically conducting vias 194. A wetting of the metal shorting bar<br><br>
184 would require that the contact-to-shorting bar spacing exceeds the liquid metal surface<br>
tension bridging distance when the Literal MEM relay 160 is open.<br>
The inventive structure allows for the application of a liquid metal to the liquid metal<br>
contacts 185 and 186, following the fabrication of the MEM actuator 180 and MEM contact<br>
metalization. The use of capillary action is used to replenish the liquid metal on the liquid<br>
metal contacts 185 and 186.<br>
The metal shorting bar 184 can be fabricated with a non-wetting conductive surface<br>
that is in contact with the liquid metal surface of the liquid metal contacts 185 and 1S6. Any<br>
significant wetting of the metal shorting 184 bar may result in the formation of a liquid bridge<br>
from the liquid metal contacts 185 and 186 to the metal shorting bar 184. and the resultant<br>
failure of the liquid metal contacts 185 and 186 to open when the actuator 180 is retracted.<br>
The contact material on the liquid metal contacts 185 and 186 must be wettable to retain the<br>
liquid metal.<br>
If an optional wettable shorting bar (not shown) is used, it must be able to retract from<br>
the liquid metal contact area to the point that the surface tension of the liquid metal will break<br>
any bridging short circuits.<br>
There is preferably a defined quantity of liquid metal on each wetlable contact surface.<br>
A heating device (not shown) can be bonded to the contact substrate 188 if required to<br>
maintain the liquid metals used for the contacts in a liquid state at low operating temperatures.<br>
For example, the heater would keep Mercury from solidifying at temperatures below minus 37<br>
degrees centigrade. The heater is a positive temperature coefficient resistor, such that the<br>
heating power and liquid metal temperature are somewhat self-regulating. The heater maalso be an external device to which one or more micro-relays are in thermal contact.<br><br>
A top cover (not shown) and a bottom cover (not shown) can be bonded to the MEM<br>
relay 160 to form a sealed package on all sides, with the external signal contacts 190 and 192<br>
and control connections (not shown available on the outside surface of the MEM relay 160 to<br>
form a structure such as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The contact structure occupies the full vertical dimension of the contact substrate wall.<br>
Additionally, there are side walls that enclose the contact region with only a small clearance at<br>
the side wall for the actuator 180, such that the contact region around contact substrate 188 is<br>
effectively sealed and will minimise the splashing problem. The seal results from the surface<br>
tension of the liquid metal against the non-wetting surfaces of the substrate walls. Only the<br>
wall with the contacts is shown in FIG. 6. The complete structure is similar to the packaging<br>
arrangement as shown in conjunction with FIGs. 3 and 5.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 7, a MEM relay 200 includes a lateral actuator 228 fabricated<br>
on an actuator substrate 220 and a separately fabricated contact substrate 240. The contact<br>
substrate 240 includes liquid metal contacts 250 and 254 and external connections 244. The<br>
contact substrate 240 also includes external signal contacts 244 connected to liquid metal<br>
contacts 250 and 254 through vias 242. This structure is similar to the packaging arrangement<br>
shown in conjunction with FIG.:-.3<br>
The lateral actuator 228 s typically fabricated in a well in the middle of the actuator<br>
substrate 220, and is supported by the actuator substrate 220. The lateral actuator 228 motion<br>
is coplanar with respect to actuator fabrication substrate 220. The actuator 228 is typically<br>
able to produce force in either direction of motion (toward or away from the liquid metal<br>
contacts 250 and 254). The actuator fabrication substrate 220 has external actuator control<br>
contacts 224a and 224b for coupling a signal to control the actuator. Making these external<br>
actuator control contacts 224a and 224b for the actuator control available on the outside<br>
surface of the actuator fabrication substrate 220 enables the fabrication of a unified self-<br><br>
packaging MEM relay described above in conjunction with FIG. 3.<br>
An insulated actuator spacer 232 is connected between the lateral actuator 228 and a<br>
shorting bar 236. The purpose of the insulated actuator spacer 232 is to insure the isolation of<br>
the signal path from the actuator control path. The isolation of the signal path from the<br>
control path is not a requirement for the use of liquid metal contacts, but is commonly a<br>
requirement for useful applications of a micro-relay.<br>
The liquid metal contacts 250 and 254 and the shorting bar 236 are both preferably<br>
essentially flat surfaces. It should be appreciated that other contact surface options are<br>
possible. The MEM relay 200 is assembled by bonding the actuator substrate 220 and the<br>
separately fabricated contact substrate 240 at bonding points 238. The MEM relay 200 can<br>
include a heater 248 disposed on contact substrate 240 near the liquid metal signal contacts<br>
250 and 254 to keep them front solidifying. If mercury is not used as the liquid metal,<br>
separate fabrication and bonding of the actuator substrate 220 and the contact substrate 240 is<br>
not required. The use of vias 242 is not required if the liquid metal contacts 250 and 254 are<br>
electrically connected to the external connections 244 through the use of an additional metal<br>
path (not shown).<br>
Referring now to FIG. I!, an alternate MEM relay 258 has a shorting bar 262 and<br>
contact structure 276 configurat on using liquid contacts. The contact substrate 276 includes<br>
wettable metal contacts 264 and 265. The wettable metal contacts 264 and 265 connect to<br>
external signal contacts 278 through vias 280. Liquid metal contacts 274 and 275 are<br>
disposed on the wettable metal contacts 264 and 265. The actuator (not shown) is connected<br>
to an actuator insulating spacer 268.<br>
The insulating spacer 258 can be connected to a second shorting bar (not shown) at<br>
both ends and contact assemblies at both ends (only one end is shown in FIG. 8) will allow<br><br>
the fabrication of a MEM relay 258: with dual and opposing contact sets, so the MEM relay<br>
258 can have one or the other set of contacts always closed, but not both at once. This allows<br>
the construction of a single pole double throw switch for the MEM relay 258 (sometimes<br>
referred to as Form C in current relay terminology). The use of an actuator with a three<br>
position capability (active left, rest center, active right) will permit an alternative MEM relay<br>
configuration to be developed, providing none, or one of the two contact sets to be activated.<br>
The shorting bar 262 now has a conic depression or a V-shaped depression on the<br>
metalized side, and gas vents 260 to allow trapped gas to escape from the region between the<br>
shorting bar 262 and the liquid metal contacts 274 and 275. Gas vents 260 are not needed if<br>
the gas pressure does not need to be squalized, or if the switching speed does not need to be<br>
maximized. The V-shaped structure shorting bar 262 includes open ends that allow the gas to<br>
escape. The liquid metal is prevented from escaping through the gas venting mechanism. The<br>
gas vents 260 are small enough to a low trapped gas to be vented, but not large enough to<br>
allow internal pressure on the liquid metal to overcome the surface tension of the liquid metal<br>
and force liquid metal through the gas vents 290.<br>
In one embodiment a slight excess of liquid metal is placed on the contacts 274 and<br>
275, and the shorting bar 262 forces the liquid of liquid metal contact 274 to touch the liquid<br>
of the liquid metal contact 275. FIG 8 shows MEM relay 258 with the contacts open, and<br>
FIG. 9 shows MEM relay 258 with the contacts closed.<br>
Now referring to FIG. 9, the MEM relay 258 of FIG. 8 is shown in a closed position.<br>
When the shorting bar 262 moves toward and contacts the liquid metal contacts 274 and 275,<br>
the signal circuit, including external signal contacts 278 connected through vias 280, is closed.<br>
When the actuator (not shown) moves the shorting bar 262 toward the contacts 274 and 275,<br>
the liquid metal contacts 274 and 275 are partially displaced and moved toward the region<br>
between the liquid contacts 274 and 275. When enough contact liquid is moved into the<br><br>
volume between the liquid metal cortacts 274 and 275, the contact liquid forms an additional<br>
current path between the wettable metal contacts 264 and 265 in shunt with the non-wetting<br>
shorting bar metal 262. This contact structure provides two paths for electrically connecting<br>
external signal contacts 278 together, one from liquid metal contact 274 through the shorting<br>
bar 262 to liquid metal contact 275, and the second directly through liquid metal contact 274<br>
in direct physical contact with liquid metal contact 275, through the metal shorting bar 264.<br>
Now referring to FIG. 10, a MEM relay 286, an alternative embodiment of MEM relay<br>
258, has sufficient liquid metal in the liquid metal contacts 274 and 275, so that the non-<br>
wetting metal shorting bar 262, (FIG.9) can be eliminated and the contact process is<br>
completely within the liquid metal which makes the contact. A conic or V shaped liquid<br>
motion bar 292 without a shorting bad 262 is disposed on actuator substrate 290. The liquid<br>
motion bar 292 is a non-conductive mechanical structure used to force the two liquid metal<br>
structures 274 and 275 of FIG. 8 to combine into one conductive structure as shown.<br>
In operation the conic or V shaped liquid motion bar 292 disposed on actuator<br>
substrate 290 pushes the liquid metal contacts 274 and 275 together and controls the splashing<br>
of the liquid as the liquid motion bar 292 is moved into the liquid. When the liquid metal<br>
contacts 274 and 275 are mechanically pushed together they are in electrical contact. If the<br>
liquid is forced to splash inward, there is no liquid loss from the contact area and the operating<br>
life of the MEM relay 286 is extended. The gas vents 260 must be small enough to prevent<br>
the escape of the contact liquid. The surface tension of the contact liquid is a significant<br>
factor in controlling liquid escape through the vents.<br>
The actuator (not shown) has a retraction force capability as well as the ability to push<br>
the liquid motion bar 292 into the liquid metal. Thus, the actuator participates in both closing<br>
the signal path between the contacts and opening the signal path between the contacts.<br><br>
MEM relay 286 can include a heater (not shown) disposed on contact substrate 276<br>
near the liquid metal signal contacts 274 and 275 to keep them from solidifying.<br>
Referring now to FIGs. 11 and 12, a MEM relay 300 is a modified version of the<br>
MEM relays 258 and 286 with an open system contact structure as shown in FIGs. 8, 9, and<br>
10. MEM relay 300 includes a closed contact region and actuator structure having a sealed<br>
liquid metal contact system. FIG. 11 shows the MEM relay 300 in an open position.<br>
The MEM relay 300 includes a sealed liquid metal contact system including actuator<br>
310 which is spaced apart from a non-wetting metal shorting membrane 316 when the MEM<br>
relay 300 is in an open position. The non-wetting metal shorting membrane 316 can include a<br>
set of gas vents 314.<br>
A set of wettable contacts 31H and 319 are fabricated in a shallow well in the contact<br>
substrate 324. A flexible membrane 316 has been placed over the contact area. There are<br>
small gas vents 314 in the flexible membrane 316 to allow for pressure equalization during<br>
switch operation, and as a result of temperature changes. The gas vents 314 are small enough<br>
so the surface tension of the liquid metal contacts 320 and 322 does not allow the liquid metal<br>
to escape through the gas vents 314. Gas vents 314 are not required if there is no need to<br>
equalize pressures or increase the speed of the switching time of the switching action. The<br>
actuator 310 pushes the membrane 316 into the liquid metal contacts 320 and 322 to close the<br>
MEM relay 300, as shown in FIG. 12. Preferably the membrane 316 is conductive, and the<br>
membrane 316 electrically contacts each of the liquid metal contacts 320 and 322 to close the<br>
MEM relay 300. In alternate embodiment having a non-conductive membrane 316, the<br>
actuator 310 pushes on the membrane 316 with sufficient force to cause the two liquid metal<br>
contacts 320 and 322 to come together to close the MEM relay 300. Fig 12 shows the two<br>
liquid metal contacts 320 and 322 forced together. It should be noted that if the membrane 316<br>
is conductive, MEM relay 300 will be closed before the two liquid metal contacts 320 and 322<br>
come into contact with each other. Typically, the membrane 316 should be non-<br><br>
wetting to avoid bridging of the contact system. The MEM relay 300 is opened by<br>
withdrawing the actuator 310, which releases the force holding the two liquid metal contacts<br>
320 and 322 by the restoration spring force of the membrane 316, together and allows surface<br>
tension to restore the two liquid metal contacts to a non-connecting state. The liquid metal<br>
contacts 320 and 322 must be placed far apart: enough that the surface tension of the liquid<br>
metal will result in separation of the liquid metal into two separate liquid metal contacts 320<br>
and 322 when the MEM relay 300 is opened.<br>
The main escape mechanism for the liquid metal used in the liquid metal contacts 320<br>
and 322 is through vaporization and uscape through the gas vents 314. If there is a significant<br>
reservoir of the liquid metal, the life of the liquid metal contacts 320 and 322 is greatly<br>
extended. The rest of the MEM relay 300 must not be degraded by the recondensing of the<br>
liquid metal vapor onto the various .surfaces of the interior. If the MEM relay 300 is fully<br>
sealed, as previously described, there is no external release of the liquid metal vapor. If the<br>
contact region is sealed, without gas vents 314, then there is no escape of the liquid metal<br>
vapor outside of the sealed contact region.<br>
FIG. 12 shows the MEM relay 300 contact region and actuator structure of FIG. 11 in a<br>
closed position with the non-wetting metal shorting membrane 316 forcing the two liquid<br>
metal contacts 320 and 322 together tc close the MEM relay 300. This contact structure could<br>
be substituted for the contact structure used in the MEM relay 130 of FIG. 5, replacing the<br>
shorting bar 132 and liquid metal contacts 150 and 154 (FIG. 5).<br>
MEM relay 300 can include a heater (not shown) disposed on contact substrate 324<br>
near the liquid metal contacts 320 and 322 to keep the liquid metal contacts 320 and 322 from<br>
solidifying in low temperature conditions.<br>
Now referring to FIG. 13, a single contact sealed structure MEM relay 335 contact<br>
region including an actuator substrate 310 and contact substrate 324 is shown. MEM relay<br><br>
335 includes a single wettable metal signal contact 352 spaced apart from a non-wetting but<br>
conductive membrane 342 disposed on the contact substrate 324. A liquid metal contact 346<br>
is deposited in the single wettable metal contact 352. External signal contacts 340 are<br>
disposed on the non-wetting but conductive membrane 342. Gas vents 314 are disposed on the<br>
non-wetting but conductive membrane 342. A set of vias 328 are disposed on the contact<br>
substrate 324. An external signal contact 350 is disposed on the contact substrate 324 and<br>
electrically connected to the wettable metal signal contact 352 through the vias 328.<br>
In operation, the actuator 310 pushes the membrane 342 into the liquid metal contact<br>
346 to close the MEM relay 335. The membrane 342 is conductive, and it touches the liquid<br>
metal contact 346 to close the MEM relay 335. Closing the MEM relay 335 electrically<br>
connects the external signal contacts 340 and 350. The MEM relay 335 is opened by<br>
withdrawing the actuator 310, which releases the force holding the membrane against the<br>
liquid metal contact 346 and allows surface tension to restore the liquid metal contact 346 to a<br>
non-connecting state. The gas vents 314 allow pressure equalization and prevent the escape<br>
of the liquid metal.<br>
MEM relay 335 can include a heater (not shown) disposed on contact substrate 324<br>
near the liquid metal contact 346 to keep it from solidifying, in low temperature conditions.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 14, a lateral sliding liquid metal contact system MEM relay 350<br>
is shown. The liquid metal contact MEM relay 350 includes a lateral actuator 366 which is<br>
disposed within an actuator fabrication substrate 362 and connected to a conductive sliding<br>
non-wetting shorting bar 370 by means of an insulated actuation arm 368. The actuator<br>
fabrication substrate 362 has external actuator control contacts 364a and 364b for coupling a<br>
signal to control the actuator 366.<br>
MEM relay 350 also includes contact fabrication substrate 380 that can either be bonded to or<br><br>
co-fabricated with actuator fabrication substrate 362. A set of liquid metal contacts 372 and<br>
373 separated by insulators 382 are all disposed on the contact fabrication substrate 380. A<br>
pair of signal contacts 374 and 376 are fabricated on the surface of the contact fabrication<br>
substrate 380 and are electrically connected to the two liquid metal contacts 372 and 373<br>
respectively.<br>
In operation, the non-wetting; shorting bar 370 can slide across two liquid metal<br>
contacts 372 and 373 which are separated and contained by insulators 382 on the sides and by<br>
the contact fabrication substrate 380 below. The non-wetting shorting bar 370 moves parallel<br>
to a plane formed by the two liquid motal contacts 372 and 373.<br>
As the lateral actuator 366 changes the position of the shorting bar, it alternately<br>
engages both the liquid contacts 372 and 373 to complete the electrical circuit or engages only<br>
one (or none) of the liquid contacts 372 and 373 to open the circuit. The non-wetting shorting<br>
bar 370 slides along the top surface of the (non-wetting) insulators 382 separating the two<br>
liquid metal contacts 372 and 373. If the sliding shorting bar 370 is wettable and is wetted by<br>
the liquid metal contacts 372 and 373, friction and wear may be reduced and there may be<br>
improved conduction due to liquid metal-to-liquid metal contact, but liquid metal bridging<br>
between the contacts 372 and 373 must be prevented. The bridging problem is overcome by<br>
an adequate spacing between the two liquid metal contacts 372 and 373, a sufficient lateral<br>
actuator 366 throw length, and an adequate surface tension of the liquid metal. The non-<br>
wetting properties of the contact fabrication substrate 380 are also important in overcoming<br>
the bridging problem.<br>
This system can be sealed if there is a flexible sealing membrane (not shown) between<br>
the sliding non-wetting shorting bar 370 and the actuator insulator. Such a sealing membrane<br>
(not shown) will separate the actuation sections: from the liquid metal sections. This will<br>
control the migration of the liquid mete1 out of the contact section into the actuator fabrication<br>
substrate 362.<br>
It should be appreciated that contact structure of MEM relay 350 can be adapted to a<br><br>
variety of actuators, and to a variety of actuator motions.<br>
It should also be appreciated that there are other configurations of the MEM relay 350<br>
which can include, in one embodiment, a contact heating system 384 in thermal contact with<br>
the contact fabrication substrate 380. A top cover 360 and a bottom cover 386 can enclose the<br>
MEM relay 350.<br>
It should be appreciated that while the above embodiments have generally been shown<br>
as having two liquid metal contacts ir preferred embodiments, the MEM relays can be<br>
fabricated with alternate shorting bar and contact configurations to provide, for example,<br>
multiple contact MEM relays. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous contact<br>
and actuator configurations are achievable the using MEM relay fabrication techniques<br>
described below.<br>
