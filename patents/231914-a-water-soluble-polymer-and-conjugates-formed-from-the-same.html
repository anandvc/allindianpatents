				<td>The present invention relates to a water-soluble polymer and conjugates formed from the same.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to particular maleimide-terminated water soluble polymers, and to methods for making and utilizing such polymers. In particular, the invention relates to: (i) hydrolytically stabilized polymers having one or more terminal maleimide groups, (ii) conjugates formed from the attachment of a maleimide-terminated water soluble polymer reagent as described herein to another substance, such as an active agent or surface, (iii) methods for synthesizing such polymeric reagents, (iv) compositions comprising the polymeric reagents, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Due to recent advances in biotechnology, therapeutic proteins and other biomolecules, e.g. antibodies and antibody fragments, can now be prepared on a large scale, making such biomolecules more widely available. Unfortunately, the clinical usefulness of potential therapeutic biomolecules is often hampered by their rapid proteolytic degradation, low bioavailability, instability upon manufacture, storage or administration, or by their immunogenicity. Due to the continued interest in administering proteins and other biomolecules for therapeutic use, various approaches to overcoming these deficiencies have been explored.<br>
One such approach which has been widely explored is the modification of proteins and other potentially therapeutic molecules by covalent attachment of a water soluble polymer such as polyethylene glycol or "PEG" (Abuchowski, A., et al, J. Biol.Chem. 252 (11), 3579 (1977); Davis, S., et al., Clin.Exp Immunol., 46, 649-652 (1981). The biological properties of PEG-modified proteins, also referred to as PEG-conjugates or pegylated proteins, have been shown, in many cases, to be considerably improved over those of their non-pegylated counterparts (Herman, et al., Macromol. Chem. Phys., 195, 203-209 (1994). Polyethylene glycol-modified proteins have been shown to possess longer circulatory times in the body due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation, and also to possess increased thermostability (Abuchowski, A., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 252,3582-3586 (1977). A similar increase in bioefficacy is<br><br><br>
observed with other biomoJecules, e.g. antibodies and antibody fragments (Chapman, A., Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 54, 531-545 (2002)).<br>
Typically, attachment of polyethylene glycol to a drug or other surface is accomplished using an activated PEG derivative, that is to say, a PEG having at least one activated terminus suitable for reaction with a nucleophilic center of a biomolecule (e.g., lysine, cysteine and similar residues of proteins). Most commonly employed are methods based upon the reaction of an activated PEG with protein amino groups, such as those present in the lysine side chains of proteins. Polyethylene glycol having activated end groups suitable for reaction with the amino groups of proteins include PEG-aldehydes (Harris, J. M., Herati, R.S., Polym Prepr. (Am. Cheat. Soc., Div. Polym. Chem), 32(1), 154-155 (1991), mixed anhydrides, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, carbonylimadazolides, and chlorocyanurates (Herman, S., et al., Macromoi. Chem. Phys. 195, 203-209 (1994)). Although many proteins have been shown to retain activity during PEG modification, in some instances, polymer attachment through protein amino groups can be undesirable, such as when derivatization of specific iysine residues inactivates the protein (Suzuki, T., et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 788, 248-255 (1984)). Moreover, since most proteins possess several available/accessible amino groups, the polymer conjugates formed are typically mixtures of mono-pegylated, di-pegylated, tri-pegylated species and so on, which can be difficult and also time-consuming to characterize and separate. Further, such mixtures are often not reproducibly prepared, which can create problems during scale-up for regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization.<br>
One method for avoiding these problems is to employ a site-selective polymer reagent that targets functional groups other than amines.   One particularly attractive target is the thiol group on proteins, present in the amino acid, cysteine. Cysteines are typically less abundant in proteins than lysines, thus reducing the likelihood of protein deactivation upon conjugation to these thiol-containing amino acids. Moreoever, conjugation to cysteine sites can often be carried out in a well-defined manner, leading to the formation of single species polymer-conjugates.<br>
Polyethylene glycol derivatives having a thiol-selective reactive end group include maleimides, vinyl sulfones, iodoacetamides, thiols, and disulfides, with maleimides being the most popular. These derivatives have all been used for coupling to the cysteine side chains of proteins (Zalipsky, S. Bioconjug. Chem. 6, 150-165 (1995), Greenwald, R. B. et al. Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Garner Syst. 17, 101-161<br><br>
(2000); Herman, S., et at., Macromoi. Cliem. Phys, 195, 203-209 (1994)). However, many of these reagents have not been widely exploited due to the difficulty in their synthesis and purification.<br>
As discussed above, polyethylene glycol derivatives having a terminal maleirnide group are one of the most popular types of sulfhydryl-selective reagents, and are commercially available from a number of sources. Although not widely appreciated or recognized, the Applicants have recognized that many PEG-maleimides unfortunately are hydrolytically unstable during storage and conjugation to a drug candidate.  More particularly, a substantial degree of hydrolysis of the nialeimide ring has been observed, both prior to and after conjugation. This instability can result in the formation of multiple species of drug conjugates within a drug-conjugate composition. The various drug conjugate species are likely to possess similar biological activities, but may differ in their pharmacokinetic properties, making such compositions undesirable for patient administration. Additionally, separation of the open-ring and closed-ring forms of the drug conjugate can be extremely difficult to carry out. Moreover, such hydro]ytic instability can lead to inconsistency in drug batches. Thus, the applicants have realized a continuing need in the art for the development of new activated PEGs useful for coupling to biologically active molecules, desirably in a site-selective fashion, that are stable during both storage and coupling. This invention meets those needs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a unique family of hydrolytically stabilized maleirnide--terminated polymers, where the polymers comprise particular linkers interposed between a polymer segment and a maleirnide group.<br>
The invention is based on the discovery that the incorporation of a saturated acyclic, cyclic, or alicydic hydrocarbon linker adjacent to the maleirnide ring of a maleimidc-terminated polymer substantially reduces its instability.   Provided herein are polymers having a hydrolytically stabilized maleirnide ring, their polymer precursors, conjugates of the hydrolytically stabilized maleimide-terminated polymers, and methods For making and using such polymers and their conjugates.<br>
Generally, the present invention is directed to a water soluble polymer having the structure:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In the generalized structure above, POLY is a water soluble polymer segment, and L is a linkage that imparts hydrolytical stability to the adjacent maleimide ring. Typically the linker comprises a saturated acyclic, cyclic or alicyclic hydrocarbon chain adjacent to the maleimide ring and contains a total of about 3 to about 20 carbon atoms, optionally containing other non-interfering atoms or functional groups.<br>

In one embodiment, POLY is directly covalently bonded to the amide carbonyl carbon, optionally via an intervening oxygen ([OJt,) to form a carbamate group. In an alternative embodiment, POLY is connected to the amide carbonyl carbon, optionally via an intervening oxygen, ([O]) in the instance when b=l, via an intervening spacer, for example, a methylene.<br>
In one embodiment, X is a saturated acyclic, cyclic or alicyclic hydrocarbon chain having a total of about 3 to about 20 carbon atoms.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular polymers, synthetic techniques, active agents, and the like as such may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
In describing and claiming the present invention, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions described below.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
The following terms as used herein have the meanings indicated. As used in the specification, and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an"', "the", include plural referents unless Ihe context clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
"PEG" or "polyethylene glycol)" as used herein, is meant to encompass any water-soluble polyethylene oxide). Typically, PEGs for use in the present invention will comprise one of the two following structures: "-(CH2CH2O)n-" or "-(CH2CH2O)n_ iCHnCH-i-," depending upon whether or not the terminal oxygen(s) has been displaced, e.g., during a .synthetic transformation. The variable (n) ranges from 3 to 3000, and the terminal groups and architecture of the overall PEG may vary. When PEG further comprises a linker moiety (to be described in greater detail below), the atoms comprising the linker, when covalently attached to a PEG segment, do not result in formation of (j) an oxygen-oxygen bond (-O-O-, a peroxide linkage), or (ii) a nitrogen-oxygen bond (N-O, O-N). "PEG" means a polymer that contains a majority, that is to say, greater than 50%, of subunits that are -QEkCHaO-. PEGs for use in the invention include PEGs having a variety of molecular weights, structures or geometries (e.g., branched, linear, forked PEGs, dendritic, and the like), to be described in greater detail below.<br>
"PEG diol", also known as alpha-,omega-dihydroxylpoly(ethylene glycol), can be represented in brief form as HO-PEG-OH, where PEG is as defined above.<br>
"Water-soluble", in the context of a polymer of the invention or a "water-soluble polymer segment" is any segment or polymer that is soluble in water at room temperature. Typically, a water-soluble polymer or segment will transmit at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 95% of light, transmitted by the same solution after filtering. On a weight basis, a water-soluble polymer or segment thereof will preferably be at least about 35% (by weight) soluble in water, more preferably at least about 50% (by weight) soluble in water, still more preferably about 70% (by weight) soluble in water, and still more preferably about 85% (by weight) soluble in water. It is most preferred, however, that the water-soluble polymer or segment is about 95% (by weight) soluble in water or completely soluble in water.<br>
An "end-capping" or "end-capped" group is an inert or non-reactive group present on a terminus of a polymer such as PEG. An end-capping group is one that does not readily undergo chemical transformation under typical synthetic reaction conditions. An end capping group is generally an alkoxy group, -OR, where R is an organic radical comprised of 1 -20 carbons and is preferably lower alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl) or benzyl.   "'R" may be saturated or unsaturated, and includes aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and substituted forms of any of the foregoing. Eor instance, an<br>
end capped PEC] will typically comprise the structure "RCH'CHiCHiOv", where R is as defined above. Alternatively, the end-capping group can also advantageously compose a detectable label. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a detectable label, the amount or location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) to which the polymer is coupled, can be determined by using a suitable-detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, and the like. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a phospholipid. When the polymer has an end-capping group such as a phospholipid, unique properties (such as the ability to form organized structures with similarly end-capped polymers) are imparted to the polymer. Exemplary phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the class of phospholipids called phosphatidylcholines. Specific phospholipids include, without limitation, those .selected from the group consisting of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, disteroylphosphatidylcholine, behenoylphosphatidylcholine, arachidoylphosphatidyicholine, and lecithin.<br>
"Non-naturally occurring" with respect to a polymer of the invention means a polymer that in its entirety is not found in nature. A non-naturally occurring polymer of the invention may however contain one or more subunits or segments of subunits (hat are naturally occurring, so long as the overall polymer structure is not found in nature.<br>
"Molecular mass" in the context of a water-soluble polymer of the invention such as PEG, refers to the nominal average molecular mass of a polymer, typically determined by size exclusion chromatography, light scattering techniques, or intrinsic velocity determination in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. The polymers of the invention are typically polydisperse, possessing low polydispersity values of less than about 1.20.<br>
The term "reactive" or "activated" refers to a functional group that reacts readily or at a practical rate under conventional conditions of organic synthesis. This is in contrast to those groups that either do not react or require strong catalysts or impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e., a "nonreactive" or "inert" group).<br>
"Not readily reactive" or "inert" with reference to a functional group present on a molecule in a reaction mixture, indicates that the group remains largely intact under conditions effective to produce a desired reaction in the reaction mixture.<br>
A "protecting group" is a moiety that prevents or blocks reaction of a particular chemically reactive functional group in a molecule under certain reaction conditions. The protecting group will vary depending upon the type of chemically reactive group being protected as well as the reaction conditions to be employed and the presence of additional reactive or protecting groups in the molecule. Functional groups which may be protected include, by way of example, carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, thiol groups, carbonyl groups and the like. Representative protecting groups for carboxylic acids include esters (such as a /;~methoxybenzyl ester), amides and hydrazides; for amino groups, carbamates (such as fe/v-butoxycarbonyl) and amides; for hydroxyl groups, ethers and esters; for thiol groups, thioethers and thioesters; for carbonyl groups, acetals and ketals; and the like. Such protecting groups are well-known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in T.W. Greene and G.M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein.<br>
A functional group in "protected form" refers to a functional group bearing a protecting group. As used herein, the term "functional group" or any synonym thereof is meant to encompass protected forms thereof.<br>
The term "linker" is used herein to refer to an atom or a collection of atoms optionally used to link interconnecting moieties, such as a polymer segment and a maleimide. The linkers of the invention are generally hydrolytically stable.<br>
A "physiologically cleavable" or "hydrolyzable" or "degradable" bond is a relatively weak bond that reacts with water (i.e., is hydrolyzed) under physiological conditions. The tendency of a bond to hydrolyze in water will depend not only on the general type of linkage connecting two central atoms but also on the substituents attached to these central atoms. Appropriate hydrolytically unstable or weak linkages include but are not limited to carboxylate ester, phosphate ester, anhydrides, acetals, ketals, acyloxyalkyl ether, imines, orthoesters, peptides and oligonucleotides, thioesters, thiolesters, and carbonates.<br>
An "enzymatically degradable linkage" means a linkage that is subject to degradation by one or more enzymes.<br>
A "hydrolytically stable" linkage or linker, for the purposes of the present invention, and in particular in reference to the polymers of the invention, refers to an atom or to a collection of atoms, that is hydrolytically stable under normal physiological conditions. That is to say, a hydrolytically stable linkage does not<br>
undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions to any appreciable extent over an extended period of time. Examples of hydrolytically stable linkages include but are not limited to the following: carbon-carbon bonds (e.g., in aliphatic chains), ethers, amides, urethanes, amines, and the like. Hydrolysis rates of representative chemical bonds can be found in most standard chemistry textbooks.<br>
A "hydrolytically stabilized rnaleimide ring", in reference to a polymer of the invention, is one that resists hydrolysis of the maieiirude ring in comparison to the ting opening-stability of its linkerless polymer rnaleimide counterpart. For example, if a subject water soluble rnaleimide has a structure CH3O-(CH2CH2O)5K-CH2CH2-QOJ-NH-C^-U-QHio-CHrMAL, where the linker is -C(O)-NH-CH2-l,3-C6H,o-CH?-, then the corresponding linkerless version to form a basis for comparison is CH3O-(CH2CH2O)5K-CH?CH2-MAL. Typically, such hydrolysis evaluations are carried out at pM 7.5 in phosphate buffer at room temperature and are measured by observing the IIV absoiption of the rnaleimide ring. So, a hydrolytically stabilized rnaleimide ring contained in a polymer reagent of the invention is one that has a degree of hydrolytic stability that is improved over that of its linkerless counterpart. Preferably, a hydrolytically stabilized rnaleimide ring in accordance with the invention results in a stabilized polymer rnaleimide having a hydrolysis half-life under the above-described conditions of at least about 16 hours, and more preferably of at least about 20 hours.<br>

STABILIZED POLYMER MALE1MIDES - GENERAL FEATURES<br>
The present invention provides water-soluble and non-peptidic polymers whose maleimide rings are hydrolytically stable in comparison to their linkerless maleimide counterparts. Generally, the feature of resistance to hydrolysis, i.e., with regard to the maleimide ring, is imparted by the introduction of a linker between the polymer segment and the maleimide.   Typically, the linker comprises a saturated acyclic, cyclic, or alicyclic hydrocarbon chain covalently attached to, and immediately adjacent to, the nitrogen atom of the maleimide. The structure and size of the hydrocarbon chain, which may comprise alkylene groups, cycloalkyl groups, or<br>
combinations thereof, in either substituted or non-substituted form, is designed to retard ring opening of the maleimide by i) providing sufficient distance between the maleirmde and any electron withdrawing groups in the linker or the polymer segment, thereby enabling electron release to the maleimide ring, and/or ii) providing steric hindrance to the hydrolytic process. In this manner, the linkers described herein stabilize the maJeimide ring against hydrolysis and resultant ring-opening. Thus, the maleimide-terminated polymers of the invention exhibit greater stability, e.g., upon synthesis, isolation, and storage, and can be conjugated to biologically active molecules over a wider range of pH values without producing significant amounts of open-ring conjugates.   Hydrolysis data provided herein is indicative of this point. The synthesis of representative stabilized polymer maleimides is described in Examples I, II, III, IV, V, IX, X, XI, and XH. As can be seen, linear acyclic, branched acyclic, and alicyclic linkers are all effective in enhancing the stability of the adjacent maleimide ring. Hydrolysis data illustrative of this feature for both the polymer reagents and their corresponding conjugates is provided in Examples VII, VIII, and XI11.<br>
The linkers as described in greater detail below may also include one or more non-hydrocarbon yet hydrolytically stable and non-reactive atoms or collection of atoms, such as hydroxyl, sulfur, oxygen, and the like.<br>
The maleimide-functionalized polymers of the invention are preferably hydrolytically stable over a wide pH range, such as from about 5 to about 10. In particular, most preferably, the reactive polymer maleimides of the invention are hydro]ytically stable at pHs suitable for conjugation to thiol or amino groups on biologically active molecules, such as proteins. For example, the polymers of the invention are preferably resistant to hydrolysis-induced maleimide ring opening (i.e., are not prone to formation of maleimic acid if unconjugated or formation of succinamidic acid if conjugated) at pHs ranging from about 7 to about 10, and more preferably at pHs from about 7 to about 8.5. As defined herein, a hydrolytically stable maJeimide is one in which the half-life of the maleimide at 25°C and a pH of 7.5 in an aqueous medium (e.g., phosphate buffer) is at least about 16 hours, more preferably at least about 20 hours, most preferably at least about 28 hours.<br>
The half-life of a polymer maleimide can be determined by measuring the concentration of the maleimide-terminated polymer over time using HPLC or by observing the UV absorption of the maleimide ring.<br>
Tlu; saturated acyclic, cyclic, or ahcyclic hydrocarbon linker adjacent to the maleimide group preferably has a chain length of at least 3 carbon atoms and contains at least 3 contiguous carbon atoms. More preferably, the linker possesses at least about 4 carbon atoms, most preferably at least about 5 or 6 carbon atoms. The chain length is measured as the number of carbon atoms forming the shortest atom chain linking the nitrogen atom of the maleimide to the polymer segment. Typically, the total number of carbon atoms in the linker including chain substituents, ranges from 4 to about 20 atoms, preferably 4 to about 12 atoms, more preferably 4 to about 10 atoms and most preferably 5 to about 8 atoms. The invention includes linkers having, for example, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, i 1, and 12 total carbon atoms.<br>
GENERAL STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE POLYMER MALEIMIDE<br>
Generally speaking, the reactive polymers of the invention possesses a water soluble polymer segment that is connected to a maleimide ring via a hydrolytically stable linker. The hydrolytically stable linker is effective to impart hydrolytic stability to the maleimide ring to which it is directly covalently attached. More particularly, the polymer segment, referred to herein generally as POLY, is covalently attached to the hydrolytically stable linker, X, via an intervening -O-, -C(O)-NH-, or O-C(O)-NH- group. X typically contains at least 3 contiguous saturated carbon atoms. Preferably although not necessarily, the resultant polymer maleimide is absent aromatic groups and ester linkages.<br>
Also provided herein are polymers having both the generalized and specific illustrative structural features described for the stabilized polymer maleimides, with the exception that the maleimide ring is replaced by an amino group, preferably a primary ammo group. Thus, all structures and descriptions herein directed towards maleimide terminated polymer reagents should be extended to their ammo-terminated counterparts as described above.<br>
The linker, X, typically contains from about 1 to about 20 carbon atoms. Generally, X is a hydrocarbon chain possessing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, however, in certain embodiments, X may contain additional non-reactive atoms or functional groups such as hydroxyi groups, ethers, thioethers, or other non-reactive groups. Preferably, such groups or atoms are positioned remote from the maleimide ring. More preferably, such non-reactive atoms or groups are positioned a distance of at leas!. 4 carbons from the maleimide nitrogen. Even more preferably, such<br>
additional non-reactive atoms or groups contained in X are positioned at least 4 carbons, at least 5 carbons or at least 6 carbons or more distant from the maleimide nitrogen. Such groups are more likely to be contained within cycloalkyl or alicyclic X's than in their acyclic counterparts, simply due to their presence in many commercially available starting materials.<br>
A polymer maleimide of the invention is generally characterized by the following formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where b is 0 or 1. In structure 1, when both the carbonyl and -NH groups are absent (i.e., each subscript is equal to zero), b is equal to 1. Features of the linker X are described and exemplified in greater detail in the section that follows.<br>
THE LINKER MOIETY<br>
As mentioned previously, the linker, X, comprises a saturated acyclic or cyclic or alicyclic hydrocarbon moiety adjacent to the nitrogen atom of the maleimide ring. The size and structure of X is designed to improve the hydrolytic stability of the maleimide ring, generally by increasing the distance between the maleimide ring and electron withdrawing groups present in the molecule or by providing steric hindrance 10 the maleimide hydrolysis reaction. Typically, X contains a total of about 3 to about 20 carbon atoms. More particularly, X can possess a total number of carbon atoms selected from the group consisting of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Preferred ranges for total number of carbon atoms in the linker X are from about 3 to about 20, or from about 4 to about 12, or from about 4 to about 10, or from about 5 to about 8 atoms.<br>
Exemplary hydrocarbon linkages include straight chain saturated acyclic hydrocarbons comprising at least 3 contiguous carbon atoms, such as trimethylene, tetramethyJene, pentamethylene, and hexamethylene, and so forth. That is to say, in iis simplest form, X equals ~(CH:)V, where y ranges from 3 to about 20. That is to<br><br>
say, Y may possess any of the following values: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, !9, or 20. Alternatively, X can be branched, i.e., can contain one or even two substituents, at any one or more of the carbon positions in the chain. That is to say, X can be branched at the carbon a to the maleimidyl group, or at the carbon 3 to the maleimidyl group, or at the carbon y to the maleimidyl group. For hydrocarbon chains having up to 19 carbon atoms, any one of positions 1 to 19 (with position 1 being the one proximal to the maieirnide ring) may be branched. For instance, for an exemplary saturated hydrocarbon chain having from 2 to 19 carbon atoms designated CrC2-C3-(J4-C5-C6-C7'C8"-CVC1(rCii-Ci2-Ci3-Ci4-Ci5-Ci6-Ci7-Ci8-C19-, anyone or more of carbons d, C2) C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, Cn, Cn, C13, C,4, CI5, C16, C|7, CIH, or C]9, depending on the total number of carbons in the chain, may be branched, that is to say, may possess one or even two substituents. Typically, a branching group is an alkyl group, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkylene cycloalkyl, or substituted cycloalkyl.   Particularly preferred cycloalkyls are cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and the like, and any of the previous cycloalkyls having one or more methylene groups (e.g., methylene, dimethylene, trimethylene, tetramethylene, etc.) connecting the cycloalkyl ring to the branching carbon. Preferably, in any given saturated hydrocarbon chain or alicyclic linker, 4 or fewer carbon atoms are branched, with the overall number of branching positions preferably equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4. Embodiments wherein the "branch" points taken together form a saturated ring or ring system (e.g., bicyclic, tricyclic, etc.) are discussed separately below. Most preferably, when X is branched, the branching carbon is singly branched, i.e., has one rather than two branching substituents.<br>
For example, the linkage may possess the structure -(CR^V, wherein R] and R2 are each independently H, alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkylenecycloalkyl, and substituted alkylenecycloalkyl, and y is an integer from about 1 to about 20, preferably from about 3 to about 20, and even more preferably from 4 to about 12. When X is branched, preferably the branching is at one or more of Cl, Cl, C3, or C4, that is to say, the carbon atom positions closest to the maleimide ring, in order to provide maximal steric hindrance to the rnaleimide ring hydrolysis reaction. (When discussing carbon atom positions within the linker, X. Cl refers to the carbon atom adjacent to the maleimide nitrogen, and so on). When X is branched, the branching groups (e.g., alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl,<br><br>
substituted cycloalkyl, alkylenecycloalkyl, and substituted alkylenecycloalkyl) typically contain fewer than 8 or so carbon atoms. When the branching group is alkyl or cycloalkyl, preferably the alkyl group is lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyi, isobutyl, penyl, cyclopentyl, hexyl, and cyclohexyl.<br>
As dicussed above, the linker X itself can be cyclic or alicyclic. Specifically, X may possess the form:<br>

where CYQ, is a cycloalkylene group having "a" ring carbons, where the value of "a" ranges from 3 to 12; p and q are each independently 0 to 20, and p +q + a <_20 r1 in each occurrence is independently h or an organic radical that selected from the group consisting of alkyl substituted cycloalkyl alkylenecycloalkyl and r ii alkylenecycloalkyl. a preferred embodiment rj r2 are both h. preferably p q lo. even more range to ring represented by cyca contains about carbon atoms atoms. representative groups include c3-c8 cycloalkylene such as cyclopropylene cyclobutylene cyclopentylene cyclohexylene cycloheptylene cyclooctylene. c yca may optionally be with one lower which can at any position within ring. instances where only two substituents i.e. shown structure iv above similarly positioned on carbons for instance cyclopenylene either positions. fora c-an al particularly></_20>
preferred embodiments are those where R, and R2 are H in all instances, and p and q are each independently selected from 0, .1, 2, and 3. Illustrative linkers include 1,2-(CH2)o,i,2,r Q,H4-(CFI,,)o,i,2,3, and l,3-(CH2)OJj2,3-QHi-(CH2)o,i,2,3, and l,4-(CH2)o,u,3-CoRHCHzJo.ixr. In instances in which CYCa possesses only two substituents, the substituents may be either cis or trans. When CYCa contains more than two substituents, the substituents may be in any relative orientation to one another.<br>
CYCa also encompasses bicyclic rings. Exemplary bicyclic rings corresponding to CYCa include rings such as bicyclo[l.l.l]pentane, bicyclo [2.2.1)hexane, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, bicycle[2.2.2]octane, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane, bicyclofS. I. IJheptane, bicyclo[3.2.1]octane, bicyclo(3.3.1]nonane, bicyclo |3.3.2]decane, bicyelo[3.3.3jundecane and the like. CYC also encompasses tricyclic ring systems such as adamantane.   Some of these bi- and tricyclic systems are shown below:<br><br><br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
These rings may possess alkylene or substituted alkylene groups corresponding to -[C(Ri)(R-2)J p and -[C(R,)(R2)]q in any available position within the ring system. Moreoever, the bicyclic or tncyclic ring may also possess additional substituents in addition to -[C(R1)(R2)] p and-[C(RO(R2)]q. Preferably, such substituents are lower alkyl, hydroxyl, sulfhydryl, orhalide. Representative polymer maleimides having bi- and tricyclic ring systems are provided in FIGs. 1A and IB.<br>
The linkage, L.. in structure I may further include a non-hydrocarbon portion adjacent to ttie polymer segment and interconnected to X as described above. Exemplary non-hydrocarbon portions adjacent to the polymer segment include -O-, -<br>
O-C(0)-NH-, -C(0&gt;NH-, -CH2-C(O)-NH-, -NH-C(O)-O-, NH-C(O)-NH-, -NH-, and -S-, and are preferably hydrolytically stable. Particularly preferred non-hydrocarbon portions include -O-, -O-C(O)-NH-, -C(O)~NH-. In a less preferred embodiment, the nitrogen amide of the amide or carbamate function is a tertiary nitrogen, e.g., having a methyl or ethyl or similar group in place of the hydrogen as shown.<br>
.Exemplary linkages including a hydrocarbon chain according to the present invention are shown in Table 1 below.<br>
Table 1. Exemplary linkers for Maleimide-Terminated Polymers<br><br>
(Table Removed)-<br>
Many of the linkages in Table 1 are effective to retard hydrolysis of the maleimide ring, although some are more effective than others. Several linkages in Table 1 provide steric hindrance to attack of the maleimide ring nitrogen by water, rnalcing the maleimide resistant to hydrolysis. These linkers include those comprising L4-TMPA, L4-CMEN, L5-TMPE, Ll-TEPE, L2-EPEN, L4-ETPA and L4-HEDA. Linkers comprising L4-TMPA and L5-TMPE, which are based on the readily available corresponding symmetrical tertiary diamine, and L4-CMEN, which is based on the commercially available diamine derivative of naturally occurring p-menthane, are exemplary linkages that reduce the rate of hydrolysis of the maleimide ring by providing both steric hindrance and adequate spacing between the ring and electron withdrawing groups. Particularly preferred are linkers containing a cyclohexylene ring, as can be seen from the hydrolysis data provided in Table 4. As can be seen from the hydrolysis data, the 1,3-dimethylene-cyclohexylene linker imparts to the resultant PEG- maleimide a particular stability towards hydrolysis. In fact, its hydrolysis half life is 8 times longer than that of its linkerless maleimide counterpart. The 1,4-dimethylene-cyclohexylene linker also results in a stable maleimide polymer having a hydrolysis half life that is over two and half times longer that that of its linkerless maleimide counterpart.<br>
THE POLYMER SEGMENT<br>
As shown in the illustrative structures above, a maleimide terminated polymer of the invention contains a water-soluble polymer segment. Representative POLYs include poly(alkylene glycols) such as poly(ethylene glycoi), poly(propylene glycol) ("PPG"), copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, poly(olefinic alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide),<br>
poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate), poJy(saccharides), poly(a-hydroxy acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyphosphazene, polyoxazoline,and poly(N-acryloylmorpholine). POLY can be a homopolymer, an alternating copolymer, a random copolymer, a block copolymer, an alternating tripolymer, a random tripolymer, or a block tripolymer of any of the above. The water-soluble polymer segment is preferably, although not necessarily, a poly(ethylene glycol) "PEG" or a derivative thereof.<br>
The polymer segment can have any of a number of different geometries, for example, POLY can be linear, branched, or forked. Most typically, POLY is linear oils branched, for example, having 2 polymer arms. Although much of the discussion herein is focused upon PEG as an illustrative POLY, the discussion and structures presented herein can be readily extended to encompass any of the water-soluble polymer segments described above.<br>
Any water-soluble polymer having at least one reactive terminus can be used to prepare a polymer maleimide in accordance with the invention and the invention is not limited in this regard. Although water-soluble polymers bearing only a single reactive terminus can be used, polymers bearing two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, rune, ten, eleven, twelve or more reactive termini suitable for conversion to a stabilized polymer maleimide as set forth herein can be used. Advantageously, as the [lumber of hydroxyl or other reactive moieties on the water-polymer segment increases, the number of available sites for introducing a linkered maleimido group increases.   Nonlimiimg examples of the upper limit of the number of hydroxyl and/or reactive moieties associated with the water-soluble polymer segment include from about 1 to about 500, from .1 to about 100, from about 1 to about SO, from about 1 to about 40, from about 1 to about 20, and from about 1 to about 10.<br>
In turning now to the preferred POLY, PEG encompasses poly(ethylene glycol) in any of its linear, branched or multi-arm forms, including end-capped PEG,<br>
forked PEG, branched PEG, pendant PEG, and less preferably, PEG containing one or more degradable linkage separating the monomer subunits, to be more fully described below. In one embodiment of the invention, the polymer segment is absent an ester linkage.<br>
A PEG polymer segment comprises the following: -(CH2CH2O)n~CH2CH2-, where (n) typically ranges from about 3 to about 4,000, or from about 3 to about 3,000, or more preferably from about 20 to about 1,000.<br>
POLY can also be end-capped, for example an end-capped PEG where PEG is terminally capped with an inert end-capping group. Preferred end-capped PEGs are those having as an end-capping moiety such as alkoxy, substituted alkoxy, alkenyloxy, substituted alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, substituted alkynyloxy, aryloxy, substituted aryloxy. Preferred end-capping groups are methoxy, ethoxy, and benzyloxy. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a phospholipid, although the polymer may also be absent a lipid.   Exemplary phospholipids include phosphatidylcholines, such as dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, disteroylphosphatidylcholine, behenoylphosphatidylcholine, arachidoylphosphatidylcholine, and lecithin.<br>
Referring now to any of the structures containing a polymer segment, POLY, POLY may correspond or comprise the following:<br>
"Z-(CH2CH20)n-"    or     "Z-(CH2CH2O)n-CH2CH2-",<br>
where n ranges from about 3 to about 4000, or from about 10 to about 4000, and Z is or includes a functional group, which may be a reactive group or an end-capping group. Examples of Z include hydroxy, amino, ester, carbonate, aldehyde, acetal, aldehyde hydrate, ketone, ketal, ketone hydrate, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, sulfone, thiol, carboxylic acid, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, hydrazide, urea, maleimide, vinylsulfone, dithiopyridine, vinylpyridine, iodoacetamide, alkoxy, benzyloxy, silane, lipid, phospholipid, biotin, and fluorescein, including activated and protected forms thereof where applicable. Preferred are functional groups such as N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester, benzotriazolyl carbonate, umine, vinylsulfone, maleimide, N-succinimidyl carbonate, hydrazide, succinimidyl propionate, succinimidyl butanoate, succinimidyl succinate, succinimidyl ester,<br><br>

Again, the POLY structures shown immediately above may represent linear polymer segments, or may form part of a branched or forked polymer segment. In an instance where the polymer segment is branched, the POLY structures immediately above may, for example, correspond to the polymer arms forming part of the overall POLY structure.  Alternatively, in an instance where POLY possesses a forked structure, the above POLY structure may, for example, correspond to the linear portion of the polymer segment prior to the branch point.<br>
POLY' may also correspond to a branched PEG molecule having 2 arms, 3 arms, 4 arms, 5 amis, 6 anus. 7 arms, 8 arms or more. Branched polymers used to<br><br>
prepare the polymer maleirnides of the invention may possess anywhere from 2 to 300 or so reactive termini. Preferred are branched polymer segments having 2 or 3 polymer arms. An illustrative branched POLY, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,932.462, corresponds to the structure:<br>

In this representation, R" is a nonreactive moiety, such as H, methyl or a PEG, and P and Q are nonreactive linkages. In a preferred embodiment, the branched PEG polymer segment is methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) disubstituted lysine.<br>
In the above particular branched configuration, the branched polymer segment possesses a single reactive site extending from the "C" branch point for positioning of the reactive maleimide group via a linker as described herein. Branched PEGs such as these for use in the present invention will typically have fewer than 4 PEG arms, and more preferably, will have 2 or 3 PEG arms. Such branched PEGs offer the advantage of having a single reactive site, coupled with a larger, more dense polymer cloud than their linear PF,G counterparts.<br>
One particular type of branched PEG maleimide corresponds to the structure: (MeO-PEG-)iG-[O]b-C(O)-NH-X-MAL, where MAL represents maleimide, i equals 2 or 3, and G is a lysine or other suitable amino acid residue.<br>
An illustrative branched polymer maleimide of the invention has the structure shown below, where X is any of the herein described hydrolytically stable linkers.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The synthesis of a polymer of the invention having the structural features embodied in XVIII above is provided in Example 1. Branched PEGs for use in preparing a polymer maleimide of the invention additionally include those represented more generally by the formula R(PEG)n, where R is a central or core molecule from which extends 2 or more PEG arms. The variable n represents the number of PEG arms, where each of the polymer aims can independently be end-capped or alternatively, possess a reactive functional group at its terminus, such as a maleimide or other reactive functional group. In such multi-armed embodiments of the invention, each PEG arm typically possesses a maleimide group at its terminus. Branched PEGs such as those represented generally by the formula, R(PEG)d, above possess 2 polymer aims to about 300 polymer arms (i.e., n ranges from 2 to about 300). Branched PEGs such as these preferably possess from 2 to about 25 polymer arms, more preferably from 2 to about 20 polymer arms, and even more preferably from 2 to about 15 polymer arms or fewer. Most preferred are multi-armed polymers having 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 arms.<br>
Preferred core molecules in branched PEGs as described above are polyols. Such polyols include aliphatic polyols having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and from 1 to 10 hydroxyl groups, including ethylene glycol, alkane diols, alkyl glycols, alkylidene alkyl diols, alkyl cycloalkane diols, 1,5-decaIindioI, 4,8-bis(hydroxymethyl)tricyclodecane, cycloalkylidene diols, dihydroxyalkanes, trihydroxyalkanes, and the like. Cycloaliphatic polyols may also be employed, including straight chained or closed-ring sugars and sugar alcohols, such as mannitol, sorbitol, inositol, xylitol, quebrachitol, threitol, arabitol, erythritol, adonitol, dulcitol, facose, ribose, arabinosc, xylose, lyxose, rhamnose, galactose, glucose, fructose, sorbose, mannose, pyranose, altrose, talose, tagitose, pyranosides, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and the like.

Other core polyols that may be used include crown ether, cyclodextrins, dextrins and other carbohydrates such as .starches and amylose. Preferred polyols include glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, and trimethylolpropane.<br>
A representative multi-arm polymer structure of the type described above is:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where d is an integer from 3 to about 100, and R is a residue of a central core molecule having 3 or more hydroxyl groups, amino groups, or combinations thereof.<br>
Multi-armed PEGs for use in preparing a polymer maleimide of the invention include multi-arm PEGs available from Nektar, Huntsville, Alabama. In a preferred embodiment, a multi-armed polymer maleimide of the invention corresponds to the following, where the specifics of the linkered maleimide portion of the molecule are provided elsewhere herein.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
and m is selected from the group consisting of 3,4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.<br>
Alternatively, the polymer maleimide may possess an overall forked structure. An example of a forked PEG corresponds to the structure:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where PEG is any of the forms of PEG described herein, A is a linking group, preferably a hydroiytically stable linkage such as oxygen, sulfur, or -C(O)-NH-, F and F' are hvdrolytically stable spacer groups that are optionally present, and the other variables corresponding to the hydroiytically stable linker, X, and maleimide (MAL) portion are as defined above. Both the general and specific descriptions of possible values for X are applicable to the embodiment above, structure XVHI. Examplary linkers and spacer groups corresponding to A, F and F' are described in International Application No. PCT/US99/05333, and are useful in forming polymer segments of this type for use in the present invention. F and F' are spacer groups that may be the same of different. In one particular embodiment of the above, PEG is mPEG, A corresponds to -C(O)-NH-, and F and F' are both methylene or-CHb-. This type of polymer segment is useful for reaction with two active agents, where the two active agents are positioned a precise or predetermined distance apart, depending upon the selection of F and F".<br>
Another version of a polymer reagent of the invention having a forked polymer segment corresponds to:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where the variables are as described above. Preferably, X in this embodiment is a saturated cyclic or alicyclic hydrocarbon chain having a total of 3 to about 20 carbon atoms.<br>
An exemplary branched PEG corresponding to "PEG" in the above formula is rnPEG disubstituted lysine, where "PEG" corresponds to:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Alternatively, the PEG polymer segment for use in preparing a polymer rnaleimide of the invention may be a PEG molecule having pendant reactive groups along the length of the PEG chain rather than at the end(s), to yield a stabilized polymer maieimide having one or more pendant maleimide groups attached to the PEG chain by a linker, X.<br>
Further, in a less preferred embodiment, the polymer segment itself may possess one or more weak or degradable linkages that are subject to hydrolysis. Illustrative degradable linkages that may be present in the polymer segment include but are not limited to carbonate, imine, phosphate ester, and hydrazone.<br>
Generally, the nominal average molecular mass of the water-soluble polymer segment, POLY will vary. The nominal average molecular mass of POLY typically falls in one or more of the following ranges: about 100 daltons to about 100,000 daltons; from about 500 daltons to about 80,000 daltons; from about 1,000 daltons to about 50,000 daltons; from about 2,000 daltons to about 25,000 daltons; from about 5,000 daltons to about 20,000 daltons. Exemplary nominal average molecular masses for the water-soluble polymer segment POLY include about 1,000 daltons, about 5,000 daltons, about 10,000 daltons, about 1 5,000 daltons, about 20,000 daltons, about 25,000 daltons, about 30,000 daltons, and about 40,000 daltons. Low molecular weight POLYs possess molecular masses of about 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2000, or 5000 daltons.<br>
POLVMER AMINES<br>
The present invention also extends to amine counterparts of any and all of the above-described structures, with the exception that the heretofore described maleirrude ring is replaced with an amino group, preferably -NH2.<br>
More particularly, the invention extends to a water-soluble polymer having the structure:<br>

wherein q and p each independently range from 0 to 6, and the substituents on said cyciohexylene ring are either cis or trans.<br>
The amine-termmated polymers represented generally by VIOL have a number of uses to be described in greater detail below. For instance, they can be converted to the corresponding maleimide-terminated polymers of the invention, or alternatively, used without further modification for covalent attachment to active agents or surfaces, or for forming hydroge'ls.<br>
MYROLYTIC STABILITY AND METHODS OF PREPARATION<br>
As described above, the polymer maleirnides provided herein are resistant to<br>
hydrolysis, as demonstrated for both the polymer reagents themselves (Examples VII<br>
and XJQI) and for their corresponding conjugates (Example VIII). A polymer maleimide of the invention has a hydrolysis half-life that is longer than that of its linkerless polymer maleimide counterpart, when measured under the same conditions. That is to say, a linkered polymer maleimide of the invention possesses a rate of hydrolysis that is slower than that of its corresponding Imkeriess version, meaning that the maleimide ring remains intact longer under essentially the same conditions. For instance, in looking at the hydrolysis data in Examples 7 and 14, Tables 2 and 4, each of the representative linkers has a hydrolysis half-life that is extended over that of the linkerless maleimide ("3-ET").<br>
The polymer maieimides of the invention can be prepared by a number of alternative routes including the following. In one approach, a maleimide-terminated polymer of the invention is prepared by reacting a functional group attached to a polymer segment (i.e.. an activated polymer segment) with a functional group attached to a bifunctional linker. Reacting the polymer segment with a bifunctional linker reagent results in covalent attachment, through a hydrolytically stable linkage, of the linker to the polymer segment. The remaining functional group on the hifunctioniil linker reagent is either a maleimide or a functional group that can be readily converted to a maleimide.<br>
For example, the linker reagent may possess the structure A-L-B, wherein A is a first functional group that is reactive with a second functional group on the polymer segment to thereby form a hydrolytically stable linkage, L, to form POLY-L-B, where B is a maleimide or a functional group that can be readily converted to a maleimide (e.g., an amine that can be converted to a maleimide by reaction with inethoxycarbonylmaleimide). In the above approach, A can be any of a number of functional groups such as halo, hydroxyl, active ester such as N-succinimidyl ester, active carbonate, acetal, aldehyde, aldehyde hydrate, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, active sulfone, thiol, carboxylic acid, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, maleimide, vinylsulfone, dithiopyridine, vinylpyridine, iodoacetamide, and epoxide. Particular xamples of linker reagents include 1,4-dibromobutane, 1,5-dibromopentane, 1,6-dibromohexane, N-succinimidyl (e-maleimidohexanoate), N-.succinimidyl (?. maleirnidopentanoate), N-(y-maleimidobutryloxy)succinimide ester, N-(y-maleirnidocaproyloxy)succinimide ester, 4,7,10-trioxa-l,3-tridecanediamine, 4-(maleimidomethyl)-l-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid - NHS ester, telramethyleuedianiine, pentamethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, 2,5-<br>
diarnino-2,5--dimetriylhexane, l,3-cyclohexylbis(methylamine), and 1,4-cyclohexylbis(rnethylamine). Such linker reagents are either commercially available, for example from Pierce Chemical Company, or can be prepared from commercially available starting materials using methodology known in the art.<br>
This approach is shown more particularly as method 1 below, as it relates to the format ion of polymer malemides containing an amide or urethane bond connecting the polymer segment to the linker, X,<br>
METHOD 1.<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In a method similar to the above, designated method 2, the reactive polymer starting material, POLY-[O]b-C(O)-LG, is reacted with a diamine reagent, H2N-X-NH-2, to form the corresponding polymer amine intermediate, POLY-[O]b-C(O)- HN-X-NH. This intermediate is then converted to the corresponding stabilized maleimide-terminated polymer. This method is advantageous in that many diamine reagents suitable for forming a stabilized polymer maleimide as described herein are commercially available. Moreover, polymer-amine intermediates can be more easily purified than their maleimide counterparts, e.g., by column chromatography. to thereby provide a polymer maleimide product that is significantly absent other undesirable polymer derived side-products, such as PEG-diol and PEG-diol derived impurities.    Method 2 is shown below.<br>
METHOD 2.<br>
Generalized Reaction Scheme.<br>
Step a.<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In methods J and 2, LG represents a leaving group, while the other variables are as described previously. The reactive polymer starting material, POLY-[O]b-C(O)-LG, may be, for example, an acyl haiide, a haloformate, an anhydride, or an active ester.  Leaving groups useful in the methods include halides (e.g., chloro, bromo, and iodo), N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-hydroxybenzotriazole, and para-nitrophenolate. The coupling reaction to form the amide or urethane bond is generally carried out in a dry organic solvent, preferably under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon. Suitable solvents include acetonitrile, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and dichloromethane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, and solvents such as acetone, and tetrahydrofuran.   The reaction is typically earned out at temperatures ranging from about 0 to 100° C, depending upon the type of solvent employed and the reactivity of the particular reagents themselves. The coupling is generally conducted in the presence of a base. Bases include trialkylamines such as triethyl amine, pyridine, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, and inorganic bases such as sodium carbonate.<br>
Representative bicyclic and tncyclic diamine reactants corresponding to fikN-X-NHj in method 2 above are provided in FIG 2. In method 2, it may be necessary in certain instances to protect one of the amino groups in H^N-X-NH? using, for example, a conventional ami no-protecting group such as t-BOC orFMOC. The protecting group in POLY-[O]b-C(O)-HN-X-NH is then typically removed prior to further purification or transformation. See for example, Examples 10 and 11. In instances where purification of the intermediate polymer amine is undertaken, any of<br>
a number of purification approaches can be used such as precipitation or chromatography, although preferred is ion exchange chromatography due to the presence of an aniino group on the intermediate polymer amine.<br>
In continuing with the approach in method 2, the intermediate polymer amine<br>
is then converted to the corresponding maleimide. Generally, this conversion is<br>
earned out by reading POLY-[O]b-C(O)-H2N-X-NH2 with a reagent such as N-<br>
methoxycarbonylrnaleirnide, exo-7-oxa[2.2.1]bicycloheptane-2,3-dicarboxylic<br>
anhydride, or maleic anhydride, under conditions suitable for forming POLY-[O]b-<br>
C(O)-H:N-X-MAI	<br>
A preferred reagent is N-methoxycarbonyimaleimide, and in this instance, the conversion to the maleimide is carried out in water or an aqueous mixture of water and a water miscible solvent such as acetonitrile or acetone. The conversion reaction is generally earned out at temperatures ranging from about 0 to 80 °C, at pHs ranging from about 6.5 to 9<br>
When the reagent is maleic anhydride, POLY-[O]b-C(O)-H2N-X-NH2 is reacted with maleic anhydride under conditions effective to form POLY-[O]b-C(O)-NH-X-NH-C(O)CH=CHCOOH (XI) as an intermediate. This intermediate is then heated under conditions effective to promote cyclization by elimination of water to form POL Y-[O]t&gt;-C(O)- NH-X-MAL. The efficiency of the cyclization reaction to form the maleimide ring typically ranges from about 15 to about 80 percent.<br>
Generally, the product, POLY-[O Jb-C(O)-H2N-X-MAL is recovered from the reaction mixture, and optionally further purified. In instances where the product is formed by method 2, further purification, for example, to remove polymer-derived impurities, may be unnecessary if purification is carried out on the amine-precursor, for example, by ion exchange chromatography. Preferably, the recovered product, POLY~[O]b-C(O)-H2N-X-MAL has a polymer purity of greater than about 80 %.<br>
Examples 1 and 5 illustrate a method of forming a reactive polymer of the invention using a linker that comprises a terminal maleimide group. In Example 1, a polymer segment modified to contain a reactive aniino group is reacted with bifunctional linker comprising an activated ester and a maleimide group. A similar approach is utilized in Example 5 to prepare a polymer maleimide having a cyclohexylene containing linker. Examples 2, 3, and 4 demonstrate formation of a<br>
polymer amuse intermediate that is then converted to the corresponding maleimide. Examples (&gt;, 10, 11, and 12 demonstrate the synthesis of cycloalkylene-containing linkers by method 2 above, where a reactive polymer starting material, POLY-[O]b-C(O)-LG, is reacted with a diamine reagent to form POLY-[O]b-C(O)-H2N-X-NH2, which is then converted to the corresponding maleimide-terminated product.<br>
STORAGE OF POLYMER MALEIMIDE REAGENTS<br>
Preferably, the polymer maleimides of the invention, as well as their ammo counterparts, are stored under an inert atmosphere, such as under argon or under nitrogen. Due to the potential of the maleimide portion of the molecule for reaction with water (e.g., by exposure to moisture to form the corresponding ring-opened lorn), it is also preferable to minimize exposure of the polymer maleimides of the invention to moisture. Thus, preferred storage conditions are under dry argon or another dry inert gas at temperatures below about -15 °C.   Storage under low temperature conditions is preferred, since rates of undesirable side reactions, such as maleimide ring opeing, are slowed at lower temperatures. In instances where the polymer segment of the polymer product is PEG, the PEG portion can react slowly with oxygen to form peroxides along the PEG portion of the molecule. Formation of peroxides can ultimately lead to chain cleavage, thus increasing the polydispersity of the PEG reagents provided herein. In view of the above, it is additionally preferred to store the PEG maleimides and related polymers of the invention in the dark.<br>

THE CONJUGATES<br>
The present in vention also encompasses conjugates formed by reaction of any of the herein described stabilized polymer maleimides or their corresponding polymer amine counterparts. In particular, the herein-described polymer maleimides are useful for conjugation to active agents or surfaces bearing at least one thiol or amino group available for reaction, while the herein-described polymer amines are useful for conjugation to active agents or surfaces bearing at least one carboxylic group available for reaction.<br>
For instance, a conjugate of the invention may possess the following structure:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where "-S-active agent" represents an active agent, preferably a biologically active agent, comprising a thiol (~SH) group, and the other variables are as described previously.    In instances where the active agent is a biologically active agent or small molecule containing only one reactive thiol group, the resulting composition may advantageously contain only a single polymer conjugate species, due to the relatively low number of sulfhydryl groups typically contained within a protein and accessible for conjugation. In some instances, a protein or small molecule or other active agent is engineered to possess a thiol group in a known position, and will similarly result in a composition comprising only a single polymer conjugate species.<br>
Alternatively, a conjugate of the invention may possess the following structure:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In structure XV, "-NH active agent" represents an active agent or surface comprising an amino group, preferably a biologically active agent, and the other variables are as previously described.<br>
The polymer amines of the invention, when used directly, can be used to provide conjugates of the following type:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The polymer conjugates provided herein, particularly those derived from the stabilized polymer malcimides of the invention, similarly possess the feature of improved hydrolytic stability to maleimide ring opening. This feature is demonstrated in Example VIII. The synthesis of exemplary conjugates, using both<br>
the niodei compound, 2-mercaptoethanoi, and an illustrative protein, is described in Examples 6, 14, 15, 16, and 17,<br>
METHODS OF CONJUGATION<br>
Suitable conjugation conditions are those conditions of time, temperature, pH, reagent concentration, solvent, and the like sufficient to effect conjugation between a polymeric reagent and an active agent. As is known in the art, the specific conditions depend upon, among other things, the active agent, the type of conjugation desired, the presence of other materials in the reaction mixture and so forth. Sufficient conditions for effecting conjugation in any particular case can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art upon a reading of the disclosure herein, reference to the relevant literature, and/or through routine experimentation.<br>
Exemplary conjugation conditions include carrying out the conjugation reaction at a pH of from about 6 to about 10, and at, for example, a pH of about 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, or 10. The reaction is allowed to proceed from about 5 minutes to about 12 hours, preferably from about 30 minutes to about 48 hours, and more preferably from about 4 hours to about 24 hours or less. Temperatures for conjugation reactions are typically, although not necessarily, in the range of from about 0 °C to about 40 °C; conjugation is often carried out at room temperature or less. Conjugation reactions are often carried out in a buffer such as a phosphate or acetate buffer or similar system.<br>
With respect to reagent concentration, an excess of the polymeric reagent is typically combined with the active agent. In some cases, however, it is preferred to have stoichiometic amounts of the number of reactive groups on the polymeric reagent to the amount of active agent. Exemplary ratios of polymeric reagent to active agent include molar ratios of about 1:1 (polymeric reagent:active agent), 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1,4:1, 5:1,6:1, 8:1, or 10:1. The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed until substantially no further conjugation occurs, which can generally be determined by monitoring the. progress of the reaction over time.<br>
Progress of the reaction can be monitored by withdrawing aliquots from the reaction mixture ar various time points and analyzing the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE or M ALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or any other suitable analytical method. Once a plateau is reached with respect to the amount of conjugate formed or the amount of unconjugated polymer remaining, the reactiort is assumed to be complete.<br>
Typically, the conjugation reaction takes anywhere from minutes to several hours (e.g., from 5 minutes to 24 hours or more). The resulting product mixture is preferably, but not necessarily purified, to separate out excess reagents, unconjugated reactants (e.g., active agent) undesired multi-conjugated species, and free or unreacted<br>
5      polymer. The resulting conjugates can then be further characterized using analytical methods such as MALDI, capillary electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis, and/or c hro m a tgraph y.<br>
More preferably, a polymer maleimide of the invention is typically conjugated to a suJfhydryl -containing active agent at pHs ranging from about 6-9 (e.g., at 6, 6.5, 10      7, 7,5, S, 8.5, or 9), more preferably at pHs from about 7-9, and even more preferably at pHs from about 7 to 8. Generally, a slight molar excess of polymer maleimide is employed, for example, a L.5 to ] 5-fold molar excess, preferably a 2-fold to 10 fold molar excess. Reaction times generally range from about 15 minutes to several hours, e.g., 8 or more hours, at room temperature. For sterically hindered sulfhydryl groups,<br>
5      required reaction times may be significantly longer. The stabilized maleimides of the invention are thiol-selective, and thiol-selective conjugation is preferably conducted at pHs around 7.<br>
Reactions with amino groups proceed at higher pHs, but are relatively slow. Protein PEGylation reaction conditions vary depending on the protein, the desired<br>
)      degree of PKGylation, and the particular polymer maleimide reagent.<br>
Illustrative Reaction Scheme<br>

SEPARATION<br>
Optionally, conjugates produced by reacting a PEG maleimide or PEG amine of the invention with a biologically active agent are purified to obtain/isolate different 1'BGylated species. Alternatively, and more preferably for lower molecular weight PEGs, e.g., having molecular weights less than about 20 kilodaitons, preferably less than or equal to about 10 kilodaitons, a product mixture can be purified to obtain a distribution around a certain number of PEGs per protein molecule, where applicable. For example, a product mixture can be purified to obtain an average of anywhere from one to five PEGs per protein, typically an average of about 3 PEGs per protein. The strategy for purii'ication of the final conjugate reaction mixture will depend upon a number of factors - the molecular weight of the polymer employed, the particular protein, the desired dosing regimen, and the residual activity and in vivo properties of the individual conjugate(s) species.<br>
If desired, PEG conjugates having different molecular weights can be isolated using gel filtration chromatography. While this approach can be used to separate PEG conjugates having different molecular weights, this approach is generally ineffective tor separating positional isomers having different pegylation sites within a protein. For example, gel filtration chromatography can be used to separate from each other mixtures of PEG 1-mers, 2-mers, 3-mers, etc., although each of the recovered PEG-nier compositions may contain PEGs attached to different reactive amino groups (e.g., lysine residues) within the protein.<br>
Gel filtration columns suitable for carrying out this type of separation include Superdex™ and Sephadex™ columns available from Amersham Biosciences. Selection of a particular column will depend upon the desired fractionation range desired. Elution is generally earned out using a non-amine based buffer, such as phosphate, acetate, or the like. The collected fractions may be analysed by a number<br>
of different methods, for example, (i) OD at 280 nm for protein content, (ii) BSA protein analysis, Ciii) iodine testing for PEG content (Sims G. E. C., et al. Anal. Biochem, 107, 60-63, t.9SO), or alternatively, (iv) by running an SDS PAGE gel, followed by staining with barium iodide.<br>
Separation of positional isotners is earned out by reverse phase chromatography using an RP-HPLC CIS column (Amersham Biosciences or Vydac) or by ion exchange chromatography using an ion exchange column, e.g., a Sephaxose™ ion exchange column available from Amersham Biosciences. Either approach can be used to separate PEG-biomolecule isomers having the same molecular weight (positional isomers).<br>
Depending upon the intended use for the resulting PEG-conjugates, following conjugation, arid optionally additional separation steps, the conjugate mixture may be concentrated, sterile filtered, and stored at low temperatures from about -20 °C to about -80 °C.   Alternatively, the conjugate may be lyophilized, either with or without residual buffer and stored as a lyophilized powder. In some instances, it is preferable to exchange a buffer used for conjugation, such as sodium acetate, for a volatile buffer such as ammonium carbonate or ammonium acetate, that can be readily removed during lyophilization, so that the lyophilized protein conjugate powder formulation is absent residual buffer. Alternatively, a buffer exchange step may be used using a formulation buffer, so that the lyophilized conjugate is in a form suitable for reconstitution into a formulation buffer and ultimately for administration to a mamniaf.<br>

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutical preparations comprising a conjugate as provided herein in combination with a pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
Generally, the conjugate itself will be in a solid form (e.g., a precipitate), which can be combined with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient that can be in either solid or liquid form.<br>
Exemplary exdpients include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of carbohydrates, inorganic salts, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, surfactants, buffers, acids, bases, and combinations thereof.<br>
A carbohydrate such as a sugar, a derivatized sugar such as an alditol, aldonic acid, an esterified sugar, and/or a sugar polymer may be present as an excipient. Specific carbohydrate excipients include, for example: monosaccharides, such as fructose, maltose, galactose, glucose, D-mannose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like; polysaccharides, such as raffinose, melezitose, maltodextrins, dextrans, starches, and the like; and alditols, such as mannitoi, xylitol, maltitol, iactitol, xylitol, sorbitol (glucitol), pyranosyl sorbitol, myoinositol, and the like.<br>
The excipient can also include an inorganic salt or buffer such as citric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, and combinations thereof.<br>
The preparation may also include an antimicrobial agent for preventing or deterring microbial growth.

An antioxidant can be present in the preparation as well. Antioxidants are used to prevent oxidation, thereby preventing the deterioration of the conjugate or other components of the preparation. Suitable antioxidants for use in the present invention include, for example, ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, hypophosphorous acid, monothioglycero], propyl gallate, .sodium bisulfite, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium metabisulfite, and combinations thereof.<br>
A surfactant may be present as an excipient. Exemplary surfactants include: polysorbates, such as "Tween 20" and "Tvveen 80," and pluronics such as F68 and F8S (both of which are available from BASF, Mount Olive, New Jersey); sorbitan esters; lipids, such as phospholipids such as lecithin and other phosphatidylcholines, phosphafidylethanolamines (although preferably not in liposomal form), fatty acids<br>
and fatty esters; steroids, such as cholesterol; and chelating agents, such as EDTA, zinc and other such suitable cations.<br>
Acids or bases may be present as an excipient in the preparation. Nonlimiting examples of acids that can be used include those acids selected from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, trichloroacetic acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfurie acid, fumaric acid, and combinations thereof.

The pharmaceutical preparations encompass all types of formulations and in particular those that arc suited for injection, e.g., powders that can be reconstituted as well as suspensions and solutions. The amount of the conjugate (i.e., the conjugate formed between the active agent and the polymer described herein) in the composition will vary depending on a number of factors, but wiJJ optimally be a therapeutically effective dose when the composition is stored in a unit dose container (e.g., a vial). In addition, the pharmaceutical preparation can be housed in a syringe. A therapeutical! y effective dose can be determined experimentally by repeated administration of increasing amounts of the conjugate in order to determine which amount produces a clinically desired endpoint.<br>
The amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the activity of the excipient and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of any individual excipient is determined through routine experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then determining the range at which optimal performance is attained with no significant adverse effects.<br>
Generally, however, the excipient will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, preferably from about 5%-98% by weight, more preferably from about 15-95% by weight of the excipient, with concentrations less than 30% by weight most preferred.<br>
These foregoing pharmaceutical excipients along with other excipients are described in "Remington: The Science &amp; Practice of Pharmacy", 19th ed., Williams &amp; Williams, (1.995), the "Physician's Desk Reference", 52nd ed., Medical Economics, Montvale, NJ (1998), arid Kibbe, A.M., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3ld Edition, American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, D.C., 2000.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are typically, although not necessarily, administered via injection and are therefore generally liquid solutions or suspensions immediately prior to administration. The pharmaceutical preparation can also take other forms such as syrups, creams, ointments, tablets, powders, and the like. Other modes of administration are also included, such as pulmonary, rectal, transdermal, transmucosal, oral, intrathecal, subcutaneous, intra-arterial, and so forth.<br>
As previously described, the conjugates can be administered injected parenterally by intravenous injection, or less preferably by intramuscular or by subcutaneous injection. Suitable formulation types for parenteral administration include ready-for-injection solutions, dry powders for combination with a solvent prior to use, suspensions ready for injection, dry insoluble compositions for combination with a vehicle prior to use, and emulsions and liquid concentrates for dilution prior to administration, among others.<br>
METHODS OF ADMINISTERING<br>
The invention also provides a method for administering a conjugate as provided herein to a patient suffering from a condition that is responsive to treatment with conjugate. The method comprises administering, generally via injection, a therapeutically effective amount of the conjugate (preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation). The method of administering may be used to treat any condition that can be remedied or prevented by administration of the particular conjugate. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate which conditions a specific conjugate can effectively treat. The actual dose to be administered will vary depend upon the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated, the judgment of the health care professional, and conjugate being administered. Therapeutically effective amounts are known to those skilled in the art and/or are described in the pertinent reference texts and literature. Generally, a therapeutical ly effective amount will range from about 0.001 mg to 100<br>
mg, preferably in doses from 0.01 mg/day to 75 mg/day, and more preferably in doses from 0.10 me/day to 50 mg/day.<br>
The unit dosage of any given conjugate (again, preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation) can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules depending on the judgment of the clinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing schedules include, without limitation, administration five times a day, four times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, three times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and any combination thereof. Once the clinical endpomt has been achieved, dosing of the composition is halted.<br>
One advantage of administering the conjugates of the present invention is that individual water-soluble polymer portions can be cleaved off. Such a result is advantageous when clearance from the body is potentially a problem because of the polymer size. Optimally, cleavage of each water-soluble polymer portion is facilitated through the use of physiologically cleavable and/or enzymatically degradable linkages such as urethane, amide, carbonate or ester-containing linkages. In this way, clearance of the conjugate (via cleavage of individual water-soluble polymer portions) cun be modulated by selecting the polymer molecular size and the type functional group that would provide the desired clearance properties. One of ordinary skill in the ait can determine the proper molecular size of the polymer as well as the cleavable functional group. For example, one of ordinary skill in the art, using routine experimentation, can determine a proper molecular size and cleavable functional group by first preparing a variety of polymer derivatives with different polymer weights and cleavable functional groups, and then obtaining the clearance profile (e.g., through periodic blood or urine sampling) by administering the polymer derivative to a patient and taking periodic blood and/or urine sampling. Once a series of clearance profiles have been obtained for each tested conjugate, a suitable conjugate can be identified.<br>

EXAMPLE 7 HYDROLYSIS RATE STUDY OF REACTIVE POLYMERS<br>
Using HPLC analysis, the rate of hydrolytic degradation of the maleimide ring of several exemplary maleimide-terminated mPEG polymers (average molecular weight 5000 Da) was explored.<br>
The following linkages between the maleimide and the PEG polymer segment were evaluated: amidoethyJene (Ll-AMDE), amidopentamethylene (Ll-AMPE), amidocydohexylmethy] (Ll-MCH), oxybutyl (L3-TEME), oxyhexyl (L3-HEXA), oxyethyl (L3-ET), and oxypropyl (L3-TME).   Complete structures are provided below for ease of reference.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
As can be shown by the data in Table 2 above, the hydrolysis rates of these illustrative polymeric maleimides to form their respective maleamic acids varies with changes in the structure of the hydrocarbon portion adjacent to the maleimide ring. The data m column three demonstrates rates of hydrolysis relative to the hcxamethylene-maleimide polymer. As can be seen, for the polymers examined, the L3-T1EXA polymer was the most stable, that is to say, had the slowest hydrolysis rate, and thus, the longest half life. The data above indicates that an increase in the length of the hydrocarbon chain separating the polymer and the maleimide increases the half-life of the maleimide terminated polymer itself".<br>
EXAMPLE 8 HYDROLYSIS RATE STUDY OF POLYMER CONJUGATES<br>
The hydrolysis rates of representative protein and small molecule model conjugates were investigated to examine the correlation between the ring opening tendencies of the polymer-terminated maleimides themselves versus their conjugates.<br>
Since large biomolecular components such as proteins have a dramatic effect on the retention of conjugated molecules on common liquid chromatography columns, it is generally more difficult to measure kinetics of maleimide conjugates than it is for the polymers themselves. In this analysis, the open acid form of the maleamic acid was not distinctly separable from the unopened or closed ring form. However, a combination analysis based upon size exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SE) and analytical protein eJectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was successfully employed to<br><br>
estimate the ring opening characteristics of polymeric maleimide protein conjugates, a;; well as conjugates prep;ired using model non-protein compounds.<br>
In this study, two PEG-globular protein conjugates represented generally below were studied to examine their ring opening characteristics.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The top structure js a PEG-maleimide conjugate of Glob Protein 2, where Glob Protein 2 is a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 48 kDa. Glob Protein 2 was conjugated to a PEG maleimide derived from a PEG propionic acid, MVV 30 kDa, which further included a medium-length linker interposed between the propionic acid derived portion of the polymer and the maleimide terminus. The linker in the top structure is -C(C))-NH(C:H2)2-NH-C(O)-CH2CH2-.<br>
The bottom structure is a PEG-malejmide conjugate of Glob Protein ], where the protein possesses a molecular weight of about i 1 kDa. The conjugate was prepared using a hnkerless maleimide (mPEG-ET-MAL) having a molecular weight of about 20 kDa. The corresponding PEG maleimide structure is L3-ET, discussed in Fxample 7.<br>
The bottom structure (Glob Protein 2) is completely ring opened after 24 hours at pH 8.5 at room temperature, thus indicating the instability of this type of maleirnidyl terminated polymer absent a stabilizing linker separating the polymer and the maleimide ring. Relative to the linkerless form, however, the linker in the top structure (Glob Protein !) retards the ring opening, since the ring structure in the top<br>
conjugate is not completely ring-opened until 17 hours, at pH 9, upon heating to 50 °C for 17 hours.<br>
Similarly, hydrolysis rates of the stabiJized polymer maleimides of the invention conjugated to a model compound, 2-mercaptoethanol, were determined to assess the tendency of the conjugates towards ring-opening. The study revealed that the present stabilized polymer maleimides are superior to those used to form conjugates of Glob Protein 1 and Glob Protein 2. That it to say, in both free and in conjugated form, the polymer maleimides of the invention exhibited superior stability and resistance against ring opening in comparison to linkerless PEG maleimide and, for example, the PEG-maleimide above, shown attached to Glob Protein 2.<br>
Hydrolysis rate studies of conjugates of 8-TRI, 8-PEN, and 8-MCH (structures provided below in Table 3) were conducted as described above for the unconjugated maleimides. The half-lives shown were calculated from data taken at two different pH values. Similar to the unconjugated maleimides, the data indicate a slowing in reaction rate as the piis drifted lower with increased ring opening. The linkage with the shortest hydrocarbon chain adjacent to the succinimide ring (i.e., 8-TRI) was the fastest to open in comparison to the other conjugates studied. The data indicate that longer/larger hydrocarbon chains provide superior resistance to hydrolysis-induced ring opening.<br>
