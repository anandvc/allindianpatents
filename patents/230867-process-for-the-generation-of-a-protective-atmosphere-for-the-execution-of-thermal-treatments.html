				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the genera¬tion of a protective nitrogen-based atmosphere for the perform¬ance of heat treatments of metal articles, such as annealing, tempering, pre-temper heating and the like.<br>
Conventionally, the nitrogen utilized for such purposes was obtained by cryogenic means at considerable cost.  More recently, therefore, attempts were made to utilize nitrogen produced by methods more economical than the cryogenic process, for example, by the passage through diaphragm membranes or by pressure-swing adsorption (PSA).<br>
Nevertheless, the nitrogen so obtained presents the drawback of impurity, containing as it does small fractions, between 0.1% and up to about 5% of oxygen,  with decisively deleterious ef¬fects on the pieces submitted to such heat treatment. Therefore, numerous procedures have already been proposed to reduce and/or eliminate the content in oxygen or oxidant derivative substances, such as water and caibon dioxide, in nitrogen produced by non-cryogenic methods, so as to purify the latter and if need be<br><br>
combine it with reducing additives, such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which exert a beneficial effect on the heat treatment process.<br>
As an example/ WO-A-93 21 350 describes an endothermal cata¬lytic process, wherein hydrocarbons are made to react to oxygen contained in the nitrogen impurities, in a reactor chamber con¬taining conventional nickel oxide catalysts, or catalysts based on noble metals, essentially resulting in the formation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, in preference to undesirable oxidizing com¬pounds. Notwithstanding the presence in heat treatment furnaces of heat exchangers designed to preheat the gas intended to react in such a reactor, it is nevertheless necessary to supply heat from the outside, in order to activate the partial oxidation re¬action of hydrocarbons with oxygen. On the whole, therefore, the economics of the process are adversely affected by the need to provide pre-heating exchangers and supply large quantities of outside heat.<br>
EP-A-0 603 799 describes a process for the catalytic con¬version of oxygen included in non-cryogenic nitrogen, by means of hydrocarbons, so as to determine - in view of the low temperature of a suitable conversion reactor - the formation of fully oxidized water and carbon dioxide.  These are then converted into reducing compounds by re-forming reactions with excess hydrocarbons present in the heat treatment furnace. Nevertheless, the kinetics of the reforming reactions is decisively slow at<br><br>
typical operating temperatures of such furnaces, so much so that to arrive at desirable compositions, it is necessary to provide extended dwelling times, forced gas recycling systems and the like, thus limiting the practical applicability of the process.<br>
EP-A-0 692 545 describes a catalytic system based on noble metals, in which impure nitrogen produced by non-cryogenic means is made to react directly with hydrocarbons.  To secure pre¬ferential formation of reducing agents, it is necessary to work at high temperatures, requiring outside heat input, which again has a negative effect on the economics of the process.<br>
With a view to overcoming the drawbacks of known technology/ the present invention envisages a process consisting of:<br>
Phase One, in which a gaseous hydrocarbon feed and an oxygen-containing oxidant   are made to react with a first catalyst chosen from the group consisting of noble metals, oxides and mixtures thereof, at a temperature in the range of about 750"C<br>
to about 900°C and a  space  velocity of at least 10,000 hT1, thus forming a reaction product comprising carbon monoxide, hydrogen and hydrocarbons, along with lesser quantities of water and carbon dioxide.<br>
- Phase Two, in which the reaction product is added to nitrogen contaminated by the presence of oxygen, reacting in its totality with a portion of the said hydrogen and carbon monoxide, forming additional water and carbon dioxide, and<br><br>
Phase Three, in which the product obtained in Phase Two is fed over a second catalyst, chosen from a group containing noble metals, at a temperature ranging from about 400°C to about 750eC, forming a gaseous low dew-point mixture, consisting essen¬tially of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, such mixture being suitable for use as a protective atmosphere in heat treat¬ments.<br>
The thermal efficiency of the invented process is distinctly superior to known processes which involve a direct reaction be¬tween oxygen present in the impure nitrogen and hydrocarbons, notably methane or natural gas.<br>
To permit formation of the desired reducing compounds with acceptable kinetics, it is in fact necessary in this latter case to work at temperatures on the order of at least 750"C, calling for the input of substantial amounts of outside heat,<br>
Conversely, according to the invented process, the above mentioned direct reaction is avoided, with its deleterious kinetic and thermodynamic drawbacks, and instead an indirect reaction is pursued by way of the three reaction stages pre¬viously described, with a limited input of outside heat.<br>
More specifically, Phase One leads to the formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which in Phase Two react very quickly and easily with oxygen contained as an impurity in nitro¬gen. Hence, it is in that phase that oxygen is completely . eliminated, concurrently with the formation of carbon dioxide<br><br>
and water, whose reforming into hydrogen and carbon monoxide is facilitated in Phase Three.<br>
It should moreover be noted that the catalysts utiliz.ed in Phase One, notably those of the oxide type, promote the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules, for example ethylene and propylene, which in turn promote thermodynamic equilibrium and the kinetics of Third-Phase reforming.<br>
The reaction leading to the formation of unsaturated hydro¬carbons starting from oxygen and saturated hydrocarbons, par¬ticularly methane, is referred to as the 'oxidative coupling1. An article by O.V. Krylov, published under the title of 'Catalytic Reactions of Partial Methane Oxidation', in Catalysis Today, Vol. 18 p. 209-302, 1993, contains a comprehensive review of processes followed to achieve oxidative coupling reactions.<br>
So far, the unsaturated hydrocarbons produced in this manner have not proved adapted for use on an industrial scale in the production of the corresponding polymers.  Still, in the course of the Third-Phase reforming reaction envisaged in this invention they play a role extremely beneficial to the formation of desirable reducing compounds, as demonstrated In experimental tests (cf. Example 3 below).<br>
In the invented process, the hydrocarbon infeed is prefer¬entially made up of methane, propane or natural gas, whereas the oxygen-containing  oxidant  preferentially utilized is air.<br><br>
Depending on the desired quantity of reduction agents in the final gaseous mixture, it is a matter of convenience<br>
to adjust the rate of flow of different raw materials used »<br>
in the process. In particular, the ratio of air to hydro¬carbon infeed may range between 2.3 and 0.5, preferably 2 and 0.8, whereas the ratio between the input of impure nitrogen and the reaction product in Phase One may range between 10 and 1, preferably 6 and 1.<br>
Both the first and the second catalyst may utilize a ceramic substrate, being in this case chosen from a group composed of ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, platinum and mixtures thereof.<br>
Again by way of an example, the ceramic substrate may be chosen from a group consisting of alumina, magnesium oxide, silica, zirconium oxide, titanium oxide and mixtures thereof.<br>
As previously mentioned, if the intent is to enhance the unsaturated hydrocarbon content in the gaseous products present in Phase One, it is preferable to use an initial oxide-type catalyst, chosen for example from a group con¬sisting of Li/HgO, Li/SMaOg, Sr/Laa03 and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Accordingly there is provided process for the generation of a protective atmosphere for the execution of thermal treatments, such process comprising:<br>
-	an initial  phase,  wherein  a gaseous hydrocarbon feed  and an<br>
oxidant containing oxygen are made to react on a first catalyst chosen from<br>
a group consisting of noble metals,  oxides and mixtures thereof, at a<br>
temperature comprised between approx. 750°C and approx. 900°C, at a<br>
space velocity of at least 10, 000 tr2, forming a reaction product comprising<br>
carbon monoxide, hydrogen and hydrocarbons and smaller quantities of<br>
water and carbon dioxide,<br>
-	a second phase, wherein such reaction product is added to nitrogen<br>
contaminated by	oxygen which reacts in its totality with a<br>
portion   of   such   hydrogen   and   carbon   monoxide,   forming   additional<br>
quantities of water and carbon dioxide, and<br>
-	a third phase wherein the product obtained in the second phase is<br>
conveyed to a second catalyst chosen from a group consisting of noble<br>
metals at a temperature ranging between approx. 400°C and approx. 750°C,<br>
forming a low dew-point gaseous mixture consisting essentially of nitrogen,<br>
hydrogen and carbon monoxide, such mixture being suitable to act as a<br>
protective atmosphere for the execution of thermal treatments.<br>
The invention will now be described in greater detail based on the following examples and the single drawing illustrating schematically the plant needed for its implementation. The examples and the figures are merely illustrative and the invention is not limited thereto.<br><br>
f<br>
EXAMPLE 1.<br>
A mixture of air 10 and natural gas 12 in an air-to-<br>
methane gas ratio of 1.8, is fed to an oxidative coupling<br>
reactor 14 (Fig. 1) containing as catalyst 1% by weight of<br>
platinum on an alumina substrate. The  space  velocity<br>
meaning the flow rate of gas sb produced per unit of volume<br>
of the catalyst is 50,000 h-i and the temperature of the gas<br>
at outlet 16 is 750QC. The gas composition is as fol¬<br>
lows:	CO  -   17.9%<br>
H,   »    36.2%<br>
C0a  -     1.0%<br>
CH« -     9.5%<br>
Na   =   Remainder to 100%<br>
The gases 16 are then added to impure nitrogen 18 con¬taining 1% oxygen obtained by membrane separation.  The ratio between the impure nitrogen 18 and the gas 16 equals 3. The oxygen contained in nitrogen 18 reacts immediately with a portion of the carbon monoxide and hydrogen contained in gases 16, to form water and carbon dioxide. The gas mix-<br>
iVv<br>
ture 20 so obtained is fed to a reforming reactor 22 con¬taining as catalyst 1% by weight of platinum, on an alumina substrate. The space  velocity is 25,000 h-1 and the mean temperature is 652c. The composition of the gases 24 exiting from reactor 22 is as follows:<br>
H2	-	11.4%<br>
CO	»	6.7%<br>
C0a	-	0.24%<br>
N-,	-	Remainder to 100%<br><br>
The dew-point of gases 24 is - 348C.  Next, the gases 24 are channeled to a heat exchanger 26 so as to pre¬heat the impure nitrogen 18, and may be utilized directly as protective atmosphere for thermal treatments, containing as they do wholly negligible quantities of oxidants.<br>
Comparative EXAMPLE 2.<br>
Impure nitrogen containing 3% oxygen with methane in a ratio of impure nitrogen-to-methane of 16, is made to react directly with a catalyst identical to the one described in Example 1, at a temperature of 699BC.<br>
The composition of the gases obtained in this manner is<br>
the following:<br>
Ha	=	10.3%<br>
CO	=  4.2%<br>
COa	=   0.6%<br>
N3	=	Remainder to 100%<br>
Their dew-point of -9 = C is distinctly higher  to the value of -34c of the gases obtained according to the invented process (Example 1). To obtain gases with a dew-point of -34C by the process described in Example 2, the reaction temperature would have to be raised to 728C.<br>
Hence, to obtain gases with the identical dew-point, the invented process allows reforming to take place at a temperature 76°C      lower than the process utilized in Example 2.<br><br>
A reduction of even a few dozen degrees of reforming temperature is a decisive advantage, inasmuch as it reduces the degree of sintaring of the catalyst and, by the same token, its loss of activity, while enhancing the thermal efficiency of the process and reducing the need for outside heat input.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A mixture of air 10 and natural gas 12 in an air-to¬gas ratio of 1.5 is fed to an oxidative coupling reactor 14 (Fig. 1),containing as catalyst samarium oxide. The gas at the outlet contains<br>
C2H4  - 4% CH4   - 4%<br>
in addition to CO, H2 and N2 and minute quantities of H2O and CO3.<br>
Next, the gases 16 are added to impure nitrogen 18 containing 1% of oxygen, obtained by membrane separation. The ratio of impure nitrogen 18 to the gases 16 is 3.  The oxygen contained in nitrogen 18 reacts immediately with a portion of the carbon monoxide and oxygen contained in the gases 16, forming water and carbon dioxide. The gaseous mixture 20 so obtained is fed to a reforming reactor 22 containing as catalyst 1% by weight of platinum on an alumina substrate. The space  velocity is 25,000 h"1 and the mean temperature is 550"C. The composition of the gases 24 at the output of reactor 22 is as follows:<br><br>
H2	= 11.6%<br>
CO	=  5.8%<br>
N2	= Remainder to 100%<br>
CO2	) negligible<br>
CH4	) quantities<br>
The dew-point of gases 24 is -35C, nearly equal to the gases produced in Example 1, but obtained at a de¬cisively lower reforming temperature (550aC vs. 652=0), thanks to the presence of discrete quantities of ethylene. The gases 24 are fed to a heat exchanger 26, so as to preheat impure nitrogen 18, and may then be utili2ed directly as protective atmosphere for thermal treatments, containing as they do wholly negligible quantities of oxidants.<br>
Without prejudice to the principles of the invention, it is understood that the implementing particulars and the mode of execution may vary within ample limits from the ones described above, without thereby exceeding its scope.<br><br><br><br><br>
