DISPOSABLE DIAPER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a disposable diaper<br>
having front and rear waist regions connected to each other by<br>
a fastener means when the diaper is put on.<br>
BACKGROUND ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]<br>
There has already been proposed a disposable diaper<br>
composed of, in a longitudinal direction, a front waist region,<br>
a rear waist region and a crotch region extending between these<br>
waist regions and comprises a liquid-pervious topsheet, a<br>
liquid-impervious backsheet and a liquid-absorbent core<br>
interposed between these two sheets. The diaper is contoured<br>
by longitudinally opposite ends extending in a transverse<br>
direction outside longitudinally opposite ends of the core and<br>
transversely opposite side edges extending in the longitudinal<br>
direction outside transversely opposite ends of the core and<br>
wherein first wings extend outward in the transverse direction<br>
from respective side edges of the front waist region and second<br><br>
wings extend outward in the transverse direction from the<br>
respective side edges of the rear waist region (See Patent<br>
Document 1).<br>
[0003]<br>
In the diaper disclosed in Patent Document 1, band-like<br>
first elastic members extending in the transverse direction is<br>
contractibly attached to the longitudinally opposite ends of<br>
the front and rear waist regions, respectively, and a plurality<br>
of strand-like second elastic members extending in the<br>
transverse direction are contractibly attached to the rear<br>
waist region so as to lie between the end of the core and the<br>
first elastic member in the rear waist region. In this diaper,<br>
the second elastic members extend between the transversely<br>
opposite side edge portions and further into wings. The wings<br>
of the rear waist region are elastically stretchable in the<br>
transverse direction. Each of the tape fasteners has a fixed<br>
portion permanently bonded to the associated wing of the rear<br>
waist region and a free portion extending outward from the fixed<br>
portion in the transverse direction. Hooks constituting a<br>
so-called mechanical fastener are attached to the free portion<br>
of the tape fastener and a stretch stress higher than those of<br>
the inner layer sheet and the outer layer sheet. Each of the<br>
tape fastener has a fixed side portion which is permanently<br><br>
bonded to outer end of the associated second wing and a free<br>
portion extending outward from the fixed side portion in the<br>
transverse direction. Hooks constituting a so-called<br>
mechanical fastener are attached to the free portion.<br>
[0004]<br>
An example of the sequence in accordance with which a<br>
parent or a care personnel puts the diaper on the wearer's body<br>
will be described. After the hip of the wearer lying face up<br>
has been laid on the developed diaper, the front waist region<br>
is held with the hand and folded back along the crotch region<br>
onto the wearer's belly. Then, with the tape fasteners gripped<br>
by the fingers, the wings of the rear waist region are folded<br>
back so that these wings are placed on respective outer sides<br>
of the wings of the front waist region. Adjusting a tightness<br>
of the end portions as well as of the wings around the wearer's<br>
waist, the free portions of the respective tape fasteners are<br>
alternately anchored on the outer surface of the front waist<br>
region. Upon connection of the front and rear waist regions<br>
to each other, the diaper is formed with a waist-hole and a pair<br>
of leg-holes.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent.<br>
Application Publication No. 2000-254176<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]<br>
In the case of the diaper disclosed in Citation, the<br>
second elastic members are stretched in the transverse<br>
direction and thereby the wings of the rear waist region also<br>
are stretched in the transverse direction as the tape fasteners<br>
are pulled outward in the transverse direction when the diaper<br>
is put on. A tensile force exerted on the second elastic members<br>
is transmitted to the first elastic member which is, in turn,<br>
stretched in the transverse direction and thereby the end<br>
portion of the rear waist region is stretched in the transverse<br>
direction.<br>
[0006]<br>
In this diaper, the first and second elastic members may<br>
often different stretch stresses since the first elastic<br>
members are band-like and the second elastic members are<br>
strand-like. With a consequence, a transverse stretch stress<br>
of the end portion of the rear waist region along which the first<br>
elastic member extends may often be different from a transverse<br>
stretch stress of the wings of the rear waist region along which<br>
the second elastic members extend.<br>
[0007]<br>
If the wings of the rear waist region exhibit a transverse<br><br>
stretch stress higher than a transverse stretch stress<br>
exhibited by the end of the rear waist region, the end of the<br>
rear waist region will be fully stretched before the wings<br>
should be sufficiently stretched. If the free portions of the<br>
respective tape fasteners are anchored on the front waist region<br>
at this moment, the diaper will be put on the wearer's body with<br>
the wings insufficiently stretched in the transverse direction.<br>
Consequently, the contractile force of the wings can not be<br>
utilized to ensure a desired tightness of the diaper around the<br>
waist of the wearer and the diaper may slip down from the proper<br>
position at which the diaper should be held on the wearer' s body.<br>
In addition, the end portion of the rear waist region may locally<br>
constrict the wearer's waist and the wearer may experience<br>
uncomfortable feeling of local oppression.<br>
[0008]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
disposable diaper improved so as to prevent the diaper from<br>
slipping down during its use and to give the wearer no<br>
uncomfortable feeling of local oppression around the wearer's<br>
waist.<br>
MEASURE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM<br>
[0009]<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a<br><br>
disposable diaper composed of a a front waist region; a rear waist region; a crotch region extending<br>
between these said waist regions; a liquid-pervious topsheet facing the wearer's skin; a liquid-<br>
impervious backsheet facing away from the wearer's skin; a liquid-absorbent core interposed between<br>
said top - and backsheets; said diaper being contoured by longitudinally opposite end portions<br>
extending in a transverse direction outside longitudinally opposite ends of said core and transversely<br>
opposite side edge portions extending in a longitudinal direction outside transversely opposite side<br>
edges of said core wherein said front and rear waist regions are connected to each other by means of<br>
fastening means when the diaper is put on; and of said front and rear waist regions, at least said rear<br>
waist region having an elastically stretchable waist area extending in the transverse direction along its<br>
end and elastically stretchable wing areas extending outward from its transversely opposite side edge<br>
portions in the transverse direction wherein the stretchable elasticity of said elastically stretchable<br>
waist area is created by a first elastic member contractibly attached to said rear waist region along its<br>
end, said transversely opposite side edge portions of said rear waist region lying between said<br>
stretchable waist area and said stretchable wing areas and said stretchable wing areas having a<br>
transverse stretch stress higher than that of said stretchable waist area; said diaper being characterized<br>
in that: the stretchable elasticity of said elastically stretchable wing areas is created by stretchy sheets<br>
separately of said top - and backsheets; and second elastic members contractibly attached to the<br>
transversely opposite side edge portions of said rear waist region make said transversely opposite<br>
side edge portion stretchable in the transverse direction and the transverse stretch stress of said<br>
elastically stretchable wing areas is lower than the transverse stretch stress of the transversely<br>
opposite side edge portions of said rear waist region.<br><br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the stretchable elasticity of the<br>
elastically stretchable waist area is created by a first elastic member contractibly attached to the waist<br>
region along its end and the stretchable elasticity of the elastically stretchable wing areas is created<br>
by stretchy sheets separately of the top- and backsheets.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the elastically<br>
stretchable waist area presents a transverse stretch stress in a range of 0.5 to 3.0 N<br>
as a first transverse length dimension of the elastically stretchable waist area is<br>
stretched to a first transverse length dimension corresponding to 90% of its maximally stretched<br>
transverse length dimension set as 100%, each of the elastically stretchable wing areas presents<br>
a transverse stretch stress in a range of 1.5 to 7.0 N as each of the elastically stretchable wing<br>
areas is stretched to a second transverse length dimension corresponding to 120% of its non-<br>
stretched transverse length dimension set as 100% and presents a transverse stretch stress<br><br>
in a range of 3. 0 to 10.0 N as each of the elastically stretchable<br>
is stretched to a second length dimension corresponding to 150%<br>
of its non-stretched transverse length dimension set as 100%.<br>
[0013]<br>
According to still another preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the transversely opposite side edge portions of the<br>
rear waist region are substantially non-stretchable.<br>
[0014]<br>
According to further another preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, second elastic members contractibly attached to the<br>
transversely opposite side edge portions of the rear waist<br>
region make the transversely opposite side edge portion<br>
stretchable in the transverse direction and the transverse<br>
stretch stress of the elastically stretchable wing areas is<br>
lower than the transverse stretch stress of the transversely<br>
opposite side edge portions of the rear waist region.<br>
[0015]<br>
According to an additional preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the transversely opposite side edge portions of the<br>
rear waist region present a transverse stretch stress in a range<br>
of 5 to 20 N as the side edge portions are stretched to a third<br>
length dimension corresponding to 90% on the basis of their<br>
maximally stretched transverse length dimension set as 100%.<br><br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016]<br>
The disposable diaper according to the present invention<br>
is characterized in that the tensile force exerted on the<br>
stretchable wing areas is segmentalized and restrained by the<br>
side edge portions of the rear waist region which are<br>
respectively interposed between the stretchable waist area and<br>
the stretchable wing areas so as to reduce the tensile force<br>
transmitted to the stretchable waist area. In this diaper, the<br>
stretchable waist area having a stretch stress lower than that<br>
of the stretchable wing areas is stretched in the transverse<br>
direction in the course of stretching the stretchable wing areas.<br>
However, there is no possibility that the stretchable waist area<br>
might be fully stretched in the transverse direction before the<br>
stretchable wing areas are stretched, so the diaper can be put<br>
on the wearer's body with the stretchable wing areas<br>
sufficiently stretched in the transverse direction. In<br>
addition, the contractile force of the stretchable wing areas<br>
and the stretchable waist area is effectively utilized to ensure<br>
that the diaper can appropriately constrict the wearer's waist<br>
and it is possible to prevent the diaper from slipping down from<br>
the proper position. This diaper is free from the anxiety that<br>
the stretchable waist area might locally constrict and the<br><br>
wearer might experience uncomfortable feeling of local<br>
oppression.<br>
[0017]<br>
In the case of the diaper wherein the side edge portions<br>
of the rear waist region are elastically stretchable and these<br>
side edge portions have a transverse stretch stress higher than<br>
a transverse stretch stress, even if the tensile force exerted<br>
on the stretchable wing areas is transmitted to the side edge<br>
portions of the rear waist region, such tensile force is<br>
segmentalized and restrained by the side edge portions of the<br>
rear waist region having a stretch stress higher than that of<br>
the stretchable wing areas. Consequently, the tensile force<br>
transmitted to the stretchable waist area can be reduced. In<br>
the course of stretching the stretchable wing areas, the<br>
stretchable waist area having a stretch stress lower than that<br>
of the stretchable wing areas is stretched in the transverse<br>
direction. However, there is no anxiety that the stretchable<br>
waist area might be fully stretched before the stretchable wing<br>
areas are stretched in the transverse direction. Namely, the<br>
diaper can be put on the wearer' s body with the stretchable wing<br>
areas sufficiently stretched in the transverse direction.<br>
This diaper allows the contractile force of the stretchable wing<br>
areas and the stretchable waist area to be effectively utilized<br><br>
to ensure that the diaper can reliably constrict the wearer's<br>
waist and unintentional slip down of the diaper from the proper<br>
position can be prevented.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE BEST MODE FOR WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020]<br>
Details of a disposable diaper according to the present<br>
invention will be more fully understood from the description<br><br>
given hereunder with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
[0021]<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing an open-type diaper<br>
1A, one of embodiments of the invention, as partially broken<br>
away, Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along the line II-II in<br>
Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a sectional view taken along the line III-III<br>
in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken along the line<br>
IV-IV in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, a transverse direction is indicated<br>
by an arrow L and a longitudinal direction is indicated by an<br>
arrow M. As used here, the phrase "inner surfaces" of top- and<br>
backsheets and leak-barrier sheets refers to surfaces thereof<br>
facing an absorbent core and as used here, the phrase "outer<br>
surfaces" of these sheets refers to surfaces thereof facing away<br>
from an absorbent core. As used here, the phrase "skin<br>
contacting side" refers to the side facing the wearer's skin<br>
and as used here, the phrase "skin non-contacting side" refers<br>
to the side facing away from the wearer's skin.<br>
[0022]<br>
A diaper 1A basically comprises a liquid-pervious<br>
topsheet 2 lying on a skin contacting side, a liquid-impervious<br>
backsheet 3 lying on the skin non-contacting side and a<br>
liquid-absorbent core 4 interposed between the top- and<br>
backsheets 2,3. The diaper 1A is composed, in the longitudinal<br><br>
direction, a front waist region 5, a rear waist region 7 and<br>
a crotch region 6 extending between these waist regions 5, 7<br>
wherein the diaper 1A is contoured by longitudinally opposite<br>
end portions 8 extending in the transverse direction across the<br>
front and rear waist regions 5, 7 outside longitudinally<br>
opposite ends 4a of the core 4 and transversely opposite side<br>
edge portions 9 extending in the longitudinal direction between<br>
the front and rear waist regions 5, 7 outside transversely<br>
opposite side edges 4b of the core 4.<br>
[0023]<br>
The diaper 1A further includes elastically stretchable<br>
waist areas 10 defined by the respective end portions 8 of the<br>
front and rear waist regions 5, 7 and a pair of elastically<br>
stretchable wing areas 11 extending outward in the transverse<br>
direction from the side edge portions 9 of the rear waist region<br>
7 . A transverse length dimension between the side edge portions<br>
9 is larger in the front waist region 5 than in the crotch region<br>
6 and thus the diaper 1A presents a substantially hourglass-like<br>
planar shape. A pair of leak-barrier sheets 12 are attached<br>
to the side edge portions 9 so as to extend in the longitudinal<br>
direction.<br>
[0024]<br>
The topsheet 2 is formed from a breathable hydrophilic<br><br>
fibrous nonwoven fabric 13. The backsheet 3 is formed from a<br>
breathable liquid-impervious plastic film 14 and a breathable<br>
hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric 15 placed upon each other<br>
so that the film 14 lies on the skin contacting side and the<br>
nonwoven fabric 15 lies on the skin non-contacting side. The<br>
film 14 and the nonwoven fabric 15 have respective surfaces<br>
opposed to each other and intermittently bonded to each other<br>
by means of adhesive (not shown) . The core 4 extends over the<br>
crotch region 6 further into the front and rear waist regions<br>
5, 7 and is permanently bonded to at least one of inner surfaces<br>
of the topsheet 2 and the backsheet 3.<br>
[0025]<br>
The core 4 comprises a mixture of particulate or fibrous<br>
super-absorbent polymer and fluff pulp or a mixture of<br>
particulate or fibrous super-absorbent polymer, fluff pulp and<br>
thermoplastic synthetic resin fiber, in any case, compressed<br>
to a desired thickness. Preferably, the core 4 is entirely<br>
wrapped with a liquid-pervious sheet such as a tissue paper or<br>
hydrophilic fibrous nonwoven fabric in order to avoid a<br>
possibility that the core 4 might get out of its initial shape<br>
and/or the particulate polymer might fall off from the core 4.<br>
The polymer may be selected from the group consisting of<br>
starch-based polymer, cellulose-based polymer and synthetic<br><br>
polymer.<br>
[0026]<br>
The longitudinally opposite end portions 8 are formed<br>
from longitudinally opposite end portions 2a of the topsheet<br>
2	and longitudinally opposite end portions 3a of the backsheet<br>
3	extending outward beyond longitudinally opposite ends 4a of<br>
the core 4 . The top- and backsheets 2, 3 are overlapped together<br>
along the end portions 2a, 3a thereof and inner surfaces of these<br>
sheets 2, 3 are permanently bonded together to form the<br>
respective end portions 8. Elasticity of the stretchable waist<br>
areas 10 is created by tape-like first elastic members 16 (i.e.,<br>
waist-surrounding elastic members) contractibly attached to<br>
the respective end portions 8 of the front and rear waist regions<br>
5, 7. The first elastic members 16 are interposed between the<br>
respective end portions 2a of the topsheet 2 and the respective<br>
end portions 3a of the backsheet 3 and. are permanently and<br>
intermittently bonded to the inner surfaces of these sheets 2,<br>
3 by means of adhesive (not shown). The first elastic members<br>
16 are permanently bonded to the top- and backsheets 2, 3 while<br>
the first elastic members 16 are stretched in the transverse<br>
direction at a given ratio. In the stretchable waist areas 10,<br>
the top- and backsheets 2, 3 shrink in the transverse direction<br>
as the elastic members 16 contract and thereupon these sheets<br><br>
2, 3 are formed with a plurality of gathers rising and falling<br>
in a thickness direction of the diaper 1A.<br>
[0027]<br>
The transversely opposite side edge portions 9 are formed<br>
from transversely opposite side edge portions 2b of the topsheet<br>
2, transversely opposite side edge portions 3b of the backsheet<br>
3 and respective fixed side portions 12a (as will be described<br>
later in details) of the leak-barrier sheets 12 extending<br>
outward in the transverse direction beyond transversely<br>
opposite side edges 4b of the core 4. Along the side edge<br>
portions 9, the side edge portions 2b of the topsheet 2 extend<br>
outward in the transverse direction slightly beyond the<br>
transversely opposite side edges 4b of the core 4 and the side<br>
edge portions 3b of the backsheet 3 as well as the side edge<br>
portions 12a of the leak-barrier sheets 12 extend outward in<br>
the transverse direction beyond the side edge portions 2b of<br>
the topsheet 2. Along the side edge portions 9, the respective<br>
side edge portions 2b, 3b, 12a of these sheets 2, 3, 12 are<br>
overlapped together and have inner and outer surfaces thereof<br>
permanently bonded together. The side edge portions 9 are<br>
substantially non-stretchable. The side edge portions 9 of the<br>
rear waist region 7 lie between the stretchable waist area 10<br>
and the stretchable wing areas 11.<br><br>
[0028]<br>
A plurality of string-like leg surrounding elastic<br>
members 17 are contractibly attached to the respective side edge<br>
portions 9 of the crotch region 6 so as to extend in the<br>
longitudinal direction. More specifically, the leg<br>
surrounding elastic members 17 are interposed between the<br>
respective side edge portions 3b of the backsheet 3 and the<br>
respective fixed side portions 12a of the leak-barrier sheets<br>
12 and are intermittently and permanently bonded to the inner<br>
surfaces of these sheets 3, 12 by means of adhesive (not shown)<br>
while these elastic members 17 are stretched in the longitudinal<br>
direction at a given ratio. Along the side edge portions 9,<br>
the backsheet 3 and the leak-barrier sheets 12 shrink in the<br>
longitudinal direction as the elastic members 17 contract and<br>
these sheets 3, 12 are formed with a plurality of gathers rising<br>
and falling in the thickness direction of the diaper 1A.<br>
[0029]<br>
The stretchable wing areas 11 are formed from an<br>
elastically stretchable sheet 18 which are prepared separately<br>
of the top- and backsheets 2, 3 as well as the leak-barrier sheets<br>
12 and elastically stretchable in the transverse direction.<br>
The stretchable wing areas 11 have a transverse stretch stress<br>
higher than that of the stretchable waist areas 10. The<br><br>
stretchable wing areas 11 have transversely inner end portions<br>
11a interposed between the side edge portions 3b of the<br>
backsheet 3 and the fixed side portions 12a of the leak-barrier<br>
sheets 12 and permanently bonded to respective inner surfaces<br>
of these sheets 3, 12 by means of adhesive (not shown) . A pair<br>
of tape fasteners 19 (fastening means) extending in the<br>
transverse direction are attached to the transversely outer end<br>
portions l1b of the respective stretchable wing areas 11.<br>
[0030]<br>
The stretchable sheet 18 comprises a pair of breathable<br>
hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric layers 20 and breathable<br>
liquid-impervious stretchy plastic film 21 sandwiched between<br>
these nonwoven fabric layers 20. These nonwoven fabric layers<br>
20 are formed with a plurality of gathers rising and falling<br>
in the thickness direction of the diaper 1A.<br>
[0031]<br>
The elastically stretchable sheet 18 may be obtained, for<br>
example, by placing and bonding the nonwoven fabric layers 20<br>
on and to both surfaces of the stretchy plastic film 20 which<br>
is under a tension in the transverse direction. Upon relaxation,<br>
the film 21 contracts in the transverse direction and a<br>
contractile force of the film 21 causes the nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 20 to shrink in the transverse direction and to be formed<br><br>
with the gathers. Specifically, the nonwoven fabric layers 20<br>
and the film 21 have respective surfaces opposed one to another<br>
overlap and intermittently bonded one to another at a plurality<br>
of heat-sealing spots rather evenly distributed in a dotted<br>
pattern. For bonding of the nonwoven fabric layers 20 to the<br>
film 21 may be achieved using welding technique such as<br>
heat-sealing or sonic sealing. Alternatively, the nonwoven<br>
fabric layers 20 and the film 21 may be intermittently bonded<br>
together using adhesive instead of using the heat-sealing spots<br>
23.<br>
[0032]<br>
The fibrous nonwoven fabric 20 is formed from<br>
polyolefin-based thermoplastic synthetic resin fiber. The<br>
polyolef in-based thermoplastic synthetic resin may be selected<br>
from the group consisting of polyamide-, polyester-,<br>
polyethylene-, polypropylene-based thermoplastic synthetic<br>
resin. The plastic film 21 is formed by thermoplastic synthetic<br>
resin having rubber-like elasticity. The thermoplastic<br>
synthetic resin forming the film 21 is made of material selected<br>
from the group consisting of styrene-based block copolymer,<br>
polyurethane-based block copolymer, polyester-based block<br>
copolymer, polyamide-based block copolymer and copolymer blend.<br>
The styrene-based block copolymer may be: selected from a group<br><br>
consisting of styrene-butadiene-styrene (S-B-S) and<br>
styrene-ethylene butadiene-styrene (S-EB-S). The copolymer<br>
blend may be selected from the group consisting of<br>
styrene-ethylene butadiene-styrene/polypropylene (S-EB-S/PP)<br>
and polypropylene/ethylene-propylene (PP/-P).<br>
[0033]<br>
Alternatively, the stretchable sheet 18 may be formed<br>
from a single layer of the breathable hydrophobic fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric 20 and the stretchy plastic film 21. In this<br>
case, the nonwoven fabric layer 20 may be placed and bonded on<br>
and to one surface of the stretchy plastic film 21 being<br>
stretched in the transverse direction by means of the<br>
heat-sealing spots 23 or by means of adhesive.<br>
[0034]<br>
Each of the tape fasteners 19 has a fixed side portion<br>
19a permanently bonded to the outer end portion l1b of the<br>
associated second stretchable wing area 11 by means of adhesive<br>
(not shown) and a free portion 19b extending outward from the<br>
fixed side portion 19a in the transverse direction. Stock<br>
material for the tape fastener 19 may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of a fibrous nonwoven fabric made of<br>
polyolefin-based thermoplastic synthetic resin fiber and a film<br>
made of polyolefin-based thermoplastic resin. The free<br><br>
portion 19b is provided with a plurality of hooks 24 extending<br>
in the thickness direction of the diaper 1A. These hooks 24<br>
are made of polyolefin-based thermoplastic synthetic resin.<br>
Alternatively, the free portion 19b may be coated with<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive, instead of the hooks 24.<br>
[0035]<br>
The front waist region 5 is provided with a target tape<br>
25 (fastening means) on which the free end portions 19b of the<br>
respective tape fasteners 19 are releasably anchored. The<br>
target tape 25 has a rectangular shape having its longer sides<br>
extending in the transverse direction and is intermittently or<br>
continuously bonded to the outer surface of the backsheet 3 by<br>
means of adhesive (not shown) . Stock materials for this target<br>
tape 25 may be selected from the group consisting of a fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric made of polyolefin-based thermoplastic<br>
synthetic resin fiber and a plastic film made of<br>
polyolefin-based thermoplastic synthetic resin. The target<br>
tape 25 is provided on its outer surface with a plurality of<br>
loops 26 each describing a circular arc in the thickness<br>
direction of the diaper 1A. These loops 26 are made of<br>
polyolefin-based thermoplastic synthetic resin. When it is<br>
desired to coat the free portions 19b of the respective tape<br>
fasteners 19 with pressure-sensitive adhesive, the synthetic<br><br>
resin film may be used as the target tape 25.<br>
[0036]<br>
The leak-barrier sheets 12 are formed from a breathable<br>
hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric 27. The leak-barrier<br>
sheets 12 respectively have the fixed side portions 12a<br>
extending between the front and rear waist regions 5, 7 in the<br>
longitudinal direction along the side edge portions 9, a movable<br>
portions 12b normally biased to rise up above the topsheet 2<br>
and extending between the front and rear waist regions 5, 7 in<br>
the longitudinal direction and longitudinally opposite fixed<br>
end portions 12c lying on the longitudinally opposite end<br>
portions 8, respectively, and collapsed inward in the<br>
transverse direction of the diaper 1A. Elastic members 28<br>
extending in the longitudinal direction are contractibly<br>
attached to the movable portions 12b in the vicinity of distal<br>
ends of these movable portions 12b wherein each of the elastic<br>
members 28 is wrapped with a part of the movable portion 12b<br>
and intermittently and permanently bonded to the movable<br>
portions 12b by means of adhesive (not shown). The fixed end<br>
portions 12c are permanently bonded to the outer surface of the<br>
respective end portions 2a of the topsheet 2. In the<br>
leak-barrier sheets 12, the elastic members 28 contract as the<br>
diaper 1A is curved in the longitudinal direction with the<br><br>
topsheet 2 inside and a contractile force of these elastic<br>
members 28 causes the movable portions 12b to rise up above the<br>
topsheet 2 so as to form barriers against bodily discharges.<br>
[0037]<br>
An example of the sequence in accordance with which a<br>
parent or a care personnel puts the diaper 1A on the wearer's<br>
body will be described. After the hip of the wearer lying face<br>
up has been laid on the developed diaper 1A, the front waist<br>
region 5 is held with the hand and folded back along the crotch<br>
region 6 onto the wearer's belly. Then, with the free portions<br>
19b of the tape fasteners 19 gripped by the fingers, the<br>
stretchable wing areas 11 are folded back so that these<br>
stretchable wing areas 11 may be positioned above the wearer's<br>
belly. Adjusting a tightness of the stretchable waist area 10<br>
as well as the stretchable wing areas 11 around the wearer's<br>
waist by stretching the wing areas 11 in the transverse<br>
direction, the stretchable wing areas 11 are place on respective<br>
outer sides of the end portion 8 of the front waist region 5<br>
and the side edge portions 9, and then the free portions 19b<br>
of the respective tape fasteners 19 are anchored on the outer<br>
surface of the target tape 25 and thereby the front and rear<br>
waist regions 5, 7 are connected to each other.<br><br>
To anchor the tape fasteners 19 on the target tape 25,<br>
the free portions 19b of the respective tape fasteners 19 may-<br>
be pressed against the outer surface of the target tape 25 and<br>
thereby the hooks 24 may be engaged with the loops 26. Upon<br>
connection of the front and rear waist regions 5, 7 to each other,<br>
the diaper 1A is formed with a waist-hole and a pair of leg-holes<br>
(not shown). Excretion discharged on the diaper 1A put on the<br>
wearer's body is absorbed by the core 4 through the topsheet<br>
2 and contained therein.<br>
[0039]<br>
The stretchable wing areas 11 are stretched in the<br>
transverse direction as the tape fasteners 19 pulled outward<br>
in the transverse direction and a tensile force exerted on the<br>
stretchable wing areas 11 is transmitted to the side edge<br>
portions 9 of the rear waist region 7 defined between the<br>
stretchable waist area 10 and the stretchable wing areas 11.<br>
Even when the tensile force exerted on the stretchable wing<br>
areas 11 is transmitted to the side edge portions 9 of the rear<br>
waist region 7, such tensile force is segmentalized and<br>
restrained by the substantially non-stretchable side edge<br>
portions 9 and the tensile force transmitted from the<br>
stretchable wing areas 11 to the stretchable waist area 10 can<br>
be reduced. Therefore, while the waist area 10 having a stretch<br><br>
stress lower than that of the wing areas 11 is stretched in the<br>
transverse direction in the course of stretching the wing areas<br>
11, it is unlikely that the stretchable waist area 10 might be<br>
fully stretched before the stretchable wing areas 11 are<br>
sufficiently stretched in the transverse direction. In this<br>
way, the free portions 19b of the respective tape fasteners 19<br>
can be anchored on the target tape 25 with the stretchable waist<br>
area 10 as well as the stretchable wing areas 11 sufficiently<br>
stretched.<br>
[0040]<br>
A parent or a care personnel is able to put the diaper<br>
1A on the wearer's body with not only the stretchable waist area<br>
10 but also the stretchable wing areas 11 sufficiently stretched.<br>
In other words, there is no anxiety that the diaper 1A might<br>
be put on the wearer's body with the stretchable wing areas 11<br>
insufficiently stretched. In this way, it is ensured that the<br>
diaper 1A can be appropriately tightened around the wearer's<br>
waist by utilizing a contractile force of the stretchable waist<br>
area 10 as well as a contractile force of the stretchable wing<br>
areas 11. The diaper 1A can be held in close contact with the<br>
wearer's skin along the end portions 8 as well as the side edge<br>
portions 9 of the front and rear waist regions 5, 7 to avoid<br>
both the apprehension that the end portions 8 and/or the side<br><br>
edge portions 9 might shift from the proper positions and the<br>
apprehension that the diaper 1A might slip down from the proper<br>
position.<br>
[0041]<br>
The diaper 1A is free from the anxiety that the<br>
stretchable waist area 10 might locally compress the wearer's<br>
waist and the wearer might experience uncomfortable feeling of<br>
local oppression around the waist. Even if the stretchable<br>
waist area 10 of the front waist region 5 constrict the wearer's<br>
waist, such constriction is not so significant that the wearer<br>
might be prevented from his or her abdominal respiration and<br>
might experience uncomfortable feeling to wear the diaper 1A.<br>
[0042]<br>
The elastically stretchable waist area 10 presents a<br>
transverse stretch stress in a range of 0.5 to 3.0 N as this<br>
elastically stretchable waist area 10 is stretched to its first<br>
transverse length dimension corresponding to 90% of its<br>
maximally stretched transverse length dimension set as 100%,<br>
each of the elastically stretchable wing areas 11 presents a<br>
transverse stretch stress in a range of 1.5 to 7.0 N as each<br>
of the elastically stretchable wing areas 11 is stretched to<br>
its second transverse length dimension corresponding to 120%<br>
of its non-stretched transverse length dimension set as 100%<br><br>
and presents a transverse stretch stress in a range of 3.0 to<br>
10.0 N as each of the elastically stretchable wing areas 11 is<br>
stretched to its second length dimension corresponding to 150%<br>
of its non-stretched transverse length dimension set as 100%.<br>
[0043]<br>
If the stretch stress of the wing areas 11 exceeds the<br>
above-mentioned higher limit values, an excessively high<br>
tensile force will be required to stretch the wing areas 11 in<br>
the transverse direction and, in consequence, it will be<br>
impossible to control a tensile force transmitted from the<br>
stretchable wing areas 11 to the stretchable waist area 10.<br>
Thus undesirably high tensile force may be transmitted from the<br>
stretchable wing areas 11 to the stretchable waist area 10 and<br>
the stretchable waist area 10 may be fully stretched in the<br>
transverse direction before the stretchable wing areas 11 are<br>
sufficiently stretched. In this case, the diaper 1A may be put<br>
on with the stretchable wing areas 11 insufficiently stretched<br>
in the transverse direction.<br>
[0044]<br>
If the stretch stress of the stretchable waist area 10<br>
is less than the above-mentioned lower limit values, the<br>
stretchable waist area 10 will be fully stretched under a<br>
relatively low tensile force and, as an inevitable result, it<br><br>
will be impossible to put the diaper 1A on the wearer's body<br>
with the stretchable wing areas 11 sufficiently stretched.<br>
Additionally, a contractile force of the stretchable waist area<br>
10 will be substantially ineffective and it will be impossible<br>
for the stretchable waist area 10 to clinch the wearer's waist<br>
appropriately. If the stretch stress of the stretchable waist<br>
area 10 exceeds the above-mentioned higher limit values and the<br>
stretch stress of the stretchable wing areas 11 is less than<br>
the above-mentioned lower limit values, the stretchable waist<br>
area 10 will needlessly clinch the wearer's waist, leading to<br>
a feeling of local oppression and sometimes making an abdominal<br>
respiration difficult. At the same time, the contractile force<br>
of the stretchable wing areas 11 is substantially ineffective<br>
to clinch the wearer' s waist appropriately by these stretchable<br>
wing areas 11.<br>
[0045]<br>
The stretch stress of the stretchable waist area 10 was<br>
measured using a method as follows:<br>
(1) The stretchable waist area 10 (including the first<br>
elastic members) is cut away from the end portion 8 of the rear<br>
waist region 7 to prepare a first sample having a transverse<br>
dimension of 220 to 240 mm for measurement of stretch stress.<br>
INSTRON 5543 or AUTOGRAPH manufactured by INSTRON JAPAN CO. is<br><br>
used to measure the stretch stress.<br>
(2)	One end of the first sample in the transverse<br>
direction is held by an upper chuck and the other end of the<br>
first sample in the transverse direction is held by a lower chuck.<br>
A length dimension of the sample measured between the upper and<br>
lower chucks is 125 mm. The first sample is now stretched in<br>
the vertical direction at a rate of 100 mm/min so that the upper<br>
and lower chucks may get away from each other.<br>
(3)	On the basis of a length dimension of the first sample<br>
having been stretched to the maximum limit as measured between<br>
the upper and lower chucks set as 100%, the first sample is<br>
stretched to a length dimension corresponding to 90% and a<br>
stretch stress at this moment is measured as the transverse<br>
stretch stress of the stretchable waist area 10.<br>
[0046]<br>
The stretch stress of the stretchable wing areas 11 was<br>
measured using a method as follows:<br>
(1) The transversely opposite side edge portions 9 of the<br>
rear waist region 7 are cut away from the diaper 1A to prepare<br>
second samples for measurement of stretch stress. Each sample<br>
comprises a part of the side edge portion 9 and the complete<br>
stretchable wing area 11 (including the tape fastener 19).<br>
INSTRON 5543 or AUTOGRAPH manufactured by INSTRON JAPAN CO. is<br><br>
used to measure the stretch stress.<br>
(2)	A fixture is attached to the side edge portion 9 of<br>
the sample except the stretchable wing area 11 so that the<br>
fixture may extend along full length of the side edge portion<br>
9. Of the second sample, the tape fastener 19 is held by an<br>
upper chuck and the fixture is held by a lower chuck. A length<br>
dimension of the sample measured between the upper and lower<br>
chucks is 70 mm.<br>
(3)	A length dimension of the non-stretched second sample<br>
extending between the upper and lower chucks without slacks is<br>
set as 100%. The second sample is stretched in the vertical<br>
direction at a rate of 100 min/min so that the upper and lower<br>
chucks may get away from each other. The second sample is<br>
stretched to a length dimension corresponding to 120% of its<br>
non-stretched length and a stretch stress of the second sample<br>
at this moment is measured and then the second sample is<br>
stretched to a length dimension corresponding to 150% of its<br>
non-stretched length and a stretch stress of the second sample<br>
at this moment is measured.<br>

[0048]<br>
The diaper 1B basically comprises a liquid-pervious<br>
topsheet 2, a liquid-impervious backsheet 3 and a<br>
liquid-absorbent core 4 interposed between the top- and<br>
backsheet s 2, 3. The diaper 1B is composed of, in the<br>
longitudinal direction, a front waist region 5, a rear waist<br>
region 7 and a crotch region 6 extending between these waist<br>
regions 5, 7. The diaper 1B is contoured by longitudinally<br>
opposite end portions 8 extending across the front and rear<br>
waist regions 5, 7 in the transverse direction outside<br>
longitudinally opposite ends 4a of the core 4 and transversely<br>
opposite side edge portions 9 extending between the front and<br>
rear waist regions 5, 7 in the longitudinal direction outside<br>
transversely opposite side edges 4b of the core 4.<br>
[0049]<br>
The diaper 1B further includes elastically stretchable<br>
waist areas 10 defined by the respective end portions 8 of the<br>
front and rear waist regions 5, 7 and a pair of elastically<br><br>
stretchable wing areas 11 extending outward in the transverse<br>
direction from the side edge portions 9 of the rear waist region<br>
9. A pair of leak-barrier sheets 12 extending in the<br>
longitudinal direction are attached to the side edge portions<br>
9. The topsheet 2 is formed by the same nonwoven fabric 13 as<br>
that of the diaper 1A and the backsheet 3 is formed from the<br>
film 14 and the nonwoven fabric 15 both being the same as those<br>
of the diaper 1A. The core 4 also is the same as that of the<br>
diaper 1A.<br>
[0050]<br>
The longitudinally opposite end portions 8 are formed<br>
from longitudinally opposite end portions 2a of the topsheet<br>
2	and longitudinally opposite end portions 3a of the backsheet<br>
3	extending outward beyond longitudinally opposite ends 4a of<br>
the core 4 . The top- and backsheets 2, 3 are overlapped together<br>
along the end portions 2a, 3a thereof. Elasticity of the<br>
stretchable waist areas 10 is created by tape-like first elastic<br>
members 16 (i.e., waist-surrounding elastic members)<br>
contractibly attached to the respective end portions 8 of the<br>
front and rear waist regions 5, 7. The first elastic members<br>
16 are interposed between the respective end portions 2a of the<br>
topsheet 2 and the respective end portions 3a of the backsheet<br>
3 and are permanently and intermittently bonded to the inner<br><br>
surfaces of these sheets 2, 3. In the stretchable waist areas<br>
10, the top- and backsheets 2, 3 shrink in the transverse<br>
direction as the elastic members 16 contract and thereupon these<br>
sheets 2, 3 are formed with a plurality of gathers rising and<br>
falling in a thickness direction of the diaper 1B.<br>
[0051]<br>
The transversely opposite side edge portions 9 are formed<br>
from transversely opposite side edge portions 2b of the topsheet<br>
2, transversely opposite side edge portions 3b of the backsheet<br>
3 and the respective fixed side portions 12a of the leak-barrier<br>
sheets 12 extending outward in the transverse direction beyond<br>
transversely opposite side edges 4b of the core 4. Along the<br>
side edge portions 9, the respective side edge portions 2b, 3b,<br>
12a of these sheets 2, 3, 12 are overlapped together and have<br>
inner and outer surfaces thereof permanently bonded together.<br>
[0052]<br>
The transversely opposite side edge portions 9 of the rear<br>
waist region 7 are elastically stretchable in the transverse<br>
direction and interposed between the stretchable waist area 10<br>
and the stretchable wing areas 11. Elasticity of the side edge<br>
portions 9 are created by second elastic members 22 contractibly<br>
attached thereto. The second elastic members 22 present<br>
substantially rectangular shape having its longer sides<br><br>
extending in the longitudinal direction. These second elastic<br>
members 22 are interposed between the side edge portions 3b of<br>
the backsheet 3 and the fixed side portions 12a of the respective<br>
leak-barrier sheets 12 and intermittently and permanently<br>
bonded to the respective inner surfaces of these sheets 3, 12<br>
by means of adhesive (not shown). The second elastic members<br>
22 are bonded to the backsheet 3 and the leak-barrier sheets<br>
12 while the second elastic members 22 are stretched in the<br>
transverse direction at a given ratio. Along the side edge<br>
portions 9, the backsheet 3 and the leak-barrier sheets 12<br>
shrink in the longitudinal direction as the elastic members 17<br>
contract and these sheets 3, 12 are formed with a plurality of<br>
gathers rising and falling in the thickness direction of the<br>
diaper 1B.<br>
[0053]<br>
A plurality of string-like leg surrounding elastic<br>
members 17 are contractibly attached to the respective side edge<br>
portions 9 of the crotch region 6 so as to extend in the<br>
longitudinal direction. More specifically, the leg<br>
surrounding elastic members 17 are interposed between the<br>
respective side edge portions 3b of the backsheet 3 and the<br>
respective fixed side portions 12a of the leak-barrier sheets<br>
12 and are intermittently and permanently bonded to the inner<br><br>
surfaces of these sheets 3, 12 while these elastic members 17<br>
are stretched in the longitudinal direction at a given ratio.<br>
Along the side edge portions 9 of the crotch region 6, the<br>
backsheet 3 and the leak-barrier sheets 12 shrink in the<br>
longitudinal direction as the elastic members 17 contract and<br>
these sheets 3, 12 are formed with a plurality of gathers rising<br>
and falling in the thickness direction of the diaper 1B.<br>
[0054]<br>
The stretchable wing areas 11 are formed from an<br>
elastically stretchable sheet 18 which are prepared separately<br>
of the top- and backsheets 2, 3 as well as the leak-barrier sheets<br>
12 and elastically stretchable in the transverse direction.<br>
The stretchable wing areas 11 have a transverse stretch stress<br>
which is higher than that of the stretchable waist areas 10 and<br>
lower than that of the side edge portions 9 in the rear waist<br>
region 7 . The stretchable wing areas 11 have transversely inner<br>
end portions 11a interposed between the side edge portions 3b<br>
of the backsheet 3 and the fixed side portions 12a of the<br>
leak-barrier sheets 12 and permanently bonded to respective<br>
inner surfaces of these sheets 3, 12. Inner end portion 11a<br>
of the stretchable wing area 11 has substantially the same<br>
longitudinal dimension as that of the second elastic members<br>
22 attached to the side edge portions 9 of the rear waist region<br><br>
7. A pair of tape fasteners 19 (fastening means) extending in<br>
the transverse direction are attached to the transversely outer<br>
end portions l1b of the respective stretchable wing areas 11.<br>
The stretchable sheet 18 comprises, similarly to that of the<br>
diaper 1A, a pair of breathable hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven<br>
fabric layers 20 and breathable, liquid-impervious and stretchy<br>
plastic film 21 sandwiched therebetween. The nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 20 and the film 21 are intermittently bonded together<br>
at a plurality of heat-sealing spots distributed in<br>
dot-pattern.<br>
[0055]<br>
Each of the tape fasteners 19 has a fixed side portion<br>
19a permanently bonded to the outer end portion l1b of the<br>
associated second stretchable wing area 11 and a free portion<br>
19b extending outward from the fixed side portion 19a in the<br>
transverse direction. The free portion 19b is provided with<br>
a plurality of hooks 24 extending in the thickness direction<br>
of the diaper 1B. The tape fasteners 19 and hooks 24 are made<br>
of the same materials as those used in the embodiment of the<br>
diaper 1A.<br>
[0056]<br>
The front waist region 5 is provided with a target tape<br>
25 (fastening means) on which the free end portions 19b of the<br><br>
respective tape fasteners 19 are releasably anchored. The<br>
target tape 25 has a rectangular shape having its longer sides<br>
extending in the transverse direction and is permanently bonded<br>
to the outer surface of the backsheet 3. The target tape 25<br>
is provided on its outer surface with a plurality of loops 26<br>
each describing a circular arc in the thickness direction of<br>
the diaper 1B. The target tape 25 and the loops 26 are made<br>
of the same materials as those used in the embodiment of the<br>
diaper 1A.<br>
[0057]<br>
The leak-barrier sheets 12 are formed from the same<br>
nonwoven fabric 27 as that used in the embodiment of the diaper<br>
1A. The leak-proof sheets 12 respectively have the fixed side<br>
portions 12a extending between the front and rear waist regions<br>
5, 7 in the longitudinal direction along the side edge portions<br>
9, a movable portions 12b normally biased to rise up above the<br>
topsheet 2 and extending between the front and rear waist<br>
regions 5, 7 in the longitudinal direction and longitudinally<br>
opposite fixed end portions 12c lying on the longitudinally<br>
opposite end portions 8, respectively, and collapsed inward in<br>
the transverse direction of the diaper 1B. Elastic members 28<br>
extending in the longitudinal direction are contractibly<br>
attached to the movable portions 12b in the vicinity of distal<br><br>
ends of these movable portions 12b. The fixed end portions 12c<br>
are permanently bonded to outer surface of the respective end<br>
portions 2a of the topsheet 2. The movable portions ,12b rise<br>
up above the topsheet 2 so as to form barriers against bodily<br>
discharges.<br>
[0058]<br>
The sequence in which a parent or a care personnel puts'<br>
the diaper 1B on the wearer's body is the same as in the case<br>
of the diaper 1A and not described here to eliminate duplication.<br>
The stretchable wing areas 11 are stretched in the transverse<br>
direction as the tape fasteners 19 pulled outward in the<br>
transverse direction with the free portions 19b gripped by the<br>
fingers and a tensile force exerted on the stretchable wing<br>
areas 11 is transmitted to the side edge portions 9 of the rear<br>
waist region 7 defined between the stretchable waist area 10<br>
and the stretchable wing areas 11. Even when the tensile force<br>
exerted on the stretchable wing areas 11 is transmitted to the<br>
side edge portions 9 of the rear waist region 7, such tensile<br>
force is segmentalized and restrained by the substantially<br>
non-stretchable side edge portions 9 and the tensile force<br>
transmitted from the stretchable wing areas 11 to the<br>
stretchable waist area 10 can be reduced. Therefore, while the<br>
waist area 10 having a stretch stress lower than that of the<br><br>
wing areas 11 is stretched in the transverse direction in the<br>
course of stretching the wing areas 11, it is unlikely that the<br>
stretchable waist area 10 might be fully stretched before the<br>
stretchable wing areas 11 are sufficiently stretched in the<br>
transverse direction. In this way, the free portions 19b of<br>
the respective tape fasteners 19 can be anchored on the target<br>
tape 25 with the stretchable waist area 10 as well as the<br>
stretchable wing areas 11 sufficiently stretched.<br>
[0059]<br>
A parent or a care personnel is able to put the diaper<br>
1B on the wearer' s body with not only the stretchable waist area<br>
10 but also the stretchable wing areas 11 sufficiently stretched.<br>
In other words, there is no anxiety that the diaper 1B might<br>
be put on the wearer's body with the stretchable wing areas 11<br>
insufficiently stretched. In this way, it is ensured that the<br>
diaper 1B can be appropriately tightened around the wearer's<br>
waist by utilizing a contractile force of the stretchable waist<br>
area 10 as well as a contractile force of the stretchable wing<br>
areas 11. The diaper 1B can be held in close contact with the<br>
wearer's skin along the end portions 8 as well as the side edge<br>
portions 9 of the front and rear waist regions 5, 7 to avoid<br>
both the apprehension that the end portions 8 and/or the side<br>
edge portions 9 might shift from the proper positions and the<br><br>
apprehension that the diaper 1B might slip down from the proper<br>
position.<br>
[0060]<br>
The diaper 1B is free from the anxiety that the<br>
stretchable waist area 10 might locally compress the wearer's<br>
waist and the wearer might experience uncomfortable feeling of<br>
local oppression around the waist. Even if the stretchable<br>
waist area 10 of the front waist region 5 constrict the wearer' s<br>
waist, such constriction is not so significant that the wearer<br>
might be prevented from his or her abdominal respiration and<br>
might experience uncomfortable feeling to wear the diaper 1B.<br>
[0061]<br>
In the diaper 1B, the elastically stretchable waist area<br>
10 presents a transverse stretch stress in a range of 0.5 to<br>
3.0 N as the elastically stretchable waist area 10 is shortened<br>
to a transverse length dimension corresponding to 90% of a<br>
second length dimension if the stretchable waist area 10 as<br>
maximally stretched in the transverse direction and set as 100%,<br>
each of the elastically stretchable wing areas 11 presents a<br>
transverse stretch stress in a range of 1.5 to 7.0 N as each<br>
of the elastically stretchable wing areas 11 is stretched to<br>
a length dimension corresponding to 120% of a second length<br>
dimension of the wing areas 11 non-stretched in the transverse<br><br>
direction and set as 100% and presents a transverse stretch<br>
stress in a range of 3.0 to 10.0 N as each of the elastically<br>
stretchable wing areas 11 is stretched to a length dimension<br>
corresponding to 150% of a second length dimension of the wing<br>
areas 11 non-stretched in the transverse direction and set as<br>
100%.<br>
[0062]<br>
In the diaper 1B, the side edge portion 9 of the rear waist<br>
region 7 presents a transverse stretch stress in a range of 5<br>
to 20 N as a third length dimension of the side edge portion<br>
9 is shortened to 90% of the third length dimension of the side<br>
edge portion maximally stretched in the transverse direction<br>
and set as 100%.<br>
[0063]<br>
The stretch stress of the elastically stretchable waist<br>
area 10 and the stretch stress of the stretchable wing areas<br>
11 were measured using the methods as have been described in<br>
connection with the embodiment of the diaper 1A. The stretch<br>
stress of the side edge portions 9 in the rear waist region 7<br>
was measured by a method as follows:<br>
(1) The transversely opposite side edge portions 9<br>
(including the second elastic members 22) of the rear waist<br>
region 7 are cut away from the diaper 1B to prepare third samples<br><br>
each having transverse dimension of 10 to 50 mm for measurement<br>
of stretch stress. INSTRON 5543 or AUTOGRAPH manufactured by<br>
INSTRON JAPAN CO. is used to measure the stretch stress.<br>
(2)	One lateral end of the third sample is held by an upper<br>
chuck and the opposite lateral end thereof is held by a lower<br>
chuck. A length dimension of the sample measured between these<br>
two chucks is 10 mm. The third sample is pulled in the vertical<br>
direction at a rate of 100 mm/min so that the upper and lower<br>
chucks may get away from each other.<br>
(3)	The third sample is stretched to a length dimension<br>
corresponding to 90% of the length dimension of the third sample<br>
maximally stretched, measured between the two chucks and set<br>
as 100%. At this moment, a stretch stress of the third sample<br>
is measured as the transverse stretch stress of the side edge<br>
portions 9 in the rear waist region 7.<br>
[0064]<br>
Stock materials for the topsheet 2 may be selected from<br>
the group consisting of a hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric<br>
having a plurality of apertures and a plastic film having a<br>
plurality of fine perforations. Stock materials for the<br>
backsheet 3 may be selected from the group consisting of a<br>
breathable hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric, a breathable<br>
liquid-impervious plastic film and a composite nonwoven fabric<br><br>
comprising two or more breathable hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven<br>
fabric layers laminated one upon another. Stock materials for<br>
the leak-barrier sheets 12 may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of a composite nonwoven fabric comprising two or more<br>
breathable hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric layers<br>
laminated one upon another and a composite sheet comprising a<br>
breathable hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric and a breathable<br>
liquid-impervious plastic film laminated upon each other.<br>
[0065]<br>
As stock materials for the backsheet 3 and the<br>
leak-barrier sheets 12, it is also possible to use a composite<br>
nonwoven fabric (SM nonwoven fabric or SMS nonwoven fabric)<br>
consisting of a melt blown fibrous nonwoven fabric having a high<br>
water-resistance and a spun bond fibrous nonwoven fabric having<br>
a high strength as well as a high flexibility laminated on at<br>
least one side of the melt blown fibrous nonwoven fabric.<br>
[0066]<br>
Fibrous nonwoven fabric used to form the top- and<br>
backsheets 2, 3, the leak-barrier sheets 12, the stretchable<br>
wing areas 11, the tape fasteners 19 and the target tape 25 may<br>
be selected from those obtained by spun lace-, needle punch-,<br>
melt blown-, thermal bond-, spun bond- and chemical<br>
bond-processes.<br><br>
The hydrophilic fibrous nonwoven fabric may be made of<br>
any one of synthetic fiber, semi-synthetic fiber and<br>
regenerated fiber each modified to become hydrophilic or<br>
conjugate fiber thereof. The hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven<br>
fabric may be formed from synthetic fiber and may contain<br>
therein semi-synthetic fiber or regenerated fiber both treated<br>
to become water repellent. While not specified, the synthetic<br>
fiber may be selected from the group consisting of polyester-,<br>
polyacrylonitrile-, polyvinyl chloride-, polyethylene-,<br>
polypropylene- and polystyrene-based fibers. The suitably<br>
useful synthetic fibers further include core-sheath type<br>
conjugate fiber, side-by-side type conjugate fiber, macaroni<br>
fiber, microporous fiber and bonded-type conjugate fiber.<br>
[0068]<br>
It is preferred to use hot melt adhesive as the adhesive.<br>
In addition to hot melt adhesive, it is also possible to use<br>
any one of acrylic adhesive and elastomeric adhesive. The<br>
adhesive may be applied on the top- and backsheets 2, 3 and the<br>
leak-barrier sheets 12 in a suitable pattern selected from the<br>
group consisting of a spiral pattern, zigzag pattern, dotted<br>
pattern and striped pattern. Application of the adhesive on<br>
these sheets 2, 3, 12 in such pattern generates adhesive-coated<br><br>
regions and adhesive-free regions, resulting in that these<br>
sheets 2, 3, 12 are permanently bonded one to another in<br>
intermittent fashion, the sheets 2, 3, 12 are bonded to one to<br>
another in an intermittent fashion and the core 4 is permanently<br>
bonded to the sheets 2, 3 and the elastic members 16, 17, 22,<br>
28 are also bonded to the sheets 2, 3, 12 in an intermittent<br>
fashion.<br>
[0069]<br>
In these diapers 1A, IB having been described in reference<br>
with the accompanying drawings, the stretchable waist area 10<br>

region 7 of the front and rear waist regions 5, 7. The first<br>
and second elastic members 16, 22 may be provided in the form<br>
of strand-like elastic members. As stock materials for the<br>
first and second elastic members 16, 22, the leg surrounding<br>
elastic members 17 and the elastic members 28, it is also<br>
possible to use natural rubber, synthetic rubber or urethane<br>
foam.<br><br>
