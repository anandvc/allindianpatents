TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
REFRIGERATOR OIL COMPOSITION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to refrigerating machine oil compositions, and more particularly to refrigerating machine oil compositions having a low viscosity, an improved energy saving performance, a good scalability and an excellent compatibility with a refrigerant which are suitably used in various refrigerating application fields, in particular, closed-system refrigerators. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ARTS<br>
In general, compression-type refrigerators are constituted from at least a compressor, a condenser, an expansion mechanism (such as expansion valve), and an evaporator and/or a dryer, and have such a structure in which a mixed liquid composed of a refrigerant and a lubricant (refrigerating machine oil) is circulated through the closed system. In the compression-type refrigerators, in general, since an inside of the compressor is kept at a high temperature whereas an inside of the cooler is kept at a low temperature although these conditions vary depending upon kinds of refrigerators, it is required that the mixed liquid is circulated through the system without undergoing a phase separation thereof into the refrigerant and the lubricant over a wide temperature range of from the low temperature to the high temperature. The refrigerant and the lubricant in the mixed liquid generally have phase separation ranges on high-temperature and low-temperature sides, respectively. A maximum temperature in the low-temperature side phase separation range is preferably -10°C or lower and more preferably -20°C or lower whereas a minimum temperature in the high-temperature side phase separation range is preferably 30°C or higher and more preferably 40°C or higher.    If the mixed liquid undergoes the phase separation during operation<br><br>
of the refrigerators, the life or operation efficiency of these apparatuses tends to be considerably adversely affected. For example, if the mixed liquid suffers from phase separation into the refrigerant and the lubricant in the compressor, poor lubrication occurs at a movable part thereof, resulting in defects such as seizing and, therefore, remarkably shortened life of the apparatuses. Whereas, if the phase separation occurs in the evaporator, a heat exchange efficiency of the apparatuses tends to be deteriorated owing to a high-viscous lubricant being present therein<br>
Hitherto, as the refrigerant for refrigerators, there have been mainly used chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), etc. However, these compounds contain chlorine causing environmental problems. For this reason, there have been presently made studies for developing alternate refrigerants containing no chlorine such as hydrofluorocarbon (HFC). However, HFC has been reported to have adverse influence on global warming. Under these circumstances, there have been noticed so-called natural refrigerants suitable for environmental protection such as hydrocarbons, ammonia and carbon dioxide.<br>
In addition, since the lubricant for refrigerators are used in order to lubricate movable parts thereof, it is also important that the lubricant has a good lubricating performance. In particular, since an inside of the compressor is likely to be kept at a high temperature, it is important that the lubricant has a viscosity capable of retaining an oil film required for a good lubrication. Although a necessary viscosity of the lubricant varies depending upon kinds of the compressor and use conditions thereof, the lubricant before mixing with the refrigerant preferably has a viscosity (kinematic viscosity) of 10 to 200 mm2/s as measured at 40°C, It has been conventionally reported that if the viscosity of the lubricant is lower than the above specified range, a thickness of an oil film formed tends to be reduced, resulting in poor lubrication, whereas if the viscosity of the lubricant is higher than the above specified range, a heat<br><br>
exchange efficiency of the refrigerators tends to be lowered,<br>
For example, there is disclosed a lubricant composition for vapor compression-type refrigerators using carbon dioxide as a refrigerant which comprises a lubricant base oil having a 10% distillation point of 400°C or higher and a 80% distillation point of 600°C or lower as measured by a gas chromatograph distillation method, a kinematic viscosity of 2 to 30 mm2/s as measured at 100°C, and a viscosity index of 100 or more (e.g., refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 294886/2001).<br>
In Examples of the above Japanese Patent Application, it is described that the kinematic viscosity of the base oil used in the lubricant composition is in the range of from 17 to 70 mm2/s as measured at 40°C.<br>
The refrigerators using a refrigerating machine oil having such a high viscosity tend to inevitably suffer from a large energy consumption. Therefore, for the purpose of saving energy for the refrigerators, studies have been made to reduce a viscosity of the refrigerating machine oil and improve frictional properties upon the lubrication.<br>
For example, in refrigerators for cold storage, an energy saving performance thereof has been improved by reducing a viscosity of the refrigerating machine oil used therein to VG32, 22, 15 and 10, respectively. However, when the viscosity of the refrigerating machine oil is further reduced, there tends to arise such a problem that a sealability and a lubricating property thereof are deteriorated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above conventional problems.

In the method of lubricating the refrigerators using the refrigerating machine oil composition of the present invention, various refrigerants and refrigerating machine oil compositions as described above may be used in such an amount that a mass ratio of the refrigerant to the refrigerating machine oil composition is from 99/1 to 10/90 and preferably from 95/5 to 30/70. When the amount of the refrigerant used is less than the above-specified range, the refrigerating performance tends to be deteriorated. When the amount of the refrigerant used is more than the above-specified range, the lubricating performance tends to be deteriorated. The refrigerating machine oil composition of the present invention can be applied to various refrigerators, in particular, can be suitably used in a compression refrigerating cycle of compression-type refrigerators.<br>
The refrigerators to which the refrigerating machine oil composition of the present invention is applied has a refrigerating cycle essentially constituted from a compressor, a condenser, an expansion system (such as expansion valve) and an evaporator, or a compressor, a condenser, an expansion system, a dryer and an evaporator. In the refrigerators, there may be used the refrigerating machine oil composition of the present invention as a refrigerating machine oil as well as various refrigerants as described above.<br><br>
The dryer is preferably filled with a drying agent made of zeolite having a pore diameter of 0,33 nm or less. Examples of the zeolite include natural zeolites and synthetic zeolites.

In the present invention, when using such a drying agent, water is efficiently removed from the refrigerating cycle without absorbing the refrigerant present in the refrigerating cycle. At the same time, since such a drying agent is prevented by itself from being powdered owing to deterioration thereof, there can be avoided occurrence of clogging of conduits with the powder or abnormal wear due to intrusion of the powder into sliding portions of the compressor. As a result, the refrigerators can be stably operated for a long period of time.<br>
In the refrigerators to which the refrigerating machine oil composition of the present invention is applied, various sliding portions (for example, bearings) are provided within the compressor thereof.

Examples  of the inorganic coating film  include  a  graphite film,   a<br><br>
diamond-like carbon film, a nickel film, a molybdenum film, a tin film and a chromium film in view of good sealability, slidability and abrasion resistance. These inorganic coating films may be formed by either plating treatment or PVD (physical vapor deposition) method.<br>
In addition, the sliding portions may be made of a conventional alloy material such as, for example, Fe-based alloys, Al-based alloys and Cu-based alloys.<br>
The refrigerating machine oil composition of the present invention may be suitably used in various hot water supply systems or refrigerating and heating systems for air conditioners for automobiles, gas heat pumps, general-purpose air conditioning equipments, refrigerators, automatic vending machines or showcases,<br>

The refrigerating machine oil composition of the present invention is composed of a base oil containing a polyvinyl ether and/or a polyoxyalkylene glycol derivative as a main component thereof, and can exhibit a low viscosity, an improved energy saving performance and an excellent compatibility with a refrigerant.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention will be described in more detail by referring to the following examples.   However, it should be noted that these examples are only illustrative and not intended to limit the invention thereto.    Meanwhile, various properties of the base oil as well as the refrigerating machine oil composition were measured by the following methods. <properties of base oil><br><br>

(2)	Flash Point<br>
Measured by C.O.C. method according to JIS K2265, <properties of refrigerating machine oil composition><br>
(3)	Solubility of Refrigerant in Refrigerating Machine Oil Composition<br>
A saturation solubility of isobutane in the refrigerating machine oil composition was measured at 20°C under 0,2 MPa using a solubility measuring apparatus.    The mass percent as the saturation solubility of isobutane was the value obtained by measuring an amount of isobutane contained in an oil layer sampled,<br>
(4)	Sealed Tube Test<br>
The catalyst composed of Fe, Cu and Al was charged into a glass tube. Further, a sample oil and a refrigerant (isobutane) were filled into the glass tube in such an amount that a ratio of the sample oil to the refrigerant was 4 mL/1 g, and then the glass tube was sealed.    The contents in the glass tube were allowed to stand at 175°C for 30 days, and then observed to evaluate or determine an appearance of each of the oil and the catalyst, occurrence or non-occurrence of sludge therein, and an acid value thereof,<br>
(5)	Short Circuit Test<br>
Using a short circuit tester (reciprocating-type refrigerator; capillary length: 1 m), the 1000 h endurance test was conducted under the following conditions to measure a rate of decease in capillary flow amount after the test^<br>
Discharge pressure Pd/suction pressure Pg: 3.3 MPa/0.4 MPa! discharge-side temperature Td/suction-side temperature Tg: 110°C/30°C; and sample oil amount/refrigerant ("R600a": isobutane) amount: 400 g/400 g,<br>
(6)	Sealability Comparison Test<br>
Using various sliding members as a piston, blow-by gas amounts<br><br>
discharged from a clearance between the piston and cylinder were compared with each other.   The respective blowby gas amounts were expressed by a relative value calculated assuming that the blowby gas amount obtained in Reference Example 2 was regarded as 25,<br>
EXAMPLES 1 TO 12 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 TO 3<br>
The refrigerating machine oils and the refrigerating machine oil compositions as shown in Table 1 were prepared, and subjected to measurement for a solubility of the refrigerant therein as well as the sealed tube test.    The result are shown in Table 1,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

From Table 1, it was confirmed that the refrigerating machine oils obtained in Examples 1 to 3 according to the present invention exhibited a good solubility of the refrigerant (isobutane) therein, whereas the refrigerating machine oils obtained in Comparative Examples 2 and 3 had a poor solubility of the refrigerant therein.    In addition, the refrigerating machine oils and the refrigerating machine oil compositions obtained in Examples 1 to 12 all exhibited good results of the sealed tube test.<br>
EXAMPLES 13 TO 21 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 4 TO 6<br>
The sample oils as shown in Table 2 were subjected to the short circuit test.    The result are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
From Table % it was confirmed that the refrigerating machine oil compositions obtained in Examples 13 to 18 exhibited a water content in system of less than 60 ppm by mass and a residual air content of less than 8 kPa and, therefore, showed good results of the short circuit test.<br>
On the other hand, the refrigerating machine oil compositions obtained in Examples 19 to 21 exhibited either a water content in system of more than 60 ppm by mass or a residual air content of more than 8 kPa,    Therefore, results of the short circuit test obtained in Examples 19 to 21 were slightly deteriorated as compared to those obtained in Examples 13 to 18.<br>
Also, the refrigerating machine oil compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 4 to 6 suffered from seizing of the compressor or clogging of the capillary when subjected to the short circuit test.<br>
EXAMPLES 22 TO 25 AND REFERENCE EXAMPLES 1 AND 2<br>
