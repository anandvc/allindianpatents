				<td>The present invention relates to a temperature-sensitive safety valve<br>
assembly.<br>
It is known to provide a temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly,<br>
which, at high temperature, shutoff a gas supply. However, the various<br>
methods employed to sense a high temperature and shut off a safety<br>
valve in a gas supply line have shortcomings.<br>
It is, therefore, an aim of the invention to provide an improved<br>
temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a<br>
temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly comprising a first region for<br>
a first pressurised gas, the region having a first outlet, a second region<br>
for a second pressurised gas/ air, the second region comprising a heat-<br>
sensitive sealing means, a valve between the first and second regions<br>
adapted to be actuated by the pressure of a first pressurised gas/air in<br>
the first region against biasing means to open the outlet, wherein the<br>
heat-sensitive sealing means in the second region fails at high<br>
temperature so as to de-pressurise the second region, thereby actuating<br>
the valve to move under the biasing means to close the first outlet and<br>
seal the first region.<br>
In this way, at a certain high temperature, the valve can simply,<br>
efficiently, cheaply and quickly shutoff a gas supply to, say, a building.<br>
The heat-sensitive sealing means may be an openable and closeable<br>
door, a shape-resuming material which deforms from an open to a<br>
closed position and vice versa or a solid door which melts to open<br>
region. Preferably, the sealing means comprises a fragile part.<br>
The first region and/or second region may be designed to accommodate<br>
a liquid.<br>
Preferably the first region and/or second region is designed to<br>
accommodate a flammable gas. Most preferably the first region is<br>
designed to accommodate a flammable gas such as natural gas and/or<br>
the second region is designed to accommodate air The heat-sensitive<br>
sealing means is preferably located outside the first region.<br>
Most preferably the sealing means is located on an outside surface of the<br>
assembly.<br>
This reduces the time lag between sensing a fire and closing the outlet.<br>
The second region preferably comprises a receptacle (made of non-metal<br>
temperature-sensitive material). The receptacle is preferably (partly or<br>
completely) made of (UPVC) plastics material. Most preferably, the<br>
receptacle comprises a conduit. In one form of the invention, the<br>
conduit is frangeable at high temperature to de-pressurise the second<br>
region. The conduit may be more than one metre long, preferably more<br>
than ten metres long and in some embodiments longer than20 metres.<br>
The conduit may follow a gas supply pipe along part of, and in some<br>
embodiments along the total length of the gas supply pipe. The conduit<br>
may comprise a flexible part, and may take the form of a flexible hose.<br>
The heat-sensitive sealing means preferably comprises a glass bulb. The<br>
heat-sensitive sealing means is designed to shatter (or fail) the<br>
temperature of a fire.<br>
The heat-sensitive sealing means is preferably designed and/or<br>
orientated to fail so that it does not, in error, still seal the receptacle after<br>
failure. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the heat-<br>
sensitive sealing means is designed to face downwards (so that when the<br>
glass bulb breaks the remaining parts of the glass bulb fall away from the<br>
opening in the receptacle).<br>
A diaphragm is preferably arranged between the first region and the<br>
second region so as to prevent mixing of a first pressurised fluid and<br>
second pressurised fluid.<br>
Preferably, the second region comprises an inlet valve for refilling of<br>
fluid, most preferably one which is dedicated to that sole use. The inlet<br>
valve may be in direct communication with a. housing for the valve, or<br>
remote therefrom.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, one or more further<br>
temperature-sensitive safety valve assemblies are provided, the or each<br>
further temperature-sensitive safety valve assemblies being similar to the<br>
temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly, wherein at least one of the<br>
or each further temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly is in<br>
communication with the temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly so<br>
that de-sealing of the heat sensitive sealing means on the second region<br>
of the or each further temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly is<br>
communicated to the temperature-sensitive safely valve assembly to shut<br>
the outlet of the temperature-sensitive safely valve assembly.<br>
The or each further temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly are all<br>
preferably in communication with the temperature-sensitive safely valve<br>
assembly.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a<br>
temperature-sensitive safety valve actuator assembly, comprising a<br>
region for a pressurised gas such as air and heat sensitive sealing<br>
means on the region, to close the region, and a valve actuator, the<br>
temperature-sensitive safety valve actuator assembly being designed to<br>
be fitted to a valve assembly for a gas/air supply line, and the heat<br>
sensitive sealing means being de-sealable at high temperature to de-<br>
pressurise the region, to move the valve actuator so as to actuate a valve<br>
assembly and close a region for containing gas/air.<br>
Preferably, the valve actuator is biased by biasing means such as a spring.<br>
Also, preferably mere is a diaphragm in the temperature-sensitive safety<br>
valve actuator assembly which is designed to separate the pressurised<br>
gas/air in the region and another pressurised gas/air within a gas/air<br>
supply pipe line.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a building<br>
having a temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly of temperature-<br>
sensitive safety valve actuator assembly in accordance with, respectively,<br>
the first or second aspect of the invention fitted thereto.<br>
A temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly in accordance with the<br>
invention will now be described, by way of example only, and with<br>

FIGURE 12 is a side view of the assembly of Figure 10, and<br>
FIGURE 13 is a side view of part of the assembly of Figure 10.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly 10<br>
comprises a temperature-sensitive safety valve device 12, a regulator 14<br>
and a gas pipe 16.<br>
The temperature safety valve device 12 comprises a housings, inside of<br>
which is a cavity in communication with a conduit 20.<br>
The housing 18 comprises a valve seat 22, which defines an aperture<br>
between the housing 18 and the regulator 14.<br>
A fastener 24 is arranged, at a remote end of the housing 18 for<br>
fastening the housing 18 to the regulator 14.<br>
The housing 18 comprises a valve stem (or spindle) 26, arranged with a<br>
valve head 28 inside the housing above seat22. A second valve head27 is<br>
provided at the other end of the stem 26, A spring 30 is arranged around<br>
the stem26 between the valve head 28 and a wall of the housing 18. The<br>
valve stem 22 has a secondary stem 26a, which extends from valve<br>
head27, in line with valve stem 26. The secondary stem 26a has a head<br>
26b at an end remote from the end of the secondary stem which<br>
extends from the second valve head 27.A diaphragm 32 is arranged<br>
above the valve head 28.<br>
The conduit 20 is made of plastics-The conduit 20 is generally U-shaped.<br>
The conduit 20 has a closure member 34, at one end which takes the<br>
form of a glass bulb 36. The conduit has another closure member 36, at<br>
another end, which takes the form of a chamber having a one-way valve<br>
to allow gas refilling of the conduit 20. A threaded pipe 38 is provided,<br>
in communication with the closure member 36, and directly adjacent<br>
thereto, to allow connection of a gas supply and prompt refilling of the<br>
conduit 20.<br>
The regulator 14, comprises a chamber 40, of dome-like form. The<br>
chamber40 has an inner cavity. The chamber 40 has an aperture defined<br>
by a wall 42. The fastener 24 of the housing is threaded onto the outside<br>
of wall 42. This step is preceded by introducing the valve stem 26 into<br>
the chamber 40. The chamber 40 has an annular recess 44. The recess 44<br>
houses a diaphragm 46, on which the valve head 27 of the valve stem26<br>
acts. An opening 48 in the chamber 40 allows gas to escape from the<br>
chamber to the atmosphere.<br>
The pipe 16 comprises a first pipe part 50 and a second pipe part 52,<br>
which are, respectively; arranged before and after the temperature-<br>
sensitive safety valve device 12.The first part 50 has an outlet defined by<br>
a valve seat 54. The second part52 has an inlet 56. The outlet54 and the<br>
inlet 56 are in communication with the chamber 40 of the regulator 14.<br>
The secondary stem 26a is arranged so that the valve head 26b is<br>
arranged inside the seat 54 of the pipe part 50. Inside the chamber 40, a<br><br>
spring 58 is arranged between an underside of the diaphragm 46 and the first<br>
pipe part 50.<br>
Suitable K-values for the springs 30 and 28 are utilized.<br>
Other features of the temperature-sensitive valve assembly can be seen from<br>
FIGURE 1.<br>
In use, the first pipe part 50 of the gas pipe 16 is connected to a mains gas<br>
supply. Ordinarily, the closure member 34 (i. e. the bulb 36 in one preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention) is intact. Therefore pressure caused by presence<br>
of a high pressure gas (such as air) in the conduit 20 acts on the diaphragm 32 to<br>
force the valve head 28 and the valve stem 26 down, against the bias of the<br>
spring 30. Consequently, the valve head26b moves away from the seat 54 to<br>
allow gas there through. Gas is then diverted by the diaphragm 46 into the<br>
second pipe part 52 of the pipe 16. In this way, gas is free to move through the<br>
second pipe part 52 of the pipel6 to other parts, for example, to a network of<br>
pipes in a building.<br>
In the case of a high temperature, for example a fire, the<br>
closure member 34 fails. In the embodiment shown, shattered pieces of<br>
the bulb 36 fall downwards so as to not obstruct the conduit<br>
20. The pressure in the conduit 20 falls leading to the valve stem 26 and<br>
the valve secondary stem 26a moving towards the conduit 20 (i. e. upwards in<br>
Figure 1), under the force of the spring 58, until the valve head 26b of<br>
the secondary stem 26a moves into sealing contact with the valve<br>
seat 54 of the first pipe part 50 of the gas pipe 16. In this way, the temperature<br>
sensitive safety valve assembly 10 in accordance with the invention<br>
quickly, efficiently, cheaply and simply shuts off the gas pipel6.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 2, a temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly<br>
100, in accordance with another embodiment of the invention, is fitted<br>
in series with a gas supply line 102 and a gas meter 104, from which a<br>
gas pipe 106 is ducted to, say, part of a building.<br>
The line 102 has a mechanical shut off lever 108 to stop gas entering the<br>
temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly 100 and building. The<br>
temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly 100 has a tube 110 arranged<br>
between a regulator part 112 and a housing parti 14 of the temperature-<br>
sensitive safety valve assembly.<br>
The conduit 116 is, as in the previous embodiment, fitted to the<br>
temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly 100 via a T-piece connector<br>
to the housing part 114. The conduit 116 extends generally horizontally.<br>
At one end of the conduit 116 there is a valve closure member 118. At<br>
the other end of the conduit 116, the conduit extends slightly vertically<br>
downwards and a bulb-type closure member 120 is arranged thereon. It<br>
will be appreciated that the temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly<br>
100 works in a manner similar to the arrangement of FIGURE 1 and as<br>
such a full description of the working can be omitted.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 3, a balding 150 has a plurality of floors Outside<br>
the building 150 a gas mainline 152 communicates with a main<br><br>
temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly 154. The main temperature safety<br>
valve assembly 154 is in communication with secondary safety valve<br>
assemblies 156, 158, 160, 162, 164 on, say, each floor. Of course, this<br>
distribution of the secondary temperature safety valve assemblies could be<br>
varied depending on requirements. A gas line 166 extends through the floors,<br>
leading to secondary gas lines 168, 170, 172, 174, 176, supplying gas to each<br>
floor. An airline 178 also extends from the main temperature-sensitive safety<br>
valve assembly 154 to the secondary temperature-sensitive safety valve<br>
assemblies 156-164 via, respectively, secondary airlines, 180, 182, 184, 186,<br>
188. In use, failure, and the consequent shut- off, of a secondary temperature-<br>
sensitive safety valve 156-164 depressurises the airline 178 so as to shut-off the<br>
main temperature-sensitive safely valve assembly 154, outside the building.<br>
This is of course advantageous in that a fire inside the building is not fuelled.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, another temperature-sensitive safety valve assembly in<br>
accordance with the invention is shown. A furnace 200 has an on-off gas supply<br>
switch 202. Actuation of the switch 202 opens and closes an inlet (not shown) to<br>
allow gas to communicate via pipe 204 with the burner of the furnace. A burner<br>
region206 is shown. Above this, there is arranged a flue 208. A temperature-<br>
sensitive safety valve assembly 210 is arranged on an inside surface of an<br>
inclined wall of the flue 108. A one-way valve 212 of the safety valve assembly<br>
210 is arranged on a line 214 to a bulb 216 in the flue 208. In the event that the<br>
flue 208 becomes blocked hot gases will return down the flue causing the bulb<br>
to break, which in turn will close off the temperature-sensitive safety valve<br>
assembly 210 by thereby stopping gas flowing through the pipe 204 to the<br>
burner.<br><br>
Referring to Figures 5 to 9, a safety valve assembly250 in accordance<br>
with the invention comprises a body258 defining a. chamber for air bolts<br>
251, as inflation point 252, a 15 mm outlet253 and a 28 mm outlet 254.<br>
The 15 mm outlet 253 is in communication via. a conduit (not shown)<br>
with a closure member as described with reference to Figure 1. The 28<br>
mm outlet 254 is in communication with a fuel line (not shown).<br>
The assembly 250 has a lower body 255 defining a gasket chamber 257,<br>
which supports a rod262, a rubber washer261, a spring 263, and a rod<br>
holder 270 (optionally of PVC).<br>
Figure 9 shows the spoked, wheel-like, structure of the rod holder 270.<br>
The lower body 255 comprises a28 mm inlet269, which is put in<br>
communication with a fuel line (not shown).<br>
Operation of the assembly 250 follows, in general, the principles of<br>
operation of the assembly 10 described above.<br>
Referring to Figures 10 to 13, another safety valve assembly 280<br>
comprises some similar parts to the safety valve 250 and therefore such<br>
parts will not be described again.<br>
Referring to FigurelO, the total height of the body equals the height A of<br>
the upper body (A=30 mm) and the height B of the lower body (B = 87<br>
mm). The inflating point 282, outlet284, outlet 286, and inlet 288 are,<br>
respectively 1/2" BSP, 1/2" BSP, 1" BSP and 1" BSP.<br>
Referring to Figure 11, the distance C between diametrically opposed<br>
bolts is 58 mm.<br>
Referring to Figure 12, the distance D from the bottom of the body to<br>
the centre of the outlet286 is49. 5 mm. The distance E from the centre<br>
of the outlet 286 to the centre of the outlet 284 is 52. 5 mm. The<br>
distance G from the bottom of the body to the lower<br>
edge of the region about the outlet286 is 27 mm. The distance across the<br>
region about the outlet 286 is 45mm.<br>
Referring to Figure 13, a valve assembly290 comprises a diaphram 292,<br>
spring seats294, a spring296, a centre rod 298, a rubber sea1300 and a<br>
backing washer302.<br>
The valve in accordance with the invention can be made to tolerate<br>
pressures up to6000 PSI.<br>
The conduit can be a flexible hose.<br><br>
