				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
he invention concerns certain novel quinazoline compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which possess anti-tumour activity and are accordingly useful in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also concerns processes for the manufacture of said quinazoline derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapeutic methods, for example in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the prevention or treatment of solid tumour disease in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many of the current treatment regimes for diseases resulting from the abnormal regulation of cellular proliferation such as psoriasis and cancer, utilise compounds that inhibit DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. To date, compounds used in such treatments are generally toxic to cells however their enhanced effects on rapidly dividing cells such as tumour cells can be beneficial. Alternative approaches to these cytotoxic anti-tumour agents are currently being developed, for example selective inhibitors of cell signalling pathways.<br>
These types of inhibitors are likely to have the potential to display an enhanced selectivity of action against tumour cells and so are likely to reduce the probability of the therapy possessing unwanted side effects.<br>
Eukaryotic cells are continually responding to many diverse extracellular signals that enable communication between cells within an organism. These signals regulate a wide variety of physical responses in the cell including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and motility. The extracellular signals take the form of a diverse variety of soluble factors including growth factors as well as paracrine and endocrine factors. By binding to specific transmembrane receptors, these ligands integrate the extracellular signal to the intracellular signalling pathways, therefore transducing the signal across the plasma membrane and allowing the individual cell to respond to its extracellular signals. Many of these signal transduction processes utilise the reversible process of the phosphorylation of proteins that are involved in the promotion of these diverse cellular responses. The phosphorylation status of target proteins is regulated by specific kinases and phosphatases that are responsible for the regulation of about one third of all proteins encoded by the mammalian genome. As phosphorylation is such an important regulatory mechanism in the signal transduction process, it is therefore  not surprising  that aberrations in these intracellular pathways result in<br><br>
abnormal cell growth and differentiation and so promote cellular transformation (reviewed in Cohen et al, Curr Opin Chem BioK 1999,3,459-465).<br>
It has been widely shown that a number of these tyrosine kinases are mutated to constitutively active forms and/or when over-expressed result in the transformation of a variety of human cells. These mutated and over-expressed forms of the kinase are present in a large proportion of human tumours (reviewed in Kolibaba et al, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1997,133, F217-F248), As tyrosine kinases play fundamental roles in the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of tissues, much focus has centred on these enzymes in the development of novel anti-cancer therapies. This family of enzymes is divided into two groups - receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases e.g. EGF Receptors and the SRC family respectively. From the results of a large number of studies including the Human Genome Project, about 90 tyrosine kinase have been identified in the human genome, of mis 58 are of the receptor type and 32 are of the non-receptor type. These can be compartmentalised in to 20 receptor tyrosine kinase and 10 non-receptor tyrosine kinase sub-families (Robinson et a/, Oncoeene. 2000,12,5548-5557).<br>
The receptor tyrosine kinases are of particular importance in the transmission of mitogenic signals that initiate cellular replication. These large glycoproteins, which span the plasma membrane of the cell possess an extracellular binding domain for their specific ligands (such as Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) for the EGF Receptor). Binding of ligand results in the activation of the receptor"s kinase enzymatic activity that is encoded by the intracellular portion of the receptor. This activity phosphorylates key tyrosine amino acids in target proteins, resulting in the transduction of proliferative signals across the plasma membrane of the cell.<br>
It is known that the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which include EGFR, erbB2, erbB3 and erbB4, are frequently involved in driving the proliferation and survival of tumour cells (reviewed in Olayioye etal.. EMBO J.. 2000,19,3159). One mechanism in which this can be accomplished is by overexpression of the receptor at the protein level, generally as a result of gene amplification. This has been observed in many common human cancers (reviewed in Klapper et aL Adv- Cancer Res.. 2000,21» 25) such as breast cancer (Sainsbury et al., Brit. J. Cancer. 1988,58,458; Guerin ej a]., Oncogene Res.. 1988,3, 21; Slamon etal.. Science. 1989,244.707; Kh"jn et aL, Breast Cancer Res. Treat.. 1994,2j&gt;, 73 and reviewed in Salomon et al., Grit Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995,19,183), non-small cell<br>
lung cancers (NSCLCs) including adenocarcinomas (Cerny et al., Brit. J. Cancer. 1986, 54, 265; Reubi etal, Int. J. Cancer. 1990,45, 269; Rusch et al., Cancer Research, 1993, 53, 2379; Brabender etal. Clin. Cancer Res.. 2001, 7,1850) as well as other cancers of the lung (Hendler et al., Cancer Cells. 1989,7, 347; Ohsaki et al.. Oncol. Rep.. 2000, 7,603), bladder cancer (Neal et al., Lancet, 1985, 366; Chow et al.. Clin. Cancer Res.. 2001,7,1957, Zhau et al., Mol Carcinog.. 3,254), oesophageal cancer (Mukaida et al., Cancer. 1991, 68,142), gastrointestinal cancer such as colon, rectal or stomach cancer (Bolen et al., Oncogene Res.. 1987,1,149; Kapitanovic etal.. Gastroenterologv. 2000,112,1103; Ross etal.. Cancer Invest.. 2001,19,554), cancer of the prostate (Visakorpi et al., Histochem. J.. 1992,24,481; Kumar et ai.. 2000,3^, 73; Scheretal.. J. Natl. Cancer Inst.. 2000, 92,1866), leukaemia (Konaka etal.. Cell. 1984, 3J, 1035, Martin-Subero et al.. Cancer Genet Cvtogenet.. 2001, 127.174), ovarian (Hellstrom etal.. Cancer Res.. 2001,61,2420), head and neck (Shiga et al., Head Neck. 2000,22,599) or pancreatic cancer (Ovotny et al.. Neoplasma. 2001,48, 188). As more human tumour tissues are tested for expression of the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases it is expected that their widespread prevalence and importance will be further enhanced in the future.<br>
As a consequence of the mis-regulation of one or more of these receptors (in particular erbB2), it is widely believed that many tumours become clinically more aggressive and so correlate with a poorer prognosis for the patient (Brabender et al, Clin. Cancer Res.. 2001,7, 1850; Ross etal. Cancer Investigation. 2001,19,554, Yu etal.. Bioessavs. 2000,22.7.673). In addition to these clinical findings, a wealth of pre-clinical information suggests that the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in cellular transformation. This includes the observations that many tumour cell lines overexpress one or more of the erbB receptors and that EGFR or erbB2 when transfected into non-tumour cells have the ability to transform these cells. This tumourigenic potential has been further verified as transgenic mice that overexpress erbB2 spontaneously develop tumours in the mammary gland. In addition to this, a number of pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that anti-proliferative effects can be induced by knocking out one or more erbB activities by small molecule inhibitors, dominant negatives or inhibitory antibodies (reviewed in Mendelsohn etal.. Oncogene. 2000,19, 6550). Thus it has been recognised that inhibitors of these receptor tyrosine kinases should be of value as a selective inhibitor of the proliferation of mammalian cancer cells (Yaish et al Science. 1988, 242.933, Kolibaba et al, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1997,133. F217-F248; Al-Obeidi et al 2000, Oncogene. 19,5690-5701; Mendelsohn et<br>
al, 2000, Oncogene. 19,6550-6565). In addition to this pre-clinical data, findings using inhibitory antibodies against EGFR and erbB2 (c-225 and trastuzumab respectively) have proven to be beneficial in the clinic for the treatment of selected solid tumours (reviewed in Mendelsohn et al, 2000, Oncogene. 19,6550-6565).<br>
Amplification and/or activity of members of die ErbB type receptor tyrosine kinases have been detected and so have been implicated to play a role in a number of non-malignant proliferative disorders such as psoriasis (Ben-Bassat, Curr. Pharm. Des.. 2000,6,933; Elder el ah, Science, 1989,243.811), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Kumar eUl., Lit Urol. Nephroi.. 2000,32_,73), atherosclerosis and restenosis (Bokemeyer eta!.. Kidnev Int.. 2000, 58,549). It is therefore expected that inhibitors of erbB type receptor tyrosine kinases will be useful in the treatment of these and other non-malignant disorders of excessive cellular proliferation.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have now found that surprisingly certain quinazoline derivatives substituted at the 5-position with a substituent containing an acylaminoethoxy group possess potent anti-tumour activity. Without wishing to imply that the compounds disclosed in the present invention possess pharmacological activity only by virtue of an effect on a single biological process, it is believed that the compounds provide an anti-tumour effect by way of inhibition of one or more of the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in the signal transduction steps which lead to the proliferation of tumour cells. In particular, it is believed that the compounds of the present invention provide an anti-tumour effect by way of inhibition of EGFR and/or erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinases.<br>
Generally the compounds of the present invention possess potent inhibitory activity against the erbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, for example by inhibition of EGFR and/or erbB2 and/or erbB4 receptor tyrosine kinases, whilst possessing less potent inhibitory activity against other kinases. Furthermore, generally the compounds of the present invention possess substantially better potency against the erbB2 over that of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, thus potentially providing effective treatment for erbB2 driven tumours. Accordingly, it may be possible to administer a compound according to the present invention at a dose that is sufficient to inhibit erbB2 tyrosine kinase whilst having no significant effect upon EGFR (or other) tyrosine kinases. The selective inhibition provided by the compounds according to the present invention may provide treatments for conditions mediated by erbB2 tyrosine kinase, whilst reducing undesirable side effects that may be associated with the inhibition of other tyrosine kinases. Generally the compounds according to the invention also exhibit favourable DMPK properties, for example high bioavailability, and favourable physical properties such as solubility.<br>
Furthermore, many of the compounds according to the present invention are inactive or only weakly active in a hERG assay.<br>

agent, such as a carbodiimide, or a suitable peptide coupling agent, for example O-(7-<br>
a2abenzolriazol-l-yl)-NJN[N"-tetramemyluronium hexafluoro-phosphate (HATU) or a<br>
carbodiimide such as dicyclohexvlcaibodiimide, optionally in the presence of a catalyst such<br>
as dimethylaminopyridine or 4-pvrrolidinopyridine.<br>
The coupling reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of a suitable base. A<br>
suitable base is, for example, an organic amine base such as, for example, pyridine,<br>
2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, di-isopropylethylamine,<br>

dimethylsulfoxide. The reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature in the range, for<br>
example, from 0 to 120°C, conveniently at or near ambient temperature.<br>
By the term "reactive derivative" of the carboxylic acid of the formula HI is meant a<br>
carboxylic acid derivative mat will react with the qvrinazoline of formula n to give the<br>
corresponding amide. A suitable reactive derivative of a carboxylic acid of the formula HI is,<br>
for example, an acyl halide, for example an acyl chloride formed by the reaction of the acid<br>
and an inorganic acid chloride, for example thionyl chloride; a mixed anhydride, for example<br>

base, such as those described above, and hi a suitable solvent, such as those described above.<br>
The reaction may conveniently be performed at a temperature as described above.<br>
Preparation of Starting Materials for Process (a)<br>
Compounds of formula ID (and reactive derivatives thereof) are commercially<br>
available compounds or they are known in the literature, or they can be prepared by standard<br>
processes known in the art.<br>
The quinazoline of the formula II may be obtained by conventional procedures. For<br>
example, as illustrated in Reaction Scheme 1:<br>
wherein L2 and L3 are suitable displaceable groups, provided that L3 is more labile<br>
than L2, and R1, R2, R3, R. R4, R5, R5, R6, X1, Q1, m, and have any of the meanings<br>
defined hereinbefore except that any functional group is protected if necessary during the<br>
reaction set out above, which protecting groupCs) are removed if necessary at an appropriate<br>
stage in Reaction Scheme 1. For example, instead of using the compound of formula lid in<br>
step (ii) of Reaction Scheme I, the compound nd" (including a protecting group) could be<br>
used:<br>
followed by removal of the protecting group, by an appropriate method known to a<br>
person skilled in the art.<br>
A suitable displaceable group L2 is for example haiogeno or a sulfonyloxy group, for<br>
example fluoro, chloro, methylsulfonyloxy or toluene-4-sulfonyloxy group, particularly<br>

or an alkoxy, aryloxy, mercapto, alkylthio, arylthio, alkylsulfinyl, arylsulfmyl, alkylsulfonyl,<br>
arylsulfonyl, alkylsulfonyloxy or arylsulfonyloxy group, for example a chloro, bromo,<br>
methoxy, phenoxy, pentafluorophenoxy, methylthio, methanesulfonyl, methanesulfonyloxy or<br>
toluene-4-sulfonyloxy group. Preferably L2 and L3 are bom haiogeno, for example L2 is<br>
fluoro and L3 is chloro.<br>
The reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of an acid. Suitable acids<br>
include, for example hydrogen chloride gas (conveniently dissolved in a suitable inert solvent<br>
such as diethyl ether or dioxane) or hydrochloric acid.<br>
Alternatively the quinazoline derivative of the formula Ha, wherein L3 is haiogeno<br>
(for example chloro), may be reacted with the compound of the formula lib in the absence of<br>
an acid or a base. In this reaction displacement of the haiogeno leaving group L3 results in the<br>
formation of the acid HL3 in-situ and the autocatalysis of the reaction.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction of the quinazoline derivative of formula Ila with the<br>
compound of formula lib may be carried out in the presence of a suitable base. A suitable<br>
base is, for example, an organic amine base such as, for example, pyridine, 2,64utidhie,<br>
collidine, 4-dimethylaminopYridine, triethylamine, di-isopropylethylamine,<br>
N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclo[S.4.0]undec-7-ene, or, for example, an alkali or alkaline<br>
earth metal carbonate, for example sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate,<br>
calcium carbonate, or, for example, an alkali metal hydride, for example sodium hydride.<br>
The above reactions are conveniently carried out in the presence of a suitable inert<br>
solvent or diluent, for example an alcohol or ester such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or<br>
ethyl acetate, a halogenated solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon<br>
tetrachloride, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxan, an aromatic solvent such as<br>
tolviene, or a dipolar aprotic solvent such as N-dimethylformamide, <br>
H,H-diniethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dimethylsulfoxide. The above<br>
reactions are conveniently carried out at a temperature in the range, for example, 0 to 250°C,<br>
conveniently in the range 40 to 80°C or, preferably, at or near the reflux temperature of the<br>
solvent when used.<br>
Step (u)<br>
The reaction a quinazoline of the formula lie and the alcohol of the formula Ud is<br>
suitably carried out in the presence of a suitable base, for example a strong non-nucleophilic<br>
base such as an alkali metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, or an alkali metal amide,<br>
for example lithium di-isopropylamide (IDA).<br>
The reaction of the quinazoline of the formula Die and the alcohol of the formula Hd is<br>
conveniently carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent or diluent, for example a<br>
halogenated solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride, an ether<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane, an aromatic solvent such as toluene, or a dipolar<br>
aprotic solvent such as M-dimethylibnnamide, fimemyiaeetamide,<br>
N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dimemylsulfoxide. The reaction is conveniently carried out at a<br>
temperature in the range of, for example, 10 to 250°C, preferably in the range 40 to 150°C.<br>
Conveniently, mis reaction may also be performed by heating the reactants in a sealed vessel<br>
using a suitable heating apparatus such as a microwave heater.<br>
Conveniently, the reaction a quinazoline of the formula He and the alcohol of the<br>
formula nd is performed in the presence of a suitable catalyst, for example a crown ether<br>
such as lS-crown-5.<br>

The protecting groups used in the processes above may in general be chosen from any<br>
of the groups described in the literature or known to the skilled chemist as appropriate for the<br>
protection of the group in question and may be introduced by conventional methods.<br>
Protecting groups may be removed by any convenient method as described in the literature or<br>
known to the skilled chemist as appropriate for the removal of the protecting group in ,<br>
question, such methods being chosen so as to effect removal of the protecting group with<br>
minimum disturbance of groups elsewhere in the molecule.<br>
Specific examples of protecting groups are given below for the sake of convenience,<br>
in which "lower", as in, for example, lower alkyl, signifies that the group to which it is<br>
applied preferably has 1 to 4 carbon atoms. It will be understood that these examples are not<br>
exhaustive. Where specific examples of methods for the removal of protecting groups are<br>
given below these are similarly not exhaustive. The use of protecting groups and methods of<br>
deprotection not specifically mentioned are, of course, within the scope of the invention.<br>
A carboxy protecting group may be the residue of an ester-forming aliphatic or<br>
arylaliphatic alcohol or of an ester-forming silanol (the said alcohol or silanol preferably<br>
containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms). Examples of carboxy protecting groups include straight or<br>
branched chain (l-12C)aIkyl groups (for example isopropyl, and tort-butyl):<br>
lower alkoxy-lower alkyl groups (for example methoxymethyl, ethoxymethyl and<br>
isobutoxymethyl); lower acyloxy-lower alkyl groups, (for example acetoxymethyl,<br>
propionyloxymethyl, butyryloxymethyl andpivaloyloxymethyl); lower<br>
alkoxycarbonyloxy-lower alkyl groups (for example 1-methoxycarbonyloxyethyl and<br>
1-cthoxycarbonyloxyethyl); aryl-lower alkyl groups (for example benzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl,<br>
2-nitrobenzyl, 4-nitrobcnzyl, benzhydryl and phthalidyl); tri(lower alkyl)silyi groups (for<br>
example trimethylsilvl and j^-butyldimethylsilyl); tri(lower alkyl)silyl-lower alkyl groups<br>
(for example trimethylsilylcthyl); and (2-6C)alkenyl groups (for example allyl). Methods<br>
particularly appropriate for the removal of carboxyl protecting groups include for example,<br>
acid-, base-, metal- or enzymically-catalysed cleavage.<br>
Examples of hydroxy protecting groups include lower alkyl groups (for example<br>
tejl-butyl), lower alkenyl groups (for example allyl); lower alkanoyl groups (for example<br>
acetyl); lower alkoxycarbonyl groups (for example tert-butoxvcarbonvlV.<br>
lower alkenyloxycarbonyl groups (for example allyloxycarbonyl); aryl-lower alkoxycarbonyl<br>
groups (for example benzyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl,<br>
2-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl and4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl); tri(lower alkyl)silyl (for example<br>
trimethylsilyl and lerj-butyldimethylsilyl) and aryl-lower alkyl (for example benzyl) groups.<br>
Examples of ammo protecting groups include formyl, aryl-lower alkyl groups (for<br>
example benzyl and substituted benzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, 2-nitrobenzyl and<br>
2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, and triphenylmethyl); lower alkenyl groups (for example allyl)<br>
di-4-anisylmethyl and furylmethyl groups; lower alkoxycarbonyl (for example<br>
tert-butoxycarbonyl); lower alkenyloxycarbonyl (for example allyloxycarbonyl); aryl-lower<br>
alkoxycarbonyl groups (for example benzyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl,<br>
2-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl); lower alkanoyloxyalkyl groups (for<br>
example pivaloyloxymethyl); trialkylsilyl (for example trimethylsilyl and<br>
igt-butyldimethylsilyl); alkyh"dene (for example methylidene) and benzylidene and<br>
substituted benzylidene groups.<br>
Methods appropriate for removal of hydroxy and amino protecting groups include, for<br>
example, acid-, base-, metal- or enzymically-catalysed hydrolysis for groups such as<br>
2-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl and allyl, hydrogenation for groups such as benzyl and<br>
photolytically for groups such as 2-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl. For example a tertbutoxycarbonyl<br>
protecting group may be removed from an amino group by an acid catalysed<br>
hydrolysis using trifluoroacetic acid.<br>

It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of<br>
the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or<br>
generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately<br>
following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of<br>
the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a<br>
substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation<br>
of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such<br>
procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution<br>
reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the<br>
introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as<br>
aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group<br>
using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts<br>
conditions; and the introduction of a halogeno group,<br>
When a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a quinazoline derivative of the formula I is<br>
required, for example an acid-addition salt, it may be obtained by, for example, reaction of<br>
said quinazoline derivative with a suitable acid using a conventional procedure.<br>
As mentioned hereinbefore some of the compounds according to the present invention<br>
may contain one or more chiral centers and may therefore exist as stereoisomers (for example<br>
when R4 is alkyl and R4* is hydrogen). Stereoisomers may be separated using conventional<br>
techniques, e.g. chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The enantiomers may be isolated<br>
by separation of a racemate for example by fractional crystallisation, resolution or HPLC. The<br>
diastereoisomers may be isolated by separation by virtue of the different physical properties<br>
of the diastereoisomers, for example, by fractional crystallisation, HPLC or flash<br>
chromatography. Alternatively particular stereoisomers may be made by chiral synthesis from<br>
chiral starting materials under conditions which will not cause racetnisation or epimerisation,<br>
or by derivatisation, with a chiral reagent When a specific stereoisomer is isolated it is<br>
suitably isolated substantially free of other stereoisomers, for example containing less than<br>
20%, particularly less than 10% and more particularly less than 5% by weight of other<br>
stereoisomers.<br>
In the section above relating to the preparation of the quinazoline derivative of<br>
formula I, the expression "inert solvent" refers to a solvent which does not react with the<br>
starting materials, reagents, intennediates or products in a manner which adversely affects the<br>
yield of the desired product.<br>
Persons skilled hi the art will appreciate that, in order to obtain compounds of the<br>
invention in an alternative and hi some occasions, more convenient manner, the individual<br>
process steps mentioned hereinbefore may be performed in a different order, and/or the<br>
individual reactions may be performed at a different stage in the overall route (i.e. chemical<br>
transformations may be performed upon different intennediates to those associated<br>
hereinbefore with a particular reaction).<br>
Certain intennediates used in the processes described above are novel and form a<br>
further feature of the present invention. Accordingly there is provided a compound of the<br>
Formula IV as hereinbefore defined, or a salt thereof. The intermediate may be in the form of<br>
a salt of the intermediate. Such salts need not be a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. For<br>
example it may be useful to prepare an intermediate in the form of a pharmaceutically nonacceptable<br>
salt if, for example, such salts are useful in the manufacture of a compound of<br>
Biological Assays<br>
The inhibitory activities of compounds were assessed in non-cell based protein<br>
tyrosine kinase assays as well as in cell based proliferation assays before their in vivo activity<br>
was assessed in Xenograft studies.<br>
a) Protein Tyrosine Kinase phosphorylation Assays<br>
This test measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit the phosphorylation of a<br>
tyrosine containing polypeptide substrate by an erb receptor tyrosine kinase enzyme.<br>
Recombinant intracellular fragments of EGFR, erbB2 and erbB4 (accession numbers<br>
X00588, X03363 and L07868 respectively) were cloned and expressed in the<br>
baculovirus/SGl system. Lysates were prepared from these cells by treatment with ice-cold<br>
lysis buffer (20mM N^-hydroxyethylpipcrizine-N"-cdianesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH7.5,<br>
ISQmM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, LSrnM MgCl2, ImM ethylene<br>
glycol-bis(j}-aminoethyl ether) N"T.N""-letraacetic acid (EOTA), plus protease inhibitors<br>
and then cleared by centrifugation.<br>
Constitutive kinase activity of these recombinant proteins was determined by their<br>
ability to phosphorylate a synthetic peptide (made up of a random co-polymer of Ghitamic<br>
Acid, Alanine and Tyrosine in the ratio of 6:3:1). Specifically, Maxisorb™ 96-well<br>
immunoplates were coated with synthetic peptide (0.2|ig of peptide in a 200|d phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS) solution and incubated at 4°C overnight). Plates were washed in SOmM<br>
HEPES pH 7.4 at room temperature to remove any excess unbound synthetic peptide. EGFR<br>
or erbB2 activities were assessed by incubation in peptide coated plates for 20 minutes at<br>
room temperature in lOOmM HEPES pH 7.4 at room temperature, adenosine trisphosphate<br>
(ATP) at Km concentration for the respective enzyme, 10mM MnCl2O.lmM Na3VO4,<br>
0.2mMDL-dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% Triton X-100 with test compound in DMSO (final<br>
concentration of 2.5%). Reactions were terminated by the removal of the liquid components<br>
of the assay followed by washing of the plates with PBS-T (phosphate buffered saline with<br>
0.5% Tween 20).<br>
The immobilised phospho-peptide product of the reaction was detected by<br>
immunological methods. Firstly, plates were incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature<br>
with anti-phosphotyrosine primary antibodies that were raised in the mouse (4O10 from<br>
Upstate Biotechnology). Following extensive washing, plates were treated with Horseradish<br>
Peroxidase (HRP) conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (NXA931 from<br>
Amersham) for 60 minutes at room temperature. After further washing, HRP activity in each<br>
well of the plate was measured colorimetrically using 22"-Azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline<br>
sulfonate (6)] diammonium salt crystals (ABTS™ from Roche) as a substrate.<br>
Quantification of colour development and thus enzyme activity was achieved by the<br>
measurement of absorbance at 405nm on a Molecular Devices ThennoMax microplate reader.<br>
Kinase inhibition for a given compound was expressed as an IC50 value. This was determined<br>
by calculation of the concentration of compound mat was required to give 50% inhibition of<br>
phosphorylation in this assay. The range of phosphorylation was calculated from the positive<br>
(vehicle plus ATP) and negative (vehicle minus ATP) control values.<br>
b) EGFR driven KB cell proliferation assay<br>
This assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit the proliferation of KB<br>
cells (human naso-pharangeal carcinoma obtained from the American Type Culture<br>
Collection (ATCQ).<br>
KB cells were cultured in Dulbecco"s modified Eagle"s medium (DMEM) containing<br>
10% foetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine and non-essential amino acids at 37°C in a 7.5% CO?<br>
air incubator. Cells were harvested from the stock flasks using<br>
Trypsin/emylarmnediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Cell density was measured using a<br>
haemocytometer and viability was calculated using trypan blue solution before being seeded<br>
at a density of 1.25xl03 cells per well of a 96 well plate in DMEM containing 2.5% charcoal<br>
stripped serum, ImM glutamine and non-essential amino acids at 37°C in 15% CCh and<br>
allowed to settle for 4 hours.<br>
Following adhesion to the plate, the cells are treated with or without EGF (final<br>
concentration of Ing/ml) and with or without compound at a range of concentrations in<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (0.1% final) before incubation for 4 days. Following the<br>
incubation period, cell numbers were determined by addition of SOjil of 3-(4,5-<br>
Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (stock Smg/ml) for 2 hours.<br>
MTT solution was then tipped off, the plate gently tapped dry and the cells dissolved upon the<br>
^dition of lOOuJ of DMSQ,<br>
Absorbance of the solubilised cells was read at 540nm using a Molecular Devices<br>
ThermoMax microplate reader. Inhibition of proliferation was expressed as an ICso value.<br>
This was determined by calculation of the concentration of compound that was required to<br>
give 50% inhibition of proliferation. The range of proliferation was calculated from the<br>
positive (vehicle plus EOF) and negative (vehicle minus EOF) control values,<br>
c) Cellular EGFR phosphorylation assay<br>
This assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit the phosphorylation of<br>
EGFR in KB cells (human naso-pharangeal carcinoma obtained from the American Type<br>
Culture Collection (ATCC).<br>
KB cells were cultured in Dulbecco"s modified Eagle"s medium (DMEM) containing<br>
10% foetal calf serum, 2 rnM glutamine and non-essential amino acids at 37°C in a 7.5% CO<br>
air incubator. Cells were harvested from the stock flasks using<br>
Trypsin/ethylaminediaminetetraacetic acid (EOTA). Cell density was measured using a<br>
haemocytometer and viability was calculated using trypan blue solution before being seeded<br>
at a density of 2X105 cells per well of a 6 well plate in DMEM containing 2,5% charcoal<br>
stripped serum, 2mM glutamine and non-essential ammo acids at 37°C in 7.5% CO and<br>
allowed to settle for 72 hours.<br>
Following the 72 hour incubation period, the stripped serum containing media was<br>
then replaced with serum-free media (DMEM containing 2mM glutamine and non-essential<br>
amino acids) and incubated at 37°C in 7.5% CQ for 72 hours. Following this incubation<br>
period, the cells were treated with or without compound at a range of concentrations in<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (0.1% final) in serum free DMEM. Following incubation forl.5<br>
hours at 37°C in 7.5% CO the cells were treated with EOF (final concentration of lu,g/ml)<br>
and incubated at 37°C in 7.5% CO for 3 minutes. The media was then removed and the cells<br>
washed twice hi ice cold Phosphate Buffered Saline before lysis of the cells with 1ml of ice<br>
cold lysis buffer containing 120mM NaCl2,25mM HEPES, pH 7.6,5mM BGlycerophosphate,<br>

100, lOOmM NaF, ImM DTT, IraMPMSF, 10g/ml Leupeptin and lOu.g/ml Benzamidine.<br>
The lysates were centrifuged in a microfuge at 13000 rpm for 15 minutes and the supematants<br>
taken before analysis by sandwich Elisa,<br>
Nunc Maxisorb F96 Immunoplates were coated with EGFR capture antibody (sc-120,<br>
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) by incubation at a concentration of 0.16jig/ml in lOOul of<br>
50mM carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The plates were incubated at 4°C overnight with<br>
a gentle shaking action. Following overnight incubation, the plates were washed extensively<br>
with PBS containing 0.05% Tween before blocking with Superblock (Pierce). 100,1 of lysate<br>
was then added to each well and incubated overnight at 4°C before extensive washing with<br>
PBS containing 0.05% Tween.<br>
The immobilised EGFR was then probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine HRP<br>
conjugated antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at a dilution of 1 in 800 in PBS<br>
containing 0.05% Tween plus 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumen. After further washing, HRP<br>
activity hi each well of the plate was measured colorimetrically using Tetra Methyl Benzidine<br>
(TMB) from Bushranger (Roche Applied Sciences) in phosphate-citrate-perborate buffer<br>
containing 10% DMSO as a substrate. This reaction was stopped by the addition of lOOul of<br>
1M HzSQ after 12 minutes and quantified by measurement of the absorbance at 450nm using<br>
a Molecular Devices ThermoMax microplate reader.<br>
Inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation for a given compound was expressed as an ICso<br>
value. This was determined by calculation of the concentration of compound that was<br>
required to give 50% inhibition of phosphorylation hi this assay. The range of<br>
phosphorylation was calculated from the positive (vehicle plus EOF) and negative (vehicle<br>
minus EOF) control values.<br>

inhibit the phosphorylation of erbB2 in a MCF7 (breast carcinoma) derived cell tine which<br>
was generated by transfecting MCF7 cells with the full length erbB2 gene using standard<br>
methods to give a cell line that overexpresses full length wild type erbB2 protein (hereinafter<br>
"Clone 24* cells).<br>
Clone 24 cells were cultured in Growth Medium (phenol red free Dulbecco"s<br>
modified Eagle"s medium (DMEM) containing 10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine<br>
and 1.2mg/ml G418) in a 7.5% CQz air incubator at 37°C. Cells were harvested from T75<br>
stock flasks by washing once in PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH7.4, Gibco No. 10010-<br>
015) and harvested using 2mls of Trypsin (1.25mg/mlethylaminediaminetetraacetic acid<br>
(EDTA) (0.8mg/ml) solution. The cells were resuspended in Growth Medium. Cell density<br>
was measured using a haemocytometer and viability was calculated using Trypan Blue<br>
solution before being further diluted in Growth Medium and seeded at a density of IxlO4 cells<br>
perwell(in lOOul) into clear bottomed 96 well platek (Packard, No. 6005182). <br>
3 days later, Growth Medium was removed from the wells and replaced with lOOul<br>
Assay Medium (phenol red free DMEM, 2mM glutamine, 1.2mg/ml G418) either with or<br>
without erbB inhibitor compound. Plates were returned to the incubator for 4hours and then<br>
20ul of 20% formaldehyde solution in PBS was added to each well and the plate was left at<br>
room temperature for 30 minutes. This fixative solution was removed with a multichannel<br>
pipette, lOOjil of PBS was added to each well and then removed with a multichannel pipette<br>
and then 50ul PBS was added to each well Plates were then sealed and stored for up to 2<br>
weeks at 4°C.<br>
Immunostaining was performed at room temperature. Wells were washed once with<br>
200^1 PBS / Tween 20 (made by adding 1 sachet of PBS / Tween dry powder (Sigma, No.<br>
P3563) to 1L of double distilled HjO) using a plate washer then 200ul Blocking Solution (5%<br>
Marvel dried skimmed milk (Nestle) in PBS Tween 20) was added and incubated for 10<br>
minutes. Blocking Solution was removed using a plate washer and 200^1 of 0.5% Triton X-<br>
100 / PBS was added to permeabalise the cells. After 10 minutes, the plate was washed with<br>
200|il PBS / Tween 20 and men 200|il Blocking Solution was added once again and incubated<br>
for 15 minutes. Following removal of the Blocking Solution with a plate washer, 30ul of<br>
rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho ErbB2 IgO antibody (epitope phospho-Tyr 1248, SantaCruz,<br>
No. SC-12352-R), diluted 1:250 in Blocking Solution, was added to each well and incubated<br>
for 2 hours. Then mis primary antibody solution was removed from the wells using a plate<br>
washer followed by two 200ul PBS / Tween 20 washes using a plate washer. Then 30ul of<br>
Alexa-Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgO secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, No. A-11008),<br>
diluted 1:750 in Blocking Solution, was added to each well. From now onwards, wherever<br>
possible, plates were protected from light exposure, at this stage by sealing with black<br>
backing tape. The plates were incubated for 45 minutes and then the secondary antibody<br>
solution was removed from the wells followed by two 200ul PBS / Tween 20 washes using a<br>
plate washer. Then PBS was added to each plate, incubated for 10 minutes and then<br>
removed using a plate washer. Then a further lOOul PBS was added to each plate and then,<br>
without prolonged incubation, removed using a plate washer. Then SOuJ of PBS was added to<br>
each well and plates were resealed with black backing tape and stored for up to 2 days at 4°C<br>
before analysis.<br>
The Fluorescence^ signal is each well was measured using an Acumen Explorer, ,<br>
Instrument (Acumen Bioscience Ltd.), a plate reader that can be used to rapidly quantitate<br>
features of images generated by laser-scanning. The instrument was set to measure the<br>
number of fluorescent objects above a pre-set threshold value and this provided a measure of<br>
the phosphorylation status of erbB2 protein. Fluorescence dose response data obtained with<br>
each compound was exported into a suitable software package (such as Origin) to perform<br>
curve fitting analysis. Inhibition of erbB2 phosphorylation was expressed as an ICso value.<br>
This was determined by calculation of the concentration of compound that was required to<br>
give 50% inhibition of erbB2 phosphorylation signal.<br>
e) In vivo BT-474 Xeno graft assay<br>
This assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth of a BT-474<br>
tumour cell xenograft (human mammary carcinoma obtained from Dr Baselga, Laboratorio<br>
Recerca Oncologica, Paseo Vail DHebron 119-129, Barcelona 08035, Spain) in Female<br>
Swiss athymic mice (Alderley Park, nu/nu genotype) (Baselga, J. et al (1998) Cancer<br>
Research, 58,2825-2831).<br>
Female Swiss athymic (nu/nu genotype) mice were bred and maintained in Alderley<br>
Park in negative pressure Isolators (PFI Systems Ltd.). Mice were housed in a barrier facility<br>
with 12hr light/dark cycles and provided with sterilised food and water ad libitum. All<br>
procedures were performed on mice of at least 8 weeks of age. BT-474 tumour cell<br>
xenografts were established in the hind flank of donor mice by sub-cutaneous injections of<br>
IxlO7 freshly cultured cells in lOOul of serum free media with 50% Matrigel per animal. On<br>
day 14 post-implant, mice were randomised into groups of 10 prior to the treatment with<br>
compound or vehicle control that was administered once daily at O.lml/lOg body weight<br>
Tumour volume was assessed twice weekly by bilateral Vernier calliper measurement, using<br>
the formula (length x width) x V(Iength x width) x (fl/6), where length was the longest<br>
diameter across the tumour, and width was the corresponding perpendicular. Growth<br>
inhibition from start of treatment was calculated by comparison of the mean changes in<br>
tumour volume for the control and treated groups, and statistical significance between the two<br>
groups was evaluated using a Students t test.<br>
f) hERG-encoded Potassium Channel Inhibition Assay<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the tail current flowing<br>
through the human ether-a-go-go-related-gene (Herg)encoded potassium channel.<br>
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing the hERG-encoded channel were<br>
grown in Mimhium Essential Medium Eagle (EMEM; Sigma-Aldrich catalogue number<br>
M2279), supplemented with 10% Foetal Calf Serum (Labtech International; product number<br>
4-101-500), 10% Ml serum-free supplement (Egg Technologies; product number 70916) and<br>
0.4 mg/ml Geneticin 0418 (Sigma-Aldrich; catalogue number G7034). One or two days<br>
before each experiment, the cells were detached from the tissue culture flasks with Accutase<br>
(TCS Biologicals) using standard tissue culture methods. They were then put onto glass<br>
coverslips resting hi wells of a 12 well plate and covered with 2 ml of the growing media.<br>
For each cell recorded, a glass coverslip containing the cells was placed at the bottom<br>
of a Perspex chamber containing bath solution (see below) at room temperature (~20 °C).<br>
This chamber was fixed to the stage of an inverted, phase-contrast microscope. Immediately<br>
after placing the coverslip in the chamber, bath solution was perfused into the chamber from a<br>
gravity-fed reservoir for 2 minutes at a rate of ~ 2 ml/min. After this time, perfusion was<br>
) stopped.<br>
A patch pipette made from borosilicate glass tubing (GC120F, Harvard Apparatus)<br>
using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co.) was filled with pipette solution (see<br>
hereinafter). The pipette was connected to the headstage of the patch clamp amplifier<br>
(Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments) via a silver/silver chloride wire. The headstage ground<br>
was connected to the earth electrode. This consisted of a silver/silver chloride wire embedded<br>
in 3% agar made up with 0.85% sodium chloride.<br>
The cell was recorded in the whole cell configuration of Hie patch clamp technique.<br>
Following "break-in", which was done at a holding potential of -80 mV (set by the amplifier),<br>
and appropriate adjustment of series resistance and capacitance controls, electtophysiology<br>
software (CUunpex, Axon Instruments) was used to set a holding potential (-80 mV) and to<br>
deliver a voltage protocol. This protocol was applied every 15 seconds and consisted of a 1 s<br>
step to 440 mV followed by a 1 s step to -50 mV. The current response to each imposed<br>
voltage protocol was low pass filtered by the amplifier at 1 kHz. The filtered signal was men<br>
acquired, on line, by digitising this analogue signal from the amplifier with an analogue to<br>
digital converter. The digitised signal was then captured on a computer running Clampex<br>
software (Axon Instruments). During the holding potential and the step to + 40 mV the<br>
current was sampled at 1 kHz. The sampling rate was men set to 5 kHz for the remainder of<br>
the voltage protocol.<br>
The compositions, pH and osmolarity of the bath and pipette solution are tabulated<br>

stopped.<br>
A patch pipette made from borosilicate glass tubing (GC120F, Harvard Apparatus)<br>

Following "break-in, which was done at a holding potential of -80 mV (set by the amplifier),<br>
and appropriate adjustment of series resistance and capacitance controls, electrophysiology<br>
software (Clampex, Axon Instruments) was used to set a holding potential (-80 mV) and to<br>
deliver a voltage protocol. This protocol was applied every IS seconds and consisted of a 1 s<br>

The amplitude of the hERG-encoded potassium channel tail current following the<br>
step from +40 mV to -50 mV was recorded oo-tine by Clampex software (Axon Instruments).<br>
Following stabilisation of the tail current amplitude, bath solution containing the vehicle for<br>
the test substance was applied to the cell. Providing the vehicle application had no significant<br>
effect on tail current amplitude, a cumulative concentration effect curve to the compound was<br>
then constructed.<br>
The effect of each concentration of test compound was quantified by expressing the<br>
tail current amplitude hi the presence of a given concentration of test compound as a<br>
percentage of that in the presence of vehicle.<br>
Test compound potency (ICso) was determined by fitting the percentage inhibition<br>
values making up the concentration-effect to a four parameter Hill equation using a standard<br>
data-fitting package. If the level of inhibition seen at the highest test concentration did not<br>
exceed 50%, no potency value was produced and a percentage inhibition value at mat<br>
concentration was quoted.<br>
Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the formula 1 vary with<br>
structural change as expected, in general activity possessed by compounds of the formula I,<br>
may be demonstrated at the following concentrations or doses in one or more of the above<br>
tests (a), (b), (c) and (d)<br>
Test (a):- ICso in the range, for example, 0.001 - 5<br>
Test (b):- ICso in the range, for example, 0.001 - 5 µM;<br>
Test (c):- ICso in the range, for example, 0.001 - 5 µM;<br>
Test (c):- ICso in the range, for example, 0.001 - S µM;<br>
Test (d):- activity in the range, for example, 1-200 mg/kg/day;<br>
No physiologically unacceptable toxicity was observed in Test (d) at the effective dose<br>
for compounds tested of the present invention. Accordingly no untoward toxicological effects<br>
are expected when a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as<br>
defined hereinbefore is administered at the dosage ranges defined hereinafter.<br>
By way of example, Table A illustrates the activity of representative compounds<br>
according to the invention. Column 2 of Table A shows ICso data from Test (a) for the<br>
inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase protein phosphorylation; column 3 shows ICso data from<br>
Test (a) for the inhibition of erbB2 tyrosine kinase protein phosphorylation; and column 4<br>
shows ICso data for inhibition of phosphorylation of erbB2 in a MCF7 derived cell line in Test<br>
(d) described above:<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention mere is provided a pharmaceutical<br>
composition which comprises a quinazoline derivative of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically<br>
(Table Removed) acceptable thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
diluent or carrier.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example<br>
as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible<br>
powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments,<br>
gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for<br>
example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for<br>
example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile<br>
aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intramuscular dosing<br>
or as a suppository for rectal dosing).<br>
The compositions of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using<br>
conventional pharmaceutical excipients, well known in the art Thus, compositions intended<br>
for oral use may contain, for example, one or more colouring, sweetening, flavouring and/or<br>
preservative agents.<br>
The amount of active ingredient mat is combined with one or more excipients to<br>
produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the host treated and the<br>
particular route of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral<br>
administration to humans will generally contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of active<br>
agent (more suitably from O.S to 100 mg, for example from 1 to 30 mg) compounded with an<br>
appropriate and convenient amount of excipients which may vary from about 5 to about 98<br>
percent by weight of the total composition.<br>
The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of a quinazoline<br>
derivative of the formula I will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the<br>
conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according<br>
to well known principles of medicine.<br>
In using a quinazoline derivative of the formula I for therapeutic or prophylactic<br>
purposes it will generally be administered so that a daily dose in the range, for example, 0.1<br>
mg/kg to 75 mg/kg body weight is received, given if required in divided doses. In general<br>
lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for<br>
intravenous administration, a dose in the range, for example, 0.1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg body<br>
weight will generally be used. Similariy, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range,<br>
for example, 0.05 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg body weight will be used. Oral administration is<br>
however preferred, particularly in tablet form. Typically, unit dosage forms will contain<br>
about 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of a compound of this invention.<br>
We have found that the compounds of the present invention possess anti-proliferative<br>
properties such as anti-cancer properties that are believed to arise from their erb-B,<br>
particularly EOFR and more particularly erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity.<br>
Furthermore, certain of the compounds according to vie present invention possess<br>
substantially better potency against the erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase, than against other<br>
tyrosine kinases enzymes, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase. Such compounds possess sufficient<br>
potency against the erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase mat they may be used in an amount<br>
sufficient to inhibit erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase whilst demonstrating little, or significantly<br>
lower, activity against other tyrosine kinases such as EGFR. Such compounds are likely to be<br>
useful for the selective inhibition of erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase and are likely to be useful<br>
for the effective treatment of, for example etbB2 driven tumours. Accordingly, the<br>
compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful m the treatment of diseases or<br>
medical conditions mediated alone or in part by and erb-B, particularly erbB2 receptor<br>
tyrosine kinases, i.e. the compounds may be used to produce a erb-B, particularly an erbB2,<br>
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory effect in a warm-blooded anirnalm need of such treatment<br>
Thus the compounds of the present invention provide a for the treatment of maHgnant<br>
cells characterised by inhibition of the erb-B, particularly erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>
Particularly die compounds of the invention may be used to produce an anti-proliferative<br>
and/or pro-apoptotic and/or anti-invasive effect mediated alone or in part by the inhibition of<br>
erb-B, particularly ertB2, receptor tyrosine kinases. Particularly, the compounds of the<br>
present invention are expected to be useful in the prevention or treatment of those tumours<br>
that are sensitive to inhibition of an erb-B, particularly the erbB2, receptor tyrosine kinase that<br>
are involved in the signal transduction steps which drive proliferation and survival of these<br>
tumour cells. Accordingly the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful<br>
in the treatment and/or prevention of a number of hyperprolif erative disorders by providing an<br>
anti-proliferative effect These disorders include, for example psoriasis, benign prostatic<br>
hyperplasia (BPH), atherosclerosis and restenosis and, in particular, erb-B, more particularly<br>
erb-B2, receptor tyrosine kinase driven tumours. Such benign or maHgnant tumours may<br>
affect any tissue and include non-solid tumours such as leukaemia, multiple myeloma or<br>
lyrnphpma, and also solid tumours, for example bile duct, bone, bladder, brain/CNS, breast,<br>
colorcctal, cervical, endometrial, gastric, head and neck, hepatic, lung, muscle, neuronal,<br>
oesophageal, ovarian, pancreatic, pleural/peritoneal membranes, prostate, renal, skin,<br>
testicular, thyroid, uterine and vulval tumours.<br>
