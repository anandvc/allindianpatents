				<td>A CONTINUOUS TYPE MULTIPURPOSE TEA SHOOT SORTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a continuous type multipurpose tea shoot sorter, for sorting<br>
leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits and nuts of aromatic, medicinal plants and tea plants.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Many agricultural produces like seeds, potatoes, onions and grains which are elliptical or<br>
oval shape are separated and graded with sorting machine which uses the property of the<br>
above material to roll on inclined surfaces.<br>
With uneven and flat surfaced produces like flowers, leaves, small branches of herbs, flat<br>
and thin roots, by virtue of their resistance to rolling tend to hug to inclined surfaces. Hence,<br>
it is difficult to sort out into uniform grades. This results in the final product either of mixed<br>
quality or of an average quality.<br>
Tea shoots are one such products that grow uneven due to the stochastic nature of rain fall,<br>
dynamic nature of weather conditions, dissimilar land productivity, organic matter content,<br>
shade management practices and crop varieties. The variation in tea leaf fineness will create<br>
lot of difficulties in almost every step of tea manufacture viz. improper withers, modification<br>
in maceration procedures to hide exposed fibre, withering and fermentation, uneven drying,<br>
affecting final characteristics of made tea. Moreover, extra efforts are needed for sorting and<br>
grading of made tea. To overcome these difficulties, a lot of energy and manpower is<br>
utilised resulting in the escalation of cost of production.<br>
In order to minimise cost of plucking, a high plucking task is assigned to the pluckers and<br>
mechanised tea leaf plucking method is also adopted for meeting domestic as well as export<br>
requirements, which reduces the quantity and quality of plucked tea leaves.<br>
The cup quality will decline due to decrease in plucking standards. The plucking of 3-4<br>
leaves and a bud plucked for fulfilling the high plucking tasks will increase the overall biomass<br>
i.e. leaves, stems, crude fibres and chlorophyll by 107, 116, 400 and 132 %<br>
respectively. This increased bio- mass will reduce the per cent of quality of buds, caffeine,<br>
soluble solids, polyphenol and total amino acids by 430, 150, 190, 200 and 133%<br>
respectively in comparison to two leaves and a bud. The consumer may not get the value for<br>
his money.<br>
Presently, tea industry is facing a lot of difficulties to bring about increments in tea<br>
production, in terms of quality and quantity for facilitating export. Many times the export<br>
consignments are rejected due to failing to meet the stringent international standards.<br>
Sorting of tealeaf is a tiresome, labour consuming and uneconomical operation that puts<br>
undue pressure on already troubled tea industry.<br>
Conventionally, the separation of any material may be done on the principles of sieving and<br>
density methods. In winnowing process, a mixture of chaff and grain falls in front of<br>
winnowing machine, which creates a stream of forced air and the chaffs and grains get<br>
separated on the basis of density.<br>
Development of threshing machine, where winnower and sieving drum were mounted on a<br>
threshing machine, where seeds are allowed to fall under gravity from the sieving drum and<br>
chaffs were blown out by the winnowing fan. (Roy, S. E. 1960. Development of harvesting<br>
and threshing equipment for India. The Agricultural Engineer, 5:47-59;)<br>
A cam type winnowing system with air blower combination and two-conveyor assembly<br>
with blower were evaluated for removing debris of Maine wild blueberries. (Donahue,<br>
D.W.; Bushway, A.A.; Moore, K.E., LaGasse, B.J. 1999. Evaluation of current winnowing<br>
system for Maine wild blueberries. Applied Engineering in Agriculture. 15:5423-427;<br>
10.ref.)<br>
The major drawbacks of these machines are that these are designed to separate different<br>
materials of different densities but it cannot separate materials of the same density having<br>
variable sizes. These materials have a low rolling friction, but it may not overcome the<br>
bridging problem which is obvious in the case of bio-masses (green, rolled and dried leaves)<br>
or like tea shoots, rose buds and flowers or like.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

parts sorting machine that can successfully sort, cut and coarsely pluck tea shoots from fine<br>
green tea shoots economically.<br>

The flow mechanism of the sorter machine is further explained in the form of following<br>
embodiments.<br>
A flywheel, is attached with a cam assembly from the main shaft to the sieving tray at free<br>
end gives an elliptical motion. The major axis will be the diameter of the flywheel and<br>
minor axis will be the difference of the eccentric attachment of the flywheel.<br>
A flywheel is attached at stand (7) vertically up at the tail end of sieving tray, which is free,<br>
gives upside and down side movement of sieving tray at tail end. This movement is<br>
transferred in terms of agitation to the sorting machine.<br>
As the prime mover is under motion, it gives motion to the main shaft from which a fly<br>
wheel is attached with a cam assembly and the tail end of sorting machine to give movement<br>
in the whole body of the sieving tray, which is attached by a thin MS flat (15). It passes the<br>
movement in collecting tray (9) from where it passes to collecting tray (10) by the bracket<br>
assembly (13). This motion is sufficient to slide the feed material to the conveyor belt. The<br>
sieving tray is not sitting on a fixed platform.<br>
The Sieving tray is hinged by two MS flat pieces (15), which are flexible in nature at head<br>
end and free at tail end. So the total movement by prime mover in tail is transferred to lower<br>
portion of the body of the sorting machine. The collecting tray (9) is attached to the same<br>
MS flat (15) transfer motion at head end of collecting tray. The head end of collecting tray is<br>
attached to a bracket assembly to the head end of the collecting tray (10). So the total<br>
agitating motion is synchronized and the free fall feed material started sliding towards<br>
gravity to the conveyor belts (4,5 and 11).<br>
The blind mesh is a thin piece of MS sheet is provided to clearly separate two different<br>
quality materials. This blind mesh also regulates to fall free falling material at the collecting<br>
tray.<br>

The prime mover is giving motion to a multi pulley shaft from where a pulley is attached<br>
to the continuous type-feeding hopper, which is moving in the same direction. The other<br>
one is attached to the free end of the sieving tray through a cam assembly to give an<br>
eccentric movement to the sieving tray. The third pulley is attached to a differential<br>
assembly to change the direction of motion. The out put motion of differential assembly is<br>
attached to the conveyor belt, which is used for collection of sorted materials.<br>
Height adjustments: Height adjustments are made to the green tea shoot sorter for the fast<br>
movement of the feed material<br>
Mesh size: Mesh size is chosen on the basis of desired fine material need<br>
in the different lots.<br>
Speed variation: Different speeds are chosen to avoid bridging on the fed material.<br>
Speed variation: Different speeds are chosen to avoid bridging on the fed material.<br>
Horizontal and vertical movement: This movement is given to the sieving tray is to avoid<br>
bridging.<br>
A pulley is mounted the prime mover (motor), which transfer power to the main shaft,<br>
which has a multiple pulley. Power from the shaft is directly taken to the conveyor belt for<br>
self-feeding device as the motion is in same direction. In second pulley the power is<br>
brought to down ward and attached to a differential unit. This differential unit will change<br>
the direction of motion and is attached to second main shaft, which has also got multiple<br>
pulleys. These pulleys are attached with the wedge type conveyor belt assembly. The third<br>
flywheel with cam assembly is attached at the tail end of sieving mesh to give horizontal<br>
and vertical motion to the sieving tray.<br>

Fig 2 depicts continuous type hopper and charging lever<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of said machine and should not be<br>
considered as limiting factor.<br>
Example 1<br>
To see the constituent of sorted material of tea, 30 kg of fresh green tea leaf plucked by the<br>
machine was charged in to the hopper and conveyor assembly and allowed to pass over the<br>
Leaf sorting system. The results are tabulated in the Table 1. Table I clearly shows that the<br>
major lot has almost same character<br>
Mesh -1 - 65 per cent cut leaves and bud<br>
Mesh -2 - 70 per cent two leaves and a bud and banjhi<br>
Mesh -3 - 75 percent three or more leaves and a bud and above.<br>
Control (unsorted) - 58 per cent three or more leaves and a bud and above.<br>
The fine leaf character in unsorted leaves has got a mixed character a fine percentage of<br>
48-52 per cent of two leaves and a bud. A uniform treatment makes the 30 per cent green<br>
tea leaf over wither and deteriorate the quality. The uniform character of sorted leaves has<br>
a privilege to put under uniform treatment to get'a uniform and better quality.<br>
Generally, a machine plucked green tea leaves contains 48-52 per cent of fine (two leaves<br>
and a bud) materials whereas it is evident from the invention that (data as tabulated above)<br>
the machine plucked leaves when separated by the sorting unit contains 70-80 per cent fine<br>
and uniformly graded materials. This uniformity depends on the standardisation of mesh<br>
sizes. This uniformity in sorted materials will facilitate a product diversification viz. instant<br>
tea, dip tea or like product can easily be achieved through low graded green tea shoots and<br>
high graded shoots can be processed for conventional tea to meet international standard<br>
and domestic requirement.<br>
The present invention was effectively employed for improving'the quality of raw material<br>
of Damask rose for essential oil extraction. The cup shaped Damask rose flowers contain<br>
maximum oil. The loose petals, calyx, and mature rose flowers can be used for product<br>
diversification i.e. rose water, gulkand, dry rose petals like products. It is emphasized that<br>
the mechanisation in essential oil industry shall go a long way in sorting out the labour<br>
problem and bringing down the cost of production. The results are tabulated in Table 2.<br>
From the table 2 also a uniform treatment is given to extract maximum oil from the<br>
Damask rose flowers. The loose petals, calyx and mature flowers can be better used under<br>
product diversification.<br>

and medicinal plants.<br>
2. This machine has been designed to meet the needs of small, marginal and large<br>
processing units.<br>
3. The unit is useful for sorting fruits of variable shapes and sizes.<br>
