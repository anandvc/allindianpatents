APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR INTERFERING WITH PATHOLOGICAL<br>
CELLS SURVIVAL PROCESSES<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to an<br>
apparatus for interfering with pathological cells<br>
survival processes.<br>
In addition, the invention relates to a<br>
microbiological method carried out by such apparatus for<br>
interfering with pathological cells survival, in<br>
particular cells affected by cancer and other diseases<br>
caused by alterations in the mechanism of cell survival.<br>
In particular, the interference is induced by means<br>
of static (S) and extremely low frequency electromagnetic<br>
(ELF) fields produced by the apparatus.<br>
Magnetic Static fields and Extremely Low Frequency<br>
electromagnetic fields are hereinafter referred to also as<br>
S and ELF, respectively. Moreover, any possible combination<br>
of different sequences of S and/or ELF fields, such as S<br>
fields followed by ELF fields, ELF fields followed by S<br>
fields, S and ELF field together, as well as the presence<br>
of S or ELF fields alone, will hereinafter be referred to<br>
also as SELF fields.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
It is known that pericellular fields and currents<br>
induced by an Extremely Low Frequency (ELF)<br>
electromagnetic field, whose frequency range is from 1 Hz<br>
to 300 Hz and perhaps up to 1000 Hz, induce within the<br>
cell certain membrane electrochemical events which are<br>
important for primary biologic signal transduction and<br>
amplification processes.<br>
These biochemically mediated events then produce<br>
cytoplasmic second messengers and internal effectors such<br>
CONFIRMATION COPY<br>
as free Ca++ and protein phosphorylases (kinases) which in<br>
turn trigger certain changes in the biosynthesis of<br>
macromolecules as well as bring about alterations in<br>
cellular growth differentiation and functional properties<br>
[1M. Blank, 1993].<br>
Further, the possibility that S and ELF fields<br>
affect the DNA synthesis, DNA integrity, transcription<br>
and translation has been documented [2Liboff 1984, 3Tofani<br>
1995, 4Goodman 1991, sPhillips 1992] .<br>
A possible physical mechanism to account for some<br>
of the experimental findings is the direct effect on ions<br>
(i.e. Ca++) or on ligand binding at the cell membrane<br>
[6Liboff 1985, 7Chiabrera 1985, BLednev 1991, 9Blanchard<br>
1994] .<br>
The possibility of influencing variations of Ca++<br>
metabolism may lead to cell apoptosis (programmed cell<br>
death) [10Preston, 13Trump 1997] .<br>
Another physical interaction mechanism is related<br>
to the possibility of influencing the kinetics of<br>
appropriate cell signalling pathways of the cell<br>
(including calcium metabolism) through a field direct<br>
effect on electron-spin motion of atoms and molecules<br>
with unpaired electrons. This influencing may affect the<br>
recombination ratio of a spin correlated free radical<br>
pair and consequently on redox signalling [12Grundler<br>
1992; 13Polk 1992; 14Walleczek and Budingher 1992; 15Adey<br>
1993] .<br>
In particular, the spin singlet-triplet energetic<br>
level transition in a free radical is critical for<br>
increasing the recombination ratio of spin correlated<br>
free radical pairs.<br>
The possibility for low level, non thermal (with<br>
intensity up to 3 0 mT) S and ELF magnetic fields to<br>
influence in vitro the kinetics and efficacy of radical<br>
pair reactions is known from magnetochemistry [16steiner<br>
1989].<br>
Naturally occurring free radicals have an oxygen-<br>
or nitrogen-based unpaired electron such as superoxide<br>
anion, hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide. These Reactive<br>
Oxygen Species (ROS) and Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS)<br>
can target proteins providing an obvious mechanistic<br>
explanation for free radicals-mediated signalling events.<br>
These events may influence growth factors, ion transport<br>
(i.e. Ca++ channels), transcription, apoptosis [17Lander<br>
1997].<br>
Apoptosis is a morphologically distinct form of<br>
programmed cell death that is connected in cell survival<br>
processes playing an important role during development,<br>
homeostasis, and in many diseases including cancer,<br>
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and neurodegenerative<br>
disorders, as well as in other diseases that similarly to<br>
those are characterised by altered cell survival<br>
processes. Apoptosis occurs through the activation of a<br>
cell-intrinsic suicide program. The basic genetic<br>
mechanism of apoptosis appears to be present in<br>
essentially all mammalian cells at all times, but the<br>
activation of this suicide program is regulated by many<br>
different signals that originate from both the<br>
intracellular and the extracellular environment.<br>
Among all the genes involved in apoptosis<br>
regulation, the p53 gene is receiving much attention.<br>
This gene, which encodes a transcription factor and is<br>
common in many human cancers, mediates the cellular<br>
responses to some environmental damage. The p53 protein<br>
either can temporarily stop cell division, so that the<br>
cell can repair altered DNA, or can pilot the cell to an<br>
apoptotic death.<br>
Published data support that p53 appears in<br>
apdptosis through a three step process: 1)<br>
transcriptional induction of redox-related genes: 2) the<br>
formation of reactive oxygen species and 3) the oxidative<br>
degradation of mitochondria components, culminating in<br>
cell death [18Polyak 1997] .<br>
In addition anti-oxidative agents are combined with<br>
drugs in the treatment of hypoxia tumour cells 19 [Walch,<br>
1988] and in the influence of vascular growth factor<br>
20 [Amirkhosravi, 1998].<br>
Moreover, published data are supporting the idea<br>
that pathological cells answer differently than normal<br>
cells to ELF fields stimuli. According to 21Cadossi [1992],<br>
lymphocytes from normal patients respond differently than<br>
lymphocytes from Down's syndrome, AIDS and chronic<br>
lymphocytic leukaemia patients when exposed to ELF fields<br>
(previously with mitogen).<br>
It is also recognised that Ca++ influx across the<br>
membrane is influenced by ELF fields in leukaemic<br>
lymphocytes but not in normal lymphocytes [22Walleczek,<br>
1996].<br>
Altered cell survival processes come with electric<br>
disorders and different electrical behavior. In fact,<br>
rapidly proliferating and transformed cells have<br>
electrically depolarized cell membranes if compared with<br>
normal cells [23Binggeli, 1986 ;24 Marino 1994] . It has also<br>
been shown that epithelial cells lose their<br>
transepithelial potential during carcinogenesis [25Davies<br>
1987; 26 Goller 1986; 27 Capko, 1996]. This different<br>
electrical behavior of tumor cells compared with normal<br>
cells is the basis for a newly proposed cancer diagnostic<br>
modality [28Cuzick 1998] . In addition, the concentration of<br>
free radicals in transformed cells and tissues is higher<br>
than in non-transformed ones [29Szatrowski 1991; 30<br>
Shulyakovskaya 1993; 31 Iwagaki 1995].<br>
With reference to chemotherapy all efforts are<br>
devoted to the target of inducing cell apoptosis in vivo<br>
instead of killing them, through Signal Transduction<br>
Directed Therapy (STDT) of cancer [32Levin, 1998].<br>
Signal Transduction is a functional term that connotes<br>
the translation of genetic information into signalling<br>
cascades that allow the cell to for example interpret and<br>
respond to external stimuli and/or duplicate itself. Recent<br>
evidence suggests that alterations in the cell survival<br>
processes contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of<br>
human diseases, including cancer, viral infections,<br>
autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and AIDS.<br>
Treatments designed to specifically alter the apoptotic<br>
threshold connected with the survival processes mechanisms<br>
may have the potentiality to change the natural progression<br>
of some of these diseases ["Thompson, 1995].<br>
High intensity electrical, electromagnetic and<br>
magnetic fields have been used to destroy pathological<br>
cells.<br>
In 34US4665898 an apparatus is described in which<br>
animals having malignant cells are treated by means of a<br>
high intensity pulsed magnetic field, in order to<br>
neutralise/destroy malignant cells in a selective way.<br>
This apparatus produces magnetic thermal fields having<br>
intensity comprised between 1 Tesla up to 10 Tesla and<br>
reversing polarity in the range 5+lOOO Kilohertz. In the<br>
preferred embodiment the magnetic field intensity is set<br>
between 1 and 50 Tesla and in particular, in the examples,<br>
it is set at 5 Tesla and 8 Kilohertz up to 18 Tesla and<br>
250 Kilohertz.<br>
Different ELF, thermal, continuous or pulsed fields,<br>
have been used for anti-cancer therapy in vitro [35Narita,<br>
1997; 36Raylman, 1996] .<br>
In these cases the fields are of very high intensity.<br>
much higher than what people are allowed to be exposed by<br>
the safety standards, and may produce heating thus<br>
damaging normal tissues and cells.<br>
ELF low intensity electromagnetic fields have been<br>
used as well to inhibit mitosis of malignant cells, such<br>
as in DE 4122380A1 and US 5156587. However, these<br>
documents describe the use of sinusoidal fields only at a<br>
fixed net frequency and at a fixed intensity, with the<br>
possibility to sweep only a limited range of energy levels<br>
inside the cellular tissue.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a method for interfering with cell survival processes<br>
(i.e. inducing apoptosis) of living pathological cells<br>
(i.e. cancer cells) by using magnetic fields without<br>
adversely affecting normal cells.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide an<br>
apparatus for interfering with pathological cells<br>
survival processes.<br>
The former and other objects are reached by the<br>
method for interfering with pathological cells survival<br>
according to the invention whose characteristic is to<br>
apply to living pathological cells (i.e. cancer cells and<br>
cells affected by other diseases caused by alterations in<br>
the mechanism of cell survival) non thermal SELF magnetic<br>
fields to induce apoptosis in a selective way.<br>
For the purposes of the invention SELF fields are<br>
to be considered as different sequences of S and/or ELF<br>
fields, i.e. S fields followed by ELF fields, ELF fields<br>
followed by S fields, S and ELF field together, as well<br>
as the presence of S or ELF fields alone.<br>
The concept underlying the method according to the<br>
invention is that SELF fields interfere with cell<br>
signalling sustaining cell pathological behaviour inside<br>
pathological cells, i.e. on redox signalling through free<br>
radicals, thus restoring the cell survival processes,<br>
i.e. inducing directly or indirectly apoptosis through a<br>
modification of p53 gene expression.<br>
This method is supposed to recombine oxygen-based<br>
free radicals and may also be used as an anti-oxidative<br>
agent. It's combination with drugs in the treatment of<br>
hypoxia tumour cells and in the influence of vascular<br>
growth factor may also be considered.<br>
The reason why SELF fields selectively induce<br>
apoptosis in pathological cells (i.e. cancer cells) may be<br>
related to the altered electrical behaviour of<br>
pathological cells compared with that of normal cells.<br>
For these reasons SELF fields can induce directly or<br>
indirectly a signal programmed cell death (apoptosis), in<br>
vitro and in vivo, without causing any adverse effect.<br>
In the hypothesis that free radicals recombination<br>
is at the basis of the expected biological effects on<br>
pathological cells (i.e., anti-tumour activity) the<br>
transition between singlet-triplet of unpaired electron in<br>
oxygen based free radicals has to be considered. In fact<br>
this transition, which depends on the applied magnetic<br>
field, is critical for increasing the recombination ratio<br>
of a spin correlated free radical pair. However, the<br>
reaction centres related to the expected anti tumor<br>
effect are unknown and therefore the lifetime of the spin<br>
states and the energy splitting between singlet and<br>
triplet states cannot be precisely determined from the<br>
spin hamiltonian [37Haberkorn 1979, 38 Lersch 1983] .<br>
To encompass this problem, according to the<br>
invention, sequences of S magnetic fields with different<br>
intensity modulated in amplitude can be used, with the<br>
superimposition of ELF magnetic fields. The use of<br>
modulated fields is in agreement with the need for<br>
reaching optimal condition(s) for the singlet-triplet spin<br>
state conversion required for the free radical<br>
recombination processes [13Polk 1992] .<br>
For these reasons, S, ELF or SELF fields have higher<br>
probability to induce the expected biological effects if<br>
they are modulated following a predetermined function of<br>
intensity and or frequency versus time, since this way the<br>
probability to induce the above transition is higher.<br>
The different sequences of S and/or ELF fields<br>
sequences are advantageously set for time intervals T1, T2,<br>
.... Tn, wherein the intensity Is, Ielf and their ratio Is/Ielf<br>
are set at steady values Is1, Is2, ..., Isn; Ielfi, Ieup2, ..., Ielfti,<br>
Is1/Ielf1, Is2/Ielp2, ..., Isn/lBLFn, respectively.<br>
For the same reasons modulated SELF non thermal<br>
fields can be potentially used for treatment of cells<br>
affected by many diseases like viral infections, AIDS,<br>
autoimmune diseases, etc., where the alteration of cell<br>
survival contributes to their pathogenesis.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, an<br>
apparatus for selectively interfering with pathological<br>
cells survival processes in vitro and in vivo has the<br>
characteristic of comprising means for generating static<br>
magnetic (S) fields crossing a working environment and<br>
means for generating electromagnetic extremely low<br>
frequency (ELF) fields in the working environment alone or<br>
in addition to the S fields.<br>
Means are provided for modulating the S fields<br>
associated to the means for generating S fields and<br>
varying the intensity of the S fields between 1 and 100 mT<br>
and preferably from 1 to 30 mT.<br>
Means are also provided for modulating the ELF<br>
fields alone or associated to the S fields at a frequency<br>
between 1 and 1000 Hz with intensity comprised between 1<br>
and 3 0 mT. Preferably the ELF fields have a frequency<br>
between 10 and 10 0 Hz.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention the<br>
means for modulating the S fields comprises program means<br>
that alternatively or in combination:<br>
- set the intensity following a plurality of<br>
predetermined step values Is1, Is2,...,lsn for corresponding<br>
time intervals T1, T2, ..., Tn;<br>
- set the intensity amplitude following a plurality of<br>
predetermined step values Ielf1, Ielt2,...., IsLPn for<br>
corresponding time intervals T1, Tz, ..., Tn;<br>
- set the frequency following a plurality of<br>
predetermined step values f1, f2,..., fn, for corresponding<br>
time intervals T1, T2, ..., Tn;<br>
- set an S/ELF ratio according to a plurality of<br>
predetermined step values Is1/Iblf1, Is2/Ie1,f2,..., Isn/IELFN, for<br>
corresponding time intervals T1, T2, ..., Tn, .<br>
Preferably, the program means set the S and ELF<br>
fields according to an overall intensity between 1 and 30<br>
mT and respectively a ratio S/ELF comprised between 0,1<br>
and 10 and, in a particularly preferred embodiment,<br>
according to an overall intensity between 1 and 10 mT and<br>
respectively a ratio S/ELF comprised between 0,5 and 5.<br>
The time intervals are preferably set between 1 and<br>
40 minutes.<br>
At least a portion of the working environment is<br>
defined by walls permeable to the S and ELF fields. At<br>
least a portion of the working environment is also<br>
advantageously adjacent to a first and a second coil<br>
respectively and the means for modulating supplying to the<br>
coils DC and AC current respectively.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Several embodiments of the apparatus are shown in<br>
the attached drawings, given as an example and not<br>
limitative, wherein:<br>
- Figure 1 shows a diagrammatical view of a first<br>
embodiment of an apparatus according to the invention;<br>
- Figures 2 to 4 show block diagrams of a second third<br>
and fourth embodiment of an apparatus according to the<br>
invention, respectively;<br>
- Figure 5A shows a diagrammatic function of field<br>
intensity versus time, as programmable in the apparatus<br>
according to the invention;<br>
- Figure 5B shows a diagrammatic function of field<br>
intensity of S and ELF fields versus time varying also the<br>
ratio with respect to each other field;<br>
- Figure 5C shows a diagrammatic function of field<br>
intensity and frequency versus time.<br>
Description of the preferred apparatus<br>
In figure 1 the working environment is indicated as<br>
1 and the wall as 2. The first and second coils are given<br>
the reference numbers 3 and 4 respectively. The modulating<br>
means are diagrammatically indicated by boxes 5 and 6<br>
respectively, and are connected to AC and DC sources.<br>
In figure 2 a different embodiment of the apparatus,<br>
used for interfering with pathological cells survival both<br>
in vitro and in vivo has two coils 23 and 24 located<br>
coaxial to each other at the opposite sides of the working<br>
environment 21. Variable transformers 25 and 26 are<br>
provided connected to a 50 Hz AC electric network 27.<br>
Switenable diode bridges 28 are provided to change the AC<br>
supply to the coils. A DC transformer 29a, a rectifier 29b<br>
as well as a timer 29c are provided supplying two plates<br>
29 so that an up to 20kV/m static (or low frequency<br>
variable up to 1000 Hz) electric field, and preferably<br>
about 6 kV/m, may be created in the working environment 21<br>
within preferred intervals, according to the experimental<br>
conditions.<br>
In figure 3 a further embodiment is shown of the<br>
apparatus used for interfering with pathological cells<br>
survival in vitro having a SELF modulator 35 (1-100 Hz)<br>
and two coils 33 and 34 located coaxial to each other at<br>
the opposite sides of the working environment 31. An<br>
amplifier 36 is used between the modulator 35 and the<br>
coils 33 and 34, which are supplied with the same current<br>
creating in the environment 31 either an S or an ELF<br>
magnetic field.<br>
Another embodiment of the apparatus according to the<br>
invention (fig. 4) used for interfering with pathological<br>
cells survival both in vitro and in vivo has two Helmoltz<br>
coils 43 and 44 located coaxial to each other at the<br>
opposite sides of the working environment 41. An amplifier<br>
46 is used between the modulator 45 and the coils 43 and<br>
44, through a shunt element 47, which is also connected to<br>
a personal computer 49.<br>
Each apparatus can be used for producing SELF<br>
modulated non thermal fields for interfering with<br>
pathological cells survival.<br>
With reference to figures 5A to 5C, an example of<br>
the programming of the apparatus is given wherein the<br>
modulation of intensity, frequency and intensity ratio<br>
between S and ELF fields is carried out.<br>
In figure 5A the way in which the intensity I may<br>
vary versus time. I1, I2, 13, In are the intensity or field<br>
strength (mT) of either the S field, or of the ELF field,<br>
or the overall intensity Is + Ielf.<br>
In figure 5B, when both fields S and ELF are<br>
present, it is possible to modulate not only their<br>
intensity or intensity amplitude, but also their ratio<br>
Is/IeLF. For example, different ratios 1; 1.5; 2; etc. can<br>
be used for time intervals T1, T2; T3; etc.<br>
Also the frequency can be modulated as shown in<br>
figure 5C. The frequency may also be modulated in two or<br>
more following intervals T1, T2, wherein the same intensity<br>
I1-2 is applied.<br>
Starting from the basic examples of figures 5A-5C a<br>
sequence of modulated S, ELF, S+ELF fields can be produced<br>
that can also be repeated cyclically.<br>
The method according to the invention will now be<br>
described in more detail by way of specific examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
In this experiment the capability of inducing<br>
apoptosis by SELF magnetic field as a function of field<br>
intensity and frequency was studied in vitro.<br>
Human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (WiDr) grown in<br>
confluent monolayers in T2 5 flasks was used for the<br>
experiment. For each exposure condition 6 flasks<br>
containing each about 10 millions cells were used, 3<br>
exposed and 3 shame-exposed (i.e. not exposed).<br>
During the exposure the flasks were held between two<br>
coils connected with a circuit providing DC and AC<br>
currents up to 100 Hertz. The temperature was continuously<br>
monitored and maintained at 37 ± 0,2 °C.<br>
The exposure duration was 2 0 minutes for each<br>
experiment and the SELF field was maintained constant.<br>
After 3 hours the cells were treated with May- Grunwald-<br>
Gierasa. Apoptosis was assessed by counting the number of<br>
apoptotic nuclei per 10 high power fields (HPF) by using<br>
an optic microscope.<br>
The amount of induced apoptosis was evaluated by the<br>
ratio between the number of apoptotic cells found in the<br>
exposure group and the number of apoptotic cells found in<br>
the shame-exposed group, that is the group not exposed to<br>
the magnetic fields according to the invention.<br>
Table 1 reports the results obtained in different<br>
exposure conditions.<br>
All the results were statistically highly significant<br>
(at the t Student test) . From Table 1 we can see that the<br>
apoptosis effect appears at 2 mT and doubles starting from<br>
3 mT.<br>
Another important finding is that apoptosis doesn't<br>
depend upon SELF field frequency. In other words during<br>
the lifetime of the mechanism operating the biological<br>
effect (apoptosis) the ELF field is seen as essentially<br>
constant. This means that between the two hypothesised<br>
mechanism, free- radicals (occurring in a time scale of<br>
nano- to microsecond) and ion resonance-like mechanisms,<br>
the free radical one is playing the role [39Scaiano, 1994,<br>
40Engstrom, 1997].<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In this experiment the selective effect of SELF<br>
magnetic fields was verified exposing three cell lines.<br>
Two lines were malignant, human colon adenocarcinoma cells<br>
(WiDr) and human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The normal<br>
cell line was human lung fibroblast (MRC-5).<br>
As in the example 1 each cell line was grown in<br>
confluent raonolayers in T25 flasks. The experimental<br>
protocol was the same as in example 1. Six flasks (3<br>
exposed and three shame-exposed) for each cell line were<br>
exposed for 20 minutes. Apoptosis was evaluated after 3<br>
hours. The exposure conditions used were the R type of<br>
Table 1.<br>
The results are reported in Table 2.<br>
As shown in Table 2 only cancer cells reported an<br>
apoptosis increment statistically highly significant,<br>
whereas the normal cell line didn't. The difference in<br>
percentage of apoptosis between the two cancer cell lines<br>
was expected due to the two different duplication times.<br>
In fact WiDr duplicates faster than MCF-7. The results<br>
were evaluated at t Student test.<br>
KXAMPT.E 3<br>
In this example nude mice (nu/nu) bearing<br>
subcutaneous tumour masses were used to assess the<br>
influence of SELF magnetic fields on tumour growth<br>
inhibition.<br>
Each mouse was inoculated subcutaneously with 10<br>
million human colon adenocarcinoma cells (WiDr). Two<br>
experiments were successively carried out.<br>
In the first experiment, 36 female mice were<br>
randomly assigned to 4 experimental groups, each formed by<br>
6 exposed and 3 shame-exposed for a total of 24 animals<br>
exposed to 4 different SELF magnetic fields and 12 shame-<br>
exposed.<br>
A Static Electric Field up to 6 kV/m was also<br>
applied to eventually take advantage of the different<br>
electrical behaviour between tumoral and normal tissues<br>
[41Thornton, 1984; 42Barsamian, 1987]<br>
In the second experiment 24 female mice were randomly<br>
assigned to 2 experimental groups, formed by 12 exposed to<br>
the SELF exposure condition which gave the best results among<br>
the four exposure conditions used in the previous experiment<br>
(exposure condition number 4), and 12 shame-exposed.<br>
All the mice of both experiments were divided into<br>
experimental groups after the tumor masses for each animal<br>
were palpable.<br>
The animals were exposed for 70 minutes, once a day,<br>
for 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. During the exposure each<br>
mouse was put in a single box made of Plexiglas held<br>
between two coils connected to a circuit providing DC and<br>
AC current up to 100 Hz respectively.<br>
Nude mice were kept under specific pathogen free<br>
conditions and supplied with "ad libitum" diet. All the<br>
tests were conducted in accordance with the protocol<br>
issued by N.I.H. (US National Institute of Health) and<br>
N.C.I. (US National Cancer Institute).<br>
The tumor masses were measured twice a week and their<br>
volume calculated in mm3 according to the formula:<br>
[(major diameter) x (minor diameter squared)] / 2.<br>
After 4 weeks the animals were sacrificed and<br>
autopsied. Tumor masses were extracted, weighed and<br>
measured. Portions of tumors were used for different<br>
analysis, i.e.<br>
— immunoistochemical: Ki-67 antigen for proliferative<br>
index, p-53 antigen for the expression of p-53 gene;<br>
— hystopathological: hematossilina-eosin staining for the<br>
assessment of number of mitosis;<br>
— ultrastructural: electron microscopy;<br>
— nucleic acid hybridisation: Tunel method for apoptosis<br>
evaluation.<br>
In addition, the following organs were extracted from<br>
each animal for histologic examination to assess the<br>
treatment toxicity: brain, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs,<br>
axillary and inguinal limphonodes, mediastinal<br>
limphonodes, ovaries, skin, spleen, bone marrow,<br>
subcutaneous tissue (site of tumoral cell line<br>
implantation) as well as blood tests.<br>
The obtained results are reported in Table 3 for the<br>
first experiment and in Table 4 for the second.<br>
The data reported in tables 3 and 4 show that SELF<br>
fields have an inhibitory tumor growth effect in vivo.<br>
This effect, found in both experiments, was statistically<br>
highly significant (in the first experiment, mostly for<br>
the exposure condition 4) at the Dunnet and t Student<br>
tests respectively.<br>
At the histologic examination of 12 organs for each<br>
animal for all groups no differences were found between<br>
exposed and shame-exposed mice. No differences were also<br>
found in the blood tests. These findings prove the absence<br>
of toxicity related to the SELF fields treatment.<br>
The ultrastructural analysis by electron microscope<br>
showed in the tumor cells of exposed animals many cellular<br>
alterations: presence of apoptotic bodies and condensed<br>
chromatin near the nuclear membrane characteristic of<br>
apoptotic events.<br>
In addition a consistent result is represented by<br>
morphological modifications, increase of number and<br>
dimensions of mitochondria as well as number of nucleoli,<br>
presence of many vacuoles inside the cytoplasm. Non<br>
neoplastic cells (i.e. epithelial and stromal cells)<br>
showed no differences between exposed and shame-exposed<br>
animals in agreement with the absence of toxicity found in<br>
12 normal organs examined in each animal.<br>
The increment in apoptosis as well as the decrement<br>
in p53 gene expression found in exposed mice tumors (see<br>
tables 3 and 4) are statistically highly significant (t<br>
Student test)<br>
Results reported in Table 3 and 4 are in agreement<br>
with those obtained in vitro and shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
The effect induced by the SELF magnetic fields on p53<br>
expression enforces the apoptosis results and is in<br>
agreement with the hypothesised biophysical mechanism<br>
(i.e. free radical recombination) by which the SELF fields<br>
have an anti-tumor effect through formation of reactive<br>
oxygen species and the degradation of mithocondrial<br>
components.<br>
example 4<br>
In this experiment nude mice (nu/nu) previously<br>
subcutaneous inoculated with 10 million human colon<br>
adenocarcinoma cells (WiDr) were exposed to study the<br>
animal survival.<br>
After the cell inoculation 2 groups of mice were<br>
randomly formed respectively of 16 animals exposed and 17<br>
shame-exposed. The mice of the former group were exposed<br>
70 minutes once a day, for 5 days a week, for their entire<br>
life beginning after 24 hours after the tumor inoculation.<br>
The exposure conditions were the same of the<br>
experiment the results which are reported in Table 4.<br>
As in the previous example, the mice were maintained<br>
under specific pathogen free condition supplied with "ad<br>
libitum" diet. All the tests were conducted in accordance<br>
with protocol issued by N.I.H. and N.C.I.<br>
The antitumor effectiveness of the treatment was<br>
evaluated by using the N.C.I, formula: ratio between exposed<br>
and shame-exposed animals of the average animal life span.<br>
This average was evaluated summing for each experimental<br>
group the time of survival divided by the number of animals.<br>
The effectiveness is obtained when the N.C.I, formula gives<br>
as result an index equal or greater than 1.25.<br>
Table 5 reports for each experimental group, the<br>
number of living animals at different times (days) from<br>
the beginning of experiment.<br>
The N.C.I, formula applied to the results reported in<br>
Table 5 gives an index equal to 1.31, that is greater than<br>
1.25 . After 194 days 6 exposed mice were alive whereas<br>
all shame exposed mice were dead.<br>
