FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The present invention relates to a comprehensive patient management system. Specifically, the present invention provides advanced diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic capabilities to healthcare workers located in remote, rural and resource-poor urban centers. More specifically, the present invention provides physician and non-physician healthcare workers access to advanced diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic capabilities useful for managing patients with chronic diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] Medical care in developing countries and rural communities presents a challenge to public health officials in that highly efficacious therapies are often not available. In some of these areas the only health care workers available are not physicians but rather nurses or other aid workers who are not trained to prescribe today's complex treatments for many diseases. One disease that has proven to be particularly difficult to manage in resource-poor countries or rural areas is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or HIV-related disease.<br>
/<br><br>

Docket 52023-00001<br>
[0005] Human immunodeficiency virus was first identified in 1981 and has since spread in epidemic proportions throughout the world. In the early years, the diagnosis of AIDS was an automatic death sentence, and the scientific community embarked on an aggressive search for a vaccine and a cure.<br>
[0006] While these goals are still elusive, treatments have been devised that have resulted in HIV/AIDS becoming a treatable, chronic disease. Anti-retroviral drugs are taken in various combinations and according to a range of schedules, for the remainder of the patients' lives. This regime is called High Activity Anti-Retroviral Therapies (HAART; also known as Anti-Retroviral Therapy [ART or ARVJ). The ideal result is a lowering of the virus in the bloodstream to undetectable amounts. In this case, the patients' immune systems recover, or do not deteriorate, and they can live healthy and productive lives. This scenario is a reality for most in the USA, Canada and Europe. These developed countries have the political will to deal with this disease, and a complex medical infrastructure to diagnose and treat their population. The public health message of prevention is also emphasized. In addition, from a public health standpoint it is hypothesized that lowering many individual's viral load effectively lowers the viral load of the entire community and may slow transmission.<br>
[0007] In stark contrast, many developing countries across Africa, Asia and South America have unsophisticated medical infrastructure. South Africa, for example, holds the dubious distinction of having the highest AIDS infection rate/death rate in the world, with other southern African nations in close contention. In late 2003, the South African Government released a plan to roll out HAART as part of an HIV/AIDS management plan.<br>
[0008] South Africa has become an example for how devastating the AIDS epidemic can become when left unchecked. In this area of Africa, HIV is primarily transmitted through unprotected heterosexual sex. It can take many years for a person infected with HIV to become ill. During this period, sexually active adults spread the virus through the population; HIV is also transmitted from mother to infant in utero. Once a patient's immune system begins to deteriorate to full-blown AIDS, they easily contract opportunistic infections like tuberculosis, pneumonia and cancer. A significant proportion of the South African Department of Health ("DOH") budget of<br><br>
1<br>
Docket 52023-00001<br>
US$3 billion is currently spent on treating these secondary diseases with costly hospitalization and medication.<br>
[0009] Without the rollout of an HIV/AIDS management plan which includes universal access to HAART, by 2008 the current life expectancy for a South African male will fall from 54 to 36 years, and the estimated number of AIDS orphans will rise from 420,000 to 1.6 million. The social cost is a catastrophe of grave proportion; the indirect economic cost would be a devastating 17% (US$ 22 billion) of the South African GNP.<br>
[0010] The health care budget of the DOH currently spent on treating the opportunistic diseases and end-stage infection could more effectively be focused on providing HAART to the infected population as an integral part of a comprehensive management plan. The factors that prevented aggressive HAART treatment of the infected population in South Africa in the past are complex. Recent legal developments have obliged the DOH to administer the anti-viral drug Nevirapine to pregnant mothers and their newborn babies, and settlement has been reached regarding patents of many of the anti-viral drugs. Even as the political will has evolved toward an aggressive management plan, there is limited infrastructure to administer HAART to the urban population, even less so to those dispersed in remote rural areas.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] The present invention provides a therapeutic management system comprising advanced diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic capabilities to healthcare workers located in remote, rural and underdeveloped urban centers. More specifically, the present invention provides non-physician healthcare workers access to advanced diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic capabilities useful for managing diseases including, but not limited to, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The present invention provides a practical solution to managing disease in remote resource-poor population centers by providing individualized patient care without having highly trained infectious disease physician specialists located at each site.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0077] The present invention provides advanced diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic capabilities to healthcare workers located in remote, rural and underdeveloped urban centers. More specifically, the present invention provides non-physician healthcare workers access to advanced diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic capabilities useful for managing diseases including, but not limited to, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The present invention provides a practical solution to managing disease in remote resource-poor population centers by providing individualized patient care without having highly trained infectious disease physician specialists located at each site.<br>
[0078] Human immunodeficiency virus causes a complicated life-threatening infection that is presented in this application as a non-limiting example of the scope of the disease management system of the present invention. Human immunodeficiency virus infection presents as a complex multi-factorial disease that is challenging to manage even in modern urban centers where state-of-the-art teaching hospitals and highly trained physician specialists are readily available. Patient management becomes considerably more difficult when infected individuals are located in underdeveloped urban centers and remote rural locations (herein after referred to as remote patient management).  Remote patient management is further<br><br>
12<br>
Docket 52023-00001<br>
exacerbated when the most highly trained healthcare worker is, for example, a community nurse or Red Cross-Red Crescent aid-worker.<br>
[0079] In many remote patient management environments, laboratory facilities, pharmacies and diagnostic imaging facilities are located hundreds of miles away. Moreover, even when these facilities are located within a reasonable proximity, patient transportation to and from testing and drug dispensing centers may be unavailable or at best unreliable.<br>
[0080] Persons infected with HIV can often have a series of HIV-related diseases which require regular medical evaluations in order to monitor disease progression and therapy efficacy. Test interpretation and therapeutic recommendations often require the expertise of a trained infectious disease specialist. Consequently, persons located in remote patient management environments are less likely to volunteer for testing for HIV because they have learned from experience that treatment options are not readily available. Therefore, there is no benefit to the patient to know their HIV status. As a result a culture of fear and ignorance has proliferated in underdeveloped urban centers and remote rural locations that feed an ever growing HIV pandemic.<br>
[0081] The present invention provides a solution to the problem of unavailability of specialized medical services in underdeveloped urban centers and rural locations. Recent telecommunication advances have made modem access to centralized computer databases available even in the most remote and disadvantaged areas. The present invention utilizes this global communication phenomena to bring cutting edge patient management tools directly to the patient. In one embodiment of the present invention, a non-physician healthcare worker is provided with questionnaires and protocols developed by physician experts. Using these tools, combined with rudimentary physical examination skills, the non-physician healthcare worker becomes a virtual infectious disease diagnostician. Answers to the patient questionnaire and the results of the physical examination are entered into the database locally or remotely and the algorithm feature of the present invention collates and analyzes the individualized patient data. Appropriate biological samples, principally blood, are collected and sent to a designated testing facility where the samples are tested and the results are entered into the same database<br><br>
I 3<br>
Docket 52023-00001<br>
and the algorithm of the present invention applied. Based on the combined results of the laboratory tests, questionnaire and physical examination, a preliminary diagnosis is established and an appropriate treatment regimen proposed. As used herein, an appropriate treatment regimen is defined as any treatment which a person skilled in the art of disease management would consider useful in the management of patient's disease state. In a non-limiting example, HAART is an appropriate therapeutic regimen for a patient suffering from HIV disease. Patients presenting with symptoms consistent with secondary infections or disorders can then be further examined and additional tests run as indicated, or referred to tertiary centers.<br>
[0082] Each time the patient is examined and tested the resulting data is collated, entered and analyzed by the algorithm of the present invention. The non-physician healthcare worker is then provided with an individualized prognostic determination and recommended changes to the therapeutic regimen if required. Consequently, persons in resource-poor urban centers and remote rural settings will now have access to modern diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic capabilities similar to those available to citizens of countries with sophisticated health care systems. The system of the present invention provides training to the non-physician healthcare worker thereby improving healthcare in general.<br>
[0083) Thus, the system of the present invention offers an elegant and practical solution which will allow, as an example, wide and cost-effective High Activity Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART, ART or ARV) for HIV/AIDS in the developing world. In an illustrative embodiment, a national or regional health agency in a country in need of disease management support will use the HIV/AIDS disease management system of the present invention that includes transport of blood samples to laboratories, input of data, drug prescription generation and dispensing, as well as psychosocial and nutrition support, education and pharmacovigilance.<br>
[0084] Laboratory services, data input, drug packaging and drug dispensing currently exist in many countries and disadvantaged areas, but not as part of an integrated system. The importance of offering national or regional health agencies an integrated management package cannot be overemphasized. In addition, the collection of data that this system facilitates is invaluable for financial, demographic and scientific projections.<br><br>
14<br>
Docket 52023-00001<br>
[0085] Data collection using the disease management system of the present invention also provides critical pharmacovigiiance information. Adverse drug reactions can be frequent or rare but information on these reactions is critical in disease management by physicians or non-physician healthcare workers. Once data is collected by the system of the present invention and analyzed by algorithms disclosed as embodiments of the present invention, the data is collected into a pharmacovigiiance database where it is available to influence future drug therapy regimens.<br>
[0086] Pharmacovigiiance embodiments of the system of the present invention include:<br>
•	determine the burden of drug-related morbidity and mortality in patients<br>
•	provide training and information to healthcare workers and patients on the safe use of drugs<br>
•	provide information on risks and benefits of disease treatments, including over the counter medications.<br>
•	identify, assess and communicate new safety concerns associated with the use drugs<br>
•	minimize the impact of misleading or unproven associations between adverse events and drug therapy<br>
•	to   detect,   assess   and   respond   to   safety   concerns   related   to complementary, alternative and traditional medicines<br>
•	to establish an early warning system for resistance to drugs<br>
•	to respond to unfounded and unsubstantiated claims of efficacy of untested products and treatment modalities.<br>
[0087] In an illustrative embodiment, the present invention includes a specialized algorithm to assist health care workers with the medication management of HIV/AIDS and related opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB). The major features of the disease management system of the present invention include:<br>
•	medication protocols for specific/individual patients based on evidence-based treatment algorithms<br>
•	seamless, rapid implementation of new drug protocols<br>
•	support and tracking of drug reaction mitigation<br><br>
15<br>
Docket 52023-00001<br>
•	tracking of drug resistant viral mutations<br>
•	treatment regardless of geographic location and distance from urban centers<br>
•	automatic monitoring of high-risk patients<br>
•	complex cases referred for medical specialist consultation<br>
•	pharmacovigilance - tracking and monitoring of adverse reactions to HAARTorART<br>
•	reliable geographic health statistics for public and private sector health planners<br>
[0088] In one embodiment of the present invention, an algorithm provides a disease management system for HIV/AIDS using approved anti-retroviral treatment protocols. The algorithms of the present invention:<br>
•	are based on World Health Organization (WHO) standards<br>
•	are easily modifiable to accommodate local standards<br>
•	recommend    a    treatment    protocol    as    approved    by    local payors/government<br>
•	monitor and report the patient's immune function<br>
•	monitor and report adverse events and drug reactions<br>
•	alert clinical staff to clinical parameters outside of normal<br>
•	schedule appointments<br>
•	schedule and monitors laboratory tests and medical procedures<br>
•	schedule delivery of pre-packaged drugs<br>
•	monitor and report compliance with drug regimen<br>
[0089] Among the benefits which may be obtained by the system of the present invention are that public and private healthcare service workers will be enabled to implement and operate a cost-effective system to diagnose and treat patients with HIV/AIDS and related diseases. This will hold true even within limitations of poor medical infrastructure. This system does not require significant increase in the number of doctors needed to treat disease and can coexist with many of the present treatment systems. Such a system will effectively result in a reduction in opportunistic infection rates, as well as lower overall usage of medical services by patients.    The algorithm of the present invention is an effective tool to ensure<br><br>
17<br>
Docket 52023-00001<br>
a nurse. The innovation of the present invention will enable the resource-poor settings to act as if a specialist were present.<br>
[0094] The present invention will dramatically improve the efficiency of the primary health care system to deliver care to its constituency, both in the urban areas, and to the large percentage of the population that live in rural conditions. The primary health care nurses, with the innovative support of the system, can more efficiently provide care for a larger number of patients, and only those who fall outside of the parameters of the algorithm will need to be referred to hospitals or medical specialists.<br>
[0095] The challenge of compliance with complex drug therapy regimens is faced in both developing and developed countries, and is enhanced in uneducated populations. This lack of compliance in HIV/AIDS, for example, is particularly dangerous due to the resultant development of resistant HIV, as well as opportunistic diseases associated with AIDS. This system is innovative in its approach to increased compliance by enhancing monitoring, systematic feedback and automated recordkeeping. In addition to the clinical education provided directly to the patient, the system will note deviations in patterns that indicate low compliance, either through altered immune response, or missed appointments. Communicating this information to the local health care worker will facilitate intervention and increased compliance.<br>
[0096] The system of the present invention allows all personnel and patients to benefit from advances in the treatment of disease. This is a rapidly evolving field, with advances in all areas, from pharmaceuticals to education interventions, being published oh an ongoing basis. As these changes are vetted by, for example, a medical advisory board, and approved by the governmental authorities, they can be implemented almost immediately in the remotest rural location by altering criteria in the central algorithm. One aspect of the novelty of the invention lies in the flexibility inherent in its design to deal with the rapidly evolving science. On the level of the individual patients, the system will enable a rapid response to their changing treatment needs, such as in the development of resistance, or toxicity from anti-retroviral drugs.<br><br>
19<br>
Docket 52023-00001<br>
and implemented to be culture-specific, country-specific and region-specific, and easily adapted to the most current scientific and medical knowledge as agreed to by the provider.<br>
[0101] In another illustrative embodiment, the system of the present invention includes a multi-tiered fully redundant highly available architecture. The system is able to accept input from a variety of existing sources, such as client computers running programs including, but not limited to, the various Windows, Unix or Linux desktop operating systems, laboratory-based computer systems, voice interactive systems and other potential devices including cell phones or specialized medical diagnostic devices. Various communication protocols including, but not limited to, TCP/IP are used to communicate to the servers. The servers may be based locally and/or remotely and are also run in a fully redundant and recoverable manner using current standard computing standards. The servers utilize database systems including, but not limited to, Oracle or Microsoft SQL or IBM DB II. A variety of programming tools, languages and interfaces are used to implement the solution including, but not limited to, C#, C++, Visual Basic, HTML, XML, SSL, Data Base queries, Visio and add-on packages are used in development of the system. A proprietary source code is utilized in the system of the present invention and which can be found in the computer program listing appendix filed on compact disk with this application. The multi-tiered architecture and database design implements a security architecture to provide safeguards to protect the algorithms and patient information from being accessed in a malicious or unauthorized manner. All transactions are logged and tracked and communications are encrypted using the latest standards including 48 bit SSL or 128 bit where possible. The database servers and application servers are placed behind a firewall and use industry accepted standards to protect against unauthorized access.<br>
[0102] The system algorithm of the present invention is built upon a state-of-the-art medical knowledge database. The most current peer-reviewed treatment protocols are included. The system supports customizations from end-users arid local healthcare personnel to ensure that local requirements are taken into account. The system includes a focus on education, communication and prevention options that are integrated with the algorithm implementation.   The system is capable of<br><br>
21<br>
Docket 52023-00001<br>
timeframe compatible with the tests required. The system will be able to optimize and utilize this network for pathology, as well as for data input. In a novel approach, the transportation system will also be used to deliver pre-packaged drugs to the clinic to be dispensed by the nurse. Additionally, in areas where lack of telephone or wireless services prevent data entry and transmission directly into a computerized database, paper forms can be sent to the pathology lab along with samples to be entered into the disease management system by lab personnel.<br>
[0108]     3.     Opportunistic infections will be treated.<br>
[0109] 4. HIV Treatment. The algorithm of the present invention will be applied to the patient data, with several possible outcomes:<br>
[0110]	a.     Patient's immune system is not compromised enough to require<br>
HAART. Patient receives education on the natural history of the disease, nutrition and preventing transmission of HIV. Depending on their nutritional status, supplemental vitamins, minerals, and protein will be dispensed by the system. A novel feature of the system lies in its ability to begin to empower the patient to be compliant with a regular regimen of pills/supplements and follow-up appointments, to have them benefit from support groups, and to keep them within the system of the present invention so that they receive social and emotional support, and antiretroviral therapy as soon as they require it. These patients will be reevaluated according to the intervals outlined in the protocol. An exemplary, non-limiting example is re-evaluation every three months.<br>
[0111]	b.     Patient is severely immune compromised and acutely ill with a<br>
severe or life-threatening opportunistic infection. Patient is referred to a hospital or tertiary center, and enters the system of the present invention on their discharge to their community.<br>
[0112]	c.     Patient's immune system is compromised enough to require<br>
HAART, but they fall within the extremes of the parameters of the system algorithm of the present invention, or they present with unusual signs and symptoms. The algorithm would refer all cases at the borders of the parameters to be reviewed by a physician, who would enter orders into the system of the present invention. Through this mechanism, the parameters<br><br>
23<br>
Docket 52023-00001<br>
the algorithm become wider and wider. Patient data remains within system, even when they are referred to a different hospital.<br>
[0119] 7. Communication of data and treatment plans back to healthcare worker. There will be communication back to the healthcare worker regarding the patients status, lab results and treatment/care plan as reflected in the database and interpreted by the algorithm of the present invention. Communication can be in the form of SMS, or hard copies of reports delivered with the medication. Batch reporting can include such information such as upcoming visits, and those patients who missed appointments and require intervention.<br>
[0120] This feedback of processed information to healthcare workers can be used to empower them by increasing their level of knowledge about the management of HIV and associated diseases, and supporting them in the care of these patients.<br>
[0121] 8. Patient re-evaluation per protocol. Patients will be re-evaluated according to the protocol and algorithm of the present invention. For example, when beginning HAART, patients will be recalled within a shorter duration than those who have proven their compliance and tolerance for the drugs over a period of time. If testing reveals a patient is non-compliant the patient would be placed on a shorter interval between scheduled tests.<br>
[0122] At each step of the operating system loop, patient data can be accessed remotely by healthcare workers at any site where the patient is seeking medical attention. This feature allows the successful management of nomadic patients or in instances when patients require treatment or follow-up away from their home provider.<br>
[0123] An exemplary, non-limiting algorithm useful in an embodiment of the invention is depicted in the flow chart diagram of FIG. 4. (Note that FIGS. 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 are part of the same flow chart.)<br>
[0124] The exemplary algorithm of FIG. 4 presents a disease management system for HIV/AIDS. It would be reasonable to one skilled in the art to use this algorithm in the treatment of other diseases besides HIV/AIDS. Therefore the use of HIV/AIDS in the algorithm of the present invention is for exemplary purposes only and the present invention is intended to be used for the treatment of a wide range of<br><br>
