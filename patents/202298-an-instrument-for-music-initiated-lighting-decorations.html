COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10, Rule 13)<br>
AN INSTRUMENT FOR MUSIC INITIATED LIGHTING DECORATIONS<br>
Shri. Nivrutti Shivaram Patil, residing At &amp; Post Dhamane, Taluka Ajara, District Kolhapur-416220, Maharashtra, India, an Indian national.<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
352/MUMNP/2000<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
20-1-2005<br><br><br>
The  following   specification   particularly  describes  the   nature   of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
This invention relates to an instrument for music initiated lighting decorations. More particularly it relates to an instrument useful for music initiated decorations comprising of sets of lights, which change the pattern and combinations of colours corresponding to the changes of the musical rhythm. Such a decoration comprising plurality of sets of lights of various colours and decorative arrangements controlled automatically by the instrument provided by the present invention could be used in various festivities wherein it is intended to have an effect of the lighting dancing to the tune of music. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Use of lighting in festivities to give a decorative touch to such festivities is a very common phenomenon. The lights arranged in artistic fashion have been used in various religious functions. In India in particular the lighting with catchy colours and special arrangements have always been used in all sorts of functions, religious, political, social or otherwise. Such arrangement of coloured lighting often consists of sets of bulbs arranged in decorative and artistic manner with flashing, lighting or shutting off effect in a particular manner to give pleasing visual experience.<br>
Attempts have often been made for more and more improvements in the arrangements and colour schemes of the sets of lights. A further step in this direction was to have pleasing arrangement of the lights with specific colours and set. Arrangements are also made for making thes,e sets of lights with pleasing  colour combinations to appear to change the<br><br><br>
patterns, colours as per the musical rhythms. Such decorations are used at various functions and the venues such functions. In India there have been healthy competitions in various social or religious institutions to make such arrangement more and more attractive. Such competitions are more vivid in famous festivals like Ganapati Festival, Durga Festival Christmas, Id-a-milad other festivals of almost all the religious communities in India. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Conventionally, such a decoration appearing to be synchronized with the music played in the background comprises a simple mechanical rotary instrument. It primarily consists of a cylindrical drum made up of a non conducting material, having on its surface various strips made up of conducting material and arranged on the surface of the drum in a systematic or random manner. Sets of brushes always remain in touch with the surface of this drum, which can be mechanically rotated either manually or by motors. Other ends of the brush are connected to wires of various sets of plurality of light bulbs of different colours and size with decorative arrangements. As the drum rotates the brushes make or lose contacts with different strips of the conducting material on the surface of the drum, thereby causing the electrical circuits to open or close electrical circuits attached to such strips resulting in switching on and off the sets of plurality of light bulbs. As the drum rotates further such circuits are opened or closed due to breaks and gapes in the metal strips thereby changing the lighting pattern of the other set of lights. The arrangement of strips on the<br><br><br>
surface of the drum and the electrical wiring attached to the sets of brushes with different attractive colours define the sequence of the lighting, its pattern, colours and getting on and off. Such arrangement made in a systematic manner gives eye pleasing display of the lighting decorations.<br>
A new dimension was given to this mechanical arrangement when such arrangement of lighting decoration was played in tandem with the music. The size of the drum, the arrangement of the conducting strips and the number of brushes are so arranged as to have a very large cycle of lighting and changing the patterns of lighting decoration. When such a lighting decorations are put on simultaneously in tandem with the music, psychological effect of lighting, dancing to the tune of the music is created. In such a device there is no direct link between the source of music and the sequence of the sets of lights getting on and off although one has feeling that the lighting is dancing to the tune of music.<br>
In the prior art also various references are available wherein various devices are described for ornamental use of the lighting. U.S. patent No. 4,713,586 granted to Chiang of Taiwan described an improved decorative set of lights with clusters of light bulbs, and electric circuit and a D.C. power source of actuating the bulbs of clusters of lights bulbs and the electric circuit, wherein the circuit has two oscillators for producing pulse, a comparator for comparing the pulse of the tow oscillators, a decoder actuated by the comparator. Random output signal are given by the<br><br><br>
decoding means for lighting the bulbs randomly as the light set sparkle without using a long extending wire from the power source.<br>
In another US patent No. 4,890,000 to Chou of Taiwan has been described a digital control circuit for controlling the illumination of a plurality of lamps bulbs to create a decorative light display. The circuit includes a rectifier for converting alternating current to direct current as power for the digital element of the control circuit and for the lamp bulbs of the display. The display is formed by a plurality of strings of series connected lamp bulbs each of which string is supplied through individual SCRs. The control circuit described and claimed in this patent includes two oscillators, two decoders and a carry out control, which generate different frequencies. The two sequences of output signals from the control circuit are each applied through isolating diodes and individual trigger circuits to the gate electrodes of the SRCs, causing the SRCs to conduct and illuminate each of the strings of lamps in sequences corresponding to the sequences of control circuit output signals.<br>
The US patent No. 5,111,113 to Chu describes initiated Christmas light set controller. It includes a circuit board connected to a plurality of light sets, a bridge rectifier, a voltage regulator circuit, a music generating IC, a piezoelectric transducer and alternative switch IC and plurality of thyristors. The output of the bridge rectifier is coupled to a voltage regulation circuit for dropping and filtering the voltage to form a stable voltage to an alternative switch IC. The IC is triggered by the music<br><br><br>
generated by the music IC to provide a slated one of the three different outputs utilized to further trigger on thyristors which drive several light sets to twinkle, flash or be steadily illuminated.<br>
The conventional drum mechanism used in the countries like India has several drawbacks. The lighting decoration in such arrangement has no direct connection with the rhythm of the music on which it is played. The size of the decoration and the numbers of sets of light arrangements are also a limited by the size of the drum, the number of brushes and the conducting strips on the surface of the drum. Manual attention is also necessary for working of the device and there is every hazard of shocks and short circuit as the contacts of brushes and wiring of the lighting are open.<br>
The control devices or the music initiated light set controllers described in the above prior art have various limitations. The decorative light sets described in US patent No. 4,890,000 and the decorative lights sets of US patent No. 4,713,586 are the devices only for illumination control of the set of lights. Their operations are not coupled or linked to the music.<br>
In the music initiated Christmas light set controller of US patent No. 5,111,113 the music input is in the form of a music IC. The music is embedded in the board and gives music input limited by the characteristic of the said IC. The light sets also either twinkle, flash or steadily illuminate, but apparently particular set of light with desired combination of colours<br><br><br>
cannot be switched off which is essential for very large lighting decoration consisting of thousands or even more electric bulbs of different pattern, shape, colour and delighting arrangements which are necessary for the decorations.<br>
It is therefore desirable that a new instrument be developed for automatic control of music initiated lighting system, which is useful for the large decorations. Such a device should be capable of taking input from any type of sound signals, which is not specific to a device and even any sound inputs in that sense, particularly the musical playing instruments like radios, tape recorders or even microphones.<br>
The novelty of the instrument given by the present invention lies in the fact that it provides a system which gets initiated only when there is some sound input given to the system through the instrument, and the lighting actually responds to the ups and downs of the input signals, and play in tune with the rhythm of the input signals<br>
The object of the present invention therefore is to provide an instrument for music initiated lighting decoration, which utilizes any sound input generated by musical instrument but not limited to such as radio, tape recorder, and stereo players, audio or video systems including human vocal inputs.<br>
Another object is to provide an instrument, which is useful for very large decorations consisting of sets of thousands of plurality of light bulbs of various shapes, colours and arrangements.<br><br><br>
Yet another object is to provide an instrument which gives delightful and eye pleasing display of lighting decoration which is actually triggered and controlled according to the rhythms, ups and downs of the musical notes and not making only the psychological impact.<br>
Still another object is to provide an instrument for the music initiated lighting arrangement, which dispenses attention of the attendants or need to synchronize the starting of the music and the lighting arrangements. The instrument provided by the present invention also dispenses the requirement of stopping the music and the light decoration at the same time as the lighting decoration is triggered by only upon the sound inputs.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an instrument for music initiated lighting decorations, which comprises a box casing, disposed within the said box casing a power supply, a printed circuit board (PCB), sockets for sound input, sockets for connecting lighting bulbs and volume controller for sound inputs and a plurality of sets of lighting bulbs.<br>
The forgoing and additional advantages of the present invention and the inventive features will be clearly apparent upon reading of the ensuing brief and   detailed summery of drawings accompanying this specification which should not however be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner whatsoever.

The working of the instrument and the lighting system attached to the said instrument could be explained as here in aftr. The sound signals in the from of output of musical instruments, radio, tape recorders or even the outputs of the microphone are input to the instrument through the input sockets (4) which triggers the audio IC (12) and generates voltage potential, depending upon the input strength, the voltage potential is then supplied to the set of plurality of lighting bulbs (19) and (22) through transistors (17) and (20), triac (18) and (21) diodes (23) and (24). The light bulbs are arranged artistically in the form of patterns of colour, shape according to the design of the desired decoration and visual effects. The voltage generated in the IC (12) depends upon the sound intensity, notes and rhythm of the sound output which activate the plurality of sets of light bulbs to twinkle, flash, close or remain steady according to the sound input<br>
The advantages of the present invention are as follows:<br>
1 .       The display of lighting bulbs is exactly according to the ups and downs of the sound input, particularly eye pleasing when it is musical input.<br>
2.        The  instrument can  be  used  for controlling  the  lighting decoration consisting of very large number of bulb arranged<br><br><br>
as per the desing and requirements of the functions in which<br>
they are required.<br>
There is no need for any manual attention for starting or<br>
putting off the lighting as music and required in conventional<br>
lighting decoration .The lighting decoration will not illuminate<br>
unless the sound input is given to the instrument.<br>
Although the instrument can be preferably used for music<br>
initiated   lighting  the  sound   input  is   not  limited  to  any<br>
particular   source   or   any   particular   continuous   rhythm<br>
generated by convential Ics'. The sound input could even be<br>
the speech or live programe and the lighting effect will be true<br>
to the ups and downs of the sound input.<br>
The instrument being compact and  handy eliminates the<br>
problems    of   size   and   transportrtion    as    in    case    of<br>
conventional drum type instrument.<br>
The capacity of the instrument can be expanded by simple<br>
addition of small electronic components thereby eliminating<br>
the need of complicated designs and arrangement of the<br>
metal strips and large number brushes as required in case of<br>
conventional drum type instrument.<br>
The instrument can be ideally used for various functions and<br>
making illuminations and lighting decorations of any types<br>
particularly the lighting decorations of any type particularly<br>
the<br><br><br>
lighting   decorations   of   buildings,   or   in   various   religious functions. 8.     Hazards of shocks and short circuit are minimised due to eliminations   of   the   brush   and   the   mechanically   moving components.<br><br><br>
