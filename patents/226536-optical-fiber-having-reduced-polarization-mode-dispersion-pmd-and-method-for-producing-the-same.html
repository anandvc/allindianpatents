3. Preamble to the Description:-Complete Specification:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the Invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
STER/P A/036<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to optical fiber having reduced polarization mode dispersion [PMD]. Particularly, it relates to method for producing an optical fiber having reduced PMD. More particularly, it relates to a method for<br>
5	producing optical fiber preform having symmetrically and completely collapsed capillary, which is   suitable for producing optical fiber having reduced PMD. Even more particularly, it relates to a method for producing optical fiber preform having symmetrically and completely collapsed capillary, wherein the preform produced has diameter more than about 90 mm or weight more than <br>
10     about 9Kg, and is suitable for producing optical fiber having reduced PMD. <br>
       Background of Invention:<br>
Optical fibers are inherently versatile as a transmission medium for all<br>
forms  of information,   be  it  voice,   video  or  data.   The  primary  object  of<br>
            telecommunication industry is to transmit larger amounts of information over                                    <br>
15        longer   distances   in   shorter  period   of time.   In  the  recent  years,   certain<br>
improvements have taken place in the light carrying ability of the optical fibers.                                    The light carrying ability of the optical fibers for communication is<br>
primarily determined by attenuation loss and PMD. The optical losses, that is,<br>
            attenuation loss in the fiber are caused by many factors including absorption                                     <br>
20        loss, scattering of light, and PMD in fiber are caused by imperfect geometry of<br>
the fiber, stress and structural defects in the fiber.                                     It has been observed that imperfect geometry of the fiber, and stress and structural defects in the fiber are caused due to unsymmetric and incompletely collapsed centerline [capillary] in the optical fiber preform from which the fiber <br>
25          is drawn. The problems of imperfect geometry of the fiber, and stress and structural defects in the fiber is further enhanced if the preform from which the fiber is drawn has unsymmetric and incompletely collapsed centerline [capillary] particularly at middle portion thereof.<br>
Therefore, the need of the time is to have an optical fiber preform which <br>
30        should have symmetrically and completely collapsed centerline [capillary] so <br>
            that an optical fiber having reduced PMD can be produced.<br>
The co-pending Indian patent application no. 494/MUM/2004 [IPA494] <br>
defines a process to achieve complete collapsing of the capillary of the preform,<br>
2<br><br>
STER/PA/036<br>
by simultaneously carrying out sintering and collapsing process steps on the<br>
dehydrated hollow soot porous body. In accordance with this method, preform<br>
having completely collapsed capillary is obtained, but the capillary in the top<br>
portion of the preform is still not completely collapsed.<br><br>
5	             The another co-pending Indian patent application no. 1530/MUM/2005<br>
[IPA1530] defines an improved process to achieve complete collapsing of the capillary of the preform, wherein the simultaneous sintering and collapsing process steps are carried out on the dehydrated hollow soot porous body under specifically controlled heating. In accordance with this method, preform having<br>
10          completely collapsed capillary is obtained, particularly having collapsed <br>
              capillary in the top portion of the preform.<br>
It has been observed that both the methods taught in IPA494 and IPA1530 are suitable for achieving complete collapsing of capillary, if the preform prepared has diameter of less than about 90 mm or weight of less than<br>
15             about 9Kg. However, if the preform prepared should have diameter more than about 90 mm or weight more than about 9Kg, then both the methods taught in IPA494 and IPA1530 result in incomplete collapsing of the capillary, particularly in the middle portion.<br>
The methods taught in IPA494 and IPA1530 do not address the problem<br>
20                     of unsymmetric collapsing of the capillary and uncollapsed capillary at the middle portion particularly when the preform prepared is of diameter more than about 90 mm or weight more than about 9 Kg. <br>
           Need of the Invention:<br>
Therefore, there is a need to have a method for preparing an optical fiber<br>
25               preform having symmetrically and completely collapsed centerline [capillary] so that an optical fiber having reduced PMD can be produced therefrom, and to have an optical fiber having reduced PMD. Further, there is a need to have a method for preparing an optical fiber preform wherein the method is suitable even if the preform should have diameter more than about 90 mm or weight<br>
30                  more than about 9 Kg.<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
One of the main objects of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing an optical fiber preform having symmetrically and completely<br>
3<br><br>
STER/PA/036<br>
collapsed centerline [capillary] so that an optical fiber having reduced PMD can be produced therefrom, and to provide an optical fiber having reduced PMD.<br>
The another main object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing an optical fiber preform wherein the method is suitable even for <br>
5            producing preform of diameter more than about 90 mm or weight more than<br>
              about 9 Kg.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing an optical fiber preform having symmetrically and completely collapsed capillary, so that an optical fiber having perfect geometry and, <br>
10       reduced stress and structural defects can be produced therefrom, and to <br>
          provide an optical fiber having perfect geometry, and reduced stress and <br>
         structural defects.<br>
            Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
preparing an optical fiber preform having symmetrically and completely<br><br>
15  collapsed capillary, particularly at and around middle portion thereof, so that<br>
an optical fiber having perfect geometry, and reduced stress and structural<br>
defects can be produced therefrom, and to provide an optical fiber having<br>
perfect geometry, and reduced stress and structural defects over its entire<br>
length.<br><br>
20	          Other  objects  and   advantages  will  be  apparent  from  the  following<br>
description when read in conjunction with the accompanying figures. <br>
Brief Description of the Invention:<br>
It is apparent from the foregoing description that the known methods for producing preform are not suitable for producing a preform having <br>
25        symmetrically and completely collapsed capillary, particularly at the middle <br>
            portion thereof, and having diameter more than about 90 mm or weight more <br>
            than about 9Kg, wherein the preform produced is suitable for producing optical <br>
            fiber having reduced PMD.<br>
	The present inventors have observed that the collapsing of the capillary	<br><br>
30          in a hollow soot porous body or sintered glass body is carried out while applying<br>
a constant vacuum along entire length of hollow soot porous body or sintered<br>
glass body. It has been observed that the collapsing of capillary under constant<br>
4 <br>
y<br><br>
STER/PA/036<br>
 vacuum results in unsymmetrical and incomplete collapsing of the capillary, particularly at    and around its middle portion.<br>
As the mandrel employed in preparation of a preform has tapered diameter for achieving   its easy removal from the soot porous body, the prepared <br>
5      hollow soot porous body and the sintered glass body prepared therefrom are<br>
        observed to have reducing capillary diameter from one end [referred as top end] <br>
        to another end [referred as bottom end] of the soot porous body or sintered <br>
        glass body.<br>
The present inventors have observed that the constant vacuum applied<br>
10    in hollow soot porous body or sintered glass body having capillary of reducing <br>
       [varying] diameter from one end to another end during the collapsing process <br>
       step surprisingly causes unsymmetric and incomplete collapsing of capillary, <br>
          particularly at and around its middle portion while producing the optical fiber preform [mother preform]. Such optical fiber preform having unsymmetric and<br>
15    incompletely collapsed capillary has been observed to have imperfect geometry, non-uniform stress and structural defects at its centerline region. It has also been observed that the preform having unsymmetric and incompletely collapsed capillary meaning thereby having imperfect geometry, non-uniform stress and structural defects at its centerline region produces an optical fiber having<br>
20      imperfect geometry, and stress and structural defects.<br>
It has been further observed that during the collapsing step, the hollow soot porous body or sintered glass body gets stretched, particularly at and around its middle portion primarily due to its larger weight and gravitational force. The un-symmetric stretch of the soot porous body or sintered glass body<br>
25    also causes unsymmetric and incomplete collapsing of capillary, particularly at and around its middle portion while producing the optical fiber preform [mother preform], which is observed to have imperfect geometry, non-uniform stress and structural defects at its centerline region. The preform having unsymmetric and incompletely collapsed capillary produces an optical fiber having imperfect<br>
30      geometry, and stress and structural defects.<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly observed that if the collapsing of capillary in a hollow soot porous body or sintered glass body is carried out under a variable vacuum from one end to another end then the capillary<br>
5<br><br>
STER/P A/036<br>
surprisingly collapses symmetrically and completely over its entire length, including at and around its middle portion meaning thereby it produces the optical fiber preform [mother preform] having perfect geometry, and reduced stress and structural defects at its centerline region, which has been found<br>
 5              suitable to produce an optical fiber having imperfect geometry, and stress and structural defects.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for producing optical fiber preform having symmetrically and completely collapsed capillary which is suitable for producing optical fiber having reduced <br>
10      PMD, comprising collapsing the capillary in the hollow soot porous body or <br>
          sintered glass body under variable vacuum to form optical fiber preform having <br>
         symmetrically and completely collapsed capillary.<br>
       In one embodiment, the present invention also relates to a fiber produced from the preform        produced by employing method of the present invention, <br>
15    wherein the fiber produced has reduced PMD.<br>

Detailed Description and Preferred embodiments of the Invention;<br>
Typically, a preform can be manufactured by a conventional method, for <br>
25         example by ACVD method, which is described herein for reference.<br>
In accordance with a typical ACVD process to manufacture a soot porous body, as illustrated in accompanying Figure 1, the preparation of soot porous body 1 comprises the following steps. The glass-forming precursor compounds are oxidized and hydrolyzed to form porous silica based materials 2. The porous <br>
30      silica based materials 2 are deposited on a mandrel 3, which can be any commercially available mandrel with or without any specific preparation, preferably with specific preparation to remove the contaminants therefrom<br>
7<br><br>
STER/P A/036<br>
which is provided with a handle rod 4 and fitted on a lathe 5 to form soot porous body 1.<br>
During the step of deposition, the mandrel 3 is rotated in a direction as illustrated by an arrow 6 and also moved along its length with reference to <br>
5                 burner 7 to deposit the soot particles 2 on the mandrel 3 for producing soot porous body 1. During the deposition process, the dopant chemicals for example GeCl4 may also be deposited to form the core of the preform and later the dopant chemicals may be terminated to form clad of the preform. The amount of deposition of the clad region 11 and core region 10 is achieved to <br>
10           have any desired ratio diameter of clad region 11 to the diameter of core region 10.<br>
After completion of deposition, the soot porous body 1 is removed from lathe 5 along with mandrel 3 and handle rod 4, and the mandrel 3 is removed/ detached, during the mandrel removal step, from the soot porous body 1 <br>
15       thereby resulting in formation of a hollow cylindrical soot porous body 8 (herein <br>
           after referred to as hollow soot porous body) having a centerline 9 therethrough <br>
           [Figure 2].<br>
The hollow soot porous body 8 thus formed comprises a core region 10 having a centerline hole 9 and a clad region 11 of the optical fiber preform <br>
20      [Figure 3], and said core region 10 has refractive index greater than that of the clad region 11.<br>
After removal/ detachment of mandrel 3 a centerline 9 is created inside<br>
 the soot porous body 1.<br>
                     Now referring to accompanying Figure 4, the prepared hollow soot porous <br>
25      body  101  is transferred to the sintering furnace   100 in order to achieve dehydration of the                                        hollow soot porous body 101 to form dehydrated hollow soot porous body.<br>
The dehydrated hollow soot porous body is subjected to step of sintering<br>
         and collapsing [simultaneously or one after the other] of the centerline 102 to<br>
30     form a solid glass preform 103 [Figure 5] with or without requiring any step of<br>
drilling   or   grinding   or   etching  of  the   centerline   9/102   before   steps   of<br>
consolidation and collapsing.<br>
8<br><br>
STER/P A/036<br>
Thus, the prepared hollow soot porous body 101 is dehydrated, sintered and collapsed to convert it into solid glass preform 103 [the mother preform].<br>
In a typical embodiment of ACVD method, the hollow soot porous body 101, one end of which is provided with a plug 116 is inserted inside the furnace <br>
5            100 with the help of the handle rod 106. The driving mechanism (not shown) facilitates    lowering of the hollow soot porous body 101 into the furnace 100. The furnace 100 comprises a glass muffle tube 110 having a diameter sufficient to accommodate the hollow soot porous body 101 and to adequately provide the environment necessary for dehydration, sintering and collapsing, wherein the<br>
10           sintering and collapsing may either be performed simultaneously or collapsing <br>
               step may be performed after sintering step. The muffle tube 110 is suitable for <br>
               heating to temperatures necessary for dehydration, sintering and collapsing <br>
               process steps with the heating means (not shown) which are suitably fitted to <br>
               the sintering furnace 100.<br>
15	            The heating means selected may be suitable to create three heat zones<br>
inside the muffle tube 110 over a length. A thermocouple (not shown) provided in the furnace 100 measures the temperature of the hot zones inside the furnace created by the heating means, and the data measurement is fed to the temperature controller (not shown) that controls the temperature inside the<br>
20            muffle tube 110.<br>
The furnace 100 is provided with an inlet port 115 located suitably on the furnace, preferably near the bottom of the muffle tube 110 for supplying desired gases in the furnace. The top end of the muffle tube 110 is suitably closed with the lid 113 to achieve the preferred temperature profile inside the<br>
25              muffle tube 110 and to maintain the same during the dehydration, and simultaneous sintering and collapsing process steps, and to avoid leakage of gases from the muffle tube 110 to the outside environment. A suction port 114 is suitably provided near the top of muffle tube 110 to facilitate evacuation of the gases from the muffle tube 110 as and when required or on completion of<br>
30                   the process.<br>
The prepared solid glass preform may optionally be reduced to form a core rod having reduced diameter, which may be overcladded by depositing soot particles to form a soot preform comprising core rod having overclad. The soot<br>
9<br><br>
STER/PA/036<br>
preform may be sintered in a sintering furnace to form daughter preform. The fiber may also be drawn from the daughter preform.<br>
As described herein above, in accordance with known methods, the process step of collapsing                           of capillary of a hollow soot porous body, whether <br>
5           carried out simultaneously with sintering step or after performing the sintering step, is carried under a constant vacuum, which has been observed to result in unsymmetrical and incomplete collapsing of the capillary, particularly at its middle portion. The problem of unsymmetrical and incomplete collapsing of the capillary enhances further when the preform having diameter more than about <br>
10        90 mm or weight more than about 9Kg is required to be produced. The preform, whether mother preform or daughter preform, having unsymmetrical and incomplete collapsed capillary [centerline] has been observed to produce a fiber having increased PMD.<br>
Therefore, the present invention aims to overcome above problems and <br>
15            limitations of the prior art.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for producing optical fiber preform having symmetrically and completely collapsed capillary which is suitable for producing optical fiber having reduced PMD, comprising collapsing the capillary in the hollow soot porous body or <br>
20       sintered glass body under variable vacuum to form optical fiber preform having <br>
           symmetrically and completely collapsed capillary.  <br>
       Accordingly, in another embodiment, the present invention relates to a<br>
method for producing optical fiber having reduced PMD from optical fiber<br>
preform having symmetrically and  completely collapsed capillary which is<br>
25          prepared by collapsing the capillary in the hollow soot porous body or sintered<br>
glass body under variable vacuum.<br>
In accordance with present invention, the fiber having reduced PMD may either be drawn at mother preform stage or at daughter preform stage.<br>
It has been observed by the present inventors that if a mother preform is <br>
30      produced in accordance with present invention by collapsing the capillary in the<br>
 hollow soot porous body or sintered glass body under variable vacuum, it has<br>
      symmetrically  and  completely  collapsed   capillary,  which  has  been  found<br>
