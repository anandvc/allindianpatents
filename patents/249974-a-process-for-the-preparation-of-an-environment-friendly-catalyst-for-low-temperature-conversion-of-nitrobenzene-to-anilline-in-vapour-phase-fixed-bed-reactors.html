Introduction<br>
The invention relates to an environment friendly transition metal catalyst (free from hazardous chromium component) for low temperature conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline in vapour phase at about 140°C to 230°C, preferably 150°C to 220°C. The catalyst of the present invention contains oxide of the said metal promoted with the oxide or oxides of one or two elements, preferably oxide of one element of the lanthanide series and is supported on a composite support material in an optimized proportion of oxides of Group IIA, IIIA and IVA elements with improved total surface area &amp; copper surface area, as well as an optimized proportion of binder, resulting in a more active, selective and stable catalyst suitable for commercial fixed bed reactor applications.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Catalysis has played a major role in last few decades, in the development of environmentally benign processes with improved economics. However demands for new catalytic systems focus on their disposal aspects too. The catalysts for the manufacture of aniline are known as copper chromite in the market. The presence of chromium (hexavalent chromium) has been found to be toxic to living organisms and a cause for pollution problems in waste waters. It is now recognized as a human carcinogen. Therefore we have already initiated work in green chemistry by way of development of chromium free catalyst and achieving further improvements in the same.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Catalytic hydrogenation of nitro compounds, particularly nitrobenzene to aniline has been a widely studied and published area. The available literature can be classified into the following:<br>
&gt;  Nickel / Zirconium based catalysts (US Patent No. US 6140539, 6680280, Japanese Patent No. JP 33177060);<br>
2<br><br>
&gt;	Noble metal catalysts &amp; zeolite (US Patent No. US 6054617, 4265834, Europian Patent No. EP 458006, Chinese Patent No. CN 1861254 &amp; CN 1803761 and Indian Patent No. IN 190552);<br>
&gt;	Copper based catalysts with or without additives (US Patent No. US 6049008, Chinese Patent No. CN 1768941, 1768930, Russian Patent No. RU 221745, 2102138). Commercial copper chromite catalysts for aniline manufacture have been referred to in European Patent No. EP 301853 as well as other literature;<br>
&gt;	A recent Chinese Patent (CN 1367040) describes hydrogenation with CeC&gt;2 containing 2-16% copper, where the catalyst is prepared by precipitation of Cu and Ce salts with aqueous base solutions, followed by drying and cleaning.<br>
Our previous patent (IN 197777) revealed the development of a chrome free catalyst with high conversion of nitrobenzene in vapour phase (at about 150°C to 230°C) under the process conditions of commercial plants. The catalyst contains oxides of two elements of lanthanide series as promoter supported on a composite support comprising oxides of group II, Ml and IV elements in definite proportion.<br>
The catafyst of the present invention is a high pore-volume, high surface area catalyst, with optimized binder concentration, which exhibits very high conversion of nitrobenzene under the process condition of commercial plants and is highly selective for the conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline.<br>
Objective of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved hydrogenation catalyst for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline with high activity and selectivity. This is achieved by improvements in the surface area and pore volume of the catalyst by optimizing the ratio of copper to oxides of silicon and calcium.<br>
3<br><br>
Improvement in the copper surface area of the catalyst, which also has effect on the catalyst activity and selectivity, is achieved by optimizing the atomic ratio of copper to rare earth oxide.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to optimize the binder concentration in the catalyst with the required degree of strength to withstand the operating conditions, thus identifying the minimum required binder concentration, maintaining the desired level of porosity for the catalyst.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of transition metal catalyst for the conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline in the vapour phase in fixed bed reactors. According to this invention, the catalyst contains oxide of the said metal and is promoted with the oxide or oxides of one or two elements, preferably oxides of two elements of lanthanide series. In the practice of present invention, a combination of the oxides of two elements of the lanthanide series as promoters is preferred for better activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The said catalyst is supported on a composite support material comprising the oxides of Group IIA, IIIA and IVA elements in definite proportions.<br>
The aluminate of alkaline earth metal is used as a binder to impart proper mechanical strength to the catalyst particles. The shape of the catalyst particles of the present invention is cylindrical tablet of length 3 to 6 mm, preferably 4.7 to 5.2 mm and diameter 3 to 6 mm, preferably 4.7 to 5.2 mm.<br>
We herein disclose a process for the preparation of an environment friendly transition metal catalyst for low temperature conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline in the vapour phase, which catalyst contains oxide of the said metal which is promoted with the oxide or oxides of one or two elements, preferably oxides of two elements of the lanthanide series and is supported on a composite support<br>
4<br><br>
material comprising oxides of the Group IIA, IIIA and IV A elements, which is prepared by the process comprising the steps of:<br>
(i)       precipitating the said metal from its salt solution as metal hydroxyl<br>
carbonate on the said support containing the oxide(s) of lanthanide<br>
element(s) at about 50°C -100°C and aging the precipitated material at<br>
about 60°C -80°C; (ii)      cooling the precipitated material and washing the same with deionised<br>
water; (iii)      drying the washed material at about 120°C - 250°C; (iv)     calcining the dried material at about 300°C - 600°C, preferably at<br>
400°C - 500°C; (v)      mixing the calcined material with a suitable binder and a lubricant; (vi)     granulating the resulting material to about 12-100 mesh size; (vii)    tabletting the granulated material to catalyst particles of desired shape<br>
and size; (viii)    finally calcining the tabletted material at about 400°C    to 700°C,<br>
preferably at 450°C to 550°C to produce the finished product of desired<br>
higher mechanical strength.<br>
The transition metal salt used in the present invention is copper nitrate. The elements of the lanthanide series are lanthanum and cerium, the oxides of which are used in the mole ratio of 1:1. The Group IIA, IIIA and IVA elements are calcium, aluminium and silicon respectively. The composite support material contains oxides of the said elements having mole ratio of calcium oxide to alumina to silica of 2 to 4:1:2 to 5.<br>
The precipitation is carried out by adding metal nitrate solution to the solution of an alkali metal carbonate in the pH range of about 7 to 10 or by adding the solution of the alkali metal carbonate to metal nitrate solution in the pH range of about 2 to 7.<br>
5<br><br>
In the practice of this invention, sodium carbonate is used as the preferred alkali metal carbonate. The addition of copper nitrate solution to the alkali metal carbonate or vice versa at a controlled slow rate with vigorous agitation is carried out to ensure that the precipitate is not getting agglomerated.<br>
Copper nitrate solution is prepared by dissolving the said nitrate in deionised water. Copper solution which is taken for precipitation contains between 30 and 100 grams of copper per litre, preferably between 70 and 90 grams per litre. Sodium carbonate solution is prepared by dissolving the said salt in deionised water. Sodium carbonate solution used for precipitation contains about 50-250 grams per litre, preferably 100 - 200 grams per litre of the said carbonate.<br>
According to this invention, a mixture of copper nitrate solution and the said promoters is added to a well-agitated solution of the alkali metal containing the said support material. Alternatively, the alkali metal solution and the mixture of copper nitrate solution, the said promoters and support material, are simultaneously added to boiling water. The pH of the mixture during precipitation is maintained at about 6 to 8. The temperature is maintained in the range of about 50° to 100°C, preferably at 60°C - 80°C.<br>
The precipitation is carried out over a period of 2 to 5 hours. The precipitated material is aged for a period of about 1-3 hours to improve crystallinity. The aging is carried out in the temperature range of about 60°C to 80°C. The slurry is then cooled to about 30°C - 35°C. Since the precipitation is carried out with excess of alkali metal carbonate than the stoichiometric requirement, the precipitate is to be thoroughly washed with deionised water to remove the alkali metal ions. Even the trace amount of alkali metal present in the catalyst is likely to reduce the dispersion of active phase, which reduces the performance of the catalyst remarkably. Therefore, the aged precipitate is washed with dionised water for about 3 to 10 times by filtration and reslurrying of the precipitated mass<br>
6<br><br>
to remove the alkali metal ions. The washed precipitate, which contains metal hydroxy carbonate and promoters on the composite support material, is decomposed to give metal oxide on the support containing promoters. Drying and calcinations of the washed precipitate are carried out in a precisely controlled slow heating rate to achieve maximum dispersion of active phase on the support. Controlled drying and calcinations can also lead to product with high surface area.<br>
The washed precipitate is dried at about 120°C- 250°C for about 3 to 12 hours and calcined at a temperature of about 300°C to 600°C, preferably at 400°C -500°C for about 2 to 6 hours. The programmed heating is carried out at a controlled rate of about 30°C to 100°C per hour, preferably 40°C to 60°C per hour.<br>
The aluminate of an alkaline earth metal is used as a binder and graphite is used as the lubricant. In the practice of this invention, the preferred alkaline earth metal used is calcium. The calcined mass is mixed with the said binder and the lubricant, and is ball-milled. Then the sample is granulated to 12 - 100 mesh size. Finally, the granulated sample is tabletted to form the cylindrical particles. The tabletted material is calcined at a temperature of about 400°C - 700°C preferably at 450°C - 550°C for about 2 to 6 hours. The catalyst according to the present invention is characterized by the copper oxide content of about 40 to 65% by weight and relatively higher copper surface area compared to reference sample of this present invention. The atomic ratio of copper to lanthanum to cerium is from about 45:2:1 to about 176:2:1, preferably in the range of 60:2:1 to 120:2:1. Surface area of the catalyst prepared by the method of the present invention is about 50-180 m2/g, preferably 130-180 with a total pore volume of about 0.2 to 0.35 ml/g. The side crushing strength of the catalyst particle is about 5 to 20 kg, preferably 6 to 10 kg.<br>
7<br><br>
The most preferred embodiments of the present invention are compared with a reference catalyst indicated in patent No. IN 197777 which is illustrated as Example - I. In the present invention, alumina / silica and calcium oxide were varied in 3 different preparations in the mofe ratio 1:5:5, 1:10:10, 1:10:20 and 0:1:1. Increasing the ratio of oxides of calcium and silica results in improvement in surface area and pore volume. The most preferred embodiment containing alumina/silica and calcium oxide in the mole ratio 1:20:20 showed relatively higher surface area and pore volume and this preferred embodiment is illustrated as Example - II of the present invention.<br>
The comparison example given in this present invention contains rare earth oxide having atomic ratio of copper to lanthanum to cerium as 77:2:1. The quantity of lanthanum plus cerium in the preferred embodiment, Example - II of this invention was replaced with the same quantity of cerium alone; i.e. the same weight ratio of copper to rare earth oxide, in a separate catalyst preparation where in evaluation of copper surface area indicated comparable results for lanthanum plus ceria catalyst as well as ceria alone containing catalyst. Further, optimization of cerium content as indicated in Example - III was derived on the basis of evaluation of copper surface area for a series of catalysts varying the atomic ratio of copper to cerium as 30:1, 60:1 and 120:1 and among these three preparations, copper surface area was found to be 10% relatively higher for the catalyst having copper to cerium atomic ratio of 60:1.<br>
The addition of binder which is a combination of oxides of aluminium and calcium, in the mole ratio 5:3, imparts extra mechanical strength to the catalyst to withstand severe operating conditions. The pore volume is adversely affected by increased mechanical strength. Hence a compromise between these two conflicting parameters is essential for the improved performance of the catalyst and therefore optimization of binder concentration was carried out for the formulation of the most preferred embodiment as indicated in Example - III of the present invention, varying weight percentage of binder in the finished catalyst as<br>
8<br><br>
10%, 5% and 2.5%; strength improved with increase in binder concentration whereas pore volume decreased with increase in binder concentration, catalyst having 5% binder concentration exhibited the desired strength and pore volume as indicated in Example - IV of the present invention.<br>
The catalyst is evaluated in the fixed bed in a mild steel/stainless steel single tube reactor, which is heated electrically by using a vertical tube furnace in which the reactor is fixed coaxially. The temperature of the tube furnace is controlled properly by using an automatic temperature controller. Alternatively, the catalyst is evaluated in the fixed bed in mild steel/stainless steel multi-tubular reactor which consists of about 2000 to 3000 tubes, in contact with circulating hot oil through a vertical jacket in which the said reactor is fixed coaxially. The volume of the catalyst used for evaluation in the said reactor is about 30 to 1290 ml. A desired volume of the catalyst is charged in the said reactor and is reduced by passing a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen (with varying amounts of the latter from about 0.01 to 20% by volume) through the catalyst bed at a temperature of about 180°C - 220°C and a space velocity of about 1000 to 2200 hr'1 for about 8 to 168 hours. The catalyst is then evaluated in-situ by passing a mixture of nitrobenzene vapour and hydrogen through the catalyst bed at a temperature of about 140°C to 230°C, preferably at 150°C to 220°C and at a mole ratio (nitrobenzene : hydrogen) of 1:30 to 1:15, and a space velocity of about 1000-2100 hr"1. Nitrobenzene containing about 500-800 ppm of m-dinitrobenzene, produced by M/s Hindustan Organic Chemicals Limited, Rasayani has been used as feed stock for evaluation of the catalyst.<br>
Under the experimental condition employed, the catalyst of the present invention exhibits almost complete conversion of nitrobenzene which is indicated by the negligibly small amount of unreacted nitrobenzene (

composition, surface area, pore volume and mechanical strength (side crushing strength) are determined by known methods.<br>
Examples I to IV are given for the preparation of the catalyst, inclusive of the reference catalyst and Examples V to VIII are given for the evaluation of the catalyst for the conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline in the vapour phase.<br>
