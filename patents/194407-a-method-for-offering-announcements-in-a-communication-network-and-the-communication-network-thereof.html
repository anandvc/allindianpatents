Description<br>
This invention relates to a communication network for offering announcements in a communication network,<br>
Communication networks, tor example fixed networks of mobile networks of mobile wireless networks, for example structured according to the art of the known Global system for Mobile Communications, have, among others, cross linked (interlaced) switching devices. In the mobile wireless network base stations are connected in each case at the switching devices, with whose help communication send only device ( rado transmitter) are connected through an air interface. In the fixed network the communication send only devices are connected through cables with the switching devices. The communication send only devices render possible, therefore, for a telephone subscriber ( participant), independent of the nature of the network, the access to the network. The switching device can, besides that effect a transition to further networks, for example, data transmission networks, fixed networks or mobile wireless nelworks. in the GSM (global system) mobile wireless network storage points, in which, among others, subscriber ( participant) specific data are stored for networks own services, are used One of these storing points is the home register(index), which are existent at a rigidy defined place, as a rule, and in which the data taken as a basis for registration of the subscriber ( participant) are laid-in. Dependent on the temporary place of stay of the mobile subscriber at the least one further storage point, the visitor register is responsible. According to the place of stay of the mobile subscriber the aurthority, which the storage point with the specific data stored for this subscriber has to serve the subscriber, can change.<br><br>
2<br>
It is known in general, to assist additional services for the subscriber of a<br>
communication network- whether fixed network or mobile wireless network through<br>
the structure of an Intelligent Network with service control of point These service<br>
control points and the profiles of the additional services filed therein, inducing the<br>
information required for their realization, are therefore, independent of the respective <br>
communication network changeable.	<br>
Thereby the services useful in an intelligent network is imponged in a service ' switching point in order to effect and exit form the conventional call processing and to activate the access to the addtional services. One of the services there exists therein, to make available to the subscriber of the communication network on or several announcements in his possession. This is achieved thereby, that the announcements form the service switching point is impinged and is executed by an intelligent peripheral connected with it The control of the announcement takes place through a service control point through a INAP ( Intelligence Network Application Part)-signalling Disadvantageous at the method is, that all announcements in the Intelligent peripherals must be pre-defined, that means, before the announcements are to be received and the intelligent Peripherals are to be loaded This procedure is inflexible in respect of the putting in readness and bringing forth of new announcements since these  offline must be received( collected) and stored in the Intelligent Peripherals, before a utilization is possible. Besides that, an announcement indsntification, for example, with the help of an announcement call number for selection of the respective announcement puffing in readiness and to signalize. Between service controlling point and service switching point the corresponding announcement-identifications are to synchronise, in order to be able to utilize the new announcements.<br><br>
3<br>
It is known from " The CAMEL feature, proposed revisions to the stage 1 description", of ETSt/STC/SMGt. 14.03.95, GSM 02.78, version 0.4.0, pages 1-14, a CAMEL ( Customised Application for Mobile Network Enhanced logic) the platform, with which the assistance of additional giver specific services for the subscriber should be made possible, for example, also then, when they stay abroad Thereby through the network and service-borders of a communication network an operator specific additional service can be utilized This is the case, when the service switching points impinging the additional service for the demanded service, can<br>
process the required CAP signaling ( CAMEL application part) and through the<br><br>
network border signaling informations of and for home register and for service control point of the addtional service can be exchanged For the announcement this signifies, that during stay of a mobile subscriber in another network than the home network the announcements of all other networks there must be known and dstinctty indentifrable. This brings forth a high reconciliation efforts, which, besides that has to take place away from the network border and is similarly inflexible. A solution through "rerouting of the network, in which the subscriber himself stays, for his home network, in order to lay-in these announcements there, would lead to an addtional occupation of the lines and thereby require additional transmission resources.<br>
The Invention takes the problem as the basis, to indicate as far as possible a flexible method and a corresponding communication network for making available of the announcements for the subscriber. This problem is solved, according to the invention, in view of method through the features of the Patent Claim 1 and in respect of the communication network through the features of the patent claim no. 14. Beyond that a service controlling point with the features of the patent claim n.<br><br>
4<br>
11, a service switching point with the features of the patent claim no. 12 and an Intelligent Peripherals with the feature of the patent claim no. 13 are indicated Advantageous further developments of the invention are to be derived from the sub class.<br>
The method for making available of announcements, in accordance with the Invention, provides that one or several announcement texts in the service controlling point are arranged A message initiated on the ground of a call of the subscriber, in which informations on the supportability of annoluncements are contained through a Intelligent Peripherals is received and evaluated by the service controlling point During assistance of an announcement text is contained is sent out by the service controlling point From the Intelligent Peripherals a received announcement text is converted to an announcement, which than is transmitted on a speech canal for the calling subscriber.<br>
The advantage of the method , in accordance with the Invention, lies therein, that only the announcement texts are included in a service control point-which, as a rule, in arranged at central position and the announcements are laid-in only through conversion of the received announcement text by the Intelligent Peripherals. The central storage of announcement texts avoids an expensive aligriment of the announcements between the service control point and the service switching point rather Intelligent Peripherals through a corresponding signaling and renders possible a quick and flexible matching of the announcements with the new services and service expansions. The raised flexibility leads to a cost-saving, since the intelligent peripherals are no more to be loaded (changed) anewed during each change or inclusion of an announcement The putting in readiness of the announcements takes place also independent of the locality, without that the texts must be pro<br><br>
5<br>
defined in the respective intelligent peripherals earlier Thereby the expense for induction of new announcements is reduced substantially. The putting in readiness of the announcements according to the Customized Application for Mobile Network Enhanced Logic platform for a roaming" subscriber through network-boundary is substantially through the procedure, according to the invention, lower expense for signaling and line occupancy- is implementable. The announcements are made available to the subscriber ( participant) both in his own network as well as in a foreign network, for example, in foreign country, through simple conversion of the received announcement texts at the face. This has for him the advantage , that the announcements am brought to the centra ( centred) in a language intelligible to him-preferably in his native language.<br>
The method, in accordance with the Invention, can be applied on fixed network as well as mobile wireless network, in which to the railing subscriber the announcement controlled by a service control point and assisted thraugh an intelligent peripheral centered through a speed) channel. A further advantage of the method, in accordance with the invention, exists therein, the Informations through the supportabitity of announcements and the announcement text(s) can be transmitted in messages, which become part of the Intelligent Network Application Part -father CAP ( CAMAL Application Part) signaling This signifies, that no expense for addttiona! cables or signaling messages for the method in accordance with the invention, is required<br>
The communication network in accordance with the invention, distinguishes itself thereby, that one or several announcement texts are set-up in the service control point A message initiated on the ground of a call of the participant, in which information through the supportability of the announcement through an intelligent<br><br>
6<br>
peripheral are contained, is received and evaluated by the service control point in case of support (benefit) of an announcement trough an intelligent peripheral a message, in which the announcement text is contained, is sent-out by the service control point. From the intelligent peripheral a received announcement-text is converted to an announcement which then is transmitted on a speech channel to the subscriber calling (participant).<br>
A service control pint towards support of the Invention has a means for storage of one or several announcement texts as well as a means for storage and evaluation of a message initiated on the ground of a call of the subscriber, in which information on the supportability of announcements are contained throujji an intelligent peripheral. Besides that the service switching point with means for sendng-out of a message, in which the announcement text is contained, is provided for an intelligent peripheral supporting the announcement, from which the received announcement text is converted to an announcement which is then transmitted through a service switching point on a speech channel to the subscriber (participant) calling.<br>
A service switching point towards support (benefit) of the invention has means for the receipt of the message, in which the announcement text is contained, and a means for the sending out the announcement text to an intelligent peripheral supporting the announcement, from which then the received announcement text is converted to an announcement, which is transmitted through a service switching point on a speech channel to the subscriber (participant) calling.<br>
An intelligent peripheral towards supporting of the Invention has means for the receipt of the message, in which an announcement text is contained, and means for the conversion of the announcement text to an announcement , which   then is<br><br>

transmitted through a service switching point on a speech channel to the subscriber calling<br>
With the help of schematic representations the object of the Invention is explained in details in the accompanying drawings,<br>
There it shows;<br>
Fig 1  the block wining dagam of a communication network.<br>
Fig 2 a schematic representation of the flow of the message towards putting in readiness of the announcement with a service control point and with a setvice switching point.<br>
Fig. 3 a schematic representation of the flow of the messages towards putting in readiness of the announcement with a service control point and two service switching points, and<br>
Fig. 4 a schematic representation of a flow of messages over lapping network for the putting in readiness of announcements for a mobile subscriber not staying his native network.<br>
At the example of a mobile wireless network in accordance with Fig 1, which is drawn according to the global system for mobile communications standard, the communication network and the method, in accordance with the Invention, should be explained The invention is not limited to the mobile network but similarly applicable In the fixed networks. The communication network KN shows as usual several swiccrane oevices AWVUII wracn are connecreo wim one other. A switching device<br><br>
8<br>
MSCA/LR generates the connection to a mobile subscriber through a base station BS, which is connected with the switching device VLR/MSC, through cables and through an air-interface between the base station BS and a mobile station MS. The mobile station MS is the communication end device of a mobile subscriber A , which initiates in the examples described in the following a call to a target subsriber (MOC( Mobile Originated call). A further switching device- which is not represented have -builds the network ( power) transition to a further network for example a fixed network.<br>
Furthermore, the communication network KN contains the service control points SCP ( are designated in accordance with CAMEL phase 1 also as CSE-CAMEL service environment, please also Fig 4) and service switching points SSP, A-SSP towards support ( assistance) of the network structure of an intelligent network. The switching device MSCA/LR connected to the base station Bshas as sub-system the service switching point SSP, whereas the service switching point A-SSP is allocated to the other switching devices MSC/ VLR. In case of these connections it is not necessary, that each service control point SCP is connected directly with each switching devices MSCA/LR or service switching point SSP-ArSSP. It is sufficient, when these are achievable through the communication network KN or other networks trough a no. 7 signalling. In the present example there lies a sen/ice control point SCP in the communication network KN and is directly connected with the service switching points SSP and A-SSP through the Intelligent Network Application Part (INAP) signalling, whereas another service control point SCP is arranged in a visitor network VPLMN of the land -overlapping GSM-mobile wireless network and is cirectly jointed with the service switching point SSP through the CAP signaling, directly.<br><br>
9<br>
According to Fig No. 1 the intelligent peripherals IP, A-tP for laying-in of variable announcements for the subscriber of the communication network KN are connected to the service switching points SSP, A-SSP. These are controlled by the service control point SCP directty or through the respective service switching point SSP, A-SSP with the help of the Intelligent Network Application Part ((NAP) - scaling. At the least one storage point HLR is arranged in the communication network KN as home register of the mobile telephone subscriber ( participant) A and with both the switching devices MSCA/LR, demonstrated have as for example, jointed To the switching equipment MSCA/LR there a visitor regster VLR is allocated in each case, in which the mobile telephone subscriber Is registered for the duration of his stay in the feed ng range of this switching device. The communication of the home regster with the switching device MSCA/LR takes place mrough Mobile Application Part ( MAP) signaling<br>
Establishment of the connections outgoing from the mobile telephone subscriber A are at first processed in the switching device VLR/MSC, in whose feeding range the mobile telephone subscriber A is existing There to cause the interrogation of services- specially the additional services and the tenderer (giver) specific adcftional services. The storage points HLR VLR contain in-formation an adcftional services, which am useful for the telephone subscriber A, where information for the adtitiona! Sen/ices arrive through a " Location Update" to the Visitor regster VLR. These adcftional information are there allocated with subscriber data of a telephone subscriber, for example, in table form, to a telephone subscriber. For the present example there exists the service in the putting in readness of announcements for the calling mobile telephone subscriber A. The flexible and location-independent control and utilizations of the announcements should be explained with the help of the further figures.<br><br>
10<br>
The figures 2 to 4 show the basic constellations for the operating sequence of the method in accordance with the invention. In Fig 2 during a location update LUP telephone-subscriber-data from the home register HLR under use of the MAP protocols is transmitted to the visitor register VLR at the service switching point SSP. If the telephone subscriber A is registered for the outgoing discussion for addtional services, a participant (telephone subscriber)- information in this regard is additionally transmitted and stored in the visitor regster VLR. During introduction of an outgoing dscussion through the participant (telephone subscriber) A there takes place an assessment in this regard by the service switching point SSP.<br>
In the present oxample it relates to an outgoing caff IN-MOC of me participant ( subscriber) A, at which a connection ( call) clearing message reaches ( arrives) through the switching device competent for it for the service switching point SSP (1). The service switching point SSP possesses over the facilities for evaluation fo the message and for sending out of an initiating message (DP (Initial Detection Point) through the INAP ( Intelligence Network Application Part) protocol for the service control point SCP (2). In the message DP informations IPCA (Intelligent Peripheral Cpacaities) are contained, which indicate, which properties in respect of the announcement as for example speech (voice), speech range etc. exist in the intelligent peripheral IP having connection with the service switching point SSP. The information IPCA received in the service control point SCP in respect of the supportability of announcement are evaluated by an equipment SE, which, for example can take place with the help of a comparison with the requirements recorded in the table form. In case of adequate assistance the service control point SSP sends a message CTR ( connect to Resource) back, through the service<br><br>
11<br>
control of the intelligent peripheral IP of the service switching point SSP is scaled, with respect of the message CTR in the service switching point SSP the intelligent peripheral IP is immediately switched-on, symbolically represented in Fig. 2 through the sending of the message CTR to the intelligence peripheral IP (3).     <br>
The service control unit SCP possesses also equipment SP for storing of announcement texts; ANT, which, for example, are set-up in the form of ASCII texts. There further information LC for distinguishing colloquial linguistic properties of the announcement can be stored for the announcement texts ANT. Thus these information LC comprise one or severe! land codes for identification of the language (speed)} in which the announcement of the received announcement text has to take place throu^i the intelligence peripherals. The announcement texts ANT and the above mentioned information can be set-up,for example, through a superior control and management system ( Service Management Point or Operation and Maintenance Centre) thraugh signalling in the service control point SCP at central position. As soon as the announcement text(s) ANT are selected by the equipment SE in connection with the equipment SP, these are sent preferably with the information LC in a message PAP ( Play Announcement or Prompt and Collect, received by the service switching point SSP and be from there further transmitted to ^ intelligent peripherals (4). Alternative thereto, it is possibly to exchange the message PAP with the described information also directly between service control point SCP and intelligent peripherals IP.<br><br>
12<br>
The intelligent peripheral IP has an equipment TSC for conversion of the received announcement text ANT to an announcement ANN. This can, for example, take place though a Text Audio Transformer, which, if necessary, executes under consideration of the additionally received information LC the conversion of the text in speech. The announcements ANN generated in this manner is transmitted by the intelligent peripheral IP connected SPCH switched on in the switching device to the telephone subscriber A,<br>
The Fig 3 shows an easily averted constellation as opposed to Fig No. 2 , since a further service switching point A-SSP {Assisting Service Switching Point) is added The transmission of the message in accordance with the steps (1 and 2) is identical to Fig No. 2. In contrast to the described above there follows the monitoring of the information IPCA in the equipment SE of the service control point SCP, that no adequate assistance through the intelligent peripherals connected to the service switching point is given. Therefore, the service control point SCP sends a message ETC ( Establish Temporary Connection) with for construction of a transistory signal connection and speech connection through a service switching point suitable for support (assistance) of the announcements is requested This other service switching point is the service switching point A-SSP in the explained example, which is intimated through a routing address R &amp; D of the original service switching point SSP contained in the message ETC ( 2a). Besides that, the service switching point A-SSP is also to be looped in the speech channel connection to the participant (telephone subscriber). The selected service switching point A-SSP sends a message ARI ( Assisted Request Instruction) for service point SCP, in order to announce this to the communication partner for putting in readiness of the, announcement (2b),<br><br>
13<br>
As a result of that the service control point SCP sends the -inaccordance with the procedure in Fig. No. 2- the message CPR and PAP one after another, in which the announcement text ANT and the information LC are contained, to the now competent (responsible) service switching point A-SSP, which transmits further (3, 4) the received messages CTR and PAP, in each case, to the pertinent Intelligent Peripheral A-IP ( 3, 4). There follows the conversion of the received announcement text ANT In speech ( language) through the equipment TSC. The announcement ANN determined in this manner is transmitted (5) to the participant (subscriber) A by the intelligent peripheral A-IP through the speech channel SPCH, which is connected to the switching devices assigied to both the SSP service switching points A-SSP and SSP.<br>
The figure no. 4 describes the case, that the subscriber (participant) A stays not in his home network HPLMN , but in a foreign network, in the visitor network. According to the CAMEL platform si communication through the border of two networks HPLMN, VPLMN for dscussion format proceeds again from mobile participant (subscribe!) A through his communication send-only gadget The calf ( connection) clearance message reaches the competent switching device NSC of the foreign network VPLMN, current for him, in whose feeding range the mobile station of the participant is existent The service switching point SSP, assigned to the switching device MSC sends the message 1DP with information IPCA, which is transmitted in a<br><br>
14<br>
network overlapping manner through the CAP stalling or the service control point SCP with the equipment SE and SP, tn the same manner as described in Fig. 2 the messages CTR, PAP are generated subsequently with the announcement text ANT and the information LC and exchanged between the service control point SCP, the service switching point SSP' and a pertinent intelligent peripheral IP. In addition to the constellation of Fig. No. 2 there takes place the flow of message through the<br>
network border of both me networks HPLMN and VPLMN. An equipment TSC , for <br>
the   text-speedvconversion   in   the   intelligent   peripherals   IP'   delivers   the<br>
announcements ANN, which is looped in ( tuned) for the participant throng the service switching point on me speech channel SPCH connected to the switching device MSC in the visitor network VPLMN. In this manner it is possible to keep read/ for the roaming participants in the foreign networks the announcements in his native language or at least in a language intelligible to him in a flexible manner and without any ackftiona! stalling toad line occupancy.<br><br>
