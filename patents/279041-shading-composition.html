(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
SHADING COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
SHADING COMPOSITION<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the delivery of dyes to fabrics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many white garments are created from either pure cotton or polyester cotton blends. Polyester cotton blends typically contain greater than 60% polyester. To enhance whiteness shading dyes may be included in domestic wash products that deposit onto fabrics to counter-act yellowing and greying of the fabric. WO 2008/017570 (Unilever) discloses the use of acid azine dyes as shading agents for domestic wash product. Acid azine dyes carry negatively charges substituents making the net charge of the dye anionic.  Acid azine dyes deposit onto cotton but do not build up over multiple washes, preventing overblueing. Acid azine dyes deposit poorly to polyester-cotton blended garments and provide no deposition to polyester garments. The poor deposition on polycotton is thought to be due to the low cotton content of these garments. A shading system is required which give good deposition to polycotton, without unacceptably large deposition to cotton garment in the same wash.<br>
United States Patent 6,616,708, to Kao, discloses the use of cationic azine dyes in hair dye compositions.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/039042 discloses Basic Violet 5 and Basic Violet 6 for use in laundry detergent compositions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Selected cationic azine dyes have a high substantivity to polycotton whilst depositing well on cotton and are relatively alkaline stable and weight efficient.<br>
The cationic azine dyes described herein have the further advantage of being substantive to pure polyester garments.<br>
The cationic azine dyes described herein also have the advantage of providing good whiteness improvement to the fabric with little dulling of the fabric.<br>
The cationic azine dyes described herein have the further advantage of showing no-build up behaviour on a range of fabrics.<br>

(i)  treating a textile with an aqueous solution of the cationic azine dye, the aqueous solution comprising from 1 ppb to 1 ppm of the azine dye; and, from 0.0 g/L to 3 g/L of a surfactant; and,<br>
(ii) rinsing and drying the textile.<br>
It is preferred that the aqueous solution used in the method has a fluorescer present.<br>
 <br>
The method is particularly applicable to wash loads containing polyester cotton blend garments/textiles.<br>
The formulation may be liquid or granular.  The preferred format is that of a granular laundry treatment composition.<br>

 <br>
In granular formulation the cationic azine dye is preferably granulated with an acidic component to reduce hydrolysis on storage as discussed in WO2007/039042 (Unilever).<br>
For addition to granular formulation the dye may be added to the slurry to be spray dried or added via post-dosed granules.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the dye powder obtained from the dye synthesis is mixed with a Na2S04 or NaCl or pre-prepared granular base or full detergent formulation to give a 0.1 to 5 dye wt% mixture. This dry mixed is then mixed into the granular formulation. The dye powder is preferably formed by drying a liquid slurry or solution of the dye, for example by vacuum drying, freeze drying, drying in drum dryers, Spin Flash ® (Anhydro), but most preferably by spray drying. The dye powder may be ground before, during or after the making of the slurry. This grinding is preferably accomplished in mills, such as for example ball, swing, bead or sand mills, or in kneaders.<br>
Other ingredients such as dispersants or alkali metal salts may be added to the liquid slurry. The dye powder preferably contains 20 to 100 wt% of the dye.<br>

The acid azine dyes provide benefit predominately to the pure cotton garments and the cationic azine dyes to the polycotton garments.<br>
 <br>
Photobleaches such as sulphonated Zn/Al phthalocyanins may be present,<br>
SURFACTANT<br>
The composition comprises between 2 to 70 wt % of a surfactant, most preferably 10 to 30 wt %.  In general, the nonionic and anionic surfactants of the surfactant system may be chosen from the surfactants described "Surface Active Agents" Vol. 1, by Schwartz &amp; Perry, Interscience 1949, Vol. 2 by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch, Interscience 1958, in the current edition of "McCutcheon's Emulsifiers and Detergents" published by Manufacturing Confectioners Company or in "Tenside-Taschenbuch", H. Stache, 2nd Edn., Carl Hauser Verlag, 1981. Preferably the surfactants used are saturated.<br>
Suitable nonionic detergent compounds which may be used include, in particular, the reaction products of compounds having a hydrophobic group and a reactive hydrogen atom, for example, aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols with alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide either alone or with propylene oxide. Specific nonionic detergent compounds are C6 to C22 alkyl phenol-ethylene oxide condensates, generally 5 to 25 EO, i.e. 5 to 25 units of ethylene oxide per molecule, and the condensation products of aliphatic C8 to C18 primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, generally 5 to 40 EO.<br>
Suitable anionic detergent compounds which may be used are usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of organic sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl radicals containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term alkyl being<br>

Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds are sodium and potassium alkyl sulphates, especially those obtained by sulphating higher C8 to C18 alcohols, produced for example from tallow or coconut oil, sodium and potassium alkyl Cg to C20 benzene sulphonates, particularly sodium linear secondary alkyl C10 to C15 benzene sulphonates; and sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil and synthetic alcohols derived from petroleum. The preferred anionic detergent compounds are sodium C11 to C15 alkyl benzene sulphonates and sodium C12 to C18 alkyl sulphates. Also applicable are surfactants such as those described in EP-A-328 177 (Unilever), which show resistance to salting-out, the alkyl polyglycoside surfactants described in EP-A-070 074, and alkyl monoglycosides.<br>
Preferred surfactant systems are mixtures of anionic with nonionic detergent active materials, in particular the groups and examples of anionic and nonionic surfactants pointed out in EP-A-346 995 (Unilever). Especially preferred is surfactant system that is a mixture of an alkali metal salt of a C16 to C18 primary alcohol sulphate together with a C12 to C15 primary alcohol 3 to 7 EO ethoxylate.<br>
The nonionic detergent is preferably present in amounts greater than 10%, e.g. 25 to 90 wt % of the surfactant system. Anionic surfactants can be present for example in amounts in the range from about 5% to about 40 wt % of the surfactant system.<br>
 <br>

Example 1 comparison  of dulling properties<br>
Cotton and polycotton fabrics were washed in an aqueous wash solution {demineralised water)  containing lg/L Linear Alkyl benzene sulfonate, lg/L sodium carbonate and lg/L sodium chloride at a liquor to cloth ratio of 30:1. To the wash solution shading were added such that the optical density (5cm) at the maximum optical absorption in the range 400-750nm was 0.5 and 0.1. After 30 minutes of agitation the clothes were removed rinsed and dried. After the wash the reflectance spectra measured on a reflectometer and the colour expressed as CIE Lab values , and the whiteness expressed as the Ganz value.<br>
The total colour deposited on the cloth was expressed as the<br>
AE value:<br>
AE = [(Lc-Ld)2 + (ac-ad)2 + (bc-bd)2] °"5<br>
Where Lc, ac, and bc are the CIE Lab values of the control cloths washed without dye<br>
 <br>
And Ld, ad, and bd are the are the CIE Lab values of the cloths washed with dye.<br>
The increased in whiteness of the cloth was expressed as AGanz = Ganz(dye) - Ganz(control).<br>
For each dye the effect of whitening, verses dulling the cloth was measured using the ratio AGanz/AE; a higher value represents greater whiteness with less dulling. The results are given in the table below.<br>

Example 2 comparison  of deposition properties<br>
A model wash load was created containing cotton (woven, knitted and towelling), polycotton (50/50 woven, 65/35 woven, 65/35 knitted), knitted polyester, knitted nylon elastane and knitted cotton-elastane fabrics. The model wash<br>
 <br>
load was washed in 4g/L of a detergent which contained 15% Linear Alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS) surfactant, 30% Na2C03, 40% NaCl, remainder minors included calcite and fluorescer and moisture. Washes were conducted in 2 6° French Hard water at room temperature with a liquor to cloth ratio of 10:1, for 30 minutes. Following the wash the cloths were rinsed twice in water, dried, their reflectance spectrum measured on a reflectometer and the colour expressed as CIE L a b values.  The washes were then repeated until 5 washes had been accomplished.<br>
The experiment was repeated with the addition of the low dulling shading dyes of example 1, dyes 1, 3, 4 and 5. The dyes were dosed at 0.005wt% on formulation except dye 5 which was dosed at 0.002wt%. The average relative whitening effects (AGanz( polycottons)/ ∆Ganz(cottons) on the cotton and polycotton fabrics are given in the table below. Values closer to 1 indicate more even deposition on  cotton  and polycotton fabrics.<br>
