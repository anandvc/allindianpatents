				<td>Therapeutic Biaryl Derivatives<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a new class of chemical compounds and to their use<br>
in medicine. In particular, the invention relates to biaryl derivatives, methods for<br>
their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and their use<br>
as agonists at atypical beta-adrenoceptors (also known as beta-3-<br>
adrenoceptors);<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Atypical beta-adrenoceptors belong to the family of adrenoceptors which<br>
mediate the physiological actions of the hormones adrenaline and<br>
noradrenaiine Such receptors have been described for example by J R S Arch<br>
et. a/., Nature, 309, 163-165 (1984); C Wilson et. a/., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 100,<br>
309-319 (1984); L J Emorine et. a/.. Science. 245, 1118-1121 (1989); and A.<br>
Bianchetti et. al. Br. J. Pharmacol., 100, 831-839 (1990).<br>
Phenethanolamine derivatives having activity at atypical beta-adrenoceptors<br>
are disclosed in, for example, European Patent Applications EP-A-0455006 and<br>
EP-A-0543662.<br>
Sub-types of the adrenoceptors, a,-, a2-, b,-, b2- and b3-(atypical) can be<br>
identified on the basis of their pharmacological properties and physiological<br>
effects. Chemical agents which stimulate or block these receptors (but not b3)<br>
are widely used in clinical medicine. More recently, emphasis has been placed<br>
upon specific receptor selectivity in order to reduce side effects caused, in part,<br>
by interactions with other receptors.<br>
Atypical beta-adrenoceptors are known to occur in adipose tissue and the<br>
gastrointestinal tract. Atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonists have been found to<br>
be particularly useful as thermogenic anti-obesity agents and as anti-diabetic<br>
agents. Compounds having atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist activity have<br>
also Deen described as being useful in the treatment of hyperglycaemia as<br>
animal growth promoters, as blood platelet aggregation inhibitors, as positive<br>
inotropic agents and as antiatheroscierotic agents, and as being useful in the<br>
treatment of glaucoma.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Briefly, in one aspect, the invention therefore provides compounds of Formula<br>
(I) and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof:<br><br>

optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from the group<br>
consisting of halogen, hydroxy, C1-6alkoxy, C1-6alkyl, nitro, cyano,<br>
hydroxymethyl, trifluoromethyl, -NR6R6, and -NHSO2R6, where each R6 is<br>
independently hydrogen or C1-4alkyl;<br>

tetrazol-5-yl, halogen, trifluoromethyl, or C1-6alkoxy, or, when R4 and R5 are<br>
bonded to adjacent carbon atoms, R4 and R5 may, together with the carbon<br>
atoms to which they are bonded, form a fused 5 or 6 membered ring optionally<br>
containing one or two nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms; and<br>
Y is N or CH.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are of use in medical therapy.<br>

and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
As used herein, "a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" means a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or salt of such es,ter, which, upon<br>
administration to the recipient, is capable of Droviding (directly or indirectly) a<br>
cornpound of Formula (I) or an active metabolite or residue thereof. It will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds of Formula (I) may be<br>
modified to provide pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof at any of the<br>
functional groups in the compounds of Formula (I). Of particular interest as such<br>
derivatives are compounds modified at the carboxyl function, hydroxyl functions<br>
or at amino groups. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of the compounds of Formula (I) may<br>
be derivatised at more than one position.<br>
Preferred pharmaceuticaliy acceptable derivatives of the compounds of<br>
Formula (I) are pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.. Pharmaceuiically<br>
acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula (I) include those derived from<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acicjs and bases. Examples<br>
of suitable acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitf ic, perchloric,<br>
fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycollic, lactic, salicylic, succinic, toluene- p-<br>
sulphonic, tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulphonic, formic, benzoic, malonic,<br>
naphthalene-2-sulphonic and benzenesulphonic acids. Other acids such as<br>
oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable may be useful in the<br>
preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining compounds of the<br>
invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.<br>
Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g. sodium), alkaline<br>
earth metal (e.g. magnesium), ammonium and NR4+ (where R is C^alkyl) salts.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) act as aaonists at at/Dical beta -adrenoceDtors<br>
and as such are useful in the treatment of clinical conditions susceptible to<br>
amelioration by administration of an atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist. Such<br>
conditions include hypergiycaemia, obesjty, nypenipemia, irrnapje Dowel<br>
syndrome and its associated pain, motilitv dysfunction, excessive<br>
gastrointestinal secretion, non-specific diarrhea, neurogenic inflammation,<br>
regulation of intraocular pressure, trigiyceridemia, diabetes, e.g. non-insulin-<br>
dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM or Type 2), such as obese NIDDM and<br>
non-obese NIDDM, diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy,<br>
neuropathy, cataracts, coronary heart diseases and arteriosclerosis,<br>
osteoporosis; and gastrointestinal disorders, particularly inflammatory<br>
gastrointestinal disorders. They are also of use in increasing the high-density-<br>
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration and decreasing the triglyceride<br>
concentration in blood serum, especially human blood serum, and are therefore<br>
of potential use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of atherosclerosis. They<br>
also may be useful for the treatment of hyperinsuiinaemia, depression, muscle<br>
wasting, and urinary incontinence. They may also be useful in the preparation<br>
of wound-healing medecines. References in this specification to treatment,<br>
include prophylactic treatment as well as the alleviation of symptoms.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound of general<br>
Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, for the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a condition susceptible of<br>
amelioration by an atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist.<br>
While it is possible that, for use in therapy, a compound of the invention may<br>
be administered as the raw chemical it is ^referable to dresent the active<br>
ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation. The invention thus further provides<br>
a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of Formula <l or a></l>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof together with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and, optionally, other therapeutic<br>
and/or prophylactic ingredients. The carriers) or excipient(s) must be<br>
"acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the<br>
formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
The compounds for use according to the present invention may be formulated<br>
for oral, buccal, oarenteral, rectal or transdermal administration or in a form<br>
suitable tor administration by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth<br>
or the nose).<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form<br>
of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g.<br>
pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc or silica);<br>
disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch gtycollate); or wetting agents<br>
(e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well<br>
known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form<br>
of, for exampleT solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as<br>
a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use.<br>
Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol<br>
syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents<br>
(e.g. lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g. almond oil, oily esters, ethyl<br>
alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl-<br>
p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer<br>
salts, flavoring, coloring and sweetening agents as appropriate. Preparations<br>
for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of<br>
the active compound.<br>
F6r buccal administration the compositions may take the form of tablets or<br>
lozenges formulated in conventional manner.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may be formulated for<br>
parenteral administration by injection e.g. by bolus injection or continuous<br>
(nfusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in<br>
ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The<br>
compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in<br>
oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as<br>
suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active<br>
ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g.<br>
sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may also be formulated in<br>
rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing<br>
conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also<br>
be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be<br>
administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously, transcutaneousiy or<br>
intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the<br>
compounds according to the present invention may be formulated with suitable<br>
polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an<br>
acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for<br>
example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
Suitable therapeutic ingredients which may be formulated with compounds of<br>
the invention, together with one or more pharmaceutical carriers or excipients,<br>
include ingredients which may be used in the same clinical conditions as those<br>
listed herein for atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonists. Such ingredients may<br>
include, for example, PPAR-gamma agonists.<br>
A proposed dose of the compounds according to the present invention for<br>
administration to a human (of approximately 70kg body weight) is O.img to 1g,<br>
preferably to 1mq to 100ma of the active ingredient per unit dose, expressed as<br>
the weight of free base. The unit dose may be administered, for example, 1 to 4<br>
times per day. The dose will depend on the route of administration, ft will be<br>
appreciated that it may be necessary to make routine variations to the dosage<br>
depending on the age and weight of the patient as well as the seventy of the<br>
condition to be treated. The precise dose and route of administration will<br>
ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared by any of the processes<br>
known in the art for the preparation of similar compounds. For example,<br>
according to a first process (A), compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared<br>
from of a compound or formula (II):<br><br>
where.P1 and P2 are suitable protecting groups for oxygen-and nitrogen groups<br>
respectively, by deprotection of P1 and p2 under suitable conditions such as<br>
treatment with an acid, e.g. aqueous hydrochloric acid in a suitable solvent such<br>
as dioxane.<br>
As a further process (B), compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared from<br>
other compounds of Formula (I). For instance, a compound of Formula (I) where<br>
R3 is CO2H may be prepared from a corresponding ester by hydrolysis, e.g.<br>
base hydrolysis with a reagent such as lithium hydroxide in a solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Compounds of Formula (II) where X = NH may be prepared by reaction of a<br>
compound of Formula (III) with a compound of Formula (IV):<br>
where P1 and P2 are suitable protecting groups for oxygen and nitrogen groups<br>
respectively.<br>
Compounds of Formula (II) where R3 is tetrazol-5-yl may be prepared from<br>
compounds of Formula (II) where R3 is cyano, by treatment with, for example,<br>
trimethylsily! azide in a solvent such as toluene.<br>
As a yet further process (C), the preparation of compounds or Formula (II),<br>
as defined above, followed by step (A) may be combined without purification of<br>
intermediate products.<br>
Compounds of Formula (III) are described in WO95/33724 or may be<br>

Formula (IV) are well known and include, but are not limited to, treatment of a<br>
compound of Formula (V) with tin(ll) chloride in a suitable solvent such as ethyl<br>
acetate or stirring under a hydrogen atmosphere in a suitable solvent such as.<br>
tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as palladium(O) on<br>
carbon.<br>
Compounds of Formula (V) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of<br>
Formula (VI) with a compound of Formula (VII) according to the method of<br>
Thompson, (J.Org. Chem. 1984, 49, 5237) where Z is halogen or triflate.<br><br>
According to another process (D), compounds of Formula (I) may be<br>
prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula (VIII) with a compound of<br>
Formula (IX) in a suitable solvent such as methyl sulfoxide.<br><br>

Suitable reducing agents of use in the reactions include hydrogen in the<br>
presence of a catalyst, such as a noble metal catalyst, for example palladium,<br>
platinum or platinum oxide, Raney-nickel or hydride reducing agents such as<br>
borohydrides, for example sodium borohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride or<br>
sodium cyanoborohydride Suitable reaction conditions will be readily apparent<br>
to those skilled in the art and are further illustrated by the accompanying<br>
examples.<br>
The protecting groups used in the preparation of compounds of Formula (I)<br>
may be used in conventional manner. See, for example, "Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Chemistry", Ed. J. F. W. McOmie (Plenum Press 1973) or "Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis", by Theodora W Greene and P M G Wuts (John<br>
Wiley and Sons 1991).<br>
Conventional amino protecting groups may include for example aralkyl<br>
groups, such, as benzyl, diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl groups; and acyl<br>
groups such as N-benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl.<br>
Conventional oxygen protecting groups may include for example alky silyl<br>
groups, such as trimethylsilyl, or tert-butyldimethylsilyl; alkylethers such as<br>
tetrahydropyranyl, or tert-butyl; or esters such as acetate.<br>
Removal of any protecting groups present may be achieved by conventional<br>
procedures.<br>
Atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonists are compounds which demonstrate a<br>
pharmacological response mediated at atypical beta-adrenoceptors. This<br>
activity has been measured as the ability to stimulate lipolysis by rat adipocytes<br>
at sub-micromolar concentrations, in a response that is resistant to blockade by<br>
standard beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs such as propranolol.<br>
Another useful means of identifying an atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist<br>
involves the measurement of agonist activity at atypical beta-adrenoceptors in<br>
the rat isolated lower oesophagus. Typically in this assay, a compound of<br>
general Formula (I) for use according to the present invention has an equipotent<br>
molar ratio (EPMR) relative to isoprenaline of less than 30. The rat oesophagus<br>
assay is based upon that described by Ford et ai, Br. J. Pharmacol.,<br>
105(suppl.), 235P, 1992. The relative potency of each test compound (EPMR) is<br>
compared to isoprenaline as follows:<br><br>
wherein EC50 is the molar concentration of agonist which produces 50% of the<br>
maximum possible response for that agonist<br>
A particularly useful method for determining agonist activity at human atypical<br>
beta-adrenoceptors involves the use of Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells<br>
transfected with the human beta-3-adrehoceptor according to Method 1. The<br>
cell lines may also be transfected with human beta-1- and beta-2- adrenoceptor<br>
in a similar njianner to provide a method of determining the selectivity of the<br>
compounds of the invention at the three receptors.<br>
Method 1 - Cell culture<br>
General cell culture guidelines are observed (Fershney, R.A. (1987) Culture<br>
of animal cells: A manual of basic technique. Wiley-Liss, Inc., N.Y.). A standard<br>
cell culture incubator is used (37°C, 5% C02in air, 95% relative humidity). H<br>
b3CHO cells are grown in DMEM/F12 (with pyroxidine-HCI, 15 mM HEPES, L-<br>
glutamine), supplanted with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 500 jag/ml G418, 2 mM<br>
L-glutamine, 100 units penicillin G and 100 mg streptomycin sulfate. One<br>
confluent flask of cells is trypsinised and resuspended in the above medium at a<br>
concentration of 30-40,000 cells/100 ml and plated into 96-well flat bottom<br>
plates. The ceils are then used for assay within 18-24 hours.<br>
The medium is aspirated from each well, and replaced with 180 ml DMEM/F12<br>
with 500 mM IBMX. Antagonists, if required, are added at this stage. The plate<br>
is then placed back in the incubator for 30 min. Drugs are then added to the<br>
welis (20 ul, 100x required final concentration) for 60 min. Responses were<br>
determined by measuring cAMP levels of a 20 ul sample of extracellular media<br>
using a scintillation proximity based radio-immunoassay (NEN Flashplates).<br>
CHO-6CRE-luciferase cell lines which stably express h(J3 receptors are<br>
seeded at 30,000 cells/well for 24 hr in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS. Media<br>
is removed from the cells and replaced with DMEM/F12 buffer (180 \i\)<br>
containing 300 mM IBMX and 1 mM ascorbic acid for 30 min prior to addition of<br>
compound. Vehicle or agonist (20 ml) is added and incubated at 37°C for 60<br>
minutes. At the end of the incubation period, samples of extracellular media<br>
are removed for direct assay in cAMP Flashpiates (NEN).<br>
As used herein, a compound is considered to be an agonist for hp3 if the<br>
compound stimulates the accumulation of extracellular cAMP with CHO-6CRE-<br>
luciferase cells expressing hp3. Preferably, the compounds of this invention<br>
have an EC50 of at most 100 nM at hp3. More preferably, the compounds of this<br>
invention have an EC50 of at most 1 nM at hp3. The relative potency of a hp3<br>
agonist may be compared to its potency for stimulating the accumulation of<br>
extracellular cAMP with CHO-6CRE-!uciferase cells expressing hp2 and hb1,<br>
Preferably, the compounds of this invention are at least 100 times more potent<br>
at hp3 than at hp2 or hp,. More preferably, the compounds of this invention are<br>
at least 300 times more potent at hp3 than at hb2 or hb, The compounds of<br>
Examples 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 have an EC50of<br>
at most 100 nM at hb3 and are at least 100 times more potent at hb3 than at hb2<br>
or hb,. Examples 10, 13. 16, 20, and 24 have an EC50 of at most 1 nM and are<br>
greater than 300-fold selective at hp2 and hb1<br>

(Synthesis 1990, 575). Defatted almond meal (18.0 g, Sigma) was wetted with<br>
aqueous citrate buffer (45 mL, 0.018 M, pH 5.5). After 15 min, isopropyl ether<br>
(405 mL) was added to the moist solid, followed by 3,5-dichlorobenzaldehyde<br>
(16.07 g) and acetone cyanohydrin (24.90 mL). The mixture was then shaken at<br>
400 rpm in a sealed flask at room temperature for 24 h. The mixture was filtered,<br>
and the almond meal was extracted with ethyl acetate. The extracts were<br>
combined with the filtrate, and concentrated to a yellow oil, which was dissolved<br>
in concentrated hydrochloric acid (27 mL). The solution was stirred at 75 °C for 4<br>
h. The resulting thick white slurry was cooled, diluted with water (100 mL), and<br>
extracted with ether. The ether extracts were in turn extracted with 1 M aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide solution. Acidification of the basic extracts to pH 1 (pH paper)<br>
by the dropwise addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid caused an oil to<br>
separate out of the aqueous phase. This mixture was then extracted with ether.<br>

Glycine methyl ester hydrochloride (7.87 g) was added to a solution of crude<br>
(R)-2-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy-2-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)ethanal (13.36 g) in<br>
dichloromethane (200 mL) under nitrogen. Triethylamine (8.74 mL) was then<br>
added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min. Sodium<br>
triacetoxyborohydride (17.71 g) was added, and the yellow mixture was stirred<br>
at room temperature for 22 h. The reaction mixture was then diluted with a<br>
saturated aqueous solution of Rochelle's salt (75 mL). The two layers were<br>
separated, and the cloudy aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane<br>
(70 mL). The extract was combined with the organic layer, washed with<br>
saturated aqueous sodium chloride (75 mL), dried (magnesium sulfate), and<br>
concentrated under vacuum to afford a yellow oil (17.10 g).<br>
Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (10.56 mL) was added to the yellow oil, and the<br>
resulting solution was heated at 95 8C under nitrogen for 1 h. The solution was<br>
cooled to room temperature, and chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with<br>
hexane. A colorless oil was obtained (14.221 g) that consisted of the desired<br>
product and ca. 30% (ft)-2-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy-2-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-1-<br>
ethanol. In order to remove the alcohol, tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (2.11 g)<br>
and imidazole (953 mg) were added to a solution of the oil (14.221 g) in<br>
acetonitrile (60 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred under nitrogen for 2 h.<br>
Volatiles were then removed under vacuum, and the residue was<br>
chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:0 to 10:1). In<br>
this manner, a sample of the title compound was obtained containing 4% (R)-2-<br>

controlled-release pellets with 50mg/capsule of an enteric polymer such as<br>
cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthaiate, or anionic polymers of methacrylic acid<br>
and methacrylic acid methyl ester (Eudragit L). Except for Eudragit L, these<br>
polymers should also include 10% (by weight of the quantity of polymer used) of<br>
a plasticizer to prevent membrane cracking during application or on storage.<br>
Suitable plasticizers include diethyl phthalate, tributyl citrate and triacetin.<br>
Intravenous injection composition<br>
Active ingredient 0.200g<br>
Sterile, pyrogen-free phosphate buffer (pH 9.0) to 10 ml<br>
The active ingredient is dissolved in most of the phosphate buffer at 35-40°C,<br>
then made up to volume and filtered through a sterile micropore filter into sterile<br>
10 ml glass vials (Type 1) which are sealed with sterile closures and overseals.<br>
Intramuscular injection composition<br>
The active ingredient is dissolved in the glycofurol. The benzyl alcohol is then<br>
added and dissolved, and water added to 3 ml. The mixture is then filtered<br>
through a sterile micropore filter and sealed in sterile 3 ml glass vials (Type 1).<br>
The sodium benzoate is dissolved in a portion of the purified water and the<br>
sorbitol solution added. The active ingredient is added and dissolved. The<br>
resulting solution is mixed with the glycerol and then made up to the required<br>
volume with the purified water.<br>
One-fifth of the Witepsol H15 is melted in a steam-jacketed pan at 45°C<br>
maximum. The active ingredient is sifted through a 200lm sieve and added to<br>
the molten base with mixing, using a Silverson fitted with a cutting head, until a<br>
smooth dispersion is achieved. Maintaining the mixture at 45°C, the remaining<br>
Witepsol H15 is added to the suspension which is stirred to ensure a<br>
homogenous mix. The entire suspension is then passed through a 250lm<br>
stainless steel screen and, with continuous stirring, allowed to cool to 40°C. At<br>
a temperature of 38-40°C, 2.02g aliquots of the mixture are filled into suitable<br>
plastic moulds and the suppositories allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
The above ingredients are mixed directly and pessaries prepared by<br>
compression of the resulting mixture.<br>
The active ingredient and alcohol USP are gelled with hydroxyethyl cellulose<br>
and packed in a transdermal device with a surface area of 10 cm .<br>
