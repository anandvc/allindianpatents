Salts of avermectins substituted in the 4"-position and having pesticidal properties<br><br>
wherein<br>
X'      is an anion;<br>
n        is 1, 2, 3 or 4;<br>
R1      is C1-C12alkyI, C3-C8cycloalkyl; or C2-C12alkGnyl;<br>

R3     is hydrogen, unsubstituted or mono- to penta-substituted C1-C12alkyl, unsubstituted or mono- to penta-substituted C3-C12cycloalkyl, unsubstituted or mono- to penta-substituted C2-C12alkenyl; unsubstituted or mono- to penta-substituted C2-C12alkynyl; or<br>
R2 and R3 together are a three- to seven-membered alkylene bridge, or a four- to seven-membered alkenylene bridge wherein a -CH2- group may have been replaced by O, S or NR4;<br>
and wherein the substituents of the mentioned alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkylene, alkenylene and cycloalkyl radicals are selected from the group consisting of OH, halogen, halo-CrC2alkyl, CN, NO2, C2-C6alkynyl, C3-C8cycioalkyl, norbornyjenyl, Ca-Cscycloalkenyl; C3-C8cycJoalkenyl unsubstituted or substituted by from one to three methyl groups;<br><br><br><br>
and, where applicable, to E/Z isomers, E/Z isomeric mixtures and/or tautomers;<br>
with the proviso that R1 is not sec-butyl or isopropyl when R2 is H and R3 is methyl;<br>
to a process for the preparation of those compounds and their isomers and tautomers and to the use thereof; to pesticidal compositions in which the active ingredient has been selected from those compounds and their tautomers; and to a method of controlling pests using those compositions.<br>
Certain macrolide compounds are proposed for pest control in the literature, for example in USP-4 427 663. The biological properties of those known compounds are not entirely satisfactory, however, for which reason there is a need to provide further compounds having pesticidal properties, especially for the control of insects and members of the order Acarina. That problem is solved according to the invention by the provision of the present compounds of formula (I).<br>
The compounds claimed according to the invention are derivatives of avermectin. Avermectins are known to the person skilled in the art. They are a group of structurally closely related pestidically active compounds which are obtained by fermentation of a strain of the microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis. Derivatives of avermectins can be obtained via conventional chemical syntheses.<br>
The avermectins obtainable from Streptomyces avermitilis are designated A1a, A1b, A2a, A2b, B1a. B1b. B2a and B2b. Compounds with the designation "A" have a methoxy radical in the 5-position; those compounds designated "B" have an OH group. The "a" series comprises compounds wherein the substituent R1 (in position 25) is a sec-butyl radical; the "b" series have an isopropyl radical in the 25-position. The number 1 in the name of a compound indicates that atoms 22 and 23 are bonded by a double bond; the number 2 indicates that they are bonded by a single bond and carbon atom 23 carries an OH group. The above designations are retained in the present Application in order in the case of the non-natural avermectin derivatives according to the invention to indicate the specific structural type, which corresponds to natural avermectin. There are claimed according to the invention salts of compounds of the B1 series, more especially mixtures of salts of avermectin derivatives B1a and B1b.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) may be in the form of one of the possible isomers or in the form of a mixture thereof, in the form of pure isomers or in the form of an isomeric mixture, i.e. in the form of a racemic mixture; the invention relates both to the pure isomers and to the racemic mixtures and is to be interpreted accordingly hereinabove and herein-below, even if stereochemical details are not mentioned specifically in every case.<br>
The racemates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, for example by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent, by chromatography on chiral adsorbents, for example high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on acetylcellulose, with the aid of suitable microorganisms, by cleavage with specific, immobilised enzymes, or via the formation of inclusion compounds, for example using chiral crown ethers, only one isomer being complexed.<br>
Apart from by separation of corresponding mixtures of isomers, pure optical isomers can be obtained according to the invention also by generally known methods of enantio-<br><br>
selective synthesis, for example by carrying out the process according to the invention using starting materials having correspondingly suitable stereochemistry.<br>
In each case it is advantageous to isolate or synthesise the biologically more active isomer, where the individual components have different biological activity.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be obtained in the form of their hydrates and/or may include other solvents, for example solvents v\/hich may have been used for the crystallisation of compounds in solid form.<br>
The invention relates to all those embodiments of the process according to which a compound obtainable as starting material or intermediate at any stage of the process is used as starting material and some or all of the remaining steps are carried out or a starting material is used in the form of a derivative or salt and/or its racemates or antipodes or, especially, is formed under the reaction conditions.<br>
In the processes of the present invention it is preferable to use those starting materials and intermediates which result in the compounds of formula (I) that are especially preferred.<br>
The invention relates especially to the preparation processes described in Examples P1.1 toP5.5.<br>
In the area of pest control, the compounds of formula (1) according to the invention are active ingredients exhibiting valuable preventive and/or curative activity with a very advantageous biocidal spectrum and a very broad spectrum, even at low rates of concentration, while being well tolerated by warm-blooded animals, fish and plants. They are, surprisingly, equally suitable for controlling both plant pests and ecto- and endo-parasites in humans and more especially in productive livestock, domestic animals and pets. They are effective against all or individual development stages of normally sensitive animal pests, but also of resistant animal pests, such as insects and representatives of the order Acarina, nematodes, cestodes and trematodes, while at the same time protecting useful organisms. The insecticidal or acaricidal activity of the active ingredients according to the invention may manifest itself directly, i.e. in the mortality of the pests, which occurs immediately or only after some time, for example during moulting, or indirectly, for example in reduced ovi-position and/or hatching rate, good activity corresponding to a mortality of at least 50 to 60 %.<br>
The action of the compounds according to the invention and the compositions comprising them against animal pests can be significantly broadened and adapted to the<br><br>
given circumstances by the addition of other insecticides, acaricides or nematicides.

It is also possible to control pests of the class Nematoda using the compounds according to the invention. Such pests include, for example,<br>
root knot nematodes, cyst-forming nematodes and also stem and leaf nematodes;<br>
especially of Heterodera spp., e.g. Heterodera schachtii, Heterodora avenae and Heterodora trifolii; Globodera spp., e.g. Globodera rostochiensis; Meloidogyne spp., e.g. Meloidogyne incognita and Meloidogyne javanica; Radopholus spp., e.g. Radopholus simiis; Pratylenchus, e.g. Pratyienchus neglectans and Pratylenchus penetrans; Tylenchulus, e.g. Tylenchulus semipenetrans; Longidorus, Trichodorus, Xiphinema, Ditylenchus, Apheenchoides and Anguina; insbesondere Meloidogyne, e.g. Meloidogyne incognita, and Heterodera. e.g. Heterodera glycines.<br>
An especially important aspect of the present invention is the use of the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention in the protection of plants against parasitic feeding pests.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used to control, i.e. to inhibit or destroy, pests of the mentioned type occurring on plants, especially on useful plants and ornamentals in agriculture, in horticulture and in forestry, or on parts of such plants, such as the fruits, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers or roots, while in some cases plant parts that grow later are still protected against those pests.<br>
Target crops include especially cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize and sorghum; beet, such as sugar beet and fodder beet; fruit, e.g. pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit, such as apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries and berries, e.g. strawberries, raspberries and blackberries; leguminous plants, such as beans, lentils, peas and-soybeans; oil plants, such as rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil,<br><br>
cocoa and groundnuts; cucurbitaceae, such as marrows, cucumbers and melons; fibre plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp and jute; citrus fruits, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruit and mandarins; vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes and paprika; lauraceae, such as avocado, cinnamon and camphor; and tobacco, nuts, coffee, aubergines, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas, natural rubber plants and ornamentals.<br>
Further areas of use of the compounds according to the invention are the protection of stored goods and storerooms and the protection of raw materials, and also in the hygiene sector, especially the protection of domestic animals and productive livestock against pests of the mentioned type, more especially the protection of domestic animals, especially cats and dogs, from attack by fleas, ticks and nematodes.<br>
The invention therefore relates also to pesticidal compositions, such as emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, spreadable pastes, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dispersible powders, wettable powders, dusts, granules and encapsulations of polymer substances, that comprise at least one of the compounds according to the invention, the choice of formulation being made in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
The active ingredient is used in those compositions in pure form, a solid active ingredient, for example, in a specific particle size, or preferably together with at least one of the adjuvants customary in formulation technology, such as extenders, e.g. solvents or solid carriers, or surface-active compounds (surfactants). In the area of parasite control in humans, domestic animals, productive livestock and pets it will be self-evident that only physiologically tolerable additives are used.<br>
As formulation adjuvants there are used, for example, solid carriers, solvents, stabilisers, "slow release" adjuvants, colourings and optionally surface-active substances (surfactants). Suitable carriers and adjuvants include all substances customarily used. As adjuvants, such as solvents, solid carriers, surface-active compounds, non-ionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, anionic surfactants and further adjuvants in the compositions used according to the invention, there come into consideration, for example, those described in EP-A-736 252, page 7, line 51 to page 8, line 39.<br>
The compositions for use in crop protection and in humans, domestic animals and productive livestock generally comprise from 0.1 to 99 %, especially from 0.1 to 95 %, of active ingredient and from 1 to 99.9 %, especially from 5 to 99.9 %, of at least one solid or<br><br>
liquid adjuvant, the composition generally including from 0 to 25 %, especially from 0.1 to 20 %, of surfactants (% = % by weight in each case). Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations having considerably lower concentrations of active ingredient.<br>
Preferred crop protection products have especially the following compositions (% = percent by weight):<br><br>
Emulsifiable concentrates: active ingredient: surfactant: solvent:<br>
Dusts:<br>
active ingredient:<br>
solid carrier:<br>
Suspension concentrates: active ingredient: water: surfactant:<br>
Wettable powders: active ingredient: surfactant: solid carrier:<br>
Granules: active ingredient: solid carrier:<br><br>
1 to 90%, preferably 5 to 20% 1 to 30%, preferably 10 to 20% 5 to 98%, preferably 70 to 85%<br>
0.1 to 10%, preferably 0.1 to 1% 99.9 to 90%, preferably 99.9 to 99%<br>
5 to 75%, preferably 10 to 50% 94 to 24%, preferably 88 to 30% 1 to 40%, preferably 2 to 30%<br>
0.5 to 90%, preferably 1 to 80% 0.5 to 20%, preferably 1 to 15% 5 to 99%, preferably 15 to 98%<br>
0.5 to 30%, preferably 3 to 15% 99.5 to 70%, preferably 97 to 85%<br><br>
The compositions according to the invention may also comprise further solid or liquid adjuvants, such as stabilisers, e.g. vegetable oils or epoxidised vegetable oils (e.g. epoxidised coconut oil, rapeseed oil or soybean oil), antifoams, e.g. silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders and/or tackifiers as well as fertilisers or other active ingredients for obtaining special effects, e.g. acaricides, bactericides, fungicides, nema-ticides, molluscicides or selective herbicides.<br><br>
The crop protection products according to the invention are prepared in known manner, in the absence of adjuvants, e.g. by grinding, sieving and/or compressing a solid active ingredient or mixture of active ingredients, for example to a certain particle size, and in the presence of at least one adjuvant, for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredient or mixture of active ingredients with the adjuvant(s). The invention relates likewise to those processes for the preparation of the compositions according to the invention and to the use of the compounds of formula (I) in the preparation of those compositions.<br>
The invention relates also to the methods of application of the crop protection products, i.e. the methods of controlling pests of the mentioned type, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, coating, dressing, scattering or pouring, which are selected in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances, and to the use of the compositions for controlling pests of the mentioned type. Typical rates of concentration are from 0.1 to 1000 ppm, preferably from 0.1 to 500 ppm, of active ingredient. The rates of application per hectare are generally from 1 to 2000 g of active ingredient per hectare, especially from 10 to 1000 g/ha, preferably from 20 to 600 g/ha.<br>
A preferred method of application in the area of crop protection is application to the foliage of the plants (foliar application); the frequency and the rate of application being dependent upon the risk of infestation by the pest in question. However, the active ingredient can also penetrate the plants through the roots (systemic action) when the locus of the plants is impregnated with a liquid formulation or when the active ingredient is incorporated in solid form into the locus of the plants, for example into the soil, e.g. in granular form (soil application). In the case of paddy rice crops, such granules may be applied in metered amounts to the flooded rice field.<br>
The crop protection products according to the invention are also suitable for protecting plant propagation material, e.g. seed, such as fruits, tubers or grains, or plant cuttings, against animal pests. The propagation material can be treated with the composition before planting: seed, for example, can be dressed before being sown. The active ingredients according to the invention can also be applied to grains (coating), either by impregnating the seeds in a liquid formulation or by coating them with a solid formulation. The composition can also be applied to the planting site when the propagation material is being planted, for example to the seed furrow during sowing. The invention relates also to such methods of treating plant propagation material and to the plant propagation material so treated.<br><br>

Biological Examples:<br>
Exannple B1: Action against Spodoptera littoralis<br>
Young soybean plants are sprayed with an aqueous emulsion spray mixture comprising 12.5 ppm of test compound and, after the spray-coating has dried, the plants are populated with 10 caterpillars of Spodoptera littoralis in the first stage and then placed in a plastics container. 3 days later, the percentage reduction in population and the percentage reduction in feeding damage (% activity) are determined by comparing the number of dead caterpillars and the feeding damage on the treated plants with that on untreated plants.<br>
Example 82: Action against Spodoptera littoralis, systemic:<br>
Maize seedlings are placed in the test solution. 6 days later, the leaves are cut off, placed on moist filter paper in a petR1 dish and infested with 12 to 15 Spodoptera littoralis larvae in the Li stage. 4 days later, the percentage reduction in population (% activity) is determined by comparing the number of dead caterpillars on treated plants with that on untreated plants.<br>
Example 83: Action against Heliothis virescens<br>
30-35 eggs of Heliothis virescens, from 0 to 24 hours old, are placed on filter paper in a petR1 dish on a layer of artificial nutrient. 0.8 ml of the test solution is then pipetted onto the filter papers. Evaluation is made 6 days later. The percentage reduction in population (% activity) is determined by comparing the number of dead eggs and larvae on treated plants with that on untreated plants.<br>
Example 84: Action against Plutella xvlostella caterpillars<br>
Young cabbage plants are sprayed with an aqueous emulsion spray mixture comprising 12.5 ppm of test compound. After the spray-coating has dried, the cabbage plants are populated with 10 caterpillars of Plutella xylostella in the first stage and placed in a plastics container. Evaluation is made 3 days later. The percentage reduction in population and the percentage reduction in feeding damage (% activity) are determined by comparing the number of dead caterpillars and the feeding damage on the treated plants with that on the untreated plants.<br><br>
Example B5: Action against Frankliniella occidentalis<br>
Pieces of bean leaves are placed on agar in petR1 dishes and sprayed with test solution in a spray chamber. The leaves are then infested with a mixed population of Frankliniella occidentalis. Evaluation is made 10 days later. The percentage reduction (% activity) is determined by comparing the population on the treated leaves with that on untreated leaves.<br>
Example B6: Action against Diabrotica balteata<br>
Maize seedlings are sprayed with an aqueous emulsion spray mixture comprising 12.5 ppm of the test compound and, after the spray-coating has dried, the maize seedlings are populated with 10 Diabrotica balteata larvae in the second stage and then placed in a plastics container. 6 days later, the percentage reduction in population (% activity) is determined by comparing the number of dead larvae on the treated plants with that on untreated plants.<br>
Example B7: Action against Tetranvchus urticae<br>
Young bean plants are populated with a mixed population of Tetranychus urticae and sprayed one day later with an aqueous emulsion spray mixture comprising 12.5 ppm of test compound. The plants are incubated for 6 days at 25°C and subsequently evaluated. The percentage reduction in population (% activity) is determined by comparing the number of dead eggs, larvae and adults on the treated plants with that on untreated plants.<br>
