PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Field of Technology<br>
The present invention relates to a radio acquisition system, more particularly, to a remote monitoring management system for the electric power device. It can be used for the remote monitoring of the measuring devices at the high voltage side, and for the communication and remote control of device at the high voltage side as well.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The monitoring of electric power high-voltage device is an important link in the automation management chain of the electric power section, in which the data acquisition of operation states of high voltage device is the most critical part. At present, for monitoring of connection conditions of high voltage device, it is only possible to determine the connection conditions of high voltage device by means of indirect analysis of the states of rear-end device being monitored, and it is also only possible to use special-purpose electric meters at the rear end to make indirect measuring of the current of high-voltage circuit. In short, acquisition of operation states for most of existing power high voltage device is indirect, or is not so quantitative and so timely, which becomes a bottleneck in raising the level of electric power automation management.<br>
In the prior art, Chinese Patent ZL200520069378.3 regarding a practical new model of Radio acquisition device for Electric Power High-Voltage Device is related to a radio acquisition system for electric power high-voltage device which consists of current transformer (CT), I/V conversion module, feeding unit and radio transmitter-receiver device. The said feeding unit is a wide-range dynamic type of stabilized<br>

.1.1 JUN 2009<br><br>
feeding which consists of the feeding current acquisition module and the feeder temperature acquisition module. ASK or FSK modulation mode is used for the radio transmitting and receiving circuit of this acquisition system, resulting in a low capacity of error correction and a low immunity. The wide-range current and constant-voltage converting circuit ensures a constant voltage output of the conversion circuit only when the variation in current of CT is in a range of<br>
6%-100%.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a remote monitoring management system for the electric power device based on the deficiency in the monitoring technology of existing electric power high-voltage device in order to be used in directly acquiring the state information of electric power high-voltage device and quantitatively determining the state values of relevant locations. Radio transmission mode used in this system not only ensures the remote monitoring and management of electric power high-voitage device, but also allows the whole system to have a better capacity of error correction for transmission and receiving, higher immunity and more reliable communication.<br>
The technical scheme of the present invention is described as follows: A remote monitoring management system of electric power device includes a radio acquisition device and a data converter, wherein the radio acquisition device consists of a current transformer, a wide current constant-voltage converting circuit, a current sampling circuit, an AC A/D acquisition unit, an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) unit, a<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
temperature sensor, a temperature measuring circuit and a radio transmitting and receiving circuit; after the signals from CT and temperature sensor are respectively transmitted via the wide-range current and constant voltage converter, current sampling circuit, AC A/D acquisition unit and the temperature measuring circuit to the AVR unit and processed by it, the data signals will be transmitted via the radio transmitting and receiving circuit;<br>
said data converter consists of a radio transmitting and receiving circuit, a hardware clock circuit, an AVR unit, a RS485 data communication interface and a voltage regulation power supply;<br>
said radio transmitting and receiving circuit, a hard clock circuit and a RS485 data communication interface are connected respectively with the AVR unit.The further characteristics of the above remote monitoring management of electric power device lie in Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) modulation mode used in the said radio transmitting and receiving circuit. The said radio transmitting and receiving circuit consists of the radio receiver circuit and the radio transmitter circuit. The transmitting and receiving frequency of the circuit is 433M, 868M or 915M The said wide current constant-voltage converting circuit can realize a constant voltage output<br>
when the variation in current of CT is in a range of 2%~ 100%. CT used for LV power is used as the said CT.<br>
The remote monitoring management system of electric power device of the present invention has realized the localized quantitative monitoring in a timely manner for high-voltage device on the principle of "virtual potential". As a result, the monitoring management level has been raised obviously. Moreover, it can also be used very<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
conveniently in the remote control system for electric power high-voltage device. As compared to the other technologies available now, the present invention has higher capacity of error correction for radio transmitting and receiving of the system, higher immunity and more reliable communication.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Fig. 1 is the schematic block diagram of radio acquisition device of the remote monitoring management system of electric power device of the invention.<br>

Description of the preferred embodiment<br>
The invention will further be described with reference to accompanying drawings.<br>
A typical remote monitoring system consists of a radio acquisition device, data converter and a field service terminal. The radio acquisition device acquires the current data of high-voltage device on a real time basis. After calling back the current data acquired by the radio acquisition device, the data converter transmits the current data to the field service terminal in a wire mode or in a radio mode. The main function of the data converter is the relay transmission of data to form a transparent channel between the radio acquisition device and the field service terminal. The field service terminal    will make quantitative computations, memorizing, comparison with other<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
data, etc., and will upload the processed data and information to the front-end computer system. The front-end computer will distribute the data and information according to the types of information to each end user. Each client terminal will make a composite processing of listing, display, plotting, printing, saving, alarming, etc., according to the specific requirements of the service department.<br>
Refer to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 for an example of implementation of the present invention i.e. the remote monitoring management system of electric power device consisting of the radio acquisition device and data converter, in which the said radio acquisition device consists of CT, wide-range current and constant voltage converting circuit, current sampling circuit, AC A/D acquisition unit, AVR unit, temperature sensor, temperature measuring circuit and radio transmitting and receiving circuit. After the signals from CT and temperature sensor are respectively transmitted via the wide-range current and constant voltage converter, current sampling circuit, AC A/D acquisition unit and the temperature measuring circuit to the AVR unit and processed by it, the data signals will be transmitted via the radio transmitting and receiving circuit. The said data converter consists of the radio transmitting and receiving circuit, hard clock circuit, AVR unit, RS485 data communication interface and the stabilized power supply. The radio transmitting and receiving circuit, hard clock circuit and the RS485 data communication interface are connected respectively with the AVR main control unit.<br>
For the radio acquisition device, see Fig. i.<br>
The standard CT for LV power is used as the CT. The output at the secondary side is 500mA with an accuracy class of 0.5, 10VA. Since the secondary side of the CT is enclosed in the radio acquisition device, the radio transmission is used for all data.<br>
,11 JUN 2009<br><br>
The floating ground is provided for the radio acquisition device. Therefore, a large amount of cost has been saved for the design of insulation protection while the operation is convenient. Wide current constant voltage converting: CT has a wide-range current output. After AC/DC rectification and voltage stabilization, the current is converted to be DC output at a constant voltage. With the booting and stabilizing<br>
principle applied, when the current of CT fluctuates in a range of 2%~ 100%, the<br>
conversion circuit is output at a constant voltage to satisfy the actual requirement sufficiently. Current sampling circuit: A standard resistor is connected in series to the main circuit of CT secondary side for current sampling. AC A/D acquisition unit: After amplifying and filtering, the AC voltage sampling signals of the standard resistor connected in series to the secondary main circuit are acquired directly by the micro-controller. The advantage of AC acquisition lies in a high accuracy of voltage acquisition, and it is possible to reach Accuracy Class 1, and furthermore, the circuit is simple and the power consumption is low. AVR unit: The wide current constant-voltage converting circuit provides power supply for the main control unit. AVR monolithic microprocessor is used for real-time acquisition of current and temperature signals and computation. When a copying and receiving instruction from the data converter is received, the AVR monolithic microprocessor will transmit the acquired current and temperature values to the data converter. When it is required to measure the temperature, the temperature sensors e.g. platinum resistor will be installed at the joints of power lines. Temperature measuring circuit: The temperature values corresponding to the resistance values of platinum resistor are converted to the corresponding voltage values to be acquired by the main control circuit. The radio transmitting and receiving circuit consists of the radio receiver circuit and the radio transmitter circuit. GFSK modulation mode is adopted. The communication frequency<br>
1 1 JUN 2009<br><br>
is 433M, 868M or 915M. The power consumption of transmission is 0.05W. The communication distance is &gt; 10m.<br>
For the data converter, see Fig. 2.<br>
Radio transmitting and receiving circuit: It is as same as the transceiver circuit in the radio acquisition device. Hard clock circuit: It provides a real-time clock for the current and temperature radio acquisition device. AVR main control unit: It is controlled by upper-level computers. When an upper-level computer gives an instruction of Copying and Reading Data from Radio acquisition device via the RS485 data communication interface, the current and temperature data acquired on a real time basis by the AVR main control unit will be uploaded to the upper-level computer. During the normal operation, the fixed cycle acquisition of above mentioned data (the fixed cycle is settable) and the communication with the upper-level computers comply with DL/T645 Protocol. RS485 data communication interface: It is a data interface of communication with the upper-level computer. The telecommunication is executed by the upper-level computer. Stabilized voltage power supply: It is the AC power supply, and provides the DC stabilized voltage power supply to the above-mentioned unit circuit.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, it is the circuit schematic diagram of the remote monitoring management system of electric power device of the present invention.<br>
Although the fairly good examples of implementation of the present invention have been presented above, they are not taken to set a limit to the present invention. Anyone who is skilful at this technology can make various changes or improvements<br>
11 JUN 2009<br><br>
by him/herself without breaking away from the main idea of the present invention and within the scope of the present invention. Therefore, the protection limits of the present invention should be as defined by the protection scope of the Claims for Rights as stated in this Application.<br>
