				<td>METHOD FOR DESIGNING MULTIFOCAL CONTACT LENSES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to multifocal ophthalmic lenses. In particular, the<br>
invention provides methods for designing contact lenses that provide correction for<br>
presbyopia and that take into account pupil size and vergence.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
As an individual ages, the eye is less able to accommodate, or bend the<br>
natural lens, to focus on objects that are relatively near to the observer. This<br>
condition is known as presbyopia. Similarly, for persons who have had their natural<br>
lens removed and an intraocular lens inserted as a replacement, the ability to<br>
accommodate is absent.<br>
Among the methods used to correct for the eye's failure to accommodate are<br>
contact lenses that have more than one optical power. In particular, multifocal<br>
contact and intraocular lenses have been developed in which zones of distance and<br>
near, and in some cases intermediate, power have been provided. However, no one<br>
of the known designs has proven to be widely successful with lens wearers.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention provides methods for designing a contact lenses, lenses<br>
according to the design method, and methods for producing the lenses, which lenses<br>
provide presbyopic correction by taking into account pupil size and vergence in their<br>
design. The lenses of the invention are advantageous in that their design augments<br>
the eye's accommodative gain, meaning the increase in plus power measured in<br>
diopters when the eye responds to an accommodative or convergence stimulus.<br>
Additionally, the design takes advantage of the eye's residual accommodation<br>
amplitude, or the total accommodative ability of the eye based on the age and ocular<br>
physiology of the individual.<br><br>
The invention provides a method for the design of a multifocal lens<br>
comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of: a.) selecting a resting pupil<br>
diameter; b.) calculating a pupil diameter when viewing near objects; c.) selecting a<br>
ratio of near vision correction area to far vision correction area for a lens; d.)<br>
calculating values for the ratio as a function of an add power for viewing near and<br>
far objects using the resting and near viewing pupil diameters; and e.) adding an<br>
amount of optical convergence for the lens.<br>
In a first step of the method of the design of the lens of the invention, the<br>
pupil size is taken into account in the following manner. A resting pupil diameter,<br>
or pupil diameter for viewing objects more than about 500 cm from the eye, is<br>
selected based on an average of population data or a measurement of an individual's<br>
pupil. The pupil diameter when viewing near objects, or objects less than about 100<br>
cm from the eye, as a function of prescribed add power is then calculated based on<br>
the prescribed add power, the residual accommodation and the resting pupil<br>
diameter. To perform this calculation, the total add power required by the lens<br>
wearer must be determined. A portion of this add power will be supplied by the<br>
prescribed add power of the lens and a portion by the residual accommodation of the<br>
lens wearer's eye.<br>
The residual add power may be calculated by subtracting the prescribed add<br>
power from the total add power required. A determination of the total amount of<br>
add power required will be based on optics, clinical experience that determines add<br>
powers for product which powers generally are available in the range from 1.00 to<br>
3.00D, and the known studies of the accommodation needs of presbyopic<br>
populations as a function of age. The residual accommodation may be a<br>
physiologically determined quantity, mainly dependent on age and typically varies<br>
from 10+D for people less than about 15 years of age to less than 0.5D in those more<br><br>
than about 65 years old. For illustration purposes, it may be assumed that, to read<br>
clearly at 35 cm from the eye, an individual may require a total add power of 2.85D.<br>
The prescribed add power will be 1.00D and the residual add power will be 1.65D.<br>
It is also known that there is a functional dependence between pupil size and<br>
accommodation measured at a constant luminance. Based on this, the<br>
accommodative response has been computed by obtaining the inverse of the object<br>
distance and has been measured over a wide range of light intensities. For example,<br>
such data was reported in Glen Myers, Shirin Berez, William Krenz and Lawrence<br>
Stark, Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol., 258: 813-819 (1990). Such<br>
data is the basis for the pupil constriction model that assumes independent linear<br>
interaction between accommodative stimulus and increase in luminance as shown by<br>
the equation:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
A is the pupil size;<br>
Ao is the resting pupil size;<br>
B is 1/object distance in meters; and<br>
C is log FL.<br>
Measured clinically, B is 0.27 and C is 0.19. Assuming a luminance of 1.0 FL,<br>
Equation 1 can be rewritten as:<br><br>
wherein D is the residual accommodation in the lens wearer's eye. Applying<br>
Equation II to the example above in which 2.85D is the required total add power and<br>
assuming a resting pupil diameter of 7.5 mm, Table 1 below shows the calculated<br><br>
values for the difference between the resting pupil diameter and pupil diameter<br>
resulting from application of Equation II.<br><br>
The ratio (AF /AN) of area of the lens to be used for correcting the wearer's<br>
distance vision, or of the far zone of the lens, versus that used for correcting near<br>
vision, or the near vision zone, to be provided by the lens design may be then<br>
selected and used to calculate the area of the lens to be allocated to near and far<br>
vision optics. The selection may be based on the measured visual acuity and<br>
contrast sensitivity at far and near luminance ranges for either an individual or the<br>
average for a population of individuals. A preferred ratio for refractive optics is<br>
70/30, in favor of the far vision zones, when viewing near objects. A preferred ratio<br>
for a diffractive optic will be 50/50.<br>
The values for AF /AN can be calculated as a function of add power for<br>
viewing near and far objects, the results for a ratio of 70/30 which are shown on<br>
Table 2. The area ratio in this calculation is given by the square of the ratio of<br>
diameters.<br><br><br>
For example, based on a pupil size of 7.5 mm when viewing distant objects<br>
and 7.0 mm when viewing near objects, the area of optic provided for far vision is<br>
π(7.5/2)2 x 0.70 sq. mm and the area provided for near vision is π(7.5/2)2 x 0.30 sq.<br>
mm. When viewing near objects, the area is reduced to Π(7.0/2)2. The ratio of the<br>
near vision area to the total optical area is π(7.5/2)2 x 0.30/ π(7.0/2)2 or (7.5/7.0)2 x<br>
0.30 = 1.072 x 0.30 = 1.145 x 0.3 = 0.343 or 34.3%. Thus, 65.7% remains for the<br>
far vision zone.<br>
Thus, the method of the invention permits the lens designer to provide a<br>
greater portion of the pupillary aperture to the retinal image of far object images<br>
without compromising the luminance of near object images. This is due to the fact<br>
that the near vision zone is placed within the pupillary area of the constricted pupil<br>
and the far vision zone is disposed within the pupillary aperture of the pupil at rest,<br>
or the unaccommodated pupil and pupillary constriction on accommodation<br>
excludes some of the far vision zone.<br>
In another step of the method of the invention, an amount of vergence, or<br>
optical convergence, effective to bring both eyes of an individual to a common focus<br>
on a viewed object is incorporated into the lens. The amount of optical convergence<br>
added will depend upon the add power designed into the lens, with the amount of<br>
optical convergence increasing as the amount of add power increases. Typically, an<br>
amount up to about 2.0D may be added.<br><br>
The optical convergence preferably is incorporated into the lens by adding a<br>
base-in prism, meaning horizontal prism with the base oriented in the nasal direction<br>
of the lens. Optical convergence may, in monovision designs, also be incorporated<br>
by adding sufficient plus power to the lens to reduce the overall accommodative<br>
need. Also, convergence may be added by decentering the center of the near vision<br>
zone from the lens' geometric center.<br>
The preferred lens resulting from the method of the invention is a bifocal in<br>
which the optic zone contains two, radially symmetric zones: a first zone that is a<br>
central zone and a second zone that is an annular zone that surrounds the central<br>
zone. The far and near vision zones are located within the pupillary aperture of the<br>
eye at rest. The near vision zone is located within the pupillary aperture when the<br>
eye is fully accommodated and has an area of about 30 to about 50 % of the area of<br>
the optic zone inside of the pupillary aperture for near vision, while the radius of the<br>
optic zone matches or exceeds the pupillary aperture for far vision. The ratio of the<br>
area of near to far vision is calculated as described above, the ratio favoring far<br>
vision when the eye is unaccommodated and near vision when the eye is<br>
accommodated. Additionally, the near vision zone is provided with a horizontal<br>
prismatic correction with the base oriented in the nasal direction. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the location of the near vision zone is specified to be within the<br>
pupillary aperture of the accommodated eye, but no limitation is placed on its<br>
location relative to the pupil's center.<br>
In the lenses of the invention, the optic zone, and the near and far vision<br>
zones within, may be on the front surface, or object side surface, the back surface, or<br>
eye side surface of the lens, or split between the front and back surfaces. Cylinder<br>
power may be provided on the back, or concave surface of the lens in order to<br>
correct the wearer's astigmatism. Alternatively, the cylinder power may be<br>
combined with either or both of the distance and near vision powers on the front<br><br>
surface or back surface. In all of the lenses of the invention, the distance,<br>
intermediate and near optical powers may be spherical or aspheric powers.<br>
Contact lenses useful in the invention preferably are soft contact lenses. Soft<br>
contact lenses, made of any material suitable for producing such lenses, preferably<br>
are used. Illustrative materials for formation of soft contact lenses include, without<br>
limitation silicone elastomers, silicone-containing macromers including, without<br>
limitation, those disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 5,371,147, 5,314,960, and<br>
5,057,578 incorporated in their entireties herein by reference, hydrogels, silicone-<br>
containing hydrogels, and the like and combinations thereof. More preferably, the<br>
surface is a siloxane, or contains a siloxane functionality, including, without<br>
limitation, polydimethyl siloxane macromers, methacryloxypropyl polyalkyl<br>
siloxanes, and mixtures thereof, silicone hydrogel or a hydrogel, such as etafilcon A.<br>
A preferred lens-forming material is a poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate<br>
polymers, meaning, having a peak molecular weight between about 25,000 and<br>
about 80,000 and a polydispersity of less than about 1.5 to less than about 3.5<br>
respectively and covalently bonded thereon, at least one cross-linkable functional<br>
group. This material is described in United States Patent No. 6,846,892<br>
incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Suitable materials for forming<br>
intraocular lenses include, without limitation, polymethyl methacrylate,<br>
hydroxyethyl methacrylate, inert clear plastics, silicone-based polymers, and the like<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>
Curing of the lens forming material may be carried out by any means known<br>
including, without limitation, thermal, irradiation, chemical, electromagnetic<br>
radiation curing and the like and combinations thereof. Preferably, the lens is<br>
molded which is carried out using ultraviolet light or using the full spectrum of<br><br>
visible light. More specifically, the precise conditions suitable for curing the lens<br>
material will depend on the material selected and the lens to be formed.<br>
Polymerization processes for ophthalmic lenses including, without limitation,<br>
contact lenses are well known. Suitable processes are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,540,410 incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.<br>
The contact lenses of the invention may be formed by any conventional<br>
method. For example, the optic zone may be produced by diamond-turning or<br>
diamond-turned into the molds that are used to form the lens of the invention.<br>
Subsequently, a suitable liquid resin is placed between the molds followed by<br>
compression and curing of the resin to form the lenses of the invention.<br>
Alternatively, the zone may be diamond-turned into lens buttons.<br><br>
