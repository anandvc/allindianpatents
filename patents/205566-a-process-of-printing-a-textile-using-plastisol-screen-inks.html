COMPLETE .SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section   10;   Rule   13)<br>
A PROCESS OF PRINTING A TEXTILE USING PLASTISOL SCREEN INKS.<br>
MR. FAREED ZAFAR QURESHI (Indian National ) having office at 220/A VEENA DALWAI INDUSTRIAL ESTATE, S.V.ROAD, OSHIWARA, JOGESHWARI (WEST), MUMBAI - 400 102, INDIA.<br>
The following specifications particularly describes &amp; Ascertains the nature of this invention &amp; the manner in which it is performed:<br>
4   MAR   2005<br><br>
4-3-2005<br><br>
Plastisol inks are globally used in garment printing. They are 100% solid Solventless    inks.  They are widely used by textile printers to decorate T-shirts,   caps,   sports   wear,   inner  wear,   kids  wear,   menswear,   swim  wear, jogging    wear,    Bermudas,    fabrics    of    cotton,    cotton-blend,    polyester, polyester-blend, etc.,<br>
Some international branded products available in Indian market today, such a s GAP, FILA, NIKE, SPIRIT, POLO etc, use plastisol colours. But, these international manufactures use plastisol inks which are not made in India. They import the ink from outside India. This adds to the cost of finished product.<br>
Further the availability of imported foreign brands can not be guaranteed. They have fluctuating prices because of doller and freight charges.<br>
Furthermore, in case of imported foreign brands, if anything goes wrong, their service may not be available immediately. We can only fax the complaints and wait for action.<br>
In India, conventionally textile printers use pigment colours based on monomer. This method of garment printing has certain drawbacks as mentioned in the paragraphs that follow.<br>
The pigment colours which are based on monomer are hazardous to health and may cause skin-irritation. Also, the people working in such industries may fall victim to diseases caused by monomer.<br>
In the conventional method of pigment printing, there is a strong bad odour. Also screens of printers face the problem of clogging. The screens need frequent cleaning. Because of this, some time is wasted in between and the whole process becomes slower.<br><br><br>
The pigment colours being monomer MTO based crack after sometime.<br>
The pigment colours may get damaged by frequent washing, use of alkali or by exposure to light. Moreover, they are hazardous to environment also.<br>
Because of all these disadvantages, the international community is neglecting pigment coiours, stating that they are hazardous and many countries have imposed ban on such colours.<br>
The present invention "Plastisol screeen inks used for garment printing' has for its principal objective, to develop a garment printing ink which wiii not be hazardous to health, as well as to environment. The said ink should eliminate all the above mentioned drawbacks of existing systems and should provide printing in exclusive designs and eye-catching colours.<br>
The other objectives of the invention are:=<br>
To avoid the use of monomer and MTO in the garment printing ink. This<br>
will prevent any injuries to people working in  such industries.<br>
The said inks should not have any bad or foul smell of kerosene.<br>
Another objective is to make the whole process fasier and suitable for mass production. For this, the printer screens should be designed in such a way, that they should be re-usable.<br>
This will further eliminate the need of keeping an inventory.<br>
The garment printing ink developed should be capable of giving fine dot printing or photo-effect printing.<br><br><br>
The surface of fabric on which printing has been done, should not get damaged and should retain its original structure.<br>
The finished product should be soft in touch and not rough and bulky.<br>
Also, the objective is to provide a garment printing ink which will not crack after some time, and it should not get damaged due to washing, using any alkalies or just by exposing to sunlight.<br>
Apart from all above mentioned objectives, the product has been designed to incorporate an additional features of providing designer colours in various ranges such as metallic,   fluorescent, glow-in-dark, puff, reflectives, etc.,<br>
The present invention "A Process Of Printing A Textile Using Plastisol<br>
Screen Inks" containing a 100% solid, solventless ink housing a long oils,<br>
comprising the following steps, colouring the fabric by creating Mechanical<br>
bonding with fabric allowed to dry by curing method at a temperature in the<br>
range of 280-340 f, or gelled by semi-curing at a temperature in the range of<br>
180-300° f for a period of 5-30 seconds. It is developed keeping in mind the<br>
goal of providing a non-hazardous, 100% safe ink which is based on long<br>
oils. The invention has been successfully developed and perfected to<br>
eliminate all the drawbacks of existing practices. This has been possible<br>
after doing extensive research and trials.	<br>
The present invention 'A Process Of Printing A Textile Using Plastisol Screen Inks' will now be explained in details.<br><br>
Plastisoi inks are 100% solid, sloventless inks, They contain ink vehicle having flash point greater than 400 degree (f). This ink determines film forming rubber characteristic, which will never air dry. This must be heart" cured. Plastlsol do not colour or dye the substrate by penetrating., but create surface film or mechanical bonding with the fabric. They can be directly printed on ail textile materials having two requirements:<br>
i)       'The textile material must withstand the curing temperature.<br>
ii) It must be porous enough to permit good penetration of the ink. This ink will not work on non-porous substrates such as metal, plastic, glass etc.<br>
Plastisol inks do not dry by air as most inks do.The inks will not dry or clog the screen.The temperature at which the ink becomes fully cured is called the fusion temperature which is 280=340 degree (f). Plalsflsol can be gelled or semi-cured between 180-300 degree(f), If the entire thickness of the ink is not brought to the correct coring temperature, the ink will be under cured and crack and flake off the garment when washed. Once the entire thickness of ths ink reaches the correct temperature., th§ ink becomes a continuous film and is fully cured, Plastisols art cured between 10-20 seconds. The time however, may vary form plant to plant, uring can be accomplished with the use of conveyer dryers, Flash curing unit or by using simple infra-red heaters. The temperature achieved at the ink fiim must be maintained at a suitable ievei.<br>
■   ■	j<br>
Curing temperature is a combination of time when the garment is under the heater and the temperature of the heater. The temperature can be controlled by controlling the belt speed of a conveyer dryer or time under heater with a flash curing unit.<br><br><br>
 After this, some tests are carried out to ensure that curing is done properly, Ths ultimate test for curing is a wash test. But, there are two methods to determine if the film is fully cured. They are explained in the paragraphs that follow :-<br>
1)	Stretch Test ; This is most popular method to check the curing. It<br>
does not require any mechanical or eiectricai device. If on<br>
stretching, the print cracks and does not retract, it means the inks<br>
is probably under cured. You should raise the temperature of ths<br>
garment by Increasing the amount of time the garment is under the<br>
heaters.<br>
Stretch test does not always work on the deposit of ink, The top layers may stretch but the ink deep down in the fibers may be under cured.<br>
2)	Ethyl Test: Place few drops of ethyl acetate on the back of the ink<br>
on the inside of the garment. This is piaced on an area of unprinted<br>
garment and held tightly together for few minutes, if the ink gets<br>
transferred to the unprinted area, the ink is not fully cured.. But,<br>
ethyi should be avoided as far as possible, because it is hazardous<br>
to health.<br>
Benefits :=<br>
The present invention 'Plastisol screen inks used for garment printing' has many advantages over the conventionally available pigment colours. Some of them are highlighted in the paragraphs that follow.<br><br><br>
Plastisol colours are 100% safe for health. Since they donot contain any components of monomer or MTO they donot cause skin irritation or any other injuries to health..<br>
Plastisol colours eliminate the strong bad odour present in case of conventional pigment printing.<br>
In plastisots, the printer screen do not get clogged which gives a free hand to the printer to take out more productions than the conventional prints,<br>
The printer screen can be re-used and need not be disposed after one use. This also prevents keeping stock of these screens. So, the space that would have been wasted in stocking can be used for some other purpose.<br>
in plastisol inks, fine dot printing or even photo-effect printing can be easily obtained. This is done by using four colours namely cyan, magenta, yellow and black, These colours are mixed together to get the required shade and can be used to obtain multi colours photo-effect printing.<br>
When plastisol inks are used for garment printing, the printed portion of the fabric doesnot get   spoiled. It retains its original structure.<br>
The end result or the finished product on fabric is very soft, satin, silky and rubbery feel.<br>
Plastisol colours inks provide a variety of designer colours such as Metallic, fluorescent, giow-ln-dark, putt, refleciives, etc.</td>
