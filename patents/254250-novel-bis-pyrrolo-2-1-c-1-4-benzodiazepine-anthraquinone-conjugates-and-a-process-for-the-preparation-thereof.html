				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel bis-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-anthraquinone conjugates and a process for the preparation thereof. More particularly, it relates to a process for the preparation of novel bis-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-anthraquinone hybrids as potential antitumour agents.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to the synthesis of pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-anthraquinone hybrids linked through alkanediyldioxy bridge with linkers of varying lengths as possible anticancer agents. The structural formula of novel bis-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-anthraquinone hybrids (Va-c) is as follows,<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein n = 3, 4, 5.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines are a family of DNA interactive antitumour antibiotics derived from Streptomyces species. Examples of naturally occurring pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines include anthramycin, tomaymycin, sibiromycin and DC-81. These compounds show their biological activity through covalent binding via their N10-C11 imine/carbinol amine moiety to the C2-amine position of a guanine residue within the minor groove of DNA giving rise to the preference for Pu-G-Pu sequences. (Kunimoto, S.; Masuda, T.; Kanbayashi, N.; Hamada, M.; Naganawa, H.; Miyamoto, M.; Takeuchi, T and Unezawa, H. J. Antibiot, 1980, 33, 665.; Kohn, K. W. and Speous, C. L J. Mol. Biol., 1970, 91, 551.; Hurley, L. H.; Gairpla, C. and Zmijewski, M. Biochem. Biophy. Acta., 1977, 475, 521.; Kaplan, D. J. and Hurley, L H. Biochemistry, 1981, 20, 7572.) The molecules have a right-handed twist, when viewed from the C-ring towards the A-ring. This enables the<br>
PBD to mirror the curvature of B-form DNA and maintain isohelical contact with the walls and floor of the minor groove.<br>
In the last few years a growing interest has been shown in the development of new pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,,4]benzodiazepine hybrids. Many PBD conjugates have been synthesized and investigated for their anticancer activity (Thurston, D. E.; Morris, S. J.; Hartley, J. A. Chem. Commun. 1996, 563.; Damayanthi, Y.; Reddy, B. S. P.; Lown, J. W. J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 290.; Kamal, A.; Reddy, B. S. N.; Reddy, G. S. K.; Ramesh, G Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002, 12, 1933, Kamal, A.; Reddy, B. S. N.; Reddy Indian patent application No.209/DEL/2000). Recently C-8 linked PBD dimers with C2/C2 exo-unsaturation have been designed and synthesized (Gregson, S. J.; Howard, P. W.; Hartley, J. A.; Brooks, N. A.; Adam, L. J.; Jenkins, T. C; Kelland, L. R. and Thurston, D. E., J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 737). Also, non cross-linking mixed imine-amide PBD dimers have been synthesized that have significant DNA binding ability and potent antitumor activity (Kamal, A.; Ramesh, G.; Laxman, N.; Ramulu, P.; Srinivas, O.; Neelima, K.; Kondapi, A. K.; Srinu, V. B.; Nagarajaram, H. M. J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 4679).<br>
During earlier studies in this laboratory anthraquinone has been linked through its amino functionality to the C8 position of the A-ring of PBDs which have shown promising anticancer activity (Kamal, A.; Ramu, R.; Khanna, G. B. R.; Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004, 14, 4907, Kamal, A.; Ramu, R.; Khanna, G. B. R. PCT Patent Appl. No. PCT/IN04/00212, US Patent Appl. No. 11/024,240).<br>
However, in the present invention the two pbd units have been joined to the 1, 4-positions of the anthraquinone through their a-c8 positions via alkanediyldioxy bridge with linkers of varying lengths, provide novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines useful as anticancer agents. It also provides a process for the preparation of novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines useful as antitumor agents.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of pyrrolo[2,1c][1,4]benzodiazepines anthraquinone- anthraquinone of formula V of the drawing accompanying the specification ,<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein n = 3, 4 or 5.<br>
The invention involves the reaction of 1,4-dihydroxy anthraquinone of formula I with dibromoalkanes in an aprotic water miscible organic solvent, in the presence of a mild inorganic base, at refluxing temperature, for a period of 24h, isolating 1,4-bis-(n-bromo alkyloxy)-anthracene-9,10-dione of formula II and reacting the compound of formula lla-c with (2S)-N-[4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-2-nitrobenzoyl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxaldehyde diethylthioacetal in presence of mild inorganic bases isolating compound of formula III, reducing it with SnCl2H2O in presence of organic solvent at a reflux temperature, reacting the above amino compound of formula IV with known deprotecting agents in a conventional manner to get the novel pyrrol[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine of formula V wherein 'n' are as stated above.<br>
The precursor, (2S)-N-[4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-2-nitrobenzoyl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxaldehyde diethylthioacetal has been prepared by literature methods (Thurston, D. E.; Murthy, V. S.; Langley, D. R.; Jones, G. B. Synthesis, 1990, 81).<br>
The representative compounds of formula V of present invention are given below:<br>
1] 1,4-Bis-{3-[7-methoxy-8-oxy-(11aS)-1,2,3,11a tetrahydro-5H-pyrrolo [2,1-c][1,4]-benzodiazepin-5-one]propyloxy}anthacene-9,10-dione (Va)<br>
2] 1,4-Bis-{4-[7-methoxy-8-oxy-(11aS)-1,2,3,11a tetrahydro-5H-pyrrolo [2,1-c] [1,4] benzodiazepin-5-one]butyloxy}anthacene-9,10-dione (Vb)<br>
3] 1,4-Bis-{5-[7-methoxy-8-oxy-(11aS)-1,2,3,11a tetrahydro-5H-pyrrolo [2,1-c] [1,4] benzodiazepin-5-one]pentyloxy}anthacene-9,10-dione(Vb)<br>
These new analogues of pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine hybrids have shown promising anticancer activity in selected human cancer cell lines. The molecules synthesized are of immense biological significance with potential sequence selective DNA-binding property. This resulted in the design and synthesis of new congeners as illustrated in Scheme which comprises of<br>
1.	The ether linkage at C-8 position of DC-81 intermediates with anthraquinone moiety.<br>
2.	Refluxing the reaction mixture for 24-48h.<br>
3.	Synthesis of C-8 linked PBD hybrids.<br>
4. Purification by column chromatography using different solvents like ethyl acetate, hexane, dichloromethane and methanol.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
To a solution of 1,4-dihydroxy anthraquinone (480 mg, 2 mmol) in acetone (30 mL) were added anhydrous potassium carbonate (1.1 g, 8 mmol) and 1,3 dibromopropane (1.21 g, 6 mmol) and the mixture was refluxed for 24 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction, potassium carbonate was removed by filtration and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to get the crude product. This was further purified by column chromatography (30% EtOAc-hexane) to afford the compound IIa as a yellow solid (791 mg, 82%).<br>
1H NMR (CDCI3): δ 2.40-2.52 (m, 4H), 3.85-3.91 (t, 4H, J = 6.51 Hz), 4.22-4.28 (t, 4H, J = 5.53 Hz), 7.34 (s, 2H), 7.71-7.77 (m, 2H), 8.15-8.18 (m, 2H). FABMS: 482 (M+).<br>
To a solution of 1,4-bis-(3-bromo propyloxy)-anthracene-9,10-dione (Ha) (482 mg, 1mmol) in dry acetonitrile (30 mL) were added anhydrous K2C03 (829 mg, 6 mmol)and (2S)-N-[4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-2-nitrobenzoyl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxaldehyde diethyl thioacetal (801 mg, 2mmol). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 24 h.

Biological activity<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines:<br>
Cytotoxicity:   Compounds Va-c have been evaluated for the primary anticancer<br>
activity in selected  human cancer cell  lines.  The cytotoxicity data for some<br>
representative compounds is shown in Table 1. For each compound, dose response<br>
curves against each cell line were measured at a minimum of five concentrations at<br>
10 fold dilutions. A protocol of 48 h continuous drug exposure was used and a<br>
sulforhodamine B (SRB) protein assay was used to estimate cell viability or growth.<br>
The concentration causing 50 % cell growth inhibition compared with the control has<br>
been calculated.<br>
