				<td>FORMALDEHYDE-FREE PHENOLIC RESIN BINDER<br>
The present invention concerns a formaldehyde-free composition comprising<br>
a phenolic resin to be used for the manufacture of insulation products made of<br>
mineral wool, a binder for mineral wool, a method for the manufacture of mineral<br>
wool bound in a formaldehyde-free manner, as well as the bound mineral wool<br>
product thus obtained.<br>
In the manufacture of bound mineral wool products from a molten glass or<br>
mineral material it has for a long time been accepted practice to apply, following<br>
fiberization of the molten material, a binder on the basis of phenol-formaldehyde<br>
resin on the fibers while they are still hot. This preferably takes place in the chute<br>
following fiberization, e.g. in accordance with the blast drawing process according<br>
to DE 35 09 426A1.<br>
Here a phenol-formaldehyde resin, being the best-known binder of the prior<br>
art, is preferably sprayed onto the fibers in the form of an aqueous solution, or<br>
dispersion, wherein the phenol-formaldehyde resin then begins to polymerize on<br>
the fiber surface owing to the still relatively high temperatures of the fibers, and<br>
connects the single fibers with each other as a result of the polymerization process,<br>
particularly at crossing points of fibers, inasmuch as the fibers lying on top of each<br>
other at a crossing point are more or less embedded there by solidified droplets of<br>
resin, and thus the relative mobility of the single fibers is initially impeded and later<br>
on prevented entirely upon curing by means of hot gases, for instance inside a<br>
tunnel furnace.<br>
A like binder is described, e.g., in US 3,231,349. For reasons of protection of<br>
the environment as well as for reasons of workplace safety, more and more<br>
attempts are meanwhile being undertaken to replace the conventional phenolic<br>
resin binders with alternative, formaldehyde-free binders because of their<br>
formaldehyde content and their formaldehyde emission.<br><br>
Thus for example EP 0 583 086 B2 describes a curable, formaldehyde-free,<br>
aqueous binder composition for glass fibers on the basis of polymer polyacids<br>
containing at least two carboxylic acid groups or anhydride groups, which<br>
comprises a polyol containing at least two hydroxyl groups and a phosphorus-<br>
containing catalyst, wherein a ratio of the number of equivalents of COOH group to<br>
OH group must be from 0:0.01 to 1:3.<br>
A polymer polyacid described in EP 0 583 086 B2 is, for instance, polyacrylic<br>
acid.<br>
A preferably used polyol is -hydroxyalkylamide, e.g., [N,N-di(-<br>
hydroxyethyl)]-adipamide, however it is also possible to use, e.g., ethylene glycol,<br>
glycerol, pentaerythritol, trimethylol propane, sorbitol, sucrose, glucose, resorcinol,<br>
catechol, pyrogallol, glycolated ureas, 1,4-cyclohexane diol, diethanolamine or<br>
triethanolamine.<br>
Similar binder compositions for mineral fibers are, e.g., also known from US<br>
6,331,350 B1, EP 0 990 727 A1, EP 0 990 728 A1, and EP 0 990 729 A1. The<br>
listed documents of the prior art also use a polyacrylic acid as a polymer polyacid.<br>
By way of a polyol, alkanolamines as well as glycols are also used there.<br>
In addition, EP 0 882 074 B1 describes binder compositions for mineral fibers<br>
on the basis of polyacrylic acids and glycols as polyols.<br>
All of the binder compositions of the prior art constituting an alternative for<br>
phenol-formaldehyde resins are, however, currently only conditionally suited for<br>
the manufacture of mineral wool products, mainly due to their lack of water<br>
resistance, so that, for example, the binders based on polyacrylate resins have<br>
hitherto generally been barred from practical use for the manufacture of mineral<br>
wool products.<br>
The chemical industry has meanwhile furnished pre-condensated phenol-<br>
formaldehyde resins that do - in a sense - already present a reduced content of<br>
free formaldehyde, however still have to be subsequently crosslinked with<br>
additional formaldehyde in order to improve the properties of resin and binder,<br>
particularly water resistance. As a result, emissions of formaldehyde due to its<br><br>
high vapor pressure and the relatively slow crosslinking reaction between polymer<br>
chains are nearly unavoidable.<br>
Starting out from the prior art of the commercially available phenolic resin<br>
binders reduced in formaldehyde, the applicant has set itself the task for the<br>
purposes of mineral wool manufacture in the development of novel,<br>
environmentally compatible binders to arrive at formaldehyde-free binders with the<br>
classical phenol-formaldehyde resins despite their formaldehyde content.<br>
According to the present invention, this object is achieved through a<br>
formaldehyde-free composition comprising an aqueous dispersion of a phenol-<br>
formaldehyde resin, a binder comprising said composition and a method for the<br>
manufacture of mineral wool bound in a formaldehyde-free manner.<br><br>
R1, R2 and R3 independently of each other, equal or not equal,<br>
corresponds to H and R1 of the general formula (2):<br><br>
In particular, the present invention concerns a composition containing:<br>
an aqueous dispersion of at least one phenol-formaldehyde resin;<br>
at least one amine compound of the general formula (1)<br>
with a value for n of 2-10, and<br>
R2 and R3, independently of each other, are equal or not equal to H<br>
or correspond to the general formula (3):<br><br><br>
wherein m may assume a value of 1-50,<br>
and the molecular mass of the amine compound does not exceed<br>
approximately 20 000 g/mole;<br>
at least one activated silane,<br>
which may be obtained by a conversion of a silane, selected from the<br>
group: mono-, di- and trialkoxysilanes having one C1 to C8 alkoxy<br>
group, wherein the alkoxysilane carries at least one C2 to C10<br>
aminoalkyl group or a C2 to C10 N-aminoalkyl group; 3(2-<br>
aminoethylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane; (MeO)3-Si-(CH2)3-NH-(CH2)3-<br>
Si-(OMe)3; 3-aminopropylsilanetriol; aminosilane with ethoxylated<br>
nonylphenolate; phenyl-CH2-NH-(CH2)3-NH-(CH2)3-Si-(OMe)3*HCI; as<br>
well as mixtures thereof;<br>
with an enolizable ketone having at least one carbonyl group or a<br>
ketone having at least one OH group, wherein the ketone contains 3 to<br>
12C atoms, as well as<br>
at least one aromatic hydroxyl compound selected from the group<br>
consisting of: dihydroxybenzenes and their hydroxymethylated<br>
compounds; trihydroxybenzenes and their mono- and<br>
dihydroxymethylated compounds; C-alkylated compounds of phenol or<br>
of resorcin; autocondensation products of the hydroxymethylated<br>
compounds; activated heterocycles and their mono- or dialkylated<br>
compounds or their anellated derivatives; di- and trihydroxy derivatives<br>
of naphthalene; as well as mixtures thereof or mixtures containing these<br>
substances.<br>
Particularly due to the fact that the composition of the invention contains at<br>
least one aromatic hydroxyl compound, it is possible to trap free formaldehyde<br><br>
from the used resin and chemically convert it non-reversibly under the given<br>
conditions into such molecules which themselves are not capable of participating<br>
in the crosslinking reaction of the resin. Thanks to this measure it is one the one<br>
hand not necessary any more to add additional formaldehyde for subsequent<br>
crosslinking, and on the other hand free formaldehyde contained in the phenolic<br>
resin is bound chemically. Thus free formaldehyde is present neither in the resin<br>
nor in a mineral wool product bound by it.<br>
As aromatic hydroxyl compounds those are suited which are in particular<br>
selected from the group consisting of: dihydroxybenzenes, particularly 1,3-<br>
dihydroxybenzene, 1,2-dihydroxybenzene or 1,4-dihydroxybenzene, as well as<br>
their hydroxymethylated compounds, in particular hydroxymethylated derivatives<br>
of resorcin or benzocatechin, such as 2,4-dihydroxyphenylmethanol or 2,3-<br>
dihydroxyphenylmethanol, but also multihydroxymethylated derivatives of these<br>
activated aromatic substances, e.g., 2,3-dihydroxy-4-hydroxymethylphenyl-<br>
methanol or 4,5-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylphenylmethanol; trihydroxybenzenes,<br>
particularly 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene or 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene, their mono- and<br>
dihydroxymethylated compounds, such as 2,3,4-trihydroxyphenylmethanol or 2,4,6-<br>
trihydroxyphenylmethanol; C-alkylated compounds of phenol or of resorcin, e.g.,<br>
1 -hydroxy-2-methylbenzene, 1 -hydroxy-3-methylbenzene, 1 -hydroxy-4-methyl-<br>
benzene or 2-methylresorcin; autocondensation products of the<br>
hydroxymethylated compounds, such as bis-2,4-dihydroxyphenylmethane;<br>
activated heterocycles, e.g., pyrrole, thiophene, their mono- or dialkylated<br>
compounds or their anellated derivatives, such as indole or thioindole; di- and<br>
trihydroxyderivatives of naphthalene. It is, of course, also possible to use mixtures<br>
of these substances and mixtures containing them.<br>
The modification on a complex multi-substance mixture - such as a phenol-<br>
formaldehyde resin or a binder produced therefrom for mineral wool with different<br>
additives - constitutes a difficult set of problems, particularly inasmuch as the resin<br>
constitutes a very unstable intermediate product. Depending on the usually<br>
unknown origin of this preparation, the reactive components are present in various<br>
concentrations and thus critically influence the material properties of the finished<br>
product. The main constituents of a typical phenol-formaldehyde resin and their<br>
effect as a polymer constitutional unit are shown in the following schematic<br><br><br>
Depending on the ratio of the single constituents, a resin polymer having<br>
various properties is formed.<br>
It is possible to discern various cases of polymerization and thus of the<br>
resulting polymers having different properties, which are represented schematically<br>
in the following:<br>
Case 1:<br>
Where predominantly only simple constitutional units are present, a chain-<br>
type polymer having few linking sites between the single chains is built up, i.e., the<br>
simple constitutional units polymerize with themselves, which fact may be<br>
represented schematically by the following schematic formulae by using the above<br>
defined formula abbreviations:<br><br>
In the prior art such essentially linear and hardly branched polymer chains<br>
were subsequently crosslinked with formaldehyde in order to achieve an<br>
enhanced water resistance. The inventors intend to avoid this addition of<br>
formaldehyde. Particularly the reason for this is that formaldehyde is a volatile<br>
substance, and that the latter has a tendency to desorption under the<br>
production conditions of an elevated temperature rather than entering the<br><br>
comparatively slow crosslinking reaction with the polymer chains.<br>
Case 2:<br>
Where a mixture of simple- and double-substituted constitutional units<br>
exists which polymerize with themselves, one obtains a polymer having more<br>
strongly reticulated chains, which may be represented schematically by the<br>
following schematic formulae by using the above defined formula abbreviations:<br><br>
The resistance of such binder resins and of mineral wool products thereby<br>
manufactured against swelling processes due to moisture, such as on the<br>
construction site during bad weather or in the outdoor range, is enhanced in<br>
comparison with the non-crosslinked polymer chains.<br>
Case 3:<br>
The resistance of such a plastic material against swelling is very high.<br>
In the third case, three simple-, double- and triple-substituted compounds<br>
are present in parallel which polymerize with themselves, which may be<br>
represented schematically by the following schematic formulae by using the<br>
above defined formula abbreviations:<br><br><br>
Nevertheless, the storing capability and the processing time may be reduced<br>
depending on the concentration of the higher-substituted constitutional units<br>
depending on the pH value and the concentration of formaldehyde or of<br>
compounds releasing it, respectively,<br>
When viewed globally, however, a resin in accordance with Case 3 is<br>
desirable, yet in the prior art this could only be achieved with formaldehyde-<br>
containing phenolic resins which still release small quantities of formaldehyde.<br>
As a result of the addition of at least one aromatic hydroxyl compound it is<br>
on the one hand possible to trap excess formaldehyde that is contained in the<br>
used resin, so that its liberation is prevented, and on the other hand the<br>
compounds resulting from the reaction of the formaldehyde with the aromatic<br>
hydroxide form molecules that are very similar to the molecule species of Case 3,<br>
which shall be shown in the following by the example of resorcin:<br><br>
Due to this similarity, the molecule species (4) may in addition to the chemical<br>
From the following schematic formulae it may be seen that the polymer<br>
constitutional unit (3) has a high similarity with the molecule species (4) resulting<br>
from the trapping reaction:<br><br><br>
fixation of free formaldehyde furthermore participate in the desirable crosslinking<br>
reactions and thus lastly result in formaldehyde-free phenolic resins as well as<br>
binders therefrom for mineral wool.<br>
It is accordingly also possible to employ commercially available aromatic<br>
hydroxyl compounds that were in a certain part already reacted with formaldehyde,<br>
in order to further push the crosslinking.<br>
It is preferred to employ such commercially available phenolic resins having<br>
at the most approx. 8% (mass), particularly less than approx. 3% (mass),<br>
preferably less than approx. 2% (mass) and more preferably less than approx. 1%<br>
(mass) of free formaldehyde.<br>
As a phenolic resin, particularly resins with monomer constitutional units of<br>
the benzyl alcohol type are suited, which may also contain chain-type and/or cyclic,<br>
oligomer alkyl-bridged aromatic multinuclear compounds having a molecular mass<br>
of up to 3000 g/mole.<br>
The composition in accordance with the invention may additionally contain a<br>
carboxylic acid, particularly hydroxycarboxylic acid, preferably hydroxyacetic acid<br>
(glycolic acid).<br>
It is one preferred embodiment of the present invention to select the amine<br>
from the group consisting of C2 to C10 alkanolamine, particularly ethanolamine,<br>
diethanolamine and triethanolamine.<br>
One preferred silane of the composition in accordance with the invention is 3-<br>
aminopropyltriethoxysilane. It is commercially available at a low cost.<br>
As ketones for the manufacture of the activated silane, dihydroxyacetone or<br>
acetylacetone are preferably employed due to their easy availability, however the<br>
activated silane may also be produced with an enolizable ketone having at least<br>
one carbonyl group or a ketone having at least one OH group, wherein the ketone<br>
contains 3 to 12 C atoms.<br>
Furthermore it is frequently desirable for the composition to additionally<br>
contain at least one crosslinking agent, with those being preferred that are<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of: glycerol, polyols, neopentylglycol,<br>
trimethylallylamine, 1 ,3,5-triallyl-2-methoxybenzene, 1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)-<br>
ethane, triallylneopentylether, pentaerythrite, sugars, sugar molasse, particularly<br>
turnip molasse; as well as mixtures thereof.<br>
It is particularly preferred if the composition in accordance with the invention<br>
has a pH value in the range of approx, 7.0 to 10, particularly 8 to 9. Hereby it is on<br>
the one hand ensured that conduits and nozzles, particularly spraying nozzles, are<br>
less subjected to corrosion. On the other hand compositions in the preferred pH<br>
range do by far not attack the mineral or glass fiber to the extent as the prior-art<br>
compositions on polyacrylate basis that are distinctly more acidic.<br>
Without being bound thereto, the activation of the silane with the carbonyl<br>
compound possibly appears to unfold in accordance with the following reaction<br>
scheme, as is shown by two different carbonyl compounds:<br><br>
As a result of the activation of the silane - in the above reaction scheme by<br>
way of the example of the -aminopropylsilanetriol having resulted from hydrolysis<br>
von 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane - by reaction with an enolizable ketone having at<br><br>
least one carbonyl group or a ketone having at least one OH group, wherein the<br>
ketone contains 3 to 12 C atoms, there is formed on the activated molecule a<br>
"resin side" which is formed by the N part, in addition to a glass side formed by the<br>
Si part.<br>
In the prior art, the amino group of the silane was reacted with formaldehyde<br>
into a Schiff s base which in turn reacted with the phenol-formaldehyde resin.<br>
Thus a formaldehyde content of the binder as required in the prior art is not<br>
necessary any more because the activated silane carries an N-containing molecule<br>
portion which is capable of coupling to the resin - in accordance with the invention<br>
to the phenolic resin or to amine functions of nitrogen-containing polymers - which<br>
is thus bound via the silane linker to the glass surface of the hot fiber.<br>
Crosslinking thus takes place both through the described molecule species (4)<br>
and through the silane linker.<br>
The reactions of the activated silanes used in accordance with the invention<br>
at the glass surface - presently represented by a silica tetrahedron - are in the<br>
following shown schematically and exemplarily without being bound thereby:<br><br>
These hydrolytic linkings take place even more rapidly on the fiber while still<br>
hot.<br>
Further advantages and features of the present invention become evident<br>
from the description of practical examples as well as from the drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1: is a schematic view of silanes coupled to a glass fiber via the Si portion of an<br>
activated silane; and<br><br>
Fig. 2: is a schematic view of a resin bound to a glass surface on a fiber via an<br>
activated silane.<br>
The overall context of the composition in accordance with the invention and<br>
binder in connection with the manufacture of mineral or glass fibers is once again<br>
visualized in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.<br>
Here the represented molecular arrangement should merely be understood in<br>
a schematic manner. Crosslinking reactions will, of course, moreover still take<br>
place within the resin such as phenolic resin, in accordance with the above<br>
description, for instance with the molecule species (4) as well as the alkanolamine<br>
or further additional crosslinking agents.<br>
It is, of course, also possible for unintended secondary reactions to occur, as<br>
is true with any polymerization. The contents of Figs. 1 and 2 may therefore merely<br>
be considered to be a model concept which is, however, helpful for an<br>
understanding of the invention.<br>
The composition in accordance with the invention is excellently suited as a<br>
binder for mineral wool. On the one hand it is thus possible to manufacture<br>
positively formaldehyde-free mineral wool products, and on the other hand the<br>
cured binders of the invention and thus, of course, also the mineral wool products<br>
are water-resistant.<br>
In order to manufacture mineral wool bound in a formaldehyde-free manner<br>
by means of the binder of the invention, the binder is applied, following<br>
fiberization of a molten mineral material, on the fibers while they are still hot, and<br>
the mineral wool product with the applied binder is subjected to a curing process.<br>
Here the binder is applied on the fibers in the chute by spraying the fibers<br>
attenuated from the molten mineral material, in particular sprayed on.<br>
A bound mineral wool product manufactured in accordance with the method<br>
of the invention satisfies any mechanical and chemical requirements just like a<br>
mineral wool product bound by using classical phenol-formaldehyde resin.<br><br>
Practical examples<br>
The commercially available phenolic resins reduced in formaldehyde were tested<br>
on the finished product in accordance with current testing methods. The results<br>
were compared with those of a standard phenolic resin. The approaches chosen<br>
here shall be set forth by way of the following examples and only represent a small<br>
selection of the test results. As will readily be evident to the person having skill in<br>
the art, the used substances may be varied in an extraordinary breadth; what is<br>
important for the trapping of formaldehyde are solely the pH value and the<br>
reactivity of the aromatic substances used. The used resorcin may very easily be<br>
replaced with similarly reactive systems such as pyrocatechol, pyrrole or<br>
thiophene. Reactivity may conveniently be controlled through the acid-base ratio.<br>
Activation of the silane is possible both through the intermediary of carbonyl<br>
compounds and heterocyclic Systems such as phthalimide. By the addition of<br>
replenishable raw materials such as molasse it is possible to additionally improve<br>
the processing friendliness of the resins.<br>
In the named binders a target concentration of approx. 40% total solid matter was<br>
generally aspired.<br>
Comparative example<br>
Binder 1 - Standard comparative example: A typical alkali-catalyzed phenolic resin<br>
having a total solid matter content of 44% was used. Composition: 150 kg of<br>
phenolic resin; 35.5 kg of urea; 1.0 kg of ammonium sulfate; 2.0 kg of ammonia<br>
solution (25%); 25.8 kg of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (2%); 44.6 kg of water.<br>
The free formaldehyde content 6 hours after addition of the urea was approx. 0.5%<br>
(mass).<br>
Activation of the silane<br>
In the following practical examples of the invention, the following general<br>
prescription for the representation of an activated silane is valid:<br>
In a vat including a mechanical stirrer of a suitable size, a part of the dilution water<br>
is initially charged. Then the corresponding quantity of the carbonyl compound is<br>
added and stirred until complete dissolution. In the case of compounds poorly<br><br>
soluble in water, careful heating is performed, or a dispersant is added under<br>
vigorous stirring. The silane is added to the solution, and then stirring is continued<br>
until a distinct change of color of the solution. A more intense coloration indicates<br>
the formation of the imine as activated silane. The silane thus activated is added to<br>
the binder batch. Following homogeneization, the binder is ready for use.<br>
Example 1<br>
Binder 2: A commercially available, non-neutralized phenolic resin having a total<br>
solid matter of 43.5% and a proportion of free formaldehyde of approx. 1% (mass)<br>
was used.<br>
Composition: 150 kg of phenolic resin; 4.7 kg of resorcin; 0.2 kg of glycolic acid; 0.3<br>
kg of ethanolamine; 0.4 kg of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane; 0.2 kg of<br>
dihydroxyacetone; 21.3 kg of water.<br>
The pH value of the finished binder is approx. 8.<br>
Example 2<br>
Binder 3: A commercially available, non-neutralized phenolic resin having a total<br>
solid matter of 46.5% and a proportion of free formaldehyde of approx. 2% (mass)<br>
was used.<br>
Composition: 150 kg of phenolic resin; 11.7 kg of resorcin; 0.4 kg of phloroglucin;<br>
0.2 kg of glycolic acid; 0.7 kg of ethanolamine; 0.4 kg of 3-<br>
aminopropyltriethoxysilane; 0.2 kg of dihydroxyacetone; 43.2 kg of water.<br>
The pH value of the finished binder is approx. 8.<br>
Example 3<br>
Binder 4: A commercially available, non-neutralized phenolic resin having a total<br>
solid matter of 46.5% and a proportion of free formaldehyde of approx. 2% was<br>
used.<br>
Composition: 150 kg of phenolic resin; 11.2 kg of resorcin; 0.4 kg of phloroglucin;<br>
27.9 kg of turnip molasse; 0.2 kg of glycolic acid; 0.8 kg of ethanolamine; 0.5 kg of<br><br>
3-aminopropyitriethoxysilane; 0.3 kg of dihydroxyacetone; 68.1 kg of water.<br>
The pH value of the finished binder is approx. 8.<br>
Performance of quality tests<br>
1. Laboratory tests<br>
1.1 Decrease of the free formaldehyde content<br>
Initially, the decrease of free formaldehyde following the addition of phloroglucin<br>
and resorcin, respectively, is shown in the binders 2 - 4 in comparison with the<br>
standard binder 1 (Table 1).<br><br>
2. Tests with mineral wool product manufactured with the binders In<br>
accordance with the Invention<br>
With the above binders in accordance with Examples 1 to 3, mineral wool products<br>
were manufactured wherein the binder is sprayed in the usual manner, following<br>
fiberization of the molten material, e.g. in accordance with the blast drawing<br>
process, inside the chute on the fibers while they are still hot.<br>
The obtained products were then subjected to a series of examinations that are<br>
described in the following. What was generally tested was a fagade insulation<br>
board having a target bulk density of 75 kg/m3 and a target loss due to burning of<br>
3.7%.<br><br>
2-1 Adhesion strength of insulation materials in accordance with German Industrial<br>
Standard FDIN1 52274 / EN 1607 before and after autoclavina<br>
From a finished product, parallelepipedic test samples are cut with an edge length<br>
of 200 x 200 mm. Half of the test samples thus obtained are bonded between two<br>
steel plates provided with eyelets and torn apart by means of a suitable apparatus.<br>
The other part is aged in air saturated with water vapor during 15 min. at 105°C<br>
and subsequently torn apart in the same way. The measured tearing forces<br>
provide an indication of the strength of the overall system glass fibers-resin after<br>
manufacture and of its resistance under normal conditions of use. In the case of<br>
standard products of this class without hydrophobizing agents, residual strengths<br>
around 60% after autoclaving are normal. The results are summarized in Table 2.<br><br>
2.2 Adhesion strength in accordance with DIN 52274 / EN 1607 of insulation<br>
materials according to Nordtest<br>
For performing these tests, test samples having an edge length of 200 x 200 mm<br>
are cut from a finished product. One part of the test samples is torn in analogy with<br>
the autoclave test before ageing. The other part is stored in accordance with the<br>
provision of the Nordtest during 7 days at 70°C and 95% relative humidity,<br>
Following re-drying, the strength of the aged sample bodies is determined by<br>
tearing apart. An accurately manufactured insulation material should have a<br>
residual strength of at least 50% after this very drastic ageing method. The results<br>
are represented in Table 3.<br>
Table 3: Adhesion strength in accordance with PIN 52274 / EN 1607 of insulation<br>
materials according to Nordtest<br><br><br>
Thus the performed tests confirm that the composition in accordance with the<br>
invention is not only fundamentally suited as a formaldehyde-free binder for the<br>
manufacture of mineral wool, but also practically applicable in accordance with<br>
determined product quality, processing capability, and economy. The existing<br>
machine equipment need not be modified.<br><br>
