Priority Claim: This Application claims priority to Croatian patent application HR<br>
P20030324 filed April 24, 2003 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to: a) new compounds represented by the structure I:<br><br>
wherein M represents a macrolide subunit derived from macrolides, possessing the<br>
property of accumulation in inflammatory cells, D represents either a steroid subunit<br>
or nonsteroidal subunit derived from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID),<br>
and L represents a chain linking M and D; b) their pharmacologically acceptable salts<br>
and solvates; c) processes and intermediates for their preparation and d) their activity<br>
and use in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and conditions in humans and<br>
animals. Specifically the macrolide subunit is an azithromycin aglycone subunit and<br>
the linkage to D is effected via the linker L through the nitrogen at position 9a of the<br>
aglycone subunit.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Anti-inflammatory medicaments can be classified into those of steroid and of<br>
nonsteroidal type. Steroid anti-inflammatory compounds are still the most effective<br>
ones in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and conditions such as: asthma,<br>
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory nasal diseases such as allergic<br>
rhinitis, nasal polyps, intestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease, colitis, ulcerative<br>
colitis, dermatological inflammations such as eczema, psoriasis, allergic dermatitis,<br>
neurodermatitis, pruritis, conjunctivitis and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to<br>
excellent potency and effectiveness, medicaments of this type also possess numerous<br>
unfavourable side-effects, (e.g. disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism, decreased<br>
calcium resorption, decreased excretion of endogenous corticosteroids and<br>
disturbance of physiological functions of the pituitary gland, adrenal cortex and<br>
thymus. Steroids present on the market are highly effective against inflammatory<br>
conditions and processes whereas their systemic side-effects are diminished. Patent<br>
applications WO 94/13690; 94/14834; 92/13872 and 92/13873 describe the so-called<br>
"soft" steroids or hydrolysable corticosteroids designed for topical application at the<br>
inflammation site, whereas their systemic side-effects are diminished due to the<br>
hydrolysis in the serum, wherein the active steroid very rapidly hydrolyses into the<br>
inactive form. An ideal steroid, however, without unfavourable effects in a long-term<br>
and continuous treatment as required for the control of diseases such as asthma or<br>
Crohn's disease has yet to be found, so that there are intense efforts on the discovery<br>
and development of steroids with improved therapeutic profile.<br>
Macrolide antibiotics accumulate preferentially within different cells of subjects,<br>
especially within phagocyte cells such as mononuclear peripheral blood cells, and<br>
peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. (Gladue, R. P. et al, Antimicrob. Agents<br>
Chemother. 1989, 33, 277-282; Olsen, K. M. et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.<br>
1996, 40, 2582-2585). Inflammatory effects of some macrolides have been described<br>
in the literature, although their effects are relatively weak. For example, the anti-<br>
inflammatory effect of erythromycin derivatives (J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1998, 41,<br>
37-46; WO Patent Application No. 00/42055) and azithromycin derivatives has been<br>
described (EP Pat. Br. 0283055). Anti-inflammatory effects of some macrolides are<br>
also known from in vitro and in vivo studies in experimental animal models such as in<br>
zymosan-induced peritonitis in mice (J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992, 30, 339-348)<br>
and endotoxin-induced neutrophil accumulation in rat trachea (J. Immunol. 1997, 159,<br>
3395-4005). The modulating effect of macrolides upon cytokines such as interleukin 8<br>
(IL-8) (Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med. 1997, 156, 266-271) and interleukin 5 (IL-5)<br>
(EP Pat. Br. 0775489 and EP Pat. Br. 771564) is known as well.<br>
HR Patent Application No. 20010018, WO 04/005309, WO 04/005310 and WO<br>
02/05531 herein incorporated by reference in their entireties describe compounds of<br>
the form:<br><br>
wherein M represents a macrolide subunit possessing the property of accumulation in<br>
inflammatory cells, A represents an anti-inflammatory subunit which can be steroid or<br>
nonsteroidal and L represents a chain linking M and A, and improved therapeutic<br>
action of these compounds in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and conditions<br>
The macrolide portion of the conjugate has always one or two sugar moities<br>
Compounds in which the steroid or nonsteroidal subunit are linked to the macrolide<br>
subunit, via the macrolide nitrogen having only the aglycone moiety, without sugar<br>
substituents either in C/3 or C/5 position, also possessing the earlier mentioned<br>
therapeutic action, have hitherto not been described.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A characteristic of compounds represented by Formula I is selective accumulation in<br>
target organs and cells in the above mentioned inflammatory diseases and conditions.<br>
These pharmacokinetic properties, enable the compounds represented by Formula I to<br>
act at the inflammation site in inflammation cells by inhibiting the production of<br>
inflammation mediators. In such a manner, the unfavourable systemic side-effects of<br>
corticosteroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory molecules are avoided and the<br>
therapeutic action of either the steroid or the NSAID moiety is targeted to the area<br>
where it is most needed. Following local or systemic application molecules rapidly<br>
accumulate in inflammation cells wherein they act by inhibiting the production of<br>
cytokines and chemokines and/or other inflammatory mediators thus suppressing the<br>
inflammation.<br>
According to the known and established state of the art, compounds represented by<br>
Formula I, which are the object of the present invention, their pharmacologically<br>
acceptable salts, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and processes for<br>
malting them have hitherto not been described. None of the compounds which are the<br>
object of the present invention has been described either as anti-inflammatory<br>
substance or as an inhibitor of eosinophilic accumulation in inflammation tissues.<br>

The present invention also relates to such intermediates.<br>
The term "salts" can include acid addition salts or addition salts of free bases.<br>
Examples of acids which may be employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salts include but are not limited to salts derived from nontoxic inorganic<br>
acids such as nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, or hydrobromic, hydroiodic, hydrofluoric,<br>
phosphorous, as well as salts derived from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic<br>
mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydtoxyl alkanoic<br>
acids, alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfom'c acids, and<br>
acetic, maleic, succinic, or citric acids. Non-limiting examples of such salts include<br>
napadisylate, besylate, sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate,<br>
phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate,<br>
pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, trifluoroacetate, propionate,<br>
caprylate, isobutyrate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate,<br>
maleate, mandelate, bcnzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate,<br>
phthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, phenylacetate, citrate, lactate, maleate,<br>
tartrate, methanesulfonate, and the like. Also contemplated are salts of amino acids<br>
such as arginate and the like and gluconate, galacturonate (see, for example, Berge S.<br>
M. et al. "Pharmaceutical Salts," J. of Phanna. Sci., 1977; 66:1).<br>
The acid addition salts of said basic compounds are prepared by contacting the<br>
free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce the salt in the<br>
conventional manner. The free base form may be regenerated by contacting the salt<br>
form with a base and isolating the free base in the conventional manner. The free base<br>
forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties<br>
such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their<br>
respective free base for purposes of the present invention.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts are formed with metals or<br>
amines, such as alkali and alkaline earth metals or organic amines. Examples of<br>
metals used as cations are sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and the like.<br>
Examples of suitable amines are N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine,<br>
choline, diethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine,<br>
and procaine.<br>
The base addition salts of said acidic compounds are prepared by contacting<br>
the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in<br>
the conventional manner. The free acid form may be regenerated by contacting the<br>
salt form with an acid and isolating the free acid in the conventional manner.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable", as used in connection with<br>
compositions of the invention, refers to molecular entities and other ingredients of<br>
such compositions that are physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce<br>
untoward reactions when administered to a mammal (e.g., human). Preferably, as<br>
used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved by a regulatory<br>
agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or<br>
other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in mammals, and more particularly<br>
in humans.<br>
The term "carrier" applied to pharmaceutical compositions of the invention<br>
refers to a diluent, excipient, or vehicle with which an active compound is<br>
administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water,<br>
saline solutions, aqueous dextrose solutions, aqueous glycerol solutions, and oils,<br>
including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil,<br>
soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. However, since memantine is highly<br>
soluble, aqueous solutions are preferred. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are<br>
described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" by E.W. Martin, 18th Edition.<br>
Particularly preferred for the present invention are carriers suitable for immediate-<br>
release, i.e., release of most or all of the active ingredient over a short period of time,<br>
such as 60 minutes or less, and make rapid absorption of the drug possible.<br>
The present invention also encompasses solvates (preferably hydrates) formed by the<br>
compounds represented by Formula I or their salts.<br>
The present invention also relates to all possible tautomeric forms which can be<br>
formed by individual compounds of Formula I.<br>
The present invention also encompasses prodrugs of Formula I compounds,<br>
i.e., compounds which release an active parent drug according to Formula (I) in vivo<br>
when administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of a compound of Formula I are<br>
prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound of Formula I in<br>
such a way that the modifications may be cleaved in vivo to release the parent<br>
compound. Prodrugs include compounds of Formula I wherein a hydroxy, amino, or<br>
carboxy group of a Formula I compound is bonded to any group that may be cleaved<br>
in vivo to regenerate the free hydroxyl, amino or carboxy group, respectively.<br>
Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to esters (e.g., acetate, formate, and<br>
benzoate derivatives) of compounds of Formula I.<br>
The compounds of Formula I have one or more chirality centers and, depending on<br>
the nature of individual substituents, they can also have geometrical isomers. Isomers<br>
that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "stereoisomers".<br>
Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereomers"<br>
and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed<br>
"enantiomers". When a compound has a cliiral center, a pair of enantiomers is<br>
possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its<br>
asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and<br>
Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light<br>
and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (-)-isomer<br>
respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either an individual enantiomer or as a<br>
mixture of enantiomers. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is<br>
called a "racemic mixture". The present invention encompasses all individual isomers<br>
of compounds of Formula I. The description or naming of a particular compound in<br>
the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and<br>
mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. Methods for the determination of<br>
stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" means an excipient that is useful in<br>
preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither<br>
biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes an excipient that is acceptable for<br>
veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipient" as used in the present application includes both one and more than one<br>
such excipient.<br>
"Treating" or "treatment" of a state, disorder or condition includes:<br>
(1) preventing or delaying the appearance of clinical symptoms of the state, disorder<br>
or condition developing in a mammal that may be afflicted with or predisposed to the<br>
state, disorder or condition but does not yet experience or display clinical or<br>
subclinical symptoms of the state, disorder or condition,<br>
(2) inhibiting the state, disorder or condition, i.e., arresting or reducing the<br>
development of the disease or at least one clinical or subclinical symptom thereof, or<br>
(3) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the state, disorder or condition or<br>
at least one of its clinical or subclinical symptoms.<br>
The benefit to a subject to be treated is either statically significant or at least<br>
perceptible to the patient or to the physician<br>
A "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a compound that, when<br>
administered to a mammal for treating a state, disorder or condition, is sufficient to<br>
effect such treatment. The "therapeutically effective amount" will vary depending on<br>
the compound, the disease and its severity and the age, weight, physical condition and<br>
responsiveness of the mammal to be treated.<br>

Subclinical symptoms include without limitation diagnostic markers for inflammation<br>
the appearance of which may precede the manifestation of clinical symptoms. One<br>
class of subclinical symptoms is immunological symptoms, such as the invasion or<br>
accumulation in an organ or tissue of proinflammatory lymphoid cells or the presence<br>
locally or peripherally of activated pro-inflammatory lymphoid cells recognizing a<br>
pathogen or an antigen specific to the organ or tissue. Activation of lymphoid cells<br>
can be measured by techniques known in the art.<br>
"Delivering" a therapeutically effective amount of an active ingredient to a particular<br>
location within a host means causing a therapeutically effective blood concentration<br>
of the active ingredient at the particular location. This can be accomplished, e.g., by<br>
local or by systemic administration of the active ingredient to the host.<br>
The term host or subject in need thereof as used herein refers to a mammal preferably<br>
a human.<br>
The term leaving group refers to a chemical group which is capable of being displaced<br>
by a nucleophile. Examples of such groups include but are not limited to halogen,<br>
mesylate, tosylate and ester groups.<br>
Methods of Preparation<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to a method for the preparation of<br>
compounds within Formula I comprising:<br>
a) for the compounds of Formula I, wherein X2 is -NH-<br>
a reaction of the steroid or nonsteroidal subunit of the substructure V:<br><br>
(wherein L| represents a leaving group such as hydroxy)<br>
and the amino group of the macrolide subunit of the substructure VIa:<br><br>
VIa<br>
for the compounds of Formula I, wherein X2 represents -O-;<br>
a reaction of the steroid or nonsteroidal subunit of the substructure V<br>
(wherein L1 represents a leaving group such as hydroxy, and the hydroxyl<br>
group of the macrolide subunit of the substructure VIb:<br>
Methods of preparation:<br>
a) A compound within Formula I is prepared by a reaction of a carboxylic acid<br>
of the steroid or nonsteroidal subunit of the substructure V and the amino group of the<br>
macrolide subunit of the substructure Via whereby the amide linkage is effected, and<br>
using the usual derivatives having an activating effect on carboxylic acid such as<br>
mixed anhydrides, especially carbodiimides or benzotriazole. The reaction proceeds<br>
in the presence of a base (preferably an organic base), e.g. triethylamine, at room<br>
temperature under an inert atmosphere, e.g. a nitrogen or argon blanket, over a period<br>
from several hours to several days.<br>
Steroid or nonsteroidal subunits of the substructure V are either commercially<br>
available products or have been obtained, like the starting macrolide subunits of the<br>
substructure Via by methods for preparation of analogous compounds described in<br>
our earlier patent applications (HR Patent Application No. 20010018; WO Patent<br>
Application No. 02/055531); WO 04/005309; WO 04/005310 herein incorporated by<br>
reference in their entireties.<br>
The reaction is generally performed with acid derivatives which have the<br>
ability to activate the carboxylic acid group of steroidal anti-inflammatory subunit,<br>
such as halogenides, mixed anhydrides and especially carbodiimides (such as -(3-<br>
dimethylarninopropyl)-3-ethyl-carbodiimide (EDC)) and benzotriazoles. The reaction<br>
proceeds in the presence of a base, such as an organic base (e.g., triethylamine), at<br>
room temperature under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon. The reaction<br>
may require several hours to several days to come to completion.<br>
For example, when L is -K-NH- (wherein K is the portion of the L molecule<br>
attached to the macrolide) the compound of Formula I can be formed by derivatizing<br>
an NH group on the macrolide ring to an -N-K-(NH2)- group and reacting the<br>
derivatized macrolide with a steroid or nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory subunit<br>
represented by Formula V:<br>
b) Preparation of a compound of Formula I is carried out by a reaction of the<br>
carboxylic acid of the steroid or nonsteroidal subunit of the substructure V and the<br>
hydroxyl group of the macrolide subunit of the substructure VIb whereby the ester<br>
bond is formed, and the reaction proceeds by using carboxylic acid activating agents<br>
such as mixed anhydrides, especially carbodiimides. The reaction proceeds at low<br>
temperatures (preferably -5°C) under an inert atmosphere, e.g. nitrogen or argon<br>
blanket, over the period from several hours to several days.<br>
Starting macrolide subunits of the substructure VIb are compounds described in the<br>
literature or can be prepared by the procedures described for the preparation of<br>
analogous compounds (Costa, A. M. et al., Tetrahedron Letters 2000, 41, 3371-3375).<br>
For example, the reaction of an alkenoyl derivative having the formula<br>
CH2=CH(CH2)mC(O)O-alkyl (preferably methylacrylate) with the secondary nitrogen<br>
atom of the macrolide subunit, yields a chain having an ester group at its end. The<br>
ester group is then reduced with a metal hydride (preferably LiAlH4) in an anhydrous<br>
organic solvent at a lower temperature (preferably 0 °C) to yield an alcohol derivative<br>
of the substructure VIb.<br>
For example, when linkage L is -K-O-, the compound of Formula I can be<br>
formed by (1) derivatizing an NH group on a rnacrolide to an N-K-OH group and (2)<br>
reacting the derivatized macrolide with the free carboxylic acid group on a steroid or<br>
nonsteroidal subunit:<br><br>
The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory subunit D may contain a -C(O)L1 group (such as<br>
a free carboxylic acid group) or be derivatized by methods known in the art.<br>

NSAID-OH +, SUCCINIC ANHYDRIDE NSAID-OC(O)CH2CH2COOH<br>
According to Scheme I, NSAID compounds having a hydroxyl group may<br>
alternatively be derivatized by the action of succinic anhydride in the presence of<br>
pyridine followed by reaction of the intermediate so produced with triethylamine, 4-<br>
pyrrolopyridine in methylene chloride to produce NSAID having free carboxylic acid<br>
group (Huang CM. et al. Chem.&amp;Biol. 2000,7,453-461, Hess S. et al. Bioorg.&amp;Med.<br>
Chem. 2001, 9, 1279-1291) The NSAID derivatives so produced may be coupled<br>
either to a linker macrolide compound such as formula Via or VIb.<br>
Scheme II<br>
According to Scheme II, NSAID compounds having an amino group may<br>
alternatively be derivatized by the action of sodium hydride and tert-butyliodoacetate<br>
in N,N-dimethylforniamide to produce a (butoxy carbonyl derivative of the NSAID<br>
which is then reacted with (trifluoracetic acid in methylene chloride to produce<br>
NSAID having free carboxylic acid group (Hess S. et al. Bioorg.&amp;Med. Chem. 2001,<br>
9, 1279-1291). The NSAID derivatives so produced may be coupled either to a linker<br>
macrolide compound such as formula VIa or VIb.<br>

Alternatively by NSAID compounds having an amino group may be derivatized<br>
according to Scheme III by the action of succinic anhydride in the presence of<br>
dimethylaminopyridine, N,N'-diisopropylethylamine in dimethylformamide to<br>
produce NSAID having free carboxylic acid group (Pandori M. W. et al.<br>
Chem.&amp;Biol. 2002, 9, 567-573). The NSAID derivatives so produced may be coupled<br>
either to a linker macrolide compound such as formula VIa or VIb.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can generally be obtained so that: one end of the chain L is<br>
first linked to the macrolide subunit M, and then the other end of the chain is linked to<br>
the nonsteroidal or steroid subunit D; or one a of the chain L is first linked to the<br>
nonsteroidal or steroid subunit D and then the other end of the chain is linked to the<br>
macrolide subunit M, and, finally, one end of the yet unformed chain is linked to the<br>
macrolide subunit M, and the other end of the also unformed chain is linked to the<br>
nonsteroidal or steroid subunit D, and subsequently the ends are chemically linked to<br>
form the chain L.<br>
To prevent undesirable side-reactions, it is frequently necessary to protect certain<br>
groups such as e.g. a hydroxy or amino group. A comprehensive discussion of the<br>
ways in which such groups may be protected and methods for cleaving the resulting<br>
protected derivatives is given by for example T.W. Greene and P.G.M Wuts in<br>
Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Son, Inc 1991 and by<br>
P..T. Kocienski in Protecting Groups, Georg Thieme Verlag 1994 which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Examples of suitable amino protecting groups<br>
include acyl type protecting groups (e.g. formyl, trifluoroacetyl and acetyl), aromatic<br>
urethane type protecting groups (e.g. ben2yloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and substituted Cbz,<br>
and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)), aliphatic urethane protecting groups (e.g. t-<br>
butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), isopropyloxycarbonyl and cyclohexyloxycarbonyl) and alkyl<br>
type protecting groups (e.g. benzyl, trityl and chlorotrityl). Examples of suitable<br>
oxygen protecting groups may include for example alkyl silyl groups, such as<br>
trimethylsilyl or tert-butyldimethylsilyl; alkyl ethers such as tetrahydropyranyl or tert-<br>
butyl; or esters such as acetate. Hydroxy groups may be protected by reaction of for<br>
example acetic anhydride, benzoic anhydride or a trialkylsilyl chloride in an aprotic<br>
solvent. Examples of aprotic solvents are dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran and the like.<br>
For example, one possibility for the protection of the amino group is phthalimide.<br>
Deprotection using hydrazine is described in the examples.<br>
Corresponding protection for amino and alkylamino groups are groups such as<br>
alkanoyl (acetyl), alkoxycarbonyl (methoxycarbonyl, etoxycarbonyl or tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl), arylmethoxycarbonyl (benzyloxycarbonyl), aroyl (benzoyl) and<br>
alkylsilyl group (trimethylsilyl or trimethylsilyletoxymethyl). The conditions for<br>
elimination of the protective group depend on the selection and properties of that<br>
group. Thus, for example, acyl groups such as alkanoyl, alkoxycarbonyl and aroyl<br>
group can be removed by hydrolysis in the presence of a base (sodium or potassium<br>
hydroxide), tert-butoxycarbonyl or alkylsilyl (trimethylsilyl) group can be removed<br>
with a corresponding acid (for example, hydrochloric, sulphuric, phosphoric or<br>
trifluoroacetic acid), while arylmethoxycarbonyl group (benzyloxycarbonyl) can be<br>
removed by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium-on-<br>
charcoal.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to the methods for using the<br>
compounds of Formula I as anti-inflammatory, anti-anaphylactic and<br>
immunomodulating agents which can be administered in different ways, depending on<br>
the inflammation site, e.g. percutaneously, orally, buccally, rectally, parenterally or by<br>
inhalation when application within the respiratory tract is intended.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to the methods for using the<br>
compounds of Formula I as anti-inflammatory, anti-anaphylactic and<br>
immunomodulating agents which can be administered in different ways, depending on<br>
the inflammation site. Further, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing an effective dose of compounds of the present invention as<br>
well as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as carriers or diluents.<br>
The preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can<br>
include mixing, granulating, tabletting and dissolving the ingredients. Chemical<br>
carriers can be in solid or liquid form. Solid carriers can be lactose, sucrose, talc,<br>
gelatine, agar, pectin, magnesium stearate, fatty acids without limitation. Liquid<br>
earners can be syrups, oils such as olive, sunflower seed or soybean oils, water, or<br>
physiologic saline without limitation. Similarly, carriers may also contain a<br>
component for a sustained release of the active component such as glyceryl<br>
monostearate or glyceryl distearate. Several forms of pharmaceutical compositions<br>
can be prepared. If a solid carrier is used, these forms can include tablets, caplets,<br>
solid gelatinous capsules, powders or granules without limitation that can be<br>
administered orally. The amount of the solid carrier can vary but mainly it is in the<br>
range from 25 mg to 1 g. If a liquid carrier is used, the formulation can be in the form<br>
of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatinous capsules, or sterile injectable liquids, or<br>
nonaqueous liquid suspensions topically or systemically, e.g., orally, parenterally,<br>
percutaneously, mucosally, e.g., buccally, intranasally, intrarectally and<br>
intravaginally. "Parenterally" means by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous<br>
route. The corresponding preparations of the compounds of the present invention can<br>
be used in the prophylaxis as well as in the therapeutic treatment (prevention, delay,<br>
inhibition or relief) of several disorders (diseases and other pathological inflammatory<br>
conditions) caused by or associated with an abnormal or undesirable (excessive,<br>
nonregulated, or dysregulated) inflammatory immune response involving the<br>
production of inflammatory cytokines or other inflammation mediators, including<br>
without limitation TNF-a and IL-1/3. These disorders include autoimmune diseases<br>
such as rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, autoimmune<br>
thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, uveoretinitis, lupus erythematosus, scleroderma; other<br>
arthritic conditions having an inflammatory component such as rheumatoid<br>
spondylitis, osteoarthritis, septic arthritis and polyarthritis; other inflammatory brain<br>
disorders, such as meningitis, Alzheimer's disease, AIDS dementia encephalitis, other<br>
inflammatory eye inflammations, such as retinitis; inflammatory skin disorders, such<br>
as , eczema, other dermatites (e.g., atopic, contact), psoriasis, burns induced by UV<br>
radiation (sun rays and similar UV sources); inflammatory bowel disease, such as<br>
Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis; asthma; other allergy disorders, such as allergic<br>
rhinitis; conditions associated with acute trauma such as cerebral injury following<br>
stroke, heart tissue injury due to myocardial ischemia, lung injury such as that which<br>
occurs in adult respiratory distress syndrome; inflammation accompanying infection,<br>
such as sepsis, septic shock, toxic shock syndrome, other inflammatory conditions<br>
associated with particular organs or tissues , such as nephritis (e.g.,<br>
glomerulonephritis), inflamed appendix, gout, inflamed gall bladder, chronic<br>
obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, Type II diabetes, lung<br>
fibrosis, vascular disease, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis; and alloimmunity<br>
leading to transplant rejection. The compounds can also be administered by<br>
inhalation when application within the respiratory tract is intended. A further object<br>
of the present invention relates to the preparation of various pharmaceutical forms of<br>
the compounds to achieve the optimal bioavailability of the active compound of<br>
Formula I.<br>
For percutaneous or mucosal external administration, the compound of<br>
Formula I can be prepared in a form of an ointment or cream, gel or lotion.<br>
Ointments, creams and gels can be formulated using a water or oil base with addition<br>
of an appropriate emulsifier or gelling agent Formulation of the present compounds<br>
is especially significant for respiratory inhalation, wherein the compound of Formula<br>
I is to be delivered in the form of an aerosol under pressure. It is preferred to<br>
micronize the compound of Formula I after it has been homogenised, e.g., in lactose,<br>
glucose, higher fatty acids, sodium salt of dioctylsulfosuccinic acid or, most<br>
preferably, in carboxymethyl cellulose, in order to achieve a microparticle size of 5<br>
um or less for the majority of particles. For the inhalation formulation, the aerosol<br>
can be mixed with a gas or a liquid propellant for dispensing the active substance. An<br>
inhaler or atomizer or nebulizer may be used. Such devices are known. See, e.g.,<br>
Newman et al., Thorax, 19S5, 40:61-676 Berenberg, M., J. Asthma USA, 1985,<br>
22:87-92. A Bird nebulizer can also be used. See also U.S. Patents 6,402,733;<br>
6,273,086; and 6,228,346.<br>
The compound of the structure I for inhalation is preferably formatted in the<br>
form of a dry powder with micronized particles, as described herein.<br>
The compound can also be incorporated into a formulation for treating<br>
inflammation localized in an organ or tissue, e.g., Crohn's disease, where it can be<br>
administered orally or rectally. Formulations for oral administration can incorporate<br>
excipients enabling bioavailability of the compound at the site of inflammation. This<br>
can be achieved by different combinations of enteric and delayed release<br>
formulations. The compound of Formula 1 can also be used in the treatment of<br>
Crohn's disease and intestinal inflammation disease if the compound is applied in the<br>
form of a clyster, for which a suitable formulation can be used, as is well known in<br>
the field.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the present invention<br>
can be determined by methods known in the art. Since the compound of the present<br>
invention is more efficiently delivered to the desired site than the corresponding anti-<br>
inflammatory steroid or NSAID drug alone, a lesser amount of the compound on a<br>
molar basis than of the steroid or NSAID anti-inflammatory drug can be administered<br>
while still achieving the same therapeutic effect. Furthermore, since administration of<br>
the compound results in fewer side effects than with the corresponding steroid or<br>
NSAID anti-inflammatory drug, the steroid or NSAID amount can be increased.<br>
Thus, the table below serves only as a guide. A threshold therapeutically effective<br>
amount of the compound, a pharmaceutically salt thereof, a solvate thereof, or a<br>
prodrug thereof is generally equal to or less than a therapeutically effective amount of<br>
the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug on a molar basis. Broad and preferred<br>
effective amounts of the compound, a pharmaceutically salt thereof, a solvate thereof,<br>
or a prodrug thereof are shown in the table below.<br>
For example, if the preferred amount range for prednisone is 1-50 mg/day, this<br>
corresponds to a range of 2.79 µmol to 139.5 µmol per day. The starting amount<br>
range for a hybrid steroid-macrolide conjugate according to the invention will be also<br>
2.79 µmol to 139.5 µnol of conjugate per day. This dosage can be fine-tuned in light<br>
of the present specification using the ordinary skill in the act.<br>
The efficacy of the present compounds can be assessed by any method for<br>
assessing inflammation or anti-inflammatory effect. There are many known methods<br>
for this.purpose including without limitation use of contrast ultrasound in conjunction<br>
with injection of microbubbles, measurement of inflammatory cytokines (such as<br>
TNF-a, IL-1, IFN-7) measurement of activated immune system cells (activated T<br>
cells, cytotoxic T cells specifically recognizing the inflamed or transplanted tissue) as<br>
well as by observation (reduction of oedema reduction of erythema, reduction of<br>
pruritus or burning sensation, reduction of body temperature, improvement in function<br>
of the afflicted organ) as well as any of the methods provided below as well as any of<br>

well plate (Falcon) in DMEM medium (Life Technologies) with 10% FBS<br>
(Biowhitaker) and cultivated to a 70% confluence at 37 °C in an atmosphere with 5%<br>
CO2. The medium was removed and 1 )µg of DNA, 7 µl of PLUS reagent and 2 µl of<br>
Lipofectamin (Life Technologies) in 500 µl of DMEM were added per well. The cells<br>
were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere with 5% CO2 and after 5 hours the same<br>
volume of 20% FBS/DMEM was added. After 24 hours, the medium was completely<br>
changed. 4S hours after transfection, the test compounds in different concentrations<br>
and 24 nM [3H]dexamethazone (Pharmacia) in DMEM medium were added. The cells<br>
were incubated for 90 minutes at 37 °C in an atmosphere with 5% CO2, washed three<br>
times with PBS buffer (Sigma) cooled to 4 °C (pH=7,4), and then lysed in Tris buffer<br>
(pH=8,0) (Sigma) with 0.2% of SDS (Sigma). After the addition of UltimaGold XR<br>

Apoptosis Induction<br>
In a 96-well plate, triplicates of test steroid dilution in RPMI medium (Institute of<br>
Immunology, Zagreb) with 10% FBS were performed. To the solutions of<br>
compounds, 20000 cells per well were added and incubated overnight at 37 °C in an<br>
atmosphere with 5% CO2, then 1 µCi of [3H]thymidine (Pharmacia) was added and<br>
the mixture was incubated for additional 3 hours. The cells were harvested by<br>
applying a vacuum over GF/C filter (Packard). Onto each well, 30 µl of Microscynt O<br>
scintillation liquid (Packard) was added and the incorporated radioactivity was<br>
measured on a (3-scintillation counter (Packard). The specificity of apoptosis<br>
induction by glucocorticoids was proven by antagonizing the proliferation inhibition<br>

concanavalin-A in the same concentration of. Cells were incubated for 72 hours at 37<br>
°C, 95% humidity and in an atmosphere with 5% CO2. Until determination of<br>
cytokines, the cells were frozen at -70 °C.<br>
Cytokines interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and interferon y were determined by the specific<br>
ELISA method, according to manufacturer's recommendations (R&amp;D).<br>
Inhibition (as percentage) was calculated using the following formula:<br>
%inh=(l-concentration of cytokines in sample/concentration of cytokins in positive<br>
control)* 100<br>
Compounds 1-5, 6 and 8 inhibit the production of cytokines in concentrations from 1<br>

Model of Lung Eosinophilia in Mice<br>
Male Balb/C mice with a body weight of 20-25 g were randomly divided into groups,<br>
and sensitised by an i.p. injection of ovalbumin (OVA, Sigma) on day zero and day<br>
fourteen. On the twentieth day, the mice were subjected to a challenge test by i.n.<br>
(intranasal) application of OVA (positive control or test groups) or PBS (negative<br>
control). 48 hours after i.n. application of OVA, the animals were anaesthetized and<br>
the lungs were rinsed with 1 mL of PBS. The cells were separated on Cytospin 3<br>
cytocentrifuge (Shandon). The cells were stained in Diff-Quick (Dade) and the<br>
percentage of eosinophils was determined by differential counting of at least 100<br>
cells.<br>
Fluticasone (GlaxoWellcome) and beclomethasone (Pliva d.d.) were used as standard<br>
substances, with positive and negative control.<br>
The compounds were administered daily i.n. or i.p. in different doses 2 days before<br>
the challenge test and up to the completion of the test.<br>
Compounds 1 and 2 statistically significantly reduced (t-test, p
eosinophils in the lung rinse with respect to positive control.<br>
Cold Stress Model<br>
Male Wistar rats with a body weight of 200 - 250 g (our own breeding) were<br>
randomly divided into groups. The carrier (lactose) in the volume of 0.5 mL/100 g s.c.<br>
was applied to the negative and positive control group. Test substances and the<br>
standard were applied once daily over three days in the dose of 2 mg/kg in the volume<br>
of 0.5 mL/100 g of body weight. The standard was applied in the dose of 1 mg/kg, in<br>
the volume of 0.5 mL/100 g of body weight.<br>
On day three, 2 hours after the last treatment, all animals, except for the negative<br>
control group, were subjected to cold stress at 4 C for 1 hour. After the stress, the<br>
animals were anaesthetized with thiopental (Pliva d.d.) and blood from all animals<br>
was drawn on K2 EDTA into test tubes. Plasma samples were frozen at -70 C.<br>
Corticosteronc levels were determined by fluorimetric method according to Silber.<br>
Thymuses were removed from animals and weighed, and their weights were<br>
compared with the negative and positive control. Standards, fluticasone<br>
(GlaxoWellcome) and budesonide (Steraloids), statistically significantly reduced<br>
corticosterone plasma levels and reduced the weight of the thyrnus (P
Corticosterone levels and thymus weights for compound 1 were on the level of those<br>
of the control group of animals subjected to stress.<br>
