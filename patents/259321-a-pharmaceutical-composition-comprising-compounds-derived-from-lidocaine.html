Method for the reactive coloration of leather<br>
The present invention relates to a process for dyeing leather and to novel dyes which are particularly useful for reactive dyeing of leather.<br>
Tanned leather is currently dyed with acidic dyes, direct dyes, sulfur dyes or basic dyes. It is difficult to achieve high color intensities and high color stabilities, especially wet- and perspirationfastnesses, with these dyes, in fact impossible to this day to a satisfactory standard for medium to high depths of shade.<br>
To improve wet- and perspirationfastness, the leather is frequently treated with cationic complexing agents which complex the dye and thus reduce its solubility on contact with water. However, the wet*, perspiration- and rubfastnesses which are achievable are still inadequate for intensive shades. Furthermore, leather articles fabricated therefrom tend to mark off in use. The achievement of high fastnesses at medium to high depths of shade also requires a very careful dye selection and that the dye used be coordinated with the leather assistants used, and also suitable fatliquoring agents and choice of retanning material. Moreover, achievement of desired fastnesses generally requires that the dye and the fatliquor and also, in some cases, the retanning agent be applied in separate floats; the requisite float changes prolong the overall process and entail more wastewater.<br>
The dyeing operation with a conventional leather dye in an aqueous acidic medium is consequently complex, longwinded and costly owing to the different process steps and the chemicals used. Furthermore, these measures do not constitute a fundamental solution to the fastness problems desC1-ibed above. The reason for this is that the conventional dyes used are bound to the leather via ionic interactions. The action of aqueous alkaline solutions, such as for example wash liquors or in perspirationfastness tests, destroys the ionic bond between leather and dye, so that the dye becomes detached from the leather and stains surrounding materials, for example adjacent fabrics.<br>
Various attempts have been made to improve the color- and wetfastness of dyed leather by reactive dyeing. Reactive dyeing refers to the use of dyes which have functional groups capable of forming a covalent chemical bond with the functional groups of leather.<br>
For instance, T.C. Mullen in the Leather Manufacturer 1964,18, and in J. Soc. Leather, Trades, Chem. 46,1962, 162, and also M.L. Fein et al. in J. Am. Leather Chem. Assoc. 65,1970, 584-591, desC1-ibe the use of reactive dyes having a dichlorotriazine group as reactive moiety. However, the reported yields of fixation, i.e. the fraction of a chemically<br><br>
bound dye, are only moderate at about 70 to 75% and do not solve the problems desC1-ibed above. Moreover, the technique is limited to chrome-tanned leather.<br>
To overcome these disadvantages, DE-A 3529294 proposes using dyes for leather dyeing which have at least one 1,3,5-triazinyl group to which a substituent having a quaternary nitrogen atom is attached. However, assignee studies on N-acetyllysine as a model system have shown that, under the dyeing conditions desC1-ibed there, there is no significant formation of covalent bonds between the dye and the amino group of N-acetyllysine.<br>
K. Rosenbusch et al. Das Leder 19, 1962, 284, desC1-ibes the use of disazo dyes which have a vinyl sulfone group, or a group from which a vinyl sulfone group is released under the action of alkalis, for dyeing chamois leather. Adequate fixation, however, requires long dyeing times at pH 10. Owing to the dyeing conditions employed, i.e., high pH in conjunction with long dyeing times of 7 h or more, this process can only be used for dyeing chamois leather, which is known to be stable to alkaline. With other leather varieties, the dyeing conditions desC1-ibed cause damage to the leather. Assignee studies have shown, moreover, that satisfactory fixation is not achieved with dyes of this type.<br>
Anionic polyazo dyes (having 3 or more azo groups) which have a vinyl sulfone group, or a group from which a vinyl sulfone group is released under the action of alkalis, have variously been desC1-ibed. These anionic azo dyes are primarily used for dyeing paper or textile fibers. EP-A 518226 and JP 05246977 propose such dyes for the dyeing of leather as well, but without desC1-ibing any leather dyeing in conC1-ete terms.<br>
DE-A 19825202 desC1-ibes the dyeing of leather with anionic polyazo dyes at neutral to acidic pH values. The color- and migrationfastnesses of the leather thus dyed are not satisfactory, however.<br>
In summary, existing processes for dyeing leather with reactive dyes do not provide good fixation yields of 85% or higher at medium to high depths of shade. The fixation yields of 70 to 75% achieved in the prior art are not sufficient for high wet- and perspirationfastnesses and good migration stability since the unattached dye has to be laboriously washed off to solve the problems desC1-ibed here. The disadvantages which are desC1-ibed here of dyeing leather with reactive dyes are also pointed out in The Leather Manufacturer 1964,18-23. No surprise therefore that dyeing leather with reactive dyes has not become established. On the contrary, the search is on today for different ways of bonding dyes covalently in leather, for example by pretreating the leather with polyfunctional aldehydes which have at least one reactive group capable of reacting with a reactive group of the dye by forming a bond (see DE 100 44 642 A1)<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for dyeing leather to high fastnesses, especially wet-, perspiration- and rubfastnesses and also a high migrationfastness, even at medium and high depths of shade (color intensities). The process shall be able to be conducted under conditions leading to little if any leather damage.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved, surprisingly, on using anionic polyazo dyes F, which have at least 3 azo groups (N=N groups) and at least one functional group in the hereinbelow defined formula A, in an aqueous float at pH 8 or higher. In fact, dyeing and fixation proceeds so rapidly under these conditions that a short dyeing time of 4 h or less is sufficient to achieve adequate color intensity and a high fixation of 85% or more.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a process for dyeing leather with at least one dye F which has at least one alkaline-activable group of the formula A;<br><br>
where<br>
denotes the bond to the rest of the dye molecule; X is halogen, C1-C4-alkyl or C1-C4-alkoxy, k is 0,1, 2 or 3, n is 0 or 1 and B is a CH=CH2 group or a CH2-CH2-Q group, where Q is an alkaline-detachable<br>
group,<br>
which comprises treating the leather with an aqueous float comprising at least one dye F at a pH of not less than 8, generally in the range from 8 to 11, preferably in the range from 8.5 to 10.5 and specifically in the range from 8.5 to 10.<br>
Here and hereinbelow, alkyl generally denotes a linear or branched hydrocarbyl radical having 1 to 6 and preferably having 1 to 4 carbon atoms (C1-C6-alkyl and C1-C4-alkyl respectively) such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and the like. Haloalkyl denotes alkyl as defined above wherein the hydrogen atoms are wholly or partly replaced by<br><br>
halogen atoms, especially by fluorine atoms, as in trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, pentafluoroethyl and the like. Alkoxy denotes an alkyl radical as defined above that is attached via an oxygen atom. Optionally substituted phenyl signifies that the phenyl radical may comprise one or more, for example 1, 2, 3 or 4, substituents which are selected for example from halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, nitro, cyano, COOH, S03H and the like. Halogen represents in particular fluorine, chlorine or bromine.<br>
The variable k is preferably 0,1 or 2; that is, the A radical comprises 0, 1 or 2 radicals X. Preferably n in the formula A is 0; that is, the radical A derives from benzene. When n is 1, the radical A derives from naphthalene. In these cases, the S02-B group can be situated on the same benzene nucleus as the at least one X group or on the other benzene nucleus.<br>
An alkaline-detachable group Q is to be understood as meaning radicals which are detached under alkaline conditions, i.e., at pH 7.5 or higher, through elimination to form a vinyl sulfone group. Examples of such groups are halogen, for example chlorine, bromine or iodine, -0-S03H, -S-S03H, quaternary ammonium radicals such as tri-C1-C4-alkylammonium, benzyldi-C1-C4-aIkylammonium or N-attached pyridinium and also radicals of the formulae RaS(0)2-, RbS(0)2-0-, RcC(0)-0-. In these formulae Ra, Rb and Rc are independently alkyl, haloalkyl or optionally substituted phenyl, although Rc may also be hydrogen. Q is preferably an -0-(CO)CH3 group and especially an -0-S03H group.<br>
According to the invention, B in formula A is preferably CH=CH2, a CH2-CH2-0-C(0)CH3 group or a CH2-CH2-0-S03H group. More particularly, the radical A is selected from the following radicals A1 to A6:<br><br>
Particular preference among these is given to dyes wherein at least one A radical has<br><br>
the formula A1, A2, A3 or A4 and in particular the formula A1 or A2.<br>
Advantageously, the dye used in the process of the invention comprises 1, 2 or 3, and preferably 1 or 2 of the aforementioned A radicals. This radical A can but need not be part of the dye chromophore and is preferably attached to the dye molecule via an -NH-or-N=N-group.<br>
According to the present invention, the dye F is anionic, i.e., it has at least one, for example 1 to 10 and especially 2 to 8, anionic or acidic functional groups per dye molecule. These groups endow the dye F with solubility in water under weakly acidic, neutral or alkaline conditions. These groups are in particular anionic or acidic functional groups which dissociate in an aqueous medium at above pH 4, to form anionic groups. Examples of such groups are hydroxysulfonyl groups (-S03H), carboxyl groups (COOH) and hydroxysulfonyloxy groups (-0-S03H) and also the anions of these groups, at least one and in particular at least two of these groups preferably being hydroxysulfonyl groups. When these groups are present as anionic groups in the dye F, it will be appreciated that the dye also comprises the counterions necessary for neutralization. Suitable counterions are in particular alkali metal ions, specifically sodium, potassium and lithium ions and also ammonium ions, for example ammonium ions derived from mono-, di- or triethanolamine.<br>
The process of the invention may also be carried out using metal complexes, preferably transition metal complexes, of the aforementioned dyes F, especially complexes of transition metals of the groups 6 to 10 of the periodic table and of these especially Cu, C1-, Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, Zn and Cd. The molar ratio of transition metal to dye molecule in these metal complexes is customarily in the range from 2:1 to 1:2. In general, in these dyes, the metal ions are complexed not via the aforementioned anionic groups but via deprotonated hydroxyl groups, via amino groups, imino groups, nitrogen atoms incorporated in an aromatic n-electron system, or via azo groups.<br>
Such dyes F are known from the prior art cited in the introduction and from DE-A196 48 939 or can be prepared analogously to known methods of making structurally similar dyes, as known in the prior art cited herein and also from EP 602 562, EP-A 597 411, EP-A 592 105 or DE 43 196 74.<br>
Dyes F are generally prepared by initially diazotizing an amino compound of the formula B<br><br><br>
and then coupling it onto an appropriate dye intermediate. The reaction product obtained when reacting the amino compound B or its diazonium salt with the dye intermediate can already be the dye F or in turn constitute a dye F intermediate which is further processed to the dye F analogously to known processes. Alternatively, a compound B may be reacted with a dye intermediate which comprises a nucleophilically displaceable group, in a conventional manner. Examples of nucleophilically displaceable groups are halogen, especially chlorine or bromine, that is attached to an aromatic as in halotriazine radicals, or is present in the form of a halosulfonyl group or of a halocarbonyl group. Processes for this purpose are known from the prior art cited herein or can be applied analogously to the preparation of dyes F.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the dye F is an azo dye and preferably an azo dye selected from the dyes of the general formulae I to VII and their metal complexes:<br>

X represents in particular -S02-NR- and more preferably -S02-NH-.<br>
The azo dyes of the general formulae I to VII which are used according to the invention and their metal complexes are prepared in a conventional manner involving a multistep diazotization/coupling sequence which constructs the dye through successive diazotizing/coupling; that is, the linking of the individual diazo or NH group building blocks takes place successively, or through a convergent synthesis, i.e., moieties of the dye which already comprise azo groups or NH groups are generated and subsequently linked via a further diazotization/coupling to a further moiety of the dye that likewise already comprises one or more azo groups, optionally by means of a coupling or tetraazo component.<br>
In the course of successive diazotizing/coupling, for example, first the diazonium components Dk1 and Dk2 is diazotized and coupled onto respectively Napht1 and Napht2, Kk1 or Kk2 or onto a P or R' group, then the reaction product is again diazotized and coupled onto a further coupling partner and this operation is optionally repeated until the dye has been constructed. Alternatively, in the successive synthesis, the reaction product of the first coupling can also be reacted in succession with one or more diazonium compounds.<br>
Successive coupling may involve a tetrazo component Tk1(NH2)2 or Tk2(NH2)2 being initially converted into the corresponding tetrazonium salt and then reacted in succession with Kk1, P, Napht1, Napht2, etc. coupling partners and then further diazotization/coupling reactions being carried out.<br>
Such processes are known from the prior art for anionic azo dyes and can be applied analogously to the synthesis of the dyes I to VII.<br>
The diazotization and coupling of the resulting diazonium or tetrazonium compound customarily takes place in an aqueous reaction medium under pH control in a conventional manner.<br>
When the reacted moieties already comprise an A group which bears a B radical of the formula CH2CH2-Q, then the pH of the reaction mixture will preferably not exceed a value of pH 8, since otherwise the Q group will detach with vinyl group formation.<br><br>
In couplings of a diazonium component or of a tetrazonium component onto a naphthalene compound of the formulae II and Kk-B respectively, which bears not only an OH group but also an amino group and comprises at least two possible coupling sites, it must be borne in mind that the first coupling takes place regioselectively ortho to the amino group at pH values of not more than 3, whereas at pH values of pH &gt; 6 and preferably pH &gt; 8 the regioselective coupling takes place in the ortho position of the OH group.<br>
The reaction temperatures required for the diazotization/coupling or the reaction with triazines are generally in the range from 0°C to 50°C and especially in the range from 0 to 30°C. The required reaction times are customarily in the range from 5 min to 2 h and especially in the range from 20 min to 1 h.<br>
The reactions are customarily carried out stoichiometrically; that is, the reaction partners are reacted with each other in the desired stoichiometry. However, individual reactants can also be used in excess or in deficiency, based on the desired stoichiometry. The deviation from the desired stoichiometry will be in general not more than 20 mol% and especially not more than 10 mol%. In other words, for the reaction of a diazonium component with a coupling partner the molar ratio of the two components will be in the range from 1:1.2 to 1.2:1 and especially in the range from 1.1:1 to 1:1.1. To react a tetrazonium compound with 2 mol equivalents of a coupling partner, this coupling partner will accordingly be used in an amount from 1.6 to 2.4 mol and especially in an amount from 1.8 to 2.2 mol per mole of tetrazonium compound.<br>
Following the diazotization/coupling sequence, the transition metal complexes may be prepared by adding the desired transition metal salt in the form of a suitable, preferably water-soluble salt in the stoichiometrically desired amount and if necessary heating to the temperature required for complexing, for example to temperatures in the range from 40 to 100°C.<br>
The dye is isolated from the aqueous reaction mixture in a conventional manner, for example by evaporating and especially by spray-drying the aqueous reaction mixture, by salting out the dye and drying the presscake. To prepare a liquid brand or liquid formulation of the dye, the dye presscake, or the powder obtained by evaporation or spray drying, can be dissolved. It is also possible to prepare a liquid formulation of the dye directly from the reaction solution. It may then be necessary for a sufficiently high dye concentration and for the stability of the liquid brand to carry out a dia- and/or ultrafiltration operation in order that the inorganic salts formed in the course of the synthesis may be depleted and the solution concentrated.<br>
The process of the invention comprises a dyeing step at a pH of at least 8. To this end,<br><br>
the leather to be dyed is treated in an aqueous float which has a pH of at least 8.0 and which includes at least one dye F of the above-identified kind. The float pH customarily does not exceed pH 11 and preferably pH 10.5. More particularly, the float pH will be in the range from 8.5 to 10. The alkaline pH ensures that the dye is fixed on the leather, since, under these conditions, the group A will react with the amino groups of the leather to form a covalent bond.<br>
To obtain the pH which is alkaline for the fixation, any desired alkalis and buffer systems can be used. Examples are alkali metal carbonates and bicarbonates such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, also alkali metal hydroxides such as aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, sodium metasillicate, pyrophosphates such as sodium pyrophosphate or potassium pyrophosphate, tripotassium phosphate, trisodium phosphate, borax/aqueous sodium hydroxide solution buffer and phosphate buffer.<br>
The temperatures required for fixing the dye are advantageously not more than 60DC, especially not more than 50°C, and more preferably not more than 40°C, enabling leather to be dyed benignly. Dyeing temperatures are generally at least 10*C, preferably at least 20°C, and especially at least 30°C in order that a sufficient rate of reaction may be ensured and thus the dyeing process may be speeded. In principle, however, lower temperatures are possible as well. The temperature range for organically tanned leather is preferably 15 to 50°C and particularly 30 to 40°C. The preferred temperature range for metal oxide tanned leather is 15 to 60°C and particularly 30 to 50°C.<br>
Adequate fixation generally requires treatment times from 0.5 h to 4 h, depending on pH and temperature. A person skilled in the art will be able to determine required treatment times for the particular dye used by performing simple routine experiments. Especially at strongly alkaline pH values in the range from 9.5 to 11 and especially from 9.5 to 10.5 the dyeing time is preferably not more than 2 h, for example in the range from 0.5 to 2 h.<br>
Dyeing may be carried out in the presence of added salts, for example Glauber salt. There is no measurable effect on the dyeing outcome as a result.<br>
As well as the dyes F which are used according to the invention, the float may also include conventional acid or direct dyes. However, their fraction is preferably not more than 10% by weight and especially not more than 5% by weight, based on the total amount of dyes in the float.<br>
The amount of dye used depends on the desired depth of shade and is customarily at<br><br>
least 0.2% by weight, frequently at least 0.5% by weight and especially 1% by weight, based on the shaved weight of the leather or intermediate article used. The dye will generally be used in an amount of up to 20% by weight, based on the shaved weight, although larger amounts of dye can be used as well. To achieve medium to high depths of shade, the dye F will be used in an amount which depends on the molar extinction coefficient of the dye and of the molecular weight of the dye and will be generally in the range from 2% to 20% by weight, frequently 4% to 20% by weight and especially in the range from 6% to 20% by weight, based on the shaved weight of the leather or intermediate article.<br>
The aqueous float may include customary anionic dyeing assistants, nonionic surface-active substances and also tanning materials customarily used for retanning, for example polymeric retanning materials, synthetic retanning materials, vegetable tanning materials and fatliquors.<br>
Dyeing can be carried out not only in one stage but also in 2 stages. In the case of a two-stage dyeing, the leather will initially be treated, in a first stage, with the dye-containing float at below pH 7, for example pH 3 to 6.5 and preferably at pH values in the range from 4 to 6.5. This step serves to distribute the dye uniformly in the leather cross-section. Subsequently, in the second stage, the dye will be fixed in the above-described manner at pH values of at least 8, for example 8 to 11, especially 8.5 to 10.5 and specifically 8.5 to 10. It is also possible to carry out the dyeing in a one-stage process without the fixation stage being preceded by a distribution stage.<br>
Although not absolutely necessary, a wash may be carried out after the dyeing operation in order that chemically unbound dye and also impurities in the dye, for example dyes without an A group, may be removed. The reason this wash is not absolutely necessary is that dye fixation will already be quantitative or almost quantitative in many cases. If a subsequent wash is carried out, the as-dyed leather will be washed with water one or more times, for example 1 to 6 times and especially 1 to 4 times. The amount of water will generally be not more than 300% by weight, based on the shaved weight of the intermediate article, for example in the range from 100% to 300% by weight. The duration of a single wash step will be typically in the range from 5 to 60 min and especially in the range from 10 to 30 min.<br>
Leather dyeing including retanning, fatliquoring and aftertreatment is effected in a conventional manner, for example by dyeing in a drum, or in a paddle. Such processes are extensively described in the prior art, for example in: “Bibliothek des Leders”, volume 3 (tanning agents, tanning and retanning) [1985], volume 4 (defatting, fatliquoring and hydrophobicization in leather manufacture) [1987] &amp; volume 5 (the dyeing of leather) [1987] Umschau Verlag; “Leather Technicians Handbook”, 1983, by<br><br>
J. H. Sharphouse, published by Leather Producers Association; and “Fundamentals of Leather Manufacturing”, 1993, by E. Heidenmann, published by Eduard Roether KG.<br>
Dyeing is customarily carried out after pretanning, i.e., before, during or after retanning. The dyeing operation can be carried out not only in the same bath as the retanning operation but also in a separate bath. The dyeing operation is preferably carried out before retanning. It is preferable for one or more of the washing steps described above to be carried out after tanning and before retanning and fatliquoring.<br>
The dyeing and retanning operation is generally followed by a fatliquoring operation in order that the leather be adjusted to desired haptic properties. However, retanning and fatliquoring can also be carried out in one process step. The fatliquoring step can be carried out at any stage of the wet end operation and is preferably carried out at the end of the wet end operation.<br>
In general, not only the fatliquoring but also the retanning is fixed at the end of the operation by acidification, i.e., a final acidification takes place after dyeing and any retanning and fatliquoring. Typically, for acidification, the pH of the aqueous treatment bath is adjusted to a value below 3.7 by addition of an acid, especially formic acid.<br>
The process of the invention can in principle be used to dye all types of leather, i.e., intermediate articles which have not been retanned, such as metal oxide tanned leather (wet blue with chromium oxide tanning and wet white with aluminum oxide tanning) and organically tanned, for example aldehyde-tanned, leather (wet white), or vegetable-tanned leather, and also intermediate articles which have been retanned, such as bark or crust leather.<br>
The leather dyed according to the process of the invention is notable for an excellent fastness level even at very high depth of shade. Rubfastnesses and especially wash-, perspiration- and migrationfastnesses are particularly good, which is very difficult if not impossible to achieve in the case of conventionally dyed leathers. The leathers dyed according to the process of the invention exhibit no staining or almost no staining of the contact material in migrationfastness tests even at high humidity and high temperatures, i.e., above 50°C, for example 60 to 100°C.<br>
Qualitative and quantitative determination via UV/VIS spectroscopy and HPLC show that the dyes of the invention give degrees of fixation between 85 and 100% and frequently above 90%.<br>
