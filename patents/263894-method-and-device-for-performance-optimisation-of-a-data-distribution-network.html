Field of invention<br>
The invention relates to a method and a network node for performance optimisation of<br>
a data distribution network for delivering content to a plurality of recipients.<br>
Description of prior art<br>
Data distribution networks are known in the art that are arranged to deliver a plurality<br>
of messages to a plurality of respective recipients. Said messages may contain text,<br>
multimedia data, audio data, or video data. A current data distribution network<br>
suitable for distributing multimedia messages that is known in the art is the MMS<br>
(multimedia messaging) system.<br>
When a plurality of messages is sent to a group of recipients, said messages may<br>
comprise content that is common to the group of recipients. Further the sending of<br>
plurality of messages to a group of recipients may be triggered by an event that is<br>
common for the plurality of messages, such as an availability of the common content.<br>
In current data distribution networks a potential recipient of content to be distributed<br>
registers to information distribution services and accepts the reception of content on<br>
its respective user device. Depending on the popularity of a service, several hundred<br>
thousand recipients may be addressed by one message.<br>
In MMS systems multimedia messages are delivered sequentially to the recipients.<br>
Potential recipients are notified that content is available, the recipients request the<br>
content to be delivered and the content is delivered accordingly. Recipients that have<br>
activated an 'auto download' function on their respective user device request the<br>
content immediately after they have received an indication that content is available.<br>
In current MMS systems the MMS notifications are sent out from the MMC (multi<br>
media messaging center) substantially immediately to the addressed recipients. This<br>
results in a high peak load to the MMC, since the terminals receive the notification<br>
messages within a short time interval and a high fraction of the terminals starts<br>
retrieving the content immediately after they have received a respective notification<br>
message.<br><br>
If the network comprises a bottleneck element being used for the transmission of all<br>
the messages comprising the content to be delivered that bottleneck element limits the<br>
overall performance of the distribution network. If a large number of download<br>
sessions is started immediately after reception of the respective notification message<br>
this results in a large number of sessions that are started simultaneously, and the<br>
bottleneck element may become congested. If the bottleneck element comprises a<br>
bottleneck link that is commonly used for a plurality of TCP/IP (transport control<br>
protocol/ internet protocol) sessions TCP/IP sessions may timeout and stall when the<br>
commonly used link is congested.<br>
A solution to the described problem that is known in the art and that avoids<br>
congestion in such a data distribution network is to over-dimension the bottleneck<br>
element.<br>
Document WO-01/91415 A discloses a uniform resource locator suitable for<br>
accessing a web page which is presented to a plurality of recipients practically<br>
simultaneously. In order to prevent overloading the web server providing access to the<br>
web page by simultaneous access requests, the uniform resource locator comprises<br>
code to instruct the clients potentially accessing the web page to delay the actual<br>
access for a specified time. The specified time is determined according to a delay<br>
period specified in the uniform resource locator.	<br>
EP-A-0 917,380 also relates avoiding simultaneous access requests by a plurality of<br>
content recipients, however the step of delaying is moved to an information<br>
transmission control apparatus'.<br>
WO 01/37494 concerns the handling of access requests to a radio resource. Also WO<br>
01/37494 teaches spreading access requests over a certain time period by delaying the<br>
access requests.<br>
EP-A-1 389 857 concerns the scheduling of retransmission requests in a packet<br>
distribution network, wherein the retransmission requests concern erroneously<br>
transmitted packets. EP-A-1 389 857 teaches communicating a wanted size of a reply<br>
message and instructing the recipient to limit the reply size.<br><br>
Object of the invention<br>
Therefore it is object of the invention to provide a method and a network node for<br>
performance optimization of a data distribution network, that avoids congestion and<br>
that does not require re-dimensioning the data distribution network.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
This object is achieved by the method of claim 1 and the network node of claim 10.<br>
Advantageous embodiments are described in the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention a method is provided for scheduling the delivery of a<br>
plurality of data portions to respective recipients in a data distribution network. The<br>
recipients are commonly utilizing a bottleneck element limiting the performance of<br>
the data distribution network, and the method comprises the steps of:<br>
-	determining a preferred time span for delivering the plurality of data portions<br>
according to a capacity of the bottleneck element and an amount of data to be<br>
delivered,<br>
-	purposefully delaying the delivery of a data portion for a delay that is determined<br>
according to the preferred time span for delivering.<br>
The data distribution network may comprise a cellular network be comprised in a<br>
cellular network or be connected to a cellular network. An example for a data<br>
distribution network comprised in a cellular network is a multimedia media<br>
messaging system.<br>
The preferred time span may be an optimum time span or optimum time span that is<br>
extended by a time margin.<br>
The preferred time span may be determined by dividing the amount of data to be<br>
delivered by the capacity of the bottleneck element.<br>
In a particular embodiment the bottleneck element is a bottleneck link with a limited<br>
transmission capacity and wherein the amount data be delivered may be measured by<br>
a sum of bit sizes of the data portions to be delivered.<br><br>
In this embodiment a preferred time span may be computed be dividing the sum of bit<br>
sizes of the data portions to be delivered by the transmission capacity, which is<br>
measured in bits per second.<br>
By this the preferred time span is determined such that the bottleneck link may be<br>
fully utilized and on the other hand congestion is avoided.<br>
In addition to the bottleneck element limiting the transmission capacity for a plurality<br>
of recipients, the data distribution network may comprise elements limiting the<br>
transmission capacity for individual users. E.g. the transmission bandwidth of a radio<br>
link limits the transmission capacity for an individual user. In this case the number of<br>
simultaneously handled requests could be limited such that the sum of individual<br>
transmission capacities does not exceed the transmission capacity of the bottleneck<br>
element. E.g. the sum of the bandwidths of the radio links of the simultaneously<br>
handled recipients should not exceed the bandwidth of the bottleneck link. By this, the<br>
bottleneck link may be fully utilized without being congested and at the same time the<br>
individual radio links may be fully utilized..<br>
In another embodiment the bottleneck element is a server capable of responding to a<br>
limited number of requests to deliver a data portion per time unit and wherein the<br>
amount of data is a number of data portions to be delivered.<br>
In this embodiment a preferred time span may be computed be dividing the number of<br>
data portions to be delivered by the number of requests per time unit the server is<br>
capable of responding to.<br>
By this the preferred time span is determined such that the server may be fully utilized<br>
but not overloaded.<br>
In a further embodiment a notification message indicating that a data portion is<br>
available for a recipient is sent to each of the recipients.<br>
In this embodiment a step of determining a proportion of the recipients automatically<br>
requesting a respective data portion upon receiving a respective notification message<br><br>
may be included, and the preferred time span may be determined according to the<br>
proportion of recipients automatically requesting the respective data portion.<br>
In particular the preferred time span may be computed as described above and<br>
multiplied with the determined proportion of automatically requesting recipients.<br>
The step of determining the proportion may be performed by a configuring step which<br>
takes assumptions based on experience or measurements into account or the<br>
determining step may be based on measurements. A possibility to measure the<br>
proportion of automatically requesting recipients may be based on measurements of<br>
round-trip times between indicating that a data portion is available and delivering a<br>
data portion upon request from a recipient. If that round trip time is below a certain<br>
value, it may be assumed that the respective recipient is automatically requesting its<br>
respective data portion.<br>
The amount of data may be a predetermined amount of data to be transmitted or an<br>
estimated amount of data to be transmitted. An example for an estimated amount of<br>
data to be transmitted is an amount of retransmitted data referring to erroneously<br>
delivered data portions. In this case the amount of data portions to be retransmitted<br>
may be estimated according to an expected error ratio and a number of data portions<br>
to be originally transmitted.<br>
Delaying the delivery of a data portion may be performed in that the notification<br>
message indicating that the data portion is available is delayed.<br>
This is advantageous in that modifications on a receiving side are not required.<br>
In another embodiment the notification message may comprise a desired value of the<br>
delay for a data portion. By this the recipient may be instructed to delay requesting the<br>
data portion by the indicated delay corresponding to the desired value. By this the<br>
distribution of delay values may be controlled by a distributing node, and the<br>
distributing node is freed of the task of scheduling sending the notification messages.<br>
In a further embodiment the notification message comprises a maximum value of a<br>
delay for a data portion. By this the recipient may be instructed to delay requesting the<br><br>
data portion for a randomly determined delay below the indicated maximum value of<br>
the delay. This is efficient in that the same maximum value may be sent to a plurality<br>
of recipients.<br>
In a further embodiment the delay for a particular recipient is determined such that it<br>
is below the preferred time span for delivering the data.<br>
In another embodiment delays for the plurality of data portions are distributed<br>
between a minimum value and the preferred time span for delivering the plurality of<br>
data portions.<br>
The minimum value may be e.g. zero and a first data portion or a first group of data<br>
portions may be distributed without an intentionally introduced delay.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment the delays are distributed largely<br>
uniformly between the minimum value and the preferred time span. This particularly<br>
advantageous for messages of the same size in that a continuous utilization of the<br>
bottleneck element may be achieved.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention a network node is provided for<br>
scheduling the delivery of a plurality of data portions to respective recipients in a data<br>
distribution network. The network node comprises a processing unit for determining a<br>
preferred time span for delivering the plurality of data portions according to a<br>
capacity of a bottleneck element commonly utilized by a plurality of recipients and according to an amount of data to be delivered and the network node comprises a<br>
delaying means for purposefully delaying the delivery of a data portion for a definite<br>
delay that is determined according to the preferred time span for delivering.<br>
The preferred time span may be an optimum time span or an optimum time span<br>
extended by a time margin.<br>
The preferred time span may be determined by dividing the amount of data to be<br>
delivered by the capacity of the bottleneck element.<br><br>
In a particular embodiment the bottleneck element is a bottleneck link with a limited<br>
transmission capacity and wherein the amount data be delivered may be measured by<br>
a sum of bit sizes of the data portions to be delivered.<br>
In this embodiment a preferred time span may be computed be dividing the sum of bit<br>
sizes of the data portions to be delivered by the transmission capacity, which is<br>
measured in bits per second.<br>
By this the preferred time span is determined such that the bottleneck link may be<br>
fully utilized and on the other hand congestion is avoided.<br>
In another embodiment the bottleneck element is a server capable of responding to a<br>
limited number of requests to deliver a data portion per time unit and wherein the<br>
amount of data is a number of data portions to be delivered.<br>
In this embodiment a preferred time span may be computed be dividing the number of<br>
data portions to be delivered by the number of requests per time unit the server is<br>
capable of responding to.<br>
By this the preferred time span is determined such that the server may be fully utilized<br>
but not overloaded.<br>
According to a particular embodiment the network node comprises an interface for<br>
sending a notification message to a recipient indicating that a data portion is available<br>
for the recipient.	<br>
According to a further embodiment the network node comprises a determining unit<br>
for determining a proportion of recipients automatically requesting a respective data<br>
portion upon receiving a respective notification message, wherein the processing unit<br>
is adapted to determine the preferred time span according to the proportion of<br>
recipients automatically requesting the respective data portion.<br>
The determining unit may be configured with a value of the proportion of<br>
automatically requesting users that is based on experience or previous measurements.<br>
Alternatively the determining unit may be carried out as a measurement unit and<br><br>
determining the proportion of automatically requesting users may be based on<br>
measurements. A possibility to measure the proportion of automatically requesting<br>
recipients may be based on measurements of round-trip times between sending an<br>
indication that a data portion is available and delivering a data portion upon a request<br>
from a recipient. If that round trip time is below a certain value, it may be assumed<br>
. that the respective recipient is automatically requesting its respective data portion.<br>
The amount of data may be a predetermined amount of data to be transmitted or an<br>
estimated amount of data to be transmitted. An example for an estimated amount of<br>
data to be transmitted is the amount of retransmitted data referring to erroneously<br>
delivered data portions. In this case the amount of data to be retransmitted may be<br>
estimated according to an expected error ratio and an amount of data to be originally<br>
. transmitted.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the delaying means is adapted to delay<br>
sending the notification message. This is advantageous in that modifications on a<br>
receiving side are not required.<br>
In a further embodiment the notification message comprises a desired value of the<br>
delay for the data portion.<br>
By this a recipient may be instructed to delay requesting the data portion for a delay<br>
corresponding to the desired value. By this the distribution of delay values may be<br>
controlled by the network node, and the network node is freed of the task of<br>
scheduling sending the notification messages.<br>
In another embodiment the notification message comprises a maximum value of the<br>
delay for the data portion. By this the recipient may be instructed to delay requesting<br>
the data portion for a randomly determined delay below the indicated maximum<br>
delay. This is advantageous in that the same maximum delay value may be sent to a<br>
plurality of recipients.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment the network node comprises a processing<br>
device for determining the delay for a particular recipient such that it is below the<br>
preferred time span for delivering the data.<br><br>
In a another advantageous embodiment the network node comprises a processing<br>
device for determining delays that are distributed between a minimum value and the<br>
preferred time span for delivering the plurality of data portions.<br>
The minimum value may be e.g. zero and a first data portion or a first group of data<br>
portions may be distributed without an intentionally introduced delay.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment the processing device is adapted to<br>
determine delays that are distributed largely uniformly between the minimum value<br>
and the preferred time span. This is advantageous in that a continuous utilization of<br>
the bottleneck element may be achieved.<br>
Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
Figure 1 depicts a data distribution network embodying the present invention by<br>
example of a multimedia messaging system. Though some elements of the data<br>
distribution network are exemplified by elements of a multimedia messaging system<br>
this shall not be understood as limiting the applicability of the invention, which may<br>
be applicable in any kind of data distribution network comprising a bottleneck link.<br>
The data distribution network comprises a service provider SP, often termed a 'value<br>
added service provider', that distributes content to a plurality of recipients, one of<br>
which is pictured as terminal MT. When content is available for distribution to the<br>
plurality of recipients, the service provider forwards the content to a data distribution<br>
node DDN, that is requested to distribute the content to the plurality of recipients, the<br>
content is addressed to. The group of recipients may be defined in that the members of<br>
the group of recipients have subscribed to a particular service for distributing<br>
information of a particular kind to the group of recipients. A typical example of such<br>
services is a service distributing information related to sports events. In the example<br>
of the multimedia messaging service the data distribution node is termed MMC<br>
(multimedia messaging centre). The content may be distributed using multicast, or the<br>
content may be distributed by sequentially sending messages to the respective<br>
recipients the content is intended for. The messages may be sent on the initiative of<br>
the data distribution node or the availability of the content may be indicated towards<br>
the recipients and the content is requested by the recipients upon receiving that<br><br>
indication that content is available. The latter is applied in the context of a multimedia<br>
messaging systems and will be described further.<br>
The notification that content is available may be sent as a first message NM1 from the<br>
data distribution node DDN to a first node N1 in a chain of nodes sending the<br>
notification message, a second message NM2 from the first node N1 to a second node<br>
N2 in that chain and a third message NM3 from the second node N2 to the terminal<br>
MT.<br>
In the context of the multimedia messaging system, the first message NM1 may be a<br>
PAP (Push Access Protocol) message from the data distribution node DDN, that is<br>
embodied as MMC (multimedia messaging centre) to the first node N1 that is<br>
embodied as push PPG (Push-Proxy-Gateway) the second message NM2 may be sent<br>
according to the SMPP (Short Message Peer to Peer) protocol to the second node N2<br>
that is embodied as SMS-C (Short Message Service - Centre) and the third message<br>
may be sent as SMS (Short Message Service) message accordingly.<br>
Upon reception of the indication that content is available, the terminal MT requests<br>
the content from the data distribution node DDN, that delivers the content to the<br>
terminal MT accordingly. In the example of the multi media messaging system the<br>
terminal MT may be a mobile terminal that is connected to the data distribution node<br>
DDN embodied as MMC (multimedia messaging centre), via a radio network RN, a<br>
gateway node GN between the radio network and a fixed core network, and a proxy<br>
node PN.<br>
The radio network RN may be embodied as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)<br>
network, the gateway node GN may be embodied as GGSN (gateway GPRS support<br>
node), and the proxy node PN may be embodied as WAP (wireless application<br>
protocol) proxy. In this embodiment, the connection between the terminal MT and the<br>
proxy node PN comprises a WAP session between the terminal MT and the proxy<br>
node PN and an HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) session between the proxy node<br>
PN and the data distribution node DDN.<br><br>
The terminal MT activates a PDP context to the gateway node GN and requests the<br>
content in a request message that may be split into a first request message RM1 and a<br>
second request message RM2, e.g. a WAP get message and a HTTP get message. The<br>
content may be delivered in a HTTP response and a WAP response accordingly.<br>
Alternatively the network may not comprise a proxy node and the mobile terminal<br>
MT issues an HTTP get request directly towards the data distribution node DDN.<br>
The data distribution network comprises a bottleneck element, i.e. an element limiting<br>
the overall performance of the data distribution network in certain conditions. The<br>
bottleneck element may be a link with a limited transmission capacity. In the context<br>
of the multimedia messaging system the link between the multimedia-messaging<br>
centre and the gateway GPRS support node may form a bottleneck element.<br>
Alternatively or in addition the bottleneck element may be a server capable of<br>
responding to a limited number of requests per time unit. E.g. in the above described<br>
example of a multimedia messaging system, the MMC (multimedia messaging centre)<br>
is capable of responding to a limited number of HTTP requests per time unit and the<br>
WAP gateway is capable of receiving and converting a limited number of WAP<br>
requests only. I.e. in a multimedia messaging system both the WAP gateway and the<br>
MMC (multimedia messaging centre) may form a bottleneck element.<br>
To avoid congestion or overload of the bottleneck element the delivery of the<br>
messages is purposefully delayed for an individual delay that is determined for each<br>
of the recipients according to a preferred time span for delivering the plurality of<br>
messages. The preferred time span for delivering the plurality of messages is<br>
determined according to a capacity of the bottleneck element and an amount of<br>
messages to be delivered, preferably also considering the available radio link<br>
transmission rate.<br>
The preferred time span may be an optimum duration for delivering the messages,<br>
whereby an optimum duration may be optimum in that the utilization of a particular<br>
network element, an actual duration for delivering the content, or any other parameter<br><br>
or set of parameters describing a performance of the data distribution network is<br>
optimised.<br>
Purposefully delaying the delivery of a particular message may be implemented in<br>
that the sending the first notification messages NM1 is delayed.<br>
To delay sending notification messages to each member of the group of recipients,<br>
notifications to the recipients of the group could be sent out with a constant rate, the<br>
notification rate rn.<br>
For a preferred time span of tp seconds and a number of messages nm that have to be<br>
delivered, the notification rate would be<br><br>
Alternatively a time stamp indicating when a notification message should be sent<br>
could be appended to each notification message to a recipient in the group.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the step purposefully delaying the delivery of a message<br>
is implemented in that the first to third notification message NM1 to NM3 each<br>
comprise a desired value of the delay and the notification messages NM1 ... NM3<br>
request the terminal MT in this way to delay sending the first request message RM1<br>
by a delay that is determined according to the desired value.<br>
In another implementation of the delaying step the first to third notification message<br>
NM1 to NM3 each comprise a maximum delay and the terminal randomly determines<br>
a delay between zero and the indicated maximum delay.<br>
The preferred time span may be computed according to a time span for delivering the<br>
messages, that corresponds to a full utilization of the bottleneck element, when the<br>
bottleneck element is not yet overloaded.<br>
The proxy node PN or the data distribution node DDN may be characterized by a<br>
certain hit rate rh i.e. a number of message conversions that the proxy node PN may<br>
perform per time unit or a number of requests per time unit that the data distribution<br>
node DDN may handle. If a number of messages nm has to be delivered, the preferred<br><br>
time span tp for delivering the messages would be<br><br>
The bottleneck link between the data distribution node DDN and the gateway node<br>
GN may be characterized by a certain transmission capacity of the link cl, i.e. a<br>
number of bits per second that may be transmitted via the link. If the total amount of<br>
data that should be delivered is dd bits, the preferred time span tp for delivering the<br>
messages would be<br><br>
The preferred time span tp may be extended by a margin, in order to not fully utilize<br>
the link capacity, the capacity of the proxy node PN, or the capacity of the data<br>
distribution node DDN.<br>
Alternatively or in addition the preferred time span tp may be multiplied by a factor<br>
representing the proportion of the recipients automatically requesting the content to be<br>
delivered upon receiving a respective notification message.<br>
The proportion of automatically requesting recipients may be measured by<br>
measurements of round-trip times between sending the first notification, message<br>
NM1 and receiving the second request message RM2 in the data distribution node<br>
DDN. If that round trip time is below a certain value, it may be assumed that the<br>
respective recipient is automatically requesting its respective data portion. In the<br>
embodiment in that a desired value for a delay is sent to the terminal, that desired<br>
value may advantageously be taken into account when making the assumption.<br>
The amount of data to be transmitted may be a predetermined amount or an estimated<br>
amount of data to be transmitted. An example for an estimated amount of data to be<br>
transmitted is the amount of retransmitted data referring to erroneously delivered data.<br>
In this case the bit size of retransmitted data may be estimated as the bit size of data to<br>
be originally transmitted multiplied by an expected error ratio.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a simulation result of a simulation when applying the invention to the<br>
above described data distribution network. The simulation is based on an analytical<br>
model that assumes that the capacity of the bottleneck link between the data<br><br>
distribution node DDN and the gateway node GN is shared equally between the<br>
terminals to that content is distributed simultaneously.<br>
The parameters for the simulation are a message size of 50 Kbytes, a group size of<br>
5000 users to that content is to be distributed. The bottleneck link between the data<br>
distribution node DDN and the gateway node GN has a bottleneck link rate of'<br>
Cl = 10 Mbits per second. Further the capacity of each radio link towards a respective<br>
terminal is limited to 64 Kbits per second. I.e. the total amount of data to be delivered<br><br>
Applying the above formula for a preferred duration when the bottleneck link is<br>
characterized by its transmission capacity cl and the amount of data is characterized<br>
by a bit size dd, the preferred time span<br><br>
The parameters have been chosen to demonstrate the advantages provided when<br>
applying the invention and are not intended characterize a real world network.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 depict the number of simultaneously active WAP sessions against the<br>
simulation time that runs from zero 205 seconds. In the simulation depicted in figure<br>
2, the delay values for the plurality of messages are distributed uniformly between<br>
zero and a preferred time span that has been set to 200 s i.e. roughly the preferred<br>
time span calculated as above. In the simulation depicted in figure 3 the delay values<br>
are distributed uniformly between zero and a maximum delay value of 160 s, which is<br>
significantly below the preferred time span. The simulation results show, that the<br>
number of simultaneously active users is significantly lower when applying the<br>
preferred time span of 200 s as compared to the maximum time span that is not<br>
configured according to the preferred time span. By this the amount of software<br>
resources can be significantly lowered when applying the preferred time span.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 depict the simulation time against the number of terminals towards<br>
that a message has been sent, and the number of users that have received the content.<br>
In other words, the terminals are sorted in the order in that a respective message is<br>
sent to them and an index value is assigned to each recipient accordingly. The lower<br><br>
of the two depicted time values represents the time point, at which sending a message<br>
towards the recipient bearing the respective index is initiated and the upper of the two<br>
depicted values represents the time point at which the respectively indexed recipient<br>
has received its message. In the simulation depicted in figure 4, the delay values for<br>
the plurality of messages are distributed uniformly between zero and a preferred time<br>
span of 200 s i.e. roughly the preferred time span calculated as above. In the<br>
simulation depicted in figure 5 the delay values are distributed uniformly between<br>
zero and a maximum delay value of 160 s. When comparing figures 4 and 5 it is<br>
clearly visible, that time span between initiating delivering a message and the actual<br>
delivery are significantly shorter when applying the preferred time span of figure 4<br>
compared to the non-optimum time span of figure 5.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 visualize a further measurement taken from the simulations described<br>
above which is the percentage of terminals, towards that a message has been delivered<br>
against the simulation time. Figure 6 depicts the measurement in that delay values for<br>
the plurality of messages are distributed uniformly between zero and a preferred time<br>
span of 200 s; figure 7 depicts a result of the simulation in that the delay values are<br>
distributed uniformly between zero and a maximum delay value of 160 s. In the first<br>
case the number of recipients that have received the content increases largely linearly<br>
during the whole simulation time. In the second, non-optimum configuration the<br>
number of recipients increases also linearly in the beginning, but with a lower rate,<br>
e.g. after 100 seconds, the percentage of recipients that have received the content in<br>
the first case is approximately 44%, whereas the respective percentage is only 38% in<br>
the non-optimum configuration. This corresponds to a performance increase of<br>
-18%.<br>
Figure 8 depicts a method for scheduling the delivery of a plurality of data portions<br>
according to the invention. According to the depicted method the plurality of data<br>
portions are delivered to respective recipients in a data distribution network. The<br>
recipients are commonly utilizing a bottleneck element limiting the performance of<br>
the data distribution network.<br>
The method comprises a first determining step S1 in that a preferred time span for<br>
delivering the plurality of data portions is determined according to a capacity of the<br><br>
bottleneck element and an amount of data to be delivered. The method further<br>
comprises a second determining step S2 in that an individual delay for each data<br>
portion is determined according to the preferred time span for delivering the data. The<br>
method further comprises a delaying step S3 for each data potion in that delivering the<br>
respective data portion is delayed for the determined individual delay.<br>
Figure 9 depicts network node NN for scheduling the delivery of a plurality of data<br>
portions to respective recipients in a data distribution network. The network node<br>
comprises a processing unit PU for determining a preferred time span for delivering<br>
the plurality of data portions according to a capacity of a bottleneck element<br>
commonly utilized by a plurality of recipients and according to an amount of data to<br>
be delivered. The network node further comprises a delaying means DM for delaying<br>
the delivery of a data portion for a definite delay that is determined according to the<br>
preferred time span for delivering.<br>
Advantageously the network node NN further comprises an interface 11 for sending a<br>
notification message to a recipient indicating that a data portion is available for the<br>
recipient.<br>
The network node NN may further comprise a determining unit DU for determining a<br>
proportion of recipients automatically requesting a respective data portion upon<br>
receiving a respective notification message. In this embodiment the processing unit<br>
PU is adapted to determine the preferred time span according to the proportion of<br>
recipients automatically requesting the respective data portion.<br>
