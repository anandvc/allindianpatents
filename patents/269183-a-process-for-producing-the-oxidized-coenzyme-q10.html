APPLICATION NO. 00918/KOLNP/2004<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to<br>
a process for producing the reduced coenzyme Qio<br>
represented by the following formula (I):<br><br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
a process for producing reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
which comprises culturing reduced coenzyme Q10-<br>
producing microorganisms to obtain microbial cells<br>
containing reduced coenzyme Q10 at a ratio of not less than<br>
70 mole % among the entire coenzymes Q10,<br>
optionally disrupting the microbial cells and<br>
recovering thus-produced reduced coenzyme Q10.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for<br>
producing oxidized coenzyme Q10 which comprises either<br>
recovering oxidized coenzyme Q10 after oxidizing the above-<br><br>
nentioned microbial cells or disrupted product thereof, or<br>
recovering reduced coenzyme Q10 from the above-mentioned<br>
nicrobial cells or disrupted product thereof to oxidize<br>
thus-obtained reduced coenzyme Q10 thereafter.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The reduced coenzyme Q10 (I) and the oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10 (II) are mitochondrial electron transport<br>
system-constituting factors in cells of a living body of<br>
luman and deal with ATP production by working as electron<br>
carriers in oxidative phosphorization reactions.<br>
Conventionally, oxidized coenzyme Q10 has been widely<br>
ised for supplementary nutrient foods and cosmetic products<br>
in addition to pharmaceutical products as a<br>
pharmaceutically and physiologically effective substance<br>
for a variety of diseases.<br>
On the other hand, reduced coenzyme Q10 has not so<br>
nuch drawn attention so far; however, in these years, there<br>
las been reported that reduced coenzyme Q10 is more<br>
affective in various applications than oxidized coenzyme<br>
Q10.<br>
For example, japanise Kukai Publication Hei-10-330251<br>
discloses an antihypercholesterolemia agent having<br>
axcellent cholesterol reducing function, an<br>
iritihyperlipeuiia agent, and an agent for curing and<br>
preventing arteriosclerosis which contain reduced coenzyme<br>
Qio as an active ingredient. In addition, Japanese Kokai<br>
Publication Hei-10-109933 discloses a pharmaceutical<br>
composition excellent in oral absorbability comprising<br>
coenzyme Q10 including reduced coenzyme Q10 as an active<br>
ingredient.<br>
Furthermore, reduced coenzyme Q10 is effective as an<br>
antioxidant and a radical scavenger. R. Stocker, et al.<br>
nave reported that reduced coenzyme Qio prevented<br>
peroxidation of human LDL more efficiently than a-<br><br>
tocopherol, lycopene and (3-carotene (Proceedings of the<br>
NFational Academy of Science of the United States of America,<br>
vol. 88, pp. 1646-1650, 1991) .<br>
It has been known that oxidized coenzyme Q10 and<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 are in a certain type of equilibrium<br>
in a living body and that oxidized coenzyme Q10/ reduced<br>
coenzyme Qio absorbed in the living body are mutually<br>
reduced/oxidized.<br>
Reduced coenzyme Q10 is supposedly produced by a<br>
chemical synthesis method, similarly to the process for<br>
producing oxidized coenzyme Q10. But the synthesis process<br>
is supposed to be complicated, risky and costly. Moreover,<br>
in the case of chemical synthesis methods, it will be<br>
necessary to minimize the subgeneraLion and contamination<br>
of a (Z)-isomer, which is suspiciously unsafe (Biomedicai<br>
and Clinical Aspects of Coenzyme Q, vol. 3, pp. 19-30,<br>
1981) . Europe Pharmacopoeia regulates that a content of<br>
(Z)-isomer in oxidized coenzyme Q10 must be not more than<br>
0.1%.<br>
As another process for producing reduced coenzyme Q10,<br>
it can be supposed a method of utilizing microbial cells,<br>
that is, a method for separating and recovering reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 from reduced coenzyme Q10-producing<br>
microorganisms. However, the reduced coenzyme Q10 produced<br>
by the microbial cells of the above mentioned<br>
microorganisms contains a large amount of oxidized coenzyme<br>
Q10, and the separation and recovery of reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
by a conventional method results in high cost.<br>
The following are documents describing the presence<br>
of reduced coenzyme Q10 in microbial cells and there have<br>
been known the following examples of bacteria.<br>
(1) An example describing that at lowest 5 to 10% by weight<br>
and at highest 30 to 60% by weight of reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
are present among the entire coenzymes Q10 in culture cells<br>
of photosynthesis bacteria (Japanese Kokai Publication Sho-<br><br>
57-70834).<br>
(2) An example describing that the genus Pseudomonas is<br>
subjected to thermal extraction by an organic solvent in<br>
the presence of sodium hydroxide and pyrogallol, and the<br>
resultant is treated with 5% sodium hydrosulfite solution,<br>
and further dehydrated and concentrated to collect an<br>
acetone-soluble portion, and an oil containing reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 is obtained (Japanese Kokai Publication Sho-<br>
60-75294).<br>
Both of the above (1) and (2) aim to convert a<br>
mixture of the obtained reduced coenzyme Q10 and oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10 or the obtained reduced coenzyme Q10 into<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 by further oxidation. Thus, reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 is only described as an intermediate substance<br>
in producing oxidized coenzyme Q10.<br>
In the above (1), photosynthesis bacteria are used,<br>
the culture of which is complicated. Furthermore, in the<br>
microbial cells of the above-mentioned microorganisms, when<br>
the production of reduced coenzyme Q10 is aimed at, it<br>
cannot be said that the ratio of reduced coenzyme Q10 among<br>
the entire coenzymes Q10 is sufficient.<br>
The above (2) comprises a process of converting<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 contained in a hexane phase into<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 by sodium hydrosulfite, a reducing<br>
agent (see Example 3 in Japanese Kokai Publication Sho-60-<br>
75294). Thus, the ratio of reduced coenzyme Q10 among the<br>
entire coenzymes Q10 in the microbial cells is not clear.<br>
Furthermore, in both of the above (1) and (2), the<br>
production amount of coenzymes Q in culture are not<br>
described.<br>
As described above, microbial cells containing<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 at high ratio have not been reported<br>
yet. Still less, it has not been known a fermentation<br>
production of reduced coenzyme Q10 on the industrial scale,<br>
that is, a method comprising culturing microorganisms to<br><br>
obtain microbial cells containing reduced coenzyme Q10 at<br>
high ratio among the entire coenzymes Q10, and recovering<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 to obtain high-purity reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10.<br>
Under such circumstances, if a method for obtaining a<br>
large quantity of coenzyme Q10 containing reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 at high ratio by culturing microorganisms ' is found, it<br>
can be a highly useful method for producing reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
process for producing reduced coenzyme Q10 safely and<br>
efficiently on the industrial scale by culturing reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10-producing microorganisms for obtaining<br>
microbial cells containing reduced coenzyme Q10 at high<br>
ratio and suitably recovering reduced coenzyme Q10 from the<br>
microbial cells.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a process for producing oxidized coenzyme Q10 in<br>
simple processes by culturing reduced coenzyme Q10-<br>
producing microorganisms for obtaining microbiai cells<br>
containing reduced coenzyme Q10 at high ratio, and<br>
oxidizing the reduced coenzyme Q10 obtained from the<br>
microbiai cells as an intermediate substance in producing<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10.<br>
That is, the present invention relates to<br>
a process for producing the reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
represented by the following formula (I):<br><br><br>
which comprises culturing reduced coenzyme Q10-<br>
producing microorganisms in a culture medium containing a<br>
carbon source, a nitrogen source, a phosphorus source and a<br>
micronutrient to obtain microbial cells containing reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 at a ratio of not less than 70 mole % among<br>
the entire coenzymes Q10,<br>
optionally disrupting the microbial cells and<br>
extracting thus-produced reduced coenzyme Q10 by an<br>
organic solvent.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention also relates to<br>
a process for producing the oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
represented by the following formula (II):<br><br>
which comprises culturing reduced coenzyme Q10-<br>
producing microorganisms in a culture medium containing a<br>
carbon source, a nitrogen source, a phosphorus source and a<br>
micronutrient to obtain microbial cells containing reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 at a ratio of not less than 70 mole % among<br>
the entire coenzymes Q10,<br>
optionally disrupting the microbial cells; and<br>
either oxidizing thus-produced reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
to oxidized coenzyme Q10 and then extracting the resultant<br><br>
y an organic solvent, or extracting thus-produced reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 by an organic solvent, purifying optionally<br>
md oxidizing the resultant to oxidized coenzyme Q10.<br>
According to the processes of the present invention,<br>
ceduced coenzyme Q10 can be produced cheaply on the<br>
industrial scale by considerably simple steps comprising<br>
culturing microorganisms and recovering reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 In addition, oxidized coenzyme Q10 can also be<br>
produced by simple processes. Moreover, these coenzymes Q10<br>
produced by microorganisms basically do not contain (Z)-<br>
isomers thereof, and (all-E) isomers thereof can be<br>
obtained, which are same as those contained in meat, fish,<br>
etc.<br>
DETAILED DISCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, at first, reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10-producing microorganisms are cultured to obtain<br>
microbial cells containing reduced coenzyme Q10 at a ratio<br>
of not less than 70 mole %, preferably not less than 75<br>
mole %, among the entire coenzymes Q10 (fermentation).<br>
The microbial cells containing reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
aL such high ratio among the entire coenzymes Q10 can be<br>
basically obtained by culturing microorganisms capable of<br>
producing reduced coenzyme Q10 at a ratio of not less than<br>
7 0 mole %, preferably not less than 7 5 mole %, among the<br>
entire coenzymes Q10.<br>
How much ratio the microorganisms can produce reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 among the entire coenzymes Q10 can be evaluated,<br>
for example, by a method comprising culturing the<br>
microorganisms with shaking (amplitude: 2 cm, 310<br>
reciprocation/min) at 25°C for 72 hours in 10 mL of a<br>
culture medium [(glucose: 20 g, peptone: 5 g, yeast<br>
extract: 3g, malt extract: 3 g)/L, pH: 6.0] using a test<br>
tube (inner diameter: 21 mm, entire length: 200 mm).<br>
Although the preferable culture conditions for the<br><br>
fermentation production on the industrial scale will be<br>
iescribed later, the above-mentioned culture condition is<br>
one method for standardizing the ratio of reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 produced, which microorganisms have as its ability, so<br>
as to reflect the ratio within the range without having<br>
significant inaccuracies.<br>
Under the above-mentioned culture condition, it is<br>
preferable to use microbial cells wherein a content of<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 is at a ratio of not less than 70<br>
mole %, preferably not less than 75 mole %, among the<br>
entire coenzymes Q10, for the present invention. It is<br>
still more preferable to use microorganisms having a<br>
productivity of reduced coenzyme Q10 per unit culture<br>
medium of generally not less than 1 g/mL, preferably not<br>
less than 2 (.g/mL under the above-mentioned culture<br>
condition.<br>
The above-mentioned content of reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
and ratio of reduced coenzyme Q10 among the entire<br>
coenzymes Q10 can be confirmed by physically disrupting the<br>
microbial cells, extracting coenzyme Q10 from thus-obtained<br>
cells by an organic solvent and performing HPLC analysis.<br>
Specifically, the measurement can be carried out according<br>
to the following procedures:<br>
(1)	The broth of microorganism is optionally concentrated,<br>
10 parts by volume of the broth are displaced to a screw<br>
cap test tube (inner diameter: 16.5 mm, entire length: 130<br>
mm), and 10 parts by volume of glass beads are added (425<br>
to 600 urn, manufactured by SIGM7A Co.);<br>
(2)	3 parts by volume of isopropanol and 18.5 parts by<br>
volume of n-hexane relative to 10 parts by volume of the<br>
broth are added under a nitrogen atmosphere;<br>
(3)	microbial cell disruption and extraction are carried<br>
out by vigorously shaking of the mixture for 3 minutes<br>
under a nitrogen atmosphere; and<br>
(4)	the obtained hydrophobic organic solvent phase (n-<br><br>
hexane phase) is evaporated (bath temperature: 40°C) under<br>
reduced pressure to analyze the resultant by HPLC.<br>
Column: YMC-Pack 4.6 x 250 mm (manufactured by YMC.<br>
Co., Ltd.)<br>
Mobile phase: methanol/n-hexane = 85/15<br>
Flow rate: 1 mL/min,<br>
Detection: UV 275 nm<br>
Retention time: reduced coenzyme Q10 13.5 min<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 22.0 min<br>
The above-mentioned measurement method is provided<br>
for the obtained result to reflect the reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
content and the ratio of reduced coenzyme Q10 among the<br>
entire coenzymes Q10 as accurate as possible, and to<br>
standardize the content and the ratio of reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10, which can be guaranteed at the minimum. This method<br>
has been demonstrated, by several experimentations<br>
performed by the present inventors, easy and suitable to be<br>
carried out.<br>

mole %, and particularly preferably not less than 90 mole %,<br>
among the entire coenzymes Q10 in the case where the above-<br>
mentioned modified or improved microorganisms, preferably<br>
microorganisms mutated by mutagens, are evaluated by the<br>
above-mentioned proliferation method and the measurement<br>
method. In the fermentation production on the industrial<br>
scale, it is preferable to use microorganisms haviny a<br>
productivity of reduced coenzyme Q10 per unit culture<br>
medium of not less than 1 ug/mL, preferably not less than 2<br>
(.g/mL, more preferably not less than 3 |g/mL, still more<br>
preferably not less than 5 .g/mL, particularly preferably<br>
not less than 10 g/mL, much more preferably not less than<br>
15 g/mL, and most preferably not less than 20 ug/mL.<br>
The mutagenesis may be carried out by a single<br>
mutagenesis; however, mutagenesis is preferably carried out<br>
not less than 2 times. That is because it was found that<br>
the productivity of reduced coenzyme Q10 can be improved in<br>
the respective mutagenesis steps. It is needless to say<br>
that the candidates of the microbial cells to be mutated<br>
are, generally, those having a productivity of reduced<br><br><br>
coenzyme Q10 as high as possible in the case where the<br>
evaluation is carried out by the above-mentioned<br>
proliferation method and measurement method.<br>
The mutagenesis can be carried out by using optional<br>
and proper mutagens. The term "mutagen" encompasses, in a<br>
board definition, not only chemical agents having<br>
mutagenesis effects, for example, but also treatments such<br>
as UV radiation having mutagenesis effects. As examples of<br>
proper mutangens, there may be mentioned ethyl<br>
methanesulfonate, UV radiation, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-<br>
nitrosoguanidine, nucleotide base analogues such as<br>
bromouracil, and acridines; however, they are not limited<br>
to these examples.<br>
According to a conventional mutagenesis technique,<br>
successively to the mutagenesis, a proper selection of<br>
microbial cells having high productivity of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 is carried out. For that, the culture obtained<br>
from a single colony should be evaluated, for example, by<br>
the above-mentioned proliferation method and measurement<br>
method. Since a reduced coenzyme Qlo crystal forms a white<br>
solid layer or a colorless liquid phase, a productivity of<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 can be suitably evaluated by the<br>
above-mentioned measurement method at the time of selection<br>
of the colony.<br>
In the processes of the present invention, high<br>
productivity of reduced coenzyme Qlo in the fermentation<br>
production on the industrial scale can be achieved<br>
partially by using the microbial cells containing reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 at a ratio of not less than 70 mole % among<br>
the entire coenzymes Q10 and, partially, by using the<br>
suitable conditions of culture (fermentation) for<br>
increasing a productivity of reduced coenzyme Q10 per unit<br>
culture medium as described below. It is particularly<br>
preferable to combinedly use suitable microbial cells<br>
described above and the suitable conditions of culture<br><br><br>
(fermentation) as described below.<br>
The culture is carried out, in general, in a culture<br>
medium containing major nutrients and micronutrients suited<br>
for microorganism proliferation. As the above-mentioned<br>
nutrients, there may be mentioned, for example, carbon<br>
sources (e.g. hydrocarbons such as glucose, sucrose,<br>
maltose, starch, corn syrup and molasses; alcohols such as<br>
methanol and ethanol), nitrogen sources (e.g. corn steep<br>
liquor, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium<br>
hydroxide, urea and peptone), phosphorus sources (e.g.<br>
ammonium phosphate and phosphoric acid) and micronutrients<br>
(e.g. minerals such as magnesium, potassium, zinc, copper,<br>
iron, manganese, molybdenum, sulfuric acid and hydrochloric<br>
acid; vitamins such as biotin, desthiobiotin and vitamin<br>
Bl; amino acids such as alanine and histidine; and natural<br>
raw materials containing vitamins such as yeast extract and<br>
malt extract); however, these are not limitative ones, and<br>
commonly used ones may be used. Incidentally, in natural<br>
components of a culture medium, such as yeast extract,<br>
phosphorus sources such as phosphates are contained. The<br>
above-mentioned nutrients can be appropriately used in<br>
combination.<br>
The culture is generally carried out at a temperature<br>
range of 15 to 45°C, preferably 20 to 37°C. If it is below<br>
15°C, the proliferation speed of microorganisms tends to be<br>
too slow to allow the industrial production and at high<br>
temperatures exceeding 45°C, the viability of<br>
microorganisms tends to be easily hindered.<br>
In general, the culture is carried out at a pH range<br>
of 4 to 9, preferably 5 to 8 . If the pH is not more than 3<br>
or not less than 10, proliferation of microorganisms tends<br>
to be easily inhibited.<br>
In the fermentation production on the industrial<br>
scale, although it depends on the microorganism species,<br>
the concentration of the carbon sources (including the<br><br><br>
produced alcohols) during the culture is preferably<br>
controlled to a concentration that no adverse effects are<br>
substantially caused on the productivity of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10. Accordingly, it is preferable to control the<br>
culture so as to have the concentration of the carbon<br>
sources that no adverse effects are substantially caused on<br>
the productivity of reduced coenzyme Q10, that is,<br>
generally to not more than 20 g/L, preferably not more than<br>
5 g/L, and more preferably not more than 2 g/L in the broth.<br>
To control the concentration of the carbon sources, a<br>
fed batch culture method is preferably used. The carbon<br>
source concentration in the broth can be controlled by<br>
adjusting the supply of nutrient sources (especially carbon<br>
sources) based on the culture control indexes such as pll,<br>
the dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) or the remaining<br>
saccharide concentration. Although it depends on the<br>
microorganism species, the supply of the nutrient sources<br>
nay be started from the initial stage of the culture or<br>
during the culture. The supply of the nutrient sources may<br>
be continuous or intermittent. Incidentally, in supplying<br>
the nutrient sources, it is preferable to supply the above-<br>
mentioned carbon sources Lo the culture medium separately<br>
from other components.<br>
The culture can be completed at the point when a<br>
desired amount of reduced coenzyme Q10 is produced. The<br>
culture duration is not particularly limited and it is<br>
generally 20 to 200 hours.<br>
The above-mentioned culture is generally carried out<br>
aerobically. The term "aerobically" means a condition that<br>
oxygen is supplied so as not to cause oxygen limitation<br>
(oxygen deficiency) during the culture, and preferably a<br>
condition that oxygen is supplied sufficiently so as not to<br>
cause substantial oxygen limitation during the culture.<br>
The culture is carried out generally under an aeration<br>
condition, preferably under an aeration and stirring<br><br><br>
condition.<br>
By using the above-mentioned microorganisms and<br>
culture conditions, it becomes possible to obtain microbial<br>
cells containing reduced coenzyme Q10 at a ratio of not<br>
less than 70 mole %, preferably not less than 75 mole %<br>
among the entire coenzymes Q10. Furthermore, the<br>
productivity of reduced coenzyme Q10 of as high as not less<br>
than 1 g/mL, preferably not less than 2 (g/mL, and still<br>
more preferably not less than 3 |xg/mL can be obtained.<br>
Next, recovery of the reduced coenzyme Q10 produced<br>
by the above-mentioned culture will be described.<br>
In the present invention, an efficient production of<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 on the industrial scale is made to be<br>
possible partially by the above-mentioned suitable culture<br>
and partially by the suitable recovery process of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 as described below.<br>
Recovery of reduced coenzyme Q10 is carried out by<br>
extraction from the microbial cells obtained by the above-<br>
mentioned culture using an organic solvent.<br>
In the extraction, cells can be disrupted optionally.<br>
The cell disruption contributes to the efficient extraction<br>
of the reduced coenzyme Q10 produced and accumulated in<br>
cells. It is needless to say that the cell disruption and<br>
extraction can be carried out at the same time.<br>
Incidentally, "disruption" in the present invention<br>
may be carried out to the extent that the surface structure<br>
such as a cell wall is broken so as to make extraction of<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 possible; therefore, it is not<br>
necessary that microbial cells are torn or fragmentated.<br>
The above-mentioned cell disruption is not<br>
necessarily required in the case of bacteria. However, in<br>
the case of yeast or fungi, the cell disruption is<br>
generally required and, when cells are not disrupted, it<br>
becomes difficult to efficiently recover the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 produced and accumulated in the cells.<br><br><br>
The above-mentioned disruption of microbial cells can<br>
De carried out by the following one or several disruption<br>
nethods in optional order. As the disruption method, there<br>
nay be mentioned, for example, a physical treatment, a<br>
chemical treatment., an enzymic treatment as well as a<br>
heating treatment, an autolysis, an osmolysis, a<br>
plasmoptysis and the like.<br>
The above-mentioned physical treatment can be carried<br>
out, for example, by using a high pressure homogenizer, an<br>
ultrasonic homogenizer, a French press, a ball mill and the<br>
like or using them in combination.<br>
The above-mentioned chemical treatment can be carried<br>
out, for example, by using an acid (preferably a strong<br>
acid) such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, a base<br>
(preferably a strong base) such as sodium hydroxide and<br>
potassium hydroxide and the like or using them in<br>
combination.<br>
The above-mentioned enzymic treatment can be carried<br>
out, for example, by using lysozyme, zymolyase, glucanase,<br>
Novozyme, protease, cellulase and the like or by using them<br>
appropriately in combination.<br>
The dbove-mentioned heating treatment can be carried<br>
out, for example, by heating to the temperature range of 60<br>
to 100°C for about 30 minutes to 3 hours.<br>
The above-mentioned autolysis can be carried out, for<br>
example, by treatment with a solvent such as ethyl acetate.<br>
The osmolysis or the plasmoptysis for disrupting<br>
cells by treating cells with a solution having a different<br>
salt concentration from that in the cells are often<br>
combinedly used with the above-mentioned physical treatment,<br>
chemical treatment, enzymic treatment, heating treatment,<br>
autolysis and/or the like since the above lytic method<br>
alone is insufficient in the disruption effect.<br>
As the cell disruption method as a pretreatment of<br>
extraction and recovery of reduced coenzyme Q10, among the<br><br><br>
above-mentioned disruption methods, the physical treatment,<br>
the chemical treatment (particularly, an acid treatment and<br>
preferably the one with a strong acid (e.g. an acid having<br>
a pKa value of not more than 2.5 in the form of an aqueous<br>
solution) under the condition that reduced coenzyme Q10 is<br>
protected from an oxidation reaction as described below)<br>
and the heating treatment are preferred. From the<br>
viewpoint of disruption efficiency, the physical treatment<br>
is more preferred.<br>
A conventional cell disruption method and coenzyme<br>
Q10 extraction method, specifically, a method comprising<br>
extracting coenzyme Q10 by an organic solvent in the<br>
presence of sodium hydroxide and pyrogallol has problems in<br>
terms of cost, waste treatment, safety in effective<br>
utilization of waste microorganisms (waste cells) such as<br>
recovery of protein, and the like. However, the cell<br>
disruption method, particularly the physical treatment<br>
method of the present invention, does not cause<br>
subgeneration of a large quantity of salts by<br>
neutralization, and is a suitable method from a viewpoint<br>
of the waste treatment and the effective utilization of<br>
waste microorganisms (wasle cells).<br>
The form of the microbial cells to be used for the<br>
above-mentioned cell disruption may be a broth, a<br>
concentrated broth, microbial cells collected as wet cells<br>
from the broth, a product obtained by washing them, a<br>
suspension of the wet cells in a solvent (including, for<br>
example, water, physiological saline solution, buffers and<br>
the like), dry cells obtained by drying the above-mentioned<br>
wet cells, a suspension of the dry cells in a solvent<br>
(including, for example, water, physiological saline<br>
solution, buffers and the like), and the like. Preferred<br>
is an aqueous suspension of microbial cells, and in terms<br>
of operability and the like, more preferred are the broth,<br>
the concentrated broth, and the product obtained by washing<br><br><br>
them.<br>
The form of the above-mentioned microbial cells or<br>
disrupted product thereof to be used for extraction and<br>
recovery of reduced coenzyme Q10 is, similarly as described<br>
above, not particularly limited and may be wet cells/dry<br>
cells of the microbial cells/disrupted product thereof.<br>
Preferably, it is an aqueous suspension of the microbial<br>
cells or disrupted product thereof, and more preferably the<br>
broth, the concentrated and/or washed broth, or solutions<br>
obtained by disrupting them (each of them is an aqueous<br>
suspension).<br>
The cell concentration in the above-mentioned<br>
suspension of the microbial cells or disrupted product<br>
thereof is not particularly limited and is generally 1 to<br>
25% by weight on the basis of dry weight. Preferably, it<br>
is 10 to 20% by weight in terms of cost.<br>
Reduced coenzyme Q10 can be recovered by extracting<br>
the microbial cells and disrupted product thereof obtained<br>
in such a manner by an organic solvent.<br>
As the organic solvent to be used for the extraction,<br>
there may be mentioned hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters,<br>
ethers, alcohols, fatty acids, ketones, nitrogen compounds<br>
(including nitriles and amides), sulfur compounds and the<br>
like.<br>
Particularly, in extracting reduced coenzyme Q10, in<br>
terms of protection from oxidation by a molecular oxygen,<br>
at least one species of hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters,<br>
ethers, and nitriles is preferably used. Among them,<br>
hydrocarbons and fatty acid esters are particularly<br>
preferable, and hydrocarbons are most preferable.<br>
On the industrial production scale, complete oxygen<br>
elimination is very difficult to be achieved and,<br>
furthermore, fairly long periods of time are required for<br>
individual operations, unlike laboratory scale production,<br>
so that residual oxygen exerts a great adverse effect. The<br><br><br>
oxidation in question is directly connected to a<br>
subgeneration of oxidized coenzyme Q10 from reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10. Accordingly, use of the above-mentioned<br>
organic solvent (such as hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters,<br>
ethers, and nitriles) with high oxidation prevention effect<br>
in the extraction of reduced coenzyme Q10 assists an<br>
efficient extraction.<br>
The hydrocarbons are not particularly restricted, but<br>
there may be mentioned, for example, aliphatic hydrocarbons,<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, and the<br>
like. Preferred are aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, and more preferred are aliphatic hydrocarbons.<br>
The aliphatic hydrocarbons are not particularly<br>
restricted, and may be cyclic or acyclic, or saturated or<br>
unsaturated. However, generally, saturated ones are<br>
preferably used. Usually, ones containing 3 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms, preferably 5 to 12 carbon atoms, and more preferably<br>
5 to 8 carbon atoms are used. As specific examples, there<br>

2-methylbutane, hexane, 2-methylpentane, 2,2-dimethylbutane,<br>
2,3-dimethylbutane, heptane, heptane isomers (e.g. 2-<br>

dimethylpentane), octane, 2, 2, 3-trimethylpentane, isooctane,<br>
nonane, 2,2,5-trimethylhexane, decane, dodecane,<br>
cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane,<br>
methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, p-menthane, and the<br><br><br>
like. More preferred are pentane, 2-methylbutane, hexane,<br>

octane, 2,2,3-trimethylpentane, isooctane, cyclopentane,<br>
methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane,<br>
ethylcyclohexane, and the like.<br>
Generally, heptanes, not only heptane but also<br>
heptane isomers such as methylcyclohexane having 7 carbon<br>
atoms and a mixture thereof are preferably used. More<br>
preferred are pentanes (e.g. pentane and the like) having 5<br>
carbon atoms, hexanes (e.g. hexane, cyclohexane and the<br>
like) having 6 carbon atoms, and heptanes (e.g. heptane,<br>
mRthylcyclohexane and the like) having 7 carbon atoms.<br>
Particularly preferred are heptanes (e.g. heptane,<br>
methylcyclohexane and the like) in terms of especially high<br>
protection effect from oxidation, and the most preferred is<br>
heptane.<br>
The aromatic hydrocarbons are not particularly<br>
restricted, but generally ones containing 6 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms, preferably 6 to 12 carbon atoms, and more preferably<br>
7 to 10 carbon atoms are used. As specific examples, there<br>
may be mentioned, for example, benzene, toluene, xylene, o-<br>

and the like. More preferred are toluene, xylene, o-xylene,<br>
m-xylene, p-xylene, cumene, tetralin and the like, and most<br>
preferred is cumene.<br>
The halogenated hydrocarbons are not particularly<br>
restricted, and may be cyclic or acyclic, or saturated or<br><br><br>
unsaturated. However, acyclic ones are preferably used in<br>
general. Usually, more preferred are chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbons and fluorinated hydrocarbons, and chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbons are still more preferred. Additionally, ones<br>
containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms, and more preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms are suitably<br>

and the like. More preferred are dichloromethane,<br>

carbon atoms and aralkyl esters having 7 to 12 carbon atoms,<br>
more preferred are alkyl esters having 1 to 6 carbon atoms,<br>
and still more preferred are alkyl esters having 1 to 4<br>

saturated ones are preferably used in general. Generally,<br>
ones containing 2 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 12<br>
carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms are<br>
used.<br>
As specific examples, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, acetonitrile, propiononitrile, malononitrile,<br>
butyronitrile, isobutyronitrile, succinonitrile,<br>
valeronitrile, glutaronitrile, hexanenitrile, heptylcyanide,<br>

As the nitrogen compounds other than nitriles, there<br>
may be mentioned, for example, amides such as formamide, N-<br>
methylformamide, N, N-dimethylformamide, N,N-<br>
dimethylacetoamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, and nitromethane,<br>
triethylamine, pyridine, and the like.<br>
As the sulfur compounds, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfolane, and the like.<br>
In selecting the organic solvent to be used from<br>
among the organic solvents mentioned above, such properties<br>
as boiling point and viscosity (e.g. the solvent should<br>
have a boiling point which allows appropriate warming for<br>
increasing solubility and facilitates a solvent removal<br>
from wet masses by drying and solvent recovery from<br>
crystallization filtrates and the like (about 30 to 150°C<br>
at 1 atm), a melting point such that solidification hardly<br>
occurs in handling at room temperature as well as upon<br>
cooling to room temperature or below (not lower than about<br>
0"C, preferably not lower than about 1U°C, more preferably<br>
not lower than about 20°C), and a low viscosity (not higher<br>
than about 10 cp at 20°C and the like)) are preferably<br>
taken into consideration.<br>
The oxidation prevention effect on reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 in a solvent tends to increase in a highly-concentrated<br>
solution of reduced coenzyme Gh0. Reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
shows high solubility in the above-mentioned organic<br>
solvents with high oxidation prevention effect (e.g.<br>
hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters and the like). The high<br>
solubility makes it possible to handle the highly-<br><br><br>
concentrated solution and to promote the oxidation<br>
prevention. A preferable concentration of reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10.for oxidation prevention at the time of extraction is<br>
not particularly limited, but is generally not less than<br>
0.001% by weight, preferably not less than 0.01% by weight,<br>
and more preferably not less than 0.1% by weight as the<br>
concentration of reduced coenzyme Q10 in the above-<br>
mentioned organic solvent. The upper limit is not<br>
particularly limited, however, in general, it is not more<br>
than 10% by weight.<br>
Among the above-mentioned organic solvents, to<br>
extract and recover reduced coenzyme Q10 from wet cells and<br>
dry cells of the microbial cells or disrupted product<br>
thereof, hydrophilic organic solvents are preferably used.<br>
Specifically, there may be mentioned acetone, acetonitrile,<br>
methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol and the like.<br>
Furthermore, among the above-mentioned organic<br>
solvents, to extract and recover reduced coenzyme Q10 from<br>
the aqueous suspension of the microbial cells or disrupted<br>
product thereof, hydrophobic organic solvents are<br>
preferably used. Use of such solvents assists the removal<br>
ot water-soluble substances derived from microorganisms.<br>
Many of hydrophobic organic solvents have high oxidation<br>
prevention effect as described above, thus are very<br>
advantageous.<br>
As the hydrophobic organic solvents, hydrocarbons,<br>
fatty acid esters and ethers are preferred.<br>
In the case of the above-mentioned extraction<br>
operation, when reduced coenzyme Q10 is extracted from the<br>
aqueous suspension of the microbial cells or disrupted<br>
product thereof, particularly from the aqueous suspension<br>
of the disrupted product, further particularly the case in<br>
which the disrupted product is physically treated, by an<br>
organic solvent, emulsions tend to be partly formed because<br>
of the presence of cell components such as proteins and<br><br><br>
phase separation tends to be difficult. Therefore, it<br>
becomes important to suppress the formation of emulsions<br>
mentioned above and to efficiently carry out extraction.<br>
For that, as an extraction solvent, in addition to<br>
the above-mentioned hydrophobic organic solvent, it is<br>
preferable to use a hydrophilic organic solvent as an<br>
auxiliary solvent in combination.<br>
In this case, the hydrophobic organic solvent is not<br>
particularly limited and those mentioned above may be used.<br>
Preferred are hydrocarbons, and more preferred are<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons. Among the aliphatic hydrocarbons,<br>
those having 5 to 8 carbon atoms are preferably used.<br>
As specific examples of the aliphatic hydrocarbons<br>
containing 5 to 8 carbon atoms, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, pentane, 2-methylbutane, hexane, 2-methylpentane,<br>
2, 2-dimethylbutane, 2,3-dimethylbutane, heptane, heptane<br>
isomers (e.g. 2-methylhexane, 3-methylhexane, 2,3-<br>
dimethylpentane, 2,4-dimethylpentane), octane, 2,2,3-<br>
trimethylpentane, isooctane, cyclopentane,<br>
methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane,<br>
ethylcyclohexane, and the like. Particularly preferred are<br>
hexane, heptane and methylcyclohexane, and most preferred<br>
are hexane and heptane.<br>
The hydrophilic organic solvent to be used in<br>
combination with the above-mentioned hydrophobic organic<br>
solvent is not particularly limited and those mentioned<br>
above may be used. Preferred are alcohols. Among the<br>
alcohols, monohydric alcohols having 1 to 5 carbon atoms<br>
are preferably used. As specific examples thereof, there<br>
may be mentioned, for example, methanol, ethanol, 1-<br>
propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutyl<br>
alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-<br>
pentanol, 2-methyl-l-butanol, isopentyl alcohol, tert-<br>
pentyl alcohol, 3-methyl-2-butanol, neopentyl alcohol, and<br>
the like. Particularly preferred are methanol, ethanol, 1-<br><br><br>
propanol and 2-propanol, and most preferred is 2-propanol.<br>
The amounts of the above-mentioned hydrophilic<br>
organic solvent and hydrophobic organic solvent to be used<br>
are not particularly limited. But preferably, as the<br>
concentration at the time of extraction, the hydrophilic<br>
organic solvent is used in a range of 5 to 50% by volume<br>
and the hydrophobic organic solvent is used in a range of<br>
25 to 65% by volume relative to the total volume of the<br>
entire solution.<br>
In recovering reduced coenzyme Q10, the temperature<br>
at the time of extraction is not particularly limited and<br>
is generally in a range of 0 to 60°C and preferably 20 to<br>
50°C.<br>
As the extraction method, both batch extraction and<br>
continuous extraction (preferably countercurrent multistage<br>
extraction) may be used. However, the continuous<br>
extraction (preferably countercurrent multistage<br>
extraction) is preferable in terms of productivity. The<br>
stirring duration in the batch extraction is not<br>
particularly limited but is generally not less than 5<br>
minutes. The average retention time in the continuous<br>
extraction is not particularly limited but is generally nut<br>
less than 10 minutes.<br>
In recovering reduced coenzyme Q10, it is preferable<br>
to be careful so that reduced coenzyme Q10 is not<br>
decomposed (e.g. so that reduced coenzyme Q10 is not<br>
oxidized to oxidized coenzyme Q10) For that, the above-<br>
mentioned extraction (including cell disruption) is<br>
preferably carried out under an acidic to a weakly basic<br>
condition, and more preferably under an acidic to a neutral<br>
condition. In the case where a pH is used as an index,<br>
although it depends on the contact time, the pH is<br>
generally not more than 10, preferably not more than 9,<br>
more preferably not more than 8, and still more preferably<br>
not more than 7.<br><br><br>
By the above-mentioned conditions, an oxidation<br>
reaction can be substantially prevented and, optionally,<br>
more strictly, the above-mentioned cell disruption and/or<br>
extraction are preferably carried out under the condition<br>
that reduced coenzyme Q10 is protected from an oxidation<br>
reaction. It is preferable to carry out at least the<br>
extraction under this condition, and it is more preferable<br>
to carry out the disruption and the extraction under this<br>
condition.<br>
As "the condition that reduced coenzyme Q10 is<br>
protected from an oxidation reaction" means, for example, a<br>
deoxygenized atmosphere (an atmosphere of an inert gas such<br>
as nitrogen gas, carbon dioxide gas, helium gas, argon gas<br>
or hydrogen gas, reduced pressure, a boiling condition); a<br>
high salt concentration condition, for example, preferably<br>
a condition where salts (e.g. inorganic salts such as<br>
sodium chloride and sodium sulfate) are contained in not<br>
less than about 5% in an aqueous phase; the condition in<br>
the presence of a strong acid (e.g. an acid with a pKa<br>
value of not more than 2.5 in an aqueous solution), for<br>
example, in the presence of not less than 0.1 mole % of the<br>
strong acid relative to i mole of reduced coenzyme Q10; and<br>
the condition in the presence of an antioxidant, for<br>
example, in the concomitant presence of ascorbic acid,<br>
citric acid, salts and esters thereof (e.g. not less than<br>
0.1% by weight of them relative to reduced coenzyme Q10) .<br>
There may also be mentioned a reduction condition (a<br>
condition in which oxidized coenzyme Q10 can be converted<br>
into reduced coenzyme Q10) , for example, a condition<br>
involving a contact with a reducing agent such as<br>
dithionous acid.<br>
By the above-mentioned culture (fermentation) and<br>
extraction, reduced coenzyme Q10 can be suitably produced<br>
and recovered. Preferably, an extract containing not less<br>
than 70 mole %, preferably not less than 75 mole % of<br><br><br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 among the entire coenzymes Q10 is<br>
obtained.<br>
Thus-obtained extract containing reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
is optionally purified by column chromatography, reduction<br>
treatment, or the like and then subjected to<br>
crystallization to obtain high-purity reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
crystals. Incidentally,- also in this case, a' series of<br>
treatment steps are preferably carried out under "the<br>
condition that reduced coenzyme Q10 is protected from an<br>
oxidation reaction" mentioned above.<br>
In the present invention, oxidized coenzyme Q10 can<br>
be produced by oxidizing the above-mentioned microbial<br>
cells or disrupted product thereof and then extracting<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 by an organic solvent, or extracting<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 from the microbial cells or disrupted<br>
product thereof by an organic solvent, purifying optionally<br>
and oxidizing the resultant to oxidized coenzyme Q10.<br>
The above-mentioned oxidation may be carried out by,<br>
for example, mixing reduced coenzyme Q10 (preferably an<br>
aqueous suspension of the microbial cells or disrupted<br>
product thereof containing reduced coenzyme Q10, an extract<br>
containing reduced coenzyme Q10 or the like) with an<br>
oxidizing agent (e.g. manganese dioxide or the like) and<br>
then, for example, oxidizing the mixture at room<br>
temperature (e.g. 30°C) for not less than 30 minutes.. In<br>
the case where the microbial cells or disrupted product<br>
thereof are oxidized, the extraction operation of oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10 can be carried out in the same manner as the<br>
above-mentioned extraction operation of reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10. Thereby, oxidized coenzyme Q10 can be efficiently<br>
recovered. Incidentally, it is not necessary to carry out<br>
the recovery of oxidized coenzyme Q10 under "the condition<br>
that reduced coenzyme Q10 is protected from an oxidation<br>
reaction", which is recommended for the recovery of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 and the recovery may be carried out in<br><br><br>
consideration of general safe operation and the like. The<br>
thus-obtained oxidized coenzyme Q10 may be optionally<br>
purified by column chromatography or the like, and, finally<br>
by conducting crystallization operation, high-purity<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 crystals may be obtained.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The following examples illustrate the present<br>
invention in further detail. These examples are, however,<br>
by no means limitative of the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
Various coenzyme Q10-producing microorganisms shown<br>
in the following Tables 1 to 3 were cultured with shaking<br>
(amplitude: 2 cm, 310 reciprocation/min) at 25°C for 72<br>
hours in 10 mL of culture media [(glucose: 20 g, peptone: 5<br>
g, yeast extract: 3 g, malt extract: 3 g)/L, pH: 6.0] using<br>
test tubes (inner diameter: 21 mm, entire length: 200 mm),<br>
and the obtained broth were optionally concentrated. Under<br>
a nitrogen atmosphere, in the concomitant presence of 3<br>
parts by volume of isopropanol and 18.5 parts by volume of<br>
n-hexane relative to 10 parts by volume of the broth, the<br>
obtained solutions were vigorously shaken for 3 minutes<br>
using 10 parts by volume of glass beads (425 to 600 |im) to<br>
carry out cell disruption and extraction. The obtained<br>
hexane phases were evaporated (at 40°C) under reduced<br>
pressure and analyzed by high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC) to determine the ratio and the<br>
production amount of reduced coenzyme Q10.<br><br><br>
HPLC conditions<br>
Column: YMC-Pack 4.6 x 250 mm (manufactured by YMC.<br>
Co., Ltd.)<br>
Mobile phase: methanol/n-hexane = 85/15<br>
Flow rate: 1 mL/min<br>
Detection: UV 275 ran<br>
The results are shown in Tables 1 to 3. The ratio of<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 means a mole percentage value of the<br>
ratio of reduced coenzyme Q10 relative to the total of<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 and reduced coenzyme Q10 on the basis<br>
of the areas of the peaks of reduced coenzyme Cho and<br>
oxidized coenzyme Cho and the ratio of the mole absorption<br>
coefficients thereof (1 : 7.5).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
38<br>
(Example 2)<br>
Rhodotorula glutinis IFO1125 was aerobically cultured<br>
at 25°C for 48 hours in a culture medium (peptone: 5 g,<br>
yeast extract: 3 g, malt extract: 3 g, glucose: 20 g/L, pH:<br>
6.0) . The cells after the culture were collected by<br>
centrifugation and suspended in a phosphoric acid buffer<br>
solution at pH 7 to which N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-<br>
nitrosoguanidine have been added so as to have its<br>
concentration of 200 g/mL. After maintaining the solution<br>
at 2 5°C for 1 hour, the cells were washed for 5 times with<br>
a 0.9% NaCl solution and further suspended in a 0.9% NaCl<br>
solution. The obtained cell suspension was properly<br>
diluted and a colony was to be formed on an agar plate of<br>
the above-mentioned culture medium. The production amount<br>
and the ratio of reduced coenzyme Q10 in the isolated<br>
mutant strain were determined in the same manner as Example<br>
1. The strains having higher production amount and the<br>
ratio of reduced coenzyme Q10 as compared with those of<br>
wild strains was further mutated repeatedly. As the result,<br>
by repeating the mutagenesis for 10 times, mutant strains<br>
with productivity of not less than 15 g/mL were obtained.<br>
In this case, the ratio of reduced coenzyme Qlo was not<br>
less than 80 mole %.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
Saitoella complicata IFO 10748 was aerobically<br>
cultured at 25°C for 72 hours in 10 L of a culture medium<br>
(peptone: 5 g, yeast extract: 3 g, malt extract: 3 g,<br>
glucose: 20 g/L, pH: 6.0). The obtained cells were<br>
disrupted for 2 times at 80 MPa of disruption pressure by a<br>
pressure homogenizer (manufactured by Lanni Co.) sealed<br>
with nitrogen gas to obtain a cell-disrupted solution. The<br>
cell-disrupted solution was subjected to extraction with 30<br>
parts by volume of isopropanol and 40 parts by volume of<br>
hexane for 3 times to obtain an extract. The extraction<br><br><br>
ratio was 99%. The ratio of reduced coenzyme Q10 was 97<br>
mole %.<br>
(Example 4)<br>
When mutant strains of Rhodotorula glutinis IFO1125<br>
were aerobically cultured at 25°C in 10 L of a culture<br>
medium (peptone: 10 g, yeast extract: 5 g, malt extract: 3<br>
g, glucose: 20 g/L, pH: 6.0), glucose was fed at the rate<br>
of 4 g/h after the lapse of 48 hours to 96 hours (fed<br>
glucose amount: 190 g). The production amount of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 per culture medium was not less than 2 0 ng/mL<br>
and the ratio of reduced coenzyme Q10 was not less than 80<br>
mole %.<br>
(Example 5)<br>
The extract obtained in Example 3 was subjected to<br>
solvent substitution with a hexane solution, the resultant<br>
was adsorbed in a column filled with silica gel and<br>
subjected to development and elution by a solution of n-<br>
hexane/diethyl ether (9/1) to obtain a fraction containing<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10. Furthermore, the fraction was cooled<br>
to 2°C with stirring to obtain a white slurry. All the<br>
above-mentioned operations were carried out in a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere. The obtained slurry was filtered under reduced<br>
pressure, the resulting wet crystals were washed with the<br>
development solution same as used above (the temperature of<br>
the solvent used for washing was 2°C) , and the wet crystals<br>
were dried under reduced pressure (20 to 40°C, 1 to 30<br>
mmHg) to obtain 81 mg of white dry crystals. The purity of<br>
the obtained crystals was 99.9% and the ratio of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 was 90 mole %.<br>
(Example 6)<br>
The extract obtained in Example 3 was subjected to<br>
solvent substitution with n-hexane, the resultant was added<br><br><br>
with 50 mg of manganese dioxide, and the mixture was<br>
stirred at 30°C for 30 minutes. Thus-obtained reaction<br>
solution was fractionated and purified in the same manner<br>
as Example 5 to obtain 74 mg of high-purity oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10.<br>
(Example 7)<br>
Saitoella complicata IFO 10748 was aerobically<br>
cultured at 25°C for 72 hours in 500 mL of a culture medium<br>
(peptone: 5 g, yeast extract: 3 g, malt extract: 3 g,<br>
glucose: 20 g/L, pH: 6.0) . The obtained cells were<br>
disrupted for 2 times at 80 MPa of disruption pressure by a<br>
pressure homogenizer (manufactured by Lanni Co.) sealed<br>
with nitrogen gas to obtain a cell-disrupted solution. The<br>
ratio of reduced coenzyme Q10 in the cell-disrupted<br>
solution was 97% relative to the entire coenzymes Q10<br>
including oxidized coenzyme Q10. 200 mL of the cell-<br>
disrupted solution was mixed with isopropanol and n-hexane<br>
at the ratios shown in the first extraction section in the<br>
following Table 4 so as to adjust the total solvent amount<br>
to be 500 mL and the mixtures were stirred at 40°C for 30<br>
minutes to carry out the tirst extraction. After<br>
completion of the extraction, the resultants were kept<br>
standing for 10 minutes and the separated upper layers were<br>
collected. The volume ratios of the lower layers<br>
(residues) relative to the total solution amounts were<br>
defined as indexes of separability and shown as the<br>
interface positions in Table 4.<br>
Furthermore, in order to carry out the second<br>
extraction, the solvent concentrations of the residual<br>
layers were measured and isopropanol and hexane were<br>
further added so as to keep the solvent ratios in the<br>
entire solutions be the ratios shown in the second<br>
extraction section in Table 4. The resulting solutions<br>
were stirred at 40°C for 30 minutes. Then, the solutions<br><br><br>
were kept standing for 10 minutes and the upper layers were<br>
collected in the same manner as described above to<br>
determine the solvent concentrations of the residual layers<br>
Isopropanol and hexane were added thereto so as to keep the<br>
solvent ratios in the entire solutions be the ratios shown<br>
in the third extraction section in Table 4, and the<br>
solutions were stirred at 25°C for 30 minutes to carry out<br>
the third extraction.<br>
The ratios of the amounts of reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
contained in the collected upper layers of each of the<br>
first, second and third steps relative to the amount of<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 contained in the cell-disrupted<br>
solution or the extraction residue before the extraction<br>
were defined as the extraction ratios of reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 in the respective steps. The calculation results are<br>
shown in Table 4. The integrated extraction ratios of<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 in the second and third extraction<br>
steps are also shown. In any steps, the static<br>
separability was excellent and the integrated extraction<br>
ratio in the case where extraction was repeated for 3 times<br>
was as high as not less than 90% to show high recovery<br>
ratio. Particularly, in the case where the isopropanol<br>
concentration was adjusted to be not less than 30%, the<br>
recovery ratio was as high as not less than 99%.<br><br><br>
(Example 8)<br>
Saitoella complicata IFO 10748 was aerobically<br>
cultured at 25UC for 72 hours in 7bO L of a culture medium<br>
(peptone: 5 g, yeast extract: 3 g, malt extract: 3 g,<br>
glucose: 20 g/L, pH: 6.0). The obtained cells were<br>
disrupted for 2 times at 140 MPa of disruption pressure by<br>
a pressure homogenizer (manufactured by Lanni Co.) sealed<br>
with nitrogen gas to obtain a cell-disrupted solution. The<br>
cell-disrupted solution was subjected to continuous<br>
extraction by a countercurrent 3-step continuous extractioi<br>
apparatus shown in Fig. 1. The capacity of the stirring<br>
tank was 630 L and the capacity of the static separation<br>
tank was 200 L. The cell-disrupted solution was supplied<br><br><br>
to the first stirring tank and isopropanol and n-hexane<br>
were supplied to respective steps. The supply amount of<br>
the cell-disrupted solution was 2 L/min and the supply<br>
amounts of isopropanol and n-hexane were adjusted to be 1.3<br>
L/min for isopropanol and 3.7 L/min for n-hexane as the<br>
total of the supply amounts in respective steps. In this<br>
case, the solvent concentration in respective steps was<br>
properly adjusted so that the isopropanol concentration of<br>
5 to 50 v/v % and the n-hexane concentration of 25 to 65<br>
v/v % were kept. The extraction temperature was 40°C and<br>
the treatment duration was 6 hours. At the point after the<br>
lapse of 6 hours, the recovery ratio of reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 extracted from the cell-disrupted solution was<br>
calculated on the basis of reduced coenzyme Q10 remaining<br>
in the extraction residue in the static separation tank in<br>
the third step to find the recovery ratio of 98.9%. The<br>
static separation was well carried out during the entire<br>
operation period and stable continuous extraction was<br>
possible.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
According to the processes of the present invention,<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 can be produced cheaply on the<br>
industrial scale by considerably simple steps comprising<br>
cuituring microorganisms and recovering reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10. In addition, oxidized coenzyme Q10 can also be<br>
produced by simple processes.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A process for producing the oxidized coenzyme Q10 represented by the following<br>
formula (I):<br><br>
which comprises culturing reduced coenzyme Q10 producing microorganisms in a<br>
culture medium containing a carbon source, a nitrogen source, a phosphorus source and a<br>
