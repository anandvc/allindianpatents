Glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans, corticosterone in mice and rats) are an important class of adrenocorticosteroids that regulate many metabolic and homeostatic processes and form a key component of the response to stress. Glucocorticoids act via intracellular glucocorticoid receptors and, in some tissues, mineralocorticoid receptors; both being nuclear transcription factors. Glucocorticoid action on target tissues depends not only on circulating steroid concentrations and the cellular expression of receptors, but also on intracellular enzymes that critically determine to which extent glucocorticoids gain access to receptors in an active form. 1 Ibeta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (1 Ibeta-HSD's) catalyze the interconversion of the principal active 11-hydroxy-glucocorticoid (Cortisol in men) and their inactive 11-keto metabolites (cortisone in men).<br>
The enzyme 1 Ibeta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (llbeta-HSDl) inter-converts inactive into active glucocorticoids, thereby playing a major role in local modulation of cellular agonist concentration and thus activation of corticosteroid receptors in target tissues, approximately two-fold up regulated in adipose tissue in obese individuals. Moreover, overexpressing llbeta-HSDl in adipocytes of mice led to visceral obesity and to a syndrome-X like phenotype (Masuzaki H. et al., Science. 2001 Dec 7; 294(5549):2166-70.). Taken together, these data very strongly support an important role of llbeta-HSDl in the induction of obesity and the impairment of glucose homeostasis and lipid parameters. Thus, selective inhibition of this enzyme could lower blood glucose levels in Type 2 diabetic patients, normalize elevated lipid parameters and/or reduce weight in obese subjects .<br><br>
The first pharmacological indication that llbeta-HSDl inhibition in men might have beneficial effects were obtained by using carbenoxolone, an anti-ulcer drug which inhibits both llbeta-HSDl and the related enzyme llbeta-HSD2. Treatment with carbenoxolone led to an increase in insulin sensitivity indicating that that inhibition of llbeta-HSDl may reduce cellular cortisol levels and therefore minimizing some of its deleterious effects. (Walker et al. 1995; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 80, 31155-3159).<br>
llbeta-HSDl is expressed in many tissues including liver, adipose tissue, vascular smooth muscles, pancreas and brain. Its activity is dependent on NADP(H) and it has a relatively low affinity for its substrate (compared to llbeta-HSD2). 11 beta-HSD1 in tissue homogenates and when purified is bidirectional, exhibiting both 1 Ibeta-dehydrogenase and 1 Ibeta-reductase reactions, with greater stability of the dehydrogenase activity (P.M. Stewart and Z.S. Krozowski, Vitam. Horm. 57 (1999), pp. 249-324). However, when the enzyme activity is tested in intact cells, the 1 Ibeta-reductase activity predominates, which regenerates active glucocorticoids from inert 11-keto forms. Such glucocorticoid regeneration will increase effective intracellular glucocorticoid levels and thereby amplifying glucocorticoid activity. It is this elevated cellular cortisol concentration that might lead to increased hepatic glucose production, adipocyte differentiation and insulin resistance.<br>
Inhibition of llbeta-HSDl should not only reduce the typical Syndrome-X / Diabetes associated symptoms, but it should also be save and without major side effect. Studies with the unspecific inhibitor carbenoxolone highlight the importance of developing specific llbeta-HSDl inhibitors. The inhibition of the llbeta-HSD2 enzyme is badly tolerated and results in increased blood pressure. In contrast inhibition of llbeta-HSDl should be well tolerated since llbeta-HSDl knockout mice were found be healthy and to resist hyperglycemia provoked by obesity or stress (Kotelevtsev Y. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1997 Dec 23; 94(26): 14924-9). Similar upon starvation these mice had attenuated activation of key hepatic enzymes that are involved in gluconeogenesis. In addition, these mice had improved lipid and lipoprotein profiles suggesting that inhibition of HSD1 might be highly efficacious and safe. Recent reports indicate that llbeta-HSDl inhibitors might also be beneficial to reduce high blood pressure (Masuzaki H. et al., J Clin Invest. 2003 July;112(l):83-90; Rauz S. et al.,<br><br>
QJM. 2003 July;96(7):481-90) to improve cognition (Sandeep TC. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2004 Apr. 27;101(17):6734-9) or to improve Alzheimer associated deficits. Taken together 11 beta-USD 1 inhibition might be a save and efficacious approach to treat symptoms of diabetes, obesity and other diseases.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters are novel and have valuable pharmacological properties. In particular they are llb-HSDl inhibitors (T2D) and they display selectivity against the related llbeta-HSD2 enzyme. Therefore the compounds which are specific llbeta-HSDl inhibitors (T2D) represent an approach to e.g. lower blood glucose levels and normalize lipid parameters in Type 2 diabetic patients by modulating the local concentration of the active glucocorticoid cortisol in target tissue (liver, adipose tissue).<br>

Processes for the manufacture of compounds of formula I are an object of the invention.<br>
The preparation of compounds of formula I of the present invention may be carried out in sequential or convergent synthetic routes. Syntheses of the invention are shown in the following Schemes. The skills required for carrying out the reaction and purification of the resulting products are known to those persons skilled in the art. The substituents and indices used in the following description of the processes have the significance given above unless indicated to the contrary.<br>
In general, compounds of type I are readily accessible by sulfonylation of appropriately substituted 2-amino-pyridines of formula II with sulfonyl chlorides under various conditions that are known to persons skilled in the art. Examples of such conditions are - as indicated in Scheme 1 below - e.g. pyridine at elevated temperatures or THF under reflux conditions in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydride, triethyl amine or the like.<br>
(Figure Removed)Optionally, compounds of formula la with R6 is H obtained in this way can be further substituted at the sulfonamide nitrogen by treatment with a base such as sodium hydride, cesium carbonate, potassium carbonate or the like in a solvent such as DMF or THF or similar followed by alkylation of the resulting anion with an alkyl halide such as methyl iodide, ethyl bromide, benzyl bromide or the like in order to introduce the desired R6 substituent.<br>
Appropriately substituted 2-amino-pyridines of formula II are either commercially available, are known in the literature or can be made in analogy to literature procedures from known starting materials. General approaches that have been used for the<br>
synthesis of various aminopyridines of general formula II in the course of this invention are outlined below.<br>
2-Aminopyridines of formula lib with R1 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or heterocyclyl can be made according to scheme 2 from compounds of formula III via metal-catalysed (Pd or Ni) cross-coupling reaction with corresponding organometallic reagent such as heterocyclyl-, alkyl-, cycloalkyl or aryl-boron, -zink or -tin reagents using Suzuki-, Stille- or Negishi-type coupling reactions (for literature: Suzuki, Chem. Rev., 1995, 95, 2475; Stille, Angew. Chem. IEE, 1986, 25, 508; Negishi, Ace. Chem. Res., 1982, 15, 340). The corresponding organometallic reagents used are either commercially available, known in the literature or were prepared according to standard procedures known in the art. Compounds of formula lie with Rl= aminocarbonylmethyl can be prepared according to scheme 2 from compounds IV, selective lithiation with for example lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) in THF, addition of COa (dry ice) to give compounds of formula V. Subsequent coupling with appropriate amines in the presence of a coupling reagent such as benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) in acetonitrile gives compounds of formula VI, which are then de-protected with trifluoro-acetic acid in a solvent such as methylene chloride to give compounds of formula He.<br>

Compounds of formula lid with Rl= alkoxycarbonylmethyl can be prepared according to scheme 3 from protected 2-amino-6-methyl pyridines of formula VII by selective lithiation with for example with LDA, subsequent addition of COa followed by standard esterification reactions, for example with an alkohol as solvent in the presence of thionyl chloride or with an alcohol in a suitable solvent in the presence of acid, or by applying a coupling reagent as discussed above, under simultaneous removal of the trimethylsilyl protecting groups when acidic reaction conditions are applied, to give com pounds of formula lid.<br>
Compounds of formula He with Rl is alkylcarbonylmethyl can be obtained from VII via lithiation with N-butyllithium (BuLi), subsequent reaction with an appropriate alkyl nitrile and an acidic work-up to yield He. Alternatively, compounds of formula Ilc-d can be prepared from compounds of formula VIII, obtained from Ib via lithiation with LDA and COz addition, by standard esterification or amide formation reactions known in the art. Next higher homologues of above described amines of formula II, such as aminocarbonyl ethyl as Rl and the like, can be prepared from intermediates described<br>
in schemes 2,3 via homologation reactions known in the art , e.g. via Arndt-Eistert synthesis starting with compounds of formula V to give analogues with aminocarbonyl ethyl as Rl.<br>

(Figure Removed)Compounds of formula Ilf with Rl is alkoxymethyl, heterocyclylalkoxymethyl, cycloalkylalkoxyalkyl, arylalkoxymethyl, aryloymethyl, haloalkoxymethyl and the like can be prepared according to scheme 4 starting from compounds of formula IX. Accordingly, de-protonation of IX with NaH in THF and subsequent reaction with an alkyl, arylalkyl or heterocyclylalkyl halide and the like gives rise to compound of formula X. Upon hydrolysis with a base such as aqueous 3N NaOH at elevated temperature compounds of formula Ilf are obained. The aryloxymethyl analogues are prepared from X via Mitsunobu reaction. Alternatively, intermediates of formula X can be obtained from XI via reaction with an appropriate alcohol ROH in the presence of a base such as NaH and in THF as solvent. Compounds of formula XI are obtained form IX via reaction with thionyl chloride. Compounds of formula Hg with Rl= aminomethyl and the like can be prepared from XI upon reaction with an appropriate amine in acetone as solvent, in the presence of KHCOs as base and with catalytic amounts of potassium iodide, to give XII that can subsequently be deprotected to give<br><br>

Assay Procedures<br>
Transient expression and partial Purification:<br>
The cDNA encoding the human llbeta-HSDl protein was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Stratagene). This construct (for details see Alex Odermatt et al.; J Biol Chem.,1999, Vol. 274, Issue 40, 28762-28770) was used to transiently express the protein in HEK293 cells (ATCC number: CRL-1573, described in Graham, F.L., Smiley, J., Russell, W.C., Nairn, R.; (1977)) using lipofectamine. 48h after transfection cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (Phsophate buffered Saline). To 1 volume of cell suspension in PBS 2 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (50mM Tris; pH7.5; ImM EDTA; lOOmM NaCl) were added. The cells were lysed by Potter-homogenization (20 strokes). The resulting homogenate was sonicated wit a tip sonicator (10% output; 2 x 30 sec.) and cleared by a low speed centrifugation (lOmin x 9000g; 4°C). The microsomal fraction was collected by a high speed centrifugation (60 min x 110'OOOg). The resulting pellet was resuspended in storage buffer (20mM Tris pH 7.5; 1 mM<br><br>
EDTA; 10% Glycerol) and the centrifugation was repeated. The resulting pellet containing the microsomal fraction was again taken up into storage buffer and aliquots were kept frozen in liquid Nitrogen until use.<br>
Generation of stable cell lines expressing 1 Ibeta-HSDl:<br>
The same construct used for transient expression of human 1 Ibeta-HSDl was also used to establish cell lines stably expressing the protein. Briefly, (HEK293) cells were transfected with 1 Ibeta-HSDl construct using the lipofectamine reagent (Gibco BRL) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Two days after transfection, geneticin selection (0.8 mg/ml) was initiated and several stable clones were isolated. One clone was further used for pharmacological characterization.<br>
Microsome Assay<br>
Microsomes isolated from HEK293 cells transiently expressing human 1 Ibeta-HSDl (for details see above) were incubated in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl; ItnM EDTA; I mM EGTA; ImM MgCl; 250 mM Sucrose; 20 mM Tris pH 7.4; Cortisone 50-200nM and NADPH ImM) together with different concentrations of test substances. After 60 min. of incubation at 37°C the assay was stopped by heating to 80°C (5 min.) and by addition of the inhibitor Carbenoxolone (1 uM). The amount of Cortisol produced in this assay was determined using a commercially available, ELISA-based Cortisol-detection kit (Distributed by Assay Design, Inc.). Inhibitors were characterized by there IC50 values, e.g. the concentration at which the production of cortisol was 50% reduced.<br>
In this test preferred compounds as described above have IC50 values below 1000 nM; more preferred compounds have IC50 values below 100 nM. Most preferred compounds have IC50 values below lOnM.<br><br>
Cellular Assay<br>
To measure the effect of inhibitors in intact cells HEK293 cells stably expressing human llbeta-HSDl (see above) were cultivated in 96 well plates in DMEM. First inhibitors and 60 min later Cortisone was added to the cells. After 60 min of incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere part of the medium was removed and the conversion from Cortisone to Cortisol was measured using a commercially available ELISA kit (Distributed by Assay Design, Inc.).<br>
Results obtained in the microsome assay using representative compounds of the invention as the test compounds are shown in the following table:<br>
(Table Removed)Compounds as described above have ICso values below 1000 nM; preferred compounds have ICso values below 100 nM. More preferred compounds have ICso values below 10 nM. These results have been obtained by using the foregoing test.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments (e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations). The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered internally, such as orally (e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, , hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions), nasally (e.g. in the form of nasal sprays) or rectally (e.g. in<br>
the form of suppositories). However, the administration can also be effected parentally, such as intramuscularly or intravenously (e.g. in the form of injection solutions).<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic adjuvants for the production of tablets, coated tablets, drage"es and hard gelatin capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc. can be used, for example, as such adjuvants for tablets, drage"es and hard gelatin capsules.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for soft gelatin capsules, are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid substances and liquid polyols, etc.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose, etc.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils, etc.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid or liquid polyols, etc.<br>
Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, viscosity-increasing substances, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
In accordance with the invention the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used for the prophylaxis and treatment of arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal failure and particularly eating disorders and obesity. The dosage can vary in wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 0.1 mg to 20 mg per kg body weight, preferably about 0.5 mg to 4 mg per kg body weight (e.g. about 300 mg per person), divided into preferably 1-3 individual doses, which can consist, for example, of the same amounts,<br>
should be appropriate. It will, however, be clear that the upper limit given above can be exceeded when this is shown to be indicated.<br>
