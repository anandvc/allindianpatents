				<td>OPHTHALMIC OIL-IN-WATER TYPE EMULSION WITH STABLE<br>
POSITIVE ZETA POTENTIAL<br>
The present invention concerns ophthalmic cationic oid-<br>
in water type emulsions having a zeta potential remaining<br>
positive overtime.<br>
By "ophthalmic emulsion"/ it is meant an emulsion which<br>
is suitable for an ocular application and which may have a<br>
pharmaceutical effect or a cosmetic effect.<br>
Emulsions according to the invention have a zeta<br>
potential remaining positive overtime that is, they are<br>
stable overtime.<br>
Stability is defined as the extent to which a product<br>
retains, within specified limits and throughout its period<br>
of storage and use (i.e., its shelf life), the same<br>
properties and characteristics that it possessed at the time<br>
of manufacture. The purpose of stability testing is to<br>
provide evidence on how the quality of a drug substance or<br>
drug product varies overtime under the influence of a<br>
variety of environmental factors such as temperature,<br>
humidity and light, and enables recommended storage<br>
conditions, re-test periods and shelf lives to be<br>
established.<br>
Although real-time stability studies include an<br>
evaluation of those factors that ultimately affect the<br>
expiration date of the drugs, they are time and cost-<br>
consuming. Conventionally, accelerated stability studies are<br>
used for predicting the shelf life of pharmaceutical<br>
products. Such accelerated studies subject the systems to a<br>
temperature of 40°C during at least 6 months.<br>
In order to understand the intrinsic stability<br><br>
mechanism of the system by establishing degradation pathways<br>
and identifying the likely degradation products, and thus to<br>
adjust the analytical procedures to be used, the Applicant<br>
has developed stress stability testing during which the<br>
emulsions are subjected to extreme conditions that is a<br>
temperature of 80°C during specified period of time.<br>
Mathematical extrapolations, such as the Arrhenius<br>
equation, are then used to calculate the product's predicted<br>
shelf life. Application of Arrhenius equation in<br>
pharmaceutical stability testing is straightforward. In the<br>
isothermal method, the system to be investigated is stored<br>
under several high temperatures with all other conditions<br>
fixed. Excess thermal exposure accelerates the degradation<br>
and thus allows the rate constants to be determined in a<br>
shorter time period.<br>
In recent years, oil-in-water type emulsions, in<br>
particularly emulsions having droplets of a submicron size<br>
(hereinafter "submicron emulsions") gained increasing<br>
importance, in particular as vehicles for delivery of<br>
hydrophobic drugs.<br>
However, stabilizing emulsions, including submicron<br>
emulsions, may be a concern for one skilled in the art. One<br>
known approach to stabilize an emulsion is to confer an<br>
electrostatic charge to the droplets surface which will<br>
result in droplet repulsion and less droplet coalescence.<br>
Colloidal particles dispersed in a solution are electrically<br>
charged due to their ionic characteristics and dipole<br>
attributes. This charge, which can be negative resulting in<br>
anionic emulsions or positive producing cationic emulsions<br>
(Klang et al., Pharm. Dev. Technology 2000, 5, 521-532) is<br>
known in the art as the "zeta potential". The zeta potential<br><br>
is a measure of the magnitude of the repulsion or attraction<br>
between particles (Washington, Adv. Drug Deliv. Reviews<br>
1996, 20:131-145) .<br>
Formulations of submicron emulsions reported in the<br>
literature are usually based on a combination of lecithins<br><br>
which are mixtures of phospholipids of various compositions<br>
obtained from natural sources, non-ionic or ionic<br>
surfactants and of oil such as vegetable oil. Lecithins<br>
generally comprise as major components phosphatidylcholine,<br>
which is neutral over a wide pH range, negatively charged<br>
phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic<br>
acid and positively charged phospholipids such as<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine. As a consequence of their<br>
composition, the colloid particles in most available<br>
phospholipid-based emulsions are negatively charged.<br>
Addition of enough amounts of cationic agents such as<br>
stearylamine, oleylamine, chitosan, {N-[i-(2,3—<br>
dioleoyloxy)propyl] -N, N,N-trimethyiammonium (DOTAP) or<br>
others can reverse this surface charge and produce a<br>
positively-charged colloid, as reflected by their zeta<br>
potential (Rabinovich-Guilatt et al., Chem Phys Lipids 2004,<br>
131:1-13; Liu et al., Pharm. Res. 1996, 13:1856- 1860, Klang<br>
et al., Int. J. Pharm. 1996, 132:33-44).<br>
In all phospholipid-containing colloids (e.g. liposomes<br>
or emulsions), a significant decrease in zeta potential is<br>
observed overtime, due to the hydrolysis of phospholipids<br>
into free fatty acids (Zuidam and Crommelin, J Pharm Sci<br>
1995, 84:1113—1119) which can be a source of toxic side<br>
effects following administration (Varveri et al., J.<br>
Photochem. Photobiol. A 1995, 91:121-124). In cationic<br>
phospholipids colloids, the decrease in zeta potential<br><br>
evidences that the system is not completely chemically<br>
stable (Tamilvanan et al., STP Pharma Sciences 2001, 11:421-<br>
426) and in some cases could result in the physical<br>
destabilization of the formulation as reflected by the<br>
droplet size.<br>
For example, in chitosan cationic formulations<br>
containing 0.25-1.5% chitosan, 0-1.5% phospholipids, 0—2.5%<br>
poloxamer in a castor: soybean oil phase, only the<br>
formulation containing poloxamer with chitosan displayed<br>
good stability during autoclaving, while the coexistence of<br>
chitosan and phospholipids resulted in a destabilization of<br>
the emulsion during sterilization. According to the authors,<br>
the interaction between the positively charged chitosan with<br>
negatively-charged phospholipids which resulted in a damaged<br>
emulsifier film around the oil droplets provoked the<br>
coalescence of the droplets (Int. J Pharm. 1999, 183:175-<br>
84) . These emulsions were evaluated further for their<br>
antimicrobial activity for mucosal or parenteral<br>
administration (Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 2002, 53:115— 23).<br>
Of particular interest are the following patents<br>
dealing with cationic emulsions for topical ocular<br>
administration:<br>
US Patent 6,007,826 discloses a cationic oil—in-water<br>
emulsion which comprises colloid particles with a positively<br>
charged interfacial film. The interfacial film is formed by<br>
cationic lipids (0.05-3% by weight) such as C10-C14 primary<br>
alkylamines (disclosed are stearylamine or oleylamine), C10—<br>
C24 primary alkanolamine or a cholesterol betainate;<br>
phospholipids (0.5-3%) and non-ionic surfactants from the<br>
group consisting of poloxamers, tyloxapol, polysorbate, and<br>
polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters (0.05-3%). The<br><br>
concentration of the oil is maintained within the 3-20%<br>
range. US Patent 6,007,826 emulsions zeta potential are not<br>
stable to thermal stress (see Tamilvanan et al., STP Pharma<br>
Sciences 2001, 11:421-426 and Example 12 as given here-<br>
after) .<br>
US Patent 6,656,460 to Benita and Lambert describes a<br>
method of treating a dry eye condition by topical<br>
application of a positive submicronic emulsion containing<br>
0.1-0.5% phospholipids, 0.5-2% emulsifying agent such as<br>
poloxamer and benzalkonium chloride as a preservative. Since<br>
these preparations contain 0.1 to 0.5% by weight of<br>
phospholipids, their zeta potential is expected to decrease<br>
at 80°C (see Example 12).<br>
Although some of the prior art emulsions may show a<br>
good physical stability regarding droplet size, there is<br>
still a need for cationic ophthalmic emulsions which are<br>
physically stable, and which do not contain a sufficient<br>
amount of any substances susceptible of affecting the zeta<br>
potential overtime, while presenting a good tolerability for<br>
ocular administration.<br>
Substances susceptible of affecting the zeta potential<br>
may be phospholipids, and any substances which become<br>
negatively charged upon storage.<br>
The amount of substances affecting the zeta potential<br>
overtime must be such that at any time, the amount of<br>
positive charges in the emulsion is above the amount of<br>
negative charges.<br>
By overtime in the meaning of this invention, it is<br>
meant a duration exceeding 1 year, preferably exceeding 2<br>
years, more preferably exceeding 3 years. In this invention,<br>
if an emulsion meets any of tests A to D requirements, it is<br><br>
believed that said emulsion has a potential zeta that is not<br>
affected overtime.<br>
By "good tolerability" in the present the invention, it<br>
is understood that the ratio therapeutic benefit to ocular<br>
discomfort is acceptable by the patient, and preferably<br>
similar to a placebo or NaCl 0.9% solution.<br>
It is generally accepted that in order to show good<br>
ocular tolerability the cation content within the<br>
formulation should not exceed 0.1%, preferably not exceed<br>
0.05% and even more preferably should not exceed 0.03%.<br>
Primary, amines such as stearylamine or oleylamine were shown<br>
to be safe for ocular administration at 0.1% or 0.3% w/v<br>
(Klang et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1994, 46:986-993)<br>
Quaternary amines such as benzalkonium chloride,<br>
benzododecinium bromide and benzethonium chloride are<br>
allowed by health authorities for ophthalmic administration<br>
up to concentration of approximately 0.03% (Furrer et al.,<br>
Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 2002, 53:263-280). Even though the<br>
presence of an important amount of cationic agent in<br>
emulsions may succeed in maintaining a stable positive zeta<br>
potential over time by cancelling emerging negative entities<br>
(see Example 13), such emulsions are not compatible with<br>
common recommendation for ophthalmic compositions. Attempts<br>
to reduce the cation concentration would lead to<br>
destabilization of the emulsions (see Example 14).<br>
It is an object of this invention to propose submicron<br>
ophthalmic emulsions including minimal amounts of cationic<br>
agent and still having and keeping a stable positive zeta<br>
potential overtime.<br>
The present invention relates to an ophthalmic oil-in-<br>
water type emulsion, which comprises colloid particles<br><br>
having an oily core surrounded by an interfacial film, said<br>
emulsion comprising at least one cationic agent and at least<br>
one non ionic surfactant, said emulsion having a positive<br>
zeta potential and meeting the zeta potential stability Test<br>
A, B, C and/or D requirements.<br>
»<br>
The emulsions according to the invention are physically<br>
stable, overtime as defined hereabove and keep a positive<br>
zeta potential in the specific measurement conditions as<br>
described in Tests A, B, C and/or D.<br>
According to the invention, the emulsions do not contain a<br>
sufficient amount of any substances susceptible of affecting<br>
the zeta potential overtime. Advantageously, the emulsions<br>
of the invention do not contain phospholipids.<br>
Zeta potential<br>
Zeta potential measures a physical property which is<br>
exhibited by any particle in suspension. Zeta potential can<br>
be used to predict behaviour of the suspension in different<br>
environments, to optimize the formulations of suspensions<br>
and emulsions as well as to predict overtime stability.<br>
In order to avoid the emulsion droplets to merge one<br>
with the other and form aggregates of successively<br>
increasing size, it is necessary to confer repulsive forces<br>
to the particles. One of the means to confer repulsive<br>
forces to a colloidal system is by electrostatic or charge<br>
stabilization. Electrostatic or charge stabilization has the<br>
benefits of stabilizing a system by simply altering the<br>
concentration of ions in the system. This is a reversible<br>
and inexpensive process.<br>
There might by many origins of this surface charge<br>
depending upon the nature of the particle and its<br><br>
surrounding medium but the most important mechanisms are the<br>
ionisation of surface groups or the adsorption of charged<br>
ions.<br>
The interaction of particles in polar liquids is not<br>
governed by the electrical potential at the surface of the<br>
particle, but by the effective potential of the particle and<br>
its associated ions. To utilize electrostatic control of<br>
dispersions, it is the zeta potential of the particle that<br>
must be measured rather than its surface charge. Charged<br>
particles will attract ions of opposite charge in the<br>
dispersant. Ions close to the surface are strongly bound;<br>
those further away form a more diffuse region. Within this<br>
region is a notional boundary, known as the slipping plane,<br>
within which the particle and ions act as a single entity.<br>
The potential at the slipping plane is known as the zeta<br>
potential. It has long been recognised that the zeta<br>
potential is a very good index of the magnitude of the<br>
interaction between colloidal particles and measurements of<br>
zeta potential are commonly used to assess the stability of<br>
colloidal systems. The zeta potential measured in a<br>
particular system is dependent on the chemistry of the<br>
surface, and also of the way it interacts with its<br>
surrounding environment. Therefore zeta potential must<br>
always be studied in a well defined environment<br>
(specifically pH and ionic strength) .<br>
Electrophoretic mobility<br>
An important consequence of the existence of electrical<br>
charges on the surface of particles is that they interact<br>
with an applied electric field. These effects are<br>
collectively defined as electrokinetic effects. If the<br><br>
motion is induced in a particle suspended in a liquid under<br>
the influence of an applied electric field, it is more<br>
specifically named electrophoresis. When an electric field<br>
is applied across an electrolyte, charged particles<br>
suspended in the electrolyte are attracted towards the<br><br>
electrode of opposite charge. Viscous forces acting on the<br>
particles tend to oppose this movement. When equilibrium is<br>
reached between these two opposing forces, the particles<br>
move with constant velocity. The velocity is dependent on<br>
the strength of electric field or voltage gradient, the<br>
dielectric constant of the mediµm, the viscosity of the<br>
medium and the zeta potential. The velocity of a particle in<br>
a unit electric field is referred to as its electrophoretic<br>
mobility. Zeta potential is related to the electrophoretic<br>
mobility by the Henry equation:<br><br>
where UE = electrophoretic mobility, z= zeta potential,<br>
e = dielectric constant, n= viscosity and f(Ka)=Henry's<br>
function.<br>
Electrophoretic determinations of zeta potential are<br>
most commonly made in aqueous media and moderate electrolyte<br>
concentration. f(Ka) in this case is 1.5, and this is<br>
referred to as the Smoluchowski approximation. Therefore<br>
calculation of zeta potential from the mobility is<br>
straightforward for systems that fit the Smoluchowski model,<br>
i.e. particles larger than about 0.2 microns dispersed in<br>
electrolytes containing more that 10-3 molar salt. For small<br>
particles in low dielectric constant media (eg non-aqueous<br>
media), f(Ka) becomes 1.0 and allows an equally simple<br><br>
calculation. This is referred to as the Huckel<br>
approximation.<br>
Tests A, B, C and D<br>
Test A consists in measuring the stability of the<br>
emulsion zeta potential under thermal stress conditions.<br>
Zeta potential of the emulsion is measured at T=0, i.e.<br>
as soon as the emulsion has been prepared, the obtained<br>
value being named Z0. Glass vials (Type I) of 10ml effective<br>
capacity containing between 5-10ml of emulsion and sealed<br>
under nitrogen atmosphere (without bubbling) are stored at<br>
80°C.<br>
Then at T=15 hours the zeta potential Z15h is measured.<br>
The value δA = Z15h-Z0 is then calculated.<br>
For each measurement of the zeta potential, it is<br>
operated as follows:<br>
The zeta potential of the emulsion droplet surface is<br>
determined by electrophoretic mobility in an apparatus such<br>
as a Malvern Zetasizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments, UK)<br>
equipped with suitable software and calibrated with the<br>
supplied standard.<br>
The emulsion is diluted in double distilled water if<br>
needed in order to obtain the scattering intensity allowing<br>
optimal particle detection. The sample count rate should be<br>
between 100 to 1000 KCps, in homodyne detection (if<br>
heterodyne detection is used, the contribution of the<br>
reference beam should be deduced). Three consecutive<br>
measurements are performed at 25°C using a constant cell<br>
drive of 150mV. The electrophoretic mobility is converted<br>
into zeta potential values through the Smoluchowsky<br>
equation, using the dielectric constants and viscosity of<br><br>
water. The measured value corresponds to the average of the<br>
3 obtained values.<br>
It is considered that the emulsion meets zeta potential<br>
stability Test A if δA is less than the standard error of<br>
measurements, preferably less than 10mV, and even more<br><br>
preferably less than 5mV.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the ophthalmic emulsion according to the invention meets zeta potential<br>
stability Test B.<br>
Test B is similar to Test A except that the emulsion is<br>
stored during 48 hours at 80°C, the zeta potential Z2 is<br>
measured on after 48 hours and δB = Z2 ~ZQ is calculated. The<br>
emulsion is considered as meeting the requirements of zeta<br>
potential stability test B if SB is less than the standard<br>
error of measurements, preferably less than 10mV, and even<br>
more preferably less than 5mV.<br>
According to a more advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention, the ophthalmic emulsion according to the<br>
invention meets zeta potential stability Test C.<br>
Test C is similar to Test A except that the emulsion is<br>
stored during 7 days at 80°C, the zeta potential Z7 is<br>
measured on day 7 and 8C = Z7 -Z0 is calculated. The emulsion<br>
is considered as meeting the requirements of zeta potential<br>
stability test C if δc is less than the standard error of<br>
measurements, preferably less than 10mV, and even more<br>
preferably less than 5mV.<br>
According to a still more advantageous embodiment of<br>
the invention, the ophthalmic emulsion according to the<br>
invention meets zeta potential stability Test D.<br><br>
Test D is similar to Test A except that the emulsion is<br>
stored during 14 days at 80°C, the zeta potential Z14 is<br>
measured on day 14 and δD = Z14 -zo is calculated. The<br>
emulsion is considered as meeting the requirements of zeta<br>
potential stability test D if δD is less than the standard<br>
error of measurements, preferably less than 10mV, and even<br>
more "preferably less than 5mV.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the<br>
concentration of the cationic agent is comprised between<br>
0.001 and 0.1%, preferably between 0.002 and 0.05%, and<br>
still more preferably between 0.003 and 0.03% by weight of<br>
the total weight of the emulsion (w/w).<br>
Advantageously, the concentration of the oil is not<br>
higher than 7%, preferably about 0.5 to 5%, and still more<br>
preferably about 1 to 3% by weight of the total weight of<br>
the emulsion (w/w).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the weight<br>
ratio cationic agent/oil is comprised between 0.0025 and<br>
0.06, preferably between 0.005 and 0.04, preferably from<br>
0.01 to 0.02.<br>
In the emulsion according to the invention, the<br>
concentration of non-ionic agent is less than 1%, preferably<br>
comprised between 0.01 to 0.6% by weight of the total weight<br>
of the emulsion (w/w) .<br>

the invention, the cationic agent is selected in the group<br>

Example 1: Preparation of cationic emulsions wherein<br>
the cationic agent is CTAB<br>
The oily phase components were successively weighed in<br>
the same beaker and then magnetically stirred under a slight<br>
heating (40°C) until a yellow, limpid and slightly viscous<br>
phase is obtained. Aqueous phase components were<br>
successively weighed in the same beaker and then<br>
magnetically stirred under a slight heating (40°C) until a<br>
transparent, limpid and fluid phase is obtained. Both phases<br>
were heated to 65°C. The coarse emulsion was formed by rapid<br>
addition of the aqueous phase in the oily phase and was then<br>
rapidly heated to 75°C. The aqueous phase and coarse<br>
emulsion beakers were protected by a film to avoid any water<br>
evaporation. The emulsion was white and slightly<br>
transparent. The emulsion droplet size was then decreased by<br>
a 5 minutes high shear mixing with a POLYTRON PT 6100. The<br>
emulsion became milky. The emulsion temperature was cooled<br>
down to 20°C using an ice bath.<br>
The final emulsion was obtained by homogenization in a<br>
microfluidizer (C5, Avestin) using continuous cycles for 5<br>
min at a pressure of 10,000 psi. The emulsion was milky,<br>
very fluid and did not adhere on the glass. The emulsion<br>
temperature was decreased to 25°C. Its pH was measured and<br><br>
then adjusted to 8.00 using a 0.1 M HC1 or 0.1 M NaOH<br>
solution. Emulsion was conditioned in tinted glass vials<br>
with nitrogen bubbling and then sterilized in an autoclave<br>
20 minutes at 121°C.<br>
The mean particle size of the emulsions droplets was<br>
determined by quasi-elastic light scattering after dilution<br>
in water using a High Performance Particle Sizer (Malvern<br>
Instruments, UK) . The electrophoretic mobility was measured<br>
at 25°C in a Malvern Zetasizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments,<br>
UK) following a 1:200 dilution in double distilled water as<br>
detailed above.<br><br>

Methods:<br>
Ten (10) New Zealand White albino rabbits per group (5<br>
males and 5 females) were involved in this study. Treatments<br>
(50 nl ocular topical administrations) were given four times<br>
a day for 28 consecutive days. General tolerance (body<br>
weight, food and water consumptions/ general aspect,<br>
clinical signs, hematology and blood biochemistry), ocular<br>
tolerance (observations with an ophthalmoscope, slit lamp<br>
examinations and ocular histology) and necropsy (gross<br>
macroscopic examination, main organ weights) were<br>
investigated. A statistical analysis (MANOVA LSD test) was<br><br>
also performed on body and organ weights, on food and water<br>
consumption data, and on hematological and biochemical<br>
parameters<br>
Results:<br>
General behaviour, food consumption and water<br>
consumption, body weight, organ weights were unaffected by<br>
treatments. There were no remarkable observations at<br>
necropsy due to treatment. Ophthalmological observations and<br>
microscopic examinations of the eyes and adnexa revealed no<br>
adverse effects. Ocular reactions were confined to slight<br>
conjunctival redness that were observed in all animals in<br>
the study and are commonly observed in rabbits after<br>
multiple instillations of ophthalmic products<br><br>
