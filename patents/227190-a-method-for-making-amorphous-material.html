This invention relates to plasma spraying.<br>
Description of Related An<br>
Plasma spraying to provide amorphous, ceramic, metal, metallic alloy, and intcrmetallic materials is well known in the art. While plasma spraying is commonly used for surface modification and/or to provide coatings, it has also been used to form bulk materials.<br>
Plasma spraying is typically conducted by introducing feed particles into a plasma (typically at temperatures over JO,000Â°C), to convert the feed particles into a melt (molten droplets), which are then brought in contact with a substrate to cool them (typically at cooling rates over 10,000oC/scc). Upon contact with the substrate, the molten droplets rapidly solidify resulting in an amorphous, partially crystalline, or crystalline material.<br>
Plasma spray processing has been used to form a variety of materials including, metals, metallic alloys, mtermctallies, and ceramics. Depending, for example, on the length of the operation, the operating conditions, the substrate, and feed material, a variety of structures varying from thin, thick, multi-layered and composite films to bulk materials may be deposited. Furthermore, the nature of the deposited materials, such as the composition, density, the structure can be varied continuously or in a stepwise manner.<br>
Plasma-sprayed coatings and bulk materials are employed in a wide array of applications ranging from microelectronic components to large engineered structures. For example, the plasma sprayed coatings find applications as protective (abrasion-,oxidation-, and corrosion-resistant, thermal-barrier) coatings. Similarly, use of plasma processing for making bulk materials is increasing.<br>
Among the wide variety of plasma processed materials, oxide ceramics hold a special place due to their desirable properties including their insulating abilities and abrasive, corrosive, and thermal-shock resistance. The most commonly plasma-spray<br><br>
processed oxide ceramics have been alumina, alumina-titania, stabilized zirconia, and chromia.<br>
The very high quench rales typically associated with plasma-spray processing facilitate formation of non-equilibrium, mctastable or non-stoichiometrie phases, For example, plasma-sprayed alumina, and alumina-titania typically form mctastable transitional alumina. Similarly, p! asm a-sprayed fully-oi" partially- stabilized zirconia typically form non-equilibrium tetragonal phase.<br>
In another aspect, the relatively high quench rates associated with plasma-spraying can lead to the formation of ceramics with extremely Fine (such as nanocrystalline) crystals within each splat {i.e., within each solidified droplet) making up the plasma-sprayed ceramic. In genera!, it is known in the art that ceramics with fine crystalline structures, particularly in combination with high density (i.e., at least 70% of theoretical, preferably at least 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or even 100%) have more desirable properties as compared to coarser and/or less dense materials.<br>
There is a continuing desire for new materials to use for plasma spraying, as well as new plasma sprayed materials.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
An exemplary, and in some embodiments preferred, thermal spray or plasma spray apparatus 400 including plasma spray gun 401 is diagrammatically illustrated in FIG. 4. Plasma spray gun 401, generally, is adapted to generate plasma gasjet 416 substantially symmetric about jet axis 417. Plasma gasjet 416 contains mcta! oxide droplets 407.<br>
Plasma spray gun 401 includes housing 403 having nozzle 402 located therein. Nozzle 402 forms nozzle bore 405 adapted to direct and focus plasma gas jet 416 in a delivery direction 418. To produce plasma gas jet 416, plasma spray gun 401 includes various electrodes. For example, in the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 4, first electrode 404 is located proximate an entrance to nozzle 402 and is configured as a cathode (e.g., connected to a negative terminal of a power supply (not shown)). Nozzle 302 may itself form second electrode 402' configured as an anode (e.g., connected to a positive terminal of the power supply). While the actual materials used to form first and second electrodes 404 and 402' may vary, one exemplary embodiment of plasma spray gun 401 utilizes first electrode 404 made from tungsten or tungsten alloy and second electrode 402' (nozzle 402) made from copper or copper alloy.<br><br>
Those of skill in the art will realize that this electrode configuration is merely exemplary and that other electrode configurations are certainly possible. For example, the polarity and/or material of the first and second electrodes may be different that described above. Alternatively, for example, second electrode 402' may be independent of nozzle 402. In fact, most any electrode configuration that yields an acceptable plasma spray is possible without departing from the scope of the invention-Arc gas inlet 414 may be provided to allow for the introduction of arc gas 410 into gas chamber 412 of housing 403. While most any gas complimentary to arc formation is potentially suitable, preferred arc gases include argon, helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and combinations thereof.<br>
One or more carrier conduits 420 may be formed in housing 403. As further described below, carrier conduits 420 may deliver particles 430 to plasma gas jet 416. While the actual geometry of earner conduits 420 may vary, they are, in one embodiment, formed by holes drilled to intersect nozzle bore 405. In the illustrated embodiment, each earner conduit 420 intersects bore 405 at or proximate the smallest diameter of bore 405.<br>
One or more carrier conduits 420 are each preferably symmetric about conduit axis 422. Each conduit axis 422 may intersect jet axis 417 at angle 424 of 75 degrees or less, wherein one or more carrier conduits 420 diverge or extend away from jet axis 417 in delivery direction 418. In some embodiments, angle 424 is preferably 45 degrees to 75 degrees, and more preferably, 60 degrees to 75 degrees;<br>
Other configurations of carrier conduits 420 are also possible without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, conduits 420 may have other (e.g., nonÂ¬linear) shapes, or they may penetrate bore 405 at a point offset from its centerline. These and other conduit configurations are certainly possible if they are operable to direct particles within conduit 420 to plasma gas jet 416 aiong particle delivery vector 426, where; particle delivery vector 426 intersects jet axis 417 at angle 424 of 75 degrees or less; and the particle delivery vector 426 comprises vector component 426' having a direction that is substantially opposite delivery direction 418. Once again, in some embodiments, angle 424 is preferably 45 degrees to 75 degrees, and more preferably, 60 degrees to 75 degrees.<br><br>
Although the term "intersects" is used herein, those of skill in the art will realize that conduit axis 422 may not necessarily be coplanar with jet axis 417 {e.g., one may be skewed with respect to the other). In these instances, it is understood that "intersects" indicates angle 424 between the two axes when the axes arc moved parallel to themselves to a common point of intersection.<br>
Having described plasma gas jet 401 in detail, operation of the same in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is now described.<br>
Arc gas 410 may be introduced into chamber 412 and accelerated through converging bore 405 of nozzle 402 as described above. When first electrode 404 and second electrode 402' are coupled to respective terminals of a power supply, an electric field is created between first electrode 404 and nozzle 402. The resulting plasma gas jet 416 exits housing 403 in delivery direction 418 alongjet axis 417, the latter which is substantially parallel and coaxial to axis 406 of nozzle 402. A cooling system, represented by arrows 408 in FIG. 4, may be activated to maintain the temperature of housing 403 at the desired levels.<br>
To generate the desired spray of droplets 407, particles 430 are delivered to the plasma gas jet 416 through earner conduits 420. In one embodiment, the particles 430 are entrained in a earner "as that travels through carrier conduits 420 toward the nozzle bore 405. While nitrogen is preferred, other carrier gases may be used. When the metal oxide particles 430 reach plasma gas jet 416, at least a portion are at least partially liquefied to form the desired droplets 407. Droplets 407 may then be cooled and deposited on a substrate or otherwise collected.<br>
By orienting carrier conduits 420 as shown and described herein, particles 430 achieve increased residence time within plasma gas jet 416. This longer residence time allows for the production of courser droplets 407 when compared to droplets produced by existing apparatus and methods.<br>

In addition, or alternatively, the HfOj source may contain, or provide Hf02, as well as other metal oxides such as Zr02.<br>
Other useful metal oxide may also include, on a theoretical oxide basis, BaO, CaO, Cr203, CoO, Fe203, Ge02, Li20, MgO, MnO. NiO, Na2G, Sc203, SrO, Ti02, ZnO, and combinations thereof. Sources, including commercial sources, include the oxides themselves, complex oxides, ores, carbonates, acetates, nitrates, chlorides, hydroxides, etc. These metal oxides are added to modify a physical property of the resulting abrasive particles and/or improve processing. These metal oxides are typically are added anywhere from 0 to 50% by weight, in some embodiments preferably 0 to 25% by weight and more preferably 0 to 50% by weight of the glass-ceramic depending, for example, upon the desired property.<br>
In some embodiments, it may be advantageous for at least a portion of a metal oxide source (in some embodiments, preferably, 10 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or even at least 50 percent by weight) to be obtained by adding particulate, metallic material comprising at least one of a metal (e.g., Al, Ca, Cu, Cr, Fe, Li, Mg, Ni, Ag, Ti, Zr, and combinations thereof), M, that has a negative enthalpy of oxide formation or an alloy thereof to the melt, or otherwise metal them with the other raw materials. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that the heat resulting from the exothermic reaction associated with the oxidation of the metal is beneficial in the formation of a homogeneous melt and resulting amorphous material. For example, u is believed that the additional heat generated by the oxidation reaction within the raw material eliminates or<br><br>
minimizes insufficient heat transfer, and hence facilitates formation and homogeneity of the melt, particularly when forming amorphous particles with \, y, and z dimensions over 150 micrometers. It is also believed that the availability of the additional heat aids in driving various chemical reactions and physical processes (e.g., densification. and sphcrodization) to completion. Further, it is believed for some embodiments, the presence of the additional heat generated by the oxidation reaction actually enables the formation of a melt, which otherwise is difficult or otherwise not practical due to high melting point of the materials. Further, the presence of the additional heat generated by the oxidation reaction actually enables the formation of amorphous material that otherwise could not be made, or could not be made in the desired size range. Another advantage of the invention include, in forming the amorphous materials, that many of the chemical and physical processes such as melting, densification and sphcrodizing can be achieved in a short time, so that very high quench rates be can achieved. For additional details, see copending application having U.S. Serial No. 10/211,639, filed August 2, 2002.<br>
The feed particles for carrying out the process of the invention can be of a variety of sizes, although typically the feed particles have an average size below 100 micrometers, typically in a range of 20-40 micrometers. Excessively small particles can be undesirably difficult lo handle, while panicles that are loo coarse may not completely or uniformly melt. The feed particles can be agglomerated together into particles (i.e., the various raw materials arc agglomerated together into particles). Particles made, for example, by plasma spraying or a flame forming process can also be used as feed particles. Surprisingly, amorphous particles generated by plasma sphcrodization, or flame forming processes arc particularly useful feed panicles, even with diameters larger than 100 micrometers.<br>
Further, for example, the f^ccd particles maybe prepared by dry milling raw materials to provide the desired particle size and/or uniformly of mixture. Particulate, including milled material may be made into a slurry and spray dried to provide feed particles. The feed panicles can also be screened to provide a desired particle size distribution.<br>
Further with regard to generating a plasma and melting the feed particles a variety of DC, AC. RF plasma processing systems can be used. For some embodiments, it is<br><br>
preferred thai there is sufficient power to uniformly and completely melt the feed particles. Suitable plasma systems useful for the invention typically have about 40 k\V of power although smaller or larger systems may be useful depending, for example, on the production demands.<br>
Gases for generating the plasma include those known in the art such as argon, helium, nitrogen, hydrogen, and mixtures thereof. Most commonly, argon gas is used as the plasma gas, but to increase the enthalpy (i.e., the heat content of the plasma, one or more of helium, hydrogen, or nitrogen) may also be added.<br>
The feed panicles are commonly introduced into the plasma by a carrier gas. Gases for delivering the feed particles to the plasma gas jet include argon, helium, nitrogen, and mixtures thereof. The earner gas maybe same as the plasma gas (i.e., argon) or it may provide the second or the third gas to modify the energetics of the plasma. Surprisingly, it was found that when nitrogen is used to deliver the particles, the size of the plasma jet increases significantly. The larger plasma jet size is beneficial, for example, because it tends to increased residence time of the feed particles in the plasma jet, and thus enhanced, often desirable heat transfer to the particles, which in turn tends to lead to more complete and homogeneous melt formation, and a denser and stronger plasma sprayed material. It is also possible, for example, to introduce the fed into the plasma along the axis of the plasma jet in the particulate form or as a feed stick (the feed material is formed in to a rod shape and is fed into the plasma slowly as the tip of the rod is molten and broken into droplets, which are then sprayed by the plasma jet)<br>
In some embodiments, the feed particles can be introduced into the plasma just outside of the gun. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that feeding the feed particles into the plasma through an orifice machined in the anode of the plasma gun desirably increases the residence time or the interaction of the particles in the plasma, fn another aspect, some cases, although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that the residence time or the interaction of the feed particles in the plasma may be desirably changed (e.g., increased) by orienting the orifice towards the front or back of the gun at an angle (e.g., at least 10, 20 or 30 degrees, etc.).<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the plasma processing may be carried out in air, in a blanket of gasses, at higher or lower pressures, even under vacuum.<br><br>
The melt from the plasma is typically sprayed onto a substrate or into a liquid (e.g., water), although the liquid may also be on a substrate. The substrate or liquid aid in cooling the melt. In some cases, it is desirable to provide a coating onto a substrate. In other cases, the substrate may be merely serving to cool and collect material which is subsequently removed from the substrate (e.g., bulk material is provided).  It is understood that then substrate is selected to be of sufficient integrity to withstand the heat from the plasma. Common substrate materials are metals and ceramics.. With regard to using liquid to cool the plasma sprayed melt, the result is typically particulate, most commonly in the form of spheres or beads (e.g., in some embodiments having a diameter(s) in a range from about 1, to at least 150 micrometers). Although for some embodiments of the invention that specify particular compositions of the particles, embodiments are directed to amorphous materials, for those not specifying particular compositions, the resulting plasma sprayed material may be amorphous material or crystalline material (including nanosized crystal and coarser).<br>
Surprisingly, embodiments of the present invention can provide amorphous materials having x, y, and i dimensions each perpendicular to each other, wherein each of the x, y, and z dimensions is at least 1, 5, 10, 25 micrometers (in some embodiments, preferably, at least at least 30 micrometers, 35 micrometers, 40 micrometers. 45 micrometers, 50 micrometers, 75 micrometers, 100 micrometers, 150 micrometers, 200 micrometers, 250 micrometers, 500 micrometers, 1000 micrometers, 2000 micrometers, 2500 micrometers, 1 mm, 5 mm, or even at least 10 mm).<br>
The mici'ostructure or phase composition (glassy/amorphous/crysiallinc) of a material can be determined in a number of ways. Various information can be obtained using optical microscopy, electron microscopy, differential thermal analysis (DTA), and x-ray diffraction (XRD), for example.<br>
Using optical microscopy, amorphous material is typically predominantly transparent due to the lack of light scattering centers such as crystal boundaries, while crystalline materia! shows a crystalline structure and is opaque due to light scattering effects.<br>
A percent amorphous yield can be calculated for beads using a -lOO-j-120 mesh size traction (i.e., the fraction collected between 150-micrometer opening size and 125-<br><br>
micrometer opening size screens). The measurements arc done in the following manner. A single layer of beads is spread out upon a glass slide. The beads are observed using an optical microscope. Using the crosshairs in the optical microscope eyepiece as a guide, beads that lay along a straight line are counted either amorphous or crystalline depending on their optical clarity. A total of 500 beads are counted and a percent amorphous yield is determined by the amount of amorphous beads divided by total beads counted.<br>
,    Using DTA. the material is classified as amorphous if the corresponding DTA trace of the material contains an exothermic crystallization event (Tx). If the same trace also contains an endothermic event (Tâ) at a temperature lower than T, it is considered to consist of a glass phase. If the DTA trace of the material contains no such events, it is considered to contain crystalline phases.<br>
Differential thermal analysis (DTA) can be conducted using the following method. DTA runs can be made (using an instrument such as that obtained from Netzsch Instruments, Selb, Germany under the trade designation "NETZSCH STA 409 DTAATGA") using a -140+170 mesh size fraction (i.e., the fraction collected between 105-micromcter opening size and 90-micrometer opening size screens). An amount of each screened sample (typically about 400 milligrams (mg)) is placed in a 100-microliter AIJJOJ sample holder. Each sample is heated in static air at a rate of 10Â°C/minute from room temperature (about 25Â°C) to 1100Â°C.<br>
Using powder x-ray diffraction, XRD, (using an x-ray diffractometer such as that obtained under the trade designation "PHILLIPS XRG 3100" from Phillips. Mahwah, NJ, with copper K al radiation of 1,54050 Angstrom) the phases present in a material can be determined by comparing the peaks present in the XRD trace of the crystallized material to XRD patterns of crystalline phases provided in JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards) databases, published by International Center for Diffraction Data. Furthermore, an XRD can be used qualitatively to determine types of phases. The presence of abroad diffused intensity peak is taken as an indication of the amorphous nature of a material. The existence of both a broad peak and well-defined peaks is taken as an indication of existence of crystalline matter within an amorphous matrix.<br>
For some uses of the plasma sprayed material, for example, abrasive particles and fillers, the as formed amorphous material or ceramic (including glass prior to<br><br>
crystallization) may be larger in size than that desired. The amorphous material or ceramic can be converted into smaller pieces using crushing and/or comminuting techniques known in the art, including roll crushing, canary milling, jaw crushing, hammer milling, ball milling, jet milling, impact crushing, and the like- hi some instances, it is desired to have two or multiple crushing steps. For example, after the ceramic is formed (solidified), it may be in a form larger man desired. The first crushing step may involve crushing these relatively large masses or "chunks" to form smaller pieces. This crushing of these chunks may be accomplished with a hummer mill, impact crusher or jaw crusher. These smaller pieces may then be subsequently crushed to produce the desired particle size distribution. In order to produce the desired particle size distribution (sometimes referred to as grit size oi' grade), it may be necessary to perform multiple crushing steps. In general the crushing conditions are optimized to achieve the desired particle shape(s) and particle size distribution. Resulting particles that are of the desired size may be recrushed if they are [oo large, or "recycled" and used as a raw material, for example, for plasma spraying-melting if they are too small.<br>
The shape of the ceramic (including glass prior to crystallization) may depend, for example, on the composition and/or microstmeturc of the ceramic, the geometry in which it was cooled, and the manner in which the ceramic is crushed (i.e., the crushing technique used). In general, where a "blocky" shape is preferred, more energy may be employed to achieve this shape. Conversely, where a "sharp" shape is preferred, less energy may be employed to achieve this shape. The crushing technique may also be changed to achieve different desired shapes. The resulting particle may have an average aspect ratio ranging from 1:1 to 5:1, typically 1.25:1 to 3:1 and preferably 1.5:1 to 2.5:1.<br>
It is also within the scope of the present invention, for example, to fabricate ceramics (including glass prior to crystallization) by coalescing. This coalescing step in essence forms a larger sized t^pdy from two or more smaller particles. For example, amorphous material comprising particles (obtained, for example, by crushing) (including beads and microspheres), fibers, etc. may formed into a larger particle size. For example, ceramic (including glass prior to crystallization), may also be provided by heating, for example, particles comprising the amorphous material, and/or fibers, etc. above the Ta such that the particles, etc. coalesce to form a shape and cooling the coalesced shape. The<br><br>
temperature and pressure used tor coalescing may depend, for example, upon composition of the amoiphous material and the desired density of the resulting material. The temperature should below glass crystallization temperature, and for glasses, greater than the glass transition temperature. In certain embodiments, the heating is conducted at at least one temperature in a range of about 850Â°C to about 1100"C (in some embodiments, preferably 900"C to 1000DC). Typically, the amorphous material is underpressure (e.g., greater than zero to 1 GPa or more) during coalescence to aid the coalescence of the amorphous material. In one embodiment, a charge of the particles, etc. is placed into a die and hot-pressing is performed at temperatures above glass transition where viscous flow of glass leads to coalescence into a relatively large part. Examples of typical coalescing techniques include hot pressing, hot isostatic pressure, hot extrusion and the like. Typically, it is generally preferred to cool the resulting coalesced body before further heat treatment. After heat treatment if so desired, the coalesced body may be crushed to smaller particle sizes or a desired particle size distribution.<br>
It is also within the scope of the present invention to conduct additional hcat-treatment to further improve desirable properties of the material. For example, hot-isostatic pressing may be conducted (e.g., at temperatures from about 900Â°C to about I400Â°C) to remove residual porosity, increasing the density of the material. Optionally, the resulting, coalesced article can be heat-treated to provide glass-ceramic, crystalline ceramic, or ceramic otherwise comprising crystalline ceramic.<br>
If a crystalline or partially crystalline material is desired, it is preferred to heat treat the amorphous material. Heat-treatment can be carried out in any of a variety of ways, including those known in the art for heat-treating glass to provide glass-ceramics. For example, heat-treatment can be conducted in batches, for example, using resistive, inductively or gas heated furnaces. Alternatively, for example, heat-treatment can be conducted continuously, for example, using rotary kilns.  In the case of a rotary kiln, the material is fed directly into a kiln operating at the elevated temperature. The time at the elevated temperature may range from a few seconds (in some embodiments even less than 5 seconds) to a few minutes to several hours. The temperature may range anywhere from 900Â°Cto 1600Â°C, typically between 1200Â°C to I500Â°C. It is also within the scope of the present invention to perform some of the he at-treatment in batches (e.g., for the nucleation<br><br>
siep) and another continuously (e.g., for the crystal growth step and to achieve the desired<br>
density). For the nucleation step, the temperature typically ranges between about 900Â°C to<br>
about 1100Â°C, in some embodiments, preferably in a range from about 925~C to about<br>
1050Â°C. Likewise for the density step, the temperature typically is in a range from about<br>
1 W0Â°C to about 1600Â°C, in some embodiments, preferably in a range from about 1200Â°C<br>
to about 1500Â°C. This heat treatment may occur, for example, by feeding the material<br>
directly into a furnace at the elevated temperature. Alternatively, for example, the material<br>
may be feed into a furnace at a much lower temperature (e.g., room temperature) and then<br>
healed to desired temperature at a predetermined heating rate. It is within the scope of the<br>
present invention to conduct heat-trcatment in an atmosphere other than air. In some cases<br>
it might be even desirable to heat-treat in a reducing atmosphere(s). Also, for, example, it<br>
may be desirable to heat-treat under gas pressure as in, for example, hot-isostatic press, or<br>
in gas pressure furnace. It is within the scope of the present invention to convert (e.g.,<br>
crush) the resulting article or heat-treated article to provide particles (e.g., abrasive<br>
particles).<br>
The amoiphous material is heat-treated to at least partially crystallize the<br>
amoiphous material to provide glass-ceramic. The heat-trcatment of certain glasses to<br>
i form glass-ceramics is well known in the art. The heating conditions to nucleate and grow<br>
glass-ceramics are known for a variety of glasses. Alternatively, one skilled in the art can determine the appropriate conditions from a Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) study of the glass using techniques known in the art. One skilled in the art, after reading the disclosure of the present invention should be able to provide TTT curves for amorphous materials made according to the present invention, determine the appropriate nuclealion and/or crystal growth conditions to provide glass-ceramics of the abrasive particles.<br>
Typically, glass-ceramics are stronger than the amoiphous materials from which they are formed. Hence, the strength of the material may be adjusted, for example, by the degree to which the amoiphous material is conveited to crystalline ceramic phase(s). Alternately, or in addition, the strength of the material may also be affected, for example, by the number of nucleation sites created, which may in turn be used to affect the number, tind in turn the siivc. of thfÂ» fi-vcfttc ^F ti-i" "â"â¢Â»"";Â«âuâ-~/-.\   r.       â¢ â¢â¢.-<br><br>
regarding forming glass-ceramics, see, for example Glass-Ceramics. P.W. McMillan, Academic Press. Inc., 2"d edition, 1979.<br>
For example, during heat-treat merit of some exemplary amorphous materials made according to methods according to present invention for making the glass-ceramics, formation of phases such as L^ZnO?, and, if ZrO: is present, cubic/tetragonal Z1O2, in some cases monoclinic ZrO:, have been observed at temperatures above about 900Â°C. Although not warning to be bound by theory, it is believed that zirconia-related phases are the first phases to nucleate from the amorphous material. Formation of Al203, ReAIOj (wherein Re is at least one rare earth cation), ReAlnOis, Rc3AIjO|2, Y3AI5O12, etc. phases arc believed to generally occur at temperatures above about 925CC. Typically, crystallite size during this nucleation step is on order of nanometers. For example, crystals as small as 10-15 nanometers have been observed. For at least some embodiments, heat-treatment at about 1300Â°C for about 1 hour provides a full crystallization. In generally, heat-treatment times for each of the nucleation and crystal growth steps may range of a few seconds (in some embodiments even less than 5 seconds) to several minutes to an hour or more.<br>
The size of the resulting crystals can typically controlled at least in part by the nucleation and/or crystallization times and/or temperatures. Although it is generally prcfeijcd to have small crystals (e.g., on the order not greater than a micrometer, or even not greater than a nanometer) the glass-ceramics may be made with larger crystal sizes (e.g., at least i-10 micrometers, at least 10-25 micrometers, at least 50-100 micrometers, or even greater than 100 micrometers). Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is generally believed in the art that the finer the size of the crystals (for the same density), the higher the mechanical properties (e.g., hardness and strength) of the ceramic.<br>
Examples of crystalline phases which may be present in embodiments of glass-ceramics include: A1203 (e.g., a-Al203), Y;03, REO, Hf02 ZrO: (e.g., cubic Zr02 and tetragonal ZrO:). BaO. CaO, Cr203, CoO, Fe:03, GeO:, U20, MgO, MnO, NiO, Na20, P:05, Sc20:â SiO:, SrO, TeO;, Ti02, V203, Y203, ZnO, "complex meta.1 oxides" (including "complex AhOj-meUil oxide (e.g., complex A^OyREO (e.g., ReAIOs (e.g., GdA103 LaAlO;), ReAln018 (e.g., LaAIM0|s.). and Re3AI50,2 (e.g., Dy3AI50i;)),<br><br>
complex Ai;Oy Y;0., (e.g., Y3AI5O12), and complex ZrOyREO (e.g., Rc:Z]';07 (e.g., LihZriO?))), MgAN04, TiAI^Os, and combinations thereof.<br>
It is also with in the scope of the present invention to substitute a portion of the yttrium and/or aluminum cations in a complex Al;0.vmetal oxide (e.g.. complex ANOyYiO;, (e.g.. yttrium aluminate exhibiting a garnet crystal structure)) with other cations. For example, a portion of the AI cations in a complex AbCvYiOj may be substituted with at least one cation of an element selected from the group consisting of: Cr, Ti, Sc, Fe, Mg. Ca, Si, Co, and combinations thereof. For example, a portion of the Y cations in a complex AI2O.VY1O3 may be substituted with at least one cation of an element selected from the group consisting of: Ce, Dy, Er, En, Gd, Ho. La, Lu, Nd, Pr, Sm, Th, Tm, Yb, Fe, Ti, Mn, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Mg, Ca, Sr, and combinations thereof. Similarly, it is also with in the scope of the present invention to substitute a portion of the aluminum cations in alumina. For example, Cr, Ti, Sc, Fe, Mg, Ca, Si, and Co can substitute for aluminum in the alumina. The substitution of cations as described above may affect the properties (e.g. hardness, toughness, strength, thermal conductivity, etc.) of the fused material.<br>
U is also with in the scope of the present invention to substitute a portion of the rare earth and/or aluminum cations in a complex AliOj-metal oxide (e.g., complex ANOyREO) with other cations. For example, a portion of the Ai cations in a complex AI203-REO may be substituted with at least one cation of an element selected from the group consisting of: Cr, Ti,Sc, Fe, Mg, Ca, Si, Co, and combinations thereof. For example, a portion of the Y cations in a complex AliOyREO may be substituted with at least one cation of an element selected from the group consisting of: Y, Fc,Ti,Mn, V, Cr, Co. Ni, Cu, Mg, Ca, Sr, and combinations thereof. Similarly, it is also with in the scope of the present invention to substitute a portion of the aluminum cations in alumina. For example, Cr, Ti, Sc, Fe, Mg, Ca, Si. and Co can substitute for aluminum in the alumina. The substitution of cations LIS described above may affect the properties (e.g. hardness, toughness, strength, thermal conductivity, etc.) of the fused material.<br>
The average crystal size can be determined by the line intercept method according to Uic ASTM standard E 112-96 "Standard Test Methods for Determining Average Grain Size". The sample is mounted in mounting resin (such as that obtained under the trade<br><br>
designation 'TRANSOPTIC POWDER" from Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL) typically in a cylinder of resin about 2.5 cm in diameter and about 1.9 cm high. The mounted section is prepared using conventional polishing techniques using a polisher (such as that obtained from Buehler. Lake Bluff. IL under the trade designation "ECOMET 3"). The sample is polished for about 3 minutes with a diamond wheel, followed by 5 minutes of polishing with each of 45. 30, L5, 9, 3, and 1-micromcter slurries. The mounted and polished sample is sputtered with a thin layer of gold-palladium and viewed using a scanning electron microscopy (such as the JEOL SEM Model JSM S40A). A typical back-scattered election (BSE) micrograph of the micros tructure found in the sample is used to determine the average crystal size as follows. The number of crystals that intersect per unit length (NL) of a random straight line drawn across the micrograph are counted. The average crystal size is determined from this number using the following equation.<br>
Average Crystal Size = â:â<br>
NLM<br>
Where NL is the number of crystals intersected per unit length and M is the magnification of the micrograph.<br>

More specifically with regard to vitrified bonded abrasives, vitreous bonding materials, which exhibit an amorphous structure and are typically hard, arc well known in the art. In some cases, the vitreous bonding material includes crystalline phases. Bonded, vitrified abrasive articles may be in the shape of a wheel (including cut off wheels), honing stone, mounted pointed ov other conventional bonded abrasi\e shape. A preferred vitrified bonded abrasive article is a grinding wheel.<br>
Examples of metal oxides that are used to form vitreous bonding materials include: silica, silicates, alumina, soda, calcia, potassia, titania, iron oxide, zinc oxide, lithium oxide, magnesia, bona, aluminum silicate, borosilicate glass, lithium aluminum silicate, ;ombmations thereof, and the like. Typically, vitreous bonding materials can be formed "'rom composition comprising from 10 to 100% glass frit, although more typically the imposition comprises 20% to S0% glass frit, or 30% to 70e/7 glass frit. The remaining ration of the vitreous bonding material can be a non- frit material. Alternatively, the<br><br>
vitreous bond may be derived from a non-frit containing composition.  Vitreous bonding materials arc t&gt;pically matured at a tcmperature(s) in a range of about 700Â°C to about 1500Â°C, usually in a range of about 800"C to about 1300Â°C. sometimes i:i a range of about 900JC to about 1200Â°C, or even in a range of about 950Â°C to about 1100'C. The actual temperature at which the bond is matured depends, for example, on the particular bond chemistry.<br>
Preferred vitrified bonding materials may include those comprising silica, alumina (desirably, at least 10 percent by weight alumina), and bona (desirably, at least 10 percent by weight boria). In most eases the vitrified bonding material further comprise alkali metal oxide(s) (e.g., Na;0 and K2O) (in some cases at least 10 percent by weight alkali metal oxide(s)).<br>
Binder materials may also contain filler materials or grinding aids, typically in the form of a particulate material. Typically, the particulate materials are inorganic materials. Examples of" useful fillers for this invention include: metal carbonates (e.g., calcium carbonate (e.g., chalk, calcite, marl, travertine, marble and limestone,), calcium magnesium carbonate, sodium carbonate, magnesium carbonate), silica (e.g., quart/, glass beads, glass bubbles and glass fibers) silicates (e.g., talc, cla\s, (montmorillonitc) feldspar, mica, calcium silicate, calcium mctasilicale, sodium aluminosilicaie. sodium silicate) metal sulfates (e.g., calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, sodium sulfate, aluminum sodium sulfate, aluminum sulfate), gypsum, vermiculite, wood flour, aluminum trihydrate, carbon black, metal oxides (e.g., calcium oxide (lime), aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide), and metal sulfites (e.g., calcium sulfite).<br>
In general, the addition of a grinding aid increases the useful life of the abrasive article. A grinding aid is a material that has a significant effect on the chemical and physical processes of abrading, which results in improved performance. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that a grinding aid(s) will (a) decrease the friction between the abrasive particles and the workpiece being abraded, (b) prevent the abrasive particles from "capping" (i.e., prevent metal particles from becoming welded to the tops of the abrasive particles), or at least reduce the tendency of abrasive particles to cap. f'-ij decrease the interface temperature between the abrasr. e particles and the workpiece, or (d) decreases the grinding forces.<br><br>
Grinding aids encompass a wide variety of different materials and can be inorganic or organic based. Examples of chemical groups of grinding aids include waxes, organic halide compounds, halide salts and metals and their alloys. The organic halide compounds will typically break down during abrading and release a halogen acid or a gaseous halide compound.  Examples of such materials include chlorinated waxes like tetrachloronaphtalene, pentachloronaphthalene, and polyvinyl chloride.  Examples of halide salts include sodium chloride, potassium cryolite, sodium cryolite, ammonium cryolite, potassium tetrafluoroboate, sodium tetrafluoroborate, silicon fluorides, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride. Examples of metals include, tin, lead, bismuth, cobalt, antimony, cadmium, and iron titanium. Other miscellaneous grinding aids include sulfur, organic sulfur compounds, graphite, and metallic sulfides. It is also within the scope of the present invention to use a combination of different grinding aids, and in some instances this may produce a synergistic effect. The preferred grinding aid is cryolite; the most preferred grinding aid is potassium tetrafluoroborate.<br>
Grinding aids can be particularly useful in coated abrasive and bonded abrasive articles. In coated abrasive articles, grinding aid is typically used in the supersizc coat, which is applied over the surface of the abrasive particles. Sometimes, however, the grinding aid is added to the size coat. Typically, the amount of grinding aid incorporated into coated abrasive articles arc about 50-300 g/rrf (desirably, about $0-160 g/m"). In vitrified bonded abrasive articles grinding aid is typically impregnated into the pores of the article.<br>
The abrasive articles can contain 100% abrasive particles made by a method according to the present invention, or blends of such abrasive particles with other abrasive particles and/or diluent particles. However, at least about 2% by weight, desirably at least about 5% by weight, and more desirably about 30-100% by weight, of the abrasive particles in the abrasive articles should be abrasive particles made by a method according to the present invention. In some instances, the abrasive particles made by a method according to the present invention may be blended with another abrasive particles and/or diluent particles at a ratio between 5 to 75% by weight, about 25 to 75% by weight about 40 to 60% by weight, or about 50% to 50% by weight (i.e., in equal amounts by weight). Examples of suitable conventional abrasive particles include fused aluminum oxide<br><br>
(including white fused alumina, heat-treated aluminum oxide and brown aluminum oxide), silicon carbide, boron carbide, titanium carbide, diamond, cubic boron nitride, garnet, fused alumina-iiirconia. and sol-gel-derivcd abrasive particles, and the like. The sol-gel-derived abrasive particles may be seeded or non-seeded. Likewise, the sol-gel-derived abrasive particles may be randomly shaped or have a shape associated u ith them, such as a rod or a triangle. Examples of sol gel abrasive particles include those described U.S. Pat, Nos. 4,314.S27 (.Leiiheiser et al.), 4,518,397 (Leitheiser et a!.), 4,623,364 (Cottnnger et a!.), 4.744,802 (Schwabel), 4,770,671 (Monroe et al.), 4,881.951 (Wood et al.), 5,011,508 (VValdet al.), 5.090.968 (Pellow), 5,139,978 (Wood), 5,201,916 (Berg et al.), 5,227,104 (Bauer), 5,366.523 (Rovvenhorst et al.), 5,429,647 (Larmie), 5,498,269 (Larmie), and 5,551,963 (Larmie).

In some instances, blends of abrasive particles may result in an abrasive article that exhibits improved grinding performance in comparison with abrasive articles comprising 100% of either type of abrasive particle.<br>
If there is a blend of abrasive particles, the abrasive particle types forming the blend may be of the same size. Alternatively, the abrasive particle types may be of different particle sizes. For example, the larger sized abrasive particles may be abrasive particles made by a method according to the present invention, with the smaller sized panicles being another abrasive particle type. Conversely, for example, the smaller sized<br><br>
abrasive particles may be abrasive particles made by a method according to the present invention, with the larger sized particles being another abrasive panicle type.<br>
Examples of suitable diluent particles include marble, gypsum, fhnt, silica, iron oxide, aluminum silicate, glass (including glass bubbles and glass beads), alumina bubbles, alumina beads and diluent agglomerates.

Abrasive agglomerate particles typically comprise a plurality of abrasive particles, a binder, and optional additi\es. The binder may be organic and/or inorganic. Abrasi\e agglomerates may be randomly shape or have u predetermined shape associated with them. The shape may be a block, cylinder, pyramid, coin, square, or the like. Abrasive agglomerate particles typically have particle sizes ranging from about LOO to about 5000 micrometers, typically about 250 to about 2500 micrometers. Additional details regarding abrasive agglomerate particles may be found, for example, in U.S. Pat.

The abrasive particles may be uniformly distributed in the abrasive article or concentrated in selected areas or portions of the abrasive article. For example, in a coated abrasive, there may be two layers of abrasive particles. The first layer comprises abrasive particles other than abrasive particles made by a method according to the present invention, and the second (outermost) layer comprises abrasive particles made by a method according to the present invention. Likewise in a bonded abrasive, there may be two distinct sections of the grinding wheel. The outermost section may comprise abrasive particles made by a method according to the present invention, whereas the innermost section does not.

Examples Example I<br>
A 250-ml polyethylene bottle (7.3-cm diameter) was charged with the following 50-gram mixture:   19.3 grams of alumina particles (obtained from Alcoa Industrial Chemicals, Bauxite, AR, under the trade designation "A16SG"'), 9.5 grams of zirconium oxide particles (obtained from Zirconia Sales, Inc. of Marietta, GA under the trade designation "DK-2"), and 21.2 grams of lanthanum oxide particles (obtained from Mol&gt;eorp Inc.. Mountain Pass, CA), 75 grams of isopropyl alcohol, and 200 grams of alumina milling media (cylindrical in shape, both height and diameter of 0.635 cm; 99.9% alumina; obtained from Coors, Golden, CO). The contents of the polyethylene bottle were milled for 16 hours at 60 revolutions per minute (rpm). The ratio of alumina to zirconia in the starting material was 2:1, and the alumina and zirconia collectively made up about 5S weight percent (wt-%). After the milling, the milling media were removed and the slurry was poured onto a warm (approximately 75Â°C) glass ("PYRÂ£X") pan and dried. The dried mixture was screened through a 70-mcsh screen (212-micrometer opening size) with the aid of a paint brush.<br>
After grinding and screening, the mixture of milled feed particles was fed slowly (0.5 gram/minute) into a hydrogen/oxygen torch flame to melt the particles. The torch used to melt the particles, thereby generating molten droplets, was a Bethlehem bench burner PM2D Model B obtained from Bethlehem Apparatus Co.. Hellertown, PA. Hydrogen and oxygen flow rates for the torch were as follows. For the inner ring, the hydrogen flow rate was S standard liters per minute (SLPM) and the oxygen How rate was 3.5 SLPM. For the outer ring, the hydrogen flow rate was 23 SLPM and the oxygen flow rale v. as 12 SLPM, The dried and sized particles were fed slowly (0.5 gram/minute) into the torch flame, which melted the particles and earned them on to an inclined stainless steel surface (approximately 51 centimeters (20 inches) wide with a slope angle of 45 degrees) with cold water running over (approximately 8 liters/minute) the surface to rapid!) quench the molten droplets. The resulting molten and quenched beads were colier.ed and dried at 110"C. Trie particles were spherical m shape and varied in size from a few micrometers (i.e., microns) up to 250 micrometers.<br><br>
Subsequently, the flame-formed beads having, diameters less than L25 micrometers were then passed through a plasma gun and deposited on stainless steel substrates as follows.<br>
Four 304 stainless steel substrates (76.2 millimeter (mm) x 25.4 mm x 3.175 mm dimensions), and two 10S0 carbon steel substrates (76.2 mm x 25.4 mm x 1.15 mm) were prepared in the following manner. The sides to be coated were sandblasted, washed in an ultrasonic bath, and then wiped clean with isopropyl alcohol. Four stainless steel and one 1080 carbon steel substrates were placed approximately 10 centimeters (em) in front of the nozzle of a plasma gun (obtained under the trade designation '"Praxair SG-100 Plasma Gun" from Praxair Surface Technologies, Concord, NH). The second 10S0 carbon steel was placed IS cm in front of the nozzle of the plasma gun. The coatings made on the second 10S0 carbon steel samples at a distance of 18 cm in front of the nozzle of the plasma gun were not further characterized.<br>
The plasma unit (described above with reference to FIG. 4) had a power rating of 40 kW. The plasma gas was argon (50 pounds per square inch (psi), 0.3 megapascal (MPa)) with helium as the auxiliary gas (150 psi, 1 MPa). The beads were passed through the plasma gun by using argon as the carrier gas (50 psi, 0.3 MPa) using a Praxair Model 1270 computerized powder feeder (obtained from Praxair Surface Technologies, Concord, NH). During deposition, a potential of about 40 volts and a current of about 900 amperes was applied and the plasma gun was panned left to right, up and down, to evenly coat the substrates. When the desired thickness was achieved, the plasma spray was shut off and the samples were recovered. The 1080 carbon steel substrate uas flexed, thus separating the coating from the substrate resulting in a free-standing bulk material. The deposited material had a z dimension (thickness) of about 1350 micrometers, as determined using optical microscopy.<br>
The phase composition (glassy/amorphous/crystalline) uas determined through Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) as described below. The material was classified as amorphous if the corresponding DTA trace of the material contained an exothermic crystallization event (J\). If the same trace also contained an endothermic event (Tg) at a temperature lower than Ts it was considered to consist of a glass, phase. U~ the DTA trace of the material contained no such events, it was considered to contain crystalline phases.<br><br>
Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was conducted using the following method. DTA runs were made (using an instrument obtained from Nctzsch Instruments, Sclb, Germany under die trade designation "NETZSCH ST A 409 DTA/TGA"\ using a -140+170 mesh size fraction (i.e., the fraction collected between 105-micrometer opening size and 90-micrometev opening size screens). The amount of each screened sample placed in a 100-microliter AI2O3 sample holder was about 400 milligrams. Each sample was heated in static air at a rate of I0DC/minute from room temperature (about 25Â°C) to U00Â°C.<br>
The coated material (on 304 stainless steel substrates) exhibited an endothermic event at a temperature around 8S0Â°C, as evidenced by a downward change in the curve of the trace. It is believed this event was due to the glass transition (TB) of the glass material. The same material exhibited an exothermic event at a temperature around 931Â°C, as evidenced by a sharp peak in the trace. It is believed that this event was due to the crystallization (Tx) of the material. Thus, the coated material (on 304 stainless steel substrates) and the free-standing bulk material were glassy as determined by a DTA trace.<br>
A portion of the glassy free-standing bulk material was then heat-treated at 1300Â°C for 4S hours. Powder X-ray diffraction, XRD, fusing an X-ra&gt; diffractometer (obtained under the trade designation "PHILLIPS XRG 3100" from Phillips, Mahwah, NJ) with copper K al radiation of 1.54050 Angstrom) was used to determine the phases present. The phases were determined by comparing the peaks present in the XRD trace of the crystallized material to XRD patterns of crystalline phases provided in JCPDS databases, published by International Center for Diffraction Data. The resulting crystalline material included LaAI03. ZrO; (cubic, tetragonal), LaAlnO]8, and transitional AI1O3 phases.<br>
Another portion of the glassy free-standing bulk material was crystallized at 1300'C for 1 hour in an electrically heated furnace (obtained from CM Furnaces, Bloomfield, NJ under the trade designation "Rapid Temp Furnace"). The crystallized coating was crushed with a hammer into particles of-30+35 mesh size (i.e., the fraction coIIcc:ed between 600-micrometer opening size and 500-micromctcr opening size screens;. The particles were cleaned of debris by washing in a sonic bath ("obtained trom Cole-Parmer. Vernon Hills, IL, under the trade designation "SS9L") for 15 minutes, dried at 100'C, and several were mounted on a metal cylinder (3 cm in diameter and 2 cm high)<br><br>
using carbon tape. The mounted sample was sputter coated with a thin layer of gold-palladium and viewed using a JEOL scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Mode! JSM 840AJ. The fractured surface was rough and no crystals coarser than 200 nanometers (nm) were observed (see FIG. 5) in the SEM.<br>
Example 2<br>
Feed particles were made as described in Example I using the following 50-gram mixture: 21.5 grams of alumina particles (obtained from Alcoa Industrial Chemicals, Bauxite, AR under the trade designation "A16SG"). 9 grams of zirconium oxide particles (obtained from Zirconia Sales, Inc. of Marietta, GA under the trade designation "DK-2"), and 19.5 grams of cerium oxide particles (obtained from Rhone-Poulence, France). The ratio of alumina to zirconia in the starting material was 2.4:1 and the alumina and zirconia collectively made up about 61 weight percent. Feed particles were flame-formed into beads (of a size that varied from a few micrometers up to 250 micrometers) as described in Example 1. Subsequently, the flame-formed beads having diameters between 180 micrometers and 250 micrometers were sprayed through a plasma gun and deposited on stainless and carbon steel substrates as described in Example 1.<br>
The 10S0 carbon steel substrates were flexed, thus separating the coating from the substrate resulting in a free-standing bulk material. The resulting bulk material bad a z dimension (thickness) of about 700 micrometers, as determined using optical microscopy. Tiie micros! met Lire was also observed using optical microscopy. The material consisted of generally spherical and oblique crystalline particles, which were opaque, within a predominantly amorphous matrix, which was transparent. Amorphous material is typically transparent due to the lack of light scattering centers such as crystal boundaries, while the crystalline particles show a crystalline structure and are opaque due to light scattering effects.   The crystalline phases, determined by powder XRD analysis as described in Example 1, consisted of Zi'o4Cea.<io and transitional a1></io>
A second deposition experiment was carried out using the flame-formed beads having diameters less than 125 micrometers. The resulting coating had a z dimension (thickness) of 'about 1100 micrometers, as determined using optical microscopy. The microstructure was also observed using optical microscopy. This material had similar<br><br>
features (i.e., consisted of generally spherical and oblique crystalline panicles within a predominantly amorphous matrix) to those of the material formed from beads having diameters between ISO micrometers and 250 micrometers. The crystalline phases, determined by XRD analysis as described in Example 1. consisted of Zro-iCeooOi (cubic) and transitional AI1O3.<br>
The average hardness of the as-sprayed material of this example was determined as follows. Sections of the material were mounted in mounting resin (obtained under the trade designation "TRANSOPTIC POWDER" from Buehler, Lake Bluff. IL). The resulting cvlindcr of resin was about 2.5 cm in diameter and about 1.9 cm high. The mounted section was prepared using conventional polishing techniques using a polisher (obtained from Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL under the trade designation "ECOMET 3"). The sample was polished for about 3 minutes with a diamond wheel, followed by 5 minutes of polishing with each of 45, 30, 15, 9, 3, and 1-micrometer slurries. The microhardness measurements were made using a conventional microhardness tester (obtained under the trade designation "MITUTOYO MVK-VL" from Mitutoyo Corporation. Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a Viekers indenter using a 100-gram indent load. The microhardness measurements were made according to the guidelines stated in ASTM Test Method E3S4 Test Methods for Microhardness of Materials (1991). The average microhardness (an average of 20 measurements) of the material of this example was 15 gigapascals (Gpa).<br>
Example 3<br>
Feed particles were made as described in Example 1 using the following 50-gram mixture: 27.9 grams of alumina particles (obtained from Alcoa Industrial Chemicals, Bauxite, AR under the trade designation "AI6SG"), 7.8 grams of zirconium oxide particles (obtained from Zirconia Sales, Inc. of Marietta, GA under the trade designation "DK-2"), and 14.3 grams of yttrium oxide particles (obtained from H.C. Stark New ton, MA). The ratio of alumina to zirconia of initial starting materials was 3.5:1 and the alumina and ?.iiconia collectively made up about 72 weight percent. The feed particles were then screened through a 30-mesh screen (600-micromcter opening size) and heat-treated at 1400"C for 2 hours in an electrically heated furnace (obtained from CM Furnaces, Bloomfield. NJ under the trade designation "Rapid Temp Furnace"). The heat-treated<br><br>
panicles were further screened to separate out particles with diameters between 125 micrometers and 180 micrometers, which were then passed through a plasma gun and deposited on stainless steel substrates as described in Example L<br>
The 10S0 carbon steel substrate was flexed, thus separating the coating from the substrate resulting in a free-standing bulk material. The resulting bulk material had a z dimension (thickness) of about 700 micrometers, as determined using optical microscopy. The microstructure was observed using optical microscopy. This material consisted of generally crystalline opaque particles (which retained their original angular shapes) within a predominantly transparent, amorphous matrix. The crystalline phases, determined by powder XRD analysis as described in Example 1, consisted of AI5Y3O12 and<br>
YQ isZl'ojiiOiqi.<br>
Another portion of the free-standing bulk material was crystallized at 1300Â°C for 1 hour and the fractured surface was sputter coated with a thin layer of gold-palladium and viewed using a JEOLSEM (Model JSM 340A), as described above in Example 1. The tracturcd surface was rough and no crystals coarser than 200 nm were observed (see FIG. 6).<br>
A second deposition experiment was earned out using heat-treated particles having diameters less than 125 micrometers. The resulting coating was about 1500 micrometers thick (z dimension). The microstructure was observed using optical microscopy. This material had similar features (consisted of generally opaque, crystalline particles (which retained their original angular shapes) within a predominantly transparent, amorphous matrix) to the material formed from beads having diameters between ISO micrometers and 250 micrometers. The crystalline phases, determined by XRD analysis as described in Example 1, consisted of AI5Y3O12 and Y0.15Z10S5O193.<br><br>

A thick coating consisting of various layers of the above three examples was plasma sprayed using feed particles produced in Examples 1-3. The first layer was coated as described in Example 2, the second as described in Example I, and the third as described in Example 3.<br>
The substrate was not sandblasted prior to coating sp that it was removed easily by plying it apart by hand, resulting in a free-standing bulk material, approximately 75 millimeters (mm) x 25 mm x 7.5 mm. A cross-section, cutting through each layer, was sectioned from the material using a diamond saw. The sectioned piece was mounted in mounting resin (obtained under the trade designation "TRANSOPTIC POWDER" from Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL) such that the different layers were visible. The resulting cylinder of resin was about 2.5 cm in diameter and about 1.9 cm tall (i.e., high). The mounted section was prepared using conventional polishing techniques using a polisher (obtained from Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL under the trade designation "ECOMET 3"). The sample was polished for about 3 minutes with a diamond wheel, followed by 5 minutes of polishing with each of 45, 30, 15, 9, 3, and 1-micrometer slurries.<br>
The first layer had a z dimension (thickness) of approximately 2.5 mm, as determined using optical microscopy. The microstructure was observed using optical microscopy. This material had similar features to those of the material of Example 2 (i.e., consisted of generally spherical and opaque crystalline particles within a predominantly transparent, amorphous matrix). The second layer had a z dimension (thickness) of approximately 2 mm, as determined using optical microscopy. The micros tincture was also observed using optical microscopy. This material had similar features to those of the material of Example 1 (i.e., was transparent suggesting it was amorphous). The third layer had a z dimension (thickness) of approximately 3 mm, as determined using optical microscopy. The microstructure was also observed using optical microscopy. This material had similar features to those of the material of Example 3 (i.e., it consisted of generally opaque crystalline particles (which mostly retained their original angular shapes) within a predominantly transparent, amorphous matrix).<br><br>
Comparative Example A<br>

Example 5<br>
Feed particles were made as described in Example 1 using the following 50-gram mixture:  19.3 grams of alumina particles (obtained from Alcoa Industrial Chemicals, Bauxite, AR under the trade designation "A16SG"), 9.5 grams of zirconium oxide particles (obtained from Zirconia Sales, Inc. of Marietta, GA under the trade designation "DK-2"). and 21.2 grams of lanthanum oxide particles (obtained from Molycorp Inc., Mountain Pass, CA). The feed particles were then screened through a 30-mesh screen (600-micromtcr opening size screen) and heat-treated at 1400Â°C for 2 hours in an electrically heated furnace (obtained from CM Furnaces, Bloomfield, NJ under the trade designation "Rapid Temp Furnace").<br>
The heat-treated particles were further screened to separate out particles with .. diameters smaller than 100 micrometers, which were then sprayed through a plasma gun.:<br><br>
(obtained under the trade designation "Praxair SG-100 Plasma Gun" from Praxair Surface Technologies, Concord, NH), and into a cylindrical port attached perpendicularly to a cylindrical steel container covered on top with baffles, to collect plasma-sprayed particles. The feed particles were fed (using a Praxair Model 1270 computerized powder feeder obtained from Praxair Surface Technologies, Concord, NH) into the plasma through an orifice in the anode of the plasma gun. The feed orifice was tilted approximately 30 degrees towards the back of the plasma gun to increase the residence time of the particles in the plasma.<br>
Nitrogen gas was used as the earner gas to transport the feed into the plasma. The plasma gases of argon, helium (auxiliary gas), and nitrogen (auxiliary and carrier gas) Formed a highly energetic "tri-gas" plasma to uniformly melt the particles. The following conditions were used: Gun current of 1150 Amperes, Potential of 52 Volts, Arc gas (argon at 0.28 MPa (40 psiÂ», Auxiliary gas (helium at 0.28 MPa (40 psi)), Auxiliary gas (nitrogen at 0.28 MPa (40 psi)), Carrier gas (100 volume percent nitrogen at 0.28 MPa (40 psi)).<br>
Optical microscopy observation of the resulting plasma-sprayed particles showed a mixture of spherical, elongated, and splat-like shapes, which were predominantly transparent or amorphous. Amorphous material is typically transparent due to the lack of light scattering centers such as crystal boundaries, while the crystalline particles arc opaque due to light scattering effects of the crystal boundaries.<br>
The plasma-sprayed particles were crystallized at 1300Â°C for 1 hour in an electrically heated furnace {obtained from CM Furnaces, Bloomfield, NJ under the trade designation "Rapid Temp Furnace"). The crystalline phases were determined by powder XRD analysis as described in Example i. The resulting crystalline material included LaAlOj, Z1O2 (cubic, tetragonal), LaAInOis, and transitional ANOj phases.<br>

Plasma-sprayed particles were made according to Example 5, except the "Praxair<br>
SG-100 Plasma Gun" was modified using a Miller Thermal 20S9 A extension nozzle<br>
(obtained from Praxair Surface Technologies, Concord, NH). This configuration allowed<br>
the plasma-sprayed particles to be directed into a water bath for collection.<br>
Optical microscopy observation of the resulting plasma-processed particles showed<br>
a mixture of shapes, which were predominantly transparent/amorphous.<br><br>
The plasma-sprayed particles were crystallized at 1300X for I hour in an electrically heated furnace (obtained from CM Furnaces, Bloomfieid, NJ under the trade designation "Rapid Temp Furnace")- The crystalline phases were determined by powder XRD analysis as described in Example 1. The resulting crystalline material included LaAIO;, &amp;O2 (cubic, tetragonal), LaAi,|Oia, and transitional Al203 phases.<br>
