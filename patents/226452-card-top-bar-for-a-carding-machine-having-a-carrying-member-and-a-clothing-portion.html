				<td>Card top bar for a carding machine, having a carrying<br>
member and a clothing portion<br>
The invention relates to a card top bar for a carding<br>
machine, having a carrying member and a releasable clothing<br>
portion, in which card top bar there are provided two end<br>
head-pieces (card top heads), each of which slides on a<br>
slideway, the end head-pieces comprising at least one<br>
sliding region, which is in contact with the slideway, and<br>
at least one fixing region, which is in engagement with the<br>
card top bar and which at the same time holds the sliding<br>
region.<br>
In a known card top bar, the end head-pieces (card top<br>
heads) are associated with the carrying member.<br>
The problem of the invention is to improve the known<br>
card top bar still further.<br>
The invention provides a card top bar for a carding<br>
machine, having a carrying member and a releasable clothing<br>
portion, in which card top bar there are provided two end<br>
head-pieces (card top heads), each of which slides on a<br>
slideway, the end head-pieces comprising at least one<br>
sliding region, which is in contact with the slideway, and<br>
at least one fixing region, which is in engagement with the<br>
card top bar and which at the same time holds the sliding<br>
region, characterised in that the card top heads and a<br><br>
carrier for the clothing are in engagement with one another<br>
and form a structural unit.<br>
The fact that the card top heads are in engagement with<br>
the carrier for the clothing makes it possible for the<br>
clothing portion, including the card top heads, to be<br>
manufactured as a separate component. In the process, it is<br>
made possible for a constant setting to be obtained for the<br>
important spacing between the sliding surface of the card<br>
top heads and the free ends (tips) of the clothing.<br>
Manufacturing tolerances in the carrying member, which is<br>
made, for example, from extruded aluminium, can no longer<br>
have an adverse effect on that spacing. A further advantage<br>
is that, when the clothing has become worn, the complete<br>
clothing portion (clothing strip, holding device and card<br>
top heads) can be removed and thrown away. It is especially<br>
advantageous that replacement of the clothing portion is<br>
carried out by simple means in the spinning room, it being<br>
possible for the carrying members to be re-used without<br>
modification. Precise setting of the card top heads<br>
relative to the clothing tips and, accordingly, of the<br>
important spacing between the clothing tips and the<br>
cylinder clothing (carding nip) is made possible by means<br>
of the measures according to the invention.<br>
The carrier may be of one-piece construction. The<br>
carrier may instead consist of a carrying element for the<br><br>
clothing and a compensating layer which may be connected to<br>
one another. The compensating layer may be arranged<br>
between the carrier and the carrying member. The card top<br>
heads may be in engagement, preferably non-releasably, with<br>
the carrier, for example with a compensating layer thereof,<br>
for example, directly or by way of an auxiliary carrier.<br>
The fixing region for the card top heads may be arranged<br>
in the compensating layer, for example with the sliding<br>
region extending outwardly beyond the carrier. Each card<br>
top head may have two elements, for example, pins of<br>
hardened steel or the like, the sliding surface of which<br>
may be ground, fine-ground and/or polished. The card top<br>
heads may be fixed in the respective end face of the<br>
carrier. Advantageously, the lower boundary of the card<br>
top heads is spaced from the free clothing tips. The<br>
carrying member and the clothing portion may form at least<br>
two composite components. The clothing portion<br>
advantageously comprises the carrier, the clothing and the<br>
card top heads. The carrying member and the clothing<br>
portion are advantageously connected to one another by<br>
releasable fixing means, for example, clips, clamps or the<br>
like. Fixing means, for example, resilient snap-fit<br>
elements, may be attached to the carrying member or to the<br>
clothing portion.<br><br>
The card top heads maybe connected to the carrier by<br>
adhesive action or the like. Advantageously, at least one<br>
continuous rod or the like, advantageously of a wear-<br>
resistant material, is provided, which extends over the<br>
width of the card top bar. The rod or the like may be<br>
accommodated within the carrier. The ends of the rod or<br>
the like may extend out beyond the carrier on both sides,<br>
in the form of card top heads.<br>
Where a compensating layer is present, that may be of<br>
plastics material or the like, for example of a synthetic<br>
resin such as epoxy resin, or of polyester or the like.<br>
The plastics material, synthetic resin or the like may be<br>
curable, and/or may be pourable. It may be, for example,<br>
an adhesive. The plastics material, synthetic resin or the<br>
like advantageously adheres more strongly to the clothing<br>
carrier than at the bottom surface of the carrying member.<br>
The compensating layer may be a rigid foam.<br>
Advantageously, an adhesive layer may be provided between<br>
the compensating layer and the bottom surface of the card<br>
top bar. A compensating step may be provided in the bottom<br>
surface of the carrying member.<br>
The card top bar and the card top clothing are<br>
associated with the same reference plane. The reference<br>
plane may be a flat counterpart surface for the tip of the<br>
card top clothing, for example a plate or the like. The<br><br>
card top carrying member may be an extruded member of a<br>
light metal, for example aluminium, which is advantageously<br>
hollow and may be cut to length, for example by sawing.<br>
Advantageously, the cut-to-length carrying member can be<br>
straightened. Two end head-pieces (card top heads) may be<br>
associated with the carrier. Advantageously, a carrying<br>
element for the card top clothing, for example of textile<br>
material, and a compensating layer are arranged at a recess<br>
in the bottom surface of the carrying member.<br>
Advantageously, a spacing between the sliding surfaces at<br>
the card top heads on the outer surface of the slideway and<br>
the envelope curve of the card top clothing tips is even.<br>
The card top heads may lie on a reference plane, for<br>
example a flat metal member or the like. The reference<br>
plane may be a magnetic plate. The plate and the reference<br>
plane may be attached to a common holding element. The<br>
reference plane and a further reference plane coinciding<br>
with the clothing tips may be orientated parallel to one<br>
another. The spacing between the reference planes may be<br>
adjustable.<br>
For manufacture, the clothing tips are set down on the<br>
further reference plane and the card top heads are set down<br>
on the reference plane, and an intermediate layer is<br>
applied between the carrying member and the clothing strip.<br>
The intermediate layer may be applied by melting, for<br><br>
example, after warming or otherwise heating. The underside<br>
of the carrying member may be structured, for example<br>
having recesses, protrusion, holes or the like. The<br>
carrier may have lateral recesses, grooves or the like for<br>
engagement of the fixing elements. Fixing elements may be<br>
present on the carrying members for engagement with the<br>
bottom surface of the carrier. The carrying member may<br>
have lateral shoulders, recesses or the like for engagement<br>
of fixing elements present on the carrier. For fixing the<br>
clothing portion, fixing means for example resilient snap-<br>
in elements may be attached to the carrier.<br>
The invention will be described hereinafter in greater<br>

cylinder 4, doffer 5, stripper roller 6, nip rollers 7, 8,<br>
web-collecting element 9, web funnel 10, draw-off<br>
rollers 11, 12, revolving card top 13 having clothed card<br>
top bars 14, can 15 and can coiler 16. Curved arrows<br>
indicate the directions of rotation of the rollers.<br><br>
Reference letter A denotes the work direction. Stationary-<br>
carding elements 33 and 34 are arranged opposite the<br>
cylinder clothing 4a.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 2, on each side of the carding<br>
machine, a flexible bend 17 having several adjustment<br>
screws is fixed laterally to the machine frame. The<br>
flexible bend 17 has a convex outer surface 17a and an<br>
underside 17b. On top of the flexible bend 17 there is a<br>
slideway 20, for example made of low-friction plastics<br>
material, which has a convex outer surface 20a and a<br>
concave inner surface 2 0b. The concave inner surface 2 0b<br>
rests on top of the convex outer surface 17a and is able to<br>
slide thereon in the direction of arrows B, C. Each card<br>
top bar, which may be constructed, for example, in<br>
accordance with EP 0 567 747 A1, consists of a rear<br>
part 14a and a carrying member 14b. The carrying member 14b<br>
has a bottom surface 14c, two lateral surfaces 14d, 14e and<br>
two upper surfaces 14f, 14g (see Fig. 3a). Each card top<br>
bar 14 has, at each of its two ends, a card top head 14',<br>
14' (cf. Fig. 5), each of which comprises two steel pins<br>
141, 142 and 143, 144, respectively, a portion of which in<br>
the axial direction is fixed in a compensating layer 24.<br>
Those portions of the steel pins 141, 142 (see Fig. 9) that<br>
extend out beyond the end faces of the carrying member 14b<br>
slide on the convex outer surface 20a of the slideway 20 in-<br><br>
the direction of the arrow D. The clothing strip 18 is<br>
attached to the underside of the carrying member 14b.<br>
Reference numeral 21 denotes the circle of tips of the card<br>
top clothings 19. The cylinder 4 has on its circumference a<br>
cylinder clothing 4a, for example a sawtooth clothing.<br>
Reference numeral 22 denotes the circle of the tips of the<br>
cylinder clothing 4a. The spacing between the circle of<br>
tips 21 and the circle of tips 22 is denoted by reference<br>
letter a and is, for example, 3/1000". The spacing between<br>
the convex outer surface 20a and the circle of tips 22 is<br>
denoted by reference letter b. The radius of the convex<br>
outer surface 20a is denoted by reference letter rx and the<br>
radius of the circle of tips 22 is denoted by reference<br>
letter r2. The radii r1 and r2 intersect at the centre<br>
point M of the cylinder 4.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 3a, the card top bar 14, which<br>
is extruded from aluminium, is composed of the rear<br>
part 14a and the carrying member 14b. The carrier 26<br>
according to Fig. 3b, which is extruded from aluminium, is<br>
composed of a holding element 26a and two fixing<br>
elements 26b and 26c. The free end regions 26b1 and 26c2 of<br>
the holding elements 26b and 26c are bent at right angles<br>
in different directions. They may, in each case, also be<br>
bent at an acute angle. The carrier 26 is made of one piece<br>
from one material. The fixing elements 26b and 26c may also-<br><br>
be attached to the holding element 26a, for example by<br>
laser welding. The fixing elements 26b, 26c and the holding<br>
element 26a may also be made from different materials. The<br>
regions 26a2 and 26a3 are used for additional holding of<br>
the carrying element 23 for the clothing strip 18 (see<br>
Fig. 3c). In accordance with Fig. 3c, the clothing strip 18<br>
consists of clothing tips 19 (small wire hooks) and a<br>
carrying element 23 made from a textile material. Reference<br>
letter f denotes the thickness of the carrying element 23.<br>
At one of their ends, the small wire hooks 19 are fixed in<br>
the carrying element 23, through the surface 23'. At the<br>
other end, the small wire hooks 19, that is to say the<br>
clothing tips, are free.<br>
Fig. 3d shows the card top bar 14 according to<br>
Figures 3a to 3c in the assembled state. The clothing<br>
strip 18 is fixed to one face 262 (the inner face) of the<br>
carrier 26. The other face 26i (the outer face) of the<br>
carrier 26 lies against the carrying member 14b. The end<br>
regions 26b2 and 26c2 of the fixing elements 26b and 26c,<br>
respectively, press against the upper surfaces 14f and 14g,<br>
respectively, of the carrying member 14b, as a result of<br>
which the carrier 26, together with the clothing strip 18,<br>
is fixed to the card top bar 14. Arranged between the inner<br>
face 262 of the carrier 26 and the carrying element 23 is<br>
an intermediate layer 24, for example made from cured<br><br>
synthetic resin or the like. The compensating layer 24 is<br>
able to compensate for disparate spacings between the card<br>
top bar 14, namely the bottom surface 14c, and the card top<br>
clothing 19, namely the envelope contour of the free tips.<br>
The fixing region for the steel pins 14l, 142 forming the<br>
card top head 14' is arranged in the compensating layer 24<br>
(see Fig. 6). The sliding region of the steel pins 141, 142<br>
extends freely outwards, beyond the end face of the<br>
compensating layer 24 (see Figs. 5 and 6). In that manner,<br>
the card top heads 14', 14' and the holding device -<br>
which, in accordance with Fig. 3d, is composed of the<br>
holding element 26 and the compensating layer 24 - for the<br>
clothing strip 18 are in engagement with one another and<br>
together form a structural unit. The structural unit<br>
consisting of holding element 26, compensating layer 24,<br>
clothing strip 18 and card top heads 141, 142 is<br>
prefabricated separately. A further advantage is that the<br>
structural unit can be mounted on the carrying member 14b,<br>
and removed from the carrying member 14b, by simple means<br>
both in the manufacturing factory and at the user's<br>
premises, that is to say in the spinning room itself. The<br>
structural unit can be supplied to the user in the form of<br>
a prefabricated replacement part.<br>
As Fig. 5 shows, arranged in a fixed position on a flat<br>
plate 25, between the card top pins 141, 142 and the<br><br>
plate 25, is a parallelepipedal supporting element 27a<br>
having parallel and flat surfaces and, between the card top<br>
pins 143, 144 and the plate 25, a further parallelepipedal<br>
supporting element 27b of the same height h. Using this<br>
apparatus and further lateral fillet elements (not shown)<br>
or the like (for example, displaceable boundary surfaces<br>
for the compensating layer 24 and/or the carrying<br>
element 23), it is possible to position the clothing<br>
tips 19 of the clothing strip 18 on the plate 25 and the<br>
pins 141, 142, 143, 144 on the supporting elements 27a, 27b.<br>
The compensating layer 24 is then introduced between the<br>
carrier 26 and the carrying element 23. That may be<br>
accomplished by, for example, pouring it in, injecting it,<br>
spreading it in, laying it in or the like. The compensating<br>
layer 24, for example of paste-like consistency, becomes<br>
distributed in the intermediate space, filling it in<br>
compensating manner.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 6, there is provided a static<br>
carrier element 14*, which can, for example, in accordance<br>
with Fig. 3a, be constructed in the form of a T-carrier or<br>
the like. The receiving portion for the card top pins 142<br>
may consist of, for example, a poured compound/adhesive,<br>
construction foam or the like. The height h always has the<br>
same dimension in the case of all card top bars, thereby<br>
eliminating dimensional tolerance. The fixing region of the-<br><br>
card top pin 142 is arranged in the compensating layer 24,<br>
and the free end thereof - the region sliding on the<br>
slideway 20a of the sliding bend 20 (see Fig. 2) - is<br>
located outside the compensating layer 24.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 7, separate spring clips 29a,<br>
2 9b are provided, by means of which the structural unit<br>
composed of compensating layer 24, clothing strip 18<br>
(consisting of clothing 19 and carrier 23) and card top<br>
pins 14i, 142 (143 and 144 are not shown) is releasably<br>
fixed to the carrying member 14b of the card top bar 14.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an arrangement wherein resilient clips 14h,<br>
14i are integrally formed on the carrying member 14b, for<br>
example during extrusion. As a result, the clips 14h, 14i<br>
are integrated into the card top bar 14. The compensating<br>
layer 24 has longitudinal grooves 30a, 30b on its sides,<br>
extending in the width-wise direction, in which the bent-<br>
over free ends of the resilient clips 14h, 14i releasably<br>
engage.<br>
Fig. 9 shows an arrangement, wherein resilient clips<br>
26d, 26e are integrally formed on the carrier 26, for<br>
example during extrusion. As a result, the clips 26d, 26e<br>
are integrated into the carrier 26. The clips have, on<br>
their free ends, engagement portions, which are in<br>
releasable engagement with corresponding engagement<br>
surfaces on the carrying member 14b. The parts in.<br><br>
engagement with one another may be bent over, for example<br>
at an acute or obtuse angle.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 10, the compensating layer 24 is<br>
enclosed by an approximately U-shaped tension bar 31 made<br>
from metal, above which the rear part 14a of the card top<br>
bar 14 is formed from rigid foam or the like. Provided at<br>
the top of the rear part 14a is an approximately U-shaped<br>
compression bar 32 made from metal. The compression bar 32<br>
and tension bar 31 equalise forces and stabilise the rear<br>
part 14a. The statically supporting part is also integrated<br>
into the wearing component. A sandwich construction makes<br>
that technically possible. This solution precludes the need<br>
for on-site assembly.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention substantially<br>
reduces the flatness tolerance and dimensional tolerance,<br>
measured over the clothing surface, within a card top set<br>
consisting of several card top bars 14. A further important<br>
advantage is that, when clothings are replaced at the<br>
customer's premises, the installation work is reduced. As a<br>
result of the invention, the interface between pins (and<br>
clothing) is shifted. The pins are an integral part of the<br>
wearing portion, namely the clothing. As especially Figures<br>
3d, 5, 6 and 7 to 10 show, the clothing 19, material 23,<br>
tolerance-compensating layer 24 and card top pins 141, 142<br>
form one component. It is accordingly possible for<br><br>
dimension h always to be kept the same and for the customer<br>
to be provided with a component in which precision is<br>
already in-built.<br>
Figures 7 to 10 show, by way of example, secure and<br>
simple mounting of this unit (component) on the static<br>
carrier.<br><br>
