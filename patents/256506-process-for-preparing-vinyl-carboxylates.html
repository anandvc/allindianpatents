Process for preparing vinyl carboxylates<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing vinyl carboxylates by reacting a carboxylic acid with an alkynes.<br>
The addition of carboxylic acids to alkynes to prepare the corresponding vinyl carboxylates has been known for some time. Suitable catalysts used are especially zinc salts, such as the zinc salt of the carboxylic acid taking part in the reaction; see, for example, US 2,066,075, US 3,455,998 and US 3,607,915.<br>
Since the zinc salts have only low selectivity and stability, attempts have been made to use other catalysts. For instance, US 5,430,179 describes the use of ruthenium complexes soluble in the reaction medium with a phosphates lagans. EP 512 656 A describes a process for preparing vinyl derivatives of Bromated acids, such as carboxylic acids, by reacting the Bronte acid with an acetylenically unsaturated compound in the presence of a ruthenium catalyst which is applied to an inter porous support. J. Org. Chem. 2004, 69, 5782-5784 describes the reaction of terminal alkynes with acetic acid or benzoic acid using Re(C0)5Br as the catalyst. It has been found that the anti-Markovnikov adduct is obtained with high selectivity especially in n-heptaneâ€™s and toluene as solvents. Organometallics 2000, 19, 170-183 describes the intramolecular hydroamination of aminoalkyne compounds using [Re(CO)5(H20)]BF4 as a catalyst. However, only a low yield is obtained.<br>
It is common to the prior art process that the yield of vinyl esters is not satisfactory.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing vinyl carboxylates which proceeds with high yield.<br>
Moreover, the process shall be performable at temperatures at which even the thermally labile carboxylic acids and vinyl carboxylates do not decompose.<br>
Finally, the process shall be performable with small amounts of catalyst in order to restrict the costs for the catalyst.<br>
It has now been found that, surprisingly, this object is achieved when the catalyst used is a carbonyl complex, a halide or oxide of rhenium, of manganese, of tungsten, of molybdenum, of chromium, of iron or rhenium metal.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a process for preparing vinyl carboxylates of the formula 1:<br><br>

The catalyst used comprises the carbonyl complexes, oxides or halides of rhenium, of manganese, of tungsten, of molybdenum, of chromium and of iron. Carbonyl complexes are understood here to mean compounds which have at least one carbonyl group as a ligand. The remaining coordination sites can be occupied by other ligands as listed by way of example in the paragraph below. Oxides and halides are also understood to mean compounds in which one or more coordination sites and/or<br><br>
valences are occupied by a CrCs-alkyl group, and also oxyhalides. Examples thereof are CHsReOa, ReOaCi, or ReOCU.<br>
The catalysts may be present in all oxidation states; in the case of carbonyl complexes, they are preferably present in the 0 or I oxidation state.

A particularly preferred catalyst is Re2(CO)io.<br>
The reaction can be effected in homogeneous or heterogeneous liquid phase. When a homogeneous liquid phase is desired, a catalyst is used which is soluble in the reaction medium under the given reaction conditions or goes into solution during the reaction. Such catalysts are in particular the carbonyl complexes of the metals which are useful here. Heterogeneous catalysts are the halides and oxides of these metals, and rhenium metal. The heterogeneous catalysts can be used directly, for example in powder form, or applied to a support. Suitable supports are carbon powder, zeolites, aluminum oxides silicon oxides, etc.<br>
In general, the catalyst is used in an amount of from 0.000005 to 1 mol%, preferably from 0.000005 to 0.5 mol%, more preferably from 0.00001 to 0.1 mol% and in particular from 0.00005 to 0.05 mol%, from 0.0001 to 0.05 mol%, from 0.0005 to 0.01 mol% or from 0.001 to 0.01 mol%, based in each case on equivalents of the compound<br><br>
of the formula II. The expression "equivalents" relates here to carboxyl groups of the formula II which can react with the compound of the formula III.<br>
Suitable starting compounds of the formula II are aliphatic monocarboxylic acids. Examples of such carboxylic acids are formic acid, acetic acid, halogenated carboxylic acids, such as chloroacetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, aminocarboxylic acids, such as alanine, lactic acid or butyric acid, hydroxycarboxylic acids, such as hydroxybutyric acid, valeric acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid, nonanoic acid, decanoic acid, 2-methylpropionic acid, 2-methylbutyric acid, 3-methylbutyric acid, 2-methylpentanolc acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, 2-propylheptanoic acid, tertiary carboxylic acids of the formula R^R^C(CH3)C00H in which RÂ® and R^ are each independently Ci-Ci2-alkyl, such as pivalic acid, 2,2-dimethylbutyric acid, 2,2-dimethylpentanoic acid, 2,2-dimethylhexanoic acid, 2,2-dimethylheptanoic acid, 2,2-dimethyloctanoic acid (Versatic acids 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), neononanoic acid, neodecanoic acid, neotridecanoic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, cyclohexanemono- and cyclohexanepolycarboxylic acids such as cyclohexane-carboxylic acid, cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexane-1,3-dicarbpxylic acid, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, cinnamic acid or phenylacetic acid.<br>
Suitable starting compounds of the formula II are also aliphatic polycarboxylic acids, especially dicarboxylic acids, and the derivatives of the polycarboxylic acids which have been partly esterified with a Ci-C4-alkanol and partly amidated with ammonia, a Ci-C4-monoalkylamine or a di-Ci-C4-alkylamine. Examples of aliphatic polycarboxylic acids are oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, agaricicacid, 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, glutamic acid, maleic acid and fumaric acid, particular preference being given to the use of adipic acid.<br>
Suitable starting compounds of the formula II are also bicyclic mono- and dicarboxylic acids such as <br><br><br>
Suitable starting compounds of tine formula II are also heterocyclic mono- and polycarboxylic acids and the derivatives of the polycarboxylic acids which have been partly esterified with a Ci-C4-alkanol and partly amidated with ammonia, a Ci-C4-mono-alkylamine or a di-Ci-C4-alkylamine. Examples thereof are 2-pyridinecarboxyiic acid, 3-pyridinecarboxylic acid or 4-pyridinecarboxylic acid, pyridinedicarboxylic acids such as 2,3- and 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, furan-2-carboxylic acid, furan-3-carboxylic acid, thiophene-2-carboxylic acid, thiophene-3-carboxylic acid or proline.<br>
Suitable starting compounds of the formula II are also aromatic monocarboxylic acids and polycarboxylic acids and the derivatives of the polycarboxylic acids which have been partly esterified with a Ci-C4-alkanol and partly amidated with ammonia, a Ci-C4-monoalkylamine or a di-Ci-C4-alkylamine. Examples of such carboxylic acids are<br><br>
benzoic acid, 2-, 3- or 4-methylbenzoic acid, salicylic acid, 2-, 3- or 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-dimethylaminobenzoic acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid or terephthalic acid, 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylic acid, 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylicacid, 1,3,5-benzenetri-carboxylic acid, 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid, 1,2,3,4-benzenetetracarboxylic acid, benzenepentacarboxylic acid and benzenehexacarboxylic acid, and tine derivatives of \he polycarboxylic acids which have been partly esterified with a Ci-C4-alkanol.<br>
The starting compounds of the formulae II and III are commercially available or irreparable by known processes. The above-described bicyclic carboxylic acids are obtainable by Diels-Alder reaction of cyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene or cycloheptadiene with acrylic acid, maleic acid or fumaric acid, and if appropriate hydrogenation to the saturated mono- and dicarboxylic acids.<br>
Suitable starting compounds of the formula III are, for example, acetylene, propyne, 1-butyne, 1-pentyne, 1-hexyne and phenylacetylene, particular preference being given to using acetylene.<br>
The quantitative ratio of compound of the formula 11 to compound of the formula 111 can be selected within a wide range. In general, though, an excess of compound of the formula III is used, especially an excess of from 0.1 to 20 mol%, based on the compound of the formula II.<br>
The reaction is generally carried out in a suitable inert solvent. If the compound of the formula II is liquid at the temperature employed, it is possible to dispense with a solvent. Suitable inert solvents are aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, decalin, paraffin oil, toluene, xylene, etc., ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or diphenyl ether, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane or chlorobenzene, esters such as ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate or butyrolactone, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dim ethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone or polyethylene glycols or mixtures thereof. The reaction can also be performed in a compound of the formula 1 as a solvent if it is liquid at the selected reaction temperature.<br>
The reaction temperature can be selected freely within a wide range. It is generally selected such that there is rapid conversion without starting compounds or the products decomposing. It is appropriately 
 <br>
The reaction is typically carried out under pressure, preference being given to establishing from 1 to 30 bar (absolute), preferably from 2 to 20 bar and in particular from 5 to 25 bar or from 10 to 20 bar. The pressure may, for example, be established with the compound of the formula III employed and/or an inert gas such as nitrogen. The reaction time is generally in the range from 0.5 to 72 hours, especially from 1 to 48 hours.<br>
If appropriate, it is also possible to add reaction-promoting additives such as zinc acetate, lithium salts, for example LiCI, Lewis acids such as BF3, etc., Lewis bases such as triethylamine, pyridine, 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene, etc., substances which react with the catalyst on CO and can thus create free coordination sites, for example trimethylamino N-oxide.<br>
The reaction can be carried out batchwise, continuously or in a semibatchwise process. The workup is effected in a customary manner, appropriately by distilling off the desired vinyl carboxylates. The catalyst remains in the bottoms and can be reused if appropriate. Appropriately, the reaction and the workup, especially the purifying distillation, can be carried out in the presence of a polymerization inhibitor. The polymerization inhibitors used may, for example, be hydroquinone, hydroquinone monomethyl ether, 2,5-di-t-butylhydroquinone, 2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol, nitroso compounds such as isoacryloyi nitrate, nitrosodiphenylamine, N-nitrosocyclohexyl-hydroxyamine, methylene blue, phenothiazine, tannic acid or diphenylamine. The polymerization inhibitors are used generally in amounts of from 1 to 10 000 ppm, especially of from 100 to 1000 ppm, based in each case on the overall mixture.<br>
The reaction proceeds selectively, i.e., even in the presence of other vinylatable groups in the compound of the formula II, such as OH or NH2, only the carboxyl groups are tinplated. If a compound of the formula II is used which, as well as the carboxyl group(s), also comprises another vinyl table group, the reaction temperature is appropriately selected within the range from 70 to 160Â°C and/or the reaction time within the range from 0.5 to 12 hours.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention relates to the reaction of the compounds of the formula II in which R^ is H, Ci-Ce-alkyI, Cs-Cz-cycloalkyl or phenyl, where the alkyl group may be substituted as specified above under b) and the phenyl group as specified above under c), and n is 1 with acetylene.<br>
A further preferred embodiment relates to the reaction of the compounds of the formula II in which R^ is CO2H and n is 1, or in which R^ is Ci-C2o-alkyl, especially Ci-C4-a!kyl, where R^ may be substituted as specified under b) above, and n is 2, with acetylene. Preference is given to carrying out this reaction at a temperature in the<br><br>
range from 70 to 220Â°C, preferably from 130Â°C to 220Â°C, in particular from 140 to 180Â°C or from 150 to IZCC. Catalyst is used especially in an amount of from 0.00001 to 0.1 mol%, especially from 0.0001 to 0.01 mol%, based on equivalents of dicarboxylic acid. The reaction of adipic acid with acetylene is particularly preferred.<br>

The catalyst is used preferably in an amount of from 0.00001 to 0.1 mol%, especially from 0.0001 to 0.01 mol%, based on equivalents of polycarboxylic acid.<br>
