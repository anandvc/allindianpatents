				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device for encoding a stream of databits of a<br>
binary source signal into a stream of databits of a binary channel signal satisfying a predeter-<br>
mined (d,k) constraint, wherein the bitstream of the source signal is divided into n-bit source<br>
words, which device comprises converting means adapted to convert said source words into<br>
corresponding m-bit channel words, the converting means being adapted to convert a block<br>
of p consecutive n-bit, source words into a corresponding block of p consecutive m-bit<br>
channel words, such that the conversion for each block of p consecutive n-bit source words is<br>
substantially parity preserving, where n, m and p are integers, m &gt; n ≥ 1, p ≥ 1, and<br>
where p can vary. The invention also relates to a recording device comprising the encoding<br>
device for recording the channel signal on a record carrier, to the record carrier itself, to an<br>
encoding method, and to a device for decoding a stream of data bits of a binary channel<br>
signal obtained by means of the encoding device, so as to obtain a stream of data bits of a<br>
binary source signal.<br>
An encoding device mentioned in the foregoing is known from<br>
USP 5,477,222 (PHN 14448). The document discloses a device for encoding a stream of<br>
data bits of a binary source signal into a stream of data bits of a binary channel signal<br>
satisfying a (1,8) runlength constraint. That means that, in the serial datastream of the<br>
channel signal at minimum one 'zero' and at maximum eight 'zeroes' are present between<br>
two consecutive 'ones' in the channel signal. It should be noted in this respect that normally<br>
an additional precoding, such as a well known IT precoding is applied to the (1,8)<br>
constrained sequence, resulting in a runlength limited sequence with minimum runlength 2<br>
and maximum runlength 9.<br>
The known conversion is parity preserving. 'Parity preserving' means that<br>
the parity of the n-bit source words to be converted equal the parity (after modulo-2 addition)<br>
of the corresponding m-bit channel words in which they arc converted. As a result, the n-to-<br>
m conversion device as claimed does not influence the polarity of the signal.<br>
As the conversion is parity preserving, an efficient DC control can be<br><br>
applied, such as by inserting Dc control bits in the datastream of the source words.<br>
The invention has for its object to provide for an appropriate sync word to<br>
be inserted into the serial datastream of the channel signal.<br>
The device in accordance with the invention is characterized in that the<br>
device comprises sync word generator means for generating a q-bit sync word also satisfying<br>
said (d,k) constraint, the said sync word starting with a '0' bit and ending with a '0' bit, the<br>
device further comprising merging means for merging said sync word in said stream of<br>
databits of the binary channel signal, and that q is an integer value larger than k.<br>
It is well known in the art to add sync words to a serial datastream of a<br>
channel signal. Reference is made in this respect to WO 96/31,880. The sync word proposed<br>
violates the prescribed k constraint. This has its disadvantages in that a relatively long sync<br>
word is required, that is more prone to error and results in a relatively large overhead.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a q-bit sync word is proposed, such<br>
that, after combining the sequence of channel words with the sync word, the signal obtained<br>
satisfies said (d,k) constraint. This has the advantage that a shorter sync word is required,<br>
resulting in a smaller overhead. Further, as the said sync word starts with a '0' bit and ends<br>
with a '0' bit, it can be merged between any m-bit channel word, eg. when taking 0 equal<br>
to 1.<br>
Preferably, the sync word starts with a '01' bitsequence and ends with a<br>
10' sequence. This provides for satisfying the k constraint.<br>
In an embodiment, in which the encoding device generates a channel<br>
signal satisfying the constraint d=l, preferably a 15-bit sync word is used, such as the sync<br>
word '010000000010010'. When k=8, this sync word satisfies the formula q=2k-l, and is<br>
very efficient, even when compared with eg other sync words that do not violate the d,k<br>
constraints of the signals they are merged in, such as disclosed in USP 4,501,000 (PHO<br>
80.007). It should however be noted that the sync word defined above could be equally well<br>
used in an encoding device supplying an output datastream satisfying another k-constraint,<br>
such as k = 7 or lower (so that the sync word does not satisfy the k constraint of the encoded<br>
signal), or k larger than 8.<br>
In another embodiment, a sync word is generated starting with a '011<br>
bitsequence and ending with a '100' bitsequence, such as the 16-bit sync word<br>
'0100000000100100'.<br><br>
In again another embodiment, a sync word is generated starting with in<br>
'01' bitsequence and ending with a '1000' bitsequence, such as the 17-bit sync word<br>
'01000000001001000'.<br>
In a further embodiment, a sync word is generated starting with a '01'<br>
bitsequence and ending with a '10000' bitsequence, such as the 18-bit sync word<br>
'010000000010010000'.<br>
For certain n-to-m conversions, the sync words ending with two or more<br>
'zeroes' may lead, after concatenation with a subsequent channel word and with an<br>
unmodified encoding, to a violation of the k-constraint. This can be overcome by changing<br>
the conversion, so that the k-constraint is satisfied, with a local violation of the parity<br>
preserving property.<br>
The encoding device in accordance with the invention can be used in<br>
combination with a bit-adder unit in which one bit is added to codewords of a certain length<br>
of the source signal. The signal obtained can be applied to the encoding device of the present<br>
invent on. The channel signal of the encoding device is applied to a 1T-precoder. The<br>
purpose of the bit-adder unit is to add a '0'- or a '1'-bit to the consecutive code words<br>
included in the input signal of the converter, so as to obtain a precoder output signal which is<br>
DC free, or includes a tracking pilot signal having a certain frequency. The precoder output<br>
signal is recorded on a record carrier. The adding of a '0'-bit in the input signal of the<br>
converter results in the polarity of the output signal of the 1T precoder remaining the same.<br>
The adding of a '1'-bit results in a polarity inversion in the output signal of the 1T precoder.<br>
The converter therefore influences the output signal of the 1T precoder such that the running<br>
digital sum value of the output signal of the 1T precoder can be controlled so as to have a<br>
desired pattern as a function of time.<br>
The invention will be further described in the following figure description in the accompanying drawing<br>
in which<br>
figure 1 shows an embodiment of the device in accordance with the<br>
invention,<br>

figure 3b a third, and<br>

an arrangement for inserting one bit on equidistant positions in the serial source signal,<br>

figure 7 an elaborated version of the converter unit of the decoding device<br>
of figure 6.<br>
Figure 1 shows a device for encoding a stream of databits of a binary<br>
source signal into a stream of databits of a binary channel signal satisfying a predetermined<br>
(d,k) constraint. The device has an input terminal 3 for receiving the binary source signal<br>
and an output terminal 5 for supplying the channel signal that satisfies the (d,k) constraint.<br>
The device comprises an n-to-m bit converter 7 having an input 1 coupled to the input<br>
terminal 3 and an output 8 coupled to a first terminal a of a controllable switch 19. The<br>
converter 7 is adapted to divide the input bitstream into n-bit source words and converts said<br>
source words into corresponding m-bit channel words. More precisely, the converter 7<br>
converts a block of p consecutive n-bit source words into a corresponding block of p<br>
consecutive m-bit channel words, such that the conversion for each block of p consecutive n-<br>
bit source words is parity preserving, n, m and p are integers, m &gt; n ≥ 1, p ≥ 1, and p<br>
can vary, as will become clear later. The device further comprises a sync word generator 9<br>
for generating a q-bit sync word also satisfying said (d,k) constraint, q is an integer value<br>
larger than k. An output 11 of the sync word generator 9 is coupled to a terminal b of the<br>
controllable switch 19. A terminal c of the switch 19 is coupied to the output terminal 5 of<br>
the device. The switch can be controlled in one of two switch positions, a-c and b-c, under<br>
the influence of a switching control signal on the line 13, generated by a central processing<br>
unit 17.<br>
In the switch position a-c, the device converts the source signal into the<br>
channel signal and in the position b-c, a sync word can be inserted into the channel signal.<br>
The insertion of a sync word can repeatedly take place at 'equidistant' positions in the<br>
channel signal, where a sync word is merged into the channel signal, each time between two<br>
m-bit successive channel words. It will be clear that the processing unit 17 also controls the<br>
converter 7, so as to halt the conversion at the time instant that a sync word is merged into<br>
the serial datastream of the channel signal.<br>
At this moment, it can be said that the sync word starts with a '0' bit ind<br>
ending with a '0' bit. First, the functioning of the converter 7 will be further explained.<br><br>
The encoding device of figure 1 could further be provided with a writing<br>
unit 21 for writing the channel signal generated by the encoding device in a track on a record<br>
carrier 23. The record carrier 23 can be a magnetic or an optical record carrier. In the<br>
example of a magnetic record carrier 23, the writing unit 21 is provided with at least one<br>
magnetic head 25 for writing the channel signal in said track on the record carrier 23. In the<br>
example of an optical record carrier 23', the writing unit 21 is provided with a light source,<br>
such as a laser, for writing the information in the record carrier 23'.<br>
Figure 2 shows a first elaborated version of the converter 7. The terminal<br>
1 of the converter is coupled to an input of a shift register 2 having two cells X1 and X2 so<br>
as to receive two consecutive source bits of the source signal S. The shift register 2 functions<br>
as a serial-parallel converter, so as to obtain consecutive 2-bit source words SW. The outputs<br>
of the two cells are coupled to two inputs i1, i2 of a logic circuit LC, for supplying the logic<br>
values (x1, x2) of the source bits present in the cells.<br>
The converter 7 further includes a second shift register 4 having three<br>
cells Y1, Y2 and Y3. Outputs o1, o2 and o3 of the logic circuit LC are coupled to inputs of<br>
the three cells Y1, Y2 and Y3 respectively of the shift register 4, for supplying the logic<br>
values (y1, y2, y3) of the channel words. An output 6 of the shift register 4 is coupled to an<br>
output terminal 8. The shift register 4 functions as a parallel-serial converter, so as to<br>
convert the 3-bit channel words CW supplied by the logic circuit LC into a serial stream of<br>
databits of a binary converted signal C1.<br>
The logic circuit LC is adapted to convert consecutive 2-bit source words<br>
SW into 3-bit channel words, such that the conversion for each 2-bit source word is party<br>
preserving. That means that the number of 'ones' in the source word to be converted equals<br>
the number of 'ones' in the corresponding channel word, a modulo-2 addition on the 'ones'<br>
in the channel word being carried out. Or, otherwise said: if the number of 'ones' in the<br>
source word is even, the number of 'ones' in the channel word will be even. And if the<br>
number of 'ones' in the source word is odd, the number of 'ones' in the channel word will<br>
be odd.<br>
As an example, the converting means LC is adapted to convert the 2-bit<br>
source words SW into 3-bit channel words CW in accordance with the following table:<br><br><br>
It should be noted here, that the first bit in the source word is appried first<br>
to the shift register 2 and that the first bit in the channel word is supplied first from the<br>
output 6 of the shift register 4.<br>
The bitstream of the channel words is in NRZI (non-return to zero-<br>
inverse) notation, which means that a 'one' results in a transition in the write current for<br>
recording the channel signal on a magnetic record carrier.<br>
The converter of figure 2 can be used to generate a converted signal C1 in<br>
the form of a (d,k) sequence satisfying the d = 1 constraint. That means that at least one<br>
'zero' is present between two subsequent 'ones' in the serial datastream of the converted<br>
signal C1. That is, that a concatenation of two or more 'ones' in the convened signal C1, and<br>
thus in the channel signal C, is prohibited.<br>
It might occur that the unmodified conversion, such as by means of the<br>
device of figure 1, of combinations of two subsequent 2-bit source words might violate the<br>
d = l constraint. Those combinations are the combinations; '00 00', which by unmodified<br>
conversion would lead to the two 3-bit channel words '101 101'; '00 01', which by<br>
unmodified conversion would lead to the two 3-bit channel words '101 100'; '10 00', which<br>
by unmodified conversion would lead to the two 3-bit channel words '001 101' and '10 01',<br>
which by unmodified conversion would lead to the two 3-bit channel words '001 100'.<br>
The occurrence of such combinations should be detected so that a<br>
modified encoding of blocks of two 2-bit source words into blocks of two 3-bit channel<br>
words can take place. A modified embodiment of a converter of figure 2 which is, in<br>
addition to the 'normal' encoding of 2-bit source words into 3-bit channel words, capable of<br>
detecting the above identified combinations, and is capable of realizing a modified encoding,<br>
such that the d = l constraint in the converted signal C,, and thus in the channel signal C, is<br>
still satisfied, is shown in figure 3a.<br>
The converter of figure 3a includes a shift register having four cells X, to<br><br>
X4 so as to receive four conse6utive bits (x1,X2,x3,x4) of the serial bitstream of the source<br>
signal S. Outputs of the four cells are coupled to corresponding inputs i1 to i4 respectively of<br>
the logic circuit LC as well as to corresponding inputs of a detector unit D1. The detector<br>
unit D1 is adapted to detect the position in the serial bitstream of the source signal where<br>
unmodified encoding of single source words in the bitstream into corresponding single<br>
channel words would lead to a violation of the d= 1 constraint in the converted signal C1,<br>
and are adapted to supply a control signal at its output 10 in response to such detection.<br>
The output 10 of the detector unit Dl is coupled to a control signal input<br>
12 of the logic circuit LC'. The logic circuit LC' has six outputs o1 to o6, which are coupled<br>
to inputs of cells Y1 to Y6 respectively of second shift register 4'.<br>
In the absence of a control signal at the control signal input 12, the logic<br>
circuit LC converts the first 2-bit source word 'x1 x2' into the three bit channel wort 'y y2<br>
y3' in conformity with table I given above. As soon as the detector circuit Dl detects a<br>
combination of tv/o 2-bit source words (x1 x2, x3, x4) which equals one of the combinations<br>
given above, the logic circuit LC converts the combination in accordance with the modified<br>
coding as given in the following table:<br><br>
As can be seen from the table, unmodified conversion of the single two 2-<br>
bit source words leads to a violation of the d = l constraint, as two 'ones' occur at the<br>
boundary between, the two channel words obtained. The logic circuit LC is therefore adapted<br>
to convert in a modified coding mode, the blocks of two 2-bit source words given in the left<br>
column of the above table into the blocks of two" 3-bit channel words as given in the right<br>
column in the above table II. As can be seen, no violation of the d = l constraint occurs<br>
anymore. Moreover, the modified encoding in the same way is parity preserving. This means<br>
in the present situation that, if the number of 'ones' in the blocks of two 2-bit source words<br>
is odd (even), the number of 'ones' in the block of two 3-bit channel words obtained is odd<br><br>
(even). Further, one of the two 2-bit source words, which is in the above table the second<br>
one, is encoded into a 3-bit channel word which is unequal to one of the four channel words<br>
of table I. The reason for this is that on the receiver side, a detection of this 3-bit channel<br>
word not belonging to the set of four 3-bit channel words of the table I is possible, so that a<br>
corresponding decoding, which is the inverse of the encoding as defined with reference to<br>
table II, can be realized.<br>
The block of two 3-bit channel words obtained by means of the encoding<br>
in conformity with table II, is supplied by the logic circuit LC' to its outputs o1 to o6, which<br>
channel words are supplied to the six cells Y1 toY6 of the shift register 4'. It is clear from<br>
the embodiment described that the situations where a modified encoding is needed is detected<br>
by means of the detector D1 using the source words.<br>
A different construction of the converter for carrying out the modified<br>
conversion described with reference to the table II is shown in figure 3b. In this case,<br>
detection of the situations where a modified coding should be carried out is decided using the<br>
converted channel words. The device of figure 3b includes a detector D1' having 6 inputs for<br>
receiving two subsequent 3-bit channel words obtained by means of the unmodified encoding.<br>
The detector D1' detects whether the two subsequent 3-bit channel words obtained using the<br>
unmodified coding equal one of the four 6-bit sequences given in the middle column under<br>
'unmodified coding' of table II. If so, the detector D1' issues a switching signal at its output<br>
10 and an address signal AD at its output 10'. The switching signal is applied to a switching<br>
signal input 45 of the shift register 4". The address signal AD is applied to an address signal<br>
input 46 of a ROM 47. The detector D1' generates one of four possible address signals AD1<br>
to AD4, in response to the detection of a corresponding one of the four 6-bit sequences in<br>
the middle column of table II. As an example, the address signal AD1 is generated wnen ilie<br>
detector D1' detects the sequence '101101' and generates the address signal AD4 upon<br>
detection of the 6-bit sequence '001100'. The ROM 47 has the 6-bit sequences shown in the<br>
right column of table II stored. Upon the receipt of the address signal AD1, the ROM<br>
supplies the 6-bit sequence '100 010' at its outputs o1 to o6, and upon the receipt of the<br>
address signal AD2, the ROM supplies the 6-bit sequence '101 010' at its outputs. Upon the<br>
receipt of the address signal AD3, the ROM supplies the 6-bit sequence '000 010' at its out-<br>
puts, and upon the receipt of (he address signal AD4, the ROM supplies the 6-bit sequence<br>
'001 010' at its outputs. Each memory location of the shift register 4" has now two inputs,<br>
one of them being coupled with a corresponding output of the logic circuit LC, the other<br>
being coupled to a corresponding output of the ROM 47.<br><br>
In the normal situation, when the d=l constraint is not violated,<br>
unmodified conversion is carried out, and the switching signal is absent so that the shift<br>
register accepts the bits supplied by the logic circuit LC via the upper inputs of the shift<br>
register 4". If the d = l constraint is violated, the switching signal applied to the switching<br>
signal input 45 results in the shift register to accept the 6-bit sequence, which is the modified<br>
sequence, applied by the ROM to the lower inputs of the shift register 4".<br>
The k-constraint in a (d,k) sequence means that a concatenation of at most<br>
k 'zeroes' between two subsequent 'ones' in the channel signal are allowed.<br>
It might occur that the unmodified conversion of three subsequent 2-bit<br>
source words might violate the k-constraint.<br>
As an example: the sequence of source words '11 11 11' would by<br>
unmodified conversion lead to the three 3-bit channel words '000 000 000'. If a (d,k)<br>
sequence should be obtained where k equals 6, 7 or 8, such combination of three 3-bit<br>
channel words should not occur.<br>
Another example is the sequence of source words '11 11 10' which by<br>
unmodified conversion would lead to the three 3-bit channel words '000 000 001'. This<br>
combination of three 3-bit channel words does not satisfy a k = 6 or k = 7 constraint.<br>
Moreover, this combination of three 3-bit channel words can follow a previous channel word<br>
that ends with a '0', so that it might lead to a violation of a k = 8 constraint. Further, the<br>
combination ends with a '1', so that it might lead to a violation of the d = 1 constraint, if the<br>
combination is followed by a 3-bit channel word that starts with a ' 1'. An equivalent<br>
reasoning is valid for the sequence of source words '01 11 11'.<br>
A further example is the sequence of source words '01 11 10' which by<br>
unmodified conversion would lead to the three 3-bit channel words '100 000 001'. This<br>
combination can, in the same way as given above, lead to a violation of the d = l constraint.<br>
The occurrence of such combinations should be detected so that a<br>
modified encoding can take place. An embodiment of a converter which is, in addition to the<br>
'normal' encoding of 2-bit source words into 3-bit channel words, capable of detectirg the<br>
above identified combinations, and is capable of realizing a modified encoding, is shown in<br>
figure 4.<br>
The converter of figure 4 includes a shift register 2" having six cells X1<br>
to X6 so as to receive six consecutive bits of the serial bitstream of the source signal S.<br>
Outputs of the six cells are coupled to corresponding inputs i1 to i6 respectively of the logic<br>
circuit LC" and to corresponding inputs of a detector unit D2. The detector unit D2 is<br><br>
adapted to detect the position in the serial bitstream of the source signal where unmodified<br>
encoding of the bitstream would lead to a violation of the k-constraint in the converted signal<br>
Cl, and thus in the channel signal C, and is adapted to supply a control signal at its output<br>
15	in response to such detection.<br>
The output 15 of the detector unit D2 is coupled to a control signal input<br>
16	of the logic circuit LC". The logic circuit LC" has nine outputs o1 to o9, which are<br>
coupled to inputs of cells Yl to Y9 respectively of second shift register 4".<br>
In the absence of a control signals at the control signal inputs 12 and 16,<br>
the logic circuit LC" converts a single 2-bit source word 'x1 x2' into a single 3-bit channel<br>
word 'y1 y2 y3' in conformity with table I given above. As soon as the detector circuit D1<br>
detects a block of two 2-bit source words 'x1 x2, x3 x4' which equals one of the<br>
combinations given in table II above, the logic circuit LC" converts the combination in<br>
accordance with the conversion rule as given in table 11, so as to obtain a block of two 3-bit<br>
channel words 'y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6'<br>
As soon as the detector D2 detects a block of three 2-bit source words 'X1<br>
x2 x3 x4, x5 x6' which equals one of the combinations given above, the logic circuit LC"<br>
converts the block in accordance with the modified coding as given in the following table, so<br>
as to obtain a block of three i-bit channel words:<br><br>
The logic circuit LC" is adapted to convert in a modified coding mode, the blocks of three<br>
2-bit source words given in the left column of the above table III into the blocks of three 3-<br>
bit channel words as given in the right column in the above table. By realizing the modified<br>
encoding as per table III, a channel signal has been obtained which satisfies the k=8<br>
constraint. Moreover, the modified encoding in the same way is parity preserving. Further,<br>
two of the three 2-bit source words, which is in the above table the second one and the third<br>
one, is encoded into a 3-bit channel word which is unequal to one of the four channel words<br><br>
of table I. The reason for this is that on the receiver side, a detection of these two<br>
consecutive 3-bit channel words not belonging to the set of four 3-bit channel words of the<br>
table I is possible, so ihat a corresponding decoding, which is the inverse of the encoding as<br>
defined with reference to table III, can be realized.<br>
The combination of three 3-bit channel words obtained by means of the<br>
encoding in conformity with table III, is supplied by the logic circuit LC" to its outputs o1 to<br>
o9, which channel words are supplied to the nine cells Y1 to Y9 of the shift register<br>
serial datastream of the converted signal C1 is supplied to the output terminal 8.<br>
It will be evident that, in the same way as described with reference to<br>
figure 3b, the detection of the violation of the k-constraint can be done on the converted<br>
signal level, instead of the source signal level.<br>
It has been said previously that other conversion rules for converting<br>
single 2-bit source words into single 3-bit channel words are possible. Those conversion rules<br>
are given in the following three tables.<br><br><br><br>
TABLE VI .<br>
It is evident that extensions of those conversion rules for encoding blocks<br>
of two or three 2-bit source words into blocks of two or three 3-bit channel words can be<br>
obtained using the teachings given above.<br>
It should be noted that, although converters have been described conver-<br>
ting 2-bit source words into 3-bit channel words, the invention is equally well applicable with<br>
converters converting (as an example) 3-bit source words into 4-bit channel words.<br>
For the embodiment of the 2-to-3 bit converter 7 realizing a converted<br>
signal satisfying a (1,8) runlength constraint, the sync word generator 9 preferably generates<br>
a q-bit sync word that begins with '01' and ends with '10'. More specifically, the generator<br>
9 generates a 15-bit sync word which equals '010000000010010'.<br>
The advantages of the use of this sync word are:<br>
-	the sync word satisfies the (1,8) runlength constraint, so that the use of the sync word does<br>
not lead to a increase of the k-constraint of the (1, 8) constrained parity preserving code.<br>
-	the sync word is a unique word in the sequence of the channel signal.<br>
-	as the sync word begins and ends with a '0' bit, it can always be merged between two 3-bit<br>
channel words.<br>
-	as the sync word is only 15 bits long, it implies a relatively low overhead.<br>
The sync word defined above could equally well be used in parity<br>
preserving encoders that generate a sequence of channel words satisfying a different k-<br>
constraint, such as k=7. In this situation, the sync word, as such, violates the k constraint of<br>
the generated channel signal.<br>
As has been said previously, the device in accordance with the invention<br>
can very suitably be used in an encoding arrangement where one bit is inserted after each<br>
group of a plurality of bits in the serial datastream of the source signal, in order to realize a<br>
polarity conversion, or not. Such an encoding arrangement is schematically shown in figure<br><br>
5, where the encoder 40 is followed by the encoding device 41 in accordance with the<br>
present invention, and a IT-precoder 42, well known in the art. The output signal of the 1T-<br>
precoder 42 is applied to a control signal generator 43, which generates the control signal for<br>
the converter 40, so as to control whether a '0' or a '1' is inserted in the serial datastream<br>
applied to the device 41. The encoding device 41 can be inserted between the converter 40<br>
and the IT-precoder 42 without any modification.<br>
By means of the arrangement shown in figure 5 it is possible to embed a<br>
tracking tone of a certain frequency in the serial datastream, or keep the DC content of the<br>
datastream to zero. Further, when the encoding device 41 is adapted to generate a (d,k)<br>
sequence as explained above, it causes the output signal of the arrangement of figure 4 to be<br>
a (d,k) RLL output signal. Embodiments of the convener 40 are given in Bell System<br>
Technical Journal, Vol 53, No. 6, pp. 1103-1106.<br>
Figure 6 shows a decoding device for decoding the serial datastream<br>
obtained by the encoding device, so as to obtain a binary source signal. The decoding device<br>
has an input terminal 60 for receiving the channel signal, which input terminal 60 is coupled<br>
to an input 50 of an m-to-n bit converter 62. An output 55 of the converter 62 is coupled to<br>
an output terminal 64 of the decoding device. The device further comprises a sync detector<br>
unit 66, having an input 68 coupled to the input terminal 60 and an output 70 which is<br>
coupled to a disable input 72 of the converter 62.<br>
The decoder receives the channel signal with the m-bit channel words and<br>
the sync words via its input terminal 60. In the example of m=3 and n=2, 3,-bits channel<br>
words are converted in the converter 62 into 2-bits source words and supplied to the output<br>
terminal 64. Upon reception of a sync word, this sync word is detected by the detector 66,<br>
and a disable signal is generated via the output 70 so as to disable the converter 62 during<br>
the time interval that the sync word appears at the input 50. Next, the converter 62 :s<br>
enabled, so that the 3-bit channel words following the sync word can be converted into the 2-<br>
bit source words.<br>
The decoding device of figure 6 could further be provided with a reading<br>
unit 76 for reading a channel signal from a track on the record carrier 23 generated by the<br>
encoding device of figure 1, provided with the writing unit 21. The record carrier 23 can be<br>
a magnetic or an optical record carrier. In the example of a magnetic record carrier 23, the<br>
reading unit 76 is provided with at least one magnetic head 78 for reading the channel signal<br>
from said track on the record carrier 23.<br>
Figure 7 shows an embodiment of the converter 62 of figure 6. The<br><br>
converter 62 comprises a shift register 51, comprising nine cells Y1 to Y9. The shift register<br>
51 functions as a serial-parallel converter so that blocks of three 3-bit channel words are<br>
applied to inputs i1 to i9 of a logic circuit 52. The logic circuit 52 comprises the three tables<br>
I, II and III. Outputs o1 to o6 of the logic circuit 52 are coupled to inputs of cells X1 to X6<br>
of a shift register 54, which has an output 57 coupled to an output terminal 55. A detector<br>
circuit 53 is present having inputs l1 to l6 coupled to outputs of cells Y4 to Y9 respectively of<br>
the shift register 51, and outputs o1 and o2 coupled to control inputs c1 and c2 respectively of<br>
the logic circuit 52. The detector circuit 53 is capable of detecting a '010' bit pattern in the<br>
cells Y4, Y5 and Y6 of the shift register 51 and is capable of detecting a bit pattern<br>
in the cells Y4 to Y9 of the shift register 51.<br>
Upon detection of the '010010' bitpattern, the detector circuit 53<br>
generates a control signal on its output o2, and upon detection of a '010' bit pattern in the<br>
cells Y4, Y5 and Y6, whilst there is no '010' bit pattern in the cells Y7, Y8 and Y9, it<br>
generates a control signal on its output o1.<br>
In the absence of the control signals, the logic circuit 52 converts the 3-bit<br>
channel word stored in the cells Y1, Y2 and Y3 into its corresponding 2-bit source word, as<br>
per the conversion table I, and supplies the 2-bit source word to the cells X1 and X2. In the<br>
presence of the control signal at the input C1, the logic circuit 52 converts the block of two 3-<br>
bit channel words stored in the cells Yl to Y6 into a block of two 2-bit source words, as per<br>
the conversion table II, and supplies the two 2-bit source words to the cells X1 to X4. In the<br>
presence of the control signal at the input c2, the logic circuit 52 converts the block of three<br>
3-bit channel words stored in the cells Yl to Y9 into a block of three 2-bit source words, as<br>
per the conversion table III, and supplies the three 2-bit source words to the cells X1 or X2<br>
In this way, the serial datastream of the channel signal is converted into the serial datastream<br>
of the source signal.<br>
Other sync words that could be used in a parity preserving encoding<br>
device, such as the device described above, will be discussed below. Instead of the 15-bit<br>
sync word described above, a 16-bit sync word could be used that equals<br>
'0100000000100100', or a 17-bit sync word that equals '01000000001001000', or an 18-bit<br>
sync word that equals '010000000010010000'. The three sync words described here may lead<br>
to a violation of the k-constraint, when concatenating the sync word with a following 3-bit<br>
channel word, more specifically, the channel word obtained from the source word '11' in<br>
accordance with table I above. Such concatenation would lead to a sequence:<br><br>
'0100000000100100 000'.<br>
Suppose that the next two source words are the words '10 00'. The<br>
concatenation of the sync word with the group of channel words obtained from converting<br>
the '10 00' source word sequence, would lead to the following sequence:<br>
'0100000000100100 000 000 010',<br>
see table II. This sequence violates the k=8 Constraint.<br>
In order to solve this, one could modify table I, in all cases when a '11'<br>
source word appears directly after the sync word, so that the source word '11' is converted<br>
into the channel word '010'. In a different solution, the conversion from '11' into '010' is<br>
only carried out, when indeed a k-constraint violation would occur with unmodified<br>
conversion.<br>
Whilst the invention has been described with reference to preferred<br>
embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that these are not limitative examples. Thus,<br>
various modifications may become apparent to those skilled in the art, without departing<br>
from the scope of the invention, as defined in the claims.<br>
