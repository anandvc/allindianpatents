				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a recombinant anti-hFasL antibody or antigen-<br>
binding portion thereof. The invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising the antibody and/or antigen-binding portion. The invention also provides a<br>
method of inhibiting hFasL activity using said antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a recombinant anti-hFasL antibody or antigen-<br>
binding portion thereof, comprising minimum of one polypeptide represented by SEQ ID<br>
selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22<br>
and 24.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to recombinant anti-hFasL antibody or antigen-<br>
binding portion thereof. The invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising the antibody and/or antigen-binding portion. The invention also provides a<br>
method of inhibiting hFasL activity using said antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Fas ligand ("FasL") is a protein with an activity to induce apoptosis of a Fas<br>
antigen ("Fas")-expressing cell. Apoptosis of the Fas antigen-expressing cells is believed<br>
to be induced by binding of FasL with Fas on the cell surface, which results in the transfer<br>
of an apoptosis signal to the cell via the Fas antigen. The nucleic acid and protein<br>
sequences of FasL of human, mouse and rat origin are disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,348,334<br>
(incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Human Fas Ligand ("hFasL") is a 40-kDa amino acid, type II membrane-bound<br>
protein that is a member of the TNF family. Membrane-bound FasL can be cleaved by<br>
metalloproteinases to generate soluble FasL, which is primarily a non-covalently linked<br>
homotrimer (Mariani, et ah, Eur. J. Immunol. 25:2303-7 (1995); Kayagaki, et ah, J. Exp.<br>
Med. 182:1777-83 (1995); Tanaka, etah, EMBO 14(6): 1129-35 (1995)). Soluble FasL<br>
appears to be less cytotoxic than membrane-associated FasL (Nagata, Annu. Rev. Genet.<br>
33:29-55 (1999)).<br>
FasL is predominantly expressed on activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells,<br>
while Fas is expressed on various types of cells (Hanabuchi, et ah, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 91:4930-4 (1994); Suda, et. ah, J. Immunol. 154:3806-13 (1995); Arase, et. ah, J.<br>
Exp. Med. 181:1235-8 (1995)). The Fas-FasL signaling pathway is important in<br>
modulating immune responses by inducing cellular apoptosis. Recently, FasL was<br>
reported to be a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, suggesting a pro-inflammatory<br>
function of this molecule. The Fas-FasL signaling pathway has also been implicated in<br>
the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, including autoimmune diseases, renal disorders,<br>
sepsis, viral hepatitis, HIV, influenza and graft-versus-host disease (see, e.g., Krammer, et<br>
ah, Immunol. Rev. 142:175-91 (1994); Nagata and Golstein, Science 267:1449-56<br>
(1995);Yagita, et ah, Immunol. Rev. 146:223-39 (1995); Elovaara, et ah, Acta<br>
Neuropathologica, 98(4):355-62 (199P); Leroy,X. et aL., APMIS, 109(6):469-73,2001).<br>
Antibodies to hFasL comprising mouse antibody sequences, as well as chimeric<br>
antibody species having a fraction of a human antibody sequence, have been described<br>
(see, e.g., International Patent Publication No. WO 95/18819 and U.S. Patents 6,114,507<br><br>
and 6,348,334 and 6,096,312, incorporated herein by reference). However,<br>
immunogenicity problems remain with the use of chimeric antibodies. Producing<br>
humanized antibodies (i.e., chimeric) through recombinant DNA technology provides<br>
uncertain results, including antibodies with unpredictable binding affinities. U.S. Patent<br>
6,348,334 non-descriptively discloses antibodies directed at FasL, however, it does not<br>
specifically describe structural characteristics of such antibodies.<br>
Human antibodies, as defined herein, are advantageous over non-human<br>
antibodies and humanized, chimeric antibodies for use in human therapy for several<br>
reasons. A human monoclonal antibody, i.e., an antibody that is fully human, is less<br>
likely to induce an immunological response in humans than antibodies that contain non-<br>
human portions. Furthermore, a human antibody is less likely to be recognized as a<br>
"foreign" antibody in humans. This will result in slower elimination of the human<br>
antibody from the body than a non-human or partially human antibody. Accordingly, a<br>
human antibody can be administered at lower doses or less often than non-human or<br>
partially human antibodies.<br>
To minimize the potential for cross-species reactivity, the need exists for human<br>
antibodies against FasL, particularly human FasL, with high affinity binding to FasL and<br>
the capacity to disrupt or antagonize the activity of the Fas-FasL signaling pathway in<br>
vitro and in vivo. The present application discloses therapeutically useful human<br>
antibodies, and antigen-binding portions thereof, directed against hFasL and characterized<br>
by high affinity binding to hFasL polypeptides, slow dissociation kinetics, and the<br>
capacity to disrupt or antagonize at least one in vitro and/or in vivo activity associated<br>
with hFasL polypeptides.<br>

The invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described below, as<br>
variations of the particular embodiments may be made and still fall within the scope of the<br>
appended claims. Instead, the scope of the present invention will be established by the<br>
appended claims.<br>
An antibody is an immunoglobulin molecule comprised of four polypeptide<br>
chains, two heavy (H) chains (about 50-70 kDa when full length) and two light (L) chains<br>
(about 25 kDa when full length) inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Light chains are<br>
classified as kappa and lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta,<br>
or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, respectively.<br>
Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as<br>
HCVR) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised<br>
of three domains (CHI, CH2, and CH3) for IgG, IgD, and IgA; and 4 domains (CHI,<br>
CH2, CH3, and CH4) for IgM and IgE. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain<br>
variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR) and a light chain constant region. The light<br>
chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The HCVR and LCVR regions<br>
can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity<br>
determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed<br>
framework regions (FR). Each HCVR and LCVR is composed of three CDRs and four<br>
FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terrmnus in the following order: FR1,<br>
CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is<br>
in accordance with well-known conventions (Kabat, "Sequences of Proteins of<br>
Immunological Interest," National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991);<br>
Chothia, et al.,J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-17 (1987); Chothia, et al., Nature 342:878-83<br>
(1989)). The functional ability of the antibody to bind a particular antigen is largely<br>
determined by the CDRs.<br>
The term "antibody," as used herein, refers to a monoclonal antibody per se. A<br>
monoclonal antibody can be a human antibody, chimeric antibody and/or humanized<br>
antibody. A monoclonal antibody can be a Fab fragment, Fab' fragment or F(ab')2<br>
fragment of a human antibody, chimeric antibody and/or humanized antibody.<br>
Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody can be a single chain FV fragment.<br>
The term "human antibody," as used herein, is (i) an intact antibody, (ii) a<br>
substantially intact antibody, (iii) a portion of an antibody comprising an antigen-binding<br>
site, or (iv) a portion of an antibody comprising a Fab fragment, Fab' fragment or F(ab')2,<br>
having variable and constant regions encoded by nucleic acid sequence information that<br>
occurs in the human germline immunoglobulin region or in recombined and/or mutated<br>
forms thereof whether or not said antibodies are produced in human cells. The term<br>
"human antibody" also includes a human antibody engineered to take the form of a single<br>
chain FV fragment.<br>
Chimeric, humanized, or CDR-grafted antibodies, which contain at least one non-<br>
human Fc, FR, or CDR region, are not human antibodies as referred to herein.<br>
The term "hFasL*' refers to human Fas Ligand, a member of the tumor necrosis<br>
factor family of ligands described in Suda, et al., Cell 75:1169-78 (1993). The function of<br>
hFasL is described further in Kxammer, etal, Immunol. Rev. 142:175-91 (1994);Nagata<br>
and Golstein, Science 267(5203): 1449-56 (1995); and Yagita, et al, Immunol. Rev.<br>
146:223-39 (1995). The term *Tas Ligand" is intended to encompass hFasL as well as<br>
homologs of hFasL derived from other species. The terms "hFasL" and "FasL'1 are<br>
intended to include forms thereof that can be prepared by standard recombinant<br>
expression methods or purchased commercially (Alexis® Biochemicals, Catalog # 522-<br>
001) as well as generated synthetically.<br>
The term "soluble," when used in conjunction with FasL, refers to a cleaved form<br>
of the "membrane-associated" or "membrane bound" form of FasL. Soluble FasL<br>
describes soluble fragments containing at least a portion of the extracellular domain of<br>
membrane bound FasL. Soluble FasL is generated by metalloproteinase cleavage at a<br>
specific site in the extracellular region of FasL, resulting in a soluble molecule<br>
(Hohlbaum, et al., J. Exp. Med. 191 (7): 1209-20 (2000); Tanaka, et al, Nat. Med.<br>
2(3):317-22 (1996); and Kayagaki, et al, J. Exp. Med. 182(6): 1777-83 (1995)). Like the<br>
membrane bound form, soluble FasL is capable of inducing apoptosis upon binding Fas.<br>
The phrases "biological property" or "biological characteristic," or the terms<br>
"activity" or "bioactivity," in reference to an antibody or antibody fragment of the present<br>
invention, are used interchangeably herein and include, but are not limited to, epitope<br>
affinity and specificity (e.g., anti-hFasL human antibody binding to hFasL), ability to<br>
antagonize the activity of the targeted polypeptide in vivo and/or in vitro (e.g., FasL<br>
bioactivity), the in vivo stability of the antibody, and the immunogenic properties of the<br>
antibody. Other identifiable biological properties or characteristics of an antibody<br>
recognized in the art include, for example, cross-reactivity, (i.e., with non-human<br>
homologs of the targeted polypeptide, or with other proteins or tissues, generally), and<br>
ability to preserve high expression levels of protein in mammalian cells. The<br>
aforementioned properties or characteristics can be observed or measured using<br>
art-recognized techniques including, but not limited to ELISA, competitive ELISA,<br>
BIAcore® surface plasmon resonance analysis, in vitro and in vivo neutralization assays<br>
(e.g., Examples 1, 2, and 3), and immunohistochemistry with tissue sections from<br>
different sources including human, primate, or any other source as the need may be.<br>
The term "epitope" as used herein refers to a region of a protein molecule to which<br>
an antibody can bind. An "immunogenic epitope" is defined as the part of a protein that<br>
elicits an antibody response when the whole protein is the immunogen. See, for instance,<br>
Geysen, et ai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998-4002 (1984). An "antigen binding<br>
portion" of an antibody, as used herein, refers to a region of an antibody that interacts<br>
with or binds to an epitope to which the antibody binds when the antigen binding portion<br>
is comprised within an antibody. The antigen binding portion may exist outside the<br>
context of the full length antibody and still be considered to be an antigen binding portion<br>
of the antibody whether or not it still interacts with or binds to an epitope.<br>
The term "inhibit" or "inhibiting" means neutralizing, antagonizing, prohibiting,<br>
preventing, restraining, slowing, disrupting, stopping, or reversing progression or severity<br>
of that which is being inhibited, e.g., including, but not limited to an activity, a disease or<br>
condition.<br>
The term "isolated" when used in relation to a nucleic acid or protein (e.g., an<br>
antibody), refers to a nucleic acid sequence or protein that is identified and separated from<br>
at least one contaminant (nucleic acid or protein, respectively) with which it is ordinarily<br>
associated in its natural source. Isolated nucleic acid or protein is present in a form or<br>
setting that is different from that in which it is found in nature. In contrast, non-isolated<br>
nucleic acids or proteins are found in the state they exist in nature. Preferably, an "isolated<br>
antibody" is an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different<br>
antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds hFas Ligand<br>
substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than hFas Ligand<br>
polypeptide).<br>
As used herein, the term "purified" or "to purify" means the result of any process<br>
which removes some contaminant from the component of interest, such as a protein or<br>
nucleic acid. The percent of a purified component is thereby increased in the sample. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of<br>
antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by<br>
weight, and (2) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions<br>
using Coomassie blue, or preferably, silver stain.<br>
The terms "Kabat numbering" and "Kabat labeling" are used interchangeably<br>
herein. These terms, which are recognized in the art, refer to a system of numbering<br>
amino acid residues which are more variable (i.e., hypervariable) than other amino acid<br>
residues in the heavy and light chain variable regions of an antibody (Kabat, et al, Ann.<br>
NY Acad. Sci. 190:382-93 (1971); Kabat, et al, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological<br>
Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication<br>
, No. 91-3242 (1991)).<br>
A polynucleotide is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional<br>
relationship with another polynucleotide. For example, DNA for a presequence or<br>
secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a<br>
preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is<br>
operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence.<br>
Transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing<br>
human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production can be<br>
employed in the invention. Transfer of the human germline immunoglobulin gene array<br>
in such germline mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon<br>
antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:2551-5<br>
(1993); Jakobovits, et al, Nature 362:255-8 (1993); Bruggemann, et al, Year in Immun.<br>
7:33 (1993); Nature 148:1547-53 (1994), Nature Biotechnology 14:826 (1996); Gross, et<br>
al, Nature 404:995-9 (2000); and U.S. Patent numbers 5,877,397; 5,874,299; 5,814,318;<br>
5,789,650; 5,770,429; 5,661,016; 5,633,425; 5,625,126; 5,569,825; and 5,545,806.<br>
Human antibodies can also be produced in phage display libraries (Hoogenboom<br>
and Winter, J. Mol. Biol. 227:381-8 (1992)). The techniques of Cole, et at, and Boerner,<br>
et ah, are also among those techniques available for the preparation of human monoclonal<br>
antibodies (Cole, et al, Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77<br>
(1985); and Boerner, et al.,J. Immunol. 147:86-95 (1991)).<br>
Recombinant human antibodies may also be subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or,<br>
when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis)<br>
and, thus, the amino acid sequences of the HCVR and LCVR regions of the recombinant<br>
antibodies are sequences that, while derived from those related to human germline HCVR<br>
and LCVR sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline<br>
repertoire in vivo.<br>
The term "neutralizing" or "antagonizing" in reference to an anti-FasL antibody or<br>
the phrase "antibody that antagonizes (neutralizes) FasL activity" or "antagonizes<br>
(neutralizes) FasL" is intended to refer to an antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof,<br>
whose binding to or contact with FasL results in inhibition of a biological activity induced<br>
by FasL polypeptides. Inhibition of FasL biological activity can be assessed by measuring<br>
one or more in vitro or in vivo indicators of FasL biological activity including, but not<br>
limited to, induction of FasL-mediated intracellular signaling, apoptosis, neutrophil<br>
chemotaxis, or inhibition of receptor binding in a FasL receptor binding assay. Indicators<br>
of FasL biological activity can be assessed by one or more of the several in vitro or in vivo<br>
assays known in the art. Preferably, the ability of an antibody to neutralize or antagonize<br>
FasL activity is assessed by inhibition of Fas-FasL mediated apoptosis.<br>
The terms "individual, " "subject," and "patient," used interchangeably herein,<br>
refer to a mammal, including, but not limited to, murine, simian, human, mammalian farm<br>
animals, mammalian sport animals, and mammalian pets.<br>
The term "Koff," as used herein, refers to the off rate constant for dissociation of an<br>
antibody from the antibody/antigen complex. The dissociation rate constant (Koff) of an<br>
anti-hFasL human antibody can be determined by BIAcore® surface plasmon resonance as<br>
generally described in Example 3. Generally, BIAcore® analysis measures real-time<br>
binding interactions between ligand (recombinant FasL polypeptide immobilized on a<br>
biosensor matrix) and analyte (antibodies in solution) by surface plasmon resonance<br>
(SPR) using the BIAcore system (Pharmacia Biosensor, Piscataway, NJ). SPR can also<br>
be performed by immobilizing the analyte (antibodies on a biosensor matrix) and<br>
presenting the ligand in solution. A low off rate for an antigen/antibody complex refers to<br>
a Koff of 10-3 sec-1 or less, preferably 10-4 sec-1 or less, or even more preferably 10-5sec-1 or<br>
less.<br>
The term "Kd," as used herein, refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a<br>
particular antibody-antigen interaction. For purposes of the present invention, KD may be<br>
determined as shown in Example 3. Antibodies with high avidity and/or high affinity<br>
binding with a particular epitope have a Kd of 10-7 M or less, preferably 10-8 M or less,<br>
more preferably 10"9 M or less.<br>
The term "vector" includes a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting<br>
another nucleic acid to which it has been linked including, but not limited to, plasmids<br>
and viral vectors. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into<br>
which they are introduced while other vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host<br>
cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby, are replicated along with the host<br>
genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to<br>
which they are operably linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as "recombinant<br>
expression vectors" (or simply "expression vectors").<br>
The term "host cell" includes an individual cell or cell culture that can be or has<br>
been a recipient of any recombinant vector(s) or isolated polynucleotide of the invention.<br>
Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be<br>
completely identical (in morphology or in total DNA complement) to the original parent<br>
cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation and/or change. A host cell includes a<br>
cell transfected or infected in vivo or in vitro with a recombinant vector or a<br>
polynucleotide of the invention. A host cell which comprises a recombinant vector of the<br>
invention may also be referred to as a "recombinant host cell". Preferably the host cell is<br>
bacterial or mammalian; if mammalian, it is preferably a CHO, COS, NSO or 293 cell.<br>
The present invention relates to human monoclonal antibodies that are specific for<br>
and neutralize a hFasL polypeptide, antigenic fragment thereof, or an hFasL activity.<br>
Also disclosed are antibody heavy and/or light chain fragments that are highly specific<br>
for, and neutralize a FasL polypeptide, antigenic fragment or epitope-bearing thereof, or<br>
an hFasL activity, preferably the binding of hFasL to Fas. This high specificity for<br>
binding FasL enables the anti-hFasL human antibodies, antigen-binding portions thereof,<br>
and human monoclonal antibodies with like specificity, to be immunotherapeutic to Fas-<br>
FasL associated diseases.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated anti-hFasL human<br>
antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, comprising at least one, preferably at least<br>
two, of the amino acid sequences selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs : 2,<br>
4,6,8,10,12,14,16, 18,20,22, and 24. The sequences represented in SEQ ID NOs 4,<br>
6, 8, 12,14, 16, 20, 22 and 24, when present in an antibody of the invention are preferably<br>
positioned in the antibody of the invention at the same CDR location as depicted in<br>
Tables 1, 2 and 3 herein and as they are positioned in SEQ ED NO: 2 (for SEQ ID NOs: 4,<br>
6 and 8), SEQ ID NO: 10 (for SEQ ID NOs: 12, 14, andl6) and SEQ ID NO: 18 (for SEQ<br>
ID NOs: 20, 22 and 24).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides an isolated anti-FasL human<br>
antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, that binds a soluble FasL polypeptide (or<br>
antigenic fragment thereof) with an equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of 2 x 10-7 M<br>
or less, more preferably 2 x 10-8 M or less and even more preferably 2 x 10-9 M or less (as<br>
determined by solid phase BIAcore® surface plasmon resonance at room temperature),<br>
dissociates from a FasL polypeptide with a low koff rate constant, and has the capacity to<br>
antagonize a FasL polypeptide activity.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides an isolated anti-hFasL human<br>
antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, that inhibits FasL-mediated apoptosis in an<br>
in vitro neutralization assay with an IC50 of 10 nM or less (alternatively 9 nM or less, 8<br>
nM or less, 7 nM or less, 6 nM or less, or 5 nM or less) for membrane-bound FasL, or an<br>
IC50 of 0.2 nM or less (alternatively 0.19 nM or less, 0.18 nM or less, 0.17 nM or less, or<br>
0.15 nM or less) for soluble FasL. Such an antigen-binding portion of the invention may<br>
exist alone or within a hFasL human antibody. In a more preferred embodiment, the<br>
isolated anti-hFasL human antibody binds a soluble FasL polypeptide with an equilibrium<br>
dissociation constant, Kd, of 1 x 10-7 M or less, more preferably 1 x 10-8 M or less, even<br>
more preferably 1 x 10-9 M or less (as determined by solid phase BIAcore® at room<br>
temperature). Examples of anti-hFasL human antibodies that meet the aforementioned<br>
kinetic and neutralization criteria include 3E1 and 4G11 antibodies, as described in<br>
Examples 1, 2, and 3.<br>
The most preferred anti-hFasL human antibody of the present invention is that<br>
referred to herein as 3E1. The 3E1 antibody has LCVR and HCVR comprising a<br>
polypeptide with a sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 10, respectively<br>
(see Tables 1 and 3 herein). Exemplary polynucleotide sequences encoding the LCVR<br>
and HCVR of 3E1 are shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO:9, respectively.<br>
In another embodiment, a preferred anti-hFasL human antibody is that referred to<br>
herein as 4G11. The 4G11 antibody has LCVR and HCVR comprising a polypeptide<br>
with a sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 18, respectively (see Tables<br>
2 and 3 herein). Exemplary polynucleotide sequences encoding the LCVR and HCVR of<br>
4G11 are shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ED NO: 17, respectively.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated anti-hFasL human<br>
antibody Fab and an anti-hFasL human antibody F(ab')2 fragment comprising a HCVR<br>
comprising a polypeptide with the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 10 or SEQ ED<br>
NO: 18, and further comprising an LCVR comprising a polypeptide with the amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ED NO:2 for each antibody, 3E1 and 4G11. In yet another embodiment,<br>
the invention provides isolated anti-hFasL human antibody, or antigen-binding portions<br>
thereof, comprising at least one, preferably at least 2, 3,4 5 or 6 polypeptides with an<br>
amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 4,6, 8, 12, 14,<br>
16, 20, 22, and 24. Preferably, the amino acid sequence as shown SEQ ED NOs: 4, 12 or<br>
20, when it exists in an antibody of the invention, is located at CDR1. Preferably the<br>
amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 6, 14 or 22, when it exists in an antibody<br>
of the invention, is located at CDR2. And, preferably the amino acid sequence as shown<br>
in SEQ ID NOs: 8, 16, or 24, when it exists in an antibody of the invention, is located at<br>
CDR3. Preferred embodiments provide an isolated anti-hFasL human antibody, or<br>
antigenic-binding portion thereof, that inhibits soluble FasL-induced apoptosis in an in<br>
vitro neutralization assay with an IC50 of 0.5 nM or less, more preferably about 0.3 or less,<br>
more preferably about 0.15 nM or less; or membrane-bound FasL-induced proliferation or<br>
apoptosis in an in vitro neutralization assay with an IC50 of 10 nM or less, preferably<br>
about 9, 8, 7, 6 or 5 nM or less.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention is also directed to cell lines that<br>
produce an anti-hFasL human antibody described herein. Isolation of cell lines producing<br>
a monoclonal antibody of the invention can be accomplished using routine screening<br>
techniques known in the art. Several cell lines that produce an anti-hFasL human<br>
antibody of the present invention have been deposited with ATCC (American Type<br>
Culture Collection). A mouse hybridoma secreting human IgG4 kappa (from a HuMab-<br>
mouse®) 3E1 is assigned reference number ATCC PTA-4017, and a mouse hybridoma<br>
secreting human IgG4 kappa (from a HuMab-mouse®) 4G11 is assigned reference number<br>
ATCC PTA-4018. Most preferred anti-hFasL human antibodies of the present invention<br>
have the same, or a substantially similar, amino acid sequence within at least 1, more<br>
preferably at least 2, 3,4, 5 or 6 hypervariable regions (i.e., CDRs) as present in one or<br>
more of the above-mentioned ATCC deposited antibodies.<br>
A wide variety of host expression systems can be used to express an antibody of<br>
the present invention including prokaryotic (bacterial) and eukaryotic expression systems<br>
(such as yeast, baculoviral, plant, mammalian and other animal cells, transgenic animals,<br>
and hybridoma cells), as well as phage display expression systems. An example of a<br>
suitable bacterial expression vector is pUCl 19 (Sfi), and a suitable eukaryotic expression<br>
vector is a modified pcDNA3.1 vector with a weakened DHFR selection system. Other<br>
antibody expression systems are also known in the art and are contemplated herein.<br>
Numerous suitable mammalian host cells are known in the art including, but not limited<br>
to, COS, CHO, NSO and 293 cells.<br>
An antibody of the invention can be prepared by recombinant expression of<br>
immunoglobulin light and heavy chain genes in a host cell. To express an antibody<br>
recombinantly, a host cell is transfected with one or more recombinant expression vectors<br>
carrying DNA fragments encoding the immunoglobulin light and heavy chains of the<br>
antibody such that the light and heavy chains are expressed in the host cell. Preferably,<br>
the recombinant antibodies are secreted into the medium in which the host cells are<br>
cultured, from which the antibodies can be recovered. Standard recombinant DNA<br>
methodologies are used to obtain antibody heavy and light chain genes, incorporate these<br>
genes into recombinant expression vectors, and introduce the vectors into host cells. Such<br>
standard recombinant DNA technologies are described, for example, in Sambrook,<br>
Fritsch, and Maniatis (Eds.), Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1989); Ausubel, et al (Eds.) Current Protocols in Molecular<br>
Biology, Greene Publishing Associates, (1989); and in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,397 by Boss,<br>
etal.<br>
An isolated DNA encoding a HCVR region can be converted to a full-length<br>
heavy chain gene by operably linking the HCVR-encoding DNA to another DNA<br>
molecule encoding heavy chain constant regions (CHI, CH2, and CH3). The sequences<br>
of human heavy chain constant region genes are known in the art. See, e.g., Kabat, et al.,<br>
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of<br>
Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242 (1991). DNA fragments<br>
encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The heavy<br>
chain constant region can be an IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgE, IgM or IgD constant<br>
region and any allotypic variant thereof as described in Kabat {supra), but most preferably<br>
is an IgG4 or an IgGl constant region. Alternatively, the antigen binding portion can be a<br>
Fab fragment, a F(ab')2 fragment, or a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). For a Fab<br>
fragment heavy chain gene, the HCVR-encoding DNA can be operably linked to another<br>
DNA molecule encoding only a heavy chain CHI constant region.<br>
An isolated DNA encoding a LCVR region can be converted to a full-length light<br>
chain gene (as well as a Fab light chain gene) by operably linking the LCVR-encoding<br>
DNA to another DNA molecule encoding a light chain constant region, CL. The<br>
sequences of human light chain constant region genes are known in the art. See, e.g.,<br>
Kabat, supra. DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard<br>
PCR amplification. The light chain constant region can be a kappa or lambda constant<br>
region.<br>
To create an scFv gene, the HCVR- and LCVR-encoding DNA fragments are<br>
operably linked to another fragment encoding a flexible linker, e.g., encoding the amino<br>
acid sequence (Gly4-Ser)3, such that the HCVR and LCVR sequences can be expressed as<br>
a contiguous single-chain protein, with the LCVR and HCVR regions joined by the<br>
flexible linker. See, e.g.. Bird, et al., Science 242:423-6 (1988); Huston, et al, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-83 (1988); McCafferty, et al., Nature 348:552-4 (1990).<br>
To express an antibody of the invention, a DNA encoding a partial or full-length<br>
light and/or heavy chain, obtained as described above, are inserted into an expression<br>
vector such that the gene is operably linked to transcriptional and translational control<br>
sequences. In this context, the term "operably linked" is means that an antibody gene is<br>
ligated into a vector such that transcriptional and translational control sequences within<br>
the vector serve their intended function of regulating the transcription and translation of<br>
the antibody gene. The expression vector and expression control sequences are chosen to<br>
be compatible with the expression host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the<br>
antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into separate vectors or, more typically, both<br>
genes are inserted into the same expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted into<br>
the expression vector by standard methods. Additionally, the recombinant expression<br>
vector can encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the anti-hFasL human<br>
antibody light and/or heavy chain from a host cell. The anti-hFasL human antibody light<br>
and/or heavy chain gene can be cloned into the vector such that the signal peptide is<br>
operably linked in-frame to the amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The signal<br>
peptide can be an immunoglobulin signal peptide or a heterologous signal peptide.<br>
In addition to the antibody heavy and/or light chain gene(s), a recombinant<br>
expression vector of the invention carries regulatory sequences that control the expression<br>
of the antibody chain gene(s) in a host cell. The term "regulatory sequence" is intended to<br>
include promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements {e.g., polyadenylation<br>
signals), as needed, that control the transcription or translation of the antibody chain<br>
gene(s). The design of the expression vector, including the selection of regulatory<br>
sequences may depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the<br>
level of expression of protein desired. Preferred regulatory sequences for mammalian<br>
host cell expression include viral elements that direct high levels of protein expression in<br>
mammalian cells, such as promoters and/or enhancers derived from cytomegalovirus<br>
(CMV), Simian Virus 40 (SV40), adenovirus, (e.g., the adenovirus major late promoter<br>
(AdMLP)) and polyoma virus.<br>
In addition to the antibody heavy and/or light chain genes and regulatory<br>
sequences, the recombinant expression vectors of the invention may carry additional<br>
sequences, such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells (e.g.,<br>
origins of replication) and one or more selectable marker genes. The selectable marker<br>
gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced. For<br>
example, typically the selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs, such as G418,<br>
hygromycin, or methotrexate, on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced.<br>
Preferred selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for<br>
use in DHFR-minus host cells with methotrexate selection / amplification), the neo gene<br>
(for G418 selection), and ghitamine synthetase (GS) in a GS-negative cell line (such as<br>
"NSO) for selection/amplification.<br>
For expression of the light and/or heavy chains, the expression vector(s) encoding<br>
the heavy and/or light chains is transfected into a host cell by standard techniques e.g.,<br>
electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran transfection and the like.<br>
Although it is theoretically possible to express the antibodies of the invention in either<br>
prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells, preferably eukaryotic cells, and most preferably<br>
mammalian host cells, because such cells, are more likely to assemble and secrete a<br>
properly folded and imnunologically active antibody. Preferred mammalian host cells for<br>
expressing the recombinant antibodies of the invention include Chinese Hamster Ovary<br>
(CHO cells) (including DHFR-CHO cells, described in Urlaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-20 (1980), used with a DHFR selectable marker, eg., as<br>
described in Kaufman and Sharp, J. Mol. Biol. 159:601-21 (1982)), NSO myeloma cells,<br>
COS cells, and SP2/0 cells. When recombinant expression vectors encoding antibody<br>
genes are introduced into mammalian host cells, the antibodies are produced by culturing<br>
the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the<br>
i<br>
host cells or, more preferably, secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which<br>
the host cells are grown. Antibodies can be recovered from the host cell and/or the<br>
culture medium using standard purification methods.<br>
Host cells can also be used to produce portions, or fragments, of intact antibodies,<br>
e.g., Fab fragments or scFv molecules. It will be understood that variations on the above<br>
procedure are within the scope of the present invention. For example, it may be desirable<br>
to transfect a host cell with DNA encoding either the light chain or the heavy chain (but<br>
not both) of an antibody of this invention. Recombinant DNA technology may also be<br>
used to remove some or all the DNA encoding either or both of the light and heavy chains<br>
that is not necessary for binding to hFas Ligand. The molecules expressed from such<br>
truncated DNA molecules are also encompassed by the antibodies of the invention.<br>
In a preferred system for recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention, a<br>
recombinant expression vector encoding both the antibody heavy chain and the antibody<br>
light chain is introduced into DHFR-CHO cells by calcium phosphate-mediated<br>
transfection. Within the recombinant expression vector, the antibody heavy and light<br>
chain genes are each operably linked to enhancer/promoter regulatory elements (eg.,<br>
derived from SV40, CMV, adenovirus and the like, such as a CMV enhancer/AdMLP<br>
promoter regulatory element or an SV40 enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory element)<br>
to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also<br>
carries a DHFR gene, which allows for selection of cells, e.g., CHO cells, that have been<br>
transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection/amplification. The selected<br>
transformant host cells are cultured to allow for expression of the antibody heavy and<br>
light chains and intact antibody is recovered from the culture medium. Standard<br>
molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector,<br>
transfect the host cells, select for transformants, culture the host cells and recover the<br>
antibody from the culture medium. Antibodies, or antigen-binding portions thereof, of the<br>
invention can be expressed in an animal (eg., a mouse) that is transgenic for human<br>
immunoglobulin genes (see, e.g., Taylor, et at., Nucleic Acids Res. 20:6287-95(1992)).<br>
Plant cells can also be modified to create transgenic plants that express the antibody, or an<br>
antigen-binding portion thereof, of the invention.<br>
In view of the foregoing, another embodiment of the invention pertains to nucleic<br>
acids, vectors, and host cell compositions that can be used for recombinant expression of<br>
the antibodies and antibody portions of the invention. Preferably, the invention provides<br>
isolated nucleic acids that comprise a region encoding one or more CDRs of 3E1 or 4G11<br>
and even more preferably those CDRs exist in the expressed protein (e.g., antibody or<br>
antigen binding portion thereof) at the same CDR site within the antibody structure as<br>
they exist in antibody 3E1 or 4G11. Preferably, the invention provides isolated nucleic<br>
acids that comprise a region encoding the heavy chain variable region of 3E1 or 4G11<br>
and/or the light chain variable region of 3E1 or 4G11. Accordingly, in one embodiment,<br>
the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide comprising an<br>
antibody heavy chain variable region of 3E1 heavy chain CDR3 with a sequence as shown<br>
in SEQ ID NO: 16 and/or a heavy chain CDR2 with a sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:<br>
14 and/or the 3E1 heavy chain CDR1 with the sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12.<br>
Most preferably, the isolated nucleic acid encodes a polypeptide comprising an antibody<br>
heavy chain variable region with a sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 10 (the full HCVR<br>
region of 3E1).<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding a<br>
polypeptide comprising a heavy chain variable region of the 4G11 heavy chain CDR3<br>
with a sequence as shown in SEQ ED NO: 24 and/or the 4G11 heavy chain CDR2 with a<br>
sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 22 and/or the 4G11 heavy chain CDR1 with sequence<br>
as shown in SEQ ID NO: 20. Even more preferably, the isolated nucleic acid encodes a<br>
polypeptide comprising an antibody heavy chain variable region comprising the sequence<br>
as shown in SEQ ID NO: 18 (the full HCVR region of 4G11).<br>
It is contemplated that the heavy chain and/or light chain present in an antibody of<br>
the invention may comprise various combinations of the CDRs of the invention, e.g.,<br>
CDR1 and CDR2; CDR1 and CDR3; CDR2 and CDR3; or CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3.<br>
(CDR1 with a sequence as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 4,12 or 20; CDR2 with a sequence as<br>
shown in SEQ ID NOs: 6, 14 or 22; CDR3 with a sequence as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 8,<br>
16 or 24). Preferably the CDR sequences, when they exist in an antibody of the invention,<br>
exist at the same CDR position, in an antibody of the invention as they do in antibody 3E1<br>
or 4G11. It is contemplated that the CDRs may exist in different chains in other<br>
antibodies of the invention than they do in antibody 3E1 or 4G11. However, most<br>
preferably, the CDR sequences when they exist in an antibody of the invention, exist at<br>
the same CDR position and in the same chain (light or heavy) as they do in antibody 3E1<br>
or4Gll.<br>
In still another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid<br>
encoding an antibody light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of<br>
SEQ ED NO: 2 (i.e., the 3E1 or 4G11 LCVR). Preferably this nucleic acid comprises the<br>
nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, although the skilled artisan will appreciate that<br>
due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, other nucleotide sequences can encode the<br>
amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. The nucleic acid can encode only the LCVR or<br>
can also encode an antibody light chain constant region, operably linked to the LCVR. In<br>
one embodiment, this nucleic acid is in a recombinant expression vector.<br>
In still another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid<br>
encoding an antibody heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of<br>
SEQ ID NO: 10 (i.e., the 3E1 HCVR). This nucleic acid may comprise the nucleotide<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9, although the skilled artisan will appreciate that due to the<br>
degeneracy of the genetic code, other nucleotide sequences can encode the amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10. The nucleic acid can encode only the HCVR or can also<br>
encode e.g., a heavy chain constant region, operably linked to the HCVR. For example,<br>
the nucleic acid can comprise an IgG4 or an IgGl constant region. In one embodiment,<br>
this nucleic acid is in a recombinant expression vector.<br>
In still another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid<br>
encoding an antibody heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of<br>
SEQ ID NO: 18 (i.e., the 4G11 HCVR). This nucleic acid may comprise the nucleotide<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 17, although the skilled artisan will appreciate that due to the<br>
degeneracy of the genetic code, other nucleotide sequences can encode the amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18. The nucleic acid can encode only the HCVR or can also<br>
encode a heavy chain constant region, operably linked to the HCVR. In another<br>
embodiment, this nucleic acid is in a recombinant expression vector.<br>
The invention also provides recombinant expression vectors encoding both an<br>
antibody heavy chain and an antibody light chain. For example, in one embodiment, the<br>
invention provides a recombinant expression vector encoding:<br>
a) an antibody heavy chain having a variable region comprising the amino acid<br>
sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 10 and 18;<br>
and<br>
b) an antibody light chain having a variable region comprising the amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2.<br>
The invention also provides host cells into which one or more of the recombinant<br>
expression vectors of the invention have been introduced. Preferably, the host cell is a<br>
mammalian host cell, more preferably the host cell is a CHO cell, an NSO cell or a COS<br>
cell. Still further the invention provides a method of synthesizing a recombinant human<br>
antibody of the invention by culturing a host cell of the invention in a suitable culture<br>
medium until a recombinant human antibody of the invention is synthesized. The method<br>
can further comprise isolating the recombinant human antibody from the culture medium,<br>
the host cell, or both.<br>
Once expressed, the whole antibodies, their dimers, individual light and heavy<br>
chains, or other immunoglobulin forms of the present invention can be purified according<br>
to standard procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion<br>
exchange, affinity, reverse phase, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, gel<br>
electrophoresis and the like. Substantially pure immunoglobulins of at least about 90 to<br>
95% homogeneity are preferred, and 98 to 99% or more homogeneity most preferred, for<br>
pharmaceutical uses. Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, the<br>
polypeptides may then be used therapeutically or prophylactically, as directed herein.<br>
The antibodies or antibody fragments of the present invention can be incorporated<br>
into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a subject. Typically, the<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprises an antibody or antibody portion of the invention<br>
and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, and/or excipient. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions for administration are designed to be appropriate for the selected mode of<br>
administration, and pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carrier, and/or excipients such<br>
as dispersing agents, buffers, surfactants, preservatives, solubilizing agents, isotonicity<br>
agents, stabilizing agents and the like are used as appropriate.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-hFasL human antibody of the<br>
present invention can be administered to a mammal at risk for or exhibiting pathologies<br>
associated with Fas-FasL interactions using standard administration techniques by<br>
intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, pulmonary, transdermal, intramuscular,<br>
intranasal, buccal, sublingual, or suppository administration.<br>
The antibodies of the invention can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical<br>
composition suitable for parenteral administration. Peripheral systemic delivery by<br>
intravenous or intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection is preferred. Suitable vehicles for<br>
such injections are straightforward and known in the art.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the<br>
conditions of manufacture and stoiage. Therefore, pharmaceutical compositions may be<br>
sterile filtered after making the formulation, or otherwise mademicrobiologically<br>
acceptable. A typical composition for intravenous infusion could have a volume as much<br>
as 250 mL of fluid, such as sterile Ringer's solution, and 1 tolOO mg/mL, or more in<br>
antibody concentration. Therapeutic agents of the invention can all be frozen or<br>
lyophilized for storage and reconstituted in a suitable sterile carrier prior to use.<br>
Lyophilization and reconstitution can lead to varying degrees of antibody activity loss<br>
(e.g., with conventional immunoglobulins, IgM antibodies tend to have greater activity<br>
loss than IgG antibodies). Dosages may have to be adjusted to compensate. Generally,<br>
pH between 6 and 8 is preferred.<br>
FasL plays a critical role in the pathology associated with a variety of diseases<br>
involving immune and inflammatory factors. Therefore, a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising an anti-hFasL human antibody of the invention can be used to treat or prevent<br>
autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including, but not limited to, systemic<br>
inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acute<br>
respiratory distress syndrome, severe sepsis, trauma, graft-versus-host disease, organ<br>
rejection associated with organ transplant, multiple sclerosis, idiopathic pulmonary<br>
fibrosis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,<br>
acute myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, cardiac reperfusion injury, diabetes, cancers<br>
(including e.g., cancers which express FasL as a mechanism of evading the immune<br>
response and cancer types such as breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, colon cancer,<br>
NSCLC, lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma), human immunodeficiency virus,<br>
influenza virus and hepatic disorders including but not limited to fulminant viral hepatitis<br>
B or C, chronic hepatitis C virus, chronic hepatitis B virus, alcoholic hepatitis, and hepatic<br>
cirrhosis, and renal disorders including, but not limited to, acute renal disease, chronic<br>
renal disease, diabetic nephropathy.<br>
The use of an anti-hFasL human antibody of the present invention for the<br>
treatment of at least one of the aforementioned disorders in which FasL activity is<br>
detrimental is also contemplated herein. Additionally, the use of the antibody of an anti-<br>
hFasL human antibody of the present invention for use in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of at least one of the aforementioned disorders in which<br>
FasL activity is detrimental is contemplated.<br>
As used herein, the terms "treatment", "treating", and the like, refer to obtaining a<br>
desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect. The effect may be prophylactic in terms<br>
of completely or partially preventing a disease or symptom thereof and/or may be<br>
therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for a disease and/or adverse affect<br>
attributable to the disease. "Treatment", as used herein, covers any treatment of a disease<br>
in a mammal, particularly in a human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease from<br>
occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been<br>
diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; and (c)<br>
relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention preferably is a "therapeutically<br>
effective amount" or a "prophylacticaily effective amount" of an antibody of the<br>
invention. A "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages<br>
and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the antibody may vary according to factors such as the<br>
disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the antibody or<br>
antibody portion to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective<br>
amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effect of the antibody, or antigen-<br>
binding portion thereof, are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A<br>
"prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for<br>
periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, since a<br>
prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the<br>
prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.<br>
Dosage regimens maybe adjusted to provide the optimum desired response {e.g., a<br>
therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered,<br>
several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally<br>
reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
Given their ability to bind to hFasL, antibodies of the invention can be used to<br>
detect FasL polypeptides {e.g., in a biological sample, such as serum or plasma), using a<br>
conventional immunoassay, such as an enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), a<br>
radioimmunoassay (RIA) or tissue immunohistochemistry. The invention provides a<br>
method for detecting FasL in a biological sample comprising contacting a biological<br>
sample with an antibody, or antibody portion, of the invention and detecting either the<br>
antibody (or antibody portion) bound to hFasL or unbound antibody (or antibody portion),<br>
to thereby detect hFasL in the biological sample. The antibody is directly or indirectly<br>
labeled with a detectable substance to facilitate detection of the bound or unbound<br>
antibody. Suitable detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups,<br>
fluorescent materials, luminescent materials and radioactive materials. Examples of<br>
suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, betagalactosidase,<br>
or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include<br>
streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include<br>
umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine<br>
fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material<br>
includes luminol; and examples of a radioactive material include 125I, 131I, 35S, or 3H.<br>
FasL can be assayed in biological fluids by a competition immunoassay utilizing<br>
FasL standards labeled with a detectable substance and an unlabeled anti-hFasL human<br>
antibody. In this assay, the biological sample, the labeled FasL standards and the anti-<br>
hFasL human antibody are combined and the amount of labeled FasL standard bound to<br>
the unlabeled antibody is determined. The amount of FasL in the sample is inversely<br>
proportional to the amount of labeled FasL standard bound to the anti-hFasL human<br>
antibody.<br>
An anti-hFasL antibody of the present invention may be used in a diagnostic assay<br>
for FasL expression. Various diagnostic assay techniques known in the art may be used,<br>
such as competitive binding assays, direct or indirect ELISA sandwich assays and<br>
immunoprecipitation assays conducted in either heterogeneous or homogeneous phases.<br>
See, e.g., Zola, Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques, CRC Press, Inc. (1987)<br>
pp. 147-158. The antibody used in the assay can be labeled with a detectable moiety. The<br>
detectable moiety should be capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a<br>
detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope, such as 3H,<br>
!4C, 32P, 35S, or 125I, a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound (such as fluorescein<br>
isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin), or an enzyme (such as alkaline phosphatase, ß-<br>
galactosidase or horseradish peroxidase). Any method known in the art for conjugating<br>
the antibody to the detectable moiety may be employed.<br>
Example 1: Functional Activity Determined using a Jurkat Assay with Soluble hFasL<br>
FasL/enhancer media is prepared at 4X concentration. IX media contains<br>
50 ng/ml recombinant human soluble FasL (Alexis® Biochemicals, Catalog # 522-001)<br>
and 1 µg/ml anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (enhancer; Sigma Chemical Co.,<br>
Catalog # F-3165) in Jurkat cell assay media (DMEM:F-12 (3:1), 10% FBS, 20 mM<br>
HEPES, and 50 ug/mL Gentamicin). IX media is used as the "100% apoptosis" control.<br>
Jurkat cell media without FasL or enhancer is used as the "0% apoptosis" control.<br>
The media is incubated at room temperature for one hour. For each determination,<br>
25 µl of either 4X enhanced Fas Ligand media or a control sample are added to each well<br>
in a 96-well plate. Next, 25 µl of either an inhibitor sample (3E1 or 4G11 anti-hFasL<br>
antibody) or a control sample is added to each well. This addition dilutes all samples and<br>
media to one-half the original concentration. Samples are incubated 45 to 60 minutes at<br>
room temperature. Next, 50 µl of Jurkat cells, at a concentration of 106 cells/ml of<br>
solution, are added to each well. This addition yields IX enhanced FasL, samples at one-<br>
fourth their initial concentration, and 5 x 104 Jurkat cells/well. The plates are incubated<br>
for three hours at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. WST-1 Cell Proliferation Reagent (Roche,<br>
Catalog # 1 644 807) is added at a concentration of 10 µl/well. The plates are incubated<br>
again for approximately 18 hours at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. Plates are then read on a<br>
spectrophotometric plate reader at an optimal wavelength of 450 nm. Results indicate<br>
that both anti-hFasL human antibodies, 3E1 and 4G11, are effective in neutralizing<br>
soluble FasL-mediated apoptosis in this assay<br>
Example 2: CHO-K1 / Jurkat Assay with Membrane-Bound FasL<br>
A CHO-K1 cell line stably expressing a non-cleavable version of hFasL, labeled<br>
DeLhuFasL CHO-K1, is engineered to assay the ability of the antibodies 3E1 and 4G11 to<br>
block activity of membrane-associated FasL. This cell line expresses surface levels of<br>
FasL which, when co-cultured with Jurkat cells, induces Jurkat apoptosis.<br>
Adherent CHO-1 cell media is prepared using DMEM:F-12 (3:1), 5% FBS,<br>
40 ug/ml L-proline (Sigma), 50 ng/mL Gentamicin (Sigma), and 600 ug/ml G418. For<br>
each determination, approximately 104 CHO-K1 cells (either DeLhuFasL or parent CHO-<br>
Kl) are added per well on 96-well plates. Cells are incubated overnight at 37°C in 5%<br>
carbon dioxide. The media is removed, and 100 µl of either inhibitor sample (3E1 or<br>
4G11 antibody; serial dilutions covering a range of concentrations) or control (media) are<br>
added to each well. The plates are incubated for one hour at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide.<br>
Fifty microliters of Jurkat cells (2.5 x 105 cells/well) are added to each well, and the plates<br>
are incubated for two hours at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. Ten microliters of WST-1<br>
Cell Proliferation Reagent are added per well. The plates are again incubated, for four<br>
hours at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. The plates are then read on a spectrophotometric<br>
plate reader at an optimal wavelength of 450 nm. Results indicate that both antibodies,<br>
3E1 and 4G11, are effective in blocking membrane bound FasL-mediated apoptosis in<br>
this assay.<br>
Example 3: Affinity Measurement of Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
The affinity of various anti-hFasL antibodies for recombinant human soluble (rhs)<br>
FasL (Alexis® Biochemicals, Catalog # 522-001) is measured using a BIAcore® 2000<br>
instrument. The BIAcore® utilizes the optical properties of surface plasmon resonance to<br>
detect alteration in protein concentration of interacting molecules within a dextran<br>
biosensor matrix. Except where noted, all reagents and materials are purchased from<br>
BIAcore® AB (Upsala, Sweden). All measurements are performed at room temperature.<br>
Samples are dissolved in HBS-EP buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 3 mM EDTA,<br>
0.005% (w/v) surfactant P-20, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Goat anti-human Fc<br>
antibody is immobilized on flow cells 1 and 2 of a Bl sensor chip at a level of 500<br>
response units (RUs) using an amine coupling kit.<br>
Binding of rhs FasL is evaluated using multiple analytical cycles. Each cycle is<br>
performed at a flow rate of 50 µl/minute and consisted of the following steps: injection of<br>
10 uL of an anti-hFasL3El antibody at 1 ug/ml, injection of 240 \iL of rhs FasL (starting<br>
at 100 nM and using two-fold serial dilutions for each cycle) followed by 20 minutes for<br>
dissociation, and regeneration using 50 µl of 10 mM glycine hydrochloride, pH 1.5.<br>
Association and dissociation rates for each cycle are evaluated using a "Langmuir 1:1<br>
with mass transport" binding model in the BIAevaluation software.<br>
Example 4: HepG2 Apoptosis Assay with Recombinant Soluble Fas Ligand<br>
A HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma; ATCC # HB-8065) cell line is used to assess<br>
neutralization of recombinant soluble FasL by antibodies 3E1 and 4G11. Cell media is<br>
prepared using DMEM:F-12 (3:1), 10% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, and 50 ug/ml gentamicin.<br>
For each determination, HepG2 cells are seeded on 96-well poly-D-lysine coated plates at<br>
a concentration of 1 x 104 cells/well in 200 µl media. Cells are incubated overnight at<br>
37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. The media is removed, and replaced with 100 µl of media<br>
containing 60 ug/ml bleomycin sulfate (Sigma Chemical, Catalog # B8416). Plates are<br>
incubated overnight using a humidity chamber.<br>
A stock solution of human FasL-FLAG is prepared in assay media (final<br>
concentration is 50 ng/ml FasL and 1 ug/ml anti-FLAG enhancer to form enhanced FasL).<br>
Anti-FasL antibodies are added to a portion of the stock solution to prepare enhanced<br>
FasL media with inhibitor. Each solution is incubated for one hour at room temperature.<br>
For 100% apoptosis control samples, 50 µl/well of the, enhanced FasL solution are added<br>
to the bleomycin-containing media already in the wells. For inhibitor samples,<br>
100 µl/well of the enhanced FasL plus antibody solution are added to the bleomycin-<br>
containing media already in the wells. The plates are then incubated overnight at 37°C in<br>
5% carbon dioxide.<br>
A one to one dilution of WST-1 Cell Proliferation Reagent and media is made.<br>
Twenty microliters of diluted WST-1 are added to each well. The plates are again<br>
incubated overnight at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. The plates are then read on a<br>
spectrophotometric plate reader at an optimal wavelength of 450 nm. Results indicate<br>
that as the concentration of antibody decreases, apoptosis increases.<br>
Example 5: Cloning and Sequencing of Heavy and Light Chain Antigen Binding Regions<br>
The variable region for the heavy and light chain for the neutralizing human mAb<br>
3E1 are cloned and sequenced using the following protocols.<br>
mRNA is prepared from 2 x 106 hybridoma cells using the Micro-Fast Track<br>
protocol (Invitrogen) supplied with the kit. cDNA is prepared from 200 µl ethanol<br>
precipitate of mRNA using cDNA Cycle kit (Invitrogen) by spinning the aliquot of<br>
mRNA for thirty minutes at 14,000 rpm at 4°C followed by washing the pellet with 70%<br>
ethanol. The air-dried pellet is resuspended in 11.5 µl of sterile water, and cDNA is<br>
prepared following the kit's instructions. The cDNA is precipitated using ethanol then<br>
resuspended in 30 µl water for use in PCR.<br>
The PCR reactions are set up with degenerate primers at the 5' end of the variable<br>
region for the heavy and light chain paired with 3' primers in the constant region. For<br>
each 50 µl reaction, 1 µl cDNA is used. The reaction is set up as directed for use with Pfu<br>
I followed by twenty cycles. The PCR products are checked by running 5 µl of each<br>
reaction on a 2% agarose gel. The positive reactions are cloned using the Zero Blunt<br>
TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Minipreps from the positive clones are sequenced<br>
and analyzed for productive gene rearrangements. Results from independent PCR<br>
reactions and sequencing of multiple clones revealed sequences of the present invention.<br>
Example 6: Primary Rat Hepatocvte Assay<br>
Apoptosis plays a role in toxic liver damage, fulminant liver failure, hepatocellular<br>
carcinoma, immune-mediated liver disease, and viral hepatitis (Kanzler and Galle,<br>
Seminars Cancer Biol. 10(3): 173-84 (2000)). Previous studies have demonstrated that<br>
primary human hepatocytes are susceptible to apoptosis induced by FasL. More easily<br>
attainable rat primary hepatocytes have indicated that these cells are equally susceptible to<br>
apoptosis induced by hFasL. This assay system is used to demonstrate that rat hepatocyte<br>
death and caspase activation, indicative of intracellular signaling induced by Fas-FasL<br>
interaction, is inhibited by anti-hFasL human monoclonal antibodies, 3E1 and 4G11.<br>
Rat primary hepatocytes in matrigel in 12-well plates at 7 X 105 cells/well are<br>
purchased (In Vitro Technologies, Catalog # M00717MG). The cells are incubated for<br>
either four or twenty-four hours in the following conditions: (1) unstimulated, (2) human<br>
FasL stimulated, (3) hFasL stimulated plus FasL inhibited (using 3E1 and 4G11<br>
antibodies), or (4) hFasL stimulated plus caspase 3 inhibited. These cells are analyzed<br>
according to two assays: (a) lactate dehydrogenase analysis, and (b) caspase 3/8 analysis,<br>
exemplified as Example 6a and 6b, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase release from<br>
cells indicates cell death by any method. Release of caspases 3 and/or 8 from cells<br>
indicates Fas-FasL-mediated apoptosis.<br>
Example 6a: Lactate Dehydrogenase Analysis<br>
Lactate Dehydrogenase LD-L20 reagent (Sigma Chemical, Catalog # 228-20) is a<br>
mixture of lactate and NAD used for the quantitative, kinetic determination of lactate<br>
dehydrogenase activity. Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of lactate to<br>
pyruvate with simultaneous reduction of NAD. Formation of NADH results in an<br>
increase in absorbance at X 340 nm. The rate of increase in absorbance at X 340 nm is<br>
directly proportional to LD activity in the sample.<br>
In a 96-well plate, 10 µl of sample in cell culture media are mixed with 200 µl of<br>
preheated LD-L Reagent. The plate is placed into a 37°C plate reader for a 60 second<br>
incubation period, reading the absorbance at X 340 nm at three time points: 0, 30, and 60<br>
seconds. The initial absorbance reading (time point 0 seconds) is subtracted from the<br>
final absorbance reading (time point 60 seconds) to obtain A absorbance/minute. The<br>
A absorbance/minute is converted to LD activity (U/L) according to a calculation<br>
provided by the reagent supplier. Results indicate that the presence of antibody greatly<br>
reduces the release of lactate dehydrogenase from the cells, signifying a decrease in cell<br>
death.<br>
Example 6b: Caspase 3/8 Analysis<br>
The ApoAlert Caspase Fluorescent Assay Kit (Clontech, Catalog # K2026-2) is<br>
used to detect the activity of specific caspases (3, 8, or 9/6), which becomes active at<br>
different stages of the apoptotic process. 7-amino-4-trifluorornethyl coumarin (AFC),<br>
conjugated to a substrate, is proteolytically cleaved by the appropriate caspase in the<br>
sample, and free AFC fluoresces at A. 505 ran.<br>
In a 96-well black plate, 50 uL of cell lysate are mixed with 50 µl of reaction<br>
buffer and 5 µl of caspase-3 or caspase-8 substrate. The mixture is incubated at 37°C for<br>
one hour, and read in a fluorescence plate reader at X 400 run excitation/X 505 nm<br>
emission. Emissions from apoptotic samples are compared to uninduced and inhibited<br>
controls, allowing determination of the increase in protease activity. Results indicate that<br>
caspase 3/8 activation is completely inhibited in samples containing FasL plus anti-hFasL<br>
antibody.<br>
Example 7: Functional Activity Using Jurkat Cells With Up-Regulated Native FasL<br>
Stimulation of Jurkat T cells with an immobilized antibody to the T cell receptor<br>
CD3 complex induces cellular activation and up-regulation of native FasL. Activation-<br>
induced cell death then occurs, which can be directly measured by assessing cell survival<br>
or active caspase 3 activity. This system was used to determine the ability of anti-FasL<br>
antibody (3E1 was used although it is contemplated that 4G11 or other antibodies of the<br>
invention may be used) to block cell death.<br>
Non-tissue culture-treated, 96-well flat-bottomed plates were coated with anti-<br>
human CD3 antibody (50 µl/well, 1 µg/ml in PBS) at 4°C overnight. Plates were then<br>
washed with PBS to remove non-bound antibody. Jurkat T cells were added to the wells<br>
(50,000 cells/well) alone or together with inhibitor (Antibody 3E1) or a control IgG4, at<br>
various concentrations (5 ng/ml to 5 ng/ml in a final volume of 100 µl in Jurkat assay<br>
media), and incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. WST-1 reagent<br>
(available, e.g., from Panvera) was then added (10 µl/well) and plates incubated for an<br>
additional 24 hours. Plates were read on a spectrophotometric plate reader at 450 nm.<br>
WST-1 is used to measure the number of viable cells. Results indicated that the anti-<br>
hFasL antibodies used in the assay were effective in neutralizing native FasL-mediated<br>
apoptosis in this assay.<br>
Alternatively, 24 well plates (non-tissue culture) were coated with the anti-CD3<br>
antibody as described above. Jurkat T cells were then added (200,000 cells/well) alone or<br>
together with the inhibitor or control antibody (final volume of 400 µ1) and incubated for<br>
24 or 48 hours at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were then harvested and washed.<br>
Cells were permeabilized (Cytoperm/Cytofix, Pharmingen #554722) and stained with an<br>
anti-active caspase 3-FITC antibody (Pharmingen #559341), and cell staining assessed on<br>
a flow cytorneter. Results indicated that the anti-hFasL antibodies were effective at<br>
inhibiting caspase 3 activation (caspase 3 activity leads to cellular apoptosis).<br>
Example 8: Anti-FasL Antibodies Inhibit Apoptosis of HIV-infected Human T Cells<br>
Peripheral blood T cells are usually quiescent, until an immune response is<br>
stimulated. However, peripheral T cells of HIV-infected patients display an activated<br>
phenotype, which includes up-regulation of surface Fas and induction of FasL. It is<br>
contemplated that this surface Fas-FasL interaction is responsible for loss of many of the<br>
peripheral, non-HIV infected T cells, via apoptosis. To investigate whether anti-FasL<br>
antibodies could block this cell death, the following experiment was performed.<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were purified from whole blood of<br>
HIV-infected patients using Ficoll-Hypaque. Cells were added to 24 well plates at<br>
700,000 cells/well in media alone or together with PHA (5 µg/ml) and recombinant IL-2<br>
(50 U/ml), which further activate the cells. The cells were incubated with or without the<br>
anti-FasL antibodies (2 µg/ml to 200 ng/ml in a final volume of 500 µl). Plates were<br>
incubated for 24 hours or 72 hours at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were then<br>
harvested, washed, and incubated with anti-CD4-PE antibody. The cells were then<br>
washed again, permeabilized and stained with an anti-active caspase 3-FITC antibody and<br>
cell staining assessed on a flow cytorneter. Results indicated that the anti-hFasL<br>
antibodies were effective at reducing the activation of caspase 3, and therefore apoptosis,<br>
in both the CD4 positive and CD4 negative peripheral blood lymphocytes.<br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
