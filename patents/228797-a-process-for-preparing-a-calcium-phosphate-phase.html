				<td>A PROCESS FOR PREPARING A CALCIUM PHOSPHATE PHASE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to novel room-temperature process for obtaining<br>
calcium phosphate, in particular hydroxyapatite, microspheres and coatings with<br>
encapsulated drugs', proteins, genes, DNA for therapeutical use. The coatings and<br>
microspheres are designed to perform a defined biological function related to drug<br>
delivery, such as gene therapy through gene delivery. A novel method for encapsula-<br>
tion, and subsequent controlled release of therapeutically active agents from such<br>
biofunctional coatings and microspheres is disclosed. Such coatings and<br>
microspheres are useful for side effects - free, long-term, targeted, controlled release<br>
and delivery of drugs, proteins, DNA., and other therapeutic agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rapid progress in the human genome project promises that diseases that could<br>
not be treated before can be curable in near future. The expectation is that the trial-<br>
and-error era of fighting illnesses by addressing the symptoms is coming to an end.<br>
Consequently, the issue of drug and gene release control becomes increasingly critical.<br>
Currently, many types of new drugs, or genes, have to be administered by daily<br>
injections, or even several times per clay. An entirely new approach to drug delivery is<br>
therefore necessary to fully utilize the advantages of new drugs resulting from the<br>
genome project. Slow but steady release of drugs is sought in treatment of many<br>
diseases, from cancer and Parkinson's disease, to hormonal treatment of obesity where<br>
directly administered hormones reside in human body only for short period of time. In<br>
the past, polymeric materials have been used for drug delivery control and enjoyed<br>
substantial clinical success for certain drug systems. The need for alternative inor-<br>
ganic drug delivery systems, offering more flexibility in drug-carrier system selection,<br>
bioresorption and release control, hydrophobic / hydrophilic property control, and<br>
negligible side effects, is just emerging. Hydroxyapatite (HA) matrix for drug encap-<br>
sulation, being already the principal ir organic component of bone, offers entirely new<br>
perspectives for drug delivery systems.<br>
Hydroxyapatite Ceramics, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, belong to a large class of<br>
calcium phosphate (CaP) based bioact.ve materials used for a variety of biomedical<br>
applications, including matrices for drug release control [M. Itokazu et al<br>
Biomaterials, 19,817-819,1998; F. Mir.guezetat Drugs Exp. Clin. Res., 16[5], 231-<br><br>
235,1990; W. Paul and C. P. Sharma, J. Mater. Sci. Mater. Med., 10,383-388,1999].<br>
Other members of the CaP family, such as dicalcium phosphate CaHPO42H2O or<br>
tricalcium phosphate Ca3(PO4)2, have also been used for similar purposes. The CaP<br>
family of materials has been long recognized as having highest degree of<br>
biocompatibility with human tissue.<br>
Calcium Phosphate Cements (CPC) were reported in a binary system<br>
containing tetracalcium phosphate (T2CP) and dicalcium phosphate anhydrate<br>
(DCPA) [L.C. Chow etal. J. Dent Res., 63,200,1984]. The CPC advantages of self-<br>
setting and apatitic phase, e.g. HA, as an end product led to applications such as bone<br>
replacements and reconstruction, and also drug delivery [M.Dairra, et al. Biomaterials,<br>
19 1523-1527,1998; M. Otsuka, et al. J. of Controlled Release 43(1997)115-122,<br>
1997; Y. Tabata, PSTT, Vol.3, No.3, 80-89,2000; M. Otsuka, et al. J. of Pharm. Sci.<br>
Vol.83, No.5, 1994]. CPC is typically formulated as a mixture of solid and liquid<br>
components in pertinent proportions, which react to form the apatite. The<br>
physicochemical reactions that occur upon mixing of the solid and liquid components<br>
are complex, but dissolution and precipitation are the primarily mechanisms responsi-<br>
ble for the final apatite formation [C. Hamanish et al J. Biomed. Mat. Res., Vol.32,<br>
383-389,1996; E. Ferandez et al J. Matra. ScLMed. 10,223-230,1999]. The<br>
reaction pathway in most CPC systems does not lead to stoichiometric HA, but rather<br>
calcium-deficient Ca10-x(HPO4)x(PO4)6-x(OH)2-x, similar to that found in bone. The<br>
process parameters, such as Ca/P ratio, powder/liquid ratio, seeds concentration and<br>
type, nature of reagents, control the final properties, such as phase content, porosity,<br>
strength, setting time, phase transformation kinetics, and microstructure of CPC-<br>
derived hydroxyapatite (CPC-HA). Bermudez et al [J. Mat. Sci. Med. 4, 503-<br>
508, 1993; ibid 5,67-71,1994] correlated the compressive strength of CPC vs starting<br>
Ca/P ratio in the systems of monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (MCPM) and<br>
calcium oxide. The optimum Ca/P ratio was found in a range of 1.25 - 1.45. Brown et<br>
al. [J. Am. Cerm. Soc. 74[5] 934-40,1991] found that the kinetics of HA formation at<br>
low temperatures in DCP / TTCP system are initially controlled by the surface area of<br>
the reactants, and eventually by diffusion. These process variables will be used in the<br>
present project to control crystallinity, and thus resorption and drug release rate from<br>
the HA microspheres.<br>
Biomimeric Deposition of HA films at room temperature (BM-HA) was used<br>
for a variety of biomedical applications, including drug delivery [H. B. Wen et al, J,<br>
Biomed. Mater. Res., 41,227-36,1998; S. Lin and A. A. Campbell, US Pat 5958430,<br><br>
1999; D. M. Liu et al J. Mater. Sci. Mater. Med., 5,147-153,1994; K. de Groot et al,<br>
J. Biomed. Mater. Res., 21,1375-1381,1987]. This forming mechanism is driven by<br>
supersaturation of Ca2+ and PO43- under appropriate solution pH, where HA is the<br>
most stable phase. The apatitic crystals form through nucleation and growth, and may<br>
incorporate biologically active species, such as antibiotics, anti-cancer drugs, anti-<br>
inflammatory agents, etc. The deposition rates are however small for BM-HA,<br>
generally in the range of 0.05-0.5µm/h, and high concentration dosage of drug is<br>
difficult to achieve. Therefore, stand-alone BM-HA is not suitable if the goal is to<br>
form films in excess of 1µm, but may be appropriate as an additional encapsulating<br>
film, on top of the porous HA structure saturated with the drug material. This is<br>
especially critical for orthopedics where high concentration of antibiotics is required<br>
at bone-HA interface to prevent acute inflammation in early after-operation stages.<br>
Furthermore, the physiological solutions for BM-HA formation are naturally water-<br>
based, which makes impossible to encapsulate hydrophobic bioactive agents into BM-<br>
HA coatings.<br>
Sol-Gel Deposition of HA (.5G-HA) films at elevated temperatures (375-<br>
500C) was disclosed previously by D. Liu and T. Troczynski in U.S. patent applica-<br>
tion Serial No. 09/563,231, filed May 2,2000, the subject matter of which is incorpo-<br>
rated herein by reference. Sol-gel (SG) processing of HA allows molecular-level<br>
mixing of the calcium and phosphor precursors, which improves chemical homogene-<br>
ity of the resulting calcium phosphate. The versatility of the SG method opens an<br>
opportunity to form thin film coatings in a simple, mild, relatively low-temperature<br>
process. The crystallinity of the calcium phosphate phase obtained through the novel<br>
inventive process by D. Liu and T. Troczynski can be enhanced by appropriate use of<br>
water treatment during processing. Variation of Ca/P ratio in the sol-gel precursor mix<br>
allows one to obtain other than calcium phosphate phases, for example,<br>
hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate or tetracalcium phosphate.<br>
The use of SG-HA thin (
thick (&gt;10 µm) CPC-HA porous, low-crystallinity (amorphous) films for drug<br>
encapsulation and release is hereby disclosed.<br>
Problems With Drug Delivety in Vivo are related to toxicity of the carrier<br>
agent, the generally low loading capacity for drugs as well as the aim to control drug<br>
delivery resulting in self-regulated, timed release. With the exception of colloidal<br>
carrier systems, which support relatively high loading capacity for drugs, most<br>
systems deliver inadequate levels of bioactive drugs. In terms of gene delivery, to date<br><br>
the most efficient, though least safe methods of delivery are through viral mediated<br>
gene transfer. It is highly inefficient method, and is faced with even greater problems<br>
than the delivery of drugs due to the hydrophilic and labile nature DNA oligos. The<br>
problems with delivery of genes or ant sense oligos originate from the rapid clearance<br>
of plasmid DNA or oligos by hepatic and renal uptake as well as the degradation of<br>
DNA by serum nucleases [Takura Y, et al. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 13 (2001) 71-76].<br>
These effects have been observed for both in situ and intravenous delivery. For<br>
example it was estimated that more than half of the intravenous or in situ delivered<br>
naked plasmid DNA was cleared from the tumor site within the first two hours<br>
following intratumoral injection [Ohkouchi, K., et al Cancer Res. 50, (1996)<br>
1640-1644 and Imoto, H., et al. Cancer Res. 52, (1992)., 4396-4401]. Even after<br>
clearance, only a small percentage of the remaining DNA or oligos make their way to<br>
• the cytoplasm or nucleus of the target cell. The membrane permeability of naked DNA<br>
and especially oligos is virtually nonexistent, due to their polyanionic nature. For this<br>
reason, their uptake through the endosoraal compartment is associated with a severe<br>
drop in pH and degradation. Finally, maoy of the genes delivered have to be trans-<br>
ported and sometimes incorporated in the genome of the target cell for stable expres-<br>
sion. This makes very difficult gene transfer in vivo. In addition, successful con-<br>
trolled release is still problematic as for most applications (with the exception of<br>
naked DNA vaccines) it is desirable to have a prolonged expression of the gene of<br>
interest to ameliorate a particular medical condition. In most applications anywhere<br>
from a few weeks to several months are desired for the expression of a certain gene<br>
product.<br>
Drug Encapsulation in HA has oeen achieved in the past by simple post-<br>
impregnation of a sintered, porous HA ceramic [K. Yamamura et al, J. Biomed.<br>
Mater. Res., 26,1053-64,1992]. In this process, the drug molecules simply adsorb<br>
onto surface of the porous ceramic. The drug release is accomplished through<br>
desorption and leaching and the drug to tne surrounding tissue after exposure to<br>
physiological fluid. Unfortunately, most of the adsorbed drug molecules release from<br>
such system in a relatively short period of time. Impregnation of drug material into<br>
porous sintered calcium phosphate microspheres has been reported in patent literature.<br>
"Slow release" porous granules are claimed in US Pat. 5,055,307 [S. Tsuru et al,<br>
1991], wherein the granule is sintered at 200-1400C and the drug component impreg-<br>
nated into its porosity. "Calcium phosphate microcarriers and microspheres" are<br>
claimed in WO 98/43558 by B. Starling et al [1998], wherein hollow microspheres are<br>
sintered and impregnated with drugs for slow release. D. Lee et al claim poorly<br><br>
crystalline apatite [W098/16268] wherein macro-shapes harden and may simulta-<br>
neously encapsulate drug materfcJ for slow release. It has been suggested to use<br>
porous, composite HA as a carrier for gentamicin sulfate (GS), an aminoglycoside<br>
antibiotic to treat bacterial infections at infected osseous sites [J. M. Rogers-Foy et al,<br>
J. Inv. Surgery 12 (1997) 263 -275]. The presence of proteins in HA coatings did not<br>
affect the dissolution properties of either calcium or phosphorus ions and that it was<br>
solely dependent on the media [Binder S. A. et al. Biomaterials 21 (2000) 299-305].<br>
The group of Kobe University lead by Prof. M. Otsuka performed series of<br>
investigations of drug encapsulation in self-setting calcium phosphate cements<br>
derived from tetracalcium phosphate and dicalcium phosphate [J. Contr. Rel. 43 115-<br>
122 1997; ibid 52 281-289 1998; I. Pharm. Sci. 83 611-615,259-263,255-258,<br>
1994]. The cement was shaped with in-situ drug encapsulation, into 15mm diameter<br>
macro-pellets and drug (indomethacin) release monitored over up to 3 weeks period.<br>
It was concluded that the cement-drug delivery system, shaped in-situ into surround-<br>
ing bone tissue, may be an excellent way to treat localized bone infections with high<br>
therapeutic effectiveness. The advantage of HA for drug delivery is that side effects<br>
have never been a concern for hydroxyapatite materials [Y. Shinto et al, 3. Bone Jt<br>
Surg., 74BA, 600-4,1992]. Calcium phosphate - biodegradable polymer blends were<br>
also investigated as possible vehicles for drug delivery [I. Soriano and C. Evora, J.<br>
Contr. Rel. 68 121-134 2000], Prolonged drug release (up to 10 weeks) was obtained<br>
for the composites coated with hydrophobic polymer coatings. A group from Univer-<br>
sity of Pennsylvania [Q. Qiu et al J. Biomed Mat Res. 52 66-76 2000] recently<br>
processed polymer-bioactive glass-ceramic composite microspheres for drug delivery.<br>
Porous calcium phosphate ceramics were impregnated with bone marrow cells [E.<br>
Kon et al, J. Biomed Mat. Res. 49 3 28-337 2000] and with human bone<br>
morphogenetic protein [I. Alam et al J. Biomed Mat. Res. 52 2000],<br>
S. Takenori et al-, in U.S. Patent No. 5,993,535 (and accompanying<br>
EP0U99247), disclosed a calcium pbosphate cement comprising tetracalcium phos-<br>
phate and calcium hydrogen phosphate polysaccharide as main components. It needed<br>
24hours incubation at 37°C for conversion of hydroxyapatite. T. Sumiaki et al., in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,055,307, disclosed slow release drug delivery granules comprising<br>
porous granules of a calcium phosphate compound having a ratio of Ca to P of 1.3 to<br>
1.8, a porosity of 0.1 to 70%, a specific surface area of 0.1 to 50 m2/g and a pore size<br>
of lnm to 10 p.m. The granules were feed at a temperature of 200 to 1400°C, and a<br>
drug component impregnated in pores of the granules, and a process for producing the<br><br>
same. S. Gogolewski, in WO00/23123, disclosed the hardenable ceramic hydraulic<br>
cement comprising a drug to be delivered to the human or animal body upon degrada-<br>
tion or dissolution of the hardened cement. However, conversion of CPC to achieve<br>
HA needed 40 hours. L. Chow et al., in U.S. Patent No. 5,525,148, disclosed calcium<br>
phosphate cements, which self-harden substantially to hydroxyapatite at ambient<br>
temperature when in contact with an aqueous medium. More specifically the cements<br>
comprise a combination of calcium phosphates other than tetracalcium phosphate with<br>
an aqueous solution adjusted with a base to maintain a pH of about 12.5 or above and<br>
having sufficient dissolved phosphate salt to yield a solution mixture with phosphate<br>
concentration equal to or greater than about 0.2 rnol/L. However, major disadvantages<br>
of the processing are that high pH (&gt;12.5), which could denature most of drugs,<br>
proteins and DNA, so the process is nc t suitable for drug encapsulation vehicles. C.<br>
Rey et al., in WO9816209, disclosed a synthetic, poorly crystalline apatite calcium<br>
phosphate containing a biologically active agent and/or cells, preferably tissue-<br>
forming or tissue-degrading cells, usef al for a variety of in vivo and in vitro applica-<br>
tions, including drug delivery, tissue growth and osseous augmentation. However, the<br>
ratio of Ca/P was limited less than 1.5, and the authors did not disclose how to<br>
fabricate the microspheres and coatings.<br>
The physical characteristics, i.e. shape, of the hydroxyapatite ceramic, also<br>
have significant impact on the tissue response. Among different possible shapes,<br>
hydroxyapatite granules facilitate not only surgical operations but also benefit the<br>
tissue growth after implantation by creating relatively large inter-granular pores<br>
allowing invasion by the host tissue. On this basis, the use of drug-containing HA<br>
granules has enhanced therapeutic effect in practical clinical/biomedical applications.<br>
While the above studies describs the dissolution of porous HA to release a<br>
soluble extracellular acting bioactive ingredient through desorption and leaching, this<br>
disclosure aims also intracellular delivery of genes, drugs or proteins using resorbing<br>
HA microcarriers. The key observation is that HA particles were found inside<br>
macrophages at the interface of HA-coated hip implants [Bauer T. W. et al. J. Bone<br>
Joint Surg. Am. 73-A (1991) 1439-1452]. Consequently it was proposed that<br>
phagocytes take up and solubilize HA particles [Evans R. W. et al. Calcif. Tissue. Int.<br>
36 (1984) 645-650]. This may be therefore one of the principal mechanisms of<br>
intracellular delivery of genes through use of HA coatings and microspheres, without<br>
the need for use viral mediated gene transfer.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
We hereby disclose a process through which hydroxyapatite can be engineered<br>
to function as an efficient vehicle for drug delivery from coatings or self-supported<br>
microspheres. The process relates to calcium phosphate (CaP), in particular<br>
hydroxyapatite (HA) microspheres and coatings capable to encapsulate any type of<br>
drug or protein which can be dispersed in organic liquids or water. The process starts<br>
with calcium phosphate cement (CPC) slurry, followed by incubation to precipitate<br>
HA phase within the microsphere or within the coating. By adding drugs and proteins<br>
into colloidal suspension (CPC slunry) of the microsphere or coating precursors, a<br>
direct, in-situ encapsulation, and subsequent controlled release of the therapeutically<br>
active agents from the apatite microspheres is achieved. The varying degree of<br>
crystallinity of the microspheres is used to control and customize their resorption<br>
process in body fluids, and thus the rate of drug release.<br>
Despite the fact that several techniques were investigated in the past in use of<br>
static macro-components of CaP for drug delivery, none of them allows processing of<br>
fast setting functionally gradient cement microspheres and coatings with in-situ drug<br>
encapsulation. Consequently we disclose hereby a new, safe and inexpensive way to<br>
deliver drugs, proteins, genes and antisense oligos in vivo. In this process calcium<br>
phosphate coatings and microspheres are obtained through dissolution-precipitation<br>
mechanism similar to setting of calcium phosphate cements (CPC). This process is<br>
used for deposition of adhesive, thick (typically of 10-1000 urn thickness) HA films<br>
and for making HA microspheres (typically of 10-1000 µm diameter).<br>
Calcium phosphate cements, like most other cements (e.g. Portland cement)<br>
release heat of hydration when hydrating and setting. When setting fast (which is an<br>
important requirement in certain applications), this heat may not dissipate fast enough<br>
and temperature of cemented area increases, sometimes to a level high enough to<br>
damage, e.g. crack, the cement More importantly, if the cement is applied in human<br>
body, e.g. as part of an implant, this lemperature increase may damage the surround-<br>
ing biological constituents such as cells, proteins, and enzymes when the heat is<br>
rapidly dissipated upon setting. The novel cement system disclosed here, experiences<br>
a relatively mild temperature rise during setting, i.e. from room temperature, ~20°C, to<br>
a maximum near body temperature, ~ 37°C. This cement also exhibits excellent<br>
mechanical properties. For example,. ts compressive strength is generally greater than<br>
10 MPa, and in certain compositions, &gt; 30 MPa.<br><br>
This CPC slurry is a mixture of acidic calcium phosphates, such as<br>
monocalcium phosphate (MCP) anhydrate or dihydrate, and basic calcium hydroxide,<br>
together with a small amount of other inorganic ingredients, such as apatite seeds.<br>
This mixture is thoroughly mixed, e.g. using ball milling. The mixture, which is<br>
suspended in an inert liquid medium (e.g. alcohols) or a liquid mixture of the inert<br>
medium and a small amount of phosphating liquid, has a starting Ca/P ratio in the<br>
range of 1.2 - 1.67 and a solid concentration of 30-70 vol%, before the shaping<br>
process is being carried out (i.e. filling the cavity with the cement or shaping a drug-<br>
impregnated microsphere). The shaping procedures can be optimized upon control of<br>
the setting time within 2-40 minutes.<br>
The resulting cement exhibits an apatitic phase (HA) with either an acicular<br>
grain or plate-like grain morphology, depending upon processing parameters. A nano-<br>
structured cement can also be synthesized and is used particularly for encapsulating<br>
drugs, antibiotics, proteins, and erzymes. The apatite phase develops within 1 - 6 h of<br>
incubation within the CPC sy stent, disclosed. Fast formation of the apatite phase is<br>
advantageous for an early biological response with the surrounding host tissue. A fast<br>
setting (2-40 mm) and hardening time (less than 6 hours) benefits enormously clinical<br>
applications of the cement. Controllable crystallinity, from amorphous (easily<br>
resorbable) to highly crystalline (i.e. stable in physiological environment), of the final<br>
apatitic structure allows application-oriented customization of the cement. Fine<br>
(nano-to-submicron) starting ingredients allow final microstructure to be well<br>
controlled, allowing high strength of the final body. Nano-structure of the novel CPC<br>
offers great advantage for encapsulating drugs, as well as for their controlled release.<br>
Apatite microspheres can be easily fabricated using the novel CPC formulation, with<br>
size ranging from 10-1000 microns, using simple spray-drying equipment. Control of<br>
the setting and hardening process of the cement microspheres allows a variety of<br>
biomedical or clinical applications, e.g., injection-packing, and in-situ hardening for<br>
repair, restoration, augmentation of defective tissues, and many others.<br>
The disclosed process can be utilized to synthesize HA ceramics of different<br>
physical forms, at room temperatures. The following applications are targeted:<br>
granules or bulk shapes for artficial bone filler / bone reconstruction; room-tempera-<br>
ture processed coatings (on Ti and other alloys), with drug incorporation; or-<br>
ganic/inorganic composites, including HA in combination with other materials such as<br>
biopolymers and ceramics, and proteins to form nano- and bio-composites with<br>
controlled drug release function and / or bone growth control functions.<br><br>
We disclose here a novel approach to achieve a multi-layer, functionally<br>
gradient HA coatings or microspheres. That is, several layers of HA coatings are<br>
deposited using different techniques, with different functions assigned to any particu-<br>
lar layer. In particular, we describe an in-situ drug encapsulation within the function-<br>
ally gradient HA coatings processed by combining elevated-temperature sol-gel<br>
processing with room-temperature precipitation processing. As a result of this<br>
protocol, a 10-30 um thick, nano-to-submicron porous HA matrix, firmly attached to a<br>
metallic substrate through a 0.6-0.8 µm thin intermediate HA film is achieved. The<br>
thin sol-gel HA film (SG-HA) develops good bond with the underlaying substrate at<br>
the 400C processing temperature, and acts as an intermediate nucleation/bonding layer<br>
between the underlying substrate and the HA thick film matrix. The CPC-HA thick<br>
film matrix is deposited at room-temperature on the thin SG-HA film by dip coating<br>
in non-aqueous suspension of monocalcium phosphate and calcium hydroxide<br>
precursor powders. The drug material is dispersed in the suspension and initially<br>
deposited within the pores of the precursor powder film. Subsequently, a porous thick<br>
film apatite is formed under physic logical environment, through dissolution-precipita-<br>
tion process. The thin SG-HA film acts as a seeding template allowing nucleation and<br>
growth of the thick film apatite crystals, and therefore imparts sufficient interfacial<br>
strength to the HA matrix. This room-temperature coating process, associated with an<br>
in-situ encapsulation of drugs, can be applied onto variety of metallic or non-metallic<br>
substrates, providing potential advantages in various biomedical/biochemical applica-<br>
tions.<br>
The microspheres are self-supporting granules produced through spray-drying<br>
and incubation process of CPC-HA precursors slurry, using sythesis routes and<br>
chemistry much the same as for the coatings. Further details of the invention are<br>
provided below.<br>
A room-temperature process for deposition of adhesive, thick hydroxyapatite<br>
films on metallic substrates through dissolution-precipitation mechanism similar to<br>
setting of calcium phosphate cements (CPC) is disclosed. Such nanoporous, semi-<br>
amorphous 10-1000 µm thick film is rapidly grown on the underlying crystalline thin<br>
film of hydroxyapatite deposited through sol-gel process. A direct, in-situ encapsula-<br>
tion, and subsequent controlled release of therapeutically active agents from the<br>
apatite coatings has been achieved. Slight modification of similar process leads to<br>
formation of medicated HA microspheres of 10-1000 µm diameter. Both the coatings<br><br>
and microspheres are designated for side-effects free, long-term, targeted, controlled<br>
release and delivery of drugs, proteins, DNA, and others.<br>
The invention is directed to a process for preparing a calcium phosphate phase<br>
which comprises: (a) dispersing a homogenization of monocalcium phosphate<br>
Ca(H2PO4)2 and calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 precursors in a substantially water-free<br>
medium to form a paste or viscous slurry of precursors; (b) drying the precursors<br>
slurry ; (c) admixing a water-based solution of phosphate ions in the slurry to produce<br>
a mixture; and (d) incubating the resulting mixture in a humid environment at a<br>
temperature of 20-50°C to dissolve the precursors and precipitate a calcium phosphate<br>
phase.<br>
The calcium phosphate phase can be hydroxyapatite. The Ca/P atomic ratio in<br>
the precursors mixture can be in the range of 1.2 - 1.67 and the mixture can have a<br>
solids concentration of 30-70 vol%. Tht; substantially water-free medium can be an<br>
alcohol. The alcohol can be ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol or propyl alcohol The<br>
water-based solution of phosphate ions can be sodium phosphate and the humid<br>
environment can be 50% to 100% Relative Humidity.<br>
The precursors slurry can be dried in a prescribed shape. The shape can be a<br>
pellet, a coating, a microsphere, or a dental cavity or bone cavity fill. A crystalline<br>
hydroxyapatite powder can be added to the precursors slurry to promote crystallization<br>
of hydroxyapatite calcium phosphate phase during the incubation period. A therapeu-<br>
tically active material can be added to the precursors slurry for encapsulation during<br>
crystallization of the hydroxyapatite calcium phosphate phase during the incubation<br>
period. The therapeutically active material can be a drug, a protein, a gene or DNA.<br>
The slurry of precursors can be deposited and dried on the surface of a calcium<br>
phosphate substrate. The calcium phospoate substrate can be a thin film of<br>
hydroxyapatite coating deposited on a metallic substrate using sol-gel process. The<br>
precipitated calcium phosphate phase can be exposed to a solution supersaturated with<br>
Ca2+ and PO43-ions to provide a coating of biomimetic hydroxyapatite film on the<br>
precipitated calcium phosphate phase.<br>
The slurry of precursors can be atomized and spray-dried to obtain<br>
microspheres of the precursors. The microspheres of the precursors can be exposed to<br>
a water-based solution of phosphate ions and incubated in a humid environment at a<br><br>
temperature of 20-50°C to promote dissolution of the precursors and precipitation of<br>
calcium phosphate phase. The microsphere containing the precipitated calcium<br>
phosphate phase can be exposed tc a solution supersaturated with Ca2+ and PO43-ions<br>
to provide a coating of biomimetic hydroxyapatite film on the precipitated calcium<br>
phosphate phase. The precipitatec calcium phosphate phase can be exposed to a<br>
solution polymer to form a polymer film on the microsphere surface.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In order to produce the thick HA films for drug encapsulation, surface of the<br>
underlying substrate (typically stainless steel or titanium) is first coated with thin,<br>
submicrometer film of sol-gel HA, as disclosed previously in U.S. patent application<br>
Serial No. 09/563,231, filed May 2,2000, the subject matter of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference. The thin sol-gel 11A film (SG-HA) develops good bond with the<br>
underlying substrate at the 400°C processing temperature, and acts as an intermediate<br>
nucleation and bonding layer between the underlying substrate and the CPC-HA thick<br>
film matrix. The CPC-HA thick film matrix is deposited at room-temperature on the<br>
thin SG-HA film by dip coating in non-aqueous suspension of monocalcium phos-<br>
phate and calcium hydroxide precursoi powders. The drug material is dispersed in the<br>
suspension and initially deposited within the pores of the precursor powder film.<br>
Subsequently, the precursor powders film, containing drug material, is exposed to<br>
water-based solution of sodium phosphate and placed in an incubator at 37°C, 100%<br>
relative humidity, for up to 24 h. During this period, a porous thick HA film forms<br>
due to dissolution of the precursor powders and re-precipitation of apatite phase<br>
encapsulating the drug material. The thin SG-HA film acts as a seeding template<br>
allowing nucleation and growth of the thick film apatite crystals, and therefore imparts<br>
sufficient interfacial strength to the HA matrix. As a result of this protocol, a 10-1000<br>
urn thick, nano-to-submicron porous CPC-HA matrix encapsulating the drug material,<br>
firmly attached to a substrate through a 0.6-0.8 ym thin intermediate SG-HA film is<br>
achieved. Figure 1 illustrates CPC-HA coating on metallic substrates (a) without SG-<br>
HA coating interiayer and (b) with SG-HA coating. Absence of the SG-HA coating<br>
interlayer causes spontaneous separation of CPC-HA coating from the substrate.<br>
Figure 2 shows cross-sectional view of the CPC-HA/SG-HA coating system (a) and<br>
its FTIR spectrum (b) compared with co nmercial crystalline hydroxyapatite. An<br>
excellent, intimate interface between the two films of CPC-HA/SG-HA coating<br>
system confirms that SG-HA acts as a nucleation site for CPC-HA.<br><br>
In order to produce the HA microspheres for drug encapsulation, the non-<br>
aqueous suspension of CPC precursor powders (monocalcium phosphate and calcium<br>
hydroxide), together with fine crystalline HA additive seeds, is atomized and spray<br>
dried to produce 10-1000 um large approximately spherical particles (Figure 3a, and<br>
Stage 1 in the schematic Figure 3). The drug material is dispersed in the suspension<br>
and initially deposited within the pores of the precursor powder microspheres.<br>
Subsequently, the precursor powdfc-s microspheres, containing drug material, are<br>
exposed to water-based solution of sodium phosphate and placed in an incubator at<br>
37°C, 100% relative humidity, for up to 24 h (Stage 2). During this period, a porous<br>
HA microsphere forms due to dissolution of the precursor powders and re-precipita-<br>
tion of apatite phase encapsulating the drug material, Stage 3. The fine crystalline HA<br>
additive particles act as seeds allowing nucleation and growth of the apatite crystals.<br>
As a result of this protocol, a 10-1000 p.m large, nano-to-submicron porous CPC-HA<br>
microspheres matrix encapsulating tie drug material is achieved. In the last Stage 4 of<br>
the process (Fig. 3), a thin film of BM-HA may be deposited on the microsphere<br>
surface for additional encapsulation- Figure 4 is SEM micrograph of two CPC-HA<br>
microspheres, -20 um large (a) and -300 um large (b), produced according to the<br>
above process (BM-HA is not present on these microspheres). By changing the<br>
content of HA seeds in the microsphires, crystallinity (and thus resorption rate in<br>
physiological environment) of the resulting CPC-HA may be varied. This is illus-<br>
trated in Figure 5, showing microcrystalline (a) and amorphous (b) structure of CPC-<br>
HA (these are confirmed by XRD and FTIR data).<br>
The coatings and microspheres are processed such as to encapsulate secondary<br>
materials within the open and closed Porosity of HA, the secondary material being<br>
preferably for therapeutical use, such as drugs, proteins, genes, DNA and the like. We<br>
have demonstrated that a direct, in-situ encapsulation, and subsequent controlled<br>
release of therapeutically active agent? from such apatite coatings and microspheres<br>
can be achieved. Both the coatings and microspheres are designated for side-effects<br>
free, long-term, targeted, controlled release and delivery of drugs, proteins, DNA, and<br>
others. The disclosed process addresses the issue of drug delivery through encapsula-<br>
tion (entrapment within the structure) rather than impregnation of drugs into HA<br>
matrix. Thus, the drug release is linked to resorption of the HA matrix, rather than<br>
leaching from the matrix. Materials process engineering has been developed to<br>
control structure of HA for drug encapsulation, and therefore to control the HA<br>
resorption and drug or gene delivery process. The bio-resorbable HA for drugs<br>
encapsulation is designed and processed to release the drug as a result of gradual<br><br>
resorption of the matrix, rather than leaching of the drug from open porosity of the<br>
matrix. The additional BM-HA encapsulation film grown on SG-HA coated substrate<br>
is shown in SEM micrographs in Figure 6. The biomimetic hydroxyapatite (BM-HA)<br>
film deposits, termed CPL here for culcium phosphate layer, are shown on SG-HA<br>
substrate of low crystallinity (a) and lugh crystallinity (b).<br>
In the specification and the claims, it is understood that when appropriate, the<br>
term "calcium phosphate" (CaP) is used generically and includes minerals such as<br>
hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, Dicalcium phosphate and tetracalcium phos-<br>
phate.<br>
We disclose multilayer biocompatible / bioactive functionally graded calcium<br>
phosphate in two forms: (i) coatings or variety of substrates, typically stainless steel<br>
or titanium, and (ii) self-supporting microspheres. Two types of coatings are depos-<br>
ited. The first coating directly on the metal surface is a thin film (0.2-0.5 µm) of<br>
dense, highly crystalline HA produced ihrough sol-gel technology at elevated temper-<br>
atures, about 400C. This coating serves several purposes: (i) to screen the metal<br>
surface from the surrounding tissue; (ii) to provide high-adhesion and nucleation<br>
surface for the second CPC-HA coating The second coating is thicker, porous, film<br>
(10-1000 nm) of HA processed at room temperature. The goal is to achieve rapid<br>
formation of an adhesive apatite layer through dissolution-precipitation mechanism<br>
similar to setting of calcium phosphate cements (CPC). By adding drugs with various<br>
concentrations into the CPC colloidal suspension, a direct, in-situ encapsulation, and<br>
subsequent controlled release of therapeutically active agents from the apatite coatings<br>
is achieved. The varying degree of crystallinity of the coating and multi-step coat-<br>
ing/impregnation techniques is used to control and customize the CPC-HA resorption<br>
process, and thus the rate of drug release from the CPC-HA matrix. Interfacial<br>
examination (Figure 2a) shows that the CPC-HA coating is in intimate contact with<br>
the underlying SG-HA thin layer. The key feature of the present invention is there-<br>
fore that the pre-coated thin SG-HA film acts as a template for the nucleation and<br>
growth of room-temperature precipitated apatite in the CPC-HA coating. Such<br>
mechanism allows a significant interfacial bonding to develop between the thin SG-<br>
HA and the thick CPC-HA, as observed.<br>
FTTR spectra of the resulting CPC -HA, Figure 2b, suggest disorder of the<br>
crystal structure, attributed to poor symmetry of PO4 tetrahedra. Effectively, the<br>
resulting CPC-HA is amorphous, or very line, poorly crystalline, non-stoichiometric,<br><br>
easily resorbable apatite similar to that found in bone mineral, i.e. Ca
y(CO3)y(HPO4)x(OH)1-y/3. This CPC-HA had a porosity of about 45% and an average<br>
pore size of about 16 nm. The nanopores in the CPC-HA physically immobilize<br>
encapsulated biomolecules of similar dimension, such that dissolution of the CPC-HA<br>
matrix is responsible for the release kinerics (rather than simply desorption and<br>
leaching, as disclosed in previous art). This offers additional mode of drug / gene<br>
release control, e.g. through adjustment of the resorption rate (i.e. adjustment of<br>
crystallinity) of the CPC-HA microspheres or coatings.<br>
We also disclose here the newly discovered approach to achieve the active<br>
CaP microsphere, capable to encapsulate any type of drug or biomolecule which can<br>
be dispersed in organic liquids or water. The approach combines spheroidization of<br>
calcium phosphate cement (CPC) slurry, followed by incubation to precipitate HA<br>
phase, Figure 3,4. The CPC-HA microspheres have a poorly crystalline calcium-<br>
deficient apatitic structure, similar tc that of natural (bone) apatite, and identical to<br>
that determined for the thick CPC-H\ coatings grown on SG-HA substrates. The<br>
microstructure (i.e. in particular cryscallinity and nano-porosity) of the apatite granules<br>
can be tailored by adjusting the concentration of the seeding HA sintered sub-micron<br>
powder. The greater amount of the seeds, the finer the resulting microstructure results<br>
in the matrix phase. The examples ol'microstructures of crystalline (a) and amor-<br>
phous (b) CPC-HA produced in our laboratory through changing seeding and process<br>
parameters are shown in Figure 5. The key feature of the present invention is that the<br>
microspheres are shaped at room temperature, and CPC-HA nucleated and grown also<br>
at room temperature, encapsulating the designated organic material, e.g. drug OR<br>
protein.<br>
In order to achieve better control of drug release, additional film of BM-HA<br>
will be deposited on the surface of the microspheres, as illustrated in Figure 3 (Stage<br>
4), and also Figure 6. We have demonstrated previously that excellent quality BM-<br>
HA can be grown through solution-precipitation on hydroxyapatite films. BM-HA<br>
can be grown on surface of CPC-HA microspheres for final, long term encapsulation.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: CPC-HA / SG-HA Costings on Stainless Steel<br>
Stainless steel metallic substrates (316L) were coated with a 0.6-0.8 µm thin<br>
layer of apatite (SG-HA) using the recently developed sol-gel technique. Specifi-<br><br>
cally, the sol-gel process for preparing a crystallized hydroxyapatite, comprises: (a)<br>
hydrolysing a phosphor precursor (paosphite) in a water based medium; (b) adding a<br>
calcium salt precursor to the medium after the phosphite has been hydrolysed to<br>
obtain a calcium phosphate gel such is a hydroxyapatite gel; (c) depositing the gel on<br>
the substrate through dip coating, anc (c) Reining the film to obtain crystallized<br>
hydroxyapatite, at 400°C for 20min. An inorganic colloidal slurry containing calcium<br>
phosphate precursor Ca(OH)2 and calcium phosphate salt monocaicium phosphate<br>
anhydrate, was ball milled in ethanol. The two starting inorganic ingredients had<br>
particle size 0.3-2 u-m and 0.5-4 urn, respectively. The initial Ca/P ratio in the slurry<br>
was kept at 1.5. As dissolution and precipitation are the principal mechanisms for<br>
apatite development in such system, 5wt% of submicron, crystalline hydroxyapatite<br>
powder was used as seeds for heterogeneous nuclearion of CPC-HA. The thin film<br>
SG-HA surface-modified sample was dip coated in the ethanol suspension of the<br>
precursors. After single dip coating, an approximately 30 u.m thick layer of porous<br>
precursor powder mixture developed on the substrate due to rapid evaporation of<br>
ethanol. Due to colloidal nature of the precursors slurry, the thick film develops<br>
sufficient structural integrity (i.e. strength and hardness) to accept the next processing<br>
step. In this step, the film is exposed to sodium phosphate water-based solution (0.25<br>
M), which is allowed to soak into the open pores of the film, and then placed in an<br>
incubator at 37°C, 100% relative humidity, for 24 h. During incubation, the colloidal<br>
precursors react with the phosphate liquid and precipitate HA. Microstructure of the<br>
resulting CPC-HA thick film is shown h Fig. 5a, The pull adhesion test performed on<br>
the coatings according to ASTM C-633 standard revealed adhesion strength of the<br>
thick CPC-HA film to the thin SG-HA film of 6.1±1.2 MPa (test on 6 specimens with<br>
~20 µm thick coating). This bonding strength is greater than the tensile strength of<br>
bulk CPC-HA reported in literature, which is generally 
was predominantly at the SG-HA/CPC-HA interface, indicating that the interface is<br>
the weakest link region. This CPC-HA had a porosity of about 45% and an average<br>
pore size of about 16 nm. Macrograph of the coated sample is shown in Figure 1b.<br>
Micrograph of the coating interface is illustrated in Figure 2a, and FTIR spectrum in<br>
Figure 2b.<br>
Example 2: CPC-HA Coatings on Staiuless Steel<br>
Stainless steel metallic substrates (316L) free of intermediate SG-HA film<br>
were coated with CPC-HA, as described in Example 1. During HA incubation period,<br>
the coating spontaneously separated from the substrate, as illustrated in Figure 1a.<br>
Obviously, the CPC-HA coating did not bond to the metallic substrate, i.e. bonding<br><br>
strength was zero MPa. Other properties of the coating, that is phase content and<br>
porosity, was similar to that obtained in Example 1.<br>
Example 3: BM-HA / SG-HA Coatings on Stainless Steel<br>
Stainless steel metallic substrates (316L) were coated with a 0.6-0.8 µm thin<br>
layer of apatite (SG-HA) as descr bed in Example 1. One group of samples was<br>
annealed at 400°G for 20min to achieve crystalline SG-HA(C) film and another group<br>
at 375°C for 60min to achieve amorphous SG-HA(A) film. These films were used as<br>
nucleation site for precipitation of BM-HA film. The SG-HA coated samples were<br>
immersed into "simulated body fluid" (SBF) of ionic composition (in units of mmol/1)<br>
142 Na+, 5.0 K+, 2.5 Ca2+, 1.5 Mg2,103 Cl", 25 HCO3-, 1.4 HP042-, and 0.5 SO42-. The<br>
SBF was buffered at pH 7.4 with tiis(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane and HC1. This<br>
in-vitro static deposition (i.e. the SBF was not renewed during the deposition period)<br>
at ~24°C produced good quality, dense 3-5 nm thick BM-HA film deposits on flat SG-<br>
HA substrates, as illustrated in Figixe 6. The crystalline SG-HA(C) film, Fig. 6b,<br>
coated with dense BM-HA, whereas amorphous SG-HA(A) film, Fig. 6a, coated with<br>
porous BM-HA. The properties of the underlying SG-HA surface modification film<br>
can be used to vary the properties, e.g. porosity, of the nucleated and deposited top<br>
BM-HA film.<br>
Example 4: CPC-HA / SG-HA Coatings with Encapsulated Drug<br>
Stainless steel metallic substiates (3161.) were coated with CPC-HA / SG-HA<br>
coatings as described in Example 1. In order to assess the possibility of use of CPC-<br>
HA for controlled drug release, ametnopterin (Sigma Chemicals, USA) was employed<br>
as a model drug, in an amount of 5% based on solid phase content of CPC-HA<br>
precursors. The drug was mixed with the colloidal suspension of the precursors,<br>
before dip coating was performed. All other procedures, e.g. incubation, were<br>
performed as in Example 1. During iacubation period, 20µm thick CPC-HA coating<br>
precipitated encapsulating the drug molecules within the nanopores of the crystalliz-<br>
ing HA. After encapsulation, a drug release study was conducted by immersion of the<br>
substrates into 20 ml of phosphate bulfer saline (PBS, pH=7.4) at constant ratio of<br>
(CPC coating weight)/(volume of PBS'.) of 1 mg/ml. A reference sample coated with<br>
hydrogel film was also tested for drug release kinetics. The hydrogel film was<br>
prepared by dipping the CPC-HA layer containing the drug into a polymer solution<br>
containing 3% polyvinyl alcohol. After drying, the weight gain of the -20 mg CPC-<br>
HA layer due to the additional hydrogel coating was ~0.5 mg, corresponding to the<br>
content of polymer film in the CPC-HA matrix of about 2.5%. The samples of PBS<br><br>
liquid with released drug were periodically taken out (i.e. entire liquid was emptied)<br>
and refilled with the same amount of 20 ml of PBS. The drug concentration in the<br>
supernatant was determined via an UV-Visible spectroscopy. Figure 7 illustrates the<br>
drug release kinetics for the time period of 3 days, for both types of drug-loaded CPC-<br>
HA. Although a burst effect was detected for both coatings over the initial period of<br>
about 8 h, a slower release is evident cor the sample post-coated with hydrogel. A<br>
linear relationship was obtained between the amount of drug released and (time)"2 for<br>
the release time greater than 8 h. The sustain release period for 8 to 60 h is well<br>
described by Fick's law of diffusion, the release kinetics is modified due to the<br>
presence of a post-coated thin hydrogel film, suggesting a decreased dffusivity of the<br>
drug molecules. However, the burst eifect can offer an advantage in the early period<br>
after orthopedic/dental surgeries if anti-inflammatory agents were incorporated into<br>
the implant devices to avoid acute or severe inflammatory response.<br>
Example 5: CPC-HA Microspheres<br>
An inorganic colloida slurry containing Ca(OH)2 and monocalcium phosphate<br>
anhydrate, is ball milled in ethanol, at Ca/P ratio=l .5 (this stage of the process is<br>
similar to CPC-HA coatings processing, as described in Example 1). As dissolution<br>
and precipitation are the principal mechanisms for apatite development in such<br>
system, small amount (2 wt%) of crystalline HA powder is added to the slurry as<br>
seeds for heterogeneous nucleation of HA. Microstructure, in particular nano-porosity,<br>
of the apatite granules is tailored by adjusting concentration of the seeding HA<br>
sintered sub-micron powder, in the range l-10wt%. The greater amount of the seeds,<br>
the finer the resulting microstructure of the CPC-HA matrix phase. The slurry is<br>
atomized and spray dried to produce spheres due to rapid evaporation of ethanol, as<br>
illustrated in Figure 3a. Narrow distribution of the microsphere size can be achieved<br>
by varying spray parameters (such as spray pressure; slurry viscosity and concentra-<br>
tion), with average granular size achievable in the range 10-1000 u.m diameter. Any<br>
secondary dopant, e.g. drug material, is entrapped in the pores of the sphere at this<br>
processing stage, as in Example 4, and also as schematically illustrated in Figure 3b.<br>
The colloidal nature of the precursors so) allows a relatively strong bond to develop<br>
within the flash-dried precursor microsphere, Stage 1, Fig. 3b. Subsequently, the<br>
microspheres were exposed to sodium phosphate water-based solution (0.25 M) and<br>
placed in an incubator at 37°C, 100% relative humidity for 24 h, Stage 2. A poorly<br>
crystalline, calcium-deficient apatitic structure develops within the microsphere in this<br>
process, similar to that of naturally occuning apatite, as described above for the<br>
coatings, Stage 3. A poorly crystalline, calcium-deficient apatitic structure develops<br><br>
within the microsphere in this process, similar to that of naturally occurring (i.e. bone)<br>
apatite. The mineralization process in Stage 3 can be expressed as a result of interac-<br>
tion between Ca(OH)2 and Ca(HPO4)2 in the film exposed to sodium phosphate<br>
solution:<br>
3Ca(HPO4)2 + 6 Ca(OH)2 - Ca9(PO4)5(HP04)(OH)<br>
The microstructures of the resulting small (~20 fim) and large (~300 µm)<br>
microspheres are presented in Fig. 5. In the final Stage 4 of the process illustrated in<br>
Fig. 3b, a thin, dense film of BM-FA may be deposited on surface of the porous HA<br>
macrosphere for long-term encapsulation function. To achieve this, HA-CPC spheres<br>
with drug encapsulated in its nanopores are immersed into simulated body fluid as<br>
described in Example 3.<br>
