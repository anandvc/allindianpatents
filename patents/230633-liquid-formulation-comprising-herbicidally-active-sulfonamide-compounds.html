The present invention relates to the field of formulations of crop protection agents. In particular, the invention relates to liquid formulations comprising herbicidally active compounds from the group of the ALS inhibitors (acetolactate synthetase inhibitors).<br>
In general, active compounds for crop protection are not employed in pure form. Depending on the area of use and the type of use, and on physical, chemical and biological parameters, the active compound is used as an active compound formulation in a mixture with customary auxiliaries and additives. Also known are combinations with further active compounds for widening the activity spectrum and/or for protecting crop plants (for example by safeners, antidotes).<br>
In general, formulations of active compounds for crop protection should have high chemical and physical stability, should be easy to apply and easy to use and have broad biological action combined with high selectivity.<br>
Herbicidally active compounds from the group of ALS inhibitors, such as sulfonylureas, may have high chemical reactivity and may tend to be degraded chemically, for example by hydrolysis.<br>
One possibility of formulating chemically unstable active compounds is the-preparation of solid formulations. Thus, formulations of ALS inhibitors, such as active compounds from the group of the sulfonylureas, in the form of powders, granules and tablets are known (for example in EP 764404, WO 9834482, WO 9313658). However, the processes for preparing solid formulations, for example in the form of granules and tablets, are generally complicated, in particular when auxiliaries and additives or active compounds having a low melting point are incorporated.<br>
c2/<br><br>
Moreover, solid formulations are generally more difficult to apply and less user-friendly.<br>
Liquid formulations of ALS inhibitors, such as sulfonylureas, are described, for example, in US 4599412, US 4683000, US 4671817, EP 0245058, WO 01/82693, EP 0313317, EP 0514768, EP 0163598 and EP 0514769.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide an improved formulation of crop protection agents, which formulation has high chemical and physical stability and high biological effectiveness and crop plant compatibility.<br>
This object is achieved by the specific liquid formulation of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a liquid formulation comprising<br>
a)	one or more herbicidally active compounds from the group of the ALS inhibitors,<br>
b)	one or more organic solvents, and<br>
c)	one or more inorganic salts.<br>
In addition, the liquid formulation according to the invention may optionally also comprise further components, for example:<br>
d)	one or more agrochemically active compounds different from a),<br>
e)	one or more sulfosuccinates, and/or<br>
f)	customary auxiliaries and additives.<br>
The liquid formulation according to the invention is based on organic solvents b). Here, the further components of the liquid formulation may be dissolved completely, dissolved partially and suspended partially or else be suspended completely in the organic solvents. The liquid formulation can, for example, be an emulsion concentrate (EC) or an oil suspension concentrate (OD) and is preferably an oil suspension concentrate.<br><br>
Suitable ALS inhibitors a) are, for example, compounds from the group of the imidazolinones, pyrimidinyloxypyridinecarboxylic acid derivatives, pyrimidyloxybenzoic acid derivatives or sulfonamides, such as triazolopyrimidinesulfonamides or sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones, preferably phenylsulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones, for example flucarbazone or propoxycarbazone and/or salts thereof, or sulfonylureas, preferably phenylsulfonylureas.<br>
Preferred ALS inhibitors originate from the group of the sulfonylureas, for example pyrimidinyl- or triazinylaminocarbonyl[benzene-, -pyridine-, -pyrazole-, -thiophene-and -(alkylsulfonyl)alkylamino]sulfamides. Preferred substituents on the pyrimidine ring or the triazine ring are alkoxy, alkyl, haloalkoxy, haloalkyl, halogen or dimethylamino, it being possible to combine all substituents independently of one another. Preferred substituents in the benzene, pyridine, pyrazole, thiophene or (alkylsulfonyl)alkylamino moiety are alkyl, alkoxy, halogen, such as F, CI, Br or I, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, acylamino, such as formylamino, nitro, alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl, alkoxyaminocarbonyl, haloalkoxy, haloalkyl, alkylcarbonyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkylsulfonylaminoalkyl, (alkanesulfonyl)alkylamino.

An acyl radical is preferably formyl or acyl from the group consisting of CO-R2, CS-RZ, CO-OR2, CS-OR2, CS-SR2, SOR2 and S02R2, where R2 is in each case a Ci-Cio-hydrocarbon radical, such as Ci-Ci0-alkyl or C6-Ci0-aryl, which is unsubstituted or substituted, for example by one or more substituents from the group consisting of halogen, such as F, CI, Br, I, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, hydroxyl, amino, nitro, cyano and alkylthio, or R2 is aminocarbonyl or aminosulfonyl, where the two lastmentioned radicals are unsubstituted, N-monosubstituted or N,N-disubstituted, for example by substituents from the group consisting of alkyl and aryl. Acyl is, for example, formyl, haloalkylcarbonyl, alkylcarbonyl, such as (Ci-C4)-alkyl-carbonyl, phenylcarbonyl, where the phenyl ring may be substituted, or alkyloxy-carbonyl, such as (Ci-C4)-alkyloxycarbonyl, phenyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, alkylsulfonyl, such as (C-i-C4)-alkylsulfonyl, alkylsulfinyl, such as CrC4-(alkylsulfinyl), N-alkyl-1-iminoalkyl, such as N-(Ci-C4)-1-imino-(CrC4)-alkyl, and other radicals of organic acids.<br>
A hydrocarbon radical is a straight-chain, branched or cyclic and saturated or unsaturated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical, for example alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or aryl.<br>
A hydrocarbon radical has preferably 1 to 40 carbon atoms, with preference 1 to 30 carbon atoms; with particular preference, a hydrocarbon radical is alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl having up to 12 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl having 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 ring atoms<br><br>
also alkyl and haloalkyl, and unsaturated aliphatic radicals which correspond to the saturated hydrocarbon-containing radicals mentioned, such as alkenyl, alkynyl, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, etc. Among the radicals with carbon atoms, preference is given to those having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, in particular 1 or 2 carbon atoms. Preference is generally given to substituents from the group consisting of halogen, for example fluorine and chlorine, (d-C4)-alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl, (Ci-C4)-haloalkyl, preferably trifluoromethyl, (Ci-C4)-alkoxy, preferably methoxy or ethoxy, (Ci-C4)-haloalkoxy, nitro and cyano. Particular preference is given here to the substituents methyl, methoxy and chlorine.<br>

Cycloalkyl is a carbocyclic saturated ring system having preferably 3-6 carbon atoms, for example cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl.<br>
The carbon skeleton of the carbon-containing radicals, such as alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, alkylamino and alkylthio and the corresponding unsaturated and/or substituted radicals may in each case be straight-chain or branched. In these radicals, preference is given to the lower carbon skeletons having, for example, 1 to 6 carbon atoms and, in the case of unsaturated groups, 2 to 6 carbon atoms, unless specified otherwise. Alkyl radicals, also in the composite meanings such as alkoxy, haloalkyl, etc., are, for example, methyl, ethyl, n- or isopropyl, n-, iso-, t- or2-butyl, pentyls, hexyls, such as n-hexyl, isohexyl and 1,3-dimethylbutyl, heptyls, such as n-heptyl, 1-methylhexyl and 1,4-dimethylpentyl; alkenyl and alkynyl radicals have the meaning of the possible unsaturated radicals which correspond to the alkyl radicals; alkenyl is, for example, allyl, 1-methylprop-2-en-1-yl, 2-methyl-prop-2-en-1-yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-3-en-1-yl, 1-methylbut-3-en-1-yl and 1-methylbut-2-en-1-yl; alkynyl<br><br>
is, for example, propargyl, but-2-yn-1-yl, but-3-yn-1-yl, 1-methylbut-3-yn-1-yl.<br>

If, in the context of this description, the short form of the "common name" of an active compound is used, this embraces in each case all customary derivatives, such as esters and salts, and isomers, in particular optical isomers, especially the commercially available form or forms. If the "common name" refers to an ester or a salt, this embraces in each case also all other customary derivatives, such as other esters and salts, the free acids and neutral compounds, and isomers, in particular optical isomers, especially in the commercially available form or forms. The given chemical compound names refer to at least one of the compounds embraced by the "common name", frequently to a preferred compound.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, the ALS inhibitors contained in the liquid formulations according to the invention as component a) are to be understood as including, in addition to the neutral compounds, in particular in each case also their salts with inorganic and/or organic counterions.

These salts are, for example, metal salts, in particular alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, in particular sodium salts and potassium salts, or else ammonium salts or salts with organic amines. Salts can also be formed by forming an adduct of an acid with basic groups, such as, for example, amino and alkylamino.

In the combinations mentioned above, it is also possible to combine a plurality of ALS inhibitors as component a) and to use them together for controlling harmful plants in crops of plants.<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment, it is possible to combine, as component a), for example different sulfonamides of the formula (I) and/or salts thereof, for example mesosulfuron-methyl + iodosulfuron-methyl, mesosulfuron-methyl + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, mesosulfuron-methyl + foramsulfuron, mesosulfuron-methyl + foramsulfuron-sodium , mesosulfuron-methyl-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl, mesosulfuron-methyl-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, mesosulfuron-methyl-sodium + foramsulfuron,<br><br>
mesosulfuron-methyl-sodium + foramsulfuron-sodium, foramsulfuron + iodosulfuron-methyl, foramsulfuron + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, foramsulfuron-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl, foramsulfuron-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, amidosulfuron + iodosulfuron-methyl, amidosulfuron + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, amidosulfuron-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl, amidosulfuron-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, ethoxysulfuron + iodosulfuron-methyl, ethoxysulfuron + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, ethoxysulfuron-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl, ethoxysulfuron-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, propoxycarbazone + mesosulfuron-methyl, propoxycarbazone + mesosulfuron-methyl-sodium, propoxycarbazone-sodium + mesosulfuron-methyl, propoxycarbazone-sodium + mesosulfuron-methyl-sodium, propoxycarbazone + iodosulfuron-methyl, propoxycarbazone + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, propoxycarbazone-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl, propoxycarbazone-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, flucarbazone + mesosulfuron-methyl, flucarbazone + mesosulfuron-methyl-sodium, flucarbazone-sodium + mesosulfuron-methyl, flucarbazone-sodium + mesosulfuron-methyl-sodium, flucarbazone + iodosulfuron-methyl, flucarbazone + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, flucarbazone-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl, flucarbazone-sodium + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium.<br>
The ALS inhibitors a) and their mixtures, for example the active compound mixtures mentioned above of sulfonamides of the formula (I) and/or salts thereof, can be<br><br>
combined with one or more safeners, in particular with the safeners mefenpyr-diethyl (S1-1), isoxadifen-ethyl (S1-9) and cloquintocet-mexyl (S2-1).<br>
The liquid formulations according to the invention can be prepared by known processes, for example by mixing the components. Thus, it is possible, for example, to dissolve components a) and c) and the optional components d), e) and f) in any order in the solvent b). To accelerate the dissolution processes, it is possible to operate at elevated temperatures and using external forces, for example mixers. Depending on the dissolution properties of the individual components, it may be expedient to add the components in a certain sequence.<br>
If not all components are soluble in the solvent b), preference is given to first dissolving the soluble components in solvent b) and dispersing the non-soluble components in this pre-solution. The resulting oil suspension can then be subjected to wet grinding. To produce the formulation, it may be expedient to prepare appropriate pre-suspensions which comprise only certain amounts of the individual components. The components insoluble in the solvent can, if appropriate, be subjected to dry grinding prior to incorporation into the formulation; in certain cases, it may then be possible to dispense with the wet grinding.<br>
To produce the mixtures, it is possible to use customary mixing apparatus which, if required, are thermostated. For pregrinding, it is possible to use, for example, high-pressure homogenizers or mills operating by the rotor-stator principle, such as Ultraturrax homogenizers, for example those from IKA, or toothed colloid mills, for example from Puck. For fine grinding, it is possible to use, for example, bead mills which operate batch-wise, for example from Drais, or bead mills which operate continuously, for example from Bachofen. The preparation process can be adapted to the properties of the components employed and to technical and safety requirements and to economical considerations, and pregrinding and even fine grinding may be dispensed with, if possible.<br><br>
The components a) to f) used for the preparation may comprise water as a minor component which is then also found in the liquid formulations according to the invention. Accordingly, the liquid formulations according to the invention may comprise small amounts of water, in general from 0 to 5% by weight. If water is present, this is present in dissolved form, preferably in the organic solvent; i.e. the water does not form a continuous phase.<br>
For application, the liquid formulations according to the invention may, if required, be diluted in a customary manner using, for example, water, to give, for example, emulsions, suspensions, suspoemulsions or solutions. It may be advantageous to add further agrochemically active compounds (for example tank mix components in the form of appropriate formulations) and/or auxiliaries and additives customary for application, for example self-emulsifying oils, such as vegetable oils or paraffin oils, and/or fertilizers to the spray liquors obtained. Accordingly, the present invention also provides such liquid herbicidal compositions based on the liquid formulations according to the invention.<br>
The herbicidal compositions according to the invention (which hereinbelow in each case also include the liquid formulations according to the invention) have outstanding herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of economically important monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants. Even perennial weeds which produce shoots from rhizomes, rootstocks or other perennial organs and which are difficult to control are controlled well. In this context, it does not matter whether the substances are applied before sowing, pre-emergence or post-emergence. Specific examples may be mentioned of some representatives of the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed flora which can be controlled by the herbicidal compositions according to the invention, without the enumeration being a restriction to certain species.<br>
Examples of weed species on which the herbicidal compositions act efficiently are, from amongst the monocotyledonous weed species, Apera spica venti, Avena spp., Alopecurus spp., Brachiaria spp., Digitaria spp., Lolium spp., Echinochloa spp.,<br><br>
Panicum spp., Phalaris spp., Poa spp., Setaria spp. and Bromus spp. such as Bromus catharticus, Bromus secalinus, Bromus erectus, Bromus tectorum and Bromus japonicus, and Cyperus species from the annual group, and, among the perennial species, Agropyron, Cynodon, Imperata and Sorghum and also perennial Cyperus species.<br>
In the case of the dicotyledonous weed species, the spectrum of action extends to species such as, for example, Abutilon spp., Amaranthus spp., Chenopodium spp., Chrysanthemum spp., Galium spp. such as Galium aparine, Ipomoea spp., Kochia spp., Lamium spp., Matricaria spp., Pharbitis spp., Polygonum spp., Sida spp., Sinapis spp., Solanum spp., Stellaria spp., Veronica spp. and Viola spp., Xanthium spp., among the annuals, and Convolvulus, Cirsium, Rumex and Artemisia in the case of the perennial weeds.<br>
The compositions according to the invention also act outstandingly efficiently on harmful plants which are found under the specific cultures in rice, such as, for example, Echinochloa, Sagittaria, Alisma, Eleocharis, Scirpus and Cyperus.<br>
If the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are applied to the soil surface before germination, the weed seedlings are either prevented completely from emerging or else the weeds grow until they have reached the cotyledon stage, but then their growth stops, and, eventually, after three to four weeks have elapsed, they die completely.<br>
If the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are applied post-emergence to the green parts of the plants, growth likewise stops drastically a very short time after the treatment, and the weed plants remain at the growth stage at the point of time of application, or they die completely after a certain time, so that in this manner competition by the weeds, which is harmful to the crop plants, is eliminated very early and in a sustained manner.<br>
The herbicidal compositions according to the invention are distinguished by a rapidly<br><br>
commencing and long-lasting herbicidal action. As a rule, the rainfastness of the active compounds in the herbicidal compositions according to the invention is advantageous. A particular advantage is that the dosages used in the herbicidal compositions and the effective dosages of herbicidal compounds can be adjusted to such a low level that their soil action is optimally low. This does not only allow them to be employed in sensitive crops in the first place, but groundwater contaminations are virtually avoided. The active compound combination according to the invention allows the required application rate of the active compounds to be reduced considerably.<br>
The abovementioned properties and advantages are necessary for weed control practice to keep agricultural crops free from undesired competing plants, and thus to ensure and/or increase yield levels from the qualitative and quantitative angle. These novel compositions markedly exceed the technical state of the art with a view to the properties described.<br>
While the herbicidal compositions according to the invention have an outstanding herbicidal activity against monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds, crop plants of economically important crops, for example dicotyledonous crops such as soya, cotton, oilseed rape, sugar beet, or graminaceous crops such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice or corn, are damaged only to a minor extent, if at all. This is why the present compounds are highly suitable for the selective control of undesired plant growth in plantations of agricultural crops or of ornamentals.<br>
In addition, the herbicidal compositions according to the invention have outstanding growth-regulatory properties in crop plants. They engage in the plants' metabolism in a regulatory manner and can thus be employed for provoking direct effects on plant constituents and to facilitate harvesting such as, for example, by triggering desiccation and stunted growth. Moreover, they are also suitable for the general control and inhibition of undesired vegetative growth without simultaneously destroying the plants. Inhibition of vegetative growth is very important in a large number of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops since lodging can thus be<br><br>
reduced, or prevented completely.<br>
Owing to their herbicidal and plant-growth-regulatory properties, the herbicidal compositions according to the invention can also be employed for controlling harmful plants in crops of genetically modified plants which are known or yet to be developed. As a rule, the recombinant plants are distinguished by specific advantageous characteristics, for example by resistances to certain pesticides, in particular certain herbicides, resistances to plant diseases or the causative organisms of plant diseases such as specific insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other specific characteristics relate, for example, to the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storability, composition and specific constituents. Thus, for example, transgenic plants are known whose starch content is increased, or whose starch quality is altered, or those where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use of the compositions according to the invention in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals, for example of graminaceous crops such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice and corn, or else crops of sugarbeet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other vegetables, is preferred. Preferably, the compositions according to the invention can be employed as herbicides in crops of useful plants which resist the phytotoxic effects of the herbicides, or have been made to resist these effects by recombinant techniques.<br>
When using the herbicidal compositions according to the invention in transgenic crops, effects are frequently observed in addition to the effects against harmful plants to be observed in other crops, which are specific for the application in the transgenic crop in question, for example a modified or specifically widened weed spectrum which can be controlled, modified application rates which may be employed for application, preferably good combining ability with the herbicides to which the transgenic crop is resistant, and an effect on growth and yield level of the transgenic crop plants.<br><br>
The present invention furthermore also relates to a method for controlling unwanted vegetation (for example harmful plants, such as monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous weeds, unwanted crop plants), preferably in crops of plants such as cereals (for example wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, corn and millet), sugar beet, sugar cane, oilseed rape, cotton and soya, particularly preferably in monocotyledonous crops such as cereals, for example wheat, barley, rye, oats, and their hybrids such as triticale, rice, corn and millet, where one or more herbicidal compositions according to the invention are applied to the plants (for example harmful plants), plant parts, seeds of the plants or the area on which the plants grow (for example the area under cultivation).<br>
The plant crops may also be genetically modified or have been obtained by mutation selection; they preferably tolerate acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors.<br>
The liquid formulation of the present invention has excellent chemical stability during preparation and storage and has excellent physical stability, is easy to apply and easy to use and has high biological effectiveness and selectivity.<br>
