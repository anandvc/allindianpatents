				<td>SUBSTITUTED TfflOACETAMIDES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to chemical compositions, processes for the<br>
preparation thereof and uses of the composition. Particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to compositions that include substituted thioacetamides, and their use in the<br>
treatment of diseases, including treatment of sleepiness, promotion of wakefulness,<br>
treatment of Parkinson's disease, cerebral ischemia, stroke, sleep apneas, eating<br>
disorders, stimulation of appetite and weight gain, treatment of attention deficit<br>
hyperactivity disorder ("ADHD"), enhancing function in disorders associated with<br>
hypofunctionality of the cerebral cortex, including, but not limited to, depression,<br>
schizophrenia, fatigue, in particular, fatigue associated with neurologic disease, such as<br>
multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and improvement of cognitive dysfunction.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds disclosed herein are related to the biological and chemical<br>
analogs of modafinil. Modafinil, C15H15NO2S, also known as 2-(benzhydrylsulfinyl)<br>
acetamide, or 2-[(diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl] acetamide, is a synthetic acetamide<br>
derivative with wake-promoting activity, the structure of which has been described in<br>
French Patent No. 78 05 510 and in U.S. Patent No.477,290 ('290), and which has<br>
been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in the<br>
treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Modafinil has<br>
been tested for treatment of several behavioral conditions in combination with various<br>
agents including apomorphine, amphetamine, reserpine, oxotremorine, hypnotics,<br>
yohimbine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, as described in the<br>
cited patents. A method of preparation of a racemic mixture is described in the 290<br>
patent and a method of preparation of a levorotatory isomer is described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,927,855 (both incorporated herein by reference). The levorotatory isomer is<br>
reported to be useful for treatment of hypersomnia, depression, Alzheimer's disease and<br>
to have activity towards the symptoms of dementia and loss of memory, especially in the<br>
elderly.<br>
The primary pharmacological activity of modafinil is to promote wakefulness.<br>
Modafinil promotes wakefulness in rats (Touret et al., 1995; Edgar and Seidel, 1997),<br>
cats (Lin et al., 1992), canines (Shelton et al., 1995) and non-human primates (Hernant et<br>
al, 1991) as well as in models mimicking clinical situations, such as sleep apnea (English<br>
bulldog sleep disordered breathing model) (Panckeri et al, 1996) and narcolepsy<br>
(narcoleptic canine) (Shelton et al, 1995).<br>
Modafinil has also been described as an agent with activity in the central nervous<br>
system, and as a useful agent in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,180,745); in the protection of cerebral tissue from ischemia (U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,391,576); in the treatment of urinary and fecal incontinence (U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,401,776); and in the treatment of sleep apneas and disorders of central origin (U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,612,379). U.S. Patent No. 5,618,845 describes modafinil preparations of a<br>
defined particle size less than about 200 microns. In addition, modafinil may be used in<br>
the treatment of eating disorders, or to promote weight gain or stimulate appetite in<br>
humans or animals (US Provisional Patent Application No. 60/150,071, incorporated<br>
herein by reference), or in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder<br>
(ADHD)j or fatigue, especially fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis (US Provisional<br>
Patent Application No. 60/149,612, incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Several published patent applications describe derivative forms of modafinil and<br>
the use of modafinil derivatives in the treatment of various disorders. For example, PCT<br>
publication WOJ99/25329 describes analogs of modafinil in which the phenyl groups are<br>
substituted with a F, Cl, Br, CF3, NO2, NH2, C1-C4 alkyl, C1C4 alkoxy, or<br>
methylenedioxy, and in which the amide is substituted with OH, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4<br>
hydroxyalkyl, or a C1-C4 hydrocarbon radical. These compositions are described as<br>
being useful for treating drug-induced sleepiness, especially sleepiness associated with<br>
administration of morphine to cancer patients.<br>
Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,066,686 describes benzhydrylsulphinyl derivatives,<br>
including modafinil derivatives with an extended alkyl chain between the sulfinyl and<br>
carbonyl groups and where NR3R4 is NHOH. These compounds are described as being<br>
useful in therapy for treating disturbances of the central nervous system.<br>
PCT publication WO 95/01333 describes modafinil derivatives that are useful for<br>
modifying feeding behavior. Hie modifications to modafinil described include a chloro<br>
group at the 3 position of one of the phenyl groups, and a pyridyl substituted for the<br>
second phenyl, substitution of one or two methyl groups for hydrogens at the 2-carbon<br>
position, the amide hydrogens may be substituted with one or two groups selected from<br>
H, a pyridyl-methyl or ethyl groups, and further where the sulfur may not be oxidized.<br>
PCT publication WO 95/01171 also describes modified modafinil compounds<br>
that are said to be useful for modifying eating behavior. The described compounds<br>
include substitutions of 4-fluoro-, 3-fluoro-, and 4 chloro- in a first phenyl group and 4-<br>
fluoro- or 3-fluoro- substitutions in the second phenyl. Also described are substitutions<br>
in which the amide contains substitutions with an OH or isopropyl group.<br>
Terauchi, H, et al. described nicotinamide derivatives useful as ATP-ase<br>
inhibitors (Terauchi, H, et al,J Mied. Chem., 1997,40,313-321). In particular, several<br>
N-alkyl substituted 2-(Benzhydrylsulfinyl) nicotinamides are described.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,980,372 and 4,935,240 describe benzoylaminophenoxybutanoic<br>
acid derivatives. In particular, sulfide derivatives of modafinil containing a phenyl and<br>
substituted phenyl linker between the sulfide and carbonyl, and a substituted aryl in the<br>
terminal amide position, are disclosed.<br>
Other modafinil derivatives have been disclosed wherein the terminal phenyl<br>
groups are constrained by a linking group. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,169,<br>
certain xanthenyl and thiaxanthenyl derivatives having a substituted aryl in the terminal<br>
amide position are reported.<br>
Other xanthenyl and thiaxanthenyl derivatives are disclosed in Annis, I; Barany,<br>
G. Pept. Proc. Am. Pept. Symp. 15Th (Meeting Date 1997) 343-344, 1999 (preparation of<br>
a xanthenyl derivative of Ellman's Reagent, useful as a reagent in peptide synthesis);<br>
Han, Y.; Barany.. G. J. Org. Chem., 1997, 62,3841-3848 (preparation of S-xanthenyl<br>
protected cysteine derivatives, useful as a reagent in peptide synthesis); and El-Sakka,<br>
LA., et al. Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim), 1994,327, 133-135 (thiaxanthenol derivatives of<br>
thioglycolic acid).<br>
Thus, there is a need for novel classes of compounds that possess beneficial<br>
properties. It has been discovered that a class of compounds, referred to herein as<br>
substituted thioacetamides, are useful as agents for treating or preventing diseases or<br>
disorders, including treatment of sleepiness, promotion of wakefulness, treatment of<br>
Parkinson's disease, cerebral ischemia, stroke, sleep apneas, eating disorders, stimulation<br>
of appetite and weight gain, treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,<br>
enhancing function in disorders associated with hypofunctionality of the cerebral cortex,<br>
including, but not limited to, depression, schizophrenia, fatigue, in particular, fatigue<br>
associated with neurologic disease, such as multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome,<br>
and improvement of cognitive dysfunction. The present invention is directed to these, as<br>
well as other, important ends.<br>

Synthesis<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared in a number of ways<br>
well known to those skilled in the art The compounds can be synthesized, for example,<br>
by the methods described below, or variations thereon as appreciated by the skilled<br>
artisan. The appropriate modifications and substitutions being readily apparent and well<br>
known or readily obtainable from the scientific literature to those skilled in the art.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds of the present invention may contain<br>
one or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms, and may be isolated in optically<br>
active or racemic forms. Thus, all chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all<br>
geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry<br>
or isomeric form is specifically indicated. It is well known in the art how to prepare and<br>
isolate such optically active forms. For example, mixtures of stereoisomers may be<br>
separated by standard techniques including, but not limited to, resolution of racemic<br>
forms, normal, reverse-phase, and chiral chromatography, preferential salt formation,<br>
recrystallization, and the like, or by chiral synthesis either from chiral starting materials<br>
or by deliberate synthesis of target cbiral centers. ,<br>
As will be readily understood, functional groups present on the compounds of the<br>
present invention may contain protecting groups during the course of synthesis. For<br>
example, the amino acid side chain substituents of the compounds of formula (I), (I-A),<br>
(II), or (II-A) can be substituted with protecting groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl or t-<br>
butoxycarbonyl groups. Protecting groups are known per se as chemical functional<br>
groups that can be selectively appended to and removed from functionalities, such as<br>
hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. These groups are present in a chemical compound<br>
to render such functionality inert to chemical reaction conditions to which the compound<br>
is exposed. Any of a variety of protecting groups may be employed with the present<br>
invention. Preferred protecting groups include the benzyloxycarbonyl ("Cbz") group, the<br>
tert-butyloxycarbonyl ("Boc") group, and the tosyl (p-toluensulfonyl, "Tos") group.<br>
Other preferred protecting groups according to the invention may be found in Greene,<br>

Compounds of the present invention may be prepared as outlined in the following<br>
schemes. The reagents and starting materials are commercially available, or readily<br>
synthesized by well-known techniques by one of ordinary skill in the arts. All<br>
substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined.<br>
A general synthetic procedure is set forth, in Scheme A for preparing the<br>
compounds of formula (I) [wherein Y=C(R1)(R2) and m, n=0] or (I-A):<br>
Scheme A, step 1: Synthesis of compounds of general structure c:<br>
In step la, the appropriate aryl halide a undergoes a metal exchange reaction with<br>
an organometallic compound to give the corresponding metalloaryl compound. For<br>
example, an appropriate haloaromatic or haloheteroaromatic (compound a) is reacted<br>
with an appropriate alkyl lithium compound in an aprotic solvent at a temperature -78 °C.<br>
An appropriate haloaromatic or haloheteroaromatic compound is one where Ari is as<br>
defined in the final product. An appropriate alkyl lithium compound is one that effects a<br>
metal-halogen exchange.<br>
In step lb, an appropriate aryl aldehyde b is added to the previously formed<br>
metalloaryl compound to give desired di-aryl alcohol c. For example, an appropriate<br>
aromatic aldehyde or heteroaromatic aldehyde (compound b) in an aprotic solvent is<br>
added to reaction product of step la. An appropriate heteroaromatic aldehyde is one<br>
where Ar2 is as defined in the final product Upon completion, the reaction mixture is<br>
quenched by an appropriate quenching agent and the product, compound c, is isolated by<br>
conventional methods commonly employed by those skilled in the art.<br>
For example, a cooled (-70 °C to -78 °C) solution of an appropriate haloaromatic<br>
or haloheteroaromatic (compound a) in dry ether is reacted with n-butyllithium (1.1 eqv).<br>
After stirring for an additional period of time to allow the completion of halogen-metal<br>
exchange reaction, the next reactant, an appropriate heteroaromatic aldehyde (compound<br>
b) in ether is slowly be added to the reaction flask. Stirring is continued for an additional<br>
2-3 h at the low temperature. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is<br>
slowly allowed to come to ambient temperature, followed by quenching, preferably by a<br>
saturated NH4CI solution. The mixture is extracted into an organic solvent (ether or<br>
ethyl acetate). The organic layer is washed with brine, dried (MgSCU or NaaSCk) and<br>
concentrated to give a crude product Purification is achieved by employing known<br>
purification techniques (preferably by column chromatography and/or recrystallization)<br>
to provide pure compounds c. The method is an adaptation from a procedure previously<br>
described by Gronowitz, S.; Eriksson, B. Arkiv Kemi 1963,335, incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. Alternatively, this class of compounds wherein Ari is the same<br>
as Ar2 may be generated by treatment of two equivalents of an appropriate<br>
haloheteroaromatic with two equivalents of n-butyllithium, followed by one equivalent<br>
of ethyl formate as described by Nenajdenko, V. G.; Baraznenok, I. L.; Balenkova, E. S.<br>
J. Org. Chem. 1998,6132, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Scheme A, step 2: Synthesis of compounds of general structure d:<br>
In step 2a, the alcohol moiety of compound c is converted to the corresponding<br>
thiol. The thiol, in step 2b, undergoes a substitution reaction with an appropriate<br>
halogen-substituted alkylcarboxylic acid of structure Br-(CH2VY-(CH2)n-COOH, to<br>
generate compound d. For example, di-aryl alcohol c is reacted with thiourea in<br>
presence of an acid to convert it to a thiouronium moiety that is subsequently hydrolyzed<br>
in the presence of an alkaline base and reacted with the appropriate halogen-substituted<br>
alkylcarboxylic acid to generate compound d (step 2b). An appropriate acid derivative is<br>
one in which m, n, Y are as defined in the final product<br>
For example, in step 2a, an appropriate amount of thiourea is taken into 48% HBr<br>
and water. The mixture is wanned (preferably to 60 - 70 °C), followed by addition of<br>
compound c. The temperature of the reaction mixture is elevated (preferably to 90—95<br>
°C) and the stirring is continued for an additional period of time for completion of the<br>
reaction. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature (in some cases, an ice-bath<br>
might be needed) and the precipitated solid should be filtered and thoroughly washed<br>
with water.<br>
In step 2b, the wet solid from the previous step is taken into additional water and<br>
treated with an aqueous base, preferably sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is<br>
wanned (preferably to 70 - 80 °C, but in some cases a higher temperature might be<br>
needed) and to it an appropriate amount of halogen-substituted alkylcarboxylic acid<br>
derivative in water ( or in some cases, an alcoholic solvent) is added. The reaction<br>
mixture is maintained at an elevated temperature (preferably 100 — 110 °C) for an<br>
appropriate period of time, cooled, taken into water and washed with an organic solvent<br>
(preferably ether). The basic aqueous layer is acidified with an inorganic acid solution<br>
(e.g. aqueous HC1 solution). The aqueous (acidic) solution is then extracted several<br>
times into an organic solvent (e.g. ether or ethyl acetate). The combined organic layer is<br>
washed with brine, dried (MgSO4 or Na2SO4) and concentrated to give the crude product<br>
that may be used directly in the next step. However, purification could be achieved by<br>
employing known purification techniques (e.g. recrystallization) to provide pure<br>
compound d.<br>
The method is an adaptation from a procedure previously described in U.S. Pat<br>
No. 4,177,290, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
Scheme A, step 3: Synthesis of compounds of general structure e:<br>
In step 3a, the carboxylic acid is converted into appropriate acid derivative, which<br>
is then reacted with an appropriate amine to give compound e. For example in step 3a,<br>
compound d can be converted to the corresponding acid chloride, or the corresponding<br>
activated ester. The acid chloride can be obtained by reacting compound d with thionyl<br>
chloride in an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent in refluxing condition. Alternatively, the<br>
activated ester can be obtained by use of various agents known in the art, such as 2-(lH-<br>
Benzotriazol-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate ("TBTU"), N-<br>
methylmorpholine ("NMM") and dimethyl formamide ("DMF"). In step 3b, the product<br>
of step 3a is reacted with an appropriate amine of structure NHR3R4 to give the desired<br>
compound e. An appropriate amine is one which correlates to R3 and R4 as defined in<br>
the final product<br>
For example, a solution of an appropriate carboxylic acid (compound d) in either<br>
benzene or toluene is brought to reflux temperature and to it is slowly added an<br>
appropriate amount of thionyl chloride. The mixture is refluxed until the disappearance<br>
of starting material (as evidenced by analytical techniques), cooled and solvent removed.<br>
The resulting residue is taken into an appropriate organic solvent (preferably<br>
tetrahydrofuran or methylene chloride) and treated with ammonia gas (or 28% aqueous<br>
ammonia hydroxide solution) or an appropriate amine. The reaction mixture is then<br>
partitioned between water and an organic solvent (preferably ethyl acetate). The<br>
separated organic layer is washed with water, dilute acid, dilute base and brine, dried<br>
over a drying agent (e.g. MgSC&gt;4 or Na2SC&gt;4) and concentrated to give the crude product<br>
that may be purified by column chromatography and/or recrystallization to produce<br>
compound e.<br>
Scheme A, optional step 4: Synthesis of compounds of general structure f:<br>
Compounds of structure e may optionally be oxidized to generate compounds of<br>
structure f. Thus, compound f is prepared by reacting compound e in an appropriate<br>
solvent with an appropriate oxidizing agent. An appropriate oxidizing agent is one that<br>
oxidizes the sulfide group of compound e. The corresponding product is isolated and<br>
purified by methods well known in the art<br>
For example, to a cooled (-15 °C to -25 °C) solution of compound e in an organic<br>
solvent (preferably methylene chloride or chloroform), an appropriate oxidizing agent<br>
(e.g. m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid ["w-CPBA"], 1 equivalent) in the same solvent is<br>
slowly added. Stirring is continued at low temperature until the disappearance of the<br>
starting material, as evidenced by various analytical techniques. The reaction mixture is<br>
then thoroughly washed with a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, water and brine,<br>
respectively, dried over a drying agent (e.g. MgSO4 or Na2SO4) and concentrated. The<br>
desired product (compound f) is purified, if needed, by employing known purification<br>
techniques (preferably by column chromatography and/or recrystallization). In some<br>
cases, the oxidation is performed by employing 50% H2O2 in glacial acetic acid solvent<br>
A general synthetic procedure is set forth in Scheme B for preparing the<br>
compounds of formula (II) [wherein ring A is phenylene; Y=C(Ri)(R2) and m, n, r, s=0]<br>

compounds of formula (I-A), wherein n=0 and Y is<br>

The synthetic steps in Scheme C, steps 1 and 2 involve the same multistep<br>
general method described in Scheme A, steps 2-3, respectively to give compounds of<br>
structure eee.<br>
Scheme C, step 3: Synthesis of compounds of general structure fit<br>
The amide moiety in compound eee is converted to corresponding thioamide<br>
moiety iff with an appropriate sulfur-transfer reagent. For example, a mixture of<br>
compound eee and Lawesson's reagent (1.05 eqv) in a suitable solvent (dimethoxyethane<br>
or tetrahydroniran) is heated to reflux until the disappearance of the starting material.<br>
After cooling, the'desired product (compound ffi) is obtained by employing known<br>
purification techniques (preferably by column chromatography and/or recrystallization).<br>
Scheme C, step 4: Synthesis of compounds of general structure ggg.<br>
The thioamide moiety in compound flffis cyclized to the corresponding thiazole<br>
moiety. For example, a mixture of compound fiff and an appropriate bromomethyl<br>
ketone (1.1 eqv) in a suitable solvent (e.g. ethanol) is heated to reflux until the<br>
disappearance of the starting material. After cooling, the desired product (compound<br>
ggg) is obtained by employing known purification techniques (preferably by column<br>
chromatography and/or recrystallization).<br>
Scheme C, steps 5-6: Synthesis of compounds of general structure hhh and iii.<br>

general method described in Scheme A, steps 3 and 4, respectively to give compounds of<br>

Preparation of compound 34:<br>
Scheme 3, step 2: In the first step, thiourea (5 g, 1.3 equivalents) was taken into<br>
48% HBr and water. The mixture was warmed (preferably to 60° - 70° C), followed by<br>
addition of compound 33 (10 g). The temperature of the reaction mixture was elevated<br>
(preferably to 90° -95° C) and stirring was continued for an additional period of time for<br>
completion of the reaction. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature<br>
(in some cases, an ice-bath might be needed) and the precipitated solid was filtered and<br>
thoroughly washed with water.<br>
The wet solid was then taken into additional water and treated with an aqueous<br>
base, preferably sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture was warmed (preferably to 70°<br>
— 80° C, but in some cases, a higher temperature might be needed) and to it chloroacetic<br>
acid (4.8 g, 1.1 equivalents) in water was added. The reaction mixture was maintained at<br>
an elevated temperature (preferably 100° - 110° C) for an appropriate period of time,<br>
cooled, taken into water and washed with an organic solvent (preferably ether). The<br>
basic aqueous layer was acidified with an inorganic acid solution (e.g. aqueous HC1<br>
solution). The aqueous (acidic) solution was then extracted several times into an organic<br>
solvent (e.g. ether or ethyl acetate). The combined organic layer was washed with brine,<br>
dried (MgSO4 or Na&amp;SC^) and concentrated to give the crude product 34 that may be<br>

extracted into ethyl acetate (3 x 25 mL). The organic layer was washed with water,<br>
brine, dried (magnesium sulfate), and concentrated in vacuo to generate compound P as a<br>
yellow solid (1.75 g) that was used without any further purification. Analytical Data: 1H<br>

Starting from compound P, this compound was generated following the<br>
procedure as described above for the preparation of compound 47, and in Example 35 for<br>
the synthesis of compound 1-37. Thus, 0.050 mg of compound P, on treatment with<br>
ammonia in the first step, followed by oxidation with w-CPB A in the next step,<br>
generated 0.011 g of compound 11-66. Analytical Data: *H-NMR (CDC13) 8 2.75 (d,<br>

Example 93: Demonstration of Wake-promoting activity of compound 1-9.<br>
The methodology utilized is as described by Edgar and Seidel, Journal of<br>
Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 283:757-769,1997, incorporated herein<br>
in its entirety by reference.<br>
Animal Surgery. Adult, male Wistar rats (275-320g from Charles River<br>
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were anesthetized (Nembutal, 60mg/kg, ip) and<br>
surgically prepared with implants for recording of chronic EEG and EMG recording. The<br>
EEG implants consisted of stainless steel screws (2 frontal (+3.9 AP from bregma,<br>
±2.0ML) and 3 occipital (-6.4 AP, ± 5.5ML). Two Teflon-coated stainless steel wires<br>
were positioned under the nuchal trapezoid muscles for EMG recording. All leads were<br>
soldered to a miniature connector (Microtech, Boothwyn, PA) and gas sterilized with<br>
ethylene oxide before surgery. The implant assembly was affixed to the skull by the<br>
combined adhesion of the EEG recording screws, cyanoacrylate applied between the<br>
hermetically sealed implant connector and skull and dental acrylic. An antibiotic<br>
(Gentamycin) was administered for 3 to 5 days postsurgery. At least 3 weeks were<br>
allowed for postsurgical recovery.<br>
Recording environment Rats were housed individually within specially<br>
modified Nalgene microisolator cages equipped with a low-torque slip-ring commutator<br>
(Biella Engineering, Irvine, CA) and a custom polycarbonate filter-top riser. These<br>
cages were isolated in separate, ventilated compartments of a stainless steel sleep-wake<br>
recording chamber. Food and water were available ad libitum and ambient temperature<br>
was 24 +_ 1°C. A 24-h light-dark cycle (light/dark 12-12-) was maintained throughout<br>
the study by 4-watt fluorescent bulbs located approximately 5cm from the top of each<br>
cage. Light intensity was 30 to 35 lux at midlevel inside the cage. Animals were<br>
undisturbed for 3 days both before and after the treatments.<br>
Automated data collection. Sleep and wake stages were determined with<br>
SCORE, a microcomputer-based sleep-wake and physiological monitoring system.<br>
SCORE™design features, validation in rodents and utility in preclinical drug evaluation<br>
have been reported elsewhere (Van Gelder, et al., 1991; Edgar, et al., 1991,1997; Seidel,<br>
et al, 1995, incorporated by reference herein in their entirety). In the present study, the<br>
system monitored amplified (X 10,000) EEG (bandpass, 1-30 Hz; digitization rate, 100<br>
Hz) and integrated EMG (bandpass, 10-100 Hz, root mean square integration). Arousal<br>
states were classified on-line as NREM sleep, REM sleep, wake or theta-dominated<br>
wake every 10s by use of EEG period and amplitude feature extraction and ranked<br>
membership, algorithms. Individually taught EEG-arousal-state templates and EMG<br>
criteria differentiated REM sleep from theta-dominated wakefulness (Welsh, et al, 1985,<br>
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Data quality was assured by frequent on-<br>
line inspection of the EEG and EMG signals. Raw data quality and sleep-wake scoring<br>
was scrutinized further by a combination of graphical and statistical assessments of the<br>
data as well as visual examination of the raw EEG wave forms and distribution of<br>
integrated EMG values.<br>
Drag administration and study design. Compound 1-9 was suspended in<br>
sterile 0.25% methylcellulose (pH=6.2; Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI) or methylcellulose<br>
vehicle alone was injected intraperitoneally in a volume of lml/kg. Sample size (n) was<br>
13 animals per treatment group.<br>
EEG spectral analysis. Each 10-s epoch of raw EEG signal was digitized (100<br>
Hz) for 24h and wakefulness was scored as described previously by Edgar and Seidel<br>
(1996), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
Data analysis and statistics. The principal variable recorded was minutes per<br>
hour of wake. Treatment groups were compared post-treatment by repeated-measures<br>
ANOVA. In the presence of a significant main effect, Dunnett's contracts {a = 0.05)<br>
assessed differences between active treatment groups and vehicle controls, unless<br>
otherwise specified.<br>
Results. Figure 1 illustrates degree of wakefulness in rats treated at time zero<br>
with either 100 mg/kg, ip of compound 1-9 (solid line) or methylcellulose vehicle<br>
(stippled line). Compound 1-9 produced wakefulness beyond that observed in vehicle-<br>
treated animals that lasted until approximately 110 minutes following administration.<br>
Example 94: Demonstration of Wake-promoting activity of compound 11-23.<br>
The methodology utilized is based on that described by Edgar and Seidel, Journal<br>
of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 283:757-769,1997, and incorporated<br>
herein in its entirety by reference.<br>
Animal Surgery. Adult, male Wistar rats (275-320g from Charles River<br>
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were anesthetized (NembutaL 4Smg/kg, ip) and surgically<br>
prepared with implants for recording of chronic EEG and EMG recording. The EEG<br>
implants were made from commercially available components (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA).<br>
EEG's were recorded from stainless steel screw electrodes (2 frontal (+3.0 mm AP from<br>
bregma, ±2.0 mm ML) and 2 occipital (-4.0 mm AP, ±2.0 mm ML)). Two Teflon-coated<br>
stainless steel wires were positioned under the nuchal trapezoid muscles for EMG recording.<br>
All electrode leads were inserted into a connector pedestal and the pedestal, screws, and<br>
wires affixed to the skull by application dental acrylic. Antibiotic was administered post<br>
surgically and antibiotic cream was applied to the wound edges to prevent infection. At<br>
least 1 week elapsed between surgery and recording. Animals are tested for approximately<br>
6-8 weeks and then sacrificed.<br>
Recording environment. PostsurgicaUy, rats were housed individually in an<br>
isolated room. At least 24 hrs. prior to recording, they were placed in Nalgene<br>
containers (31x31x31 cm) with a wire-mesh top, and entry to the room was prohibited<br>
until after recording had ended except for dosing. The containers were placed on a 2-<br>
shelf rack, 4 per shelf. Food and water were available ad libitum, ambient temperature<br>
was 21°C, and humidity was 55%. White-noise was provided in the background (68db<br>
inside the containers) to mask ambient sounds. Fluorescent overhead room lights were<br>
set to a 24 hr. light/dark cycle (on at 7 AM, off at 7 PM). Light levels inside the<br>
containers were 38 and 25 lux for the top and bottom shelves respectively.<br>
Data acquisition. EEG and EMG signals were led via cables to a commutator<br>
(Plastics One) and then to pre-amplifiers (model 1700, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA).<br>
EEG and EMG signals were amplified (10K and IK respectively) and bandpass filtered<br>
between 0.3 and 500 Hz for EEG, and betweenlO and 500 Hz for EMG. These signals<br>
were digitized at 128 samples per second using ICELUS sleep research software (M.<br>
Opp, U. Texas; see Opp, Physiology and Behavior 63:67-74,1998, and Imeri, Mancia,<br>
and Opp, Neuroscicnce 92:745-749,1999, incorporated by reference herein in their<br>
entirety) running under Labview 5.1 software and data acquisition hardware (PCI-MIO-<br>
16E-4; National Instruments, Austin, TX). On the day of dosing, data was recorded from<br>
11 AM to 6PM.<br>
Sleep./ wake scoring. Sleep and wake stages were determined manually using<br>
ICELUS software. This program displays the EEG and EMG data in blocks of 6 sec.<br>
along with the EEG-FFT. Arousal state was scored as awake (WAK), rapid eye-<br>
movement (REM), or slow-wave or non-REM sleep (NREM) according to visual<br>
analysis of EEG frequency and amplitude characteristics and EMG activity (Opp and<br>
Krueger, American Journal of Physiology 266:R688-95,1994; Van Gelder, et al., 1991;<br>
Edgar, et al., 1991,1997; Seidel, et al, 1995, incorporated by reference herein in their<br>
entirety). Essentially, waking activity consists of relative low-amplitude EEG activity<br>
with relatively lower power in the lower frequency bands from 0.5 - 6 Hz, accompanied<br>
by moderate to high level EMG activity. In a particular waking state ("theta-waking"),<br>
EEG power can be relatively focused in the 6-9 Hz (theta) range, but significant EMG<br>
activity is always present NREM sleep is characterized by relative high-amplitude EEG<br>
activity with relatively greater power in the low frequency bands from 0.5 - 6 Hz,<br>
accompanied by little or no EMG activity. REM sleep is characterized by moderate and<br>
constant amplitude EEG focused in the theta (6-9 Hz range), similar to waking theta, but<br>
with no EMG activity.<br>
Drug administration and study design. Compounds were evaluated on groups<br>
of 4 or 8 rats which were tested in 2 sessions at least 2 days apart. Initial studies used a<br>
crossover design, such that rats received either vehicle or test compound during each<br>
session. Animals were pseudo-randomized so that they did not receive the same drug<br>
twice. Compound 11-23 was suspended in sterile 0.25% methylcellulose (pH=6.2;<br>
Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI) at 30 mg/ml. This study was carried out on 8 rats which<br>
were tested in 2 sessions 5 days apart (overall, 7 rats received compound 11-23 and 6<br>
methylcellulose vehicle). Dosing was carried out at noon, while the rats were<br>
predominantly asleep. Each rat was lifted out of its container, given an intrapcritoneal.<br>
injection in a volume of 333 ml/kg, and replaced. Dosing required approximately 8<br>
minutes*<br>
Data analysis and statistics. The principal outcome measure was minutes per<br>
hour of wakefulness. The pommy outcome measure for puipostt<br>
in these experiments consists of the total integrated wake time for the first 3 hours post<br>
dosing relative to vehicle control. Thus, vehicle treated animals typically average 20%<br>
wake time during the recording period, or a total of 0.2 * 180 =36min. A2-tailed,<br>
unpaired t-test (Statview 5.0, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NQ was performed on the wake<br>
time values for drug and vehicle treated animals, and compounds with p
deemed significantly wake-promoting. Waking activity was also evaluated for<br>
successive half-hour periods beginning with the time of dosing, and individual t-tests<br>
performed at each time point to establish the duration of significant wake-promoting<br>
activity.<br>
Results. Figure 2 illustrates degree of wakefulness in rats treated at noon with<br>
either 100 mg/kg, ip. of compound 11-23 (solid triangles) or methylcellulose vehicle<br>
(open circles). Each point represents the mean percent of time awake for the<br>
succeeding half hour. The dosing procedure produced a transient (~20 min.) period of<br>
elevated wakefulness in bom treatment groups compared to pre-dosing baseline activity.<br>
Compound 11-23 produced significantly greater wakefulness than that observed in<br>
vehicle-treated animals (p
