DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
To make it easier for our examiner to understand the objectives, characteristics and effects of the present invention, a preferred embodiment with accompanying drawings are used for a detailed description of the invention as follows.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a high-speed knitting machine structure of the invention focuses on the pin plate bars, the transmission of the pin platform, and the adjustment of the weft pin plate, wherein a link base 4 is connected to an end of the plurality of pin plate bars 2 that passes through a weft plate holder 3 in the knitting machine 1, and the ink base 4 is pivotally connected to a link rod 41, and anther end of the link rod 41 is pivotally connected to a side of an bias spindle 421 of a driving body 5 connected by the spindle 421 of the drive motor 42. In Figs. 3 A, 3B and 3C, a guided rod 31 disposed on each of both sides of the weft plate holder 3 is installed into a through hole 3A1 disposed separately on both sides of the fixed plate base 3 A for limiting up and down movements, and the adjusting holes 32 disposed at an upper row of the adjusting base 6 are provided for passing the pin plate bars 2, and the threaded hole 61 disposed at a lower row of the adjusting through hole 33 are provided for passing the positioning bolt 3B into the adjusting base 6, for securing and positioning the adjusting base 6 and the weft plate holder 3, and a fixed plate 3C is installed on the weft plate holder 3, and an adjusting screw rod 6A disposed separately at a plurality of indents of the fixed plate 3C and secured into the screw hole 62 at the top of the adjusting base 6 to touch the pin plate bars 2, and the penetrating hole 63 disposed on the surface of the weft plate holder 3 that is<br><br>
attached onto the adjusting base 6 are provided for passing the pin plate bars 2 and secured into a threaded hole 61 by a positioning bolt, and a screw hole 62 is disposed at the top. In Figs. 4A-4C, a plurality of pin plate bars 2 of the knitting machine 1 are passed through the weft plate holder 3 and positioned at an external side of the main plate 11, and a lower end of a long swing rod 71 is pivotally connected onto the main plate 11, and an upper end of the long swing rod 71 is pivotally connected to a link rod 72, such that the link rod 72 is pivotally installed at a position adjacent to the spindle of the power wheel 73 in an eccentric form. The second warp pin plate 12 is then installed and fixed at the top of the long swing rod 71, and the first warp pin plate 13 is installed into a transverse rod 14 of the main plate 11 adjacent to the second warp pin plate 12, such that after the transverse rod 14 is passed through the internal side of the main plate 11, the link member 74 is installed, and an elliptical hole 741 of the link member 74 is latched into an end of the swing member 75, and the swing member 75 drives the chain 76 to move the gear plate 77; and the second warp pin plate 12 installs a plurality of crotched hooks 12A, and the first warp pin plate 13 installs a plurality of warp pins 13A .<br>
After the knitting machine 1 installs the transmission structure with a plurality of drive motors (as shown in Figs. 5A and 5B) and the drive motor 42 is started, the driving body 5 connected to the spindle 42 is driven to start moving from a still state (as shown in Fig. 6A), and also drive the link rod 41, the link base 4 and the pin plate bars 2 to move sideway reciprocally (as shown in Fig. 6B), such that the pin plate bars 2 can be moved stably in the weft plate holder 3. Therefore, the present invention not only moves quickly, but also displaces stably to provide various complicated, precision and fine changes, and achieve the effects of lowering noises, reducing worn-outs of components, and facilitating maintenance and repair, so as to have accurately controls and operations.<br>
The positioning bolt 3B is used for securing and attaching the adjusting base 6 closely onto the weft plate holder 3 (as shown in Figs. 7A and B), such that if the adjusting base 6 and the weft plate holder 3 are separated slightly with each other, and the adjusting screw rod 6A of the weft plate holder 3 are operated helically up and down (as shown in Figs. 8 A and 8B), the upper and lower sets of two pin plate bars 2 will change their positions. After the height of the adjusting base 6 is positioned, the adjusting screw rod 6A on the weft plate holder 3 is secured again, and the positioning bolt 3B is Secured to<br><br>
resume the close engagement between the adjusting base 6 and the weft plate holder 3 (as shown in Figs. 7A and 7B). Therefore, a plurality of adjusting bases 6 can individually change each set of pin plate bars 2, and the present invention can provide more fine, delicate, complicated and diversified operations than the conventional "whole" or "half way of changing the position of the weft plate holder 3.<br>
After the power of the pin platform of the knitting machine 1 is turned on, the power wheel 73 drives a bias link rod 72 adjacent to its spindle to move, and the pivotally connected long swing rod 71 to move accordingly (as shown in Figs. 9A-9D). Sine the second warp pin plate 12 is installed at a fixed position at the top of the long swing rod 71, and the long swing rod 71 swings in an arc path under the movement of the link rod 72, a plurality of crotched hooks 12A on the second warp pin plate 12 will move back and forth in an arc form (as shown in Figs. 11A and 11B). By then, the swing member 75 is driven by the motive forces of the gear plate 77 and chain 76 to start swinging, since the first warp pin plate 13 adjacent to the second warp pin plate 12 is driven by the transverse rod 14 and link member 74 that are connected to the link member 74. As a result, the link member 74 using the transverse rod 14 as an axis to swing and move (as shown in Figs. 10A and 10B), and the plurality of the warp pins 13A also cause the transverse rod 14 and the first warp pin plate 13 to swing linearly in the same direction within the upper and lower included angles (as shown in Figs. 11A and 11B), and the warp pin 12A and crotched hooks 13A on the pin platform can have complicated, delicate and fine knitting operations.<br>
In summation of the description above, the present invention herein enhances the performance over the conventional structure, and definitely can overcome the shortcomings of the prior art and comply with the requirements of patent application, and is thus duly filed for patent application.<br><br>
