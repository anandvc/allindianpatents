Therefore the invention includes all conceivable pure diastereomers and pure enantiomers of the com¬pounds of formula I, as well as all mixtures thereof independent from the ratio, including the racemates. Preferred are those compounds of formula I, in which the hydrogen atoms in the positions 4a and 8a are cis-configuralod. Especially preferred in this connection are those compounds, in which Iho .'jbt;o-lute configuration (according to the rules of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog) is S in the position 4a and R in the position 8a. Racemates can be split up into the corresponding enantiomers by methods known by a person skilled in the art. Preferably the racemic mixtures are separated into two diastereomers during the preparation with the help of an optical active separation agent on the stage of the cyclohexane-carboxylic acids or the 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrobenzoic acids (for example, starting compounds A1, A2 and A3). As separation agents may be mentioned, for example, optical active amines such as the (+)- and (-)-forms of 1-phenylethylamine [(R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine = (R)-(+)-a-methylben2ylamine or (S)-(-)-1-phenylethylamine = (S)-(-)-a-methylbenzylamine) and ephedrine, the optical active alkaloids quinine, cinchonine, cinchonidine and brucine.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be prepared, for example, as described in Reaction scheme 1.<br><br><br>

Treatment of compound A6 with concentrated hydrochloric acid results in the for¬mation of piperidin-4-yl-hydrazine dihydrochloride (starting compound A5).<br>
The reaction of piperidin-4-yl-hydrazine dihydrochloride with cyclohexanecarboxylic acids or 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrobenzoic acids of formulae ilia or lllb leads to the piperidino derivatives of formula II.<br>
These are reacted in the final reaction step with compounds of formula R9-X, wherein X represents a suitable leaving group, preferably a chlorine atom, to give the compounds of formula I,<br>
For some compounds of formula I, it can be advantageous, to introduce the substituent R9 in two reac¬tion steps. As example may be mentioned those compounds of formula I, wherein R9 represents mor-pholin-4~ylethanoyl. Here, the corresponding compounds of formula II are reacted in a lirst step with chloroacetylchloride and then in a second step with morpholine.<br>
Suitably, the conversions are carried out analogous to methods which are familiar per so to the person skilled in the art, for example, in the manner which is described in the following examples.<br>
The preparation of the cyclohexanecarboxylic acids and 1,3,5,6-tetrahydrobenzoic acids of the formu¬lae Ilia or lllb is described, for example, in W098/31674, WO99/31090 and WO99/47505.<br>
The substances according to the invention are isolated and purified in a manner known per so, e.g. by distilling off the solvent in vacuo and recrystallislng the residue obtained from a suitable solvent or subjecting it (o one of the customary purification methods, such as column chromatorimphy on a suit¬able support material.<br>
Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (for example a ketone like acetone, methylethylketone, or methylisobutylketone, an ether, like diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol, such as ethanol, isopropanol) which contains the desired acid, or to which the desired acid is then added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a non-solvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted by basifica-tion into the free compounds which, in turn, can be converted into salts. In this manner, pharmacologi¬cally non-tolerable salts can be converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br>

The person skilled in the art is familiar with auxiliaries which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations on account of his export knowledge. In addition to solvents, gel lormers, ointment bases and other active compound excipients, for example antioxidants, dispersants, emuls.fiers, preservati¬ves, solubilizers or permeation promoters, can be used.<br><br>
For tlio treatment of disorders of lite inr.plrnlory tincl, 11ns compounds oeeoidiiui In IIw invention oi.' preferably also administered by Initiation In the form of nn aerosol; the aerosol particles ul solid, liquid or mixed composition preferably having a diameter of 0f&gt; lo 1fl pin, ndvnnl.'iooour.ly of:- lo li pm,<br>
Aerosol generation can be carried oui, for example, by pressure-driven jet atomizers or ultrasonic at¬omizers, but advantageously by propellant-driven metered aerosols or propellant-free administration of micronized active compounds from inhalation capsules.<br>
Depending on the inhaler system used, in addition to the active compounds the administration forms additionally contain the required excipients, such as, for example, propellants (e.g. Frigen in the case of metered aerosols), surface-active substances, emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives, flavorings, fillers (e.g. lactose in the case of powder inhalers) or, if appropriate, further active compounds,<br>
For the purposes of inhalation, a large number of apparatuses are available with which aerosols of optimum particle size can be generated and administered, using nn inhalation technique which hi ON right mi possible lor the patient. In addlllon lo II10 use ol adaptors (spnceis, expander:/.) mid poai shaped containers (e.g. Nebulator®, Volumatic®), and automatic devices emitting a puffer spray (Autohaler®), for metered aerosols, in particular in the case of powder inhalers, a number of technical solutions are available (e.g. Diskhaler®, Rotadisk®, Turbohaler© or the inhaler described in European Patent Application EP 0 505 321), using which an optimal administration of active compound can be achieved.<br>
For the treatment of dermatoses, the compounds according to the invention are in particular administe¬red in the form of those medicaments which are suitable for topical application. For the production of the medicaments, the compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are preferably mixed with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries and further processed to give suitable pharmaceutical formulations. Suitable pharmaceutical formulations are, for example, powders, emulsions, suspensions, sprays, oils, ointments, fatty ointments, creams, pastes, gels or solutions.<br>
The medicaments according to the invention are prepared by processes known per se. The dosage of the active compounds is carried out in the order of magnitude customary for PDE inhibitors. Topical a ^plication forms (such as ointments) for the treatment of dermatoses thus contain the active com¬pounds in a concentration of, for example, 0.1-99%. The dose for administration by inhalation is cuslo-marly between 0.1 and 3 mg per day. The customary dose in the case of systemic therapy (p.o. or i.v.) is between 0.03 and 3 mg/kg per day.<br><br>
Biological investigations<br>
The second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) is well-known for inhibiting inflammatory and immunocom¬petent cells. The PDE4 isoenzyme is broadly expressed in cells involved in the initiation and propaga¬tion of inflammatory diseases (H Terior and C Schudt, in ..Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors", 21-40, „The Handbook of Immunopharmacology", Academic Press, 1996), and its inhibition leads !o an increase of the intracellular cAMP concentration and thus to the inhibition of cellular activation (Jl£ Soilness el al., Immunopharmacology 47: 127-162, 2000).<br>
The antiinflammatory potential of PDEE4 inhibitors in vivo in various animal models has been described \WIWI Teixe'wa, YiPS *i"b\ "ioVi"70, "iSS^V 'rvn Vrns VrwBB'iitraYiori ol "PVEU inWtoWion on Yne cardial 'levtii 'iVn vitro), a large variety of proinflammatory responses can be measured. Examples are the superoxide production of neutrophilic (C Schudt et al., Arch Pharmacol 344: 682-690, 1991) or eosinophilic (A Hatzelmann et al., Brit J Pharmacol 114: 821-831, 1995) granulocytes, which can be measured as lu-minol-enhanced chemiluminescence, or the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-a in monocytes, macro¬phages or dendritic cells (Gantner et alv Brit J Pharmacol 121: 221-231, 1997, and Pulmonary Phar¬macol Therap 12: 377-386, 1999). ||1 addition, the immunomodulatory potential of PDE4 inhibitors is evident from the inhibition of T-cell responses like cytokine synthesis or proliferation (DM Essayan, Biochem Pharmacol 57: 965-973, 1900). Substances which inhibit the secretion of the afore-mentioned proinflammatory mediators are those which inhibit PDE4. PDE4 inhibition by the compounds according to the invention is thus a central indicator for the suppression of inflammatory processes.<br>
Method for measuring inhibition of PDE4 activity<br>
PDE4 tiolivity was dolurmlned as described by Thompson ct nl. (Adv Cycl NucI Reis 10: 69-92, 197!)) with some modifications (Bauer and schwabe, Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol 311: 193-198, 1980). At a final assay volume of 200 Ml (96well microtiter plates) the assay mixture contained 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCI2, 0.5 uM cAMP, [3H]cAMP (about 30,000 cpm/assay), the test compound and an aliquot of cytosol from human neutrophils which mainly contains PDE4 activity as described by Schudt et al. (Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol 344: 682-690, 1991); the PDE3-specific inhibi¬tor Motapizone (1 pM) was included to suppress PDE3 activity originating from contaminating platelets. Serial dilutions of the compounds were prepared in DMSO and further diluted 1:100 (v/v) In (ho jisstiys lo obtain the desired final concentrations of the Inhibitors at a DMSO concentration of 1 % (v/v) which by itself only slightly affected PDE4 activity-After preincubation for 5 min at 37°C, the reaction was started by the addition of substrate (cAMP) and the assays were incubated for further 15 min at 37°C. 50 ul of 0.2 N HCI was added to stop the reaction and the assays were left on ice for about 10 min. Following incubation with 25 pg 5'-nucleotidase (Cro-talus atrox snake venom) for 10 min at 37°C, the assays were loaded on QAE Sephadcx A-25 (1 ml bed<br><br>
. volume). The columns were eluted with 2 ml of 30 mM ammonium formiate (pH 6.0) and the eluate was counted for radioactivity. Results were corrected for blank values (measured in the presence of dena¬tured protein) which were below 5 % of total radioaclivity. The amount of cyclic nucleotides liydroly/ed did not exceed 30 % of the original substrate concentration. The IC50 -values for the compounds ac¬cording to the invention for the inhibition of the PDE4 activity were determined from the concentration-inhibition curves by nonlinear-regression.<br>
The inhibitory values determined for the compounds according to the invention follow from the followlncj table A, in which the numbers of the compounds correspond to the numbers of the examples.<br>
