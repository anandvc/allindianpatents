Accordingly the present invention relates to a hollow anode plasma torch comprising:<br>
a twin electrode configuration consisting of<br>
a tubular anode;<br>
a rod shaped cathode;<br>
means for holding the anode and cathode in position<br>
a platform for mounting the said anode and said cathode in<br>
position;<br>
means for lifting the platform;<br>

electrode configuration;<br>
means for initiating the arc;<br>
means for data acquisition of current and voltage supply; wherein one end of the  anode is used for introducing the gas and material while the other end of the anode.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electrode assembly of the subject invention consists of tubular anode and rod shaped cathode. The said electrodes are held in position by bushes also used for electrical connection. The anode (a) and the cathode(c) are mounted on the platform, which is be lifted by rack and pinion arrangement. The angle of inclination between the said electrodes are adjusted by the movement of the bushes. The angle of inclination between anode and the cathode is more<br><br>
than 45°. Gas and material (in powder form ) is introduced from the one end of the said anode and the other end of the said end participates in the arc. The said gases are selected from the group consisting of argon, hydrogen, oxygen, air and the like or the mixture thereof.<br>
The arc is initiated by shorting both electrodes using fuse wire, the fuse wire initiation can be replaced by high frequency spark technique. These methods of arc initiation are well known in the art. The spark then triggers the arc discharge and the material supply will (e) be activated to sustain the arc. The arc voltage and current are measured using digital volt (f) and current meter (g) respectively. The instantaneous current and voltage readings are recorded on to a computer (d) using data acquisition card (ADC card.) Material to be melted or fused (b) or kept below the electrodes.<br>
The said plasma arc is produced between the twin electrodes assembly torch (TEA) inclined to each other (included angle is around 45° ) as shown in figure 2. It is clear from the figure 2 At low included angles i.e. 
Plasma arc produced by (HVAICT) hollow vertical anode and inclined cathode torch as shown in figure 3. Plasma arc has two columns connected by a diffuse column. The said anode arc root anchors on to the periphery of the pipe. Thus the intensity of the visible light emission also peaks periphery resulting in temperature profile (assumed to vary in similar way as visible light from the arc at anode) peaking at periphery of the tube. This hollow temperature profile (gradient towards the center) exerts thermophoretic forces on the particles directed towards the center.<br><br>
Fth=a2<br>
The particles introduced through the center of the anode column get trapped due to thermophoretic forces and melts. Blowing the air through anode increases the heat transfer to gas and it also helps in stabilizing the plasma. Stable operation of the arc needs the melt surface to be at 5 to 6 cm beneath electrodes. However, it does not depend on the the material property thus making torch suitable for ceramic material processing.<br>
The voltage-current (V-l) characteristics of (averaged over long duration) of TEA and HVAICT are given in table 1 below. The electrical characteristics of both TEA and HVAICT nearly remain same. Experiment were carried to investigate the dependence of the arc V-l characterstics with the angle of inclination. The results of the study indicate the angle of inclination does not effect on the performance of the torch. Simultaneous rotational and axial feeding may further improve the stabilization.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Arc Current (Amps)	Twin    Electrodes    Arc voltage (volts) TEA	Hollow Vertical Anode and   Inclined   Cathode Torch     (HVAICT     Arc Voltage) Volts<br>
70	103	104<br>
80	110	95<br>
100	97	117<br>
120	127	117<br>
150	128	126<br>
The results of the study indicates that the angle of inclination does not affect critically on the performance of the torch.   Simultaneous rotation and axial<br><br>
feeding improves the stabilization, the increase in arc current consequently increase the tearing force on anode and cathode arcs jets thus restores large volume arc mode operation. During such operation, the anode arc root localizes at extreme radial location for longer time, causing non-uniform anode surface erosion.<br>
Ocassionally the HVAICT runs short arc mode. Constricted single arc column connecting directly anode and cathode with high audible noise are the features of short arc mode. During the short arc mode operation the arc voltage falls by few tens of volts. Increasing the arc current (few tens of amperes) can restore large volume mode of operation. A shroud (h) is used for covering the cathode (see figure 5) for preventing arc running into short arc mode. Blowing gas through it further decreases the possibility of short arc mode occurrence.<br>
Mechanically rotating the anode or magnetically rotating the anode arc root reduces the non-uniform erosion. The arc fills entire anode inner diameter and arc column appears like cylindrical pipe.<br>
As shown in figure 5, the cathode is provided with gas shroud to increase the stabilization of the arc. The gas shroud helps in localizing the cathode root and reduces the voltage excursions. Further, it also prevents the short the short arc mode operation. Here, the graphite cathode is replaced by water-cooled tungsten rod. The cathode arc column of water cooled tungsten appears much more extended than the one where graphite is used. The structure of anode column and electrical characteristics remains unchanged. Extension of twin electrode assembly to multiple electrode operation is shown in figure 7, where the anode may either be single or multiple electrodes.<br>
The stability and the erosion rate of electrodes is reduced by magnetically rotating the arc as shown in figure 8. There is another configuration of exploiting the hollow anode. Here, the cathode surrounds the anode but the cathode tip is slightly receded. The magnetic filed is used to rotate both<br><br>
anode and cathode arc roots.    Further, it also helps in stabilization by providing conducting path along the field lines.<br>
In order to increase the arc column diameter at anode side, anode with larger inner diameter is used resulting in a marginal arc voltage enhancement due to increased arc length.  To increase the diameter of the arc the diameter of<br><br><br>
