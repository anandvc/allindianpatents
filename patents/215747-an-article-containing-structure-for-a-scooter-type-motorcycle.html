				<td>The present invention relates to an article containing structure for a scooter type motorcycle.<br>
The under-set containing structure for a scooter-type motorcycle has been disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent No. 2710067 entitled "containing Box<br>
Device for Scooter-type vehicle".<br>
The above related art technique will be briefly described with reference to Figs. 2 and 3 of the above document.  In the following description, the reference numerals used in the above document are cited. A containing box 40 is disposed under a driving seat 84 and a shaft for a seat opening/closing hinge is provided in the vicinity of the lower end of a front portion of the driving seat 84, wherein the upper opening of the containing box 40 is opened/closed by opening/closing the driving seat 84. [0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above-described related art containing box 40 has a problem.  In the containing box 40, the peripheral wall is high and the distance from the upper end to the bottom is large. Accordingly, if an article contained in the containing box 40 is small, a driver must look into the containing box 40 for checking the presence of the article and also must extend his hand to the vicinity of the bottom for taking the article from the containing box 40.  That is to say, the related art containing box 40 is poor in usability.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is<br>
to provide a containing box allowing a driver to easily check an article contained therein and to easily take the article therein or therefrom. [0004]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to an invention described in claim 1, there is provided an under-seat containing structure for a scooter-type motorcycle in which a containing box is disposed under a seat and an upper opening of the containing box is opened/closed by opening/closing the seat, characterized in that<br>
a side surface of the seat is formed into an approximately triangular shape by a line of a seat upper surface, a line of a seat lower surface extending forwardly, downwardly from the rear end of the line of the seat upper surface, and a line of a seat front surface extending from the lower end of the line of the seat lower surface to the front end of the line of the seat upper surface;<br>
the line of the seat lower surface is curved in such a manner as to project upwardly, and the edge of the upper opening of the containing box is formed substantially along the line of the seat lower surface;<br>
and<br>
a seat opening/closing hinge portion is provided in the vicinity of the lower end of a front portion of the seat. [0005]<br>
(1)	Since the edge of the upper opening extends<br>
forwardly, downwardly and an upper end of a front wall is<br>
low, the depth of the containing box becomes shallower in<br>
the direction from the rear portion to the front portion<br>
of the containing box.  Accordingly, since the upper end<br>
of the front wall is low and the depth of the front<br>
portion is shallow as described above, an article<br>
contained in the containing box can be easily checked,<br>
and further, a driver can easily extend his hand to a<br>
bottom portion of the containing box. As a result,<br>
according to the containing box, it is easy for the<br>
driver to check an article contained in the containing<br>
box and to take an article into or from the containing<br>
box, and therefore, it is possible to enhance the<br>
usability.<br>
(2)	Since the front portions of the seat side<br>
surfaces extend to the step floor, the driver can extend<br>
his legs along the extended portions. As a result, it<br>
becomes easy for the driver to extend his legs toward the<br>
step floor. This is effective to improve the riding posture of the driver and to enhance the easiness in getting on and out of the motorcycle.<br>
Further, the portions of the seat side surfaces extending to the step floor also serve as knee grips.  In a state in which the driver sits on the seat while holding the extended portions between his both thighs or knees, the center of gravity of the driver is aligned with the center of gravity of the vehicular body.  As a result, by adopting the seat having such a configuration, it is possible to enhance the steerability. [0006] "<br>
According to an invention described in claim 2, seat opening/closing hinge portion is disposed at a height being nearly equal to that of a rear portion of the bottom of the containing box. [0007]<br>
Since the upper end of the front wall of the containing box becomes lower, the longitudinal length of the edge of the upper opening becomes larger. As a result, the upper opening becomes larger, so that it becomes easier for the driver to take an article into or from the containing box. [0008]<br>
According to an invention described in claim 3, covers are integrally formed on side portions of the containing box.<br>
Since the front portions of the seat side surfaces extend downwardly toward the step floor, regions located under the seat and required to cover the side surfaces of the rear portion of the vehicular body are made small, and the covers are provided in such small regions.  Since the covers are integrated with the side portions of the containing box, it is not required to provide separate cover members.  Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the number of parts.  Since the above regions are small, they can be sufficiently covered with the covers integrated with the containing box. [0010]<br>
According to an invention described in claim 4, the containing box is formed by a recycled resin product.  The term "recycled resin product" means a product made from a resin regenerated from resin products having been spent and recovered. [0011]<br>
The material cost of the containing box formed by a recycled resin product is lower than that of the<br>
containing box made from a new material. The covers integrated with the containing box also serve as members for reinforcing the containing box. Since the containing box is reinforced by the covers, even if being made from a recycled resin possibly mixed with slight amounts of impurities, it can ensure a sufficient rigidity.<br>

A scooter-type motorcycle 1 includes at its lower central portion a main frame 2 composed of a frame body serving as a battery containing box. A swing-arm type front suspension system 4 for suspending a front wheel 3 and a steering system 5 separated from the front<br>
suspension system 4 are mounted to a front portion of the main frame 2. A power unit 6 and a rear suspension system 8 for suspending a rear wheel 7 are mounted to a rear portion of the main frame 2. A seat 60 is mounted on an upper rear portion of the main frame 2.<br>
The power unit 6 is of a type using an engine 101 and a motor 130 as a drive source.  In the scooter-type motorcycle 1 of the present invention, a wheel having a large diameter ranging from 14 to 20 inches is used as each of the front wheel 3 and the rear wheel 7. [0013]<br>
The scooter-type motorcycle 1 (hereinafter, referred to simply as a "motorcycle 1") also includes a front fender 11, a front cover 12, a handle cover 13, a leg shield 14 for covering legs of a driver, a step floor 15 on which feet of the driver are to rest, and rear fenders 16F and 16R disposed fore and aft, which are provided in this order from front to rear of the vehicular body.<br>
In Fig. 1, reference numeral 17 designates a mirror; 18 is a handlebar; 19 is a headlamp; 21 is an indicator; 22 is radiator; 23 is a main stand; 24 is a side stand; 25 is a carrier; 26 is a tail lamp, and 39 is a horn.<br>
[0014]<br>
Fig. 2 is a right side view of the scooter-type motorcycle of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 2, an air cleaner 27, a carburetor 28, an exhaust pipe 29, and a muffler 31 are arranged in front of the rear wheel 7.  In addition, the front fender 11 is configured as a movable fender mounted to a steering arm 54 of the steering system 5.  Reference character 31a designates an exhaust port.<br>
[0015]<br>
A front wheel brake for the motorcycle 1, shown in Fig. 2, is configured as a drum brake 83 mounted to an axle holder block (brake panel) 85 for supporting an axle 84.  Reference numeral 86 designates a king pin (bolt) for mounting the front end of a front swing arm 42 to the axle holder block 85; 87 is a knuckle integrally formed on the axle holder block 85; 88 is a brake arm for the drum brake; 89 is brake cable; and 91 is a speed meter cable.<br>
The steering system 5 is configured such that the steering arm 54 is covered, from right and left, with a first cover 92 and a link mechanism 55 is covered, from right and left, with a second cover 93.<br>
The front fender 11 and the first cover 92 are<br>
mounted to the steering arm 54 with bolts or the like, and the second cover 93 is mounted to the steering arm 54 and the axle holder block 85 with bolts or the like.<br>
The brake cable 89, located over the steering arm 54, passes through the first and second covers 92 and 93. The speed meter cable 91, located under the steering arm 54, passes through the first cover 92.  Reference numeral 94 designates a brake operating lever. [0016]<br>
Fig. 3 is a front view of the scooter-type motorcycle of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 3, the outer side surface of the front swing arm 42 of the front suspension system 4 is offset from the outer end of the leg shield 14 to the center of the vehicular body by a distance S. The handlebar 18 and its appearance cover (handle cover) 13 are integrally molded from a recycled resin.  Since the headlamp 19 and the indicators 21 are provided on the front cover 12, it is not required to form openings in the handle cover 13 (see Fig. 1). As a result, the handle cover 13 can be molded from the recycled resin.  The integral molding of both the handlebar 18 and the handle cover 13 is effective to reduce the number of parts.  In Fig. 3, reference character 3a designates a front wheel, and 18a is a grip.<br>
[0017]<br>
Fig. 4 is a left side view of the main frame according to the present invention and its neighborhood.<br>
The arrangement of the power unit 6 and the rear suspension system 8 will be described below. A pivotable frame 32 is provided on an upper rear portion of the main frame 2.  The power unit 6 is vertically swingably mounted on the pivotable frame 32 via a rear pivot 33.  The rear wheel 7 is mounted to the power unit 6.  Seat rails 34 are mounted on the upper rear portion of the main frame 2.  A rear cushion 35 is mounted on the seat rails 34 in such a manner as to be located in front of the rear wheel 7 in Fig. 4.  Further, the rear fender 16F and the seat 60 shown in Fig. 1 and a containing box to be described later are mounted on the seat rails 34.<br>
The pivotable frame 32 serves as a cover for covering the rear portion of the main frame 2. A cover mounting hole 32a is formed in a front portion of the pivotable frame 32, and a radiator cover 36 is mounted in the cover mounting hole 32a.  Since the radiator cover 36 extends downwardly along the line of the front surface of the seat 60 (see Fig. 1), the appearance of the radiator cover 36 is kept desirable, and further, the radiator cover 36 does not interfere with the driver's feet<br>
extending to the step floor 15 located in front of the radiator cover 36.<br>
The combination structure of the main frame 2 disposed at the lower central portion of the motorcycle 1, seat rails 34 located on the upper rear side from the main frame 2, and a head pipe post 51 located on the upper front side from the main frame 2, constitutes a body frame 57. [00181<br>
Fig. 5 is a plan view of the main frame, the front and rear suspension systems, and the steering system according to the present invention.<br>
In the above description with reference to Figs. 1 to 4, the drum brake 83 is used as the front brake for the motorcycle 1. On the contrary, in the following description with reference Figs. 5 to 7, a disk brake 59 is used as the front brake for the motorcycle 1.  In other words, it becomes apparent that any one of the disk brake 59 and the drum brake 83 can be assembled as the front brake for the motorcycle 1 of the present invention. [0019]<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, there is shown a state in which the front swing arm 42 of the front suspension system 4 to be described later extends forwardly from the<br>
front portion of the main frame 2 and the front wheel 3 is supported in a cantilever manner on the front swing arm 42 while the power unit 6 extends rearwardly from the rear portion of the main frame 2 and the rear wheel 7 is supported in a cantilever manner by the power unit 6.<br>
Since the front swing arm 42 is offset from the center C of the vehicular body onto one side (right side) and the power unit 6 is offset from the center C of the vehicular body onto the other side (left side), the motorcycle 1 has a good balance of weight in the width direction of the vehicular body. [0020]<br>
The main frame 2 is composed of right and left side members 2c provided on both sides of the vehicular body in such a manner as to extend in the longitudinal direction of the vehicular body.  Front ends of the right and left side members 2c are joined to each other by means of a front cross member 2d, and rear ends of the right and left side members 2c are joined to each other by means of a rear cross member 2e formed into a gate shape in a rear view.<br>
The pivotable frame 32 is a member having a specific thickness and being formed into an approximately U-shape in a plan view.  The pivotable frame 32 is formed<br>
integrally with the main frame 2 or fixed to the main<br>
frame 2 with bolts or the like.<br>
[0021]<br>
Fig. 6 is a left side view of the main frame, the front suspension system, and the steering system according to the present invention.<br>
The front suspension system 4 is configured such that the front swing arm 42 formed into an inverse U-shape in a side view extends from the lower front portion of the main frame 2 via a front pivot 41, and the front wheel 3 is rotatably mounted to the front swing arm 42. To be more specific, a knuckle 43 mounted to the front wheel 3 is mounted to the leading end of the front swing arm 42 in such a manner as to be turnable right and left. [0022]<br>
The front suspension system 4 includes a cushion member 44 for moderating shock (from a road surface) in the swinging direction of the front swing arm 42, and a front damper 45 for reducing the amplitude of vibration in the swinging direction of the front swing arm 42, wherein the cushion member 44 is separated from the front damper 45.<br>
To be more specific, the cushion member (resin spring) 44 for moderating shock in the swinging direction<br>
of the front swing arm 42 is interposed between the main frame 2 and the front swing arm 42, and the front damper 45 is mounted between the main frame 2 and the front swing arm 42. The resin spring 44 is configured as an elastic resin block exhibiting a spring action. [0023]<br>
More specifically, the front damper 45 is mounted by supporting one end of the front damper 45 on the right side (back side in Fig. 6) of the base portion of the head pipe post 51 to be described later by means of a pivot 46, and supporting the other end of the front damper 45 on the left side of the top portion of the front swing arm 42 by means of a pivot 47.  The one end of the front damper 45 may be directly mounted on the main frame 2. [0024]<br>
The steering system 5 is configured such that the head pipe post 51 extends obliquely, upwardly from the upper front portion of the main frame 2 and a head pipe 52 is fixed to the leading end of the head pipe post 51; a handle post 53 is rotatably mounted to the head pipe 52 and the steering arm 54 is mounted to the lower end of the handle post 53; and the leading end' (lower end) of the steering arm 54 is connected to the knuckle 43 via<br>
the link mechanism 55. "[0025]<br>
The link mechanism 55 is composed of a first link 55a connected to the leading end of the steering arm 54 and a second link 55b connected to the knuckle 43. The link mechanism 55 is disposed in the wheel portion of the front wheel 3 having a relatively large diameter.<br>
Since the link mechanism 55 is disposed in the wheel portion of the front wheel 3, it is possible to make effective use of the space in the wheel portion of the front wheel 3.  Since a space positioned under and behind the head pipe 52 can be sufficiently ensured, it is possible to enhance the degree of freedom in design of the motorcycle 1 and to sufficiently ensure a space for the step floor 15 (see Fig. 1) . [0026]<br>
As described above, the front suspension system 4 is of the swing arm type and is configured such that a large load applied from the front wheel 3 is received by the main frame 2 having a large rigidity via the front swing arm 42 and the front pivot 41, so that a large load from the front wheel 3 can be certainly, effectively<br>
received by the main frame 2. Accordingly, a large load is not applied to the head pipe post 51.<br>
A large load from the front wheel 3 can be also received by the main frame 2 having a high rigidity via the front pivot 41. [0027]<br>
In Fig. 6, reference numeral 37 designates a front brake disk and 38 is a caliper mounted to the knuckle 43; and reference character Ba designates a plurality of batteries for supplying an electric power to the motor 130 shown in Fig. 1. [0028]<br>
Fig. 7 is a plan view of the main frame, the front suspension system, and the steering system, in which the link mechanism 55 is shown in development.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the front swing arm 42 extends forwardly from the right front portion of the main frame 2 via the front pivot 41 while curving rightwardly in such a manner as to bypass the front wheel 3; and the steering arm 54 extends forwardly from the lower end of the handle post 53 located at the center C (center line) of the vehicular body while curving rightwardly in such a manner as to bypass the front wheel 3. [0029]<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 7, the center of the head pipe post 51 is offset from the center C of the vehicular<br>
body onto one side (left side) by a distance L, and the front damper 45 is disposed in such a manner as to be offset from the center C of the vehicular body onto the other side (right side) and adjacent to the head pipe post 51 and to extend in parallel to the center C of the vehicular body. Accordingly, since the front damper 45 is made as close to the center C of the vehicular body as possible, the bending moment applied to the front damper 45 can be made as small as possible. As a result, it is possible to make small the strength of the front damper 45 and hence to miniaturize the front damper 45.  In this way, the above swing arm mechanism can be desirably arranged at the front portion of the motorcycle 1 having a large limitation in terms of space.<br>
The resin spring 44 is disposed at the center C of the vehicular body.  Reference character 38a designates a piston, and 38b is a brake pad. [0030]<br>
Fig. 8 is a perspective exploded view of the main frame, the front suspension system, and the steering system according to the present invention.<br>
The configuration of the front suspension system 4 and the steering system 5 will be described in detail with reference to Fig. 8.  A supporting pipe 42a of the<br>
front swing arm 42 is mounted to the front pivot 41 via right and left bearings 2a. A holding plate 49 is connected to connecting portions 42c formed on a plate portion 42b of the front swing arm 42 with upper and lower bolts B2.  The resin spring 44 is held between the back surface of the plate portion 42b and the holding plate 49. A mounting plate 48 is inserted in a mounting hole 44a of the resin spring 44.  The right and left ends of the mounting plate 48 are mounted to mounting portions 2b of the main frame 2 with bolts B3. The head pipe post 51 is mounted on the upper front portion of the main frame 2 with bolts Bl.  One end of the front damper 45 is supported on the base portion of the head pipe post 51 via the pivot 46, and the other end of the front damper 45 is supported on the top portion of the front swing arm<br>
42	via the pivot 47.  The head pipe 52 is provided at the<br>
leading end of the head pipe post 51, and the handle post<br>
53 is turnably mounted on the head pipe 52 .  A steering<br>
arm 54 is mounted at the lower end of the handle post 53,<br>
and the link mechanism 55 is connected to the leading end<br>
of the steering arm 54.<br>
The front swing arm 42 has, at its leading end, stem retainers 42d for mounting a stem 43a of the knuckle<br>
43	in such a manner that the stem 43a is turnable right<br><br>
and left.<br>
In general, the caster angle of a steering is slightly changed depending on the kind of motorcycle, and therefore, a body frame of a type being formed integrally with a head pipe must be changed into a new one for each alteration of the caster angle.<br>
On the contrary, the motorcycle 1 of the present invention is of the type in which the main frame 2 is provided separately from the head pipe post 51.  To be more specific, the main frame 2 is of the frame structure serving as the battery containing box in order to enhance the degree of general purpose and is formed by casting of ah aluminum alloy in order to enhance the rigidity; and the head pipe post 51 is mounted such a main frame 2 by means of the bolts Bl . With adoption of the above structure, if the kind of motorcycle is changed, only the head pipe post 51 may be exchanged while the main frame 2 be commonly used.  This makes it possible to enhance the degree of freedom in design. [0032]<br>
Fig. 9 is a perspective view of an essential portion of the rear portion of the scooter-type motorcycle of the present invention.<br>
The outer shape of the seat 60 will be described below.  The seat 60, formed into a shape with its front portion extending downwardly with respect to the rear portion, has a seat upper surface 61 on which a driver M is to sit; a seat front surface 62 continuous to the seat upper surface 61; right and left seat side surfaces 63; a seat rear side surface 64 continuous to the rear portions of the seat side surfaces 63; and a seat rear surface (not shown).<br>
The seat upper surface 61 has a taper shape in a plan view. As a result, each of the seat side surfaces 63 is formed into a taper shape in which the upper front corner becomes narrow.  Since the front portions of the seat side surfaces 63 extend to the step floor 15 and the upper front corners of the seat side surfaces 63 each have a narrow taper shape, the driver M can extend his legs along the extended front portions, that is, the extensions 66 of the seat side surfaces 63.  As a result, it becomes easy for the driver M to extend toward the step floor 15.  This is effective to improve the riding posture of the driver M and to enhance the easiness in getting on and out of the motorcycle 1.<br>
The extensions 66 also serve as knee grips.  In a state in which the driver M sits on the seat 60 while<br>
holding the extensions 66 between his both thighs or knees, the center of gravity of the driver M is aligned with the center of gravity of the vehicular body. As a result, by adopting the seat 60 having such a configuration, it is possible to enhance the steerability. [0033]<br>
Fig. 10 is a front view of the seat according to the present invention and its neighborhood, showing the taper shape of each seat side surface 63 in which the upper front corner of the seat side surface 63 is narrow. [0034]<br>
Fig. 11 is a left side view of the rear portion of the scooter-type motorcycle of the present invention.<br>
The rear portion of the motorcycle 1 includes the containing box 70 and a fuel tank 81 which are arranged fore and aft under the seat 60.<br>
As is apparent from Fig. 11, the seat side surface 63 is formed into an approximately triangular shape by a line 63a of the seat upper surface, a line 63b of the seat lower surface extending forwardly, downwardly from the rear end of the line 63a of the seat upper surface, and a line 63c of the seat front surface extending from the lower end of the line 63b of the seat lower surface to the front end of the line 63a of the seat upper<br>
surface.  The line 63b of the seat lower surface is curved in such a manner as to project upwardly.<br>
Here, (1) the line 63a of the seat upper surface is the same line as the outline of the seat upper surface 61 or a line extending substantially along the outline of the seat upper surface 61; (2) the line 63b of the seat lower surface is the same line as the outline of a plane of the lower end 67 of the seat side portion or a line extending substantially along the outline of the plane of the lower end 67; and (3) the line 63c of the seat front surface is the same line as the outline of the seat front surface 62 or a line extending substantially along the outline of the seat front surface 62. [0035]<br>
The containing box 70, which is a box-like member opened upwardly, is configured such that the edge of an upper opening 71 is formed in such a manner as to extend substantially along the line 63b of the seat lower surface in a side view and a seat opening/closing hinge portion 72 is provided in the vicinity of the front portion of the seat 60.  A helmet H or the like is contained in the containing box 70.  In Fig. 11, reference numeral 65 designates the rear surface of the seat, and reference character 81a designates ail oiling port.<br>
[0036]<br>
Fig. 12 is a sectional view taken on line 12-12 of Fig. 11, showing a state in which right and left covers 74 are integrally formed on side walls 73 of the containing box 70.<br>
Base portions 74a of the covers 74 are integrally formed on portions, slightly lower than the lower end 67 of the side portions of the seat 60, of the side walls 73 of the containing box 70.  The covers 74 thus integrally formed on the side walls 73 extend from the side walls 73 to the step floor 15 in such a manner as to cover the rear portion of the vehicular body.  The extended ends 74b of the covers 74 are substantially in contact with or overlapped to the upper ends 32b of the pivotable frame 32. [0037]<br>
Incidentally, the containing box 70 and the covers 74 integrated therewith are formed by a recycled resin product.  The term "recycled resin product" means a product made from a resin regenerated from resin products having been spent and recovered.  The material cost of the containing box 70 integrated with the covers 74, which is formed by a recycled resin product, is lower than that of the containing box 70 integrated with the covers 74,<br>
which is made from a new material. The outer surfaces of the covers 74 can be subjected to surface-treatment such as paining as needed. Accordingly, although the containing box 70 integrated with the covers 74 is formed by a recycled resin product, the appearance characteristic of the covers 74, which are integrally formed on the containing box 70 in such a manner as to cover the containing box 70, can be enhanced by the surface-treatment.<br>
The covers 74 integrated with the containing box 70 also serve as members for reinforcing the containing box 70.  Since the containing box 70 is reinforced by the covers 74, even if being made from a recycled resin possibly mixed with slight amounts of impurities, it can ensure a sufficient rigidity. [0038]<br>
Fig. 13 is a left side view of the containing box according to the present invention, showing the state in which an edge 71a of the upper opening 71 extends substantially along the line 63b of the seat lower surface, that is, along the lower end 67 of the side portion of the seat 60.<br>
In the containing box 70, since the edge 71a of the upper opening 71 extends forwardly, downwardly and an<br>
upper end 75a of a front wall 75 is low, the depth of the containing box 70 becomes shallower in the direction from the rear portion to the front portion of the containing box 70. Accordingly, since the upper end 75a of the front wall 75 is low and the depth of the front portion is shallow as described above, an article contained in the containing box 70 can be easily checked, and further, the driver can easily extend his hand to a bottom portion 76 of the containing box 70. As a result, according to the containing box 70, it is easy for the driver to check an article contained in the containing box 70 and to take an article into or from the containing box 70, and therefore, it is possible to enhance the usability. More specifically, the containing box 70 is advantageous in that it is easy for the driver to take not only a large article such as a helmet but also a small article into or from the containing box 70. [0039]<br>
Since the front portions of the seat side surfaces 63 extend downwardly toward the step floor, regions located under the seat 60 and required to cover the side surfaces of the rear portion of the vehicular body are made small, and the covers 74 are provided in such small regions. The covers 74, which have the base (root)<br>
portions 74a formed along the lower ends 67 of the side portions of the seat 60, extend downwardly.<br>
Since the covers 74 are integrated with the side walls 73 of the containing box 70, it is not required to provide separate cover members. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the number of parts.  Since the above regions are small, they can be sufficiently covered with the covers 74 integrated with the containing box 70. [0040]<br>
Fig. 14 is a sectional side view of the containing box according to the present invention. As shown in Fig. 14, the seat opening/closing hinge portion 72 is disposed at a height being nearly equal to that of a rear portion 76a of the bottom portion 76 of the containing box 70.<br>
Since the upper end 75a of the front wall 75 of the containing box 70 becomes lower, the longitudinal length of the edge 71a of the upper opening 71 becomes larger. As a result, the upper opening 71 becomes larger, so that it becomes easier for the driver to take an article into or from the containing box 70. [0041]<br>
Fig. 15 is a schematic view of the rear portion of the scooter type motorcycle of the present invention, in which the main frame 2, the step floor 15, the pivotable<br>
frame 32, the seat 60, and the covers 74 are hatched.<br>
The lower rear portion of the vehicular body is covered with the pivotable frame 32 integrated with the main frame 2; the rear side portion of the vehicular body is covered with the covers 74 integrated with the containing box (not shown); and the upper rear portion of the vehicular body is covered with the seat 60 with its front portion extending to the step floor 15.  The outer side surface of the main frame 2, the outer side surface of the pivotable frame 32, and the outer surfaces of the covers 74 constitute the appearance designing surface of the scooter-type motorcycle, that is, they serve as a body cover of the motorcycle, to thereby enhance the appearance characteristic of the rear portion of the motorcycle.  As a result, it is possible to eliminate the necessity of covering the rear portion of the vehicular body and hence to reduce the number of parts. [0042]<br>
Fig. 16 is a sectional side view of the power unit according to the present invention.<br>
The power unit 6, which includes a four-cycle engine having two intake/exhaust cam shafts in a cylinder head as will be described with reference to Fig. 18, is configured such that a crank shaft 106 is disposed in a<br>
lower portion of a power unit case 105; a clutch shaft<br>
107	is disposed in parallel to and above the crank shaft<br>
106; and a transmission shaft 108 and a motor shaft 109<br>
are provided at one end of the clutch shaft 107 in such a<br>
manner as to extend in the longitudinal direction of<br>
vehicular body.  The clutch shaft 107, the transmission<br>
shaft 108, and the motor shaft 109 are connected in<br>
series to each other and are located in parallel to and<br>
above the crank shaft 106.<br>
[0043]<br>
Since the clutch shaft 107, the transmission shaft<br>
108	and the motor shaft 109 are arranged in series in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the vehicular body, it is<br>
possible to simplify the direction in which a force is<br>
applied to the power unit case 105.  To be more specific,<br>
the power unit case 105 can be designed to have a high<br>
rigidity in the direction in which a force is applied<br>
thereto and to have a small rigidity in the direction in<br>
which a force is not applied thereto. Accordingly, in<br>
proportion to simplification of the direction in which a<br>
force is applied to the power unit case 105, the weight<br>
of the power unit case 105 can be made smaller. As a<br>
result, it is possible to make compact the power unit<br>
case 105.<br>
[0044]<br>
In Fig. 16, reference numeral 125 designates a planetary gear reducer, and 126 is a potentiometer for detecting the rotational angle of a transmission control motor 145 to be described later.  Reference numeral 161 is a cam shaft drive pulley; 128 is a water pump driven by the pulley 161; and 129 is a belt cover. Reference character 153a is an oil pump case which is shown at the lower central position in the figure.<br>
[0045]<br>
A primary drive gear 111, a primary driven gear 112, a centrifugal clutch 117, a transmission 120, and the motor shaft 109 (in the case where the motor 130 is not operated) constitute a "power transmission system from the engine", and the motor shaft 109 at the time when the motor 130 is operated constitutes a "power transmission system from the motor".  The details of components of the clutch shaft 107, the transmission shaft 108 and the motor shaft 109 will be described with reference to Fig. 17 .<br>
[0046]<br>
Fig. 17 is a sectional plan view of the power unit according to the present invention.  The details of the components and the transmission form of a drive force<br>
will be described with reference to Fig. 17.<br>
The primary drive gear 111 of the crank shaft 106 drives the primary driven gear 112 rotatably mounted to the clutch shaft 107. The primary driven gear 112 drives a clutch outer 114 of a one-way clutch 113 for a starter and a clutch inner 118 of the centrifugal clutch 117 independently from the clutch shaft 107.  To be more specific, the primary driven gear 112 is connectable to the clutch outer 114 of the one-way clutch 113 for the starter and the clutch inner 118 of the centrifugal clutch 117 by means of a cylindrical member 116.  When the centrifugal clutch inner 118 is rotated at a specific rotational number or more, the clutch outer 119 of the centrifugal clutch 117 is rotated, so that the clutch 107 is rotated.<br>
The primary drive gear 111 includes a backlash-less gear 111a and a spring lllb for preventing occurrence of hammering sound. [0047]<br>
The transmission 120 is a cone-type continuously variable transmission whose function will be described in detail with reference to Fig. 18.  The transmission 120 is used for transmitting a power in the order of the transmission shaft 108, an inner disk 121, a cone 122,<br>
and an outer cup 123, and for transmitting the rotation to the motor shaft 109 via a one-way clutch 133.<br>
The motor 130, which is a coreless motor, is configured such that a permanent magnet type rotor 131 is mounted to the motor shaft 109 and a stator coil 132 is mounted to a motor case 105d.<br>
Accordingly, when the centrifugal clutch 117 is turned on, the drive force is transmitted in the order of the clutch shaft 107, the transmission shaft 108, the transmission 120, and the motor shaft 109, to drive an axle 140 via a multi-disk type torque limiter 134 and a gear reduction mechanism 135 (composed of a small gear 136, a large gear 137, a small gear 138, and a large gear 139) . [0048]<br>
The multi-disk type limiter 134 is composed of a limiter inner 134a rotated together with the motor shaft 109, disks 134b and 134c, a limiter outer 134d, and a spring 134e.  The disk 134b is attached to the limiter inner 134a and the disk 134c is attached to the limiter outer 134d.  The small gear 136 is integrated with the limiter outer 134d.<br>
The power is transmitted in the order of the limiter inner 134, the disk 134b, the disk 134c, the<br>
limiter outer 134d, and the small gear 136.  If an excess torque over a setting torque is applied to the multi-disk type torque limiter 134, there occurs a slippage between the disk 134b and the disk 134c, to protect the multi-disk type torque limiter 134.  The setting torque can be adjusted by the spring 134e. [0049]<br>
In addition, the one-way clutch outer 114 for a starter acts as a flywheel, and it includes a balance weight 141 for keeping a good engine balance.  The one-way clutch outer 114 for the starter is combined with the one-way clutch inner 115 for the starter, to constitutthe one-way clutch 113.<br>
When a starter driven gear 143 is rotated by the starter (not shown), the centrifugal clutch inner 118 is rotated via the one-way clutch inner 115 for the starter and the one-way clutch outer 114 for the starter, so that the engine is started.  If the one-way clutch outer 114 for the starter is rotated at a high speed, it is separated from the one-way clutch inner 115 for the starter on the low speed side. [0050]<br>
In Fig. 17, the cam shaft drive pulley 161 for driving the cam shaft and the like is provided at the<br>
other end (front end) of the crank shaft 106, and the belt 162 is driven by the pulley 161.  The details of the pulley 161 and the belt 162 will be described later. [0051]<br>
Fig. 18 is a front view of the power unit, showing a cam shaft drive mechanism as a valve system drive mechanism according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 18, a left crank case 105a is mounted to the right side of a cylinder block 169B integrated with a right crank case 105b.  The motor 130 is disposed over the crank shaft 106. A cylinder head 169H is mounted to the left side of the cylinder block 169B. The muffler 31 is mounted to the leading end of the exhaust pipe 29 extending from the cylinder head 169H. An intake manifold 169M connected to an air cleaner 27 (shown at the upper left corner in Fig. 18) is connected to the cylinder head 169H via the carburetor 28. Reference character 169S designates a hole for mounting a starter motor. [0052]<br>
In the state shown in Fig. 18, since the belt cover 129 (see Fig. 16) is removed, a cam shaft drive mechanism 160 as a valve system drive mechanism can be viewed in front of the power unit 6.  The cam shaft drive mechanism<br>
160 is composed of the cam shaft drive pulley 161, a belt 162, an intake side cam shaft pulley 163, an exhaust side cam shaft pulley 164, and a tensioner 165. [0053]<br>
As is apparent from Fig. 18, since the power unit is arranged in the width direction of the vehicular body with the cylinder shaft 166 directed substantially in the horizontal direction (for example, at a tilt angle CL - + 10 with respect to the ground), the center of gravity of the power unit can be made lower and the length of the cylinder can be set within the width of the vehicular body, with a result that the degree of freedom in design can be enhanced. [0054]<br>
The power unit shown in Fig. 18 is viewed in the direction from the front wheel to the rear wheel, in which the crank shaft 106 and the clutch shaft 107 are offset onto the right side from the center C of the vehicular body and the cylinder head 169H is offset onto the left side from the center C of the vehicular body.  On the back side of the paper plane of Fig. 18, the "power transmission system" composed of the transmission shaft 108, the motor shaft 109, and the like shown in Figs. 16 and 17 is connected to the clutch shaft 107.<br>
[0055]<br>
In Fig. 18, the cylinder head 169H including two cam shafts (not shown) and the like, which is sufficiently heavy, acts as a counter weight balanced against the power unit case 105 including the crank shaft 106, the clutch shaft 107 and the like disposed on the right side. Accordingly, it is possible to easily eliminate the unbalance on the right and left sides.<br>
[0056]'<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 1, a side surface of the seat is formed into an approximately triangular shape by a line of a seat upper surface, a line of a seat lower surface extending forwardly, downwardly from the rear end of the line of the seat upper surface, and a line of a seat front surface extending from the lower end of the line of the seat lower surface to the front end of the line of the seat upper surface; the line of the seat lower surface is curved in such a manner as to project upwardly, and the edge of the upper opening of the containing box is formed substantially along the line of the seat lower surface; and a seat opening/closing hinge portion is provided in the vicinity of the lower end of a front portion of the<br>
seat.  Accordingly, since the edge of the upper opening of the containing box extends forwardly, downwardly and an upper end of a front wall of the containing box is low, the depth of the containing box becomes shallower in the direction from the rear portion to the front portion of the containing box. Accordingly, since the upper end of the front wall is low and the depth of the front portion is shallow, an article contained in the containing box can be easily checked, and further, the driver can easily extend his hand to a bottom of the containing box. As a result, according to the containing box, it is easier for the driver to check an article contained in the containing box and to take an article into or from the containing box, and therefore, it is possible to enhance the usability. [0057]<br>
The front portion of the seat is lower than the rear portion thereof and is formed into an approximately triangular shape in a side view.  Accordingly, since the front portions of the seat side surfaces extend to the step floor, the driver can extend his legs along the extended portions.  As a result, it becomes easy for the driver to extend toward the step floor.  This is effective to improve the riding posture of the driver and to<br>
enhance the easiness in getting on and out of the motorcycle.<br>
Further, the portions of the seat side surfaces extending to the step floor also serve as knee grips.  In a state in which the driver sits on the seat while holding the extended portions between his both thighs or knees, the center of gravity of the driver is aligned with the center of gravity of the vehicular body. As a result, by adopting the seat having such a configuration, it is possible to enhance the steerability.<br>
[0058]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, seat opening/closing hinge portion is disposed at a height being nearly equal to that of a rear portion of the bottom of the containing box.  Accordingly, since the upper end of the front wall of the containing box becomes lower, the longitudinal length of the edge of the upper opening becomes larger. As a result, the upper opening becomes larger, so that it becomes easier for the driver to take an article into or from the containing box.<br>
[0059]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 3, covers are integrally formed on side portions of the containing box. Accordingly, it is possible to eliminate<br>
the necessity of provision of any separate cover members, and hence to reduce the number of parts.<br>
Since the front portions of the seat side surfaces extend downwardly toward the step floor, regions located under the seat and required to cover the side surfaces of the rear portion of the vehicular body are made small, and they can be sufficiently covered with the covers. [0060]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 4, the containing box is formed by a recycled resin product, and accordingly, the material cost of the containing box formed by a recycled resin product is lower than that of the containing box made from a new material.<br>
The covers integrated with the containing box also serve as members for reinforcing the containing box. Since the containing box is reinforced by the covers, even if being made from a recycled resin possibly mixed with slight amounts of impurities, it can ensure a sufficient rigidity.<br>
