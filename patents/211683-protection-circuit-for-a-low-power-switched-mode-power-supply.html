FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The prtstnt invention relates to a protection circuit for a<br>
switched mode power supply, which comprises a switching transistor<br>
and a transformer with a primary winding and an auxiliary winding<br>
for providing a supply voltage for driving the switching<br>
transistor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A switched mode power supply of this kind is known for<br>
example from EP-A-0 936 726, which discloses self oscillating<br>
switched mode power supplies operating in a flyback mode.<br>
Specifically, EP-A-0 936 726 shows a switched mode power supply<br>
with a HOSFET as a switching transistor and a gate driver circuit<br>
comprising a charge capacitor being coupled via a diode to an<br>
auxiliary winding for providing a supply voltage for the gate<br>
driver circuit. It comprises further a threshold circuit, which<br>
keeps the gate driver circuit turned off after the switching-on<br>
of the switched mode power supply, until the sypply voltage of<br>
the driver circuit has exceeded a specific threshold value with<br>
respect to the auxiliary winding. It comprises also an opto—<br>
coupler for providing a regulating voltage from the secondary<br>
side of the power supply for the gate driver circuit for<br>
stabilizing output voltages.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the prtsmt invention is therefore, to provide<br>
a protection circuit, which works also reliably within a low<br>
power switched mode power supply, and to provide a respective<br>
switched mode power supply.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The protection circuit of the prevent invention comprises a<br>
clamping circuit with a switching element for reducing said<br>
supply voltage in case of a failure, especially in case of an<br>
overvoltage condition, and a holding circuit for providing ,<br>
holding current for said clamping circuit. With the holding<br>
current the switch-off time in case of a failure is extended<br>
which avoids therefore an immediate start-up of the power supply<br>
when the supply voltage is reduced* and which would lead to a<br>
hiccup stage.<br>
The clamping circuit comprises advantageously a threshold<br>
circuit, which provides a switching voltage for the switching<br>
element when the supply voltage reaches an upper voltage limit.<br>
The switching element is connected to a charge capacitor which<br>
provides the supply voltage for the switching transistor* and by<br>
reducing this supply voltage the switching of the switching<br>
transistor is disabled.<br>
The holding circuit comprises in particular a capacitor<br>
which is coupled via a resistor to the clamping circuit,<br>
especially to the threshold circuit, for providig an additional<br>
current also in a failure mode. In a special embodiment the<br>
capacitor of the holding circuit is connected via a rectifying<br>
element to an auxiliary winding of the transformer, but can be<br>
coupled also to another input voltage of the power supply.<br>
The protection circuit may be used especially for a switched<br>
mode power supply comprising a transformer with a primary winding<br>
and an auxiliary winding, and a switching transistor which is<br>
coupled to said primary winding and which is in operating a flyback<br>
mode. It works not only in power supplies with low power<br>
applications but also in power supplies providing high output<br>
power. For smaller switched mode supply supplies, it is<br>
especially advantageous to use a MOSFET as a switching transistor<br>
and the clamping circuit therefore disables directly the gate<br>
drive of the MOSFET in case of an over voltage condition. Low<br>
power supplies for example with an output power of 30 Watts can be<br>
used for example as a second power supply within appliances of<br>
consumer electronics products.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below by way of a<br>
preferred embodiment, with reference to schematic circuit<br>
diagrams, in which :<br>
Figure 1: A circuit with a Zener diode for providing an<br>
overvoltage protection for a switched mode power supply, and<br>
Figure 2: A protection circuit with a clamping circuit<br>
and a holding circuit according to the invention.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
EP-A-0936726 discloses a switched mode power supply as<br>
described herein before, which contains a protection circuit*<br>
shown in Fig. 1. It comprises a switching transistor T20, which<br>
is connected with its current input to a primary winding Wl of a<br>
transformer* not shown, and with its curret output via a resistor<br>
R20 to ground. The primary winding Wl is coupled in the usual<br>
manner to a rectifying element BR, which provides a rectified<br>
voltage from the mains voltage UM.<br>
The transformer comprise further an auxiliary winding W2<br>
for providing a supply voltage Vcc. The voltage Vcc is a<br>
rectified and smoothed voltage, rectified via dieodes 025 and D26<br>
which are connected to a terminal 3 of the auxiliary Minding 2,<br>
and stabilized via compacitors C25 and C24 and a Zener diode<br>
D27. The power supply comprises further a start-up circuit with<br>
resistors R5, R6, R7 being connected to the capacitors C25 cuit<br>
GD.<br>
The gate driver circuit 6D controls a transistor T25 which<br>
is coupled to the supply voltage Vcc for providing a switching-on<br>
voltage to the control electrode of the switching transistor T20<br>
via resistors R21, R27 for switching through this transistor. Via<br>
the gate driver circuit 8D the output voltages of the power<br>
supply are stabilized, a control circuit of this kind is<br>
explained for example in EP-A-0 936 726.<br>
The base of transistor T25, together with the gate driver<br>
circuit GD, is connected to a threshold circuit with a Zener<br>
diode D23 and resistors R24, R26 for keeping the transistor T27<br>
off after switching-on of the power supply, until the supply<br>
voltage Vcc has reached a sufficiently high voltage value for the<br>
start-up of the power supply. The power supply comprises further<br>
small capacitors C23 and C26 to suppress voltage spikes of the<br>
corresponding diodes.<br>
The Zener diodes D27 of Fig. 1 provides also an over voltage<br>
protection for the power supply. In a failure mode, when the<br>
output voltage at the auxiliary winding W2 shoots up, the voltage<br>
Vcc at capacitors C24, C25 will also rise accordingly, but is<br>
clamped by the Zener diode D27, in this embodiment to 20 Volts.<br>
Therefore, the current flowing through Zener diode D27 will<br>
increase which will finally kill this diode when reaching a<br>
certain current value. Once the Zener diode 027 is destroyed, it<br>
will become short circuted, which will shut off the switched mode<br>
power supply immediately because the supply voltage Vcc drops.<br>
The switched mode power supply of Fig. 1 has also an under-<br>
drive protection, which ensures that there is always a sufficient<br>
gate drive for switching through the switching transistor T20<br>
even during a failure condition. This requirement is necessary<br>
due to safety reasons. This problem is solved in that two diodes<br>
025, 026 and two capacitors C24, C23 are arranged each in<br>
parallel, to provide always a supply voltage Vcc, even when one<br>
of the diodes or one of the capacitors is open circuited.<br>
The over voltage protection as described before is only<br>
working in switched mode power supplies with higher output power,<br>
for example, 70 Watts, but not with switched mode power supplies<br>
limited to about 30 Watts, because then the current flowing<br>
through the Zencr diodes D27 is too low to destroy the Zener<br>
diode in case of an over voltage failure mode. In this case the<br>
output voltages of the power supply will continue to rise and<br>
this will damage the respective components of the device, for<br>
example capacitors and integrated circuits.<br>
In Figure 2 the primary side of a switched mode power supply<br>
is shown with a MOSFET as a switching transistor T2O, which is<br>
coupled with the current input to a primary minding Wl of a<br>
transformer (not shown) and with a current output via resistor<br>
R20 to ground. Other types of switching transistors can be used<br>
accordingly. To the other end of the primary winding Wl a DC<br>
voltage is coupled in a known manner which is provided in this<br>
embodiment from the mains voltage UM via a rectifying element BR.<br>
To the rectifying BR also the start—up circuit with resstors R5t<br>
R6 and R7 is coupled.<br>
The control input of the switching transistor T2O is<br>
controlled via a transistor T25, which is connected with its<br>
current input to a supply voltage Vcc. The supply voltage Vcc is<br>
provided from the auxiliary winding W2 of the transformer via a<br>
rectifying element D2S and is smoothed via a charge capacitor C25.<br>
A gat driver circuit GD, shown only schematically provides<br>
switching pulses for the transistor T25 for regulating the output<br>
voltages of the power supply.<br>
When the transistor T25 is switched through, the supply<br>
voltage Vcc is coupled via resistors R21 and R27 to the gate<br>
electrode of the switching transistor T20, nd when transistor T2S<br>
closes* the switching transistor T20 is also closed via the gate<br>
driver circuit 60.<br>
The basic components of the switched mode power supply as<br>
shown in figure 2 is similar to the circuit as already described<br>
according to figure 1, and which operating principles are<br>
described in detail in EPA-0 936 726. Circuit components in<br>
Figure 2 which are the same as in the Figure 1 have same<br>
reference numbers.<br>
To the charge capacitor C2S a clamping circuit CL is coupled<br>
for providing an overvoltage protection. It comprises a switching<br>
element T2i, in this embodiment a thryristor, which disables the<br>
gate drive of the switching transistor T20 when switched through,<br>
in that the supply voltage Vcc is connected to ground. The<br>
control electrode of the switching element T21 is controlled via<br>
a threshold circuit with a Zener diode D24 and a transistor R38<br>
which provides a switching voltage Ue when the supply voltage Vcc<br>
exceeds a certain threshold , in this example 20 Volts. When the<br>
Zener diode D24 starts conducting, the control voltage Ue shoots<br>
up and triggers the switching element T21. The control electrode<br>
of the switching element T21 is coupled via a resistor R39 and a<br>
capacitor C28 in parallel to ground for disabling the control<br>
voltage Ue when the Zener diode 024 stops conducting.<br>
When the supply voltage Vcc drops below the threshold value<br>
of the threshold circuit D24, R38, then also the control voltage<br>
Ue drops which closes the switching element T21. Then the power<br>
supply will start-up again andt when the overvoltage condition<br>
still appears« will shut down again when the threshold value is<br>
exceeded. In this case the power supply would be in a hiccup<br>
stage which would be an additional stress for the power supply and<br>
would make a switching sound which could he heard by a user.<br>
To suppress this hiccup stage, the power supply comprises a<br>
holding circuit HO. This holding circuit provides an additional<br>
current for the clamping circuit CL to turn the switching element<br>
T21 on for a longer period. The holding circuit HO comprises a<br>
capacitor C37 in which a charge is stored during normal operation<br>
and which is connected to the clamping circuit CL via a resistor<br>
R37. In this embodiment the capacitor 37 is coupled to the<br>
auxiliary winding W2 of the transformer, but it can be coupled<br>
also to another part of the power supply, for example to the<br>
start-up circuit. With the additional holding current, the<br>
annoying switching sound of the hiccup state is modified to a<br>
more smoother tone.<br>
The clamping circuit CL is very sensitive to an overvoltage<br>
condition of the supply voltage Vcc because of the threshold<br>
circuit D24, R38 and the switching element T21. It provides<br>
therefore an overvoltage protection for switched mode power<br>
supplies with high output power as well as for swiched mode power<br>
supplies with the low output power. In addition, the clamping<br>
circuit CL together with the holding circuit HO provide also an<br>
under drive protection, as can be seen from Figure 2. In the case<br>
the diode D25 is open circuited, the power suply has the<br>
additional current path via D37 and R37 to charge the charge<br>
capacitor C2S. And in the case capacitor C2S is open circuited,<br>
the capacitor C37 is available to provide the necessary gat,<br>
drive voltage for the switching transistor T20. Therefore, with a<br>
few additional components a reliable circuit is provided which<br>
provides an overvoltage protection as well as an under drive<br>
protection.<br>
The overvoltage protection circuit as explained is not<br>
restricted for a use with a power supply as described with regard<br>
to Figure 2. Applications for other power supplies, for exmaple<br>
for a DC-DC converter, are also possible.<br>
