				<td>ELECTROLYTIC POT FOR PRODUCTION OF ALUMINUM USING THE HALL-HEROULT PROCESS COMPRISING COOLING MEANS<br>
Domain of the invention<br><br>
The invention relates to the production of aluminum by igneous electrolysis using the Hall-Heroult process and installations designed for industrial use of this process. More specifically, the invention relates to control of thermal fluxes in electrolytic pots and cooling means for obtaining this control.<br>
State of art<br>
Metal aluminum is produced industrially by igneous electrolysis, namely electrolysis of alumina in solution in a molten cryolite bath called an electrolyte bath, using the well known Hall-Heroult process. The electrolyte bath is contained in a pot comprising a steel pot shell which is coated on the inside with refractory and/or insulating materials, and a cathodic assembly located at the bottom of the pot. The electrolysis current, which may reach values of more than 300 KA, generates alumina reduction reactions and also keeps the electrolyte bath at a temperature of the order of 950°C by the Joule effect.<br>
The electrolytic pot is usually controlled such that it is in thermal equilibrium, in other words the total amount of heat dissipated by the electrolytic pot is compensated by heat produced in the pot, which is essentially derived from the electrolysis current. The thermal equilibrium point is usually chosen to give the<br><br>
best operating conditions, both technically and economically. In particular, the possibility of maintaining an optimum set temperature results in a significant saving in the aluminum production cost because the Faraday efficiency is kept at a very high value, exceeding 90% in the most afficient plants.<br>
Thermal equilibrium conditions depend on the physical parameters of the pot such as the dimensions and nature of the component materials, and pot operating conditions such as the electrical resistance of the pot, the bath temperature or the intensity of the electrolysis current. The pot is frequently constructed and controlled such that a ridge of solidified bath is formed on the side walls of the pot, which in particular prevents the lining of the said walls being attacked by the liquid cryolite.<br>
Statement of the problem<br>
The igneous electrolysis aluminum production industry is regularly confronted with the need for industrial installations that stabilize and maintain the operating point of electrolytic pots for the purposes of optimized plant management, but they must also accept deliberate changes to operating conditions which may be quite different from nominal conditions. In other words, it is frequently useful to be able to easily control or modulate the operating point of plant electrolytic pots while maintaining or even improving their normal technical performances, without correspondingly increasing production costs. For example,  this type of situation arises when it is<br><br>
required to vary the power of a series of electrolytic pots (potline) as a function of an electricity contract.<br>
With this objective in mind, the applicant looked for methods and means of controlling thermal fluxes and stabilizing  the  thermal  conditions  of  electrolytic   <br>
pots, which do not require a high investment and do not "<br>
^	^  	.   , ,. -  - ■		^<br>
involve unacceptable additional operating costs, while providing very good efficiency and adaptability.        <br>
It has already been suggested that pots should be equipped with specific means for evacuating and dissipating heat produced by electrolytic pots in a controlled manner. In particular, the Soviet invention certificates SU 605 865 and SU 663 760 suggest providing pots with a cooling system controlled from the outside, which includes hermetic cavities on the sides, and variable thermal shields and air conveyer means equipped with regulation valves below the pot. Air is discharged in air conveyer means through a fan or a compressor. These devices require a large and cumbersome infrastructure.<br>
Patent application EP 0 047 227 has also suggested that the thermal insulation on the pot should be increased and that the pot should be provided with heat ducts equipped with heat exchangers. Heat ducts pass through the pot shell and the thermal insulation and are plugged into carbonaceous parts such as edge slabs. This solution is fairly complex and expensive to install, and also requires major modifications to the pot.<br><br>
In order to more specifically encourage the formation of a ridge of solidified bath, American patent US 4 087 345 also describes a pot shell equipped with stiffeners and a reinforcement frame constructed to encourage cooling of the pot sides by natural convection of ambient air. This type of device requires installations fixed to the pot shell. Furthermore, static devices are not very suitable for precise control of thermal fluxes.<br>
In order to control the formation of the ridge of solidified bath and to recover part of the heat drawn out from the sides of the pot, American patent US 4 608 135 proposes using a pot in which passages are laid out between the edge slabs and the inside insulation of the pot shell, and air inlet orifices on the sides of the pot. Passages communicate firstly with the said orifices and secondly with the inside of the collection device fixed on the pot. The collection device draws in ambient air taken from the sides of the pot through the said orifices and entrains its flow through the said passages along the edge slabs, which has the effect of cooling them. The air flow is controlled by dampers fitted with valves located on the sides of the collection device, which act as bypass pipes. This device requires major modifications to the pot and does not enable independent control of cooling, since regular work on the pot makes it necessary to open the collection device covers which disturb the effect of the dampers.<br>
After observing that there are no satisfactory known  solutions,  the  applicant  set  himself  the<br><br>
objective of finding efficient and adaptable means of evacuating  and  dissipating  heat  produced  by  the electrolytic pot, that can easily be set up and which do not require any major modifications to the pot, and particularly  to  the  pot  shell,  or  any  major infrastructure.   In order to enable use in existing plants and in new plants, in particular the applicant""" s"eafched for the means of""md(difying the power of the   pots,which can" be easily adapted to different types of   pots or to different operating modes of the same type of  pot,  and  which  are  suitable  for  industrial installations comprising a large number of pots in  \ series.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The first object of the invention is an electrolytic pot for production of aluminum by the Hall-Heroult electrolysis process which includes cooling means by blowing air with localized and distributed jets.<br>
The second object of the invention is an aluminum production plant using the Hall-Heroult electrolysis process, characterized in that it comprises pots according to the invention.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The electrolytic pot for production of aluminum \  ^ using the Hall-Heroult electrolysis process according to the invention comprises a steel pot shell, internal \ lining  elements  and  a  cathodic  assembly,  and  is  I<br><br>
efficient and adaptable cooling means, which may be in the form of fixed or variable extra cooling power over and above the nominal power. The invention thus makes it possible to modify the power of each pot individually.<br>
The air flow from the blower means according to the invention may be variable to enable finer control of cooling, or possibly regulation of cooling. It is also advantageous to be able to integrate means according to the invention into regulation systems used on the most modern electrolytic pots. Cooling means can then be checked or even controlled by the pot regulation system, such that the thermal flux may be regulated more efficiently, and possibly in an automated manner.<br>
The pot may include additional cooling means such as static cooling means.<br>
Cooling means may be removable, in the sense that they can easily be put into position bir taken out of--"the" pot, in some cases even while it is in operation. Thus^fbr example when a pot is being tended, cooling means" ""may be completely or partly removed,  which"<br>
f-ac-ilifat"e"s ■access to the pot "sHelT"" and" the"-""maintenance<br>
In some applications, it may be advantageous to assemble cooling means according to the invention in the form of a completely or partly automatic cooling device. This type of assembly can then be used in a global design and can very much facilitate operation.<br><br>
The  general  air  flow of the  said device may be variable.<br>
According  to  the  preferred  embodiment  of  the invention, the cooling means include air distribution means to distribute the air flow around the pot shell, an air pulsion means which pulses or discharges air into the air distribution means, and localized blower means in order to locally blow air in the form of jets, the  said  localized blower  means  being placed  at specific locations on the pot shell.  The distribution means preferably include air conveyer means, such as ducts.  The localized blower means may be regulating nozzles, ejectors, blast pipes, jet nozzles or pipes. Localized blower means are advantageously distributed along the air conveyer means. The air flow from the pulsion means may be variable.  The air flow due to one or  several  localized  blower  means  may  also  be individually variable.<br>
The aluminum production plant based on the Hall-    <br>
Heroult electrolysis process according to the second <br>
object of the invention is characterized in that it <br>
comprises pots according to the first object of the <br>
invention.  The pots may be individually equipped with <br>
cooling means according to the invention.	<br>
The pots may be individually equipped with the cooling device according to the invention, which may possib"ly be controlled in a centralized manner.<br>
In general in electrolysis plants, electrolytic pots are grouped or laid out in series.   In these<br><br>
cases, the pots may advantageously be equipped with cooling means according to the invention, which may be completely or partly common to two or several pots, in other words two or several pots have one of the said cooling means in common. In particular, in some cases it is advantageous to arrange the design such that one cooling means are common to two or more than two pots.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br><br>
The electrolytic pot (1) for the production of aluminum by the Hall-Heroult electrolysis process according to the invention comprises a steel pot shell (2), inside lining elements (3) and a cathodic assembly (4), and cooling means by blowing air with localized jets distributed around the pot shell (2).<br>
The inside lining elements (3) are usually made of blocks of refractory materials which may be thermal insulators. The cathodic assembly (4) comprises connection bars (9) fixed to electrical conductors used to carry the electrolysis current. Lining elements and the cathodic assembly form a crucible inside the pot, the crucible being used to contain the electrolyte bath (7) and the layer of liquid metal (6) when the pot is loaded. The anodes (11) are partially immersed in the electrolyte bath (7) . The electrolyte bath contains dissolved alumina and usually an alumina cover (8) covers the electrolyte bath.<br>
The metal aluminum (6) produced during the electrolysis accumulates at the bottom of the pot, such that it forms a fairly well defined interface between the liquid metal (6) and the molten cryolite bath (7). The position of this bath-metal interface varies with time; it rises as liquid metal accumulates at the bottom of the pot and it drops when liquid metal is extracted from the pot.<br>
Electrolytic pots are usually controlled by controlling several parameters such as the alumina concentration of the electrolyte, the temperature of<br><br>
the electrolyte bath, the total height of the bath or the position of the anodes. In general, an attempt is made to form a bath ridge (5) of solidified cryolite on the side walls (12) of the crucible that are in contact with the electrolyte bath (7) and with the liquid metal layer (6). The said walls are frequently composed of edge slabs made of carbonaceous materials or based on carbonaceous compounds, such as an SiC based refractory material, and of lining paste. In order to increase the efficiency of the cooling means according to the invention, the side walls may comprise preformed blocks or sides, preferably homogenous, composed of a material with a high thermal conductivity, in all cases greater than the conductivity of fireproof lining paste, and also preferably at least equal to the conductivity of the edge slabs normally used, for example such as an Sic based material.<br>
Preferably, the pot is also provided with a collection device for collecting and recovering gaseous effluents emitted by the electrolyte bath during electrolysis. The collection device includes a hooding (10) over the entire pot usually fitted with hoods and opening accesses.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, cooling means comprise air conveyer means (28) such as ducts (21-24) , a pulsion means (25) for blowing air in the said air conveyer means, and localized blower means (27) for spraying air in the form of localized jets. These means preferably form a cooling device (20).<br><br>
The air conveyer means (28) may be held in position by different means. In particular, they may be fixed to elements of the pot structure or reinforcement, such as stiffeners, which may be modified or adapted for this purpose. The air conveyer means (28) may also be placed in contact with or adjacent to the pot shell, or they may be fixed to the pot shell deck plate.<br>
The main air flow in the device (20) may advantageously be variable, for example using valves or by varying the flow from the pulsion means (25) . The air flow from one or several localized blower means may also be variable, possibly individually, and possibly also with the possibility of reducing the flow of some blower means to zero. In some cases air may be pulsated.<br>
Cooling means, or the cooling device according to the invention, may be completely or partly removable. In particular, the ducts may be easily removable and transportable, particularly due to a design consisting of segments and appropriate assembly means.<br>
Air pulsed in air conveyer means is blown on pot shell walls, at determined locations, using localized blower means (27) that are advantageously distributed along the air conveyer means. The localized blower means are not necessarily distributed uniformly on the surface of the pot shell; it may sometimes be preferable to concentrate them in some specific areas.<br>
The localized blower means (27) are used to direct the air flow at precise locations on the pot shell, for<br><br>
example at the height of the electrolyte bath (7). It is advantageous that one or several localized blower means (27) can be of adjustable direction. The localized blower means spray blown air at a speed called the ejection speed, which is preferably between 10 and 100 m/s, and also preferably between 20 and 70 m/s.<br>
The number, position and dimensions of localized blower means (27), the power of the pulsion means (25) and the configuration and dimensions of air conveyer means (21 to 24) are chosen such that the air flow is sufficient to enable efficient cooling and to provide a determined cooling power at the selected blowing points, taking special care with the aeraulics of the network.<br>
The air pulsion means (25) may be a fan that blows out ambient air, or a compressed air blower such as a fan - blast pipe, or an expanded compressed air system, or a high pressure air network.<br>
For electrical safety reasons, it is sometimes preferable to electrically isolate the pulsion means (25) from the rest of the device using electrical insulation (26) such as a section of a pipe made of an electrically insulating material.<br>
The ducts (21-24) may be composed of metallic materials, preferably non-magnetic (such as non¬magnetic stainless steel or aluminum), or insulating materials (such as glass fiber) or a combination of<br><br>
them (such as a metal duct fitted with an insulating casing).<br>
The cooling device (20) may possibly be controlled by the pot main regulation system, in order to provide a more efficient centralized global regulation.<br>
The pot may also be provided with complementary cooling means, particularly static cooling means such as ribs or equivalent means. In order to increase the global efficiency of the cooling means (or the cooling device), it is advantageous in some cases and/or at some locations of the pot to combine the effect of blower means with the effect of the complementary means.<br>
According to one variant of the invention, for example as illustrated in figures 1 to 3, the air conveyer means form branches, in other words they are made up such that a main pipe (21) separates into horizontal branches under the pot (22), vertical branches at the sides and ends of the pot (23) and horizontal branches at the sides and ends of the pot (24). This configuration provides satisfactory aeraulic balancing of the duct network and facilitates installation of the cooling device. In particular, vertical branches may be placed between cathodic bars (9) .<br>
According to another variant of the invention, for example as illustrated in figure 4, air conveyer means (28) surround or brace all or part of the pot shell (2) of the electrolytic pot.<br><br>
According  to  the  variants  of  the  invention illustrated in figures 5 and 6,   a single pulsion means (25) is common to more than one pot, and more precisely to two or more than two pots in a plant.  The pulsion means (25) distributes the air flow through a network (29)  comprising  a  common  main  duct  (30)  and  a connection point (31) for each pot.  Connection points - may be provided with valves  to  isolate  each pot individually and to vent and rebalance the distribution of air flows.  Valves and vents are particularly useful when doing work on a particular pot or on some pots, since they can isolate the pot or pots concerned while maintaining satisfactory air flows for the other pots connected to the network.<br>
In a plant, cooling means are advantageously instrumented or controlled using a regulation system common to more than one pot. Typically, each pot equipped with its own cooling means or each group of pots equipped with cooling means with elements in common (particularly the pulsion means) may be controlled by a regulation system called a "first level" system, and all pots or groups of pots in a particular electrolysis hall in the plant may also be controlled globally by a "second level" regulation system.<br><br>
Example<br>
Tests were carried out on 300 kA electrolytic pots with a cooling device conform with the invention, with the following specific characteristics..<br>
With reference to figures 1 to 3, a main duct (21) passes longitudinally under the pot shell  (2) until almost the center of the pot, and then divides into three branches (22a, 22b, 22c) perpendicular to each other and with a smaller cross-section than the main duct;  a longitudinal branch (22a) extends under the pot shell to its other end and then forms a vertical branch (23a)  that rises along the head of the pot approximately to the same height as the edge slab, and then splits into two horizontal branches (24a, 24a") which extend to the sides of the pot;  the other two transverse branches (22b, 22c) extend as far as the sides of the pot shell and then form vertical branches (23b, 23c) which rise along each side of the pot shell ■ approximately as far as the pot edge slab, and then split into two horizontal branches  (24b, 24b", 24c, 24c") which extend on each side of the pot, and then extend as far as the ends of the pot.   A vertical branch (23c) equivalent to branch (23a) is directly connected to the main duct, and also splits into two horizontal branches (24c, 24c"),<br>
Nozzles (27) were placed uniformly along the branches. According to the tests, the number of nozzles was 5 to 8 along each end of the pot and 15 to 20 nozzles along each side of the pot. The nozzles were directed approximately towards the theoretical<br><br>
metal bath level in most tests. In some tests, some nozzles were directed towards structural reinforcing elements of the pot shell, which thus act as cooling ribs. The ducts and nozzles were made of steel, and partly of stainless steel.<br>
The air pulsion means (25) was a mechanical fan in some tests, and a fan - blast pipe in other tests. Cooling devices were provided with means of varying the air flow.<br>
Tests showed that the cooling device remained efficient for air outlet speeds at the nozzle output of between 10 ms and about 100 m/s. The efficiency of the device dropped considerably until it became practically ineffective for speeds of less than 10 m/s. Speeds of more than 100 m/s led to very high head losses, which would have resulted in plusion devices with unacceptable powers and/or costs. The best results were obtained with outlet speeds of between 20 and 70 m/s.<br>
Temperature measurements made using thermocouples and pyrometers demonstrated that the device was capable of producing average temperatures drops of 50 to 100°C at the side walls. The regulation of the cooling device was easily obtained by varying the pulsed air flow.<br>
Surprisingly, the applicant thus found that it was possible to achieve satisfactory cooling rates by blowing air according to the invention, without the need for pulsion and blower means or excessive or<br><br>
disproportionate ducts, and/or ducts which would require excessive or unacceptable investments and/or operating costs.<br>
These tests also showed that air blown onto the pot walls, and , which is heated on contact with the pot, dilutes fairly quickly in the ambient air and does significantly increase the temperature of the ambient air. In other words, tests did not show values of ambient temperature that are significantly different from values normally observed near to pots according to prior art, even when the ambient temperature reaches extreme values in summer.<br>
It was also observed that the noise produced by the device was surprisingly low.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The cooling means according to the invention are capable of evacuating and dissipating thermal energy produced in the electrolytic pot by optimal control of some thermal fluxes, which may be adapted to weather conditions and/or pot operating conditions that can be significantly different from nominal or standard conditions. Cooling means can also accurately control the formation of the bath ridge within the cryolite bath.<br>
The cooling means or the cooling device according to the invention are easily adapted to any type of pot and to different environments. They can easily be put into  place  on  existing  pots,  particularly  during<br><br>
renovation of the pots, when adding temperature regulation and/or changing the nominal intensity. More specifically, the invention facilitates variations in the power of pots, for example to take account of technical, economic and/or contractual constraints. In particular, the invention can increase the nominal intensity of existing pots without causing premature degradation of the pots.<br>
In an electrolysis plant according to the invention, control of several pots or even a complete series of pots, and operating conditions, can be optimized at the same time by adapting the cooling means or device for each individual pot, in particular to make the pot operating point the same. In particular, the invention enables individual temperature control of the pots in a plant, which is often necessary in high productivity plants. For example, this is the case during transient phases that often occur when several pots in the same series have new lining, or if they are different from the rest of the series.<br>
The invention can also be used for the modernization of existing plants without the need for infrastructure work which would make this type of operation unacceptable.<br>
The invention can also extend the life of a pot near the end of its life, if there are any abnormal hot points on the pot shell.<br><br><br>
