				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a system for improving Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR) of a transmission system using non gain-flattened optical amplifiers. The present invention also relates to an optically amplified Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDM) transmission system that incorporates aforesaid system and has improved channel OSNR.<br>
Background Art<br>
In DWDM transmission systems,'optical amplifiers are an integral part. In general, erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) are used to amplify multiple channels. The use of optical amplifiers results in the generation of noise. This generation is intrinsic to the amplification process. The ratio of the optical signal power to the optical noise power is called the Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR) and is a measure of the quality of the signal transmission. The intrinsic gain spectrum of an EDFA consists of several peaks and valleys. In a chain of cascaded amplifiers the signal near the peak of the gain will grow at the expense of other signals. Hence the optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) for different channels will be different even if at the input to the link, they were same.<br>
Quite a few ways have been demonstrated over the years to flatten the spectral gain characteristics and hence, to effectively improve the relative OSNR variation between the channels. These methods can be categorized under three-category a) Glass composition method, b) Spectral equalizer method and c) Hybrid amplifier method. In all these methods one has to use either special materials for the optical fiber instead of silica or optical filters with special spectral characteristics, which are not very cost effective" for multi span DWDM transmission system with multiple amplifiers. It has also been shown that OSNR can be improved by signal pre-emphasis at the beginning of the link. In practice it might not be always possible to control the transmitter power in order to implement this scheme. A good description of the above-mentioned schemes can be found in " Erbium-Doped Amplifiers: Fundamentals and Technology " by P.C Becker et al, Academic Press, 1999.<br>
In one of the interesting schemes, it has been shown that OSNR of the system can be improved by demultiplexing the signal channels in the middle of the link and carrying out<br><br>
the spectral equalization by using separate amplifier for each channel and multiplexing them by an optical multiplexer for onward transmission. A publication by L.Eskildsen et al., IEEE Photon. Tech. Lett 6,1321 (1994)-£ives a description of a similar scheme. The drawback of such a scheme is that as the channel count increases the system will become expensive due to the use of separate optical amplifiers for each channel.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a system to improve the OSNR of channels of a transmission system.<br>
Another object of the present invention  is to provide, a  system  which  uses non  gain-<br>
flattened EDFAs in a multichannel transmission system for reducing the relative variation in the OSNR across the channels.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system for increasing the number of spans of a multichannel transmission system using non gain-flattened EDFAs.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a system for alleviating the OSNB limitation on the link length of a multichannel transmission system using non gain-flattened EDFAs.<br>
One more object of the present invention is to provide an optically amplified Dens* Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDM) transmission system that incorporate! aforesaid system and has improved channel OSNR.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to figure 1, a system is shown, through which the OSNR improvement is achieved. The signal is transmitted to a WDM Band Splitter 401. The function of the band splitter is to split the incoming signals into two bands. One band consists of the longer wavelengths and the other band consists of the shorter wavelengths. While the figure specifically refers to two bands, this can be generalized to having more bands. The spectra of the two bands may be viewed in an Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA), Each band consists of several signals, powers of which are not necessarily equal. The bands are separately transmitted through two separate non gain-flattened EDFAs 102a and 102b. The EDFAs 102a and 102b are set for constant gain operation. The gains in the two respective EDFAs are set such that at the output of the two EDFAs, the lowest signal or channel powers are the same in both the bands. This can be achieved by monitoring the output of the EDFAs with an OSA. In addition to the spectral manipulation, the EDFAs also make up for the insertion losses of the WDM Band Splitter, VOAs and the WDM Band Combiner and provide an additional power to the signals. The two bands are passed separately through two Variable Optical Attenuators (VOAs) 103a and 103b. The VOAs are provided to realize any fine-tuning required to obtain optimum link performance when the scheme is implemented in a DWDM transmission link. The bands are then combined using a WDM Band Combiner 104 for onward transmission.<br>
Figure 2 is illustrating the use of the system to improve the OSNR in a multi-span optically amplified DWDM transmission system. The output of a Transmitter Array 201 is multiplexed using a Multiplexer 202. The signal is then boosted by a non gain-flattened<br><br>
- Booster Amplifier 203 and launched into the first span. For the sake of clarity only span number one, four, five and twelve are illustratedTTfie Dispersion^ Compensating Fibers (DCF) in span numbers one, four, five and twelve are denoted by 204a, 204b, 204c, and 204d, respectively. The ITU-T G.652 compliant amgie ivioae moer (SMt) in span numbers one, four, five and twelve are denoted by 206a, 206b, 206c, and 206d respectively. In each span the accumulated dispersion is more or less compensated by the DCF over the signal band. The non gain-flattened Inline Amplifiers used to make up for the nominal loss in the SMF is denoted by ILA1 and are represented in the figure in span number one, four, five and twelve by 207a, 207b, 207c and 207d, respectively. The non gain-flattened Inline Amplifiers used to make up for the nominal loss in the DCF is denoted by ILA2 and are represented in the figure in span number one, four, five and twelve by 205a, 205b, 205c and 205d, respectively. The system to improve the OSNR represented by 208 is implemented after the fourth span. The detailed working of the same has been explained earlier with reference to Figure 1. The signal coming out of the multiplexer is introduced to the next span, namely the fifth span and it gets transmitted to the subsequent spans. The signal is demultiplexed using the Demultiplexer 209. The demultiplexed signals are detected by an array of receivers 210.<br>
The simulation parameters used to simulate the link using VPItransmissionmaker WDM are tabulated in Table 1. The transmitter array includes 16 Channels from ITU-T grid no. — 22 to 37 consisting of 10 fihpfi externally modulated lasers (FMT,). The signals are multiplexed using a multiplexer and thereafter boosted by a non gain-flattened booster EDFA operated under a constant power configuration. Each span consists of 80 km of ITU-T G.652 compliant fibers. Link loss is compensated by a non gain-flattened EDFA operating under constant gain condition. The accumulated dispersion of each span is compensated by a Dispersion Compensating Fiber (DCF) and the loss incurred in the DCF length is compensated by another non-gain flattened EDFA operating under constant gain condition, ine system to improve tne U5JNK as has been described with reference to Figure 1 has been implemented after the fourth span. The two bands that are split consist of ITU-T grid 22-29 in the first band and ITU-T grid 30-37 in the second band. The first band is passed through "Amplifier 1" and the second band through "Amplifier 2".<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the spectrum after the Booster Amplifier. In the 1530 nm region, the gap in the spectrum is attributed to the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) rejection filter used with each amplifier in order to prevent the saturation of  the   subsequent<br><br>
amplifiers in the link by ASE noise. It can be observed frorfi the figure that the spectrum of the transmitters is more or less flat after the booster amplifier.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the spectrum after the fifth span wherein the scheme to improve the OSNR is not implemented. It can be observed that there are peaks and valleys of the" ampHfierin-the^tgnal-band. The valleys-degrade the^SNR-considerablyr<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the spectrum after the implementation of the scheme to improve the OSNR. The spectrum is noted at the point where the signal is launched into the fifth span. In this figure it should be noted that there is a spectral reshaping done so that the minimum channel powers in both bands namely ITU-T grid 22-29 and ITU-T grid 30-37 are more or less equal. It should be noted that VOAs 103a and 103b are used to fine-tune the settings to get optimum link performance.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the spectrum at the end of the fifth span where the scheme to improve the OSNR is carried out at the end of the fourth span. As had been mentioned earlier with reference to Figure 5 the spectral reshaping done at the end of the fourth span can be observed.<br>
The OSNR map, when channels are transmitted across all twelve spans without the implementation of the system to improve the OSNR, is illustrated in Figure 7. The improvement in the OSNR after the implementation of the system can be seen in Figure 8. The corresponding data is tabulated in Table 2. The data showing the improvement in the OSNR in each of the individual channels over the entire span, once the system 208 is implemented after the fourth span is tabulated in Table 3. There is a substantial improvement in the OSNR of the transmitted channels up to 12 spans. The implementation of the system to improve the OSNR results in all channels having a Bit Error Rate (BER) of less than 1 in 1G15 even at the-end of the eighth span.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
