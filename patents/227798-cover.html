				<td>Covers, as provided particularly for beds but also for other<br>
furniture, should be light and flexible, i.e. pliant, so as<br>
to be able to sufficiently adapt to the body, while<br>
considering the thermal characteristics regarding ambient<br>
temperature, e.g. in particular the bedroom temperature at<br>
night, such that a more or less "warm" cover is selected.<br>
Accordingly, as a rule, in southern countries, the covers<br>
regularly only consist of a wool blanket over a simple sheet,<br>
which is supplemented by a second wool blanket or further<br>
wool blankets when the ambient temperature is colder. In<br>
middle and northern Europe, covers are predominantly used in<br>
which one layer of light, insulating material consisting of a<br>
quilted cover or a down comforter is entirely enclosed by a<br>
cover casing. It is also possible to select between thicker<br>
or better insulating layers and thinner layers, so as to take<br>
the ambient temperature into account. The following<br>
consideration is also true for special forms of covers, in<br>
particular also for sleeping bags, which are to be included<br>
in the term "cover".<br>
However, it has been shown that a satisfactory resting or<br>
sleeping climate can possibly be obtained therewith only to<br>
an insufficient extent. During sleep or rest, the vapour<br>
permeability of the cover and the ambient humidity of the air<br>
may result, depending on the perspiration of the person lying<br>
down, in a general or partial body perspiration which is<br>
unpleasant.both when feeling cool or warm. Apart therefrom,<br>
damp bedclothes are also a health hazard if the person<br>
becomes uncovered and a local cooling should accidentally<br>
occur.<br>
During the night, human beings sweat out up to approximately<br>
500 ml of water. This water or water vapour must leave the<br>
entire bed system so as to avoid moisture accumulation in the<br><br>
space taken up by the sleeper under the covers. Dissipation<br>
may either be downwardly through the support system, such as<br>
the mattress, or through the cover or lateral openings when<br>
the body is not completely surrounded.<br>
It is known that the main portion of moisture must be<br>
transported off through the cover. However, the moisture<br>
meets with various resistances here, i.e. initially the first<br>
layer of the cover casing, then the first layer of the cover<br>
ticking, then the filler material, then the second layer of<br>
the cover ticking, the second layer of the casing and only<br>
then reaches the ambient air. While passing these layers,<br>
both a storage of moisture, which must again be transported<br>
further and discharged, and a mixture of diffusive and<br>
slightly convective transportation takes place. As a whole,<br>
however, this constitutes slow, moisture-equalizing<br>
processes, each of which quasi including high individual<br>
resistances. Last but not least, the development of cover<br>
tickings for down or fiber covers as well as covers filled<br>
with natural hair or animal hair in the direction of a<br>
corresponding down or fiber density, and thus textiles having<br>
a high fiber density and fine individual fibers, which<br>
naturally have a high density as regards a piercing of the<br>
individual filler media, but which clearly also provide<br>
reduced air permeation. This leads to a reduction of the<br>
overall exchange of air containing moisture, and to a kind of<br>
congestion. The consequence is - and this is also shown in<br>
studies by different institutes - that a quasi tropical<br>
climate is obtained within the space under the cover. The air<br>
temperatures roughly range between 3 0 and 3 5Â° C with a<br>
correspondingly high air humidity.<br>
However, since human beings do not	feel comfortable at such<br>
temperatures, this results in that	sleep is uneasy, and the<br>
sleeper tosses in bed and uncovers	himself. After this<br>
uncovering, an evaporation-cooling	of the sweated-out<br>
perspiration occurs, however, i.e.	a cooling-down which<br><br>
results, in turn, in that the sleeping person will again cover himself.<br>
As a result, uneasy sleep phases occur disturbing the sleep architecture.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a cover which is suited to avoid<br>
problems not only regarding thermal characteristics, i.e. sufficient insulation and<br>
dissipation of excess heat, but also regarding moisture transportation, in particular<br>
for human beings having the tendency to sweat, or in a muggy room climate, with<br>
the handling, use, cleaning and the like being able to be carried out in a known<br>
manner, and with the production costs also remaining within an acceptable range.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this object is solved with a cover. This cover<br>
provides ventilation possibilities for the transportation of air through the cover and<br>
thereby also allows a moisture compensation from the body to the environment as<br>
well as dissipation of excess heat (heat accumulation). The cover as a flexible<br>
layer of light, insulating material can be a simple wool blanket with or without an<br>
additional sheet or casing, it may also be a quilted cover or a down comforter. It is<br>
essential that it is not a closed layer obstructive for air flow and that it nevertheless<br>
maintains a predetermined thermal insulation.<br>
The invention was therefore based on the idea to use ventilation openings which<br>
ensure both a direct up draught of the warm air and, thus, guarantee a high<br>
dissipation of the air humidity, and further a forced convection with body<br>
movements, and thus allow volume changes in the space under the cover, but<br>
which nevertheless maintain the known properties of pliancy and comfort. This is<br>
achieved by all means with known filling media, so that even in the summer very<br>
soft, comforting cover constructions are possible which<br><br>
nevertheless create an ideal climate in the	space taken up by<br>
the sleeper under the cover. This, in turn,	results in a<br>
calmer sleeping behaviour and better temper	and productivity<br>
as well as, possibly, in improved health of	the sleeping<br>
person.<br>
With this type of cover and with an adapted constructive<br>
embodiment, the main portion of the exuded body moisture is<br>
passed via the opening systems and, thus, the cover itself is<br>
burdened to a far lesser extent by water-vapour<br>
transportation. This has the effect that the feeling no<br>
longer arises of a clammy bed, as it is colloquially known,<br>
and that less time will be needed to air the bed cover.<br>
The sleeping practice to be also considered for comparison<br>
purposes, for instance that a person sleeps only under a<br>
sheet or a cover casing in hot or muggy weather, is less<br>
advantageous as compared therewith, since the heat insulation<br>
is lost for the most part when a sheet lies on the body,<br>
without this, however, allowing a correspondingly easy<br>
transition of the air to the outside.<br>
The ventilation openings of the cover according to the<br>
invention can be spanned by wide meshwork or a coarse-meshed<br>
material so as to ensure the cohesion of the cover also<br>
particularly if there are larger or longitudinally extended<br>
openings. The flexible layer of insulating material, e.g. in<br>
the form of a wool blanket or also a quilted cover or down<br>
comforter, can indeed be combined with a sheet or a cover<br>
casing, in particular for hygienic reasons, if an essentially<br>
facilitating air transition still results through the<br>
ventilation openings, especially since such sheets or cover<br>
casings are generally not made of particularly dense textiles<br>
such as, for instance, ticking fabric. Such a cover casing<br>
then spans the ventilation openings in the form of a<br>
meshwork. The permeability of such a spanning construction is<br>
essential to ensure on the one hand the desired ventilation<br><br>
and on the other to avoid those effects occurring when lying<br>
partially uncovered.<br>
In connection therewith, it has been shown to be advantageous<br>
when the permeability of the meshwork ranges from 200 1/dm2 <br>
min at a pressure gradient of 200 Pa to 9000 1/dm2 min at a<br>
pressure gradient of 13 Pa, which contrasts the mesh both<br>
from fabrics having a greater density and from free openings.<br>
In order to fulfil the light covering function, the<br>
"meshwork" may have various forms. Textiles can be found<br>
preferably in the field of knit fabrics such as open-work<br>
knit fabics, in particular polyester open-work knit fabrics,<br>
or charmeuse goods such as rhombus charmeuse or open-work<br>
charmeuse. Gauze or mesh fabrics from the field of textiles<br>
represent suitable meshwork. Further, textile, open-measured<br>
material come under consideration, such as non-woven<br>
materials, in particular thermo-bonded spun non-woven<br>
materials, having optionally cut-out holes or fibers in<br>
biaxial or multiaxial layers as are used as reinforcement<br>
material in fiber-reinforced synthetics. When looked at from<br>
above or looked through, advantageous examples of meshworks<br>
can be observed having a proportion of openings such as<br>
holes, pores, free mesh space and the like of 15 to 30 %.<br>
The effect of the meshwork as in a predeterminable<br>
permeability of the ventilation openings may further be<br>
supplemented by additional filler of fibrous material or<br>
light, open bulk material or fillers or open-pored flexible<br>
bodies, in particular foam material having large pores, which<br>
are arranged on one side so as to form a single meshwork, or<br>
are arranged preferably between two meshwork layers. They are<br>
then virtually a part of a spatial meshwork.<br>
The ventilation openings preferably have a width of 5 to 300<br>
mm, also depending on a thickness of the cover they may have<br>
a width of 0.3 to 150 mm. In connection therewith, the<br>
ventilation openings should occupy an aerial proportion<br><br>
ranging from 3 to 50 %, preferably 5 to 20 %, of the entire<br>
area of the bed.<br>
Several embodiments of the invention are shown in the<br>

The cover designated throughout Figs. 1 and 2 by reference<br>
numeral 1 comprises a large, continuous, flexible layer 2 of<br>
a light, insulating material, perforated by oval or round<br>
holes 3 distributed in a grid. The layer 2 can e.g. be<br>
observed like a down comforter having a ticking upper plate 4<br>
and a lower plate 5, between which a filling of fiber,<br>
natural hair, animal hair or down is enclosed. This layer of<br>
a light, insulating material may also be provided with a<br>
reflecting layer or filler which is responsible, for<br>
instance, with a fine fiber metallization for a screening<br>
against electromagnetic pollution. However, the direct<br>
influence of the reflecting portion on the bed climate is the<br>
result of a retention of heat radiation. The reflection in<br>
the infrared range improves and equalizes the insulating<br>
effect of the layer 2. The ventilation openings 3<br>
simultaneously adopt the function of a connection and a<br>
spacing between the upper plate 4 and the lower plate 5,<br>
which is otherwise mostly obtained by ribs.<br>
The essential novel effect is obtained by the ventilation<br>
openings 3 which allow an air exchange between the two sides<br><br>
of the cover 1 and thereby allow the dissipation of the air<br>
having a high proportion of body moisture from below the<br>
cover. This is already possible due to the updraught of warm<br>
air, but this is particularly possible when the person<br>
resting below the cover 1 moves and the spaces below the<br>
cover are thereby altered.<br>
For a maximum air exchange, the cover 1 may to a large extent<br>
be kept free in the area of the ventilation openings 3.<br>
However, in principle, an air exchange is also possible by<br>
means of conventional textile slip materials, as are used for<br>
fitted sheets or cover casings. These slip materials<br>
represent meshworks along the lines of the invention which<br>
regulate the ventilation by means of the ventilation<br>
openings.<br>
A cover 6 according to Fig. 3 has unevenly distributed<br>
ventilation openings 7 which roughly reflect a distribution<br>
of the body masses or body surfaces of a resting person and<br>
which are particularly adapted to the varying requirements<br>
for air exchange which is different depending on the area.<br>
These ventilation openings 7 are again incorporated into a<br>
layer 8 of a light insulating material or a material of a<br>
conventional kind.<br>
A cover 9 according to Fig. 4 is provided with regularly<br>
distributed, rectangular ventilation openings 10 which are<br>
incorporated in a grid system in a cover, in particular a<br>
down comforter, divided by ribs 11.<br>
A cover 12 according to Figs. 5 and 6 having (for example)<br>
rectangular ventilation openings 13 is, in turn, to be<br>
regarded starting with any conventional cover as being<br>
amended by the ventilation openings 13, with the ventilation<br>
openings 13 being each spanned by a meshwork 14 such that the<br>
cohesion of the cover 12 is not lost due to the openings and<br>
such that the cover still provides optically a self-contained<br><br>
appearance. Such a meshwork may be designed as a rough<br>
fabric, however, it may also consist of a perforated flat<br>
material of fabric, knit fabric, sheets or the like.<br>
Particularly suited are commercially available open-work knit<br>
fabrics, whose holes and hole proportions must be provided in<br>
a form large enough for the desired permeability. The mesh-<br>
like coverings, however, provide a suitable passage for<br>
ventilation.<br>
A cover 15 according to Figs. 7 and 8 is formed of strip-like<br>
layers 16 of insulating material having cross-quilt seams 16<br>
which are defined at predetermined distances by continuous-<br>
meshwork 17, such that ventilation openings 18 are formed<br>
which have likewise the form of strips. It is appreciated<br>
that normally relatively narrow ventilation openings ensure<br>
sufficient permeability, so that the proportions as shown are<br>
only considered in exceptional cases. Such an embodiment can<br>
be efficiently manufactured from the strips using the<br>
"element structure".<br>
The cross-sectional drawing according to Fig. 9 shows a cover<br>
19, in which the insulating material is present each as<br>
double strips 20, between which strips 21 of a meshwork<br>
having wide openings are responsible for spacing fixation and<br>
ventilation.<br>
One further development of a cover 22 according to Fig. 10<br>
having a single strip 23 of insulating material laid as a<br>
sinuous line is fixed in the "paperclip" shape by a rough-<br>
meshed meshwork 24 which extends in a middle area traversely<br>
over the twists.<br>
In Fig. 11, a cover 25, which, starting from a rectangular<br>
shape, is reduced by large ventilation openings 26, 27 on<br>
both sides at mean regions, for example, to a diabolo shape,<br>
which allows to satisfy both the remaining heat requirement<br>
of the user but also a good ventilation via the openings on<br><br>
both sides, also extending traversely through the openings 2 6<br>
and 27. The permeability of this cover 25, as well as that of<br>
the cover 22, may be predetermined e.g. by a cover casing<br>
(not shown).<br>
A cover 28 according to Fig. 12 consists of a layer of<br>
insulating material fragmented into rectangular elements 29<br>
which are connected by a net 30 of a meshwork lying<br>
therebetween. The elements 29 are, for example, cushions of<br>
any known filling. The entire cover 28 may be enclosed in a<br>
cover casing 31, as indicated in the cross-sectional drawing<br>
according to Fig. 13.<br>
One alternative possibility according to Fig. 14 is the<br>
connection of the individual cushions 29 at the predetermined<br>
distance by a common meshwork 32.<br>
In all of the above-described cases, a conventional cover<br>
designed for a desired insulation with ventilation openings<br>
can be aerated in an enhanced manner such that the<br>
dissipation- of moisture is no longer ascribed solely to the<br>
absorbency and moisture transportation of the textiles and<br>
fillers, to the contrary, a ventilation results, particularly<br>
during body movements, with which the more humid air near the<br>
body is exchanged for absorptive ambient air. If body<br>
moisture is also absorbed in a conventional manner by the<br>
layer of insulating material, the discharge to the ambient<br>
air is then carried out not only through the (upper) side of<br>
the cover facing away from the body, but also traversely to<br>
the ventilation openings. The insulating material - for<br>
instance feathers or fibers - can therefore be kept dryer.<br>
In addition to this, according to an embodiment shown in<br>
Figs. 15 and 16, an optional possibility of closing the<br>
ventilation openings is provided. A cover designated as a<br>
whole as 33 has a layer 2 of insulating material having<br>
ventilation openings 3 which can concur with those of Figs. 1<br><br>
and 2 and which are therefore designated by the same<br>
reference numerals. As compared with the cover 1 of Figs. 1<br>
and 2, the cover 33 is provided with closing flaps 34, which<br>
are fixed each in an edge area by a seam 35 on the layer 2 at<br>
one side of the ventilation opening 3, and which have at<br>
least one bonding fastener 3 6 at the opposite edge, with<br>
which they are to be detachably fixed to the layer 2 and<br>
thereby cover the ventilation opening 3. The bonding fastener<br>
is e.g. a hook-and-loop fastener or an adhesive fastener.<br>
Other fasteners, such as buttons or snaps, are principally<br>
also possible, but they are not preferred due to the<br>
formation of hard punctiform surface spots. The closing flaps<br>
preferably consist of textile material, i.e. of strong<br>
ticking fabric, and block the ventilation openings 3 if the<br>
cover appears to be too cool in wintertime or if perspiration<br>
is desired, for instance, for health reasons. As shown, the<br>
closing flaps 3 4 may be arranged both on the upper side and<br>
on the lower side of the layer 2, so that the ventilation<br>
openings can not only be blocked but can be converted to air<br>
chambers which provide an even higher insulating effect.<br>
A cover may, of course, have a plurality of layers of<br>
insulating material,so as to provide the insulating effect<br>
like the conventional covers without ventilation openings of<br>
known "duo covers", by the number of layers respectively used<br>
and - with layers of varying thickness or different<br>
insulation properties - by the selection of the layers. These<br>
layers may then be sewn together, e.g. at the edges, be<br>
buttoned together or fixed to each other by a bonding<br>
fastener. They may also be held together by a cover casing.<br>
These variation possibilities may also be applied to the<br>
covers according to the invention, with there being the<br>
additional possibility that the ventilation openings may be<br>
brought to overlap between the layers in order to achieve as<br>
great a ventilation as possible, or to more or less close the<br>
ventilation openings by an offset between the layers, or to<br><br>
provide, when there is an offset between the layers, a longer<br>
path through the ventilation openings. Such an offset may be<br>
obtained by bonding means, such as hook-and-loop fasteners.<br>
Several lines of buttons or buttonholes may also allow an<br>
optional offset. Also, if the layers of a cover converge, an<br>
offset may e.g. be obtained by twisting a layer by 180<br>
degrees if the ventilation openings are distributed on each<br>
layer asymmetrically or not point-symmetrically.<br>
For quilted covers, in which the upper and lower plates are<br>
generally sewn together along the quilting seam (without<br>
spacing ribs), correspondingly flat ventilation openings are<br>
obtained due to the manufacturing process, in particular if a<br>
flat or non-voluminous filler material is used. In order to<br>
obtain ventilation openings also here which have a passage<br>
length in which the air moves in principle freely but calmly<br>
or slowly and is therefore maintained at a given volume,<br>
multilayered, in particular duo-layered quilted covers having<br>
separated ventilation openings have been shown to be<br>
advantageous, with chambers being formed therebetween in<br>
which an air volume is maintained.<br>
The advantages of a cover can also observed - actually<br>
surprisingly - in pillows in which the ventilation openings<br>
generally run traversely through the pillow only to a<br>
mattress or a like support, but which nevertheless still<br>
provide good ventilation due to the traverse connections and<br>
movements.<br><br>
