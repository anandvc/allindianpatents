The invention is directed to agents used in the retention of color values on fabrics formed from cellulose fibers (color clarification agents) and to a method for treatment of such fabrics.<br>
2.     ^BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION-<br>
Clothes made from cellulose fabrics often develop a grayish cast or appearance with wear and repeated washing. This unwanted effect is particularly evident in garments dyed with dark colors. It is believed that the grayish cast is caused, at least in part by generation of disordered fibers through mechanical action, The mechanical action incident to washing tears, splits, and/or breaks fibers, generating superficial disorder at the surface of the strands or threads from which the garment is made, Even after a thorough washing in which all ordinary dirt, e.g., protein, oil, starch and dust, has been removed, the clothes look faded and worn,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,738,682 disclosed a color clarification method involving the use of cellulase alone as a color clarification agent. As defined herein, a "color clarification agent" is an agent involved in the preservation or restoration of the initial appearance of a colored fabric throughout multiple washing cycles by removing fuzz and pills from the<br>
surface of the garment and/or fabric,   Such an agent has, to some extent, improved the<br>
i.       . ;   appearance of washed fabrics relative to washed fabrics not treated with the agent. Colored<br>
fabrics dyed with fugitive dyestuffs, such as those belonging to the direct dye class of dyes,<br><br>
develop a particularly faded appearance after repeated washing due to loss ot aye irora me fabric. The loss of color contributes to the aged look of the fabric. This color loss is not maintained or restored by treatment with cellulase alone, Therefore, a need exists for an unproved agent which will more effectively restore the attractive look of fabrics which have developed a grayish cast after frequent washing, or maintain the original appearance of fabrics that are washed many times, thereby offering the consumer a chance to avoid discarding worn looking, but still serviceable cellulose fabric garments.<br>
Some surfactants have been found to boost the action of cellulase. These include ethoxylated CirCz0 alcohols or alkyl-phenols with 10-100 ethoxy groups (WO 91/19794). Polymers of one or more monomers selected from the group of vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl alcohol, vinyl carboxylate (especially polyvinyl acetate), acrylamide, soluble acrylates, and copolymers of these (WO 91/19807) are reported to increase cellulase enzymatic effect for color clarification of textiles. However, no other polymers are known in the art to have such boosting action.<br>
Polymers, such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, are known in the art to suspend particles in solution and sequester dyes in solution, thereby preventing dye transfer from one fabric to another (V.B. Croud, The influence of washing powder components on dye loss and dye fading, JSDC, 112 (1996) 117-122; F. Runge et al.f Binding equilibria of multiazo dyes with polymeric dye transfer inhibitors, Berichte der Bunsen-Gesellschaft-Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 100, No. 5 (1996) 661-670). Other polymers reported to provide dye transfer inhibition are polyamine N-oxides (WO 95/33028) and combinations of polyamino acids and polyalkylene glycols (WO 95/16767) but these have not been reported to give improvement of cellulase color clarification performance,<br><br>
, 3.     ' SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to a color clarification method comprising treating a colored fabric with a cellulase and a polymer selected from the group consisting of a polyalkylene oxide graft polymer, a polyamino acid polymer, and a carboxylated polysaccharide polymer in an amount effective to preserve the color of the fabric after at least one wash cycle.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the addition of a polymer selected from the group<br>
consisting of a polyalkylene oxide graft polymer, a polyamino acid polymer, and a<br>
carboxylated polysaccharide polymer boosts the color clarification effect of a cellulase,<br>
Polyamino acids (EP 612842) and carboxylated polysaccharides (USP 3,723,322) are known<br>
in the art as detergent builders where they function as dispersants and to sequester metal<br>
cations and improve detergency and soil removal. â€¢    ' i<br>
In the prior art, a polyalkylene oxide graft polymer has been found to inhibit<br>
grayness, i.e., the redeposition of soil particles and greases on the wash during washing<br>
(U.S. Patent Nos. 4,846,994 and 4,746,456), in detergent compositions (U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,874,537, WO 95/22593), or as anticrease agents for dying, whitening,   bleaching, or<br>
washing textiles (U.S. Patent No. 4,705,525),   Polymers of esterified polyalkylene glycol<br>
backbone grafted with ethyenically unsaturated monomers have also been used as dyeing<br>
assistants to give increased dye yield (USP 4,705,525).<br>
Therefore, in one embodiment, a colored fabric is treated with cellulase and a<br>
polymer selected from the group consisting of a polyalkylene oxide graft polymer, a<br>
polyamino acid polymer, and a carboxylated polysaccharide polymer in an amount effective<br>
to preserve the color of said fabric relative to a fabric treated without polymer but with<br>
cellulase after at least one wash cycle,<br><br>
It has also surprisingly been found that cellulase boosts the color clarification effect of polymers such as polyamino acids and carboxylated polysaccharides. Therefore, in another embodiment, the colored fabric is treated with cellulase and a polymer selected from the group consisting of a polyamino acid polymer and a carboxylated polysaccharide polymer in an amount effective to preserve the color of said fabric relative to a fabric treated without cellulase but with polymer after at least one wash cycle.<br>

Figure 1 shows Celluzyme 2.0L dosed in 2 g/L of a commercially available light duty liquid detergent (SoflanÂ®, Colgate-Palmolive), with 0, 5, and 10 ppm SCOTEX XL after 9 Mini-Terg wash/dry cycles.<br>
5.	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
5.1     Fabric<br>
The method of the invention is directed to colored cellulose fabrics, i.e., fabrics<br>
i<br>
with another color than white,  The effect is most striking on fabrics of dark colors, particularly those colored with fugitive dyestuffs, such as belong to the direct dye class of dyestuffs,<br>
5.2. Cellulase<br>
The cellulase to be used according to the present invention may be any cellulase having cellulolytic activity, i,e,, hydrolyzes cellulose, either in the acid, the neutral or the alkaline pH-rsqge and having cellobiohydrolase, exo-cellobiohydrolases, endoglucanases,<br><br>
and/or J3-glucosidase activity (multicomponent or monocomponent).  The cellulase may be<br>
of fungal or bacterial origin, which may be obtainable or isolated and purified from<br>
microorganisms which are known to be capable of producing cellulolytic enzymes, e.g.,<br>
species of Humicola, Coprinus, Tfiielavia, Myceliopthora, Fusariian, Myceliophthora,<br>
Acremonium, Cephalosporium, Scytalidium, Penicillium or Aspergillus (see, for example,<br>
EP 458162), especially those produced or producible by a strain selected from the species<br>
Humicola insolens (reclassified as Scytalidium thermophilwn, see for example, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,435,307), Coprinus cinereus, Fusarium oxysporwn, Myceliophthora<br>

Cellulase may also be obtainable from Trichoderma (particularly T. viri.de, T. reesei, and<br>
7, koningii), alkalophilic Bacillus (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,844,890 and EP<br>
458162), and Streptomyces (see, for example, EP 458162).<br>
The cellulase used in the method of the present invention may be produced by<br>
fermentation of the above mentioned microbial strain on a nutrient medium containing<br><br>
suitable carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, using procedures known in the art (see, e.g., Bennett, J,W. and LaSure, L. (eds.). More Gene Manipulations in Fungi, Academic Press, CA, 1991),  Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published compositions (e.g., in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection).  Temperature ranges and other conditions suitable for growth and cellulase production are known in the art (see, e.g., Bailey, J.E., and Ollis, D.F., Biochemical Engineering Fundamentals, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, 1986).<br>
As defined herein, the term "fermentation" is any method of cultivation of a cell resulting in the expression or isolation of the cellulase.  Fermentation may, therefore, be understood as comprising shake flask cultivation, small- or large-scale fermentation (including continuous, batch, fed-batch, or solid state fermentations) in laboratory or industrial fennenters performed in a suitable medium and under conditions allowing the cellulase to be expressed or isolated,<br>
The resulting cellulase produced by the methods described above may be recovered from the fermentation medium by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, centrifiigation, filtration, spray-drying, evaporation, or precipitation.  The recovered protein may then be further purified by a variety of chromatographic procedures, e.g., ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like.<br>
Alternatively, the cellulase used in the method of the present invention may be a monocomponent, i.e., a component essentially free of other cellulase components usually occurring in a cellulase system produced by a given microorganism, The single component may be a recombinant component, i.e., produced by cloning of a DNA sequence encoding the single component and subsequent cell transformed with-the DNA<br><br>
Sequence and expressed in a host, cf. e.g, International Patent Applications Wt) 91/17243<br>
and WO 91/17244 which are hereby incorporated by reference.  Other examples of<br>
j i monocomponent cellulases include but are not limited to those disclosed in JP-07203960-<br>
A and WO-9206209,  The host is preferably a heterologous host, but the host may under<br>
certain conditions also be the homologous host,<br>
Cellulase hydrolyzes carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), thereby decreasing the viscosity of the incubation mixture. The resulting reduction in viscosity may be determined by a vibration viscosimeter (e.g. MIVI 3000 from Sofraser, France). Determination of the cellulolytic activity, measured in terms of jQellulase Viscosity Unit (CEVU), may be determined according to the assay described below.<br>
The CEVU assay quantifies the amount of catalytic activity present in the sample by measuring the ability of the sample to reduce the viscosity of a solution of caxboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). The assay is carried out at 40Â°C; pH 9.0; 0,1M phosphate buffer; time 30 min; CMC substrate (33.3 g/L carboxymethyl cellulose Hercules 7 LFD); enzyme concentration approx. 3.3-4.2 CEVU/ml.  The CEVU activity is calculated relative to a declared enzyme standard, such as CelluzymeÂ® Standard 17-1194 (obtained from Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark).<br>
5.3.    Polymers<br>
The polymers used in the method of the present invention may be a polyethylene oxide graft polymer, a pqlyamino acid polymer or a carboxylated polysaccharide.<br><br>
5,3.1. Polyalkylene Oxide Graft Polymer<br>
The polyalkylene oxide graft polymers used in the method of the present invention are described and claimed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,846,994 and 4,746,456.  These polymers may be obtainable by grafting a (a) polyalkylene oxide backbone having a molecular weight of about 300-100,000 with (b) vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl esters of C2-C6 saturated monocarboxylic acids, methyl and ethyl acrylate, methyl and ethyl methacrylates, and their mixtures, in a weight ratio of (a) to (b) of about 1:0.2 to about 1:10.  The ester groups may be partially hydrolyzed, e.g., to an extent of up to about 15%. In a preferred embodiment, the polyalkylene oxide has.a molecular weight of from about 1000 to about 50,000, and the weight ratio of polyalkylene oxide to grafted monomer(s) (b), preferably vinyl acetate or vinyl propionate, is from about 1:0.5 to about<br>
h   The polyalkylene oxide may contain units of ethylene oxide propylene oxide, and/or butylene oxide.  In a preferred embodiment, the polymer used is derived from<br>
ethylene oxide having a molecular weight of about 1,000-50,000,  The grafted monomer<br>
j<br>
.i<br>
is vinyl acetate or vinyl propionate, and the weight ratio of polyethylene oxide to grafted Vinyl monomer is from about 1:0.5 to 1:6.<br>
Alternatively, the polyalkylene oxide polymer may be obtained according to the methods disclosed in U.S. Patent No, 4,705,525.<br>
5.3.2* Polyamino acid Polymers<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the polyamino acid is prepared from aspartic acid, glutamic acid or a combination thereof.<br><br>
, The polyaspartic acid and water soluble salts thereof useful in the present<br>
i<br>
invention can be described by die following formula;<br>
â–  i<br>
â–  I<br>
I :<br><br>
wherein m + a is from about 5 to about 85, preferably from about 16 to about 42, the ratio of a/B is from 1/0 to 0/1 (typically 1/4 to 4/1, in.most cases about 1/3); and M is hydrogen or a neutralising cation such as alkali metal (e.g. sodium or potassium), ammonium or substituted ammonium (e.g. mono-, di-, or triethanolammorrium). The a and 8 blocks in the above formula can vary in number of repeating units and can be randomly distributed along the chain. The absolute configuration about the asymmetric carbon atom can be D or L.<br>
The molecular weight of the polyaspartates herein can be from about 600 to about 40000, and is preferably in the range of from about 1000 to about 10000, based on the acid form.<br>
Polyaspartic acid can be prepared by known methods. Preparation by the reaction of maleic acid and ammonia is described in US 4,438,461. Other methods axe described e.g. in Sandek Â« al., Biopolymers, Voi.20, p.1615 (1981).<br><br>
, A method is described in US 5,057,597, wherein an agitated fluid bed of freely flowing, solid particulate aspartic acid is formed, then heated to and maintained at 180Â°C co 250Â°C for a time sufficient to polymerize the acid and drive off the water, while at the same time maintaining a mean particle size of about 150 pm or less and providing a degree of agitation sufficient to maintain the particles in a substantially free-flowing state. The product of this heating process h the anhydropolyaspartic acid, which is then recovered from the fluidized bed and hydrolyzed to a polyaspartate salt with aqueous base (e.g. aqueous sodium hydroxide). This process typically produces polyaspartate salts having (on an acid basis) a molecular weight of from about 1600 to about 3600, i.e. m + n in the above formula is from about 13 to about 30. If desired, the hydrolysis of anhydropolyaspartic acid can be conducted in acid media to produce polyaspartic acid. The polyglutamic acid and water soluble salts thereof can be described by the following formula:<br><br><br>
wherein m + n, the ratio of a/6, and M has the meaning stated above for polyaspartic acid, The a and S blocks in the above formula can vary in number of repeating units and can be randomly distributed along the chain. The absolute configuration about the asymmetric carbon atom can be D or L.<br>
The molecular weight of the polyglutamates herein can be from about 700 to about 40000, and is preferably in the range of from about 1000 to about 10000, based on the acid form.<br>
Poly glutamic acid can be prepared by known methods, similar to those described for polyaspartic acid.<br>
It is contemplated that a polyamino acid or a water soluble salt thereof consisting of any combination of aspartic acid residues and glutamic acid residues having a molecular weight from about 600 to about 40000, preferably in the range of from about 1000 to about 10000, based on the acid form, is useful in the present invention,<br>
5.3.3, Carboxylated Polysaccharides<br>
The carboxylated polysaccharides used in the method of the present invention have the following formula:<br><br><br>
in which X is selected from the free acid or water-soluble salt forms of -COOH, CH2OH, and CH2OCH2COOH and Y is selected from -H, and CHaCOOH/ in which n is a whole integer in a range, the lower limit of which is 10 and the upper limit is determined by the solubility characteristics in an aqueous system; the degree of substitution is 1.0 to 3.0; and the equivalent weight is from 162 to 220, calculated as the acid form.  They are derivatives of natural polymers such as carboxylated starches, celluloses, and alginates.<br>
5.3.3. Color Clarification Agents<br>
The cellulase and the polymer may be added either together in a preparation or separately, In a preferred embodiment, the cellulase and polymer is added to an aqueous wash solution,  Examples of such wash solutions are disclosed in Section 5.4 (detergent compositions). Cellulase is used in an amount corresponding to about 0.0001-10 mg (calculated as pure enzyme protein) of cellulase per liter of aqueous wash solution (wash liquor) or preferably 0.001-5 mg of cellulase (calculated as pure enzyme protein) per liter of aqueous wash solution, or an amount giving an activity in aqueous washing solution from about 0.001-10,000 CEVU/L, or preferably about 1 to 1000 CEVU/L, and more preferably from about 5-200 CEVU/L,  The polymer is used in an amount corresponding to about 0.1-10*000 ppm of the dry weight of the polymer or salt thereof in the aqueous washing solution, preferably about 1-200 ppm, and most preferably about 1-50 ppm. The enzyme and/or polymer preparation may be a water-soluble or water-dispersible solid, liquid, nonaqueous suspension, or water-soluble encapsulated product, particularly a non-dusting granulate or a stabilized liquid.  A stabilized liquid is stabilized against microbial<br><br>
â€¢ infection. Examples of stabilizing agents are inorganic salts, sugars, organic acias, antioxidants.<br>
In one embodiment, fabric is treated with cellulase and polymer during hand washing.  In another embodiment, fabric is treated with cellulase and polymer during<br>
either commercial or domestic machine washes.  A wash cycle is at least about 10<br>
â–     'i<br>
minutes.  In one embodiment, a wash cycle is from about 10 minutes to about 90 minutes.  In a preferred embodiment, a wash cycle is from about 10 minutes to about 30 minutes. In one embodiment, the cellulase and polymer may be added prior to beginning the wash cycle and/or during the wash cycle. The beneficial effect of adding cellulase plus polymer is increasingly realized with an increasing number of wash cycles.  Thus, the value of treatment with cellulase plus polymer is to prolong the acceptable appearance of the fabric, even after many wash cycles,  Optimal washing results are obtained when the washing solution is within the range of about pH 6-11, preferably about pH 7-10; when the temperature is in the range of about 5-95 Â°C, preferably about 25-65 Â°C; and at a liquid to fabric ratio of about 5:1 to 80:1, preferably about 10:1 to 40:1,<br>
5,4	Detergent Compositions<br>
According to the invention, the cellulase and the polymer may typically be components of a detergent composition.  The detergent composition of the invention may be in any convenient form, e.g., as powder, granules, paste or liquid.  Non-dusting granulates may be produced, e,gM as disclosed in U.S. Patent No, 4,106,991 and 4,661,452 (both to Novo Industri A/S) and may optionally be coated by methods known in the art, Examples of waxy coating materials axe polyethylene oxide) products (polyethyleneglycol, PEG) with mean molecular weights of 1000 to 20000; ethoxylated<br><br>
' nonylphenols having from 16 to 50 ethylene oxide units; etnoxyiatea rany aiconois in which the alcohol contains from 12 to 20 carbon atoms and in which there are 15 to 80 ethylene oxide units; fatty alcohols; fatty acids; and mono- and di- and triglycerides of fatty acids. Examples of film-forming coating materials suitable for application by fluid bed techniques axe given in patent GB 1483591. Liquid enzyme preparations may, for instance, be stabilized by adding a polyol such as propylene glycol, a sugar or sugar alcohol, lactic acid or boric acid according to established methods. Other enzyme stabilizers are well known in the art. Protected enzymes may be prepared according to the method disclosed in EP 238,216.  A liquid detergent may be aqueous, typically containing<br>
ujj&gt; to 70% water and 0-30% organic solvent, or may be completely nonaqueous,<br>
ii<br>
i! i ] i â– <br>
The detergent composition comprises one or more surfactants, each of which may be anionic, nonionic, cationic, or amphoteric (zwitterionic). The detergent will usually contain 0-50% of anionic surfactant such as linear alkylbenzenesulfonate (LAS), alpha-olefinsulfonate (AOS), alky I sulfate (fatty alcohol sulfate) (AS), alcohol ethoxysulfate (AEOS or AES), secondary alkanesulfonates (SAS), alpha-sulfo fatty acid methyl esters, alkyl- or alkenylsuccinic acid, or soap. It may also contain 0-40% of nonionic surfactant such as alcohol ethoxylate (AEO or AE), alcohol propoxylate, carboxylated alcohol ethoxylates, nonylphenol ethoxylate, alkylpolyglycoside, alkyldimethylamine oxide, ethoxylated fatty acid monoethanolamide, fatty acid monoethanolamide, or polyhydroxy alkyl fatty acid amide (e.g. as described in WO 92/06154).<br><br>
The detergent composition may additionally comprise one or more other enzymes, such as pullulanase, esterase, lipase, cutinase, protease, another cellulase, or peroxidase.<br>
Normally, the detergent contains 1-65% of a detergent builder, or complexing agent such as zeolite, diphosphate, triphosphate, phosphonate, citrate, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTMPA), alkyl- or aikenylsuccinic acid, soluble silicates or layered silicates (e.g. SKS-6 fromHoechst).<br>
The detergent builders may be subdivided into phosphorus-containing and non-<br>

6.3.    Example 3<br>
Fabrics from Examples 1 and 2 are evaluated for improved fabric appearance by instrumental methods. Fabric color is evaluated instrumentally using the Macbeth Color Eye and the CIELAB opponent-color coordinate system.  In this system, color is described by the values of L*, a*, and b*.  Lightness (gray scale) is described by L*, which equals 100 when the measured object is white and decreases to zero when the measured object is black.  Red-green is measured by a* (red-positive, green-negative), Yellow-blue is measured by b* (yellow-positive, blue-negative),  CIELAB measurements are made after 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 cycles with the following results:<br><br>
Average a* for Green Socks after Cycle Number<br>
Treatment       0	7	14	21	28<br>

D	-12.42	-11,05	-11.2	-10.97	-10,15<br>
A change in a* indicates a change in the original color of the fabric.  Treatment D, containing polyethylene oxide graft polymer and cellulase, caused the least change in a* to give the best color retention.<br>
Average L* for Black Fabric after Cycle Number<br>
Treatment       0	7	14	21	28<br>
A	29.08	31.78	32.99	34.97	36.49<br>

*<br>
An increase in L* for a dark fabric indicates an increase surface grayness. Treatments C and D, containing cellulase, had much lower L*, indicative of better color retention, than Treatments A or B,  Treatment D, containing polyethylene oxide graft polymer and cellulase, showed the least amount of graying,<br>
6.4.     Example 4<br>

4. The wash liquor is 2 g/L of a commercial light duty liquid laundry detergent (SoflanÂ®, Colgate-Palmolive),  The wash pH is 8-9. Test swatches are dosed with a sodium alginate polymer (SCOTEX XLÂ® from Pronova Biopolymer, Inc., Suite 201, 135 Commerce Way, Portsmouth, NH 03801).  SCOTEX XL is an example of a carboxylated polysaccharide,  SCOTEX XL is a naturally occurring linear alginate copolymer, recovered from seaweeds, comprised in the sodium salt form of fi-D-mannuronic acid and a~L-guluronk acid units linked by (l-&gt;4) glycosidic bonds.  Treated and control swatches are evaluated in pairs by six panelists,  Panelists are instructed to select the "best" swatch in each pair.  To obtain an average ranking, the number "2" is assigned to swatches ranked "best" and the number "1" is assigned to swatches ranked "worse." Scores are averaged,  The results are as follows;<br>
Enzyme Dose	SCOTEX Dose<br>
Test Set	(CEVU/L)	(ppm)	Average Panel Score<br>

In each case, swatches treated with sodium alginate are ranked as belter than swatches treated without sodium alginate, even though SCOTEX treated swatches are dosed with slightly lower amounts of cellulase.<br>
The panel results are consistent with instrumental color evaluations of treated swatches, expressed as Delta Lx. Increasing Delta Lx corresponds to a "better," darker, less gray appearance.<br>
