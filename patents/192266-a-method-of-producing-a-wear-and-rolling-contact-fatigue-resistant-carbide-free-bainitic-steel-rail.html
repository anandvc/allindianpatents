This invention relates to carbide-free bainitic steels and to methods of producing such steels- More especially, but not exclusively, the invention relates to carbide-free bainitic steels having enhanced wear resistance and rolling contact fatigue from which inter alia track and crane rails, railway points and crossings, railway wheels and special abrasive wear resistant sections and plates can be produced.<br>
Most track rails have hitherto been produced from pearlitic steels. Recent reviews have indicated that pearlitic steels are approaching the limit of their material property development for track rails. There is therefore a need to evaluate alternative types of steel having good wear and rolling contact fatigue resistance coupled with improved levels of ductility toughness and weldability.<br>
EP   0612852A1   discloses   a   process    for   manufacturing high-strength   bainitic   steel    rails   having   good   rolling-<br><br>
contact fatigue resistance in which the head of the hot-rolled rail is subjected to a discontinuous cooling programme which entails accelerated cooling from the austenite region to a cooling stop temperature of 500 to 300°C at a rate of 1° to 10°C per second, and then cooling the rail head further to a still lower temperature zone. Rails produced by this process were found to wear away more readily than conventional pearlitic rails and exhibited an improved resistance to rolling-contact fatigue. Thus, the increase in wear rate exhibited by the head surfaces of these rails ensured that accumulated fatigue damage wore away before defects occurred. The physical properties exhibited by these rails are achieved in part by the accelerated cooling regime referred to above.<br>
The solution proposed by EP 0612852A1 differs markedly to the method of the present invention which achieves in rail steels substantially enhanced wear resistance with excellent resistance to rolling-contact fatigue. These steels also show improved impact toughness and ductility in comparison with pearlitic rails. The method of the present invention also avoids the need for a complicated discontinuous cooling regime as specified in EP 0612852A1.<br>
Other similar documents specifying complicated discontinuous cooling regimes include GB 2132225, GB 207144, GB 1450355, GB 1417330, US 5108518 and EP 0033600.<br>
Track rails produced from iron carbide containing bainiti'- iteels h-ve been proposed previously. Whereas the fine  ferrite  lath  size  (-0.2-0.8  μm wide)  and high<br><br>
dislocation density of continuously cooled bainite combine to make the steels very strong, the presence in the microstructure of inter and intralath carbides leads to increased embrittlement which has to a large extent tended to  hinder  commercial  exploitation  of   such steels.<br>
It    is    known    that    the    embrittlement    problem   which occurs because of the presence of  deleterious carbides can be largely alleviated by employing relatively large silicon and/or   aluminium   additions    (-1-2%)    to   low-alloy   steels. The     presence    of     silicon     and/or     aluminium    in    steels continuously     transformed     to      bainite     encourages      the retention    of    ductile    high    carbon    austenite    regions    in preference  to the  formation of brittle   intralath cementite films,    and   depends   on    the   premise    that    the   dispersed, retained      austenite      should      be       both      thermally      and mechanically  stable.      It  has  been  shown  that  the  retained austenite   following   continuous   cooling   transformation   in the   bainitic   temperature   range    occurs    either   as    finely divided   thin   intralath   films,   or   in   the   form  of   "blocky" interpacket   regions.      While   the   thin   film  morphology has extremely high thermal and mechanical stability,  the blocky type     can     transform     to     high     carbon     martensite,     less conducive to good fracture toughness.     A ratio of thin film to    blocky   morphology    &gt;0.9    is    required    to    ensure    good toughness,    and   this    can   be    achieved    through   a   careful choice    of    steel    composition    and    heat    treatment.        This results   .'ri   an   essentially   carbide   free,    "upper   bainite" type   microstructure   based   on    bainitic    ferrite,    residual<br><br>
austenite and high carbon martensite.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide carbide-free bainitic steels with substantially enhanced ranges of hardness, and which exhibit clear advantages over known track rail steels.<br>
According to the present invention in one aspect there is provided a method of producing a wear and rolling contact fatigue resistant bainitic steel product whose microstructure is essentially carbide-free, the method comprising the steps of hot rolling a steel whose composition by weight includes from 0.05 to 0.50% carbon, from 1.00 to 3.00% silicon and/or aluminium, from 0.50 to 2.50% manganese, and from 0.25 to 2.50% chromium, balance iron and incidental impurities, and continuously cooling the steel from its rolling temperature naturally in air or by continuously accelerated cooling.<br>
The steel may additionally include one or more of the following by weight:- up to 3.00% nickel; up to 0.025% sulphur; up to 1.00% tungsten; up to 1.00% molybdenum; up to 3% copper; up to 0.10% titanium; up to 0.50% vanadium; and up to 0,005% boron.<br>
The carbon content of preferred steel compositions may be from 0.10 to 0.35% by weight. The silicon content may be from 1.00 to 2.50% by weight. Also the manganese content may be from 1,00% to 2.50% by weight, the chromium content may be between 0.35 and 2.25% by weight and the molybder .;-n ccJntent-may be from 0.15 to 0.60% by weight.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a wear and<br><br>
rolling   contact   fatigue   resistant   steel   produced   by   the processes  specified  in the  preceding  three paragraphs.<br>
In a still further aspect, there is provided a hot rolled or enhanced cooled rolling contact fatigue and wear resistant bainitic steel rail having an iron carbide-free microstructure, the rail, after hot rolling, having been cooled continuously naturally in air or by accelerated cooling.<br>
Steels in accordance with the invention exhibit improved levels of rolling contact fatigue strength, ductility, bending fatigue life and fracture toughness, coupled with rolling contact wear resistance similar to or better than those of the current heat treated pearlitic rails.<br>
Under certain circumstances it is considered advantageous for the rail to possess an adequately high wear rate in order to allow the accumulated rolling contact fatigue damage on the surface of the rail head to be continually worn away. One obvious way to increase the wear rate of the rail is by decreasing its hardness. A significant reduction in the hardness of the rail, however, causes severe plastic deformation to occur on the surface of  the  rail  head,   which  in  itself   is  undesirable.<br>
The novel solution to this problem lies, therefore, in being able to produce a sufficiently high hardness/strength rail to resist excessive plastic deformation during service, ."thereby i.;aintaining the desired rail shape, yet possessing    a    reasonably    high    wear    rate     for    continual<br><br>
rolling contact fatigue damage removal. This has been achieved in the present invention by the deliberate introduction in the essentially carbide free bainitic microstructure of a small proportion of soft pro-eutectoid ferrite, through an appropriate adjustment to the steel composition.<br>
One processing advantage of the natural air cooled bainitic steels in accordance with the invention over the current high strength pearlitic steel rails Ues in the elimination of heat treatment operations during both tho production of the rail and its subsequent joining by welding.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method of producing a wear and rolling contact &amp;tigue resistant carbide-free bainitic steel rail, the method comprising the steps of hot rolling to shape a steel whose composition by weight has from 0.05 to 0.50% carbon, fix&gt;m 1.00 to 3.00% silicon and/or aluminum, firom 0.50 to 2.50% manganese, from 0.25 to 2.50% chromium, from 0 to 3.00% nickel; from 0 to 0.025% sulphur, from 0 to 1.00% tungsten; from 0 to 1.00% molybdenum; from 0 to 3.00% copper, from 0 to 0.10% titanium, from 0 to 0.50% vanadium; and from 0 0 to 0,005% boron, balance iron and incidental impurities, and continuously cooling the rail from its rolling temperature to ambient temperature to produce the required wear and rolling contact fatigue resistant carbide-free bainitic steel rail.<br>
The invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings which :<br><br>
Figure 1 illustrates a hardness profile of an iron carbide-free bainitic steel rail in accordance with the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic CCT diagram for a carbide-free bainitic steel in accordance with the invention;<br>

Figure 6 illustrates abrasive wear lives of carbide-free bainitic steels in accordance with the invention and commercially available wear resistant materials against rounded quartz aibrasive;<br>
Figure 7 is a graph showing a hardness profile of flash butt welded carbide-free bainitic steel plate in accordance with the invention; and<br>
Figure 8 is a jominy hardenability curve for as-rolled carbide-free bainitic steel in accordance with the invention.<br>
A primary objective of the present invention is to provide a high strength wear and rolling contact fatigue resistant microstructure comprising primarily carbide free "bainite" with some high carbon raartensite and retained austenite in the head of the rail. In practice, it has been found that this high strength microstructure is also present in both the rail web and foot regions of the as-rolled rail. A typical Brinell hardness (HB) profile for a 113 lb/yd rail section is shown in Figure 1.<br>
The high strength head, web and foot regions of the rail provide good rolling contact and bending fatigue performance during service in track.<br>
This and other desired objectives are achieved by careful selection of the steel composition and by either<br><br>
continuously    cooling    the    steel     in    air    or    accelerated cooling  after hot  rolling.<br>
Composition ranges  for  steels   in  accordance with this invention are  set out  in Table  A  below.<br>
Within the ranges, variations may be made depending on, inter alia, the hardness, ductility etc. required. All steels are however essentially bainitic in nature and are carbide free. Thus, the preferred carbon content may fall within the range 0.10 to 0.35% by weight. Also, the silicon content may be from 1 to 2.5% by weight, the manganese content from 1 to 2,5% by weight, the chromium content from 0.35 to 2.25% by weight and the molybdenum content  from 0.15  to  0.60%  by weight.<br>
Steels in accordance with the invention generally exhibit hardness values of between 390 and 500 Hv30, although  it  is  also  possible   to   produce  steels  with  lower<br><br>
hardness levels. Typical hardness values, wear rates, elongation and other physical parameters can be seen from Table B appended hereto which identifies eleven sample steels in accordance with the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic CTT diagram. The addition of boron serves to retard the transformation to ferrite, such that during continuous cooling, bainite forms over a wide range of cooling rates. In addition, the bainite curve has a flat top so that the transformation temperature is virtually constant over a wide range of cooling rates, resulting in only small variations in strength across relatively large, air cooled or accelerated cooled sections.<br>
The steels listed in Table B were rolled to 30 mm thick plates (cooling rates of 30 mm thick plate are close to those at the centre of a rail head), from "125 mm square ingots, and normal air cooled from a finish rolling temperature of "1000°0 to ambient temperature. The as-rolled microstructures thereby developed comprise essentially a mixture of carbide free bainite, retained austenite with varying proportions of high carbon martensite as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
A comparison of the range of mechanical properties achieved in the as-rolled, 30 mm thick experimental bainitic steel plates with those obtained typically for currently produced mill heat treated rails (MHT) is given below:-<br><br><br>
The properties of the as-rolled, 30niin thick, bainitic steel plates represent a significant increase in strength and hardness levels compared with those of the heat treated pearlitic rail, accompanied by an improvement in the Charpy impact energy level from 4 to typically 35 J at 20°C. Charpy V-notch impact transition curves for two of the as-rolled bainitic rail steel compositions (0.22%C, 2%Cr, 0.5%Mo, B free and 0.24%C, 0.5% Cr, 0.5%Mo and 0.0025%B) together with a plain carbon, mill heat treated, pearlitic rail, are shown in Figure 4. The two bainitic rail steels can also be seen to retain high impact toughness down to temperatures as low as -60°C.<br>
The laboratory rolling contact wear performance of the as-rolled, 30 mm thick bainitic steel plates under a contact stress of 750 N/mm2 was established to be significantly better than that of the current pearlitic heat treated rails, as illustrated graphically in Figure 5.<br>
Tests carried out in relation to steels in accordance with the invention have also shown the bainitic steel compositions to offer a high resistance to wear under abrasive conditions, with relative wear lives of around 5.0<br><br>
in comparison with a mild steel standard, against a rounded quartz aggregate. Figure 6 shows that these wear life values are superior to those of many commercially available wear resisting materials, including Abrazo 450 and a 13%Cr martensitic steel.<br>
The fracture toughness (resistance to the propagation of a pre-existing crack) of the as-rolled 30 mm thick bainitic steel plates has been found to be significantly higher at between 45 and 60 MPam§ in comparison with those of the heat treated pearlitic rails, with typical values in the  range  30-40 MPamJ.<br>
The as-rolled, 30 mm thick steel plates were found to be readily flash butt weldable with hardness levels in the critical weld HAZ regions of normal air cooled, flash butt welded plates either matching, or slightly higher than, those of  the parent plate  material,   as  shown in Figure  7.<br>
The as-rolled, 30 mm thick experimental bainitic steel plates possessed high hardenabilities as illustrated in Figure 8, with almost constant hardness levels being developed at distances of between 1.5 and 50 mm from the quenched end, corresponding to cooling rates at 700°C of between 225 and 2°C/s.<br>
Whereas the invention has been described with particular reference to rails, other envisaged applications for these steels include crane rails, railway points and crossings (both as-cast and fabricated), railway wheels, special . brasive bear resistant sections and plates, and special   structural  applications.<br><br><br>
