The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the above said novel compounds, their derivatives, their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutical ly acceptable salts, their pharmaceutical ly acceptable solvates, novel intermediates and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
15	The compounds of general formula (I) lower total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoproteins (LDL),<br>
triglycerides and free fatty acids and increase high-density lipoproteins. The compounds of the general formula. (I) are useful in the treatment of metabolic disorders categorized, as Syndrome X. The characteristic features of Syndrome X include initial insulin resistance leading to hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance, which can further progress to non-insulin dependent<br>
20 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 diabetes), characterized by hyperglycemia which may lead to diabetic complications.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (1) are useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia especially type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases especially atherosclerosis. Also, the compounds of the general formula (I) are useful in treating<br>
25 renal diseases which may be associated with type 2 diabetes, for example, diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and end stage renal diseases, for the prevention on retardation of the progression of microalbuminuria to albuminuria. The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of psoriasis, polycystic    ovarian    syndrome,    osteoporosis,    inflammation    and    inflammatory    bowel    diseases,<br>
30 arteriosclerosis, xanthoma, pancreatic, myotonic dystrophy, disorders due to endothelial cell activation and hyperlipidemia.   The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of the above<br><br>
ZRC-MC-OOI<br>
2 mentioned diseases in combination or along with one or more hypoglycemic, antihyperglycemic, hypolipidemic,  hypolipoproteinemic agents such as statins, glitazones, sulfonyl  urea's,  fibric acid derivatives, a-glycosidase inhibitors or antioxidants and the like.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
5	The present invention relates to compounds represented by the general formula (I) having utility as<br>
hypocholesterolemic, hypolipidemic, hypolipoproteinemic, antiobesity and antihyperglycemic agents; methods for their preparation and methods for their use and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
Hyperlipidemia has been recognized as the major risk factor in causing cardiovascular diseases due to<br>
10      atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis and other such peripheral vascular diseases affect the quality of life of a<br>
large population in the world. 'During the treatment, emphasis is laid on lowering the elevated plasma<br>
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and plasma triglycerides as an important step to prevent occurrence<br>
of cardiovascular diseases.   The details of etiology in atherosclerosis and coronary artery diseases is<br>
discussed by Ross and Glomset [New Engl. J. Med. 295, 369 - 377 (1976)]. Plasma cholesterol is<br>
15      generally esterified with various serum' lipoproteins and numerous studies suggest an inverse relation<br>
between serum HDL-cholesterol concentration and cardiovascular disease. Numerous studies have<br>
indicated increased risk for occurrence of coronary artery diseases due to elevated LDL and VLDL-<br>
cholesterol levels [Stampfer et al N. Engl. J. Med. 325, 373-381(1991)]. In other studies protective<br>
effects of HDL against progression of atherosclerosis are illustrated. Thus, HDL is a crucial factor in<br>
20      treating diseases with increased levels of cholesterol [Miller et. al. Br. Med. J. 282, 1741-1744(1981);<br>
Picardo et al, Arteriosclerosis, 6, 434-441 (1986); Macikinnon et al, J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2548-2552<br>
(1986)].<br>
Diabetes affects a large population and this condition is associated with a number of other complications.  Usually, the disease  is associated with other disease conditions such as obesity,<br>
25 hyperlipidemia, hypertension arid angina. It is a well-recognized fact that improper treatment can aggravate impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, leading to frank diabetes." Presently, sulfonamides and biguanides along with insulin are agents of choice in treatment of diabetes. The limitations to this therapy include mild to severe hypoglycemia, which may lead to coma or in some cases may   lead   to   death,   which   are   mainly   due   to   unsatisfactory   glycaemic   control.       Recently,<br>
30 thiazolidinediones class of drugs having insulin-sensitizing action is being used in combination with other anti-diabetic agents, which includes troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. These are useful in the treatment of diabetes, and affect lipid metabolism. Patients with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes often have raised triglycerides and low HDL-chplesteroI concentrations and therefore, have greater risk of cardiovascular diseases. Thiazolidinediones are reported to have potential to induce tumor and are to<br>
35 cause hepatic dysfunction, which may lead to liver failure. Presently, there is need for safe and effective drug, to treat insulin resistance, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.<br><br>
ZRC-MC-OOI<br>
Obesity is another major health problem being associated with increased morbidity and mortality. It is a metabolic disorder, in which excess of fat is accumulated in the body. Although, the etiology of obesity is unclear, the general feature includes excess of calorie intake than that is consumed. Various therapies such as dieting, exercise, appetite suppression, inhibition of fat absorption etc. have been used to 5 combat obesity. However, the need for more efficient therapies to treat this abnormality is essential as obesity is closely related to several diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, gout, osteoarthritis, hyperlipidemia and reduced fertility. It also leads to social and psychological problems.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) is a member of the steroid/ retinoid/ thyroid hormone receptor family. PPARcc, PPARy and PPARS have been identified as subtypes of PPARs.<br>
10 PPARy activation has been found to play a central role in initiating and regulating adipocyte differentiation [Endocrinology 135, 798-800, (1994)] and energy homeostasis^ [Cell, 83, 803-812, (1995)]. During adipocyte differentiation, several highly specialized proteins are induced, which are being involved in lipid storage and metabolism. However, exact link from PPARy activation to changes in glucose metabolism and decrease in insulin resistance in muscle has not been clear. PPARot is involved in<br>
15 stimulating P-oxidation of fatty acids [Trends Endocrine. Metabolism, 4, 291-296 (1993)] resulting in plasma circulating free fatty acid reduction [Current. Biol. 5, 618-621, 1995)]. Recently, role of PPARy activation in the terminal differentiation of adipocyte precursors has been implicated in the treatment of cancer. [Cell, 79, 1147-1156 (1994); Cell, 79, 377-389 (1996); Molecular Cell, 465-470, (1998); Carcinogenesis, 1949-1953 (1998); Proc. Natl. Acad Sci., 94, 237-241 (1997); Cancer Research, 58,<br>
20 3344-3352, (1998)]. Since PPARy is expressed in certain cells consistently, PPARy agonists would lead to nontoxic chemotherapy.<br>
Leptin is a protein when bound to leptin receptors is involved in sending satiety signal to the hypothalamus.     Leptin  resistance would therefore  lead  to excess  food  in-take,  reduced energy expenditure, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. It has been reported that insulin sensitizers 25      lower plasma leptin concentration [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93,5793-5796, (1996): WO 98/02159)].<br>
PPAR a agonists have been found useful in the treatment of obesity (WO 97/36579). Dual PPAR a and y agonists have been suggested to be useful for Syndrome X (WO 97/25042). PPAR y agonists and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have exhibited synergism and indicated the usefulness of the combination in the treatment of atherosclerosis and xanthoma (EP 0753 298).<br>
.10	A number of compounds have been reported to be useful in the treatment of hyperlipidemia,<br>
hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia [US 5,306,726 US 5,985,884, US 6,054,453, EP 90 3343, PCT publications Nos. WO 91/19702, WO 94/01420, WO 94/13650, WO 95/03038, WO-95/17394, WO 96/04260, WO 96/04261, WO 96/33998, WO 97/25042, WO 97/36579, WO 98/28534, WO 99/08501, WO 99/16758, WO 99/19313, WO99/20614, WO 00/23417, WO 00/23445, WO 00/23451]."<br><br>

A mixture of substituted ester (prepared in example 2) (1.38 g), sodium hydroxide (3.0 %, 15 mL) in methanol (20 mL) was stirred at 20 °C to 25 °C for 10 h. Methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with water (20 mL) and it was acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid. 10 The product was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 20 mL). The organic layer was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (65 mL), water (2 x 80 mL), brine (80 mL) and it was dried over sodium sulfate to obtain an oily product (1.2 g, 94 %).The crude product (3 g) was separated by column chromatography using silica gel using hexane : ethyl acetate (9 : 1) as an eluent to afford the pure titled compound (0.75 g, 59 %).<br>

The sodium salt (obtained in example 26)(0.5 g) was dissolved in methanol (20 mL) and treated with calcium acetate (0.195 g) at 20 °C - 25 °C. Further, 50 mL of water was added when the calcium salt of the acid precipitates out. The precipitate was filtered, washed with water and then with di-isopropyl ether (2 x 20 mL) to afford the title compound.<br>
Similarly, other pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared in a similar way as described above using the appropriate acids/bases or according to the methods known in literature.<br>
The compounds of the present invention lowered random blood sugar level, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL, VLDL and increased HDL. This was demonstrated by in vivo animal experiments.<br>
Demonstration of in vivo efficacy of compounds:<br>
1. Plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol lowering activity in Swiss albino mice :<br>
Male Swiss albino mice (SAM) were obtained from NIN, Hyderabad, India and housed in Zydus animal house. All these animals were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 2$±1 °C. Animals were given standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water ad libitum. SAM of 20-25 g body weight range were used.<br>
The test compounds were administered orally to Swiss albino mice at 0.3 to 50 mg / kg/ day dose for 6 days. Control mice were treated with vehicle (0.25% of Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state lhour after drug administration on 0 and 6 day of the treatment. The blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus through heparinised capillary and the serum was analyzed for triglyceride and total cholesterol (Wieland, O. Methods of Enzymatic analysis. Bergermeyer, H., O., Ed., 1963. 211-214; Trinder, P. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1969. 6: 24-27). Measurement of plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol done using commercial kits (Zydus-Cadila, Pathline, Ahmedabad, India).<br><br>

2. Cholesterol lowering activity in hypercholesterolemic rat models<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats stock bred in Zydus animal house were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25±l °C. Rats of 180-200 g body weight range were used for the experiment. Animals were made hypercholesterolemic by feeding 2% cholesterol and 1% sodium cholate mixed with standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water ad libitum for 15 days. Throughout the experiment, the animals were maintained on the same diet (Petit, D., Bonnefis, M. T., Rey, C and Infante, R. Effects of ciprofibrate on liver lipids and lipoprotein synthesis in normal and hyperlipidemic rats. Atherosclerosis. 1988. 74: 215-225).<br>
The test compounds were administered orally at a dose 0.1 to 50 mg/ kg/ day for 6 days. Control group was treated with vehicle alone (0.25% of Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state lhour after drug administration on 0 and 6 day of the treatment. The blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus through heparinised capillary and the serum samples were analyzed for triglyceride and total cholesterol and HDL using commercial kits (Zydus-Cadila, Pathline, Ahmedabad, India). LDL and VLDL cholesterol were calculated from the data obtained for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride. The reductions of various parameters examined are calculated according to the formula.<br>
LDL and VLDL cholesterol levels were calculated according to the formula:<br>
LDL cholesterol in mg/dl = Total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - triglyceride<br>
VLDL cholesterol in mg/dl = Total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - LDL cholesterol<br><br>
