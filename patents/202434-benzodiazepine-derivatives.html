and their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties.<br>
In the central nervous system (CNS) die transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.<br>
L-glutamic acid, the most commonly occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays a critical role in a large number of physiological processes. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group forms Hgand-r.    controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) form the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors.<br><br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. On the basis of structural parameters, the different influences on the synthesis of secondary metabolites and the different affinity to low-molecular weight chemical compounds, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups: mGluRl and mGluR5 belong to group 1, mGluR2 and mGIuR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGIuR8 belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the group II can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer"s disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are chronic and acute pain, Huntington"s chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.<br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts per se and as pharmaceutically active substances, their manufacture, medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production, as well as the use of the compounds in accordance with the invention in the control or prevention of illnesses of the aforementioned kind, and, respectively, for the production of corresponding medicaments.<br>

All tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are also embraced herewith.<br>

The term "lower cycloalkyl" used in the present description denotes cyclic saturated hydrocarbon residues with 3-5 carbon atoms, preferably with 3 carbon atoms, such as cyclopropyl.<br><br>
The term "lower alkoxy" denotes a lower alkyl residue in the sense of the foregoing definition bonded via an oxygen atom.<br>
The term "halogen" embraces fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
The term "5 or 6 membered aryl or heteroaryl" embraces phenyl, thiophenyl, pyridine, partially hydrated pyridine.<br>
The expression "five-membered aromatic heterocycle" embraces, furan, thiazol, imidazol, pyrazol, 1,3-thiazol, 1,3-oxazol, 1,2-oxazol, 1,2-thiazol, 1,2,3-triazol, 1,2,4-triazol, 1,2,4-oxadiazol, 1,2,3-oxadiazol, 1,2,4-thiadiazol, 1,2,3-thiadiazol and tetrazol.<br>
The compounds of general formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured according to the following methods:<br><br>
According to scheme A, compounds of general formula I, in which X,R",R2 and R areas described above, can be prepared from compounds of general formula II via an acylation-deprotection-cyclization sequence:<br>
For example reacting compounds of general formula II with a dioxinone IV, in which R is as described above, in an inert solvent such as toluene or xylene at elevated temperatures, preferably between 80 °C and 160 °C gives rise to compounds of general formula III.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of general formula III can also be prepared by for example reaction of a compound of general formula II with a f3-ketoester (general formula IVa), in which R3 is as described above using the same conditions as described for the reaction with the dioxinones.<br><br>
Afterwards, cleaving the BOC protecting group in compounds of general formula III and concomitant cyclization of the deprotected compound yields the desired compounds of general formula I. Any other suitable amino protecting group, such as e.g. Fmoc.or benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), can be alternatively used instead of the BOC group.<br>
The deprotection-cyclization step can be carried out by treating the compounds of general formula III with for example a Bronsted acid such as trifluoroacetic acid in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM). The reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures between 06Cand 50 °C. It may be advantageous to use also anisoleor 1,3-dimethoxybenzene as a carbocation scavenger in the reaction mixture.<br><br><br>
According to scheme B, compounds of general formula II in which R1 is as described above for compounds where X is a single bond and R2 is as described above, can be prepared by different routes depending on the nature of R1 from the iodo-compounds of general formula V, in which R is as described above. As shown in scheme B, the key steps are coupling reactions of Suzuki- and Stille-type in presence or absence of carbonmonoxide. The exact conditions for the respective compounds of general formula II can be found in the experimental part.<br>
Compounds of general formula V, in which R2 is as described above, can be prepared by different routes depending on the individual residue R2:<br><br>
As shown in scheme C, compounds of general formula Va, in which R2 is lower alkyl, halogen or alkoxycarbonyl, can be prepared from the known compounds of general formula XI by iodination and subsequent protection of the synthetic intermediates with general formula XII.<br>
The iodination step can be carried out by for example using iodine monochloride in acetic acid in the presence of sodium acetate. The reaction can be for example carried out at temperatures between 20 °C and 80 °C<br>
The protection of the amino function can be achieved by for example reacting compounds of general formula XII with di-tert.-butyl-carbonate in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate. The reaction can be carried out in polar solvents such as acetone or butanone and the like at temperatures between 20 °C and 60 °C.<br>
As shown in scheme D, compounds of general formula Vb and Vc, in which R2 is attached via a sulfur- or nitrogen-atom (R: represents for example morpholin-4-yl; thiomorpholino-4-yl; dialkylamino; carboxymethylsulfanyl etc), respectively, can be prepared from the intermediate XIII by a nucleophilic substitution reaction with the respective amines or mercaptanes in the presence of a suitable base.<br><br><br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in a polar, aprotic solvent such as dimethyl formamide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone or dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. The base can be selected from the sterically hindered amines such as Hunig"s base, alkoxides such as sodium methoxide and tert.-butoxide, or hydrides such as sodium hydride. The reaction can be performed at temperatures between 20 °C and 110 °C, depending on the individual compounds to be synthesized.<br>
Compounds of general formula Vd in which R2 is attached via an oxygen atom (R2 represents for example lower alkoxy, lower halo-alkoxy, lower cydo-alkoxy, lower alkoxy-lower alkoxy; etc.) can be prepared as for example shown in scheme E:<br><br><br>
by a nudeophilic aromatic substitution reaction with the respective alcohol in the presence of a suitable base and subsequent protection of the amino function. The base can be selected from the class of Bronsted bases such as potassium hydroxide and the like. The reaction is preferably carried out in a polar, aprotic solvent such as dimethyl formamide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone or dimethyl sulfoxide and the like at temperatures between 20 °C and 100 °C.<br>
The protection of the amino function can be achieved by for example reacting compounds of general formula XV with di-tert.-butoxy carbonate in the presence of abase such as cesium carbonate. The reaction can be carried out in polar solvents such as acetone or butanone and the like at temperatures between 20 °C and 60 °C.<br>
Another method to achieve this protection step is to transform first the amino function in a compound with general formula XV into an isocyanate by reaction with phosgene or a phosgene equivalent in the presence of a suitable base, which is then treated with tert.-buty]-alcohol to give the desired compounds of general formula Vd.<br>
Another suitable method to achieve this protection step is to transform first the amino function in a compound with general formula XV into the corresponding di*Boc compound by reaction with excess di-tert-butoxy carbonate in the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), which is then treated with 2 eq. TFA in dichloromethane to give the desired compounds of general formula Vd.<br><br>
This reversal of steps, i.e. performing first the nucleophilic aromatic substitution on the key intermediate XTV and second protection of the amino-function as shown in synthetic scheme E can also be applied to those compounds with the general formula Vb and Vc (synthetic scheme D).<br>
Yet another method of preparing compounds of the general formula Vd is using the O-atlyl compound XIX and perfoming a deallylation-alkylation sequence as outlined in scheme E. The deallylation is preferably carried out by transition-metal catalyzed isomerisation, e.g. in the presence of Rhodium(I)-salts like for example Wilkinson"s catalyst [(PPh3)3RhG] or Palladium (II)-salts such as [(PPb^PdCb], followed by aqueous acid hydrolysis of the resulting vinyl ether. An example for this procedure can be found in /. Org. Chem. 1973, 38,3224. The alkylation of the phenol XX to the desired compound of the general formula Vd can be carried out -with electrophilic reagents of the general formula R-X, in which R has the meaning of lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, alkyl acetate or benzyl and X represents a leaving group, for example iodide, bromide, methanesulfonate or tolylsulfonate, in a suitable solvent in the presence of a base. The reaction is preferably carried out in polar, aprotic solvents, for example chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform or dichloroethane, or amides, for example dirnethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and N-mediyl-pyrrolidone, or sulfoxides, for example dimethyl sulfoxide. The base can be selected from the sterically hindered amines such as Hiinig"s base, alkoxides such as sodium methoxide and tert-butoxide, hydrides such as sodium hydride, hydroxides such as potassium hydroxide, carbonates such as potassium carbonate or hydrogen carbonates such as potassium hydrogen carbonate. The reaction can be performed at temperatures between -20 °C and 80 °C, depending on the individual compounds to be synthesized. For the synthesis of an O-tert.-butyl compound with the general formula Vd the phenol XX can be treated with DMF-di-tert.-butylacetal in toluene or benzene at 80 °C as described in Synthesis 1983,135.<br><br><br>
compounds of general formula Ve and Vf in which R2 is attached via a carbon atom (R2 represents for example lower alkyloxy-carbonyl-methyl; cyano-methyl, etc.) can be prepared from compound XIII or XIV by for example reaction with a malonic acid ester or -half-ester in the presence of a base followed by the removal of one of the alkyl carboxylates via decarboxylation. The exact reaction conditions vary with the identity of the individual compounds and are described in the examples.<br>
The key intermediates XIII and XIV can be prepared as already described in scheme C.<br>
For the one-carbon-moiety bearing compounds of the general formula Vh to VI, the synthesis starts from known methyl 3-amino-4-nitrobenzoate. Standard iodination as described in synthetic scheme C leads to the iodide XXI, which in turn can be protected with the Boc-group. The reduction of the methyl ester can for example be performed by treatment with lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride or diisobutylalumiiiumhydride in an aprotic solvent like for example THF, ether or toluene . The presence of an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol can be advantegous. The reduction is preferably carried out at temperatures between -20 °C and 0 °C. Further functionalization, like for example conversion into a chloride (Vk), of the resulting benzylic alcohol Vh follows<br><br>
standard procedures known to someone skilled in the art. The exact reaction conditions vary with the identity of the individual compounds and are described in the examples.<br><br>
According to scheme G, compounds of general formula II in which R1 is as described above for compounds where X is an ethynediyl group can be prepared by different routes from the iodo-compounds V, depending on the nature of Rl and R2 As shown in scheme G, the transformation can for example be carried out<br>
a)	by directly attaching the R"-alkynediyl-substituent to a compound of general formula V<br>
via a Sonogashira-type coupling followed by the reduction of the nitro group or<br>
b)	by two stepwise Sonogashira-type couplings, in which first trimethylsilyl-acetylene is<br>
coupled to a compound of general formula V to yield, after deprotection with sodium<br>
hydroxide in methanol, the intermediate XVIII which then can be transformed via a<br>
second Sonogashira-type coupling with the appropriate reactant R"-I, R"-Br or R1-<br>
OSO2CF3 and reduction of the nitro group to the desired compounds of general formula II.<br>

According to Scheme H, the dioxinones and fi-keto esters building blocks with the general formula IV and IVa can be prepared by methods known to someone skilled in the art from the corresponding carboxylic acid derivatives R3-COR, i.e. free adds, methyl or ethyl esters and acid chlorides. The exact conditions for the corresponding compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br>
Another synthetic route to prepare compounds of general formula I in which R1, R~ and X have the meaning as described above and R3 is a carbamide of general formula C(0)NR4R5, in which R* and R5 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or R4 and R5 together form a morpholino-residue or a N-methyl-piperazine, is outlined in scheme I:<br><br><br>
The exact conditions for the respective compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula 1. The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer"s disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spina] cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are acute and chronic pain, Huntington"s chorea, ALS, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficient functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression.<br>
The compounds of formula 1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection<br><br>
solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, -with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
The present invention relates also to the use of compounds of formula I and of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the production of medicaments, especially for the control or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders of the aforementioned kind.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are group II mGlu receptor antagonists. The compounds show activities, as measured in the assay described below, of 50 ujvi or less, typically 3 |iM or less, and ideally of 0.5 uM or less. In the table below are described some specific pKi values of preferred compounds.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
f3Hl-LY354740 binding on mGlu2 transfected CHO cell membranes<br>
Transfectiort and cell culture<br>
cDNA encoding the rat mGlu2 receptor protein in pBluescript II was obtained from Prof. S. Nakanishi (Kyoto, Japan), and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA I-amp from Invitrogen (NV Leek, The Netherlands). This vector construct (pcDlmGR2) was co-transfected with a psvNeo plasmid encoding the gene for neomycin resistance, into CHO cells by a modified calcium phosphate method described by Chen &amp; Okayama (1988). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco"s Modified Eagle medium with reduced L-glutamine {2 mM final concentration) and 10% dialysed foetal caif serum from Gibco BRL (Basel, Switzerland). Selection was made in the presence of G-418 (1000 ug/ml final). Clones were identified by reverse transcription of 5 ug totaj RNA, followed by PCR using mGlu2 receptor specific primers 5"-atcaagcttgggtttctggcactg-3" and 5"-agcatcactgtgggtggcataggagc-3" in 60 mM Tris HC1 (pH 10), 15 mM (NH^SO*, 2 mM MgCU, 25 units/ml Taq Polymerase with 30 cycles annealing at 60 °C for 1 min., extention at 72 °C for 30 s, and 1 min. 95 °C denaturation.<br>
Membrane preparation<br>
Cells, cultured as above, were harvested and washed three times with cold PBS and frozen at -80 °C. The pellet was resuspended in cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and homogenised with a polytron (Kinematica, AG, Littau, Switzerland) for 10s at 10 OOOrpm. After centrifiigation for 30 min. at 4 °C, the pellet was washed once with the same buffer, and once with cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA, {pH 7.4). Protein content was measured using the Pierce method (Socochim, Lausanne, Switzerland) using bovine serum albumin as standard.<br>
[5HJ-LY354740 binding<br>
After thawing, the membranes were resuspended in cold 50mM Tris-HCl buffer containing<br>
2 mM MgCU and 2 mM CaCl2, (pH 7) (binding buffer). The final concentration of the<br><br>
membranes in the assays was 25 ag protein/ml. Inhibition experiments were performed with membranes incubated with 10 nM [3H]-LY354740 at room temperature, for 1 hour, in presence of various concentrations of the compound to be tested. Following the incubations, membranes were filtered onto Whatmann GF/C glass fiber filters and washed 5 times with cold binding buffer. Non specific binding was measured in the presence of 10 uM DCGIV. After transfer of the filters into plastic vials containing 10 ml of Ultima-gold scintillation fluid (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland), the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR counter (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland).<br>
Data analysis.<br>
The inhibition curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving IC50<br>
values, and Hill coefficients.<br>

concomitant cyclization of3-aryl-N-(2-nitro-phenyl)-3-oxo-propionamides<br>
Method a: Catalytic hydrogenation<br>
A mixture of the nitro compound (1.0 mmol) in MeOH or EtOH and THF (1:1 ca. 20 mL) and 10% Palladium on carbon (20 mg) or Raney-Ni (20 mg) was stirred vigorously at 23 °C under hydrogen atmosphere until tic indicated complete conversion. The catalyst was filtered off, washed thoroughly with MeOH or EtOH and THF (1:1), the solvent was removed in vacuum to give the title compound, which was generally pure enough for further transformations.<br><br>
Method b: Reduction with SnCI:-2H20<br>
A mixture of the nitro compound (1.0 mmol) and SnCI2-2H20 {5.0 mmol) was either stirred in EtOH (30 mL) at 70-80 °C or alternatively in pyridine (3 mL) and DMF (12 mL) at 23 °C under Argon atmosphere until tic indicated complete conversion [cf. Tetr. ten. 1984,25, 839]. The reaction mixture was brought to pH 8 by addition of sat. NaHC03-sol. and extracted with EtOAc (2 x 100 mL). The combined organic layer were washed with brine and dried over Na:S04. Removal of the solvent left a yellow solid, which - if necessary - can be purified by silica gel column chromatography.<br>
Method c: Reduction with 2n and NR,C1<br>
To a mixture of the nitro compound (1.0 mmol) in EtOH/THF/sat. NH4Cl-soI. (1:1:1,30 mL) was added Zinc dust (3.0 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at 70 6C under Argon atmosphere until dc indicated complete conversion. Aqueous workup as described in method b.<br>
