Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved Streptococcus pneumonia vaccine.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Children less than 2 years of age do not mount an immune response to most<br>
polysaccharide vaccines, so it has been necessary to render the polysaccharides<br>
immunogenic by chemical conjugation to a protein carrier. Coupling the polysaccharide, a<br>
T-independent antigen, to a protein, a T-dependent antigen, confers upon the<br>
polysaccharide the properties of T dependency including isotype switching, affinity<br>
maturation, and memory induction.<br>
However, there can be issues with repeat administration of polysaccharide-protein<br>
conjugates, or the combination of polysaccharide-protein conjugates to form multivalent<br>
vaccines. For example, it has been reported that a Haemophilus influenzae type b<br>
polysaccharide (PRP) vaccine using tetanus toxoid (TT) as the protein carrier was tested<br>
in a dosage-range with simultaneous immunization with (free) TT and a pneumococcal<br>
polysaccharide-TT conjugate vaccine following a standard infant schedule. As the<br>
dosage of the pneumococcal vaccine was increased, the immune response to the PRP<br>
polysaccharide portion of the Hib conjugate vaccine was decreased, indicating immune<br>
interference of the polysaccharide, possibly via the use of the same carrier protein (Dagan<br>
etal., Infect Immun. (1998); 66: 2093-2098)<br>
The effect of the carrier-protein dosage on the humoral response to the protein<br>
itself has also proven to be multifaceted. In human infants it was reported that increasing<br>
the dosage of a tetravalent tetanus toxoid conjugate resulted in a decreased response to<br>
the tetanus carrier (Dagan et al. supra). Classical analysis of these effects of combination<br>
vaccines have been described as carrier induced epitopic suppression, which is not fully<br>
understood, but believed to result from an excess amount of carrier protein (Fattom,<br>
Vaccine XV. 126 (1999)). This appears to result in competition for Th-cells. by the B-cells<br>
to the carrier protein, and B-cells to the polysaccharide. If the B-cells to the carrier protein<br>
predominate, there are not enough Th-cells available to provide the necessary help for the<br>
B-cells specific to the polysaccharide. However, the observed immunological effects have<br>
been inconsistent, with the total amount of carrier protein in some instances increasing<br>
the immune response, and in other cases diminishing the immune response.<br><br>
Hence there remain technical difficulties in combining multiple polysaccharide<br>
conjugates into a single, efficacious, vaccine formulation.<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacterium responsible for<br>
considerable morbidity and mortality (particularly in the young and aged), causing invasive<br>
diseases such as pneumonia, bacteraemia and meningitis, and diseases associated with<br>
colonisation, such as acute Otitis media. The rate of pneumococcal pneumonia in the US<br>
for persons over 60 years of age is estimated to be 3 to 8 per 100,000. In 20% of cases<br>
this leads to bacteraemia, and other manifestations such as meningitis, with a mortality<br>
rate close to 30% even with antibiotic treatment.<br>
Pneumococcus is encapsulated with a chemically linked polysaccharide which<br>
confers serotype specificity. There are 90 known serotypes of pneumococci, and the<br>
capsule is the principle virulence determinant for pneumococci, as the capsule not only<br>
protects the inner surface of the bacteria from complement, but is itself poorly<br>
immunogenic. Polysaccharides are T-independent antigens, and can not be processed or<br>
presented on MHC molecules to interact with T-cells. They can however, stimulate the<br>
immune system through an alternate mechanism which involves cross-linking of surface<br>
receptors on B cells.<br>
It was shown in several experiments that protection against invasive pneumococci<br>
disease is correlated most strongly with antibody specific for the capsule, and the<br>
protection is serotype specific.<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of invasive bacterial<br>
disease and Otitis media in infants and young children. Likewise, the elderly mount poor<br>
responses to pneumococcal vaccines [Roghmann et a/., (1987), J. Gerontol. 42:265-270],<br>
hence the increased incidence of bacterial pneumonia in this population [Verghese and<br>
Berk, (1983) Medicine (Baltimore) 62:271-285].<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to develop an improved formulation of a<br>
multiple serotype Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide conjugate vaccine.<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae capsular saccharide conjugates from serotypes 19A and 19F wherein 19A is<br>
conjugated to a carrier protein which is a first bacterial toxoid and 19F is conjugated to a<br>
carrier protein which is a second bacterial toxoid.<br>
The term capsular saccharide includes capsular polysaccharides and oligosaccharides<br>
derivable from the capsular polysaccharide. An oligosaccharide contains at least 4 sugar<br>
residues. The terms conjugate and conjugated relate to a capsular saccharide covalently<br>
bonded to a carrier protein.<br><br>
For the purposes of this invention, "immunizing a human host against exacerbations of<br>
COPD" or treatment or prevention of exacerbations of COPD" or "reduction in severity of<br>
COPD exacerbations" refers to a reduction in incidence or rate of COPD exacerbations<br>
(for instance a reduction in rate of 0.1, 0.5,1, 2, 5,10, 20% or more), for instance within a<br>
patient group immunized with the compositions or vaccines of the invention.<br>
The term bacterial toxoid includes bacterial toxins which are inactivated either by genetic<br>
mutation, by chemical treatment or by conjugation. Suitable bacterial toxoids include<br>
tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, pertussis toxoid, bacterial cytolysins or pneumolysin.<br>
Mutations of pneumolysin (Ply) have been described which lower the toxicity of<br>
pneumolysin (WO 90/06951, WO 99/03884). Similarly, genetic mutations of diphtheria<br>
toxin which lower its toxicity are known (see below). Genetically detoxified analogues of<br>
diphtheria toxin include CRM197 and other mutants described in US 4,709,017, US<br>
5,843,711, US 5,601,827, and US 5,917,017. CRM197 is a non-toxic form of the<br>
diphtheria toxin but is immunologically indistinguishable from the diphtheria toxin.<br>
CRM197 is produced by C. diphtheriae infected by the nontoxigenic phase 197tox-<br>
created by nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis of the toxigenic carynephage b (Uchida et al<br>
Nature New Biology (1971) 233; 8-11). The CRM197 protein has the same molecular<br>
weight as the diphtheria toxin but differs from it by a single base change in the structural<br>
gene. This leads to a glycine to glutamine change of amino acid at position 52 which<br>
makes fragment A unable to bind NAD and therefore non-toxic (Pappenheimer 1977, Ann<br>
Rev, Biochem. 46; 69-94, Rappuoli Applied and Environmental Microbiology Sept 1983<br>
P560-564).<br>
The first and second bacterial toxoids may be the same or different. Where the first and<br>
second bacterial toxoids are different, it is meant that they have a different amino acid<br>
sequence.<br>
For example, 19A and 19F may be conjugated to tetanus toxoid and tetanus toxoid;<br>
diphtheria toxoid and diphtheria toxoid; Crm197 and CRM197, pneumolysin and<br>
pneumolysin, tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid; tetanus toxoid and CRM197; tetanus<br>
toxoid and pneumolysin; diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid; diphtheria toxoid and<br>
CRM197, diphtheria toxoid and pneumolysin; CRM197 and tetanus toxoid, CRM197 and<br>
diphtheria toxoid; CRM197 and pneumolysin; Pneumolysin and tetanus toxoid;<br>
pneumolysin and diphtheria toxoid; or pneumolysin and CRM197 respectively.<br><br>

saccharides 1, 3. 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F. 9V, 14,18C, 22F and 23F.<br>
Typically the Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine of the present invention will comprise<br>
capsular saccharide antigens (optionally conjugated), wherein the saccharides are<br>
derived from at least ten serotypes of S. pneumoniae. The number of S. pneumoniae<br>
capsular saccharides can range from 10 different serotypes (or "V, valences) to 23<br>
different serotypes (23V). In one embodiment there are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 different<br>
serotypes. In another embodiment of the invention, the vaccine may comprise conjugated<br>
S. pneumoniae saccharides and unconjugated S. pneumoniae saccharides. Optionally,<br>
the total number of saccharide serotypes is less than or equal to 23. For example, the<br>
invention may comprise 10 conjugated serotypes and 13 unconjugated saccharides. In a<br>
similar manner, the vaccine may comprise 11, 12, 13, 14 or 16 conjugated saccharides<br>
and 12,11,10, 9 or 7 respectively, unconjugated saccharides.<br>
In one embodiment the multivalent pneumococcal vaccine of the invention will be selected<br>
from the following serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B,<br><br>
17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F and 33F, although it is appreciated that one or two<br>
other serotypes could be substituted depending on the age of the recipient receiving the<br>
vaccine and the geographical location where the vaccine will be administered. For<br>
example, a 10-valent vaccine may comprise polysaccharides from serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B,<br>
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. An 11-valent vaccine may also include saccharides from<br>
serotype 3. A 12 or 13-valent paediatric (infant) vaccine may also include the 11 valent<br>
formulation supplemented with serotypes 6A and 19A, or 6A and 22F, or 19A and 22F, or<br>
6A and 15B, or 19A and 15B, or 22F and 15B, whereas a 13-valent elderly vaccine may<br>
include the 10 or 11 valent formulation supplemented with serotypes 19A and 22F, 8 and<br>
12F, or 8 and 15B, or 8 and 19A, or 8 and 22F, or 12F and 15B, or 12F and 19A, or 12F<br>
and 22F, or 15B and 19A, or 15B and 22F. A 14 vaient paediatric vaccine may include the<br>
10 valent formulation described above supplemented with serotypes 3, 6A, 19A and 22F;<br>
serotypes 6A, 8, 19A and 22F; serotypes 6A, 12F, 19A and 22F; serotypes 6A, 15B, 19A<br>
and 22F; serotypes 3, 8, 19A and 22F; serotypes 3, 12F, 19A and 22F; serotypes 3, 15B,<br>
19A and 22F; serotypes 3, 6A, 8 and 22F; serotypes 3, 6A, 12F and 22F; or serotypes 3,<br>
6A, 15Band22F.<br>
The composition in one embodiment includes capsular saccharides derived from<br>
serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (optionally conjugated). In a further<br>
embodiment of the invention at least 11 saccharide antigens (optionally conjugated) are<br>
included, for example capsular saccharides derived from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V,<br>
14, 18C, 19F and 23F. In a further embodiment of the invention, at least 12 or 13<br>
saccharide antigens are included, for example a vaccine may comprise capsular<br>
saccharides derived from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F<br>
or capsular saccharides derived from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F,<br>
22F and 23F, although further saccharide antigens, for example 23 valent (such as<br>
serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11 A, 12F. 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F,<br>
20, 22F, 23F and 33F), are also contemplated by the invention.<br>
The vaccine of the present invention may comprise protein D (PD) from Haemophilus<br>
influenzae (see e.g. EP 0594610). Haemophilus influenzae is a key causative organism<br>
of otitis media, and the present inventors have shown that including this protein in a<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine will provide a level of protection against Haemophilus<br>
influenzae related otitis media (reference POET publication). In one embodiment, the<br>
vaccine composition comprises protein D.   In one aspect, PD is present as a carrier<br><br>
protein for one or more of the saccharides. In another aspect, protein D could be present<br>
in the vaccine composition as a free protein. In a further aspect, protein D is present both<br>
as a earner protein and as free protein. Protein D may be used as a full length protein or<br>
as a fragment (WO0056360). In a further aspect, protein D is present as a carrier protein<br>
for the majority of the saccharides, for example 6, 7, 8, 9 or more of the saccharides may<br>
be conjugated to protein D. In this aspect, protein D may also be present as free protein.<br>
The vaccine of the present invention comprises one, two or more different types of carrier<br>
protein. Each type of carrier protein may act as carrier for more than one saccharide,<br>
which saccharides may be the same or different. For example, serotypes 3 and 4 may be<br>
conjugated to the same carrier protein, either to the same molecule of carrier protein or to<br>
different molecules of the same carrier protein. In one embodiment, two or more different<br>
saccharides may be conjugated to the same carrier protein, either to the same molecule<br>
of carrier protein or to different molecules of the same carrier protein.<br>
Any Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular saccharides present in the immunogenic<br>
composition of the invention apart from 19A and 19F may be conjugated to a carrier<br>
protein independently selected from the group consisting of TT, DT, CRM197, fragment C<br>
of TT, PhtD, PhtBE or PhtDE fusions (particularly those described in WO 01/98334 and<br>
WO 03/54007), detoxified pneumolysin and protein D. A more complete list of protein<br>
carriers that may be used in the conjugates of the invention is presented below.<br>
The carrier protein conjugated to one or more of the S. pneumoniae capsular saccharides<br>
in the conjugates present in the immunogenic compositions of the invention is optionally a<br>
member of the polyhistidine triad family (Pht) proteins, fragments or fusion proteins<br>
thereof. The PhtA, PhtB, PhtD or PhtE proteins may have an amino acid sequence<br>
sharing 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% identity with a sequence disclosed in<br>
WO 00/37105 or WO 00/39299 (e.g. with amino acid sequence 1-838 or 21-838 of SEQ<br>
ID NO: 4 of WO 00/37105 for PhtD). For example, fusion proteins are composed of full<br>
length or fragments of 2, 3 or 4 of PhtA, PhtB, PhtD, PhtE. Examples of fusion proteins<br>
are PhtA/B, PhtA/D. PhtA/E, PhtB/A, PhtB/D, PhtB/E. PhtD/A. PhtD/B, PhtD/E, PhtE/A,<br>
PhtE/B and PhtE/D, wherein the proteins are linked with the first mentioned at the N-<br>
terminus (see for example WO01/98334).<br><br>
Where fragments of Pht proteins are used (separately or as part of a fusion protein), each<br>
fragment optionally contains one or more histidine triad motif(s) and/or coiled coil regions<br>
of such polypeptides. A histidine triad motif is the portion of polypeptide that has the<br>
sequence HxxHxH where H is histidine and x is an amino acid other than histidine. A<br>
coiled coil region is a region predicted by "Coils" algorithm Lupus, A et al (1991) Science<br>
252; 1162-1164. In an embodiment the or each fragment includes one or more histidine<br>
triad motif as well as at least one coiled coil region. In an embodiment, the or each<br>
fragment contains exactly or at least 2, 3, 4 or 5 histidine triad motifs (optionally, with<br>
native Pht sequence between the 2 or more triads, or intra-triad sequence that is more<br>
than 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 % identical to a native pneumococcal intra-triad Pht<br>
sequence - e.g. the intra-triad sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 of WO 00/37105 for<br>
PhtD). In an embodiment, the or each fragment contains exactly or at least 2, 3 or 4 coiled<br>
coil regions. In an embodiment a Pht protein disclosed herein includes the full length<br>
protein with the signal sequence attached, the mature full length protein with the signal<br>
peptide (for example 20 amino acids at N-terminus) removed, naturally occurring variants<br>
of Pht protein and immunogenic fragments of Pht protein (e.g. fragments as described<br>
above or polypeptides comprising at least 15 or 20 contiguous amino acids from an amino<br>
acid sequence in WO00/37105 or WO00/39299 wherein said polypeptide is capable of<br>
eliciting an immune response specific for said amino acid sequence in WO00/37105 or<br>
WO00/39299).<br>
In particular, the term "PhtD* as used herein includes the full length protein with the signal<br>
sequence attached, the mature full length protein with the signal peptide (for example 20<br>
amino acids at N-terminus) removed, naturally occurring variants of PhtD and<br>
immunogenic fragments of PhtD (e.g. fragments as described above or polypeptides<br>
comprising at least 15 or 20 contiguous amino acids fromi a PhtD amino acid sequence in<br>
WO00/37105 or WO00/39299 wherein said polypeptide is capable of eliciting an immune<br>

If the protein carrier is the same for 2 or more saccharides in the composition, the<br>
saccharides could be conjugated to the same molecule of the protein carrier, (carrier<br>
molecules having 2 more different saccharides conjugated to it) [see for instance WO<br>
04/083251], Alternatively the saccharides may each be separately conjugated to different<br><br>
molecules of the protein carrier (each molecule of protein carrier only having one type of<br>
saccharide conjugated to it).<br>

described an 11 valent pneumococcai vaccine with all serotypes conjugated to PD.<br>
However, the present inventors have shown that opsonophagocytic activity was improved<br>
for antibodies induced with conjugates having 19F conjugated to DT compared with 19F<br>
conjugated to PD. In addition, the present inventors have shown that a greater cross<br>
reactivity to 19A is seen with 19F conjugated to DT. It is therefore a feature of the<br>
composition of the present invention that serotype 19F is conjugated to a bacterial toxoid,<br><br>
for example TT, pneumolysin, DT or CRM 197. In one aspect, serotype 19F is conjugated<br>
to DT. It is also a feature of the invention that serotype 19A is conjugated to a bacterial<br>
toxoid, for example TT, pneumolysin, DT or CRM 197. The remaining saccharide<br>
serotypes of the immunogenic composition may all be conjugated to one or more carrier<br>
proteins that are not DT (i.e. only 19F is conjugated to DT), or may be split between one<br>
or more carrier proteins that are not DT and DT itself. In one embodiment, 19F is<br>
conjugated to DT or CRM 197 and all of the remaining serotypes are conjugated to PD.<br>
In a further embodiment, 19F is conjugated to DT or CRM 197, and the remaining<br>
serotypes are split between PD, and TT or DT or CRM 197. In a further embodiment, 19F<br>
is conjugated to DT or CRM 197 and no more than one saccharide is conjugated to TT.<br>
in one aspect of this embodiment, said one saccharide is 18C or 12F. In a further<br>
embodiment, 19F is conjugated to DT or CRM 197 and no more than two saccharides are<br>
conjugated to TT. In a further embodiment, 19F is conjugated to DT or CRM 197, and the<br>
remaining serotypes are split between PD, TT and DT or CRM 197. In a further<br>
embodiment, 19F is conjugated to DT or CRM 197, and the remaining serotypes are split<br>
between PD, TT and pneumolysin. In a further embodiment, 19F is conjugated to DT or<br>
CRM 197, and the remaining serotypes are split between PD, TT and CRM 197. In a<br>
further embodiment, 19F is conjugated to DT or CRM197 and the remaining serotypes are<br>
split between PD, TT, pneumolysin and optionally PhtD or PhtD/E fusion protein. In a<br>
further embodiment, 19F is conjugated to DT or CRM197, 19A is conjugated to<br>
pneumoiysin or TT and the remaining serotypes are split between PD, TT, pneumolysin<br>
and optionally PhtD or PhtD/E fusion protein. In a further embodiment, 19F is conjugated<br>
to DT or CRM197, 19A is conjugated to pneumolysin or TT, one further saccharide is<br>
conjugated to TT, one further saccharide is conjugated to PhtD or PhtD/E and all further<br>
saccharides are conjugated to PD. In a further embodiment 19F is conjugated to DT or<br>
CRM197, 19A is conjugated to pneumolysin , one further saccharide is conjugated to TT,<br>
one further saccharide is conjugated to pneumolysin, 2 further saccharides are<br>
conjugated to PhtD or PhtD/E and all further saccharides are conjugated to PD.<br>
In one embodiment, the immunogenic composition of the invention comprises protein D<br>
from Haemophilus influenzae. Within this embodiment, If PD is not one of the carrier<br>
proteins used to conjugate any saccharides other than 19F, for example 19F is<br>
conjugated to DT whilst the other serotypes are conjugated to one or more different<br>
carrier proteins which are not PD, then PD will be present in the vaccine composition as<br><br>
free protein. If PD is one of the carrier proteins used to conjugate saccharides other than<br>
19F, then PD may optionally be present in the vaccine composition as free protein.<br>
The term "saccharide" throughout this specification may indicate polysaccharide or<br>
oligosaccharide and includes both. Polysaccharides are isolated from bacteria and may<br>
be sized to some degree by known methods (see for example EP497524 and EP497525)<br>
and optionally by microfluidisation. Polysaccharides can be sized in order to reduce<br>
viscosity in polysaccharide samples and/or to improve filterability for conjugated products.<br>
Oligosaccharides have a low number of repeat units (typically 5-30 repeat units) and are<br>
typically hydrolysed polysaccharides<br>
Capsular polysaccharides of Streptococcus pneutnoniae comprise repeating<br>
oligosaccharide units which may contain up to 8 sugar residues. For a review of the<br>
oligosaccharide units for the key Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes see JONES,<br>
Christopher. Vaccines based on the cell surface carbohydrates of pathogenic<br>
bacteria. An. Acad. Bras. Cienc, June 2005, vol.77, no.2, p.293-324. ISSN 0001-3765.<br>
In one embodiment, a capsular saccharide antigen may be a full length polysaccharide,<br>
however in others it may be one oligosaccharide unit, or a shorter than native length<br>
saccharide chain of repeating oligosaccharide units. In one embodiment, all of the<br>
saccharides present in the vaccine are polysaccharides. Full length polysaccharides may<br>
be "sized" i.e. their size may be reduced by various methods such as acid hydrolysis<br>
treatment, hydrogen peroxide treatment, sizing by emulsiflex® followed by a hydrogen<br>
peroxide treatment to generate oligosaccharide fragments or microfluidization.<br>
The inventors have also noted that the focus of the art has been to use oligosaccharides<br>
for ease of conjugate production. The inventors have found that by using native or slightly<br>
sized polysaccharide conjugates, one or more of the following advantages may be<br>
realised: 1) a conjugate having high immunogenicity which is filterable, 2) the ratio of<br>
polysaccharide to protein in the conjugate can be altered such that the ratio of<br>
polysaccharide to protein (w/w) in the conjugate may be increased (which can have an<br>
effect on the carrier suppression effect), 3) immunogenic conjugates prone to hydrolysis<br>
may be stabilised by the use of larger saccharides for conjugation. The use of larger<br>
polysaccharides can result in more cross-linking with the conjugate carrier and may<br>
lessen the liberation of free saccharide from the conjugate. The conjugate vaccines<br>
described in the prior art tend to depolymerise the polysaccharides prior to conjugation in<br><br>
order to improve conjugation. The present inventors have found that saccharide conjugate<br>
vaccines retaining a larger size of saccharide can provide a good immune response<br>
against pneumococcal disease.<br>
The immunogenic composition of the invention may thus comprise one or more<br>
saccharide conjugates wherein the average size (weight-average molecular weight; Mw)<br>
of each saccharide before conjugation is above 80kDa, 100kDa, 200kDa, 300kDa,<br>
400kDa, 500kDa or 1000kDa. In one embodiment the conjugate post conjugation should<br>
be readily filterable through a 0.2 micron filter such that a yield of more than 50, 60, 70,<br>
80, 90 or 95% is obtained post filtration compared with the pre filtration sample.<br>
For the purposes of the invention, "native polysaccharide" refers to a saccharide that has<br>
not been subjected to a process, the purpose of which is to reduce the size of the<br>
saccharide. A polysaccharide can become slightly reduced in size during normal<br>
purification procedures. Such a saccharide is still native. Only if the polysaccharide has<br>
been subjected to sizing techniques would the polysaccharide not be considered native.<br>
For the purposes of the invention, "sized by a factor up to x2" means that the saccharide<br>
is subject to a process intended to reduce the size of the saccharide but to retain a size<br>
more than half the size of the native polysaccharide. X3, x4 etc. are to be interpreted in<br>
the same way i.e. the saccharide is subject to a process intended to reduce the size of the<br>
polysaccharide but to retain a size more than a third, a quarter etc. the size of the native<br>
polysaccharide.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, the immunogenic composition comprises Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae saccharides from at least 10 serotypes conjugated to a carrier protein,<br>
wherein at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or each S. pneumoniae saccharide is native<br>
polysaccharide.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, the immunogenic composition comprises Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae saccharides from at least 10 serotypes conjugated to a carrier protein,<br>
wherein at least 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or each S. pneumoniae saccharide is sized by a<br>
factor up to x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7,.x8,.x9 or x10. In one embodiment of this aspect, the<br>
majority of the saccharides, for example 6, 7, 8 or more of the saccharides are sized by a<br>
factor up to x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9 or x 10.<br><br>
The molecular weight or average molecular weight of a saccharide herein refers to the<br>
weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the saccharide measured prior to conjugation<br>
and is measured by MALLS.<br>
The MALLS technique is well known in the art and is typically carried out as described in<br>
example 2. For MALLS analysis of pneumococcal saccharides, two columns (TSKG6000<br>
and 5000PWxI) may be used in combination and the saccharides are eluted in water.<br>
Saccharides are detected using a light scattering detector (for instance Wyatt Dawn DSP<br>
equipped with a 10mW argon laser at 488nm) and an inferometric refractometer (for<br>
instance Wyatt Otilab DSP equipped with a P100 cell and a red filter at 498nm).<br>
In an embodiment the S. pneumoniae saccharides are native polysaccharides or native<br>
polysaccharides which have been reduced in size during a normal extraction process.<br>
In an embodiment, the S. pneumoniae saccharides are sized by mechanical cleavage, for<br>
instance by microfluidisation or sonication. Microfluidisation and sonication have the<br>
advantage of decreasing the size of the larger native polysaccharides sufficiently to<br>
provide a filterable conjugate. Sizing is by a factor of no more than x20, x10, x8, x6, x5,<br>
x4, x3 or x2.<br>
In an embodiment, the immunogenic composition comprises S. pneumoniae conjugates<br>
that are made from a mixture of native polysaccharides and saccharides that are sized by<br>
a factor of no more than x20. In one aspect of this embodiment, the majority of the<br>
saccharides, for example 6, 7, 8 or more of the saccharides are sized by a factor of up to<br>
x2, x3, x4, x5 or x6.<br>
In an embodiment, (he Streptococcus pneumoniae saccharide is conjugated to the carrier<br>
protein via a linker, for instance a bifunctional linker. The linker is optionally<br>
heterobifunctional or homobifunctional, having for example a reactive amino group and a<br>
reactive carboxylic acid group, 2 reactive amino groups or two reactive carboxylic acid<br>
groups. The linker has for example between 4 and 20, 4 and 12, 5 and 10 carbon atoms.<br>
A possible linker is ADH. Other linkers include B-propionamido (WO 00/10599),<br>
nitrophenyl-ethylamine (Gever et al (1979) Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 165; 171-288).<br>
haloalkyl halides (US4057685). glycosidic linkages (US4673574, US4808700), hexane<br><br>
diamine and 6-aminocaproic acid (US4459286). In an embodiment, ADH is used as a<br>
linker for conjugating saccharide from serotype 18C.<br>
The saccharide conjugates present in the immunogenic compositions of the invention may<br>
be prepared by any known coupling technique. The conjugation method may rely on<br>
activation of the saccharide with 1-cyano-4-dimethylamino pyridinium tetrafluoroborate<br>
(CDAP) to form a cyanate ester. The activated saccharide may thus be coupled directly<br>
or via a spacer (linker) group to an amino group on the carrier protein. For example, the<br>
spacer could be cystamine or cysteamine to give a thiolated polysaccharide which could<br>
be coupled to the carrier via a thioether linkage obtained after reaction with a maleimide-<br>
activated carrier protein (for example using GMBS) or a haioacetyiated carrier protein (for<br>
example using iodoacetimide [e.g. ethyl iodoacetimide HCI] or N-succinimidyl<br>
bromoacetate or SIAB, or SIA, or SBAP). Optionally, the cyanate ester (optionally made<br>
by CDAP chemistry) is coupled with hexane diamine or ADH and the amino-derivatised<br>
saccharide is conjugated to the carrier protein using carbodiimide (e.g. EDAC or EDC)<br>
chemistry via a carboxyl group on the protein carrier. Such conjugates are described in<br>
PCT published application WO 93/15760 Uniformed Services University and WO<br>
95/08348 and WO 96/29094<br>
Other suitable techniques use carbodiimides, carbiinides, hydrazides, active esters,<br>
norborane, p-nitrobenzoic acid, N-hydroxysuccinimide, S-NHS, EDC, TSTU. Many are<br>
described in WO 98/42721. Conjugation may involve a carbonyl linker which may be<br>
formed by reaction of a free hydroxyl group of the saccharide with CDI (Bethell et al J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 1979, 254; 2572-4, Hearn et al J. Chromatogr. 1981. 218; 509-18) followed<br>
by reaction of with a protein to form a carbamate linkage. This may involve reduction of<br>
the anomeric terminus to a primary hydroxyl group, optional protection/deprotection of the<br>
primary hydroxyl group' reaction of the primary hydroxyl group with CDI to form a CDI<br>
carbamate intermediate and coupling the CDI carbamate intermediate with an amino<br>
group on a protein.<br>
The conjugates can also be prepared by direct reductive amination methods as described<br>
in US 4365170 (Jennings) and US 4673574 (Anderson). Other methods are described in<br>
EP-0-161-188, EP-208375 and EP-0-477508.<br><br>
A further method involves the coupling of a cyanogen bromide (or CDAP) activated<br>
saccharide derivatised with adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) to the protein carrier by<br>
Carbodiimide condensation (Chu C. et al Infect. Immunity, 1983 245 256), for example<br>
using EDAC.<br>
In an embodiment, a hydroxyl group (optionally an activated hydroxyl group for example a<br>
hydroxyl group activated to make a cyanate ester [e.g. using CDAP]) on a saccharide is<br>
linked to an amino or carboxylic group on a protein either directly or indirectly (through a<br>
linker). Where a linker is present, a hydroxyl group on a saccharide is optionally linked to<br>
an amino group on a linker, for example by using CDAP conjugation. A further amino<br>
group in the linker for example ADH) may be conjugated to a carboxylic acid group on a<br>
protein, for example by using carbodiimide chemistry, for example by using EDAC. In an<br>
embodiment, the pneumococcal capsular saccharide(s) is conjugated to the linker first<br>
before the linker is conjugated to the carrier protein. Alternatively the linker may be<br>
conjugated to the carrier before conjugation to the saccharide.<br>
A combination of techniques may also be used, with some saccharide-protein conjugates<br>
being prepared by CDAP, and some by reductive amination.<br>
In general the following types of chemical groups on a protein carrier can be used for<br>
coupling / conjugation:<br>
A)	Carboxyl (for instance via aspartic acid or glutamic acid). In one embodiment this group<br>
is linked to amino groups on saccharides directly or to an amino group on a linker with<br>
carbodiimide chemistry e.g. with EDAC.<br>
B)	Amino group (for instance via lysine). In one embodiment this group is linked to<br>
carboxyl groups on saccharides directly or to a carboxyl group on a linker with<br>
carbodiimide chemistry e.g. with EDAC. In another embodiment this group is linked to<br>
hydroxyl groups activated with CDAP or CNBr on saccharides directly or to such groups<br>
on a linker; to saccharides or linkers having an aldehyde group; to saccharides or linkers<br>
having a succinimide ester group.<br><br>
C)	Sulphydryl (for instance via cysteine). In one embodiment this group is linked to a<br>
bromo or chloro acetylated saccharide or linker with maleimide chemistry. In one<br>
embodiment this group is activated/modified with bis diazobenzidine.<br>
D)	Hydroxyl group  (for instance  via  tyrosine).  In one  embodiment this group  is<br>
activated/modified with bis diazobenzidine.<br>
E)	Imidazolyl group (for instance via  histidine).  In one embodiment this group is<br>
activated/modified with bis diazobenzidine.<br>
F)	Guanidyl group (for instance via arginine).<br>
G)	Indolyl group (for instance via tryptophan).<br>
On a saccharide, in general the following groups can be used for a coupling: OH, COOH<br>
or NH2. Aldehyde groups can be generated after different treatments known in the art<br>
such as: periodate, acid hydrolysis, hydrogen peroxide, etc.<br>
Direct coupling approaches:<br>
Saccharide-OH + CNBr or CDAP —&gt; cyanate ester + NH2-Prot   —&gt; conjugate<br>
Saccharide-aldehyde + NH2-Prot —&gt; Schiff base + NaCNBH3 —&gt; conjugate<br>
Saccharide-COOH + NH2-Prot + EDAC —&gt; conjugate<br>
Saccharide-NH2 + COOH-Prot + EDAC —&gt; conjugate<br>
Indirect coupling via spacer (linker) approaches:<br>
Saccharide-OH + CNBr or CDAP —&gt; cyanate ester + NH2—NH2 —&gt; saccharide—<br>
NH2 + COOH-Prot + EDAC —&gt; conjugate<br>
Saccharide-OH + CNBr or CDAP —&gt; cyanate ester + NH2—SH —&gt; saccharide—SH<br>
+ SH-Prot (native Protein with an exposed cysteine or obtained after modification of<br>
amino groups of the protein by SPDP for instance) —&gt; saccharide-S-S-Prot<br><br>
Saccharide-OH + CNBr or CDAP —&gt; cyanate ester + NH2—SH	&gt; saccharide—SH<br>
+ maleimide-Prot (modification of amino groups) —&gt; conjugate<br>
Saccharide-OH + CNBr or CDAP — &gt; cyanate ester + NH2—SH --&gt; Saccharide-SH +<br>
haloacetylated-Prot —&gt; Conjugate<br>
Saccharide-COOH + EDAC + NH2	NH2 — &gt; saccharide	NH2 + EDAC +  COOH-<br>
Prot —&gt; conjugate<br>
Saccharide-COOH + EDAC+ NH2—SH —&gt; saccharide—SH + SH-Prot (native<br>
Protein with an exposed cysteine or obtained after modification of amino groups of the<br>
protein by SPDP for instance) —&gt; saccharide-S-S-Prot<br>
Saccharide-COOH + EDAC+ NH2—SH        	&gt; saccharide—SH + maleimide-Prot<br>
(modification of amino groups) —&gt; conjugate<br>
Saccharide-COOH + EDAC + NH2—SH —&gt; Saccharide-SH + haloacetylated-Prot —&gt;<br>
Conjugate<br>
Saccharide-Aldehyde + NH2—NH2 —&gt; saccharide-~NH2 + EDAC + COOH-Prot —&gt;<br>
conjugate<br>
Note: instead of EDAC above, any suitable carbodiimide may be used.<br>
In summary, the types of protein carrier chemical group that may be generally used for<br>
coupling with a saccharide are amino groups (for instance on lysine residues), COOH<br>
groups (for instance on aspartic and glutamic acid residues) and SH groups (if accessible)<br>
(for instance on cysteine residues.<br>
Optionally the ratio of carrier protein to S. pneumoniae saccharide is between 1:5 and 5:1;<br>
1:2 and 2.5:1; 1:1 and 2:1 (w/w). In an embodiment, the majority of the conjugates, for<br>
example 6, 7, 8, 9 or more of the conjugates have a ratio of carrier protein to saccharide<br>
that is greater than 1:1, for example 1.1:1, 1.2:1, 1.3:1, 1.4:1, 1.5:1 or 1.6:1.<br><br>
In an embodiment, at least one S. pneumoniae saccharide is conjugated to a carrier<br>
protein via a linker using CDAP and EDAC. For example, 18C may be conjugated to a<br>
protein via a linker (for example those with two hydrazino groups at its ends such as ADH)<br>
using CDAP and EDAC as described above. When a linker is used, CDAP may be used<br>
to conjugate the saccharide to a linker and EDAC may then be used to conjugate the<br>
linker to a protein or, alternatively EDAC may be used first to conjugate the linker to the<br>
protein, after which CDAP may be used to conjugate the linker to the saccharide.<br>
In general, the immunogenic composition of the invention may comprise a dose of each<br>
saccharide conjugate between 0,1 and 20g, 1 and 10g or 1 and 3g of saccharide.<br>
In an embodiment, the immunogenic composition of the invention contains each S.<br>
pneumoniae capsular saccharide at a dose of between 0.1-20g; 0.5-10g; 0,5- 5g or 1-<br>
3g of saccharide. In an embodiment, capsular saccharides may be present at different<br>
dosages, for example some capsular saccharides may be present at a dose of exactly<br>
1g or some capsular saccharides may be present at a dose of exactly 3g. In an<br>
embodiment, saccharides from serotypes 3, 18C and 19F (or 4, 18C and 19F) are<br>
present at a higher dose than other saccharides. In one aspect of this embodiment,<br>
serotypes 3,18C and 19F (or 4, 18C and 19F) are present at a dose of around or exactly<br>
3 g whilst other saccharides in the immunogenic composition are present at a dose of<br>
around or exactly 1g.<br>
"Around" or "approximately" are defined as within 10% more or less of the given figure for<br>
the purposes of the invention.<br>
In an embodiment, at least one of the S. pneumoniae capsular saccharides is directly<br>
conjugated to a carrier protein. Optionally the at least one of the S. pneumoniae capsular<br>
saccharides is directly conjugated by CDAP. In an embodiment, the majority of the<br>
capsular saccharides for example 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more are directly linked to the carrier<br>
protein by CDAP (see WO 95/08348 and WO 96/29094)<br>
The immunogenic composition may comprise Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins, herein<br>
termed Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins of the invention. Such proteins may be used<br>
as carrier proteins, or may be present as free proteins, or may be present both as carrier<br>
proteins and as free proteins.  The Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins of the invention<br><br>
are either surface exposed, at least during part of the life cycle of the pneumococcus, or<br>
are proteins which are secreted or released by the pneumococcus. Optionally the<br>
proteins of the invention are selected from the following categories, such as proteins<br>
having a Type II Signal sequence motif of LXXC (where X is any amino acid, e.g., the<br>
polyhistidine triad family (PhtX)), choline binding proteins (CbpX), proteins having a Type I<br>
Signal sequence motif (e.g., Sp101), proteins having a LPXTG motif (where X is any<br>
amino acid, e.g., Sp128, Sp130), and toxins (e.g., Ply). Examples within these categories<br>
(or motifs) are the following proteins, or immunologically functional equivalents thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the immtinogenic composition of the invention comprises at least 1<br>
protein selected from the group consisting of the Poly Histidine Triad family (PhtX),<br>

The Pht (Poly Histidine Triad) family comprises proteins PhtA, PhtB, PhtD, and PhtE. The<br>
family is characterized by a lipidation sequence, two domains separated by a proline-rich<br>
region and several histidine triads, possibly involved in metal or nucleoside binding or<br>
enzymatic activity, (3-5) coiled-coil regions, a conserved N-terminus and a heterogeneous<br>
C terminus. It is present in all strains of pneumococci tested. Homologous proteins have<br>
also been found in other Streptococci and Neisseria. In one embodiment of the invention,<br>
the Pht protein of the invention is PhtD. It is understood, however, that the terms Pht A,<br>
B, D, and E refer to proteins having sequences disclosed in the citations below as well as<br>
naturally-occurring (and man-made) variants thereof that have a sequence homology that<br>
is at least 90% identical to the referenced proteins. Optionally it is at least 95% identical<br>
or at least 97% identical.<br><br>
With regards to the PhtX proteins, PhtA is disclosed in WO 98/18930, and is also referred<br>
to Sp36. As noted above, it is a protein from the polyhistidine triad family and has the type<br>
II signal motif of LXXC. PhtD is disclosed in WO 00/37105, and is also referred to<br>
SpO36D. As noted above, it also is a protein from the polyhistidine triad family and has<br>
the type II LXXC signal motif. PhtB is disclosed in WO 00/37105, and is also referred to<br>
SpO36B. Another member of the PhtB family is the C3-Degrading Polypeptide, as<br>
disclosed in WO 00/17370. This protein also is from the polyhistidine triad family and has<br>
the type II LXXC signal motif. For example, an immunologically functional equivalent is<br>
the protein Sp42 disclosed in WO 98/18930. A PhtB truncate (approximately 79kD) is<br>
disclosed in WO99/15675 which is also considered a member of the PhtX family. PhtE is<br>
disclosed in WO00/30299 and is referred to as BVH-3. Where any Pht protein is referred<br>
to herein, it is meant that immunogenic fragments or fusions thereof of the Pht protein can<br>
be used. For example, a reference to PhtX includes immunogenic fragments or fusions<br>
thereof from any Pht protein. A reference to PhtD or PhtB is also a reference to PhtDE<br>
or PhtBE fusions as found, for example, in WO0198334.<br>
Pneumolysin is a multifunctional toxin with a distinct cytolytic (hemolytic) and complement<br>
activation activities (Rubins et al., Am . Respi. Cit Care Med, 153:1339-1346 (1996)). The<br>
toxin is not secreted by pneumococci, but it is released upon lysis of pneumococci under<br>
the influence of autolysin. Its effects include e.g., the stimulation of the production of<br>
inflammatory cytokines by human monocytes, the inhibition of the beating of cilia on<br>
human respiratory epithelial, and the decrease of bactericidal activity and migration of<br>
neutrophils. The most obvious effect of pneumolysin is in the lysis of red blood cells,<br>
which involves binding to cholesterol. Because it is a toxin, it needs to be detoxified (i.e.,<br>
non-toxic to a human when provided at a dosage suitable for protection) before it can be<br>
administered in vivo. Expression and cloning of wild-type or native pneumolysin is known<br>
in the art. See, for example, Walker et al. (Infect Immuri, 55:1184-1189 (1987)), Mitchell<br>
et al. (Biochim Biophys Acta, 1007:67-72 (1989) and Mitchell et al (NAR, 18:4010 (1990)).<br>
Detoxification of ply can be conducted by chemical means, e.g., subject to formalin or<br>
glutaraldehyde treatment or a combination of both (WO 04081515, PCT/EP2005/010258).<br>
Such methods are well known in the art for various toxins. Alternatively, ply can be<br>
genetically detoxified. Thus, the invention encompasses derivatives of pneumococcal<br>
proteins which may be, for example, mutated proteins. The term "mutated" is used herein<br>
to mean a molecule which has undergone deletion, addition or substitution of one or more<br>
amino acids using well known techniques for site directed mutagenesis or any other<br><br>
conventional method. For example, as described above, a mutant ply protein may be<br>
altered so that it is biologically inactive whilst still maintaining its immunogenic epitopes,<br>
see, for example, WO90/06951, Berry et al. (Infect Immun, 67:981-985 (1999)) and<br>
WO99/03884.<br>
As used herein, it is understood that the term "Ply" refers to mutated or detoxified<br>
pneumoiysin suitable for medical use (i.e., non toxic).<br>
Concerning the Choline Binding Protein family (CbpX), members of that family were<br>
originally identified as pneumococcal proteins that could be purified by choline-affininty<br>
chromatography. Ail of the choline-binding proteins are non-covalently bound to<br>
phosphorylcholine moieties of cell wall teichoic add and membrane-associated<br>
lipoteichoic acid. Structurally, they have several regions in common over the entire family,<br>
although the exact nature of the proteins (amino acid sequence, length, etc.) can vary. In<br>
general, choline binding proteins comprise an N terminal region (N), conserved repeat<br>
regions (R1 and/or R2), a proline rich region (P) and a conserved choline binding region<br>
(C), made up of multiple repeats, that comprises approximately one half of the protein. As<br>
used in this application, the term "Choline Binding Protein family (CbpX)" is selected from<br>
the group consisting of Choline Binding Proteins as identified in WO97/41151, PbcA,<br>
SpsA, PspC, CbpA, CbpD, and CbpG. CbpA is disclosed in WO97/41151. CbpD and<br>
CbpG are disclosed in WO00/29434. - PspC is disclosed in WO97/09994. PbcA is<br>
disclosed in WO98/21337.SpsA is a Choline binding protein disclosed in WO 98/39450.<br>
Optionally the Choline Binding Proteins are selected from the group consisting of CbpA,<br>
PbcA, SpsA and PspC.<br>
An embodiment of the invention comprises CbpX truncates wherein "CbpX" is defined<br>
above and "truncates" refers to CbpX proteins lacking 50% or more of the Choline binding<br>
region (C). Optionally such proteins lack the entire choline binding region. Optionally, the<br>
such protein truncates lack (i) the choline binding region and (ii) a portion of the N-<br>
terminal half of the protein as well, yet retain at least one repeat region (R1 or R2).<br>
Optionally, the truncate has 2 repeat regions (R1 and R2). Examples of such<br>
embodiments are NR1xR2 and R1xR2 as illustrated in WO99/51266 or WO99/51188,<br>
however, other choline binding proteins lacking a similar choline binding region are also<br>
contemplated within the scope of this invention.<br><br>
The LytX family is membrane associated proteins associated with cell lysis. The N-<br>
terminal domain comprises choline binding domain(s), however the LytX family does not<br>
have all the features found in the CbpA family noted above and thus for the present<br>
invention, the LytX family is considered distinct from the CbpX family. In contrast with the<br>
CbpX family, the C-terminal domain contains the catalytic domain of the LytX protein<br>
family. The family comprises LytA, B and C. With regards to the LytX family, LytA is<br>
disclosed in Ronda et a!., Eur J Biochem, 164:621-624 (1987). LytB is disclosed in WO<br>
98/18930, and is also referred to as Sp46. LytC is also disclosed in WO 98/18930, and is<br>
also referred to as Sp91. An embodiment of the invention comprises LytC.<br>
Another embodiment comprises LytX truncates wherein "LytX" is defined above and<br>
"truncates" refers to LytX proteins lacking 50% or more of the Choline binding region.<br>
Optionally such proteins lack the entire choline binding region. Yet another embodiment<br>
of this invention comprises CbpX truncate-LytX truncate chimeric proteins (or fusions).<br>
Optionally this comprises NR1xR2 (or R1xR2) of CbpX and the C-terminal portion (Cterm,<br>
i.e., lacking the choline binding domains) of LytX (e.g., LytCCterm or Sp91 Cterm).<br>
Optionally CbpX is selected from the group consisting of CbpA, PbcA, SpsA and PspC.<br>
Optionally, it is CbpA. Optionally, LytX is LytC (also referred to as Sp91). Another<br>
embodiment of the present invention is a PspA or PsaA truncate lacking the choline<br>
binding domain (C) and expressed as a fusion protein with LytX. Optionally, LytX is LytC.<br>
With regards to PsaA and PspA, both are know in the art. For example, PsaA and<br>
transmembrane deletion variants thereof have been described by Berry &amp; Paton, Infect<br>
Immun 1996 Dec;64(12):5255-62. PspA and transmembrane deletion variants thereof<br>
have been disclosed in, for example, US 5804193, WO 92/14488, and WO 99/53940.<br>
Sp128 and Sp130 are disclosed in WO00/76540. Sp125 is an example of a<br>
pneumococcal surface protein with the Cell Wall Anchored motif of LPXTG (where X is<br>
any amino acid). Any protein within this class of pneumococcal surface protein with this<br>
motif has been found to be useful within the context of this invention, and is therefore<br>
considered a further protein of the invention. Sp125 itself is disclosed in WO 98/18930,<br>
and is also known as ZmpB - a zinc metalloprqteinase. Sp101 is disclosed in WO<br>
98/06734 (where it has the reference # y85993). It is characterized by a Type I signal<br>
sequence. Sp133 is disclosed in WO 98/06734 (where it has the reference # y85992). It<br>
is also characterized by a Type I signal sequence.<br><br>

Examples of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae antigens or fragments thereof which<br>
can be included in a combination vaccine (especially for the prevention of otitis media)<br>
include: Fimbrin protein [(US 5766608 - Ohio State Research Foundation)] and fusions<br>
comprising peptides therefrom [eg LB1(f) peptide fusions; US 5843464 (OSU) or WO<br>

The proteins of the invention may also be beneficially combined. By combined is meant<br>
that the immunogenic composition comprises all of the proteins from within the following<br>
combinations, either as carrier proteins or as free proteins or a mixture of the two. For<br>
example, in a combination of two proteins as set out hereinafter, both proteins may be<br>
used as carrier proteins, or both proteins may be present as free proteins, or both may be<br>
present as carrier and as free protein, or one may be present as a carrier protein and a<br>
free protein whilst the other is present only as a carrier protein or only as a free protein, or<br>
one may be present as a earner protein and the other as a free protein. Where a<br>
combination of three proteins is given, similar possibilities exist. Combinations include,<br>
but are not limited to, PhtD + NR1xR2, PhtD + NR1xR2-Sp91Cterm chimeric or fusion<br>
proteins, PhtD + Ply, PhtD + Sp128, PhtD + PsaA, PhtD + PspA, PhtA + NR1xR2, PhtA +<br>
NR1xR2-Sp91Cterm chimeric or fusion proteins, PhtA + Ply, PhtA + Sp128, PhtA + PsaA,<br>
PhtA + PspA, NR1xR2 + LytC, NR1xR2 + PspA, NR1xR2 + PsaA, NR1xR2 + Sp128,<br>
R1xR2 + LytC. R1xR2 + PspA, R1xR2 + PsaA, R1xR2 + Sp128, R1xR2 + PhtD, R1xR2 +<br>
PhtA. Optionally, NR1xR2 (or R1xR2) is from CbpA or PspC. Optionally it is from CbpA.<br>
Other combinations include 3 protein combinations such as PhtD + NR1xR2 + Ply, and<br>
PhtA + NR1xR2 + PhtD.    In one embodiment, the vaccine composition comprises<br><br>
detoxified pneumolysin and PhtD or PhtDE as carrier proteins. In a further embodiment,<br>
the vaccine composition comprises detoxified pneumolysin and PhtD or PhtDE as free<br>
proteins.<br>
In an independent aspect, the present invention provides an immunogenic composition<br>
comprising at least four S. pneumoniae capsular saccharide conjugates containing<br>
saccharides from different S. pneumoniae serotypes wherein at least one saccharide is<br>
conjugated to PhtD or fusion protein thereof and the immunogenic composition is capable<br>
of eliciting an effective immune response against PhtD.<br>
An effective immune response against PhtD or fusion protein thereof is measured for<br>
example by a protection assay such as that described in example 15. An effective<br>
immune response provides at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% survival 7 days<br>
after challenge with a heterologous strain. Given that the challenge strain is heterologous,<br>
the protection afforded is due to the immune response against PhtD or fusion protein<br>
thereof.<br>
Alternatively, an effective immune response against PhtD is measured by ELISA as<br>
described in example 14. An effective immune response gives an anti-PhtD IgG response<br>
of at least 250, 300, 350, 400, 500, 550 or 600 g/ml GMC.<br>
For example, the immunogenic composition comprises at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10<br>
S. pneumoniae capsular saccharides from different serotypes conjugated to PhtD or<br>
fusion protein thereof. For example serotypes 22F and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 further selected<br>
from serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A,<br>
19F, 20, 23F and 33F are conjugated to PhtD. In an embodiment two or three of<br>
serotypes 3, 6A and 22F are conjugated to PhtD or fusion protein thereof.<br>
In an embodiment, the immunogenic composition of the invention comprises at least one<br>
S. pneumoniae capsular saccharide conjugated to PhtD or fusion protein thereof via a<br>
linker, for example ADH. In an embodiment, one of the conjugation chemistries listed<br>
below is used.<br>
In an embodiment, the immunogenic composition of the invention comprises at least one<br>
S. pneumoniae capsular saccharide conjugated to PhtD or fusion protein thereof, wherein<br>
the ratio of PhtD to saccharide in the conjugate is between 6:1 and 1:5, 6:1 and 2:1, 6:1<br><br>
and 2.5:1, 6:1 and 3:1, 6:1 and 3.5:1 (w/w) or is greater than (i.e. contains a larger<br>
proportion of PhtD) 2.0:1, 2.5:1, 3.0:1, 3.5:1 or 4.0:1 (w/w).<br>
In an embodiment, the immunogenic composition of the invention comprises pneumolysin.<br>
The present invention further provides a vaccine containing the immunogenic<br>
compositions of the invention and a pharmaceuticaily acceptable excipient.<br>
The vaccines of the present invention may be adjuvanted, particularly when intended for<br>
use in an elderly population but also for use in infant populations. Suitable adjuvants<br>
include an aiuminum salt such as aluminum hydroxide gel or aluminum phosphate or<br>
alum, but may also be other metal salts such as those of calcium, magnesium, iron or<br>
zinc, or may be an insoluble suspension of acylatecl tyrosine, or acylated sugars,<br>
cationically or anionically derivatized saccharides, or polyphosphazenes.<br>
The adjuvant is optionally selected to be a preferential inducer of a TH1 type of response.<br>
Such high levels of Th1-type cytokines tend to favour the induction of cell mediated<br>
immune responses to a given antigen, whilst high levels of Th2-type cytokines tend to<br>
favour the induction of humoral immune responses to the antigen.<br>
The distinction of Th1 and Th2-type immune response is not absolute. In reality an<br>
individual will support an immune response which is described as being predominantly<br>
Th1 or predominantly Th2. However, it is often convenient to consider the families of<br>
cytokines in terms of that described in murine CD4 +ve T cell clones by Mosmann and<br>
Coffman (Mosmann, T.R. and Coffman, R.L. (1989) TH1 and TH2 cells: different patterns<br>
of lymphokine secretion lead to different functional properties. (Annual Review of<br>
Immunology, 7, p145-173). Traditionally, Th1-type responses are associated with the<br>
production of the INF- and IL-2 cytokines by T-lymphocytes. Other cytokines often<br>
directly associated with the induction of Th1-type immune responses are not produced by<br>
T-cells, such as IL-12. In contrast, Th2-type responses are associated with the secretion<br>
of II-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10. Suitable adjuvant systems which promote a predominantly Th1<br>
response include: Monophosphoryl lipid A or a derivative thereof (or detoxified lipid A in<br>
general - see for instance WO2005107798), particularly 3-de-O-acylated<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL) (for its preparation see GB 2220211 A); and a<br>
combination of monophosphoryl lipid A, optionally 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid<br><br>
A, together with either an aluminum salt (for instance aluminum phosphate or aluminum<br>
hydroxide) or an oil-in-water emulsion. In such combinations, antigen and 3D-MPL are<br>
contained in the same particulate structures, allowing for more efficient delivery of<br>
antigenic and immunostimulatory signals. Studies have shown that 3D-MPL is able to<br>
further enhance the immunogenicity of an alum-adsorbed antigen [Thoelen et al. Vaccine<br>
(1998) 16:708-14; EP 689454-B1].<br>
An enhanced system involves the combination of a monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin<br>
derivative, particularly the combination of QS21 and 3D-MPL as disclosed in WO<br>
94/00153, or a less reactogenic composition where the QS21 is quenched with<br>
cholesterol as disclosed in WO 96/33739. A particularly potent adjuvant formulation<br>
involving QS21, 3D-MPL and tocopherol in an oil in water emulsion is described in WO<br>
95/17210. In one embodiment the immunogenic composition additionally comprises a<br>
saponin, which may be QS21. The formulation may also comprise an oil in water emulsion<br>
and tocopherol (WO 95/17210). Unmethylated CpG containing oligonucleotides (WO<br>
96/02555) and other immunomodulatory oligonucleotides (WO0226757 and<br>
WO03507822)are also preferential inducers of a TH1 response and are suitable for use in<br>
the present invention.<br>
Particular adjuvants are those selected from the group of metal Salts, oil in water<br>
emulsions, Toll like receptors agonist, (in particular Toll like receptor 2 agonist, Toll like<br>
receptor 3 agonist, Toll like receptor 4 agonist, Toll like receptor 7 agonist, Toll like<br>
receptor 8 agonist and Toll like receptor 9 agonist), saponins or combinations thereof.<br>
An adjuvant that can be used with the vaccine compositions of the invention are bleb or<br>
outer membrane vesicle preparations from Gram negative bacterial strains such as those<br>
taught by WO02/09746 - particularly N. meningitidis blebs. Adjuvant properties of blebs<br>
can be improved by retaining LOS (lipooligosacccharide) on its surface (e.g. through<br>
extraction with low concentrations of detergent [for instanct 0-0.1% deoxycholate]). LOS<br>
can be detoxified through the msbB(-) or htrB(-) mutations discussed in WO02/09746.<br>
Adjuvant properties can also be improved by retaining PorB (and optionally removing<br>
PorA) from meningococcal blebs. Adjuvant properties can also be improved by truncating<br>
the outer core saccharide structure of LOS on meningococcal blebs - for instance via the<br>
IgtB(-) mutation discussed in WO2004/014417. Alternatively, the aforementioned LOS<br><br>
(e.g. isolated from a msbB(-) and/or IgtB(-) strain) can be purified and used as an adjuvant<br>
in the compositions of the invention.<br>
A further adjuvant which may be used with the compositions of the invention may be<br>
selected from the group: a saponin, lipid A or a derivative thereof, an immunostimulatory<br>
oligonucleotide, an alkyl glucosaminide phosphate, an oil in water emulsion or<br>
combinations thereof. A further adjuvant which may be used with the compositions fo the<br>
invention is a metal salt in combination with another adjuvant. In an embodiment, the<br>
adjuvant is a Toll like receptor agonist in particular an agonist of a Toll like receptor 2, 3,<br>
4, 7, 8 or 9, or a saponin, in particular Qs21. In an embodiment, the adjuvant system<br>
comprises two or more adjuvants from the above list. In particular the combinations<br>
optionally contain a saponin (in particular Qs21) adjuvant and/or a Toll like receptor 9<br>
agonist such as a CpG containing immunostimulatory oligonucleotide. Other combinations<br>
comprise a saponin (in particular QS21) and a Toll like receptor 4 agonist such as<br>
monophosphory) lipid A or its 3 deacylated derivative, 3 D- MPL, or a saponin (in<br>
particular QS21) and a Toll like receptor 4 ligand such as an alkyl glucosaminide<br>
phosphate.<br>
In an embodiment, adjuvants are combinations of 3D-MPL and QS21 (EP 0 671 948 B1),<br>
oil in water emulsions comprising 3D-MPL and QS21 (WO 95/17210, WO 98/56414), or<br>
3D-MPL formulated with other carriers (EP 0 689 454 B1). In an embodiment, adjuvant<br>
systems comprise a combination of 3 D MPL , QS21 and a CpG oligonucleotide as<br>
described in US6558670, US6544518.<br>
In an embodiment the adjuvant is a Toll like receptor (TLR) 4 ligand, optionally an agonist<br>
such as a lipid A derivative particularly monophosphoryl lipid A or more particularly 3<br>
Deacylated monophoshoryl lipid A (3 D - MPL).<br>
3 D -MPL is available from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals North America and primarily<br>
promotes CD4+ T cell responses with an IFN-g (Th1) phenotype . It can be produced<br>
according to the methods disclosed in GB 2 220 211 A. Chemically it is a mixture of 3-<br>
deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A with 3, 4, 5 or 6 acylated chains. In an embodiment,<br>
the compositions of the present invention small particle 3 D- MPL is used. Small particle<br>
3 D -MPL has a particle size such that it may be sterile-filtered through a 0.22^im filter.<br>
Such preparations are described in International Patent Application No. WO 94/21292.<br><br>
Synthetic derivatives of lipid A are known and thought to be TLR 4 agonists including, but<br>
not limited to:<br>
OM174	(2-deoxy-6-o-[2-deoxy-2-[(R)-3-dodecanoyloxytetra-decanoylamino]-4-o-<br>
phosphono-(3-D-glucopyranosyl]-2-[(R)-3-hydroxytetradec^noytamino]-a-D-<br>
glucopyranosyldihydrogenphosphate), (WO 95/14026)<br>
OM 294 DP (3S, 9 R) -3-[(R)-dodecanoy1oxytetradecanoylamino]-4-oxo-5-aza-9(R)-[(R)-<br>
3-hydroxytetradecanoylamino]decan-1,10-diol,1,10-bis(dihydrogenophosphate) (WO99<br>
/64301 and WO 00/0462 )<br>
OM 197 MP-Ac DP ( 3S-, 9R) -3-[(R) -dodecanoyloxytetradecanoylamino]-4-oxo-5-aza-9-<br>
[(R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoylamino]decan-1,10-diol,1 -dihydrogenophosphate 10-(6-<br>
aminohexanoate) (WO 01/46127)<br>
Other TLR4 ligands which may be used are alkyl Glucosaminide phosphates (AGPs) such<br>
as those disclosed in WO9850399 or US6303347 (processes for preparation of AGPs are<br>
also disclosed), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of AGPs as disclosed in<br>
US6764840. Some AGPs are TLR4 agonists, and some are TLR4 antagonists. Both are<br>
thought to be useful as adjuvants.<br>
Another immunostimulant for use in the present invention is Quil A and its derivatives.<br>
Quil A is a saponin preparation isolated from the South American tree Quilaja Saponaria<br>
Molina and was first described as having adjuvant activity by Dalsgaard et al. in 1974<br>
("Saponin adjuvants", Archiv. fur die gesamte Virusforschung, Vol. 44, Springer Verlag,<br>
Berlin, p243-254). Purified fragments of Quil A have been isolated by HPLC which retain<br>
adjuvant activity without the toxicity associated with Quill A (EP 0 362 278), for example<br>
QS7 and QS21 (also known as QA7 and QA21). QS-21 is a natural saponin derived from<br>
the bark of Quillaja saponaria Molina which induces CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), Th1<br>
cells and a predominant lgG2a antibody response and is a saponin in the context of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Particular formulations of QS21 have been described which are an embodiment fo the<br>
invention, these formulations further comprise a sterol (WO96/33739). The saponins<br>
forming part of the present invention may be separate in the form of micelles, mixed<br><br>
micelles (optionally with bile salts) or may be in the form of ISCOM matrices (EP 0 109<br>
942 B1) , liposomes or related colloidal structures such as worm-like or ring-like<br>
multimeric complexes or lipidic/layered structures and lamellae when formulated with<br>
cholesterol and lipid, or in the form of an oil in water emulsion (for example as in WO<br>
95/17210). The saponins may be associated with a metallic salt, such as aluminium<br>
hydroxide or aluminium phosphate (WO 98/15287).<br>
Optionally, the saponin is presented in the form of a liposome, iSCOM or an oil in water<br>
emulsion.<br>
An enhanced system involves the combination of a monophosphoryl lipid A (or detoxified<br>
lipid A) and a saponin derivative, particularly the combination of QS21 and 3D-MPL as<br>
disclosed in WO 94/00153, or a less reactogenic composition where the QS21 is<br>
quenched with cholesterol as disclosed in WO 96/33739. A particularly potent adjuvant<br>
formulation involving tocopherol with or without QS21 and/or 3D-MPL in an oil in water<br>
emulsion is described in WO 95/17210. In one embodiment the immunogenic<br>
composition additionally comprises a saponin, which may be QS21.<br>
Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides or any other Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 agonist may<br>
also be used. The oligonucleotides for use in adjuvants or vaccines of the present<br>
invention are optionally CpG containing oligonucleotides, optionally containing two or<br>
more dinucleotide CpG motifs separated by at least three, optionally at least six or more<br>
nucleotides. A CpG motif is a Cytosine nucleotide followed by a Guanine nucleotide. The<br>
CpG oligonucleotides of the present invention are typically deoxynucleotides. In an<br>
embodiment the intemucleotide in the oligonucleotide is phosphorodithioate, or a<br>
phosphorothioate bond, although phosphodiester and other intemucleotide bonds are<br>
within the scope of the invention. Also included within the scope of the invention are<br>
oligonucleotides with mixed intemucleotide linkages. Methods for producing<br>
phosphorothioate oligonucleotides or phosphorodithioate are described in US5,666,153,<br>
US5.278.302 and WO95/26204.<br>
Examples of oligonucleotides have the following sequences. The sequences optionally<br>
contain phosphorothioate modified intemucleotide linkages.<br>
OLIGO 1(SEQ ID NO:1): TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ACG TT (CpG 1826)<br>
OLIGO 2 (SEQ ID NO:2): TCT CCC AGC GTG CGC CAT (CpG 1758)<br>
OLIGO 3(SEQ ID NO:3); ACC GAT GAC GTC GCC GGT GAC GGC ACC ACG<br><br>
OLIGO 4 (SEQ ID NO:4): TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT (CpG 2006)<br>
OLIGO 5 (SEQ ID NO:5): TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ATG CT (CpG 1668)<br>
OLIGO 6 (SEQ ID NO:6): TCG ACG TTT TCG GCG CGC GCC G (CpG 5456)<br>
Alternative CpG oligonucleotides may comprise the sequences above in that they have<br>
inconsequential deletions or additions thereto.<br>
The CpG oligonudeotides utilised in the present invention may be synthesized by any<br>
method known in the art (for example see EP 468520). Conveniently, such<br>
oligonudeotides may be synthesized utilising an automated synthesizer.<br>
The adjuvant may be an oil in water emulsion or may comprise an oil in water emulsion in<br>
combination with other adjuvants. The oil phase of the emulsion system optionally<br>
comprises a metabolisable oil. The meaning of the term imetabolisable oil is well known in<br>
the art. Metabolisable can be defined as "being capable of being transformed by<br>
metabolism" (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, W.B. Sanders Company, 25th<br>
edition (1974)). The oil may be any vegetable oil, fish, oil, animal or synthetic oil, which is<br>
not toxic to the recipient and is capable of being transformed by metabolism. Nuts, seeds,<br>
and grains are common sources of vegetable oils. Synthetic oils are also part of this<br>
invention and can include commercially available oils such as NEOBEE® and others.<br>
Squalene (2,6,10,15,19, 23-Hexamethyl-2,6,10,14,18,22-tetracosahexaene) is an .<br>
unsaturated oil which is found in large quantities in shark-liver oil, and in lower quantities<br>
in olive oil, wheat germ oil, rice bran oil, and yeast, and is an oil for use in this invention.<br>
Squalene is a metabolisable oil by virtue of the fact that it is an intermediate in the<br>
biosynthesis of cholesterol (Merck index, 10th Edition, entry no.8619).<br>
Tocols (e.g. vitamin E) are also often used in oil emulsions adjuvants (EP 0 382 271 B1;<br>
US5667784; WO 95/17210). Tocols used in the oil emulsions (optionally oil in water<br>
emulsions) of the invention may be formulated as described in EP 0 382 271 B1, in that<br>
the tocols may be dispersions of tocol droplets, optionally comprising an emulsifier, of<br>
optionally less than 1 micron in diameter. Alternatively, the tocols may be used in<br>
combination with another oil, to form the oil phase of an oil emulsion. Examples of oil<br>
emulsions which may be used in combination with the tocol are described herein, such as<br>
the metabolisable oils described above.<br><br>
Oil in water emulsion adjuvants per se have been suggested to be useful as adjuvant<br>
compositions (EP 0 399 843B), also combinations of oil in water emulsions and other<br>
active agents have been described as adjuvants for vaccines (WO 95/17210; WO<br>
98/56414; WO 99/12565; WO 99/11241). Other oil emulsion adjuvants have been<br>
described, such as water in oil emulsions (US 5,422,109;EP 0 480 982 B2) and water in<br>
oil In water emulsions (US 5,424,067;EP 0 480 981 B). All of which form oil emulsion<br>
systems (in particular when incorporating tocols) to form adjuvants and compositions of<br>
the present invention.<br>
In an embodiment, the oil emulsion (for instance oil in water emulsions) further comprises<br>
an emulsifier such as TWEEN 80 and/or a sterol such as cholesterol.<br>
In an embodiment, the oil emulsion (optionally oil-in-water emulsion) comprises a<br>
metabolisible, non-toxic oil, such as squalane, squalene or a tocopherol such as alpha<br>
tocopherol (and optionally both squalene and alpha tocopherol) and optionally an<br>
emulsifier (or surfactant) such as Tween 80. A sterol (e.g. cholesterol) may also be<br>
included.<br>
The method of producing oil in water emulsions is well known to the man skilled in the art.<br>
Commonly, the method comprises mixing the tocol-containing oil phase with a surfactant<br>
such as a PBS/TWEEN80™ solution, followed by homogenisation using a homogenizer, it<br>
would be clear to a man skilled in the art that a method comprising passing the mixture<br>
twice through a syringe needle would be suitable for homogenising small volumes of<br>
liquid. Equally, the emulsification process in microfluidiser (M110S Microfluidics machine,<br>
maximum of 50 passes, for a period of 2 minutes at maximum pressure input of 6 bar<br>
(output pressure of about 850 bar)) could be adapted by the man skilled in the art to<br>
produce smaller or larger volumes of emulsion. The adaptation could be achieved by<br>
routine experimentation comprising the measurement of the resultant emulsion until a<br>
preparation was achieved with oil droplets of the required diameter.<br>
In an oil in water emulsion, the oil and emulsifier should be in an aqueous carrier. The<br>
aqueous carrier may be, for example, phosphate buffered saline.<br>
The size of the oil droplets found within the stable oil in water emulsion are<br>
optionally less than 1 micron, may be in the range of substantially 30-600nm, optionally<br>
substantially around 30-500nm in diameter, and optionally substantially 150-500nm in<br>
diameter, and in particular about 150 nm in diameter as measured by photon correlation<br>
spectroscopy. In this regard, 80% of the oil droplets by number should be within the<br><br>
ranges, optionally more than 90% and optionally more than 95% of the oil droplets by<br>
number are within the defined size ranges. The amounts of the components present in the<br>
oil emulsions of the present invention are conventionally in the range of from 0.5-20% or 2<br>
to 10% oil (of the total dose volume), such as squalene; and when present, from 2 to 10%<br>
alpha tocopherol; and from 0.3 to 3% surfactant, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan<br>
monooleate. Optionally the ratio of oil (e.g. squalene): tocol (e.g. a-tocopherol) is equal or<br>
less than 1 as this provides a more stable emulsion. An emulsifier, such as Tween80 or<br>
Span 85 may also be present at a level of about 1%. In some cases it may be<br>
advantageous that the vaccines of the present invention will further contain a stabiliser.<br>
Examples of emulsion systems are described in WO 95/17210, WO 99/11241 and WO<br>
99/12565 which disclose emulsion adjuvants based on squalene, a-tocopherol, and<br>
TWEEN 80, optionally formulated with the immunostimulants QS21 and/or 3D-MPL.<br>
Thus in an embodiment of the present invention, the adjuvant of the invention may<br>
additionally comprise further immunostimulants, such as LPS or derivatives thereof,<br>
and/or saponins. Examples of further immunostimulants are described herein and in<br>
"Vaccine Design - The Subunit and Adjuvant Approach" 1995, Pharmaceutical<br>
Biotechnology, Volume 6, Eds. Powell, M.F., and Newman, M.J., Plenum Press, New<br>
York and London, ISBN 0-306-44867-X.<br>
In an embodiment, the adjuvant and immunogenic compositions according to the<br>
invention comprise a saponin (e.g. QS21) and/or an LPS derivative (e.g. 3D-MPL) in an<br>
oil emulsion described above, optionally with a sterol (e.g. cholesterol). Additionally the<br>
oil emulsion (optionally oil in water emulsion) may contain span 85 and/or lecithin and/or<br>
tricaprylin. Adjuvants comprising an oil-in-water emulsion, a sterol and a saponin are<br>
described in WO 99/12565.<br>
Typically for human administration the saponin (e.g. QS21) and/or LPS derivative<br>
(e.g. 3D-MPL) will be present in a human dose of immunogenic composition in the range<br>
of 1g - 200g, such as 10-100g, or 10g - 50g per dose. Typically the oil emulsion<br>
(optionally oil in water emulsion) will comprise from 2 to 10% metabolisible oil. Optionally<br>
it will comprise from 2 to 10% squalene, from 2 to 10% alpha tocopherol and from 0.3 to<br>
3% (optionally 0.4 - 2%) emulsifier (optionally tween 80 [polyoxyethylene sorbitan<br>
monooleate]). Where both squalene and alpha tocopherol are present, optionally the<br>
ratio of squalene: alpha tocopherol is equal to or less than 1 as this provides a more<br>
stable emulsion.   Span 85 (Sorbitan trioleate) may also be present at a level of 0.5 to 1%<br><br>
in the emulsions used in the invention. In some cases it may be advantageous that the<br>
immunogenic compositions and vaccines of the present invention will further contain a<br>
stabiliser, for example other emulsifiers/surfactants, including caprylic acid (merck index<br>
10th Edition, entry no. 1739), for example Tricaprylin.<br>
Where squalene and a saponin (optionally QS21) are included, it is of benefit to<br>
also include a sterol (optionally cholesterol) to the formulation as this allows a reduction in<br>
the total level of oil in the emulsion. This leads to a reduced cost of manufacture,<br>
improvement of the overall comfort of the vaccination, and also qualitative and<br>
quantitative improvements of the resultant immune responses, such as improved IFN-<br>
production. Accordingly, the adjuvant system of the present invention typically comprises<br>
a ratio of metabolisable oil:saponin (w/w) in the range of 200:1 to 300:1, also the present<br>
invention can be used in a "low oil" form the optional range of which is 1:1 to 200:1,<br>
optionally 20:1 to 100:1, or substantially 48:1, this vaccine retains the beneficial adjuvant<br>
properties of all of the components, with a much reduced reactogenicity profile.<br>
Accordingly, some embodiments have a ratio of squalene:QS21 (w/w) in the range of 1:1<br>
to 250:1, or 20:1 to 200:1, or 20:1 to 100:1, or substantially 48:1. Optionally a sterol (e.g.<br>
cholesterol) is also included present at a ratio of saponin:sterol as described herein.<br>
The emulsion systems of the present invention optionally have a small oil droplet<br>
size in the sub-micron range. Optionally the oil droplet sizes will be in the range 120 to<br>
750 nm, or from 120-600nm in diameter.<br>
A particularly potent adjuvant formulation (for ultimate combination with AIP04 in<br>
the immunogenic compositions of the invention) involves a saponin (e.g. QS21), an LPS<br>
derivative (e.g. 3D-MPL) and an oil emulsion (e.g. squalene and alpha tocopherol in an oil<br>
in water emulsion) as described in WO 95/17210 or in WO 99/12565 (in particular<br>
adjuvant formulation 11 in Example 2, Table 1).<br>
Examples of a TLR 2 agonist include peptidoglycan or lipoprotein. Imidazoquinolines,<br>
such as Imiquimod and Resiquimod are known TLR7 agonists. Single stranded RNA is<br>
also a known TLR agonist (TLR8 in humans and TLR7 in mice), whereas double stranded<br>
RNA and poly IC (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid - a commercial synthetic mimetic of viral<br>
RNA). are exemplary of TLR 3 agonists. 3D-MPL is an example of a TLR4 agonist whilst<br>
CPG is an example of a TLR9 agonist.<br>
The immunogenic composition may comprise an antigen and an immunostimulant<br>
adsorbed onto a metal salt.  Aluminium based vaccine formulations wherein the antigen<br><br>
and the immunostimulant 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL), are<br>
adsorbed onto the same particle are described in EP 0 576 478 B1, EP 0 689 454 B1, and<br>
EP 0 633 784 B1. In these cases then antigen is first adsorbed onto the aluminium salt<br>
followed by the adsorption of the immunostimulant 3D-MPL onto the same aluminium salt<br>
particles. Such processes first involve the suspension of 3D-MPL by sonication in a water<br>
bath until the particles reach a size of between 80 and 500 nm. The antigen is typically<br>
adsorbed onto aluminium salt for one hour at room temperature under agitation. The 3D-<br>
MPL suspension is then added to the adsorbed antigen and the formulation is incubated<br>
at room temperature for 1 hour, and then kept at 4oC until use.<br>
In another process, the immunostimulant and the antigen are on separate metal particles,<br>
as described in EP 1126876. The improved process comprises the adsorption of<br>
immunostimulant, onto a metallic salt particle, followed by the adsorption of the antigen<br>
onto another metallic salt particle, followed by the mixing of the discrete metallic particles<br>
to form a vaccine. The adjuvant for use in the present invention may be an adjuvant<br>
composition comprising an immunostimulant, adsorbed onto a metallic salt particle,<br>
characterised in that the metallic salt particle is substantially free of other antigen.<br>
Furthermore, vaccines are provided by the present invention and are characterised in that<br>
the immunostimulant is adsorbed onto particles of metallic salt which are substantially free<br>
from other antigen, and in that the particles of metallic salt which are adsorbed to the<br>
antigen are substantially free of other immunostimulant.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an adjuvant formulation comprising<br>
immunostimulant which has been adsorbed onto a particle of a metallic salt, characterised<br>
in the composition is substantially free of other antigen. Moreover, this adjuvant<br>
formulation can be an intermediate which, if such an adjuvant is used, is required for the<br>
manufacture of a vaccine. Accordingly there is provided a process for the manufacture of<br>
a vaccine comprising admixing an adjuvant composition which is one or more<br>
immunostimulants adsorbed onto a metal particle with an antigen. Optionally, the antigen<br>
has been pre-adsorbed onto a metallic salt. Said metallic salt may be identical or similar<br>
to the metallic salt which is adsorbed onto the immunostimulant. Optionally the metal salt<br>
is an aluminium salt, for example Aluminium phosphate or Aluminium hydroxide.<br>
The present invention further provides for a vaccine composition comprising<br>
immunostimulant adsorbed onto a first particle of a metallic salt, and antigen adsorbed<br>
onto a metallic salt, characterised in that first and second particles of metallic salt are<br>
separate particles.<br><br>
LPS or LOS derivatives or mutations or lipid A derivatives described herein are designed<br>
to be less toxic (e.g. 3D-MPL) than native lipopolysaccharides and are interchangeable<br>
equivalents with respect to any uses of these moieties described herein.<br>
In one embodiment the adjuvant used for the compositions of the invention comprises a<br>

(for instance QS21).<br>

The vaccine preparations containing immunogenic compositions of the present invention<br>
may be used to protect or treat a mammal susceptible to infection, by means of<br>
administering said vaccine via systemic or mucosal route. These administrations may<br>
include injection via the intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal or subcutaneous<br>
routes; or via mucosal administration to the oral/alimentary, respiratory, genitourinary<br>
tracts. Intranasal administration of vaccines for the treatment of pneumonia or otitis media<br>
is possible (as nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci can be more effectively<br>
prevented, thus attenuating infection at its earliest stage). Although the vaccine of the<br>
invention may be administered as a single dose, components thereof may also be co-<br>
administered together at the same time or at different times (for instance pneumococcal<br>
saccharide conjugates could be administered separately, at the same time or 1-2 weeks<br>
after the administration of the any bacterial protein component of the vaccine for optimal<br>
coordination of the immune responses with respect to each other). For co-administration,<br>
the optional Th1 adjuvant may be present in any or all of the different administrations. In<br>
addition to a single route of administration, 2 different routes of administration may be<br>
used. For example, saccharides or saccharide conjugates may be administered IM (or<br>
ID) and bacterial proteins may be administered IN (or ID). In addition, the vaccines of the<br>
invention may be administered IM for priming doses and IN for booster doses.<br>
The content of protein antigens in the vaccine will typically be in the range 1-100g,<br>
optionally 5-50g, most typically in the range 5 - 25g. Following an initial vaccination,<br>
subjects may receive one or several booster immunizations adequately spaced.<br>
Vaccine preparation is generally described in Vaccine Design ("The subunit and adjuvant<br>
approach" (eds Powell M.F. &amp; Newman M.J.) (1995) Plenum Press New York).<br>
Encapsulation within liposomes is described by Fullerton, US Patent 4,235,877.<br>
The vaccines or immunogenic compositions of the present invention may be stored in<br>
solution or lyophilized. In an embodiment, the solution is lyophilized in the presence of a<br>
sugar acting as an amorphous lyoprotectant, such as sucrose, trehalose, glucose,<br>
mannose, maltose or lactose.  In an embodiment, the solution is lyophilized in the<br><br>
presence of a sugar acting as an amorphous lyoprotectant, and a bulking agent providing<br>
improved cake structure such as glycine or mannitol. The presence of a crystalline bulking<br>
agent allows for shortening freeze-drying cycles, in the presence of high salt<br>
concentration. Examples of such mixtures for use in lyophilisation of the immunogenic<br>
compositions or vaccines of the invention include sucrose/glycine, trehalose/glycine,<br>
glucose/glycine, mannose/glycine, maltose/glycine, sucrose/mannitol/ trehalose/mannitol,<br>
glucose/mannitoi, mannose/mannitol and maltose/mannitol. Typically The molar ratio of<br>
the two constituents is optionally 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5 or 1:6. Immunogenic compositions<br>
of the invention optionally comprise the lyophilisation reagents described above.<br>
The above stabilising agents and mixtures of stabilising agents can further include a<br>
polymer capable of increasing the glass transition temperature (Tg1) of the formulation,<br>
such as poly(vinyl-pyrrolidone) (PVP), hydroxyethyl starch or dextran, or a polymer acting<br>
as a crystalline bulking agent such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) for example having a<br>
molecular weight between 1500 and 6000 and dextran.<br>
The immunogenic compositions of the invention are optionally lyophilized and<br>
extemporaneously reconstituted prior to use. Lyophilizing may result in a more stable<br>
composition (vaccine) and may possibly lead to higher antibody titers in the presence of<br>
3D-MPL and in the absence of an aluminum based adjuvant.<br>
In one aspect of the invention is provided a vaccine kit, comprising a vial containing an<br>
immunogenic composition of the invention, optionally in lyophilised form, and further<br>
comprising a vial containing an adjuvant as described herein. It is envisioned that in this<br>
aspect of the invention, the adjuvant will be used to reconstitute the lyophilised<br>
immunogenic composition.<br>
Although the vaccines of the present invention may be administered by any route,<br>
administration of the described vaccines into the skin (ID) forms one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Human skin comprises an outer "horny" cuticle, called the stratum<br>
comeum, which overlays the epidermis. Underneath this epidermis is a layer called the<br>
dermis, which in turn overlays the subcutaneous tissue. Researchers have shown that<br>
injection of a vaccine into the skin, and in particular the dermis, stimulates an immune<br>
response, which may also be associated with a number of additional advantages.<br><br>
Intradermal vaccination with the vaccines described herein forms -an optional feature of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The conventional technique of intradermal injection, the "mantoux procedure", comprises<br>
steps of cleaning the skin, and then stretching with one hand, and with the bevel of a<br>
narrow gauge needle (26-31 gauge) facing upwards the needle is inserted at an angle of<br>
between 10-15°. Once the bevel of the needle is inserted, the barrel of the needle is<br>
lowered and further advanced whilst providing a slight pressure to elevate it under the<br>
skin. The liquid is then injected very slowly thereby forming a bleb or bump on the skin<br>
surface, followed by slow withdrawal of the needle.<br>
More recently, devices that are specifically designed to administer liquid agents into or<br>
across the skin have been described, for example the devices described in WO 99/34850<br>
and EP 1092444, also the jet injection devices described for example in WO 01/13977;<br>
US 5.480,381, US 5,599,302, US 5,334.144, US 5,993,412, US 5,649,912. US 5,569,189,<br>
US 5,704,911. US 5,383,851, US 5,893,397, US 5,466,220, US 5,339,163, US 5,312.335,<br>
US 5,503,627, US 5,064,413, US 5,520, 639, US 4,596,556, US 4,790,824, US<br>
4,941,880, US 4,940,460, WO 97/37705 and WO 97/13537. Alternative methods of<br>
intradermal administration of the vaccine preparations may include conventional syringes<br>
and needles, or devices designed for ballistic delivery of solid vaccines (WO 99/27961), or<br>
transdermal patches (WO 97/48440; WO 98/28037); or applied to the surface of the skin<br>
(transdermal or transcutaneous delivery WO 98/20734 ; WO 98/28037).<br>
When the vaccines of the present invention are to be administered to the skin, or more<br>
specifically into the dermis, the vaccine is in a low liquid volume, particularly a volume of<br>
between about 0.05 ml and 0.2 ml.<br>
The content of antigens in the skin or intradermal vaccines of the present invention may<br>
be similar to conventional doses as found in intramuscular vaccines (see above).<br>
However, it is a feature of skin or intradermal vaccines that the formulations may be "low<br>
dose". Accordingly the protein antigens in "low dose" vaccines are optionally present in as<br>
little as 0.1 to 10g or 0.1 to 5 g per dose; and the saccharide (optionally conjugated)<br>
antigens may be present in the range of 0.01g, or between 0.01 to 0.5 g of<br>
saccharide per dose.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "intradermal delivery" means delivery of the vaccine to the region<br>
of the dermis in the skin. However, the vaccine will not necessarily be located exclusively<br>
in the dermis. The dermis is the layer in the skin located between about 1.0 and about 2.0<br>
mm from the surface in human skin, but there is a certain amount of variation between<br>
individuals and in different parts of the body. In general, it can be expected to reach the<br>
dermis by going 1.5 mm below the surface of the skin. The dermis is located between the<br>
stratum corneum and the epidermis at the surface and the subcutaneous layer below.<br>
Depending on the mode of delivery, the vaccine may ultimately be located solely or<br>
primarily within the dermis, or it may ultimately be distributed within the epidermis and the<br>
dermis.<br>
The present invention further provides an improved vaccine for the prevention or<br>
amelioration of Otitis media caused by Haemophilus influenzae by the addition of<br>
Haemophilus influenzae proteins, for example protein D in free or conjugated form. In<br>
addition, the present invention further provides an improved vaccine for the prevention or<br>
amelioration of pneumococcal infection in infants (e.g., Otitis media), by relying on the<br>
addition of one or two pneumococcal proteins as free or conjugated protein to the S.<br>
pneumoniae conjugate compositions of the invention. Said pneumococcal free proteins<br>
may be the same or different to any S. pneumoniae proteins used as carrier proteins.<br>
One or more Moraxella catarrhalis protein antigens can also be included in the<br>
combination vaccine in a free or conjugated form. Thus, the present invention is an<br>
improved method to elicit a (protective) immune response against Otitis media in infants.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention is an improved method to elicit a<br>
(protective) immune response in infants (defined as 0-2 years old in the context of the<br>
present invention) by administering a safe and effective amount of the vaccine of the<br>
invention [a paediatric vaccine]. Further embodiments of the present invention include the<br>
provision of the antigenic S. pneumoniae conjugate compositions of the invention for use<br>
in medicine and the use of the S. pneumoniae conjugates of the invention in the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for the prevention (or treatment) of pneumococcal disease.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention is an improved method to elicit a<br>
(protective) immune response in the elderly population (in the context of the present<br>
invention a patient is considered elderly if they are 50 years or over in age, typically over<br>
55 years and more generally over 60 years) by administering a safe and effective amount<br><br>
of the vaccine of the invention, optionally in conjunction with one or two S. pneumoniae<br>
proteins present as free or conjugated protein, which free S. pneumoniae proteins may be<br>
the same or different as any S. pneumoniae proteins used as carrier proteins.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a method of immunising a human host against disease<br>
caused by S. pneumoniae and optionally Haemophilus influenzae infection comprising<br>
administering to the host an immunoprotective dose of the immunogenic composition or<br>
vaccine or kit of the invention.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is an immunogenic composition of the invention for use in<br>
the treatment or prevention of disease caused by S.pneumoniae and optionally<br>
Haemophilus influenzae infection.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is use of the immunogenic composition or vaccine or kit<br>
of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of<br>
diseases caused by S. pneumoniae and optionally Haemophilus influenzae infection.<br>
The terms "comprising", "comprise" and "comprises" herein are intended by the inventors<br>

respectively, in every instance.<br>
Embodiments herein relating to "vaccine compositions" of the invention are also<br>

In order that this invention may be better understood, the following examples are set forth.<br>
These examples are for purposes of illustration only, and are not to be construed as limiting<br>
the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
Examples<br><br>
Example 1: EXPRESSION OF PROTEIN D<br>
Haemophilus influenzae protein D<br>
Genetic construction for protein D expression<br>
Starting materials<br>
The Protein D encoding ONA<br>
Protein D is highly conserved among H. influenzae of all serotypes and non-<br>
typeable strains. The vector pHIC348 containing the DNA sequence encoding the entire<br>
protein D gene has been obtained from Dr. A. Forsgren, Department of Medical<br>
Microbiology, University of Lund, Malmd General Hospital, Malmo, Sweden. The DNA<br>
sequence of protein D has been published by Janson et al. (1991) Infect. Immun. 59: 119-<br>
125.<br>
The expression vector pMG1<br>
The expression vector pMG1 is a derivative of pBR322 (Gross et al., 1985) in<br>
which bacteriophage A derived control elements for transcription and translation of foreign<br>
inserted genes were introduced (Shatzman et al., 1983). In addition, the Ampicillin<br>
resistance gene was exchanged with the Kanamydn resistance gene.<br>
The E. coli strain AR58<br>
The E. coli strain AR58 was generated by transduction of N99 with a P1 phage<br>
stock previously grown on an SA500 derivative (galE::TN10, lambdaKil" cl857 AH1). N99<br>
and SA500 are E. coli K12 strains derived from Dr. Martin Rosenberg's laboratory at the<br>
National Institute of Health.<br>
The expression vector pMG 1<br>
For the production of protein D, the DNA encoding the protein has been cloned<br>
into the expression vector pMG 1. This plasmid utilises signals from lambdaphage DNA<br>
to drive the transcription and translation of inserted foreign genes. The vector contains<br>
the promoter PL, operator OL and two utilisation sites (NutL and NutR) to relieve<br>
transcriptional polarity effects when N protein is provided (Gross et a/., 1985). Vectors<br>
containing the PL promoter, are introduced into an E. coli lysogenic host to stabilise the<br>
piasmid DNA. Lysogenic host strains contain replication-defective lambdaphage DNA<br>
integrated into the genome (Shatzman et al., 1983). The chromosomal lambdaphage<br>
DNA directs the synthesis of the cl repressor protein which binds to the OL repressor of<br><br>
the vector and prevents binding of RNA polymerase to the PL promoter and thereby<br>
transcription of the inserted gene. The cl gene of the expression strain AR58 contains a<br>
temperature sensitive mutant so that PL directed transcription can be regulated by<br>
temperature shift, i.e. an increase in culture temperature inactivates the repressor and<br>
synthesis of the foreign protein is initiated. This expression system allows controlled<br>
synthesis of foreign proteins especially of those that may be toxic to the cell (Shimataka &amp; <br>
Rosenberg, 1981).<br>
The E. coli strain AR58<br>
The AR58 lysogenic E. coli strain used for the production of the protein D carrier is<br>
a derivative of the standard NIH E. coli K12 strain N99 (F su- galK2, lacZ' thr" ). It<br>
contains a defective lysogenic lambdaphage (galE::TN10, lambdaKil" cl857 AH1). The Kil"<br>
phenotype prevents the shut off of host macromolecular synthesis. The cl857 mutation<br>
confers a temperature sensitive lesion to the cl repressor. The AH1 deletion removes the<br>
lambdaphage right operon and the hosts bio, uvr3, and chIA loci. The AR58 strain was<br>
generated by transduction of N99 with a P1 phage stock previously grown on an SA500<br>
derivative (galE::TN10, lambdaKil' cl857 AH1). The introduction of the defective lysogen<br>
into N99 was selected with tetracycline by virtue of the presence of a TN10 transposon<br>
coding for tetracyclin resistance in the adjacent galE gene.<br>
Construction of vector pMGMDPPrD<br>
The pMG 1 vector which contains the gene encoding the non-structural S1 protein<br>
of Influenzae virus (pMGNSI) was used to construct pMGMDPPrD. The protein D gene<br>
was amplified by PCR from the pHIC348 vector (Janson ef al. 1991 Infect. Immun.<br>
59:119-125) with PCR primers containing Ncol and Xbal restriction sites at the 5' and 3'<br>
ends, respectively. The Ncol/Xbal fragment was then introduced into pMGNSI between<br>
Ncol and Xbal thus creating a fusion protein containing the N-terminal 81 amino acids of<br>
the NS1 protein followed by the PD protein. This vector was labelled pMGNSI PrD.<br>
Based on the construct described above the final construct for protein D<br>
expression was generated. A BamHI/BamHI fragment was removed from pMGNSI PrD.<br>
This DNA hydrolysis removes the NS1 coding region, except for the first three N-terminal<br>
residues. Upon religation of the vector a gene encoding a fusion protein with the following<br>
N-terminal amino acid sequence has been generated:<br>
	MDP SSHSSNMANT	<br><br>
NS1	Protein D<br>
The protein D does not contain a leader peptide or the N-terminal cysteine to<br>
which lipid chains are normally attached. The protein is therefore neither excreted into the<br>
periplasm nor lipidated and remains in the cytoplasm in a soluble form.<br>
The final construct pMG-MDPPrD was introduced into the AR58 host strain by<br>
heat shock at 37 °C. Plasmid containing bacteria were selected in the presence of<br>
Kanamycin. Presence of the protein D encoding DNA insert was demonstrated by<br>
digestion of isolated plasmid DNA with selected endonucleases. The recombinant E. coli<br>
strain is referred to as ECD4.<br>
Expression of protein D is under the control of the lambda PL promoter/ OL<br>
Operator. The host strain AR58 contains a temperature-sensitive cl gene in the genome<br>
which blocks expression from lambda PL at low temperature by binding to OL. Once the<br>
temperature is elevated cl is released from OL and protein D is expressed.<br>
Small-scale preparation<br>
At the end of the fermentation the cells are concentrated and frozen.<br>
The extraction from harvested cells and the purification of protein D was<br>
performed as follows. The frozen cell culture pellet is thawed and resuspended in a cell<br>
disruption solution (Citrate buffer pH 6.0) to a final OD650 = 60. The suspension is passed<br>
twice through a high pressure homogenizer at P = 1000 bar. The cell culture homogenate<br>
is clarified by centrifugation and cell debris is removed by filtration. In the first purification<br>
step the filtered lysate is applied to a cation exchange chromatography column (SP<br>
Sepharose Fast Flow). PD binds to the gel matrix by ionic interaction and is eluted by a<br>
step increase of the ionic strength of the elution buffer.<br>
In a second purification step impurities are retained on an anionic exchange matrix<br>
(Q Sepharose Fast Flow). PD does not bind onto the gel and can be collected in the flow<br>
through.<br>
In both column chromatography steps fraction collection is monitored by OD. The<br>
flow through of the anionic exchange column chromatography containing the purified<br>
protein D is concentrated by ultrafiltration.<br>
The protein D containing ultrafiltration retentate is finally passed through a 0.2 urn<br>
membrane.<br>
Large Scale Preparation<br><br>
The extraction from harvested cells and the purification of protein D was<br>
performed as follows. The harvested broth is cooled and directly passed twice through a<br>
high pressure homogenizer at a Pressure of around 800 bars.<br>
In the first purification step the cell culture homogenate is diluted and applied to a<br>
cation exchange chromatography column (SP Sepharose Big beads). PD binds to the gel<br>
matrix by Ionic interaction and is eluted by a step increase of the ionic strength of the<br>
elution buffer and filtrated.<br>
In a second purification step impurities are retained on an anionic exchange matrix<br>
(Q Sepharose Fast Flow). PD does not bind onto the gel and can be collected in the flow<br>
through.<br>
In both column chromatography steps fraction collection is monitored by OD. The<br>
flow through of the anionic exchange column chromatography containing the purified<br>
protein D is concentrated and diafiltrated by ultrafiltration.<br>
The protein D containing ultrafiltration retentate is finally passed through a 0.2 urn<br>
membrane.<br>
Example 1b: EXPRESSION OF PhtD<br>
The PhtD protein is a member of the pneumococcal histidine-triad (Pht) protein family<br>
characterized by the presence of histidine-triads (HXXHXH motif). PhtD is a 838 aa-<br>
molecule and carries 5 histidine triads (see Medlmmune WO00/37105 SEQ ID NO: 4 for<br>
amino acid sequence and SEQ ID NO: 5 for DNA sequence). PhtD also contains a proline-<br>
rich region in the middle (amino acid position 348-380). PhtD has a 20 aa-N-terminal<br>
signal sequence with a LXXC motif.<br>
Genetic construct<br>
The gene sequence of the mature Medlmmune PhtD protein (from aa 21 to aa 838) was<br>
transferred recombinantly to E. coli using the in-house pTCMP14 vector carrying the p<br>
promoter. The E. coli host strain is AR58, which carries the cI857 thermosensitive<br>
repressor, allowing heat-induction of the promotor.<br>
Polymerase chain reaction was realized to amplify the phtD gene from a Medlmmune<br>
plasmid (carrying the phtD gene from Streptococcuspneumoniae strain Norway 4<br>
(serotype 4) - SEQ ID NO: 5 as described in WO 00/37105). Primers, specific for the phtD<br>
gene only, were used to amplify the phtD gene in two fragments. Primers carry either the<br>
Ndel and Kpnl or the Kpnl and Xbal restriction sites. These primers do not hybridize with<br>
any nucleotide from the vector but only with phtD specific gene sequences. An artificial<br>
ATG start codon was inserted using the first primer carrying the Ndel restriction site. The<br>
generated PCR products were then inserted into the pGEM-T cloning vector (Promega),<br><br>
and the DNA sequence was confirmed. Subcloning of the fragments in the TCMP14<br>
expression vector was then realized using standard techniques and the vector was<br>
transformed into AR58 E. coli.<br>
PhtD Purification<br>
PhtD purification is achieved as follows:<br>
° Growth of E.coli cells in the presence of Kanamycin: growth 30 hours at 30 °C then<br>
induction for 18 hours at 39.5 °C<br>
° Breakage of the E.coli cells from whole culture at OD +115 in presence of EDTA 5 mM<br>
and PMSF 2 mM as protease inhibitors: Rannie, 2 passages, 1000 bars.<br>
° Antigen capture and cells debris removal on expanded bed mode Streamline Q XL<br>

buffer pH 8.0.<br>
° Weak anion exchange chromatography in positive mode on Fractogel EMD DEAE at<br>
pH 8.0 (25 mM potassium phosphate) at 4°C; the column is washed with 140 mM NaCI<br>
and eluted at 200 mM NaCI while contaminants (proteins and DNA) remain adsorbed<br>
on the exchanger.<br>
° Concentration and ultrafiltration with 2 mM Na/K phosphate pH 7.15 on 50 kDa<br>
membrane.<br>
o     Sterilising filtration of the purified bulk on a Millipak-20 0.2 m filter cartridge.<br>
Example 1c: EXPRESSION OF PNEUMOLYSIN<br>
Pneumococcal pneumolysin was prepared and detoxified as described in WO2004/081515<br>
and WO2006/032499.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Preparation of conjugates<br>
It is well known in the art how to make purified pneumococcal polysaccharides.<br>
For the purposes of these examples the polysaccharides were made essentially as<br><br>
described   in   EP072513   or  by  closesly-related   methods.   Before  conjugation   the<br>
polysaccharides may be sized by microfluidisation as described below.<br>
The activation and coupling conditions are specific for each polysaccharide. These<br>
are given in Table 1. Sized polysaccharide (except for PS5, 6B and 23F) was dissolved in<br>
NaCI 2M, NaCI 0.2M or in water for injection (WFI). The optimal polysaccharide<br>
concentration was evaluated for all the serotypes. All serotypes except serotype 18C<br>
were conjugated directly to the carrier protein as detailed below. Two alternative serotype<br>
22F conjugates were made; one conjugated directly, one through an ADH linker.<br>
From a 100 mg/ml stock solution in acetonitrile or acetonitrile/water 50%/50%<br>
solution, CDAP (CDAP/PS ratio 0.5-1.5 mg/mg PS) was added to the polysaccharide<br>
solution. 1.5 minute later, 0.2M-0.3M NaOH was added to obtain the specific activation<br>
pH. The activation of the polysaccharide was performed at this pH during 3 minutes at 25<br>
oC. Purified protein (protein D, PhtD, pneumolysin or DT) (the quantity depends on the<br>
initial PS/carrier protein ratio) was added to the activated polysaccharide and the coupling<br>
reaction was performed at the specific pH for up to 2 hour (depending upon serotype)<br>
under pH regulation. In order to quench un-reacted cyanate ester groups, a 2M glycine<br>
solution was then added to the mixture. The pH was adjusted to the quenching pH (pH<br>
9.0). The solution was stirred for 30 minutes at 25 °C and then overnight at 2-8 oC with<br>
continuous slow stirring.<br>
Preparation of 18C:<br>
18C was linked to the carrier protein via a linker - Adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH)<br>
Polysaccharide serotype 18C was microfluidized before conjugation.<br>
Derivatization of tetanus toxoid with EDAC<br>
For derivatization of the tetanus toxoid, purified TT was diluted at 25 mg/ml in 0.2M NaCI<br>
and the ADH spacer was added in order to reach a final concentration of 0.2M. When the<br>
dissolution of the spacer was complete, the pH was adjusted to 6.2. EDAC (1-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide) was then added to reach a final concentration of<br>
0.02M and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour under pH regulation. The reaction of<br>
condensation was stopped by increasing pH up to 9.0 for at least 30 minutes at 25°C.<br>
Derivatized TT was then diafiltrated (10 kDa CO membrane) in order to remove residual<br>
ADH and EDAC reagent.<br>
TTAH bulk was finally sterile filtered until coupling step and stored at -70°C.<br>
Chemical coupling of TTAH to PS 18C<br>
Details of the conjugation parameters can be found in Table 1.<br><br>
2 grams of microfluidized PS were diluted at the defined concentration in water and<br>
adjusted to 2M NaCI by NaCI powder addition.<br>
CDAP solution (100 mg/ml freshly prepared in 50/50 v/v acetonitrile/WFI) was added to<br>
reach the appropriate CDAP/PS ratio.<br>
The pH was raised up to the activation pH 9.0 by the addition of 0.3M NaOH and was<br>
stabilised at this pH until addition of TTAH-<br>
After 3 minutes, derivatized TTAH (20 mg/ml in 0.2 M NaCI) was added to reach a ratio<br>
TTAH /PS of 2; the pH was regulated to the coupling pH 9.0. The solution was left one hour<br>
under pH regulation.<br>
For quenching, a 2IVI glycine solution, was added to the mixture PS/TTAH/CDAP.<br>
The pH was adjusted to the quenching pH (pH 9.0).<br>
The solution was stirred for 30 min at 25 °C, and then left overnight at 2-8°C with<br>
continuous slow stirring.<br>
PS22FAn-PhtD conjugate<br>
In a second conjugation method for this saccharide (the first being the direct<br>
PS22-PhtD conjugation method shown in Table 1), 22F was linked to the carrier protein<br>
via a linker - Adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH). Polysaccharide serotype 22F was<br>
microfluidized before conjugation.<br>
PS 22F derivatization<br>
Activation and coupling are performed at 25°C under continuous stirring in a temperature-<br>
controlled waterbath.<br>
Microfluidized PS22F was diluted to obtain a final PS concentration of 6 mg/ml in 0.2M<br>
NaCI and the solution was adjusted at pH 6.05 ± 0.2 with 0.1 N HCI.<br>
CDAP solution (100 mg/ml freshly prepared in acetonitrile/WFI, 50/50) was added to<br>
reach the appropriate CDAP/PS ratio (1.5/1 ww).<br>
The pH was raised up to the activation pH 9.00 ±0.05 by the addition of 0.5M NaOH and<br>
was stabilised at this pH until addition of ADH.<br>
After 3 minutes, ADH was added to reach the appropriate ADH/PS ratio (8.9/1 w/w); the<br>
pH was regulated to coupling pH 9.0. The solution was left for 1 hour under pH<br>
regulation.<br>
The PSAH derivative was concentrated and diafiltrated.<br>
Coupling<br><br>
PhtD at 10 mg/ml in 0.2M NaCI was added to the PS22FAH derivative in order to reach a<br>
PhtD/PS22FAn ratio of 4/1 (w/w). The pH was adjusted to 5.0 ± 0.05 with HCI. The EDAC<br>
solution (20 mg/ml in 0.1 M Tris-HCI pH 7.5} was added manually in 10 min (250 m min)<br>
to reach 1 mg EDAC/mg PS22FAH. The resulting solution was incubated for 150 min<br>
(though 60 mins was also used) at 25oC under stirring and pH regulation. The solution<br>
was neutralized by addition of 1M Tris-HCI pH 7.5 (1/10 of the final volume) and let 30 min<br>
at 25°C.<br>
Prior to the elution on Sephacryl S400HR, the conjugate was clarified using a Sum<br>
Minisart filter.<br>
The resulting conjugate has a final PhtD/PS ratio of 4.1 (w/w), a free PS content below<br>
1% and an antigenicity (-PS/ct-PS) of 36.3% and anti-PhtD antigenicity of 7.4%.<br>
Purification of the conjugates:<br>
The conjugates were purified by gel filtration using a Sephacryl S400HR gel filtration<br>
column equilibrated with 0.15M NaCI (S500HR for 18C) to remove small molecules<br>
(including DMAP) and unconjugated PS and protein. Based on the different molecular<br>
sizes of the reaction components, PS-PD, PS-TT, PS-PhtD, PS-pneumolysin or PS-DT<br>
conjugates are eluted first, followed by free PS, then by free PD or free DT and finally<br>
DMAP and other salts (NaCI, glycine).<br>
Fractions containing conjugates are detected by UV2BO nm- Fractions are pooled according<br>
to their Kd, sterile filtered (0.22m) and stored at +2-8°C. The PS/Protein ratios in the<br>
conjugate preparations were determined.<br>
Specific activation/coupling/quenching conditions of PS S. pneumoniae-Proteln<br>
D/TT/DT/PhtD/Plvconiuqates<br>
Where "fluid" appears in a row header, it indicates that the saccharide was sized by<br>
microfluidisation before conjugation. Sizes of saccharides following microfluidisation are<br>
given in table 2.<br><br><br><br><br>
Each conjugate was characterised and met the specifications described in Table<br>
2. The polysaccharide content (ug/ml) was measured by the Resorcinol test and the<br>
protein content (ug/ml) by the Lowry test. The final PS/PD ratio (w/w) is determined by the<br>
ratio of the concentrations.<br>
Free polysaccharide content (%):<br>
The free polysaccharide content of conjugates kept at 4°C or stored 7 days at<br>
37°C was determined on the supernatant obtained after incubation with -carrier protein<br>
antibodies and saturated ammonium sulfate, followed by a centrifugation.<br>
An -PS/-PS ELISA was used for the quantification of free polysaccharide in the<br>
supernatant. The absence of conjugate was also controlled by an -carrier protein/a-PS<br>
ELISA.<br>
Antigenicity:<br>
The antigenicity on the same conjugates was analyzed in a sandwich-type ELISA<br>
wherein the capture and the detection of antibodies were -PS and -Protein<br>
respectively.<br>
Free protein content (%):<br>
Unconjugated carrier protein can be separated from the conjugate during the •<br>
purification step. The content of free residual protein was determined using size exclusion<br>
chromatography (TSK 5000-PWXL) followed by UV detection (214 nm). The elution<br>
conditions allowed separating the free carrier protein and the conjugate. Free protein<br>
content in conjugate bulks was then determined versus a calibration curve (from 0 to 50<br>
g/ml of carrier protein). Free carrier protein in % was obtained as follows: % free carrier<br>
= (free carrier (g/ml)/ (Total concentration of corresponding carrier protein measured by<br>
Lowry (g/ml)* 100%).<br>
Stability:<br>
Molecular weight distribution (Kav) and stability was measured on a HPLC-SEC gel<br>
filtration (TSK 5000-PWXL) for conjugates kept at 4°C and stored for 7 days at 37°C.<br>
The 10/11/13/14-valent characterization is given in Table 2 (see comment<br>
thereunder).<br><br>
The protein conjugates can be adsorbed onto aluminium phosphate and pooled to form<br>
the final vaccine.<br>
Conclusion:<br>
Immunogenic conjugates have been produced, that have since been shown to be<br>
components of a promising vaccine.<br><br>
A 10 valent vaccine was made by mixing serotype 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and<br>
23F conjugates (e.g. at a dose of 1, 3, 1,1,1, 1,1, 3, 3, 1 g of saccharide, respectively<br>
per human dose). An 11 valent vaccine was made by further adding the serotype 3<br>
conjugate from Table 5 (e.g. at 1 g of saccharide per human dose). A 13 valent vaccine<br>
was made by further adding the serotypes 19A and 22F conjugates above (with 22F<br>
either directly linked to PhtD, or alternatively through an ADH linker) [e.g. at a dose of 3<br>
g each of saccharide per human dose]. A 14 valent vaccine may be made by further<br><br>
adding the serotype 6A conjugate above [e.g. at a dose of 1 g of saccharide per human<br>
dose.<br>
Example 3: Evidence that inclusion of Haemphilus influenzae protein D in an<br>
immunogenic composition of the invention can provide improved protection<br>
against acute otitis media (AOM).<br>
Study design.<br>
The study used an 11Pn-PD vaccine - comprising serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14,<br>
18C, 19F and 23F each conjugated to protein D from H. influenzae (refer to Table 5 in<br>
Example 4). Subjects were randomized into two groups to receive four doses of either the<br>
11Pn-PD vaccine or Havrix at approximately 3, 4, 5 and 12-15 months of age. All subjects<br>
received GSK Bioiogicals" Infanrix- hexa (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib) vaccine concomitantly at 3,<br>
4 and 5 months of age. Infanrix- hexa is a combination of Pediarix and Hib mixed before<br>
administration. Efficacy follow-up for the "According-to-Protocol" analysis started 2 weeks<br>
after administration of the third vaccine dose and continued until 24-27 months of age.<br>
Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was evaluated in a<br>
selected subset of subjects.<br>
Parents were advised to consult the investigator if their child was sick, had ear pain,<br>
spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane or spontaneous ear discharge. If the<br>
investigator suspected an episode of AOM, the child was immediately referred to an Ear,<br>
Nose and Throat (ENT) specialist for confirmation of the diagnosis.<br>
A clinical diagnosis of AOM was based on either the visual appearance of the tympanic<br>
membrane (i.e. redness, bulging, loss of light reflex) or the presence of middle ear fluid<br>
effusion (as demonstrated by simple or pneumatic otoscopy or by microscopy). In<br>
addition, at least two of the following signs or symptoms had to be present: ear pain, ear<br>
discharge, hearing loss, fever, lethargy, irritability, anorexia, vomiting, or diarrhea. If the<br>
ENT specialist confirmed the clinical diagnosis, a specimen of middle ear fluid was<br>
collected by tympanocentesis for bacteriological testing.<br>
For subjects with repeated sick visits, a new AOM episode was considered to have<br>
started if more than 30 days had elapsed since the beginning of the previous episode. In<br>
addition, an AOM episode was considered to be a new bacterial episode if the isolated<br>
bacterium/serotype differed from the previous isolate whatever the interval between the<br>
two consecutive episodes.<br><br>
Trial results<br>
A total of 4968 infants were enrolled, 2489 in the 11 Pn-PD group and 2479 in the control<br>
group. There were no major differences in the demographic characteristics or risk factors<br>
between the two groups.<br>
Clinical episodes and AOM case definition<br>
During the per protocol follow-up period, a total of 333 episodes of clinical AOM were<br>
recorded in the 11Pn-PD group and 499 in the control group.<br>
Table 3 presents the protective efficacy of the 11 Pn-PD vaccine and both 7-valent<br>
vaccines previously tested in Finland (Eskola et al N Engl J Med 2001; 344: 403 - 409<br>
and Kilpi et a/Clin Infect Dis 2003 37:1155-64) against any episode of AOM and AOM<br>
caused by different pneumococca! serotypes, H. influenzae, NTHi and M. catanfiaiis.<br>
Statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction by 33.6% of the overall AOM<br>
disease burden was achieved with 11 Pn-PD, irrespective of the etiology (table 3).<br>
The overall efficacy against AOM episodes due to any of the 11 pneumococcal serotypes<br>
contained in the 11 Pn-PD vaccine was 57.6% (table 3).<br>
Another important finding in the current study is the 35.6% protection provided by the<br>
11 Pn-PD vaccine against AOM caused by H. influenzae (and specifically 35.3%<br>
protection provided by NTHi). This finding is of major clinical significance, given the<br>
increased importance of H. influenzae as a major cause of AOM in the pneumococcal<br>
conjugate vaccine era. In line with the protection provided against AOM, the 11Pn-PD<br>
vaccine also reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of H. influenzae following the booster dose<br>
in the second year of life. These findings are in contrast with previous observations in<br>
Finland where, for both 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, an increase in AOM<br>
episodes due to H. influenzae was observed, (Eskola et aland Kilpi et al) as evidence of<br>
etiological replacement.<br>
A clear correlation between protection against AOM episodes due to Hi and antibody<br>
levels against the carrier Protein D could not be established, as post-primary anti-PD IgG<br>
antibody concentrations in 11 Pn-PD vaccinees, that remained Hi AOM episode-free, were<br>
essentially the same as post-primary anti-PD IgG antibody levels measured in 11Pn-PD<br>
vaccinees that developed at least one Hi AOM episode during the efficacy follow-up<br>
period. However, although no correlation could be established between the biological<br>
impact of the vaccine and the post-primary IgG anti-PD immunogenicity, it is reasonable<br><br>
to assume that the PD carrier protein, which is highly conserved among H. inffuenzae<br>
strains, has contributed to a large extent in the induction of the protection against Hi.<br>
The effect on AOM disease was accompanied by an effect on nasopharyngeal carriage<br>
that was of similar magnitude for vaccine serotype pneumococci and H. influenzae (Figure<br>
1). This reduction of the nasopharyngeal carriage of H. influenzae in the PD-conjugate<br>
vaccinees supports the hypothesis of a direct protective effect of the PD-conjugate<br>
vaccine against H. influenzae, even if the protective efficacy could not be correlated to the<br>
anti-PD IgG immune responses as measured by ELISA.<br>
In a following experiment a chinchilla ctitis media model was used with serum pools from<br>
infants immunised with the 11 valent formulation of this example or with the 10 valent<br>
vaccine of Example 2 (see also Table 1 and 2 and comments thereunder). Both pools<br>
induce a significant reduction of the percentage of animals with otitis media versus the<br>
pre-immune serum pool. There is no significant difference beteen the 10 and 11 valent<br>
immune pools. This demonstrates that both vaccines have a similar potential to induce<br>
protection against otitis media caused by non typeable H. influenzae in this model.<br><br><br><br>
Example 4:<br>
Selection of carrier protein for serotype 19F<br>
ELISA assay used<br>
The 22F inhibition ELISA method was essentially based on an assay proposed in<br>
2001 by Concepcion and Frasch and was reported by Henckaerts et al., 2006, Clinical<br>
and Vaccine Immunology 13:356-360. Briefly, purified pneumococcal polysaccharides<br>
were mixed with methylated human serum albumin and adsorbed onto Nunc Maxisorp™<br>
(Roskilde, DK) high binding microtitre plates overnight sit 4°C. The plates were blocked<br>
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature with agitation.<br>
Serum samples were diluted in PBS containing 10% FBS, 10 ug/mL cell-wall<br>
polysaccharide (SSI) and 2 g/mL of pneumococcal polysaccharide of serotype 22F<br>
(ATCC), and further diluted on the microtitre plates with the same buffer. An internal<br>
reference calibrated against the standard serum 89-SF using the serotype-specific IgG<br>
concentrations in 89-SF was treated in the same way and included on every plate. After<br>
washing, the bound antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-human<br>
IgG monoclonal antibody (Stratech Scientific Ltd., Soham, UK) diluted in 10% FBS (in<br>
PBS), and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with agitation. The color was<br>
developed using ready-to-use single component tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase enzyme<br>
immunoassay substrate kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA, US) in the dark at room temperature.<br>
The reaction was stopped with H2SO4 0.18 M, and the optical density was read at 450<br>
nm. Serotype-specific IgG concentrations (in g/mL) in the samples were calculated by<br>
referencing optical density points within defined limits to the internal reference serum<br>
curve, which was modelized by a 4-parameter logistic log equation calculated with<br>
SoftMax Pro™ (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) software. The cut-off for the ELISA<br>
was 0.05 g/mL IgG for all serotypes taking into account the limit of detection and the limit<br>
of quantification.<br>
Opsonophagocytosis assay<br>
At the WHO consultation meeting in June 2003, it was recommended to use an OPA<br>
assay as set out in Romero-Steiner et al Clin Diagn Lab Immunol 2003 10 (6): pp1019-<br>
1024. This protocol was used to test the OPA activity of the serotypes in the following<br>
tests.<br>
Preparation of conjugates<br><br>
In studies 11Pn-PD&amp;Di-001 and 11Pn-PD&amp;Di-007, three 11-valent vaccine formulations<br>
(Table 4) were included in which 3g of the 19F polysaccharide was conjugated to<br>
diphtheria toxoid (19F-DT) instead of 1|jg polysaccharide conjugated to protein D (19F-<br>
PD). Conjugation parameters for the studies 11Pn-PD, 11 Pn-PD&amp;Di-001 and 11 Pn-<br>
PD&amp;Di-007 are disclosed in Tables 5, 6 and 7 respectively.<br>
Anti-pneumococcal antibody responses and OPA activity against serotype 19F one<br>
month following primary vaccination with these 19F-DT formulations are shown in<br>
Table 8 and 9 respectively.  10 shows 22F-ELISA<br>
antibody concentrations and percentages of subjects reaching the 0.2 ug/mL threshold<br>
before and after 23-va!ent plain polysaccharide booster vaccination.<br>
The opsonophagocytic activity was shown to be clearly improved for antibodies induced<br>
with these 19F-DT formulations as demonstrated by higher seropositivity rates<br>
(opsonophagocytic titers &gt; 1:8) and OPA GMTs one month following primary vaccination<br>
(Table 9). One month after 23-valent plain polysaccharide booster vaccination,<br>
opsonophagocytic activity of 19F antibodies remained significantly better for children<br>
primed with 19F-DT formulations (Error! Reference source not found. 11).<br>
Error! Reference source not found. 12 presents immunogenicity data following a 11Pn-<br>
PD booster dose in toddlers previously primed with 19F-DT or 19F-PD conjugates<br>
compared to a 4th consecutive dose of Prevnar®. Given the breakthrough cases reported<br>
after the introduction of Prevnar® in the US, the improved opsonophagocytic activity<br>
against serotype 19F when conjugated to the DT carrier protein may be an advantage for<br>
the candidate vaccine.<br>
Error! Reference source not found. 13 provides ELISA and OPA data for the 19F-DT<br>
conjugate with respect to the cross-reactive serotype 19A. It was found that 19F-DT<br>
induces low but significant OPA activity against 19A.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 5: Adjuvant experiments in preclinical models: impact on the<br>
Immunogenicty of pneumococcal 11-valent polysaccharide conjugates in<br>
elderly Rhesus monkeys<br>
To optimize the response elicited to conjugate pneumococcal vaccines in the elderly<br>
population, GSK formulated an 11-valent polysaccharide (PS) conjugate vaccine with a<br>
novel adjuvant Adjuvant C - see below.<br>
Groups of 5 elderly Rhesus monkeys (14 to 28 years-old) were immunized<br>
intramuscularly (IM) at days 0 and 28 with 500 l of either' 11-valent PS' conjugates<br>
adsorbed onto 315 g of AIPO4 or 11-valent PS conjugatess admixed with Adjuvant C.<br>
In both vaccine formulations, the 11-valent PS conjugates were each composed of the<br>
following conjugates PS1-PD, PS3-PD, PS4-PD, PS5-PD, PS7F-PD, PS9V-PD, PS14-<br>
PD, PS18C-PD, PS19F-PD, PS23F-DT and PS6B-DT. The vaccine used was 1/5 dose of<br>
of the human dose of the vaccine (5 g of each saccharide per human dose except for 6B<br>
[10 g]) conjugated according to Table 6 conditions (Example 4), except 19F was made<br>
according to the following CDAP process conditions: sized saccharide at 9 mg/ml, PD at 5<br>
mg/ml, an initial PD/PS ratio of 1.2/1, a CDAP concentration of 0.75 mg/mg PS,<br>
pHa=pHc=pHq 9.0/9.0/9.0 and a coupling time of 60 min.<br>
Anti-PS ELISA IgG levels and opsono-phagocytosis titres were dosed in sera collected at<br>
day 42. Anti-PS3 memory B cell frequencies were measured by Elispot from peripheral<br>
blood cells collected at day 42.<br>
According to the results shown here below, Adjuvant C significantly improved the<br>
immunogenicity of 11-valent PS conjugates versus conjugates with AIPO4 in elderly<br>
monkeys. The novel adjuvant enhanced the IgG responses to PS (Figure 1) and the<br>
opsono-phagocytosis antibody titres (Table 14). There was also supportive evidence that<br>
the frequency of PS3-specific memory B cells is increeised by the use of Adjuvant C<br>
(Figure 2).<br><br><br>
B Cell Elispot<br>
The principle of the assay relies pn the fact that memory B cells mature into plasma cells<br>
in vitro following cultivation with CpG for 5 days. In vitro generated antigen-specific<br>
plasma cells can be easily detected and therefore be enumerated using the B-cell elispot<br>
assay. The number of specific plasma cells mirrors the frequency of memory B cells at the<br>
onset of the culture.<br>
Briefly, in vitro generated plasma cells are incubated in culture plates coated with antigen.<br>
Antigen-specific plasma cells form antibody/antigen spots, which are detected by<br>
conventional immuno-enzymatic procedure and enumerated as memory B cells.<br>
In the present study, Polysaccharides have been used to coat culture plates in order to<br>
enumerate respective memory B cells. Results are expressed as a frequency of PS specific<br>
memory B cells within a million of memory B cells.<br>
The study shows that Adjuvant C may be able to alleviate the known problem of PS3<br>
boostability (see 5th International Symposium on Pneumococci and Pneumococcal<br>
Diseases, April 2-6 2006, Alice Springs, Central Australia.<br>

levels (figure 5) and opsono-phagocytic titres (figure 6).<br>
Example 13. impact of new adjuvants on immurioqenicitv of Streptoccoccus<br>
pneumoniae capsule PS conjugates<br>
Groups of 40 female Balb/c mice were immunised by the IM route at days 0, 14 and 28<br>
with 13-valent PS formulations containing PS 1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F,<br>
22F and 23F (dose: 0.3 g / conjugate for PS 4, 18C, 19A, 19F and 22F and 0.1 ug /<br>
conjugate for the other PS).<br>
PS 18C was conjugated to Tetanus Toxoid, 19F to Diphteria Toxoid, 19A to formol-<br>
detoxified Ply, 22F to PhtD and the other PS to PD. See Example 2, Table 1 and<br>
comment under Table 2 for characteristics of 13 valent vaccine made with 22F directly<br>
conjugated.<br>
Four formulations, supplemented with either AIPO4, adjuvant A1, adjuvant A4 or adjuvant<br>
A5, were compared.<br>
Anti-PS, Ply, PhtD and PD ELISA IgG levels were measured in sera collected at day 42<br>
and pooled per group. The following ratio was calculated for each antigen: IgG level<br>
induced with the new adjuvant tested / IgG level induced with AiPO4.<br>
All the new adjuvants tested improved at least 2-fold the immune responses to 13-valent<br>
conjugates compared to the classical AIPO4 formulation (figure 7).<br>
Example 14. protective efficacy of a PhtD/detoxified Ply combo in a pneumococcal<br>
monkey pneumonia model<br>
Groups of 6 Rhesus monkeys (3 to 8 years-old), selected as those having the lowest preexisting<br>
anti-19F antibody levels, were immunized intramuscularly at days 0 and 28 with<br>
either 11-valent PS conjugates (i.e. 1 ug of PS 1, 3, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14 and 23F, and 3 ug<br>
of PS 4, 18C and 19F [of saccharide]) or PhtD (10 g) + formol-detoxified Ply (10 g) or<br>
the adjuvant alone.<br><br>
PS 18C was conjugated to Tetanus Toxoid, 19F to Diphteria Toxoid and the other PS to<br>
PD. See Example 2, Table 1 and comment under Table 2 for characteristics of 11 valent<br>
vaccine. All formulations were supplemented with adjuvant C.<br>
Type 19F pneumococci (5.108 cfu) were inoculated in the right lung at day 42. Colonies<br>
were counted in broncho-alveolar lavages collected at days 1, 3 and 7 post-challenge.<br>
The results were expressed as the number of animals per group either dead, lung<br>
colonized or cleared at day 7 after challenge.<br>
As shown in figure 8, a good protection close to statistical significance (despite the low<br>
number of animals used) was obtained with 11-valent conjugates and the PhtD+dPly<br>
combo (p 
Example 15. impact of conjugation chemistry on the anti-PhtD antibody response<br>
and the protective efficacy against a type 4 challenge induced by 22F-PhtD<br>
conjugates<br>
Groups of 20 female OF1 mice were immunised by the intramuscular route at days 0 and<br>
14 with 3 ug of either 22F-PhtD (prepared by direct CDAP chemistry) or 22F-AH-PhtD<br>
(ADH-derivitized PS), or the adjuvant alone. Both monovalent 22F conjugates were made<br>
by the processes of Example 2 (see also Table 1 and Table 2). Each formulation was<br>
supplemented with adjuvant C.<br>
Anti-PhtD ELISA IgG levels were measured in sera collected at day 27.<br>
Mice were challenged intranasally with 5.106 cfu of type 4 pneumococci at day 28 (i.e. a<br>
pneumococcal serotype not potentially covered by the PS present in the vaccine<br>
formulation tested). The mortality induced was monitored until day 8 post-challenge.<br>
22F-AH-PhtD induced a significantly higher anti-PhtD IgG response and better protection<br>
against type 4 challenge than 22F-PhtD.<br><br>
