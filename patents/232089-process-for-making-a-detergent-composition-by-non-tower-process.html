				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a non-tower process for producing a particulate detergent composition. More particularly, the invention is directed to a continuous process during which detergent agglomerates are produced by feeding a surfactant and coating materials into a series of mixers. The process produces a free flowing, detergent composition whose density can be adjusted for wide range of consumer needs, and which can be commercially sold.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recently, there has been considerable interest within the detergent industry for laundry detergents which are "compact" and therefore, have tow dosage volumes. To facilitate production of these so-called low dosage detergents, many attempts have been made to produce high bulk density detergents, for example with a density of 600 g/l or higher. The low dosage detergents are currently in high demand as they conserve resources and can be sold in small packages which are more convenient for consumers. However, the extent to which modern detergent products need to be "compact" in nature remains unsettled. In fact, many consumers, especially in developing countries, continue to prefer a higher dosage levels in their respective laundering operations.<br>
Generally, there are two primary types of processes by which detergent granules or powders can be prepared. The first type of process involves spray-drying an aqueous detergent slurry in a spray-drying tower to produce highly porous detergent granules (e.g., tower process for low density detergent compositions). In the second type of process, the various detergent components are dry mixed after which they are agglomerated with a binder such as a nonionic or anionic surfactant, to produce high density detergent compositions<br><br>
(e.g., agglomeration process for high density detergent compositions). In the above two processes, the important factors which govern the density of the resulting detergent granules are the shape, porosity and particle size distribution of said granules, the density of the various starting materials, the shape of the various starting materials, and their respective chemical composition.<br>
There have been many attempts in the art for providing processes which increase the density of detergent granules or powders. Particular attention has been given to densification of spray-dried granules by post tower treatment. For example, one attempt involves a batch process in which spray-dried or granulated detergent powders containing sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium sulfate are densified and spheronized in a Marumerizer®. This apparatus comprises a substantially horizontal, roughened, rotatable table positioned within and at the base of a substantially vertical, smooth walled cylinder. This process, however, is essentially a batch process and is therefore less suitable for the large scale production of detergent powders. More recently, other attempts have been made to provide continuous processes for increasing the density of "post-tower" or spray dried detergent granules. Typically, such processes require a first apparatus which pulverizes or grinds the granules and a second apparatus which increases the density of the pulverized granules by agglomeration. While these processes achieve the desired increase in density by treating or densirying "post tower" or spray dried granules, they are limited in their ability to go higher in surfactant active level without subsequent coating step. In addition, treating or densifying by "post tower" is not favourable in terms of economics (high capital cost) and complexity of operation. Moreover, all of the aforementioned processes are directed primarily for densifying or otherwise processing spray dried granules. Currently, the relative amounts and types of materials subjected to spray drying processes in the production of detergent granules has been limited. For example, it has been difficult to attain high levels of surfactant in the resulting detergent composition, a feature which facilitates production of detergents in a more efficient manner. Thus, it would be desirable to have a process by which detergent compositions can be produced without having the limitations imposed by conventional spray drying techniques.<br>
To that end, the art is also replete with disclosures of processes which entail agglomerating detergent compositions. For example, attempts have been made to agglomerate detergent builders by mixing zeolite and/or layered<br><br>
silicates in a mixer to form free flowing agglomerates. While such attempts suggest that their process can be used to produce detergent agglomerates, they do not provide a mechanism by which starting detergent materials in the form of pastes, liquids and dry materials can be effectively agglomerated into crisp, free flowing detergent agglomerates.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art to have an agglomeration (non-tower) process for continuously producing a detergent composition having high density delivered directly from starting detergent ingredients, and preferably the density can be achieved by adjusting the process condition. Also, there remains a need for such a process which is more efficient, flexible and economical to facilitate large-scale production of detergents (1) for flexibility in the ultimate density of the final composition, and (2) for flexibility in terms of incorporating several different kinds of detergent ingredients, especially detergent ingredients in the form of liquid, into the process.<br>
The following references are directed to densifying spray-dried granules: Appel et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,133,924 (Lever); Bortolotti et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,160,657 (Lever); Johnson et al, British patent No. 1,517,713 (Unilever); and Curtis, European Patent Application 451,894.<br>
The following references are directed to producing detergents by agglomeration: Beujean et al, Laid-open No.WO93/23,523 (Henkel), Lutz et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,992,079 (FMC Corporation); Porasik et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,427,417 (Korex); Beerse et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,108,646 (Procter &amp; Gamble); Capeci et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,366,652 (Procter &amp; Gamble); Hollingsworth et al, European Patent Application 351,937 (Unilever); Swatling et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,205,958; Dhalewadikar et al, Laid Open No.W096/04359 (Unilever).<br>
For example, the Laid-open No.W093/23,523 (Henkel) describes the process comprising pre-agglomeration by a low speed mixer and further agglomeration step by high speed mixer for obtaining high density detergent composition with less than 25 wt% of the granules having a diameter over 2 mm. The U.S. Patent No. 4,427,417 (Korex) describes continuous process for agglomeration which reduces caking and oversized agglomerates.<br>
None of the existing art provides all of the advantages and benefits of the present invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention is directed to a process which produces free<br>
flowing, granular detergent agglomerates having a density of at least about 600<br>
g/l.   The process produces granular detergent agglomerates from an aqueous<br>
and/or non-aqueous surfactant which is then coated with fine powder having a<br>
diameter from 0.1 to 500 microns, in order to obtain low density granules.<br>
,'<br>
Process First Step [Step(a)]<br>
In the first step of the process, one or more of aqueous and/or non-aqueous surfactant(s) which is/are in the form of powder, paste and/or liquid, and fine powder having a diameter from 0.1 to 500 microns, preferably from about 1 to about 100 microns are fed into a first mixer, so as to make agglomerates. During the process, surface of the surfactant which is coated by the fine powder is wet by finely atomized liquid so as to add more fine powder on the surface of the agglomerates. (The definition of the surfactants and the fine powder, finely atomized liquid are described in detail hereinafter.) Optionally, an internal recycle stream of powder having a diameter of about 0.1 to about 300 microns generated in the fluidizing apparatus (e.g., fluid bed dryer and/or fluid bed cooler) can be fed into the mixer in addition to the fine powder. The amount of such internal recycle stream of powder can be 0 to about 60 wt% of final product.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the surfactant for the first step can be initially fed into a mixer or pre-mixer (e.g. a conventional screw extruder or other similar mixer) prior to the above, after which the mixed detergent materials are fed into the first step mixer as described herein for agglomeration.<br>
Generally speaking, preferably, the mean residence time of the first mixer is in range from about 0.2 to about 5 seconds and tip speed of the first mixer of the first mixer is in range from about/10 m/s to about 30 m/s, the energy per unit mass of the first mixer (energy condition) of the first mixer is in range from about 0.15 kj/kg to about 5 kj/kg, more preferably, the mean residence time of the first mixer is in range from about 0.2 to about 5 seconds and tip speed of the first mixer is in range from about 10 m/s to about 30 m/s, the energy per unit mass of<br><br>
the first mixer (energy condition) is in range from about 0.15 kj/kg to about 5 kj/kg, the most preferably, the mean residence time of the first mixer is in range from about 0.2 to about 5 seconds, tip speed of the first mixer is in~ range from about 15 m/s to about 26 m/s, the energy per unit mass of the first mixer (energy condition) is from about 0.2 kj/kg to. about 3 kj/kg.<br>
The examples of the mixer can be any types of mixer known to the skilled in the art, as long as the mixer can maintain the above mentioned condition for the first step, An Example can be Flexomic Mode! manufactured by the Schugi company (Netherlands). As the result of the first step, first agglomerates are then obtained. Second Step [Step (b)1<br>
The resultant from the first step (i.e., the first agglomerates) is fed into a second mixer. Namely, the first agglomerates are mixed and sheared thoroughly for rounding and growth of the agglomerates in the second mixer . Optionally, about 0-10% , more preferably about 2-5% of powder detergent ingredients of the kind used in the first step and/or other detergent ingredients can be added to the second step. Preferably, choppers which are attachable for the third mixer can be used to break up undesirable oversized agglomerates. Therefore, the process including the second with choppers is useful in order to obtain reduced amount of oversized agglomerates as final products, and such process is one preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Generally speaking, preferably, the mean residence time of the second mixer is in range from about 0.5 to about 15 minutes and the energy per unit mass of the second mixer (energy condition) is in range from about 0.15 to about 7 kj/kg, more preferably, the mean residence time of the second mixer is from about 3 to about 6 minutes and the energy per unit mass of the second mixer (energy condition) is in range from about 0.15 to about 4kj/kg.<br>
The . examples of the second can be any types of mixer known to the skilled in the art, as long as the mixer can maintain the above mentioned condition for the second step. An Example can be Lodige KM Mixer manufactured by the Lodige company (Germany). As the result of the second step, the second agglomerates with round shape are then obtained. Third Step f Step(c)]<br>
If the second agglomerates are less than 600 g/l, or if further<br><br>
agglomeration is preferred to meet the optimum condition as the final product from the process of the present invention, the second agglomerates are fed into a fluidized apparatus, such as fluidized bed, in order to enhance granulation for producing free flowing high density granules. The third step can proceed in one or more than one fluidized apparatus (e.g., combining different kinds of fluidized apparatus such as fluid bed dryer and fluid bed cooler). Optionally, about 0 to about 10% , more preferably about 2-5% of powder detergent materials of the kind used in the first step and/or other detergent ingredients can be added to the second step. Also, optionally, about 0 to about 20%, more preferably about 2 to a1 bout 10% of liquid detergent materials of the kind used in the first step, the second step and/or other detergent ingredients can be added to the step, for enhancing granulation and coating on the surface of the granules.<br>
Generally speaking, to achieve the density of at least about 600 g/l, preferably more than 650g/l, condition of a fluidized apparatus can be;<br>
Mean residence time : from about 1 to about 10 minutes<br>
Depth of unfluidized bed : from about 100 to about 300 mm<br>
Droplet spray size : not more than about 50 micron<br>
Spray height: from about 175 to about 250 mm<br>
Fluidizing velocity : from about 0.2 to about 1.4 m/s<br>
Bed temperature : from about 12 to about 100 °C, more preferably;<br>
Mean residence time : from about 2 to about 6 minutes<br>
Depth of unfluidized bed : from about 100 to about 250 mm<br>
Droplet spray size : less than about 50 micron<br>
Spray height: from about 175 to about 200 mm<br>
Fluidizing velocity: from about 0.3 to about 1.0 m/s<br>
Bed temperature : from about 12 to about 80 °C.<br>
If two different kinds of fluidized apparatus would be used, mean residence time of the third step in total can be from about 2 to about 20 minutes, more preferably, from about 2 to 12 minutes.<br>
A coating agent to improve flowability and/or minimize over agglomeration of the detergent composition can be added in one or more of the following locations of the instant process: (1) the coating agent can be added directly after fluid bed cooler or fluid bed dryer; (2) the coating agent may be added between fluid bed dryer and the fluid bed cooler; and/or (3) the coating agent may be<br><br>
added directly to fluid bed dryer. The coating agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of aluminosilicates, silicates, carbonates and mixtures thereof. The coating agent not only enhances the free flowability of the resulting detergent composition which is desirable by consumers in that it permits easy scooping for detergent during use, but also serves to control agglomeration by preventing or minimizing over agglomeration. As those skilled in the art are well aware, over agglomeration can lead to very undesirable flow properties and aesthetics of the final detergent product.<br>

Other preferable examples of the aqueous or non-aqueous polymer solutions which can be used as the finely atomized liquid in the present invention are polymeric polycarboxylate dispersants which can be prepared by polymerizing or copolymerizing suitable unsaturated monomers, preferably in their acid form. Unsaturated monomeric acids that can be polymerized to form suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic dnhydride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid.

More preferred are sodium tripolyphosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, citrate, tartrate mono- and di-succinates, and mixtures thereof (see below).<br>
In comparison with amorphous sodium silicates, crystalline layered sodium silicates exhibit a clearly increased calcium and magnesium ion exchange capacity. In addition, the layered sodium silicates prefer magnesium ions over calcium ions, a feature necessary to insure that substantially all of the "hardness" is removed from the wash water. These crystalline layered sodium silicates, however, are generally more expensive than amorphous silicates as well as other builders. Accordingly, in order to provide an economically feasible laundry detergent, the proportion of crystalline layered sodium silicates used must be determined judiciously. Such crystalline layered sodium silicates are discussed in Corkill et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,605,509, previously incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Specific examples of inorganic phosphate builders are sodium and potassium tripolyphosphate, pyrophosphate, polymeric metaphosphate having a degree of polymerization of from about 6 to 21, and orthophosphates.

Such materials include the water-soluble salts of homo- and copolymers of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as maleic acid, itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, fumaric acid, aconitic acid, citraconic acid and methylene malonic acid. Some of these materials are useful as the water-soluble anionic polymer as hereinafter described, but only if in intimate admixture with the non-soap anionic surfactant.<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates for use herein are the polyacetal carboxylates described in U.S. Patent 4,144,226, issued March 13, 1979 to Crutchfield et al, and U.S. Patent 4,246,495, issued March 27, 1979 to Crutchfleld et al, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. These polyacetal carboxylates can be prepared by bringing together under polymerization condition an ester of glyoxylic acid and a polymerization initiator. The resulting polyacetal carboxylate ester is then attached to chemically stable end groups to stabilize the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid depolymerization in alkaline solution, converted to the corresponding salt, and added to a detergent composition. Particularly preferred polycarboxylate builders are the ether carboxylate builder compositions comprising a combination of tartrate monosuccinate and tartrate disuccinate described in U.S. Patent 4,663,071,<br><br>
