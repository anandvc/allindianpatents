TRANSVERSE-FLOW PYROCATALYTTC REACTOR FOR CONVERSION OF<br>
WASTE PLASTIC MATERIAL AND SCRAP RUBBER<br>
Fie id of the Invention: The present invention relates to an improvement'in a<br>
pyrolysis reactor wherein organic waste is catalytically converted into hydrocarbons<br>
which are recovered as vapor issuing from a molten lead bath. "Organic waste" or<br>
"waste" for brevity, refers herein to a predominantly hydrocarbon synthetic resinous<br>
materials, substantially free of halogen-containing resins, referred to herein as<br>
"plastics", and, rubber from scrap tires.<br>
The plastics or rubber are mixed with a unique catalyst as the mixture is<br>
moved along the heated molten lead along the Length of the bath, longitudinally from<br>
the. bath's feed-inlet end to its residue-discharge end, while the bath is heated with a<br>
heating medium flowing first in a longitudinal direction, then in a direction<br>
transverse to the flow of waste. The reactor is therefore referred to as a "transverseflow<br>
pyrocatalytic;&gt; reactor. The transverse direction is referred to herein as the "x"-<br>
axis, the longitudinal axis is referred to as the "y'-axis -and the vertical direction is<br>
referred to as the "z"-axis. Vapors of hydrocarbons generated within the reactor,<br>
which vapors are readily condensible in a cold water heat exchanger', are recovered<br>
in a conventional recovery system. The recovered, condensed hydrocarbons are<br>
preferably further conventionally refined for use as diesel fuel, gasoline and heating<br>
oil; and the non-condensible hydrocarbons, along with carbon monoxide and carbon<br>
dioxide are preferably recycled as a gaseous recycle stream to provide fuel for<br>
burners used to generate hot gases to heat the bath,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Problem: Molten lead, used as a heating medium to pyrolyze plastics<br>
and rubber waste in the prior art, presents unique problems because lead is about<br>
11.5 times heavier than the waste - the waste is quickly forced to the surface<br>
preventing contact time with the lead long enough to convert the waste in a<br>
reasonable amount of time. Particularly when solid waste includes polyalefins,<br>
poly(vinyl aromatic)s, and rubber from worn out tires, it is difficult to provide an<br>
economical level of conversion to reusable hydrocarbons within a residence time (in<br>
the molten bath) of less than 1 hour, preferably less than 30 mm. "Reusable<br>
hydrocarbons" refers to both higher molecular weight hydrocarbons which are<br>
condensed, and lower molecular weight hydrocarbons which can be recycled as fusl.<br>
Reusable hydrocarbons consist of a major proportion by weight of condeosible Cj"1"<br>
hydrocarbons (having at least five carbon atoms) and a minor proportion (relative to<br>
the C^ hydrocarbons) of non-condensible Cj - 64 hydrocarbons, typically less than<br>
20% by weight of the €5* hydrocarbons, the components in the vapor phase being in<br>
equilibrium with those in the condensate at the temperature and pressure conditions<br>
of condensation within the condenser.<br>
Though a molten lead bath is able to provide a source of heat at a chosen.,<br>
substantially constant temperature, using molten lead (or "melt") as a heat transfer<br>
medium in a substantially oxygen-free atmosphere in the reactor, presents numerous<br>
difficulties. To begin with, a floating layer of organic waste acts as an insulating<br>
barrier, preventing pieces of waste within the floating layer from being'heated<br>
sufficiently to depoiymerize. If the waste cannot be adequately contacted with the<br>
melt it does not matter how much melt is in the bath. Yet. efficient heat transfer<br>
from the melt to the waste, to obtain an economic residence time in the melt, must<br>
not interfere with being able to transport the waste longitudinally through the melt.<br>
To cope with this problem by providing a high enough bath temperature to effect the<br>
pyrolysis in a reasonable amount of time, results in too high a production of<br>
hydrocarbons lower than €4, appreciable CO and COa. To complicate the problem,<br>
when using a solid, particulate, catalyst it is critical that the waste be contacted and<br>
mixed with both the catalyst and the melt.<br>
When such a catalyst is a combination of an aluminum powder and<br>
aluminum oxide mineral, whether calcined hydrated alumina, or calcined zeolite,<br>
this mixing is difficult to do without using a fluid bed. "Zeolite" refers to a natural<br>
or synthetic composition typically having the structure Mx/n[(A102)x(SiO2)y.zH2)<br>
where n is the charge of the metal cation, Mn+, which is usually Na"1", KT, or Ca"'1", x<br>
:ind y an? integers, typically having substantially the same value in the range from 2<br>
to 10, and the z is the number of moles of water of hydration.<br>
Since conversion of scrap rubber generates sulfur and sulfur-containing<br>
compounds, the catalyst, most preferably a combination of aluminum powder and<br>
calcined bauxite powder, is required to be substantially unreactive with both, the<br>
sulfur and sulfur-containing compounds, and chlorine and hydrochloric (HC1) acid<br>
gases, if such gases are present in an appreciable amount. In addition., the reactor<br>
requires an essentially oxygen-free atmosphere within it; and the higJh specific<br>
gravity of lead precludes using very much of the melt in the bath, for practical cost<br>
considerations relating to the structural requirements of a vat or trough in which the<br>
molten lead bath is held.<br>
Moreover, though the housing and other components of the reactor are<br>
typically made of acid and heat-resistant sheet steel, e.g. H25N20S2, the steel does<br>
not have notably long-term resistance to SC&gt;2, £[2803, chlorine and HOI gases. The<br>
reliance on affordable steel and the use of aluminum powder in the catalyst requires<br>
feeding plastic substantially free of a halogen-containing synthetic resin, to the<br>
reaction zone, if safe, long-term operation of the reactor is sought. By "substantially<br>
free of a halogen-containing synthetic resin" is meant that less than 5% by weight of<br>
the waste is a polymer containing chlorine, bromine., iodine or fluorine, e.g.<br>
poly(vinyi chloride) ("PVC") scrap, or other halogen-containing synthetic resins,<br>
e.g. chlorofluoro-, chlorobromo- and fluorocarbon polymers.<br>
The Prior Art:<br>
Molten metal, particularly lead, has been the heat transfer medium of choice •<br>
for the thermal conversion of organic matter, generally. The problem of heating<br>
organic matter which floated on a molten lead bath was recognized as early as<br>
before 1926 when U.S. Patent No. 1,601,777 disclosed moving crushed, shale along<br>
the undersurface of a slightly inclined apertured member, beneath the surface of a<br>
heated bath. U.S. Patent No. 2,459,550 addresses the problem by confining wood or<br>
coal pieces between two endless screens. U.S. Patent No. 3,977,960 teaches using<br>
angularly inclined screw conveyors to force crushed shale into a molten bath. As<br>
recently as (990, U.S. Patent No. 4,925,532 reaches moving perforated baskets filled<br>
with waste on an endless conveyor; the baskets are hooked to the conveyor to<br>
REPLACEMENT<br>
prevent them from floating, against, guide rails above the baskets. Ttae '532 patent<br>
teaches that it is critical that the molten lead bath be maintained above 343°C (650°F),<br>
ignoring the fact that the melting point of pure lead at atmospheric pressure is just<br>
below, i.e. 327.5°C (621.5°F). It failed to realize that a catalyst could enhance<br>
conversion; and it missed the fact that optimum conversion of polyolefins, polystyrene<br>
and scrap from tires, to vapor consisting essentially of a. major proportion by weight of<br>
G5<br>
+ hydrocarbons occurs only in the narrow range from 45O°C - 550°C (842°F -<br>
1022°F), a range commencing more than 10O°C above the temperature deemed<br>
critical. Most recently, in 1992, U.S. Patent No. 5,085,738 teaches using a long,<br>
upwardly inclined oxygen-free cylindrical chamber filled with molten lead, through<br>
which chamber pieces of scrap tires are forced. A ram is used to circumvent the<br>
problem of floating rubber, but still relying solely on the thermal pyrolysis of the<br>
submerged rubber. The prior art countered the high specific gravity of molten lead by<br>
confining the charge in the melt. It ignores the problem of essentially instantly<br>
solidifying molten lead on the rubber as it is fed, because of the low heat capacity (and<br>
specific heat) of the lead; and, the requirement of timely supplying adequate heat to remelt<br>
the lead.<br>
WO 2004/072208 relates to a method and. a device for continuous conversion of<br>
organic waste. More specifically, it relates to treating highly contaminated waste<br>
products and worn out vehicle tires in which the charge is liquefied and then craked<br>
giving a product in the gaseous phase, wherein the charge is introduced into a hot<br>
bath, comprising liquid inorganic medium, displaced through the melting zone and the<br>
decomposition zone and then the gaseous products of the decomposition are collected<br>
at the top and the impurities are removed by means of at least one conveyer,<br>
according to the present invention is characterized in that the decomposition reactions<br>
are carried out catalytically in the liquefied layer (1b) of the charge (1 a) formed on the<br>
surface of the hot bath (5), comprising liquid inorganic medium. A device for<br>
continuous conversion of organic waste, in particular highly contaminated waste<br>
plastics and worn out vehicle tires, in which the charge is liquefied and then cracked<br>

4a<br>
REPLACEMENT<br>
bath, comprising liquid inorganic medium, displaced through the melting zone and the<br>
decomposition zone and then the gaseous products of the decomposition are collected<br>
at the top and the impurities are removed by means of at least one conveyer, the said<br>
device containing a casing, a heating system, a loading system, a charge displacing<br>
system, a product collecting system and an impurities removal system having at least<br>
one conveyer, according to the present invention is characterized in that it has cuboid<br>
integrated modular construction.<br>
WO 03/070815 relates to a catalyst, particularly for thermocatalytic conversion<br>
of polyolefin plastics wastes with the participation of passivated aluminium, according<br>
to the present invention is characterized in that it comprises a spongy bed (1) built of<br>
aluminium microgranules (2) surface covered with aluminum oxides (2a), having a<br>
multilayer bonded structure. The present invention concerns also a method of<br>
manufacturing of a catalyst, particularly for thermocatalytic conversion of polyolefin<br>
plastics wastes, in which melted aluminium is sprayed, which is characterized in that it<br>
comprises spraying onto the surface (11) of the base (3) a spongy bed (1) built of<br>
aluminium microgranules (2) surface covered with aluminium oxides (2a), having<br>
multilayer bonded structure.<br>
It will be evident that the invention disclosed herebelow, for feeding the waste to<br>
the reactor, converting the waste in the reactor, removing and disposing of the residue,<br>
is based on the use of a unique catalyst in combination with a novel and unexpectedly<br>
efficient system of dealing with the numerous problems associated with feeding waste<br>
and catalyst to a molten lead bath in a sealed environment, including, for practical<br>
operation of the reactor, not submerging the waste in the molten lead. Further, not<br>
unexpectedly, the prior art processes and apparatus which rely solely on thermal<br>
pyrolysis of plastics and rubber in molten lead, are conspicuously devoid of data<br>
showing the effectiveness of the conversions obtained. As will be evident from the data<br>
presented below, the conversion of waste to reusable hydrocarbons by pyrolysis in<br>
molten lead alone, is only 53% (see Table 1) when the scrap is PE (polyethylene) and<br>
PP (polypropylene); and more than 90% when the catalyst used is bauxite/AI = 97/3.<br>
Recognizing the advantage of using an effective catalyst for the conversion<br>
of waste polyolefms, polystyrene and the like to hydrocarbons, U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,85 ] ,60 1 teaches using a fluid bed of zeolite particles, as does Chinese patent<br>
application WO95/06682. In each case, hydrocarbons having a wide range of<br>
boiling points are collected, but they rely on the efficient heat transfer provided by<br>
a fluid bed and the catalytic effect of a zeolite only, and the zeolite, by itself is<br>
evidently unaffected by the presence of chlorine in PVC.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The conversion of substantially halogen-free waste to desirable hydrocarbons<br>
is effected by providing an elongated generally rectangular vat or trough in which<br>
molten lead is held within a sealed, essentially oxygen-free housing, and the waste is<br>
contacted with a catalyst consisting of a combination of an aluminum oxide mineral<br>
powder 
diameter, while the waste is being heated with the melt. The catalytic action is<br>
evidently provided by the interaction of the pure aluminum and the aluminum oxide<br>
molecules. The aluminum mineral oxide powder is preferably calcined to avoid<br>
generating water from uncalcined oxide in the melt.<br>
Waste, preferably compacted and fed unconfinedto the inlet of the vat, floats<br>
on the melt and is mixed and tossed with a reciprocable steel grating while the waste<br>
is urged from one end of the vat to the other, being advanced longitudinally through<br>
the vat, without the waste being submerged in the melt. The steel grating moves<br>
from a position under the surface of the melt.where it is heated, to a position above<br>
the melt where the grating transfers the heat to the waste. This feature, utilizing the<br>
much higher heat capacity of steel (nearly three times higher than.that of lead)<br>
overcomes the problem of having molten lead solidify, essentially instantly, on the<br>
waste when it is submerged in the melt. Such solidification results because the rate<br>
of heat transfer from the melt to the waste is so high. Such waste, with lead<br>
solidified on it, must then be transported while being heated to liquefy the melt<br>
Though submerging the waste in the melt will have the same thermal result, in a<br>
commercial reactor to which more than 1000 Kg/hr of waste is fed, it is difficult to<br>
move so r men waste, with solidified lead on it, through the vat; and it is not<br>
practical to heat so-much waste, with solidified lead on it, at a rate high enough to<br>
re-melt the lead on the waste and obtain an economical residence time.<br>
The waste is intermittently advanced by using at least one, preferably plural.<br>
laterally spaced-apart rotatable drums, each provided with radially protruding blades<br>
which urge waste on the surface of the molten lead longitudinally along the length of<br>
the trough. Simultaneously, the waste is bathed with melt scooped up from near the<br>
surface of the bath. Because, as the waste is converted, the amount of floating waste<br>
is progressively reduced, the axis of rotation'of each drum is lower than'the<br>
preceding drum, that is, the -axis of each successive drum is progressively vertically<br>
downwardly spaced-apart.<br>
The use of the reciprocable mixing grating in cooperation with each drum,<br>
except the first near the inlet of the vat, urges waste upwards towards the drum and<br>
bathes floating-waste with molten lead, thus providing the contact necessary to<br>
convert the waste while dealing with solidifying lead; simultaneously, "fingers" on<br>
the drum advance the waste through the vat. It is this unique mechanism for urging<br>
the floating waste through the molten bath without submerging the waste in the bath,<br>
in combination with the catalytic action of the catalyst used, and the essentially<br>
constant temperature of the molten lead held in a desired range of temperature,<br>
which accounts for the success of this waste-conversion process. High conversions<br>
to desirable hydrocarbons, and avoiding the formation of all but a relatively small<br>
amount of carbonaceous residue, is effected by choosing the appropriate temperature<br>
to match the waste being fed. Depending upon how clean the waste is, the residue<br>
will also contain stones, pieces of wire from scrap tires, pieces of stray metal, glass<br>
and other solids not decomposed at the temperature of the molten lead. The residue<br>
is continuously removed from the reactor with an endless, chain conveyor.<br>
Either crushed calcined bauxite alone, or aluminum powder alone, is<br>
insufficiently effective as a catalyst to convert waste, even when &gt;90% (more than<br>
90 percent) of the bauxite particles are 90% of the<br>
aluminum powder particles are 
than bauxite). "Diameter" refers to the equivalent diameter of a particle. However,<br>
when a mixture consisting essentially of a major proportion by weight of the sarne<br>
bauxite is combined with a minor proportion of the saxne aluminum powder and<br>
contacted with both the heated waste and molten lead, the combination catalyst is<br>
typically more than 60% effective to convert the waste into reusable hydrocarbons.<br>
Unexpectedly, the substantially halogen- free, reactive atmosphere of hydrocarbons<br>
within the reactor, boosts the effectiveness of the aluminum powder rather than<br>
negating .it.<br>
Contact with molten lead, by waste and catalyst, both of which are much<br>
lighter than lead, is ensured by using a combination of successive drums with<br>
radially protruding mixing fingers which engage the waste in the floating layer as it<br>
is moved upwards by a grating. The grating is part of a U-shaped saddle forming a<br>
cooperating mixing and bathing assembly. The grating reciprocates at a slight angle,<br>
less than 30° to the vertical, heats the waste by contact "with it, and bathes the<br>
floating waste with melt scooped from the surface of tta.e bath. This combined action<br>
of heating and bathing the waste with melt and also urging it longitudinally along<br>
the length of the bath, allows conversion of the waste with a. residence time in the<br>
molten bath, of less- than 1 hour, preferably less than 30 mm.<br>
Though lead melts at 327.5°C (62L5T), optimum effectiveness of the<br>
catalyst is achieved at a temperature in the narrow range from about 450°C - 550°C<br>
(S42°F - 1022°F); conversions to reusable hydrocarbons drops off at temperatures<br>
below 450°C, but above 400°C, and above 550°C but below 600°C where conversion<br>
to C}1" hydrocarbons decreases, and to Co, and lower hydrocarbons increases above<br>
20%, and normally negligible oxidation to CO and COz increases.<br>
A process for pyrocatalytic conversion of organic waste comprises, feeding<br>
waste into a reaction zone of a pyrocataiytic reactor, the waste being essentially fres<br>
of a halogenated synthetic resinous material; mixing the waste with a minor<br>
proportion by weight of a catalyst in a bath of molten lead held at a temperature in<br>
the range from 400°C to 600°C in an elongated vat; recovering hydrocarbons<br>
generated in the reactor; and, removing carbonaceous residue. Thus, though the<br>
waste is anconfined, except by the surface of the melt, tJhe waste is thermally and<br>
catalytic,illy converted with at least 50% effectiveness into reusable hydrocarbon<br>
vapors which are condensed.<br>
The catalyst consists essentially of a major proportion by weight of bauxite<br>
powder, preferably calcined, in combination with a minor proportion of the<br>
aluminum powder having a minimum nominal aluminum content of at least 95%,<br>
preferably at least 98%, and a Fe content of less than 0.5% and Si less than 0.2%.<br>
The amount of the catalyst required is preferably no more than 2 0% by weight of the<br>
waste charged, preferably less than 10%, most preferably from about 0.5 to 5%.<br>
The system for converting the waste comprises an elongated vat which is<br>
confined in an essentially oxygen-free environment of the reactor; the vat has a feedinlet<br>
or "charging" end and a "residue-discharging" or "discharging" end; the length<br>
of the vat is sufficient to afford a residence time for the waste of no more than one<br>
hour, and the depth of molten lead in the vat is at least 10 cm. Th.e waste on the<br>
molten lead is urged along the vat's longitudinal axis and bathed, substantially<br>
simultaneously, with melt. The contact of waste with melt is effected by a<br>
reciprocabJe grating moving into and out of the melt. Preferably, the reactor is fed<br>
with a feeding mechanism which compacts waste into a feed tube at the inlet of the<br>
reactor, forming an air-tight seal; and carbonaceous residue is discharged by being<br>
compacted against an inclined plane and an adjustable continuous chain conveyor<br>
into a residue-disposing assembly.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EiVffiODMENTS<br>
The key feature of the process is contacting the waste with a combination<br>
catalyst selected from the group consisting of a particulate calcined hydrated<br>
aluminum oxide and a zeolite, mixed with aluminum powder in a molten lead ba_th.<br>
The waste Is typically selected from the group consisting of a polyolefin., e.g. PE and<br>
PP; a poly(vinyl aromatic), e.g polystyrene; a polyamide, e.g. nylon; a rubber<br>
derived from a conjugated diene, the diene having from 4 to 5 carbon atoms, e.g.<br>
poiy butadiene and polyisoprene, whether natural or synthetic; and, a rubber defined<br>
as a polyblock copolymer of 3. vinyiaromatic compound and a conjugated diene,<br>
optionally hydrogenated to include a block of a monoolefm, the olefin having from 2<br>
to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. Kraton® styrene-butadiene-styrene or "SBS" rubber, The<br>
term "aluminum oxide mineral" refers to minerals which contain a high amount of<br>
alumina, for example the hydrated aluminas and the zeolites which are alumino<br>
silicates. This combination catalyst, in which the preferred aluminum oxide mineral<br>
is a calcined hydrated alumina, results in a practical residence time of less than I<br>
hour results from mixing the waste and forcefully urging it from the feed-charging<br>
or inlet end of the vat to the residue-discharging end of the vat.<br>
Aluminum powder consists essentially of microgranules most of which have<br>
an equivalent diameter of less than 44 jim, each being essentially pure aluminum<br>
(99.5% Al) coated with a-thin skin less than 0.1 um thick (referred to as a<br>
"nanothick skin")- Such powder is preferably made by atomization of molten<br>
aluminum through small orifices in an atomizing head immersed in molten<br>
aluminum. As'molten aluminum flows through the orifices it strikes a stream of<br>
compressed air. This forms a spray of aluminum melt which is quenched at rates on ..<br>
the order of 102 to 10s °K7sec to form substantially spherical microgranules of pure .<br>
Al coatcci with an aluminum oxide skin from 3 to 20 rim thick.<br>
The most preferred finely divided aluminum oxide mineral is calcined<br>
bauxite (and commercially available), though less readily available particulate<br>
gibbsite (a trihydrate), boehmite and diaspqre (monohydrates), may also be used,<br>
When initially starting up the system, to facilitate catalytic conversion of the waste,<br>
catalyst is dropped onto freshly molten lead in the vat, from hatches (openings) in •<br>
the roof of the reactor. Before feeding waste to trie reactor it is mixed with a small<br>
amount of additional catalyst so that the amount of catalyst in the waste while it is in<br>
the reactor is in the range from about 0.5% to 20%.<br>
The preferred bauxite employed by the process is paniculate bauxite,<br>
available in Poland as "Boksyt kalcynowany"' in a. size range 
following analysis: Ai2O3 -min 86% (typically 87.2%); Fe2O3 - max-2% (typically<br>
max 1.6%); K2O + Na2O - max 025% (typically 0.18%) and Si02 - max 6%<br>
(typically 5,2%); the sp. gr. is in the range from 2,5-3.2, the bulk density is about<br>
3.1 g/cc the apparent porosity is 
range from about 50 um to 250 urn, less than 10°/o being smaller than 50 um, and<br>
the remaining being in the range from 250 um to O.I mm.<br>
Aluminum powder is preferably metallurgical grade available from Benda-<br>
Lutz Skawina having the following typical analysis: 99.7% Al; 0.28% Fe; and 0.07<br>
Si. A typical particle .size distribution is as follows: 77.6% &gt; 0.032 mm; 36.1% &gt;<br>
0.063 aim; and 4.0% &gt; 0.09 mm. The average particle diameter of the Al powder is<br>
in the range from about 25 - 50 o-m. Comparable aluminum powder is available<br>
from Alcoa in the Grade 100 and Grade 1200 series, among others.<br>
A preferred ratio of the aluminum powder to bauxite powder is in the range<br>
iium about 0.5 - 20% aluminum powder, preferably in the range from about 1 - 10%<br>
aluminum powder, most preferably less than 5%, there being very little economic<br>
improvement in conversion when the amount of aluminum powder exceeds 10%.<br>
Instead of mixing calcined aluminum oxide mineral, e.g. bauxite with<br>
aluminum powder, an alternative method for preparing the catalyst is by spraying a<br>
molten stream of aluminum at a temperature above 1200°C onto a falling stream of<br>
bauxite panicles in the size range given above. This results in the aluminum powder<br>
bemt' adhered to and supported on the particles of bauxite. In one embodiment, this<br>
may be achieved by mixing solid particles of aluminum metal into the flame of an<br>
oxy-acetylene torch at a temperature in the range from about 2000°C to 3000°C and<br>
directing the flame at a falling stream of particles of bauxite. The same may be done<br>
with any other aluminum oxide mineral, whether zeolite, gibbsite, etc..<br>
The pyrocatalytic conversion of waste is most effective when the system is<br>
fed with waste which is not "mixed" waste, but a particular class of waste, e.g.-<br>
polyolefius; or polystyrene; or scrap rubber from vulcanized polybutadiene,<br>
polyLsoprene and natural rubber in automobile, truck and aircraft tires. To a lesser<br>
extent, the catalyst is also effective with other poly(vinyl aromatic) resins, nitrite<br>
rubber, styrene-conjugated diene-styrene rubber, acrylate rubber and other<br>
predominantly hydrocarbon plastics. It is therefore desirable to sort the waste to<br>
provide a particular material to be converted under temperature conditions and a<br>
ratio of catalyst components specifically chosen for that material,'<br>
Irrespective of the particular waste chosen, its specific gravity is typically<br>
about 1 or less, and, when fed into the molten lead, the waste will be forcefully<br>
thrust to trie surface, forming a waste layer which functions as insulation,<br>
minimizing contact of all but the bottom of the layer with the molten lead and<br>
catalyst.<br>
Though any bath containing a predominant amount of lead may be used, a<br>
lead bath containing less than 10% by weight of another metal is preferred. Such a<br>
bath provides a high heat transfer coefficient, the heat content of the bath is rapidly<br>
exhausted as waste is converted, and the heat must be just as rapidly replenished.<br>
The limitations this places on the system are magnified by (i) heat conduction<br>
occurring primarily in the vertical direction as the source of heat is from below the<br>
melt, and (ii) the layer of floating waste effectively insulating the upper portion of<br>
the layer from the heat in the melt. Therefore it is critical that, to meet an economic<br>
residence time of less than an hour, the floating waste be actively bathed with melt<br>
as the waste is urged along longitudinally along the surface of the melt.<br>
It is not necessary, if the waste is polyolefin film, or small containers thereof,<br>
tc comminute the waste, but it is desirable to cut up tires into pieces having an<br>
f.yerage weight in the range from about 50 g - 1 Kg, thus avoiding the cost of .<br>
comminuting the tires into pieces weighing less. Means for cutting up tires are well<br>
known and any of these means may be employed with varying degrees of<br>
effectiveness, those providing relatively smaller similarly sized pieces being easily<br>
fed into and submerged in the molten lead.<br>
Referring now to Figs 1-5, the system includes a feeding mechanism,<br>
referred to generally by reference numeral 90 (see Fig 5\ through which waste W is<br>
fed to a reactor 10 housed in an insulated housing H (not shown in Fig 1, see Fig 4).<br>
Waste W is converted to hydrocarbons in an ejongated, heated vat 20 in the reactor,<br>
leaving a residue R which is discharged first through a residue-discharging<br>
mechanism 60, and thereafter, to a residue-disposing mechanism 80. The waste W is<br>
compacted and fed to the reactor 10 as a dense, tightly-packed mass of W which<br>
functions as an effective air-tight seal to prevent entry of air into the inlet end of the<br>
reactor. The waste W enters the vat on an inlet-incline 21 functioning as a feedguide<br>
for waste and guiding it to flow beneath a first of at least two, and preferably<br>
five urging drums 13, 14, 15, [6 and 17, each rotatably mounted on axiaily aligned<br>
supporting shafts 18 and 18' (see Fig 2), one of which (IS'} is a passive shaft, the<br>
other (18, not visible) driven by drive means such as an electric motor (not shown).<br>
The reactor 10 preferably comprises a box-shaped reinforced steei casing 11<br>
having a roof 12, front and rear sidewalls 19 and 19' (only rear sidewall 19' is<br>
shown) and end walls El, E2 all of which are insulated to conserve heat within the<br>
reactor, and further protected by an outer insulated structure (not shown in Fig 1).<br>
The roof 12 is provided with removably scalable covered hatches 12' to allow<br>
catalyst to be charged to the vat initially (before commencing operation of the<br>
reactor), and to permit servicing the reactor. In the vault above the vat 20, near the<br>
top of rear sidewall 19' are provided several laterally spaced-apart effluent ducts<br>
"D" through which hydrocarbon vapors are ducted to a vapor recovery system (not<br>
shown).<br>
Heat to the lead in the vat 20, resting on an insulated base B, is supplied by a<br>
heating system inc.iuding at least one array of plural, parallel, heating tubes 22<br>
spaced-apart along the x-axis. and preferably multiple parallel arrays, one disposed<br>
above the..' oilier, the neating tubes of the one array being staggered relative to the<br>
other. The tubes 22 are in open communication with side hot-air manifolds-23, 23'<br>
(Fig 3) or; either side of the vat, through which manifolds and tubes a heating<br>
medium is ducted, back-and-ibrth, until the heating medium leaves the heating<br>
system. Preferably the heating medium is provided by hot gases generated by<br>
burners fueled by oil or natural gas. The derails of the means for heating the lead in<br>
the vat are not narrowly critical as long as the heating medium is supplied at a<br>
temperature above about 650D€, preferably above 900°C such temperature being<br>
provided by the hot gases. Sufficient lead is loaded into the vat so that when the lead<br>
is molten, its level "L" is preferably at least 10 cm above the upper surface of the<br>
uppermost array of heating tubes hi the bath. The molten lead presents a planar<br>
surface extending from the vat's inlet end 24 to its discharge end 25.<br>
A convenient size for the internal dimensions of a reactor is about 7.5 m long<br>
x 1.2 m wide and 2.1 rn high, the length of the bottom 26 of the vat corresponding to<br>
that of the- bottom of the reactor.<br>
Referring to Fig 2, there is shown a hollow, acid-resistant steel drum 14 with<br>
its axis of rotation along the x-axis in a mixing and bathing assembly 40. Drums 15,<br>
16, 17 and IS are similar to drum 14 and are about equidistantly longitudinally<br>
spaced-apart from one and another (along the y-axis) inside the reactor. Because the<br>
amount of waste under each successive drum 14-18 progressively diminishes as W<br>
is converted, the height at which each drum 15-18 is mounted within the reactor,<br>
decreases progressively. Thus, the axis of rotation of drum 14 is lower than that of<br>
drum 13; the axis of rotation of drum 15 is lower than that of drum 14; the axis of<br>
rotation of drum 16 is lower than that of drum 15; and so forth, drum 17 being<br>
mounted for rotation closest to the level L because substantially all the waste has<br>
been converted at that point.<br>
Each drum is independently rotatable and provided with its own mixing and<br>
bathing assembly 40. Drum 13 being positioned near the inlet of the reactor does not<br>
have a mixing and bathing assembly as its sole function is to urge the waste under<br>
the drum 14. The height at which drum 13 is mounted depends upon the particular<br>
teed, beifiiJ higher for poiyolefin sheet and lower for scrap rubber. In genera!, the<br>
spacing of the lower surface of the drum 13 from the surface of the'melt L, is in the<br>
range from 25 - 35 cm, and the spacing of the other drums, successively lower, the<br>
spacing of the lower surface of the last drum 17.being in the range from about 10-<br>
15 err; above L.<br>
The length of each drum (along the x-axis) is approximately the same as the<br>
width of the vat 20 (along the x-axis), and each end of each drum 14-17 has a camfollower<br>
rod 41, 41' (not shown) secured near the circumference of each drum's<br>
end, die rods 41, 41' projecting parallel to shafts 18, IS', in the x-axis direction. The<br>
circumferential surface 42 of the drum is provided with plural, generally laminar<br>
radial projections 43, 44, 45, 46 (not visible) spaced-apart axially, in rows along the<br>
surface and staggered in spaced-apart relationship around the-circumference. As<br>
shown, four rows of projections are staggered at right angles to each other, each pair"<br>
of rows being positioned at diametrically opposite ends. These projections are<br>
referred to as "mixing and urging blades", more conveniently as "fingers", because<br>
their function is to mix the waste under the drum and urge the waste away from the<br>
drum, along the y-axis. Though the shape of each of the fingers is not narrowly<br>
critical, it is preferred they be relatively broad at their straight edges 47, projecting<br>
radially, for maximum thrust efficiency. As shown in the schematic detail of a finger<br>
in Fig 2A, a strip 48 is welded at right angles to an arcuate piece 49 which reinforces<br>
strip 48, and both are welded to the surface 42 of the drum. The arrow shows the<br>
direction of rotation of the drum. As the drum rotates, the leading edge of the<br>
arcuate reinforcing 49 moves through the waste and directs it against the strip 48.<br>
A U-shaped saddle 30 having'a grating 31 and sides 32, 33, is pivotably<br>
mounted with generally triangular flanges 34, 34' (not shown) for rotation about a<br>
pivot rod 35. The grating 31 is provided with plural parallel, spaced-apart slits 36.<br>
Each side 32 and 33 has a cam-opening 37, 37' of identical outline cut into each<br>
side, so as to allow the respective cam-follower rods 41, 41' to ride the inside edges<br>
of each cam-opening as the drum rotates. The rotation of the drum thus raises and<br>
lowers the grating in a slightly angulated, generally vertical direction, between an<br>
':up" position above the melt arid a "down position under the surface of the melt<br>
This motion simultaneously raises the floating waste while heating it, and scoops up<br>
melt corning through the slits 36 so as to bathe the waste with melt. Preferably, the<br>
"up" posidon is about 5 cm above the melt's surface and the "down" position is<br>
about 5 cm below the melt's surface.<br>
To ensure that the waste is efficiently transferred from under one drum to the<br>
next, the radial length of the fingers is such that the tips of the fingers ic each row<br>
sweep past close to the surface of the grating 31. This action requires that the longest<br>
fingers 44 sweep the grating when it is at its nadir (lowest point) in the melt, and that<br>
the fingers 46 be shortest when the grating is at its apogee (highest point) above the<br>
melt. This is achieved by aligning the cam-follower rods 41, 41' with the longest<br>
fingers when the rods 41, 41' are welded to the drum.<br>
As waste W is mixed, bathed with melt and transported through the reactor,<br>
the waste is'converted into Q — €24* hydrocarbons, CO and COa which are removed<br>
from the reactor through effluent ducts D, leaving a residue R. The R-discharging<br>
mechanism 60 and the R-disposing mechanism 80 cooperate to provide an effective<br>
air-tight seal at the outlet end of the reactor.<br>
It is seen that the R-discharging mechanism 60 comprises a discharge-incline<br>
61 the lower edge of which commences at'the upper edge of the vat 20 at its outlet<br>
end 25. The upper edge of the incline 61 terminates in a V-shaped saddle 62 in<br>
which the apex 63 is semicircular to cradle a discharge screw conveyor 64. Above<br>
the discharge-incline 61 is proximally mounted an endless chain conveyor 64,<br>
having a drive cylinder 65 on which the chain is drivingly trained, and which chain<br>
goes around stationary passive cylinder 66, the drive cylinder being at the lower end<br>
of the conveyor. The vertical position of the drive cylinder 65 is adjustable by<br>
movement of a pivot arm 67 that is connected to the drive cylinder with a link 68 so<br>
that the angle at which the chain conveyor operates is in the range from 1° to about<br>
20° to the horizontal. In operation, the lower portion of the chain around the passive<br>
cylinder 66 is about 5 cm above the upper edge of the discharge incline 61, and the<br>
lower portion of the chain around the drive cylinder is about 15 cm above the lower<br>
edge of the'dLscharge incline so that the chain is able to urge residue R up the<br>
discharge incline and over its upper edge into the V-shaped saddle 62. The angle at<br>
Vr'hich the chain conveyor is operated is chosen as a function of "the particular rype<br>
When residue R is dropped into the saddle 62, the screw conveyor 64 pushes<br>
the residue R. out of the saddle into the R-disposing mechanism 70 (see Fig 4)<br>
Referring to F'ig 4 there is schematically illustrated the screw conveyor 64<br>
driven by a motor M1 which drives the screw until it drops residue R into a vented<br>
residue collection chamber 71 provided with an overhead recycle duct 72 to recycle<br>
gases from the chamber 71 to the environment in the reactor, above the vat 20. The<br>
chamber 71 has mounted therewithin a manually operable ("hand-cranked") paddle<br>
agitator 72 which may be intermittently rotated to mix the residue and prevent it<br>
clumping up. The floor of the chamber 71 is provided with a central semi-cylindrical<br>
trough extending beyond the chamber as pipe- 73 having a discharge outlet 74. A<br>
manually operated screw conveyor 73 is rotatably disposed in the trough and<br>
extends into the pipe 73 so that when shaft 75 of the screw conveyor 73 is rotated,<br>
residue is conveyed to the discharge outlet 74 which is normally sealed against entry<br>
of air with a gasketed sealing plate 75 and cooperating quick-opening and quickclosing<br>
clamp 76.<br>
Intermittently, a. residue-disposing means 80 is locked to the'discharge outlet<br>
74 to receive the residue. Preferably a scalable, wheeled cart 81 is used, the cart<br>
having an opening 82 In the ceiling of the cart, and another opening 83 in an end-wall<br>
near the floor of the cart. Each opening is provided with plates and quick-opening<br>
and quick-closing clamps which seal the interior of the cart against leakage of gas.<br>
Opening 82 is opened and locked to the discharge outlet 74 when the cart is to be<br>
loaded with residue R discharged from the collection chamber 71. When the cart is<br>
locked in this position, the screw conveyor 73 is rotated, and residue R is discharged<br>
no the osnin*1 82 of tiic csjrt.<br>
Reverting to Fig: 3, it is seen that drum-supporting shafts 18 and 18' are<br>
supported in the sidewalls of structural insulated housing H (see Fig 4) that protects<br>
and insulates the reactor 10. The drum 17 is show with only three fingers in each<br>
row, and the U-shaped saddle 30 is not shown so as to minimize confusion. Waste<br>
W is forced under the pi ural drums above the surface of the melt to which heat is<br>
supplied, first through longitudinal heating tubes 27 under the melt and then by<br>
plural banks of transversely disposed heating tubes 22 (see Fig 1), the hot gases<br>
traveling from one bank to the next through the side manifolds, until ducted away<br>
from the reactor. Hydrocarbons are led from ducts D to a condenser where they are<br>
condensed to recover mainly some C4 and essentially all the other components<br>
heavier than CU. The level of the surface of the melt is monitored by level control<br>
LC in one side 19 of the reactor.<br>
Waste W may be charged to the reactor R with any conventional feeding<br>
mechanism 90 such as is illustrated in Fig 5, provided the inlet to the reactor is<br>
sealed against entry of air. In the mechanism'illustrated, waste W is dumped into a<br>
feed bin 91 from which rt is discharged onto a endless conveyor 92 and into a wastecharging<br>
hopper 93 in open communication with a charging lock 94 defined by<br>
spaced-apart quick-opening and closing valves 95, 96. Valve 96 is positioned above<br>
an initial waste-compressing feeder 97 adapted to feed the waste W to a single-stage<br>
fluid-actuated press 100. A plate 98 is pivotafaly mounted between the feeder 97 and<br>
the press ; 00 for movement from a vertical position (which allows waste to flow<br>
past the plate), to a horizontal position, closing the lower opening of the feeder 97. A<br>
fluid-actuated cylinder 99 opens and closes the plate 9.8.<br>
After the waste W is initially compressed in the press 100, a ram 101<br>
compresses the waste horizontally and forces the W into and through a flanged<br>
connector tube 102 which connects the inlet of the reactor in open communication<br>
with the press 100. With this arrangement it is seen that the volume between the<br>
connector tube 102 and the inlet to the reactor is so densely packed with waste W<br>
tliat the waste forms an air-tight seal preventing entry of air into the reactor, and exit<br>
of gases cut of the reactor.<br>
The invention described herein is further described by the following specif c<br>
examples that are given by way of illustration and not as a limitation on the scope of<br>
the invention.<br>
The following runs were made with (1) scrap polyolafin waste, mainly PE<br>
and PP; (2) scrap rubber obtained by cutting up worn automobile tires; (3)<br>
polystyrene; and (4) scrap Kraton© styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer,<br>
referred to as "SBS". All runs use a mixture of the calcined bauxite and aluminum<br>
powder in various proportions as catalyst. The mixture of waste and catalyst is fed in<br>
less than one minute, to a pilot plant scale reactor containing a molten lead bath<br>
maintained at about 500°C. In each run, 1 -Kg of the waste is mixed with 200 g of<br>
catalyst, to ensure maximum conversion. In the following Table 1, "% conversion"<br>
refers to the ratio of reusable hydrocarbons to waste fed, and the amounts of bauxite<br>
and Al powder are stated in grams. Most of these hydrocarbons, which are recovered<br>
in a water-cooled heat exchanger, boil in the range from 4-0°C - 400CC; the<br>
remaining hydrocarbons, in the range from Cj - €4, are present in an amount less<br>
than 20% of the condensed hydrocarbons. The cooling water used in the examples is<br>
recycled after being air-cooled, for example in heat exchangers to heat offices in the<br>
vicinity of the reactor, and enters the condenser at 30°C. Colder water will result in<br>
more C1" components being condensed, it being understood that conditions of<br>
pressure and temperature in the condenser are such that predominantly Cs*~<br>
components condense in the liquid phase which is in equilibrium with vapors<br>
saturated with the components. All runs are completed in less than 30 min, after<br>
which the reactor is allowed to cool and the residue recovered.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It is evident from the foregoing data for conversions of bauxite and Al<br>
powder, individually, that 97% bauxite and 3% by weight of pure Al powder is more<br>
effective than pure Al powder by itself. One would expect (by ratioing yields of<br>
PE/PP obtained with bauxite and A] powder, individually) that 3/97 or Al/bauxite<br>
would yield 70.81% conversion.<br>
Ratioing yields of scrap rubber obtained with bauxite and AJ powder,<br>
individually, it is evident that 3/97 of Al/bauxite would yield 40.45% conversion,<br>
not 53%.<br>
It s evident, that quite unexpectedly for each waste, the combination of<br>
Al/bauxite produces a much higher conversion than calculated.<br>
It is also evident that the same combination produces lower con."versions of<br>
scrap rubber, polystyrene and SBS rubber, than of PE/PP, but it is economical to<br>
process most such waste in the reactor because it yields at least 40% by weight<br>
conversion (of the waste fed) to €5* hydrocarbons.<br>
Example 10<br>
Molten Lead Bath Temperature: 465!C - 495°C.<br>
1 Kg of PE/PP is mixed with 200 g of catalyst containing 97% calcined<br>
bauxite and 3% Al powder, and fed to the bath in less than 1 min. The effluent<br>
vapors from the reactor were condensed in a water condenser (water temperature<br>
about 30°C). Boiling points of the condensed hydrocarbons range from 210°C -<br>
400°C. The weight of the condensate is 930 g, indicating 93% conversion of PE/PP.<br>
In an analogous manner, polyester from discarded beverage bottles and<br>
polyamide, i.e. nylon scrap is also converted, though with lower conversions.<br>

strands of wire still in the rubber, is mixed with 200 g of catalyst containing the<br>
stated amounts (in grams) of caicined bauxite and Al powder, and fed to the bath in<br>
less than 1 min. The effluent vapors from the reactor were condensed in. a water<br>
condenser (inlet water temperature about 30QC), Boiling points of the condensed<br>
hydrocarbons range from 235°C - 400°C. In the following Table 2, the weights of<br>
bauxite, Al powder and the condensate collected, is given in grams, and also as tc%<br>
conversion" (% of rubber fed).<br>

It is evident from the foregoing data that maximum conversion of rubber at<br>
the stated temperature is obtained with from about 3 -10% by weight of Al powder.<br>
Having thus provided a general discussion, described the overall process and<br>
apparatus in detail and illustrated the invention with specific examples of the best<br>
mode of carrying out the process, it will be evident that the invention has provided<br>
an effective solution to an old and difficult problem. It is therefore to be understood<br>
that no undue restrictions are to be imposed by reason of the specific embodiments<br>
illustrated and discussed, and particularly that the invention is not restricted to a<br>
slavish adherence to the details set forth herein.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
