ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT CELLULAR CYTOTOXICITY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to the field of glycosylation engineering of<br>
proteins. More particularly, the present invention relates to glycosylation<br>
engineering to generate proteins with improved therapeutic properties, including<br>
antibodies with increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Glycoproteins mediate many essential functions in human beings, other<br>
eukaryotic organisms, andsomeprokaryotes, including catalysis, signaling, cell-<br>
cell communication, and molecular recognition and association. They make up<br>
the majority of non-cytosolic proteins in eukaryotic organisms. (Lis et al.,Eur.<br>
J. Biochem. 218:1-27 (1993)). Many glycoproteins have been exploited for<br>
therapeutic purposes, and during the last two decades, recombinant versions of<br>
naturally-occurring, secreted glycoproteins have been a major product of the<br>
biotechnology industry. Examples include erythropoietin (EPO), therapeutic<br>
monoclonal antibodies (therapeutic mAbs), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA),<br>
interferon-P, (IFN-p), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-<br>
CSF), and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). (Cumming et ah,<br>
Glycobiology 7:115-130 (1991)).<br>
[0003] The oligosaccharide component can significantly affect properties<br>
relevant to the efficacy of atherapeutic glycoprotein, including physical stability,<br>
resistance to protease attack, interactions with the immune system,<br>
pharmacokinetics, and specific biological activity. Such properties may depend<br>
not only on the presence or absence, but also on the specific structures, of<br>
oligosaccharides. Some generalizations between oligosaccharide structure and<br>
glycoprotein function can be made. For example, certain oligosaccharide<br>
structures mediate rapid clearance of the glycoprotein from the bloodstream<br>
through interactions with specific carbohydrate bindingproteins, while others can<br>
be bound by antibodies and trigger undesired immune reactions. (Jenkins et al.,<br>
Nature Biotechnol. 14:975-81(1996)).<br>
[0004] Mammalian cells are the preferred hosts for production of therapeutic<br>
glycoproteins, due to their capability to glycosylate proteins in the most<br>
compatible form for human application. (Cumming et al., Glycobiology 7:115-<br>
30 (1991); Jenkins et al, Nature Biotechnol. 14:975-81 (1996)). Bacteria very<br>
rarely glycosylate proteins, and like other types of common hosts, such as yeasts,<br>
filamentous fungi, insect and plant cells, yield glycosylation patterns associated<br>
with rapid clearance from the bloodstream, undesirable immune interactions, and<br>
in some specific cases, reduced biological activity. Among mammalian cells,<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have been most commonly used during the<br>
last two decades. In addition to giving suitable glycosylation patterns, these cells<br>
allow consistent generation of genetically stable, highly productive clonal cell<br>
lines. They can be cultured to high densities in simple bioreactors using serum-<br>
free media, and permit the development of safe and reproducible bioprocesses.<br>
Other commonly used animal cells include baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells,<br>
NS0- and SP2/0-mouse myeloma cells. More recently, production from<br>
trarisgenic animals has also been tested. (Jenkins et al., Nature Biotechnol.<br>
14:975-81 (1996)).<br>
[0005] All antibodies contain carbohydrate structures at conserved positions in<br>
the heavy chain constant regions, with each isotype possessing a distinct array of<br>
N-linked carbohydrate structures, which variably affect protein assembly,<br>
secretion or functional activity. (Wright, A., and Morrison, S. L., Trends<br>
Biotech. 75:26-32 (1997)). The structure of the attached N-linked carbohydrate<br>
varies considerably, depending on the degree of processing, and can include<br>
high-mannose, multiply-branched as well as biantennary complex<br>
oligosaccharides. (Wright, A., and Morrison, S. L., Trends Biotech. 75:26-32<br>
(1997)). Typically, there is heterogeneous processing of the core oligosaecharide<br>
structures attached at a particular glycosylation site such that even monoclonal<br>
antibodies exist as multiple glycoforms. Likewise, it has been shown that major<br>
differences in antibody glycosylation occur between cell lines, and even minor<br>
differences are seen for a given cell line grown under different culture conditions.<br>
(Lifely, M. R. et ah, Glycobiology 5(8):813-22 (1995)).<br>
[0006] Unconjugatedmonoclonalantibodies(niAbs)canbeusefulmedicinesfor<br>
the treatment of cancer, as demonstrated by the U.S. Food and Drug<br>
Administration's approval of Rituximab (Rituxan™; IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San<br>
Diego, CA, and Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA), for the treatment of CD20<br>
positive B-cell, low-grade or follicular Non-Hodgkin's lymphorna, and<br>
Trastuzumab (Herceptin™; Genentech Inc,) forthe treatment of advanced breast<br>
cancer (Grillo-Lopez, A.-J., etal, Semin. Oncol. 26:66-73 (1999); Goldenberg,<br>
M. M., Clin. Ther. 21:309-18 (1999)). The success of these products relies not<br>
only on their efficacy but also on their outstanding safety profiles (Grillo-Lopez,<br>
A.-J., et ah, Semin. Oncol. 26:66-13 (1999); Goldenberg, M. M., Clin. Ther.<br>
27:309-18 (1999)). In spite of the achievements of these two drugs, there is<br>
currently a large interest in obtaining higher specific antibody activity than what<br>
is typically afforded by unconjugated mAb therapy.<br>
[0007] One way to obtain large increases in potency, while maintaining a simple<br>
production process and potentially avoiding significant, undesirable side effects,<br>
is to enhance the natural, cell-mediated effector functions of mAbs by<br>
engineering their oligosaccharide component (Umana, P. et ah, Nature<br>
Biotechnol. 77:176-180 (1999)). IgGl type antibodies, the most commonly used<br>
antibodies in cancer immunotherapy, are glycoproteins that have a conserved N-<br>
linked glycosylation site at Asn297 in each CH2 domain. The two complex bi-<br>
antennary oligosaccharides attached to Asn297 are buried between the CH2<br>
domains, forming extensive contacts with the polypeptide backbone, and their<br>
presence is essential for the antibody to mediate effector functions; such as<br>
antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Lifely, M. R., et al.,<br>
Glycobiology .5:813-822 (1995); Jefferis, R., et al., Immunol Rev. 163:59-76<br>
(1998); Wright, A. and Morrison, S. L., Trends Biotechnol. 75:26-32 (1997)).<br>
[0008] The present inventors showed previously that overexoression in Chinese<br>
hamster ovary (CHO) cells of p(l,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase HI<br>
(GnTlIT), a glycosyltransferase catalyzing the formation of bisected<br>
oligosaccharides, significantly increases the in vitro ADCC activity of an anti-<br>
neuroblastoma chimeric monoclonal antibody (chCE7) produced by the<br>
engineered CHO cells. (See Umaña, P. et al., Nature Biotechnol. 17:176-180<br>
(1999), International Publication No. WO 99/54342. the entire contents of each<br>
of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety); The antibody<br>
chCE7 belongs to a large class of unconjugated mAbs which have high tumor<br>
affinity and specificity, but have too little potency to be clinically useful when<br>
produced in standard industrial cell lines lacking the GnTIII enzyme (Umana, P.,<br>
et al, Nature Biotechnol. 17:176-180 (1999)). That study was the first to show<br>
that large increases of maximal in vitro ADCC activity could be obtained by<br>
increasing the proportion of constant region (Fc)-associated, bisected<br>
oligosaccharides above the levels found in naturally occurring antibodies. To<br>
determine if this finding could be extrapolated to an unconjugated mAb, which<br>
already has significant ADCC activity in the absence of bisected<br>
oligosaccharides, the present inventors have applied this technology to<br>
Rituximab, the anti-CD20, IDEC-C2B8 chimeric antibody. The present<br>
inventors have likewise applied the technology to the unconjugated anti-cancer<br>
mAb chG250.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The present inventors have now generated new glycosylation variants of<br>
the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) IDEC-C2B8 (Rituximab) and the<br>
anti-cancer mAb chG250 using genetically engineered mAb-producing cell lines<br>
that overexpress N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase in (GnTIII; EC 2.1.4.144) in<br>
a tetracycline regulated fashion. GnTIII is required for the synthesis of bisected<br>
oligosaccharides, which are found at low to intermediate levels in naturally-<br>
occurring human antibodies but are missing in mAbs produced in standard<br>
industrial cell lines. The new glycosylated versions outperformed Mabthera™<br>
(the version of Rixtuximab marketed in Europe) and mouse-myeloma derived<br>
chG250 in biological (ADCC) activity. For example, a ten-fold lower amount<br>
of the variant carrying the highest levels of bisected oligosaccharides was<br>
required to reach the maximal ADCC activity as Mabthera™. For chG250, the<br>
variant carrying the highest levels of bisected oligosaccharides mediated<br>
significant ADCC activity at a 125-fold lower concentration than that required<br>
to detect even low ADCC activity by the unmodified control chG250. A clear<br>
correlation was found between the level of GnTIII expression and ADCC<br>
activity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0036] Terms are used herein as generally used in the art, unless otherwise<br>
defined as follows:<br>
[0037] As used herein, the term antibody is intended to include whole antibody<br>
molecules, antibody fragments, or fusion proteins that include aregion equivalent<br>
to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin.<br>
[0038] As used herein, the term region equivalent to the Fc region of an<br>
immunoglobulin is intended to include naturally occurring allelic variants of the<br>
Fc region of an immunoglobulin as well as variants having alterations which<br>
produce substitutions, additions, or deletions but which do not decrease<br>
substantially the ability of the immunoglobulin to mediate antibody dependent<br>
cellular cytotoxicity. For example, one or more amino acids can be deleted from<br>
the N-terminus or C-terminus of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin without<br>
substantial loss of biological function. Such variants can be selected according<br>
to general rules known in the art so as to have minimal effect on activity. {See,<br>
e.g., Bowie, J. U. et al., Science 247:1306-10 (1990).<br>
[0039] As used herein, the term glycoprotein-modijying glycosyl transferase<br>
refers to b(l,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase in (GnTIII).<br>
[0040] As used herein, the terms engineer, engineered, engineering and<br>
glycosylation engineering are considered to include any manipulation of the<br>
glycosylation pattern of a naturally occurring polypeptide or fragment thereof.<br>
Glycosylation engineering includes metabolic engineering of the glycosylation<br>
machinery of a cell, including genetic manipulations of the oligosaccharide<br>
synthesis pathways to achieve altered glycosylation of glycoproteins expressed<br>
in cells. Furthermore, glycosylation engineering includes the effects of mutations<br>
and cellenvironment on glycosylation.<br>
[0041] As used herein, the term host cell covers any kind of cellular system<br>
which can be engineered to generate modified glycoforms of proteins, protein<br>
fragments, or peptides of interest, including antibodies and antibody fragments.<br>
Typically, the host cells have been manipulated to express optimized levels of<br>
GnT in. Host cells include cultured cells, e.g., mammalian cultured cells, such<br>
as CHO cells, BHK cells, NSO cells, SP2/0 cells, YO myeloma cells, P3X63<br>
mouse myeloma cells, PER cells, PER.C6 cells or hybridoma cells, yeast cells,<br>
and insect cells, to name only a few, but also cells comprised within a trans genie<br>
animal or cultured tissue.<br>
[0042] As used herein, the term Fc-mediated cellular cytotoxicity includes<br>
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and cellular cytotoxicity mediated by<br>
a soluble Fc-fusion protein containing a human Fc-region. It is an immune<br>
mechanism leading to the lysis of "antibody-targeted cells" by "human immune<br>
effector cells", wherein:<br>
The "human immune effector cells" are a population of leukocytes that<br>
display Fc receptors on their surface through which they bind to the Fc-<br>
region of antibodies or of Fc-fusion proteins and perform effector<br>
functions. Such a population may include, but is not limited to,<br>
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and/or natural killer (NK)<br>
cells.<br>
The "antibody-targeted cells" are cells bound by the antibodies or Fc-<br>
fusion proteins. The antibodies or Fc fusion-proteins bind to target cells<br>
via the protein part N-terminal to the Fc region.<br>
[0043] As used herein, the term increased Fc-mediated cellular cytotoxicity is<br>
defined as either an increase in the number of "antibody-targeted cells" that are<br>
lysed in a given time, at a given concentration of antibody, or of Fc-fusion<br>
protein, in the medium surrounding the target cells, by the mechanism of Fc-<br>
mediated cellular cytotoxicity defined above, and/or a reduction in the<br>
concentration of antibody, or of Fc-fusion protein, in the medium surrounding<br>
the target cells, required to achieve the lysis of a given number of "antibody-<br>
targeted cells", in a given time, by the mechanism of Fc -mediated cellular<br>
cytotoxicity. The increase in Fc-mediated cellular cytotoxicity is relative to the<br>
cellular cytotoxicity mediated by the same antibody, or Fc-fusion protein,<br>
produced by the same type of host cells, using the same standard production,<br>
purification, formulation and storage methods, which are known to those skilled<br>
in the art, but that has not been produced by host cells engineered to express the<br>
glycosyltransferase GnTin by the methods described herein.<br>
[0044] By antibody having increased antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity<br>
(ADCC) is meant an antibody having increased ADCC as determined by any<br>
suitable method known to those of ordinary skill in the art. One accepted in vitro<br>
ADCC assay is as follows:<br>
1) the assay uses target cells that are known to express the target<br>
antigen recognized by the antigen-binding region of the antibody;<br>
2) the assay uses human peripheral blood mononuclear cells<br>
(PBMCs), isolated from blood of a randomly chosen healthy donor, as effector<br>
cells;<br>
3) the assay is carried out according to following protocol:<br>
i) the PBMCs are isolated using standard density<br>
centrifiigation procedures and are suspended at 5 x 106 cells/ml in RPMI cell<br>
culture medium;<br>
ii) the target cells are grown by standard tissue culture<br>
methods, harvested from the exponential growth phase with a viability higher<br>
than 90%, washed in RPMI cell culture medium, labelled with 100 micro-Curies<br>
of 51Cr, washed twice with cell culture medium, and resuspended in cell culture<br>
medium at a density of 105 cells/ml;<br>
iii) 100 microliters of the final target cell suspension above are<br>
transferred to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate;<br>
iv) the antibody is serially-diluted from 4000 ng/ml to 0.04<br>
ng/ml in cell culture medium and 50 microliters of the resulting antibody<br>
solutions are added to the target cells in the 96-well microtiter plate, testing in<br>
triplicate various antibody concentrations covering the whole concentration range<br>
above;<br>
v) forthemaximumrelease(MR) controls, 3 additional wells<br>
in the plate containing the labelled target cells, receive 50 microliters of a 2%<br>
(V/V) aqueous solution of non-ionic detergent (Nonidet, Sigma, St. Louis),<br>
instead of the antibody solution (point iv above);<br>
vi) for the spontaneous release (SR) controls, 3 additional<br>
wells in the plate containing the labelled target cells, receive 50 microliters of<br>
RPMI cell culture medium instead of the antibody solution (point iv above);<br>
vii) the 96-well microtiter plate is then centrifuged at 50 x g<br>
for 1 minute and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C;<br>
viii) 50 microliters of the PBMC suspension (point i above) are<br>
added to each well to yield an effector target cell ratio of 25:1 and the plates are<br>
placed in an incubator under 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C for 4 hours;<br>
ix) the cell-free supernatant from each well is harvested and<br>
the experimentally released radioactivity (ER) is quantified using a gamma<br>
counter;<br>
x) the percentage of specific lysis is calculated for each<br>
antibody concentration according to the formula (ER-MR)/(MR-SR) x 100,<br>
where ER is the average radioactivity quantified (see point ix above) for that<br>
antibody concentration, MR is the average radioactivity quantified (see point ix<br>
above) for the MR controls (see point v above), and SR is the average<br>
radioactivity quantified (see point ix above) for the SR controls (see point vi<br>
above);<br>
4) "increased ADCC" is defined as either an increase in the<br>
maximum percentage of specific lysis observed within the antibody concentration<br>
range tested above, and/or a reduction in the concentration of antibody required<br>
to achieve one half of the maximum percentage of specific lysis observed within<br>
the antibody concentration range tested above. The increase in ADCC is relative<br>
to the ADCC, measured with the above assay, mediated by the same antibody,<br>
produced by the same type of host cells, using the same standard production,<br>
purification, formulation and storage methods, which are known to those skilled<br>
in the art, but that has not been produced by host cells engineered to overexpress<br>
the glycosyltransferase GnTIIL<br>
[0045] As used herein, the term anti-CD20 antibody is intended to mean an<br>
antibody which specifically recognizes a cell surface non-glycosylated<br>
phosphoprotein of 35,000 Daltons, typically designated as the human B<br>
lymphocyte restricted differentiation antigen Bp35, commonly referred to as<br>
CD20.<br>
Identification and Generation of Nucleic Acids Encoding A Protein for Which<br>
Modification of The Glycosylation Pattern Is Desired<br>
[0046] The present invention provides methods for the generation and use of host<br>
cell systems for the production of glycoforms of antibodies or antibody<br>
fragments or fusion proteins which include antibody fragments with increased<br>
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Identification of target epitopes and<br>
generation of antibodies having potential therapeutic value, for which<br>
modification of the glycosylation pattern is desired, and isolation of their<br>
respective coding nucleic acid sequence is within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0047] Various procedures known in the art may be used for the production of<br>
antibodies to target epitopes of interest. Such antibodies include but are not<br>
limited to polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, single chain, Fab fragments and<br>
fragments produced by an Fab expression library. Such antibodies may be<br>
useful, e.g., as diagnostic or therapeutic agents. As therapeutic: agents,<br>
neutralizing antibodies, i.e., those which compete for binding with a ligand,<br>
substrate or adapter molecule, are of especially preferred interest<br>
[0048] For the production of antibodies, various host animals are immunized by<br>
injection with the target protein of interest including, but not limited to, rabbits,<br>
mice, rats, etc. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological<br>
response, depending on the host species, including but not limited to Freund's<br>
(complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface<br>
active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides,<br>
saponin, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, dinitrophenol, and<br>
potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and<br>
Corynebacteriwn parvum.<br>
[0049] Monoclonal antibodies to the target of interest may be prepared using any<br>
technique which provides for the production of antibody molecules by<br>
continuous cell lines in culture. These include, but are not limited to, the<br>
hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature<br>
256:495-97 (1975), the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kosbor et al,<br>
Immunology Today 4:72 (1983); Cote et ah, Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.<br>
80:2026-30 (1983 ) and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al, Monoclonal<br>
Antibodies and Cancer Therapy 77-96 (Alan R. Liss, Inc., 1985)). hi addition,<br>
techniques developed for the production of "chimeric antibodies" (Morrison et<br>
al,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81:6851-55 (1984); Neuberger et al, Nature<br>
312:604-08 (1984) ; Takeda et al, Nature 314:452-54 (1985) by splicing the<br>
genes from amouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together<br>
with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity<br>
can be used. Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single<br>
chain antibodies (U.S. Patent No. 4,946,778) can be adapted to produce single<br>
chain antibodies having a desired specificity.<br>
[0050] Antibody fragments which contain specific binding sites of the target<br>
protein of interest may be generated by known techniques For example, such<br>
fragments include, but are not limited to, F(ab')2 fragments which can be<br>
produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the Fab fragments'<br>
which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab')2<br>
fragments. Alternatively, Fab expression libraries may be constructed (Huse et<br>
al., Science 246:1275-81 (1989) to allow rapid and easy identification of<br>
monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity to the target protein of<br>
interest.<br>
[0051] Once an antibody or antibody fragment has been identified for which<br>
modification in the glycosylation pattern are desired, the coding nucleic acid<br>
sequence is identified and isolated using techniques well known in the art.<br>
a. Generation Of Cell Lines For The Production Of Proteins With<br>
Altered Glycosylation Pattern<br>
[0052] The present invention provides host cell expression systems for the<br>
generation of proteins having modified glycosylation patterns. In particular, the<br>
present invention provides host cell systems for the generation of glycoforms of<br>
proteins having an improved therapeutic value. Therefore, the invention<br>
provides host cell expression systems selected or engineered to increase the<br>
expression of a glycoprotein-modifying glycosyltransferase, namely |3(1,4)-N-<br>
acetylglucosaminyltransferase HI (GnTIII). Specifically, such host cell<br>
expression systems may be engineered to comprise a recombinant nucleic acid<br>
molecule encoding GnTIII, operatively linked to a constitutive or regulated<br>
promoter system. Alternatively, host cell expression systems may be employed<br>
that naturally produce, are induced to produce, and/or are selected to produce<br>
GnTIII.<br>
[0053] In one specific embodiment, the present invention provides a host cell<br>
that has been engineered to express at least one nucleic acid encoding GnTIII.<br>
In one aspect, the host cell is transformed or transfected with a nucleic acid<br>
molecule comprising at least one gene encoding GnTIII. In an alternate aspect,<br>
the host cell has been engineered and/or selected in such way that endogenous<br>
GnTIII is activated. For example, the host cell may be selected to cany a<br>
mutation triggering expression of endogenous GnTIII. In one specific<br>
embodiment, the host cell is a CHO lec1O mutant Alternatively, the host cell<br>
may be engineered such that endogenous GnTIII is activated. In again another<br>
alternative, the host cell is engineered such that endogenous GnTIII has been<br>
activated by insertion of a constitutive promoter element, a transposon, or a<br>
retroviral element into the host cell chromosome.<br>
[0054] Generally, any type of cultured cell line can be used as a background to<br>
engineer the host cell lines of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
CHO cells, BHK cells, NSO cells, SP2/0 cells, YO myeloma cells, P3X63 mouse<br>
myeloma cells, PER cells, PER.C6 cells or hybridoma cells, yeast cells, or insect<br>
cells are used as the background cell line to generate the engineered host cells of<br>
the invention.<br>
[0055] The invention is contemplated to encompass any engineered host cells<br>
expressing GnTIII as defined herein:<br>
[0056] One or several nucleic acids encoding GnTIII may be expressed under<br>
the control of a constitutive promoter or, alternately, a regulated expression<br>
system. Suitable regulated expression systems include, but are not limited to, a<br>
tetracycline-regulated expression system, an ecdysone-inducible expression<br>
system, a lac-switch expression system, a glucocorticoid-inducible expression<br>
system, a temperature-inducible promoter system, and a metallothionein metal-<br>
inducible expression system. If several different nucleic acids encoding GnTIII<br>
are comprised within the host cell system, some of them may be expressed under<br>
the control of a constitutive promoter, while others are expressed under the<br>
control of a regulated promoter. The maximal expression level is considered to<br>
be the highest possible level of stable GnTIII expression that does not have a<br>
significant adverse effect on cell growth rate, and will be determined using<br>
routine experimentation. Expression levels are determined by methods generally<br>
known in the art, including Western blot analysis using a GnTIII specific<br>
antibody, Northern blot analysis using a GnTIII specific nucleic acid probe, or<br>
measurement of enzymatic activity. Alternatively, a lectin may be employed<br>
which binds to biosynthetic products of the GnTIII, for example, E4-PHA lectin.<br>
In a further alternative, the nucleic acid may be operatively linked to a reporter<br>
gene; the expression levels of the GnTIII are determined by measuring a signal<br>
correlated with the expression level of the reporter gene. The reporter gene may<br>
transcribed together with the nucleic acid(s) encoding said GnTIII as a single<br>
mRNA molecule; their respective coding sequences may be linked either by an<br>
internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or by a cap-independent translation enhancer<br>
(CITE). The reporter gene may be translated together with at least one nucleic<br>
acid encoding said GnTIII such that a single polypeptide chain is formed. The<br>
nucleic acid encoding the GnTIII may be operatively linked to the reporter gene<br>
under the control of a single promoter, such that the nucleic acid encoding the<br>
GnTIII and the reporter gene are transcribed into an RNA molecule which is<br>
alternatively spliced into two separate messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules; one<br>
of the resulting mRNAs is translated into said reporter protein, and the other is<br>
translated into said GnTIII.<br>
[0057] If several different nucleic acids encoding GnTIII are expressed, they<br>
may be arranged in such way that they are transcribed as one or as several mRNA<br>
molecules. If they are transcribed as a single mRNA molecule, their respective<br>
coding sequences may be linked either by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)<br>
or by a cap-independent translation enhancer (CITE). They may be transcribed<br>
from a single promoter into an RNA molecule which is alternatively spliced into<br>
several separate messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, which then are each<br>
translated into their respective encoded GnTIII.<br>
[0058] In other embodiments, the present invention provides host cell expression<br>
systems for the generation of therapeutic antibodies, having an increased<br>
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and cells which display the IgG Fc<br>
region on the surface to promote Fc-mediated cytotoxicity. Generally, the host<br>
cell expression systems have been engineered and/or selected to express nucleic<br>
acids encoding the antibody for which the production of altered glycoforms is<br>
desired, along with at least one nucleic acid encoding GnTIII. In one<br>
embodiment, the host cell system is transfected with at least one gene encoding<br>
GnTm. Typically, the transfected cells are selected to identify and isolate clones<br>
that stably express the GnTIIL In another embodiment, the host cell has been<br>
selected for expression of endogenous GnTIII. For example, cells may be<br>
selected carrying mutations which trigger expression of otherwise silent GnTIII.<br>
For example, CHO cells are known to carry a silent GnT in gene that is active<br>
in certain mutants, e.g., in the mutant LeclO. Furthermore, methods known in<br>
the art may be used to activate silent GnTIII, including the insertion of a<br>
regulated or constitutive promoter, the use of transposons, retroviral elements,<br>
etc. Also the use of gene knockout technologies or the use of ribozyme methods<br>
may be used to tailor the host cell's GnTIII expression level, and is therefore<br>
within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0059] Any type of cultured cell line can be used as background to engineer the<br>
host cell lines of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, CHO cells,<br>
BHK cells, NSO cells, SP2/0 cells, YO myeloma cells, P3X63 mouse myeloma<br>
cells, PER cells, PER.C6 cells or hybridoma cells, yeast cell, or insect cells may<br>
be used. Typically, such cell lines are engineered to further comprise at least one<br>
transfected nucleic acid encoding a whole antibody molecule, an antibody<br>
fragment, or a fusion protein that includes a region equivalent to the Fc region<br>
of an immunoglobulin. In an alternative embodiment, a hybridoma cell line<br>
expressing a particular antibody of interest is used as background cell line to<br>
generate the engineered host cells of the invention.<br>
[0060] Typically, at least one nucleic acid in the host cell system encodes<br>
GnT III.<br>
[0061] One or several nucleic acids encoding GnTIIImay be expressed under the<br>
control of a constitutive promoter, or alternately, a regulated expression system.<br>
Suitable regulated expression systems include, but are not limited to, a<br>
tetracycline-regulated expression system, an ecdysone-inducible expression<br>
system, a lac-switch expression system, a glucocorticoid-inducible expression<br>
system, a temperature-inducible promoter system, and ametallothionein metal-<br>
inducible expression system. If several different nucleic acids encoding GnTIII<br>
are comprised within the host cell system, some of them may be expressed under<br>
the control of a constitutive promoter, while others are expressed under the<br>
control of a regulated promoter. The maximal expression level is considered to<br>
be the highest possible level of stable GnTIII expression that does not have a<br>
significant adverse effect on cell growth rate, and will be determined using<br>
routine experimentation. Expression levels are determined by methods generally<br>
known in the art, including Western blot analysis using a GnTIII specific<br>
antibody, Northern blot analysis using a GnTIII specific nucleic acid ptrobe, or<br>
measurement of GnTIII enzymatic activity. .Alternatively, a lectin may be<br>
employed which binds to biosynthetic products of GnTIII, for example, E4-PHA<br>
lectin. In a further alternative, the nucleic acid may be operatively linked to a<br>
reporter gene; the expression levels of the glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl<br>
transferase are determined by measuring a signal correlated with the expression<br>
level of the reporter gene. The reporter gene may transcribed together with the<br>
nucleic acid(s) encoding said glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl transferase as a<br>
single mRNA molecule; their respective coding sequences may be linked either<br>
by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or by a cap-independent translation<br>
enhancer (CITE). The reporter gene may be translated together with at least one<br>
nucleic acid encoding GnTIII such that a single polypeptide chain is formed.<br>
The nucleic acid encoding the GnTIII may be operatively linked to the reporter<br>
gene under the control of a single promoter, such that the nucleic acid encoding<br>
the GnTIII and the reporter gene are transcribed into an RNA molecule which is<br>
alternatively spliced into two separate messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules; one<br>
of the resulting mRNAs is translated into said reporter protein, and the other is<br>
translated into said GnTIII.<br>
[0062] If several different nucleic acids encoding a GnTEH are expressed, they<br>
may be arranged in such way that they are transcribed as one or as several mRNA<br>
molecules. If they are transcribed as single mRNA molecule, their respective<br>
coding sequences may be linked either by an internal ribosome entry site (ERES)<br>
or by a cap-independent translation enhancer (CITE). They may be transcribed<br>
from a single promoter into an RNA molecule which is alternatively spliced into<br>
several separate messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, which then are each<br>
translated into their respective encoded GnTIII.<br>
Expression Systems<br>
[0063] Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to<br>
construct expression vectors containing the coding sequence of the protein of<br>
interest and the coding sequence of the GnTIII and appropriate<br>
transcriptional/translational control signals. These methods include in vitro<br>
recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques and in vivo<br>
recombmation/geneticrecombination. See, for example, thetechniques described<br>
in Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory, N.Y. (1989) and Ausubel et al, Current Protocols in Molecular<br>
Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, N.Y (1989).<br>
[0064] . A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the<br>
coding sequence of the protein of interest and the coding sequence of the GnTIII.<br>
Preferably, mammalian cells are used as host cell systems transfected with<br>
recombinant plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing the<br>
coding sequence of the protein of interest and the coding sequence of the GnTIII.<br>
Most preferably, CHO cells, BHK cells, NS0 cells, SP2/0 cells, YO myeloma<br>
cells, P3X63 mouse myeloma cells, PER cells, PER.C6 cells or hybridoma cells,<br>
yeast cells, or insect cells are used as host cell system. In alternate embodiments,<br>
other eukaryotic host cell systems may be contemplated, including, yeast cells<br>
transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing the coding<br>
sequence of the protein of interest and the coding sequence of the GnTIII; insect<br>
cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g.,<br>
baculovirus) containing the coding sequence of the protein of interest and the<br>
coding sequence of the GnTIII; plant cell systems infected with recombinant<br>
virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic<br>
virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g.,<br>
Ti plasmid) containing the coding sequence of the protein of interest and the<br>
coding sequence of the GnTIII; or animal cell systems infected with recombinant<br>
virus expression vectors (e.g., adenovirus, vaccinia virus) including cell lines<br>
engineered to contain multiple copies of theDNA encoding the protein of interest<br>
and the coding sequence of the GnTDI either stably amplified (CHO/dhfr) or<br>
unstably amplified in double-minute chromosomes (e.g., murine cell lines).<br>
[0065] For the methods of this invention, stable expression is generally preferred<br>
to transient expression because it typically achieves more reproducible results<br>
and also is more amenable to large scale production. Rather than using<br>
expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be<br>
transformed with the respective coding nucleic acids controlled by appropriate<br>
expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription<br>
terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.); and a selectable marker. Following the<br>
introduction of foreign DNA, engineered cells maybe allowed to grow for 1-2<br>
days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media The<br>
selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection<br>
and allows selection of cells which have stably integrated the plasmid into their<br>
chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded<br>
into cell lines.<br>
[0066] A number of selection systems may be used, including, but not limited to,<br>
the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., Cell 11:223 (1977)),<br>
hypoxanthine-guaninephosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska&amp; Szybalski, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:2026 (1962)), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase<br>
(Lowy et al, Cell 22:817 (1980)) genes, which can be employed in tk", hgprt" or<br>
aprt' cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis<br>

ii. Identification Of Transfectants Or Transformants That<br>
Express The Protein Having A Modified Glycosylation<br>
Pattern<br>
[0067] The host cells which contain the coding sequence and which express the<br>
biologically active gene products may be identified by at least four general<br>
approaches; (a) DNA-DNA or DNA-KNA hybridization; (b) the presence or<br>
absence of "marker" gene functions; (c) assessing the level of transcription as<br>
measured by the expression of the respective mKNA transcripts in the host cell;<br>
and (d) detection of the gene product as measured by immunoassay or by its<br>
biological activity.<br>
[0068] In the first approach, the presence of the coding sequence of the protein<br>
of interest and the coding sequence of the GnTIII inserted in the expression<br>
vector can be detected by DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization using probes<br>
comprising nucleotide sequences that are homologous to the respective coding<br>
sequences, respectively, or portions or derivatives thereof<br>
[0069] In the second approach, the recombinant expression vector/host system<br>
can be identified and selected based upon the presence or absence of certain<br>
"marker" gene functions (e.g., thymidine kinase activity, resistance to antibiotics,<br>
resistance to methotrexate, transformation phenotype, occlusion body formation<br>
in baculovirus, etc.). For example, if the coding sequence of the protein of<br>
interest and the coding sequence of the GnTIII are inserted within a marker gene<br>
sequence of the vector, recombinants containing the respective coding sequences<br>
can be identified by the absence of the marker gene function. Alternatively, a<br>
marker gene can be placed in tandem with the coding sequences under the control<br>
of the same or different promoter used to control the expression of the coding<br>
sequences. Expression of the marker in response to induction or selection<br>
indicates expression of the coding sequence of the protein of interest and the<br>
coding sequence of the GnTIII.<br>
[0070] In the third approach, transcripuonal activity for the coding region of the<br>
protein of interest and the coding sequence of the GnTIII can be assessed by<br>
hybridization assays. For example, RNA can be isolated and analyzed by<br>
Northern blot using a probe homologous to the coding sequences of the protein<br>
of interest and the coding sequence of the GnTIII or particular portions thereof.<br>
Alternatively, total nucleic acids of the host cell may be extracted and assayed<br>
for hybridization to such probes.<br>
[0071] In the fourth approach, the expression of the protein products of the<br>
protein of interest and the coding sequence of the GnTIII can be assessed<br>
immunologically, for example by Western blots, immunoassays such as<br>
radioimmuno-precipitation, enzyme-linked immunoassays and the like. The<br>
ultimate test of the success of the expression system, however, involves the<br>
detection of the biologically active gene products.<br>
b. Generation And Use Of Proteins And Protein Fragments Having<br>
Altered Glycosylation Patterns<br>
i. Generation And Use Of Antibodies Having Increased<br>
Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity<br>
[0072] In preferred embodiments, the present invention provides glycoforms of<br>
antibodies and antibody fragments having increased antibody-dependent cellular<br>
cytotoxicity.<br>
[0073] Clinical trials of unconjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the<br>
treatment of some types of cancer have recently yielded encouraging results.<br>
Dillman, Cancer Biother. &amp; Radiopharm. 12:223-25 (1997); Deo et al,<br>
Immunology Today 18:127 (1997). A chimeric, unconjugated IgGl has been<br>
approved for low-grade or follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dillman,<br>
Cancer Biother. &amp; Radiopharm. 12:223-25 (1997), while another unconjugated<br>
mAb, a humanized IgGl targeting solid breast tumors, has also been showing<br>
promising results in phase III clinical trials. Deo et al., Immunology Today<br>
18:127 (1997). The antigens of these two mAbs are highly expressed in their<br>
respective tumor cells and the antibodies mediate potent tumor destruction by<br>
effector cells in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, many other unconjugated mAbs<br>
with fine tumor specificities cannot trigger effector functions of sufficient<br>
potency to be clinically useful. Frost et al, Cancer 50:317-33 (1997); Surfus et<br>
al.,J. Immunother. 7.9:184-91 (1996). For some of these weaker mAbs, adjunct<br>
cytokine therapy is currently being tested. Addition of cytokines can stimulate<br>
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by increasing the activity and<br>
number of circulating lymphocytes. Frost et al., Cancer 80:317-33 (1997);<br>
Surfus et al., J. Immunother. 19:184-91 (1996). ADCC, a lytic attack on<br>
antibody-targeted cells, is triggered upon binding of leukocyte receptors to the<br>
constant region (Fc) of antibodies. Deo et al., Immunology Today 18:127 (1997).<br>
[0074] A different, but complementary, approach to increase ADCC activity of<br>
unconjugated IgGls is to engineer the Fc region of the antibody to increase its<br>
affinity for the lymphocyte receptors (FcyRs). Protein engineering studies have<br>
shown that FcyRs interact with the lower hinge region of the IgG CH2 domain.<br>
Lund et al, J. Immunol. 157:4963-69 (1996). However, FcyR binding also<br>
requires the presence of oligosaccharides covalently attached at the conserved<br>
Asn 297 in the CH2 region. Lund et al, J. Immunol. 157:4963-69 (1996);<br>
Wright and Morrison, Trends Biotech. 15:26-31 (1997), suggesting that either<br>
oligosaccharide andpolypeptide both directly contribute to the interaction site or<br>
that the oligosaccharide is required to maintain an active CH2 polypeptide<br>
conformation. Modification of the oligosaccharide structure can therefore be<br>
explored as a means to increase the affinity of the interaction.<br>
[0075] An IgG molecule carries two N-linked oligosaccharides in its Fc region,<br>
one on each heavy chain. As any glycoprotein, an antibody is produced as a<br>
population of glycoforms which share the same polypeptide backbone but have<br>
different oligosaccharides attached to the glycosylation sites. The<br>
oligosaccharides normally found in the Fc region of serum IgG are of complex<br>
bi-antennary type (Wormald et al, Biochemistry 36:130-38 (1997), with low<br>
level of terminal sialic acid and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and<br>
a variable degree of terminal galactdsy lation and core fucosylation. S ome studies<br>
suggest that the minimal carbohydrate structure required for FcyR binding lies<br>
within the oligosaccharide core. Lund et al., J. Immunol. 157:4963-69 (1996)<br>
The removal of terminal galactoses results in approximately a two-fold reduction<br>
in ADCC activity, indicating a role for these residues in FcyR receptor binding.<br>
Lund et al., J. Immunol. 157:4963-69 (1996)<br>
[0076] The mouse- or hamster-derived cell lines used in industry and academia<br>
for production of unconjugated therapeutic mAbs normally attach the required<br>
oligosaccharide determinants to Fc sites. IgGs expressed in these cell lines lack,<br>
however, the bisecting GlcNAc found in low amounts in serum IgGs. Lifely et<br>
al, Glycobiology 375:813-22 (1995). In contrast, it was recently observed that<br>
a rat myeloma-produced, humanized IgGl (CAMPATH-1H) carried a bisecting<br>
GlcNAc in some of its glycoforms. Lifely et al, Glycobiology 375:813-22<br>
(1995). The rat cell-derived antibody reached a similar in vitro ADCC activity<br>
as CAMPATH-1H antibodies produced in standard cell lines, but at significantly<br>
lower antibody concentrations.<br>
[0077] The CAMPATH antigen is normally present at high levels on lymphoma<br>
cells, and this chimeric mAb has high ADCC activity in the absence of a<br>
bisecting GlcNAc. Lifely et al, Glycobiology 375:813-22 (1995). In the N-<br>
linked glycosylation pathway, a bisecting GlcNAc is added by the enzyme<br>
P(l,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferasein(GnTIII). Schachter, Biochem. Cell<br>
Biol 64:163-81 (1986).<br>
[0078] The present inventors used a single antibody-producing CHO cell line,<br>
that was previously engineered to express, in an externally-regulated fashion,<br>
different levels of a cloned GnT III gene. This approach established for the first<br>
time arigorous correlation between expression of GnTIII and the ADCC activity<br>
of the modified antibody.<br>
[0079] The present inventors previously showed that C2B8 antibody modified<br>
according to the disclosed method had an about sixteen-fold higher ADCC<br>
activity than the standard, unmodified C2B8 antibody produced under identical<br>
cell culture and purification conditions. Briefly, a C2B8 antibody sample<br>
expressed in CHO-tTA-C2B8 cells that do not have GnT III expression showed,<br>
a cytotoxic activity of about 31% (at 1 ug/ml antibody concentration), measured<br>
as in vitro lysis of SB cells (CD20+) by human lymphocytes. In contrast, C2B8<br>
antibody derived from a CHO cell culture expressing GnT in at a basal, largely<br>
repressed level showed at lmg/ml antibody concentration a 33% increase in<br>
ADCC activity against the control atthe same antibody concentration. Moreover,<br>
increasing the expression of GnT in produced a large increase of almost 80% in<br>
the maximal ADCC activity (at 1 mg/ml antibody concentration) compared to the<br>
control at the same antibody concentration. {See International Publication No.<br>
WO 99/54342, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by<br>

Conjugate, Immunex) produced by the methods of the invention. In addition,<br>
the invention is directed to antibody fragment and fusion proteins comprising a<br>
region that is equivalent to the Fc region of immunoglobulins.<br>
ii. Generation And Use Of Fusion Proteins Comprising A<br>
Region Equivalent To An Fc Region Of An<br>
Immunoglobulin That Promote Fc-Mediated Cytotoxicity<br>
[0081] As discussed above, the present invention relates to a method for<br>
increasing the ADCC activity of therapeutic antibodies. This is achieved by<br>
engineering the glycosylation pattern of the Fc region of such antibodies, in<br>
particular by maximizing the proportion of antibody molecules carrying bisected<br>
complex oligosaccharides and bisected hybrid oligosaccharides N-linked to the<br>
conserved glycosylation sites in their Fc regions. This strategy can be applied to<br>
increase Fc-mediated cellular cytotoxicity against undesirable cells mediated by<br>
any molecule carrying a region that is an equivalent to the Fc region of an<br>
immunoglobulin, not only by therapeutic antibodies, since the changes<br>
introduced by the engineering of glycosylation affect only the Fc region and<br>
therefore its interactions with the Fc receptors on the surface of effector cells<br>
involved in the ADCC mechanism. Fc-containing molecules to which the<br>
presently disclosed methods can be applied include, but are not limited to, (a)<br>
soluble fusion proteins made of a targeting protein domain fused to the N-<br>
terminus of an Fc-region(Chamov and Ashkenazi, Trends Biotech. 14: 52(1996)<br>
and (b) plasma membrane-anchored fusion proteins made of a type II<br>
transmembrane domain that localizes to the plasma membrane fused to the N-<br>
terminus of an Fc region (Stabila, P.F., Nature Biotech. 16: 1357 (1998)).<br>
[0082] In the case of soluble fusion proteins (a) the targeting domain directs<br>
binding of the fusion protein to undesirable cells such as cancer cells, i. e., in an<br>
analogous fashion to therapeutic antibodies. The application of presently<br>
disclosedmethodto enhance the Fc-mediated cellular cytotoxic activity mediated<br>
by these molecules would therefore be identical to the method applied to<br>
therapeutic antibodies.<br>
[0083] In the case of membrane-anchored fusion proteins (b) the undesirable<br>
cells in the body have to express the gene encoding the fusion protein. This can<br>
be achieved either by gene therapy approaches, i.e., by transfecting the cells in<br>
vivo with a plasmid or viral vector that directs expression of the fusion protein-<br>
encoding gene to undesirable cells, or by implantation in the body of cells<br>
genetically engineered to express the fusion protein on their surface. The later<br>
cells would normally be implanted in the body inside a polymer capsule<br>
(encapsulated cell therapy) where they cannot be destroyed by an Fc-mediated<br>
cellular cytotoxicity mechanism. However should the caps ule device fail and the<br>
escaping cells become undesirable, then they can be eliminated by Fc-mediated<br>
cellular cytotoxicity. Stabila et al, Nature Biotech. 16: 1357 (1998). In this<br>
case, the presently disclosed method would be applied either by incorporating<br>
into the gene therapy vector an additional gene expression cassette directing<br>
adequate or maximal expression levels of GnT in or by engineering the cells to<br>
be implanted to express adequate or maximal levels of GnT HI. In both cases,<br>
the aim of the disclosed method is to increase or maximize the proportion of<br>
surf ace-displayed Fc regions carrying bisected complex oligosaccharides and/or<br>
bisected hybrid oligosaccharides.<br>
[0084] The examples below explain the invention in more detail. The following<br>
preparations and examples are given to enable those skilled in the art to more<br>
clearly understand and to practice the present invention. The present invention,<br>
however, is not limited in scope by the exemplified embodiments, which are<br>
intended as illustrations of single aspects of the invention only, and methods<br>
which are functionally equivalent are within the scope of the invention. Indeed,<br>
various modifications of the invention in addition to those described herein will<br>
become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and<br>
accompanying drawings. Such modifications are intended to fall within the<br>
scope of the appended claims.<br>

Producing Cell Line<br>
[0085] Synthesis of VH and VL coding regions of IDEC-C2B8 and construction<br>
of mammalian expression vectors. cDNAs encoding the VH and VL regions of<br>
IDEC-C2B8 antibody were assembled from a set of overlapping single-stranded<br>
oligonucleotides in a one-step process using PCR (Kobayashi, N., et al.,<br>
Biotechniques 23:500-503 (1997)). The original sequence data coding for IDEC-<br>
C2B8 VL and VH were obtained from a published international patent<br>
application (International Publication Number: WO 94/11026). Assembled VL<br>
and VH cDNA fragments were subcloned into pBluescriptIIKS(+), sequenced<br>
and directly joined by ligation to the human constant light (Ig k) and heavy (IgGl)<br>
chain cDNAs, respectively, using unique restriction sites introduced at the<br>
variable and constant region junctions without altering the original amiino acid<br>
residue sequence (Umana, P., et al, Nat Biotechnol. 77:176-180 (1999); Reff,<br>
M. E., et al, Blood 53:435-445 (1994)). Each full-length cDNA was separately<br>
subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) yielding<br>
mammalian expression vectors for chimeric C2B8 light (pC2B8L) and heavy<br>
(pC2B8H) chains.<br>
[0086] Production of IDEC-C2B8 in CHO cells expressing different levels of<br>
GnTIII. Establishment of two CHO cell lines, CHO-tet-GnTIII expressing<br>
different levels of GnTIII depending on the tetracycline concentration in the<br>
culture medium; and CHO-tTA, the parental cell line that does not express<br>
GnTIII has been described previously (Umana, P., et al., Nat Biotechnol. 17:176-<br>
180 (1999); Umana, P., et al, Biotechnol Bioeng. 65:542-549 (1999)). Each cell<br>
line was cotranfected with vectors pC2B8L, pC2B8H, and pZeoSV2(+) (for<br>
Zeocin resistance; Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) using a calcium phosphate<br>
method. Zeocin resistant clones were transferred to a 96-well plate and assayed<br>
for IDEC-C2B8 production using an ELISA assay specific for the human<br>
constant region (4). Three IDEC-C2B8 samples were obtained from parallel<br>
cultures of a selected clone (CHO-tet-GnTIII-C2B8), differing only in the<br>
tetracycline concentration added to the medium (25, 50 and 2000 ng/mL<br>
respectively). Culture supernatants were harvested in the late exponential phase.<br>
An additional antibody sample was obtained from a CHO-tTA-derived clone,<br>
CHO-tTA-C2B8, cultured under identical conditions but without adding<br>
tetracycline to the medium. Antibody samples were purified from culture<br>
medium by protein A affinity chromatography and buffer exchanged to PBS on<br>
a cation exchange column as previously described (Umana, P., et al., Nat<br>
Biotechnol. 17:176-180 (1999)). Antibody concentration was measured using a<br>
fluorescence-based kit from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands) with<br>
Rituximab used as standard.<br>
[00871 Indirect immunofluorescence. CD20-positive cells (SB cells; ATCC<br>
depositno. ATCC CCL120) and CD20-negative cells (HSB cells; ATCC deposit<br>
no. ATCC CCL120.1) were each incubated for lh with 2.5 mg/ml of CHO-tet-<br>
GnTIII-derived IDEC-C2B8 antibody in Hank's balanced salt solution<br>
(GibcoBRL, Basel, Switzerland) and 2% bovine serum albumin fraction V<br>
(Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) (HBSSB). As a negative control<br>
HBSSB was used instead of C2B8 antibody. AFITC-conjugated, anti-humanFc<br>
polyclo'nal antibody was used as a secondary antibody (SIGMA, St. Louis) for<br>
all samples. Cells were examined using a Leica fluorescence microscope<br>
(Wetzlar, Germany).<br>
[0088] Oligosaccharide profiling by MALDI/TOF-MS. Neutral, N-linked<br>
oligosaccharides were derived from C2B8 antibody samples, MabThera™<br>
(European counterpart of Rituximab; kind gift from R Stahel, Universitatspital,<br>
Switzerland), C2B8-25t, C2B8-50t, C2B8-2000t, and C2B8-nt, (100 ug each) as<br>
previously described (Umana, P., et ah, Nat Biotechnol. 17:176-180 (1999)).<br>
Briefly, the antibody samples were first treated with Arthrobacter ureafacierus<br>
sialidase (Oxford Glycosciences, Abingson, UK) to remove any sialic acid<br>
monosaccharide residues. Neutral N-linked oligosaccharides were then released<br>
from the desialylated antibody samples using peptide-N-glycosidase F (Oxford<br>
Glycosciences), purified using micro-columns, and analyzed by MALDI/TOF-<br>
MS in an Elite Voyager 400 spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Farmingham,<br>
MA).<br>
[0089] ADCC Activity Assay. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were<br>
separated from heparinated fresh human blood (in all experiments obtained from<br>
the same healthy donor) by centrifugation over a Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia<br>
Biotech, Dubendorf, Switzerland) gradient. PBMC (effector) were depleted of<br>
monocytes by plastic adherence. CD20-positive SB (target) cells, were labeled<br>
for 90min with lOOuCi 5lCr (Amersham, Dubendorf, Switzerland) at 37 °C,<br>
washed twice in RPMI (GibcoBRL, Basel, Switzerland) and resuspended at a<br>
concentration of 105 cells/ml. Fifty microliters of C2B8 mAb diluted in RPMI<br>
medium was added to 100 ml SB cells (10,000 cells/well) in a 96-well round<br>
bottom microtiter plate (Greiner, Langenthal, Switzerland), centrifuged at 50xg<br>
for lmin, and incubated for 1h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 50 ml of effector cell<br>
(suspended at 2xlO7 cells/ml in RPMI medium) were added to each 96-well<br>
yielding a final E:T ratio of 100. Plates were incubated for 4h at 37 °C and<br>
5%CO2, supernatant was harvested with a Skatron harvesting system (Skatron<br>
Instruments, Sterling, VA) and counted (ER, experimental release) in a Cobra<br>
05005 g counter (Canberra Packard, Meriden, CT). Maximum (MR) and<br>
spontaneous (SR) releases were obtained by adding, instead of C2B8 mAb, 100<br>
ml of 1% Nonidet (Sigma, St. Louis) or lOO ml of RPMI medium, respectively,<br>
to 100 ml labeled target cells. All data points were performed in triplicate.<br>
Specific lysis (%) was calculated with the following formula: (ER-SR.) / (MR-<br>
SR) x 100.<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
[0090] Production of IDEC-C2B8 and verification of specific antigen binding.<br>
CHO-tet-GnTIII cells, with stable, tetracycline-regulated expression of GnTIII<br>
and stable, constitutive expression of IDEC-C2B8, were established and scaled-<br>
up forproduction of aset of antibody samples. During scale-up, parallel cultures<br>
from the same clone were grown under three different tetracycline<br>
concentrations, 25, 50 and 2000 ng/ml. These levels of tetracyciine had<br>
previously been shown to result in different levels of GnTIII and bisected<br>
oligosaccharides (Umana, P., et ah, Nat Biotechnol 17:176-180 (1999); Umana,<br>
P., et ah, Biotechnol Bioeng. 65:542-549 (1999)). A C2B8-producing, control<br>
cell line that does not express GnTIII was also established and cultured under the<br>
same conditions as for the three parallel cultures of CHO-tet-GnTIII After<br>
Protein A-affinity chromatography, mAb purity was estimated to be higher than<br>
95% by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-blue staining. The samples were named<br>
according to the tetracycline concentration added to the culture medium for their<br>
production: C2B8-25t, C2B8-50t, C2B8-2000t and C2B8-nt (i.e., no tetracycline<br>
for the non-bisected control). Sample C2B8-25t showed specific antigen binding<br>
by indirect immunofluorescence using CD20-positive and CD20-negative cells<br>
(FIG. 1), indicating that the synthesized VL and VH gene fragments were<br>
functionally correct.<br>
[00911 Oligosaccharide profiling with MALDI /TOF-MS. The glycosylation<br>
profile of each antibody sample was analyzed by MALDI/TOF-MS of the<br>
released, neutral oligosaccharide mix. In this technique, oligosaccharides of<br>
different mass appear as separate peaks in the spectrum and their proportions are<br>
quantitatively reflected by the relative peak heights (Harvey, D. J., Rapid<br>
Common Mass Spectrom. 7:614-619 (1993); Harvey, D. J., et ah, Glycoconj J.<br>
75:333-338 (1998)). Oligosaccharide structures were assigned to different peaks<br>
based on their expected molecular masses, previous structural data for<br>
oligosaccharides derived from IgGI mAbs produced in the same host, and<br>
information on the N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthetic pathway.<br>
[0092] A clear correlation was found between GnTIII expression levels (i.e.,<br>
tetracycline concentration) and the amount of bisected oligosaccharides derived<br>
from the different antibody samples. As expected, MabThera™ and C2B8-nt,<br>
which are derived from hosts that do not express GnTIII, did not carry bisected<br>
oligosaccharides (FIGS. 2A and 2B). In contrast, bisected structures amounted<br>
up to approximately 35% of the oligosaccharides pool in sample C2B8-2000t, i. e,<br>
at a basal level of GnTIII expression. In this case, the main bisected<br>
oligosaccharide peaks were of complex type, unequivocally assigned to peaks at<br>
m/z 1689 and m/z 1851 (FIG. 2C). The next higher GnTIII expression level,<br>
sample C2B8-50t, led to an increase in these peaks (including their associated<br>
potassium aducts at m/z 1705 and 1861) of around 20%. This increase was<br>
accompanied by a concomitant reduction of their non-bisected counterparts at<br>
m/z 1486 and 1648, respectively (FIG. 2D). At the highest GnTIII expression<br>
level, sample C2B8-25t, the main substrate for GnTIII, m/z 1486, decreased to<br>
almost base-line level, while complex bisected structures (m/z 1689 and 1851)<br>
decreased in favor of increases in peaks at m/z 1664, 1810 and 1826 (FIG. 2E).<br>
These peaks can be assigned either to bisected hybrid compounds, to<br>
galactosylated complex oligosaccharides, or to a mixture of both. Their relative<br>
increase, however, is consistent with the accumulation of bisected hybrid<br>
compounds, as GnTIII overexpression can divert the biosynthetic flux at early<br>
stages of the pathway (see FIG. 3A and 3B). The amount of bisected<br>
oligosaccharide structures (complex and hybrid type) reached approximately<br>
80% for'this sample.<br>
[0093] ADCC activity of lDEC-C2B8 glycosylated variants. Different C2B8<br>
mAb glycosylationvariants were compared for ADCC activity, measured as in<br>
vitro lysis of CD20-positive SB cells. An additional mAb sample, C2B8-nt,<br>
derived from the parental cell line lacking GnTIII, was also studied. Sample<br>
C2B8-2000t produced at the basal GnTIII expression level and carrying low<br>
levels of bisected oligosaccharides was slightly more active than C2B8-nt (FIG.<br>
4A). At the next higher level of GnTIII -expression, sample C2B8-50t carried<br>
approximately equal levels ofbisected andnon-bisected oligosaccharides, but did<br>
hot mediate significantly higher target-cell lysis. However, at the lowest<br>
tetracycline concentration, sample C2B8-25t, which contained up to 80% of<br>
bisected oligosaccharide structures, was significantly more active than the rest<br>
of the samples in the whole antibody concentration range. It reached the<br>
maximal level of ADCC activity of sample C2B8-nt at a 10-fold lower antibody<br>
concentration (FIG. 4A). Sample C2B8-25t also showed a significant increase<br>
in the maximal ADCC activity with respect to the control (50% vs. 30% lysis).<br>
[0094] Samples C2B8-50t and C2B8-25t, bearing the highest proportions of<br>
bisected oligosaccharides, were further compared in ADCC activity to<br>
Mabthera™, the version of Rituxan™ currently marketed in Europe (FIG. 4B).<br>
Sample C2B8-50t showed a slight increase in activity whereas sample C2B8-25t<br>
clearly outperformed Mabthera™ at all antibody concentrations. Approximately<br>
a five to ten-fold lower concentration of C2B8-25t was required to reach the<br>
maximal ADCC activity of Mabthera™, and the maximal activity of C2B8-25t<br>
was about 25% higher than that of Mabthera™.<br>
(0095) These results show that, in general, the in vitro ADCC activity of the<br>
C2B8 antibody correlates with the proportion of molecules carrying bisected<br>
oligosaccharides in the Fc region. We had previously reported that in the case<br>
of chCE7, an antibody with a low baseline level of ADCC activity, significant<br>
increases of activity could be obtained by increasing the fraction of bisected<br>
oligosaccharides above the levels found in naturally-occurring antibodies<br>
(Umana, P., et al, Nat Biotechnol. 17:176-180 (1999)). The same is true for the<br>
C2B8 mAb, which already has high ADCC activity in the absence of bisected<br>
oligosaccharides. In the case of chCE7, however, very large increases of ADCC<br>
activity were observed at a level of GnTIII expression where bisected<br>
oligosaccharides were predominantly of complex type (Umana, P., et al, Nat<br>
Biotechnol. 77:176-180 (1999)). For the potent C2B8 mAb, such a large boost<br>
in activity was only observed at the highest levels of GnTIII expression studied,<br>
where bisected oligosaccharides had shifted mainly to the hybrid type (FIG. 2).<br>
For both mAbs, the samples with the highest activities had considerably higher<br>
levels of bisected than non-bisected oligosaccharides. Together, these<br>
observations indicate that probably both complex and hybrid bisected<br>
oligosaccharides are important for ADCC activity.<br>
[0096] In both complex and hybrid oligosaccharides, a bisecting GlcNAc leads<br>
to a large change in oligosaccharide conformations (Balaji, P. V., et al, Int. J.<br>
Biol Macromol. 75:101-114 (1996)). The change occurs in a part of the<br>
oligosaccharide that interacts extensively with the polypeptide in the CH2<br>
domain (Jefferis, R., et al, Immunol Rev. 163:59-16 (1998)). Since the<br>
polypetide is relatively flexible at this location (Jefferis, R., et al., Immunol Rev.<br>
163:59-76 (1998)), it is possible that the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine is<br>
mediating its biological effects through a conformational change in the Fc region.<br>
The potentially altered conformations would already exist in nature, as all serum<br>
IgGs carry bisected oligosaccharides. The main difference between the<br>
engineered and. natural antibodies would be the proportion of molecules<br>
displaying the more active conformations.<br>
[0097] Various approaches for increasing the activity of unconjugated mAbs are<br>
currently under clinical evaluation, including radio-imrnunotherapy, antibody-<br>
dependent enzyme/prodrugtherapy, immunotoxins and adjuvant therapy with<br>
cytokines (Hjelm Skog, A., et al, Cancer Immunol Immunother. 48:463-410<br>
(1999); Blakey, D. C, et al, Cell Biophys. 25:175-183 (1994); Wiseman, G. A.,<br>
et al, Clin Cancer Res. 5:3281s-3296s (1999); Hank, J. A., et al, Cancer Res.<br>
50:5234-5239 (1990)). These technologies can give large increases in activity,<br>
but they can also lead to significantly higher side effects, elevated production<br>
costs and complex logistics from production to administration to patients when<br>
compared to unconjugated mAbs. The technology presented here offers an<br>
alternative way to obtain increases in potency while maintaining a simple<br>
production process, and should be applicable to many unconjugated mAbs.<br>
EXAMPLE 2.<br>
New Versions of the Anti-Renal Cell Carcinoma Antibody chG250 Having<br>
Enhanced Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity Obtained by<br>
Glycosylation Engineering of a chG250 Producing Cell Line<br>
1. Cell culture<br>
[0098] SP2/0 mouse myeloma cells producing chG250 chimeric mAb<br>
(wt-chG250-SP2/0 cells) were grown in standard cell culture medium<br>
supplemented with 1:100 (v/v) pencillin/streptomycin/antmycotic solution<br>
(SIGMA, Buchs, Switzerland). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2<br>
humidified atmosphere in Tissue Culture Flasks. Medium was changed each 3-4<br>
days. Cells were frozen in culture medium containing 10% DMSO.<br>
2. Generation of SP2/0 cells with pGnTIII-puro expression<br>
[0099] wt-chG250-SP2/0 myeloma cells were transfected by electroporation with<br>
a vector for constitutive expression of GnTIII operatively linked via an IRES to<br>
a puromycin resistance gene. 24 hours before electroporation culture medium<br>
was changed and cells were seeded at 5x105 cells/ml. Seven million cells were<br>
centrifuged for 4 min at 1300 rpm at 4 °C. Cells were washed with 3 mL new<br>
medium and centrifuged again. Cells were resuspended in a volume of 0.3-0.5<br>
ml of reaction mix, containing 1.25% (v/v) DMSO and 20-30 ug DNA in culture<br>
medium. The electroporation mix was then transferred to a 0.4 cm cuvette and<br>
pulsed at low voltage (250-300 V) and high capacitance (960 uF) using Gene<br>
Pulser from Bio Rad. After electroporation cells were quickly transferred to 6<br>
mL 1.25% (v/v) DMSO culture medium in a T25 culture flask and incubated at<br>
37 °C. Stable integrants were selected by applying 2 ug/mL puromycin to the<br>
medium two days after electroporation. After 2-3 weeks a stable,<br>
puromycin-resitant mixed population was obtained. Single-cell derived clones<br>
were obtained via FACS and were subsequently expanded and maintained under<br>
puromycin selection.<br>
3. Western Blot<br>
[0100] Puromycin-resistant clones were screened for GnTIII expression by<br>
Western blotting. The Western blots clearly showed that clones 5H12, 4E6 and<br>
4E8 were expressing the highest levels of GnTIII. 5G2 also showed a GnTIII<br>
band of middle intensity, whereas 2F1, 3D3 and 4G3 had the lowest band<br>
intensities, therefore expressing lower amounts of GnTIII (FIG. 5).<br>
4. Production and purification of chG250 monoclonal antibody from<br>
seven GnTIII-expressing clones including wild type<br>
[0101] Clones 2F1, 3D3, 4E6, 4E8, 4G3, 5G2, 5H12 and the wild type<br>
(wt-chG250-SP2/0 cells) were seeded at 3xl05 cells/mL in atotal volume of 130<br>
ml culture medium, and cultivated in single Triple-flasks. Cells used for seeding<br>
were all in full exponential growth phase, therefore cells were considered to be<br>
at the same growth state when the production batches started. Cells were<br>
cultivated for 4 days. Supernatants containing the antibody were collected in the<br>
late exponential growth phase to ensure reproducibility. The chG250 monoclonal<br>
antibody was purified in two chromatographic steps. Culture supernatants<br>
containing the chG250 monoclonal antibody derived from each batch were first<br>
purified using a HiTrap Protein A affinity chromatography. Protein A is highly<br>
specific for the human IgG Fc region. Pooled samples from the protein A eluate<br>
were buffer exchanged to PBS by cation-exchange chromatography on a<br>
Resource S lml column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Final purity was judged<br>
to be higher than 95% from SDS-staining and Coomassie blue staining (FIG. 6).<br>
The concentration of each sample was determined with a standard calibration<br>
curve using wild type antibody with known concentration.<br>
5. Oligosaccharide profiling of mAb preparations derived from the<br>
seven clones expressing different GnTIII levels<br>
[0102] Oligosaccharide profiles were obtained by matrix-assisted laser<br>
desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF-MS),<br>
which accurately provides the molecular masses of the different oligosaccharide<br>
structures. This technique allows a quantitative analysis of proportions between<br>
different oligosaccharide structures within a mixture. Neutral oligosaccharides<br>
appeared predominantly as [M + Na+] ions, however sometimes they were<br>
accompanied by smaller [M + K+] ions, leading to an increase in mass of m/z of<br>
16. The percentage of the structure appearing as potassium ion adducts depends<br>
on the content of the matrix and may thus vary between samples. A mixture of<br>
neutral N-linked oligosaccharides derived from each antibody preparation was<br>
analyzed using a 2,5-dehydrobenzoic acid (2,5-DHB) as matrix. Some of the<br>
peaks in the spectra were unequivocally assigned to specific oligosaccharide<br>
structures, because of known monosaccharide composition and unique mass.<br>
However, sometimes multiple structures could be assigned to a particular mass.<br>
MALDI enables the determination of the mass and cannot distinguish between<br>
isomers. Knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway and previous structural data<br>
enable, in most cases, the assignment of an oligosaccharide structure to a peak<br>
in the spectrum.<br>
[0103] Oligosaccharides derived from the mAb sample produced in<br>
wt-chG250-SP2/0 cell line, that does not express GuTIII, contained nonbisected<br>
biantennary complex (m/z 1486) and mono- or di-galactosylated nonbisected<br>
biantennary complex structures (FIG. 7A), both ot(l,6)-fucosylated in the core<br>
region (peaks m/z 1648 and 1810 respectively).<br>
{01.041 Expression of GnTIII generated bisected Fc-associated oligosaccharide<br>
structures of two types: complex or hybrid. Complex bisected oligosaccharides<br>
were unequivocally assigned to peaks at m/z 1543, 1689, 1705, 1851 and 1867<br>
([M + K+] adduct). As expected, the increase in bisected oligosaccharides was<br>
accompanied by a concomitant reduction of peaks m/z 1486 and 1648, that<br>
correspond to nonbisected complex oligosaccharides. For all samples derived<br>
from the GnTIII expressing clones, the main substrate of GnTIII (m/z 1486)<br>
decreased dramatically. As expected, the percentage of the nonbisected complex<br>
oligosaccharide type, assigned to peak at m/z 1648, had the lowest values for the<br>
clones expressing the highest GnTIII levels (clones 4E6, 4E8, 5G2 and 5H12).<br>
These two peaks decreased in favor of the accumulation of bisected complex and<br>
bisected hybrid type oligosaccharides (FIGS. 7A-7D and 8A-8D). The<br>
percentage of bisected complex oligosaccharides was higher for the samples<br>
derived from the clones expressing lower amounts of GnTIII. This is consistent<br>
with the fact that a higher GnTIII expression level probably shifts the<br>
biosynthetic flux to bisected hybrid structures, thereby decreasing the relative<br>
proportions of complex and complex bisected compound. For bisected hybrid<br>
structures, two possible structures could sometimes be assigned to a single peak.<br>
Therefore, some assumptions were made in order to approximate the percentage<br>
of these structures over the total oligosaccharide pool. Peaks m/z 1664, 1680,<br>
1810 and 1826 can be assigned to either bisected hybrid type, to galactosylated<br>
complex oligosaccharides, or a mixture of them. Due to the fact that the<br>
wt-antibody preparation had a relatively low percentage of peak 1664, it was<br>
assumed that this peak, appearing in significant amounts in the antibody samples<br>
derived from the different clones, corresponded entirely to bisected hybrid<br>
structures (FIGS. 7A-7D and 8A-8D). However to assign a specific structure to<br>
peaks m/z 1810 and 1826 further characterization has to be performed. In<br>
summary, by overexpression of GnTIII, bisected oligosaccharides structures were<br>
generated and their relative proportions correlated with Gn'TIII expression levels.<br>
6. Measurement of antibody mediated cytotoxic activity by<br>
Calcein-AM retention<br>
[0105] The Calcein-AM retention method of measuring cytotoxicity measures<br>
the dye fluorescence remaining in the cells after incubation with the antibody.<br>
Four million G250 antigen-positive cells (target) were labelled with 10 mM<br>
Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 1.8 mLRPMI-1640 cell culture<br>
medium (GIBCO BRL, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal calf<br>
serum for 30 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The cells were<br>
washed twice in culture medium and resuspended in 12 mL AIMV serum free<br>
medium (GIBCO BRL, Basel, Switzerland). Labelled cells were then transferred<br>
to U-bottom 96-wells (30,000 cells/well) and incubated in triplicate with<br>
different concentrations of antibody for 1 hour at 4°C. Peripheral blood<br>
mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated from heparinated fresh human blood<br>
(in all experiments obtained from the same healthy donor) by centrifugation over<br>
a Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech, Dubendorf, Switzerland) gradient. PBMCs<br>
were added in triplicate wells in a 50 mL volume, yielding an effector to target<br>
ratio (E:T ratio) of 25:1 and a final volume of 200 /mL. The 96-well plate was<br>
then incubated for 4 hours at 37° C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Thereafter the<br>
96-well plate was centrifuged at 700 x g for 5 min and the supernatants were<br>
dis carded. The cell pellets were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution<br>
(HBSS) and lysed in 200 mL 0.05M sodium borate, pH 9, 0.1% Triton X-100.<br>
Retention of the fluorescent dye in the target cells was measured with a<br>
FLUOstar microplate reader (BMG LabTechnologies, O ffenburg, Germany). The<br>
specific lysis was calculated relative to a total lysis control, resulting from<br>
exposure of the target cells to saponin (200 mg/mL in AJMV; SIGMA., Buchs,<br>
Switzerland) instead of exposure to antibody. Specific lysis (%) was calculated<br>
with the following formula:<br><br>
where Fmed represents the fluorescence of target cells treated with medium alone<br>
and considers unspecific lysis by PMBCs, Fexp represents the fluorescence of cells<br>
treated with antibody and Fdet represents the fluorescence of cells treated with<br>
saponin instead of antibody.<br>
[0106] To determine the effect of modified glycosylation variants of chG250 on<br>
the in vitro ADCC activity, G250 antigen-positive target cells were cultured with<br>
PBMCs with and without chG250 antibody samples at different concentrations.<br>
The cytotoxicity of unmodified chG250 antibody derived from the wild type cell<br>
line was compared with two antibody preparations derived from two cell lines<br>
(3D3, 5H12) expressing intermediate and high GnTIII levels, respectively (see<br>
FIG. 5).<br>
[0107] Unmodified chG250 antibody did not mediate significant ADCC activity<br>
over the entire concentration range used in the assay (the activity was not<br>
significantly different from background). Augmented ADCC activity (close to<br>
20%, see FIG. 9) at 2 mg/mL was observed with the antibody sample derived<br>
from clone 3D3, which expressed intermediate GnTIII levels. The cytotoxic<br>
activity of this antibody samples did not grow at higher antibody concentrations.<br>
As expected the antibody preparation derived from clone 5H12 showed a striking<br>
increase over samples 3D3 and unmodified antibody in its ability to mediate<br>
ADCC against target cells. The maximal ADCC activity of this antibody<br>
preparation was around 50% and was remarkable in mediating significant ADCC<br>
activity at 125-fold less concentrated when comparing with the unmodified<br>
control sample.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Treatment of Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia in a Patient<br>
with Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease<br>
[0108] Autoimmune thrombocytopenia in chronic graft-versus-host disease<br>
representsaninstanceofB-celldysregulationleadingtoclinicaldisease. Totreat<br>
immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in a subject with chronic graft-verisus-host<br>

Specifically, a weekly infusion of the antibody, 375 mg/m2 is administered to the<br>
subject for 4 weeks. The antibody therapy produces a marked depletion of B<br>
cells in the peripheral blood and decreased levels of platelet-associated antibody.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Treatment of Severe, Immune-Mediated, Pure Red Cell Aplasia<br>
and Hemolytic Anemia<br>
[0109] Immune-mediated, acquired pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare<br>
disorder frequently associated with other autoimmune phenomena. To treat<br>
immune-mediated, acquired pure red cell aplasia in a subject, an anti-CD20<br>
chimeric monoclonal antibody prepared by the methods of the present invention<br>
and having increased ADCC is administered to the subject as described in Zecca,<br>
M. et al., Blood 12:3995-97 (1997) (the entire contents of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference). Specifically, a subject with PRCA and autoimmune<br>
hemolytic anemia is given two doses of antibody, 375 mg/m2, per week. After<br>
antibody therapy, substitutive treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin is<br>
initiated. This treatment produces a marked depletion of B cells and a significant<br>
rise in reticulocyte count accompanied by increased hemoglobin levels.<br>
