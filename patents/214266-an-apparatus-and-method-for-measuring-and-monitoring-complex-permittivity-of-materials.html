				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for measuring<br>
and monitoring complex permittivity of materials.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Microstrip and microstrip type resonators described are efficient<br>
devices for measuring complex permittivity of materials at<br>
microwave frequencies as disclosed by Flemming U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,829,233; by Heath U.S. Patent No.3,510,764; and by Gerhard<br>
U.S. Patent No.3,942,107 and by King U.S. Patent No.5,334,941.<br>
Flemming describes a method in which a resonator is mounted<br>
on the copper-backed substrate. A resonator is weekly coupled<br>
to a microwave feed source and to a microwave detector so that<br>
the resonator Q factor is unaffected by the impedance"s of the<br>
source or the detector. When the test dielectric is placed near<br>
the resonator, the electromagnetic fields near the resonator<br>
are coupled to the material under test so as to affect the<br>
resonator frequency of resonance as well as Q factor.<br>
The resonant frequency and Q factor measurements are done in<br>
the transmission mode. Further the methods for modulating source<br>
or resonant frequency "are disclosed which avoids the need for<br>
the swept source.<br>
Heath uses a half wavelength microstrip resonator, which is<br>
tightly sandwiched between two sheets of sample test material.<br>
These sheets of sample material are clamped in a special fixture.<br>
The microstrip resonator is loosely capacitively coupled to<br>
the microstrip feed line, which passes near one end of the<br>
resonator normal to the resonator length. The dielectric constant<br>
is determined from the measurement of resonant frequency and<br>
Q factor for the transmission between sensor"s two input and<br>
output ports. As the special cutting and positioning of thin<br>
sheets of the sample material is required; Heath"s method is<br>
not in situ or non-destructive.<br>
King relates to the microwave resonator reflection sensor for<br>
complex permittivity measurement in situ. The microstrip<br>
resonator is fed from the ground plane side through a slot.<br>
Microwave power is coupled to the slot through a coaxial line<br>
or a raicrostrip. The material under test is kept in contact<br>
with the sensor. The resonant frequency and input power coupling<br>
factor is measured at the resonant frequency. The real and<br>
imaginary parts of permittivity (f "and £ ") or the conductivity<br>
(s) are determined from the resonant frequency and coupling<br>
coefficient data using approximate closed form expressions.<br>
King uses bottom fed resonators which claims to be a major<br>
modification but this leads to complicated assembly and unstable<br>
mounting compared to the side-coupled resonator. The<br>
approximation in the basic expression of capacitance of the<br>
cross section of the sensor leads to the serious inaccuracies<br>
in the results. The closed form expressions need use of standards<br>
for calibration to evaluate constants. King depends upon<br>
empirical or analytical calibration. Evaluation of constants<br>
before the installation and commissioning of the sensor is<br>
essential. The starting equation of effective capacitance of<br>
King is based on the assumption that the fringing fields constant<br>
is same for all thickness of sample. Our analysis (fig.12) shows<br>
that the resonant frequency varies with the permittivity as<br>
well as material thickness. King is limited to the measurement<br>
of infinitely thick samples only. The empirical calibration<br>
techniques of King leads to errors if the thickness of the sample<br>
is different than the calibration standard. King claims the<br>
in situ sensor but it is not possible to perform in situ<br>
calibrations in most situations, as the chamber cannot be filled<br>
with the calibration liquid or solid. King leads to errors in<br>
the calculated and true data due to calibrations using standards.<br>
The same; is true for the analytical calibrations as the actual<br>
surface itregularities and air gaps between resonator and the<br>
solid sample contribute to the errors in measurements. It is<br>
essential to validate analytical technique with the standard<br>
data. Dispersion in microstrip with dielectric overlay also<br>
plays an important part in errors. None of the empirical<br>
calibration techniques using closed form expressions account<br>
for dispersion. The shifts in the resonant frequency can be<br>
larger than 1 GHz at the material permittivities of 10(fig.13).<br>
Hence dispersion affects accuracy at first decimal place of<br>
permittivity.<br>
Both Flemming and Heath involve transmission from one input<br>
port to an output port. Both ports are loosely and capacitively<br>
coupled to the intervening resonator by capacitive coupling.<br>
King relates only to the critically coupled reflection one port<br>
sensor. King relates to the samples of very large size compared<br>
to the sensor. Gerhard relates to the measurement real part<br>
of the dielectric constant only. The samples under consideration<br>
are thin sheets of dielectric materials.<br>
Gabelich"s measures dielectric homogeneity at 100 KHz to 2MHz<br>
for the use of dielectric substrates for CTS-ESA radar antennas<br>
on Barium STrontium Titanate (BST). The C band or microwave<br>
permittivity is co-related to low frequency permittivity even<br>
though it is not accurate enough. Gabelich"s measures only real<br>
part of permittivity.<br>
US patent no 5686841 Nov 11,1997, Stolarczyk et. al teach the<br>
use of patch antenna to detect presence of ice, water and/or<br>
antifreeze mixtures on wings of the aircraft or roads. A single<br>
frequency is fed to the antenna which is one of the arms of<br>
the bridge circuit. This frequency is varied until admittance<br>
of the antenna approaches zero. The object of the Stolarczyk"s<br>
invention is not to accurately determine complex or real<br>
permittivity but to only detect formation of ice. The frequency<br>
resolution of the frequency variation is very low, of the order<br>
of 2.4MHz.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A primary object of this invention is to propose a process and<br>
apparatus for the measurement and monitoring of complex<br>
permittivity and conductivity of materials in situ which is<br>
accurate.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process and<br>
apparatus for the measurement and monitoring of complex<br>
permittivity and conductivity of materials in situ using<br>
automatic scalar or vector network analyzers or swept frequency<br>
generators and peak detectors that perform fast and accurate<br>
frequency and amptitude measurements.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a process<br>
and apparatus for the measurement and monitoring of complex<br>
permittivity and conductivity of materials in situ employing<br>
online numerical analysis software performing numerous iterations<br>
to arrive at convergence within few seconds with required<br>
accuracy like ± 0.1 or t 0.01 in case of £ and ± 0.0001 or ±<br>
0.0005 in case of e .<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a process<br>
and apparatus for the measurement and monitoring of complex<br>
permittivity and conductivity of materials in situ and wherein<br>
the determination of real and imaginary parts of permittivity<br>
takes place in a relatively short period.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a process and<br>
apparatus for the measurement and monitoring of complex<br>
permittivity and conductivity of materials in situ and wherein<br>
the permittivity measurement does not depend on the first order<br>
• approximations and simplistic closed form expressions involving<br>
unkown constants.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a process<br>
and apparatus for the measurement and monitoring of complex<br>
permittivity and conductivity of materials in situ and used<br>
for high frequency circuits boards, various bulk polymers and<br>
semiconductor materials.<br>
Yet a further object of this invention is to propose a process<br>
and apparatus for the measurement and monitoring of complex<br>
permittivity and conductivity of materials in situ and wherein<br>
transmission type resonators may be used for samples of smaller<br>
size than the resonator.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention provides a device and process for measuring and<br>
monitoring complex permittivity of materials for quality control,<br>
in situ and in the materials measurement laboratory. Material<br>
under test is kept as an overlay on microstrip, asymmetric<br>
stripline, co-planar waveguide, patch or a disc resonator. The<br>
resonator has its resonant frequency in the range of 0.5 to<br>
20 GHz. The material is placed in contact with the top conductors<br>
of the circuits or with a finite air gap above the top conductor.<br>
The ground plane at the top may or may not be used. Fringing<br>
field from the top surface and the edges of the resonator passes<br>
through the material under test kept as an overlay dielectric.<br>
As the fields above the substrate pass through the material<br>
under test the effective permittivity of the resonator increases.<br>
The Q factor {Q-ß/2a) of the resonator changes due to change<br>
in the propagation constant (ß) and attenuation constant (a).<br>
Increase in the effective permittivity of a microstrip, asymmetic<br>
stripline, coplanar waveguide resonator, rejection filter, patch<br>
or a disc causes decrease in the resonant frequency of the<br>
resonator. Q factor of the resonator decreases as the attenuation<br>
due to overlay adds to the total losses.<br>
The invention envisages the use of transmission as well as<br>
reflection type resonators. The resonators are coupled to the<br>
source of microwave power using direct or gap coupling<br>
(capacitively or inductively) from the side of the microstrip<br>
conductor and not from the ground plane side. The measurements<br>
may be one port or two port depending upon the dimensions of<br>
the material under test. If a swept frequency source is used<br>
then a resonant dip may be observed in the reflection or<br>
transmission mode with the available instrument accuracy. Q<br>
factor is directly measured using half power frequencies and<br>
the resonant frequency. The unloaded Q measurement is preferred<br>
for the accurate measurement C " or s If loaded Q is measured<br>
then it is necessary to calculate unloaded Q from loaded Q<br>
factor. The resonant or half power frequencies may be<br>
automatically of manually measured and fed to the computer using<br>
data acquisition system and/or frequency tracking device. The<br>
dedicated computer program calculates real and imaginary parts<br>
of the complex permittivity or conductivity of the material<br>
under test. The program is based on the numerical analysis of<br>
a microstrip embedded in multiple dielectric layers, the material<br>
under test being the layer of unknown permittivity.<br>

With reference to the drawings, Fig.1 and 2 are schematic<br>
diagrams showning an arrangement of the apparatus for the use<br>
in this- invention. Fig.1 shows an instrument for the<br>
determination of complex permittivity of materials comprising:<br>
I. Automated scalar or vector network analyzer; II. reflection<br>
or transmission type microwave sensors of any type and as<br>
shown in Fig.3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11; III. A computer with IEEE<br>
GPIB or any other standard interface; IV. Data acquisition and<br>
postprocessing numerical analysis software for the determination<br>
of complex permittivity loaded on the computer.<br>
Fig. 2 shows schamatic diagram of the instrument using I. sweep<br>
generator; II. reflectometer bridge or directional coupler;<br>
III. power meter or VSWR meter; IV. Computer with IEEE GPIB<br>
or any other standard interface; 5. reflection or transmission<br>
type microwave sensors 2 or 7 of any type shown in<br>
fig.3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,.11. The network analyzer has a built in<br>
synthesized sweep generator which generates swept frequency<br>
output with the required frequency span. The frequency resolution]<br>
of the sweep generator can be as high as 1 Hz. The output power<br>
level may be adjusted to the required value. The swept microwave<br>
power output of the sweep generator is coupled to the sensor<br>
circuit via a special purpose test fixture and a coaxial cable.<br>
If the sensor in the test fixture is of reflection type then<br>
a directional coupler or a reflectometer bridge is used to<br>
isolate reflected power and then it is coupled to the detector<br>
port. The reference signal is being fed externally in case of<br>
a scalar network analyzer. The network analyzer calculates ratio<br>
of reflection and/or transmitted parameters to the input power<br>
to the sensor for the range of swept frequencies. The reasonant<br>
frequency is displayed on the screen as a sharp peak is observed<br>
due to the storage of power in the resonator. The half power<br>
frequencies are observed on the screen with the help of automatic<br>
3 dB search or manually. According to the block diagram of Fig.2,<br>
sweep generator generates swept signal and is fed to the sensor<br>
2 or 7 through the reflectometer bridge. The test specimen 4<br>
of unkown permittivity is kept as ^n overlay on the reflection<br>
sensor. Microwave power is coupled to the reflection sensor<br>
2 or 7 through a coaxial cable using standard coaxial to<br>
microstrip transition like SMA connector. The reflectometer<br>
separates reflected signal from the outgoing signal and is<br>
measured by the power meter. The transmitted signal can be<br>
measured by the power meter directly. The resonance is detected<br>
by the displayed power output reading of the sensor at the<br>
particular frequency. The frequency resolution of the instrument<br>
and process is the resolution of the sweep generator which can,<br>
be as high as 1 IIz.<br>

as an overlay.<br>

dimensions.<br>

as an overlay and a top ground plane 12.<br>
Fig.10 shows a schematic diagram of a direct coupled, reflection<br>
type coplanar waveguide sensor 15(quarter or half wavelength)<br>
and the test specimen 4 unknown permittivity 6(C) kept as an<br>
overlay.<br>

type microstrip ring resonator sensor 14(one wavelength) and<br>
the test specimen 4 of smaller dimensions than the resonator<br>
length having unknown permittivity 6(£) kept as an overlay at<br>
the 90 orientation with respect to the feed line 5.<br>
Fig.12 shows results of the numerical software of the present<br>
invention simulating a reflection or transmission type microstrip<br>
sensor. The graph shows variation of effective permittivity<br>
[ with respect to cover permittivity and test material thickness<br>
when the test material completely overlaps the sensor. This<br>
graph indicates the difference between other inventions of using<br>
microstrip resonator sensors kept in the vicinity of test<br>
material. This invention does not use any approximate closed<br>
form expressions for the calibration of sensor but uses on-line<br>
numerical analysis which does not require use of known standards<br>
or empirical calibrations (like Flemming et. al. US patent<br>
no.4,829.233 or King 5,334,941); but uses on-line or off-line<br>
computer software.<br>
test. A dedicated computer program computes complex permittivity using<br>
electromagnetic numerical analysis software analyzing resonator embedded(fig 7,8)<br>
in multiple dielectric layers. The program takes less than three seconds on the IBM<br>
compatible computer with Pentium 350 MHz processor and three minutes on 80386<br>
processor. The user can choose the required accuracy.<br>
The material under test,4 for which complex permittivity,6 is to be measured is kept<br>
in direct contact of the resonator or keeping a gap of few microns from the<br>
resonator. A top ground plane, 12 is optional. The computer program needs to be fed<br>
the information on the type of resonator configuration as well as presence of top<br>
ground plane and thickness and length of the material under test. the test set up<br>
needs to be calibrated for acceptable connector assembly. The resonator is tested<br>
without the presence of material under test initially. The resonant frequency and half<br>
power frequency are measured and fed to the program. The sample or material under<br>
test,4 is then placed over the resonator in the required orientation and the specified<br>
position. The sensor is placed in the reaction chamber or a drier or in the moving<br>
belt in case of flowing material without disturbing the connector assembly. The<br>
presence of dielectric material in the vicinity of the resonator shifts frequency of<br>
resonance due to the increase in the effective permittivity, eeff of the resonator.<br>
Where subscripts * O and "s" stand for open and with loaded sample.<br>
At resonance electrical length of a microstrip resonator is an integral<br>
multiple of half wavelengths. The real part of effective permittivity eeff of an open<br>
resonator is determined by the software program by feeding width of the top<br>
conductor, substrate permittivity, substrate loss tangent and substrate permittivity. It<br>
is necessary to know these values most accurately as the errors and uncertainties in<br>
these values will reflect on the resultant values of permittivities of specimens kept<br>
as overlays. Hence utmost care is required in designing and fabricating the test<br>
vehicle. The eeff, thus determined is numerically postprocessed by the program to<br>
determine specimen real part of the permittivity £r the required accuracy may be<br>
fed to the interactive program at the maximum of ±0.01.<br>
The Quality factor, Q of the resonator changes due to the additional<br>
dielectric and conductor losses due to the overlay material. Our numerical analysis<br>
shows increase in the total toss due to dielectric covert fig. 15). The unloaded Q<br>
factor of a resonator is given by the standard relation.<br>
The software also calculates conductor loss for the microstrip with cover specimen.<br>
This is not same as an open microstrip conductor loss[7]. The program evaluates the<br>
dissipation factor of cover specimen from the given data using electromagnetic<br>
numerical analysis. The radiation loss can be neglected if desired.<br>
Neglecting radiation losses the program calculates contribution of cover dielectric to<br>
the dielectric loss and hence gives the value of dissipation factor tan S of the<br>
sample.<br><br>
where Qf= Quality factor due to conductor losses<br>
Q4= Quality factor due to dielectric losses<br>
Qd= Quality factor due to radiation losses<br>
Let Qtfopen} - Total Quality factor of an open microstrip resonator<br>
at(cover) = Total Quality factor of a covered microstrip resonator<br>
a ~ Total attenuation per unit length of an open microstrip resonator<br>
at(cover) - Total attenuation per unit length of a covered microstrip resonator<br><br>
The numerical analysis indicates conductor loss ac(cover) as well as ad of a<br>
microstrip with dielectric cover is larger than the open microstrip. For low<br>
permittivity and lossy materials the increase in the conductor loss may be neglected<br>
Neglecting radiation losses.<br><br>
where q,= filling fraction due to substrate<br>
e, = real part of permittivity of substrate<br>
q2,= filling fraction due to dielectric cover<br>
e2= real part of permittivity of the cover<br><br>
It can be noticed that determination of e" or tan 6 requires a value of e" of the test<br>
material. King(US patent no. 5334941) neglects dependence of e" on the effective<br>
capacitance and treats effective capacitance as a constant, which is certainly not the<br>
case. Therefore determination of e" has inherent inaccuracy in King"s method.<br>
This invention actually used a highly accurate value of e" in the<br>
determination of e" along with the numerically calculated conductor and dielectric<br>
losses.<br><br>
From equations (9) and (11)<br><br>
where the program uses the value of e2 obtained numerically beforehand and<br><br>
In case materials with very low values of tand increase in the conductor loss due to<br>
increased effective permittivity needs to be subtracted from the total loss. The<br>
computer program takes dare of it from the determined value of tan5. Hence the<br>
process is applicable to materials with high and low loss dielectrics including<br>
materials used for high frequency applications in microwave region.<br>
Measurement of material samples that are smaller in dimensions<br>
than that of the resonator:<br>
The invention provides a process of measurement of complex permittivity of<br>
samples that are smaller in length(fig.6) and breadth(fig. 11) than that of the<br>
resonator. The examples of such samples are single grain of wheat, coffee, rise,<br>
GaAs, diamond and other precious stones, various types of medicine capsules etc.<br>
The invention can be used for studying sample to sample variation in the complex<br>
permittivity of objects of the dimensions of few millimeters. The software will ask<br>
for the dimensions of the material sample under test and will follow the required<br>
subroutine.<br>
For a half wave resonator<br><br>
where subscripts 1 and 2 stand for different materials overlaying the resonator.<br>
If the sample is partially covering the resonator in the region 2 then eeff, assumes the<br>
value of effective permittivity for the open microstrip and /, is the length of the open<br>
region of the resonator. eeff is the unknown value of effective permittivity of the<br>
overlaid microstrip at the frequency of operation. Equation holds for both real and<br>
imaginary parts of eeff The effect of dispersion needs to be taken into account. In the<br>
present invention software is taking care of dispersion. The unknown effective<br>
permittivity is determined using the equation (15) by the software<br>
It is possible to use this technique at the<br>
manufacturing site to monitor chemical reactions involving<br>
insulating or low conductivity materials and quality of materials<br>
like poly tetra fluro ethylene (PTFE) and other polymer, rubbers<br>
and foams. The instrument and the process may be used at the<br>
various stages of manufacturing or curing or processing of<br>
polymer, organic, food or agricultural products to ensure the<br>
final quality. The process and instrument may be used to detect<br>
voids, porosity, cracks, and non-uniformity of permittivity<br>
or density of the material.<br>
The microstip resonator used as a test vehicle may<br>
be pre-calibrated before the measurment starts. It may also<br>
be possible to use calibration standard overlays to define system<br>
uncertainties. After establishing acceptable connector assembly<br>
the connector and fixture repeatability does not affect sample<br>
to sample measurements. This is due to the fact that input and<br>
output cables and connections to the resonator and/or test<br>
vehicle are tested before the sample is loaded and are unaltered<br>
thereafter during measurment. It is not necessary to connect<br>
the disconnect the test vehicle if next sample is to be measured.<br>
This is a significant advantage over the existing test methods<br>
for high frequency circuit boards and materials like IPC-TM-<br>
650, no. 2.5.5.5.1, and the document of International Packaging<br>
Commission.<br>
The test vehicle design may include care for avoiding<br>
loading error so that loading error is avoided with confidence.<br>
This is a distinct advantage as the loading error uncertainties<br>
remain to be tackled at the time of measurments in method IPC-<br>
TM-650, no. 2.5.5.5.1. The loading time for the specimen may<br>
be of a few seconds. The response of a network analyzer is within<br>
fraction of a second. Determination of permittivity with the<br>
computer takes few seconds. Therefore the measurments may be<br>
very fast for multiple samples. The accepted methods require<br>
either fabrication of microstrip resonators on the sample under<br>
test or need a complicated assembly clamping which may take<br>
longer for each sample measurment.<br>
The present invention exploits maximum resolution<br>
of frequency source and detector of Network analyzers which<br>
is quoted to be 1Hz by Hewlett Packard for its vector Network<br>
analyzers. Patch antenna of either rectangular or disc shaped<br>
is used to determine real dielectric constant with the accuracy<br>
of +0.015 and tan to the accuracy of +0.0001 or more. Single<br>
antenna or any other type of resonator is used to measure complex<br>
permittivity with the help of online numerical analysis program.<br>
There are many differences and uses of the present<br>
invention in comparison with the inventions of Health, Flemming,<br>
Gerhard, Gabelich and King. In particular variety of sample<br>
dimensions can be accommodated from 3 mm(fig.6,11)e.g. wheat<br>
or rice grain or pallet or tablet; to very large dimensions<br>
in length and breadth (fig. 4,5,8,10). Depth of the sample may<br>
be as small as 0.1mm (fig. 6,7,8) to few meters depth<br>
(Fig.4,5,8,10,11). The present invention can also be used for<br>
the measurment of complex permittivity (fig.7,8,10) and<br>
dielectric homogeneity in the sheets of dielectric materials.<br>
The test material needs to be moved relative to the sensor or<br>
multiple sensors may be employed in the production process.<br>
The present invention uses on-line numerical analysis software<br>
which has been validated for variety of materials of known<br>
