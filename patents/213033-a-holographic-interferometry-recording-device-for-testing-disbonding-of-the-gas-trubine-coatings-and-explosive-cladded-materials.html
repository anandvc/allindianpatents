				<td>This invention relates to a device for non-destructive testing of gas turbine coatings and explosive-cladded materials by a new thermal stressing technique to detect disbonding using holographic interferometry.<br>
Non-destructive testing of components by holographic interferometry makes use of a number of stressing process that are in application for the past several years.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the existing process having serious limitations in using detection of deviation in the gross structural deformative fringe system as a reference set to observe the disbonded areas.<br>
One of the main disadvantages is that the existing process fails to detect smaller dimensions of the defects at greater depths of the disbonded areas in laminates and in metal to metal contacts.<br>
Another disadvantage of the existing process is that inspite of successful applications of holographic non-destructive testing (HNDT) techniques, they are inadequate to deal with in detecting<br>
the metal  to metal  interface  defective  bonded zones of gas<br><br>
and turbine coating, by thermal and plasma spray, explosive-cladded materials.<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to provide a device comprising holographic interferometry using<br><br>
an improved thermal stressing technique.<br>
Another  object  of  the present  invention	is  to provide a<br>
new  technique  with  parameters  to  excite  the	 disbonded are in coatings and disbonding between substrate	and the coating<br>
is detected by HNDT.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a technique using an improved thermal stressing of a component, conditions of which is close to hyperbolic heat conduction phenomena.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a device to observe the disbonded areas directly eliminating the necessity of using the fringe control techniques to highlight the disbonded location.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a device wherein there is no limitations in detecting the minimum mensions like diameter, and depths of disbonded area and their ratio.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a device for non-destructive testing of gas turbine coatings and explosive - cladded materials by a new thermal stressing technique to detect disbonding using holoraphic interferometry <br>
comprising a laser source using He-Ne laser of 25-mW, providing<br>
laser beam through a beam splitter placed at 45° and two beams<br>
are projected at mirrors placed at 45°, the reflected<br>
beams are passed through spatial filter with first <br>
reflected from beam splitter is projected onto a photographic<br>
plate and the second beam to the same photographic plate being<br>
reflected by the specimen and a heat source projecting onto<br>
the substrate of the specimen with the coating at the back facing<br>
the photographic plate, characterized in that, the holographic-<br>
recording device records the first exposure at ambient<br>
temperature thereafter the heating device is on for short<br>
duration for thermal stress and the second exposure recorded<br>
after the said heating source is withdrawn to record double <br>
exposure holograms.	<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and-further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the ensuing description made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the holographic recording device.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the heating device for thermal stressing.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the device comprises of a holographic recording set up shown in Fig. 1 and the heating arrangement for thermal stressing shown in Fig.2.<br>
A laser source (1) Me- Ne laser 25  MW which in BEAMED through a beam spliter (2) placed at AS" angle. First beam pu.HSOH straight passes through and is reflected at mirror (3) placed at 45° angle. The reflected first beam is made to pass through a spatial filter (5) and optical lens (5). The first beam is then reflected from a test specimen (7) to the photographic plate (8). The coated surface (10) of the specimen (7) is facing towards the photographic plate (8). The second beam reflected from the beam splitter (2) is reflected again at a mirror (A) placed at 45° angle and passes through optical lens (6) and a spatial filter (6) projected straight to the photographic plate (8). A heat source (9) is provided for heating the specimen (7) at a point in the buck surface of the <br>
(11) of contact area of one square centimeter for a short duration. The coated surface (10) is facing the photographic plate.<br>
Double-exposed holographic interferometric method is used for detecting the disbonded areas. Thermal stresing is  done by heating the specimen for a short duration. Double exposure re is at ambient temperature and the second exposure soon after withdrawing the heat source. The photographic plate is processed and image is reconstructed which has highlighted the disbonded areas in a) thermaly-sprayed gas turbine coating materials and b) explosive-cladded materials.<br>
This  device  uses  a  novel  method  for  full-field visual inspection of coatings of gas  turbine components,  as against:<br>
point-by-point inspection, and also for detection of sub-surf act; defects .<br>
The bonding defects of size 3 x 2 mm at the interface of the substrate and different coating materials used in gas turbines are detected.<br>
The bonding defects of size 2 x 2 mm in explosive - cladded materials of copper and steel of 4 mm thickness each are detected. The device also uses another novel method of detecting smaller disbonded areas and at greater depths than the existing thermal stressing techniques.<br>
The invention described hereinabove in relation to a non-limiting embodiment and as defined by the accompanying claims.<br><br><br><br>
