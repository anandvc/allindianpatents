(Biphenyl) carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof<br>
The present invention relates to compounds having the general formula (I) with the definitions of A, X, R1-R6 given below, and/or a salt or ester thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of said compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and their use for the modulation of y-secretase activity.<br>
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of age-related neurodegenerative illness.<br>
It is primarily, but not exclusively, associated with aging and presents clinically not only by progressive loss of memory, cognition, reasoning and judgement, but also by emotional instability and gradually leads to profound mental deterioration and death.<br>
The defining pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the brain, which are also thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease.<br>
These plaques mainly consist of peptides formed as cleavage products of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a 695 amino acid protein, whose function so far has only been the subject of various hypotheses.<br>
APP is processed in two steps; a first step (catalyzed by fi-secretase) gives rise to a secreted peptide and a membrane-bound C99-fragment.<br>
C99 is a substrate for the second proteolytic activity mediated by y-secretase resulting, inter alia, in the production of peptides in the range of 37-42 residues.<br><br>
The amount of the longer isoform, AB42, is selectively increased in patients carrying certain mutations in a particular protein (presenilin), and these mutations have been correlated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Therefore, AB42 is believed by many to be the main culprit of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
It has now become clear that the y-secretase activity cannot be ascribed to a single particular protein, but is in fact associated with an assembly of different proteins comprising Aphl, Nicastrin, Presenilin and Pen-2 (reviewed by De Strooper (2003) Neuron 38, 9)<br>
Thus, although the molecular mechanism of the 2nd cleavage-step has remained elusive until present, the y-secretase-complex has become one of the prime targets in the search for compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Other hints in the search for novel treatments came from epidemiological studies, an example being the finding that the uptake of certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ("NSAIDs") seems to correlate with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (Akiyama et al (2000) Neurobiol. Aging 21, 383; McGeer et al (1996) Neurology 47, 425; Rogers et al (1993) Neurology 43, 1609; Anthony et al (2004) Neurology 54, 2066; Stewart et al (1997) Neurology 48, 626; In't Veld et al (1999) Neurobiol. Aging 19, 607).<br>
Indeed, this finding was recently supported by biochemical studies in which an effect of certain NSAIDs on y-secretase was shown (Weggen et al (2001) Nature 414, 6860, 212; Morihara et al (2002) J. Neurochem. 4, 1009; Eriksen (2003) J. Clin. Invest. 112, 440).<br>
A development of further compounds showing a similar effect has been hampered so far by a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanism of the described effects.<br>
Thus, there is a strong need for novel compounds which modulate y-secretase activity thereby opening new avenues for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide such compounds.<br><br>
The object is achieved by a compound having the general formula (I)<br><br>

As used herein, the term "modulation of y-secretase activity" refers to an effect on the processing of APP by the y-secretase-complex. Preferably it refers to an effect in which the overall rate of processing of APP remains essentially as without the application of said compounds, but in which the relative quantities of the processed products are changed, more preferably in such a way that the amount of the AB42-peptide produced is reduced.<br>
It has been previously shown that the y-secretase complex, is also involved in the processing of the Notch-protein. Notch is a signaling protein which plays a crucial role in developmental processes (e.g. reviewed in Schweisguth F (2004) Curr. Biol. 14, R129).<br>
With respect to the use of said compounds for the modulation of y-secretase activity in therapy, it seems particularly advantageous not to interfere with the Notch-processing activity of the y-secretase activity in order to avoid putative undesired side-effects.<br>
Thus, compounds are preferred which do not show an effect on the Notch-processing activity of the y-secretase-complex.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, "effect on the Notch processing activity" includes both an inhibition or an activation of the Notch-processing activity by a certain factor.<br>
A compound is defined as not having an effect on the Notch processing activity, if said factor is smaller than 20, preferably smaller than 10, more preferably smaller than 5, most preferably smaller than 2 in the respective assay as described in Shimizu et al (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol, 20: 6913 at a concentration of 30 \xM.<br>
Such a y-secretase modulation can be carried out, e.g. in animals such as mammals. Exemplary mammals are mice, rats, guinea pigs, monkeys, dogs, cats. The modulation can also be carried out in humans.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, said modulation is performed in vitro or in cell culture.<br>
As known to the person skilled in the art, several in vitro and cell culture assays are available.<br><br>
An example for such an assay is described in WO-03/008635.<br>
Concentrations of the various products of the y-secretase cleavage (the AB-peptides) can be determined by various methods known to a person skilled in the art. Examples for such methods include determination of the peptides by mass-spectrometry or detection by antibodies.<br>
Suitable antibodies are available for example from The Genetics Company, Inc., Switzerland.<br>
Further information is disclosed for example in N. Ida et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 22908, and M. Jensen et al. (2000) Mol.Med. 6, 291. Antibody-based kits are also available from Innogenetics, Belgium.<br>
Cells which can be employed in such assays include cells which physiologically express the y-secretase complex and cells which transiently or stably express some or all interactors of the y-secretase complex.<br>
Numerous available cell lines suitable for such assays are known to the skilled person.<br>
Cells and cell lines of neuronal or glial origin are particularly suitable. Furthermore, cells and tissues of the brain as well as homogenates and membrane preparations thereof may be used.<br>
Such assays might be carried out for example to study the effect of the compounds according to the invention in different experimental conditions and configurations.<br>
Furthermore, such assays might be carried out as part of functional studies on the y-secretase complex.<br>
For example, either one or more interactors (either in their wild-type form or carrying certain mutations and/or modifications) of the y-secretase complex of an animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably humans, might be expressed in certain cell lines and the effect of the compounds according to the invention might be studied.<br><br>
Mutated forms of the interactor(s) used can either be mutated forms which have been described in certain animals, preferably mammals, more preferably humans or mutated forms which have not previously been described in said animals.<br>
Modifications of the interactors of the y-secretase complex include both any physiological modification of said interactors and other modifications which have been described as modifications of proteins in a biological system.<br>
Examples of such modifications include, but are not limited to, glycosylation, phosphorylation, prenylation, myristylation and farnesylation.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds according to the invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament for the modulation of y-secretase activity.<br>
The invention further relates to the use of said compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the modulation of y-secretase activity.<br>
The activity of the y-secretase can be modulated in different ways, i.e. resulting in different profiles of the various AB-peptide.<br>
Uses of a compound for the modulation of y-secretase activity resulting in a decrease in the relative amount of AB42-protein produced are preferred.<br>
Respective dosages, routes of administration, formulations etc are disclosed further below.<br>
The invention further relates to the use of the compounds according to the invention for the treatment of a disease associated with an elevated level of AB42-production.<br>
As used herein, the term "treatment" is intended to refer to all processes, wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, or stopping of the progression of a disease, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all symptoms.<br>
As used herein, the term "elevated level of AB42-production" refers to a condition in which the rate of production of AB42-peptide is increased due to an overall increase in the<br><br>
processing of APP or, preferably, it refers to a condition in which the production of the A642 peptide is increased due to a modification of the APP-processing profile in comparison to the wild-type/non-pathological situation.<br>
As outlined above, such an elevated AB42-level is a hallmark of patients developing or suffering from Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Furthermore the invention relates to a composition comprising a compound according to the invention in a mixture with an inert carrier.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a composition comprising a compound according to the invention in a mixture with an inert carrier, where said inert carrier is a pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
The term "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the compound is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, including but not limited to peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered orally. Saline and aqueous dextrose are preferred carriers when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are preferably employed as liquid carriers for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" by E.W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.<br><br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for the preparation of a compound according to the invention comprising the steps of coupling a phenyl acetic acid derivative, optionally said derivative being protected, with an appropriate aromatic compound and optional further functionalisation and deprotection of the thus-obtained biphenyl compound.<br>
In one embodiment a dihydroxyphenylacetic acid derivative can be alkylated with a benzyl halide, typically a benzyl bromide, using an inorganic base such as an alkali metal carbonate, typically potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile. The resultant alcohol can be converted to a triflate using eg trifluoromethanesulphonic anhydride, an organic base such as pyridine and in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. This triflate can then be coupled to a boronic acid under the variety of conditions known to those skilled in the art for such Suzuki coupling, typically using a solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, an alkali metal halide such as caesium fluoride, and a palladium compound such as tetrakis(triphenylphoshine)palladium (0).<br>
Optionally the method for the preparation of a compound according to the present invention further comprises the step of reacting the biphenyl compound with an appropriate halide or di-halide to result in a compound according to the present invention, wherein at least one of Ri, R2 is other than H.<br>
Conversion of the ester to the acid can be done using a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, typically lithium hydroxide, in the presence of water and other suitable solvents such as tetrahydroftiran and methanol.<br>

as malonic acid tert-butyl ester ethyl ester in the presence of an alkali metal hydride,<br>
typically sodium hydride and a metal halide, typically a copper halide, preferably copper<br>
bromide. Further treatment in an acidic solvent such as acetic acid at elevated temperature<br>

under the variety of conditions known to those skilled in the art for such Suzuki coupling,<br>
typically using solvents such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane and water, an alkali metal carbonate<br>
such     as    potassium     carbonate,     and     a    palladium	compound     such     as<br>

In another embodiment such a group can be incorporated by treating the ester in a suitable solvent such as DMF with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydride, typically sodium hydride at a suitable temperature, such as -4°C, and with the appropriate halide.<br>
Conversion of the ester to the acid can be done using a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, typically lithium hydroxide in the presence of water and other suitable solvents such as tetrahydroftiran and methanol.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for the preparation of a medicament comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	preparing a compound according to the invention<br>
b)	formulation of a medicament containing said compound.<br>
The compounds according to the invention and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds suitable to treat or prevent Alzheimer's disease such as Aricept (Eisai), Donepezil (Pfizer), Cognex (Warner-Lambert), Tacrine (Warner-Lambert), Axura (Merz), Memantine (Merz) or with any other of the drugs known to a person skilled in the art suitable to treat or prevent Alzheimer's disease, can be administered to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular humans, as pharmaceuticals by themselves, in mixtures with one anther or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a compound of the invention for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease/for the modulation of the y-secretase activity, e.g. encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, and microcapsules:<br>
If not delivered directly to the central nervous system, preferably the brain, it is advantageous to select and/or modify methods of administration in such a way as to allow the pharmaceutical compound to cross the blood-brain barrier.<br>
Methods of introduction include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes.<br><br>
The compounds may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion, by bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings and may be administered together with other biologically active agents.<br>
Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g. by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.<br>
In another embodiment, the compound can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (Langer (1990) Science 249, 1527; Treat et al. (1989) Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler, eds., Liss, New York, 353; Lopez-Berestein, ibid., 317)<br>
In yet another embodiment, the compound can be delivered via a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (Sefton (1987) CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14, 201; Buchwald et al. (1980) Surgery 88, 507; Saudek et al. (1989) N. Engl. J. Med. 321, 574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise, eds., CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball, eds., Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas (1983) Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23, 61; Levy et al. (1985) Science 228, 190; During et al. (1989) Ann. Neurol. 25, 351; Howard et al. (1989) J. Neurosurg. 71, 858). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (e.g. Goodson, 1984, In: Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, Vol. 2, 115). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990, Science 249, 1527).<br>
In order to select an appropriate way of administration, the person skilled in the art will also consider routes of administration which have been selected for other known Anti-Alzheimer-drugs.<br><br>
For example, Aricept/Donepezil and Cognex/Tacrine (all acetylcholinesterase-inhibitors) are being taken orally, Axura/Memantine (an NMDA-receptor antagonist) has been launched both as tablets/liquid and as an i.v.-solution.<br>
Furthermore, the skilled person in the art will take account the available data with respect to routes of administration of members of the NSAlD-family in clinical trials and other studies investigating their effect on Alzheimer's disease.<br>
In order to select the appropriate dosage, the person skilled in the art will choose a dosage which has been shown to be not toxic in preclinical and/or clinical studies and which can be in accordance with the values given beforehand, or which may deviate from these.<br>
The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. However, suitable dosage ranges for intravenous administration are generally about 20-500 micrograms of active compound per kilogram body weight. Suitable dosage ranges for intranasal administration are generally about 0.01 mg/kg body weight to 1 mg/kg body weight. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.<br>
An exemplary animal model is the transgenic mouse strain "Tg2576" containing an APP695-form with the double mutation KM670/671NL. For reference see e.g. patent US5877399 and Hsiao et al. (1996) Science 274, 99 and also Kawarabayahsi T (2001) J. Neurosci. 21, 372; Frautschy et al. (1998) Am. J. Pathol. 152, 307; Irizarry et al. (1997) J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 56, 965; Lehman et al. (2003) Neurobiol. Aging 24, 645.<br>
Substantial data from several studies are available to the skilled person in the art which are instructive to the skilled person to select the appropriate dosage for the chosen therapeutic regimen.<br>

This reaction mixture was irradiated in a CEM microwave at 120°C for 30min. The reaction mixture was diluted with water and extracted with Et20 (x3). The combined organic extracts were washed with water, dried (MgS04), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (EtOAc : petroleum ether) to give (5-benzyloxy-biphenyl-3-yl)-acetic acid ethyl ester (0.12g, 0.35mmol) as a colourless gum in 48% yield. *H NMR (CDC13) 8 7.59-7.54 (m, 2H), 7.48-7.30 (m, 8H), 7.13-7.11 (m, 2H), 6.94-6.91 (m, 1H), 5.12 (s, 2H), 4.16 (q, 2H), 3.64 (s, 2H), 1.27 (t, 3H).<br>

Example 67: Demonstration of CNS penetration<br>
In-vivo Study:	A total number of 24 mice (C57) were dosed orally at 100 mg/kg of<br>
drug compound in 10% propylene glycol, 7.5% ethanol and 82.5% solutol. At designated times (2, 4 and 8 hrs), a group of eight mice were sacrificed, and plasma and brain tissue samples were collected by following the NIH guideline.<br>
Bioanalytical:	Plasma samples were prepared as follows.    Two hundred<br>
microliters of acetonitrile containing internal standard was added to 100 ^L of plasma to precipitate proteins. After vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min and supernatants were transferred to HPLC sample vials for analysis by LC-MS-MS. Calibration standards were prepared by adding appropriate volumes of drug stock solution directly into blank plasma (from untreated animals) and processed identically to collected plasma samples.<br>
Brain tissues were first homogenized in two-volume of PBS buffer (e. g. 100 mg tissue in 200 fxL PBS). Two hundred microliters of acetonitrile containing internal standard was added to 100 jiL of tissue homogenants to precipitate proteins. Three replicates were processed for each tissue homogenant. After vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min and supernatants were transferred to HPLC sample vials for analysis by LC-MS-MS. Calibration standards were prepared by adding appropriate volumes of stock solution directly into blank brain tissue homogenant (from untreated animals) and processed identically to collected plasma samples<br><br>
LC-MS-MS analysis was performed on operated in ESI positive ion mode. A generic LC gradient was utilized as 95 % aqueous to 95% acetonitrile on a Sciex 4000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer interfaced to an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. The mass spectrometer was over 11 minutes.<br>
Under the above conditions the % ratio of brain to plasma concentration was 28.6 for (R*)-2-(5-benzyloxy-4'-trifluoromethyl-biphenyl-3-yl)-pentanoic acid and 32.0 for (S*)-2-(5-benzyloxy-4'-trifluoromethyl-biphenyl-3-yl)-pentanoicacid.<br>
Example 68: Demonstration of in vivo efficacy<br>
AP42 lowering agents of the invention can be used to treat AD in mammal such as a human or alternatively in a validated animal model such as the mouse, rat, or guinea pig. The mammal may not be diagnosed with AD, or may not have a genetic predisposition for AD, but may be transgenic such that it overproduces and eventually deposits A(3 in a manner similar to that seen in the human.<br>
Ap42 lowering agents can be administered in any standard form using any standard method. For example, but not limited to, Ap42 lowering agents can be in the form of liquid, tablets or capsules that are taken orally or by injection. Ap42 lowering agents can be administered at any dose that is sufficient to significantly reduce levels of AP42 in the blood plasma, CSF, or brain.<br>
To determine whether acute administration of an AP42 lowering agent would reduce Ap42 levels in-vivo, two-three month old Tg2576 mice expressing APP695 containing the "Swedish" variant can be used or alternatively a transgenic mouse model developed by Dr. Fred Van Leuven (K.U.Leuven, Belgium) and co-workers, with neuron-specific expression of a clinical mutant of the human amyloid precursor protein [V7171] (Moechars et al., 1999<br>
J. Biol. Chem. 274, 6483). The commercial rights on this model have been transferred to<br>
reMYND NV. The single transgenic mouse displays spontaneous, progressive accumulation of p-amyloid (AP) in brain, eventually resulting in amyloid plaques within subiculum, hippocampus and cortex. Animals of this age have high levels of Ap in the brain but no detectable Ap deposition. Mice treated with the AP42 lowering agent will be<br><br>
examined and compared to those untreated or treated with vehicle and brain levels of soluble A(342 and total A[3 would be quantitated by standard techniques, for example, using ELISA. Treatment periods may vary from hours to days and will be adjusted based on the results of the AP42 lowering once a time course of onset of effect can be established.<br>
A typical protocol for measuring Ap42 lowering in vivo is shown but it is only one of many variations that could be used to optimize the levels of detectable Ap. For example, Aliquots of compounds can be dissolved in DM SO (volume equal to 1/1 Oth of the final formulation volume), vortexed and further diluted (1:10) with a 10 % (w/v) hydroxypropyl P cyclodextrin (HBC, Aldrich, Ref N° 33,260-7) solution in PBS, where after they are sonicated for 20 seconds.<br>
Ap42 lowering agents may be administered as a single oral given three-four hours before sacrifice and analysis or alternatively could be given over a course of days and the animals sacrificed three to four hours after the final dose is given.<br>
Blood is collected at sacrifice. The blood collection is performed via a heart puncture during anesthesia with a mixture of Ketalar (Ketamin), Rompun (Xylazin 2%) and Atropin (2:1:1) and collected in EDTA treated collection tubes. Blood is centrifiiged at 4000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C and the plasma recovered for analysis.<br>
The mice are anaesthetized with a mixture of Ketalar (Ketamin), Rompun (Xylazin 2%) and Atropin (2:1:1) and flushed trans-cardially with physiological serum at 4°C.<br>
The brain is removed from the cranium and hindbrain and forebrain are separated with a cut in the coronal/frontal plane. The cerebellum is removed. The forebrain is divided evenly into left and right hemisphere by using a midline sagital cut.<br>
One hemisphere is immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until homogenization for biochemical assays.<br>
Brains are homogenized using a Potter, a glass tube (detergent free, 2 cm3) and a mechanical homogenizer (650 rpm). A volume of 6,5 x V£ brain weight of freshly prepared 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8,5) with Proteinase Inhibitors (1 tablet per 50 ml Tris/HCl buffer, CompleteTM, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) is used as homogenization buffer.<br><br>
Samples are transferred from -70°C into a sample holder with liquid nitrogen and each individual sample is pre-warmed by incubation on the bench for a few seconds prior to homogenization. The homogenates are collected in Beckman centrifuge tubes TLX and collected on ice prior to centrifugation. Between two samples, the Potter and the glass tube are rinsed carefully with distilled water (AD) without detergents and dried with absorption paper.<br>
Samples are centrifiiged in a pre-cooled ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Mannheim, Germany) for 1 hour and 20 minutes at 48000 rpm (135.000 x g) at 4°C. The supernatant (soluble fraction containing secreted APP and amyloid peptides) is separated from the pellet (membrane fraction containing membrane-bound APP-fragments and plaque-associated amyloid peptides in case of aged mice).<br>
Small reversed phase columns (C18-Sep-Pack Vac 3cc cartridges, Waters, Massachusetts, MA) are mounted on a vacuum system and washed with 80% acetonitrile in 0,1% Trifluoroacetic acid (A-TFA) followed with 0,1% TFA twice. Then the samples are applied and the columns are washed successively with 5% and 25% A-TFA. Amyloid peptides are eluted with 75% A-TFA and the eluates are collected in 2 ml tubes on ice. Eluates are freeze-dried in a speedvac concentrator (Savant, Farmingdale, NY) overnight and resolved in 240 f_il of the sample diluent furnished with the ELISA kits.<br>
To quantify the amount of human Ap-42 in the soluble fraction of the brain homogenates, commercially available Enzyme-Linked-Immunosorbent-Assay (ELISA) kits are used (h Amyloid [342 ELISA high sensitive, The Genetics Company, Zurich, Switzerland). The ELISA is performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the standard (a dilution of synthetic Api-42) and samples are prepared in a 96-well polypropylene plate without protein binding capacity (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany). The standard dilutions with final concentrations of 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.3 and 15.6 pg/ml and the samples are prepared in the sample diluent, furnished with the ELISA kit, to a final volume of 60 \il. Samples, standards and blancs (50 fil) are added to the anti-Ap-coated polystyrol plate (capture antibody selectively recognizes the C-terminal end of the antigen) in addition with a selective anti-Ap-antibody conjugate (biotinylated detection antibody) and incubated overnight at 4°C in order to allow formation of the antibody-Amyloid-antibody-complex. The following day, a Streptavidine-Peroxidase-Conjugate is added, followed 30 minutes later by an addition of TMB/peroxide mixture, resulting in the<br><br>
conversion of the substrate into a colored product. This reaction is stopped by the addition of sulfuric acid (1M) and the color intensity is measured by means of photometry with an ELISA-reader with a 450 nm filter. Quantification of the Abeta content of the samples is obtained by comparing absorbance to a standard curve made with synthetic Api-42.<br>
In such a model at least 20% Ap42 lowering compared to untreated animals would be advantageous.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
