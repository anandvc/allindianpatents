BACILLUS   PROTEASES<br>
FIELD  OF   INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to detergent proteases obtainable from strains of Bacillus sp. More specifically, the invention is directed towards a novel alkaline protease derived from a strain of Bacillus sp. ZI 315. Moreover  the invention is directed towards a process for the preparation of the protease, the use of the protease as a detergent enzyme, and detergent compositions comprising the protease of the in¬vention.<br>
BACKGROUND   OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
Detergent enzymes have been marketed for more than 2 0 years and are now well established as normal detergent in¬gredients in both powder and liquid detergents all over the world.<br>
Enzymes used in washing formulations comprise many different enzymes such as proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, as well as other enzymes, or mixtures hereof. Commercially  the  most   important  enzymes   are   the  proteases.<br>
Detergent proteases have been developed by isolation of proteases found in nature followed by testing in detergent formulations. Most detergent proteases are obtained from members  of   the  genus  Bacillus.<br>
Examples of commercial protease products are AL-CALASE'", ESPERASE™ and SAVINASE™, all supplied by Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark. The ALCALASE™ protease is produced by strains of the species Bacillus licheniformis. The ESPERASE™ and SAVINASE™ proteases are obtained by cultivation of strains of alkalo-philic  Bacilli.<br>
The washing traditions, especially the used washing temperature, the hardness of the used water, and the ingredi¬ents of the detergents vary very much from one country to another.   Typical  conditions  are  outlined  below:<br><br>
-	low  pH  and  low  water  hardness:   liquid  detergents   in  US  and Asia;<br>
-	low  pH  and  high  water  hardness:   liquid  detergents  in  Europe;<br>
-	high  pH  and  low  water  hardness:   powder  detergents   in  US  and Asia;   and<br>
-	high  pH  and  high  water  hardness:  powder  detergents  in  Europe.<br>
(A low pH in detergents is typically a pH in the range 8.0-9.5, in particular around 9; a high pH in detergents is typically a pH in the range 10-11.5, in particular around 10.5. A low water hardness is typically in the range 3-6°dH; a high water hardness is typically in the range 15-20 °dH, in particular around  18°dH).<br>
Furthermore, the compositions of the detergents are changing these years in order to make the washing process more snvironmental friendly. All these differences and changes Aitkin the detergent industry make the field extremely compli-ated. There is therefore a need all the time to find new proteases which perform optimally at a certain specified set of  conditions .<br>
SUMMARY  OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide lovely detergent proteases with improved washing performance at moderate  to  low  wash  temperatures.<br>
Accordingly, in its first aspect, the invention provides  a  protease  characterized  by:<br>
-	having immunochemical properties identical or partially<br>
identical to those of a protease derived from the strain<br>
3acillus   sp.   ZI   315,   DSM   9702.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention relates to an .solvated biologically pure culture of a strain of Bacillus sp. represented by the strain Bacillus sp. ZI 315. In a more specific aspect, the invention relates to a strain of Bacillus ;p.   ZI   315,   DSM  9702,   or  a  mutant  or  a  variant   thereof.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In a third aspect, the invention provides a process for the preparation of the protease, which process comprises cultivation of a protease producing strain of Bacillus sp. ZI 315 in a suitable nutrient medium, containing carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, followed by recovery of the desired enzyme. In a more specific aspect. Bacillus sp. ZI 315, DSM 9702, or a mutant or a variant thereof, or another host organism carrying the gene encoding a protease having immunochemical properties identical or partially identical to those of the protease derived from Bacillus sp. ZI 315, is cultivated.<br>
In a fourth aspect, the enzyme is used as a detergent enzyme. In more specific aspects, the invention provides detergent compositions and detergent additives comprising the protease.<br>
In a fifth aspect, the invention provides a washing process comprising addition of the protease.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a protease having immunochemical properties identical or partially identical to those of a protease derived food the strain Bacillus sp. U 315, DSM 9702, said process comprising the steps of cultivating a protease producing strain of Bacillus sp ZI 315, DSM 9702 or a mutant or a radiant thereof  in a suitable nutrient medium, containing carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts and recovery said protease in a known manner.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by reference to the iccompanying drawings, in which;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Fig. 2 shows the relation between pH and the proteolytic activity of an enzyme according to the invention (the enzyme preparation obtained according to Ex. 1, with 1% of casein as substrate and at 35*^0).<br>
DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Microorganism<br>
The novel microorganism of the invention, able to produce an enzyme<br>
of the invention, is represented by the strain that was isolated from a sample<br>
of soil. Bacillus sp. ZI 315 has been deposited according to the Budapest<br>
Treaty on the	<br><br>
International Recognition of the Deposits of Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedures, on 30 January 1995 at DSM -Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH -under  Accession  No.   DSM  9702.<br>
The microorganism of this invention is an aerobic, alkaliphilic, spore forming bacterium belonging to the genus Bacillus. Morphologically it can be described as Gram+, motile rods with a diameter of 0.6 - 0.9 micron, and a length of 1.5 -3 micron. The spores (which occur rarely) are ellipsoid, central   to  subterminal,   swelling  the   sporangium.<br>
Optimum  temperature   for  growth   is   within   3 0   -   40°C, with  no  growth  at  50°C,   and  optimal  pH  for  growth  is  within  9   -10,   with  good  growth  at  pH  10.0  and  no  growth  at  pH  7.0,   which makes  the  strain  strictly  alkaliphilic.<br>
The microorganism forms yellow to orange colonies,<br>
round and smooth, on alkaline nutrient agar slants, and no<br>
diffusion  of  pigment   into  the  agar  is  observed.	'<br>
Bacillus sp. ZI 315 has been identified as a new species within group 1 of the genus Bacillus. Full 16S rDNA sequence analysis showed that Bacillus sp. ZI 315 is closest-related to Bacillus firmus. Bacillus circulans, and Bacillus benzoevorans; it branches further away from other alkaliphilic species of group 1 such as Bacillus cohnii and Bacillus halmapalus. ZI 315 branches away from and shows significant physiological differences to its closest phylogenetic relatives and. are for these reasons considered to be a new species within group  1  of  the  genus  Bacillus.<br>
Cultivation  of  the  Microorganism<br>
The microorganism of the invention can be cultivated under aerobic conditions in a nutrient medium containing assimilable carbon and nitrogen together with other essential nutrients, the medium being composed in accordance with the principles  of  the  known  art.<br>
Suitable carbon sources are carbohydrates such as sucrose, glucose and starch, or carbohydrate containing materials such as cereal grain, malt, rice and sorghum. The carbohydrate  concentration  incorporated  in  the  medium  may  vary<br><br>
widely, e.g. up to 25% and down to 1 - 5%, but usually 8 - 10% Will be suitable, the percentages being calculated as equi¬valents  of  glucose.<br>
The nitrogen source in the nutrient medium may be of .inorganic and/or organic nature. Suitable inorganic nitrogen sources are nitrates and ammonium salts. Among the organic nitrogen sources quite a number are used regularly in fermenta¬tion processes involving the cultivation of bacteria. Illustra¬tive examples are soybean meal, cotton seed meal, peanut meal, casein, corn, corn steep liquor, yeast extract, urea, and albumin. In addition, the nutrient medium should also contain usual  trace  substances.<br>
The novel Bacillus species of this invention are slightly alkalophilic. Therefore, the cultivation is preferably conducted at alkaline pH values, which can be obtained by addition of suitable buffers such as sodium carbonate, pH 9 . 0 -10.5, after sterilization of the growth medium. For cultiva¬tion in tank fermentors it is necessary to use artificial aeration. The rate of aeration is similar to that used in conventional   tank  fermentation.<br>
After fermentation, liquid enzyme concentrates may be produced by removal of coarse material from the broth or, if desired, concentration of the broth by, e.g., evaporation at low temperature or by reverse osmosis. Finally, preservatives may  be  added  to  the  concentrate.<br>
Solid enzyme preparations may be prepared from the purified and/or concentrated broth by precipitation with salts, such as NajSO^ or water-miscible solvents, such as ethanol or acetone. Removal of the water in the broth by suitable drying methods,   such  as  spray-drying,   may  also  be  employed.<br>
Assay  for  Proteolytic  Activity<br>
The proteolytic activity is determined with casein as substrate. One Casein Protease Unit (CPU) is defined as the amount of enzyme liberating 1 mM of primary amino groups (determined by comparison with a serine standard) per minute under standard conditions, i.e. incubation for 3 0 minutes at 25°C   and  pH   9.5).   A   folder   AF   228,   describing   the   analytical<br><br>
mecnod,   is  available  upon  request  to  Novo  Nordisk  A/S,   Denmark, which  folder  is  hereby  included  by  reference.<br>
The  Enzyme<br>
The enzyme of the invention is a novel detergent protease. It is obtainable by cultivation of a microorganism of the invention, preferably Bacillus sp. ZI 315, DSM 9702, or a mutant or a variant thereof, in a suitable nutrient medium, containing carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts. The enzyme   can  also  be  obtained  by  recombinant  DNA-technology.<br>
The protease of the invention may be characterized by the  physical-chemical  properties  described  below.<br>
Physical-Chemical  Properties<br>
A molecular weight of 3 8 kD, determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
A pi at above 9.3 could be determined by isoelectric focusing<br>
on LKB Ampholine® PAG plates. The protease activity is<br>
inhibited by PMSF, a-1-antitrypsin, and Turkey-egg-white<br>
proteinase inhibitor. EDTA and soybean-protein inhibitor do not<br>
influence  the  protease  activity.	•<br>
The temperature activity relationship was determined with 1% of casein as substrate and at pH 9.5. The assay for proteolytic activity described previously was used with the modification that the incubation temperature was varied in the interval  of  from  10°C  to  70°C.<br>
The result is shown in Fig. 1. It appears from the figure that the enzyme possesses proteolytic activity from temperatures below 10°C to about 50°C, and has a temperature optimum  at   around  4 0°C.<br>
The dependence of activity on pH was determined by the same procedure using Britten-Robinson buffers adjusted to predetermined  pH  values  in  the  pH  range  of   from  6   to  11.<br>
The result is shown in Fig. 2. It appears from this figure that the enzyme possesses proteolytic activity at pH values below 6 to above 11 with a pH optimum in the range of from  pH  9   to  pH  11.<br><br>
The protease of the invention possesses especial potentials in detergents with low water hardness and moderate :o  low  wash  temperatures.<br>
Emmunochemical  Properties<br>
The protease of the invention has immunochemical sroperties identical or partially identical (i.e. at least martially identical) to those of a protease derived from the strain  Bacillus   sp.   ZI   315,   DSM  9702.<br>
The immunochemical properties for various Bacillus proteases are indeed a very distinguishing feature: whereas pH-)ptimum, temperature-optimum, pi etc. as disclosed above are lore or less the same, different immunochemical properties result   in  very  different   stability  in  various  detergents.<br>
The immunochemical properties can be determined .mmunologically by cross-reaction identity tests. The identity :ests can be performed by the well-known Ouchterlony double .mmunodiffusion procedure or by tandem crossed immujioelectro-)horesis according to N. H. Axelsen; Handbook of Immuno-&gt;recipitation-in-Gel Techniques; Blackwell Scientific Publica-:ions (1983), chapters 5 and 14. The terms "antigenic identity" md "partial antigenic identity" are described in the same took,   chapters   5,   19   and  20.<br>
Monospecific antiserum was generated according to the .bove mentioned method by immunizing rabbits with the purified irotease of the invention. The immunogen was mixed with 'reund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into rabbits very second week. Antiserum was obtained after a total mmunization period of 8 weeks, and immunoglobulin was prepared herefrom  as  described  by  N.   H.   Axelsen,   supra.<br>
Using the ouchterlony double immunodiffusion test escribed above the protease of the invention showed no cross eaction  to  the  known  serine  proteases:<br>

Various Bacillus proteases tolerate various deter¬gents with a great variety, and one of the best tools today in differentiating between Bacillus proteases is the immunoche¬mical  identity  tool.<br>
Detergent  Compositions<br>
According to the invention, the protease may typical¬ly be a component of a detergent composition, e.g., a dish¬washing or a laundry detergent composition. As such, it may be included in the detergent composition in the form of a non-dusting granulate, a stabilized liquid, or a protected enzyme. Non-dusting granulates may be produced, e.g., as disclosed in US 4,106,991 and 4,661,452 (both to Novo Industri A/S) and may optionally be coated by methods known in the art. Examples of waxy coating materials are poly(ethylene oxide) products (polyethyleneglycol, PEG) with mean molecular weights of 1000 to 20000; ethoxylated nonylphenols having from 16 to 50 ethylene oxide units; ethoxylated fatty alcohols in which the alcohol contains from 12 to 20 carbon atoms and in which there are 15 to 80 ethylene oxide units; fatty alcohols; fatty acids; and mono- and di- and triglycerides of fatty acids. Examples of film-forming coating materials suitable for application by fluid bed techniques are given in patent GB 1483591. Liquid enzyme preparations may, for instance, be stabilized by adding a polyol such as propylene glycol, a sugar or sugar alcohol, lactic acid or boric acid according to established methods. Dther  enzyme  stabilizers  are  well   known  in  the  art.   Protected<br><br>
enzymes  may be  prepared  according  to  the  method  disclosed  in  EP 238,216.<br>
The detergent composition of the invention may be in any convenient form, e.g. as powder, granules, paste or liquid. A liquid detergent may be aqueous, typically containing up to 70%  water  and  0-30%  organic  solvent,   or  nonaqueous.<br>
The detergent composition comprises one or more surf¬actants, each of which may be anionic, nonionic, cationic, or zwitterionic. The detergent will usually contain 0-50% of anionic surfactant such as linear alkylbenzenesulfonate (LAS), alpha-olefinsulfonate (AOS), alkyl sulfate (fatty alcohol sulfate) (AS), alcohol ethoxysulfate (AEOS or AES), secondary allcanesulfonates (SAS) , alpha-sulfo fatty acid methyl esters, alkyl- or alkenylsuccinic acid, or soap. It may also contain 0-4 0% of nonionic surfactant such as alcohol ethoxylate (AEO or AE), carboxylated alcohol ethoxylates, nonylphenol ethoxylate, alkylpolyglycoside, alkyldimethylamine oxide, ethoxylated fatty acid monoethanolamide, fatty acid monoethanolamide, or polyhydroxy alkyl fatty acid amide (e.g. as described in WO 92/06154)  .<br>
The detergent composition may additionally comprise one or more other enzymes, such as amylase, lipase, cutinase, cellulase,   peroxidase,   and  oxidase,   e.g.,   laccase.<br>
The detergent may contain 1-65% of a detergent builder or complexing agent such as zeolite, diphosphate, triphosphate, phosphonate, citrate, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetri-aminepentaacetic acid (DTMPA), alkyl- or alkenylsuccinic acid, soluble silicates or layered silicates (e.g. SKS-6 from Hoechst). The detergent may also be unbuilt, i.e. essentially free  of  detergent  builder.<br>
The detergent may comprise one or more polymers. Examples are carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), poly(vinyl-pyrrolidone) (PVP), polyethyleneglycol (PEG), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), polycarboxylates such as polyacrylates, maleic/acrylic acid copolymers and lauryl methacrylate/acrylic acid  copolymers.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
16)	Detergent formulations as described in 1) - 15) which<br>
contain a stabilized or encapsulated peracid, either as an<br>
additional component or as a substitute for already specified<br>
bleach  systems.<br>
17)	Detergent compositions as described in 1), 3), 7), 9) and 12)   wherein  perborate  is  replaced  by  percarbonate.<br>
18)	Detergent compositions as described in 1) , 3), 7), 9), 12) , 14) and 15) which additionally contain a manganese catalyst. The manganese catalyst may, e.g., be one of the compounds described in "Efficient manganese catalysts for low-temperature bleaching",   Nature   369.   1994,   pp.   637-639.<br>
19)	Detergent composition formulated as a nonaqueous detergent liquid comprising a liquid nonionic surfactant such as, e.g., linear alkoxylated primary alcohol, a builder system (e.g. phosphate), enzyme and alkali. The detergent may also comprise anionic  surfactant  and/or  a  bleach  system.<br>
The protease of the invention may be incorporated in concentrations conventionally employed in detergents. It is at present contemplated that, in the detergent composition of the invention, the protease may be added in an amount corresponding to 0.00001-1 mg (calculated as pure enzyme protein) of protease per  liter  of  wash  liquor.<br>
The invention is further illustrated in the following examples, which are not intended to be in any way limiting to the  scope  of  the  invention  as  claimed.<br>
EXAMPLE   1<br>
Bacillus sp. ZI 315, DSM 9702, was cultivated at 30°C on a rotary shaking table (300 r.p.m.) in 500 ml baffled Erlen-meyer flasks containing 100 ml of medium of the following composition   (per  litre)  -.<br>
Potato  starch	100       g<br>
Ground  barley	50       g<br><br>
Soybean  flour	20	g<br>
NajHPO,  X  12  H2O	9	g<br>
Pluronic®	0.1	g<br>
Sodium  caseinate	10	q<br>
5	The  starch  in  the  medium  is  liquified  with  a-amylase,<br>
and-  the    medium    is    sterilized    by    heating    at    120°C    for    45 minutes.<br>
After  sterilization  the  pH  of  the  medium  is  adjusted to    9.7    by   addition    of    10    ml    of    a    1    M    solution   of    sodium 0  sesquicarbonate.<br>
After cultivation (3 days) and separation of the solid material the protease was purified by a conventional chromatographic  method.<br>
Yield  from  1.5   1   of   culture  broth  was   50   ml   with  70 5  CPU/1.   Purity  was  more  than  90%  as   judged  by  SDS-PAGE.<br>
The characteristics of the preparation prepared in accordance with this Example have been referred to earlier in this  specification,   and  reference  is  made  hereto.<br>
EXAMPLE   2<br>
0  Wash  Performance  of  Bacillus  sp.   ZI   315  protease   (at   20°C)<br>
The wash performance tests were accomplished on grass juice soiled cotton, in a model wash system at 20°C, at a constant   temperature   for  10  minutes.<br>
The   tests   were  performed  at  protease   concentrations 5  of   1.6,    3.2,   8,   16,   32,    64   and   160   nM.<br>
2.0 g/1 of an American type powder detergent composi¬tion were used in the test. The detergent did not contain any enzymes prior to the addition of the protease of the invention. The detergent was dissolved in approx. 6°dH (German Hardness) 0 water. The pH of the wash liquor was 10. The textile/wash liquor ratio was approximately 5 g of textile per litre of wash liquor. For each enzyme concentration two independent tests were  performed.<br>
Subsequent   to   the   fabric   washing,    the   cloths   were 5  flushed  in  running  tap  water  for  20  minutes  and  then  air-dried.<br><br>
The performance of the protease of the invention and of Savinase™ was assessed by the change (AR) of the remission (%R) at 460 nm measured on a Datacolor Elrephometer 2000, AR being the remission after wash with protease added, minus the remission  after  wash  with  no  protease  added.<br>
The  results  of  these  tests  are  shown  in  Table  1  below (mean  of  2   tests)  .<br>

It can be seen from Table 1 that AR (Bacillus sp. ZI 315) is higher than AR (Savinase™) at all the measured protease concentrations, i.e. the protease of the invention has a better wash  performance  at  all  the  measured  concentrations  at  20°C.<br>
EXAMPLE   3<br>
Wash  Performance  of  Bacillus   sp.   ZI   315  protease   (at   25°C)<br>
The  wash performance  tests  were  accomplished  on  grass<br>
juice   soiled   cotton,    in   a   model   wash   system   at    25°C,    at   a<br>
constant  temperature  for  10  minutes.<br>
The   tests  were  performed  at  protease   concentrations<br>
of   1,   2,   7.5,   and  20   nM.<br>
2.0  g/1  of  a  detergent  with  the  following  composition<br><br>
Linear  alkylbenzenesulfonate<br>
Alcohol  ethoxylate<br>
Soap<br>

NajCOj	0.4        g/1<br>
Zeolith	0.6       g/i<br>
Naj-citrate	0.08     g/1<br>
Carboxymethylcellulose	0.006  g/1<br>
Polycarboxylate	0.083  g/1<br>
were used in the test. The detergent was dissolved in approx. 6°dH (German Hardness) water. The pH of the wash liquor was adjusted to pH 10. The textile/wash liquor ratio was approxi¬mately 5 g of textile per litre of wash liquor. For each enzyme concentration  two   independent   tests  were  performed.<br>
Subsequent to the fabric washing, the cloths were flushed in running tap water for 20 minutes and then air-dried. The performance of the protease of the invention and of Savinase™ was assessed by the change (AR) of the remission (%R) at 460 nm measured on a Datacolor Elrephometer 2000, AR being the remission after wash with protease added, minus the remission  after  wash  with  no  protease  added.<br>
The  results  of  these  tests  are  shown  in  Table  2  below (mean  of   2   tests).<br>
Table   2<br><br>

It can be seen from Table 2 that AR (Bacillus sp. ZI 315) is higher than AR (Savinase™) at all the measured protease concentrations, i.e. the protease of the invention has a better wash  performance  at  all  the  measured  concentrations  at   25°C.<br>
EXAMPLE  4<br>
Improvement   factor/Model  detergents<br><br>
An improvement factor (defined below) for the protease of the invention was established at low and high water hardness, using a model detergent at pH 9 with Savinase as reference.<br>
The improvement factor was determined in the follow¬ing  way:<br>
Measurement of remission (R) on a test material (grass on cotton) was done at 460 nm using an Elrepho 2000 photometer (without UV). The measured values were fitted to the expression:<br>
R  =   (a   •   AR„,^   •   c)/(AR„3^  +  a   •    c)   +  b.<br>
The improvement factor (IF) is then calculated by use of  the  initial  slope  of  the  curve:<br>
IF  =  a/a^gf,-wherein<br>
R:	is  the  wash  effect  of  the  enzyme  in  remission  units,<br>
a:	is  the   initial  slope  of  the  fitted  curve,<br>
aj-ef:	is  the  initial  slope   for  the  reference  enzyme,<br>
b:	is   the   intersection  of   the   fitted   curve   and  the   y-<br>
axis,<br>
c:	is    the    enzyme    concentration    in    nanomoles    active<br>
enzyme  per  liter,   and<br>
AR^^:	is  the  theoretical  maximum  wash  effect  of  the  enzyme<br>
in  remission  units.<br>
The   following  experimental  conditions  were  used:<br>
Detergent:	25%  STP   (NajFjOio),<br>
2 5% NajSO^ 10% NajCOj 20%   LAS    (Nansa   803)<br>
5%  NI   (Dobanol   25-7)<br>
5%  NazSijOj<br>
0.5%  CMC   (carboxymethylcellulose)<br>
9.5%  water<br><br>
pH:	9.0<br>
Washing  time:	15  min.<br>
Washing  temperature:	15°C<br>
Water  hardness:	6°dH  and  18°dH<br>
Enzyme   concentrations:	0,   3,   6,   9,   15,   30   and  60   nM<br>
Swatch/volume:	5   swatches   (Diameter:   2.5   cm)   per<br>
50  ml  washing  solution<br>
Test  material:	Grass  on  cotton.<br>
The  following  results  were  obtained:<br>
IF  =  4.8,   when  the  water  hardness  was   6°dH,   and<br>
IF  =  1.4,   when  the  water  hardness  was   18°dH.	,<br>
This example shows that the protease of the invention would be very useful in a liquid detergent (low pH) for use in US and Asia, (where the water hardness is low; around or less than  6°dH).<br>
EXAMPLE   5<br>
&gt;<br>
Improvement  factor/Commercial  detergents<br>
Improvement factors, obtained as explained in Example 4, were also established for the commercial detergents Koso Tpp and Omo Powder China, again with Savinase as the reference enzyme.<br>
The   following  experimental   conditions  were  used:<br>
Detergent  dose:	1  g/1<br>
pH:	10.5    (Koso  Top)   and<br>
10.2    (Omo  Powder  China)<br>
Washing  time:	15  min.<br>
Washing  temperature:        15°C<br>
Water  hardness:	3°dH<br>
Enzyme  concentrations:   3,   6,   9,   15,   3 0   and  6 0  nM<br>
Swatch/volume:	5   swatches   (Diameter:   2.5   cm)   per<br>
50  ml  washing  solution<br><br>
Test  material:	Grass  on  cotton.<br>
The  following results  were obtained: IF  =  2.1   (Koso Top),   and IF  =  3.1   (Omo  Powder China)<br>
/	This example shows that the protease of the invention<br>
would   be   very   useful   in   detergents   with   high   pH   for   use   in Asia,    (where  the  water hardness   is   low,   around  3°dH).<br>
