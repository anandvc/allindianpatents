				<td>The present invention relates generally to the field of mobile communication devices.  More specifically, the present invention is related to anonymously testing proximity between mobile users without revealing individual phase space coordinates.<br>
Discussion of Prior Art<br>
Application Service Providers (ASP's) are increasingly offering a myliad of services over various networks.  Many of these services make use of a user's location data to provide targeted user-specific information.<br>
A specific implementation of such a service is a location-based service that requires detecting and reporting the relative proximity of two or more users.  There exists a multitude of Wireless Service Providers (WSPs) that the able deliver Location Tracking Services (LTSs) (or they may allow users to subscribe to a multitude of such LTSs).  Since individuals may wish or need to be aware of their proximity to users subscribing to different service providers, information must be exchanged between the different service providers to detect proximity.  Exchanging an individual's location data is undesirable, as it exposes the user to potential threats with regard to his/her privacy.  By the same token, not exchanging the data severely diminishes the utility of such location-based services.<br>
A brief description of prior art in the area of location-based services is provided below, but it should be noted that the prior art fail to provide for a system or method to anonymously test for the proximity of users without exchanging their location coordinates.<br>
A prior art solution concerning the exchange of a user's location data involves encrypting the location data and sharing such encrypted data between the wireless service providers. This solution, however, has some major disadvantages, some of which are outlined below:<br>
1)    Management of the public key encryption is complex - especially given the rate of queries and proximity calculations required.  An individual wireless provider may have millions of clients, and each of<br><br><br>
these clients may wish to be alerted to the proximity of users of dozens of other wireless services.<br>
2)    Assuming the wireless providers exchange the information protected by encryptions, at some point the other service providers will be in possession of the location data for non-subscribing users.  This requires that users trust every wireless provider (whether they are subscribers or not) to control access to this data.  The system and method of the present invention eliminates this problem by avoiding the sharing of sensitive data .<br>
The published patent application to Doi et al. (US 2001/0014911 Al) provides for a method and system for providing services wherein a trusted service provider provides service information dependent on location information of a mobile terminal to the mobile terminal in response to a service request with the location information sent by the mobile terminal.<br>
Doi et al., however', fail to address privacy concerns in the communication between multiple instances of such services.<br>
The publisned patent application to Kinnunen et al. (US 2001/0018349 Al) provides for location-dependent services.  Disclosed is a location-based system (LBS) for providing location-dependent services to a plurality of mobile terminals within a coverage area.<br>
The published patent application to Watson (US 2002/0026517 Al) enables communications of electronic data between an information requestor and a geographically proximate service provider.  Disclosed is a method tor transferring electronic data comprising: receiving a request to access a communications system at a first geographical location from a client located at a second geographical remote from the first geographical location; identifying a proxy local to the client in the second geographical location; and receiving subsequent data requests from the client at the proxy.  Watson, however, fails to disclose a third-party anonymous function evaluation service.  Additionally, Watson requires trust and knowledge between the service providers.<br>
The PCT publication to Huber et al. (WO 0079811 A2) provides for a method and system for offering mobile subscribers anonymous, Location-based services.  Disclosed is a method wherein a user, who has his/her own trusted service provider, picks one or more services he/she is interested in ami sends his/her location to the trusted service provider, whereupon the1 service provider gets the location of the service and<br><br>
performs a range query.  Thus, the service provider researches locations for services (for example, the yellow pages).  The PCT publication to Lammi et al. (WO 0128273 Al) provides for a similar recitation.<br>
The publifjhed patent application to Hunzinger (US 2002/001173 Al) provides for communication of location information in a wireless communication system.  Disclosed is a mobile station, such as a cellular or PCS phone, in a wireless communication system which transmits position information to the system server.  The mobile station may communicate position location arid movement tracking information between the mobile station and the wireless communication infrastructure.<br>
The U.S. patent: to Drane et al . (U.S. 6,275,705) provides for a location tracking system.  The method allows for finding the position of a mobile radio-frequency transceiver in a communications system. Determination includes the means to use the known distances and measured times to determine the relative time offsets of transmissions from each base station and location means to use the determined relative time offsets and to calculate the position of a mobile transceiver in the network area using hyperbolic positioning techniques.<br>
The PCT punlication to Natarajan et al. (WO 01/65339) provides for an architecture for' providing information to devices wherein, the architecture comprises a data collector, an information server, an evaluation mechanism, and an action handler.  The evaluation mechanism determines if a change occurs in an evaluation of an expression and generates a notification.<br>
The non-patent literature to Herzberg et al. entitled "On Traveling Incognito" discusses solutions to anonymity in mobile environments.  A "frequently changing" aliasing is provided as part of the solution.<br>
Whatever the precise merits, features, and advantages of the above-cited prior art, none of them achieves or fulfills the purposes of the present .invent ion.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
While this invention is illustrated and described in a preferred embodiment, the invention may be produced in many different configurations.  There is depicted in the drawings, and will herein be described in detail, a preferred embodiment of the invention, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of the invention and the associated functional specifications for its construction and is not intended to limit the invent: ion to the embodiment illustrated.  Those skilled in the art will envision many other possible variations within the scope of the present invention.<br>
It should be noted that the term "distance" as used throughout the specification includes not "just physical proximity, but also includes multi-dimensional data such as preference profiles and vectors (e.g., an affinity for baseball, apple pie, ball room dancing, etc.).  Hence, the literal interpretation of the term "distance" should not be used to limit the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
The present, embodiment provides for a system and method to estimate proximity in an arbitrary phase space without exchanging specific preference data.  A generalized example would include proximity estimation in a phase space- defined by n dimensional preference vectors.  Figure 1 illustrates such a scenario, wherein a person's preferences can be represented using orthogonal personal preference components.  A set of preferences associated with an individual is represented using a vector V={pref_..'l, pref..2, ..., pref_n} , wherein pref_i is a scalar measure of a person's like or dislike for some specific property.  One can measure the difference between the profile vectors of two people in exactly the same way one measures the distance in space by sending the orthogonal scalar measures one property at a time.  Proximity between two individuals in this phase space is the difference between the preference vectors associated with each of the individuals.  For example, if user A has a preference vector of V) = {pref_l, pref_.2, ..., pref__n), and user B has a preference vector V;.= {pref_l' ,pref_2 ' , ..., pref_n'}, then the proximity is given by | V..-V-, | .<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the present invention's method for estimating proximity between two mobile users.  In the method in Figure 2, coordinates in a particular phase space and associated functions are sent individually to a third party.  The third party calculates a parameter for each of the received functions and coordinates and .separately forwards each of the estimated parameters to each of the users.  Based upon the received parameters, users are able to perform various computations locally to estimate proximity to other users. For example, a Local computation for distance between two users in a particular multidimensional phase space can be made wherein the phase space is defined by specific preference profiles and vectors (e.g., an affinity for baseball, apple pie, and ballroom dancing).<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a specific example of the present invention's architecture 300 for anonymizing location data.  Architecture 300 comprises: location tracking service A 302, location tracking service B 304, and anonymous function evaluation service (AFES) 306.  Both location tracking service A 302 and B 304 are able to track one or more clients, wherein the location tracking service (LTS) could be provided by a wireless service providers (WSP) or by an independent service provider.  A description of each of the components of architecture 300 is provided below:<br><br>
1.    APES 306:  The present embodiments third-party Anonymous Function Evaluation Service (AFES) receives collections of anonymized floating point values; and by design, it is never able to determine the location of any user of any service.  Therefore, the AFES cannot be corrupted or otherwise compromise the privacy of users of any wireless service.  The AFES simply receives numerical data from the individual wireless services emd performs funct ion evaluation on that data based on the instructions of the respective wireless services.  It responds to the (registered) requesting services with the results of these calculations on the data they submitted (in coordination with other LTSs).  Hence, the AFES never knows the location of any user.  The wireless services are aware of their own user's locations and can deduce the proximity of their users to subscribers of other wireless service providers, but need never share their user locations with other service providers.  Figure 4 provides a detailed architecture of the AFES 306 of Figure 3.  AFES interacts with a multitude of WSPs or LTSs (402, 404, 406) over a protocol such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).  AFES 306 receives numerical data and instructions for function evaluation and returns the results of function evaluations.  Subcomponents of the AFES 306 include:<br>
a     B-B interface 408:  This subcomponent handles communication (via protocols such as HTTP) with various LTSs or other WSPs. B-B interface 408 receives collections, enumerations, or vectors of floating point values.  B-B interface 408 also receives collections of identifying keys for enumerated values and functions to allow collections from separated tracking services to be evaluated together.<br>
b.	Task List 410:  Subcomponent 410 stores a list of tasks and<br>
functions co be evaluated on data.<br>
c.	Data Cache 412:  Subcomponent 412 stores collections or<br>
enumerations of data (floating point numbers) to be processed.<br>
d.	Task Manager 414:  Subcomponent 414 manages the AFES<br>
architecture 306.  Such management includes: (1) receiving<br>
enumerations from B-B interface 408; (2) sending enumerated values<br>
to task list 410 and data cache 412; (3) retrieving data and<br>
evaluation functions from data cache 412; (4) handling<br>
communications with function evaluation engine 416; (5) performing<br>
validity checks on data, evaluation functions, and identifying keys;<br>
(6) catching errors; and (7) sending results of function evaluation<br><br>
engine 416 back to B-B interface 408 for forwarding values to requesting services.<br>
e.    Function Evaluation Engine 416:  Subcomponent 416 evaluates mathematical function(s) on floating point or other data (individually or as a collection, enumeration, or vector).<br>
2.	Location Tracking Service (LTS) 302 and 304: A wireless service<br>
provider in communication with a multitude of clients through cellular or<br>
other wireless network(s).  Figure 5 illustrates subcomponents associated<br>
with the LTS 302 and 304.  A brief description of these subcomponents are<br>
provided below:<br>
a.	Client Profile Database 502:  Subcomponent 502 contains client<br>
ID'S, billing information, location service profile (what services<br>
the client: uses), etc.<br>
b.	Proximity Alert Database 504:  Each client ID specifies what<br>
other cl Lents (or groups or events) they wish to receive alerts<br>
about.  Each alert entry specifies (if necessary) the URL or ID of<br>
foreign location service providers (if not part of the current LTS<br>
system).<br>
c.	System Manager 506: Controls access to the client profile and<br>
proximity databases in response to requests from the B-B interface<br>
510.  System manager 506 manages client data through the client<br>
interface 508.<br>
d.	Client Interface 508:  Subcomponent 508 communicates with<br>
client devices over a network such as a cellular network.  Client<br>
interface 508 receives location data from client devices and sends<br>
that data -:o the system manager 506.<br>
e.	B-B interface 510:  Subcomponent 510 comprises a firewall for<br>
monitoring activity over the World Wide Web (WWW).  The B-B<br>
interface 510 passes requests from other LTS providers to the system<br>
manager 506 and sends requests to other LTS providers.<br>
Additionally, subcomponent 510 handles communications with the AFES ser v .i.ce (si.<br>
3.	Wireless Service Provider.<br><br>
4.	Client:  User of a client device.<br>
5.	Client device:  Wireless devices with native tracking (e.g., GPS).<br>
Alternative]y, the device may be tracked by an LTS provider by the communication or cellular hub the device is in communication with.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a time-line diagram representative of a specific example outlining the various interactions of the components (location tracking service A, location service tracking B, and the anonymous function evaluation service) of the present invention's architecture shown in Figure<br>
It should be understood that the example is provided merely for the purposes of outlining the functionality associated with the components of the architecture of Figure 3.  Hence, the implementation of the present invention should not: be restricted to just examples mentioned in the spec it icat: i on .<br>
The example outlined in Figure 6 is directed to alerting a user, i, if another user, j, is in a proximate region.  The steps shown in the time-line diagram are given below:<br>
S'tep 608:  A request, for the range between users i and j is exchanged between location tracking service A 602 and location service B 604.<br>
Step 610:  In this step, a confirmation is exchanged between location tracking services A 602 and B 604 regarding which parameter is to be first transmitted to AFES.  In the specific example shown, the transmission of the x coordinate (as the first coordinate to be transmitted) is confirmed as the parameter to be transmitted first.<br>
Step 612:  In thi.s step, ari identification is made (by location tracking service A 602 and B 604) with regard to what common function(s) is to be used for evaluation by AFES 606.  In the specific example, AFES 606 is told to expect parameter .. and is expected to return the evaluated function (..-..)  back to location tracking service A 602 and B 604.<br>
Step 614:  A confirmation is sent from AFES 606 to each of the location tracking services A 602 and B 604 regarding the agreed upon function.<br><br>
Step 616:  In this step, as decided upon in step 610, a first parameter is sent from location tracking service A 602 to AFES 606.  In the specific example, parameter x, is sent from location tracking service A 602 to AFES 606 and, similarly, parameter x,- is sent from location tracking service B 604 to AFES 606.<br>
Step 618:  In this step, based upon the agreed upon function, a new parameter is calculated based upon the function and forwarded to location tracking services A 602 and B 604.  In the specific example, the agreed upon function is (.,-. )2, and the result )x2 = (Xj - x,)2 is transmitted to location tracking services A 602 and B 604.<br>
Step 620:  In this step, similar to step 612, an identification is made (by location tracking service A 602 and B 604) with regard to what common function(s) is to be used for evaluation by AFES 606 for the next parameter to be passed.  In the specific example, AFES 606 is told to expect another input parameter ., and, in turn, is expected to return the evaluated function (.;-.;)•' back to location tracking service A 602 and B 604.<br>
Step 622:  This step is similar to the confirmation step 614.<br>
Step 624:  This step is similar to step 616, wherein a new parameters y&gt; and y. are sent to the AFES 606 by location tracking services A 602 and B 604, respectively.<br>
Step 626:  In this step, based upon the agreed upon function, a new parameter is caJciliated based upon the function and forwarded to location tracking services A 602 and B 604.  In the specific example, the agreed upon function is (.:-.-,)! and the result )y2 = (y= - y-)2 is transmitted to Location tracking services A 602 and B 604.<br>
Lastly, a computation is made locally for calculating the distance cased upon the received values )x* and )y2.  Thus, distance R is calculated using [ () x- ) -f () y ) } • • .  After R is computed, an evaluation condition is assessed.  For example, as an estimate of proximity, computed R can be compared to a threshold R" (i.e., is R 
Figures 7-9 collectively illustrate the methods associated with each of the entities in the architecture of Figure 3.  Figure 7 illustrates a<br><br>
flowchart 700 outlining the process associated with the location receiver. In step 705, a location update is received from user A.  Next, in step 710, an evaluation is made if user A has moved.  If user A has not moved, then step 705 is repeated.  On the other hand, if user A has moved, in step 715 a range request is sent to the wireless service provider (WSP) of user B.  In step 725, AFES is notified to expect data; in step 730, coordinate x,: is sent to AFES.  In step 735, a result equal to the difference squared is received.  In step 740, an evaluation is made if there are more coordinates are to be sent and, if so, steps 725 through 740 are repeated for each coordinate.  On the other hand, if no more coordinates are to be sent, the distance calculation is performed to detect the proximity to user B.  Lastly, after the proximity calculation in step 745 is completed, steps 705 through 745 can be repeated to dynamically update proximity information.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a flow diagram 800 of the request handler process.  In step 805, a range request is received from wireless service provider (WSP) of user A; and in step 810, a notification is sent to AFES to expect data.  In step 815, coordinate xn is sent to AFES; in step 820, the distance-squared parameter is received.  In step 825, an evaluation is made if more coordinates are to be sent and, if so, steps 810 through 825 are repeated.  On the other hand, if there are no more coordinates to send, a proximity calculation is initiated to detect the proximity to user A.  After the proximity calculation in step 830, steps 805 through 830 are repeated to dynamically update proximity information.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates a flow diagram 900 outlining the functionality of the AFES.  In step 905, the AFES receives a function evaluation request; in step 910, values from the wireless service provider of user U, are received.  Next, in step 915, an evaluation is made if more data is to be received from wireless service providers.  If so, steps 910 through 915 are repeated.  O:i the other hand, if there is no more data to be received, a function is computed and returned to all appropriate wireless service providers.<br>
Figure 10 .'summarizes a flow diagram outlining the various<br>
interactions between a third party (AFES) 1002 and users A 1004 and B 1006 for the specific' example of calculating proximity based on a calculation of the Euclidean distance between A and B.  In this specific example, the x coordinate;; (x 1008 and x., 1010) and the y coordinates (y, 1012and y,
 <br>
corresponding function (s) (function, 1016 and function-. 1018).  In this example, given x, and x&gt;, function, is calculated based upon R:-iunction, (x,, x )- | x:-x2 '.  Similarly, given y, and y2, function, is calculated based upon R;,= function2 (y/, y?} = y-i-y?. 2.  The results, R, and R2, are calculated based upon the identified evaluation functions and forwarded separately to each of the users (A 1004 and B 1006). Each user is then able to compute the proximity locally.<br>
It should be rioted that the anonymous function evaluation can be accomplished with significantly less communication and confirmation overhead.  The two services would periodically exchange lists of users (IDs) for whom they wish to estimate proximity.  The AFS would be told to expect a collection of floating point numbers from each service and would compute the requested function evaluation on each of these collections (returning a collection of answers).  The randomization of x, y, and z coordinates for users within these collections would also be determined in one communication step between the wireless providers.<br>
As an example, cell phones of users A and B can be equipped with an embedded Java v.i rtual machine such that arbitrary code can be executed locally to compute proximity.  It should, however, be noted that mobile devices can be. equipped with means for implementing code in other higher-level languages, such as C, C++, and the type of language used should not, be used to limit the present invention.  In the specific example of Figure 10, given Rl and R2, users A and B are able to locally calculate the Euclidean distance based upon:  Distance=R= (R: +R;.)'".  This result. Ls locally compared against a pre-determined threshold, t, and if estimated value, R, is within the threshold, t, an alert is issued to A or B.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention includes a computer program code-based product, which is a storage medium having program code stored therein which can be used to instruct a computer to perform any of the methods associated with the present invention.  The computer storage medium includes any of, but is not limited to, the following:  CD-ROM, DVD, magnetic tape, optical disc, hard drive, floppy disk, ferroelectric memory, flash memory, ferromagnetic memory, optical storage, charge coupled devices, magnetic or optical cards, smart cards, EEPROM, EPROM, RAM, ROM, DRAM:, SRAM, SDRAM, or any other appropriate static or dynamic memory or data storage devices.<br>
Implemented in computer program code based products are software modules for assisting a first and second tracking service in anonymizing preference data associated with a first and second user in a phase space (wherein the first and second tracking service track the location of the first and second user respectively and the preference data is defined by one or more? parameters).  The software modules:  (1) aid in the reception of a request for function evaluation from each tracking service, wherein the request identifies a parameter to be transmitted and a corresponding function to be used for evaluating the identified parameter; (2) aid in the transmission of a confirmation to each tracking service indicating that the AFES is awaiting reception of the identified parameter; (3) aid in the reception of the identified parameter from each tracking service; (4) evaluate the corresponding function based on the received parameter from each tracking service; and (5) aid in the transmission of the evaluated result to each tracking service.<br>
