CARBON BLACKS AND USES THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a class of new and useful carbon blacks which are suitable for various applications and particularly well suited for use in polymeric compositions, natural rubbers, synthetic rubbers, elastomers and/or blends or mixtures thereof. The present invention also relates to new and useful polymer compositions (polymers, natural rubbers, synthetic rubbers, elastomers and/or blends or mixtures thereof) which include the carbon blacks.<br>
Carbon blacks are generally produced in a flirnace-type reactor by pyrolyzing a hydrocarbon feedstock with hot combustion gases to produce combustion products containing particulate carbon black.<br>
Carbon blacks may be utilized as pigments, fillers and/or reinforcing agents in polymer compositions.<br>
Carbon blacks may be utilized to impart electrical conductivity and protection from ultraviolet (UV) degradation to polymer compositions. For example, carbon blacks ^re widely used to minimize the degradation of polymer compositions upon exposure to UV radiation. Such UV radiation occurs as a component of natural sunlight.<br>
Carbon blacks are incorporated into the polymer composition through a variety of mixing techniques. For carbon blacks which have acceptable characteristics relating to UV protection, it is generally desirable to utilize those carbon blacks which will provide as low a viscosity as possible, and thus improve the processability of the carbon black-polymer composition mixture. Another desirable feature of carbon blacks used in such applications would be to maximize, to the extent practicable, the relative content of carbon black in the carbon black-polymer composition mixture. In order to minimize the tendency of a plastic composition to.absorb<br><br>
moisture, it is desirable to utilize carbon blacks which possess as low of a compound moisture absorption (CMA) as possible. The CMA is indicative of the moisture absorption capability of the carbon black after it has been compounded into the polymer composition of interest. (<br>
In addition, carbon blacks useful in polymeric compositions are formed into pipes, such as pressure pipes, and require a variety of properties such as, but not limited to, longevity of service life of the pipe, prevention of UV degradation, low extractables, and the like. Finding appropriate carbon blacks that can be used in polymeric compositions for such uses as pipes has been difficult since obtaining a combination of appropriate properties has been difficult.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
A feature of the present invention is to provide carbon blacks which have appropriate properties for use in polymeric compositions such as UV applications like pipe, film, membranes, jacketing, and the like.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the present invention. The objectives and other advantages of the present invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the description and appended claims.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purposes of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention relates to carbon blacks having a iodine number of from about 50 to about 112 mg/g and a primary particle size of about 25 nm or less. The carbon blacks preferably also have an ash content of less than 1%, a<br><br>
total sulfur content of less than 2°/o, or a toluene extract level of less than 1%, a 325 mesh residue of about 200 ppm or less, or a combination of one or more of these additional properties.<br>
Certain of the carbon blacks of the present invention may be further characterized as having a CDBP (dibutyl absorption value of the crushed carbon black) of less than or equal to 102 cubic centimeters DBP per 100 grams of carbon black (cc/100 g). The present invention further provides carbon blacks having an I2 No. of 65-112 mg/g; a primary particle size of less than or equal to 20 nanometers (nm); and a CDBP (dibutyl absorption value of the crushed carbon black) of less than or equal to 102 cubic centimeters DBP per 100 grams of carbon black (cc/100 g). The present invention also provides carbon blacks having an h No. of 50-85 mg/g; a primary particle size of less than or equal to 25 nm; and a CDBP of less than or equal to 96 cc/100 g. The carbon blacks are particularly well suited for use in the production of polymer compositions. Also described and claimed are polymer compositions incorporating the new carbon blacks.<br>
The present invention further relates to polymeric compositions that contain one or more<br>
h ■<br>
types of the carbon blacks of the present invention and at least one polymer.<br>
The present invention further relates to articles formed from the polymeric compositions of the present invention, such as articles used in UV application, pipes, films, membranes, jacketing, and the like.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are intended to provide further explanation of the present invention, as claimed.<br><br>
The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this application, illustrate various aspects of the present invention and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the present invention.<br>

The carbon blacks of the present invention may be produced by any process but are preferably produced in the manner described below. It should be understood however, that although the process for producing the carbon blacks of the present invention is described below with reference to one type of carbon black furnace reactor, the process may be practiced in any carbon black reactor.<br>
The carbon blacks of the present invention may be produced by any process known in the art. Preferably the carbon blacks of the present invention are produced in a furnace carbon black reactor having a first (combustion) zone, a transition zone, and a reaction zone wherein:<br>
a carbon black-yielding feedstock is injected into a hot combustion gas stream; the resultant mixture of hot combustion gases and feedstock passes into the reaction zone; and pyrolysis of the carbon black-yielding feedstock is stopped by quenching the mixture when the carbon blacks of the present invention have been formed and wherein there is utilized a primary combustion level of greater than 300%, preferably at least 550%, more preferably 500-1200%. Preferably the overall combustion level of the process for producing the carbon blacks of the present invention is at least 22%, preferably 22% to 31%, more preferably 25% to 28%. It is also preferred that the residence time for the carbon black forming reactions in the process for producing the carbon blacks of the present invention is 0.55 second to 9.9 seconds, more preferably 1.06 seconds to 6.58 seconds. The process for preparing the novel carbon blacks of the present invention will be described in greater detail hereinafter.<br>
In particular, the carbon blacks of the present invention may be produced according to the process of the present invention in a modular, also referred to as "staged," furnace carbon black<br><br>
reactor. A section of a typical modular furnace carbon black reactor which may be utilized to produce the carbon blacks of the present invention is depicted in FIG. 1. Other details of a typical modular furnace carbon black reactor may be found, for example, in the description contained in U.S. Pat. No. 3,922,335, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the carbon blacks of the present invention may be produced /, in a furnace carbon black reactor 2, having a combustion zone 10, which has a zone of converging diameter, 11, a transition zone 12, and reaction zone 18. The end of the reaction zone 18 nearest the transition zone 12 has a zone, 17, of a restricted diameter. The diameter of the combustion zone 10, up to the point where the zone of converging diameter 11, begins is shown as D-1; the diameter of zone 12, as D-2; the diameter of zone 17, as D-3; and the diameter of zone 18, as D-4. The length of the combustion zone 10, up to the point where the zone of converging diameter 11, begins is shown as L-l; the length of the zone of converging diameter, 11, is shown as L-2; the length of the transition zone, 12, is shown as L-3; and the length of the zone, 17, of restricted diameter, is shown as L-4,<br>
To produce the carbon blacks of the present invention, hot combustion gases are generated in combustion zone 10, by reacting a liquid or gaseous fuel with a suitable oxidant such as air, oxygen, mixtures of air and oxygen or the like. Among the fuels suitable for use in reacting with the oxidant stream in combustion zone 10, to generate the hot combustion gases are included any of the readily combustible gas, vapor or liquid streams such as natural gas, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, acetylene, alcohols, or kerosene. It is generally preferred, however, to utilize fuels having a high content of carbon-containing components and, in particular, hydrocarbons. The ratio of air to natural gas utilized to produce the carbon blacks of the present invention is at<br><br>
least 30:1, preferably 45:1 to 100:1. To facilitate the generation of hot combustion gases, the oxidant stream may be preheated.<br>
In order to produce the carbon blacks of the present invention, the primary combustion level of the carbon black production process is preferably greater than 300% and preferably at least 550%. More preferably, to produce the carbon blacks of the present invention, the primary combustion level of the carbon black production process is 500-1200%.<br>
As referred to herein, the primary combustion level represents the amount of oxidant such as air used in the first stage of a multi-staged process relative to the theoretical amount of oxidant required for the complete combustion of the first stage hydrocarbon to carbon dioxide and water. For purposes of convenience, the primary combustion level is expressed in terms of a percentage.<br>
The theoretical amount of oxidant required for the complete combustion of the first stage hydrocarbon to carbon dioxide and water is referred to herein as the "Air-to-burn-Gas Ratio", and expressed as a ratio of volumes of theoretical oxidant and first stage hydrocarbon. The quantities of oxidant and first stage hydrocarbon may be described in any convenient and consistent set of units.<br>
The primary combustion level may be determined according to the following formula:<br>
	(Measured Air Ratel x 100		<br>
(Measured Gas Rate) x (Air-to-burn-Gas Ratio<br>
where:<br>
"Measured Air Rate"=the volumetric flow rate of air introduced into the combustion zone of the reactor measured at standard conditions of temperature and pressure "Measured Gas Rate"=the volumetric flow rate of gas introduced into the combustion zone of tfye reactor measured at standard conditions of temperature and pressure and the "Measured Air Rate", the "Measured Gas Rate" and the "Air-to-burn-Gas Ratio" are in a set of mutually consistent units.<br><br>
As. used herein, "standard conditions of temperature and pressure" refer to a temperature of 60° F. and a pressure of 1 atmosphere (atm).<br>
The hot combustion gas stream flows downstream from zones 10 and 11 into zones 12,17<br>
and then 18. The direction of the flow of hot combustion gases is shown in FIG. 1 by the arrow.<br>
Carbon black-yielding feedstock 30 is introduced at point 32 located in zone 12. The feedstock<br>
may be introduced either through a probe 15, or preferably radially inward through a plurality of<br>
openings positioned in the wall of zone 12 at point 32, or a combination of the two. Suitable for<br>
use herein as carbon black-yielding hydrocarbon feedstocks, which are readily volatilizable under<br>
the conditions of the reaction, are unsaturated hydrocarbons such as acetylene; olefins such as<br>
ethylene, propylene, butylene; aromatics such as benzene, toluene and xylene; certain saturated<br>
i. ■ hydrocarbons; and volatilized hydrocarbons such as kerosenes, naphthalenes, terpenes, ethylene<br>
tars, aromatic cycle stocks and the like.<br>
The distance from point 32 downstream to the beginning of the zone, 17, of restricted diameter in the reaction zone is shown as F-l. In each of the examples described herein, carbon black-yielding feedstock 30, was injected radially inward through a plurality of ^openings positioned in the wall of zone 12 at point 32, the resulting jets penetrating into the interior regions of the hot combustion gas stream so as to rapidly decompose and convert the feedstock to the novel carbon blacks of the present invention.<br>
In order to produce the carbon blacks of the present invention, the overall combustion level of the carbon black production process is preferably at least 22%, more preferably 22 to 35%, and even more preferably 25 to 28%.<br>
As referred to herein, and known to those skilled in the art, the overall combustion level represents the total amount of oxidant such as air used in the carbon forming process relative to<br><br>
the amount of oxidant required for the complete combustion of the total amount of hydrocarbon used in the carbon forming process to form carbon dioxide and water. The overall combustion level is usually expressed as a percentage.<br>
For purposes of convenience, the amount of oxidant required for the complete combustion of the carbon black-yielding feedstock to carbon dioxide and water is referred to as the Air-to-burn-Oil Ratio, and expressed as a ratio of volumes of theoretical oxidant and carbon black-yielding feedstock. The quantities of oxidant and carbon black yielding feedstock may be described in any convenient and consistent set of units.<br>
The overall combustion level may be determined according to the following formula:<br>
	(Measured Air Rate) x 100	<br>
(Measured Gas Rate) x (Air-to-burn-Gas Ratio) + (Measured Oil Rate) x (Air-to-burn Ratio)<br>
where:<br>
"Measured Air Rate"=the volumetric flow rate of air introduced into the combustion zone of the reactor measured at standard conditions of temperature and pressure "Measured Gas Rate"=the volumetric flow rate of gas introduced into the combustion zone of the reactor measured at standard conditions of temperature and pressure.<br>
"Measured Oil Rate'Hhe volumetric flow rate of oil introduced into the reactor measured at standard conditions of temperature and pressure.<br>
and the "Measured Air Rate", the "Measured Gas Rate", the "Measured Oil Rate", thewAir-to-burn-Gas Ratio" and the "Air-to-burn-Oil Ratio" are in a set of mutually consistent units.<br>
The mixture of carbon black-yielding feedstock and hot combustion gases flows downstream through zones 12 and 17 into zone 18. Quench 40, located at point 42, injecting<br><br>
quenching fluid 50, which in the examples described herein was water, is utilized to stop pyrolysis of the carbon black-yielding feedstock when the novel carbon blacks of the present invention are formed. Point 42 may be determined in any manner known to the art for selecting the position of a quench to stop pyrolysis.<br>
One method for determining the position of the quench utilized to stop pyrolysis<br>
is by determining the point at which an acceptable toluene extract level for the novel carbon<br>
%■ blacks of the present invention is achieved. Toluene extract level may be measured by using<br>
ASTM Test Procedure D1618-83, "Carbon black extractables-Toluene Discoloration."<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process for producing the carbon blacks of the present<br>
invention, the location of the quench is determined in such manner as to ensure that the resultant<br>
nominal residence time for the carbon black forming reactions in the reactor is 0.55 second to 9.9<br>
seconds and preferably 1.06 to 6.58 seconds. The nominal residence time in the reactor is defined<br>
herein as the time nominally required for the oxidant traveling through the reactor to travel from<br>
the point of injection of carbon black-yielding feedstock to the point of quench, if the oxidant<br>
were unaltered by any of the processes occurring in any of the stages of the staged reactor, and<br>
where the volumetric flow rate of the oxidant is defined at standard conditions of temperature and<br>
pressure.<br>
After the mixture of hot combustion gases and carbon black-yielding feedstock is<br>
quenched, the cooled gases pass downstream into any conventional cooling and separating means<br>
whereby the carbon blacks are recovered. The separation of the carbon black from the g^s stream<br>
is readily accomplished by conventional means such as a precipitator, cyclone separator or bag<br>
filter. This separation may be followed by pelletizing using, for example, a wet pelletizer.<br><br>
In the reactor illustrated in FIG. 2, the reaction zone further comprises zones 18A, 18B and 18C. Zone 18A is located adjacent to zone 17B. Zone 18B is located adjacent to zone 18A and is angled at an angle OMEGA, as shown in FIG. 2. Zone 18C is located adjacent to zone 18B. The diameter of zone 18A is shown as D-4A; the diameter of zone 18B, as D-4B, and the diameter of zone 18C, as D-4C. The length of the zone, 18A is shown as L-5A; the length of each of the sections of zone 18B, in a direction parallel to the horizontal, are either L-5B or L-5C as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
The processes and carbon black products described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,877*250 and 5,877,251 can be used herein and form a part of the present invention and are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.<br>
The carbon blacks of the present invention preferably have the ash content, total sulfur content, and the toluene extractable level, as described above. These properties can be achieved by properly controlling the type of feedstock used and the amount of water used in the process as well as the reactor temperature, residence time, and the quench length or temperature in the drier during the formation of the carbon black.<br>
The polymer compositions of the present invention comprise a polymer and at least one type of carbon black of the present invention. The polymer compositions of the present invention include a polymer, natural rubbers, synthetic rubbers, elastomers, and blends or mixtures thereof The amount of carbon black utilized in the polymer compositions of the present invention includes any amount effective to achieve the results desired for the intended end use of the polymer composition, such amounts being conventional and well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Generally, amounts of the carbon black product ranging from 0.5 to 300 parts by weight can be used for each 100 parts by weight of polymer. It is, however, preferred to use<br><br>
amounts varying from 0.5 to 100 parts by weight of carbon black per 100 parts by weight of polymer and especially preferred is the utilization of from 0.5 to 80 parts by weight of carbon black per 100 parts by weight of polymer.<br>
