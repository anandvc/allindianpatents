				<td>LUBRICANT ANTIOXIDANT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING A METAL COMPOUND AND A HINDERED AMINE<br>
<br>
This application is a non-provisional application claiming benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. ser. Nos. 60/893,195, filed March 6, 2007 and 60/944,897 filed June 19, 2007.<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
<br>
This invention relates to lubricating oil compositions, their method of preparation and use. Specifically, this invention relates to lubricating compositions that contain a metal compound and a hindered amine. The use of a metal compound and the hindered amine act synergistically to surprisingly provide protection of the lubricant from oxidation. The addition of an aromatic amine, particularly a diarylamine, to this combination provides even better protection.<br>
<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
<br>
Oxidation is a major cause of the breakdown of lubricants. This results in a shortened lifespan of the lubricant, requiring more frequent changes, especially in demanding environments such as internal combustion engines.<br>
<br>
Antioxidants have therefore played an important role as additives in lubricants in order to extend their useful life. Aromatic amines, especially secondary diarylamines, e.g., alkylated diphenylamines, phenothiazines, and alkylated N-naphthyl-N-phenylamines, have been important additives to lubricating compositions. Also important have been phenolic compounds in retarding oxidation.<br>
<br>
The combination of an antioxidant with a metal compound has been important in extending the lifetime of the antioxidant. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,994,277 to Richie et al. teaches that a crankcase lubricant composition which contains copper, molybdenum <br>
<br>
and aromatic amines can act as an effective antioxidant combination. U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,802 to Shaub et al. discloses sulfurized molybdenum complexes with oil-soluble aromatic amines. Gatto, et al., in U.S. Pat. No. RE38,929E has disclosed that the combination of certain sulfur and phosphorus-free molybdenum compounds and secondary diarylamines improved the useful life of a lubricating oil. The most effective amounts in inhibiting oxidation were between 100 and 450 parts per million (ppm) of molybdenum, and between 750 and 5,000 ppm of an oil-soluble secondary diphenylamine.<br>
<br>
Other combinations of antioxidants have also been used. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,073,278 and 5,273,669 to Schumacher et al. disclose the synergistic combination of aromatic amines and hindered amines in a lubricating oil. U.S. Pat. No. 5,268,113 to Evans et al. discloses the combination of a hindered amine with phenolic compounds.<br>
<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
We have found that a lubricant composition containing the combination of a metal compound with a hindered amine gives antioxidant protection in a synergistic fashion.<br>
<br>
We have also discovered that a lubricant composition containing the combination of a metal compound with a hindered amine and a secondary diarylamine can synergistically give enhanced antioxidant protection. <br>
<br>

<br>
The molybdenum compound used in this invention can be any lubricant-soluble molybdenum compound. Examples are listed below. This list is not to imply any <br>
<br>
limitation on the type of lubricant-soluble molybdenum compound, but is shown as an example of possible useful molybdenum compounds.<br>

(4) Oil soluble molybdenum compounds prepared from a molybdenum source such as ammonium molybdates, alkali and alkaline earth metal molybdates, molybdenum trioxide, and molybdenum acetylacetonates and an active hydrogen compound such as alcohols and polyols, primary and secondary amines and polyamines, phenols, ketones, anilines, etc. can be used in combination with the diarylamines in this invention. Some examples include:<br>
<br>

<br>
(b) Overbased alkali metal and alkaline earth metal sulfonates, phenates and salicylate compositions containing molybdenum such as those claimed by Hunt et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,832,857. The molybdenum containing overbased alkaline earth metal and alkali metal sulfonates, phenates, and salicylates are prepared by a process which comprises:<br>
<br>
(i) Introducing into a reaction a compound selected from the group consisting of a sulfonate, a phenate, and a salicylate where the compound is an overbased alkaline earth or alkali metal compound; (ii) Adding to the reactor a solvent to solubilize the compound and to form a mixture A;<br>

<br>
(ix) Heating the clarified composition to a temperature of from about 300° F to about 400° F. to remove solvent and non-polar compound and to recover the product comprising an overbased molybdenum-containing alkaline earth metal or alkali metal compound. <br>

<br>
(10) Molybdenum salts such as the carboxylates are a preferred group of molybdenum compounds. They may be salts of the same anion or mixed salts, meaning that they are formed from more than one type of acid. Illustrative of suitable anions there can be mentioned chloride, carboxylate, nitrate, sulfonate, or any other anion.<br>
<br>
The molybdenum carboxylates may be derived from any organic carboxylic acid. The molybdenum carboxylate is preferably that of a monocarboxylic acid such as that having from about 4 to 30 carbon atoms. Such acids can be hydrocarbon aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic carboxylic acids. Monocarboxylic acids such as those of aliphatic acids having about 4 to 18 carbon atoms are preferred, particularly those having an alkyl group of about 6 to 18 carbon atoms. The alicyclic acids may generally contain from 4 to 12 carbon atoms. The aromatic acids may generally contain one or two fused rings and contain from 7 to 14 <br>
<br>
carbon atoms wherein the carboxyl group may or may not be attached to the ring. The carboxylic acid can be a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid having from about 4 to 18 carbon atoms. Examples of some carboxylic acids that may be used m prepare the molybdenum carboxylates include: butyric acid; valeric acid; caproic acid heptanoic acid; cyclohexanecarboxylic acid; cyclodecanoic acid; naphthenic acid; phenyl acetic acid; 2-methylhexanoic acid; 2-ethylhexanoic acid; suberic acid; octanoic acid; nonanoic acid; decanoic acid; undecanoic acid; lauric acid, tridecanoic acid; myristic acid; pentadecanoic acid; palmitic acid; linolenic acid; heptadecanoic acid; stearic acid; oleic acid; nonadecanoic acid; eicosanoic acid; heneicosanoic acid; docosanoic acid; and erucic acid.<br>
<br>
A number of methods have been reported in the literature for preparing the molybdenum carboxylates, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,593,012 to Usui and U.S. Pat. No. 3,578,690 to Becker. The Usui patent describes the production of hydrocarbon soluble salts (molybdenyl carboxylates) by reaction of an ammonium molybdate with a carboxylic acid in the presence of an organic amine at specified elevated temperatures while removing water, U.S. Pat. No. 3,578,690 prepares its molybdenum carboxylates by reacting molybdenum oxide, molybdenum halide, alkali earth molybdate, alkaline earth molybdate, ammonium molybdate or mixtures of molybdenum sources with carboxylic acids at elevated temperatures and with removal of water.<br>
<br>
The exact composition of the oil soluble molybdenum carboxylates can vary. Most of the literature refers to these compounds as molybdenum carboxylates. They have also been referred to as molybdenum carboxylate salts, molybdenyl (MoO22+) carboxylates and molybdenyl carboxylate salts, molybdenum carboxylic acid salts, and molybdenum salts of carboxylic acids.<br>
<br>
(11) Other Molybdenum compounds. Other molybdenum compounds that can be utilized include molybdenum-containing dispersants as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,896, molybdenum-containing viscosity index (VI) modifiers, amine <br>
<br>
molybdates as in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,931 and 6,329,327 to Tanaka, et al., the commercially available Sakuralube® 700 and Sakuralube® 710 from Adeka Co., and organo-imido molybdenum complexes as in U.S. Pat. No. 7,229,951 to Migdal, et al.<br>
<br>
(12). New molybdenum compounds. New molybdenum compounds are set forth in co-pending U.S. serial no.12/041,130, filed simultaneously herewith, assigned to the present assignee, and claiming benefit of the same provisional applications as the present invention.<br>
<br>
Some of the novel molybdenum compounds used in this invention are the reaction products of a (a) hindered amine, (b) molybdenum source such as MoO3, and one of (c)(i)water, (ii) a diol and water, and (iii) the reaction of product of a fatty oil and multifunctional amine, and water. A multifunctional amine is defined here as an amine containing two or more amine or hydroxyl functional groups, and may be for example l-(2-aminoethyl)-aminoethanol or isodecyloxypropyl-1,3- diaminopropane, and preferably diethanolamine.<br>
<br>
The reagents are added and heated to a temperature between 60 and 15O0C for a period of 1 to 6 hours. After the period of reaction, water is removed by distillation and vacuum stripping, revealing a yellow to red product. A specific chemical composition cannot be assigned to the new material, but from infrared spectroscopy is expected to contain a czs-dioxo Mo structure, indicative of a Mo(VI) complex.<br>
<br>

<br>
3. Polymers Containing Hindered Amines<br>
<br>
Polymeric 2,2,6, 6-tetraalkylpiperidines and 1,2,2,6,6-pentaalkylpiperidines are also prevalent and may be used in this formulation. The polymeric compounds used in this invention are described by Schumacher, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,278, by Evans et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,268,113, and by Kazmierzak et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4857,595. There are several kinds of polymeric piperidine compounds available. Commercially available examples include Tinuvin® 622 from Ciba and Songlight® 9440 from Songwon. <br>
<br>
4. Other Hindered Amines<br>
<br>
Another type of hindered amine has been disclosed in US Patent No. 5,098,944 and describes hindered amines of the type shown in general formula (XI).<br>
<br>
(XI)<br>
<br>
<br>
Wherein PSP represents a substituent derived from a cyclic amine represented by a structure selected from the group in general formulae (XII)<br>
<br>
(XII)<br>
<br>
<br>
wherein PSP represents a substituent derived from a cyclic amine represented by a structure selected from the group consisting of wherein R34 represents C1 -C24 alkyl, C5 -C2o cycloalkyl C7 -C2o aralkyl or alkaryl, C1 -C24 aminoalkyl, or C6 -C2o aminocycloalkyl; R35, R36, R37, and R38 independently represent C1-C24 alkyl; and R35 with R36, or R37 with R38 are cyclizable to C5 -C12 cycloalkyl including the C3 and C5 atoms respectively, of the piperazin-2-one ring; R39 and R40 independently represent C1 -C24 alkyl, and polymethylene having from 4 to 7 carbonatoms which are cyclizable; R41 represents H, C1-C6 alkyl, and phenyl; R42 represents C1-C25 alkyl, H, or O, or alkoxy with a hydrocarbon chain between 1 and 25 carbon atoms; and, p represents an integer in the range from 2 to about 10. <br>
<br>
5. Hindered Amine Salts<br>
<br>
Virtually all of the hindered amines listed above are basic and will readily form ammonium salts. Common anions for the ammonium salt includes sulfonates, petroleum sulfonates, carboxylates, naphthenates, carbonates, sulfates, sulfites, phosphates, phosphinates, phosphites, chloride, bromide, and iodide, or any anionic material that will give the ammonium salt solubility in the lubricant.<br>
<br>
Diarylamines<br>
<br>
The diarylamines used in this invention are of the type Ar2NR. Since these are well known antioxidants in the art, there is no restriction on the type of diarylamines used in this invention, although there is the requirement of solubility in the lubricating composition.<br>
<br>
(XIII)<br>
<br>
R43<br>
<br>
R44 R45<br>
<br>
The alkylated diphenylamines are well known antioxidants and there is no particular restriction on the type of secondary diarylamine used in the invention. Preferably, the secondary diarylamine antioxidant has the general formula (X) where R43 and R44 each independently represents a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having from 6 to 30 carbon atoms. R45 represents either a H atom or an alkyl group containing from 1 to 30 carbon atoms. Illustrative of substituents for the aryl there can be mentioned aliphatic hydrocarbon groups such as alkyl having from about 1 to 20 carbon atoms, hydroxy, carboxyl or nitro, e.g., an alkaryl group having from 7 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl group. The aryl is preferably substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or naphthyl, particularly wherein one or both of the aryl groups are substituted with an alkyl such as one having from 4 to 18 carbon atoms. R45 can be either H or alkyl from 1 to 30 carbon atoms. The alkylated diphenylamines used in this invention can be of a structure other than that <br>
<br>
shown in the above formula which shows but one nitrogen atom in the molecule. Thus, the alkylated diphenylamine can be of a different structure provided that at least one nitrogen has 2 aryl groups attached thereto, e.g., as in the case of various diamines having a secondary nitrogen atom as well as two aryls on one of the nitrogens. The alkylated diphenylamines used in this invention preferably have antioxidant properties in lubricating oils, even in the absence of the molybdenum compound.<br>
<br>
Examples of some alkylated diphenylamines that may be used in this invention include: diphenyl amine, 3-hydroxydiphenylamine; N-phenyl-l,2-phenylened- amine; N-phenyl- 1 ,4-phenylenediamine; dibutyldiphenylamine; dioctyldiphenylamine; dinonyldiphenylamine; phenyl-alpha-naphthylamine; phenyl-beta-naphthylamine; diheptyldiphenylamine; and p-oriented styrenated diphenylamine.<br>
<br>
Phenothiazines<br>
<br>
Phenothiazines are another class of diarylamines with the general structure (XIV),<br>
<br>
(XIV)<br>
<br>
<br>
Where R46 is H, or an alkyl from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, and R47 and R48 are alkyl from 1 to 30 carbon atoms<br>
<br>
Lubricating Oil Compositions<br>
<br>
The lubricating oil compositions of this invention can be prepared by adding the molybdenum, tungsten or other metal-containing additive to a lubricating oil basestock with an oil-soluble hindered amine. The metal-containing additive should be sufficient to provide from 1 to 2,000 ppm metal in the composition, and the hindered amine should be <br>
<br>
added in amount sufficient to provide from 1 to 20,000 ppm (.01 to 2 wt %) in the lubricating oil.<br>
<br>
In another embodiment, a lubricant oil combination of this invention can be prepared by adding the metal-containing additive to a basestock with an oil-soluble hindered amine and an oil-soluble diarylamine, with the amounts of the metal and hindered amine as above, and diarylamine added to provide from 1 to 20,000 ppm thereof in the lubricating oil.<br>
<br>
Other Additives<br>
<br>
In addition, other additives can be added to the lubricating compositions described above.<br>
<br>
These include one or more of the following components:<br>
<br>
Other antioxidants, including phenols, hindered phenols, hindered bisphenols, sulfurized phenols, sulfurized olefins, alkyl sulfides and disulfides, dialkyl dithiocarbamates, dithiocarbamate esters, such as VANLUBE® 7723 sold by the R. T. Vanderbilt Company, zinc dihydrocarbyl dithiosphosphates, zinc dithiocarbamates. A more complete list of useful phenols can be found in US Patent No. 5,073,278 to Schumacher et al.<br>

<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
<br>
Preparation of Mo compound (KJC-555-163)<br>
<br>
Into a 500 rnL round-bottomed flask was placed 15.0 g of MoO3, 15.0 g water, 100 g of a reaction product of coconut oil (1 part) and diethanolamine (2.7 parts), and 40 g of Tinuven®123, a Ciba product with the chemical name bis-(l-octyloxy-2,2,6,6- tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)sebacate. The mixture was stirred and heated to 80°C for 3 hours. An aspirator vacuum was then placed on the flask and heated for a period of 2 hours with the loss of water. The reaction was cooled somewhat and filtered hot through Celite, revealing an oily, reddish product containing 5.8% molybdenum.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
<br>
Preparation of novel Mo Compound (KJC-555-171)<br>
<br>
Into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask was placed 15.0 g Of MoO3, 15.0 g water, 62.5 g of 2-ethyl-l,3-hexanediol, and 54.6 g of Cyasorb® UV-3853, a hindered amine with the name 4-piperidol-2,2,6,6-tetremethyl-RPW stearin (fatty acids mixture). The mixture was stirred at 8O0C for 1 hour, then heated under vacuum for 1 hour. 10.36 g of a mineral oil was added, and then the mixture was filtered through Celite to give an oily, pale reddish product containing 7.7 % Mo.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
<br>
Preparation of novel Mo Compound (KJC-555-176)<br>
<br>
Into a 500 mL round-bottomed flask was placed 15.0 g Of MoO3, 15.0 g water, 90.5 g of of a reaction product of coconut oil (1 part) and diethanolamine (2.7 parts), and 54.6 g of Cyasorb® UV-3853. The mixture was heated at 8O0C for 1 hour, then heated under vacuum for 70 minutes. 15.0 g of a mineral oil was then added to give an oily reddish product containing 5.9% Mo. <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
<br>
Lubricant Compositions Containing Hindered Amine and Molybdenum Compound Pressurized differential scanning calorimetry (PDSC) was performed according to ASTM Test Method D1686 on the products of Examples 2 and 3, also called KJC-555-171, and KJC-555-176 respectively. These tests were performed on a lubricant composition comprising a polyalphaolefin oil, Durasyn® 166 from BP, and Infineum® C9268, a crankcase dispersant containing 1.2% Nitrogen from Infineum. Also provided in the lubricant composition was N-methyl hindered amine Songlight® 2920LQ, (chemically bis(l,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-l-piperidinyl)sebacate) and the aforementioned Cyasorb UV- 3853. The molybdenum containing compounds were added to the lubricating compositions to give 700 ppm of Mo. The test is performed by blending and adding the ingredients into a DSC cell, heating the cell to 210°C, then pressurizing with 500 psi of oxygen. What is measured is the oxidation induction time (OIT), which is the time takes to observe an exothermic release of heat. The longer the OIT the greater the oxidative stability of the oil blend. The results are shown in Table I labeled as &amp;quot;minutes to induction&amp;quot;.<br>
<br>
The results clearly show a synergy between the molybdenum compound and the hindered amine utilized. The oxidation induction times were significantly increased when both the hindered amine and the molybdenum compound were present, than when separate. <br>

Lubricant Compositions Containing a Molybdate Ester Compound with a Hindered Amine, and a Molybdate Ester Compound with a Hindered Amine and an Alkylated Diphenylamine.<br>
<br>
Lubricant compositions containing the combination of hindered amine and the MOLYVAN® 855 were prepared and PDSC (ASTM D 1686) was performed as in Example 4. MOLYVAN® 855 was added at an amount to give 700 ppm Mo to the lubricating composition. The results are given in Table IV.<br>
<br>
Again a large synergy is observed when the combination of the 855 and the hindered amine is used. Three types of hindered amines were utilized: an N-R, (Songlight 2920LQ), an N-H (Cyasorb UV-3853) and an N-OR type, (Tinuvin 123). AU three were found to be effective as antioxidants in combination with the molybdate ester. <br>
<br>
Lubricant compositions containing the combination of hindered amine, alkylated diphenylamine and MOLYV AN® 855 at 700 ppm Mo were also found to have strong synergies in the PDSC (ASTM D 1686), and gave longer induction times than either the alkylated diphenylamine/molybdate ester or hindered amine/molybdate ester at equal weight concentrations of the hindered amine and alkylated diphenylamine.<br>

<br>
A tungsten- amine compound BT-521-197 containing 28.2% W was used and blended to give approximately 700 ppm of W in the blends. BT-521-197 is the reaction product of tungstic acid and ditridecylamine according to U.S. patent application no. 20040214731.<br>
<br>
A PDSC test slightly modified from that used in Example 4 (ASTM D6186) was performed on the blends. Unocal® 90 was used as the base oil. Unocal® 90 is a <br>
<br>
paraffinic Group I base oil from Union Oil of California. The temperature was also 18O0C.<br>
<br>
The results clearly show a synergy between the tungsten- amine compound and the hindered amine, superior to the synergy between the Vanlube SL and the tungsten- amine compound. The results also show a synergy between the blend of the Vanblue SL, the hindered amine, and the tungsten-amine compound.<br>
