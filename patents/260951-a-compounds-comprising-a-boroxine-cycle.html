				<td>BOROXINE DERIVATIVES AS FLAME RETARDANT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to compounds derived from boroxine, and their use as flame retardant in polymeric resins, in particular in thermosetting polymeric resins.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The flame resistance of polymeric resins, in particular of thermosetting polymeric resins, such as for instance epoxy, benzoxazine, cyanate or polyimide (addition as well as thermoplastic) resins, is still not sufficient for many uses. In order to make polymeric resins flame retardant the addition of bromine, phosphorous or chlorine containing compounds or fillers is necessary. Very often the offered solutions to make a composition flame retardant is based on inert fillers or halogen containing compounds or other additives which have as a rule one or several drawbacks:<br>
-	They are inert materials not reacting into the system and hence can cause problems in<br>
terms of processing.<br>
-	They lower the thermal performance of the resins.<br>
-	They may not be soluble in organic solvents.<br>
-	They often lack flexibility to work in more than one type of resin system.<br>
-	Toxic gases of combustion may form in case of fire, especially when halogenated<br>
compounds are present.<br>
Therefore it is preferred that flame/heat resistant polymeric resins are free of halogen containing compounds.<br>
Boroxines have become known as co-catalysts in the preparation of alkene polymerization catalysts. Mainly trimethoxy boroxines had been used for that purpose, cf. US 20030207757. Those compounds are further known for their ability to capture salt anions cf. EP 898319. Protective coatings by using boron compounds have also been prepared, cf. EP 791029. WO 2003011583 describes a system based on trimethoxyboroxine which is able to increase the interiayer adhesion-US 4343928 describes transparency composites including transparent, heat-resistant interiayer formed from epoxy resin, trimethoxyboroxine and phenyl substituted alkyl alcohol, especially benzyl alcohol.<br>
The treatment of wood by using boron compounds which acts also as flame retardants has been described in cf. WO 2002102560.<br>
Boronic acid esters became known as flame retardants, cf. WO 200026288.<br>
Beyond that, trimethoxy boroxines were used in expandable systems, cf. US 5474721.<br>
Halo-substituted boroxines have been mentioned as fire retarded compositions, cf. WO 9842802.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It now has surprisingly been found that articles made from polymeric resins, in particular from thermosetting polymeric resins, comprising compounds derived from boroxine with at least one boron atom substituted by an oxy derivative of an aliphatic, unsaturated chain such as, for example, tripropargylboroxine may show a greatly reduced flammability while the mechanical and thermal performance is maintained. Such articles are therefore particularly suitable for use in aerospace, industrial, electronics or other applications such as automotive, adhesives, sealants, prepregs and laminates, coatings and PCB's. They can also be processed by using infusion techniques such as RTM (resin transfer moulding) or Vacuum RTM (VaRTM).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An aspect of the present invention is a compound (A) comprising a boroxine cycle wherein at<br>
least one of the 3 boron atoms of the cycle bears a substituant comprising an oxy function<br>
bonded to (1) the boron atom and to (2) a moeity containing an unsaturated, non-aromatic,<br>
carbon-carbon bond. This moeity (2) can also be called an unsaturated, non-aromatic,<br>
carbon-carbon bond- containing- part.<br>
According to IUPAC rules, an aliphatic compound is an "acyclic or cyclic, saturated or<br>
unsaturated carbon compound, excluding aromatic compound".<br>
Preferably, the substituant is an oxy derivative of an unsaturated aliphatic compound.<br>
Preferably, the compound according to the invention is either an alkenoxyboroxine<br>
comprising at least one carbon-carbon double bond or, more preferably, an alkynoxyboroxine<br>
comprising at least one carbon-carbon triple bond.<br>
Preferably, the substituant has a general formula like;<br>
-0-(CR1R2)n-[C((R3)oR4)~ C((R5)pR6)] wherein = is an unsaturated bond;<br>
n&gt;=0 and, when n&gt;1, R1 and/or R2 can be different on each of the n carbon atoms; o = p =0 when the unsaturated bond is a triple carbon-carbon bond or o=p=1 when the unsaturated bond is a double carbon-carbon bond;<br>
each of R1 to R6 is independently H, or any other organic or non organic derivative. Preferably n=1 to 20, preferably n=1<br>
If the substituant is an alkenoxy derivative, it is preferably not chosen amongst the following list: tris(2-propenyloxy)-l tris (3-butenyloxy)t-, tris(2-butenyloxy)-, tris [(2-methyl-2-propenyl)oxy]-, tris[(1 -methyl-2-propenyl]oxy]-, tris(4-pentenyloxy)-,tris[(1 -methyl-3-buteny)oxy]-, tris[(I-methyl-2-butenyl^xy]-, tris[(I-ethyl-2-butenyl]oxy)-, tris(9-octadecenyloxy)-.<br>
Preferably the unsaturated bond of the substituant is close to the boroxine cycle. It is believed that the absence of a long aliphatic chain is in favor of the stability and dispersibilty or solubility of the boroxine derivative compound into a resin matrix. Therefore, preferably n=1 when the general formula applies.<br>
The substituant comprises an unsaturated bond which is not part of an aromatic moeity. Preferably the substituant does not comprise an aromatic cycle, more preferably it does not contain any cyde.<br>
Without being bond by any theory, the inventors believe that this enables the unsaturated bond to participate in further polymerisation of a resin which enhances the spread of compound (A) troughout the cured resin and may play a role in providing appropriate flame or heat resistance.<br>
Preferably the unsaturated bond of the substituant is a carbon-carbon triple bond. Preferably, all 3 oxygen atoms of the boroxine cyde are substituted. This ensures that a high rate of unsaturations are available to participate in further resin polymerisation. Preferably, the substituants on the carbon atoms participating in, or adjacent to the unsaturated bond are all hydrogen. This is believed to participate in appropriate stability of the compound and its dispersibility and compatibility in resins.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method of preparation of a compound (A), the method comprising exchanging at least one alkoxy moiety of trialkoxyboroxin with an unsaturated<br>
aliphatic alcohol moiety, preferably an alkenyl-or alkynyl alcohol moiety, preferably by<br>
heating.<br>
Preferably all 3 alkoxy moeities of trialkylboroxine are exchanged.<br>
A prefered aspect of the present invention is a compound of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
tripropargylboroxine, also called trispropargylboroxine.<br>
A convenient method of preparation of a compound of formula (I) comprises exchanging the alkoxy moieties of trialkoxyboroxin with propargyl alcohol moieties by heating. Preferably, the trialkoxyboroxin and the propargyl alcohol are reacted in a molar ratio of about 1 to 3 with up to 25% by weight of an excess of propargyl alcohol. Preferably, the trialkoxyboroxine is a tri-C1-C4-alkoxyboroxine, and most preferred trimethoxyboroxine is used and the resulting methanol is distilled off.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is the use of a compound (A) in the process of preparation of flame retarded castings, prepregs, laminates or infusion systems which are based on polymeric resins, in particular on thermosetting polymeric resins.<br>
Flame retarded in the context of the present invention means, preferably, meeting the UL 94 standard ("Underwriters Laboratory" test method UL 94) criterion VO.<br>
The properties of the polymeric resins produced as described above can be tailored for the<br>
envisaged application by addition of usual additives. The following additives are of particular<br>
importance:<br>
Reinforcement fibers, such as glass, quartz, carbon, mineral and synthetic fibers (Keflar,<br>
Nomex), natural fibres, such as (flax, jute, sisal, hemp) in the usual forms of short fibers,<br>
staple fibers, threads, fabrics or mats;<br>
plasticizers, especially phosphorus compounds;<br>
carbon black or graphite;<br>
fillers;<br>
dyestuffs;<br>
micro hollow spheres;<br>
metal powders.<br>
The processes known for polymeric resins, in particular for thermosetting polymeric resins, such as hot-pressing of prepregs, SMC (Sheet Molding Compound); molding; casting; filament winding; infusion techniques or vacuum impregnating (RTM, VaRTM) are suitable for processing the compositions according to the invention. With respect to vacuum impregnating, very fine additives having a particle size of 0.2 to 0.001 mm are particularly suitable.<br>
The weight of a flame retardant used in a composition will depend upon the effectiveness of that component in the formulation in achieving the desired VO criterion according to UL-94 standard. A weight range of 0.1 to 50 % by weight of compound (A) has to be taken into account, based on the resin composition. A particularly suitable composition comprises more than 1, and more preferably more than 5, % by weight based on the resin composition.<br>

In another aspect, the invention relates to boroxine derived compounds, for example<br>

polymeric resins, in particular in thermosetting polymeric resins.<br>
The compositions are particularly useful to make electrical laminates and other composites<br>
from fibrous reinforcement and a matrix resin. Examples of suitable processes usually<br>
contain the following steps:<br>
Solvent based impregnation Process<br>
(1)	A polymer resin formulation is applied to or impregnated into a substrate by rolling,<br>
injection, dipping, spraying, other known techniques and/or combinations thereof. The<br>
substrate is typically a woven or nonwoven fiber mat containing, for instance, glass fibers or<br>
paper.<br>
(2)	The impregnated substrate is "B-staged" by heating at a temperature sufficient to draw off<br>
solvent in the polymer resin formulation and optionally to partially cure the polymer resin<br>
formulation, so that the impregnated substrate can be handled easily. The "B- staging" step<br>
is usually carried out at a temperature of from 90°C to 210°C and for a time of from 1 minute<br>
to 15 minutes. The impregnated substrate that results from "B-staging" is called a "prepreg".<br>
The temperature is most commonly 100°C for composites and 130°C to 200°C for electrical<br>
laminates.<br>
(3)	One or more sheets of prepreg are stacked or laid up in alternating layers with one or<br>
more sheets of a conductive material, such as copper foil, if an electrical laminate is desired.<br>
(4)	The laid-up sheets are pressed at high temperature and pressure for a time sufficient to<br>
cure the resin and form a laminate and to remove air and solvents. The temperature of this<br>
lamination step is usually between 100°C and 250CC, and is most often between 165°C and<br>
200°C. The lamination step may also be carried out in two or more stages, such as a first<br>
stage between 100°C and 150°C and a second stage at between 165°C and 200°C. The<br>
pressure is usually between 50 N/cm2 and 500 N/cm2. The lamination step is usually carried<br>
out for a time of from 1 minute to 200 minutes, and most often for 45 minutes to 90 minutes.<br>
The lamination step may optionally be carried out at higher temperatures for shorter times<br>
 (such as in continuous lamination processes) or for longer times at lower temperatures (such as in low energy press processes).<br>
(5) Optionally, the resulting laminate, for example, a copper-dad laminate, may be post-treated by heating for a time at high temperature and ambient pressure. The temperature of post-treatment is usually between 120°C and 250°C. The post-treatment time usually is between 30 minutes and 16 hours.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
All tests are performed according to IPC TM 650.<br>
The IPC test methods are the electrical laminate industry standard (The Institute For Interconnection and Packaging Electronic Circuits, 3451 Church Street, Evanston, Illinois 60203) as follows:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A) Preparation of tripropargylboroxine (Compound (I))<br>
A mixture of 3 moles of propargyl alcohol and 1 mole of trimethoxyboroxine are heated to a<br>
temperature of 120-150°C until distillation of methanol stops.<br>
Boiling point: 85-88°C (at 10mm Hg column pressure)<br>
B) Laminates<br>
Fiberglass laminate composites are made by the solvent impregnating process. The components are dissolved in a solvent and then coated onto 7628 fabrics, an industry standard fiberglass weave type as defined by the glass strands, thickness and weight of the glass weave (Porcher SA 7628 ; with a silane or polyimide finish). The solvent is then evaporated and the composition B-staged. The prepreg with copper is then laminated under heat and pressure to produce a copper clad laminate (Table 3). The temperature of the hot air in the oven is 150-180°C and the times to generate the B-stage range in-between 2-5 seconds. The resin content ranges in-between 35-42 %.Those laminates are then evaluated for their thermal and flammability properties.<br>
All properties are based on 8 plies 7628 glass fabric laminate as per IPC TMI 3949. The laminates always have the fiberglass plies oriented such that all plies are laid in the same fill and warp direction.<br>
