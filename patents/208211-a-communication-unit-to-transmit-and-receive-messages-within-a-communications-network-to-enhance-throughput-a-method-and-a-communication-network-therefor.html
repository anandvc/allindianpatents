A COMMUNICATION UNIT TO TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE MESSAGES WITHIN A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK TO ENHANCE THROUGHPUT; A METHOD AND A COMMUNICATION NETWORK THEREFOR'<br>
CROSS-REFFRENCETO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This   application   claims  priority  from  U.S.   Provisional  Application   Serial. No.60/164,940,   entitled  "Flooding   of ROSPF  Link-State  Advertisements   Through-Clustering Beacons for Drastic Reduction of ROSPF Overhead" and filed November 12, 1999. The disclosure of that provisional application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.         Technical Field<br>
The present invention pertains to a communication unit to transmit and receive messages within a communications network to enhance throughput, a method of transmitting and receiving messages between communication units within a communications network to enhance throughput, and a communication network to enhance throughput. In particular, the present invention pertains to a communications system employing broadcast-based flooding schemes for synchronizing routing databases with reduced communication protocol overhead.<br>
2. Discussion of Related Art<br>
Generally, wireless networks may be arranged in a two-tier architecture similar to that of conventional cellular telephone systems. Thefirsttiertypically includes clusters or cells each including aplurality of communication nodes or cluster members. One node within each cluster is designated as a cluster head or base station. The second tier includes a backbone network formed of the cluster head nodes to enable communications between different clusters (e.g., for data transmitted over greater distances). The formation of clusters and designation of cluster head nodes is generally performed dynamically and in accordance with an intranet protocol (e.g., a protocol for communications within the two-tier network) that further performs routing functions within the network. The intranet protocol is preferably a link-estate type of routing protocol that is implemented on the backbone network. The cluster headnodes ,each-incktde=-a-database that is-synchronized with~other-cluster-head-node-databases~by. transference of Link-State Advertisement (LSA) packets in accordance with the protocol. These databases include information enabling the cluster head nodes to determine appropriate paths-for routing messages through the network, while the LSA packets provide information to update the databases.<br><br>
In order to facilitate internet routing or routing between the two-tier and other external networks (e.g., the Internet), a modified version of the conventional Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol is employed. The OSPF protocol is basically a routing protocol employed for Internet Protocol (IP) type networks, while the modified protocol or Radio Open Shortest Path First (ROSPF) protocol is similar to OSPF, but is adapted for use with radio or wireless networks. For examples of implementation of the OSPF Protocol, reference is made to RFC 1583, Moy, "OSPF Version 2," March 1994, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Thus, the ROSPF protocol is basically an internetworking or gateway protocol facilitating communications with external networks.<br>
Routing is accomplished in the OSPF protocol by each network node having a routing database containing information related to network topology (e.g., links between network nodes). The routing database is utilized by each node to determine a path for transmitting a message to a destination site. The routing databases are updated by exchanging Link,- State Advertisement (LSA) packets between neighboring nodes. These packets generally include information related to current links of network nodes and are typically transferred periodically and/or in the event of a modification to the network topology. The OSPF protocol designates a particular router to flood LSA packets to neighbors in broadcast type networks, while LSA packets are transmitted via point-to-point and/or broadcast packets within non-broadcast type networks. The ROSPF protocol employed by the two-tier network described above is similar oto the OSPF protocol and exchanges LSA type packets between neighbors (e.g., cluster head and member nodes) to synchronize routing databases as described above. Since the two-tier network is not a broadcast type network, an LSA packet is sent as a point-to-point message to each of its protocol neighbors.<br>
The above-described technique for transmitting LSA packets on the two-tier network suffers from several disadvantages. In particular, the intranet and ROSPF protocols generate control traffic where the amount of traffic increases with network size. In fact, the amount of ROSPF overhead traffic increases at a significantly greater rate than network capacity as network size increases, thereby degrading network performance. Although the ROSPF protocol introduces additional overhead in initializing neighbors and exchanging database descriptions, the predominant portion of the overhead is attributed to the flooding or transmission of LSA packets. As a result of the rate of increased overhead, the network<br>
2<br><br>
becomes unsuitable to transport user traffic or maintain a functioning state when the network includes greaterthan approximately one-hundred fifty nodes. Since the two-tier network may employ a maximum of approximately one-thousand nodes, the increased overhead limits performance of small-scale networks and restricts deployment of the protocol for large-scale networks.<br>
The present invention overcomes the aforementioned problems and achieves transmission of LS A type or database update packets for synchronization of node routing databases with a reduced rate of overhead increase in relation to network size.   This is accomplished by inserting the &amp;OSPF protocol database update packets within intranet protocol beacon type or node status packets to reduce the rate of protocol overhead. The node status packets are periodically transmitted by cluster member and cluster head nodes to advertise the presence of that node to the network. The present invention minimizes the impact of protocol overhead on network throughput, and permits an ROSPF type protocol to beutilized on large-scale wireless networks. Thus, networks may employ theprotocol, while scaling to a greater size.<br>

The aforesaid objects may be achieved individually and/or in combination, and it is not intended that the present invention be construed as requiring two or more of the objects to be combined unless expressly required by the claims attached hereto.<br>
According to the present invention , Link-State Advertisement (LSA) type or database update messages or packets of an internetworking protocol are transmitted within a wireless communication system or network via insertion of the packet within packets of an intranet protocol. Specially, a wireless network includes a plurality of nodes arranged into clusters<br>
-3B-<br><br>
with each cluster having cluster member nodes and a designated cluster head node. The nodes communicate with each other via an intranet protocol, while the network may communicate with other external networks in accordance with an internetworking protocol (e.g., a modified version of the conventional Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol, or a Radio Open Shortest Path First (ROSPF) protocol). A database within each network node contains link information for that node, while the ROSPF LSA type packets contain information to update the node databases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Network nodes according to the present invention arranged in an exemplary two-tier wireless network are illustrated in Fig. 1A. Specifically, wireless network 2 includes a<br>
4<br><br>
plurality of nodes 10 arranged in cells or clusters 12. Each cell or cluster includes corresponding cluster member nodes 10 with one of those cluster member nodes designated as a cluster head node or base station 14. These cluster arrangements form the first tier of network 2 and facilitate communication within a cluster between the cluster head and member nodes preferably utilizing a first transmission frequency. The head nodes of each cluster are in communication with each other, preferably utilizing a second transmission frequency, and form a backbone network 16. The backbone network essentially forms the second tier of network 2 and facilitates communications between nodes of different clusters (e.g., generally providing communications over greater distances). The architecture of network 2 is similar to that of conventional cellular telephone systems, except that network 2 employs an intranet protocol (e.g., a protocol for communications within the two-tier network) providing dynamic selection of cells and cluster head nodes as described below.<br>
A network node 10 according to the present invention is illustrated in Fig. 1B. Specifically, node 10 includes a transmitter 22, a receiver 24 and a processor 26. The processor is preferably implemented by a conventional microprocessor or controller and controls the node to transmit and receive messages in accordance with the communication protocols described below. The transmitter is preferably implemented by a conventional transmitter and transmits messages from the processor, preferably in the form of radio frequency (RF) signals, in accordance with processor instructions. Receiver 24 is typically implemented by a conventional receiver and configured to receive signals, preferably inihe form of radio frequency (RF) signals, transmitted by the transmitter of another node. The receiver receives transmitted signals and forwards the received signals to processor 26 for processing. A present invention head node 14 is substantially similar to node 10 described above.<br>
The arrangement of nodes 10 within clusters 12 and the designation of cluster head nodes 14 are dynamically determined by an intranet protocol that handles routing of packets within network 2. The intranet protocol is preferably a link-state type routing protocol that is implemented on backbone network 16. Cluster head nodes 14 each maintain a database including information enabling the cluster head to determine appropriate paths for routing messages through the network. The information typically relates to links between the various network nodes. The cluster head databases are synchronized in accordance with the protocol<br>
5<br><br>
by transference of Link-State Advertisement (LSA) packets between cluster head nodes that provide network information to update the databases. In addition, each node (e.g., cluster head and member nodes) periodically broadcasts abeacon type or node status packet in accordance with the intranet protocol. This packet basically advertises the presence of a node within the network. The rate of transmission of a node status packet by a cluster head node is significantly greater than the transmission rate for that packet by a cluster member node since cluster head node status packets are typically utilized for "keep alive" and neighbor discovery purposes. Thus, the time interval (TCH) between transmissions of node status packets by a cluster head node is significantly ;less than the corresponding time interval (TCM) between transmissions of those packets by a cluster member node.<br>
With respect to communications between network 2 and other external networks (e.g., the Internet), the network employs a Radio Open Shortest Path First (ROSPF) protocol. This protocol is basically a modified version of the conventional Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol commonly utilized for Internet Protocol (IP) type networks. Since the OSPF protocol generates significant overhead when applied to ad-hoc networks (e.g., networks having temporary or wireless connections where communication devices are part of the network during a communication session or, in the case of mobile systems, while in proximity to the network), such as network 2, that protocol has been modified to derive the ROSPF protocol suitable for use with wireless or radio networks. According to the ROSPF protocol, each node within network 2 maintains a routing database including information enabling the node to determine an appropriate path for routing a message to the external network. The information contained within the node databases typically relates to links between the various network nodes. The ROSPF protocol is a link-state type routing protocol and provides for synchronization of node databases through transmission of Link-State Advertisement (LSA) type or database update packets to each network node. These packets are conventionally transmitted to each neighboring network node via plural point-to-point messages (e.g., messages from a source node to a specific destination network node) in response to changes in network topology, an external network connected to network 2 or other modifications to the network facilitating changes in a node database. When a database update packet is received, a point-to-point OSPF type acknowledgment (ACK) packet is commonly transmitted to the source node from the destination node to indicate packet reception.<br>
6<br><br>
The present invention basically employs an enhanced technique to transmit the ROSPF database update packets within network 2, while reducing overhead traffic. In particular, a member node 10 of a cluster 12 transmits a database update packet to a corresponding cluster head node 14 via a point-to-point message as described above. Since the cluster head node is in communication with its corresponding cluster member nodes, reduced transmissions may be realized if one reliable broadcast message is utilized to transmit the database update packet. Further, the broadcast message may be utilized to transmit the database update packet to neighboring cluster head nodes that further transmit the packet in a like manner, thereby facilitating transmission of the packet throughout network 2. Accordingly, the present invention provides for transmission of the received database update packets by the cluster head node to its corresponding member nodes and neighboring network cluster head nodes within intranet protocol beacon type or node status packets that are periodically transmitted throughout the network as described above. Since the node status packets typically contain a relatively low quantity of data, there exists sufficient storage within that packet to contain at least one database update packet. Thus, significant reduction in transmission overhead may be achieved through use of intranet protocol node status packets to transmit the ROSPF database update packets. In addition, reception of database update packets by cluster head nodes is impliedly acknowledged (e.g., without transmission ofspecificpoint-to-pointtypeacknowledgmentpackets) as described below. The cluster head nodes subsequently transmit the database update packets in a like manner to their neighbors to facilitate transmission of the packet throughout network 2.<br>
The node status packets are preferably transmitted utilizing a reliable broadcast technique, such as the scheme disclosed in the co-pending U.S. Patent Application having Docket No. 0918.0033C, entitled "Method and Apparatus for Broadcasting Messages in Channel Reservation Communication Systems" and filed November 3,2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In order to enhance performance reliability, the node status packets may be transmitted two or more times. If transmission of broadcast messages achieves a ninety percent success rate, transmitting those messages twice enhances that rate to approximately ninety-nine percent. Accordingly, the database update packets are preferably transmitted twice for improved reliability as described below.<br>
The intranet protocol typically includes several layers to facilitate communications<br>
7<br><br>
betweennetwork nodes, and is typicdlyimplemented by the processors of thosenodes. Packet concatenation functions are generally accomplished within the intranet protocol by a layer that passes traffic from a protocol intranet layer to a protocol link layer and from the link layer to appropriate intranet layer modules. Since insertion of ROSPF database update packets within intranet protocol node status packets is basically a type of packet concatenation, this process is preferably implemented within the intranet protocol concatenation layer.<br>
The node status packets are periodically transmitted in accordance with the intranet protocol as described above. However, those packets may not be immediately available to transport a database update packet to other network nodes in the event that a database update packet is received or generated within the time interval between transmission of the node status packets. Accordingly, a queue, preferably in the form of a First In First Out (FIFO) queue, is utilized by a node processor to store update database packets until a node status packet is available for transmission. The database update packets are initially placed onto the queue upon receipt by the intranet protocol concatenation layer. When a node status packet is generated for transmission, the concatenation layer inserts an appropriate quantity of database update packets stored in the queue into the node status packet The quantity of database update packets inserted into the node status packet is based on the size of the stored database update packets and the amount of available storage capacity within the node status packet. The integrated node status and database update packet is subsequently processed and transmitted in accordance with the intranet protocol. Since the database update packets are preferably transmitted two or more times, each instance of a particular database packet is placed within a different node status packet for reliability purposes. For example, when a database update packet is to be transmitted twice, that database update packet is placed within two separate node status packets. The database update packets remain on the queue until the desired quantity of transmissions have occurred.<br>
The manner in which a node processor facilitates transmission or flooding of a database update packet according to the present invention is illustrated in Fig. 2. Specifically, an event (e.g., change in network topology, external network connected to network 2, reception of a database update packet, etc.) triggering transmission of a database update packet by a node occurs at step 30. If the node is designated as a cluster head node as determined at step 32, a database update packet is generated and transmitted or broadcasted<br>
8<br><br>
to neighboring nodes the desired quantity of times at step 34. In particular, the generated database update packet is placed on a queue for transmission within an available intranet protocol node status packet as described above. The node status packet is periodically broadcasted through the network by each node to indicate the node's presence within the network as described above. In response to an available node status packet, the database update packet is removed from the queue and placed within the available packet for transmission to neighboring nodes via a reliable transmission scheme, such as the technique disclosed in the above-referenced co-pending application. Subsequent transmission of the database update packet the desired quantity of times, a timer for re-transmission of the database update packet to cluster head neighboring nodes is set at step 36 to preferably two and one-half times the time interval (TCH) between transmissions of node status packets by a cluster head node. Similarly, a timer for re-transmission of a database update packet to corresponding member nodes is set at step 38 to preferably two and one-half times the time interval (TCM) between transmissions of node status packets by a cluster member node. Since the database update packets are preferably transmitted two or more times to provide enhanced reliability, re-transmission of a database update packet to a succeeding hop should not be attempted in response to unacknowledged transmissions of that packet until the hop has had sufficient time to broadcast the database update packet the desired quantity of transmissions. Thus, the respective re-transmission timers are set at a minimum to the quantity of desired broadcast transmissions for adatabaseupdatepacketmultipliedbytheappropriatenode status packet transmission interval for a cluster head or member node. Accordingly, since the present invention preferably transmits database update packets twice, the re-transmission timers are set, by way of example only, to approximately two and one-half times the appropriate node transmission intervals to provide a sufficient margin for re-transmission of database update packets. However, the re-transmission timers may be set to any desired intervals.<br>
If the node transmitting the database update packet in response to an event is a cluster member node as determined at step 32, a database update packet is generated and transmitted as a point-to-point message to the corresponding cluster head node at step 40. Further, the timer for re-transmission of the database update packet is preferably set, by way of example only, to two and one-half times the time interval (TCT) between transmissions of node status packets by a cluster head node. The timer is set to this value to provide sufficient time for the<br>
9<br><br>
receiving cluster head node to transmit the database update packet to neighboring nodes for the desired quantity of transmissions prior to re-transmission of that database update packet as described above. In the event a re-transmission timer of a cluster head or member node expires, database update packets transmitted by the node that have not been acknowledged are re-transmitted as point-to-point messages to those neighbors associated with the expired timer (e.g., cluster head or member nodes) and not acknowledging receipt of the transmitted packets.<br>
The manner in which a node processor processes received database update packets according to the present invention is illustrated in Fig. 3. Initially, a database update packet is received by a node at step 50. The node may be a cluster head or member node where the database update packet may be received from a neighboring cluster head node either within an intranet protocol node status packet or as a point-to-point message for re-transmission of unacknowledged packets as described above. Alternatively, the node may be a cluster head node where the database update packet may be received from a corresponding member node as a point-to-point message as described above. If the packet is received from a node that is not a neighbor as determined from the node database at step 52, the packet is dropped at step 54. When the packet is received from a neighboring node, the node processor determines whether or not the received packet has already been received at step 56. If the packet has not been received, the packet is processed at step 64. This typically includes updating the node database with corresponding information contained in the received packet and flooding that packet within the network in the appropriate manner for a cluster head or member node described above. When the receiving node has been designated a cluster member node as determined at step 66, an OSPF type acknowledgment packet is sent to the sender of the received packet as a broadcast message at step 68. This packet is typically broadcasted via insertion within node status packets in substantially the same manner described above for database update packets. If the receiving node has been designated as a cluster head node, acknowledgments are implied in accordance with transmissions of database update packets as described below.<br>
When the receiving node has already received the arriving database update packet as determined at step 56, the processor determines at step 58 if the received packet is a point-to-point message for re-transmission of an unacknowledged database update packet. If the<br>
10<br><br>
message is a re-transmission of an unacknowledged database update packet, an OSPF type acknowledgment packet is transmitted to the sender as a point-to-point message at step 62. Otherwise, the packet is processed as an implied acknowledgment for database update packets transmitted by the receiving node. Basically, a network node interprets reception of a database update packet from a neighboring cluster head or member node as an acknowledgment when the receiving node is expecting an acknowledgment from the neighbor for the same database update packet previously sent to that neighbor by the receiving node. For example, an implied acknowledgment received by a cluster head or member node from a neighboring cluster head node may be in the form of a broadcasted database update packet when the neighboring cluster head node broadcasts a database update packet received from that cluster head or member node. Alternatively, the implied acknowledgment received by a cluster head node from a corresponding member node may be in the form of a point-to-point message when the cluster head node broadcasts a database update packet received from that membernode. Thus, reception of a database update packet by areceiving node that previously transmitted the received packet indicates reception of that packet by the sending node (e.g., the node sending the implied acknowledgment). The various packets typically include identifiers or other information to indicate the source node and type of message (e.g., broadcast, point-to-point, node status packet, etc.) being sent.<br>
Since the present invention utilizes intranet protocol node status packets to flood or broadcast ROSPF database update packets, limited additional packets are generated. In fact, the present invention typically requires one point-to-point message to transmit a database update packet across the exemplary two-tier network. Basically, the present invention sacrifices node status packet size for lower flooding packet rate. The node status and database update packets are relatively small in size, thereby minimizing impact on network performance. Further, the relatively small size of these packets reduces the database update packet flooding rate to drastically enhance network performance. Specifically, the conventional flooding technique within the ROSPF protocol described above requires H (e.g., where H is an integer generally greater than zero) point-to-point messages to flood one database update packet to an entire network. The value of H may be determined as follows:<br>
H = 2N(C + M) where C is an integer generally greater than zero and represents the average quantity of cluster<br>
11<br><br>
member nodes within a cluster; M is an integer generally greater than zero and represents the average quantity of cluster head node neighbors; and N is an integer generally greater than zero and represents the quantity of cluster head nodes in a network. Table I below indicates the quantity of required transmissions to flood the database update packet within networks having various exemplary configurations. Since the present invention typically requires one point-to-point message, the protocol overhead is drastically reduced.<br>
Table I<br><br>
In addition, the present invention has been simulated using a network simulation tool (e.g., OPNET available from Mil 3, Inc.). The results of the simulation indicating overhead generated by the present invention in relation to overhead generated by conventional flooding schemes is illustrated in Fig. 4. Thus, as Table I and Fig, 4 illustrate, the present invention significantly reduces generated overhead traffic during flooding.<br>
The ROSPF database update packets are carried by intranet protocol node status packets to the next-hop destinations in accordance with the present invention. Since the node status packets are periodically transmitted and generally not immediately available, the present invention introduces latency when transmitting the database update packets to network nodes. However, the introduced latency has a minimal effect on protocol performance in the network. For example, network 2 may cover an area of one-hundred kilometers by two-hundred<br>
12<br><br>
kilometers where flooding a database update packet typically requires less than twenty hops to cover a two-hundred kilometer distance depending upon the node radio range. Thus, a maximum delay for reception of a database update packet by a node is 20TCH or one-hundred seconds where the cluster head transmission interval (TCH) is approximately five seconds. Since the maximum life span of a database update packet is approximately one-hour, the delays or latency introduced by the present invention are small in comparison to that life span (e.g., less than 3% of the maximum database update packet life span).<br>
It will be appreciated that the embodiments described above and illustrated in the drawings represent only a few of the many ways of implementing a method and apparatus for transmission of node link status messages throughout anetworkwith reduced communication protocol overhead traffic.<br>
