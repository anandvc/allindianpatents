				<td>Stabilized unsaturated polyester resin mixtures<br>
The invention relates to unsaturated polyester resin<br>
mixtures stabilized with respect to demixing, to their<br>
preparation, and to the use of block copolymers based<br>
on ethylenically unsaturated monomers in unsaturated<br>
polyester resin mixtures.<br>
Moulding compositions based on unsaturated polyester<br>
resin systems are widely used in the form of SMC (sheet<br>
moulding compounds), BMC (bulk moulding compounds), DMC<br>
(dough moulding compounds) , TMC (thick moulding<br>
compounds) or LDMC (low density moulding compounds) in<br>
production of mouldings. To this end, the resins are<br>
treated with inert fillers and with fibrous reinforcing<br>
materials. When the mouldings are compressed, the resin<br>
hardens via polymerization. In this process, the<br>
unsaturated polyester resin bonds to unsaturated<br>
monomers present in the formulation, for example<br>
styrene or divinylbenzene. The hardening process is<br>
generally a free-radical process and is initiated by an<br>
added free-radical initiator which is activated via the<br>
rise in temperature during the compression procedure.<br>
The reinforcing fibres and the fillers, and also the<br>
pigments, are present homogeneously distributed in this<br>
polymeric matrix.<br>
During the polymerization process, shrinkage of the<br>
parts takes place. In order to counter this shrinkage,<br>
shrinkage-reducing components known as LS additives<br>
(low-shrink additives) or LP additives (low-profile<br>
additives) are added to the mixture. These shrinkage-<br>
reducing components are mostly thermoplastics, such as<br>
polystyrenes or polyacrylates. Thickeners from the<br>
group of the metal oxides or metal hydroxides of the<br>
first to third main group of the Periodic Table of the<br>
Elements are mostly added to the mixture in order that<br><br>
viscosity of the resin formulation allows it to be<br>
handled during the compression procedure. The viscosity<br>
of the mixture rises in an "ageing process", until the<br>
consistency of the composition is cuttable but still<br>
mouldable. Depending on the application, other<br>
additives, such as release agents, are added to the<br>
unsaturated polyester resin mixtures.<br>
The individual components in unsaturated polyester<br>
resin systems do not form a stable mixture with one<br>
another. However, in order to produce a homogeneous<br>
moulding, the properties of whose material remain the<br>
same throughout the entire volume, all of the<br>
components have to be present in a stable, homogeneous<br>
mixture during the compression procedure. However, a<br>
stable and homogeneous mixture of all of the components<br>
in the unsaturated polyester resin systems is also<br>
essential during storage of the premix in its thickened<br>
or non-thickened form.<br>
US 3 836 600 describes the compatibilizing effect of<br>
block copolymers which contain a polyethylene oxide<br>
block and contain a block which contains ethylenically<br>
unsaturated, aromatic monomers and/or conjugated diene<br>
monomers, in curable plastics mixtures, such as<br>
unsaturated polyester resin mixtures.<br>
US 3 887 515 describes the viscosity-reducing effect of<br>
polyalkylene-oxide-containing block copolymers in<br>
unsaturated polyester resin mixtures.<br>
US 3 988 388 discloses the use of ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate copolymers with from 60 to 99% of vinyl acetate<br>
content, polyacrylates having long-chain alkyl groups,<br>
and cellulose derivatives for dispersion of shrinkage-<br>
reducing components of the ethylene-vinyl acetate or<br>
ethylene-vinyl propionate copolymer class.<br><br>
US 4 491 642 and 4 555 534 describe the use of<br>
surfactant substances, such as silicones or polyethers<br>
in combination with vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride<br>
polymers as shrinkage-reducing component for more<br>
uniform colouring of SMCs and BMCs with pigments.<br>
US 5 162 401 and 5 256 709 describe polyethers and,<br>
respectively, aromatic hydrocarbons which are<br>
compatible with the unsaturated polyester and with the<br>
monomer not only in the cold mixture but also during<br>
the hardening procedure, in unsaturated polyester resin<br>
mixtures, for improvement of surface smoothness,<br>
specifically in SMC parts.<br>
The disadvantage of the compounds hitherto described is<br>
the restricted compatibility with respect to certain<br>
components, e.g. with respect to certain shrinkage-<br>
reducing components or certain fillers in unsaturated<br>
polyester resin systems. For universal applicability,<br>
however, broadly based compatibility of the additive in<br>
the unsaturated polyester resin systems is needed.<br>
The object of this invention is provision of a<br>
homogeneous, unsaturated polyester resin mixture which<br>
comprises reinforcing fibre and is intended for<br>
pressure-curing moulding compositions, and which<br>
comprises less mixture-stabilizing additives than the<br>
prior art, and where the mixture-stabilizing additives<br>
provide broadly based compatibility. In particular, the<br>
viscosity of the unsaturated polyester resin mixture is<br>
not to be reduced, because viscosity reduction promotes<br>
demixing of the polyester resin mixture.<br>
The object of the invention is achieved via provision<br>
of an unsaturated polyester resin mixture which can be<br>
cured by applying external pressure and which<br>
encompasses at least the following components:<br><br>
a)	an unsaturated polyester resin whose weight-<br>
average molar mass is from 500 to 5000 g/mol;<br>
b)	an ethylenically unsaturated monomer;<br>
c)	a shrinkage-reducing component;<br>
d)	an inert filler; and<br>
e)	a reinforcing fibre; and<br>
f)	from 0.01 to 1% by weight of a block copolymer,<br>
based on the total weight of the unsaturated<br>
polyester resin mixture comprising reinforcing<br>
fibre, where the block copolymer encompasses at<br>
least one A block and encompasses at least one B<br>
block, where the<br>
A block contains at least one amine-containing,<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer incorporated by<br>
polymerization into the polymer; and the<br>
B block contains at least one alkyl- and/or<br>
phenyl-containing, ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer incorporated by polymerization into the<br>
polymer, and is free from amine-containing,<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers incorporated by<br>
polymerization into the polymer.<br>
In general, any of the conventional unsaturated<br>
polyester resins (UP resins) can serve as unsaturated<br>
polyester resin of component a). Any of the<br>
commercially available UP resins is in essence<br>
suitable. In particular, UP resins can be prepared from<br>
dibasic carboxylic acids and carboxylic anhydrides, of<br>
which at least one compound has to be unsaturated, and<br>
from dihydric alcohols and epoxides.<br>
Examples of dibasic unsaturated carboxylic acids and<br>
carboxylic acid derivatives are maleic acid, fumaric<br>
acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic<br>
acid and HET acid (hexachloroendomethylenetetrahydro-<br>
phthalic acid) , and also the anhydrides of the<br>
carboxylic acids mentioned. However, adipic acid and<br>
glutaric acid, or Diels-Alder adducts composed of<br><br>
maleic anhydride and cyclopentadiene can also be used<br>
as dibasic carboxylic acid component. Concomitant use<br>
can also be made of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid<br>
during preparation of UP resins.<br>
A dihydric alcohol component that can in particular be<br>
used is propylene, dipropylene, ethylene, diethylene,<br>
or neopentyl glycol, or else 1,4-butanediol and 2,2,4-<br>
trimethylpentane-1,3-diol. An example of another<br>
compound that can be used is the diglycidyl ether of<br>
tetrabromobisphenol.<br>
Alongside the dibasic carboxylic acids and dihydric<br>
alcohols, it is possible to use alcohols and carboxylic<br>
acids of higher functionality, giving branched<br>
polycondensates.<br>
The ethylenically unsaturated monomers of component b)<br>
react with the double bonds of the polyester chains by<br>
a free-radical polymerization mechanism and thus give<br>
crosslinking, i.e. curing of the products.<br>
If the ethylenically unsaturated monomers b) are<br>
electronegative comonomers, such as styrehe or vinyl<br>
acetate, the product can by way of example be<br>
"alternating" copolymers. These are copolymers which<br>
have relatively short crosslinking bridges and thus<br>
give relatively hard thermosets. Comonomers which are<br>
more electropositive, e.g. methyl methacrylate, in<br>
contrast tend to form relatively long methyl<br>
methacrylate blocks between the polyester chains, and<br>
give corresponding softer thermosets. Specific resins<br>
can also comprise vinyltoluene, a-methylstyrene or<br>
diallyl phthalate, for example, as component b).<br>
The shrinkage-reducing components c) used in this<br>
context in particular comprise the compounds termed LS<br>
additives or LP additives in the literature. Among<br><br>
these are, by way of example, polyethylenes and their<br>
copolymers, polystyrenes and their copolymers,<br>
saturated polyesters, cellulose acetobutyrate,<br>
polyacrylates, such as polymethyl methacrylate,<br>
polyvinyl acetates and their copolymers, styrene-<br>
butadiene copolymers and mixtures of these polymers.<br>
Examples of suitable inert fillers d) are naturally<br>
occurring and synthetic chalk (CaCOs) , aluminum<br>
trihydrate (ATH), kaolin, talc, feldspat, metal oxides,<br>
powdered quartz and rock flour.<br>
Examples of reinforcing fibres e) are glass fibres, in<br>
particular those composed of low-alkali borosilicate<br>
glass, synthetic organic fibres (e.g. polyesters,<br>
polyamides, aramids), carbon fibres and naturally<br>
occurring organic fibres (e.g. cellulose).<br>
The inventive unsaturated polyester resin mixtures<br>
which cure under pressure can moreover comprise other<br>
components.<br>
Among these are by way of example processing additives,<br>
such as release agents and antifoams, stabilizers, such<br>
as antioxidants, light stabilizers, heat stabilizers<br>
and flame retardants, bulk modifiers, such as adhesion<br>
promoters, wetting agents, plasticizers, thickeners,<br>
impact modifiers and blowing agents, and also surface<br>
modifiers, such as antistatic agents. There is<br>
absolutely no restriction on the selection of these<br>
additives, and they are selected in a known manner as a<br>
function of the intended use.<br>
The inventive polyester resin mixtures can moreover, if<br>
desired, also comprise organic and inorganic pigments<br>
or dyes.<br><br>
Block copolymers are described in WO 01/44389 as<br>
wetting and dispersing agents for aqueous pigment-<br>
containing preparations. WO 00/40630 claims the use of<br>
the same polymer structures for production of pigment<br>
preparations which are suitable for formulation of<br>
pigmented coating compositions or inks. Both<br>
specifications describe the dispersion of pigments with<br>
block copolymers, also in the presence of typical paint<br>
binders based on polyester resins. The viscosity of the<br>
pigment preparation is lowered here.<br>
In the case of the inventive unsaturated polyester<br>
resin mixtures, no viscosity-lowering effect is<br>
observed in the inventive unsaturated polyester resin<br>
mixtures with the amounts of the block copolymers. Nor<br>
is the lowering of viscosity desirable, because lower<br>
viscosity of the unsaturated polyester resin mixture<br>
accelerates separation.<br>
The block copolymers f) used in the unsaturated<br>
polyester resin mixtures are preferably prepared by<br>
processes involving controlled living polymerization.<br>
Examples of these polymerization processes are known to<br>
a person of average skill in the art and are described<br>
inter alia in the following articles and patent<br>
specifications :<br>
1)	"Reversible Addition Fragmentation Chain Transfer<br>
Process" (RAFT) as described by way of example in<br>
Polym. Int. 2000, 49, 993, US 6 291 620,<br>
WO 98/01478, WO 98/58974 and WO 99/31144.<br>
2)	Controlled polymerization with nitroxyl compounds<br>
as polymerization regulators (NMP), as described<br>
by way of example in Chem. Rev. 2001, 101, 3661.<br>
3)	"Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization" (ATRP), as<br>
described by way of example in Chem. Rev. 2001,<br>
101, 2921.<br><br>
4) "Group Transfer Polymerization" (GTP), as described<br>
by way of example by 0. W. Webster in "Group<br>
Transfer Polymerization", in "Encyclopedia of<br>
Polymer Science and Engineering", volume 7, H. F.<br>
Mark, N. M. Bikales, C. G. Overberger and<br>
G. Menges, Eds., Wiley Interscience, New York<br>
1987, pp. 580 et seq.<br>
Suitable reaction conditions, monomers and solvents<br>
known to a person of average skill in the art are to be<br>
selected as a function of polymerization method.<br>
According to the invention, the copolymers used as<br>
block copolymers are characterized by a sharp<br>
transition in monomer constitution along the polymer<br>
chain, defining the boundary between the individual<br>
blocks. This sharp transition in monomer constitution<br>
is achieved in the abovementioned process involving<br>
controlled living polymerization via sequential<br>
addition of the monomers or monomer mixtures.<br>
In order to qualify as a block of a block copolymer, a<br>
block has to be composed of at least three monomer<br>
units. The blocks themselves can have a structure, such<br>
as a random structure, an alternating structure, a<br>
block structure, or a gradient structure.<br>
The number-average molar mass of the block copolymers<br>
is preferably from 1000 g/mol to 200 000 g/mol,<br>
particularly preferably from 2000 g/mol to 50 000 g/mol<br>
and very particularly preferably from 2000 g/mol to<br>
20 000 g/mol.<br>
Preferred examples of block copolymer structures are AB<br>
or BA diblock copolymers, ABA or BAB triblock<br>
copolymers, or triblock copolymers which can contain,<br>
alongside at least one A block and at least one B<br>
block, one or more other blocks (C blocks), where this<br><br>
block does not fall within the definition of the A<br>
block or within the definition of the B block. In the<br>
case of the ABA and BAB triblock copolymers, the two A<br>
blocks in the first case and respectively the two B<br>
blocks in the second case can have different structures<br>
independently of one another, as long as they comply<br>
with the above definitions. By way of example,<br>
therefore, the first B block of a BAB triblock<br>
copolymer can differ with respect to length and/or<br>
monomer constitution from the second B block on the<br>
other side of the A block. However, among the above<br>
structures particular preference is given to the<br>
diblock structures.<br>
Each A block of__the block	copolymer f) present in the<br>
inventive polyester resin mixture preferably contains<br>
at least 10% by weight, particularly preferably at<br>
least 25% by weight, and more preferably at least^ 50%<br>
by weight, of one or more amine-containing<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers incorporated by<br>
polymerization, based on the total weight of the said A<br>
block.<br>
Examples of ethylenically unsaturated monomers which<br>
contain amine groups are mentioned below (the term<br>
(meth)acrylate here and in the entire specification<br>
including both acrylates and methacrylates): aminoalkyl<br>
(meth)acrylates and aminoalkyl(meth)acrylamides, e.g.<br>
N,N-dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate, N,N-dimethyl-<br>
aminopropyl (meth)acrylate, N, N-dimethylamino-<br>
propyl(meth)acrylamide and 2-butylaminoethyl<br>
methacrylate; or ethylenically unsaturated N<br>
heterocycles which can form salts with acids, e.g.<br>
2-vinylpyridine, 4-vinylpyridine and vinylimidazole.<br>
Each B block of the block copolymer f) present in the<br>
inventive polyester resin mixture preferably contains<br>
at least 25% by weight, more preferably at least 50% by<br><br>
methacrylate, 3,4-dihydroxybutyl methacrylate, 2-<br>
hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate;<br>
(meth)acrylates of ethers, of polyethylene glycols, of<br>
polypropylene glycols or of mixed<br>
poly(ethylene/propylene) glycols having from 5 to 80<br>
carbon atoms, e.g. tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate,<br>
vinyloxyethoxyethyl methacrylate, methoxyethoxyethyl<br>
methacrylate, cyclohexyloxymethyl methacrylate,<br>
methoxymethoxyethyl methacrylate, benzyloxymethyl<br>
methacrylate, furfuryl methacrylate, 2-butoxyethyl<br>
methacrylate, 2-ethoxyethoxymethyl methacrylate, 2-<br>
ethoxyethyl methacrylate, allyloxymethyl methacrylate,<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (meth)acrylate and<br>
poly(propylene glycol) methyl ether (meth)acrylate;<br>
caprolactone and/or valerolactone-modified hydroxyalkyl<br>
(meth)acrylates having an average molecular weight Mn<br>
of from 220 to 1200, where the hydroxy (meth)acrylates<br>
preferably derive from straight-chain, branched or<br>
cycloaliphatic diols having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms;<br>
and methacrylonitrile and acrylonitrile.<br>
Another object of the present invention consisted in<br>
providing the inventive unsaturated polyester resin<br>
mixture for moulding composition's which can be cured<br>
under pressure with mixture-stabilizing additives which<br>
can be incorporated into the polymeric matrix during<br>
hardening of the unsaturated polyester resin and thus<br>
inhibit occurrence of undesired effects, such as<br>
exudation of the additive.<br>
This object is in particular achieved in that the block<br>
copolymers f) are prepared by way of example by means<br>
of the abovementioned NMP or RAFT technologies, in<br>
which the polymerization regulator used during the<br>
preparation process remains on the block copolymer<br>
chain end. During hardening of the resin it is<br>
therefore possible for chain extension of the block<br><br>
weight, and particularly preferably 100% by weight, of<br>
at least one alkyl- and/or phenyl-containing,<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer incorporated by<br>
polymerization, based on the total weight of the<br>
respective B block. The monomers which characterize the<br>
B block can moreover also be present in the A block.<br>
Examples of ethylenically unsaturated monomers which<br>
contain phenyl groups are aryl (meth)acrylates, such as<br>
benzyl methacrylate or phenyl acrylate, where the aryl<br>
radicals in each case are unsubstituted or may have up<br>
to five substituents, an example being 4-nitrophenyl<br>
methacrylate; or styrene and substituted styrenes, e.g.<br>
4-methylstyrene, 4-vinylbenzoic acid and sodium<br>
4-vinylbenzenesulphonate.<br>
Examples of ethylenically unsaturated monomers which<br>
contain alkyl groups are the following: alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylates of straight-chain, branched or<br>
cycloaliphatic alcohols having from 1 to 22 carbon<br>
atoms, examples being methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, isobutyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, tert-butyl (meth)acrylate, lauryl<br>
(meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, stearyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate, isobornyl<br>
(meth)acrylate and tert-butyl (meth)acrylate.<br>
Other monomers can be constituents of the optional C<br>
blocks and can be freely selected among the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers which do not fall<br>
within the definitions of the monomers of the A or B<br>
blocks. However, these monomers can also be present in<br>
the A block and/or B block.<br>
Examples of these ethylenically unsaturated monomers<br>
are inter alia: hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates of<br>
straight-chain, branched or cycloaliphatic diols having<br>
from 2 to 36 carbon atoms, e.g. 3-hydroxypropyl<br><br>
copolymer to take place, so that the block copolymer<br>
becomes incorporated into the polymeric matrix of the<br>
unsaturated polyester resin, and this inhibits<br>
subsequent exudation of the block copolymer.<br>
Examples of polymerization regulators for NMP are<br>
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl (TEMPO) and N-tert-<br>
butyl-N-[1-diethylphosphono(2,2-dimethyl-<br>
propyl)]nitroxyl. Examples of polymerization regulators<br>
for RAFT are thiocarboxylic esters or xanthogenic<br>
esters. Other examples are disclosed in the literature<br>
listed above and are known to a person of average skill<br>
in the art.<br>
In one particular embodiment, components a) - d) and of<br>
the block copolymer f) are mixed with one another. The<br>
requirement placed upon this mixture is that it remains<br>
in essence homogeneous during storage and does not<br>
separate. The further component e) and the thickener<br>
are usually not added until a subsequent juncture, and<br>
the entire mixture is usually homogenized before it is<br>
pressed to give mouldings, whereupon the resin mixture<br>
polymerizes during the compression procedure, in<br>
essence without demixing of the components.<br>

Preparation and assessment of unsaturated polyester<br>
resin mixture:<br>
Components 1-5 are added in the formulation sequence<br>
and manually mixed, and then homogenized. Component 6<br>
is then incorporated by stirring. The mixture is<br>
charged to a 100 ml beaded-edge glass vessel with snap<br>
lid and stored at room temperature. After 24 hours the<br>
specimens are visually assessed for homogeneity.<br>
Table 1<br>
Polymer	Amount of polymer Homogeneity assessment	<br>
Zero specimen	marked separation<br>
(no polymer)<br>
Comparative	1 g	marked separation<br>
Example 1<br>
Polymer 1	0.5 g	no separation<br>
Polymer 2	0.5 g	no separation<br>
Polymer 3	0.5 g	no separation<br>
Polymer 4	0.5 g	no separation<br>
Polymer 5	0.5 g	no separation<br>
Viscosity reduction is not observed in any of the<br>
examples using polymers 1-5.<br><br>
The pigment cobalt blue permits better assessment of<br>
the homogeneity of the unsaturated polyester resin<br>
mixture, but is not usually used in practice.<br>
A random copolymer is selected as Comparative Example 1<br>
in order to permit assessment of the significance of<br>
the block-type structure of the inventive polymers with<br>
respect to mixture-stabilizing action.<br>
The results of the application-related examples<br>
presented in Table 1 show that when the block<br>
copolymers "Polymer 1" to "Polymer 5" are used it is<br>
possible to obtain significantly better mixture-<br>
stabilizing action in the unsaturated polyester resin<br>
mixtures than with the comparable, random-structure<br>
polymer of Comparative Example 1.<br>
Test formulation SMC Electrogrey - RAL 7032<br>
The SMC formulation stated in Table 2 was prepared by<br>
first homogenizing all of the liquid constituents by<br>
means of a dissolver and then mixing to incorporate all<br>
of the solids.<br><br><br><br>
SMC prepregs were produced from the formulation on a<br>
laboratory SMC plant from Schmidt and Heinzmann, by<br>
applying the resin composition between two polyamide<br>
carrier foils (belt speed: 5.5 m/min; doctor gap:<br>
1.6 mm; weight per unit area: 4000 g/m2; glass type<br>
used: OC R07 4800 tex from Owens Corning; glass<br>
content: 97 parts by weight, corresponding to 25% by<br>
weight based on the entire formulation).<br>
After a storage time of 5 days at room temperature, the<br>
thickened-consistency SMC prepreg was cut to give 860 g<br>
pieces, the carrier foil was peeled away, and<br>
appearance was evaluated.<br>
Homogeneity test on SMC after pressing<br>
The SMC pieces freed from the carrier foil were pressed<br>
to give test sheets, using a mould design factor of<br>
40%. The temperature used here was from 150 to 155°C,<br>
the press time was 180 s and the ram pressure was<br>
1200 kN. The finished pressed sheets were then visually<br>
assessed for homogeneity and surface quality. To<br>
evaluate surface quality, the sheet to be tested was<br>
held slightly obliquely with respect to the window,<br><br>
together with a comparison sheet. The clarity with<br>
which the specimen surface could reflect objects was<br>
evaluated.<br>
The SMC sheet manufactured in the usage example<br>
exhibits the desired homogeneity, i.e. a glossy surface<br>
without any marble effect. Demixing of the components<br>
of the unsaturated polyester resin mixture during the<br>
compression procedure would produce a dull SMC surface<br>
with a marble effect.<br><br>
