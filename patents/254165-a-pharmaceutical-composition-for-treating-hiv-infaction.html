				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application USSN 60/555,767, filed March 24, 2004.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus -1) infection remains a major medical problem, with an estimated 42 million people infected worldwide at the end of 2002. The number of cases of HIV and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has risen rapidly. In 2002, approximately 5 million new infections were reported and 3.1 million people died from AIDS. Currently available drugs for the treatment of HIV include ten nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors or approved single pill combinations: zidovudine or AZT (or Retrovir®), didanosine or DDI (or Videx®), stavudine or D4T (or Zerit®), lamivudine or 3TC (or Epivir®), zalcitabine or DDC (or Hivid®), abacavir succinate (or Ziagen®), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate salt (or Viread®), emtricitabine (or Emtriva®), Combivir® (contains 3TC and AZT), Trizivir® (contains abacavir, 3TC and AZT); three non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: nevirapine (or Viramune®), delavirdine (or Rescriptor ) and efavirenz (or Sustiva®), eight peptidomimetic protease inhibitors or approved formulations: saquinavir (or Invirase® or Fortovase®), indinavir (or Crixivan®), ritonavir (or Norvir®), nelfinavir (or Viracept®), amprenavir (or Agenerase®), atazanavir<br>
(Reyataz ), fosamprenavir (or Lexiva), Kaletra®(contains lopinavir and ritonavir), and one fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (or T-20 or Fuzeon®).<br>
Each of these drugs can only transiently restrain viral replication if used alone. However, when used in combination, these drugs have a profound effect on viremia and disease progression. In fact, significant reductions in death rates among AIDS patients have been recently documented as a consequence of the widespread application of combination therapy. Despite-these impressive results, 30 to 50% of <br>
patients ultimately fail combination drag therapies. Insufficient drag potency, non-compliance, restricted tissue penetration and drag-specific limitations within certain cell types (e.g. most nucleoside analogs cannot be phosphorylated in resting cells) may account for the incomplete suppression of sensitive viruses. Furthermore, the high replication rate and rapid turnover of HIV-1 combined with the frequent incorporation of mutations, leads to the appearance of drag-resistant variants and treatment failures when sub-optimal drag concentrations are present (Larder and Kemp; Gulick; Kuritzkes; Morris-Jones et al; Schinazi et al; Vacca and Condra; Flexner; Berkhout and Ren et al; (Ref. 6-14)). Thus, there is continuing need for new compounds and methods of treatment for HIV infection.<br>
1 -Benzoyl-4-[2-[4-methoxy-7-(3-methyl- 1H-1,2,4-triazol-1 -yl)- IH-pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridin-3-yl]-l,2-dioxoethyl]-piperazine (Compound 1) is an HIV-1 attachment inhibitor demonstrating potent antiviral activity against a variety of laboratory and clinical strains of HIV-1 (see U.S. patent application US 2003 0207910, published Nov. 6 2003).<br>
(FIGURE REMOVE)<br><br>
Compound 1 acts by selectively preventing attachment of the exterior viral envelope protein gp!20 to its cellular receptor CD4. Binding of gp!20 to CD4 is the first step in viral entry and is distinct from the subsequent interaction with a chemokine receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) or virus-cell fusion event. By inhibiting this interaction, Compound 1 blocks viral entrance into cells.<br><br>

Biological Methods<br>
Compound 1 demonstrated synergistic or additive-synergistic HIV antiviral activity when used in conjunction with a variety of other antiviral agents, as described below.<br>
Virus and cell lines. The T-cell lines, MT-2 and PM-1 were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID, and were contributed by Dr. D. Richman and Dr. R. Gallo, respectively. Both cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and sub-cultured twice a week. The LAI strain of HIV-1 was obtained from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and the Bal strain was from NIH. Both virus stocks were amplified and titered in MT-2 cells (LAI) and PM-1 cells (Bal) using a virus infectivity assay.<br><br>
Chemicals. Compound 1, atazanavir, didanosine, stavudine, efavirenz, enfuvirtide (T-20), T-1249, AMD-3100, Sch-C, Sch-D and UK-427,857 were synthesized using published or known reactions. Amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, nevirapine, lopinavir, lamivudine, ritonavir, tenofovir, saquinavir, delavirdine and abacavir were extracted from commercial formulations of the prescribed drugs and purified using published or common techniques. Tenofovir was tested as tenovir disopoxil fumerate. Zalcitabine was obtained from the National Institutes of Health. Zidovudine was purchased from Sigma and emtricitabine from Moravek Biochemicals. 3-[(4-Fluorobenzyl)methoxycarbamoyl]-2-hydroxyacrylic acid (Compound 2) and 2-(2,2)-dimethyl-5-oxo-[l,3]-dioxolan-4-ylidene)-N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-N-methoxyacetamide (Compound 3) are described in US patent 6,777,440. Purities of the anti-HIV agents were greater than 95% except for AMD-3100 (&gt;90%), Sch-D (80%), and UK-427,857 (&gt;90%).<br>
Drug Susceptibility and Cytotoxicity Assays. For drug susceptibility assays, MT-2 cells were infected with fflV-1 LAI (or PM-1 cells with fflV-1 Bal) at an MOI of 0.005, and seeded into 96-well microtiter plates (0.1 x 10 cells/ml) containing serial dilutions of test compounds. The drug combinations were set up using ratios of the two drugs of 1:1,1:2.5 and 2.5:1 times the ECso value determined for each drug in prior multiple experiments. Each drug ratio consisted of an array of 3-fold serial dilutions, and was performed in quadruplicate. The plates were incubated at 37°C/5% CO2. The MT-2 cells infected with HIV-1 LAI were incubated for 5 days. On day-five post-infection, 20 uJ from each well was harvested and quantitated by a reverse transcriptase (RT) assay, or in samples involving non-nucleoside RT inhibitors, an MTS assay. The PM-1 cells infected with HIV-1 Bal and used for studying the combinations with CCR5 inhibitors were incubated for six days. On day-six post-infection, 20 |ul from each well was harvested, 20- and 50-fold diluted and quantitated by p24 assay. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using uninfected cells, exposed to the same drug combinations, and incubated for six days. Cell viability was determined by an MTS assay. The CCso values were calculated by using the exponential form of the median effect equation as mentioned below for calculation<br><br>
Analysis of Drug Combination Effects. For determination of CI values, drugs were diluted in a fixed ratio and multiple ratios were analyzed. The drug serial<br>
dilutions spanned a range of concentrations near the ECso value of each compound, so that equivalent antiviral activities could be compared. Concentration-response curves were estimated for each individual drug and every combination using the median-effect equation. The equation was fit using a nonlinear regression routine (Proc Nlin) in PC SAS version 8.01 (SAS Institute Inc., SAS Version 8.01, Gary, NC: SAS Institute Inc., 1990).<br>
values for each drug were determined from the single drug experiments,<br>
using the median effect equation, Fa = !/[!+ (ED50/drug concentration)111]. In this equation, Fa stands for "fraction affected," and represents the fraction of the viral load that has been inactivated. For example, Fa of 0.75 indicates that viral replication had been inhibited by 75%, relative to the no-drug controls. EDso is drug concentration that is expected to reduce the amount of virus by 50%, and m is a parameter that reflects the slope of the concentration-response curve.<br>
To assess antiviral effects of different drug combination treatments, combination indices (CIs) were calculated according to Chou and Rideout. The combination index was computed as<br>
CI = [D]i /[Dm]l + [Ph /[Dm]2<br>
In this equation [Dm]l and [Dm]2 are the concentrations of drugs that would individually produce a specific level of effect, while [D]l and [D]2 are the concentrations of drugs in combination that would produce the same level of effect.<br>
Theoretically, additivity is implied if the CI is equal to one, synergy if the CI is less than one, and antagonism if the CI is greater than one. However, extensive experience with combination studies indicates that there are inherent laboratory variables that must be taken into account in interpreting the CIs. At best, we can<br><br>
construct a range that contains the likely values for the CI, given the noise in the data. In this report, these ranges are reported in parentheses next to each point estimate of the CI. For example, when we report a CI of "0.53 (0.46, 0.60)" this means that our best estimate of the CI is 0.53, but due to noise in the data, values from 0.46 to 0.60 are also reasonable values for the CI. This range, 0.46 to 0.60 falls entirely below the value of 1.0, and hence all likely values for the CI are less than 1.0. Therefore, we can infer synergistic behavior for this case. If the range fell entirely above 1.0, we would infer antagonistic behavior. If the range were to include 1.0, we would infer additivity.<br>
In carrying out the combination experiments below, the ECso for Compound 1 and each comparator compound was determined during the course of each study, and used in the subsequent data analysis. The determined values are consistent with our previously published data and are shown in Table 1.<br>

Two-Drug Combinations of Compound 1 with Nudeoside Reverse Transcripta.se Inhibitors. Nucleoside RT inhibitors were combined with Compound 1 at a range of concentrations near the ECso value of each compound, so that equivalent antiviral activities could be compared. All estimates were computed using SAS Proc NLIN, and a two-parameter logistic. Data is presented in Table 2 as the combination indices and the asymptotic confidence intervals for RT inhibitors at different molar ratios (see Materials and Methods). Nucleoside RT inhibitors show synergistic to additive-synergistic antiviral effects in combination with Compound 1. No significant antagonism of anti-HIV activity is observed. No enhanced cytotoxicity was encountered at the highest concentrations tested with any of the drug combinations, as measured by MTS reduction assay.<br><br>

Pharmaceutical Composition and Methods of Use<br>
Compound 1 inhibits HIV attachment, an essential step in HTV replication, and can be useful for the treatment of HIV infection and the consequent pathological conditions such as AIDS or ARC. As shown above, Compound 1 is active in conjunction with a wide variety of other agents and may be particularly beneficial in HAART and other new combination compositions and therapies.<br>
Compound 1 will generally be given as a pharmaceutical composition, and the active ingredient of the composition may be comprised of Compound 1 alone or Compound 1 and at least one other agent used for treating AIDS or HIV infection. The compositions will generally be made with a pharmaceutically accepted carrier or vehicle, and may contain conventional exipients. The compositions are made using common formulation techniques. The invention encompasses all conventional forms. Solid and liquid compositions are preferred. Some solid forms include powders, tablets, capsules, and lozenges. Tablets include chewable, buffered, and extended release. Capsules include enteric coated and extended release capsules. Powders are for both oral use and reconstitution into solution. Powders include lyophilized and flash-melt powders. In a solid composition, Compound 1 and any antiretroviral agent are present in dosage unit ranges. Generally, Compound 1 will be in a unit dosage range of 1-1000 mg/unit. Some examples of dosages are 1 mg, 10 mg, 100 mg, 250<br><br>
mg, 500 mg, and 1000 mg. Generally, other antiretroviral agents will be present in a unit range similar to agents of that class used clinically. Typically, this is 0.25-1000 mg/unit.<br>
Liquids include aqueous solutions, syrups, elixers, emusions, and suspensions. In a liquid composition, Compound 1 and any antiretroviral agent are present in dosage unit ranges. Generally, Compound 1 will be in a unit dosage range of 1-100 mg/mL. Some examples of dosages are 1 mg/mL, 10 mg/mL, 25 mg/mL, 50 mg/mL, and 100 mg/mL. Generally, other antiretroviral agents will be present in a unit range similar to agents of that class used clinically. Typically, this is 1-100 mg/mL.<br>
The invention encompasses all conventional modes of administration; oral and parenteral (injected intramuscular, intravenous, subcutanaeous) methods are preferred. Generally, the dosing regimen will be similar to other antiretroviral agents used clinically. Typically, the daily dose will be 1-100 mg/kg body weight daily for Compound 1. Generally, more compound is required orally and less parenterally. The specific dosing regime, however, will be determined by a physician using sound medical judgement.<br>
The invention also encompasses methods where Compound 1 is given in combination therapy. That is, Compound 1 can be used in conjunction with, but separately from, other agents useful in treating ADDS and HIV infection. Some of these agents include HIV attachment inhibitors, CCR5 inhibitors, CXCR4 inhibitors, HIV cell fusion inhibitors, HIV integrase inhibitors, HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, HIV non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors, budding and maturation inhibitors, immunomodulators, and anti-infectives. In these combination methods, Compound 1 will generally be given in a daily dose of 1-100 mg/kg body weight daily in conjunction with other agents. The other agents generally will be given in the amounts used therapeutically. The specific dosing regime, however, will be determined by a physician using sound medical judgement.<br><br>
Table 7 lists some agents useful in treating AIDS and HIV infection, which are suitable for this invention. The invention, however, is not limited to these agents.<br><br>
