				<td>CONDENSED AZEPINES AS VASOPRESSIN AGONISTS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a class of novel chemical entities which act as agonists of the peptide hormone vasopressin. They reduce urine output from the kidneys and so are useful in the treatment of certain human diseases characterised by polyuria. They are also useful in the control of urinary incontinence and bleeding disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Vasopressin is a peptide hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. It acts on the kidney to increase water retention and so reduce urine output. For this reason, vasopressin is alternatively known as "antidiuretic hormone". It also acts on the vasculature, where it produces a hypertensive effect. The cellular receptors that mediate these two actions have been characterised and shown to be different. The antidiuretic action is mediated by the type-2 vasopressin receptor, commonly called the V2 receptor. Agents that can interact with the V2 receptor and activate it in the same way as vasopressin are called V2 receptor agonists (or simply V2 agonists). Such agents will have an antidiuretic action. If these agents interact selectively with the V2 receptor and not the other vasopressin receptor subtypes, thep they will not have the hypertensive effect of vasopressin. This would be an important safety consideration and make such agents attractive for the treatment of human disease conditions characterised by polyuria (which is herein taken to mean excessive urine production).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In fact,-such an agent is already in use in human therapy. Desmopressin (otherwise [1-desamino, D-Arg6]vasopressin, Minirin™, DDAVP™) is a peptide analogue of vasopressin which is selectively an agonist at the V2 receptor. It is used in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus, which is a condition that results from defective secretion of vasopressin. It is also employed in the control of nocturnal enuresis and may also be of use in the control of nocturia. However, desmopressin is not an ideal agent in all respects. Even the best current syntheses of the agent are lengthy, and desmopressin is not amenable to the most convenient of purification techniques such as crystallisation. Consequently, desmopressin is relatively expensive. It has a very low oral bioavailability, and there is some variability in this parameter.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Overall then, there exists a need for a selective vasopressin Va receptor agonist that is easy to prepare and purify, and that has a high and predictable oral bioavailability. Such properties are most likely to be obtained with a non-peptide compound. These considerations have led other groups to investigate non-peptide vasopressin V2 agonists, and their results are disclosed in, for example, International Patent Applications WO97/22591, WO99/06403, WO99/06409, WOOO/46224, WOOO/46225, WOOO/46227 and WOOO/46228. The compounds disclosed in these documents are, however, less than ideal. In particular, they have poor oral bioavailabiJity, probably due in part to their low aqueous solubility. The present invention provides compounds with improved solubility and bioavaiiability.<br>
Besides its antidiuretic actions, desmopressin is used to increase the concentration in the blood of the coagulation proteins known as Factor Vfll and von Willebrand factor. In the clinical context, this makes desmopressin useful in the treatment of haemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease. Similar applications would be open to the non-peptide agonists of the present invention.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises N-benzylcarbamy! pyrrolidine derivatives defined by general formula 1.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In this formula, A represents a bicyclic or tricyclic azepine group according to one of the general formulae 2-7.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A1, A4, A7 and A10 represent divalent groups selected from methylene (-CH2), oxygen (-O—) and substituted nitrogen (-NR8-). A2, A3, A9, A11, A13, A14 and A15 represent either a nitrogen atom (-N=) or a methine group (-CH=). A5 can represent a covalent bond, in which case A6 represents a sulphur atom (-S-) such that the ring that includes these two groups is a thiophene ring. Alternatively, A6 can represent a group -N=CH-, in which case A6 represents a covalent bond such that the ring that includes these two groups is a pyridine ring. A8 and A12 represent either -NH- or a sulphur atom (-S-). A16 and A17 represent divalent groups. Both may be methylene groups (-CH2) or one is a methylene group and the other is selected from hydroxymethylene (-CH(OH)-), difluoromethylene (-CF2), oxygen (-0-), substituted nitrogen (-NR8-) and sulphur or oxidised sulphur (-S-, -SO-, or -SO2-). V1 and V2 may both be hydrogen, methoxy or fluorine, or one may be selected from bromine, chlorine, fluorine, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, benzyloxy, phenoxy, acyloxy, azido, amino, benzylamino and acylamido (Br, Ci, F, OH, O-lower alkyl, OBn, OPh, O-acyl, NH2l NHBn and NH-acyl) provided that the other is hydrogen, or V1 and V2 together may represent an oxygen atom such that the fragment CV1V2 is a carbonyl group (C=O).

the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, they form an azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine<br>
or perhydroazepine ring.<br>
Ra may be hydrogen or a lower alkyl group.<br>
In the context of the present disclosure, the term "lower alkyl" is intended to include straight chain and branched alkyl groups and cydoalkyl groups of between 1 and 6 carbon atoms. For example, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tart-butyl, neopentyl and cyclohexyl are all within the scope of the term lower alkyl. The term "acyl" denotes lower a(kyl carbonyi groups such as acetyl, pivaioyl, cydopropylcarbonyl and the like. Formyl is also considered to be an acyl group.<br>

For example, compounds containing one or more nitrogen atoms can form addition salts with mineral and organic acids such as hydrochloric add, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic add, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulphonic add, citric acid and benzole acid. Compounds containing acidic groups can form salts with bases. Examples of such salts include the sodium, potassium, calcium, triethylamrnonium and tetraethylammonium salts. Furthermore, compounds that have both acidic and basic groups can form internal salts (zwiterions). Insofar as these salts are pharmaceutically acceptable, they are induded within the scope of the invention.<br>
The compounds according to general formula 1 all have at least one stereogenic centre (a tetrahedrai carbon atom bearing four different substituents) and so can exist as optical isomers such as enantiomers and diastereomers. Such isomers, and mixtures thereof, are all intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be prepared using methods generally known in the art. " The compounds of general formula 1 can be considered to be composed of three linked fragments (A - C).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The three fragments will generally be prepared separately and then combined at a late stage in the synthesis. Some instances of the various groups (R1 - R4, V1, V2, X1, X2 etc.) might be incompatible with this assembly and so will require the use of protecting groups. The use of protecting groups is well known in the art (see for example "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", T.W. Greene, Wiley-lnterscience, 1981). Particular groups that may require protection are amines (protected as amides or carbamates), alcohols (protected as esters or<br>
ethers) and carboxylic acids (protected as esters). For the purposes of this discussion, it will be assumed that such protecting groups as are necessary are in place.<br>
The fragments A, B and C can be combined according to two strategies to give the compounds of formula 1. In the first, fragments A and B are linked to give a fragment corresponding to AB, which is then combined with fragment C. In the second, fragments B and C are linked to give a fragment corresponding to BC, which is then combined with fragment A. The chemistry involved in the condensation of fragment A with B, and that involved in the condensation of fragment B with fragment C, will be the same whichever strategy is followed. We have found that the first strategy is more flexible when working on a small scale and for preparing a selection of compounds.' Nevertheless, it is possible that the second strategy would be advantageous for the preparation of a selected compound on a large scale.<br>
Formation of fragment AB<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Here, {A} and {B} represent part structures of the fragments A and B respectively. The formation of amides by the condensation of carboxylic acids with amines is well known. In general, the acid and the amine are mixed in an aprotic solvent .such as dichloromethane or dimethylformamide in the presence of a condensing agent such as a carbodiimide (for example "water-soluble carbodiimide", which is N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide) or a reactive phosphorus derivative (for example "BOP", which is (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate). The reaction may optionally be catalysed by a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or 4-dimethylaminopyridine. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid may be converted to a more reactive derivative such as the acid chloride. Such a derivative can then be reacted with the amine as described above but without the need for a condensing agent<br>
Formation of fragment BC<br>
Formation of the urea or thiourea bond between fragments B and C can be most easily<br>
achieved by allowing the primary amine corresponding to fragment B to react with a<br>
derivative of carbonic acid such as phogene (wherein LG above is chlorine) or<br>
carbonyldiimidazole (wherein LG is 1-imidazolyl) to form an intermediate carbamic acid<br>
derivative.	When W1 is sulphur rather than oxygen, thiophosgene or<br>
thiocarbonyldiimidazole is used. The reaction is conveniently carried out in an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane or dimethylformamide in the presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine. After allowing sufficient time for the formation of the intermediate, the secondary amine corresponding to fragment C can be added to the reaction mixture. It is not necessary to isolate the intermediate carbamate derivative.<br>
As a variation of this process, it is possible to reverse the order of addition of the amines corresponding to fragments B and C, such that the carbamate derivative is formed from the secondary amine, and the primary amine is added subsequently.<br>
Overall then, the following intermediates are required for the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Fused azepines according to these general formulae can be prepared according to methods reported in the literature. See for example: Aranapakam et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993, 1733; Artico et al., Farmaco. Ed. Sci. 24, 1969, 276; Artico et al., Farmaco. Ed. Sci. 32, 1977, 339; Chakrabarti etal., J. Med. Chem. 23, 1980, 878; Chakrabarti etal., J. Med. Chem. 23, 1980, 884; Chakrabarti etal., J. Med. Chem. 32, 1989, 2573; Chimirri et al., Heterocycles 36,1993, 601; Grunewald etal., J. Med. Chem. 39,1996, 3539; Klunder etal., J. Med.

Lett. 24, 1983, 4711; and International patent application, publication number WO99/06403.<br>
Some of them are items of commerce.<br>
H)For fragment B<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Because the primary amine and the carboxylic acid groups are incompatible, they must be developed separately and protected. Substituted benzoic acids are well known, and the carboxylic acid is conveniently protected as its methyl ester. The primary amine can be elaborated from the corresponding nitrile (by reduction) or the alcohol (by displacement with<br>
a nitrogen nucleophile).   The best method will depend on the nature of the substituents R1-R4.<br>
Hi)       For fragment C<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Pyrrolidine derivatives of this type are prepared according to the methods described in the literature. See for example: Dugave eial., Tet. Lett. 39,1998, 1169; Petrillo et a/., J. Med. Chem. 31,1988, 1148; and Smith era/., J. Med. Chem. 31,1988, 875.<br>
Proline and hydroxyproline derivatives of defined stereochemistry are items of commerce and as such are convenient starting materials.<br>
The present invention further comprises pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one compound according to the foregoing description as an active constituent The composition may also include a second pharmacological agent such as a spasmolytic or a potassium channel blocker, these agents being known in the art to ameliorate bladder dysfunction. Preferably, the composition includes only one active constituent. The composition will include excipients selected from binding agents, bulking agents, dispersants, solvents, stabilising agents and the like, such excipients being generally known in the art.<br>
The excipients used will depend on the intended nature of the formulation, which will, in turn, depend on the intended route of administration. Administration may be oral, transmucosal (such as sublingual, buccai, intranasal, vaginal and rectal), transdermal or by injection (such as subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous). Oral administration is generally preferred. For oral administration, the formulation will be a tablet or capsule. Other formulations include dry powders, solutions, suspensions, suppositories and the like.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention is a method of treating or controlling certain human physiological dysfunctions. This method comprises the administration to the person in need<br>
of such treatment of an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition, which composition contains a compound according to the foregoing description as an active constituent. The compounds act to reduce urine output, and so the method of the invention can be applied to all conditions in which elevated urine output is a contributory factor. The compounds also increase the production of the blood coagulation proteins known as Factor Vill and von Willebrand factor, and • so the treatment of bleeding disorders can be undertaken.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the condition treated is diabetes insipidus. This is a condition caused by an inability of the body to produce and secrete physiologically active vasopressin, with the result that water re-uptake is greatly reduced and large volumes of urine are produced.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the condition treated is nocturnal enuresis. .This is defined as bladder emptying while the individual is sleeping. It is a condition that mainly affects children and a number of factors may be involved in its etiology.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the condition treated is nocturia. This is defined as production of sufficient urine during the night to require the individual to wake and empty his (or her) bladder. Again, this condition may be the result of a number of factors.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the condition treated is incontinence. This condition is characterised, in part, by reduced bladder capacity and control such that involuntary urination occurs unless the bladder is emptied frequently. Incontinence has been divided into two conditions, stress incontinence and urge incontinence. A number of etiological factors are thought to be involved. Treatment according to the invention is particularly useful for delaying the need for bladder emptying ("voiding postponement") in order to allow the incontinent subject a dry period of a few hours (such as up to four hours). Such voiding postponement may also be useful for the non-incontinent population, for example for people obliged to remain in meetings for extended periods.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the condition treated is haemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease. These are conditions in which Factor VIII or von Willebrand factor production is reduced and the individual suffers from prolonged bleeding.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the composition is administered prior to surgery (including dental surgery) to increase the coagulability of the blood and so reduce peri-operative blood loss.<br>
The administration of the compositions of the present invention will generally be under the control of a physician. The physician will determine the amount of composition to be administered and the dosing schedule, taking into account the patient's physical condition and the therapeutic goals. For an adult diabetes insipidus patient, a typical dose might be between 50mg and 1g of the active compound per day, taken as a single tablet or as up to four tablets throughout the day. For routes of administration other than the oral route, the amount of compound will be reduced, since non-oral routes tend to be more efficient in terms of delivering therapeutic agents into the systemic circulation. For the treatment of haemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease the amount of compound may need to be higher than for the treatment of diabetes insipidus.<br>
The foregoing general description will now be further illustrated with a number of non-limiting examples.<br>

Example 117.<br>
In Vitro Biological Characterisation<br>
The compounds of the invention are selective agonists at the V2 receptor. In .standard radio-ligand displacement assays, the compounds all give KI values below 10nM for the V2 receptor.<br>
Example 118.<br>
In Vivo Biological Characterisation<br>
The Brattleboro rat is a recognised model for vasopressin deficiency (for a review see FD Grant, "Genetic models of vasopressin deficiency", EXD. Phvsiol. 85, 203S-209S, 2000). The animals do not secrete vasopressin and consequently produce large volumes of dilute urine. Compounds of the invention were administered to Brattleboro rats (0.1-10mg/kg p.o. in methylcellulose. Urine was collected hourly and volumes were compared with control animals. Animals had free access to food and water throughout the experiment. Representative results are given in the Table. Results for Desmopressin are given for comparison. <br>

Example 119.<br>
Pharmaceutical composition for tablet<br>
Tablets containing 100mg of the compound of Example 1 as the active agent are prepared from the following:<br>
Compound of Example 1	200.0g<br>
Com starch	71. 0g<br>
Hydroxypropylcellulose	18.0g<br>
Carboxymethylcellulose calcium	13.0g<br>
Magnesium stearate	3.0g<br>
Lactose	195.0g<br>
Total	500.0g<br>
The materials are blended and then pressed to give 2000 tablets of 250mg, each containing 100mg of the compound of Example 5.<br>
The foregoing Examples demonstrate that compounds within the scope of the invention are readily prepared using standard chemical techniques, and that these compounds have the biological properties that would be expected of V2 receptor agonists. In particular, the compounds are potent antidiuretics in an animal model of vasopressin deficiency. Thus it is clear that they may be useful in the treatment of human diseases that are currently treatable with Desmopressin, such as central diabetes insipidus, nocturnal enuresis and nocturia. It has further been suggested that antidiuretics such as Desmopressin may be useful in certain types of urinary incontinence. These arguments would also extend to the compounds of the present invention.<br>
Desmopressin is also used in the treatment of certain coagulation disorders. There is good evidence to suggest that this action is also mediated through the V2 receptor (set ;r example JE Kaufmann et a/., "Vasopressin-induced von Willebrand factor secretion from endothelial cells involves V2 receptors and cAMP", J. Clin. Invest. 106, 107-116, 2000; A Bernat et al, "V2 receptor antagonism of DDAVP-induced release of hemostasis factors in conscious dogs", J. Pharmacol. EXP. Ther. 282, 597-602, 1997), and hence it would be expected that the compounds of the present invention should be useful pro-coagulants.<br>
