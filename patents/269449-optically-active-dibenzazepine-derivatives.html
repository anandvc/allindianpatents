OPTICALLY ACTIVE DIBENZAZEPINE DERIVATIVES<br><br>
Technical Field<br><br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an optically active dibenzazepine derivative. More specifically, the present invention relates to a novel optically active quaternary ammonium salt having a high utility value as an asymmetric phase-transfer catalyst in the fields related to the production of optically active drug substances, intermediates, starting materials, etc., mainly in the area of medical drugs and agricultural chemicals.<br><br>
Background Art<br><br>
[0002]<br>
Various optically active quaternary ammonium salts having a high utility value as an asymmetric phase-transfer catalyst have been proposed. In particular, compounds having an optically active 6,7-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[c,e]azeplne skeleton is useful. As examples of such compounds, there are the following compounds : a compound represented by the following formula (L-la) described in Patent Document 1, (wherein * represents optical activity, i.e., that one axially asymmetric isomer is present in excess of the other axially asymmetric isomer with respect to a bond axis that constitutes the biphenyl structure of the compound); a compound represented by the following formula (L-lb) described in Patent Document 2,<br><br><br><br>
(wherein * has the same meaning as above); a compound represented by the following formula (L-lc) described in Non-Patent Document 1,<br><br><br><br>
(wherein * has the same meaning as above); a compound represented by the following formula (L-ld), (wherein * has the same meaning as above), etc. All of these catalysts are highly useful for monoalkylation of glycine derivatives. Specifically, for example, when a compound represented by formula (L-lb) was used as a catalyst in an asymmetric monoalkylation reaction represented by the following formula (M-l),<br><br>
(wherein ** represents optical activity, i.e., that, of the two types of mirror-image isomers present on the carbon atoms shown by **, one isomer is present in excess of the other isomer), the reaction was completed with a minute amount of catalyst (S/C = 10,000 (S: substrate mol, C: catalyst mol) even if inexpensive potassium hydroxide was used as a base, and the optical purity of the product was 96%ee. <br><br>
[0003]<br>
In  contrast,  when  an  asymmetric  dialkylation reaction represented by the following formula (M-2),<br><br><br>
(wherein ** has the same meaning as above), which is a similar reaction as the above reaction, was performed using the same catalyst and very expensive cesium hydroxide as a base, a large amount of catalyst (S/C = 100) was required, although a good optical yield was obtained (Patent Document 2). In Patent Document 3, the reaction of the above formula M-2 was performed using as a catalyst a compound having the azepine skeletone represented by the following formula (L-2), <br><br>
(wherein * has the same meaning as above), to obtain a similar result.<br><br>
More specifically, all of the conventional optically active 6,7-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[c,e]azepine skeleton compounds had a problem, to be used as a catalyst for an asymmetric dialkylation reaction.<br><br>

[0085]<br><br>
Alanine Schif f base (0.25 mmol) shown in the reaction formula, piperonyl bromide (0.3 mmol) and phase-transfer catalyst PTC (0.02 mol%) were dissolved in a toluene solvent (2mL). The mixed solution was stirred vigorously, and a saturated aqueous KOH solution (0.5 mL) was added dropwise thereto. Under an argon atmosphere, the mixture was stirred vigorously at 25°C (constant-temperature bath) until the reaction was completed. After the reaction was completed, 0.25 mmol methyl benzoate was added as the internal standard material, and the reaction mixture was served as it is for 1HNMR analysis to determine the yield (quantitative).<br><br>
The reaction mixture was extracted, concentrated, and dried, and then purified by column chromatography. Then, the substance of interest was obtained as an amine derivative wherein the imine moiety was deprotected. <br>
This amine derivative was dissolved in a methylene chloride solution, and benzoyl chloride (0.25 mmol) was added dropwise thereto. After 1 hour, the reaction was quenched by an ammonia water, followed by extraction and column purification (hexane  ethyl acetate = 7:1) to obtain a benzoylated derivative. The optical purity was determined by an HPLC analysis  of  the benzoylated derivative (Chiral Cell AD-H, hexane : isopropanol : ethanol = 90:5:5) (95%ee).<br><br>
Note) Phase-transfer catalyst PTC: the optically active  6,7-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[c,e]azepine  derivative synthesized in Example 1-1 [0086] Example 2-2 The same alanine Schiff base (0.25 mmol) as used in Example 2-1, benzyl bromide (0.3 mmol) and the same phase-transfer catalyst PTC as used in Example 2-1 (0.02 mol%) were dissolved in a toluene solvent (2 mL). The mixed solution was stirred vigorously, and a saturated aqueous KOH solution (0.5 mL) was added dropwise thereto. Under an argon atmosphere,  the mixture was stirred vigorously at 25°C (constant-temperature bath) until the reaction was completed. After the reaction was completed, 1N hydrochloric acid was added to the organic phase and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. After the reaction was completed, the aqueous phase was collected and sodium carbonate was added to alkalify the solution, which was then extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain a deprotected amine derivative. This amine derivative was dissolved in a methylene chloride solution, and benzoyl chloride (0.25 mmol) was added dropwise thereto. After 1 hour, the reaction was quenched by an ammonia water, followed by extraction and column purification (hexane : ethyl acetate = 7:1) to obtain a benzoylated derivative. The optical purity was determined by an HPLC analysis of the benzoylated  derivative (Chiral Cell AD-H, hexane : isopropanol : ethanol = 90:5:5) (97%ee).<br><br>
