NOVEL COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS AS PROTEIN KINASE<br>
INHIBITORS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/460,838, filed April 4, 2003, which application is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The invention provides a novel class of compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and methods of using such compounds to treat or prevent diseases or disorders associated with abnormal or deregulated tyrosine kinase activity, particularly diseases associated with the activity of PDGF-R, c-Kit and Bcr-abl.<br>
Background<br>
[0003] The protein kinases represent a large family of proteins, which play a central role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes and maintaining control over cellular function. These kinases include receptor tyrosine kinases, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinase (PDGF-R), the receptor kinase for stem cell factor, c-Kit, and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the fusion kinase Bcr-abl.<br>
[0004] Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an extensively studied human cancer that is caused by a reciprocal translocation that fuses the Abl proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 with a gene on chromosome 22 called Bcr. The resulting fusion protein Bcr-abl is capable of transforming B-cells by increasing mitogenic activity, reducing sensitivity to apoptosis and altering the adhesion and homing of CML progenitor cells. STI-571 (Gleevec) is an inhibitor of the oncogenic Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase and is used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, some patients in the blast crisis stage of CML are resistant to STI-571 due to mutations in the Bcr-abl kinase,<br>
[0005] The novel compounds of this invention inhibit one or more kinases; in particular wild type and one or more of the mutant forms of Bcr-abl and are, therefore, useful in the treatment of kinase-associated diseases, particularly Bcr-abl kinase associated diseases.<br><br>

[0037] The fusion protein Bcr-Abl is a result of a reciprocal translocation that fuses the Abl proto-oncogene with the Bcr gene. Bcr-abl is then capable of transforming B-cells through the increase of mitogenic activity. This increase results in a reduction of<br><br>
sensitivity to apoptosis, as well as altering the adhesion and homing of C1-4L progenitor cells. The present invention provides compounds, compositions and methods for the treatment of kinase related disease, particularly PDGF-R, c-Kit and Bcr-abl kinase related diseases. For example, leukemia and other proliferation disorders related to Bcr-abl, can be treated through the inhibition of wild-type and mutant forms of Bcr-abl.<br>

Additional Processes for Preparing Compounds of the Invention<br>
[0059] A compound of the invention can be prepared as a phaimaceutically acceptable acid addition salt by reacting the free base form of the compound with a phaimaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid. Alternatively, a pharmaceutical^ acceptable base addition salt of a compound of the invention can be prepared by reacting the free acid form of the compound with a pharmaceutical^ acceptable inorganic or organic base. Alternatively, the salt forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared using salts of the starting materials or intermediates.<br>
[0060] The free acid or free base forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared from the corresponding base addition salt or acid addition salt from, respectively. For example a compound of the invention in an acid addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free base by treating with a suitable base (e.g., ammonium hydroxide solution, sodium hydroxide, and the like). A compound of the invention in a base addition<br><br>
salt form can be converted to the corresponding free acid by treating with a suitable acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, etc.)<br>
[0061] Compounds of the invention in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-oxides of compounds of the invention by treating with a reducing agent (e.g., sulfur, sulfiir dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, tribromide, or the like) in a suitable inert organic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like) at 0 to 80°C.<br>
[0062] Prodrug derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., for further details see Saulnier et al., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985). For example, appropriate prodrugs can be prepared by reacting a non-derivatized compound of the invention with a suitable carbamylating agent (e.g., 1,1-acyloxyalkylcarbanochloridate, para-nitrophenyl carbonate, or the like).<br>
[0063] Protected derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be made by means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal can be found in T. W. Greene, "Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry", 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1999.<br>
[0064] Compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared, or formed during the process of the invention, as solvates (e.g., hydrates).   Hydrates of compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared by recrystallization from an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents such as dioxin, tetrahydrofuran or methanol.<br>
[0065] Compounds of the invention can be prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers can be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds of the invention, dissociable complexes are preferred (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and can be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities.   The diastereomers can be separated by chromatography, or preferably, by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in<br><br>
racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions", John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981.<br>
[0066] In summary, the compounds of Formula I can be made by a process, which involves:<br>
(a)	reacting a compound of Formula 2 with a compound of Formula 3,4, 5 or<br>
6: <br>
in which X1, X2, Rl, R2, R3 and R5 are as defined for Formula I above and Q represents a fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo; or<br>
(b)	optionally converting a compound of the invention into a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt;<br>
(c)	optionally converting a salt form of a compound of the invention to a non-<br>
salt form;<br>
(d)	optionally converting an unoxidized form of a compound of the invention<br>
into a pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide;<br>
(e)	optionally converting an N-oxide form of a compound of the invention to<br>
its unoxidized form;<br>
(f)	optionally resolving an individual isomer of a compound of the invention<br>
from a mixture of isomers;<br>
(g)	optionally converting a non-derivatized compound of the invention into a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug derivative; and<br>
(h) optionally converting a prodrug derivative of a compound of the invention to its non-derivatized form.<br>
[0067] Insofar as the production of the starting materials is not particularly described, the compounds are known or can be prepared analogously to methods known in the art or as disclosed in the Examples hereinafter.<br><br>
[0068] One of skill in the art will appreciate that the above transformations are only representative of methods for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, and that other well known methods can similarly be used.<br>

Injectable compositions are preferably aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions, and suppositories are preferably prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions. The compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances. Said compositions are prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and contain about 0.1 to 75%, preferably about 1 to 50%, of the active ingredient.<br><br>
[0073] Tablets may be either film coated or enteric coated according to methods known in the art.<br>
[0074] Suitable formulations for transdermal application include an effective amount of a compound of the present invention with carrier. Preferred carriers include absorbable pharmacologically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin of the host. For example, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin. Matrix transdermal formulations may also be used.<br>
[0075] Suitable formulations for topical application, e.g., to the skin and eyes, are preferably aqueous solutions, ointments, creams or gels well-known in the art. Such may contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives.<br>
[0076] The pharmaceutical formulations contain an effective Bcr-abl inhibiting amount of a compound of the present invention as defined above, either alone or in combination with another therapeutic agent.<br>
[0077] In conjunction with another active ingredient, a compound of the present invention may be administered either simultaneously, before or after the other active ingredient, either separately by the same or different route of administration or together in the same pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
[0078] The dosage of active compound administered is dependent on the species of warm-blooded animal (mammal), the body weight, age and individual condition, and on the form of administration. A unit dosage for oral administration to a mammal of about 50 to 70 kg may contain between about 5 and 500 mg of the active ingredient.<br>
V.       Methods<br>
[0079] The compounds of Formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, for example, as indicated by the in vitro tests described within "Assays", infra, and are therefore indicated for therapy of diseases and disorders associated with Bcr-abl activity. For Bcr-abl, compounds of Formula I preferably show an IC5o in the range of 1 x 10"10 to 1 x 10"5 M, preferably less than for wild-type Bcr-abl and at least two other Bcr-abl mutants (mutants selected from G250E, E255V, T315I, F317L and M351T). For example, compound 91 (Table I) has an<br><br>
IC50 of 0.20,4.78, 0.25, 5.28, 4.45, and 0.97 for wild-type, G250E, E255V, T315I, F317L and M351T Bcr-abl, respectively.<br>
[0080] The invention also provides a method for preventing or treating diseases or conditions comprising abnormal cell growth in a mammal, including a human, comprising administering to the mammal a compound of Formula I in an amount effective to inhibit PDGF-R, c-Kit and/or Bcr-abl activity.<br>
[0081] PDGF (Platelet-derived Growth Factor) is a very commonly occurring growth factor, which plays an important role both in normal growth and also in pathological cell proliferation, such as is seen in carcinogenesis and in diseases of the smooth-muscle cells of blood vessels, for example in atherosclerosis and thrombosis.<br>
[0082] Compounds of Formula I can inhibit PDGF-R and are, therefore, also suitable for the treatment of tumor diseases, such as gliomas, sarcomas, prostate tumors, and tumors of the colon, breast, and ovary.<br>
[0083] The compounds of the present invention also inhibit cellular processes involving stem-cell factor (SCF, also known as the c-kit ligand or steel factor), such as SCF receptor (kit) autophosphorylation and the SCF-stimulated activation of MAPK kinase (mitogen-activated protein kinase).<br>
[0084] The compounds of the present invention, thus inhibit also the autophosphorylation of SCF receptor (and c-kit, a proto-oncogen). M07e cells are a human promegakaryocytic leukemia cell line, which depends on SCF for proliferation. A compound of Formula I, inhibits the autophosphorylation of SCF-R in the micromolar range.<br>
[0085] On the basis of the described properties, the compounds of the present invention, can be used not only as a tumor-inhibiting substance, for example in small cell lung cancer, but also as an agent to treat non-malignant proliferative disorders, such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, psoriasis, scleroderma, and fibrosis, as well as for the protection of stem cells, for example to combat the hemotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-fluoruracil, and in asthma. It can especially be used for the treatment of diseases, which respond to an inhibition of the PDGF-R kinase.<br>
[0086] In addition, the compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with other anti-tumor agents.<br>
[0087] Also abl kinase, especially v-abl kinase, is inhibited by compounds of the present invention. By analogy, the compounds of the present invention also inhibit Bcr-abl kinase and are thus suitable for the treatment of Bcr-abl-positive cancer and tumor diseases, such as leukemias (especially chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic<br><br>
leukemia, where especially apoptotic mechanisms of action are found), and also shows effects on the subgroup of leukemic stem cells as well as potential for the purification of these cells in vitro after removal of said cells (for example, bone marrow removal) and reimplantation of the cells once they have been cleared of cancer cells (for example, reimplantation of purified bone marrow cells).<br>
[0088] In addition, the compounds of the present invention show useful effects in the treatment of disorders arising as a result of transplantation, for example, allogenic transplantation, especially tissue rejection, such as especially obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), i.e. a chronic rejection of allogenic lung transplants. In contrast to patients without OB, those with OB often show an elevated PDGF concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Synergistic effects with other immunomodulatory or antiinflammatory substances are possible, for example when used in combination with cyclosporin, rapamycin, or ascomycin, or immunosuppressant analogues thereof, for example cyclosporin A (CsA), cyclosporin G, FK-506, rapamycin, or comparable compounds, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, brequinar, leflunomide, mizoribine, mycophenolic acid, mycophenolate mofetil, 15-deoxyspergualin, immunosuppressant antibodies, especially monoclonal antibodies for leukocyte receptors, for example MHC, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD7, CD25, CD28, B7, CD45, CD58 or their ligands, or other immunomodulatory compounds, such as CTLA41g.<br>
[0089] The compounds of the present invention are also effective in diseases associated with vascular smooth-muscle cell migration and proliferation (where PDGF and PDGF-R often also play a role), such as restenosis and atherosclerosis. These effects and the consequences thereof for the proliferation or migration of vascular smooth-muscle cells in vitro and in vivo can be demonstrated by administration of the compounds of the present invention, and also by investigating its effect on the thickening of the vascular intima following mechanical injury in vivo.<br>
[0090] Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for inhibiting Bcr-abl activity, the method comprising contacting Bcr-abl with a compound that binds to a myristoyl binding pocket of Bcr-abl. In a preferred embodiment, the compound is a compound of Formula L<br><br>

Effect on cell cycle distribution<br>
[0132] 32D and 32D-p210 cells are plated into 6 well TC plates at 2.5xl06 cells per well in 5 ml of medium and test compound at 1 or 10µm is added (STI571 is included as a control). The cells are then incubated for 24 or 48 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. 2 ml of cell suspension is washed with PBS, fixed in 70% EtOH for 1 hour and treated with PBS/EDTA/RNase A for 30 minutes. Propidium iodide (Cf= 10µg/ml) is added and the fluorescence intensity is quantified by flow cytometry on the FACScalibur™ system (BD Biosciences). Test compounds of the present invention demonstrate an apoptotic effect on the 32D-p210 cells but do not induce apoptosis in the 32D parental cells. Effect on Cellular Bcr-abl Autophosphorvlation<br>
[0133] Bcr-abl autophosphorylation is quantified with capture Elisa using a c-abl specific capture antibody and an antiphosphotyrosine antibody. 32D-p210 cells are plated in 96 well TC plates at 2xl05 cells per well in 50 µl of medium. 50 µl of two fold serial dilutions of test compounds (C1-4ax is 10 µm) are added to each well (STI571 is included as a positive control). The cells are incubated for 90 minutes at 37°C, 5% C02. The cells are then treated for 1 hour on ice with 150µlof lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and 1% NP-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. 50µl of cell lysate is added to 96 well optiplates previously coated with anti-abl specific antibody and blocked. The plates are incubated for 4 hours at 4°C. After washing with TBS-Tween 20 buffer, 50 µl of alkaline-phosphatase conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody is added and the plate is further incubated overnight at 4°C After washing with TBS-Tween 20 buffer, 90 µLof a luminescent substrate are added and the luminescence is quantified using the Acquest™ system (Molecular Devices). Test compounds of the invention that inhibit the proliferation of the Bcr-abl expressing cells, inhibit the cellular Bcr-abl autophosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner.<br><br>
Effect on proliferation of cells expressing mutant forms of Bcr-abl<br>
[0134] Compounds of the invention are tested for their antiproliferative effect on Ba/F3 cells expressing either wild type or the mutant forms of Bcr-abl (G250E, E255V, T315I, F317L, M351T) that confers resistance or diminished sensitivity to STI571. The antiproliferative effect of these compounds on the mutant-Bcr-abl expressing cells and on the non transformed cells were tested at 10, 3.3,1.1 and 0.37 µm as described above (in media lacking IL3). The IC50 values of the compounds lacking toxicity on the untransformed cells were determined from the dose response curves obtained as describe above.<br>
