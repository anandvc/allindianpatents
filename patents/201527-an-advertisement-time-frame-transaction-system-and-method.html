				<td>The present invention relates to an advertisement time-frame transaction system and method in broadcasts through media for distributing information such as satellite communication. In particular, the present invention relates to a method and system of transacting advertisement time-frames in broadcasts through such media on an open market basis.<br>
Heretofore, advertisement time-frames in broadcasts through media for distributing information such as a television, a satellite communication, particularly in sponsored free-broadcasts, have been transacted between a corporation as an advertiser or sponsor and the media offering advertisement timeframes through the intermediary of an advertising agency (or advertising company).<br>
Late years, in line with the development of communication networks, such as satellite communication and Internet, and the advance of computer technologies, on-line media via Internet or the like dramatically come into wide use, in addition to media such as televisions and satellite broadcasts using conventional communication systems.<br>
Further, as the advance of digital technologies allows advertisements to be separated from a program and handled independently, the concept of the advertisement time-frame has been changed from a program advertisement timeframe attached integrally to the program with disregard to the number of viewers, to a viewer-specified advertisement time-frame as a separated unit viewed by an individual viewer.<br><br>
Viewer-specified advertisement time-frames which are accumulated for each of targets categorized by a sponsor according to a specific index is referred to as "target advertisement time-frame" herein.<br>
In the rapid popularization of the on-line media, a new technology are also developing to allow a viewing state such as "when, where and by whom a broadcast through the on-line media is viewed" to be readily identified/determined.<br>
As the viewing state can be more readily acquired, an advertisement market has stronger need of a target advertising performed with focusing on a specific group of viewers or a target, and thereby some associated method or system for coping with the demand has been developed.<br>
However, when sponsors drive forward the target advertising using the above conventional method or system, specific target advertisement time-frames are disproportionately demanded by the majority of sponsors, while other target advertisement time-frames can receive orders only from limited or few sponsors. This has caused an undesirable situation where few target advertisement time-frames have demand overreaching supply, but most target advertisement time-frames has supply exceeding demand.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the above problems of the conventional technologies, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and system capable of allowing a plurality of sponsors to changeably assign an advertisement-viewing reward for each of target advertisement timeframes under an open and fair price competition to provide an adequate price and allocation of the target advertisement time-frames.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an advertisement time-frame transaction system comprising: assigning means for selecting a viewer according to information about viewers and allowing an advertiser of an advertisement to assign an advertisement-viewing reward to said advertisement for said selected viewer; designating means for allowing said selected viewer to designate whether he/she will view said advertisement having said assigned advertisement-viewing reward; and changing means for allowing said advertiser to change the advertisement-viewing reward of said advertisement in real time, depending on the information about the designation to be provided from said designating means when said viewer has designated whether he/she views said advertisement.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides an advertisement timeframe transaction method comprising the steps of: selecting a viewer according to information about viewers; allowing an advertiser of an advertisement to assign an advertisement-viewing reward to said advertisement for said selected viewer; allowing said selected viewer to designate whether he/she will view said advertisement having said assigned advertisement-viewing reward; when said viewer has designated whether he/she views said advertisement, allowing said advertiser to change the advertisement-viewing reward of said advertisement in real time, depending on the information about said designation.<br>
In the advertisement time-frame transaction system, the assigning means is operable to select a viewer according to information of viewers and allow an advertiser of an advertisement to assign an advertisement-viewing reward to the advertisement for the selected viewer. The designating means is operable to allow the selected viewer to designate whether he/she will view the advertisement having the assigned advertisement-viewing reward. Further, the changing means is<br><br>
operable to allow the advertiser to change the advertisement-viewing reward of the advertisement in real time, depending on the information about the designation to be provided from the designating means when the viewer has designated whether he/she views the advertisement.<br>

a customer database 25 for storing customer information such as the attribute, preference, or the like of the viewer  a .<br>
an individual-customer-based advertisement viewing record database 26 for storing an advertisement viewing record (or information about the<br><br>
[D of the advertisement which has been viewed up to the upper limit lumber of times) of the viewer  α , and<br>
a terminal 28 having a display unit 27 for displaying a guide screen (screen for making an application for viewing) of contents X, an advertisement-select-screen for allowing a viewer to select one or more desired advertisements, and/or the advertisement-integrated-contents.<br>
With reference to the flowcharts of Figs. 2 to 5, the operation of the system of Fig. 1 will be described in detail below.<br>
A sponsor or advertising agent enters the advertisement attribution information of an advertisement A and the corresponding advertisement-viewing reward P (A, n) for each of advertisement-viewing conditions n imposed by the advertiser, from the advertisement-viewing condition entering/changing section 10, and the advertisement-viewing condition entering/changing section 10 provides such information to the ad-market update instructing section 12 (Step Si).<br>
When the ad-market update instructing section 12 is determined that the advertisement attribution information and the corresponding individual-advertisement-viewing condition n - based advertisement-viewing reward P (A, n) of the advertisement A received from the advertising condition entering/changing section 10 are new information, the ad-market update instructing section 12 registers them to the ad-market database 11. When the ad-market update instructing section 12 is determined that the advertisement attribution information and the corresponding individual-advertisement-viewing condition n - based advertisement-viewing reward P (A, n) of the advertisement A received from the advertising condition entering/changing section 10 are modified information, the ad-market update instructing section 12 overwritingly registers them to the ad-market database 11 to update corresponding registered information (Step S2).<br><br>
The guide screen (screen for making an application for viewing) of the contents X as shown in Fig. 6 or 7 is called from the contents server 24 to the terminal 28 of the viewerαwho has been registered asαcustomer, and is displayed on the display unit 27 of the terminal 28 (Step S3). Then, when the viewerαdesires to view the advertisement-integrated contents X, the viewerαinstructs to call the advertisement select screen (Step 84).α In response to the instruction of the above calling, the terminal providesαregistered customer ID number of the viewerαto the customer database 25 (Step S5), and provides information aboutαscheduled time for viewing the contents X andαcontents ID of the contents X to the contents-viewing-state acquiring section 13 (Step S6). Further, information about date/weather is provided from an outside calendar/timekeeper and an outside weather information providing apparatus (not shown) to the contents-viewing-state acquiring section 13 (Step S7).<br>
Subsequently to Step S5, the customer database provides customer information such as the attribution, preference or the like of the viewerαto the advertisement pick-up condition producing section 14 and the recommended-advertisement priority determining section 17 (Step S8).<br>
Subsequently to Steps S6 and S7, the contents-viewing-state acquiring section 13 provides viewing state information to the advertisement pick-up condition producing section 14 (Step S9).<br>
Further, the individual-customer-based advertisement viewing record database 26 provides an advertisement viewing record (or information about the ID of the advertisement which has been viewed up to the upper limit number of times) of the viewerαreceived from after-mentioned Step S 23 to the advertisement pick-up condition producing<br><br>
section   14  and the recommended-advertisement priority  determining section 17 (Step S10).<br>
The advertisement pick-up condition producing section 14 produces αpick-up condition of one or more advertisements matching with the viewer α, according to the customer information, the viewing state information and the advertisement viewing record, and provides the produced pick-up condition to the matching advertisement picking-up section 15 (Step S11).<br>
In Step S2 and Step Sll, the matching advertisement picking-up section 15 picks up the information about the advertisements matching with the viewer αand the information about the corresponding attributions and rewards according to the advertisement pick-up condition from the ad-market database 11 (Step S 12).<br>
Subsequently to Step Sl2, the information about the advertisements matching with the viewer αand the information about the corresponding attributions and rewards are provided from the matching advertisement picking-up section 15 to the advertisement-select-screen producing section 18 (Step S13).<br>
The advertising agent or other administrator enters advertisement recommendation information (designation of one or more advertisements to be recommended, recommendation text, special incentive, set of recommended advertisements or the like), from the advertisement recommendation entering section 16, and the advertisement recommendation entering section 16 provides the entered advertisement recommendation information to the recommended-advertisement priority determining section 17 (Step Sl4).<br>
The recommended-advertisement priority determining section 17 produces information about αpriority of one or more advertisement to be recommended, according to advertisement recommendation information<br><br>
from the advertising agent or other administrator, the customer information as described in Step S8 and the individual-customer-based-advertisement-viewing-record information as descried in Step S10, and provides the produced recommended-advertisement priority information to the advertisement-select-screen producing section 18 (Step S15).<br>
The advertisement-select-screen producing section 18 produces the advertisement select screen according to the information about the advertisements matching with the viewer a, the information about the corresponding attributions and rewards, and the recommended-advertisement priority information, and provided the produced advertisement select screen to the display unit 27 of the terminal 28 of the viewer αso as to display the advertisement select screen on the display unit 27 (Step S16).<br>
Then, the viewer αchecks the advertisements and the corresponding reward in the advertisement select screen as shown in Fig. 6 or 7 displayed on the display unit 27 to designate one or more of desired advertisements and determine how to insert each of the advertisements in contents to be viewed, and provides the determined information from the terminal 28 of the viewer αto the advertisement-integrated-contents-viewing-style determining section 19 (Step S17).<br>
The advertisement-integrated-contents-viewing-style determining section 19 produces information about αposition where the advertisement is to be inserted, according to the determined information, and provides the produced advertisement-insert-position information to the contents server 24 through the advertisement-insert-position instructing section 20, and then the contents server 24 prepares αprocessing of inserting the advertisement data according to the received advertisement-insert-position information (Step S18).<br>
The advertisement-integrated-contents-viewing-style determining<br><br>
section 19 also produces information about an instruction of inserting the advertisements according to the determined information, and provides the produced advertisement-insert-instruction information to the advertisement server 23 through the advertisement-data transmission instructing section 21 (Step S19).<br>
According to the received advertisement-insert-instruction information, the advertisement server 23 provides αdata of the designated advertisement for the corresponding advertisement insert position, to the contents server 24 (Step S20),<br>
Subsequently to Steps S18 and S20, the contents server 24 produces αcombination data of the contents data and the advertisement data according to the advertisement-insert-position information and the advertisement data, and provides the combination data to the terminal 28 of the viewer αas an advertisement-integrated-contents data (Step S21). Then, the viewer αviews the advertisement-integrated contents X (Step S22). In this stage, it goes on the assumption that the advertisement αhas been viewed by the viewer a. However, it may be confirmed by means of αdevice capable of confirming whether the viewer αhas viewed the advertisement A.<br>
Then, the terminal 28 provides information about the IDs of the advertisement αand other advertisement which have been viewed to the individual-customer-based advertisement viewing record database 26 together with the viewing state data to update the corresponding information in individual-customer-based advertisement viewing record database 26, and then the operation proceeds to the following Step S24 and the aforementioned Step S10 (Step S23).<br>
A viewing record data for each of the advertisements is calculated with reference to the individual-customer-based advertisement viewing record   database   26,   and  the   calculated  data   are  provided  to  the<br><br>
advertisement-viewing-state searching section  22   and the  ad-market update instructing section 12 (Step S 24).<br>
In response to the received viewing record data for each of the advertisements, if any one of the advertisements gets up to an upper limit number of viewings with respect to αspecific advertisement-viewing condition, its registration with respect to the advertisement-viewing condition is deleted from the ad-market database 11 by the ad-market update instructing section 12. Further, if any one of the advertisements is required to change its advertisement-viewing condition, the ad-market update instructing section 12 provides an instruction of changing the advertisement-viewing condition to the ad-market database 11, and the operation proceeds to Step S12 (Step S25)<br>
Subsequently to Step 24, the sponsor (or advertising agent) of the advertisement αsearches the viewing record of the advertisement αby the advertisement-viewing-state searching section 22, and reviews whether the individual-advertisement-viewing condition-based advertisement-viewing reward P (A, n) should be modified. If modified, the sponsor determines αnew advertisement-viewing reward P (A, n), and goes to Step SI (Step S26). If not, the operation is completed (Step S27).<br>
One example of the advertisement-viewing condition is shown in Fig. 8.<br>
The features of the above system can be categorized into the following three points.<br>
1.	Free Selection of Advertisements by Viewer (see Steps S17 to S21)<br>
Any viewers can select αviewing style, such as "kind/category or amount of the advertisements to be viewed, or refusal of viewing of any advertisement, on their own will. The fee of αpay program to be viewed by the viewers will be varied depending on the selected viewing style.<br>
2.	Free   and  Real  Time  Setting  of Advertisement-viewing  reward  by<br><br>
Sponsor (See Steps S1, S2 and S26)<br>
Sponsor can freely assign the advertisement-viewing reward to an advertisement to be viewed by αtarget (viewers). This allows the sponsors to clearly focus on αspecific target (viewers). Further, the sponsors can watch how much their advertisements are viewed by the target (viewers) to change or modify the advertisement-viewing reward in real time. This allows the advertisement time-frame transaction to be implemented based on market principles (principle of market mechanism), and thereby the fee of the advertisement time-frame can be adequately arranged to achieve αbalanced relationship between demand and supply. 3. Free Setting of Advertisement Set by Advertising Agent (see Steps Sl4 and SI5)<br>
If the viewers are forced to check the demand from sponsors or αlist of the advertisement-viewing rewards payable to the target (viewers) and select αdesired advertisement at any time when they view desired contents, it will be αcomplicated operation for the viewers. From this point of view, the system allows an advertising agent (or other administrator) to automatically produce αrecommended advertisement set to be inserted in the contents, for each of the viewers, so as to provide an access-friendly operation for the viewers. For example, an applicable advertisement set includes α"cost-oriented set" comprising one or more advertisements selected to provide αlowest fee, and α"automobile set" comprising one or more advertisements preferentially selected from advertisements associated with automobiles.<br>

As described above, based on the concept that αsponsor or advertiser pays αreward to αviewing time of an advertisement to be viewed by αviewer, the present invention allows αplurality of sponsors to changeably assign an advertisement-viewing reward to an advertisement time-frame for each target and to transact under open and fair price competition, and thereby the fee of the advertisement time-frame can be adequately arranged to achieve αbalanced relationship between demand and supply according to market principles (principle of market mechanism).<br>
The reward can be flexibly changed/modified in real time by αcomputer system.<br>
In response to changes in competitive situations or viewing circumstances, the respective rewards for the advertisement time-frames will be appropriately determined at any time.<br>
Differently from actual markets, αviewer placing αhigh value on advertising  viewings  would  view   α  desired   advertisement  even  by<br><br>
receiving αminus-reward, i.e. by paying money.<br>
The viewer will determine the selection of αdesired advertisement while predicting whether the advertisement-viewing reward thereof will be increased. This situation can be said that the advertisement timeframe transaction will approach stock transactions (securities dealing).<br>
Further, viewers can select desired advertisements and determine the amount of rewards to be received before viewing advertisements. Thus, the function of preventing advertisements from being skipped or confirming viewing of advertisements will be accepted by the viewer without any resistance, and advertisements will be evaluated at the intrinsic value.<br>
According to the above features, the advertisement-viewing reward can be freely determined by consumers, and thereby advertisement time-frames can be adequately allocated under market principles. This allows advertisement time-frames to be transacted in αprice providing αbalanced relationship between demand and supply and to be appropriately provided to consumers and advertisers in proportion to respective demands thereof.<br><br><br><br><br>
