IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY PROCEDURE<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a rapid and efficient method for carrying out<br>
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of minute quantities of<br>
biomolecules such as antigen, antibody etc. This invention particularly relates to heatmediated<br>
immobilization of antigen or antibody on to the activated surface followed<br>
by performing subsequent steps of ELISA by controlled temperature. The invented<br>
procedure has reduced the total time required for ELISA to around 3 h. The invented<br>
ELISA procedure is rapid, economical, reproducible and simple.<br>
The invented procedure is useful for carrying out ELISA required in clinical<br>
diagnostics, molecular biology, agriculture, food technology, environmental science<br>
etc. The invented ELISA method is simple, time saving and obviates the time<br>
consuming procedure. This method has the potential for automation.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a very sensitive technique<br>
used for detection of certain antigens and antibodies. ELISA has become a useful tool<br>
in diagnosis of diseases in both animals and plants. ELISA can also be used for<br>
screening of monoclonal antibodies during the course of their production (Douillard,<br>
J.Y. and Hoffman, T., 1983), pesticide residue detection in crop produce (Van Emon,<br>
J.M. and Lopez-Avila. V., 1992) and environmental samples like soil and water<br>
(Ghassempour et al. 2002), detection of apoptosis in tissue culture etc. (Salgame, P. et<br>
al. 1996).<br>
Conventional ELISA procedures carried out by immobilizing antigen or<br>
antibody on a polystyrene microtiter plate through adsorption have following<br>
drawbacks: (i) ELISA values in different wells and plates are usually inconsistent<br>
(Kricka et al., 1980; Hermann and Collins, 1976); (ii) long incubation times is<br>
required; (iii) during washing some biomolecules may detach leading to<br>
nonreproducible results (Engvall and Perlmann, 1971); and (iv) usually gives lower<br>
sensitivity (Kemeny, 1997). On the other hand, covalent binding is more sensitive<br>
(Deshpande, 1996), minimizes nonspecific binding and eliminates the above<br>
shortcomings (Douglas and Monteith, 1994). Covalent binding of immunogens to<br>
grafted plastic surfaces has been reported (Larsson, P.H. et al, 1987).<br>
Aleixo et al. (1985), actived an inert polystyrene surface by nitrating the<br>
aromatic ring of the polystyrene followed by the reduction of the nitro group to an<br>
amino group. The amino polystyrene was further activated by chemical reactions such<br>
as diazotization and the resulting activated surface was used to immobilize antigen<br>
covalently.<br>
Despite this, the conventional ELISA method requires very long time varying<br>
from several hours to 2 days for completion. This is the main drawback of different<br>
ELISA methods, based either on adsorption or on covalent binding. In case of<br>
medical urgency, precious time is lost in diagnosis before the patient could be given<br>
medication. In agriculture, ELISA is useful for detecting pesticide residues in crop<br>
produce (Van Emon, J.M. and Lopez-Avila, V., 1992) and environmental samples<br>
(Ghassempour et al. 2002).<br>
Bora et al. (2002) have reported a rapid and simple method for a double-antibody<br>
sandwich (DAS) ELISA and a direct antigen coating (DAC) ELISA by<br>
covalently immobilizing antigen or antibody onto the activated polystyrene surface<br>
which was developed by Nahar et al. (2001) by a rapid and simple method using 1-<br>
fluoro-2-nitro-4-azidobenzene (FNAB). Detection of antibodies at lower<br>
concentrations was also done successfully using the activated surface. The ELISA<br>
value obtained in eight hours by this method was found to be similar with the values<br>
obtained in the conventional ELISA method carried out in fifteen hours. Although this<br>
method had reduced, the time to about eight hours still there is a need to shorten the<br>
ELISA procedure keeping in mind its enormous application in diagnostics.<br>
The applicants in the present invention have shortened the ELISA procedure<br>
by carrying the ELISA procedure on a photoactivated polymer surface at elevated<br>
temperature. More particularly, it was carried out on a photoactivated polycarbonate<br>
and polystyrene plates at a temperature ranging from 30-70°C. Although microwavemediated<br>
rapid ELISA on an activated surface is available (P. Nahar et al. A rapid<br>
method for enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay.<br>
US Patent No. 6,498,016 (2002); PCT Application No. WO 02/14868 A), the<br>
technique is highly sensitive and slight change in energy and or time (even in seconds)<br>
can spoil the ELISA experiment. The procedure also needs microwave oven or<br>
microwave apparatus for carrying out ELISA.<br>
No literature is available for ELISA on a photoactivated surface at elevated<br>
temperature (at higher temperature than conventional ELISA usually carried out at<br>
37°C) by conventional heating such as heating in electric oven, incubator, water bath,<br>
thermocycler etc.<br>
The main advantage of the present invention is that a slight change in energy<br>
or time will not spoil the ELISA experiment in contrast to microwave- mediated<br>
ELISA.<br>
The disadvantages of the prior art methods are given in the Table I below<br>
(Table Removed) Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a heat-mediated ELISA<br>
procedure on an activated surface in short time.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a rapid technique, which<br>
can be carried out at high temperature using any temperature source.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a rapid technique, which<br>
has the potential for automation.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
With a view to achieve the objectives and overcoming the disadvantage of<br>
known ELISA method, a rapid and efficient method is provided for heat-mediated<br>
ELISA (HELISA) which comprises the steps of (i) covalent immobilization of the<br>
antigen or antibody on to the activated solid surface by heat, (ii) blocking the free<br>
surface with blocking agent by controlled heat, (iii) binding of antibody or antigen by<br>
controlled heat (iv) binding of conjugate by controlled heat, (v) adding dye-substrate<br>
to the wells and (vi) recording the absorbance value.<br>
Heat-mediated ELISA (HELISA) procedure is carried out on an activated<br>
surface in less than 3 h and with the same efficacy as in the conventional ELISA<br>
carried out at 37°C, in about 15 h. To overcome the problem of detachment of the<br>
solid phase prepared by adsorbtion, the applicants activate the surface of the wells of a<br>
PCR plate prior to use.<br>
The activated surface immobilizes the antigen through a covalent bond by<br>
controlled temperature. This covalently immobilized antigen is stable enough to<br>
repeated but brief heat exposure; which were needed for performing the<br>
subsequent steps of ELISA. Subsequent steps of biomolecule binding in the ELISA<br>
procedure are through non covalent binding which are susceptible to heat energy.<br>
These problems are overcome by controlling time and temperature in each step.<br>
Novelty of the present invention is that the ELISA is carried out on an<br>
activated surface capable of forming covalent linkage with the biomolecule.<br>
In the invented procedure, all steps of ELISA such as antigen binding,<br>
blocking, antibody and conjugate binding are carried out by thermal activation in a<br>
thermocycler and only enzyme-substrate reaction is performed out side thermocycler<br>
at room temperature.<br>
The invented procedure of ELISA is rapid with comparable or even better<br>
ELISA value than the conventional method.<br>
Another novelty of the present invention is that the invented ELISA procedure<br>
can be fully or partially automated with the use of a specially designed device.<br>
Another novelty of the present invention is that the invented procedure can be<br>
used for other immunoaisays like radio immunoassay, radio-immunosorbent test,<br>
radio allergosorbent test, biotin- avidin /streptavidin immunoassay, irnmnunoblotting,<br>
immunostaining etc. apart from different types of ELISA such as direct ELISA,<br>
indirect ELISA. sandwich ELISA and like.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a simple approach for enzyme- linked<br>
immunosorbent assay technique on an activated polycarbonate or polystyrene surface<br>
by heat exposure. Activated surface immobilizes antigen through covalent bonding by<br>
thermochemical reaction. This covalently immobilized antigen is stable enough to<br>
withstand repeated heat exposure, which are needed for performing the subsequent<br>
steps of ELISA. ELISA is a multistep and delicate process where improper condition<br>
in any step may hamper the whole result.<br>
In the invented procedure, the first step of ELISA was performed by covalent<br>
immobilization of the goat anti-human IgG onto the activated polycarbonate PCR<br>
plate by thermal incubation for 1 h in different temperatures. The optimum<br>
temperature for antigen immobilization was found as 50°C. In experiments carried out<br>
on binding of goat anti-human IgG for the same duration in same incubation<br>
temperature on untreated surface showed lower ELISA value (Table 1).<br>
Immobilization of the Goat anti-human IgG onto the activated polycarbonate<br>
PCR plate by thermal incubation at 50°C was detectable even in 20 min, which<br>
increases with the increase in time of incubation. At 60 min, the antigen binding<br>
becomes more or less same as 40 min thermal incubation. Hence, optimum time for<br>
antigen immobilization was taken as 40 min (Table 2).<br>
In the second step of HELISA, blocking was carried out with 2% BSA in 1 h<br>
at different temperatures in the thermocycler. The optimum temperature for blocking<br>
was 40°C. Further, increase in incubation temperature showed non-specific blinding<br>
(Table 3)<br>
The optimum time for blocking at 40°C with 2% BSA was found to be 40 min.<br>
Further, decrease in incubation time showed inadequate blocking (Table 4).<br>
In the third step of HELISA, antibody binding to the immobilized antigen was<br>
carried out in 1 h at different temperatures. Human IgG was found to optimally bind<br>
to the solid phase at 50°C (Table 5).<br>
The optimum time for antibody binding to the immobilized antigen at 50°C<br>
was found to be 45 min (Table 6).<br>
In the fourth step of HELISA, conjugate binding was carried out in 1 h at<br>
different temperatures. Excellent result was obtained at 50°C of incubation (Table 7).<br>
The optimization of conjugate binding time was found in the thermocycler at<br>
50°C by incubating at different duration of time. The best result was obtained in 40<br>
min (Table 8).<br>
In all the experiments, lower ELISA values were obtained when they were<br>
carried out on untreated surface.<br>
The applicants have also compared ELISA on activated polycarbonate and<br>
polystyrene plates at 37°C. Thus, when ELISA steps such as antigen binding,<br>
blocking, antibody binding and antibody-conjugate binding were carried out in 45<br>
min. 1 h, 3 h and 3 h respectively the ELISA values on both the surfaces were found<br>
similar (Table 9).<br>
The applicants also compared ELISA values, obtained on activated<br>
polycarbonate and polystyrene plates by carrying out ELISA steps at 37°C with<br>
HELISA timings such as in 40 min, 40 min, 45 min and 40 min respectively. In both<br>
the plates, the results were much lower than conventional ELISA or HELISA (Table<br>
9). It showed that the temperature is responsible for enhanched ELISA.<br>
In another experiment HELISA steps (50°C, 40 min; 40°C, 40 min; 50°C, 45<br>
min and 50°C, 40 min) were carried out on both the activated plates. For PCR<br>
polycarbonate plate thermocycler was used for high temperature incubation and for<br>
polystyrene microtiter plate, ordinary incubator was used, as normal polystyrene<br>
ELISA plates cannot fit into conventional thermocycler. However, incubator<br>
temperature for HELISA on polystyrene plate was kept 2°C higher than the<br>
thermocycler temperature in each step of ELISA. In incubator a little higher<br>
temperature is required as heat transfer is little slow here than in the thermocycler.<br>
HELISA can also be carried out on polystyrene plate in an incubator without<br>
increasing its temperature but increasing 5 min for each step of ELISA to compensate<br>
delay in heat transfer in incubator. In all cases, surfaces without activation showed<br>
much lower absorbance value. Results obtained in both these plates were very similar<br>
which suggests that heat mediated ELISA (HELISA) can be carried out on activated<br>
polystyrene microtiter plate also.<br>
IgE was also detected with same efficacy as IgG by the invented method. The<br>
standard curve prepared for quantitative assay of human IgE (Table 10 A) and the<br>
amount of IgE present in patient sera (Table 10 B) by HELISA (in 2 h 50 min) and<br>
ELISA (in 7 h 50 min) methods showed comparable results (Table 10). Thus, the<br>
invented method can reduce assay time to 2 h 50 min from 7 h 50 min without<br>
compromising the ELISA value.<br>
The invented HELISA procedure is also very sensitive as seen from Table 11,<br>
where it detected IgE in 1/8 dilution of patient sera. Thus, the present invention is<br>
rapid, sensitive and simple and can be carried out in any normal laboratory set up.<br>
The total time required for HELISA is less than 3 h. However, time required in<br>
each step may vary depending on the biomolecules where excellent results can be<br>
obtained by minor modification of reaction conditions that is minor alteration in<br>
duration and temperature of incubation. Instead of thermocycler HELISA can also be<br>
carried out in an incubator maintaining the temperature of 52°C for antigen binding,<br>
antibody binding and conjugate binding, and 42 °C for blocking for a time period of<br>
40, 45. 40 and 40 min respectively.<br>

After reconstitution, the optimum dilution was found to be 1: 5000 as<br>
determined by checkerboard titration, which was used in the experiments.<br>
In all the ELISA experiments, absorbance values are expressed as mean of<br>
three replicates.<br>
ELISA is a 5-step procedure, nairu•'" antigen binding, blocking, antibody<br>
binding, conjugate binding and color de nent. Each step of HELISA was<br>
optimized by carrying out the subsequent steps by conventional ELISA procedure.<br>
Conventional ELISA was carried out by coating the wells with antigen overnight at<br>
4°C. (45 min at 37°C for activated wells), blocking in 1 h at 37°C followed by<br>
antibody and conjugate binding at 37°C for 3 h each and color development that is<br>
enzyme-substrate reaction at room temperature for 5 min followed by reading<br>
absorbance.<br>
(Table Removed)This invention is further explained with the help of the following examples<br>
and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1 - Activation of polycarbonate and polystyrene surfaces<br>
Wells of a PCR plate (polycarbonate plate, Greiner, Germany) were loaded<br>
with 6.0 umol of 1 -fiouro-2-nitro-4-azidobenzene (FNAB), dissolved in 50 ul of<br>
methanol per well and dried completely in the dark. FNAB coated wells were then<br>
irradiated for 7.5 min with UV irradiation of 365 nm wavelength in a UV Stratalinker<br>
2400 (Stratagene®, USA) or kept under bright sunlight for 15 min. Wells of<br>
polystyrene microtiter plate were activated similarly using 10 umol of FNAB,<br>
dissolved in 50 ul methanol dried and irradiated for 10 min at 365 nm or sunlight for<br>
15 min.<br>
The wells were then washed several times with methanol to remove the<br>
unbound linker and dried at room temperature. These activated wells were used for<br>
immobilization of antigen or antibody in the invented procedure.<br>
Example 2: Determination of goat anti-human IgG concentration for the<br>
preparation of solid phase on activated polycarbonate surface<br>
A double dilution series (2000 - 0.061 g/ml) of goat anti-human IgG<br>
(dissolved 0.1 M carbonate/ bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) was loaded in triplicate wells<br>
(90 ul/well for each dilution) of an activated and untreated polycarbonate plates. The<br>
plates were then incubated at 50°C for 1 h in a thermocycler. The plates were then<br>
washed for six times with washing buffer (0.05% Tween 20 with 0.01 M PBS) and<br>
blocking step was done with with 2% BSA solution (100 ul/well) at 37°C in 1 h. After<br>
washing, each well was loaded with 90 ul of a 250 ng/ml of a human IgG solution<br>
(dissolved in 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4) and the plates were incubated at 37° for 3 h. The<br>
plates were again washed for six times and each well was loaded with 90 ul of a<br>
1/5000 (v/v), goat anti-human IgG-peroxidase conjugate solution (dissolved in 0.01 M<br>
PBS, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. After washing, 90 ul of substrate-dye<br>
solution (0.4 mg o-phenylenediamine hydrochloride and 2 ul H2O2 in 10 ml of 0.2 M<br>
:itrate buffer, pH 5) was loaded into each well. Colour development was stopped after<br>
5 min by adding 10 ul of 5% H2 864. The solutions were transferred into wells of a<br>
polystyrene microtitre plate and absorbance was recorded at 490 nm.<br>
