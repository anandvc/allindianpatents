When used herein, the term "alkyl" includes groups having straight and branched<br>
chains, for instance, and as appropriate, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl,<br>
sec-butyl, t-butyl, pentyi and hexyl. The term 'alkenyl' should be interpreted<br>
accordingly.<br>
Halo or halogen includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.<br>
Haloalkyl moieties include 1-3 halogen atoms.<br>
- 1 3 -<br>
Compounds within the invention contain a heterocyclyl group and may occur in<br>
two or more tautomeric forms depending on the nature of the heterocyclyl group; all such<br>
tautomeric forms are included within the scope of the invention.<br>
Some of the compounds of this invention may be crystallised or recrystallised<br>
from solvents such as aqueous and organic solvents. In such cases solvates may be<br>
formed. This invention includes within its scope stoichiometric solvates including<br>
hydrates as well as compounds containing variable amounts of water that may be<br>
produced by processes such as lyophilisation.<br>
Furthermore, it will be understood that phrases such as "a compound of formula<br>
(I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or N-oxide thereof are intended to encompass<br>
the compound of formula (I), an N-oxide of formula (I), a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt of the compound of formula (I), a solvate of formula (I), or any pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable combination of these. Thus by way of non-limiting example used here for<br>
illustrative purpose, "a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
thereof may include a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula (I)<br>
that is further present as a solvate.<br>
Since the compounds of formula (I) are intended for use in pharmaceutical<br>
compositions it will readily be understood that in particular embodiments they are<br>
provided in substantially pure form, for example at least 60% pure, more suitably at least<br>
75% pure and particularly at least 85%, especially at least 98% pure (% are on a weight<br>
for weight basis). Impure preparations of the compounds may be used for preparing the<br>
more pure forms used in the pharmaceutical compositions; these less pure preparations of<br>
the compounds should contain at least 1%, more suitably at least 5% and more<br>
particularly from 10% of a compound of the formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt and/or N-oxide thereof.<br>
Particular compounds according to the invention include those mentioned in the<br>
examples and their pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxides, salts and solvates.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the above-mentioned compounds of formula<br>
(I) include the acid addition or quaternary aminonium salts, for example their salts with<br>
mineral acids e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric nitric or phosphoric acids, or<br>
organic acids, e.g. acetic, fumaric, succinic, maleic, citric, benzoic, p-toluenesulphonic,<br>
methanesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic acid or tartaric acids. Compounds of formula<br>
(I) may also be prepared as the N-oxide. The invention extends to all such derivatives.<br>
Certain of the compounds of formula (I) may exist in the form of optical isomers,<br>
e.g. diastereoisomers and mixtures of isomers in all ratios, e.g. racemic mixtures. The<br>
invention includes all such forms, in particular the pure isomeric forms. For example the<br>
invention includes enantiomers and diastereoisomers at the attachment point of NR.2 and<br>
-14-<br>
R3. The different isomeric forms may be separated or resolved one from the other by<br>
conventional methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by conventional synthetic<br>
methods or by stereospecific or asymmetric syntheses. Certain compounds of formula (I)<br>
may also exist in polymorphic forms and the invention includes such polymorphic forms.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a process for preparing<br>
compounds of formula (I) where Z2 is nitrogen, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
and/or N-oxides thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula (IIA):<br>
L<br>
(IIA)<br>
in which L is a leaving group or -A(Q1)(Q2), where Ql and Q2 are both attached to the<br>
same carbon atom on A, Ql is H and Q2 is N(R20)R2' or Q1 and Q2 together form<br>
ethylenedioxy or oxo, R20 is UR5 or a group convertible thereto and R2' is R2 or a group<br>
convertible thereto, A, R1b, R2, U and R5, are as defined in formula (I), with (i) ethyl<br>
bromoacetate followed by cyclisation and oxidation or (ii) ethyl oxoacetate followed by<br>
cyclisation, to give a compound of formula (IIIA):<br>
FT- ^ N (IIIA)<br>
and thereafter optionally or as necessary converting L to -A-NR2-UR5, interconverting<br>
any variable groups, and/or forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or N-oxide<br>
thereof.<br>
The reaction variant (i) is a selective alkylation with ethyl bromoacetate under<br>
basic conditions (such as potassium carbonate) (see Yoshizawa, H. et al., Heterocycles<br>
(2004), 63(8), 1757-1763 for an example of this selectivity in the alkylation of 2,3-<br>
diaminopyridines), thermal cyclisation under strong basic conditions (such as potassium<br>
t-butoxide) and then oxidation with manganese dioxide under conventional conditions<br>
(see for examples Smith, M.B.; March, J.M. Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley-<br>
Interscience 2001).<br>
The reaction variant (ii) may be carried out in toluene and the cyclisation effected<br>
under strongly basic conditions (such as potassium t-butoxide).<br>
-15-<br>
L may be a hydroxy group which can be oxidised to the aldehyde by conventional<br>
means such as l,l,l-tris-(acetyloxy)-l,l-dihydro-l,2-benziodooxol-3-(lH)-one for<br>
reductive alkylation with HA-N(R20)R2' under conventional conditions (see for<br>
examples Smith, M.B.; March, J.M. Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley-Interscience<br>
2001).<br>
Alternatively L may be bromo which can be alkylated with HA-N(R20)R2' UNder<br>
conventional conditions.<br>
Where Q1 and Q2 together form ethylenedioxy the ketal may be converted to the<br>
ketone (Q1 and Q2 together form oxo) by conventional acid hydrolysis treatment with eg<br>
aqueous HC1 or trifluoroacetic acid and the conversion to NR2UR5 by conventional<br>
reductive alkylation with amine NHR2'R20 (see for example Nudelman, A., et al,<br>
Tetrahedron 60 (2004) 1731-1748) and subsequent conversion to the required substituted<br>
amine, or directly with NHR2URS, such as with sodium triacetoxyborohydride in<br>
dichloromethane/methanol.<br>
Conveniently one of R20 and R2' is an N-protecting group, such as such as tbutoxycarbonyl,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl or 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyI. This may be<br>
removed by several methods well known to those skilled in the art (for examples see<br>
"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-<br>
Interscience, 1999), for example conventional acid hydrolysis with, for example<br>
trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid. The invention further provides compounds of<br>
formula (IIIA) in which L is -A-N(R20)R2' and R20 is hydrogen.<br>
The free amine of formula (IIIA) in which R20 is hydrogen may be converted to<br>
NR2UR5 by conventional means such as amide formation with an acyl derivative<br>
R5COW, for compounds where U is CO or, where U is CH2, by alkylation with an alkyl<br>
halide R5CH2-halide in the presence of base, acylation/reduction with an acyl derivative<br>
R5COW or reductive alkylation with an aldehyde R5CHO under conventional conditions<br>
(see for examples Smith, M.B.; March, J.M. Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley-<br>
Interscience 2001). The appropriate reagents containing the required R5 group are<br>
known compounds or may be prepared analogously to known compounds, see for<br>

Where R5 contains an NH group, this may be protected with a suitable Nprotecting<br>
group such as t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or 9-<br>
fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl during the coupling of the R5 derivative with the free amine<br>
of formula (IIB). The protecting group may be removed by conventional methods, such<br>
as by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a process for preparing<br>
compounds of formula (I) where Z1 is nitrogen, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
and/or N-oxides thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula (IIB):<br>

of compounds of formula (IIIA).<br>

Chloropyridine (2) can be reacted with allylamine to give (3) which can then be cyclised<br>
with bromine generating pyridone (4) after a hydrolytic workup (see Schmid, S et al,<br>

Biomolecular Chemistry (2005), 3(11), 2140-2144 for an example of this type of<br>
catalysis in a Heck reaction) gives acryate (3). Hydrogenation of the double bond of (3)<br>
followed by acid treatment to remove the pivalate residue and effect lactamisation yields<br>
the bicyclic lactam (4). Conversion to the epoxide (5) can be effected in a number of<br>
ways - reaction with epichlorohydrin under basic conditions affords racemic epoxide.<br>

Reaction with (commercially available) R or S-glycidyl nosylate ((2R)- or (2S)-2-<br>
oxiranylmethyl 3-nitrobenzenesulfonate) or (2R)- or (2.S)-2-oxiranylmethyl 4-<br>
methylbenzenesulfonate, with base eg sodium hydride or potassium t-butoxide, gives the<br>
corresponding chiral epoxides. Alternatively, allylation with allyl bromide under basic<br>
conditions affords the corresponding N-allyl material which can be epoxidised under<br>
standard achiral or chiral conditions to give the corresponding achiral or chiral epoxides.<br>
The epoxide(s) (5) may be opened with amine H-A(Q1)(Q2) such as 1,1-dimethylethyI 4-<br>
piperidinylcarbamate by heating in DMF to afford (6) which can then be cyclised with<br>
methanesulphonic anhydride to give (7). Alternatively, the epoxide (5) may be opened<br>
and cyclised directly with heating, to afford (7) (L=OH). Oxidation to (8) may be carried<br>
out by oxidation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone (DDQ). Subsequent<br>
conversion to compounds of formula (I) may be carried out as generally described herein.<br>
In particular, conversion of L to A(Q1)(Q2) may be carried out on (7) or (8). As a furter<br>
variation to Scheme 3, epoxide (5) may be prepared from (2) by first introducing a<br>
suitable epoxide precursor group (-CH2-CHOH-CH2OH, protected as a cyclic ester)<br>
before carrying out the steps (b) and (c).<br>
The invention further provides compounds of formula (8) from Scheme 3 in<br>
which L is -A-N(R20)R2' and R20 is hydrogen.<br>

Compound (1) (Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters (2005), 15(24), 5446-<br>

with aminonia to give (4). Alternatively (1) may be converted to (3) by coupling with<br>
Boc- glycine followed by acidic deprotection to give (4). Compound (4) may then be<br>

Interconversions ofRl a,Rlb,R2,AandR5 are conventional. In compounds<br>
which contain an optionally protected hydroxy group, suitable conventional hydroxy<br>
protecting groups which may be removed without disrupting the remainder of the<br>
molecule include acyl and alkylsilyl groups. N-protecting groups are removed by<br>
conventional methods.<br>
Interconversion of R1a and R1b groups maybe carried out conventionally, on<br>
compounds of formula (I). For example R1a or R1b methoxy is convertible to R1a or<br>
RlD hydroxy by treatment with lithium and diphenylphosphine (general method<br>
described in Ireland et al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1973, 7829) or HBr. Alkylation of the<br>
hydroxy group with a suitable alkyl derivative bearing a leaving group such as halide,<br>
- 2 5 -<br>
yields R1a or R1b substituted alkoxy. Rla or Rlb halo such as bromo may be converted<br>
to cyano by treatment with copper (I) cyanide in N,N-dimethylformamide. Rla or R1b<br>
carboxy may be obtained by conventional hydrolysis of R l a or Rib cyano, and the<br>
carboxy converted to hydroxymethyl by conventional reduction.<br>

examples.<br>
The antibacterial compounds according to the invention may be formulated for<br>
administration in any convenient way for use in human or veterinary medicine, by<br>
analogy with other antibacterials/antitubercular compounds.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be formulated for<br>
administration by any route and include those in a form adapted for oral, topical or<br>
parenteral use and may be used for the treatment of bacterial infection including<br>
tuberculosis in mammals including humans.<br>
The compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules,<br>
lozenges, suppositories, creams or liquid preparations, such as oral or sterile parenteral<br>
solutions or suspensions.<br>
The topical formulations of the present invention may be presented as, for<br>
instance, ointments, creams or lotions, eye ointments and eye or ear drops, impregnated<br>
dressings and aerosols, and may contain appropriate conventional additives such as<br>
preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration and emollients in ointments and creams.<br>
The formulations may also contain compatible conventional carriers, such as<br>
cream or ointment bases and ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions. Such carriers may be<br>
present as from about 1% up to about 98% of the formulation. More usually they will<br>
form up to about 80% of the formulation.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation<br>
form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example<br>
syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example<br>
lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants,<br>
-26-<br>
for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants, for<br>
example potato starch; or acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The<br>
tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical<br>
practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily<br>
suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product<br>
for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid<br>
preparations may contain conventional additives, such as suspending agents, for example<br>
sorbitol, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for<br>
example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may<br>
include edible oils), for example almond oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene<br>
glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate<br>
or sorbic acid, and, if desired, conventional flavouring or colouring agents.<br>
Suppositories will contain conventional suppository bases, e.g. cocoa-butter or<br>
other glyceride.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the<br>
compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The compound, depending on the<br>
vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In<br>
preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved m water for injection and filter<br>
sterilised before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing.<br>
Advantageously, agents such as a local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering<br>
agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be<br>
frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. The dry<br>
lyophilized powder is then sealed in the vial and an accompanying vial of water for<br>
injection may be supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use. Parenteral suspensions<br>
are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in<br>
the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by<br>
filtration. The compound can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before<br>
suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is<br>
included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
The compositions may contain from 0.1% by weight, preferably from 10-60% by<br>
weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration. Where the<br>
compositions comprise dosage units, each unit will preferably contain from 50-1000 mg<br>
of the active ingredient. The dosage as employed for adult human treatment will<br>
preferably range from 100 to 3000 mg per day, for instance 1500 mg per day depending<br>
on the route and frequency of administration. Such a dosage corresponds to about 1.5 to<br>
about 50 mg/kg per day. Suitably the dosage is from 5 to 30 mg/kg per day.<br>
-27-<br>
The compound of formula (I) may be the sole therapeutic agent in the<br>
compositions of the invention or a combination with other antibacterials including<br>
antirubercular compounds. If the other antibacterial is a ß-lactam then a ß-lactamase<br>
inhibitor may also be employed.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be used in the treatment of bacterial infections<br>
caused by a wide range of organisms including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive<br>
organisms, such as upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue<br>
infections and/or urinary tract infections. Compounds of formula (I) may be also used in<br>
the treatment of tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Some compounds of<br>
formula (I) may be active against more than one organism. This may be determined by<br>
the methods described herein.<br>
The following examples illustrate the preparation of certain compounds of<br>
formula (I) and the activity of certain compounds of formula (I) against various bacterial<br>
organisms including Mycobacterium tuberculosis.<br>

suspended in DCM (30ml) and 4M HC1 in 1,4-dioxane (15ml) was added to give a bright<br>
yellow suspension (and gas evolution). The bright yellow mixture was allowed to stand at<br>
room temperature for 1 hour. LCMS showed no starting material remaining. The solvents<br>
were removed under reduced pressure and the residue was dried under reduced pressure<br>
overnight to give the dihydrochloride salt of the title compound as an amorphous tan<br>
solid (1.760g (&gt; theoretical yield for the dihydrochloride owing to the presence of<br>

A portion of the crude dihydrochloride (0.513g) was dissolved in methanol (4ml)<br>
plus water (1ml) and applied to an SCX column (lOg) (preconditioned with 2 column<br>
volumes of methanol). The column was then eluted, under gravity, using (i) methanol<br>

combined and evaporated under reduced pressure to give the crude title compound as a<br>
tan amorphous solid (410 mg), which contained methanol-insoluble material not apparent<br>
by LCMS (possibly aminonium chloride). The product was shaken with methanol (30 ml)<br>

(a) 3,4,6-Trichloropyridazine<br>
This was prepared by a slight variation on the method of Kasnar et ah<br>
Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides (1994), 13(1-3), 459-79.<br>
Hydrazine sulphate salt (51 g) was suspended in water (250ml), heated to reflux<br>
and bromomaleic anhydride (90.38 g) was added dropwise. The mixture was heated at<br>
reflux for 4 hours then cooled to room temperature. The reaction was repeated with 29g<br>
hydrazine sulphate, 53g bromomaleic anhydride and 130ml water. The precipitates were<br>
collected by filtration, washed with water and acetone and dried as a combined batch in<br>
vacuo to afford 4-bromo-l,2-dihydro-3,6-pyridazinedione as a white solid (113 g).<br>
The solid in two batches was treated with phosphorus oxychloride (2x200 ml) and<br>
heated to reflux for 3.5 hours. The mixture was cooled, evaporated and azeotroped with<br>
toluene. The residue was partitioned between dichloromethane and saturated aqueous<br>
sodium bicarbonate solution and extracted with DCM twice more. The organic extracts<br>
were dried and evaporated. This residue was re-dissolved in dichloromethane, and<br>
chromatographed on silica gel (300 g) (DCM as eluent) to give a white solid (101.5 g,<br>
87%).<br>
(LC/MS analysis showed ca 20-30% impurity, isomers of bromo-dichloropyridazine).<br>

(b)2-[(3,6-Dichloro-4-pyridazinyl)oxy]ethanol<br>
A solution of ethylene glycol (55 ml) in tetrahydrofuran (200 ml) was treated at<br>
around 0°C (ice bath cooling) with sodium hydride (60% dispersion in oil, 5.9 g) over 40<br>
minutes. After the addition was complete, 3,4,6-trichloropyridazine (27 g) containing<br>
isomers of bromo-dichloropyridazine as impurity was added portionwise and washed in<br>
with more dry THF (50ml) and the mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 hour and then at room<br>
-123-<br>
temperature overnight. The mixture was concentrated (to 1/3 volume) then diluted with<br>
aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and extracted with chloroform (5x) and ethyl<br>
acetate (3x). The combined organic extracts were washed with water, dried over sodium<br>
sulphate and evaporated and the solids filtered off and washed with CHCI3 (x3) and dried<br>
in a vacuum oven overnight at 40°C affording a white solid (25.5 g, 83%), containing<br>
some bromo-derivative (10-15%).<br>

A solution of 2-[(3,6-dichloro-4-pyridazinyl)oxy]ethanoI containing some bromoderivative<br>
(15.46 g; 0.0703 mol) in dry 1,4-dioxane (1.2 L) was treated with lithium<br>
hydride (2.3 g; 0.28 mol) in portions and stirred at room temperature for 1 hour under<br>
argon, then heated at 110 °C overnight. The reaction mixture was quenched with wet 1,4-<br>
dioxane, then iced-water. The solution was evaporated to half volume, taken to pH 8 with<br>
5M hydrochloric acid and evaporated to dryness. Water was added and the residue was<br>
extracted 5x with chloroform, dried (sodium sulphate) and evaporated to afford a white<br>
solid (12.4 g, ca.77%) (containing ca. 15% of a bromo species).<br>
MS (+ve ion electrospray) m/z 173/5 (CI MH+); 217/9 (Br MH+)<br>
(d) 3-Ethenyl-6,7-dihydro[l ,4]dioxino[2,3-c]pyridazine<br>
A solution of 3-chloro-6,7-dihydro[l,4]dioxino[2,3-c]pyridazine (13.6 g, 0.079<br>
mol) containing ca. 15% of a bromo species in dimethoxyethane (400 ml) was degassed<br>
under argon for 10 min then tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0) (2 g), potassium<br>
carbonate (10.33 g), 2,4,6-trivinylcyclotriboroxane pyridine complex (11.32 g) and water<br>
(55 ml) were added. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 48 hours and cooled and<br>
evaporated to dryness. The mixture was treated with aqueous sodium bicarbonate<br>
solution and extracted (5x) with DCM. Extracts were dried (sodium sulphate), evaporated<br>

Biological Activity<br>
Antimicrobial Activity Assay:<br>
Whole-cell antimicrobial activity was determined by broth microdilution using the<br>
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommended procedure, Document<br>
M7-A7, "Methods for Dilution Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically".<br>
The compounds were tested in serial two-fold dilutions ranging from 0.016 to 16 mcg/ml.<br>
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest<br>
concentration of compound that inhibited visible growth. A mirror reader was used to<br>
assist in determining the MIC endpoint.<br>
Compounds were evaluated against Gram-positive organisms, selected from<br>
Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes,<br>
Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.<br>
In addition, compounds were evaluated against Gram-negative organisms selected<br>
from Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella<br>
pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.<br>
Each of the listed Examples, as identified in the present application, except<br>
Examples 71-73 and 76-79, was tested in at least one exemplified salt or free base form.<br>
Unless otherwise noted, the tested Examples had a MIC 
least one of the organisms listed above, with the exception of Example 9 which had an<br>
MIC 
one strain of every organism listed above, at least one Example had a MIC 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv Inhibition Assay<br>
The measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each tested<br>
compound was performed in 96 wells flat-bottom, polystyrene microtiter plates. Ten twofold<br>
drug dilutions in neat DMSO starting at 400uM were performed. Five ul of these<br>
drug solutions were added to 95 ul of Middlebrook 7H9 medium. (Lines A-H, rows 1-10<br>
of the plate layout). Isoniazid was used as a positive control, 8 two-fold dilution of<br>
Isoniazid starting at 160 µgml-1 was prepared and 5 µl of mis control curve was added to<br>
95 ul of Middlebrook 7H9 (Difco catalogue Ref. 271310) + ADC medium (Becton<br>
Dickinson Catalogue Ref. 211887). (Row 11, lines A-H). Five ul of neat DMSO were<br>
added to row 12 (growth and Blank controls).<br>
The inoculum was standardised to approximately 1x107 cfu/ml and diluted 1 in<br>
100 in Middlebrook 7H9+ADC medium and 0.025% Tween 80 (Sigma P4780), to<br>
produce the final inoculum of H37Rv strain (ATCC25618). One hundred ul of this<br>
inoculum was added to the entire plate but G-12 and H-12 wells (Blank controls). All<br>
plates were placed in a sealed box to prevent drying out of the peripheral wells and they<br>
were incubated at 37°C without shaking for six days. A resazurin solution was prepared<br>
by dissolving one tablet of resazunn (Resazurin Tablets for Milk Testing; Ref 330884Y<br>
VWR International Ltd) in 30 ml sterile PBS (phosphate buffered saline). 25 ul of this<br>
solution was added to each well. Fluorescence was measured (Spectramax M5 Molecular<br>
Devices, Excitation 530nm, Emission 590nm) after 48 hours to determine the MIC value.<br>
Examples 1-4, 5A, 6A, 7-9,12,13A, 14,15,16A, 17A, 19A, 20, 23-32, 34, 37-<br>
44, 46-50, 53-57, 59 and 63 were tested in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv<br>
inhibition assay. Examples 2, 4, 5A, 6A, 7, 8,12, 13A, 14, 16A, 19A, 20, 23-26, 28-32,<br>
34, 37, 39,40, 42,44,46, 49, 50, 56, 59 and 63 showed an MIC value of lower than 2.0<br>
µg/ml. Examples 4, 5A, 7, 8,12,13A, 14,16A, 19A, 25, 26, 30-32, 37, 40,49, 50, and 56<br>
