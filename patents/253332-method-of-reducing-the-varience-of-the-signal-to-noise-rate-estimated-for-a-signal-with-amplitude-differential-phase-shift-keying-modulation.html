OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
As stated in the title of this specification, the<br>
present invention refers to a procedure for reduction of<br>
the variance of the estimation of the signal to noise ratio<br>
of a signal with phase differential amplitude coherent<br>
modulation.<br>
The procedure of the invention is applicable to<br>
communications systems independently of the physical medium<br>
used for the communication.<br>
This procedure permits the variance of the estimations<br>
to be reduced and to equalize that variance among the<br>
optimum constellations of odd and even bits per symbol. In<br>
this way, the system can be adapted to the maximum data<br>
transfer rate offered by the channel.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
In telecommunications systems for sending information<br>
via a communications channel, the information needs to be<br>
modulated; in other words, it needs to be adapted and<br>
matched to the channel.<br>
Some of the main problems which a receiver of digital<br>
communications encounters are equalization, which entails<br>
an estimation of the channel, and frequency deviation of<br>
the receiver clock with respect to the transmitter. When<br>
QAM (square amplitude modulation) coherent modulations are<br>
used, where the point of the constellation is determined by<br>
the amplitude and phase of the signal sent, the demodulator<br>
has to be made much more complex in order to tackle the<br>
problems stated above. One solution consists of using<br>
differential modulations or DAPSK (amplitude and phase differential modulation) where the information is coded in<br>
the amplitude and phase increments. This differential<br>
coding eliminates the need for estimation of the channel in<br>
reception and to a large degree minimizes the effects of<br>
frequency deviation between the clocks. But this reduction<br><br>
in the complexity of the receiver when using a totally<br>
differential modulation is associated with an increase in<br>
the bit error probability for the same SNR (signal to noise<br>
ratio) value compared to the performance of QAM<br>
modulations. ADPSK modulation (phase differential amplitude<br>
coherent modulation) is known in the state of the art as it<br>
appears in "Comparison and optimization of differentially<br>
encoded transmission on fading channels", L. Lampe and R.<br>
Fischer, Proceedings ISPLC'99; "Performance evaluation of<br>
non-coherent transmission over power lines", L. Lampe, R.<br>
Fischer and R. Schober, Proceedings ISPLC'OO; "Differential<br>
encoding strategies for transmission over fading channels",<br>
R. Fischer, L. Lampe and S. Calabro, International Journal<br>
on Electronics and Communications; as a mixed modulation<br>
between the above two and which represents the intermediate<br>
point in terms of performance and complexity of receiver<br>
between them both. In other words, it minimizes the problem<br>
implied by frequency deviation between the clocks of the<br>
transmitter and receiver in a digital communications system<br>
and decreases the complexity of estimation of the channel<br>
since it is only necessary to estimate the channel in<br>
amplitude. So, ADPSK modulation represents the best<br>
compromise between performance and complexity of the<br>
receiver for a practical implementation.<br>
Moreover, in order to obtain at all times the maximum<br>
data transfer rate, the bits per carrier of the modulation<br>
need to be adapted to the capacity offered by the channel.<br>
In other words, given a target bit error probability, the<br>
aim is to use the maximum number of bits per carrier that<br>
ensure an error probability equal to or less than that<br>
value. Also, in a point to multipoint or multipoint to<br>
multipoint multiuser communication, a transmitter can send<br>
information to several receivers with different channels<br>
between that transmitter and each of the receivers in a<br>
single data frame. Therefore, different constellations will<br>
be used in the same frame. So, it is necessary to estimate<br>
the signal to noise ratio (SNR) perceived by the receiver<br><br>
in order to choose the number of bits per carrier to use.<br>
Another important factor for achieving that maximum<br>
data transfer rate is to minimize the overhead (control<br>
information on the system necessary for a correct reception<br>
of the data and which is sent along with it). This overhead<br>
is more important if transmission strategies are used based<br>
on the use of multiple carriers such as OFDM (orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing) where the symbol times are<br>
much greater and contain a lot more information than in a<br>
digital communication in which a single information carrier<br>
frequency is used.<br>
ADPSK modulation has two important requirements. The<br>
first is that, owing to the fact that part of the<br>
information is coded in the phase increments, a symbol<br>
previously needs to be sent constituting a phase reference<br>
for the receiver. Also, the rest of the information is<br>
coded in the value of the amplitude of the received symbol.<br>
So, the second requirement implies estimating the value of<br>
the amplitude of the response from the channel in order to<br>
correct its effect in the receiver. Moreover, real channels<br>
display a certain variation in their characteristics with<br>
time, which compels the receiver to conduct a monitoring<br>
and updating of that initial estimation. In addition, this<br>
time variation also requires a continual updating of the<br>
estimation of the SNR.<br>
The articles cited above describe the functioning of<br>
the ADPSK modulator and demodulator and its performance,<br>
without considering the possibility of employing different<br>
constellations within a single data frame. This<br>
possibility is. considered and resolved in the Spanish<br>
patent application P-200301120 (unpublished), referring to<br>
a "Procedure for phase differential amplitude coherent<br>
modulation standardized for multiuser communication", which<br>
permits the sending of a single phase reference at the<br>
beginning of the frame and facilitates a practical<br>
implementation of the low-complexity modulator.<br>
Moreover, this procedure permits the insertion of data<br><br>
symbols in the frame in such a way that users to which the<br>
data from the transmitter is not directed, and who do not<br>
know the constellation with which it is modulated, can<br>
monitor the channel and follow its variations in both<br>
amplitude and SNR.<br>
Therefore, in order to optimize the data transfer in a<br>
multiuser communication, it is necessary to make an<br>
estimation of the SNR perceived by the receiver. This<br>
estimation can only be made when the constellation in which<br>
the received data is modulated is known by the receiver.<br>
Also, the period during which the SNR is estimated can<br>
include symbols modulated with different constellations.<br>
Thus, the problem to. solve consists of estimating' the<br>
SNR in the receiver of a signal with ADPSK modulation<br>
during a period comprising reception of a certain number of<br>
data symbols with the possibility that they are modulated<br>
using different constellations. In the article "A<br>
comparison of SNR estimation techniques for the AWGN<br>
channel", D. Pauluzzi and N. Beaulieu, IEEE Transactions on<br>
Communication, vol. 48, N° 10, October 2000, various<br>
techniques are presented for estimating the SNR of a signal<br>
with coherent phase modulation (PSK). Also, it is stated<br>
how to extend those techniques to a QAM modulation. In both<br>
cases, no account is taken of the fact that the<br>
constellation can change during the estimation time.<br>
The average power of the transmitted signal can be<br>
known if the constellation is normalized in power and the<br>
effect of the channel in reception is equalized. Then, in<br>
order to estimate the SNR in the receiver, it is merely<br>
necessary to estimate the noise power in the received<br>
constellation. This estimation of the noise power is easily<br>
done by means of averaging the samples<br>
of the noise power. So, the problem consists of calculating<br>
those samples in the receiver. But another added problem is<br>
the differential character of the phase in ADPSK<br>
modulation; in this case the constellation received is the<br>
constellation formed by the amplitudes and the phase<br><br>
increments that are received. If the value of the samples<br>
of the noise power is obtained by means of calculating the<br>
modulus squared of the noise vector given by the error in<br>
amplitude and by the error in phase increment, without any<br>
modification, it is observed that the estimation presents a<br>
greater variance in the constellations of odd bits per<br>
symbol. This effect is not admissible because the period<br>
during which the SNR is estimated can include symbols<br>
modulated with different constellations in an optimum<br>
multiuser communications system. This communications system<br>
also includes transmissions aimed at multiple users<br>
(multicast) or at all of them (broadcast) , as well as<br>
transmission to a single user (unicast).<br>
The procedure of the proposed invention presents a<br>
method of estimating the SNR of a signal with ADPSK<br>
modulation which equalizes the variances of the estimation<br>
in constellations with even and odd bits per symbol,<br>
furthermore. reducing the variance of that estimation for<br>
all cases.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to achieve the objectives and avoid the<br>
drawbacks stated in the above sections, the invention<br>
consists of a procedure for reduction of the variance of<br>
the estimation of the signal to noise ratio of a signal<br>
with phase differential amplitude coherent modulation.<br>
Said procedure is applicable to two-way communication of<br>
multiple sets of user equipment in which a modulation is<br>
used that is differential in phase and coherent in<br>
amplitude, which requires the sending of a phase reference<br>
symbol prior to sending the information, and where an<br>
estimation is made of the signal to noise ratio with the<br>
aim of using a modulation with the maximum number of bits<br>
per symbol, maintaining the bit error probability in<br>
reception within certain given margins. The procedure of<br>
the invention is characterized in that, starting from the<br>
amplitude error and the error in the phase increment<br>
corresponding to the received point of the constellation, a<br><br>
translation is performed of those errors to the<br>
corresponding point of the first ring of the constellation<br>
as if this had been the one that was transmitted and<br>
without those errors undergoing any modification, and later<br>
on the modulus squared of the error vector is calculated.<br>
This characteristic permits samples of noise to be<br>
calculated, the variance of the values obtained to be<br>
reduced and that variance to be equalized among the optimum<br>
constellations of odd and even bits per symbol.<br>
Moreover, an average can be taken of the modulus<br>
squared of the noise samples in order to estimate the<br>
average value of the noise power, the number of samples to<br>
average being a configurable value of the system.<br>
In reception, first of all the amplitude and the phase<br>
increment are detected, and then those values are<br>
subtracted from the received amplitude or phase increment,<br>
or vice versa, in other words, the detected amplitude and<br>
phase increment are respectively subtracted from the<br>
received amplitude and phase increment; thus, an initial<br>
form of calculating the noise samples is done in blind<br>
mode, without knowing the symbol transmitted in the<br>
calculation of the amplitude and phase increment errors.<br>
Another way of obtaining the modulus squared of the-<br>
noise vector consists of respectively subtracting the<br>
received amplitude and phase increment from the amplitude<br>
and phase increment of the transmitted symbols previously<br>
known in reception, or vice versa, in other words, the<br>
amplitude and phase increment of the transmitted previously<br>
symbols known in reception are respectively subtracted from<br>
the received amplitude and phase increment; thus, the<br>
samples of noise are calculated using a sequence of symbols<br>
previously known in reception for the calculation of the<br>
amplitude and phase increment errors.<br>
In order to improve the final estimation, the<br>
invention provides for combining the above estimations, in<br>
such a way that the receiver equipment which estimates the<br>
signal to noise ratio combines blind estimations with<br><br>
estimations with a known sequence of symbols.<br>
Also, as this is a multiuser communications system,<br>
the samples of the noise power to average can belong to<br>
different constellations. So, in order to correct the bias<br>
of the estimator due to the differential character of the<br>
modulation and of different value in each constellation,<br>
each of the samples of the noise power being averaged is<br>
multiplied by the corresponding value.<br>
Below, in order to facilitate a better understanding<br>
of this specification and forming an integral part thereof,<br>
some figures are included in which the object of the<br>
invention has been represented in a manner that is<br>
illustrative rather than limiting.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Given below is a description of an example of the<br>
invention, making reference to the numbering adopted in the<br>
figures.<br>
As has been mentioned in the section on the background<br>
to the invention, the basic operations which an ADPSK<br>
receiver has to perform are compensating for the effect of<br>
attenuation of the channel in amplitude and calculating the<br>
phase increment in the received signal. After that, the<br>
detector is what is responsible for obtaining the<br>
transmitted information. All these operations are known in<br>
the state of the art and appear in the references cited<br>
earlier.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows an example in which the constellation<br>
is formed from the equalized amplitude and the phase<br>
increment of the received signal for a constellation of 6<br>
bits per symbol with an SNR of 27.9 decibels (dB) and a<br>
frequency error of 5 parts per million (ppm). The<br>
continuous radial lines represent the optimum thresholds of<br>
decision for the phase increments. It is also observed that<br>
the received points are grouped into clouds of points with<br>
an elliptical shape, which becomes more pronounced when the<br>
amplitude of the rings is greater, due to the differential<br>
nature of the modulation. These clouds of points are<br>
centred on each of the points of the constellation and are<br>
due to the noise which is added to the signal. But, as can<br>
be seen, the clouds of points are not centred between the<br>
optimum thresholds but are instead displaced by a certain<br>
number of radians. This fixed displacement is determined by<br>
the frequency error in the receiver.<br>
Given that the power of the transmitted signal is<br>
known, the SNR estimator only has to estimate the noise<br>
power which the receiver suffers. For this, an average is<br>
taken of N samples of noise power in different symbols:<br><br>
Where \e(k) \2 is the kth sample of the noise power<br>
affecting the receiver. Figure 2 shows a schematic<br>
presentation of the magnitudes involved in calculating the<br>
samples of that power. The starting data will be the<br>
amplitude error ek (1), and the error in the phase<br>
increment eϴk (4) of the received point of the<br>
constellation (3), with respect to the detected point (8),<br>
which are calculated as follows:<br><br><br>
Where Ak is the detected amplitude, Ak is the received<br>
amplitude equalized in order to compensate the attenuation<br>
of the channel, Δφk is the detected phase increment and Δφk is<br>
the received phase increment. The sample of the noise power<br>
is obtained by calculating the modulus squared of the<br>
vector (2):<br><br>
Where r3 (7) is the detected amplitude Ak for the<br>
example shown in figure 2. Therefore the formula would<br>
become:<br><br>
Which represents the modulus squared of the error<br>
vector (2). This is the simplest and most immediate way of<br>
calculating the samples of the noise power, but it provokes<br>
differences between the variance of the estimator of the<br>
constellations with odd and even bits per symbol. As<br>
explained earlier, when the amplitude of the ring is<br>
greater, so the cloud of points acquires a more pronounced<br>
elliptical shape. As the optimum constellations with an odd<br>
number of bits per symbol proportionally present more rings<br>
than phases compared with those with an even number of bits<br>
per symbol, they show the effect described above in a way<br>
that is more visible. For the same value of SNR, the<br>
greater the amplitude of the detected point, the greater<br>
will be the average of the modulus squared of the noise<br>
vector. So, N samples of noise power calculated starting<br>
from a constellation with an odd number of bits per symbol<br>
will present a greater scattering than N samples calculated<br>
starting from a constellation with an even number of bits.<br>
Therefore, the variance which the estimator will present in<br>
the constellations of odd bits per symbol will be greater.<br>
Also, that same effect of increment in the size of the<br>
ellipses of points as the amplitude of the ring increases<br>
also causes an increase in the variance for a given<br><br>
constellation.<br>
Therefore, the objective is to make the samples<br>
independent of the noise power of the ring to which the<br>
detected point belongs.<br>
So, one could think of projecting the error vector (2)<br>
onto the first ring of radius r1 (6), with which the kth<br>
sample of the noise power of projected onto the first ring<br>
e'(k) (5) is obtained, using for this the theory of similar<br>
triangles. Therefore, for the example of embodiment<br>
described in figure 2, the new sample of the noise power<br>
can be calculated as:<br><br>
But in this way, none of the problems set out earlier<br>
are solved, since the amplitude error (1) is modified as a<br>
function of the ring of the constellation to which the<br>
detected point belongs.<br>
The procedure of the invention that is presented<br>
solves these problems by translating the phase error and<br>
the amplitude error to the corresponding point of the first<br>
ring of the constellation as if this was the one that had<br>
been detected. Figure 3 represents an example of embodiment<br>
in which this translation is made. So, the samples of the<br>
noise power, which is the modulus squared of the new error<br>
vector (9), are calculated as follows:<br><br>
Where r1 (6) is the amplitude of the first ring of the<br>
corresponding constellation. Also, as explained earlier,<br>
the average of N samples is taken for calculating the noise<br>
power in the same way:<br><br>
Figure 4 shows an example of a block diagram of a<br>
receiver implementing the procedure of the invention that<br><br>
is presented. The starting data needed by the block<br>
calculating the samples of the noise power (12) are the<br>
amplitude error ek (1), the phase error eϴk (4) and the<br>
number of bits of the constellation (14). The amplitude and<br>
phase errors are calculated by an amplitude detector (10)<br>
and by a phase detector (11), respectively. In order to<br>
calculate these two errors, the equalized amplitude Ak<br>
(19), the received phase increment Δφk (20) and the number<br>
of bits per symbol of the constellation (14) are required.<br>
Moreover, the calculation of the phase (4) and amplitude<br>
(1) errors can be done in two ways. The first consists of<br>
calculating those errors on the basis of the detection of<br>
the amplitude (19) and of the phase increment (20) that are<br>
received; in other words, the sequence of symbols sent by<br>
the transmitter is not known. This mode is known as blind<br>
estimation and is affected by detection errors, which<br>
prevents the SNR from being estimated properly when these<br>
errors occur, since the calculated errors will be smaller<br>
in magnitude than those which have actually taken place and<br>
the estimation of the SNR will be greater than that which<br>
is really affecting the system. The second way of<br>
calculating the phase and amplitude errors is based on a<br>
knowledge of the transmitted sequence, due to which those<br>
errors will correspond exactly to those produced when there<br>
is no detection involved in the process. In this example of<br>
embodiment, both are done, so by means of a block (21) the<br>
values of amplitude Aki (23) and of phase increment Δφki (24)<br>
that are transmitted are generated. There has to exist an<br>
identical block in the transmitter so that the sequences in<br>
transmission and reception can be equal. A signal (22)<br>
informs on the type of estimation being done, blind mode or<br>
with known sequence. So, the amplitude (10) and phase (11)<br>
detectors will in this case only have to carry out<br>
subtraction between the values (19) and (23) in the case of<br>
amplitude, and between the values (24) and (20) in the case<br>
of phase increment.<br>
As this concerns a multiuser communications system,<br><br>
the receiver will not always recognise the constellation<br>
with which the data being received is modulated. It will<br>
only know it in a unicast communication when it is the<br>
destination of the transmitted data or when a multicast<br>
communication is made which includes it in the group of<br>
recipients or in a broadcast; for that reason, the N<br>
samples of the noise power which are averaged can belong to<br>
different constellations. A signal (15) indicates that the<br>
constellation is known and that the samples of the noise<br>
power can be calculated.<br>
By means of simulations, it is confirmed that the<br>
estimator described so far in this invention procedure is<br>
biased. This bias is due to the differential character of<br>
the modulation, since the phase increment is affected by<br>
the noise of two symbols and is detailed in the following<br>
table as a function of the constellation:<br><br>
The block (12) has to apply this correction factor K<br>
to the samples of the noise power in order to correct the<br>
biased nature of the estimator, by means of:<br><br>
The number of bits per symbol (14) serves to determine<br>
the value of r1 (6) and of the correction factor K to use<br>
in the calculation. This correction has to be made sample<br>
by sample since these samples can belong to different<br>
constellations. As an average of the samples of taken, a<br>
memory (13) is needed for storing the partial value of the<br>
summation presented earlier. So, the operation carried out<br>
by the block (12) is as follows:<br><br><br>
Where the value E' (k) (18) is stored in the memory<br>
(13) once it has been calculated. Before calculating the<br>
value (18), the block (12) has to read the term (17)<br>
from the memory (13) . When the value of k is equal to N,<br>
which is a configurable parameter of the system and which<br>
can be different in the two possible estimation modes, the<br>
block (12) generates a signal (16) indicating that there is<br>
an estimation of noise power available. A signal (22) again<br>
indicates the estimation mode, blind or with known<br>
sequence, which will determine the number of samples N to<br>
accumulate. When the signal (16) so indicates, the memory<br>
is read and the value is divided by the corresponding value<br>
N.<br>
The estimation mode with known sequence is more<br>
reliable than the blind mode, though it has the drawback of<br>
not permitting data to be sent to the receivers. Also, the<br>
SNR of the channel needs to be monitored so that the system<br>
can adapt the number of bits per symbol to use. Moreover,<br>
it is also necessary to detect sudden changes of channel<br>
and change the constellation as far as possible so that the<br>
minimum number of packets are lost. These considerations<br>
are much more important in a multiuser OFDM communications<br>
system where each symbol contains a lot of information. For<br>
this reason, both estimations are combined.<br>
Furthermore, the larger the value of Nr the smaller<br>
will be the variance of the estimation. But in a system<br>
like the . above, this value cannot be arbitrarily large,<br>
because each OFDM symbol can, depending on the number of<br>
carriers and on the bits with which each of them is being<br>
modulated, contain a large quantity of data. Therefore, an<br>
estimation with . known sequence implies sending N symbols without information (since the sequence is known, it does<br>
not contain information) and increasing the overhead, and<br>
an estimation in blind mode requires that the information<br><br>
sent by the emitter to the receiver should occupy more than<br>
N OFDM symbols, which is not always possible. So, in this<br>
example of embodiment, in blind mode N = 16 has been chosen<br>
and in known sequence N = 32.<br>
As an initial estimation, a estimation with known<br>
sequence is made. After that, new estimations with known<br>
sequence are made with a periodicity of seconds. Between<br>
these estimations, blind mode estimations can be made<br>
(depending on the data traffic), which are used for<br>
determining whether any sudden change of channel has taken<br>
place. In the event that the change of channel causes a<br>
significant worsening of the real SNR, an estimation will<br>
need to be made with known sequence in order to prevent the<br>
error from occurring in the blind estimation, described<br>
earlier.	<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A method of reducing the variance of the signal-to-noise rate estimated for a<br>
signal with amplitude differential phase-shift keying modulation , applicable to a two-<br>
way communication system of multiple sets of user equipment in which amplitude<br>
differential phase-shift keying modulation (ADPSK) is used, which requires a sending of<br>
a phase reference symbol prior to sending an information, and where an estimation is<br>
made of the signal- to- noise rate in order to use a modulation with a maximum number<br>
of bits per symbol, maintaining a bit error probability in reception within certain given<br>
margins; said method comprising:<br>
receiving a symbol with known modulation (bits per carrier);<br>
measuring an amplitude error using an amplitude detected by an amplitude<br>
detector, that is the detected amplitude, over the symbol received;<br>
measuring an error in the phase increment using a phase increment detected by a<br>
phase detector, that is the detected phase increment, over the symbol received;<br>
translocating the amplitude error and the error in the phase increment to a first<br>
ring of the constellation, as if the received symbol had been transmitted in that ring;<br>
calculating a noise power as the square of the modulus of the error vector, where<br>
said error vector is formed by the amplitude error and the error in the phase increment,<br>
where said noise-power is accumulated and averaged;<br>
estimating the signal-to-noise-rate with the noise-power previously calculated and<br>
the known power of the sent signal; and<br>
selecting the modulation with the maximum number of bits per symbol keeping<br>
probability error of bit in reception inside the given margins using the estimated signal-<br>
to-noise rate previously calculated; in order to calculate noise samples, reduce the<br>
variance of the values obtained and equalize said variance among optimum constellations<br>
of odd and even bits per symbol.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein an average of the square of the<br>
modulus of the noise samples is taken in order to estimate the average value of the noise<br>
power, the number of samples to average being a configurable value of the system.<br><br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the amplitude and phase increment<br>
are detected in reception, and the detected amplitude and phase increment are selectively<br>
subtracted from a received amplitude and a received phase increment, respectively, or a<br>
received amplitude and a received phase increment are subtracted from the detected<br>
amplitude and the detected phase increment, respectively; in order to calculate the<br>
noise- power samples in blind mode.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a sequence of symbols known in<br>
reception is sent and selectively a received amplitude and a received phase increment are<br>
subtracted from the amplitude and the phase increment of the signals previously<br>
transmitted and known in reception, respectively, or the amplitude and phase increment<br>
of the signals previously transmitted and known in reception are subtracted from a<br>
received amplitude and a received phase increment, respectively; in order to calculate the<br>
amplitude and phase increment errors and, thereafter , the noise-power samples.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in claims 2, 3, and 4, wherein in the estimation of the<br>
signal- to- noise rate in reception, estimations in blind mode are combined with<br>
estimations with known sequence of symbols, in order to improve the estimation.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the samples of the noise- power to<br>
average belong to different constellations.<br>
7.	The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the bias of the estimators, due to the<br>
differential character of the modulation and to the different value in each constellation, is<br>
corrected independently in each of the noise-power samples being averaged, multiplying<br>
each sample by a correction factor, where this correction factor, which is unique to each<br>
sample, is the inverse function of the bias of the estimator.<br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br>
METHOD OF REDUCING THE VARIANCE OF THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATE<br>
ESTIMATED FOR A SIGNAL WITH AMPLITUDE DIFFERENTIAL PHASE-<br>
SHIFT KEYING MODULATION.<br>
This method reduces the variance of the estimation of<br>
the signal-to-noise rate in a multiuser digital<br>
communications system. These communications require a<br>
sending of a phase reference symbol prior to sending a<br>
information, where the estimation is made of the signal-to-<br>
noise rate in order to use a modulation with a maximum<br>
number of bits per symbol, maintaining a bit error<br>
probability in reception within certain given margins. The<br>
method minimizes and equalizes the variance of the samples<br>
obtained for the different values, even and odd of bits per<br>
carrier, which the system uses. The estimation is necessary<br>
for selecting the number of bits per carrier in order to be<br>
adapted to the channel and as back-up information in the<br>
event of using a receiver with diversity.<br><br></td>
