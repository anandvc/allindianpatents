				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to mobility management and,<br>
more particularly, to Network Address Translation (NAT) based mobility management<br>
of resources accessed by their respective network address.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Mobile Internet Protocol (IP) is a mobile-based standard for transmitting<br>
information via the Internet; see "Mobile IP Network Access Identifier Extension for<br>
IPv4", September 2000, at http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2794.html. One problem with<br>
mobile IP is that it requires an address such as a mobile care-of-address for a mobile<br>
resource to be reachable globally. This is difficult because most networks make use<br>
of Network Address Translation (NAT) that assigns an IP address for the use of<br>
multiple mobile devices that typically communicate through a single access point, that<br>
corresponds to the given IP address. Another problem with mobile IP is that the<br>
protocol overhead is high, especially for small packets, because mobile IP uses<br>
tunneling procedures to communicate data. Common tunneling techniques include,<br>
for example, IP-in-IP or IP-in-User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-in-IP.<br>
[0003] With respect to the first problem described above, the use of UDP has<br>
been suggested as a work around of NAT, i.e. tunneling IP packets from a home<br>
agent using UDP packets. That is, a Mobile Terminal (MT) first registers with its<br>
home agent using UDP, creating a mapping in a corresponding foreign network NAT<br>
server. This approach requires a significant amount of protocol overhead to operate.<br>
Also, the MT has to keep the UDP mapping alive at the foreign NAT server by<br>
constantly sending registration messages to the home agent of the MT.<br>
[0004] Accordingly, it would be desirable and highly advantageous to have a<br>
method and system for mobility management that overcomes the above-described<br>
problems of the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] A method and an apparatus are disclosed for supporting a mobile host<br>
in a communication structure having a NAT server and a home agent. The NAT<br>
server corresponds to a foreign network with respect to the mobile host and the home<br>
agent. In a data packet for the mobile host, the home agent translates at least one of<br>
an Internet protocol compliant address on the mobile host and a port on the mobile<br>
host to a global address on the NAT server and a port on the NAT server,<br>
respectively. The data packet is sent from the home agent to the NAT server to<br>
modify at least one address (global) on the NAT server and a port on the NAT server,<br>
so that the data packet can be routed to the mobile host.<br>
[0006] These and other aspects, features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of preferred<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] The present invention is directed to a method and system for Network<br>
Address Translation (NAT) based management for IP based mobile devices. NAT<br>
servers are utilized for addressing the problem with IPv4 address space shortage, as<br>
there is a limit to the total number of unique IPv4 based addresses. This limitation<br>
also creates many problems for various Internet protocols. The present invention<br>
takes advantage of the existing NAT based architectures by using NAT for Internet<br>
based mobility support, in contrast to working around NAT.<br>
[0012] It is to be understood that the present invention may be implemented in<br>
various forms of hardware, software, firmware, special purpose processors, or a<br>
combination thereof. Preferably, the present invention is implemented as a<br>
combination of hardware and software. Moreover, the software is preferably<br>
implemented as an application program tangibly embodied on a program storage<br>
device. The application program may be uploaded to, and executed by, a machine<br>
comprising any suitable architecture. Preferably, the machine is implemented on a<br>
computer platform having hardware such as one or more central processing units<br>
(CPU), a random access memory (RAM), and input/output (I/O) interface(s). The<br>
computer platform also includes an operating system and microinstruction code. The<br>
various processes and functions described herein may either be part of the<br>
microinstruction code or part of the application program (or a combination thereof)<br>
that is executed via the operating system. In addition, various other peripheral<br>
devices may be connected to the computer platform such as an additional data<br>
storage device and a printing device.<br>
[0013] It is to be further understood that, because some of the constituent<br>
system components and method steps depicted in the accompanying Figures are<br>
preferably implemented in software, the actual connections between the system<br>
components (or the process steps) may differ depending upon the manner in which<br>
the present invention is programmed. In accordance with the principles of the<br>
present invention, one of ordinary skill in the related art will be able to contemplate<br>
these and similar implementations or configurations of the present invention.<br>
[0014] FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a communication structure 100,<br>
according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The communication<br>
structure 100 includes a home agent 125, a mobile host 199, and a Network Address<br>
Translation (NAT) server 145 (also referred to herein as "parent NAT server" 145).<br>
Home agent 125 belongs to a first network 120 and NAT server 145 belongs to<br>
foreign network 140. Foreign network 140 further includes sub-network 190 that, in<br>
turn, includes sub-network NAT server 195 (also referred to herein as "child NAT<br>
server" 195), the latter being described in further detail with respect to FIG. 4 below.<br>
[0015] Home agent 125, mobile host 199, NAT server 145, and sub-network<br>
NAT server 195 each include both transmitter 181 and receiver 182, in this<br>
embodiment of the invention. It is to be appreciated that the elements of<br>
communication structure 100 are not limited to the preceding communication devices<br>
and, thus, any type of communication device may be employed with the present<br>
invention while maintaining the spirit and scope thereof. Home agent 125, NAT<br>
server 145, and sub-network NAT server 195 each include translator 183. NAT<br>
server 145 and sub-network NAT server 195 each include map generator 184.<br>
[0016] Mobile host 199 may be, but is not limited to, mobile phones, personal<br>
digital assistants (PDA's), laptop computers, or any type of device utilizing a wireless<br>
interface to communicate information. It is to be appreciated the mobile host 199<br>
may be any type of mobile device that is also capable of communicating via a wired<br>
connection As an example, the mobile device would remain stationary while<br>
connected to a network, complete its communications with that network, and then be<br>
carried to another location where the process of connection and disconnection are<br>
repeated to communicate with the same or a different network, i.e., a PDA capable of<br>
docking to a communications network.<br>
[0017] Home agent 125 may be any type of device found in a network that is<br>
capable of executing software. Thus, home agent 125 may be, but is not limited to, a<br>
server, computer, mobile device receiver, and the like.<br>
[0018] First network 120 and foreign network 140 may be any combination of<br>
networks including wireless networks (e.g., Wireless Local Area Network, third<br>
generation (3G) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), GSM based<br>
networks, GRPS based networks, wired networks as twisted pair, Ethernet, PSTN,<br>
and the like.<br>
[0019] While RF based signals 101 are shown as the medium of<br>
communication between first network 120 and foreign network 140, any type of<br>
communication medium or fabric may be used. A communication medium may also<br>
incorporate wired and wireless components between devices. The requirements of<br>
the communication medium are dependent on the type of networks and devices<br>
being networked. In the illustrative embodiment below, user registration messages,<br>
address translation messages, and user data messages are the types of messages<br>
exchanged between first network 120 and foreign network 140, in the form of data<br>
packets wirelessly. However, the present invention is not limited to only these types<br>
of messages and other types of messages utilizing other interface means (wired or<br>
wireless) may be employed in accordance with the present invention as readily<br>
determined by one of ordinary skill in the related art.<br>
[0020] The illustrative embodiment below references the use of ports. It is to<br>
be appreciated that any type of ports may be used to implement the present invention<br>
including, but not limited to ports used for applications such as, File Transfer Protocol<br>
(FTP), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP),<br>
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), User Datagram Protocol<br>
(UDP), and Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) where a client binds to a host<br>
via a port. It is to be further appreciated that any range of ports may be employed in<br>
accordance with the present invention. In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, any where from 1000 to 2000 ports may be used, each port to be used by<br>
a client for purposes of binding to a host, however, more or less ports may also be<br>
used depending on the needs of devices using the principles of this invention.<br>
[0021] It is to be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to<br>
communication architecture exactly as shown in FIG. 1 and, thus, other architectures<br>
as readily contemplated by one of ordinary skill in the related art may also be<br>
employed with the present invention. That is, given the teachings of the present<br>
invention provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the related art will contemplate<br>
these and various other variations and implementations of a communication structure<br>
for use with the present invention while maintaining the spirit and scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0022] It is to be appreciated that the phrases "mobile terminals" and "mobile<br>
hosts" are used interchangeably herein. Further, as used herein, "G" represents the<br>
global address reserved by the NAT server 145 for mobility handling, "H" represents<br>
the home address of the mobile host 199, and "P" and "P"' represent a port.<br>
[0023] NAT server 145 reserves one global address G for mobility handling.<br>
All mobile User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets and Transmission Control Protocol<br>
(TCP) packets are mapped using the global address G and different port numbers of<br>
NAT server 145.<br>
[0024] One problem faced in the prior art is the method of to mapping ongoing<br>
sessions for mobile host 199, since port numbers for communication are already<br>
fixed, which is contrary to the principles behind NAT. The key to solving this problem<br>
using home agent 125, since home agent 125 can perform an address translation,<br>
instead of using IP tunneling. To facilitate address translation by home agent 125,<br>
the open ports on mobile host 199 need to be known by NAT server 145. The open<br>
ports are mapped to ports on the outside interface of NAT server 145, whereby home<br>
agent 125 is notified of the mapped ports.<br>
[0025] FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for network address/port<br>
translation for supporting a mobile host in a wireless communication structure,<br>
according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The method of FIG.<br>
2 corresponds to the case when mobile host 199 moves into the foreign network 140,<br>
which employs NAT, and is directly reachable by NAT server 145 of foreign network<br>
140.<br>
[0026] Mobile host 199 sends a registration packet to home agent 125 (of<br>
mobile host 199), with the home address H of mobile host 199 as the source address<br>
(step 205). Besides the normal registration information, the registration packet also<br>
includes the currently opened ports P on mobile host 199.<br>
[0027] NAT server 145 in foreign network 140 intercepts the registration packet<br>
(step 210). For each opened port P in the registration packet, NAT server 145<br>
selects a mapping port P' on NAT server 145 such that (G, P') can uniquely identify<br>
(H, P) (step 215). NAT server 145 registers the mapping (G, P') -&gt; (H, P) (step 220),<br>
NAT server 145 then sends to home agent 125 the registration packet together with<br>
the global address G and all port mappings in the form of (P, P') (step 225). NAT<br>
server 145 also notes that the home address H of mobile host 199 has been<br>
registered.<br>
[0028] When a packet from an ongoing session for port P on mobile host 199<br>
is received by home agent 125 of mobile host 199, home agent 125 looks up the<br>
mapping table and changes the destination address/port pair in the packet from (H,<br>
P) to (G, P') (step 235). The packet is then routed to NAT server 145 in foreign<br>
network 140 according to the global address G (step 240). NAT server 145 checks<br>
its' mapping table, changes the destination address/port pair back to (H, P) and<br>
sends the packet to mobile host 199 (step 245).<br>
[0029] It is to be appreciated that FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 utilize some steps as<br>
shown in FIG. 2, corresponding to the process of mobile host registration. These<br>
steps are not reproduced in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, as to focus upon the unique aspects<br>
of the present invention shown respectively in each figure.<br>
[0030] FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for network address/port<br>
translation for supporting a mobile host in a wireless communication structure,<br>
according to yet another illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
method of FIG. 3 corresponds to the case when home agent 125 receives a packet<br>
for mobile host 199 in which the destination port does not have any mapping at home<br>
agent 125. This could happen when a new session is initiated by a corresponding<br>
host (CH) or mobile host 199 did not send out any currently opened ports during<br>
registration (e.g. for backward compatibility, mobile host 199 may be a regular mobile<br>
IP host), or the session is started in the foreign network. In such a case, home agent<br>
125 directly asks NAT server 145 in foreign network 140 to create a mapping (step<br>
410). Since home agent 125 only has the mobility address G on NAT server 145 in<br>
foreign network 140, creation of a mapping by NAT server 145 requires that a port for<br>
this purpose be reserved on global address G by NAT server 145; this port is denoted<br>
herein as port M.<br>
[0031] Thus, when home agent 125 receives a packet with a destination<br>
address (H, P2) and there is no port mapping for P2(step 405), home agent 125<br>
sends a request for mapping (H, P2) to global address G at port M of NAT server 145<br>
in the foreign network 140 (step 410). NAT server 145, upon receiving this request,<br>
creates a mapping (G, P2') -&gt; (H, P2) and sends the mapping (G, P2') -&gt; (H, P2) back<br>
to home agent 125 (step 415). Home agent 125 can then replace the destination<br>
address/port pair in the packets for mobile host 199 from (H, P2) to (G, P2') (step<br>
425). When NAT server 145 receives the packet, the destination address/port pair<br>
are translated back to (H, P2) (step 430) so that the packet can then be correctly<br>
routed to mobile host 199.<br>
[0032] FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for network address/port<br>
translation for supporting a mobile host in a wireless communication structure,<br>
according to a further illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The method<br>
of FIG. 4 corresponds to the case when mobile host 199 moves into foreign network<br>
140 (which employs NAT), however, NAT server 145 of foreign network 140 cannot<br>
directly reach mobile host 199. Mobile host 199 most likely will be directly attached<br>
to a sub-network 190 that is part of the network (here, foreign network 140) served by<br>
NAT server 145. One solution to this problem is to employ another hierarchy of NAT,<br>
i.e., sub-network 190 would also have a NAT server. In the example of FIG. 4, NAT<br>
server 145 of foreign network 140 can be considered to be the parent server (and is<br>
hereinafter interchangeably referred to with respect to the example of FIG. 4 as "NAT<br>
server" 145 or "parent NAT server" 145) while NAT server of sub-network 190 may be<br>
considered to be the child server (and is hereinafter referred to as "child NAT server<br>
195").<br>
[0033] Child NAT server 195 follows a similar procedure to that employed by<br>
parent NAT server 145 except child NAT server 195 communicates with parent NAT<br>
server 145 instead of home agent 125 of mobile host 199. Child NAT server 195 also<br>
maintains a mobility mapping address L that is local to child NAT server 195 (step<br>
505). When mobile host 199 sends registration packet to home agent 125 (step 510),<br>
child NAT server 195 intercepts the registration packet (step 515). Child NAT server<br>
195 maps the port P for each ongoing session in mobile host 199 to a unique port P'<br>
on the mapping address L (i.e., on child NAT server 195) (step 520). A mapping (L,<br>
P') - (H, P) is registered at child NAT server 195 (step 525). Child NAT server 195<br>
then forwards the registration packet to parent NAT server 145 together with L and all<br>
the port mapping in the form of (P, P') (step 530). Parent NAT server 145 again<br>
maps the ports to make them unique on the outside address G, i.e. for each port P'<br>
on address L, a mapping (P1, P") is generated (step 535). Parent NAT server 145<br>
registers the mapping (G, P") - (L, P'), and sends the registration packet, the global<br>
address G and the port mappings in the form of (P, P") to home agent 125 (step 545).<br>
[0034] When a packet from an ongoing session for port P on mobile host 199<br>
is received by home agent 125 of mobile host 199, home agent 125 checks its'<br>
mapping table and changes the destination address/port pair in the packet from (H,<br>
P) to (G, P") (step 550). The packet is then routed from home agent 125 to NAT<br>
server 145 in foreign network 140 according to global address G (step 555). NAT<br>
server 145 receives the packet, checks the mapping table, changes the destination<br>
address/port pair to (L, P') and sends the packet to child NAT server 195 (step 565).<br>
When child NAT server 195 receives the packet, the destination address/port pair is<br>
changed to (H, P) and forwarded to mobile host 199 (step 570).<br>
. [0035] For mobile sessions initiated inside foreign network 140, similar<br>
procedures apply. For sessions initiated by a CH for a MH inside foreign network<br>
140, a request from home agent 125 of mobile host 199 for a mapping will be<br>
forwarded to child NAT server 195 by parent NAT server 145. Child NAT server 195<br>
creates a mapping (L, P2') - (H, P2) and notifies parent NAT server 145 about the<br>
mapping. Parent NAT server 145 then creates a mapping (G, P2') -&gt; (L, P2') and<br>
sends the mapping (G, P2") - (H, P2) to home agent 125.<br>
