				<td>Object of the invention<br>
The aim of the present application is the registration of a toilet paper roll holder which incorporates notable innovations and advantages against other roll holders present in the market.<br>
More specifically, it refers to a toilet paper roll holder comprising a casing which includes means for supplying the toilet paper and means for supplying a liquid for dampening the paper, if desired, with water or any other liquid for personal hygiene or perfumed.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Currently, it is known in the state of the art a toilet paper roll holder for its use for either dry or wet paper which allows adding a liquid substance to the toilet paper. Said roll holder is described in the Spanish Utility Model n2 U 200102568.<br>
The Spanish Utility Model n2 U 200102568 discloses a roll holder which allows adding a liquid substance to the toilet paper. Such device comprises an open-type recipient to be filled with the liquid substance. However, the present application comprises a dosing element of the replaceable or rechargeable type, which is closed. As stated on the description of the present application, this means that the holder disclosed by U 200102568 is not very hygienic since the open-type recipient causes the liquid contained therein to get easily dirty with dust or germs, or even existing the<br>
possibility that children can access directly to the liquid.<br>
In the event of using an aromatic substance in the recipient object of the document U 200102568, it can easily evaporate in a short period of time.<br>
Furthermore, U 200102568 does not describe any stop means for blocking the revolving movement of the toilet paper roll as the present application, therefore the user has to block the paper roll directly with his/her hands since the paper roll revolves free around the support axis. That operation is clearly uncomfortable and unhygienic. The present invention is provided with stop means consisting of a device which is introduced between ribs of an axle for supporting the roll.<br>
US 6170426 describes an apparatus and method for producing wet and dry pads with an application mechanism that can be actuated to dispense fluid onto the tissue as the tissue passes through the tissue egress passage. Furthermore, US6170426 does not describe any stop means for blocking the revolving movement of the toilet paper roll as the present application.<br>
US 6613144 describes a pump-free dosing device for flowable media that can be fixed as a cover of a common withdrawing device for paper towels. Furthermore, US6613144 does not describe any stop means for blocking the revolving movement of the toilet paper roll as the present application.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The present invention has been developed with the aim of providing a toiled paper roll holder which solves the aforesaid mentioned disadvantages, also providing other additional advantages which will be evident in view of the description set out below.<br>
The toilet paper roll holder, of the type comprising a casing which includes means for supporting the toilet paper roll and means for supplying a liquid for dampening said paper, said means for supplying a liquid consisting essentially of a dosing element partially closed of a replaceable or rechargeable type which is snapped into the casing, is characterized in that the casing comprises stop means for blocking the resolving movement of the toilet paper roll, said stop means consisting of a device formed by a pin, which includes an elastic spring, which is introduced between ribs of an axle for supporting the roll.<br>
Thanks to these characteristics, an easy-to-manufacture roll holder is provided which includes a dosing element which provides a usually liquid aromatic or hygienic type substance over one of the surfaces of hygienic paper. Said dosing element is easily replaced when it is empty. Moreover, the dosed liquid or substance is hidden and protected from the outside, thus avoiding manipulation of said substance, unlike<br>
what it happens with the aforesaid described antecedents.<br>
The application of the dosed substance is quite' easy and hygienic, and it can be optional, that is, there is the possibility of choosing dry or wet paper according to the necessities of the user. Said application is carried out by manually pushing downwards the dosing element, the liquid substance flowing out, for example, through a plurality of small orifices which spread the liquid in the<br>
toilet paper and, once the unloading has been carried out, it returns to its initial position.<br>
The casing comprises stop means to prevent the toilet paper roll from revolving continuously and involuntarily, what would mean an unnecessary waste of paper.<br>
For their part, said means allow to choose the selected amount of wet or dry paper thanks to the braking, as it is only necessary a simple pushing of the dosing element and the subsequent cutting of the paper.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the roll holder comprises a housing located in the upper part that allows placing the dosing element. Said housing allows placing and removing the dosing element comprises a plurality of orifices for the distribution of the liquid on the paper. Thus, the liquid is distributed effectively over the paper pushing over the dosing element.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the casing comprises a hinged retractable lid located in the lower part of the housing for the dosing element which includes guide means for the path of the toilet paper. The presence of said lid is essential to prevent the contact or manipulation before use, being it indispensable to collect the remaining liquid, in the case it would exist.<br>
Advantageously, the casing includes a serrated portion to facilitate the cutting of the toilet paper, the sides of the paper being protected to prevent involuntary friction cuttings.<br>
Preferably, the casing of the roll holder has a<br>
folding lid in its upper part which facilitates the<br>
access to the paper roll and for the extraction of the<br>
dosing	element, said lid including a<br>
recess to facilitate its manipulation.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the toilet paper roll holder object of the present invention will become evident from the description of a preferred but non-exclusive embodiment, which is illustrated by way of non-limitative example in the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Figure 1.- Is a perspective view of a toilet paper roll holder of the present invention with a toilet paper roll placed therein and;<br>
Figure 2.- Is a section elevational side view of the casing of the roll holder represented in the previous figure, with the lid in lower position;<br>
Figure 3.- Is a perspective detail view of the lid of the roll holder;<br>
Figure 4.- Is a perspective view of the roll holder with the lid in a low position which shows the lower part of the housing of the dosing element.<br>
Description of a preferred embodiment<br>
As shown in figure 1, the toilet paper roll holder of the present invention comprises a casing (1) which is made up of two lower separated wings (2), (3) that support the axle (16) of the paper roll (4).<br>
The roll holder also has means for supplying a,<br>
for  example,  liquid  substance,  with  or  without<br>
perfuming, which consist essentially of a partially<br>
closed	dosing<br>
element (5) of replaceable or rechargeable-type which is snapped into the casing (1). The casing (1) comprises a housing (6) located on the upper part to house said dosing element (5).<br>
As it can be seen, the lower wings (2), (3) of the casing (1) comprise stop means, like brakes, to prevent the toilet roll paper (4) from revolving involuntarily.<br>
Said stop means of the roll holder of the present invention consist of a device made up of a pin (7) which includes an elastic spring (not represented) or similar element. The device also includes a pair of slots (15) in the roll (4) in which there are housed radial ribs (14) of the axle (16) of the roll holder.<br>
The pin (7) , once pushed, allows blocking the revolving movement of the roll (4) at one's discretion, being inserted between the ribs (14) of the axle (16) and preventing the roll (4) from revolving when the content of the liquid is applied over the paper or when it is pulled.<br>
Figure 2 shows the casing (1) comprising a hinged retractable lid (8) located on the upper part of the housing (6) open by its lower part and for the dosing element (5) . The lid (8) includes guide means (see figure 3) formed by a pair of longitudinal guides (9) which facilitate positioning the paper and prevents the contact and manipulation before using it. When the paper is over this lid (8) the content of the dosing element (5) is applied over it.<br>
The casing (1) includes in the front part a serrated portion (10) to facilitate the cutting of the toiled paper and with its sides protected.<br>
The lid (8) also includes a flange (12) in its front part which has a central recess to facilitate the manual extraction of the toilet paper.<br>
In figure 4 it can be seen a perspective view of the lid (8) open that shows the lower part of the dosing element (5), which has a plurality of orifices (13) for distributing the liquid or product contained in said dosing element (5) over the paper. The paper slides over the lid (8) before it goes out.<br>
On the other hand, the casing (1) has in its upper part (figure 2) a folding lid (11), whose angular movement has been represented by an arrow. As it can be seen in figure 1, the free end of the lid (8) does not<br>
reach the end of the casing (1), forming a free space of between 2 and 4 cm. approximately, so that the paper hangs slightly over the flange (12) and the grabbling of the toilet paper is facilitated.<br>
From what has been set out above, it may be deduced that the roll holder of the invention allows choosing between the use of dry or wet toilet paper in an easy and effective way. For supplying liquid to the paper, it is only necessary a simple pushing of the dosing element (5) , staying its content out of the reach of people and perfectly insulated from the outside, the body occupying much less space that the knows devices.<br>
The details, the shapes, the dimensions and other optional elements, as much as the materials used to make the toilet paper roll holder of the invention may be conveniently substituted by other technically equivalent and that do not go out of the essentiality of the invention nor the field defined by the claims which are included below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
