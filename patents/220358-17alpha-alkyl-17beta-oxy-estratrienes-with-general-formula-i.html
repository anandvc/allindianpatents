				<td>The present invention relates to 17α-alkyl-17ß-oxy-estratrienes with general       formula I.<br>
This application is a divisional application to Australian patent application No. 2002360949, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. The invention subject of this application is set out in the claims which follow, whilst the invention as originally described is set out in the description below.<br>
The invention subject of this application relates to  17α-alkyl-17ß-oxy-estratrienes, use of the  17α-alkyl-17ß-oxy-estratrienes for the production of pharmaceutical agents as well as pharmaceutical preparations that contain these compounds. The invention as described also relates to intermediate products for the production of the  17α-alkyl-17ß-oxy-estratrienes.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have antiestrogenic action, i.e., these substances exert inhibiting actions relative to estrogens. Such substances have already been described extensively.<br>
For example, compounds that have an antiestrogenic action are known from EP 0 138 504 Bl. These are then essentially estra-l,3,5(10)-triene derivatives, which are substituted in 3-position, i.a., with hydroxy or alkoxy, in 17ß-position with hydroxy, and in Hot-position, i.a., with hydrogen or alkyl. In 7a-position, these compounds also have an alkyl side chain that can be partially fluorinated and that can be interrupted by, i.a., amido, amino, amine-N-oxide, oxy, sulfanyl, sulfinyl and/or sulfonyl groups.<br>
In WO 99/33855 Al, llß-halogen-7α-substituted'estra-l,3,5(10)-trienes are described that can have hydroxy groups in 3-position and in 17-position. The 7α-side chain is a partially fluorinated, optionally unsaturated hydrocarbon chain that is interrupted by an amine-nitrogen atom or a sulfany, sulfinyl or sulfonyl group.<br><br>
Other compounds are described in WO 98/07740 Al. In this connection, these are substituted 7a-(£,-aminoalkyl)-estra-l,3,5(lO)-trienes. These compounds preferably have a hydroxy, methoxy or acetyloxy group in 3-position and preferably a methyl or trifluoromethyl group in 17<x-position and in lip-position a fluorine atom is preferably provided an alkyl side chain that at least partially fluorinated the terminal position interrupted by amine-n sulfanyl sulfinyl or sulfonyl group provided.></x-position>
In WO 97/45441 Al, 7a-(5-methylaminopentyl)-estra-l,3,5(10)-trienes are disclosed that have a hydroxy group in 3-position and in 17ji-position. In Hex-position, a methyl or ethinyl group can be provided. The estratriene skeleton can also be substituted in 2-position with a fluorine atom.<br>
It has turned out that the known compounds in the application form a variety of biologically very active metabolites. The formation of these metabolites results in undesirable actions and thus in an uncontrollable spectrum of action. In particular, side effects can be adjusted or the desired primary action (antiestrogenic action) is uncontrollable by spontaneous formation of these metabolites. In addition, the compatibility of the known compounds in the case of oral administration is unsatisfactory. It has turned out in particular that the known compounds promote the build-up of alveolar macrophages.<br>
The present invention seeks to find antiestrogenic compounds whose metabolism can be controlled and that therefore form little or no biologically active metabolites. In addition, it is desired that the compatibility of the compounds that are sought is satisfactory in the case of oral administration and in the case of their dispensing, i.a., alveolar macrophages do not build up or at least build up only to a small extent.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention as claimed provides novel 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-esiratrienes of formula I according to claim 1.<br>
The invention as claimed also provides the use of the 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratrienes for the production of pharmaceutical agents and provides pharmaceutical compositions that contain the compounds according to the invention.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided novel N-oxide 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratrienes of formula I, and novel 17p-oxy-estratrienes of the formula II as well as 1 7-oxo-estratrienes of the formula III, which can be used in each case as intermediate products for the production of 17a-alkyl-17(3-oxy-estratrienes according to the invention.<br>

As addition salts, in particular the hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, acetates, citrates, oxalates, tartrates and methanesulfonates are considered. If R3 and R17' are hydrogen, such that a 3,l?p-diol is present, the esters of these hydroxy compounds can also be formed. These esters are preferably formed with organic acids, whereby the same acids as for forming the addition salts are suitable, namely in<br>
•particular acetic acid, but also higher carboxylic acids, such as, e.g., propionic, butyric, isobutyric, valeric, isovaleric or pivalic acid.<br>
The novel 17a-alkyl-l 7p-oxy-estratrienes have several chiral centers, for example also on an N atom that is optionally oxidized to form N-oxide. There are therefore several stereoisomeric forms of each compound in each case. The compounds of formula I can be present as tautomers, stereoisomers or geometric isomers. The invention also comprises all<br>
*<br>
possible isomers such as E- and Z-isomers, S- and R-enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates and mixtures thereof including the tautomeric compounds. All of these isomeric compounds are - even if not expressly indicated in each case - components of this invention. The isomeric mixtures can be separated into enantiomers or E/Z-isomers according to commonly used methods, such as, for example, crystallization, chromatography or salt formation. Especially suitable compounds as defined by the invention are estratrienes with general formula 1, namely<br>

Physical properties of some of these compounds are indicated in Table 1.<br>
The 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratrienes according to the invention are distinguished from known compounds primarily in that a halogen atom is bonded in 1 la-position, and/or an alkyl radical is bonded in 17a-position. In addition, preferred compounds in the 7a-side chain can have an amine-N-oxide grouping.<br>
In contrast to 3,17p-dihydroxy-estratrienes, which are unsubstituted in 17a-position, virtually no metabolites are formed from the 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratrienes according to the invention. Metabolites can also be biologically active. It has namely been revealed that the estratriene derivatives that are produced by oxidation of the hydroxy group that is bonded in 17p-position, whereby a 17-oxo derivative is produced, have very strong biological activity.<br>
By blocking the 17tx-position by an alkyl radical, especially by a Cj- - C4-alkyl group, this oxidation reaction is stopped, such that a metabolic variety is also suppressed. The estratrienes according to the invention that are used as active ingredients therefore exhibit a species-independent effectiveness and activity. The advantage of these compounds therefore exists in that the full effectiveness of the active ingredient is achieved in a single compound.<br>
For this reason, advantages arise in the development of pharmaceutical agents, since owing to a lack of formation of biologically active metabolites, the effectiveness can more simply be ascribed to certain structural principles, such that a targeted search for active ingredients is made possible.<br>
In addition, the 17oc-alkyl- 17p-oxy-estratrienes according to the invention inhibit the action of estradiol to approximately 100%. They therefore represent antiestrogens.<br>
To study the effectiveness of the compounds according to the invention, in-vivo tests were performed on infant rats. To this end, the uterus growth was performed with peroral (p. o.) administration of the pharmaceutical agent (test on antiestrogenic action).<br>
The principle of this method consists in examining what influence the administration of compounds that have an antiestrogenic action has in the simultaneous administration of estrogens. In the case of rodents, the uterus reacts to the dispensing of estrogens namely with a weight increase (both by proliferation and by water retention). This growth can be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by simultaneous administration of compounds that have an antiestrogenic action.<br>
For the tests, infant female rats with a weight of 35-45 g at the beginning of the test were studied. Five to six animals were tested per dose. For the p.o. administration, the substances were dissolved in one portion of ethanol (E) and were filled out with nine portions of peanut oil (EO). For acclimation, the young rats just dropped by the mothers were delivered one day before the beginning of treatment and immediately supplied with food — right in the cage. The animals were then treated in combination with 0.5 ug of estradiolbenzoate (EB) once daily for three days. EB was always administered subcutarieously (s.c.), while the test substance was administered p.o. 24 hours after the last administration, the animals were weighed, killed, and the uteri were removed. The moist weights (less contents) were determined from the prepared uteri. The following control studies were performed: for a negative control, 0.2 ml of an E/EO mixture per animal and day was added. For a positive control study, 0.5 jag of EB/0.1 ml per animal and day was administered.<br>
From the relative organ weights (mg/100 g of body weight), the average values with standard deviation (X ± SD) as well as the significance of the differences in the control group (EB) in the Dunnett Test (p 
Test results for selected compounds are reproduced in Table 2. Test results for the uterus growth with simultaneous administration of 0.5 jag of EB/O, 1 ml s.c., as well as peroral dispensing of the compounds that have an antiestrogenic action in an amount in the range of 0.03 mg/kg of body weight and 0.3 mg/kg of body weight are reproduced there.<br>
It can be seen from Table 2 that the antiestrogenic action is nearly 100% when a dosage of about 0.3 mg/kg in the case of peroral administration was added.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are as effective as or even more effective than the corresponding compounds that are not substituted in 17a-position. Compared to the compounds that are not substituted in 1 Toe-position, the estratrienes according to the invention in addition have a better compatibility, such that the latter are to be preferred. The better compatibility can be attributed in particular to the fact that the formation of metabolites is largely limited.<br>
Determination of metabolic stability: in-vitro 17P-HSD test<br>
17P-HSD2 mediates the intestinal enzymatic dehydrogenization of an OH group in 17-position of the sterane skeleton into a ketone group.<br>
For this test, the following materials are used:<br>
Na-Phosphate buffer: 100 mmol of Na.2HPO4 x 2H2O and 100 mmol of NaH2PO4 xH2O<br>
Test substance solution of<br>
llp-Fluoro-7a-{5-|methyl(8,8,9,9,9-pentafluorononyl)amino]pentyl}-17a-methylestra-l,3,5(10)-triene-3,17p-diol (compound 1, as a representative of the compounds of general formula 1) and<br>
llp-Fluoro-7a-{5-[methyl(8,8,9,9,9-pentafluorononyl)amino]pentyl-estra-1,3,5 (10)-triene-3,17p-diol (compound 2): 15 p.mol in MeOH (0.3 |_imol in the test batch).<br>
Cofactor solution: 2 ml of glucose-6-phosphate (160 mmol)/MgCl2 (80 mmol) mixture is added to 400 ul of a glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase solution, and then 15.6 mg of NADP and 13.4 mg of NAD are added.<br>
Microsome solution: intestinal microsomes (InVitroTechnologies; protein content: 24 mg/ml; CYP450 content: 0.058 nmol/mg of protein)<br>
In the water bath, it is thawed at 37°C (-60 seconds) and diluted with Na-phosphate buffer to a concentration of 5 mg/ml of protein.<br>
In each case, 170 ul/well of the buffer and 5 ul/well of the test substance solutions are introduced into the corresponding wells, whereby double values are applied for each measuring time (0, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 minutes).<br>
In each case, 250 ul of ice-cold MeOH is added to the 0-minute values. Then, 25 ul of microsome solution and 50 (4,1 of cofactor solution are added immediately to all wells. The samples of the 0-minute values are stored without incubation at —20°C for about 24 hours. The other samples are incubated in each case for 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 minutes at 37°C, and the dehydrogenation reaction is stopped after these times by the addition of 250 ul of ice-cold MeOH in each case. The samples are stored until measurement per LC/MS/MS at ~ -20°C is done for about 24 hours and centrifuged at 3000 rpm before analysis, whereby the supernatant is measured.<br>
The concentrations of the test substances measured per LC/MS/MS and the resulting 17 ketone product are reproduced in Figures 2a-2f.<br>
Compound 1 is metabolically stable in intestinal microsomes but not in liver microsomes, which indicates that different phase-1 reactions occur in both tissues. The putative product of the 17BHSD-reaction, llp-fluoro-7a-{5-[methyl(8,8,9,9,9-pentafluorononyl)amino]pentyl}-estra-l,3,5(10)-trien-3-ol-17-one, compound 3, does not occur in any of the tissues, however. In contrast to this, compound 2, which does not have any 17 methyl group, is degraded in intestinal microsomes, whereby the corresponding 17-<br>
iwione is produced. Consequently, the high metabolic stability of compound 1 can be explained by the blocking of the 176HSD reaction, which is completely stopped by a 17B-methyl group. It therefore has to be assumed from this that an alkyl group, for example a methyl group, or else an alkenyl or alkinyl group, for example an ethinyl group, in the vicinity of the 17-OH group, prevents the intestinal (in contrast to the hepatic) oxidation thereof to ketone, surprisingly enough, which should have the result of higher oral bioavailability.<br>
In addition, the compounds according to the invention are thus distinguished by an extraordinarily high bioavailability, such that high serum levels can be reached by the administration of the compounds according to the invention to the affected patients. In connection with the already mentioned high compatibility, a successful and reliable therapy can thus be performed since it is possible with the compounds according to the invention to set a serum level of the active compound that has a sufficient distance to the effect level of the corresponding compound. Effect level means the serum concentration of the active ingredient that is necessary at the least to achieve the desired effect in the respective indication.<br>
The 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratrienes with general formula I according to the invention are suitable in particular for the production of pharmaceutical agents. The invention therefore relates in addition to the pharmaceutical preparation that in addition to at least one 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratriene with general formula I, which has the substituents Hal, R3, R17, R17", U, V, W, X, Y, Z and E according to the definitions above, contains at least one pharmaceutically compatible vehicle.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations or compositions according to the invention are produced with commonly used solid or liquid vehicles or diluents and commonly used pharmaceutical and technical adjuvants according to the desired type of administration with a suitable dosage in a way that is known in the art. Preferred preparations consist of a dispensing form that is suitable for oral, enteral, or parenteral administration, for example i.p. (intraperitoneal), i.v. (intravenous), i.m. (intramuscular) or percutaneous administration. Such<br>
arfpensing forms are, for example, tablets, film tablets, coated tablets, pills, capsules, powders, creams, ointments, lotions, liquids, such as syrups, gels, injectable liquids, for example for i.p., i.v., i.m. or percutaneous injection, etc. In addition, depot forms, such as implantable preparations, as well as suppositories, are also suitable. In this case, depending on their type, the individual preparations release to the body the estratrienes according to the invention gradually or all at once in a short time.<br>
For oral administration, capsules, pills, tablets, coated tablets and liquids or other known oral forms for dispensing can be used as pharmaceutical preparations, hi this case, the pharmaceutical agents can be formulated in the way that they release the active ingredients either in a short time and pass on to the body or have a depot action, so that a longer-lasting, slow supply of active ingredients to the body is achieved. In addition to at least one estratriene, the dosage units can contain one or more pharmaceutically compatible vehicles, for example substances for adjusting the rheology of the pharmaceutical agent, surfactants, solubilizers, microcapsules, microparticles, granulates, diluents, binders, such as starches, sugar, sorbitol and gelatins, also fillers, such as silicic acid and talc, lubricants, dyes, perfumes and other substances.<br>
Corresponding tablets can be obtained, for example, by mixing active ingredient with known adjuvants, for example inert diluents such as dextrose, sugar, sorbitol, mannitol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, explosives such as com starch or alginic acid, binders such as starch or gelatin, lubricants such as carboxypolymethylene, carboxy methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate or polyvinyl acetate. The tablets can also consist of several layers.<br>
Coated tablets can be produced accordingly by coating cores that are produced analogously to the tablets with agents that are commonly used in coated tablet coatings, for example polyvinylpyrrolidone or shellac, gum arabic, talc, titanium oxide or sugar. In this case, the shell of the coated tablet can also consist of several layers, whereby the adjuvants that are mentioned above in the case of the tablets can be used.<br>
Capsules that contain active ingredients can be produced, for example, by the active ingredient being mixed with an inert vehicle such as lactose or sorbitol and encapsulated in gelatin capsules.<br>
The estratrienes according to the invention can also be formulated in the form of a solution that is intended for oral administration and that in addition to the active estratriene contains as components a pharmaceutically compatible oil and/or a pharmaceutically compatible lipophilic surfactant and/or a pharmaceutically compatible hydrophilic surfactant and/or a pharmaceutically compatible water-rniscible solvent.<br>
To achieve better bio-availability of the active ingredients according to the invention, the compounds can also be formulated as cyclodextrin clathrates. To this end, the compounds are reacted with a-, ft- or y-cyclodextrin or derivatives thereof.<br>
If creams, ointments, lotions and liquids that can be applied topically are to be used, the latter must be constituted so that the compounds according to the invention are fed to the body in adequate amounts. In these forms for dispensing, adjuvants are contained, for example substances for adjusting the rheology of pharmaceutical agents, surfactants, preservatives, solubilizers, diluents, substances for increasing the permeability of the estratrienes according to the invention through the skin, dyes, perfumes and skin protection agents, such as conditioners and moisturizers. Together with the compounds according to the invention, other active ingredients can also be contained in the pharmaceutical agent [Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der technischen Chemie [Ullmanris Encyclopedia of Technical Chemistry], Volume 4 (1953), pages 1-39; J. Pharm. Sci+ 52, 918 ff. (1963); issued by Czetsch-Lindenwald, Hilfsstoffe fur Pharmazie und angrenzende Gebiete [Adjuvants for Pharmaceutics and Related Fields]; Pharm. Ind., 2, 72 ff (1961); Dr. H. P. Fiedler, Lexikon der Hilfsstoffe fur Pharmazie, Kosmetik und angrenzende Gebiete [Dictionary of Adjuvants for Pharmaceutics, Cosmetics and Related Fields}, Cantor AG, Aulendorf/Wurtt., 1971].<br>
The substances according to the invention can also be used in suitable solutions, such as, for example, physiological common salt solution, as infusion or injection solutions. For parenteral administration, the active ingredients can be dissolved or suspended in a physiologically compatible diluent. As diluents, in particular oily solutions, such as, for<br>
4<br>
example, solutions in sesame oil, castor oil and cottonseed oil, are suitable. To increase solubility, solubilizers, such as, for example, benzyl benzoate or benzyl alcohol, can be added.<br>
To formulate an injectable preparation, any liquid vehicle can be used in which the compounds according to the invention are dissolved or emulsified. These liquids frequently also contain substances to regulate viscosity, surfactants, preservatives, solubilizers, diluents and other additives, with which the solution is set to isotonic. Other active ingredients can also be administered together with the estratrienes.<br>
The estratrienes according to the invention can also be applied in the form of a depot injection or an implant preparation, for example subcutaneously. Such preparations can be formulated in such a way that a delayed release of active ingredients is made possible. To this end, known techniques can be used, for example depots that dissolve or operate with a membrane. Implants can contain as inert materials, for example, biodegradable polymers or synthetic silicones, for example silicone gum. The estratrienes can also be incorporated in, for example, a patch, for percutaneous administration.<br>
It is also possible to incorporate the substances according to the invention in a transdermal system and thus to administer them transdermally.<br>
To achieve an improved transdermal skin flow that produces therapeutically effective blood levels, the compounds according to the invention can also be incorporated in transdermal systems analogously to what is described for other antiestrogens in WO 01/76608. These transdermal systems are distinguished by a special ratio of 2 penetration intensifies, in particular lauric acid and propylene glycol.<br>
The dosage of the substances of general formula I according to the invention is determined by the attending physician and depends on, i.a., the substance that is administered, the method of administration, the disease that is to be treated and the severity of the disease. The amount of the compounds to be administered fluctuates within a wide range and can cover any effective amount. Based on the condition to be treated and on the type of administration, the amount of administered compound can be 0.1-25 mg/kg of body weight, preferably 0.5-5 mg/kg of body weight, per day. In humans, this corresponds to a daily dose<br>
4<br>
of 5-1250 mg. The preferred daily dosage in humans is 50-200 mg. This applies in particular to tumor therapy. The dose can be given as a single dose to be administered once or divided into two or more daily doses.<br>
The compounds of general formula I represent, as already mentioned, compounds with very strong antiestrogenic action.<br>
The compounds are suitable for therapy of estrogen-dependent diseases, for example, breast cancer (second-line therapy of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer; for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer instead of tamoxifen), endometrial carcinoma, prostate hyperplasia, anovulatory infertility and melanoma.<br>
The compounds of general formula I can also be used as components in the products that are described in, i.a., EP 346 014 Bl, whereby said products contain an estrogen and a pure antiestrogen, namely for simultaneous, sequential or separate use for the selective estrogen therapy of perimenopausal or postmenopausal women.<br>
The compounds of general formula I can be used together with antigestagens (competitive progesterone antagonists) to treat hormone-dependent tumors (EP 310 542 A).<br>
Other indications in which the compounds of general formula I can be used is male hair loss, diffuse alopecia, an alopecia caused by chemotherapy as well as hirsutism (Hye-Sun Oh, and Robert C. Smart, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (93/1996) 12525-12530).<br>
In addition, the compounds of general formula I can be used for the production of medications for treating endometriosis.<br>
The compounds of general formula I can also be used for the production of pharmaceutical compositions for male and female birth control (male birth control: DE 195 10 862.0 A).<br>
The estratrienes according to the invention can be produced analogously to the known process:<br>
In Figure 1, a reaction diagram is reproduced, according to which the compounds according to the invention can be produced. In this diagram, the 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratrienes according to the invention are referred to with the term "17cc-methyl-amine" and "17a-methyl-amine-oxide." However, the compounds with the designation "17a-methyl" in 7a-position have a side chain without an amine grouping. The compounds that carry a hydroxy or alkoxy group in 17p-position, an alkyl group in 17a-position as well as a 7a-side chain with an amine grouping are referred to as "17a-methyl-amine." In a corresponding way, the compounds that are referred to as "Ha-methyl-amine-oxide" are the amine-N-oxides according to the invention of the previously referenced "17a-methyl-amine" compounds.<br>
If R3 # H, an etherification is performed with a reagent R3, in which X means a leaving group.<br>
Compounds that are referred to as "17(3-OH" are also estratrienes that have a hydroxy group or alkoxy group in 17p-position but have neither a 17a-alkyl grouping nor an amine grouping in the side chain in 7a-position. Compounds that are referred to as "17-keto" are estratrienes that carry an oxo group in 17-position but do not carry any amine grouping in the side chain in 7a-position. The other compounds that are referred to as "17p-OH-amine," "17-<br>
Tceto-amine," "17p-OH-amine-oxide" and "17-keto-amine-oxide" have corresponding substitution patterns.<br>
In principle, all cited compounds, starting from the 17-oxo compound, can be<br>
*<br>
produced. The production of the 17-oxo compounds is described by way of example in, for example, WO 99/33855 Al. Derivatives other than the compounds that are disclosed expressly in this document with the same substitution pattern can be produced analogously. In the same way, the estratrienes according to the invention can also be produced starting from the 17p-hydroxy compounds or the 17p-alkoxy compounds ("17P-OH"). The production of these derivatives is also indicated in, for example, WO 99/33855 Al. In the same way, the production of the 17p-hydroxy compounds or 17p-alkoxy compounds as well as the 17-oxo compounds with an amine grouping in the side chain in 7a-position is disclosed in this document. If the production of the starting compounds is not described, the starting compounds are known and commercially available, or the compounds are synthesized analogously to the described processes. Below, the production of a few precursors, intermediate products and products is described by way of example.<br>
In the production of the substances according to the invention, for example, the following processes are employed (see also, in this respect, EP 0138 504 Bl; WO 97/45441 Al; WO 98/07740 Al; WO 99/33855 Al):<br>
The 17a-alkyl~17p-oxy-estratrienes according to the invention can be produced starting from the corresponding 17p-oxy-estratrienes ("17P-OH"). The synthesis of these starting substances is also described in, for example, WO 97/45441 Al and WO 98/07740 Al. The side chain in la -position can be built up, for example, according to the procedure that is indicated in WO 98/07740 Al.<br>
Then, the 17p-hydroxy compound or the 17p-alkoxy compound that is produced can be oxidized with an amine grouping in the side chain in 7oc-position by oxidation to form the<br>
corresponding 17-oxo compound ("17-keto-amine"). To this end, commonly used oxidizing agents, for example chromium(VI) compounds (Jones oxidation), nitric acid, manganese dioxide, selenium dioxide and SOs in pyridine can be used. The ketones can also be produced by catalytic dehydrogenation with metallic copper, silver, copper chromate and zinc oxide at elevated temperature or by dehydrogenation with ketones, for example cyclohexanone, by Oppenauer oxidation. If the group reducing the side chain contains, for example, S or SO groups, the latter can optionally be selectively reduced again after an over-oxidation.<br>
In another process variant, the 17p-oxy-estratrienes without amine-purging in the la-side chain can be oxidized directly to the 17-oxo-estratrienes ("17-keto"), and the latter are then aminated in a known way in the 7a-side chain.<br>
Then, an alkyl group can be introduced in 17a-position. To this end, commonly used nucleophilic alkylating reagents can be used, for example Grignard reagents or alkyllithium compounds. In this reaction, the desired 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratrienes are produced ("17a-methyl," if a start is made from the corresponding 17p-hydroxy-estratrienes without an amine grouping in the side chain in 7oc-position ["17p-OH"], or "17a-methyl-amine," if a start is made from the corresponding 7-hydroxy-estra,trienes with an amine grouping in the side chain in 17a-position ["17p-OH-amine"]). In addition, the 17-oxo-estratrienes that are obtained as intermediate products can first be alkylated in a known way and then aminated in the 7a-side chain.<br>
If the amine-N-oxide compounds ("17p-OH-amine-oxide" or "17-keto-amine-oxide" or "17a-methyl-amine-oxide") are to be produced, the corresponding estratrienes are oxidized with an amine grouping in the 7ct-side chain ("17p-OH-amine" or "17-keto-amine" or "17oc-methyl-amine"), for example with hydrogen peroxide. In this reaction, the secondary OH group in 17p-position is not oxidized.<br>
In an alternative procedure for the production of the 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratrienes according to the invention, the previously-mentioned 17p-hydroxy-estratrienes with an amine grouping in the side chain in Tec-position ("17p-OH-amine") are also used as starting substances.<br>
The latter are first reacted to form the corresponding amine-N-oxide compounds ("17p-OH-amine-oxide"), whereby, as indicated above, commonly used oxidizing agents, for example, hydrogen peroxide, are used.<br>
Then, the formed amine-N-oxide compounds ("17p-OH-amine-oxide") can be oxidized to the corresponding ketone ("17-keto-amine-oxide"), whereby the same oxidizing agents, as indicated above, can be used.   In this case, the 17-oxo compounds with an amine-N-oxide grouping in the 7a-side chain are produced.<br>
For the production of the 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratrienes according to the invention, the keto group is in turn reacted according to the instructions above with suitable nucleophilic alkylating reagents. In this case, the 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratrienes with an amine-N-oxide grouping in the 7a-side chain ("17a-memyl-amine-oxide") are produced.<br>
For the production of the 17a-alkyl-17p-oxy-estratrienes according to the invention, i.a., intermediate products with the following general formula II are thus also formed, which also are the subjects of this invention:<br>
