A  METHOD  OF  MANUFACTURING ARTIFICIAL BONE  IMPLANT;<br>
TADPHALE KESHAV BALKRISHNA AN INDIAN NATIONAL OF BHAWANI BAUG, GAT NO. 16, ARVI, TALUKA HAVELI, DIST PUNE, 412 205, IN THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA, WITHIN THE UNION OF INDIA   AND  DR.   MODAK MILTND BATTATRAYA<br>
AN	INDIAN NATIONAL OF 1188<br>
SADASHIV PETH, GOPAL DHAM, LIMAYEWADI, PUNE 411 030, IN THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA, WITHIN THE UNION OF INDIA<br>
 THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE                                                                    MANNER    IN    WHICH    IT    IS   TO    BE <br>
    PERFOMED<br><br><br>
2<br>
Medicine and Surgery have evolved over the ages. Surgery and especially Orthopaedic surgery has developed by leaps and bounds-hand in hand with the progress, research and development in various other branches of science and engineering.<br>
Progress in Orthopaedic management fracture treatment and joint replacement is multidisciplinary approach. Other than Orthopaedic, knowledge of bio -engineering, instrument/ prosthetic designing is necessary to achieve a good implant or a prosthetic design.<br>
The past three decades have witnessed a number of changes in synthetic bio -material device -designs, surgical treatment and clinical longevities. Continuous improvement, change and evolution have been observed and are anticipated.<br>
In some situations this was achieved by the use of mechanically and chemically anisotropic fiber reinforced components, whereas in other cases metallic alloys were coated with bioactive ceramics based on calcium phosphate or glass ceramic systems.<br>
There are a number of materials, which have been used, in the human body for the past decades. As the search for the most ideal bio-material goes on, there are a number of factors, which are to be considered.<br>
Inertness in the human body would be the top priority consideration. Neither undergoing any change in the human body nor eliciting a foreign body response is the primary criteria towards development of a synthetic biomaterial.<br>
The other factors to be considered are, modulus of elasticity, tensile strength and elongation to fracture.<br><br>
3<br>
Electrochemical properties, especially for metallic systems, bio-chemical features (materials of highest possible strength, ductility, bio-degradation resistance and wear resistance) are considered for processing and development of implant.<br>
Finally the selection of a material includes the important considerations of availability, fabricability and cost.<br>
Some of the patents granted to date are sited below for the elaboration of the above.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,253,225: Okada, et al, describes process for producing biocompatible implants material.<br>
"A process for producing a biocompatible implant material which can be suitably shaped into variety of forms, A binder is added to a mixture of hydroxylapatite powder and calcium phosphate glass frit (5 wt.%), to thereby prepare a slurry, and the resultant slurry is granulated, to prepare spherical raw material granules. Separately, spherical polyisobutyl methacrylate particles are prepared, and the particles are dry-mixed with the above -prepared granules, to thereby obtain a powder mixture. The Powder mixture is compacted using a mold press, to thereby form a cuboid sample. The resultant compant is heated in a drier at 170. degree. C. for three hours, to thereby melt spherical polyisobutyl methacryylate particles. Thereafter, the compact is allowed to cool, to thereby bind the raw material granules together via the polyisobutyl methacrylate that solidifies after melting. After the compact is allowed to cool, the compact is subjected to shaping by use of a copy-machining machine and also to drilling. Thereafter, the compact is heated at a rate of 300.degree. C. hour, and fired at 1,250. degree. C. for three hours, to thereby produce a biocompatible implant material."<br><br>

General characteristics limitation of bio materials used are discussed below<br>
Synthetic origin biomaterials broadly categorized into:<br>
i) Metal:	alloys of iron, cobalt or titanium single element<br>
Compositions Titanium (Ti) or Zirconium (Zr) ii) Ceramics &amp; Carbons:      those based on Aluminium (AI203) or Zirconium<br>
oxide (Zro2)<br>
Calcium aluminates &amp; Phosphate glass &amp; glass<br>
Ceramics &amp; carbon silicon compounds,<br>
iii) Polymer	:    PMMA, GHMWPE, PTFE, PET, PDS, polyurethane,<br>
Polypropylene, poly sulfones<br>
iv) Composites	Metals, ceramics, carbons or polymers are bonded to<br>
one another to form new structures with specific<br>
properties that are different from the independent<br>
Components.<br><br>
8<br>
The limitations for use of the above for use as a biomaterials are given below 1.  METALS &amp; ALLOYS<br>
■	Stainless steel can"t be used for porous implants because of its susceptibility to crevice corrosion.<br>
■	Alloys passivated (oxidized) surface conditions provide increased resistance to biodegradation however a high incidence of breakdown of this surface layer is found.<br>
■	Biologic aspects: Metallic ion release and tissue responses can be categorized into : I) local tissue reactions (toxicity)<br>
ii) allergy or hypersensitivity<br>
iii) carcinogenicity<br>
a small but significant portion of the population will react to Nickel or cobalt based alloys.<br>
CERAMICS<br>
Porosity : Which results from incomplete sintering has a deleterious affects on mechanical prospects.<br>
(Sintering is a process dependant on time &amp; temperature, which must be carefully controlled to prevent large grain size &amp; to achieve 100% density)<br>
Full density can be achieved through single crystal technology- however it has extremely high cost of production.<br>
Most ceramic materials are poly crystalline &amp; behave like metal in that very fine grain size produces high strength whereas large grain results in poor strength &amp; fatique resistance.<br><br><br>
9<br>
Problems of fracture with alumina -alumina head socket combination have been noted. Mechanical properties of alumina are quite sensitive to impurities (typically cao, Mgo, sio2)<br>
Hydroxylapetite and its composites are extremely costly. Overall processing is difficult and requires stringent specific manufacturing process.<br>
The present invention comprises of using fluoropolymer with suitable reinforcement. A layer of substantial thickness of fluoropolymer is used in final embodiment of the bone implant or prosthetic over the reinforcement member where ever required.<br>
PTFE, PCTFE, FEP, PFA, RULON constitute a group of fluoropolymers. They are available in Powder form. They are moulded by methods of compression and / or injection in a specially designed die or mould as per required specifications. Depending on the required features of the final product, PEFE, PCTFE, FEP, PFA, RULON™ or the like are reinforced by various materials like metals, carbon, etc and various additional ingredients are addedlike carbon, ceramics, and glass fibre. These moulded forms are ejected from the die and processed suitably, after which post machining is done to achieve required shape as per design.<br>
This reinforced PTFE, PCTFE, FEP, PFA, RULON have enhanced physical properties suitable for use for medical purpose such as joint surgery, instrumentatipn^ndiptal replacement of bone segment.<br>
These materials have tremendous, potential for custom-made implant and prosthetic, including any bone in Human and Veterinary.<br><br>
