However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are suitable, depending on the<br>
	concentration, for the total control of weeds, for example on industrial terrain and rail<br>
tracks, and on paths and areas with and without tree plantings. Similarly, the active<br>
compounds according to the invention can be employed for controlling weeds in<br>
perennial crops, for example forests, decorative tree plantings, orchards, vineyards,<br>
citrus groves, nut orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations,<br>
	rubber plantations, oil pahn plantations, cocoa plantations, soft Suit plantings and<br>
hop fields, on lawns, turf and pastureland, and for the selective control of weeds in annual crops.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have strong herbicidal<br>
	activity and a broad activity spectrum when used on the soil or on above-ground<br>
parts of plants. To a certain extent, they are also suitable for the selective control of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds in monocotyledonous and dicotyle¬donous crops, both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method.<br>
	At certain concentrations or application rates, the active compounds according to the<br>
invention can also be employed for controlling animal pests and fungal or bacterial plant diseases. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
|	According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. Plants<br>
are to be understood here as meaning all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or<br>
	combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including plant<br>
cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders' certificates. Parts of<br><br>

plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and<br>
organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be<br>
mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds<br>
and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants and<br>
vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers,<br>
rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.	<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or            storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping,<br>
spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brashing-on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multi¬layer coating.<br>
The active compoimds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspo-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic substances impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is to say liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is to say emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents<br>
as auxiliary solvents. Liquid solvents which are mainly suitable are: aromatics, such<br>
as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene<br>
	chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example<br>
petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol,<br><br>
Le A 34 324-Foreign Coimtries<br><br>
and also their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethyl-formamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diato-maceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks, such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite and<br>
	synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material,<br>
such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as poly-oxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and<br>
	protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste<br>
liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers, such as carboxymethylcellulose, natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and poly-<br>
	vinyl acetate, and also natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and<br>
synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants, such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
	titanium oxide, Prussian blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo<br>
dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients, such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br><br>

The active compounds according to the invention can be applied both before and<br>
after emergence of the plants. They can also be incorporated into the soil before<br>
sowing.	<br>
The amount of active compound used can vary within a relatively wide range. It depends essentially on the nature of the desired effect. In general, the amoimts used are between 1 g and 10 kg of active compound per hectare of soil surface, preferably between 5 g and 5 kg per ha.<br>
The preparation and the use of the active compounds according to the invention is illustrated by the examples below.<br><br><br><br>

Preparation examples: Example 1<br>
A mixture of 1.3 g (3 mmol) of 2-[2,4-dichloro-3-[(3-methyl-2-oxo-tetrahydro-l(2H)-pyrimidinyl)-methyl]-benzoyl]-cyclohexane-l,3-dione, 1.0 g (7.5 mmol) of oxalyl chloride, 2 drops of N,N-dimethyl-formamide and 30 ml of methylene chloride is heated under reflux for 30 minutes and then concentrated under water pump vacuum. The residue is taken up in 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran and admixed with 0.33 g (3 mmol) of thiophenol. With ice-cooling, 0.50 g (4.5 mmol) of triethylamine is then added dropwise. The ice-cooling is removed, and the mixture is then stirred at room temperature for 2 hours and subsequently concentrated under water pump vacuum. The residue is taken up in methylene chloride, washed once each with IN hydrochloric acid, water and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under water pump vacuum, the residue is digested with diethyl ether and the resulting crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction.<br>
This gives 0.91 g (61% of theory) of l-[2,6-dichloro-3-[(6-oxo-2-phenylthio-l-<br>
	cyclohexen-1 -yl)-carbonyl]-benzyl]-3-methyl-tetrahydro-2( 1 H)-pyrimidinone   of<br>
