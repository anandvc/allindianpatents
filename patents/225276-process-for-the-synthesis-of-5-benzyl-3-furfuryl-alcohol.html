				<td>PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF 5-BENZYL-3-FURFURYL ALCOHOL <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns a synthesis process of 5-benzyl-3-furfuryl alcohol.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Synthesis processes of 5-benzyl-3-furfuryl alcohol are well known to the art, an<br>
intermediate through the synthesis of the pyrethroid type of insecticide known by<br>
its commercial name of Resmethrin and described, for instance, in GB 1,168,797.<br>
For instance the patent US 3,466,304 claims the synthesis of 5-benzyl-3-furfuryl<br>
alcohol through condensation of Claisen of benzylcyanide and dialkylsuccinate,<br>
consequent hydrolysis, esterification, protection of the ketone group, formyiation,<br>
cyclization to 5-benzyl-3- furfuryl ester and subsequent reduction to alcohol with<br>
lithium aluminium hydride.<br>
The process is particularly laborious, it requires anhydrous solvents and uses<br>
Lithium aluminium hydride the handling of which requires numerous precautions.<br>
The patent EP 187 345 claims a procedure for the synthesis of substituted furanes<br>
by substituted isoxazolidine obtained from isobutylene diacetate and the<br>
appropriate aldoxime. The process envisages, therefore, the use of isobutylene<br>
diacetates, obtained from dichloroisobutylenes, or of dihydroxy isobutylenes which<br>
are difficult to prepare and find (DE 3,243,543 and DE 3,415,336).<br>
The patent SU 1768601 claims the synthesis of 5-benzyl-3-furfuryl alcohol through<br>
reduction of the corresponding ester with Lithium aluminium hydride. The furane<br>
ester is obtained through the condensation of 2-benzylfurane with an alkyl ester of<br>
propiolic acid at 200- 250°C in autoclave.<br>
The conditions described by way of example are demanding or as such to be<br>
hardly exploited in industrial-scale plants.<br>
The need was therefore felt to realize new ways of synthesis with reactions<br>
characterized by high yields, easily to be scaled up to industrial size, with<br>
intermediates of high degree of purity, by using reagents commercially available.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
A new synthesis process of 5-benzyl-3-furfuryl alcohol has now been found which<br>
is able to overcome the drawbacks typical of the processes known to the art<br>
The Applicant has unexpectedly and surprisingly found a new synthesis process of<br>
5-benzyl-3-furfuryl alcohol comprising:<br>
a. Condensation of the alky) a-(hydroxymethyl) acrylate, obtained through a<br>
Witting-Homer type reaction of a alkyl phosphonate with formaldehyde, with<br>
phenyl acetaldehyde oxime in the presence of an aqueous solution of sodium<br>
hypochlorite to give 3-benzyl-5-hydroxymethyl-5-carboxyalkyl isoxazoline.<br>
b. Reduction of the 3-benzyl-5-hydroxymethyl-5-carboxyalkyl isoxazoline with<br>
sodium borohydride or with sodium dihydro-bis- (2-methoxyethoxy) aluminium<br>
hydride to give 3-benzyl-5,5-bis (hydroxymethyl) isoxazoline.<br>
c. Hydrogenation and consequent rearrangement of 3-benzyl-5,5-bis<br>
(hydroxymethyl) isoxazoline to give 3-benzyl-5-furfuryl alcohol.<br>
The process under discussion is characterized by few steps of easy industrial<br>
applicability and high yield, starting with reagents easily found on the market, of<br>
reasonable cost and safer to handle compared to the raw materials pointed out in<br>
the known art among which, in particular, the difficult to find and expensive<br>
dichloro or dihydroxy isobutylene, (Organic Syntheses Vol.75, pages 89-97<br>
(1997)).<br>

Example 1: Synthesis of ethvl a-(hvdroxvmethyl) acrviate<br>
In a 11 capacity reactor are added 96 g (3.2 mol) of p-formaldehyde, 8 ml of<br>
orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4) 1N and 220 ml of H2O. It is heated to 90°C for 1h 30<br>
min. At the end, the solution is clear. It is cooled to room temperature and, under<br>
strong stirring, are added in order 60.86 g (0.27 mol) of triethylphosphonacetate,<br>
41.04 g (0.44 mol) of potassium carbonate in 40.56 ml of water. First 10 ml in 10<br>
min, then the rest in 40 min, maintaining the temperature under 35°C.<br>
Once the addition is completed, the solution is allowed to stir at 40oC for 5 min,<br>
then It is quickly cooled to room temperature while in sequence are added 200 ml<br>
of ethyl ether and 150 ml of brine (supersaturated solution of sodium chloride).<br>
The two phases are separated: the aqueous phase is retroextracted three times,<br>
each time with a volume of 150 ml, with ethyl ether, the organic phases are<br>
collected, and washed twice, each time with a volume of 150 ml, with brine and<br>
are dried with sodium sulphate.<br>
After evaporation of the solvent, 41.55 g of raw ethyl a (hydroxymethyl) acrylate<br>
are obtained, which, distilled (70-72oC/ 1mmHg). leads to 30.89 g of a colourless<br>
liquid product.<br>
Example 2: Synthesis of phenvlacetaldehvde oxime<br>
In a 11 flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, two dropping funnels and a<br>
thermometer, are added: 33.35 g (0.48 mol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride<br>
dissolved in 69 ml of a 1:2 ethanol/water mixture. Under stirring for 1 h, are<br>
simultaneously added dropwise, maintaining the temperature between 10-15°C:<br>
48.0g (0.4 mol) of phenylacetaldehyde dissolved in 56 ml of ethanol, 25.44 g (0.24<br>
mol) of sodium carbonate dissolved in 93 ml of water. The formation of a white<br>
precipitate is noted 5 min. after starting the addition.<br>
Once the addition is completed the temperature is increased up to room<br>
temperature and the solution is allowed to react for 15h. The precipitate obtained<br>
is filtered, washing several times with water. It is vacuum dried for 48h at room<br>
temperature.<br>
49.63 g of phenylacetaldehyde oxime are obtained as a white crystalline solid with<br>
a melting point of 84-86°C. 2.05 g of product are recovered from the mother<br>

ml of a sodium hypochlorite solution with an active chlorine titre of 10% (titrated<br>
before use) equivalent to 0.48 mol of NaOCI. The reaction is slightly exothermic: a<br>
temperature rise of about 5°C is noted; then the dropwise adition is interrupted<br>
until the temperature falls to -5°C. The reaction can be checked by gas-<br>
chromatography (GC). Once the addition of hypochlorite and oxine is completed,<br>
the solution is alowed to stir at room temperature for 2 hr. The two phases that<br>
formed are separated: the aqueous phase is retroextracted five times, each time<br>
with a volume of 150 ml, of methylene chloride. The organic phases are collected<br>
and are washed, first with 200 ml of water, and then twice, each time with a<br>

vacuum (24 mbar at 25°C). The residue is taken up with 150 ml of methylene<br>
chloride and the residue formed after evaporation is dissolved in a minimum<br>
quantity of water. The two phases obtained are separated and the aqueous one is<br>
retroextracted three times, each time with a volume of 100 ml, with methylene<br>
chloride. The organic phases are collected and dried with sodium sulphate. It is<br>
filtered and, after evaporation of the solvent, 59.85 g of a raw orange oil product<br>
