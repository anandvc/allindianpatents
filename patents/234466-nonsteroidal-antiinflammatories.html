NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORIES<br>
SCHERING AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company, of D-13342 Berlin T Germany.<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
WO 00/325B4<br><br>
PCT/EP99/09754<br><br>
Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents<br>
This invention relates to the use of nonsteroidal compounds for the production of pharmaceutical agents that have an antiinflammatory activity as well as the nonsteroidal compounds themselves.<br>
In addition to a large number of steroid compounds, which bind well to the glucocorticoid receptor and have an antiinflammatory action (glucocorticoids), nonsteroidal compounds are known that namely bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, for which to date no inflammatory suppression has been shown, however [cf. Nature Medicin 4 Â£1998} 92, Mol. Pharmacol, 52 (1997) 571]. In addition, nonsteroidal compounds were described that are derived from steroidal compounds, have an affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor and probably have an antiinflammatory action that is mediated by the receptor [J. Med. Chem, 36, 3278-3285],  In animal experiments, however, these compounds did not show any advantages relative to steroidal glucocorticoids, i.e., it was- not possible to separate the antiinflammatory action from the metabolic effects, e,g., suppression of the suprarenal function.<br>
Nonsteroidal compounds have now been found that bind well to the glucocorticoid receptor and, mediated by this bond, produce a suppression of inflammation.  In the animal experiment, these compounds show a clear dissociation between antiinflammatory and<br><br>
2<br>
metabolic actions and are therefore superior both to the previously described steroidal glucocorticoids and the nonsteroidal glucocorticoids,<br>
Compounds that are suitable according to this invention for the production of pharmaceutical agents that have an antiinflammatory action are the nonsteroidal compounds of general formula I<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2 are the same or different and stand for a hydrogen<br>
atom, a C;-C5 alkyl groupH or, together with the C-atom<br>
of the chain, stand for a ring with a total of 3-7-<br>

C1-C3 perfluoroalkoxy groups are the corresponding perfluorinated radicals of the C1-C5 alkoxy groups above.<br>
As C.-C5 alkyl groups for the etherification of hydroxy groups, the above-mentioned alkyl groups are suitable; primarily a methyl or ethyl group.  As a C1-C5 alkanoyl group for the esterification of hydroxy groups, a formyl, acetyl, propionyl, butyrylr iso-butyryl, valeryl or iso-valeryl or pivaloyl group is considered, preferably an acetyl group.<br>

If the compounds of general formula I (B = -CH2-) are present as salts, this can be, for example, in the form of hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, maleate, fumarate,   tartrate or benzoate.<br>
If the compounds according to the invention are present B.S racemic mixtures, they can be separated into the pure, optically active norms according to the methods of racemate separation that are familiar to one skilled in the art.  For example, the racemic mixtures can be separated into the pure isomers by  chromatography on a carrier material that is itself optically active (CHIRALPAK ADCBJ) .  It is also possible to esterify the free hydroxy group in a racemic compound oz general formula I with an optically active acid and to separate the diastereoisomer esters that are obtained by fractionated crystallization or by chromatography and to saponify the separated esters in each case  to form the optically pure isomers.  As an optically active acid, for example, mandelic acid, campfrorsulfonic acid or tartaric acid can be used.<br>
Preferred according to this invention are those compounds of general formula I, in which:<br>
R1 and R2 are the same or different and stand for a hydrogen<br>
atom, a methyl or ethyl group; also together with the<br>
C-atom of the chain, R1 and R? stand for a cyclopropyl<br>

All of the above-mentioned compounds are preferably used in the form of the optical antipodes or the separate diastereomers.-<br>
Nonsteroidal compounds as such with a mixed profile that consists of gestagenic and androgenic activity in different manifestations are already the subject of PCT Application PCT/EP3S/03242 that was filed on June 2,    1998 (priority;  Hay 30, 1991,   DE 197 23 722.3).  The compounds of general formula I that are to be used according to this patent application for the production of pharmaceutical agents with antiinflammatory action fall within the scope of the general formula that is contained in PCT Application PCT/EP98/03242.<br>
The compounds of general formula I that are cited by name below specifically fall within the scope of the general formula that is contained in the non-prepublished PCT Application PCT/EP98/03242, but are not previously described by name there. They are thus novel and also meet the patenting requirement of inventive activity because of the antiinflammatory action that is dissociated from metabolic effects and that was found for the first time in nonsteroidal compounds.  These compounds as such are therefore also part of the subject of this invention.<br>

Pharmacological Data<br>
In the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding test with use of cytosol preparations that consist of the thymus homogenates of rats and of [JH]-dexamethasone as  a reference substance, the<br>
compounds of formula I show a high to very high affinity to GR,<br>
In addition, in the gestagen receptor binding test, these compounds show affinities for the gestagen receptor with cytosol preparations from rabbit uterus homogenates and [3H]-progesterone being used as reference substances.<br>
In addition, in the mineral corticoid receptor (MR) binding test, these compounds show affinities for MR with cytosol preparations from rat hippocampi and [JHJ-aldosterone being used as reference substances.<br>
As an essential molecular mechanism for the antiinflammatory action of glucocorticoids, the inhibition of the transcription of cytokines, adhesion molecules, enzymes and other pro-inflammatory factors that are mediated by the GR can be seen. This inhibition is produced by an interaction of the GR with other transcription<br><br>
14<br>
factors, e.g., AP-1 and NF-kappa-B (for a survey, see Cato, A. C. B., and Wade, E.r   Bio2ssays 13, 371-378, 1996) .<br>
The compounds of general formula I according to the invention inhibit the secretion of the cytokine IL-B that is triggered by lipopolysaccharide [LPSJ in human monocyte cell line THP-l.  The concentration of the cytokines was determined in the supernatant with use of commercially available ELISA kits.<br>
The antiinflammatory actions of the compounds of general formula I were tested in the animal experiment by testing in the croton oil-induced inflammation in rats and mice.  In this .connection, croton oil in eth&amp;nolic solution was administered topically to the animals' ears.  The test substances were also administered topically or systemically simultaneously with or two hours before the croton oil.  After 16-24 hours, the ear weight was measured as a measurement for the inflammatory edema, the peroxidase activity was measured as a measurement for the invasions of granuloctyes, an&amp;  the elastase activity was measured as a measurement for the invasions of neutrophilic granuloctyes. In this test, the compounds of general formula I inhibit the three above-mentioned inflammation parameters both after topical administration and after systemic administration.<br>
One of the most frequent undesirable effects of a glucocorticoid therapy is the so-called "steroid diabetes" [cf, Hats, H. J., Glucocorticoide:  Immunologische Grundlagen, Pharmakologie und Therapierichtlinien [Glucocorticoids; Immunological Bases, Pharmacology and Therapy Guidelines], Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Stuttgart, 199S] .  The<br><br>
15<br>
reason for this is the stimulation of the gluconeogenesis in the liver by induction of the enzymes that are responsible for this effect and by free amino acids that develop from the degradation of proteins [catabolic action of glucocorticoids].  A key enzyme of the catabolic metabolism in the liver is the tyrosinamino transferase (TAT).  The activity of this enzyme can be determined photometrically from liver homogenates and represents a good measurement of the undesirable metabolic actions of the glucocorticoids.  To measure the TAT induction, the animals are sacrificed 8 hours after the test substances are administered, the livers are removed, and the TAT activity in the homogenate is measured.  In this test, at doses at which they have an antiinflammatory action, the compounds of general formula I induce little or no tyrosinamino transferase.<br>
Since the substances of the general formula also have a high affinity to the progesterone receptor, the new compounds were tested for their gestagenic action in the animal experiment.  For this purpose, the pregnancy-maintenance test was performed on ovariectomized rats.  In this respect, female rats are covered and undergo ovariectomy under anesthesia on day eight of the pregnancy two hours after substance administration.  On days S to 14 of the pregnancy, the animals are treated daily with the test substances, and on day 15, the animals are sacrificed, and the number of living and dead fetuses per animal is determined.  In the case of empty uteri, the number of implantation sites is determined by staining with 10% ammonium sulfide solution.  The new compounds of formula I resulted in little or no maintenance<br><br>
16<br>
of pregnancy up to a dose of 500 /ig per kg of body weight.  If the daily dose is increased to about 10 jmg per kg of body weight, a weakened gestagenic action can be observed.  Because of this .action, the substances cannot be used as gestagens with a typical spectrum of action.<br>
In summary, the new compounds of general formula I compared to the previously used steroidal glucocorticoids have the following properties:<br>
nonsteroidal structure (i.e., the substances are also effective in patients who, because of an allergic reaction to the steroid basic structures of conventional glucocorticoids, are no longer accessible to the latter for therapy [of. Lutz, M.E., el-Azhary R,A., Mayo Clin. Proc. 72, 1141-1144, 1997] approximately as good antiinflammatory action with less metabolic action<br>

The compounds of general formula I according to the invention inhibit the secretion of cytokine 1L-S in human monocyte cell line THP-l that is triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) .  The concentration of the cytokines was determined in the supernatant by  means of commercially available ELISA kits (cf. Welksr et al., Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol., 109, 110-115, 1996}. At a concentration of 1 ^M, the compounds show a maximum inhibition of cytokine secretion by 50-80%,<br>
The antiinflammatory actions of the compounds of general formula I were tested in the animal experiment by testing in the croton oil-induced inflammation in rats and mice (cf. Tubaro et al, Agents Actions, 17â 347-349, 1985) h  In this respect, croton oil in an ethanolic solution was administered topically to the ears in the animals.  The .test substances were also topically or systemically administered simultaneously or two hours before the croton oil.  After 16-24 hours, the ear weight was measured as a measurement for the inflammatory edema, the peroxidase activity was measured as a measurement for the invasions of granuloctyes,<br><br>
62<br>
and the elastase activity was measured as a measurement for the invasions of neutrophilic granuloctyes.  in this test, the compounds of general formula I inhibit the three above-mentioned inflammation parameters both after topical administration and after systemic administration.<br>
To measure the TAT induction, the animals are sacrificed 6 hours after the test substances are administered, the livers are removed, and the TAT activity in the homogenate is measured (of. Diamandstone et al. Anal. Biochemistry, 16, 395-401, 1966).  At a dose of 10-30 mg/kg of body weight, the compounds inhibited the ear inflammation by about 50-30% and induced in this dose range the tyros_inamino transferase in the liver of the animals by 1-4 times the starting value.  Since the substances of the general formula also have a high affinity to the progesterone receptor, the new compounds were tested for their gestagenic action in the animal experiment.  For this purpose, the pregnancy-maintenance test was performed on ovariectomized rats (cf. Neumann et al. Arzneim- Forsch. (Drug Res.), 34, 296-318, 1984).  In this respect, female rats are covered and undergo ovariectomy under anesthesia on day eight of the pregnancy two hours after substance administration.  On days 8-14 of the pregnancy, the animals are treated daily with the test substances, and on day 15, the animals are sacrificed, and the number, of living and dead fetuses per animal is determined.  In the case of empty uteri, the number of implantation sites is .determined by staining with 10% ammonium sulfide solution.  The new compounds of formula I resulted in little or no maintenance of pregnancy up to a dose of<br><br>
63<br>
