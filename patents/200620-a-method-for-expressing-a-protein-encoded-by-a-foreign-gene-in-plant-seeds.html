				<td>The present invention relates to a method for expressing a protein encoded by a foreign gene in plant seeds.<br>
Background Art<br>
Seed storage proteins are conventionally classified into four groups of proteins, according to their solubility, i.e., glutelin, globulin, prolamin, and albumin. Rice is different from other grains, such as wheat and maize, in that glutelin is the major seed storage protein, accounting for about 70 to 80% of the seed storage proteins. The glutelin gene group comprises about 10 genes per one haploid genome, and the genes are divided into two subfamilies, GluA and GluB, which show a homology of 60 to 65% at the amino acid sequence level within the coding region. Each subfamily comprises about 5 genes that have a homology of 80% or higher at the amino acid sequence level. A glutelin gene is specifically expressed and accumulated in the endosperm. The tissue specificity of glutelin expression is considerably strictly regulated, and glutelins are not expressed in other tissues, such as leaf and root. The expression of the glutelin gene group, with the exception of GluA-3, is generally coordinated; their mRNA levels show the following pattern: emerging 5 days after flowering (day 5) , reaching maximum at around day 15, and decreasing thereafter. The GluB-1 gene has the strongest promoter activity in the glutelin gene group.<br>
Rice mutants with decreased amount of accumulated glutelin, i.e., the major seed storage protein, have been isolated. For example, lida et al. isolated recessive mutants that lack either one of the acidic subunits of glutelin, al, a2 , or a3, from a rice breed Koshihikari that was irradiated with y-ray. The phenotypes are respectively regulated by a single recessive gene (i.e. , glul,<br>
glu2, or glu3) .  A mutant strain (al23) that lacks all of al, a2,<br><br>
and a3 has been also obtained by crossing the above three mutants (lida, S. et al., Theor. Appl. Genet. 94: 177-183 (1997)).<br>
LGC-1 (low gluteiin content-1) is a mutant selected from Nihonmasari treated with EMS, and has a phenotype with a significantly reduced level of glutelin (lida, S, et al., Theor. Appl. Genet. 87: 374-378 (1993)). LGC-1 is further characterized by increased levels of prolamin and globulin. LGC-1 is dominated by a single dominant gene. By mapping the defective genes in LGC-1<br>
and the mutants defective of al, a2 , and a3, it was revealed that the mutated protein gene (lgc-1) in LGC-1 and the mutated glutelin<br>
gene (glul) in the mutant lacking al are localized on the same locus. The results of Southern hybridization using the glutelin (GluB) gene as a probe suggested that LGC-1 contained a mutation in the GluB gene or in the proximity thereof. According to the results of Northern blot analysis, comparing the expression level of the GluB gene in the endosperm after about 16 days from head spout in LGC-1 and its original breed, Nihonmasari, it was revealed that GluB expression is markedly decreased in LGC-1.<br>
In soybean, glycinin is known as a seed storage protein. Glycinin is produced as a precursor polypeptide of a size of about 60kDa wherein a signal peptide, an acidic polypeptide, and a basic polypeptide are bound together; the signal peptide is cleaved afterwards. Thereafter, a subunit is formed wherein two kinds of polypeptides that result from a cleavage at the Asn-Gly site - i.e. , the specific acidic polypeptide (A) and basic polypeptide (B)- are polymerized through disulfide bonds. Six of these subunits are assembled to form a hexamer, and are stored in the protein body (PB) . The hexamer is also called 'IIS seed storage protein", due to its sedimentation coefficient (IIS) . Glycinin subunits are classified into group I and group II based on the primary structure of their cDNAs and their amino acid sequence homology. To date, subunits AlaBlb, AlbB2, and A2Bla of group I, and subunits A3B4, and A5A4B3 of group II are known. Six of these subunits are known to be almost randomly combined in soybean glycinin. Furthermore, a peptide derived from the AlaBlb subunit of soybean glycinin has been reported to have the ability to bind to bile acid (Shio Makino, The Food<br><br>
Industry 39 (24) : 77-87 (1996) ) , which suggests that the ability of soybean proteins to decrease the cholesterol level in blood is dependent on the AlaBlb subunit.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventors focused on the beneficial physiological functions of soybean glycinin, such as the cholesterol decreasing effect described above, and have already succeeded in generating rice wherein the storage protein composition in seeds has been altered by expressing the AlaBlb gene in the endosperm of the rice seeds (Patent No. 3030339). However, for a desired effect of physiological function to arise from eating the rice, higher levels of expression are necessary. Accordingly, techniques that enable accumulation of higher levels of foreign gene product in rice need to be developed and utilized. The present invention was conducted by taking such requirement into account, and its objective is to provide a method for accumulating high levels of foreign gene product in plant seeds.<br>
In order to achieve the above objective, the present inventors tried to improve the promoter for expressing high levels of a foreign gene in plant seeds. By examining the promoter region of the rice seed storage protein glutelin GluB-1 gene, conventional vectors used for expressing glycinin gene were revealed to incompletely contain the 5'-untranslated region of the glutelin gene. The present inventors focused on the 5 '-untranslated region of the glutelin gene, the importance of which has not yet been recognized, and examined the whether the insertion of the 5 '-untranslated region into expression vectors would improve the accumulation level of mRNA. The results showed no improvement in the expression level as compared to the conventional glycinin gene transductant associated with the insertion of an enhancer sequence of a tobacco photosynthesis gene between the GluB-1 gene promoter and the glycinin gene (AlaBlb) (pSaDb) . However, insertion of the complete 5'-untranslated region of the glutelin (ATG) dramatically increased the accumulation levels of both mRNA and protein.<br>
Previous studies never considered the maximal capacity of gene<br><br>
expression (transcription and translation) in expressing a foreign gene in plants. Therefore, introduction of a foreign gene was attempted only into plant varieties that were ordinarily used for experiments. The present inventors focused on the "maximal capacity" of plants, and presumed that foreign gene products might accumulate at higher levels when mutants defective in a particular protein were used. Accordingly, the inventors attempted to express and accumulate a foreign gene utilizing mutant plants.<br>
Several mutants that lack maj or storage protein, such as LGC-1<br>
and al23, are known for rice. The present inventors predicted that the amount of free amino acids available for protein translation<br>
in such seed storage protein defective mutants is larger than in normal plants, since the free amino acids are not utilized for the biosynthesis of the normally accumulated storage protein. Moreover, the present inventors considered that use of the glutelin promoter in LCG-1 might enable higher levels of foreign gene expression, since the glutelin gene expression is suppressed in LGC-1 and thus transcription factors that are originally used for the expression of glutelin may be utilized for the foreign gene expression.  Thus,<br>
the present inventors crossed LGC-1 or al23 with 11-5, a glycinin transductant, to introduce the glycinin gene into such mutant, and examined the levels of accumulated glycinin in their seeds. As a result, they found out that the amount of accumulated glycinin protein dramatically increased in both strains of LGCxll-5 and<br>
al23xll-5 as compared with 11-5.<br>
Thus, the present inventors succeeded in developing a vector that expresses high levels of a foreign gene in plant seeds by utilizing the 5'-untranslated region of a gene encoding a seed storage protein. They also succeeded in accumulating high levels of a foreign gene product in plant seeds by using a seed storage protein defective mutant as a target for gene transfer, and finally accomplished the present invention.<br>

The present invention provides a method for accumulating high levels of a foreign gene product in plant seeds. This method is characterized by the use of a mutant plant that is defective in endogenous seed storage protein as a target for expressing the foreign gene. Herein, the term "defective" not only comprises a complete deletion but also a partial deletion. In such plants, the amount of free amino acids that are available for protein translation is considered to be larger than in normal plants; this enables efficient accumulation of foreign gene translation product in seeds. There is no particular limitation on the defective seed storage protein in plants; the invention includes, for example, glutelin, globulin, prolamin, and albumin.<br>
Plants defective in these proteins may be selected from seeds<br>
of plants treated by irradiation, such as with y-ray, or with a mutation-inducing agent, such as EMS and MNU. Mutant plants may be selected by the seed bisection method. Specifically, a seed is cracked in two, and protein is extracted from the endosperm to select seeds with the desired phenotype. Progenies can be obtained from the embryos corresponding to the selected endosperm with the desired phenotype.<br>
Alternatively, plants with a reduced accumulation level of seed storage protein may be generated through co-suppression or the antisense method. For co-suppression, a. part of a gene encoding a seed storage protein to be decreased is modified and introduced into plants . In this way, the expressions of genes having a homology higher thab a certain value to the modified gene can be suppressed (for example, in the above-mentioned LGC-1 mutant, originated from plants irradiated with y-ray, co-suppression is suggested to have occurred, due to the mutation of the glutelin al subunit gene) . On the other hand, in the antisense method, a DNA encoding an antisense RNA that is complementary to the transcription product of a gene to be reduced is introduced into plants.<br>
According to the present invention, known mutants of rice that lack maj or storage protein, such as LGC-1 and al23, may be also used.<br><br>
Any gene suitable for expression in the seeds of plants maybe used as a foreign gene. For example, crops with high additional values, rich in nutrition, having excellent features for processing, and/or functioning to maintain and improve health by decreasing the level of blood cholesterol in human, can be produced using soybean glycinin as the foreign gene (Patent No. 3030339) . Alternatively, a vaccine gene for passive immune therapy, a modified glutelin gene wherein a physiologically active peptide is integrated into its variable region, or a useful enzyme gene can be introduced into rice to produce rice with high additional value.<br>
In order to express a foreign gene in plant seeds, a vector comprising the foreign gene operatively connected downstream of a promoter that ensures the expression in plant seeds may be favorably used. Herein, the phrase "operatively connected" means that the foreign gene and the promoter are connected so to express the foreign gene in response to the activation of the promoter.<br>
For example, for expression in rice seeds, the glutelin gene promoter (Takaiwa, F. etal. Plant Mol. Biol. 17: 875-885 (1991)) may be used as the foreign gene expression promoter. When expressed in bean plants, such as string bean, horse bean, and pea; or oilseed plants, such as peanut, sesame, rapeseed, cottonseed, sunflower, and safflower, the glycinin gene promoter or the promoter of a major storage protein gene of respective plants can be used. For example, the phaseolin gene promoter (Murai, N. etal.. Science 222: 476-482 (1983)) and the cruciferin gene promoter (Rodin, J. et al. , Plant Mol. Biol. 20: 559-563 (1992)) may be used for string bean and rapeseed, respectively. The above promoters are just given as examples, and promoters for constitutive expression, such as the 35S promoter, may be also used.<br>
It is preferable to insert a 5'-untranslated region of a gene<br>
encoding a seed storage protein between the promoter and the foreign<br>
gene within a vector for efficient accumulation of the foreign gene<br>
product in plant seeds. Examples of such a 5'-untranslated region<br>
include those of genes encoding glutelin (X54313, Oryza sativa<br>

Especially preferred are 5 '-untranslated regions in a complete form. In the present invention, chimeric 5'-untranslated regions derived from genes encoding two different seed storage proteins may be also used. The complete 5'-untranslated region of the GluB-1 gene is shown in SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
A vector wherein a 5'-untranslated region is inserted downstream of a promoter that ensures the expression in plant seeds and a vector wherein a foreign gene is further inserted may be constructed using gene manipulation technigues known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Considering the essence of the present invention, there is no limitation on plants to derive a plant cell for introducing a vector, so long as it is a seed plant. For example, the plants encompassed by the present invention include grains, such as rice, barley, triticum, rye, and maize; beans, such as stringbean, horse bean, and pea; and oilseed plants, such as peanut, sesame, rapeseed, cottonseed, sunflower, and safflower; and so on.<br>
"The forms of plant cell contemplated for introduction of a vector in the present invention include all Icinds of forms that can be regenerated into a plant. For example, the forms encompassed by the present invention include cultured cells, protoplast, shoot primordium, polyblasts, hairy roots, and callus, but are not limited thereto. Cells in a plant are also included in the plant cell of the present invention.<br>
Methods known to those skilled in the art may be used to introduce a vector into plant cells. For example, such methods include indirect transduction, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens or Agrobacterium   rhizogenes    (Hiei, Y. et al.. Plant J. 6: 271-282<br><br>
(1994) ; Takaiwa, F. et al. , Plant Sci. Ill: 39-49 (1995) ) ; and direct transduction, represented by the electroporation method (Tada, Y. et al. , Theor. Appl. Genet. 80: 475 (1990) ) , the polyethylene glycol method (Datta, S,K. et al. , Plant Mol. Biol. 20: 619-629 (1992)), and the particle bombardment method (Christou, P. et al. , Plant J. 2:275-281 (1992) ; Fromm, M.E., Bio/Technology 8 : 833-839 (1990)).<br>
Plants can be produced by regenerating a transformed plant cell. The method for regeneration may differ depending on the type of the plant. However, representative methods include the method of Fu j imura et al. (Fujimura, T. et al. , Plant Tissue Culture Lett. 2: 74 (1995)) , the method of Armstrong et al. (Armstrong, C.L. and Phillips R.L. , Crop Sci. 28: 3 63-369 (1988) ) , and the method of Radke etal. (Radke, S.E. etal., Theor. Appl. Genet. 75: 685-694 (1988)) for rice, maize, and rapeseed, respectively.<br>
In addition to the above methods, crossing may be used to introduce a foreign gene into a plant defective in endogenous seed storage protein. For example, first, a plant harboring the foreign gene within the genome is generated by introducing the above-mentioned vector. Then, the plant is crossed with a plant that is defective in endogenous seed storage protein to introduce a foreign gene into the endogenous seed storage protein defective plant.<br>
Once a transgenic plant, wherein a foreign gene is introduced into the genome, is obtained, progeny of the plant may be obtained by sexual reproduction. Alternatively, propagative materials (such as seeds, strain, callus, and protoplast) may be obtained from - the plant and progeny or clones thereof as the starting material to generate the plant in large quantities. The transgenic plants of the present invention can accumulate high levels of a foreign gene product in seeds by expressing the foreign gene. Accordingly, food value, the feature for process, health improving function, and such of a seed may be effectively modified depending on the characteristic of the foreign gene product selected for accumulation within the seed. Furthermore, pharmaceutical products and industrial materials may be efficiently manufactured by accumulating antibody or enzyme in seeds.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for expressing a protein encoded by a foreign gene in plant seeds, comprising the steps of: (1) introducing a foreign gene into a plant that is defective in endogenous seed storage protein, wherein the foreign gene is introduced (a) by using a vector that comprises the foreign gene operatively connected downstream of a promoter which ensures the expression of the foreign gene in plant seeds, or (b) by crossing with a plant that comprises said foreign gene; (2) expressing the foreign gene in the plant.<br><br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Herein below, the present invention will be specifically described using Examples, but it is not to be construed as being limited thereto.<br>

A gene was introduced into plants by the Agrobacterium method, and seeds (Tl) of the obtained plants were analyzed for the protein level. By comparing N, pSaDb, and ATG, it was revealed that the frequency of occurrence of plants accumulating high levels of glycinin is higher in the order of ATG &gt; N &gt; pSaDb (Fig. 2).<br>
Next, strains having the highest expression level were selected from each of the N and ATG transgenic strains that accumulated high levels of glycinin, and were self-fertilized to screen for a homozygote. Then, the levels of mRNA and protein in homozygotes were analyzed as follows. For RNA analysis, first, RNA was extracted by the SDS-phenol method. 12 immature seeds approximately 15 days after flowering were frozen with liquid nitrogen, and pounded in a mortar into fine powder. Buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1% SDS, 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) and phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) were mixed thereto, and total nucleic acid was extracted. The sample was centrifuged to recover the supernatant, and was extracted again with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Then the total nucleic acid was collected by ethanol precipitation, and redissolved in distilled water. Then, RNA was precipitated in 2M LiCl, and was recovered by centrifugation as the sample. The RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, and was transferred onto a nylon membrane.  The prepared membrane was hybridized with<br><br>
32P-labeled glycinin (AlaBlb) cDNA at 42 °C in 50% (v/v) formamide, 6x SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 5x Denhardt's solution. Then, the membrane was washed three times in 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS solution at room temperature, and once in 0.Ix SSC, 0.1% SDS solution at 55°C for 20 min. For protein analysis, total protein was extracted using 250 |il of extraction buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% (w/v) SDS, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) per 10 mg of mature seed. The extracted protein was treated at 100°C for 5 min, and then was subj ected to SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed using a 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide: N, N'-methylenebisacrylamide = 30: 0.8) .<br>
As a.result, the expression levels of AlaBlb in N and ATG were found to be 1.43 and 6.56 times, respectively, as much as that in 11-5 (Fig. 3) . According to a comparison of the protein accumulation level by separating the acidic subunits of glycinin by SDS-PAGE, the accumulation level of AlaBlb in N and ATG were 1.40 and 1. 62 times , respectively, as much as that in 11-5 (Fig. 3) . These results show that the insertion of a 5'-untranslated region, specifically the complete 5 '-untranslated region of the GluB-1 gene, between the GluB-1 gene promoter and a cDNA encoding glycinin (AlaBlb) is effective to improve the expression level of a foreign gene.<br>
[Example 2]  Development of a technique for accumulating foreign gene product at a high level using mutants<br>
11-5 (Momma, K. et al. , Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 63: 314-318 (1999) ) was crossed with either LGC-1 (lida, S. et al. , Theor.<br>
Appl. Genet. 87: 374-378 (1993)) or al23 (lida, S. et al. , Theor. Appl. Genet. 94: 177-183 (1997)), and their Fl seeds were collected. The seeds were cracked in two (the seed bisection method), and endosperm was used for protein extraction and analysis by SDS-PAGE. Based on the result of SDS-PAGE analysis, seeds showing an intense band corresponding to glycinin and a weak band for the acidic subunit of glutelin were selected. By repeating such selection, plants that are homogenous in all phenotypes were obtained.<br>
The endosperm protein in LGCxll-5 and al23xll-5 were analyzed<br><br>
by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). As a result, LGCxll-5 showed the phenotype of LGC-1 wherein the band for all 37 to 39 kDa acidic subunits of glutelin became weak (the total amount of glutelin was decreased to approximately one third) . In contrast, the band corresponding to the acidic subunit of the transgenic product glycinin was significantly thickened (1.4 fold) compared to the glycinin transductant 11-5. On the other hand, al23xll-5 were defective in glutelin acidic subunits al, a2 , or a3 , and showed the same phenotype as al23. In al23x 11-5, the band corresponding to the acidic subunits of the transgenic product glycinin was significantly thickened (1.7 fold) compared to the glycinin transductant 11-5. Next, the amount of accumulated transgenic product, glycinin AlaBlb, was quantified. Specifically, total proteins extracted from seeds were spotted on nitro cellulose membrane, and were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-glycinin (AlaBlb) antibody. As a result, the band of the acidic subunit of transgenic product glycinin was significantly thickened in seeds of plants that were crossed with LGC-1.  Furthermore, a similar result was obtained for<br>
those crossed with al23. These results revealed that the addition of the phenotype defective in seed storage protein to a line that accumulate foreign gene product in the endosperm of seeds enable accumulation of the foreign gene product at a high level.<br>
