COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
SECTION 10<br>
"A single electronic device for controlling an equipment &amp; method thereof<br>
Rajiv BHATNAGAR, 11, Golf Links, Pali Hill, Khar, Mumbai - 400 052, Maharashtra, India, an Indian national<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
1 5 JUL 2005<br><br>
The present invention relates to a controller designed for a wide range of applications from simple controls for appliances to complex controls for industrial applications. The controller utilizes distributed processing techniques to provide powerful capabilities at low cost.<br>
Background Art<br>
Electronic controllers are used to perform a variety of functions in various applications. Implementations range from "embedded" controllers in different types of equipment to "programmable logic controllers " used in sophisticated industrial control functions. The vast majority of these implementations are based on the use of microcontrollers. The microcontroller selected may be of any desired word-size, such as 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit depending on the requirements of the target application, but the basic structure remains the same. This microcontroller architecture defines a single processing unit that performs all the required functions - a "central processing unit (CPU) ". This CPU must therefore possess the capability to meet all the requirements of the application. This very often results in the use of a powerful CPU merely because one requirement out of the several that are needed demands significantly greater power. In these cases, the CPU remains underutilized for the bulk of the requirements while the solution is burdened with the additional cost of the powerful CPU.<br>
Some complex industrial applications use Distributed Control Systems (DCS) which distribute the control function over multiple controllers that are located physically apart. In these applications the intention is to provide the required control directly at the point of use. However, even in such systems, each controller in the system is implemented as CPU architecture and suffers from the drawbacks mentioned in the previous paragraph. As a result these systems<br>
2<br><br>
are expensive and are therefore used in large industrial applications that can justify the cost.<br>
Programmable Logic Controllers similarly provide flexibility in sizing central processing units, but remain single CPU implementations suffering from the same drawbacks.<br>
US Patent 6067612 describes a distributed processing type control system. The system involves a relaying system connected with sub-controllers located at physically separate locations through a communication channel. Each of the said controllers is a single processor system with memory. This invention does not address the issue of distributed processing within a single controller. As a result this solution also requires the use of an expensive processing unit at each location.<br>
US Patent 6035240 talks of a flexible, distributed processing system for sensor data acquisition. This invention also relates to a single central computer connected to multiple sensors at various physical locations through a communication channel. While this solution does address the problem of processing of the input signals by performing some processing at each sensor it does not cover similar requirements for other aspects of the system, such as driving of the loads. Furthermore, there is no concept of distributed processing within any single controller. The single central computer has to possess the capability of managing the control processing requirements of the entire system and is therefore expensive.<br>
US Patent 5975737 relates to multiple controllers located at physically separate locations and interconnected to form a distributed control system. Each controller comprises a single processing element and is connected to a remote<br>
3<br><br>
computer, which provides a user interface. The aspect relating to multiple processing within each controller is not addressed at all. As a consequence, each controller has to possess a central processing unit with the ability to handle the entire load of its function.<br>
US Patent 5909368 defines a process control system comprising multiple field devices such as Fieldbus and non-Fieldbus devices interconnected through a process control network. Each device implements a portion of the control strategy independently of and in parallel with the other devices. However, even in this case the invention relates to multiple physically separated controllers and not to a single controller. As a result this solution also requires the use of an expensive processing unit at each location.<br>
The object of the invention<br>
The object of this invention is to overcome the above drawbacks and provides a solution that is simple and cost-effective.<br>
The Summary of the Invention<br>
To achieve the said objective this invention provides a single electronic device for controlling an equipment or apparatus by performing predetermined or configurable control functions characterized in that it incorporates distributed processor means for providing improved efficiency of operation, comprising:<br>
multiple, simultaneously operating control means each of which is optimized for performing a subset of said control functions and facilitating means for enabling reduced delay in operation of said control means.<br>
4<br><br>
The said facilitating means is an optimal connection of signals for interconnecting said control means to each other and enabling the exchange of information between them.<br>
Each of said control means is an electronic circuit for optimally performing said subset of predefined or configurable control functions.<br>
At least one of said control means includes a mechanism for receiving signals from one or more external devices connected to its input.<br>
At least one of said control means includes a mechanism for communicating with one or more external devices for exchange of information relating to said subset of control functions.<br>
At least one of said control means includes a voltage measurement mechanism for monitoring power supply conditions.<br>
At least one of said control means includes a input / output mechanism for directly receiving inputs from the user of said device or equipment and/or directly providing outputs to said user.<br>

The instant invention further provides a method for efficiently controlling an equipment or apparatus using a single controller for performing predetermined or configurable control functions characterized in that it incorporates distributed processing for providing improved efficiency of operation, comprising the steps of:<br>
5<br><br>
partitioning the set of control functions into multiple subsets, providing individually optimized and simultaneously operating control elements for implementing each subset, implementing a facilitating mechanism for enabling the synergistic operation of all the control elements.<br>

The instant invention is explained with the example stated below:<br>
Fig.-9 shows the block diagram of one such controller connected on the network in an Industrial control system for controlling production equipment. Industrial<br>
11<br><br>
control system uses a number of sensors (9.1 to 9.5) and switches (9.6 to 9.9). Multiple sensors (9.1 to 9.5) located at various points in the equipment provide signals defining the value of various measured parameters such as temperature, pressure and level while the switches (9.6 to 9.9) provide signals defining the status of various elements such as doors and flaps, as well as the presence of objects such as parts to be processed. The signals from all these devices (9.1 to 9.9) are processed by Input Interface Processor (9.11) inside Equipment Controller (9.10) which performs signal conditioning, Analog-to-Digital conversion, Switch debouncing, Noise elimination and filtering.<br>
Central Control Processor (9.12) implements the required control software and Output Control Processor (9.13) implements the special drive software required to operate the various load devices (9.16 to 9.20) such as motors, solenoids and contactors, located at various points in the equipment. Network Interface Processor (9.14) simultaneously processes requests such as data and equipment status information received from other controllers connected to the network while User Interface Processor (9.15) independently provides services to the user operating the equipment. The aforesaid means are interconnected to each other through a facilitating means (9.21) comprising an optimal connection of interconnecting signals that enable efficient information exchange.<br>
WORKING:<br>
Signals from external devices, such as sensors (9.1 to 9.5) and switches (9.6 to 9.9), are received at the input of Input Control Processor (9.11) which performs signal conditioning and processing prior to supplying to one input of the Central Control Processor (9.12). At the same time, user supplied inputs through external devices such as keyboards are received at the input of User Interface Processor (9.15). The Input Control Processor (9.11) processes the inputs, performing operations such as switch debouncing, and provides the processed<br>
12<br><br>
signals to another input of the Central Control Processor (9.12). The Network Interface processor (9.14) also simultaneously monitors the communication channel and receives any requests that may be sent by an external device on the network, extracts the content of the request from the received data stream which typically contains framing information in accordance with the protocol being implemented on the network. Central Control Processor (9.12) processes the outputs from the Input Interface Processor (9.11), User Interface Processor (9.15) and Network Interface Processor (9.14) according to predefined control software and produces signals and the input of Output Control Processor (9.13). Output Control Processor (9.13) processes the signals from Central Control processor (9.12) and implements the required drive control software, such as PWM, Phase-control or Integral-cycle control and generate the necessary drive signals for driving the switching devices such as IGBTs/MOSFETs or TRIACs/SCRs. In this manner the equipment is controlled in accordance with the requirements.<br>
The aforesaid method is also described using a flowchart as shown in Fig. 10. The set of control functions are partitioned (10.1) into multiple subsets of data, which are individually optimized (10.2). The control elements are operating simultaneously for implementing each subset (10.3) and a facilitating mechanism is implemented for enabling the synergistic operation of all the control elements (10.4). Thus the device is controlled based upon these control functions using distributed processing for providing improved efficiency of operation.<br>
