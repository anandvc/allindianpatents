This  invention  relates  to  a  process  for  regenerating used  hydroprocessing  catalysts  having  contaminants comprising  carbonaceous  and/or  sulfur-containing materials  deposited  on  their  surface.<br>
A  number  of  catalytic  processes  are  used  in  the petroleum  and  petrochemical   industries  for  purposes  of treating  and  converting  process  streams  into  a  variety  of useful  products.     Among  the  refining  processes  utilizing catalysts  are  cracking,   hydrocracking,   hydrodesul-furization,   hydrodenitrification  and  reforming.     The catalysts  used  in  these  processes  decline  in  activity and/or  selectivity  during  the  course  of  use  as  a  result, in  major  part,   of  an  accumulation  of  carbonaceous materials  commonly  containing  hydrogen  and  sulfur  on  the surface  of  the  catalyst.<br>
Catalysts  deactivated  by  carbonaceous  materials deposition  can  be  regenerated  by  in-situ  carbon  burn-off in  a  controlled  oxidative  atmosphere  in  a  fixed  bed apparatus  or  a  fluidized  bed  apparatus.     For  example, U.S.   Patent  No.   4,007,131,   discusses  a  process   for regenerating  catalyst  from  hydroprocessing  operations  by passing  hot  inert  gas  containing  0.1-4.0  %  volume  oxygen through  the  catalyst  while  in-situ  in  the  reactor.     Such in-situ  regeneration,   however,   requires  shutdown  of  the reactor  for  the  time  period  needed  to  perform  the regeneration,   which  may  require  many  days.     In  addition, some  channelling  of  the  hot  gas  flow  in  the  catalyst  bed usually  occurs  and  results  in  undesired  variation  in  the degree  of  regeneration  obtained.     Thus,   more  effective external  catalyst  regeneration  processes  not  involving extensive  reactor  downtime  have  been  sought.     However,<br><br>
available  external  type  commercial   catalyst  regeneration processes  have  not  been  entirely  satisfactory  due  to  lack of  total  control  over  gas  temperatures,   oxidative atmospheres  and  physical  breakage.     Catalysts  regenerated by  these  processes  often  have  incomplete  recovery  of surface  area  and  pore  volume,   a  high  content  of  residual sulfur  and  carbon,   and  substantial   fines   losses.     This situation  arises  because  heat  is  necessary  to  remove contaminants,   yet  excessive  heat  causes  collapse  of  pore structure,   loss  of  surface  area  and  agglomeration  of metals.     Release  of  contaminants     from  deep  in  the catalyst  pores  often  requires  a  long  "heat  soak"  period in  order  to  achieve  high  removals.     Accomplishing  the conflicting  objectives  of  surface  area  retention,   which suggests  controlled  heat  for  a  short  time,   and  complete removal  of  carbon,   which  suggests  longer  heating  times, has  long  been  an  elusive  goal.     Thus,   it  would  be advantageous  to  have  a  catalyst  regeneration  process whereby  the  recovery  of  catalytic  and  physical  properties as  well  as  the  levels  of  contaminant  removal  are enhanced.<br>
It  has  now  been  found  that  a  process   for  regenerating catalysts  which  comprises  subjecting  a  spent  catalyst  to a  fluidized  bed  treatment  step  followed  by  a  moving  belt treatment  step  results  in  a  regenerated  catalyst  from which  the  contaminants  have  been  removed  and  the  physical properties  of  the  catalyst  have  been  substantially recovered  and/or  enhanced.<br>
The  present  invention,   accordingly,   relates  to  a process   for  regenerating  used  catalyst  particles contaminated  with  carbonaceous  and/or  sulfur-containing materials,   which  process  comprises  the  steps  of:<br>
a)     contacting  said  particles  in  a  fluidized  bed  with an  oxygen-containing  gas  at  an  elevated  temperature whereby  at  least  part  of  the  contaminants  is  removed,   and<br><br>
b)   passing  the  thus   treated  catalyst  particles  to  a moving  belt  and  causing  the  belt  to  move  said  catalyst particles  through  a  furnace   zone,   which  is  maintained  at a  temperature  sufficient  to  remove  the  remaining  portion of  the  contaminants   from  the  catalyst  particles.<br>
In  step   (a)   the  catalyst  particles  are  preferably contacted  with  the  oxygen-containing  gas   for  a  time  which does  not  exceed  twenty  minutes,   wherein  at  least  fifty percent  by  weight  of  the  sulfur  contaminants  are  removed. In  the  subsequent  step   (b),   the  catalyst  particles preferably  are  moved  through  the  furnace   zone  for  at least  two  hours.<br>
The  present  process  provides  a  process  in  which  a used  hydroprocessing  catalyst  deactivated  by contamination  with  carbonaceous  materials  and  sulfur-containing  compounds,   normally  by  deposition  of  such contaminants  on  the  surface  of  the  catalyst  particles  or by  plugging  of  the  catalyst  pores  by  such  contaminants, is  regenerated  by  a  two  step  process.     The  first  step  of the  regeneration  process  is  a  fluidized  bed  treatment, and  the  second  step  is  a  moving  belt  treatment.     A combination  of  these  steps  results  in  regenerated catalysts  which  show  low  attrition,   i.e.,   little  or  no reduction  in  size  of  the  particles.     In  some  cases, enhanced  surface  areas  can  also  be  seen.     In  addition,   in the  process  of  the  present  invention,   the  throughput  may be  doubled  and  the  end  result  is  a  much  more  optimal regeneration  process.<br>
The  regeneration  process  of  the  present  invention  is particularly  suitable  for  regenerating  hydroprocessing catalysts,   especially  hydrotreating  catalysts.     These catalysts   typically  comprise  Group  VIB,   VIIB,   VIII metals,   or  mixtures  of  two  or  more  of  these  metals supported  on  various  supports  such  as,   for  example, alumina,   silica,   silica-alumina,   aluminosilicates.<br><br>
zeolites,   and  the  like.        The  catalysts  typically  have  a cylindrical,   spherical  or  multi-lobe  shape,   a  diameter ranging  from  0.50  millimeters  to  3.5  milli-meters,   and  a length  between  1.5  millimeters  and  6.5  millimeters.<br>
The  first  step  of  the  regeneration  process  of  the present  invention  is  a  fluidized  bed  treatment.     Briefly, a  fluidized  bed  consists  of  a  mass  of  particles  contained in  a  chamber  through  which  a  gas   is  passed.     The particles  are  typically  heated  and  if  the  velocity  of  the gas  entering  the  chamber  is  properly  adjusted,   the particles  separate  and  move  about  in  a  random  manner  such that  the  entire  bed  behaves  like  a  liquid.<br>
In  the  present  invention,   the  spent  catalyst  is placed  in  a  fluidized  bed  apparatus  or  chamber  of  any suitable  construction  and  is  supported  on  a  bottom  plate or  other  suitable  device  having  a  plurality  of  ports designed  to  permit   flow  of  an  oxygen-containing  gas upwardly  and  to  prevent  the  catalyst  particles   from moving  downwardly  such  that  the  flow  of  gas  would  be restricted.     The  oxygen-containing  gas  is  normally introduced  into  the  chamber  prior  to  the  introduction  of material  to  be  treated.     The  oxygen  content  of  the  gas can  vary  in  the  range  of  from  4  percent  by  volume  to 100  percent  by  volume.     Preferably,   the  oxygen  component of  the  gas  stream  is   from  4   to  30  percent  by  volume,   and more  preferably  from  15  to  22  percent  by  volume.     A convenient  gas  stream  is  atmospheric  air,   although  pure oxygen  may  also  be  utilized.     After  the  oxygen-containing gas  is  passed  upwardly  through  the  ports  into  the  chamber and  contacted  with  the  spent  catalyst  particles,   the exhaust  gas  exits  the  chamber  and  suitably  is  subjected to  a  further  treatment,   such  as,   for  example,   it  may  be passed  to  equipment  downstream  for  discharge  by procedures  well   known  in  the  art.<br><br>
The  velocity  of  the  gas   stream  must  be  sufficiently high  for  the  catalyst  particles  to  remain  in  fluidized state  in  the  chamber.     The  minimum  velocity  is  that needed  to  overcome  the  gravitational  pull  on  the  catalyst particles.     The  velocity  may  not  be  so  high  that  catalyst particles  are  transported  out  of  the  chamber.     The oxygen-containing  gas  is  preferably  introduced  into  the chamber  at  a  superficial  velocity  in  the  range  of  from 12.2  meters  per  minute   (m/min)    (40   feet  per  minute (ft/min))   to   488  m/min   (1600   ft/min).<br>
Generally,   the  oxygen-containing  gas   is   introduced into  the  chamber  at  a  temperature  sufficient  to  initiate the  desired  reaction  in  the  column,   and  is  desirable  that the  temperature  of  the  gas  stream  in  the  chamber  be maintained  constant  at  the  temperature  it  was  introduced. Therefore,   the  temperature  of  the  gas  at  the  inlet  is adjusted  so  that  the  temperature  of  the  chamber  is maintained  at  the  desired  temperature,   i.e.,   a temperature   in  the  range  of   from  204  °C   (400  °F)   to 593  °C   (1100  °F) ,   preferably  from  399  °C   (750  °F)   to 538  °C   (1000  °F).     The  pressure  in  the  chamber  is typically  atmospheric  pressure.<br>
After  the  gaseous  atmosphere  has  been  established  at the  desired  temperature  and  velocity,   the  spent  catalyst materials  are  added  to  the  chamber.     The  residence  time of  the  catalyst  particles  in  the  fluidized  bed  apparatus or  chamber  is   suitably  from  1  minute  to  20  minutes, preferably  from  5  minutes  to  15  minutes.     These  residence times  at  the  temperatures  specified  above  suitably  result in  the  removal   from  the  spent  catalyst  of  at  least 50  percent  by  weight  of  the  sulfur  contaminants.     The first  step,   i.e.,   the  fluidized  bed  step,   of  the regeneration  process  also  suitably  results   in  the  removal of  from  5  percent  by  weight  to  40  percent  by  weight  of the  carbon  contaminants  and  from  25  percent  by  weight  to<br><br>
50  percent  by  weight  of  the  total  volatilities  present  on the  spent  catalyst.     Preferably,   at  least  55  percent  by weight  of  the  sulfur  contaminants,   and  from  10  percent  by weight  to  25  percent  by  weight  of  the  carbon contaminants,   and  from  30  percent  by  weight  to  40  percent by  weight  of  the  total  volatilities  present  on  the  spent catalyst  are  removed  during  the  fluidized  bed  treatment. As  one  skilled  in  the  art  would  readily  recognize,   the above-described  fluidized  bed  treatment  is  quite effective  for  removing  contaminants   from  used  or  spent catalysts,   but  the  constant  agitation  is  quite  abrasive and  thus  detrimental  to  the  integrity  of  the  catalysts. Thus,   if  the  catalysts  are  subjected  to  such  a  treatment for  prolonged  periods  of  time,   attrition  becomes  a significant  problem.     For  this  reason,   the  present invention  is  a  process  in  which  the  most  volatile  portion of  the  contaminants  are  removed  in  a  first  step  to control   the  exothermic,   i.e.,   a   fluidized  bed  treatment, and  the  remainder  of  the  contaminants  are  removed  in  a second  step,   i.e.,   a  moving  belt  treatment,   in  which there  is  a  minimal  amount  of  catalyst  particle  motion.<br>
Following  the  fluidized  bed  treatment,   the  spent  or used  catalyst   is  subjected  to  a  moving  belt  treatment. In  this  second  step  of  the  regeneration  process  of  the present  invention,   catalyst  particles  are  withdrawn  from the  fluidized  bed  apparatus  or  chamber  and  transferred  to a  continuous  belt  driven  by  mechanical  means  such  as,   for example,   a  motor  and  which  moves  through  a  furnace   zone.<br>
The  furnace  zone  may  comprise  a  single  furnace  com¬prising  one  or  more  heating  zones,   but  may  also  comprise two  or  more  distinct   furnaces  as  will  be  discussed  in more  detail  hereinafter.     The  belt  is  advantageously constructed  of  wire  mesh,   suitably  made  of  stainless steel,   but  any  other  known  material  capable  of  being  used as  a  moving  belt  resistant  to  high  temperatures  could<br><br>
also  be  used.   The  belt  moves   in  a  horizontal  direction through  a   furnace   zone  such  that  the  catalyst  particles are  subjected  to  only  a  minimal  amount  of  agitation.   The catalyst  particles  will  normally  be  placed  onto  the  belt in  the   form  of  a  layer  or  bed,   although  this  is  not strictly  required.   Such  bed  suitably  has  a  thickness  of 0.64   cm   {H  of  an  inch)   to   6.4  cm   {2’  inches),   preferably from  1.9  cm   (3/4   inch)   to  3.8   {1’  inches).     As  the  bed containing  the  catalyst  particles   is  in  motion  through the   furnace  zone,   hot  air,   either  in  the  presence  or absence  of  combustion  gases   is  passed  through  the  wire mesh  belt.     The  direction  of  the  air  flow  may  be  upwardly or  downwardly,   as  desired,   but  must  flow  through  the moving  belt  containing  the  catalyst  particles.     The temperature  of  the  air  flowing  upwardly  or  downwardly through  the  moving  belt  and  contacting  the  catalyst particles  should  be  sufficiently  high  to  achieve  the removal  of  the  remaining  portion  of  the  contaminants still  present  on  the  catalyst  particles.   It  has  been found  particularly  advantageous  to  increase  the temperature  as  the  particles  move  through  the  furnace. Very  good  results  are  obtained  when  the  temperature  of the  oxygen-containing  gas  used  -suitably  air-  increases over  a  range  within  the  range  from  about  370  °C   (700  °F) to  about  595  °C   (1100  °F)   as   the  catalyst  particles continue  on  the  belt.     Accordingly,   the  temperature  in the   furnace  is   suitably  maintained  in  the  range  of  from 371  °C   (700  °F)   to  593  °C   (1100  °F)   and  preferably  from 371  °C   (700  °F)   to  510  °C   (950  °F) .   The  time  required  for the  moving  belt  treatment  and  the  removal  of  the remainder  of  the  carbon  and  sulfur  contaminants  suitably is  at  least  two  hours,   and  is  generally  from  four  hours to  eight  hours.<br>
In  one  embodiment  of  the  present  invention,   the catalyst  particles  are  passed  through  a  furnace   zone<br><br>
consisting  of  a  series  of  zones  where  the  temperatures are  controlled  in  each  zone,   suitably  in  such  way  that the  temperature  increases   in  each  successive  zone.     In this  embodiment,   the   zones  are  distinguished  by  physical separation  means,   so  basically  the   furnace  consists  of  a number  of  smaller  furnace  zones.     The  number  of  zones will  normally  be  less  than  8,   and  suitably  is   in  the range  from  3  to  8.   However,   the  number  of  zones  utilized is  not  critical.     In  this  embodiment,   the  catalyst residence  time  in  each  zone  is  maintained  at  the  desired time  by  controlling  the  belt  speed.     Initially,   the temperature  of  the  oxygen-containing  gas   in  the  first zone  is   371  °C   (700  °F)   to  482  °C   (900  °F) ,   preferably from  412  °C   (775  °F)   to  468  °C   (875  °F) .     Following  a residence  time  in  each  zone  of  0.5  hours  to  2  hours,   the catalyst  particles  are  passed  to  additional   zones   in which  the  temperature  of  the  oxygen-containing  gas   is increased  to  427  °C   (800  °F)   to  593  °C   (1100  °F) , preferably  from  432  °C   (810  °F)   to  510  °C   (950  °F).     The total  residence  time   for  the  moving  belt  treatment  is suitably  again  in  the  range  of   from  two  hours  to  eight hours,   although  longer  residence  times  may  be  utilized, if  desired.     The  regenerated  catalyst  is  then  withdrawn from  the  moving  belt  and  passed  to  a  cooling  step  before packaging  and  return  of  the  catalyst   for  reuse.<br>
The  regeneration  process  of  the  present  invention  is particularly  advantageous   from  an  economic  standpoint  for continuous  operations  in  that  the  throughput  can  be significantly  increased.<br>
The  process  of  this   invention  will  be  further described  by  the  following  embodiments  which  are  provided for  illustration  and  are  not  to  be  construed  as  limiting the  invention.<br><br>

Example   1<br>
Spent  catalysts  having  the  above  characteristics  were regenerated  using  the  process  of  the  present  invention. The  conditions  used  were  as   follows:<br>
The  gas  atmosphere,   i.e.,   air  containing  21  volume percent  of  oxygen,   was  entered  into  a  fluidized  bed chamber,   i.e.   pretreater,   at  a  superficial  velocity  of 131  m/min   (430   ft/min)   and  an  initial   temperature  of 510  °C   (950  °F).     The   fluidized  bed  chamber  had  a staggered,   perforated  type  of  distributor  plate  at  the bottom,   a  reaction  zone  having  a  45.7   cm   (18   inch) diameter  and  a  height  of  160  cm   (5  feet,   three  inches),   a transition  zone  of  conical   shape  having  45°  included angles  and  having  a  height  of  28.6  cm   (11.25  inches),   and a  disengagement  zone  having  a  diameter  of  91   cm<br><br>
(36  inches)   and  a  height  of  91  cm   (3   feet).     There  was  a cyclone  downstream  and  a  wet  scrubber  for  collecting  fine catalyst  particles  entrained  from  the  fluidized  bed chamber  and  for  removing  the  sulfur  dioxide  produced  in the  pretreater.<br>
The  spent  catalysts,   having  a  trilobe  shape  averaging 0.13  cm   (1/20  inch)   in  diameter  and  2.5  millimeters   (mm) in  length,   were  fed  continuously  from  a  7.6  cm   (three inch)   pipe  on  one  side  of  the  disengagement  section.     The partially  regenerated  catalysts  were  discharged continuously  from  a  15.2  cm   (six  inch)   pipe  on  the opposite  side  of  the  reaction  zone.     The  catalyst discharge  rate  was  controlled  by  means  of  a  flapper valve,   while  the  spent  catalyst  feed  rate  was  controlled using  a  vibrator  connected  to  a  hopper.     The  bed  height of  the  catalyst  in  the  pretreater  was  maintained  at  about 15  cm   (six  inches).<br>
Initially,   19.5  kg   (43  pounds)   of  regenerated catalysts  were  charged  to  the  pretreater  for  facilitating control  of  the  initial  reactor  temperature.     In  order  to achieve  a  steady  state,   prior  to  the   fluidized  bed treatment  step,   the  spent  catalyst  feed  rate  and  the discharge  rate  were  set  at  1.0  kg/min   (2.2  Ib/min).     The inlet  air  temperature  was  then  gradually  decreased from  510  °C   (950  °F)   to  466  °C   (870  °F)   after  20  minutes of  start-up.     The  feed  and  discharge  rate  were  then  reset to  about  2.0  kg/min   (4.3  Ib/min)    (10  minute  residence time)   and  the  inlet  air  temperature  was  gradually  reduced to  293  °C   (560  °F) .     One  drum  of  partially  regenerated catalysts  was  collected  at   60  minutes  after  the  start-up. The   feed  and  the  discharge  rate  were  then  further increased  to  2.5  kg/min   (5.5  Ib/min)    (7.8  minute residence  time),   and  the  inlet  air  temperature  was maintained  at  293  °C   (560  °F) .     Another  drum  of  the partially  regenerated  catalysts  was  collected  at<br><br>
120  minutes  after  the  start-up.     The  catalyst  temperature inside  the  fluidized  bed  pretreater  fluctuated  from 393  °C   (740  °F)   to   416  °C   (780  °F)   when  both  drums   of catalysts  were  collected.     For  the   first  drum,   the  sulfur content   from  this  step  was  2.6  wt%,   i.e.,   59  wt%  of  the sulfur  contaminants  had  been  removed,   and  the  carbon content  was   8.6  wt%,   i.e.,   16.5  wt%  of  the  carbon contaminants  had  been  removed.     For  the  second  drum,   the sulfur  content  was  2.7  wt%,   i.e.,   58  wt%  of  the  sulfur contaminants  had  been  removed,   and  the  carbon  content  was 8.6  wt%   i.e.,   16.5  wt%  of  the  carbon  contaminants  had been  removed.<br>
The  drums  of  partially  regenerated  catalysts   from  the pretreater  were  then  sent  to  the  moving  belt  for  the second  step  of  the  regeneration  process.     The  catalyst passed  through  Zone  1  which  had  a  temperature  ranging from  432  °C   (810  °F)   to  443  °C   (830  °F) ,   Zone  2  which  had a  temperature  ranging  from  382  °C   (720  °F)   to  438  °C (820  °F) ,   Zone  3  which  had  a  temperature  ranging  from 432  °C   (810  °F)   to  454  °C   (850  °F) ,   and  Zone  4  which  had  a temperature  ranging  from  432  °C   (810  °F)   to  460  °C (860  °F) .     The  catalyst  bed  thickness  on  the  belt  was maintained  at   1.9  cm   (3/4   inch)   and  the  belt  speed corresponded  to  a  production  rate  of  3402   kg (7500  pounds)   per  day.<br>
The  results  are  presented  in  Table  1  below. Comparative  Example  1<br>
Spent  catalysts  having  the  above  characteristics  were regenerated  using  a  fluidized  bed  treatment,   but  without a  subsequent  moving  belt  treatment.     The  conditions  used were  as   follows:<br>
The  catalysts  remaining  in  the  pretreater  in  Example 1  above  were  gradually  heated  from  a  temperature  of 393 °C   (740  °F)   up  to  a  temperature  of  482  °C   (900  °F) over  a  period  of  75  minutes.     The  superficial  air<br><br>
velocity  in  the  reactor  was  maintained  at  about  131  m/min (430   ft/min)   during  the  regeneration  process. The  results  are  presented  in  Table   1  below.<br>

Surface  area  determined  by  the  B.E.T.   method  for<br>
determining  specific  surface  area  as  described  in Brunauer,   S.,   Emmet,   P.   Y.   and  Teller,   E.,   J.  Am.   Chem. Soc,    60,   309-316   (1938)  .<br>
‘   '   Attrition  index  is  defined  as  the  number  percent  of particles  which  are  less  than  the  2.5  millimeters averaged  length.     The  number  percent  is  53.4   for spent/used  catalysts  as   indicated  in  the  table  above summarizing  the  characteristics  of  the  spent  catalyst.<br>
As  can  be  seen  in  Table  1,   the  spent  catalyst regenerated  according  to  the  present  invention   (Example 1)   has  a  much  lower  attrition  index  than  catalysts regenerated  using  a  fluidized  bed  process  alone (Comparative  Example  1).<br><br><br>
