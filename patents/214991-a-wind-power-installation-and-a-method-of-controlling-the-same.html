				<td>A WIND POWER INSTALLATION AND A METHOD OF<br>
CONTROLLING THE SAME<br>
The present invention concerns a wind power installation comprising<br>
a pylon and a pod arranged at the tip of the pylon. The invention further<br>
concerns a method of controlling such a wind power installation. In that<br>
respect the term wind power installation in accordance with the invention<br>
also includes annex buildings in which for example a transformer or the<br>
like is disposed.<br>
The invention further concerns a method of controlling a wind<br>
power installation.<br>
In horizontal-axis wind power installations, the generator which<br>
generates the electrical energy is disposed in the pod. That electrical<br>
energy is then passed by way of suitable conductors from the pod at the<br>
tip of the pylon to the base of the pylon or an annex building and is fed<br>
from there into the energy supply network. Provided for that purpose are<br>
further components such as for example rectifiers, switching installations,<br>
transformers and so forth, which, depending on the design concept of the<br>
wind power installation, are arranged in the pod and/or in the pylon of the<br>
wind power installation and/or in the annex building.<br>
Depending on the operational efficiency of the installation, a power<br>
of certainly several MWs is to be transmitted. In that respect, once again<br>
depending on the design concept of the wind power installation, at least a<br>
part of the power - and frequently the entire power - is passed by way of<br>
rectifiers, where generally semiconductors are used as switching elements<br>
which have to switch considerable currents.<br>
It will be appreciated that it is precisely when high levels of power<br>
are involved that high temperatures also inevitably occur, for example in<br>
the semiconductors but also in other components of a wind power<br>
installation, for example bearings. By virtue of the various causes, those<br>
high temperatures can result in the occurrence of a fire in such a wind<br>
power installation. A risk of fire also arises if for example, as a<br>
consequence of a technical fault, an arc is produced which in turn ignites<br>
combustible material in the proximity thereof. Such a fire can then easily<br>
result in damage to or destruction of important parts of the wind power<br>
installation so that the installation is prevented from continuing to<br>
operate. In that respect, besides the damage which is caused by the fire,<br>
there is then also a loss of output, until the wind power installation is<br>
repaired and brought back into operation again.<br>
Since 1999, in accordance with the statutory regulations, wind<br>
power installations have already been equipped with fire extinguishing<br>
devices in the pod or in the pylon. Those devices are manually operable,<br>
which makes the use thereof difficult in an actual fire situation, more<br>
specifically if staying in the entire wind power installation should be life-<br>
threatening.<br>
DE 100 05 190 discloses a wind power installation with a fire<br>
extinguishing arrangement for discharging an extinguishing agent in the<br>
pod, there referred to as the receiving space, by which a fire which has<br>
broken out is to be extinguished. Suitable devices are provided for that<br>
purpose in the pod of the wind power installation. A disadvantage with<br>
such a wind power installation however is that considerable amounts of<br>
extinguishing agent are already required to extinguish a fire in the pod of<br>
that known wind power installation. Considerably more extinguishing<br>
agent is required to extinguish a fire in the pylon of the wind power<br>
installation. A further disadvantage with that: known wind power<br>
installation is that damage already occurs when a fire breaks out.<br>
Therefore the object of the present invention is to provide a wind<br>
power installation which prevents the occurrence of a fire or at least<br>
reduces the damage.<br>
In a wind power installation of the kind set forth in the opening part<br>
of this specification, that object is attained by at least one first apparatus<br>
for producing an inert atmosphere in the wind power installation or a part<br>
thereof. In that respect the invention is based on the realisation that the<br>
occurrence of a fire is very substantially prevented in an inert atmosphere<br>
and it is therefore possible to forego expensive extinguishing apparatuses.<br>
That object is further attained by a method of controlling a wind power<br>
installation as described hereinbefore wherein an inert gas is fed to a<br>
predetermined region of the wind power installation if at least one predetermined<br>
physical parameter exceeds a predetermined limit value and wherein passage<br>
openings are closed to delimit the predetermined region.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one respective<br>
apparatus for producing an inert atmosphere is provided in each of the<br>
pylon and the pod of the wind power installation. The relatively large<br>
number of apparatuses for producing an inert atmosphere means that an<br>
inert atmosphere can be correspondingly more quickly produced in the<br>
wind power installation and thus the risk of fire can be correspondingly<br>
more quickly eliminated.<br>
In a particularly preferred feature an apparatus for producing an<br>
inert atmosphere is in the form of a fuel cell. In addition there is provided<br>
at least one apparatus for producing hydrogen and for feeding the<br>
hydrogen to the fuel cell. As a reaction takes place in fuel cells, in which<br>
water is formed from hydrogen and oxygen, the oxygen contained in the<br>
air in the interior of the installation can thus be used up. As the<br>
atmosphere contains a nitrogen proportion of about 78%, an oxygen<br>
proportion of about 21%, and negligible proportions of other gases, the<br>
fact that the oxygen is used up in the wind power installation essentially<br>
results in a nitrogen atmosphere which is highly inert. Accordingly, in<br>
regard to the further considerations herein, the consumption of oxygen<br>
and the production of nitrogen can be equated to each other. As soon as<br>
the oxygen in the wind power installation is used up, the fuel cells can no<br>
longer operate and therefore also no longer delivery any electrical energy.<br>
That in turn can be used as an indicator that an inert atmosphere has<br>
been produced within the wind power installation.<br>
In a particularly preferred development of the invention the<br>
electrical energy generated by the fuel cell is fed to the apparatus for<br>
producing hydrogen. In that way the amount of electrical energy which is<br>
produced by the wind power installation and which has to be used to<br>
produce hydrogen is correspondingly reduced.<br>
In a particularly preferred feature the wind power installation<br>
according to the invention has a closable drain for water from the wind<br>
power installation. In that way the water which is produced in operation<br>
of the fuel cell or cells can be removed from the wind power installation.<br>
The closability of the drain contributes to preventing fresh air and thus<br>
oxygen from re-entering the wind power installation.<br>
In order to permit people to be present in the wind power<br>
installation without involving conditions which are made more difficult by<br>
virtue of wearing breathing equipment, a preferred development of the<br>
invention provides that the wind power installation is provided with<br>
closable ventilation openings in the pylon and/or the pod. In that way the<br>
installation can be vented quickly before people enter it.<br>
In order to ensure that the installation can only be entered by<br>
people when there is a sufficient amount of oxygen available within the<br>
installation, there can be provided a multi-stage lock system for access to<br>
the wind power installation and an interlinking of the lock system to at<br>
least one sensor in the wind power installation. The door of the wind<br>
power installation can be unlocked with the lock system only when the<br>
sensor has detected a predetermined level of oxygen concentration in the<br>
installation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the wind power<br>
installation includes a storage container with a predetermined capacity for<br>
a gas. An inert gas can be collected in that storage container during<br>
normal operation of the wind power installation. That inert gas is then<br>
ready to be able to immediately flood at least a part of the wind power<br>
installation with that gas when required. Therefore, even if all oxygen in<br>
the wind power installation has not yet been used up, the (nitrogen) gas<br>
can be conveyed immediately into the installation if required during<br>
operation of the wind power installation in order immediately to produce a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere for example in a part of the installation which is<br>
particularly at risk with a fire, and thus reliably to prevent a fire from<br>
breaking out.<br>
In a particularly preferred development of the invention the cross-<br>
section of the pylon of the wind power installation has at least one floor<br>
passing entirely therethrough, the floor having a closable passage opening<br>
therethrough. In that way, a part of the wind power installation which is<br>
separated off by the floor can already have an inert atmosphere while an<br>
oxygen-bearing atmosphere is still present in the other part of the wind<br>
power installation. In the case of a fire, that floor can also prevent the<br>
spread of soot and smoke and thus limit damage in the installation. In<br>
that respect the passage opening can be automatically closable so that for<br>
example in the case of an acute fire risk the part of the installation which<br>
is endangered by the fire can be separated off and flooded with (nitrogen)<br>
gas.<br>
Operating conditions of a wind power installation at which there is<br>
an increased risk of fire can already be detected at an early time by one or<br>
more sensors for detecting physical parameters such as current,<br>
temperature, insulation resistance or conductivity etc. In that way for<br>
example the affected part of the wind power installation can be separated<br>
off from the rest of the installation by closing the passage openings, and<br>
as a precaution flooded with nitrogen. The outbreak of a fire can be<br>
prevented in that way. Even if a fire nonetheless breaks out, the damage<br>
for example due to soot deposit is limited by the spatial separation effect.<br>
In order to minimise the outage time of the wind power installation<br>
after a fault, automatic venting of the wind power installation can be<br>
effected as a consequence of predetermined faults. If therefore the<br>
nature of the fault already means that service engineers must enter the<br>
installation, the time that those service engineers require to travel to the<br>
installation can already be used for venting the installation so that, when<br>
the service engineers arrive, there is no longer any waiting time that is<br>
lost, while waiting for venting to occur. Therefore the work can then be<br>
started on the installation immediately.<br>
In addition in a particularly preferred embodiment of the method<br>
0<br>
the lock system can permit access to the installation only when an<br>
adequate concentration of oxygen within the installation is detected.<br>
The provision of a display device for displaying the nitrogen/oxygen<br>
concentration in the wind power installation is also advantageous. That<br>
display device should be mounted clearly visibly at the entrance to the<br>
wind power installation.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the invention are set forth in<br>
the appendant claims.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is described in greater detail<br>
hereinafter with reference to the Figures in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a simplified view of a wind power installation<br>
according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows a simplified view of the method when opening the<br>
access to the wind power installation, and<br>
Figure 3 shows a simplified view of the method when closing the<br>
wind power installation.<br>
In Figure 1 reference 10 denotes the pylon of a wind power<br>
installation and reference 12 denotes the pod on which rotor blades 14 are<br>
illustrated. The pylon 10 is arranged on a foundation 30 and is divided by<br>
intermediate floors 20 into a plurality of portions, In that respect the<br>
intermediate floors 20 may have flaps 22, by means of which passage<br>
openings can be closed. In that way the pylon 10 can be subdivided into a<br>
plurality of portions.<br>
Provided within the pylon 10 and the pod 12 are apparatuses for<br>
producing an inert atmosphere as indicated at 24. In a preferred<br>
embodiment those apparatuses 24 include fuel cells in order to take<br>
oxygen from the air within the wind power installation. When hydrogen is<br>
fed to those fuel cells 24 they produce electrical energy as long as oxygen<br>
is present in the corresponding portions of the pylon 10.<br>
As the hydrogen is preferably produced by electrolysis, the electrical<br>
energy produced by the fuel cells 24 can be used in turn for the<br>
electrolysis procedure. In that respect, on the one hand the water which<br>
has condensed on the wall of the pylon as a consequence of air humidity<br>
with the pylon 10 and which has been collected can be used for the<br>
electrolysis procedure. On the other hand, particularly in respect of<br>
offshore locations, any amount of hydrogen gas can be obtained from the<br>
water of the surrounding sea. The water which occurs during operation of<br>
the fuel cell 24 can be collected and discharged in a specifically targeted<br>
fashion out of the pylon.<br>
When only hydrogen gas is fed to the fuel cells 24, the oxygen<br>
within the portion of the wind power installation in which the respective<br>
fuel cell 24 is arranged is used up by operation of that fuel cell 24. In<br>
other words, the fuel cell 24 will generate electrical energy as long as<br>
oxygen is available within the portion of the pylon in which the fuel cell is<br>
disposed. As soon as the oxygen is used up, the fuel cell 24 will cease to<br>
generate electrical energy. That therefore affords a particularly simple<br>
possible way of establishing whether oxygen is still present in the air<br>
within the portion of the wind power installation which has the fuel cell 24.<br>
In order to feed as far as possible all oxygen in the pylon to the fuel<br>
cells, it is advantageous to provide a ventilation means or other means for<br>
thoroughly mixing all the air in the wind power installation so it is not just<br>
the oxygen in the air around the fuel cell that is consumed, but all oxygen<br>
disposed in the whole of the wind power installation.<br>
A portion for example of the pylon 10 of the wind power installation<br>
can be separated by an intermediate floor 20 with a passage opening<br>
which is closable by a flap 22, so that the fuel cell 24 in that portion only<br>
has to remove the oxygen from a reduced volume in that separated-off<br>
portion of the pylon, in order to produce an inert atmosphere there. By<br>
virtue of the normal composition of the ambient air consisting of about<br>
21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen and small proportions of other gases, the inert<br>
atmosphere, after the oxygen has been consumed, is substantially a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
In addition, provided in a portion of the pylon 10 is a storage<br>
container 28. A fuel cell 24 is also arranged in the same portion of the<br>
pylon. A nitrogen atmosphere is also produced in that portion, by virtue<br>
of operation of the fuel cell 24. As soon as the oxygen is consumed, that<br>
nitrogen can then be pumped into the storage container 28. That portion<br>
of the pylon is then ventilated again with ambient air and the procedure is<br>
repeated so that a stock of nitrogen can be collected in the storage<br>
container 28 (gas tank).<br>
It will be appreciated that, in place of a portion of the pylon, it is<br>
also possible to provide a space which is separated off, outside the pylon<br>
10 of the wind power installation, for example in the form of a container or<br>
an annex building. The first apparatus 24 for producing an inert<br>
atmosphere can be contained in that container. In that way, none of the<br>
portions of the pylon has to be repeatedly ventilated so that the risk of<br>
unintentionally ventilating other portions of the pylon is avoided. If it is<br>
necessary, a given part of the wind power installation, such as for example<br>
a portion of the pylon 10 or the pod 12, can be very rapidly flooded with<br>
nitrogen by way of suitable conduits and pumps, by the nitrogen being<br>
pumped there from the storage container 28. In that way a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere can be produced immediately in certain regions when required<br>
without having to wait until the fuel cell 24 has consumed the oxygen.<br>
Figure 2 shows a flow chart representing the progress of the control<br>
method when opening the wind power installation, for example to permit<br>
access for the service personnel. It will be assumed that the initial<br>
situation is normal operation of the wind power installation, in which, by<br>
virtue of sufficiently long periods of operation of the fuel cells (reference<br>
24 in Figure 1), an inert nitrogen atmosphere has been produced within<br>
the wind power installation or after a part of the wind power installation<br>
has been flooded with nitrogen. If the installation is stopped for example<br>
due to a fault and if the nature of the fault is already such that the service<br>
personnel must enter the installation, the stopped installation can already<br>
be ventilated, prior to the entry of the service personnel, for example by<br>
means of closable ventilation flaps in the door and the pod. The service<br>
personnel can therefore immediately enter the installation when they<br>
arrive, and begin with the repair procedure.<br>
In order however to be sure of preventing people from entering a<br>
wind power installation in which an inert atmosphere prevails, there can<br>
be provided a lock system which enables access to the installation only<br>
when a sufficient oxygen concentration is detected in the interior of the<br>
installation. Therefore, at the first query in Figure 2, a check is made to<br>
ascertain whether the wind power installation is already vented. If that is<br>
not the case the installation is firstly vented and then it is detected<br>
whether there is an adequate oxygen concentration within the installation.<br>
If the wind power installation has already been vented, a check is<br>
immediately made to ascertain whether there is an adequate oxygen<br>
concentration. If that is not the case the installation continues to be<br>
vented. When there is an adequate oxygen concentration, the lock is<br>
released so that the access to the wind power installation can be unlocked<br>
and access is then possible. Preferably the oxygen/nitrogen concentration<br>
should be checked not just at a single location, for example in the pod,<br>
but at a plurality of locations between the pod and the base of the pylon.<br>
With nitrogen in the air it is necessary at any event to ensure that a<br>
person in the lower part of the pylon does not climb up and there<br>
suffocate due to a lack of oxygen. The fans (not shown) which are usually<br>
provided in the wind power installation must also be used to provide for<br>
fresh air for a rapid and equally distributed atmosphere of air with an<br>
adequate oxygen content (21%), right at the beginning of the ventilation<br>
procedure.<br>
Figure 3 diagrammatically shows the procedure when closing the<br>
installation, for example after concluding the work and bringing the<br>
installation back into operation again. Firstly, a check is made to ascertain<br>
whether the access opening such as for example a door is closed. As long<br>
as the door is not closed, any access to the installation is possible and<br>
thus the creation of an inert atmosphere is already prevented for that<br>
reason. In addition, oxygen always continues to flow through the open<br>
door so that it is already impossible to produce an inert atmosphere for<br>
that reason.<br>
As soon as the door is closed, a check is made to ascertain whether<br>
the lock has been actuated, that is to say whether the door is locked fast.<br>
This ensures that the installation cannot be accidentally entered or that<br>
the control means, on the basis of the closing procedure required before<br>
entering the installation, can detect that someone is trying to enter the<br>
wind power installation and can thus initiate ventilation of the installation<br>
in good time.<br>
When therefore the door is closed and the lock locked, the control<br>
means can set the fuel cells in operation and thus begin to produce an<br>
inert atmosphere (nitrogen atmosphere) within the wind power<br>
installation.<br>
As it is precisely after the execution of repair operations that the<br>
risk of a fire is particularly severe, for example as a consequence of<br>
assembly errors or technical faults on the spare parts, and as the oxygen<br>
concentration within the wind power installation is still high in the time<br>
shortly after the service personnel have left the installation, a certain part<br>
of the wind power installation, for example a part thereof which is<br>
equipped with switching equipment, can be flooded with nitrogen from a<br>
storage means. In that way the risk of fire is immediately considerably<br>
reduced. The fact that, when the entire wind power installation is flooded<br>
with nitrogen and the inert atmosphere produced therewith within the<br>
wind power installation, the normal fire extinguishing service personnel<br>
cannot enter the installation, is acceptable because in any case, in the<br>
event of a fire within a wind power installation, the extinguishing service<br>
personnel can scarcely pass into the interior thereof without themselves<br>
suffering injury.<br>
It will be appreciated that further technical measures are possible,<br>
which prevent a person from being mistakenly locked inside a wind power<br>
installation and thus exposed to a nitrogen atmosphere. That can be<br>
implemented for example by motion sensors such as infrared sensors. An<br>
additional or alternative measure can be expressly signing-in and signing-<br>
out of any person who enters the wind power installation and leaves it<br>
again. In addition, it is also possible to envisage providing that the fuel<br>
cells or pumps with which a certain portion of the wind power installation<br>
is flooded with nitrogen are switched on with a time delay so that, even<br>
after a person is by mistake locked inside the wind power installation,<br>
there is still a certain period of time available to notice the mistake and to<br>
free the person from the installation in good time. Finally the access to<br>
the installation from the interior can be provided with an emergency<br>
opening device which makes it possible to leave the installation even<br>
without a key.<br>
Supplying the interior of the wind power installation with an inert<br>
atmosphere such as a nitrogen gas is not just limited to the pod or to the<br>
interior of the pylon. As the pod is also directly connected to the rotor and<br>
thus the rotor blades of the wind power installation, the rotor blades can<br>
also be supplied in the interior with a suitable nitrogen atmosphere in<br>
order also to prevent a fire from breaking out in the rotor blades.<br>
