				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a novel method of removing excess dye from newly printed or dyed fabric or yarn as well as a system and a composition for use in the method.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Printing and dyeing of textiles is carried out by applying dyes to the textile by any appropriate method for binding the dyestuff to the fibres in the textiles. Excess soluble dyestuff not bound to the fibres must be removed after dyeing to ensure fastness of the dyed textiles and to prevent unwanted dye transfer during laundering of the textiles by the consumer.<br>
Generally, a large amount of water is required for complete removal of excess dye. In a conventional process the printed or dyed textile is first rinsed with cold water, then washed at high temperature with the addition of a suitable additive to decrease back-staining, like poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). The process is repeated until a satisfactory amount of dyestuff (and thickeners) has been removed. , PVP can be added to reduce back-staining during rinsing, but this compound does not bleach the dye and is relatively expensive. Furthermore, the waste liquor from a conventional process tends to be strongly coloured and may represent a disposal problem, which is not reduced by the use of PVP.<br>
WO 92/18687 discloses a method of bleaching excess dye from printed or dyed fabric by treating with a liquor containing an enzyme exhibiting peroxidase activity or oxidase activity, an O2 or H2O2 source as applicable, and optionally an additional oxidi-zable substrate, such as a metal ion, a halide ion or an organic compound, such as a phenol.<br>
However, the concentrations of such additional substrates necessary for enzymatically bleaching the excess dye in the<br><br>
rinse liquor may present a risk of bleaching the dyed textiles themselves.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for removing or bleaching excess dye without bleaching the dyed textile. This is achieved by a process for removal of excess dye from newly manufactured printed or dyed fabric or yarn comprising treatment with a rinse liquor comprising<br>
-	at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of enzymes exhibiting peroxidase activity or laccase activity,<br>
-	an oxidation agent, and<br>
-	at least one mediator selected from the group consisting of aliphatic, cyclo-aliphatic, heterocyclic or aromatic compounds containing the moiety &gt;N-OH, and<br>
-	optionally additives.<br>
In the present invention the term 'mediator" means an additional oxidizable substance improving the bleaching performance.<br>
By suitable combination of mediator and enzyme it is possible to avoid bleaching of the dyed textile while bleaching dyes in solution, thereby reducing the amount of unbleached dye deposited on the fibres and thus increasing the wet fastness of the dyed or printed textile.<br>
By this process it is furthermore possible to reduce the number of rinsing steps and the temperature of the rinsing water in the rinsing steps compared to the conventional processes, thereby saving energy and costs.<br>
Another object of the present invention is a system for removal of excess dye from newly manufactured printed or dyed fabric or yarn, which is a multi-component system comprising at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of enzymes exhibiting peroxidase activity or laccase activity, an oxidation agent, and at least one mediator selected from the group consisting of aliphatic, cyclo-aliphatic, heterocyclic or aromatic compounds containing the moiety &gt;N-OH, and optionally additives, such as rinsing additives.<br><br>
The corrponents cf rhe system may be combined as a solution, a slurry or granulates depending on the specific enzymes and mediators selected.<br>
A further object of the present invention is the use of the components specified above for the preparation of a multi-component system for removal of excess dye or print from newly manufactured fabric or yarn.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fabric or yarn<br>
The process of the invention is applicable to all types of textile materials, both natural fibres and synthetic fibres as well as blends thereof. Typical examples are cellulosic fibres (cotton and flax), modified cellulose fibres (e.g. acetate and triacetate), protein fibres (e.g. wool and silk), polyamide fibres (e.g. nylon 6 and 6,6), polyester fibres (e.g. poly(ethylene terephthalate)) and acrylic fibres.<br>
The process of the invention may be applied to dyed yarn, to knitted, woven or non-woven fabric, or to garments made from dyed and/or printed fabric, especially garments made from differently coloured material.<br>
Printing method<br>
The process of the invention is suited for excess dye bleaching after any kind of textile printing. Examples of commonly used techniques are printing on a Rotation film, a Rouleaux, a Flash film, or a Transfer film device. After printing the dye is fixed on the textile by e.g. steaming or treatment with hot air.<br>
Dyeing method<br>
The process of the invention is suited for excess dye bleaching after any kind of dyeing. The dyeing of textiles is for example carried out by passing the fabric through a concentrated solution of dye, followed by storage of the wet fabric in<br><br>
a vapour tight enclosure zo permit time for diffusion and reaction of the dye with the fabric substrate prior to rinsing off un-reacted dye. Alternatively, the dye may be fixed by subsequent steaming of the textile prior to rinsing.<br>
The process applies to any kind of dyes, such as reactive dyes.<br>
Enzyme<br>
Enzymes exhibiting peroxidase activity or laccase activity are those which by using hydrogen peroxide or molecular oxygen, respectively are capable of oxidising a variety of compounds, such as phenols and aromatic amines.<br>
According to the invention the concentration of enzyme is 0.005 to 5 mg enzyme protein per 1 of rinse liquor, preferably, 0.02 to 2 mg enzyme protein per 1 of rinse liquor, more preferably 0.05 to 1 mg enzyme protein per 1 of rinse liquor. According to the liquor ratio, this may be translated to dosages of enzyme per kg of fabric, e.g. at a liquor ratio of 10:1, the most preferred enzyme dosage is from 0.5 to 10 mg enzyme per kg of textile fabric.<br>

-	optionally additives<br>
for the preparation of a multi-component system for removal of excess dye or print from newly manufactured fabric or yarn.<br>
Process conditions<br>
The removal of excess dye, according to the invention, may comprise rinsing with rinse liquor in 2 to 6 rinsing steps, more preferred in 2 to 5 rinsing steps, even more preferred in 2 to 4 rinsing steps, in particular in 3 to 4 rinsing steps. The amount of rinsing steps is dependent on the concentration of the mediator and of the concentration of the peroxidase.<br>
The multi-component system as defined according to this invention may be used in any of the rinsing steps performed, however it is preferably added in one of the last rinsing steps, in particular in the third or fourth rinsing step.<br><br>
The process may be run in batch mode or continuous mode. The process may be applied on a winch, a beck, a jet dyer, an open-width washing machine, a J or U box, a steamer, or any other equipment available suitable for a rinsing process.<br>
The process conditions must be chosen according to the characteristics of the enzyme in question. The temperature at the rinsing step comprising a multi-component system as defined<br>
above is preferably ranging from 4 0°C to 80°C, such as from 5 0°C<br>
to 70°C, and pH is typically in the range of 5.5-9.5, such as 6.5-9.<br>
Fatness<br>
Fatsness (wet, crock, light, etc.) may be measured by various methods as known in the art. Wet fastness may be measured as described below. Colourfastness to crocking, which is designed to determine the amount of colour transferred from the surface of coloured materials to other surfaces by rubbing, may be measured according to AATCC Test Method 8-1996. Colourfastness to light, in which samples of the material to be tested and the agreed upon comparison standard(s) are exposed simultaneously to a light source under specified conditions, may be measured according to AATCC Test Method 16-1993.<br>
Wet fastness<br>
The multi-component system as defined above is added to the rinsing liquor to prevent re-deposition of solubilised excess dye by bleaching it in solution.<br>
The wet fastness or water fastness reflects the degree to which this has successfully been achieved.<br>
In the present invention the wet fastness is measured by the standard method (DIN 54 006). Briefly, the method comprises soaking a dyed fabric and pressing it together with swatches of white fabric. After separate drying of the fabrics, the swatches are evaluated for staining.<br><br>
The degree of wez fasrness is indicated on a scale, the higher number the better wet fastness. 1 means very low wet fastness, whereas 5 means very high wet fastness.<br>
Colour measurement (Example 5)<br>
A Gretag-Mecbath Colour Eye 310 0 was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to evaluate the chromatidty using the change in the colour space coordinates L*a*b* (CIELAB-system), where as usual:<br>
L* gives the change in white/black on a scale from 0 to 100, and a decrease in L* means an increase in black colour (decrease in white colour) and an increase in L* means an increase in white colour (decrease in black colour).<br>
a* gives the change in red/green, and a decrease in a* means an increase in green colour (decrease in red colour) , and an increase in a* means an increase in red colour (decrease in green colour).<br>
b* gives the change in blue/yellow, and a decrease in b* means an increase in blue colour (decrease in yellow colour), and an increase in b* means an increase in yellow colour (decrease in blue colour) (Vide WO 96/12846 NOVO).<br>
The Gretag-Macbeth Colour Eye 3100 was operated in the L*a*b* colour space. The light source was D65 standard light. The software used for evaluation was Optiview Quality Control<br>
1.7c. The observation angle was 10°. The instrument was calibrated using a Macbeth calibration plate (white). Each result was an average of 10 measurements. Fabric rinsed without enzyme and mediator was measured and the coordinates L*a*b* were calculated and entered as a reference. The coordinates of the samples were then for each of L*, a*, b* calculated as the difference<br>
(A) of the average of the measurements on each swatch from the reference value.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated in the following examples which are not in any way intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed.<br><br>

Example 5<br>
Reactive dyeing of cotton fabric followed by enzymatic rinsing processes using two different mediators<br>
Knitted, bleached 100 % cotton was dyed in a Mathis jet-dyer (laboratory scale jet dyeing machine) at the following conditions :<br>
Water:     softened water, 10 1/kg of fabric Dyestuff:   1 % Remazol Yellow RR<br>
1 % Remazol Red RR<br>
1 % Remazol Blue RR Na2S04:     7 0 g/1 Na2C03:     5 g/1 NaOH (32 % in water):  3 ml/1<br>
LEVEGAL RL:      1.0 g/1    (levelling agent) ERKANTOL NR:     1.0 g/1     (wetting agent) PERSOFTAL L:     1.0 g/1    (crease-preventing agent)<br>
Remazol Yellow RR, Remazol Red RR, and Remazol Blue RR are products of DyStar.<br><br>
LEVEGAL RL, ERKANTOL NH, and  PZRSOFTAL L are products of BAYER.<br>
The dyeing process started at 3 0°C by addition of Na2C03, NaOH (1 ml /1) , Na2 SO4, LEVEGAL RL, ERKANTOL NR, PERSOFTAL L. The dye -stuffs were added 15 minutes after start. 30 minutes after start<br>
the temperature was increased up to 50°C within 2 0 minutes. 3 0<br>
minutes after reaching 50°C the remaining NaOH (2 ml/1) was added. 45 minutes after the addition of NaOH (2 ml/1) the dyeing process was finished by draining off the dyeing liquor, whereafter the rinsing process was started.<br>
The following rinsing process was carried out for each mediator (1-hydroxybenzotriazole (according to the invention); and methyl syringate (comparison)):<br>
First rinsing step:<br>
Addition of fresh softened water; 10 1/kg fabric.<br>
Rinsing 10 minutes at 40^C.<br>
Draining the rinsing liquor.<br>
Second rinsing step:<br>
Addition of fresh softened water; 10 1/kg fabric.<br>
Addition of 10 ml/1 of acetic acid (6 % solution in water)<br>
Rinsing 2 0 minutes at 95°C.<br>
Draining the rinsing liquor.<br>
Third rinsing step:<br>
Addition of fresh softened water; 10 1/kg fabric.<br>
Addition of 5.0 ml/I of potassium phosphate buffer  (1.0 M,<br>
pH=7.0)<br>
Rinsing 40 minutes at 60°C.<br>
Addition of 0.8 mg/1 Peroxidase SP502,  0.4 mM mediator and<br>
39 mg/1 (0.4 mM) H2O2 (35 % solution in water)<br>
Rinsing 10 minutes at 60°C, Draining the rinsing liquor.<br><br>
SP502 was a liquid preparation of recombinant Coprinus cinereus peroxidase supplied by Novo Nordisk A/S.<br>
The fabric was squeezed and dried. A colour measurement was performed using a colour measuring instrument (Gretag-Macbeth Colour Eye 3100) as described above.<br>
Results:<br>
Mediator: l-hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
AL* = 0.756<br>
Aa* = 0.045<br>
Ab* = 0.022<br>
Mediator: Methyl syringate AL* = 3.142 Aa* = 0.134 Ab* = 0.834<br>
Conclusion: It can be seen that methyl syringate has a significant and undesired influence on the chromatidty of the fabric.<br>
The positive Ab* of 0.834 indicates a very strong and not acceptable increase in yellow colour whereas a Ab* of 0.022 which is found for l-hydroxybenzotriazole is negligible and not visible. It is seen that also AL* and Aa* are significantly smaller in the treatment according to the invention than in the comparison treatment.<br>
Example 6<br>
Enzymatic bleaching of soluble dyes<br>
The dyes tested were Reactive Black 5 (Remazol Black B) , Reactive Red 198 (Remazol Red RB) , Reactive Blue 220 (Remazol Brilliant Blue BB), Reactive Blue 21 (Remazol Turquoise Blue G), and<br><br>
Reactive Orange 107 :Re:nazcl Gclden Yellow RNL) , all ex Dystar. All dyes were dissolved in a 0.5 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to an initial absorbance of approximately 0.4 at the wavelength Xraax of maximum absorbance within the visible range. The solutions were then placed in a thermostated quartz cell in a HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer, the three components of the enzymatic oxidation system were added (CiP to 0.2 mg/1, HOBT to 100  pcM,  hydrogen peroxide to 200  ^M) ,  and the absorbance<br>
ABS (&gt;-max) at X.max monitored over time. The degree of bleaching at<br>
5 min, i.e. the decrease in ABS(X-max) over 5 min divided by<br>
ABS (X-max) at t = 0, is shown below, measured at three temperatures .<br>
Degree of bleaching at 5 min(%):<br>
Reactive Black 5 (X,max=596 nm) :<br>
79 (60°C);  82 (70'C) ;   72 {80°C);<br>
Reactive Red 198 (X,max=517 nm) :<br>
97 {60°C);  100 (70°C) ;  88 (80^*0;<br>
Reactive Blue 220 (A,max=608 nm) : 100 {60°C) ; 98 {70^*0;   30 (80°C);<br>
Reactive Blue 21 (X.max=663 nm) : 100 (60°C) ; 88 (70°C) ;   61 (80°C) ;<br>
Reactive Orange 107 (?tmax=408 nm) : 90 (60°C) ;  67 (70^C) ;   36 (80^0.<br>
