				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a performance monitoring system and method. In<br>
particular, although not exclusively, the invention relates to a system and<br>
method for monitoring the performance of equipment operators, particularly<br>
operators of draglines and shovels employed in mining and excavation<br>
applications or the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In many fields of manufacturing and industry, it is desirable or necessary to<br>
monitor the performance of equipment operators in addition to the equipment<br>
itself. This may be for managerial purposes to ensure that operators are complying<br>
with a minimum required standard of performance and to help identify where<br>
improvements in performance may be achieved. Monitoring performance may also<br>
be desired by an operator to provide the operator with an indication of their own<br>
performance in comparison with other operators and to demonstrate their level of<br>
competence to management.<br>
One field in which performance monitoring is required is the operation of draglines<br>
and shovels and the like as used in large-scale mining and excavation applications.<br>
For commercial purposes, it is important that an operator is operating a piece of<br>
machinery to the best of the operator's and the machine's capabilities.<br>
There are however many factors that need to be measured and considered to<br>
enable fair and useful comparisons to be made between different operators,<br>
between different machines, between present and previous performances and<br>
between different operating conditions.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a method for monitoring<br>
performance of atleast one machine operator which eliminates the disadvantages<br>
of prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method for monitoring performance<br>
of atleast one machine operator, which makes possible that performance-<br>
monitoring information is promptly available to inform management and operators<br>
alike of current performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect, although it need not be the only or indeed the broadest<br>
aspect, the invention resides in a method for monitoring performance of at least<br>
one machine operator, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
measuring at least one machine parameter during operation of the machine by the<br>
operator;<br>
generating at least one performance indicator distribution from measurements of<br>
the at least one machine parameter; and,<br>
calculating at least one performance indicator from the at least one performance<br>
indicator distribution.<br>
The method may comprise the step of providing feedback to the operator by<br>
displaying the at least one performance indicator in substantially real-time to the<br>
operator. Alternatively, the at least one performance indicator may be displayed to<br>
the operator once the machine has completed an operation cycle.<br>
Suitably, the at least one machine parameter may be a dependent machine<br>
parameter. Alternatively, the at least one machine parameter may be the sole<br>
parameter represented by a particular performance indicator.<br>
The method may comprise the step of segmenting at least one of the dependent<br>
machine parameters into segments, the range of each segment constituting a<br>
segmentation resolution.<br>
Suitably, the step of segmenting at least one of the dependent machine parameters<br>
comprises specifying a magnitude of the range for each segment of each<br>
dependent machine parameter requiring segmentation.<br>
Suitably, at least one dependent machine parameter may not require<br>
segmentation.<br>
Suitably, the step of generating the at least one performance indicator distribution<br>
may comprise using a mixture of one or more distributions to model the<br>
performance indicator distribution. The number of mixtures may be set<br>
dynamically.<br>
Suitably, the at least one performance indicator distribution may be generated<br>
using an algorithm. The algorithm may be an LBG algorithm. Alternatively, the at<br>
least one performance indicator distribution may be generated using a linear<br>
ranking model (LRM).<br>
Suitably, two or more performance indicators may be combined to yield an overall<br>
performance rating of the machine operator. One or more of the performance<br>
indicators may be positively or negatively weighted with respect to the other<br>
performance indicator(s).<br>
According to another aspect, the invention resides in a system for monitoring<br>
performance of a machine operator, the system comprising:<br>
at least one measuring device for measuring at least one machine parameter<br>
during operation of the machine by the operator;<br>
a server for generating at least one performance indicator distribution from<br>
measurements of the at least one machine parameter; and,<br>
a performance indicator calculation module for calculating at least one performance<br>
indicator from the at least one performance indicator distribution.<br>
Preferably, the server is remote from the machine.<br>
Suitably, the server comprises storage means, communication means and a<br>
performance indicator distribution calculation module.<br>
Suitably, the performance indicator calculation module is onboard the machine.<br>
Preferably, the performance indicator calculation module is coupled to<br>
communication means for transmitting and receiving data to and from the<br>
server.<br>
Preferably, the system further comprises at least one display device for<br>
displaying the at least one performance indicator in substantially real-time to the<br>
operator. Alternatively, the at least one performance indicator may be displayed to<br>
the operator once the machine has completed an operation cycle. The at least one<br>
display device may be situated in, on or about the machine and/or remote from<br>
the machine.<br>
Suitably, the communication means comprises a transmitter and a receiver.<br>
Further aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
The present invention monitors one or more parameters or variables of a machine<br>
to provide an accurate indication of how well an operator is performing, for<br>
example, in comparison with other operators for the same machine and/or in<br>
comparison with previous performances of the same operator.<br>
Although the present invention will be described in the context of monitoring the<br>
performance of machines found on a mining site, it will be appreciated that the<br>
present invention is applicable to a wide variety of machines found in various<br>
situations and performance monitoring is required.<br>
A machine parameter may itself be referred to as a key performance indicator<br>
(KPI). Alternatively, a KPI may be dependent on one or more machine parameters.<br>
The KPIs may be represented and displayed as a percentage or a score, such as<br>
points scored out of 10, that describes how well the operator is performing for a<br>
given parameter and/or KPI. A high percentage value, such as &gt;90% for<br>
example, shows that the operator is performing extremely well. A mid-range<br>
value for a KPI, such as 50% for example, shows that the operator's<br>
performance is about average and less than this example percentage<br>
demonstrates that their performance is below average for that KPI.<br>
Each KPI parameter is related to the performance of an operator for one or more<br>
given machine parameters such as fill time, cycle time, dig rate, and/or other<br>
parameter(s). KPIs are a measure of how the operator is performing for the<br>
particular parameter(s) related to that KPI compared to the other operators. The<br>
performance of, or rating for, a particular operator is calculated using, in part,<br>
previous data recorded for the machine and provides an indication of whether or<br>
not the operator is improving. The process for measuring the parameters and<br>
achieving the KPIs is described in detail hereinafter.<br>
The parameter data is acquired using conventional measuring equipment such as<br>
sensors, timing means and the like and the particular equipment required to<br>
acquire the data would be familiar to a person of ordinary skill in the relevant<br>
art.<br>
Different comparisons between the data are also possible. The current operator<br>
of a machine can be compared to all the other operators of the same machine or<br>
to the operator's previous performance(s). This shows how well they perform<br>
against others and shows them whether they are improving respectively.<br>
One important consideration of the present invention is filtering the data from all<br>
the machines that may be present in, for example, a mine site or other situation<br>
to enable fair and meaningful comparisons to be made. Various factors that may<br>
affect KPI parameters are as follows:<br>
Machine: Each machine possesses different operating characteristics and<br>
therefore the data from one machine will not reflect the performance of<br>
operating another machine.<br>
Dig Mode: Different dig modes are possible with a single machine and these may<br>
differ between different machines, which is significant. In the present invention<br>
operators can enter a particular dig mode corresponding to the mode of<br>
operation of the machine. The selected dig mode must be correct otherwise the<br>
KPIs may he mis-represented and provide misleading results.<br>
Operator: Operators can compare their performance against their own<br>
previous performances to verify whether they are improving. Operators can also<br>
compare their performances against those of other operators.<br>
Location: Different locations in the mine will have different digging conditions<br>
even though the digging mode may be the same. This may be represented by<br>
the specific gravity (s.g.) or by an index that describes the current digging<br>
difficulty, known as the dig index.<br>
Bucket: Some KPIs will be affected by the type of bucket being used on the<br>
dragline. For example, different size buckets, which are usually pre-selected on<br>
the basis of the application, may produce different dig rates. For comparison<br>
purposes, an operator should not be disadvantaged when using a smaller bucket.<br>
Bucket Rigging: If this factor changes, but the bucket does not, the KPI<br>
results may be affected.<br>
Weather: The weather can change the digging conditions and therefore<br>
affect the performance attained by the operator.<br>
Some of the above parameters are readily filtered from the data, such as<br>
machine, dig mode, operator, bucket and possibly location. The more the data is<br>
divided however, the more data needs to be processed, stored and transmitted<br>
from the server 8 to the onboard computer module 4 (shown in FIG 6), to<br>
implement the KPIs. To reduce this volume of data, the location parameter<br>
could optionally be omitted, since location data is generally reflected in the<br>
bucket type being used. Weather and bucket rigging are more difficult to filter.<br>
Therefore, the parameter filters of machine, dig mode and bucket remain. These<br>
parameter filters may be combined with the operator parameter filter.<br>
If the data of all operators are to be compared, the operator filter is omitted.<br>
When filtering by operator, the number of operators multiplies the amount of<br>
data for the mine comparison. For example, if there are 1000 bytes of KPI data<br>
to download to the module for the mine data and there are 100 operators, then<br>
this equates to a total of 101,000 bytes of KPI data to download, which<br>
represents 100 data sets for 100 operators plus one data set for the all operator<br>
comparison.<br>
This large data problem is one of the problems addressed by the present<br>
invention, which enables the present invention to provide substantially real-time<br>
monitoring of operators' performance.<br>
The large data problem can be solved in a number of ways. One option is to<br>
only download KPI data for the operators that exist in the recorded data in the<br>
database. Alternatively, only KPI data for operators that have ever logged onto<br>
a particular machine, which is stored in an operator profile, may be downloaded.<br>
For any new operator who logs on, the data is requested and downloaded. If the<br>
data does not exist in the database, then the display can show that there is no<br>
KPI data for that operator. Another alternative is to just download the KPI data<br>
for the operator that just logged on.<br>
Even with the data filtering described above, a single value such as fill time,<br>
cannot be compared to other fill times unless one or more dependencies are<br>
introduced. Some KPIs, such as the Machine Reliability KPI, do not require a<br>
dependent parameter, but many do, such as the Swing Production KPI. A<br>
dependent parameter adds another level of filtering to the data that is specific to<br>
the parameter being rated.<br>
A simple example is the Swing Production KPI. The time taken to swing a<br>
dragline, for example, is directly related to the angle through which the dragline<br>
swings (Swing Angle) and the vertical distance the bucket travels from the end of<br>
a fill to the top of a dump of the bucket contents. These dependencies are<br>
included in the KPI calculation by segmenting each of the dependent parameters<br>
into ranges. The range of the segment is called the segmentation resolution. The<br>
swing angle in this example could be divided into 10-degree increments over, for<br>
example, 360 degrees. If the vertical travel distance is ignored in this example,<br>
this would provide 36 data segments.<br>
To calculate the KPI, the data recorded from that machine is sorted, for example,<br>
by dig mede, for each of the segments. For the data associated with each<br>
segment, a KPI distribution is calculated. Therefore, for the Swing Production KPI<br>
example, the swing times for each swing angle segment are extracted and a<br>
distribution of times is calculated for each segment. Thus, 36 distributions would<br>
be calculated in total. The actual swing times and swing angles are measured<br>
onboard the machine using conventional timing and angle measuring<br>
instruments that are familiar to those skilled in the relevant art. The distribution<br>
associated with the swing angle segment being measured is then selected to<br>
calculate the KPI.<br>
Introducing more dependent variables creates the problem of producing more<br>
data segments, which in turn means more distributions and more data. In the<br>
example above, if the vertical distance was included and divided into, for<br>
example, 10 metre segments from 0 to +70 metres (7 segments), there would<br>
be 252 (36 x 7) distributions to calculate and download to the machine just for<br>
the Swing Production KPI.<br>
The volume of data can be reduced by carefully designing the segmentation of<br>
the dependent parameters. One way is to include extremities in the<br>
segmentation, which allows only segmentation of the areas that are common. In<br>
the above example, the swing angle could be re-segmented such that one<br>
segment contains swing angles less than, for example, 30 degrees and another<br>
segment contains swing angles greater than, for example, 200 degrees whilst<br>
maintaining the 10-degree segments between 30 degrees and 200 degrees. This<br>
re-segmentation results in 19 segments for the swing angle parameter compared<br>
with 36 in the previous example.<br>
The vertical height dependency could be reduced to 2 segments by identifying<br>
the height at which the swing velocity is reduced (i.e., for hoist dependent<br>
swings). Less than this height is one segment and above this height is another.<br>
This reduces the total number of segments to 38 (2x19) segments.<br>
As described in the foregoing, a distribution exists for each segment of the KPI<br>
that is dependent on some other parameter. Finding a distribution that describes<br>
the KPI data is not trivial. Even though the sampled data looks Gaussian in<br>
nature, the graphs are skewed and comprise some data at the extremities.<br>
FIG 1 shows some data taken for the KPI representing production. All the other<br>
KPIs show a similar distribution. FIG 1 shows a positive skew in the data and<br>
some data to the right of the graph. A simple Gaussian would model most of this<br>
data quite adequately. However, it cannot be judged how the data will skew or<br>
how the distribution will change once the KPI information is available to the<br>
machine operator. It is likely that the distribution will become more positively<br>
skewed and less Gaussian like.<br>
One solution to this problem is to model the data with a multi-modal or multi-<br>
variant Gaussian mixture in which a mixture of different Gaussian distributions<br>
are used to model each KPI distribution. This has the advantage that the number<br>
of mixtures can be changed depending on the data. If the data is very Gaussian-<br>
like, then a single mixture comprising a simple Gaussian distribution may be<br>
used. If the data is very obscure, then a plurality of mixtures can be used to<br>
describe the distribution.<br>
The number of mixtures depends on the data that is being modeled and the<br>
number of mixtures may be set dynamically. With sufficient data, an algorithm<br>
could be employed to determine the maximum number of mixtures required to<br>
represent the KPI distribution. If there is only a small amount of data, for<br>
example less than a selectable threshold of 10 samples, then modeling may be<br>
carried out using a single mixture. If the algorithm does not converge with the<br>
maximum number of mixtures, the highest number of mixtures that cause the<br>
algorithm to converge can be used.<br>
One algorithm that could be used to generate the KPI distributions from the data<br>
is a Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm, which is known to persons skilled in the<br>
relevant art. The LBG algorithm is an iterative algorithm that splits data into a<br>
number of clusters. The algorithm is designed for vectors, but in the present<br>
invention, single dimension vectors (single values) are used, thus simplifying the<br>
algorithm.<br>
The detail of the LBG algorithm will now be described. xm = {x1,x2,...,xM} is the<br>
training data set consisting of M data samples.  Cn = {c1 ,c2,...,cN} are the<br>
centroids calculated for N clusters, s is the iteration conversion coefficient, which<br>
is usually fixed to a small value greater than zero, such as 0.01.<br>
The steps for generating the KPI distributions are as follows:<br>
1.       N=l and given x, calculate the initial centroid c,  by calculating the<br>
mean:<br>
2.       Calculate the initial distortion of the data for the initial centroid:<br>
3.        Set iteration index I=0.<br>
4.        Find the cluster p with the maximum distortion.<br>
5.        Increment the number of clusters: N = N +1<br>
6.        Split cluster P into 2:<br>
7.        For all 1 
where n*is the index of the centroid:<br><br>
and the total number of values assigned to each centroid Tn.<br>
8.        Calculate the new centroids:<br><br>
9.        i= i+ 1.<br>
10.      Calculate the average of the minimum distortion between the data sample<br>
and its closest centroid: <br>
11.      If ( , then go back to step 7.<br>
12.      Save the temporary calculation centroids in a secure location.<br>
13.      If the number of desired clusters has not been reached, then go back to<br>
Step 4.<br>
The algorithm starts by treating the whole of the data as one cluster. It then<br>
divides the cluster into two and iteratively assigns data to each of the clusters<br>
until the centroids of the clusters do not move appreciably. Once the iterations<br>
converge, the cluster with the greatest spread (accumulative distance between<br>
data and centroid) is split and the iterative calculations are repeated. The<br>
algorithm continues until the required number of clusters has been reached. The<br>
result is data divided into clusters with centroids. The data for each cluster is<br>
then used to calculate a mean and standard deviation for that cluster, i.e. a<br>
distribution. The weight of each cluster is calculated as the number of data<br>
samples in the cluster compared to the total number of data samples. This<br>
weight is known as the mixture coefficient.<br>
In order to calculate the KPI from the distributions, the following formula for a<br>
multi-variant Gaussian distribution is employed:<br><br>
where p(x) is the probability, Cn is the mixture coefficient and N(x,µ,s) is<br>
represented by the following formula:<br><br>
which is a standard Gaussian distribution with mean µ. and standard deviation a.<br>
Another solution to the problem of modeling the data to generate the KPI<br>
distributions is to use a Linear Ranking Model (LRM). Instead of modeling the<br>
distribution of each of the segments for each KPI, the LRM models the<br>
distribution in such a way that only the minimum and maximum boundaries need<br>
to be calculated. All values between these limits are then ranked according to<br>
their position between the minimum and maximum. This method has the<br>
advantage that it is distribution independent.<br>
One problem with the LRM is that is does not handle outlying data very well. For<br>
example, with reference to the Fill Production data shown in FIG 3, there is an<br>
amount of data to the right of the graph (caused possibly by abnormal cycles).<br>
The minimum and maximum values respectively on the abscissa are 0.33 and 34<br>
(units =mass per unit time interval) for this example. This means that the<br>
majority of the operators would obtain a low score and very few would obtain a<br>
high one since the majority of Fill Production values would occur in the lower half<br>
of the ranqe.<br>
A solution to this problem is to filter off the erroneous data. This can be achieved<br>
by removing data that is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean (keep<br>
99% of the data for true Gaussian curve). The new minimum and maximum are<br>
-0.70 and 17.6. The negative minimum would be set to zero and any values<br>
greater than the maximum are then deemed 100%.<br>
Another consideration is that most of the scores obtained by the operator will be<br>
around the average because we are modeling a Gaussian-like distribution using a<br>
linear model. That is, as most of the data is centred on the mean, the majority of<br>
the scores wili be around the mean. There is also the consideration that the<br>
scores are represented as a percentage, which no longer has a physical meaning.<br>
Instead, the operator will receive a score out of 10.<br>
The solution for the threshold problem is to calculate the thresholds in the office.<br>
The mean sets the lower threshold so that if the operator obtains a score below<br>
this then the operator is below average. For the upper threshold, the threshold<br>
for the top 10% of operators can be found. The data used to calculate these<br>
thresholds is all the data for each KPI without segmentation. The threshold is<br>
then the average score of the thresholds over the KPIs. This means that we have<br>
a set threshold for all KPIs and one that does not vary from cycle to cycle.<br>
The score for the KPI using the Linear Ranking Model is the ratio between the<br>
value and the difference of the minimum and maximum. This value is then<br>
multiplied by 10 to produce the KPI score. The following equation shows the<br>
calculations required:<br><br>
TABLE 1 below shows the advantages and disadvantages of the LRM and LBG<br>
methods for generating the distributions.<br>
The parameters represented by KPIs and their dependent parameters are:<br>
Swing Production = Load Weight / Swing Time<br>
Swing Angle<br>
Hoist Dependent Swings<br>
Fill Production = Load Weight / (Fill + Spot Times)<br>
Start Fill Reach<br>
Start Fill Height<br>
Return Time<br>
Swing Angle<br>
Production Performance<br>
This is a weighted sum of the 3 KPIs above.<br>
Machine Reliability<br>
Hence, there are 5 KPIs and 4 different dependent parameters. The Hoist<br>
Dependent Swings parameter does not require segmentation at all, as it is a<br>
Boolean. That leaves only 3 dependent parameters for which segmentation<br>
needs to be described.<br>
However, it will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to<br>
theparticular KPIs specified above, the number of KPIs, nor the different<br>
dependent parameters. It is envisaged that other parameters and KPIs and<br>
combinations thereof may be utilized in future, depending particularly on, for<br>
example, the particular application.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a segmentation resolution is set for<br>
each dependent parameter in the database structure, except for the Hoist<br>
Dependent Swings parameter as previously explained. The segmentation<br>
resolution specifies the relevant variable(s), such as distance, angle, and the like,<br>
for a single segment. For example, if the segmentation resolution for Swing<br>
Angle were 15 degrees, then data would be extracted for each 15-degree<br>
segment, as indicated in FIG 2. Only four segments are shown in FIG 2. A<br>
weighted sum of the first 3 KPIs may then be calculated to obtain an overall<br>
production performance rating.<br>
Segmentation is performed from a single known point (such as the origin in the<br>
case of the Start Fill Reach and Height). The data is then segmented from this<br>
point based on the segmentation resolution as explained above. Segments<br>
continue until the maximum or minimum limit is reached.<br>
For example, FIG 4 shows fill time data for different Fill Reaches and Heights. In<br>
the order of darkest to lightest shading of the data points, the points represent<br>
fill times, t, of t  30s. The segments<br>
would be divided such that they start at 0 cm and extend out to the 10,000 cm<br>
extremity for Fill Reach. For Fill Height, the segments would extend up to the<br>
1,000 cm extremity and down as far as the -3,500 cm extremity.<br>
The reason to perform the segmentation in this way is so that the distributions<br>
represent a fixed set of conditions even after a period of time. This way, data<br>
that was logged, for example, a month ago can be fairly compared with current<br>
distributions.<br>
Another setting for the KPIs related to the segmentation is the calculation of a<br>
probability from the distribution. If a better performance is achieved by a lower<br>
KPI value, the right side of the distribution needs to be calculated to obtain the<br>
KPI, as shown in FIG 5. The Return Time KPI is an example of such a KPI. The<br>
left side of the distribution is calculated when a KPI value is required to be higher<br>
to achieve better performance. The Swing Production and Fill Production KPIs<br>
are examples of such a KPI.<br>
FIG 6 shows the structure of an Integrated Mining Systems (IMS) system 2. A<br>
Series 3 Computer Module 4 and associated Display Module 6 are located in each<br>
machine being monitored on site. An IMS server 8 may also be located on site,<br>
for example in the site office, or it may be located at some other remote location<br>
providing communication within the Telemetry constraints is possible. The IMS<br>
server 8 comprises storage means in the form of a database 10, calculation<br>
means in the form of KPI distribution calculation module 12, communication<br>
means in the form of telemetry module 14 and application module 16 for the<br>
generation and editing of KPI reports.<br>
The Database 10 also needs to store the KPI Distributions that are generated<br>
from the cycle data. A number of distributions are stored in the Database 10.<br>
The first set of Distributions model the data for that machine for all operators. A<br>
set of Distributions will then exist for each operator. The feedback onboard can<br>
then be compared to all operators for that machine or to the currently logged on<br>
operator.<br>
An overview of the Database Structure is described below.<br>
TABLE 2 - KPI Configuration Information<br><br>
The KPI Configuration information describes the global settings used in the<br>
system as shown in TABLE 2. The KPI Parameter ID identifies the parameter<br>
used in the calculation of the distributions and the comparisons. The text<br>
description is used to display the KPI name on the Reports/Forms. The maximum<br>
number or mixtures is set here when using the LBG method. The maximum is<br>
likely to be 4, but this will probably vary depending on the KPI. The number of<br>
mixtures that are actually used can be smaller than this number. The Left or<br>
Right distribution value determines how to calculate the KPI onboard the<br>
machine. As discussed above with reference to FIG 5, if it is a left distribution,<br>
then it means that a higher KPI variable is required to obtain better performance,<br>
e.g. Return Time. A right distribution means that a lower KPI is required to<br>
obtain better performance, e.g. Swing Production. A moving average filter can be<br>
optionally applied to the KPI result.<br>
TABLE 3 Segment Information<br><br>
The Segment Information contains all the combinations of machines, dig modes,<br>
buckets, and operators in the mine for each KPI and associated segments as<br>
shown in TABLE 3. The KPI Distribution Calculation routine inserts all the entries<br>
into this table after it has determined the segmentation of the data. The<br>
segment ID identifies the segment for the current KPI, machine, dig mode, and<br>
the like.<br>
TABLE 4 Segmentation Offset Information<br>
The Segmentation Offset Information contains the offset values for dependent<br>
parameters associated with a KPI as shown in TABLE 4. These need to be<br>
configured for each machine for which KPI distribution calculations will be<br>
performed.<br>
TABLE 5 Dependency Information<br>
The Dependency Information contains the high and low limits for each<br>
dependent parameter within each segment and is calculated by the KPI<br>
Distribution Calculation routine.<br>
TABLE 6 Distribution Information for the LBG method<br>
The Distribution Information contains the distribution models for each of the<br>
segments. The information stored here depends on the distribution calculation<br>
method that is employed.<br>
For the LBG method, TABLE 6 shows the information that is used. For each<br>
segment the mixture weight, mean and standard deviation are stored for each<br>
mixture within the segment.<br>
TABLE 7 Distribution Information for the LRM method.<br>
For the LRM method, TABLE 7 shows the information that is used. For each<br>
segment the maximum and minimum distribution values are stored.<br>
TABLE 8 Parameter Link Information<br>
The Parameter Link information shown in TABLE 8 is used to allow parameters to<br>
be associated with a KPI. Values for associated parameters that are not<br>
dependent will be added to values for the KPI. Other parameters are dependent<br>
parameters.<br>
TABLE 9 Parameter Information<br>
The Parameter Information shown in TABLE 9 is used to identify the KPI<br>
Parameter ID with which the parameter is associated. This is used to identify<br>
which KPI parameter and dependent parameters are used in the modeling.<br>
The KPI Distribution Calculation routine is an NT service that is scheduled to run<br>
on a periodic basis.<br>
The program collects the data, segments it and calculates the distributions for<br>
each segment and stores the results in the Database 10. While this program is<br>
running, the system (mainly Telemetry module 14) knows not to acquire any of<br>
the data from any of the KPI tables. This is because this program may take an<br>
order of hours to calculate all the data. It may be necessary to set the priority of<br>
this task to low in the system in case the processing time is significant.<br>
The requirements for Telemetry are simple and would generally be familiar to a<br>
person skilled in the art. The onboard computer module 4 shown in FIG 6 needs<br>
to request the KPI parameters that are currently in the database, but only if they<br>
have been changed. The onboard module 4 will request the data, for example,<br>
every 8 hours. If the KPI Distribution Calculation routine is running then<br>
Telemetry needs to instruct the onboard module 4 to defer the request until<br>
later. It does this by setting a KPI timestamp in the reply packet to zero.<br>
The timestamp when the data was last changed is recorded in a table in the<br>
database. The onboard module 4 will send an initial KPI request packet as<br>
described later herein. Telemetry replies with the basic KPI configuration data<br>
and the timestamp of when the service last ran. If the service is running the<br>
timestamp is set to zero. The timestamp is also sent with every packet during<br>
the download so that if the service starts while downloading, the onboard<br>
module 4 can detect that the timestamp has gone to zero and it can abort the<br>
download.<br>
The Telemetry Packet Structures will now be described.<br>
The onboard module 4 sends a KPI Configuration Request packet to Telemetry<br>
module 14 to request the KPI configuration. Telemetry module 14 replies with a<br>
KPI Configuration packet, for which the contents are shown in Table 10. It places<br>
the timestamp in which the KPI Distribution Calculation Routine last ran into this<br>
packet. The onboard module then compares this timestamp with the one it has<br>
to see if it needs to start downloading the KPI segments.<br>
TABLE 10 - KPI Configuration Packet<br><br>
A KPI Segment Request packet, as shown below in Table 11, requests the data<br>
(distributions and the like) from Telemetry module 14. The reason for including<br>
the Dig Mode ID, bucket ID and the operator ID in the packet is to enable<br>
prioritization of the download of the KPI distributions if required.<br>
The first packet contains a segmenMndex of 1 to request the first segment and<br>
subsequent packets contain the next segment that the system wants. The<br>
requests stop when all the segments for that machine have been downloaded.<br>
TABLE 11 - KPI Segment Request packet<br><br>
A KPI Segment packet shown in Table 12 below is the reply to the KPI segment<br>
request packet. If there is no distribution for the segment, then the Distribution<br>
information contains nothing.<br>
TABLE 12 - KPI Segment packet<br><br>
The Series 3 Computer Module 4 shown in FIG 6 needs to download the KPI<br>
configuration and distribution information from the server 8, which is stored<br>
onboard in Flash memory. Once this information is downloaded, performance<br>
indicator calculation module 18 of onboard computer module 4 is responsible for<br>
calculating the KPI scores after every cycle as previously described herein. If the<br>
LBG algorithm method described above is being used, a Gaussian lookup table<br>
may be used to calculate the Gaussian curve instead of using the Gaussian<br>
distribution equation specified above.<br>
In order for the Series 3 Computer Module 4 to calculate the operator's score, it<br>
firstly selects the distribution by determining the segment that the current cycle<br>
matches for the particular KPI. Once the distribution has been found, then the<br>
KPI score can be calculated. If there exists no distribution to calculate a KPI,<br>
then the KPI score will be 100% (or 10 if the LRM is being used).<br>
The scores for all the KPIs are calculated for both the mine and current operator<br>
comparison. Therefore, there are 2 scores that need to be calculated for every<br>
KPL<br>
The KPI can be displayed on display module 6 as a real-time parameter in the<br>
parameter list on a STATS screen. It may also be displayed as a trend so that the<br>
operator can see any performance improvements or deteriorations. The trend<br>
may be configured by the operator to show the graph for the last hour or the<br>
current shift or other suitable period. This is performed using the KPI trend<br>
configuration that is displayed once the operator selects one of the trend graphs<br>
from a menu displayed on the STATS screen.<br>
A third option is to display a KPI indicator that is again selected in the trend<br>
configuration. Three different designs for the indicator are shown in FIGS 7-9<br>
The KPI indicator could appear white against a black background to enhance<br>
visibility. FIG 7 shows the current real-time performance. The arrows above<br>
each KPI indicate whether or not the score has improved from the last cycle.<br>
The extent to which the KPI has improved or deteriorated may also be shown.<br>
FIG 8 shows an alternative method of displaying the real-time KPI scores for<br>
each of the KPI variables including an overall performance rating, which may be<br>
the average of the KPI variables. FIG 9 shows an alternative way of displaying<br>
the scores for the previous cycle so that the operator can judge any<br>
improvements or deteriorations from cycle to cycle. This version could include<br>
more than just the last cycle.<br>
The IMS Application module 16 preferably supports editing of at least some of<br>
the KPI Parameters. The following parameters need to be available to an<br>
administrator for editing: KPI text description; the setting of the good and<br>
average thresholds for the KPI indicator; frequency of running the KPI<br>
Distribution Calculation routine (KPI Statistical Generator); number of days of<br>
previous data to be used to create the models; display of the last time the KPI<br>
data was updated and the like.<br>
Reports, such as an Operator Performance Trend Report and an Operator<br>
Ranking Report, as shown in FIG 10 and FIG 11 respectively, may also be<br>
generated from the Report Manager in the IMS Application.<br>
The Operator Performance Trend report shows the graphical trend of an<br>
operator for each of the selected KPI variables. The options that should be made<br>
to the person generating this report should include: Sort by machine, Sort by dig<br>
mode, Sort by bucket, Set Time period, Number of operators to show (top,<br>
specified number or all) and The KPIs to show.<br>
The Operator Performance Trend report needs to calculate the KPI values over<br>
the selected time period based on the distributions contained in the Database at<br>
the time. Therefore, the KPI scores need to be calculated again. The reason for<br>
this is that the scores that were shown to the operator onboard are no longer<br>
valid because the distributions would have changed during that time and<br>
therefore cannot be compared to each other. Because the Report Manager has<br>
to do these calculations, the report may take a long time. Therefore, the time<br>
period over which the trends are calculated will have to be limited.<br>
The Operator Ranking report displays the ranking of operators for each of the<br>
KPIs. That is, for a particular KPI or all KPIs, it displays the ranking of all the<br>
operators. The time period needs to be selected and, as for the previous report,<br>
this time period will have to be limited as the report may take a long time to run.<br>
This report needs to calculate what the previous report calculated, but needs to<br>
average the output scores.<br>
The options that should be made to the person generating this report should<br>
include: Sort by machine, Sort by dig mode, Set Time period, Number of<br>
operators to show (top, specified number or all), The KPIs to show.<br>
An Average Production KPI may be provided that may be calculated remotely<br>
and downloaded to the Series 3 computer module 6 in the machine. This may be<br>
displayed on the performance graphs to show the operator their current<br>
performance relative to their average. This value can be downloaded along with<br>
the operator ID lists.<br>
Current practice used by all mines estimating operator performance on the basis<br>
of Productivity appears to be wrong. Under different conditions and production<br>
plans some of the operators could be disadvantaged against others. For<br>
example, if an operator works in the same conditions, but with different swing<br>
angles from another operator, productivity shown for the greater swing angle will<br>
be less than for smaller swing angle, even though the first operator may in<br>
reality be more efficient.<br>
Taking into account that the number of effecting factors could include a number<br>
of other parameters, the applicant has identified that in order to be able to<br>
compare productivity ranks of the same operator under different conditions,<br>
some integrated value that could be used for ranking purposes should be used.<br>
In order to be able to calculate average rank for operators working under<br>
different conditions, integrating performance ranks achieved under different<br>
conditions by different operators should be considered on the one hand and<br>
mine interests and production performance should be considered on another<br>
hand.<br>
The suggested method of the present invention in this regard will include these 2<br>
parameters as variables and will allow calculation of average operator rank,<br>
which could be used as a universal rank among the mine for different machines,<br>
conditions and production plans.<br>
The formula for calculation of average operator rank is presented below:<br>
Av Op Rank = W1 * R1 + W2*R2+....+ Wi*Ri<br>
where:<br>
Wi - Weight coefficient for Parameter Subset i, which is calculated on the basis<br>
of statistical information for the mine indicating the weight of i Parameter subset<br>
for the mine applicable to operator I; and<br>
Ri - Rank of the operator i achieved for this Parameter Subset i.<br>
For example, let it be assumed that during a reporting period a mine used only<br>
four different subsets of parameters. The weight of each subset could<br>
respectively be the following: 25%, 20%, 40% andl5%. If operator #1 worked<br>
only under subset #1 and # 2 and achieved 90% for subset # 1 and 94% for<br>
subset #2, using the above formula the average rank for the operator may be<br>
calculated:<br><br>
For Operator # 2, subset #3 = 92% and subset # 4 = 90%. Hence:<br><br>
These Productivity ranks do not include Production figures and only rank<br>
operators for different subsets of parameters. In reality, if, for example, operator<br>
#1 was doing cycles with swings of say 10 and 20 degrees and operator #2<br>
swings of say 170 and 180 degrees, then the real production for operator #1<br>
could be twice as much as for operator # 2, but in fact the rank of operator # 1<br>
is higher and accordingly he is better.<br>
It is also conceivable that the average performance of an operator over the last<br>
week or month could be shown. The average performance could be calculated<br>
remotely and the onboard module would download it to the machine for every<br>
operator. It would be treated just as a list download where one radio packet<br>
represents one graph. Only the minimum and maximum values need to be sent<br>
and then each of the data points can be percentage scaled.<br>
Accurately determining one or more of the KPIs in accordance with the present<br>
invention addresses the difficulties of accurately measuring relevant parameters<br>
and producing fair comparisons. The present invention can be used to improve<br>
awareness of how well the operators are performing and provide an incentive to<br>
improve performance. It also provides an indication to management about who<br>
is performing well and which operators are not performing up to standard.<br>
Throughout the specification the aim has been to describe the invention without<br>
limiting the invention to any one embodiment or specific collection of features.<br>
Persons skilled in the relevant art may realize variations from the specific<br>
embodiments that will nonetheless fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
