				<td>A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROCESSING<br>
METAL-BEARING SLUDGE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method as defined in the preamble of claim 1<br>
and an apparatus as defined in the preamble of claim 13 for processing a metal-<br>
bearing sludge in conjunction with metal separation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A sludge is herein used to mean a precipitate, a deposit, a solid matter-rich<br>
solution, etc. the dry matter content of which can vary from a nearly solution-like<br>
one to a solid one.<br>
Known in prior art are many various metal separation processes for<br>
separating the desired metal from the other material e.g. in conjunction with metal<br>
manufacturing or metal recycling. In metal separation, the metal can be separated<br>
or removed from the material mixture. Metals can be separated by dissolving,<br>
precipitating e.g. with a suitable reagent, by forming compounds such as<br>
sulphides or oxides, electrolytically, by settling, filtering, distilling or extracting or in<br>
a corresponding manner. The separated metal can be in a solution-like, sludge-<br>
like or solid state. In several metal processing processes, metal-bearing sludge is<br>
formed as a result of separation. At least a part of this kind of sludge could be<br>
utilised. While in one fraction, the sludge cannot be utilised as well as possible,<br>
and no suitable methods are known for utilising a part of the sludge.<br>
Known in prior art are various metal separation and metal removing<br>
methods in the field of metal manufacturing. Examples of separation methods<br>
that are performed in a solution phase include precipitation methods of copper,<br>
cobalt and nickel in conjunction with zinc preparation. To improve the precipitation<br><br>
efficiency of the desired metal, the solution must<br>
contain, as an activator or crystallisation core, at<br>
least one metal compound, and often as a compound,<br>
also metal precipitated in the process, which compound<br>
can be preferably recycled in the metal manufacturing<br>
processes. The metal compounds in question activate<br>
the separation of metal and function as a solid matter<br>
surface for the metal to be precipitated. The precipi-<br>
tated end product or a property thereof in the pre-<br>
cipitation solution can often be used to accelerate<br>
the precipitation rate of metal. The surfaces of the<br>
metal compound particles of the recycled, precipitated<br>
sludge must be purified in order that they can func-<br>
tion as good activators in the process. However, there<br>
is a problem that the sludge particles usually circu-<br>
late or linger in the metal separation processes so<br>
long that there are non-desired impurities deposited<br>
on their surfaces, passivating the sludge, or they are<br>
agglomerated, forming bigger complexes, which makes<br>
the mixing of the reactor more difficult. There is a<br>
problem that the recycled, precipitated sludge is in<br>
one fraction, whereby the amount of the so-called ac-<br>
tive part is small with respect to the total amount,<br>
and if the amount of the active part is increased,<br>
then the total amount of deposit is also increased,<br>
the increased amount of deposit slowing and hindering<br>
the precipitation reactions of metal. Furthermore, the<br>
problem with the prior-art processes is that the<br>
sludge settled on the surface of the precipitation re-<br>
actor or concentrator is recycled as a underflow,<br>
whereby specifically the big particles, i.e. the more<br>
passive material, is recycled back to the process.<br>
Specifically in cobalt removal, the sludge<br>
remains long in the precipitation reactor, whereby<br>
calcium sulphate starts to deposit on the surface of<br>
the sludge particles, while passivating the sludge<br>
particles and increasing their size.<br><br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the invention is to elimi-<br>
nate the drawbacks referred to above. One specific ob-<br>
jective of the invention is to disclose a new classi-<br>
fication method and apparatus for dividing the sludge<br>
into a better fraction for recycling and a worse frac-<br>
tion for removal from the reactor, as the reaction is<br>
concerned. One further objective of the invention is<br>
to disclose a novel method and apparatus for enhancing<br>
and improving the metal separation process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The method and apparatus in accordance with<br>
the invention are characterised by what has been pre-<br>
sented in the claims.<br>
The invention is based on a method for proc-<br>
essing a metal-bearing sludge in conjunction with a<br>
metal separation process. According to the invention,<br>
the sludge created in the metal separation is classi-<br>
fied, as the process is concerned, into a better and a<br>
worse substance fraction based on a predetermined<br>
property of the sludge, and the worse substance frac-<br>
tion is removed from the process and the better sub-<br>
stance fraction is returned back to the process.<br>
The invention is based on the basic idea that<br>
from the sludge created in metal separation, the de-<br>
sired and non-desired fraction are separated by clas-<br>
sifying, preferably using an apparatus based on the<br>
centrifugal force. The classification in accordance<br>
with the invention is performed for a sludge already<br>
separated, preferably precipitated. The amount and<br>
particle size of the solid matter to be recycled in a<br>
metal separation process is controlled and regulated<br>
by removing a big part of the non-desired passive<br>
fraction from the reactor and by returning a suitable<br><br>
amount of the desired fraction back to the process. At<br>
the same time there is an attempt to maintain and<br>
strengthen the surface active properties of the metal-<br>
bearing sludge to be recycled.<br>
The invention enables one to recycle the de-<br>
sired active material in the process and to remove the<br>
non-desired, often passive, material from the process.<br>
The invention enables one to adjust the solid matter<br>
content of the reactor to be suitable from the stand-<br>
point of the process. Furthermore, it is possible to<br>
maintain and even improve the desired properties of<br>
the sludge.<br>
In one embodiment, the solid matter content<br>
of the reactor preferably is 10-200 g/1, more prefera-<br>
bly 30-100 g/1. In that case, a lot of active reaction<br>
surface is achieved that accelerates the precipitation<br>
and contributes to the reduction of the consumption of<br>
the zinc powder to be introduced.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
sludge is settled in conjunction with the metal sepa-<br>
ration prior to the classification. The sludge can be<br>
a underflow of the metal separation reactor or a un-<br>
derflow of the concentrator.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the classification is based on the surface activity of<br>
the sludge particles. In one embodiment of the inven-<br>
tion, the classification is performed based on the<br>
granular size of the sludge particles by dividing the<br>
sludge into a coarser and more fine-grained fraction.<br>
As presented above, in one embodiment, the surface ac-<br>
tivity preferably depends on the granular size, ena-<br>
bling one to perform the classification based on the<br>
granular size, although a good surface activity spe-<br>
cifically is a desired property in the fraction to be<br>
recycled.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the clas-<br>
sification is performed using an apparatus based on<br><br>
the centrifugal force, e.g. a hydrocyclone or the<br>
like. In one embodiment, it is possible to use as the<br>
classifier a separator based on the centrifugal force,<br>
such as e.g. the Lakos separator by Lakos-Laval. In<br>
that case, it is possible to achieve a underflow into<br>
which the big particles introduced into the classifier<br>
become concentrated nearly completely.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the un-<br>
derflow of the classifying apparatus is the worse<br>
fraction from the standpoint of the process. The un-<br>
derflow is removed from the process either completely,<br>
or the desired part of the underflow is removed. In<br>
one embodiment, the overflow is the better fraction<br>
from the standpoint of the process. The amount of the<br>
overflow and underflow can be regulated using process-<br>
technical changes. The classification limit size is<br>
determined beforehand, being preferably close to the<br>
basic particle size.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the underflow<br>
is the better fraction from the standpoint of the pro-<br>
cess and the overflow the worse fraction.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the worse fraction from the standpoint of the inven-<br>
tion mainly consists of a coarse fraction, and the<br>
better fraction mainly consists of a fine fraction,<br>
which can, however, contain a small amount of coarse<br>
particles.<br>
The embodiments of the invention enable one<br>
to achieve in the process the desired and correct<br>
solid matter content. The invention has the advantage<br>
that e.g. big particles can be removed from the proc-<br>
ess, because they usually make the mixing more diffi-<br>
cult and are passive as the metal separation is con-<br>
cerned .<br>
Alternatively, the classification can be<br>
based on settling based on the size and/or density,<br>
screening or the like.<br><br>
The classification can be performed either in<br>
batches or continuously, partly depending on whether<br>
the sludge is removed from the metal separation reac-<br>
tor in batches or continuously.<br>
Further, the invention relates to an appara-<br>
tus for classifying a metal-bearing sludge in conjunc-<br>
tion with a metal separation process including one or<br>
more metal separation reactors, a feeding device for<br>
introducing the raw material into the metal separation<br>
reactor and a junction line for removing the sludge<br>
created in the metal separation from the reactor. Ac-<br>
cording to the invention, the apparatus includes a<br>
classification device which is arranged in conjunction<br>
with the pipe from the metal separation reactor and<br>
which is arranged for classifying the sludge based on<br>
a predetermined property into a better and worse sub-<br>
stance fraction from the standpoint of the process,<br>
and recycling means for returning the better substance<br>
fraction to the metal separation reactor, and means<br>
for removing the worse substance fraction from the re-<br>
actor.<br>
The apparatus in accordance with the inven-<br>
tion is simple in respect of its structure, and thus<br>
advantageous to implement.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to the use<br>
of a method and apparatus in accordance with the in-<br>
vention in a hydrometallurgic zinc preparation process<br>
in which zinc-bearing ore is preferably concentrated,<br>
roasted and dissolved in sulphuric acid. Besides zinc,<br>
also copper, cobalt, nickel and cadmium as well as<br>
germanium and antimony are released in the dissolu-<br>
tion. These metals or semi-metals, i.e. impurities,<br>
are removed from the solution by reduction using zinc<br>
powder in a solution purification process. The separa-<br>
tion of these metals can be performed by precipitating<br>
in one or more phases from a zinc-bearing solution.<br>
According to the invention, the precipitated metals<br><br>
are classified as desired, and the desired fraction is<br>
returned to the process to facilitate and improve the<br>
separation of metals. After the aforementioned metals<br>
have been separated, the zinc is electrolytically re-<br>
duced from a zinc sulphate solution. In zinc prepara-<br>
tion, the impurities must be removed from a zinc-<br>
bearing material to achieve a successful and efficient<br>
electrolysis to reduce zinc. Particularly the metal<br>
ions Co2+ and Ni2+ of the iron group promote the re-<br>
dissolving of zinc that stratifies in the electroly-<br>
sis, resulting in a decrease of the efficiency of<br>
electric current.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the invention<br>
relates to the use of a method and apparatus in accor-<br>
dance with the invention in a cobalt removing process<br>
in conjunction with zinc preparation. In conjunction<br>
with a cobalt removing process it is possible to pre-<br>
cipitate also e.g. nickel, germanium and antimony. In<br>
a cobalt removing process, preferably an activator<br>
such as e.g. arsenic oxide is used to promote the pre-<br>
cipitation of metals from a zinc-bearing solution. For<br>
example, in the presence of arsenic, cobalt and nickel<br>
can be precipitated relatively fast, in about 1.5<br>
hours, to form cobalt and nickel arsenic. Besides ar-<br>
senic, the solution preferably contains residual cop-<br>
per and recycled, produced cobalt deposit, which im-<br>
prove and accelerate the precipitation of cobalt. The<br>
precipitated cobalt deposit is classified as presented<br>
in the invention, and the desired fraction is recycled<br>
in the process to improve the precipitation of cobalt.<br>
The cobalt removing process can be a continu-<br>
ous one or of the batch type. There must be enough<br>
solid matter in the precipitation process on whose<br>
surface the impurities precipitate. The surface must<br>
be purified metallic copper, or copper, cobalt or<br>
nickel arsenic to improve and activate the precipita-<br>
tion. The impurities that precipitate on the surface<br><br>
of the particles, such as basic zinc sulphates and<br>
calcium sulphate, passivate the deposit and increase<br>
the particle size.<br>
Alternatively, the method and apparatus in<br>
accordance with the invention can also be used for the<br>
separation and removal of other metals in the manufac-<br>
turing, recycling of metals, and other metal separa-<br>
tion processes.<br>
LIST OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
In the following section, the invention will<br>
be described by means of detailed embodiments with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Pig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a hy-<br>
drometallurgic zinc preparation process; and<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram illustrating one appara-<br>
tus embodiment in accordance with the invention in a<br>
cobalt removing process.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows a hydrometallurgical zinc prepa-<br>
ration process. In a hydrometallurgical zinc prepara-<br>
tion process, zinc ore is first concentrated 1, and<br>
the zinc concentrate is roasted 2. The purpose of the<br>
roasting 2 is to bring the sulphidic zinc into a solu-<br>
ble oxide form. After the roasting 2, the zinc roast<br>
is dissolved into sulphuric acid in one or more phases<br>
3, whereby the zinc oxides react to form zinc sul-<br>
phate. In a dissolution phase 3, iron is precipitated<br>
as a basic sulphate, i.e. as a jarosite precipitate.<br>
In a dissolution phase 3, the dissolved impurities,<br>
e.g. copper, cobalt, nickel, germanium, antimony and<br>
cadmium, are removed from the zinc sulphate solution<br>
in solution purification 4, which is preferably per-<br>
formed in three phases 6, 7, 8. In the first phase 6,<br><br>
the copper is removed by means of zinc dust 9. In the<br>
second phase 7, cobalt, nickel, germanium, antimony<br>
and the rest of the copper are removed from the solu-<br>
tion by means of arsenic trioxide 10 and zinc dust 9<br>
as metal arsenics, whereby zinc functions as a re-<br>
ducer. In the third phase 8, cadmium is removed by<br>
means of zinc dust 9. The purified zinc solution is<br>
introduced via cooling into electrolysis 5, wherein it<br>
is mixed with a circulating electrolyte. In the elec-<br>
trolysis 5, the zinc is reduced by means of cathodes.<br>
The roasting, dissolution and electrolysis are per-<br>
formed in a manner known per se in the field, so they<br>
are not described more fully herein.<br>
In the cobalt removal shown in Fig. 2, co-<br>
balt, nickel, germanium, antimony and residual copper<br>
are precipitated from the zinc sulphate solution 18 in<br>
many phases in reactors 11, 12, the capacity of which<br>
is e.g. 200-300 m3. The cobalt deposit 13 formed in<br>
the precipitation reactor 11 and/or 12 is classified<br>
using the classification device 14 in accordance with<br>
the invention, and the fraction 15 that is desired<br>
from the standpoint of the process is recycled back<br>
into the first reactor 11 of the process.<br>
In the precipitation of cobalt, zinc powder,<br>
copper ions and preferably arsenic trioxides are used.<br>
Alternatively, instead of arsenic trioxide it is pos-<br>
sible to use e.g. antimony trioxide or potassium anti-<br>
mony tartrate. The copper ions originate from the cop-<br>
per removing phase in which the residual copper is<br>
left in the zinc sulphate solution to function as a<br>
reagent for cobalt removal. The amount of residual<br>
copper to be left in the solution preferably ranges<br>
between 50-300 mg/1. The residual copper precipitates<br>
with arsenic as copper arsenic in the presence of the<br>
reducing action of zinc powder. The copper arsenic re-<br>
acts in the solution with cobalt and nickel in the<br>
presence of zinc powder to form cobalt and nickel ar-<br><br>
senic. The zinc powder and arsenic trioxide are intro-<br>
duced into the first cobalt removing reactor 11 by<br>
means of feeding devices known per se in the field. It<br>
is not preferred to use a big stoichiometric excess of<br>
zinc powder due to the creation of a non-desired side<br>
reaction; the excess of zinc does not thus add to the<br>
precipitation rate. Furthermore, in cobalt removal,<br>
the desired fraction 15 of precipitated cobalt deposit<br>
is recycled in cobalt removal, the desired fraction<br>
functioning in the reactor as a substance activating<br>
the reaction besides zinc powder and arsenic trioxide.<br>
In cobalt removal, the temperature and precipitation<br>
surface affect the precipitation rate. The precipita-<br>
tion surface is in practice dependant on the deposit<br>
content, although is not a linear function of it, ow-<br>
ing at least partly to the purification degree of the<br>
surface of the particles in the deposit. A specific<br>
surface of a deposit is a prior-art way of roughly de-<br>
scribing the absorption or absorption capability prop-<br>
erties, i.e. the surface activity of a deposit. The<br>
precipitation rate can be increased by increasing the<br>
amount of deposit in the reactor and/or the quality of<br>
deposit, as well as by raising the temperature in the<br>
reactor.<br>
In the precipitation reactor 11 and/or 12,<br>
the produced cobalt arsenic deposit is settled on the<br>
bottom of the reactor, from which it is introduced in<br>
batches or continuously as a underflow, via a junction<br>
line 12 and a pump 20, to a classification device 14,<br>
which in this embodiment is a Lakos separator of the<br>
hydrocyclone type. The cobalt arsenic deposit to be<br>
introduced into the classification device contains<br>
e.g. 150-200 g/1 solid matter. By means of the classi-<br>
fication device 14, the cobalt arsenic deposit 13 is<br>
divided, in batches, into a better 15 and a worse 17<br>
fraction from the standpoint of the process based on<br>
the surface activity of the deposit particles. The<br><br>
better fraction 15 is obtained as an overflow of the<br>
classification device 14, and it contains mainly more<br>
fine-grained deposit particles and a few coarse parti-<br>
cles. The worse fraction 17 is obtained as a under-<br>
flow, and it contains mainly coarse deposit particles.<br>
The distribution and granular size of the overflow and<br>
underflow can be regulated as desired. The better<br>
fraction 15 is recycled mainly completely back to the<br>
cobalt precipitation 11. The cobalt deposit is recy-<br>
cled so that the solid matter content of the cobalt<br>
removal reactor(s) is about 10-200 g/1, preferably 30-<br>
100 g/1. If desired or necessary, a part 16 of the<br>
better fraction can be led out of the process. The<br>
worse fraction 17 is removed from the classification<br>
device 14 and process in batches. The removal density<br>
of the overflow can be regulated as desired.<br>
Depending on the amount of the metals to be<br>
precipitated, the delay time of the better fraction of<br>
the cobalt deposit in the cobalt removing reactors can<br>
be about 1-2 months.<br>
Alternatively, cobalt arsenic deposit can be<br>
lead in one fraction 21 back to the first reactor 11,<br>
or as an overflow 22 of the reactor out of the proc-<br>
ess, e.g. in conjunction with a process malfunction.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
In this test, fine-grained cobalt deposit,<br>
arsenic trioxide and zinc powder collected from the<br>
filter after the cobalt removal were roasted into the<br>
cobalt precipitation reactor. A supply in the form of<br>
zinc sulphate solution containing cobalt, nickel, ger-<br>
manium, antimony and residual copper (about 150 mg/1)<br>
from the copper removal phase was introduced into the<br>
reactor.<br><br>
The metal impurities referred to above pre-<br>
cipitated well, and the mixing of the reactor func-<br>
tioned well.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In this test, cobalt deposit was introduced<br>
continuously from the cobalt removing reactor into the<br>
classification device with a flow of 18-20 m3/h. The<br>
solid matter content of the feed was about 150-200<br>
9/1.<br>
As an overflow of the classifying device, a<br>
sludge having a solid matter content of 1400 g/1 was<br>
obtained. The flow of the overflow was 0.5-0.6 m2/h<br>
and mean granular size d(0.5) was 93.7 µm. The d(0.5)<br>
value of the overflow was 75.5 µm . The underflow con-<br>
tained particles smaller than 60 µm only about 3.5%,<br>
and the overflow contained particles smaller than 60<br>
µm about 33%. Although the mean granular sizes of the<br>
overflow and underflow flows did not much differ from<br>
each other, the classification of a fine-grained mate-<br>
rial into an overflow was almost complete.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In this test, cobalt deposit was introduced<br>
from a cobalt removing reactor other than in Example 2<br>
continuously into the classification device with the<br>
flow of 18-20 m3/h. The solid matter content of the<br>
feed was about 150-200 g/1.<br>
As a underflow of the classification device,<br>
a sludge having a solid matter content of 900 g/1 was<br>
obtained. The flow of the underflow was 0.5-0.6 m3/h<br>
and mean granular size d(0.5) was 88.5 µm. The d(0.5)<br>
value of the overflow was 17.4 µm. The underflow con-<br>
tained particles smaller than 60 µm about 18%, and the<br>
overflow correspondingly about 93%. A underflow flow<br><br>
is, however, small compared to the flow of an over-<br>
flow, whereby a main part of the fine-grained material<br>
is classified as an overflow.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
In this test, cobalt deposit was introduced<br>
from a cobalt removing reactor other than in Examples<br>
2 and 3 continuously into the classification device<br>
with a flow of 18-20 m3/h. The solid matter content of<br>
the feed was about 150-200 g/1.<br>
As a underflow of the classification device,<br>
a sludge having a solid matter content of 600-700 g/1<br>
was obtained. The flow of the underflow was 0.5-0.6<br>
m3/h and mean granular size d(0.5) was 36.3 µm. The<br>
d(0.5) value of the overflow was 13.7 µm. The under-<br>
flow contained particles smaller than 30 µm about 46%,<br>
and the overflow correspondingly about 86%. In this<br>
example, the cobalt deposit to be introduced was more<br>
fine-grained than in Examples 2 and 3.<br>
The method and apparatus in accordance with<br>
the invention are applicable, in various embodiments,<br>
to the classification of various metal sludges in<br>
various processes.<br>
The embodiments of the invention are not lim-<br>
ited to the examples referred to above, instead they<br>
can vary in the scope of the accompanying claims.<br><br><br>
