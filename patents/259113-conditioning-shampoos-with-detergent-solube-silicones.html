				<td>CONDITIONING SHAMPOOS WITH DETERGENT SOLUBLE SILICONES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to improved conditioning shampoos that maybe made without stabilizing agents for silicones.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A variety of conditioning shampoos (also called "2-in-l shampoos") have been sold and/or described in the patent literature. These products characteristically include an insoluble silicone such as dimethicone in combination with some type of stabilizing agent. The stabilizing agents that have been used have included, for example, ethylene glycol distearate (which is also a pearlizing agent), long chain alcohols such as those having C20-40 carbons (commonly referred to as "Unilin" technology), behenyi alcohol, selected acrylates such as ACULYN-33, and other systems such as cetearyl alcohol mixtures. Some of the stabilizers require heat in the manufacturing processes and others made be made at room temperature.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5,945,093 describes an improved stable conditioning shampoo imparts improved physical and cosmetic properties to the hair such as wet and dry comb, wet and dry feel, gloss, static control and manageability, yet does not cause build-up and does not contain any polyhydric compounds. The shampoo includes an anionic surfactant, a water soluble cationic surfactant, a water-insoluble conditioning agent, and a suspending agent where the suspending agent is a mixture of a cellulose derivative and a PVM/MA .decadiene cross polymer. The conditioning shampoo is stable for extended periods.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5,932,203 describes conditioning shampoo compositions which comprise (A) an anionic surfactant component selected from the group consisting of anionic surfactants, zwitterionic or amphoteric surfactants having an attached group that is anionic at (he pH of the composition (B) an organic, cationic, hair conditioning polymer, (C) a selected water insoluble, synthetic ester; and (D) water.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,287,546 describes improved stabilized shampoo compositions containing siloxysilicate materials commonly referred to as MQ resins, wherein the stabilizers are selected from (i) long chain fatty alcohols with greater than 14 carbons; (ii) acrylates/steareth-20 methacrylate copolymer, acrylates copolymer; and acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acryiate cross polymer; and (iii) selected N,N-disubstituted phthalamic acids and their ammonium salts.<br><br>
Of course the use of soluble silicones can be complex if a product is to be obtained that does not rinse the soluble silicone down the drain during shampooing. Thus, there remains a need for conditioning shampoos that can deliver a higher degree of conditioning. There is also a need for conditioning shampoos that can be made in part or in whole without the need for stabilizing agents required for insoluble silicone materials. Yet another object is to create conditioning shampoos that can use soluble silicones and still achieve good conditioning.<br>

The silicone hair conditioning agent comprises a nonvolatile, insoluble, silicone fluid and optionally comprises a silicone gum which is insoluble in the shampoo composition as a whole but is soluble in the, silicone fluid. The silicone hair conditioning agent can also comprise other ingredients, such as a silicone resin to enhance deposition efficiency. These insoluble silicones have particular viscosities of from about 200 to about 2,000,000 centistokes at 25 degrees C., more particularly from about 1,000 to about 1,800,000, even more particularly from about 10,000 to about 1,500,000 cst The viscosity can be measured by means of a glass capillary viscometer as set forth in Dow Coming Corporate test method CTM0004, July 20,1970.<br>
The insoluble silicone hair conditioning agent may be used in the shampoo compositions hereof at levels of from about 0 weight % to about 8 weight % based on the weight of the composition, particularly from about 0.5 weight % to about 4 weight%.<br>
Suitable insoluble, nonvolatile silicone fluids include polyalkyl siloxanes, polyaryl siloxanes, polyalkylaryl siloxanes, polyether siloxane copolymers, and mixtures thereof. Other insoluble, nonvolatile silicones fluids having hair conditioning<br>
properties can also be used. The term "nonvolatile" as used herein shall mean that the silicone material exhibits very low or no significant vapor pressure at ambient conditions, as is understood by those in the art The term "silicone fluid" shall mean flowabJe silicone materials having a viscosity of less than 1,000,000 centistokes at 25 degrees C. Generally, the viscosity of the fluid will be between about 5 and 1,000,000 centistokes at 25 degrees C., preferably between about 10 and about 100,000 centistokes.<br>
The nonvolatile polyalkylsiloxane fluids that maybe used include, for example, polydimethyl siloxanes. These siloxanes are available, for example, from the General Electric Company in their Viscasil® and SF 96 series, and from Dow Coming in their Dow Coming 200 series.<br>
The polyalkylaryl siloxane fluids that may be used, also include, for example, polvmethylphenylsiloxanes. These siloxanes are available, for example, from the General Electric Company as SF 1075 methyl phenyl fluid or from Dow Coming as 556 Cosmetic Grade Fluid.<br>
The polyether siloxane copolymers that may be used include, for example, a polypropylene oxide modified polydimethylsiloxane (for example, Dow Corning DC-1248) although ethylene oxide or mixtures of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide may also be used. The ethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide level must be sufficiently low to prevent solubility in water and the composition hereof.<br>
References disclosing suitable silicone fluids include U.S. Patent Number 2,826,551, Geen; U.S. Patent Number 3,964,500, Drakoff; U.S. Patent Number 4,364,837, Pader; U.S. Patent Number 5,573,709, Wells; British Patent 849,433, Woolston; and PCT Patent Application WO 93/08787. All of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties as to descriptions of such silicone materials.<br>
Another silicone material that can be especially useful in the silicone conditioning agents is insoluble silicone gum. The term "silicone gum", as used herein, means poryorganosiloxane materials having a viscosity at 25 degrees C of greater than or equal to 1,000,000 centistokes. Silicone gums are described in U.S. Patent Number 4,152,416, Spitzer et al; and in Noll, Walter, Chemistry and<br>
New York: Academic Press 1968. Also describing silicone gums are General Electric Silicone Rubber Product Data Sheets SE 30, SE 33, SE 54 and SE 76. All of these described references are incorporated herein by reference. The "silicone gums" will typically have a mass molecular weight in excess of about 200,000, generally between<br>
about 200,000 and about 1,000,000. Specific examples include polydimethylsiloxane, (polydimethyl siloxane) (methylvinylsiloxane) copolymer, poly(dimethyl siloxane) (diphenyl siloxane)(metliylvinylsiloxane) copolymer and mixtures thereof.<br>
Another optional ingredient that can be included in the shampoo is silicone resin. Silicone resins are highly crosslinked polymeric siloxane systems. The crosslinkJng is introduced through the incorporation of trifunctional and tetrafunctional silanes with monofunctional or difunctional, or both, silanes during manufacture of the silicone resin. As is well understood in the art, the degree of crosslinkJng that is required in order to result in a silicone resin will vary according to the specific silane units incorporated into the silicone resin. The ratio of oxygen atoms to silicon atoms is indicative of the level of crosslinking in a particular silicone material. Silanes used in the manufacture of silicone resins include monomethyl-, dimethyl-, trimethyl-, monophenyl-, diphenyl-, methylphenyi-, monovinyl-, and rnethylvinyl-chlorosilanes, and tetrachlorosilane, with the methyl-substituted silanes being most commonly utilized. Preferred resins are offered by General Electric as GE SR399, SS4230 and SS4267. Commercially available silicone resins may be supplied in a dissolved form in a low viscosity volatile or nonvolatile silicone fluid.<br>
Background material on silicones including sections discussing silicone fluids, gums, and resins, as well as manufacture of silicones, can be found in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering. Volume 15, Second Edition, pages 294-308, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1989.<br>
Silicone materials and silicone resins in particular, can conveniently be identified according to a shorthand nomenclature system well known to those skilled in the art as "MDTQ" nomenclature. Under this system, the silicone is described according to presence of various siloxane monomer units which make up the silicone. Briefly, the symbol M denotes the monofunctional unit (CH^s SiOo.s; D denotes the difunctional unit (CH3)2 SiO, T denotes the trifunctional unit (CH3)SiOu; and Q denotes the quadri- or tetra-functional unit SiCh- Primes of the unit symbols, D', T, and Q' denote substituents other than methyl, and must be specifically defined for each occurrence. Typical alternate substituents include groups such as vinyl, phenyls, amines, hydroxyls, etc. The molar ratios of the various units, either in terms of subscripts to the symbols indicating the total number of each type of unit in the silicone (or an average thereof) or as specifically indicated ratios in combination with molecular weight complete the description of the silicone material under the MDTQ system.<br><br>
