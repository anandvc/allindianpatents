				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns the general field of take-off needles adapted to be inserted or pricked through an elastic wall or septum in order to take off liquid contained in a container closed by the wall/septum.<br>
The invention more particularly concerns such a take-off needle which comprises a hollow lance generally formed from a fine steel tube provided at its distal end with a sharp insertion tip and connected to a pipe by its proximal end.<br>
The tip is thus adapted to pass through said elastic wall to enable the liquid to flow in the hollow lance towards the pipe which comprises a spigot to which for example may be connected to a tube by which the taken-off liquid will be collected, for example, in a container.<br>
Such needles generally comprise a polymer holding body molded over the proximal end of the hollow lance, the holding body forming an internal channel ensuring the flow of the liquid from the hollow lance to the spigot of the pipe. The holding body also enables the needle to be manipulated, in particular during the insertion operation.<br>
Such needles are for example used to take off liquid from a bottle closed by a rubber bung. The spigot of the pipe is connected in advance to a tube leading to a container. Next the needle is inserted into the bung such that the distal end passes through the bung and reaches the medium to be taken-off, the user holding the needle by its holding body.<br>
The liquid to be taken off then flows to the container, for example by gravity or with the help of a peristaltic pump or else by the pressurization of the bottle containing the liquid.<br>
Such needles may for example be referred to as "single" needles, that is to say that they only comprise a single hollow lance connected to just one pipe; or else they may be referred to as "double" needles, that is to say that they comprise a hollow lance of which the flow is divided into two at the holding<br><br>
body to go to two pipes for taking off the liquid simultaneously to two different containers.<br>
These needles, whether single or double, may be vented, that is to say that they comprise a second hollow lance, of smaller diameter than the main hollow lance, which is inserted in the main hollow lance. This second hollow lance allows the progressive introduction of air into the bottle containing the liquid to be taken off as the liquid flows in the main hollow lance. Such a vented needle makes it possible to carry out take-off operations from a fluid-tight bottle.<br>
Such take-off needles are known which are provided to be manipulated directly by the holding body. Although the form of the holding body is defined by its function, i.e. the connection of the hollow lance to the pipe, it may be grasped in the hand by the user to manipulate the take-off needle, in particular to perform the insertion operation, without touching the hollow lance.<br>
The holding body comprises a cylindrical body extending from the hollow lance and in line therewith. The spigot of the pipe is connected to the cylindrical body so as to project transversely or obliquely. Several spigots may project from the cylindrical body.<br>
The ergonomic quality of these needles is limited in that the hand of the user must adapt to the forms of the cylindrical body and of the spigot.<br>
Other take-off needles are known which are adapted to be manipulated by their holding body, as set out above, and which further comprise a guard formed by a plate that is transverse to the cylindrical body of the holding body. The guard is disposed on the holding body in the vicinity of the junction between the cylindrical body and the hollow lance. During the insertion operation, the guard enables the fingers of the user to be held clear of the hollow lance by a physical barrier.<br>
In particular, during the insertion operation, the guard forms a grip for the user's fingers which thereby avoid the risk of slipping onto the hollow lance.<br>
The object of the invention is to improve this type of take-off needle by providing a needle which is more ergonomic.<br><br>
To that end, the invention is directed to a take-off needle comprising a hollow lance having a distal end adapted to perform an insertion operation, said hollow lance being connected to at least one pipe provided with a spigot for it to be connected to a tube, and comprising a body for holding the hollow lance and pipe relative to each other such that the spigot projects from the holding body, said needle being characterized in that it further comprises two flanges held on respective sides of and spaced from the holding body by virtue of a spacer disposed between each flange and the holding body, said flanges extending in a longitudinal direction from the spigot to the vicinity of the proximal end of the hollow lance, the width of each flange being greater than the width of the portion of the holding body facing the flanges.<br>
In such a take-off needle, the holding body is, as it were, sandwiched between the two flanges. As these flange flanges transversely cover at least a portion of the holding body, it is much simpler for the user's hand to grasp the needle by both flanges than by the holding body.<br>
According to a preferred feature, each of the flanges also extends between the spigot and the proximal end of the holding body, to be better held by the hand.<br>
Each of the flanges may furthermore be arcuate so as to bowed towards the holding body.<br>
The arcuate form of the flanges provides longitudinal centering of the user's hand with respect to the holding body. The hand intuitively locates around the arcuate flanges and in the concave form which they define.<br>
For the same reasons, each of the flanges may also have a transverse curvature so as to present a rounded surface.<br>
The needle according to the invention may further comprise the following advantageous features, either alone or in combination:<br>
-	each of the flanges comprises a transverse guard at its distal end;<br>
-	the spigot projects from the holding body between the two flanges;<br>
-	the needle comprises two spigots projecting on respective sides of the holding body such that each of them projects between the two flanges, the<br><br>
spigot or spigots being thereby protected by the flanges, for example against the tubes connected to those spigots being accidentally pulled off;<br>
-	the flanges are attached to the holding body via a shell the internal form of which mates with the external form of the holding body;<br>
-	said shell comprises two half-shells each connected to one of the flanges;<br>
-	said half-shells are identical and hermaphroditic.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of manufacturing a take-off needle as presented above, said method comprising the following steps:<br>
-	manufacturing an assembly comprising the holding body attached to the hollow lance and to the pipe;<br>
-	mounting said half-shells onto the holding body.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention appear in the light of the following description of a preferred embodiment, given by way of non-limiting example, and made with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 is a perspective view of a double take-off needle according to the invention;<br>
-	Figure 2 is a perspective view of a single take-off needle according to the invention;<br>
-	Figure 3 is a perspective view of the assembly formed by the holding body provided with its two flanges, of the take-off needle of Figure 1 or Figure 2;<br>
-	Figure 4 is another perspective view of the assembly of Figure 3;<br>
-	Figure 5 is a side view of the assembly of Figure 3;<br>
-	Figure 6 is a view from the right of the assembly of Figure 5;<br>
-	Figure 7 is a view on section line A-A of Figure 5;<br>
-	Figure 8 is a perspective view of a half-shell provided with a flange; and<br>
-	Figure 9 is a perspective view of a take-off needle comprising a holding body onto which can be added two half-shells in accordance with that of Figure 8.<br><br>
Figures 1 and 2 each represent a take-off needle in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 1 represents a double take-off needle comprising a main hollow lance 1 adapted for the passage of the liquid to take off, a venting hollow lance 2 adapted to inject air into the container containing the liquid to be taken off, a holding body 3 defining an inner pipe which divides into two sub-pipes each provided with a spigot 4.<br>
The liquid taken off flows in the main hollow lance 1 and is distributed by the spigots 4.<br>
A tube may, for example, be connected to each of the spigots 4 in order to collect the liquid taken off in two different containers.<br>
As regards the venting hollow lance 2, this passes through the inside of the holding body 3 to connect to a venting filter 5 which in the present example enables sterile air to be injected by the venting hollow lance 2.<br>
This take-off needle further comprises two flanges 6 attached on respective sides of the holding body 3.<br>
Figure 2 on the other hand shows a single take-off needle. This needle comprises a single hollow lance 1' adapted for taking off liquid and does not include any part for injecting air.<br>
As with the needle of Figure 1, the needle of Figure 2 comprises a holding body 3', two spigots 4' connected by an internal pipe of the holding body 3' to the hollow lance 1', and two flanges 6'.<br>
The assembly formed by the holding body 3, 31, the spigots 4, 4' and the flanges 6, 6' is common to both embodiments of the take-off needle presented here in Figures 1 and 2. This assembly is represented in Figures 3 to 7 and will be described below using the numbering of the parts of Figure 1, it being understood that the assembly represented in Figures 3 to 7 is also adapted to the embodiment of Figure 2.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 are complementary perspective views to show the positioning of the flanges 6 with respect to the holding body 3.<br><br>
Each flange 6 is connected onto the holding body 3 via a spacer 7 ensuring rigid fixing as well as spacing of the flanges 6 with respect to the holding body 3.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, each spacer 7 mates with the form of the corresponding flange 6 and holding body 3 and fixes the flange 6 over practically the entirety of the length of the body 3.<br>
The spacing between the flange 6 and the holding body 3 is also visible in Figure 6 as well as on the cross-section in Figure 7.<br>
Figures 3 to 7, and more particularly Figure 5, show that the flanges 6 are arcuate such that each of the flanges 6 is bowed towards the holding body 3. The flanges 6 consequently have a concave form with respect to the exterior adapted to facilitate grasping of the flanges 6 by the hand of the user.<br>
The two flanges 6 are disposed on respective sides of the holding body 3 such that each spigot 4 projects between the two flanges 6 (see Figures 5 and 6).<br>
With reference to Figure 4 and Figures 6 and 7, each flange 6 furthermore has a radius of transverse curvature forming an outwardly directed rounded form.<br>
This characteristic of a transverse rounded form combines with the arcuate form of the flanges 6 to ensure the user can grasp the needle well by the flanges 6.<br>
Furthermore, Figures 3, 4 and 5 show that the flanges 6 comprise a guard 8 formed by a tab extending transversely of the corresponding flange 6.<br>
The guard 8 provides a grip for the user's fingers during the insertion operation.<br>
As regards the width of the flanges 6, Figure 6 shows that each flange 6 has a width slightly greater than the maximum diameter of the holding body 3.<br>
In the present example, the assembly of Figures 3 to 7 was produced with the following dimensions:<br>
-	minimum diameter of the holding body 3: approximately 7 mm<br>
-	maximum diameter of the holding body 3: approximately 13 mm<br><br>
-	thickness of the spacer 7: approximately 1 to 2 mm<br>
-	length of the flanges 6: approximately 40 to 50 mm<br>
-	minimum separation between the outer surfaces of the flanges 6 (in the proximity of the section line A-A of Figure 5): approximately 15 mm<br>
-	radius of curvature of the arcuate form of the flanges 6: approximately 70 to 80 mm<br>
-	radius of curvature of the transverse rounded form of the flanges 6: approximately 15 to 20 mm<br>
-	width of the flanges 6: approximately 15 mm.<br>
With reference to Figures 8 and 9, an alternative embodiment of the invention will now be described. The parts of the same nature as in the embodiments of Figures 1 to 7 will bear the same number in Figures 8 and 9 followed by a "second" sign (").<br>
In this embodiment, the flanges 6" are not directly fixed to the holding body 3". More particularly they are each fixed to a half-shell 9 which is then attached to the holding body 3".<br>
On producing such a needle, a first step consists of producing an assembly formed from a holding body 3", provided with the hollow lances 1", 2" and the spigots 4" (see Figure 9).<br>
Two other parts each in accordance with Figure 8 and identical to each other are next produced. These parts each comprise a flange 6".<br>
With reference to Figure 8, a flange 6" similar to the one described previously is fixed by a spacer 7" to a half-shell 9 which is hermaphroditic in that it is a part comprising an axis of symmetry and comprising pins 10 on one of the lateral edges and corresponding holes 11 on the other of its lateral edges.<br>
The internal volume of the half-shell 9 reproduces the exterior form of the holding body 3" and of the spigots 4".<br>
Two parts in accordance with Figure 8 may be assembled together, the pins 10 of one entering the holes 11 of the other. This assembly is made on the holding body 3" such that the latter is trapped between the two half-shells 9.<br><br>
Once the assembly has been completed, a take-off needle provided with two flanges 6" rigidly attached to the holding body 3" is produced.<br>
Variant embodiments of the take-off needle may be envisaged without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the hollow lances and the spigots may have a different configuration, it being possible for example for the needle to comprise only a single spigot.<br><br><br><br><br>
