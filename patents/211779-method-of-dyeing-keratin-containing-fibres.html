Method of dyeing keratin-containing fibres<br>
The present invention relates to a method of dyeing keratin-containing fibres, especially human hair, using cationic imidazole azo dyes.<br>
Cationic imidazole azo dyes and the use thereof for dyeing hair are already known, for example, from WO 95/01772 and EP-A-714 954. Such dyes are especially suitable for , dyeing undamaged hair, since they are capable of penetrating into the hair shaft relatively easily on account of their low molecular weight. They also exhibit good fastness to washing on undamaged hair, but are washed out of severely damaged (bleached) hair relatively easily. There is accordingly a need for further direct hair dyes having improved properties that are in addition storage-stable in aqueous solution at alkaline pH values.<br>
It has now been found that the dyes of formula (1) hereinbelow are especially suitable for dyeing hair and that the dyeings obtained are distinguished especially by good fastness to washing properties.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a method of dyeing keratin-containing fibres, which comprises using a dye of formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R, and R2 are each independently of the other hydrogen, C1-C4a)kyl, halogen or nitro,<br>
R3 and R4 are each independently of the other unsubstituted C1-C4alkyl or C1-C4alkyl<br>
substituted by OH, C1-C4alkoxy, halogen, CN or by phenyl,<br>
X, and Xz are each independently of the other hydrogen, C1-C4alkyl, C1-C4aIkoxy or halogen,<br>

or wherein R5 and R6 together with the nitrogen atom linking them form a piperazine ring, which is substituted, at the nitrogen atom that is not bonded to the phenyl group, by CfC8-alkyl or phenyl, or which is quaternised at that nitrogen atom by two such groups, the d-Ca* alkyl radicals and phenyl mentioned as substituents of the nitrogen atom of the piperazine ring being unsubstituted or substituted by OH, C1-C4alkoxy, halogen, CN or phenyl,<br>
and wherein X   is an anion.<br>
In accordance with the invention, alkyl radicals are to be understood generally as straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals, for example methyl, ethyl, n- and iso-propyl and n-, sec-and tert-butyl.<br>
The alkyl radicals and also the cycloalkyl groups may be mono* or poly-substituted, for example by hydroxy, carboxy, halogen, cyano or C1-C4alkoxy.<br>

The invention relates also to the compounds of formula (3).<br>
•i<br>
The dyes of formula (1) can be prepared according to methods known per se (see e.g.<br>
EP-A-714 954).<br>
V<br>
The dyes of formula (1) can be obtained, for example, by reacting a compound of formula<br><br>
with an amine of formula<br>
HN(R5)R6	(5),<br>
wherein the substituents have the definitions and preferred meanings indicated above. Alternatively, it is also possible to use as compounds of formula (4) those compounds which, instead of the methoxy group indicated, contain halogen, e.g. chlorine, or C2-C4alkoxy. The compounds of formulae (4) and (5) are known or can be prepared in a manner known perse. For example, the compounds of formula (4) can be obtained by diazotising 4-alkoxyanilines, coupling the product with an imidazole and then carrying out<br><br>
alkylation and quatemisation.<br>
The reaction of a compound of formula (4) with an amine of formula (5) can be carried out, for example, at a temperature of about from 40 to 100°C, preferably from 40 to 70°C, optionally under pressure and/or in an inert gas atmosphere, and in an inert solvent, e.g. in water or especially aliphatic alcohols, e.g. Ci-C8alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or especially isopropanoL It is also possible to carry out the reaction in aprotic polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide. In the case of amines that are liquid under the reaction conditions, it is possible, if desired, to dispense with a solvent.<br>
The invention relates also to compositions for dyeing keratin-containing material that comprise such dyes.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) ar^ present in the compositions according to the invention preferably in an amount of from 0:001 % to 5 %, especially from 0.01 % to 1 %, based on the total dyeing composition.<br>
The diversity of shades and the colour fastness of the dyes of formula (1) used in accordance with the invention can be increased by combination with other dyes used in the field of hair-dyeing compositions. They can be combined very readily both with oxidation dyes and with direct dyes, it being possible for the latter to be of cationic nature or also uncharged. Only in the case of anionic direct dyes is a certain degree of caution required, since precipitation may possibly occur in the formulation.<br>
In all dyeing compositions, it is also possible for a plurality of different dyeing substances to be used together; likewise, it is possible for a plurality of different oxidation dye precursors from the group of the developer and coupler compounds to be used together, for example aromatic compounds having a primary or secondary amino group, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, aromatic hydroxy compounds or amino acids, as described, for example, in German Patent Application 197 17 224.5,<br>
The dyes of formula (1) according to the invention produce colour shades in the range from yellowish-red to bluish-red, and the fastness properties are excellent. Attention is drawn to<br><br>
the property thereof that enables hair that has already been dyed a dark colour still to be distinctly altered in shade. In addition, the dyes are distinguished by a good storage stability also at alkaline pH values, e.g. pH 9.5.<br>
For dyeing hair there are preferably used dyes of formula (1) in admixture with one or more further cationic dyes, for example in mixtures comprising a dye of formula (1) and at least one of the dyes described in WO 95/01772, For example one, two, three or even more dyes from WO 95/01772 may be used. There may be mentioned as examples of such dyes the yellow dye according to Example 1, the red dye according to Example 4 and the orange dye according to Example 46 of WO 95/01772. Especially suitable are dye mixtures comprising a dye of formula (1) and the yellow dye according to Example 1 and/or the red dye according to Example 4 and/or the orange dye according to Example 46 of WO 95/01772.<br>
In a further embodiment, for the purpose of further modification of colour shades the dyeing compositions according to the invention comprise, in addition to the dyes of formula (1) according to the invention, customary direct dyes, for example from the group of the nitroanilines, nitrophenylenediamines, nitroaminophenols, anthraquinones, indophenols, phenazines, phenothiazines, methines or the compounds known as Arianors, such as, for example, the compounds known by the international names or trade names HC Yellow 2, HC Yellow 4, HC Yellow 6, Basic Yellow 57, Basic Yellow 9, Disperse Orange 3, HC Red 3, HC Red BN, Basic Red 76, Basic Red 2, Basic Violet 14, Basic Blue 3, Basic Blue 6, Basic Blue 7, Basic Blue 9, Basic Blue 12, Basic Blue 26, HC Blue 2, HC Blue 7, HC Blue 12, Disperse Blue 3, Basic Blue 99, HC Violet 1t Disperse Violet 1, Disperse Violet 4, Disperse Black 9, Basic Brown 16 und Basic Brown 17, and also picramic acid, 2-amino-6-chloro-4-nitrophenol, 4-amino-2-nitrodiphenylamine-2'-carboxyIic acid, 6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline, 4-N-ethyl-1,4*bis(2,-hydroxyethylamino)-2-nitrobenzene hydrochloride and 1 -methyl-3-nitro-4-(2'-hydroxyethyl)-aminobenzene.<br>
Also very suitable for combination with the dyes according to the invention are cationised nitroaniline and anthraquinone dyes, for example those described in the following patent specifications; US-5 298 029, especially in column 2, line 33 to column 5, line 38; US-5 360 930, especially in column 2, line 38 to column 5, line 49; US-5 169 403, especially in column 2, line 30 to column 5, 'ine 38; US-5 256 823, especially in column 4, line 23 to column 5, line 15; US-5 135 543, especially in column 4( line 24 to column 5, line 16;<br><br>
EP-A-818 193, especially on page 2, line 40 to page 3, line 26; US-5 486 629, especially in column 2, line 34 to column 5, line 29; and EP-A-758 547, especially on page 7, line 48 to page 8, line 19.<br>
Also, cationic azo dyes, e.g. according to GB-A-2 319 776, as well as the oxazine dyes described in DE-A-299 12 327 and mixtures thereof with the other direct dyes mentioned therein, are likewise very suitable for combination.<br>
The compositions of the invention according to this embodiment contain the dyes preferably in an amount of from 0.01 to 5 % by weight, based on the total dyeing composition.<br>
In addition, the dyeing compositions according to the invention may also comprise naturally occurring dyes, such as, for example, henna red, henna neutral, henna black, camomile blossom, sandalwood, black tea, Rhamnus frangula bark, sage, campeche wood, madder root, catechu, sedre and alkanet root Such dyeing methods are described, for example, in EP-A-404 868, especially page 3, tine 55 to page 4, line 9.<br>
In respect of further customary dye components, reference is made expressly to the series "Dermatology", edited by Ch. Culnan, H. Maibach, Verlag Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, Basle, 1986, Vol. 7, Ch. Zviak, The Science of Hair Care, chapter 7, pages 248-250 (direct dyes), and chapter 8, pages 264 - 267 (oxidation dyes), and to "Europaisches Inventar der Kosmetikrohstoffe", 1996, published by The European Commission, obtainable in diskette form from the Bundesverband der deutschen Industrie- und Handelsunternehmen fur Arzneimittel, Reformwaren und K6rperpflegemittel e.V.f Mannheim.<br>
It is not necessary for the oxidation dye precursors, where present, or for the dyes each to be single compounds, but rather there may in addition be present in the dyeing compositions according to the invention, in lesser amounts, further components predetermined by the preparation processes for the individual dyes, provided such components do not have an adverse effect on the dyeing result or do not need to be excluded for other reasons, for example on toxicological grounds.<br>
The dyes of formula (1) according to the invention may also readily be used in combination with other dyes and/or adjuvants used in the colouring of hair, for example with<br><br>

The dyeing compositions according to the invention produce intense dyeings even at physiologically tolerable temperatures of less than 45°C. They are accordingly suitable<br><br>
especially for dyeing human hair. For use on human hair, the dyeing compositions can usually be incorporated into an aqueous cosmetic carrier. Suitable aqueous cosmetic carriers include, for example, creams, emulsions, gels and also surfactant-containing foaming solutions, e.g. shampoos or other preparations, that are suitable for use on keratin-containing fibres. Such forms of use are described in detail in Research Disclosure 42448 (August 1999), If necessary, it is also possible to incorporate the dyeing compositions into anhydrous carriers, as described, for example, in US-3 369 970, especially column 1, line 70 to column 3, line 55. The dyeing compositions according to the invention are also excellently suitable for the dyeing method described in DE-A-3 829 870 using a dyeing comb or a dyeing brush.<br>
The dyeing compositions according to the invention may furthermore comprise any active ingredient, additive or adjuvant known for such preparations. The dyeing compositions in many cases comprise at least one surfactant, there being suitable in principle anionic and also zwitterionic, ampholytic, nomionic and cationic surfactants. In many cases, however, it has proved advantageous to select the surfactants from anionic, zwitterionic and non-ionic surfactants.<br>
Anionic surfactants suitable for use in the preparations according to the invention include any anionic surface-active substance that is suitable for use on the human body. Such a substance is characterised by an anionic group that imparts water solubility, for example a carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate or phosphate group, and a lipophilic alkyl group having approximately from 10 to 22 carbon atoms. In addition, glycol or polyglycol ether groups, ester, ether and amide groups and also hydroxy groups may be present in the molecule. The following are examples of suitable anionic surfactants, each in the form of sodium, potassium or ammonium salts or mono-, di- or tri-alkanolammonium salts having 2 or 3 carbon atoms in the alkanol group:<br>
-	linear fatty acids having from 10 to 22 carbon atoms (soaps),<br>

The term "zwitterionic surfactants" denotes surface-active compounds that carry at least one quaternary ammonium group and at least one -COOH or -S03H group in the molecule. Zwitterionic surfactants that are especially suitable are the so-called betaines, such as the N-alkyI-N(N-dimethylammonium glycinates, for example cocoalkyldimethylammonium glycinate, N-acylaminopropyI-N,N-dimethylammonium glycinates, for example cocoacyl-aminopropyldimethylammonium glycinate, and 2-alkyl-3-carboxymethyl-3-hydroxyethyl-imidazolines having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl or acyl group and also coco-acylaminoethylhydroxyethylcarboxymethyl glycinate. A preferred zwitterionic surfactant is the fatty acid amide derivative known by the CTFA name cocamidopropyl betaine,<br>
Ampholytic surfactants are to be understood as meaning surface-active compounds that, in addition to a C8-C16-alkyl or -acyl group, contain at least one free amino group and at least one -COOH or -S03H group in the1 molecule and are capable of forming internal salts. Examples of suitable ampholytic surfactants include N-alkylglycines, N-alkylpropionic acids, N-alkylaminobutyric acids, N-alkyliminodipropionic acids, N-hydroxyethyl-N-alkylamidopropyl* glycines, N-alkyltaurines, N-alkylsarcosines, 2-alkylaminopropionic acids and alkylaminoacetic acids, each having approximately from 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group. Ampholytic surfactants to which special preference is given are N-cocoalkyl-aminopropionate, cocoacylaminoethylaminopropionate and C12-C18acylsarcosine.<br>
Non-ionic surfactants contain as the hydrophilic group, for example, a polyol group, a polyalkylene glycol ether group or a combination of polyol and polyglycol ether groups.<br>
Such compounds are, for example:<br>
- addition products of from 2 to 30 mol of ethylene oxide and/or from 0 to 5 mol of propylene oxide with linear fatty alcohols having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, with fatty acids having from 12 to 22 carbon atoms and with alkylphenols having from 8 to 15 carbon atoms in the alkyl group,<br><br>
-	C12-C22 fatty acid mono- and di-esters of addition products of from 1 to 30 mol of ethylene oxide with glycerol,<br>
-	Ce-C^alkyl-mono- and -oligo-glycosides and ethoxylated analogues thereof,<br>
-	addition products of from 5 to 60 mol of ethylene oxide with castor oil and hydrogenated castor oil,<br>
-	addition products of ethylene oxide with sorbitan fatty acid esters,<br>
-	addition products of ethylene oxide with fatty acid alkanolamides.<br>
Examples of cationic surfactants that can be used in the hair-treatment compositions according to the invention are especially quaternary ammonium compounds. Preference is given to ammonium halides, such^as alkyltrimethylammonium chlorides, dialkyldimethyl-ammonium chlorides and trialkylmfethylammonium chlorides, for example cetyltrimethyl-ammoniurn chloride, stearyltrimettiylammonium chloride, distearyldimethylammoniurn chloride, lauryldimethylammonium chloride, lauryldimethylbenzylammonium chloride and tricetylmethylammonium chloride. Further cationic surfactants that can be used in accordance with the invention are quaternised protein hydrolysates-<br>
Also suitable in accordance with the invention are cationic silicone oils, such as, for example, the commercially available products Q2-7224 (manufacturer: Dow Corning; a stabilised trimethylsilylamodimethicone), Dow Corning 929 emulsion (comprising a hydroxylamino-modified silicone, which is also referred to as amodimethicone), SM-2059 (manufacturer: General Electric), SLM-55067 (manufacturer: Wacker) and also Abil®-Quat 3270 and 3272 (manufacturer: Th. Goldschmidt; diquaternary polydimethylsiloxanes, quaternium-80).<br>
Alkylamidoamines, especially fatty acid amidoamines, such as the stearylamidopropyl-dimethylamine obtainable under the name Tego Amid® 18, are distinguished not only by a good conditioning action but also especially by their good biodegradability.<br><br>
Quaternary ester compounds, so-called "esterquats", such as the methyl hydroxyalkyl-dialkoyloxyalkylammonium methosulfates marketed under the trade mark Stepantex®, are also very readily biodegradable.<br>
An example of a quaternary sugar derivative that can be used as cationic surfactant is the commercial product Glucquat^lOO, according to CTFA nomenclature a "lauryl methyl gluceth-10 hydroxypropyl dimonium chloride".<br>
The alkyl-group-containing compounds used as surfactants may be single substances, but the use as starting materials of natural raw materials of vegetable or animal origin is generally preferred in the preparation of such substances, with the result that the substance mixtures obtained have different alkyl chain lengths according to the particular starting material used.<br>
The surfactants that are addition tooducts of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide with fatty alcohols or derivatives of such addition products may either be products having a "normal" homologue distribution or products having a restricted homologue distribution. "Normal" homologue distribution is to be understood as meaning mixtures of homologues obtained in the reaction of fatty alcohol and alkylene oxide using alkali metals, alkali metal hydroxides or alkali metal alcoholates as catalysts. Restricted homologue distributions, on the other hand, are obtained when, for example, hydrotalcites, alkali metal salts of ether carboxylic acids, alkali metal oxides, hydroxides or alcoholates are used as catalysts. The use of products having restricted homologue distribution may be preferred.<br>

The constituents of the aqueous carrier are used in the preparation of the dyeing compositions according to the invention in the amounts customary for that purpose; for<br><br>
example emulsifiers are used in concentrations of from 0,5 to 30 % by weight and thickeners in concentrations of from 0.1 to 25 % by weight of the total dyeing composition.<br>
The pH value of the ready-to-use dyeing preparations is usually from 2 to 11, preferably from 5 to 10.<br>
To dye keratin-containing fibres, especially to dye human hair, the dyeing compositions are usually applied to the hair in an amount of from 50 to 100 g in the form of a mixture with the aqueous cosmetic carrier, left on the hair for approximately 30 minutes and then rinsed off or washed off with a commercially available hair shampoo.<br>
The compounds used according to the invention and, where used, the oxidation dye precursors may be applied to the keratin-containing fibres either simultaneously or in succession, the order in which they are applied being unimportant.<br>
The compounds used according to the invention and, where used, the oxidation dye precursors of the compositions according to the invention may be stored separately or together, either in a liquid to paste-like preparation (aqueous or non-aqueous) or in the form of a dry powder. When the components are stored together in a liquid preparation, the preparation should be substantially anhydrous in order to reduce reaction of the components. When they are stored separately, the reactive components are intimately mixed with one another only immediately before use. In the case of dry storage, before use a defined amount of hot (from 50 to 80°C) water is usually added and a homogeneous mixture prepared.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention without limiting the invention thereto. Unless specified otherwise, parts and percentages relate to weight.<br>
Application Example 1:<br>
A strongly alkaline 10 % solution of a non-ionic surfactant (Plantaren 2000, Henkel) is<br>
adjusted to pH 9.5 using citric acid. 0,1 % of the dye of formula<br><br><br>
is dissolved therein and a strand of human hair, bleached white, is treated with the dye solution at room temperature. After only a short period of time, the strand has been dyed a red shade, which is still very intense even after shampooing ten times. The dye also has a strong affinity for undamaged hair. In that case, too, the fastness to washing is very good.<br>
Application Example 2;<br>
A 0.1 % solution of the dye according to the invention of formula<br><br>
in a surfactant base consisting of 10 % cocoamphoglycinate and 90 % water is applied for 20 minutes to a strand each of bleached and unbleached white human hair ("Italian white virgin" IMHAIR Ltd.), rinsed and shampooed once. Very intense, vibrant scarlet dyeings of identical shade are obtained on both qualities of hair. Surprisingly, both the colour strength and fastness to washing are excellent and very similar for both qualities of hair, which speaks for the good levelling ability of this product.<br>
Application Example 3:<br>
A dye emulsion, containing 0.1 % of the dye according to the invention of formula<br><br><br>
3.5 % cetearyl alcohol<br>
1,0 % ceteareth 80<br>
0.5 % glyceryl mono-di-stearate<br>
3.0 % stearamide DEA<br>
1.0 % stearamphopropyl sulfonate<br>
0.5 % polyquaternium-6 and<br>
water ad 100%<br>
is applied for 30 minutes, at room temperature, to bleached human hair, rinsed and<br>
shampooed once. The result is a very attractive vibrant red dyeing that has good fastness to<br>
washing. A very interesting red dyeing is likewise obtained on undamaged human hair.<br>
Application Example 4:<br>
Example 4 illustrates a method for "lightening" dyeings, as described also in WO 97/20545.<br>
The following dye solution is prepared:<br>
1 g of the dye according to the invention from Example 3<br>
10 g of a 20 % ammonia solution .<br>
water ad 100 g.<br>
The solution is combined with the same weight of a 6 % hydrogen peroxide solution and the<br>
mixture is immediately applied to a strand of dark-blonde natural European hair. After 5<br>
minutes, the strand of hair is rinsed and dried.<br>
The naturally present melanine is bleached by the hydrogen peroxide, while the dye<br>
according to the invention is nearly not affected. It will be understood that this could also be<br>
achieved using a two-step process, but one of the important advantages of the dyes<br>
according to the invention is that, owing to the extraordinary pH stability thereof, the two<br>
steps can be carried out simultaneously, which is not possible with most direct dyes.<br>
Similar results are obtained if a dye according to Application Example 1 or 2 is used.<br>
Application Example 5;<br>
A dye formulation is prepared from<br>
0.1 g of the dye according to the invention from Example 2<br>
1.0 g of carboxymethyl cellulose ("Blanose 7M", Societe AQUALON)<br>
10 g of ethanol and<br>
water ad 100 g.<br>
The pH of the solution is adjusted to 9 using 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol.<br><br>
The solution is applied for 30 minutes to strands of grey human hair 90% of which is white. A<br>
very bright, intense red dyeing is obtained.<br>
Similar results are obtained if a dye of Application Example 1 or 3 is used.<br><br>
is slurried in 40 g 2-propanol at room temperature. The temperature is then raised to 45-50 °C and 40 g of N-phenylpiperazine is added. The mixture is stirred for 30 hours. Then the reaction mass is diluted with 140 g of methyl-ethyl-ketone, cooled to room temperature, when crystallization occurs. The crystal suspension is separated by filtration, washed twice with 20 g methyl-ethyl-ketone and dried in a vacuum dryer to get 63 g of a dark powder.<br><br>
60,6 g of the educt of formula (101) is slurried in 43 g 2-propanol at room temperature. The temperature is then raised to 45-50 °C and 30,3 g of benzyl amine is added. The mixture is stirred for 20 hours for the completion of reaction. Then the reaction mass is diluted in 0.5 hours with 140 g of methyl-ethyl-ketone, cooled during 3 hours to room temperature, when<br><br>
crystallization occurs. The crystal suspension is separated by filtration, washed twice with 20 g methyl-ethyl-ketone, then with 20 g 2-propanol and dried under vacuum to get 53 g of a dark powder.<br><br>
60 g of the educt of formula (101) is slurried in 45 g 2-propanol at room temperature. The temperature is then raised to 45-50 °C and 20 g of n-hexylamine is added. The mixture is stirred for 17 hours. Then the reaction mass is diluted with 140 g of methyl-ethylketone, cooled during 3 hours to room temperature, when crystallization occurs. The crystal suspension is separated by filtration, washed twice with 20 g methyl-ethylketone and dried at vacuum to get ca. 50 g of a dark powder.<br><br><br><br><br>
