Repellent<br>
The present invention relates to the use of an arthropod-repelling component from the pyrethroid/pyrethrin class in combination with an agonist of the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors of arthropods for repelling arthropods, preferably on animals, in an effective and sustainable manner.<br>
The use of topical formulations comprising permethrin, (3-phenoxyphenyl) methyl 3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, (CAS No [52645-53-1] for controlling parasitic insects on animals is known (cf. for example, WO 95/17 090, JP-07 247 203, EP-A-567 368, EP-A-461 962, US-5 236 954 and US-5 074 252).<br>
Agonists of the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors of insects are known, for example from the European Offenlegungsschnften Nos. 464 830, 428 941, 425 978, 386 565, 383 091, 375 907, 364 844, 315 826, 259 738, 254 859, 235 725, 212 600, 192 060, 163 855, 154 178, 136 636, 303 570, 302 833, 306 696, 189 972, 455 000, 135 956, 471 372, 302 389; German Offenlegungsschnften Nos. 3 639 877, 3 712 307; Japanese Offenlegungsschnften Nos. 03 220 176, 02 207 083, 63 307 857, 63 287 764, 03 246 283, 04 9371, 03 279 359, 03 255 072; US patent specification Nos. 5 034 524, 4 948 798, 4 918 086, 5 039 686, 5 034 404; PCT application Nos. WO 91/17 659, 92/4965; French application No. 2 611 114; Brazilian application No. 88 03 621. The use of spot-on formulations containing agonists or antagonists of the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors of insects for controlling parasitic insects on animals is likewise known (see, for example, WO 98/27 817, EP-A-682 869 and EP 0 976 328).<br>
Combinations of permethrin with agonists or antagonists of the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors of insects for combating parasites have also been described in the prior art (cf., for example, CN-1 245 637, WO 00/54 591, US-6 080 796, EP-A-981 955, US-6 033 731, JP-07 089 803). The arthropod-repelling activity of type I pyrethroids was first described in US-4 178 384 (Pyrethroid insect repellent. Ensing, Kenneth J., 1979, US 4178384), Matthewson et al. (1981, Screening techniques for the evaluation of chemicals with activity as tick repellents. Matthewson, Michael D.; Hughes, Graham; Macpherson, Ian S.; Bernard, Colette P., Pesticide Science, 12(4), 455-62) and Shemanchuk (1981, Repellent action of permethrin, cypermethrin, and resmethrin against black flies (Simulium species) attacking cattle. Shemanchuk, Joseph A., Pesticide Science, 12(4), 412-16) describe the repellent activity of type I and type II pyrethroids against ticks and flies, respectively.<br>
The disadvantage of the spot-on formulations, for example permethrin-based spot-on formulations,<br><br>
is their low activity against fleas, midges and flies.<br>
As a rule, spot-on formulations based on agonists and antagonists of the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors (see, for example, WO 96/17520) have good activity against insects. However, their disadvantage is they are virtually ineffective against ticks and show no tick-repellent activity.<br>
This is why a multiple treatment of the animals with various formulations was required to date for the successful control of ticks and fleas and for repelling midges and flies. For ecological and economical reasons, it is desirable to replace these formulations by others which are well tolerated by the skin, toxicologically acceptable and distinguished further by their good long-term action of at least three to four weeks, especially against ticks, fleas, midges and flies, at a low application volume (for example 0.1 ml/1.0 kg [body weight of the animal to be treated]). Moreover, such a formulation should be sufficiently storage-stable in all climates, usually at least three years for example in the case of the conventional spot-on tubes.<br>
WO 02/087338 describes the provision of a dermatologically and environmentally acceptable, user friendly formulation for dermal application comprising permethrin and agonists or antagonists of the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors for insects which is active against parasitic insects, in particular against ticks and fleas.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that compositions which contain active compounds from the pyrethroid/pyrethrin group in combination with active compounds which act agonistically at the arthropod nictotine receptor have very good repelling properties against arthropods such as, for example, ticks, midges and flies, which exceed the repellent effect of formulations containing pyrethroid/pyrethrin alone. This relates both to the relative contact times of the ectoparasites with the animal treated and to the contact time required for achieving 100% mortality after contact. As can be seen from comparative in-vitro studies, this effect cannot be attributed to the formulation.<br>
Thus, such combination formulations of the type described in greater detail hereinbelow are not only capable of controlling parasites which have already attacked the animal, but, surprisingly, also prevent very efficiently acute attack and thus the potential transmission of pathogens by arthropods, in particular ticks, midges and sucking flies.<br>
The present invention relates to<br>
1.	The use of a pyrethroid or pyrethrin in combination with a nicotinic agonist for repelling arthropods.<br>

Furthermore, the compositions which can be used in accordance with the invention generally contain conventional solvents and spreading agents and, if appropriate, conventional auxiliaries.<br>
The percentages by weight refer to the total weight.<br>
The classification of the pyrethroids/pyrethrins as type I pyrethroids, type II pyrethroids, non-ester pyrethroids and natural pyrethrins is detailed in Encyclopedic Reference of Parasitology 2nd ed., Disease, Treatment, Therapy, (H. Mehlhorn ed.), 2001, pages 91-96, which is expressly incorporated by reference.<br>

Other compounds which are active as agonists on the nicotinic receptor and which can likewise be combined successfully with compounds from group 1 are, for example, nicotine or nithiazine<br><br>
Surprisingly, the repellent effect and the short-contact mortality of the combination used in accordance with the invention, of active compounds from the group of the nicotinic agonist in combination with active compounds from the pyrethroid/pyrethrin group, exceeds what was to be . expected on the basis of the activities of the individual components. By using these composi lions, it is therefore possible to reduce the application rates of active compound and to prolong the sustained activity. Accordingly, their use has economical and ecological advantages.<br>
The combinations used in accordance with the invention are outstandingly suitable for use in repelling parasites and for preventing the transmission of pathogens which are transmitted by such parasites. The parasites can be repelled directly on humans or animals or in the environment. Moreover, the abovementioned active compound combination can also be used in the protection of materials, namely for repelling arthropods from locations and materials where they are undesired.<br>
Parasites which may be mentioned are:<br>
from the order of the Anoplura, for example, Haematopinus spp., Linognathus spp., Solenopotes spp., Pediculus spp., Pthirus spp.;<br>
from the order of the Mallophaga, for example, Trimenopon spp., Menopon spp., Eomenacanthus spp., Menacanthus spp., Trichodectes spp., Felicola spp., Damalinea spp., Bovicola spp;<br>
from the order of the Diptera, for example, Aedes spp., Culex spp., Simulium spp., Phlebotomus spp., Lutzomyia spp., Chrysops spp., Tabanus spp., Musca spp., Hydrotaea spp., Muscina spp., Haematobosca spp., Haematobia spp., Stomoxys spp., Fannia spp., Glossina spp., Lucilia spp., Calliphora spp., Auchmeromyia spp., Cordylobia spp., Cochliomyia spp., Chrysomyia spp., Sarcophaga spp., Wohlfartia spp., Gasterophilus spp., Oesteromyia spp., Oedemagena spp., Hypoderma spp., Oestrus spp., Rhinoestrus spp., Melophagus spp., Hippobosca spp.<br>
from the order of the Siphonaptera, for example, Ctenocephalides spp., Echidnophaga spp., Ceratophyllus spp., Pulex spp.<br><br>
from the order of the Metastigmata, for example, Hyalomma spp., Rhipicephalus spp., Boophilus spp., Amblyomma spp., Haemaphysalis spp., Dermacentor spp., Ixodes spp., Argas spp., Ornithodorus spp., Otobius spp.;<br>
from the order of the Mesostigmata, for example, Dermanyssus spp., Ornithonyssus spp., Pneumonyssus spp..<br>
from the order of the Prostigmata, for example, Cheyletiella spp., Psorergates spp., Myobia spp., Demodex spp., Neotrombicula spp.;<br>
from the order of the Astigmata, for example, Acarus spp., Myocoptes spp., Psoroptes spp., Chorioptes spp., Otodectes spp., Sarcoptes spp., Notoedres spp., Knemidocoptes spp., Neoknemidocoptes spp., Cytodites spp., Laminosioptes spp.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the compositions are used for repelling arthropods, preferably ticks, fleas, midges and flies, in animals, in particular warm-blooded species. The use on humans is also possible.<br>
Examples of animals are breeding animals or livestock: mammals such as cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, goats, camels, water buffaloes, donkeys, rabbits, fallow deer, reindeer, fur bearers such as mink, chinchilla, racoon; birds such as, for example, chickens, geese, turkeys, ducks and ostriches.<br>
They are furthermore laboratory animals and experimental animals such as, for example, mice, rats, guinea pigs, golden hamsters, dogs and cats.<br>
The use in pets such as, for example, dogs and cats, is especially preferred.<br>
Since, as a rule, the treated animals also disperse a certain amount of the composition employed in the environment, for example by rubbing or together with debris, the compositions according to the invention may act not only directly on the animal but, correspondingly, also in their environment.<br>
Naturally, the compositions used in accordance with the invention may additionally comprise other suitable active compounds in addition to the abovementioned active compounds.<br>
Examples which may be mentioned are growth-inhibitory active compounds and synergists, for example pyriproxyfen {2-[l-methyl-2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)-ethoxy]-pyridine CAS No.: 95737-68-1}, methoprene [(E,E)-l-methylethyl 1 l-methoxy-3,7,1 l-trimethyl-2,4-dodecadienoate CAS No.: 40596-69-8] and triflumuron {2-chloro-N-[[[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]amino]-carbonyl]benzamide CAS No.: 64628-44-0}.<br><br>
The addition of further substances with a repellent effect, such as DEET (Diethyltoluamide). Bayrepel® (CAS name: 1-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-, 1-methylpropyl ester). 2-(octylthio)ethanol or ethyl 3-(N-acetyl-N-butylamino)propionate is also feasible.<br>
The application to the animal is, as a rule, via the dermal route, either directly or in the form of suitable preparations.<br>
Since the repellent mechanism of the pyrethroids/pyrethrins requires the possibility of coming into contact with the active compound, it is recommended to distribute the active compounds over the entire surface to be protected, for example on all body parts of the animals treated. Penetration of the active compounds through the skin tends to be disadvantageous for the repellent effect since the active compounds which have penetrated the skin are no longer available for a repellent action.<br>
Dermal application is carried out for example in the form of spraying, pouring on and spotting on.<br>
Suitable preparations are:<br>
solutions or concentrates for application after dilution for use on the skin or in body cavities, pour-and spot-on formulations, gels;<br>
emulsions and suspensions, semisolid preparations;<br>
formulations in which the active compound is incorporated into an ointment base or into an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion base;<br>
solid preparations such as powders, premixes or concentrates, granules, pellets, aerosols and active-compound-containing shaped articles.<br>
Solvents which may be mentioned are: physiologically acceptable solvents such as water, alcohols such as ethanol, butanol, benzyl alcohol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, N-methylpyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, and mixtures of these.<br>
If appropriate, the active compounds can also be dissolved in physiologically acceptable vegetable oils or synthetic oils.<br>
Solubilizers which may be mentioned are: solvents which promote the dissolution of the active compound in the main solvent or prevent its precipitation. Examples are polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethoxylated castor oil, polythoxylated sorbitan esters.<br>
Preservatives are: benzyl alcohol, trichlorobutanol, esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, n-butanol.<br><br>
Solutions can be administered directly. Concentrates are used after prior dilution to the use concentration.<br>

cationic surfactants such as cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.<br>
The compositions used in accordance with the invention can be prepared by customary methods, for example by mixing the active compounds with the further constituents, with stirring, and making a solution. If appropriate, this solution can be filtered. It can be packaged for example into plastic tubes.<br>
The preferred application volumes for the formulations described in WO 02/087338 are 0.075 -0.25 ml/1.0 kg [body weight of the animal to be treated], preferably 0.1 - 0.15 ml/1.0 kg [body<br><br>
weight of the animal to be treated].<br>
They are outstandingly suitable for packaging and selling in storage-critical containers such as, for example, the single-dose polypropylene polymer tubes which have a wall thickness of 300 -500 fim and a filling volume of 1.0 - 4.0 ml.<br>
Moreover, the compositions are very skin-friendly, have low toxicity and are, owing to the fact that they are biodegradable, environmentally friendly.<br><br>

A.        Repellation of ticks in the moving-object bioassay. Comparison with the prior art<br>
Method<br>
Moving-object bioassay by the method of Dautel et al. (1999)<br>
Brief description: individual ticks approach a warmed, slowly rotating, vertical cylinder on a horizontally mounted glass rod. The ticks are attracted by the heat of the cylinder and migrate onto an attachment site on the rotating cylinder. If a repellent is applied to this attachment site, the &gt; repellent effect can be measured either i) on the basis of a decreasing number of ticks which migrate towards the cylinder, or ii) by a reduced number of ticks which migrate onto the attachment site, or iii) by an increasing number of ticks which drop prematurely off the attachment site. A cylinder with an untreated control acts as comparison. Both contact repellents and distant-<br><br>
acting repellents can be measured.<br>
Test conditions:<br>
Each test is carried out with 30 ticks. All the ticks are tested individually one after the other in the same apparatus. For each test series, a control test with pure solvent without repellent is carried out to check the basal activity of the ticks. The critical activity for carrying out a test is the migration of at least 70% of the ticks onto the cylinder. A separate test cylinder is used for each test product. After each test series, all of the equipment used is cleaned carefully.<br>
The following conditions were established for testing Ixodes ricinus and Rhipicephalus sanguineus<br>
ticks.<br>
I. ricinus:<br>
A standard cylinder and attachment zone were used (Dautel et al. (1999)). The attachment zone was positioned 1-3 mm above the cylinder surface. The distance between the glass rod of 2 mm diameter and the attachment zone amounted to between 1 and not more than 1.5 mm.<br>
The rotational speed of the cylinder was between 3.9 and 4.1 s/revolution, corresponding to 7.66 -8.05 cm/s relative to the tick. The surface temperature at the attachment zone was between 34.6 and 35.5°C. The room temperature and the atmospheric humidity were between 19.1 and 22.3°C, and 43.4 and 78.1% r.h.<br>
R. sanguineus:<br>
Adult R. sanguineus move more rapidly than I. ricinus nymphs. The attachment zone on the cylinder must therefore be enlarged in such a way that a contact period of at least 10 seconds can be ensured, even for rapidly moving specimens. Thus, the entire cylinder acts as attachment site here. Owing to the poor attachment of the ticks to filter paper, the cylinder was covered in Molton cloth. The distance between Molton and glass rod (4 mm diameter) amounted to 1 - 3 mm, whereby the ticks were capable at any time of migrating from the glass rod to the cylinder.<br>
The rotational speed of the cylinder was between 5.6 and 6.0 s/revolution, corresponding to 5.23 -5.61 cm/s relative to the tick. The surface temperature at the attachment zone was between 35 and 36°C. The room temperature and the atmospheric humidity were between 19.4 and 23.5°C, and 59.1 and 79.5% r.h.<br>
Application of the test substance<br><br>
In all of the experiments, acetone was used as the solvent and for the dilutions. Application was effected 1-2 hours before the beginning of the experiment to allow sufficient time for the solvent to evaporate.<br>
The active compounds were applied to the filter papers using a disposable pipette. Uniform distribution on the larger surface of the Molton cloth was achieved with the aid of a spraying apparatus under nitrogen pressure. The precise volume applied was determined here by back-weighing.<br>
MO bioassay<br>
Only those ticks which, in a glass tube, climbed actively towards the upper edge and migrated rapidly onto a badger-hair brush (0 or 1), which was used for transferring the ticks, were employed in the test. These ticks were placed on the glass rod at a distance of 1.5 cm (I. ricinus) or 2.5-4 cm (R. sanguineus) to the tip of the glass rod so that their heads faced the cylinder. The experimental time started as soon as a tick had crossed the 1 cm (I. ricinus) or the 2 cm (R. sanguineus) mark on the glass rod. Ticks which were dropped from the brush or which dropped off the glass rod before reaching the marker were not included in the evaluation.<br>
The following periods of time were recorded by means of a stop clock:<br>
time taken from crossing the mark to reaching the end of the glass rod<br>
time taken from reaching the tip of the glass rod to migration onto the cylinder<br>
time for which the tick remains on the filter or on the Molton cloth until it drops off or leaves the treated area.<br>
A maximum of 120 seconds was envisaged for each of these periods of time. After 2 minutes, the tick was removed, and the period of time was evaluated at 120 seconds.<br>
A total repellent effect relative to the control was calculated by adding all the ticks which did not move towards the cylinder, which did not migrate to the cylinder and which dropped off the attachment zone. All of these ticks were evaluated as repelled. The repellent effect is calculated as follows:<br>
R= 100- pt/pc* 100,<br>
where R is the repellent effect, pt the percentage of unrepelled ticks and pc the percentage of the unrepelled control ticks.<br><br>
Results from repellent experiments with Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks -Comparison with the prior art (Exspot®, from Schering-Plough)<br><br>
*) The first value refers to the amount of imidacloprid and the second to the amount of permethrin<br>
Surprisingly, the formulation of Example 1 displays a markedly more pronounced repellent effect than the standard (Exspot® contains permethrin as the only active compound). In Example 1, ticks which migrate onto the cylinder drop off much more rapidly than in the case of the standard. In the present example, the repellent effect of the standard is enhanced on average by a factor of 4.<br>

*) The first value refers to the amount of imidacloprid and the second to the amount of permethrin<br>
A further sign for the improved repellent effect is the delayed migration from the glass rod onto the cylinder. Again, it was established that ticks in Example 1 take on average three times longer in comparison with the standard. The standard here is within a control range.<br><br>
Table 2:      R. sanguineus: evaluation of the MO biotest:  formulation according to the invention and prior art (Exspot®, from Schering-Plough) versus control<br><br>
It was established that the formulation according to the invention of Example 1 has a 100% repellent effect in the relevant dose range in comparison with the respective control in the case of a formulation distributed uniformly topically with spot-on application. Surprisingly, the known commercial product is not capable of repelling all of the ticks under identical conditions.<br>
Results from repellent experiments with Ixodes ricinus ticks -Comparison with the prior art (Exspot®, from Schering-Plough)<br>
Table 3:      /. ricinus: evaluation of the MO biotest: formulation according to the invention and prior art (Exspot®, from Schering-Plough) versus controls<br><br><br><br>
Surprisingly, a markedly improved repellent effect was established for the example according to the invention even in the case of Ixodes, a tick which is not repelled efficiently by Exspot®. In particular at low dosage rates as can be expected at the beginning of the treatment on body surfaces which are further away from the application site of the spot-on and on all of the animal at the end of the duration of action, the example according to the invention reveals repellency in the same range as at the higher dosage rates, while the curve of the repellent effect in the prior art has already dropped by a factor of 6.<br>
Thus, formulations according to the invention at the same application rate reveal a markedly improved repellent effect on ticks versus the prior art in the important parameters probability for migration onto the surface, residence time on the surface and efficacy at lower dosage rates.<br>
B.	Mortality of ticks in the moving-object bioassay.<br>
Method<br>
Determination of the final mortality after short-time contact in the moving-object bioassay<br>
Summary: after exposure, the ticks were transferred individually into Eppendorf tubes with a pierced lid and stored at 90% r.h. and 20°C. After 24 hours and after 7 days, the ticks were studied by means of a stereoscope. Ticks which were capable of coordinated movement were considered as being alive. Ticks which performed only minor movements with the tarsi or mouth parts or which were incapable of running were considered as moribund. Ticks which remained immobile after a CO2 stimulus or after a strong light pulse were considered as being dead.<br><br><br><br>
