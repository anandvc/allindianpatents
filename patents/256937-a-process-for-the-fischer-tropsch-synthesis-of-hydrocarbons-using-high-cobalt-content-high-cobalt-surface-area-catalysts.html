				<td>Catalysts<br>
The application relates to cobalt-alumina catalysts, as well as to the preparation and use<br>
thereof.<br>
Supported cobalt catalysts wherein the cobalt is in its elemental or reduced state are well<br>
known and find use in many reactions involving hydrogen such as hydrogenation reactions,<br>
and the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons. The activity of the catalysts is believed to<br>
be directly proportional to the cobalt surface area of the reduced catalysts, but in order to<br>
achieve high cobalt surface areas, the cobalt should be well dispersed on the support.<br>
Furthermore, to minimize reactor volume, the catalyst should preferably have as high a cobalt<br>
content as possible. High cobalt contents also offer improved efficiency in catalyst recycle and<br>
regeneration. However, as the cobalt content of a catalyst increases above 20% by weight (on<br>
reduced catalyst) the cobalt becomes more difficult to disperse resulting in lower cobalt surface<br>
areas. Cobalt is a relatively expensive metal and therefore there is a desire to improve the<br>
cobalt dispersion (expressed as cobalt surface area per gram catalyst).<br>
Preparation of cobalt-alumina catalysts has heretofore typically been by impregnation of cobalt<br>
compounds into 'pre-formed' alumina materials or by precipitation of cobalt compounds from<br>
solution in the presence of alumina powders or extrudates, followed usually by a heating step<br>
and then, prior to use, reduction of the resulting cobalt compounds to elemental form using<br>
hydrogen.<br>
Alternatively cobalt-alumina catalysts may be prepared by simultaneous co-precipitation of<br>
cobalt (Co) and aluminium (Al) compounds by addition of a base. Khassin et al describe the<br>
co-precipitation of Co2+ and AI3+ at ratios of 1:1, 1:1.3 and 1:2 to yield hydrotalcite-containing<br>
materials. Upon calcination and reduction under hydrogen at 470-480°C these catalysts were<br>
of low activity in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons (see Journal of Molecular<br>
Catalysis A: Chemical, 168, 2001, 193-207).<br>
We have found surprisingly, that new high cobalt content, high cobalt surface area catalysts<br>
suitable for the hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds or in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis<br>
of hydrocarbons may be obtained by the sequential precipitation of cobalt and aluminate ions<br>
from solution.<br>
The present invention provides a particulate catalyst comprising an intimate mixture of cobalt<br>
and aluminium compounds having cobalt and aluminium at an atomic ratio in the range 10:1 to<br>
2:1 (Co:AI), which when reduced at 425°C, has a cobalt surface area as measured by<br>
hydrogen chemisorption at 150°C of at least 30 m2/g of catalyst.<br>
Preferably the atomic ratio of cobalt to aluminium of the catalysts is in the range 5:1 and 2.5:1,<br>
more preferably between 4:1 and 3:1. Despite the high cobalt contents compared to the<br>
impregnated or simultaneous co-precipitated catalysts previously known, the catalysts retain<br>
high cobalt surface areas upon reduction. For example, stable catalysts with cobalt contents<br>
&gt;60% wt particularly &gt;75% wt (reduced catalyst) may be prepared. It is believed that in order to<br>
obtain the very high cobalt surface areas observed at these Co levels, the amount of reduced<br>
cobalt is &gt;60%, preferably £70%, of the cobalt present in the unreduced catalyst. An<br>
advantage of such high cobalt contents is that catalyst recovery and recycling to obtain the<br>
cobalt once the catalyst is spent becomes economically viable. This leads also to the further<br>
benefit of a reduced waste-disposal burden.<br>
The catalyst composition, which may also be termed catalyst precursor prior to reduction,<br>
comprises intimately mixed cobalt and aluminium compounds in which cobalt compounds may<br>
be supported on cobalt-aluminium compounds. Upon reduction the cobalt compounds are<br>
readily reduced whereas the cobalt-aluminium compounds are more difficult to reduce. The<br>
resulting structure is different to that obtainable by impregnation or simultaneous coprecipitation<br>
techniques and provides improved catalyst performance. It is believed that prior to<br>
activation at least a major portion of the aluminium in the catalysts of the present invention may<br>
be in the form of one or more cobalt-aluminium compounds. By major portion we mean &gt;50%<br>
of the aluminium atoms. Preferably &gt;75%, more preferably substantially all of the aluminium<br>
has reacted to form cobalt aluminium compounds. This is in contrast to the supported catalysts<br>
of the prior art wherein it is believed that a minor part of the aluminium is in the form of cobaltaluminium<br>
compounds and a major part is alumina. The presence of cobalt-aluminium<br>
compounds may be determined using vibrational spectroscopy, e.g. Raman or Infra-red<br>
spectroscopy. Alternatively the presence of an intimate mixture of cobalt-aluminium<br>
compounds may be determined using a temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) wherein<br>
reduction with hydrogen is performed at 150-10uO°C and a TCD signal recorded that shows a<br>
characteristic peak for, e.g. Co-AI hydrotalcite structures in the range 400-800°C.<br>
The particle size of the catalysts expressed as surface-weighted mean diameter D[3,2] is<br>
preferably in the range 5-100 f.im (microns). More preferably the particle size is in the range 5-<br>
30 microns, especially 10-20 microns. Larger particles may be prepared by agglomeration.<br>
The term surface-weighted mean diameter D[3,2], otherwise termed the Sauter mean diameter,<br>
is defined by M. Alderliesten in the paper "A Nomenclature for Mean Particle Diameters"; Anal.<br>
Proc., vol 21, May 1984, pages 167-172, and is calculated from the particle size analysis which<br>
may conveniently be effected by laser diffraction for example using a Malvern Mastersizer.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention have a porous structure with pore diameters preferably of<br>
50-500 angstroms or larger, depending on the Co:AI ratio. For example, at a Co:AI atomic ratio<br>
of 5:1, the pore diameters of the catalyst prior to reduction may be about 200-250 angstroms.<br>
The pore volume of the catalyst prior to reduction is preferably &gt;0.3 cm3/g, more preferably<br>
0.4 cm3/g of catalyst.<br>
The BET surface area of the catalyst prior to reduction is preferably between 50 and 250 rrr/g<br>
of catalyst, more preferably &gt;90 m2/g. The BET surface area and pore volume measurements<br>
are suitably determined using nitrogen desorption using methods known to persons skilled in<br>
the art. The average pore diameter may be calculated from (4 x pore volume)/BET surface<br>
area.<br>
In addition to cobalt and aluminium compounds, the catalyst may comprise one or more<br>
suitable additives and promoters useful in hydrogenation reactions and/or Fischer-Tropsch<br>
catalysis. For example, the catalysts may comprise one or more additives that alter the<br>
physicai properties and/or promoters that effect the reducibility or activity or selectivity of the<br>
catalysts. Suitable additives are selected from compounds of molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni),<br>
copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), lanthanum (La), cerium<br>
(Ce), chromium (Cr), magnesium (Mg) or zinc (Zn). Suitable promoters include rhodium (Rh),<br>
iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru), rhenium (Re), platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd). Additives and/or<br>
promoters may be incorporated into the catalysts by addition of suitable compounds such as<br>
metal salts, e.g. metal nitrates or metal acetates, or suitable metal-organic compounds, such as<br>
metal alkoxides or metal acetylacetonates, to the reaction mixtures.<br>
The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a particuiate catalyst comprising<br>
an intimate mixture of cobalt and aluminium compounds having cobalt and aluminium at an<br>
atomic ratio in the range 10:1 to 2:1 (Co:AI), which when reduced at425°C, has a cobalt<br>
surface area as measured by hydrogen chemisorption at 150°C of at least 30 m2/g of catalyst<br>
comprising the steps of;<br>
(i) precipitating an insoluble cobalt compound from an aqueous solution of a cobalt salt with<br>
an excess alkaline precipitating agent,<br>
(ii) adding a soluble aluminium compound<br>
(iii) ageing the resulting precipitate in suspended form, and<br>
(iv) recovering and drying the catalyst composition.<br>
Hence, one or more insoluble cobalt compounds is precipitated from an aqueous solution of a<br>
cobalt salt with an excess alkaline precipitating agent, which precipitate is subsequently<br>
allowed to age in suspended form and is then collected, wherein, after the cobalt ions have<br>
been precipitated, a soluble aluminium compound is added. The soluble aluminium compound<br>
can be added as a solution but also as undissolved crystals. The soluble aluminium compound<br>
being added after the cobalt ions have been substantially precipitated is e.g. aluminium nitrate,<br>
sodium aluminate or alumina that dissolves at least partly in the excess alkali. Preferably the<br>
soluble aluminium compound is aluminium nitrate or sodium aluminate, particularly sodium<br>
aluminate.<br>
By forming the aluminium 'support' in-situ by the sequential precipitation method described<br>
herein, rather than using an alumina powder, pellet, extrudate or the like, the present invention<br>
allows a degree of control over the resulting catalyst physical properties not previously<br>
possible. In particular the separate manipulation of the precipitation and ageing steps allows a<br>
degree of control not previously provided. For example, by increasing or decreasing the<br>
temperature during the ageing step, the pore size of the catalyst may be controlled.<br>
Furthermore, the particle size of the catalyst may be controlled by the degree of agitation of the<br>
ageing mixture.<br>
After precipitation and ageing according to the invention, the precipitate is recovered from the<br>
liquid e.g. by centrifugation or filtration, usually washed, and dried. Subsequent activation of<br>
the catalyst is typically performed by reduction of the cobalt compounds with a hydrogencontaining<br>
gas at an elevated temperature using methods known to those skilled in the art. An<br>
advantage of this preparative method is that calcination of the catalyst composition is not<br>
required and accordingly that reduction of the dried precipitate leads directly to the high surface<br>
area catalysts. However, in some cases it may be desirable to calcine the dried catalyst<br>
precursor composition at temperatures in the range 200-800°C, preferably 200-600°C, more<br>
preferably 200-400°C. Calcination may be under an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon or may<br>
be in air to effect oxidation of the cobalt and/or aluminium compounds prior to activation.<br>
Cobalt compounds which can be used as starting material for the catalysts are water-soluble<br>
cobalt compounds such as nitrate, sulphate, acetate, chloride and formate. The solutions<br>
which are charged to the precipitation reactor preferably contain between 10 and 100, more<br>
preferably 10 and 80 grams cobalt per litre; especially preferred are solutions which contain<br>
between 25 and 60 grams cobalt per litre.<br>
If desired, suitable compounds of additives and/or promoters may be added to the solution of<br>
cobalt compounds prior to precipitation.<br>
Alkaline precipitation agents may be alkali metal hydroxide, alkali metal carbonate, alkali metal<br>
bicarbonate, the corresponding ammonium compounds and mixtures of the above-mentioned<br>
compounds. Ammonium carbonate may also be used. The concentration of the alkaline<br>
solution which is fed into the precipitation reactor is preferably between 20 and 300 grams<br>
alkaline material (calculated as anhydrous material) per litre (in as far as the solubility allows<br>
this), more particularly between 50 and 250 grams per litre.<br>
Preferably the precipitant solution comprises an alkali metal carbonate, particularly Na2CO-s,<br>
more preferably the precipitant comprises NaOH and Na2CO3 with a mole ratio of<br>
NaOH:Na2CO3 
carbonate is used as precipitation agent, the cobalt is initially thought to precipitate in a prehydrotalcite-<br>
like structure that readily accepts aluminium cations from solution thereby forming<br>
stable cobalt-aluminium hydrotalcite-like structures during the ageing step.<br>
It is convenient to use both solutions (of cobalt compound and alkaline compound) in almost<br>
the same concentrations (expressed in equivalents), so that approximately the same volumes<br>
can be reacted.<br>
The cobalt-containing solution and the alkaline solution are added in such amounts per unit of<br>
time that an excess of alkaline compound is present during the precipitation step, so that pH is<br>
preferably in the range 7-11, more preferably 7-10.<br>
The precipitation reactor preferably has such dimensions with respect to the amounts of liquid<br>
pumped in that short average residence times can be obtained. Typically, average residence<br>
times of between 0.1 sec. and 10 minutes, preferably between 0.2 sec. an 4.5 minutes may be<br>
used in the precipitation reactor.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, in which the precipitation step (step 1) is carried out continuously,<br>
the amounts of solutions fed into the precipitation reactor are controlled by measuring,<br>
optionally continuously, the normality or pH of the reactor effluent.<br>
The temperature at which the precipitation takes place can be controlled by adjusting the<br>
temperatures of the liquids fed into the precipitation reactor. Preferably the temperature is<br>
maintained below 90°C, more preferably below 50°C, most preferably below 30°C. The<br>
required vigorous agitation of the liquid in the precipitation reactor preferably takes place with a<br>
mechanical energy input of between 5 and 2000 watts per kg of solution. More preferably the<br>
agitation takes place with a mechanical energy input of 100 to 2000 watts per kg of solution.<br>
The reaction mixture obtained from the precipitation reactor goes immediately thereafter to a<br>
stirred post-reactor (ageing reactor) of a significantly higher capacity in which the suspension is<br>
agitated and aged. At this stage, the soluble aluminium compound is added. The amount of<br>
aluminium compound added is 0.1 to 0.5 mole aluminium ions per gram atom of cobalt in the<br>
suspension.<br>
If desired, a soluble silicate compound may also be added with the aluminium source following<br>
precipitation of the cobalt. Suitable soluble silicate compounds are e.g. waterglass, including<br>
neutral waterglass and potassium silicate. The amount of silicate added may be from 0.05-1<br>
mole per gram atom of cobalt, preferably between 0.1 and 0.5 mole.<br>
Additives and/or and promoters may also be added at this stage in addition to, or as an<br>
alternative to adding them to the cobalt solution prior to precipitation. Suitable amounts of<br>
additives and/or promoters are from 0.5 to 10% wt, calculated on the weight of cobalt in the<br>
unreduced catalyst.<br>
?<br>
Preferably the liquid in the ageing reactor during the ageing step is kept at a temperature<br>
between 10 and 100°C, preferably 40°C and 100°C. In a continuous process where the<br>
precipitant consists of sodium carbonate, the temperature is preferably in the range 40-60°C.<br>
The pH in the ageing reactor will vary during the ageing step. The average pH in the ageing<br>
reactor is preferably maintained in the range 6-11, more preferably 7-10, most preferably 8-10.<br>
The precipitation step and also the maturing step can be carried out batch-wise (i.e.<br>
discontinuously), continuously and semi-continuously (e.g. according to the cascade method).<br>
The ageing step can be carried out in one or more reactors, the (total) average residence time<br>
being maintained between 10 and 180 minutes, preferably between 30 and 150 minutes, more<br>
preferably between 30 and 70 minutes. If more than one ageing reactor is used the conditions<br>
may be the same or different. Alternatively the product may be fully aged in one" reactor then<br>
passed to a storage vessel under conditions where no further ageing takes place. By 'fully<br>
aged' we mean that substantially all the aluminium compound has been precipitated, preferably<br>
in the form of cobalt aluminium compounds. For example the ageing reactor may discharge<br>
product, in which substantially all the aluminium has reacted to form cobalt aluminium<br>
compounds, into a stirred tank operated at room temperature (ca. 20°C).<br>
The present process involving separate precipitation and ageing steps results in a catalyst<br>
precursor of particle size and particle size distribution more suitable for filtration than a<br>
simultaneously co-precipitated precursor. Improved filterability is of considerable importance in<br>
both hydrogenation processes and the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons where more<br>
efficient catalyst recovery is highly desirable.<br>
The solid material recovered from the ageing reactor is preferably washed with water;<br>
optionally containing some alkali or a surface active material, e.g. a non-ionic surfactant. Also,<br>
an organic solvent, e.g. acetone can be advantageously used during washing. Drying<br>
preferably takes place with hot air below 200°C. Spray-drying is preferred but freeze-drying is<br>
also suitable.<br>
Before the catalysts are activated by reduction, the dried composition may, if desired, be<br>
formed into shaped units suitable for the process for which the catalyst is intended, using<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art. The shaped units may be spheres, pellets, cylinders,<br>
rings, or multi-holed pellets, which may be multi-lobed or fluted, e.g. of cloverleaf cross-section.<br>
Reduction may be performed by passing a hydrogen-containing gas such as hydrogen,<br>
synthesis gas or a mixture of hydrogen with nitrogen, methane or other inert gas over the dried<br>
catalyst composition at elevated temperature, for example by passing the hydrogen-containing<br>
gas over the composition at temperatures in the range 150-600°C, preferably 250-600°C,<br>
alternatively 150-500°C, preferably 300-500°C for between 1 and 24 hours. Reduction may be<br>
performed at atmospheric or higher pressures up to about 25 bar.<br>
Catalysts in the reduced state can be difficult to handle as they can react spontaneously with<br>
oxygen in air, which can lead to undesirable self-heating and loss of activity. Consequently<br>
reduced catalysts suitable for hydrogenation reactions may be passivated following reduction<br>
with an oxygen-containing gas, often air or oxygen in carbon dioxide and/or nitrogen.<br>
Passivation provides a thin protective layer sufficient to prevent undesirable reaction with air,<br>
but which is readily removed once the catalyst has been installed in a hydrogenation process<br>
by treatment with a hydrogen-containing gas. For catalysts suitable for Fischer-Tropsch<br>
processes, passivation is not preferred and the reduced catalyst is preferably protected by<br>
encapsulation of the reduced catalyst particles with a suitable barrier coating. In the case of a<br>
Fischer-Tropsch catalyst, this may suitably be a FT-hydrocarbon wax. Alternatively, the<br>
catalyst can be provided in the unreduced state and reduced in-situ with a hydrogen-containing<br>
gas.<br>
Whichever route is chosen, the catalysts of the present invention provide very high cobalt<br>
surface areas. The catalysts, when reduced at 425°C, have a cobalt surface area of at least<br>
30 m2/g of (reduced) catalyst as measured by the H2 chemisorption technique described<br>
herein. Preferably the cobalt surface area is greater than 35 m2/g (reduced) catalyst, more<br>
preferably at least 40 m2/g (reduced) catalyst.<br>
The cobalt surface area is determined by H2 chemisorption. The preferred method is as<br>
follows; approximately 0.2 to 0.5 g of sample material is firstly degassed and dried by heating<br>
to 140°C at 10°C/min in flowing helium and holding it at 140°C for 60 mins. The degassed and<br>
dried sample is then reduced by heating it from 140°C to 425°C at a rate of 3°C/min under a 50<br>
ml/min flow of hydrogen and then holding it under the same hydrogen flow, at 425°C for 6<br>
hours. Following reduction and under vacuum, the sample is heated up to 450°C at 10°C/min<br>
and held under these conditions for 2 hours. The sample is then cooled to 150°C and held for<br>
a further 30 minutes under vacuum. The chemisorption analysis is carried out at 150°C using<br>
pure hydrogen gas. An automatic analysis program is used to measure a full isotherm over the<br>
range 100 mmHg up to 760 mmHg pressure of hydrogen. The analysis is carried out twice; the<br>
first measures the "total" hydrogen uptake (i.e. includes chemisorbed hydrogen and<br>
physisorbed hydrogen) and immediately following the first analysis the sample is put under<br>
vacuum (
uptake. A linear regression may then be applied to the "total" uptake data with extrapolation<br>
back to zero pressure to calculate the volume of gas chemisorbed (V).<br>
Cobalt surface areas were calculated in all cases using the following equation;<br>
Co surface area = ( 6.023 x 1023 x V x SF x A ) / 22414<br>
where V = uptake of H2 in ml/g<br>
SF = Stoichiometry factor (assumed 2 for H2 chemisorption on Co)<br>
A = area occupied by one atom of cobalt (assumed 0.0662 nm2)<br>
This equation is described in the Operators Manual for the Micromeretics ASAP 2010 Chemi<br>
System V 2.01, Appendix C, Part No. 201 -42808-01, October 1996.<br>
The catalysts may be used for hydrogenation reactions and for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis<br>
of hydrocarbons.<br>
Typical hydrogenation reactions include the hydrogenation of aldehydes and nitriles to alcohols<br>
and amines respectively, and the hydrogenation of cyclic aromatic compounds or unsaturated<br>
hydrocarbons. The catalysts of the present invention are particularly suitable for the<br>
hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds particularly oils, fats, fatty acids and fatty<br>
acid derivatives like nitriles. Such hydrogenation reactions are typically performed in a<br>
continuous or batch-wise manner by treating the compound to be hydrogenated with a<br>
hydrogen-containing gas under pressure in an autoclave at ambient or elevated temperature in<br>
the presence of the cobalt-catalyst, for example the hydrogenation may be carried out with<br>
hydrogen at 80-250°C and a pressure in the range 0.1- 5.0 x 106 Pa.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons is well established. The Fischer-Tropsch<br>
synthesis converts a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to hydrocarbons. The mixture<br>
of carbon monoxide and hydrogen is typically a synthesis gas having a hydrogen: carbon<br>
monoxide ratio in the range 1.7-2.5:1. The reaction may be performed in a continuous or batch<br>
process using one or more stirred slurry-phase reactors, bubble-column reactors, loop reactors<br>
or fluidised bed reactors. The process may be operated at pressures in the range 0.1-10Mpa<br>
and temperatures in the range 150-350°C. The gas-hourly-space velocity (GHSV) for<br>
continuous operation is in the range 100-25000hr"1. The catalysts of the present invention are<br>
of particular utility because of their high cobalt surface areas/g catalyst.<br>
The invention will now be further described by reference to the following examples.<br>
Example 1. Preparation of catalysts<br>
AI:Co molar ratio = 0.21:1. Aqueous solutions of Co(N03)2 hydrate (35 g Co/litre) and a<br>
Na2CO3 anh. (67 g/litre)/NaOH (25 g/litre) mixture were continuously pumped at flow rates of<br>
respectively 1500 and 860 ml/hour into a vigorously stirred precipitation reactor, where cobalt<br>
hydroxide/carbonate was precipitated at a temperature of 35°C. The pH of the suspension in<br>
this reactor was 9.5. In this precipitation reactor (volume 100ml), the suspension had an<br>
average residence time of 0.5 min. The suspension was then transferred continuously to an<br>
ageing reactor (volume 5000 ml) wherein the temperature was 70°C. Simultaneously, an<br>
amount of aluminium ions was continuously dosed into this reactor, as an aqueous solution of<br>
sodium aluminate (10 g Al/litre), at a rate of 490ml/hour. In addition, 1150 ml/hour of water was<br>
dosed into this reactor. The suspension was subsequently transferred continuously to a<br>
second ageing reactor in which the temperature was 60°C.<br>
The pH of the suspension in the first ageing reactor was 9.5 and in the second ageing reactor<br>
9.5. The volume of the liquid in the first and second ageing reactor was kept constant.<br>
The ageing was continued until at least a major portion of the aluminium formed cobaltaluminium<br>
compounds. The ageing step was terminated and the suspension from the second<br>
ageing reactor filtered. The filtration rate was about 1-litre/min. The filter cake thus obtained<br>
was washed with distilled water. The washed cake was spray dried. The cobalt surface area<br>
was determined on the reduced catalyst by hydrogen chemisorption as described above. The<br>
particle size of the catalyst prior to reduction was measured using a Malvern Mastersizer™'<br>
The BET surface area and pore volume for the un-reduced and reduced catalysts were<br>
measured by nitrogen physisorption using methods known in the art. The pore volume was<br>
determined using the desorption branch and pore diameter was calculated from (4 x pore<br>
volume)/BET surface area. The results are given in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example A<br>
In accordance with the procedure described in Example 1, a catalyst was prepared using an<br>
AI/Co atomic ratio of 0.02 by using a sodium aluminate solution of 1g Al/litre. The results are<br>
An aqueous solutions of cobalt nitrate and an aqueous precipitant solution comprising NaOH/<br>
and/or Na2CO3 were continuously pumped at flow rates of respectively 1500 and 860 ml/hour<br>
into a vigorously stirred precipitation reactor (upto 1500rpm), where cobalt hydroxide/carbonate<br>
was precipitated at a temperature of 20-45°C. In this precipitation reactor (volume ca.15ml),<br>
the suspension had an average residence time of ca. 0.5 min. The suspension was then<br>
transferred continuously to a stirred ageing reactor (volume 5000 ml, stirred 100-450rpm),<br>
which allowed an ageing time of 75 to 25 minutes. (Alternatively a 3000 ml vessel was used in<br>
some experiments). The temperature of the ageing reactor was controlled by means of a<br>
thermostatically-controlled water bath. Simultaneously, an amount of aluminium ions was<br>
continuously dosed into this reactor, as an aqueous solution of sodium aluminate. The<br>
suspension was subsequently transferred continuously to a non-stirred storage tank at room<br>
temperature (ca 20°C). The suspension from the storage tank was subsequently washed with<br>
1500 ml of demineralised water and filtered. The filter cake thus obtained was dried, at 110°C<br>
overnight or by spray drying. The cobalt surface area was determined on the reduced catalyst<br>
by hydrogen chemisorption as described above.<br>
a) Effect of pH. In a first series of experiments the pH in the ageing reactor was varied by<br>
using different amounts of sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide in the precipitating<br>
agent solution, at an AI:Co ratio of 0.3 with 70°C ageing for 70 minutes. (0.0 indicates that<br>
all the precipitant was sodium carbonate and 1.0 indicates that the precipitant was 50:50<br>
(molar) sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate. The results are as follows;(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
