BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a transport and storage container for liquids, with a parallelepiped-shaped or cubic inner container of plastic, a ciosable filling soc&gt;:et arranged at an upper bottom, and a draining socket arranged in a lower poriton of the front wall in the area of the lower bottom for a draining fitting with a plastic housing, a flexible inner sheathing of plastic material which can be placed in the inner container and is provided with a filling socket, a discharge socket, an outer casing of metal grating or sheet mstal and a pallet-like underframe for supporting the inner container.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] The inner container of transport and storage containers of the above-described type, as they are described in DE 202 17 856.0 Ul, is equipped for the transportation and storage of liquids of different types in the  chemical,  pharmaceutical,  mineral  oil,  and  food<br><br>
industries, with an exchangable flexible inner sheathing of plastic material.<br>
[0003] The stringent environmental laws make it necessary to stop using single-use containers, such as pallet containers and drums, for the transportation and storage of liquids of different types, and to use multiple-uss containers having greater volutaes with the goal of reducing the residual quantities, and to develop new raultple-use containers which, with a view to reducing the environmental burden of harmful substances on the environment, are reconditioned, and whose plastic components contaminated by the liquid material being transported and stored, can toe reduced to a flexible inner sheathing of thin foil material, The contaminated inner sheathing can be disposed of in an optimum manner by destroying them by a process which is low in or even free of harmful materials, for example, by burning.<br><br>
[0004] It is the primary object of the present invention to further develop the transport and storage container for liquids of the above-described type, such that a simple mounting of the discharge fitting, particularly a flap valve or circle valve is possible-<br>
10005] In accordance with the present invention, the transport and storage container for liquids includes a threaded sleeve of plastic material welded onto the drain socket of the inner container, wherein the welded sleeve has an sxternal thread for screwing the housing of the drain fitting to the filling socket of the housing provided with a corresponding internal thread, wherein the flexible drain socket of the inner sleeve, which can be pulled through the connecting socket of the inner container and through the threaded sleeve welded to the connecting socket, and which is placed in the inner container from the top through the filling socket of the inner -container into the inner container, has a sealing flange at the discharge end thereof, wherein the sealing flange, when the filling socket of the fitting housing is screwed onto the threaded sleeve welded onzo  the connecting socket of the inner container, is<br><br>
clamped in the housing of the drain â–  fitting between the free end of the threaded sleeve and an internal shoulder of the filling socket of the fitting housing, for sealing the connecting socket of the inner container and the threaded sleeve welded to the inner container and pulled through the drain socket.<br>
tOOOS] The transport and storage container according to the present invention has Che following advantages:<br>
10D07] The novel container construction facilitates a simple connection of the drain fitting manufactured as an injection molded piece of plastic to the drain socket of the inner sheathing and the drain socket of the inner container of the transport and storage container when the container is manufactured new and when it is reconditioned. The fitting can also be unscrewed easily for 'removing the inner sheeting from the inner container when reconditioning the transport container.<br>
10008] Since the inner sheathing	can be simply exchanged<br>
after use, it can be offered for	use as an insert in the<br>
multiple-use container,  a clean	inner container can be<br>
offered. The sealing flange with	a sealing lip integrally<br><br>
formed at the drain socket of the inner sheathing makes it unnecessary to provide a separate sealing ring as it is conventionally used for sealing the drain socket of the inner container in the fitting housing. Since the drain fitting is screwed directly to the fill socl<et on the threaded sleeve welded to connecting socket of inner container it is unnecessary provide cap nut for screwing fitting drain as otherwise conventional. fact that sealing ring and do not have be used makes possible reduce raanufacturing costs novel transport storage with internal sheathing liquids.></et>
