CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/748,612, which was filed on December 9, 2005. The disclosure of this application<br>
is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, unwanted<br>
paint is the largest component of residential household hazardous waste across the<br>
country. It is estimated that 34 million gallons of leftover consumer paint is generated<br>
annually in the United States. However, this estimate does not include significant<br>
amounts of waste paint generated by contractors, retailer mis-tints, paint<br>
manufacturers, private corporations or other businesses, schools, and other public<br>
agencies.<br>
The primary component of paint retailers' waste stream consists of unused full<br>
containers of paint that are returned as a mis-tint or other mistake. The cost of final<br>
disposition, a per container cost for either recycling or hazardous waste disposal, is<br>
very high for the retailer. Much of this paint could be re-blended and converted into<br>
paint for use by either government or private entities, particularly the unused gallons<br>
returned to retailers. However, markets for re-blended paint have not proven<br>
profitable as of yet.<br>
Currently, latex paint is the most popular paint on the market. In 1997,<br>
$270,000 was spent collecting and recycling 1.3 million pounds of latex paint. The<br>
amount of post-consumer latex paint has grown each year, and in 2003, the quantity<br>
of latex paint collected increased to two million pounds.<br><br>
This high volume of waste or unwanted latex paint in the municipal solid<br>
waste stream makes it an attractive material to recycle. Moreover, many jurisdictions<br>
prohibit waste paint disposal in a liquid state, due to its propensity to spill on route to<br>
the landfill or incinerator that may cause equipment contamination.<br>
Latex paint is composed of 59.3 % water, 15.7 % latex polymer concentration,<br>
12.5 % titanium dioxide concentration, 12.5 % extender pigments, and 1.1 % ethylene<br>
glycol concentration. However in the 1980s and earlier, mercury was used as a<br>
preservative in latex paint. Thus, liquid waste paint collected at recycling facilities<br>
must be tested for mercury and other contaminants prior to deciding its fate: recycled<br>
for reuse or use in non-traditional products, landfill, or hazardous waste. Latex paint<br>
manufactured after the 1980s may be legally disposed of in a dried, solid form<br>
without going to a hazardous waste landfill. Drying waste paint to a solid state<br>
releases only water and fractional amounts of safe, non-organic volatiles into the<br>
environment. However it is time consuming, and requires considerable effort due to<br>
weather conditions and safety.<br>
Thus, there is a need to develop a proactive, voluntary recycling program and<br>
technology for reusing this material while simultaneously creating financial benefits.<br>
Such a program must be successful in removing a large percentage of unused paint<br>
from the waste stream to negate the need for a mandatory or special taxation program.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides pigmented immiscible polymer blends formed<br>
using paint as one of the polymer components. An immiscible polymer blend in<br>
accordance with the present invention includes a first polymer component, which<br>
includes a paint polymer phase, and a second polymer component immiscible with the<br>
first polymer component and selected from polyolefins and polymethylmethacrylate<br>
(PMMA).<br>
The first polymer component includes a paint polymer phase preferably<br>
derived from water-based paints, oil-based paints, or solvent-based paints. Preferably,<br>
the paint is collected from a waste treatment facility or directly from the unwanted<br>
supply of a retailer or consumer. The paint is collected in either a liquid or a dried<br>
form. In one embodiment, the paint is collected in a liquid form and blended with the<br>
second immiscible polymer component in the liquid form. In another embodiment,<br>
the paint is collected in a liquid form and dried to reduce water, oil, and/or solvent<br>
content prior to melt-blending with the second immiscible polymer component.<br>
In one embodiment, the first polymer component is a latex paint polymer<br>
phase preferably derived from flat latex paint or gloss latex paint. The terms "gloss<br>
paint" and "gloss latex paint" as used herein include semi-gloss and high-gloss paints.<br>
The polymer phase of paint is typically formed from one or more polymers<br>
including acrylates, vinyl acrylates, vinyl acetates, styrene acrylates, polyurethanes,<br>
epoxies, neoprenes, polyesters, and alkyd polyesters. Paint containing acrylate and/or<br>
polyester polymers are preferred. The paint polymer phase can be blended with<br>
another miscible polymer before blending with an immiscible polymer component.<br>
Examples of miscible blends include polystyrene/polyphenylene oxide and<br>
polycarbonate/acrylonitrile butadiene styrene.<br>
The paint polymer phase is blended with a second immiscible polymer<br>
component to form the immiscible polymer blends of the present invention. The<br>
second polymer component is selected from polyolefins and polymethylmethacrylate<br>
(PMMA). Exemplary polyolefins include polyethylene and polypropylene.<br>
Preferably, the second polymer component is selected from PMMA and high-density<br>
polyethylene (HDPE). A preferred blend includes a latex paint polymer phase<br>
derived from gloss paint and PMMA.<br><br>
One embodiment includes a blend ratio of paint/second polymer component<br>
selected from 20/80, 30/70, and 35/65, wherein the ratio of 35/65 is preferred. In one<br>
embodiment, the second polymer component includes between about 65 and about 80<br>
% PMMA or HDPE by weight. In another embodiment, the first polymer component<br>
includes about 65 % PMMA by weight.<br>
Articles formed from the polymer blend are also presented. Suitable articles<br>
include those usually formed from polyolefins or PMMA. For example, a typical use<br>
for PMMA is as an impact resistant substitute for glass. Exemplary HDPE articles<br>
include packaging articles, preferably, containers, merchandise bags, shrink films,<br>
grocery sacks, and industrial liners.<br>
The present invention also includes a method of recycling paint by blending a<br>
first polymer component comprising a paint polymer phase with a second polymer<br>
component immiscible with the first polymer component and selected from<br>
polyolefins and PMMA. In one embodiment, the first polymer component and the<br>
second immiscible polymer component are both in a liquid form prior to blending.<br>
An additional embodiment includes reducing the water, oil, and/or solvent content of<br>
the paint polymer phase after combining it with the second immiscible polymer<br>
component. For example, the water, oil, and/or solvent content of the paint polymer<br>
phase can be removed by heating and/or drawing a vacuum on the first polymer<br>
component/second immiscible polymer component blend. Exemplary devices for<br>
reducing waiter, oil, and/or solvent content of the paint polymer phase include twin<br>
screw extruders made by, for example, Leistritz Corp., Allendale, NJ, and paint<br>
devolatilizers. In one embodiment, the first polymer component and the second<br>
immiscible polymer component, both in liquid form, are blended in a twin screw<br>
extruder just prior to extrusion.<br>
An additional embodiment includes the step of forming an article with the<br>
polymer blend. In one embodiment, the forming step includes injection molding,<br>
blow molding, thermoforming, rotational molding, or extrusion molding. Another<br>
embodiment includes an article formed according to the method of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The following non-limiting examples set forth hereinbelow illustrate certain<br>
aspects of the invention.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Paint preparation and analysis<br>
Thirteen cans of post-consumer paint were collected, separated by gloss<br>
content, and labeled gloss or flat. Both high-gloss and semi-gloss paint were<br>
categorized as gloss, and the flat paint labeled flat.<br>
A small sample was collected from each can, weighed, and weighed again<br>
after five days to determine changes in mass. Following this preliminary experiment,<br>
samples of both gloss and flat paint were poured into 25 by 55 cm Teflon baking<br>
sheets, dried under room temperature conditions over night in order to form a thin<br>
layer or solid layer at the surface, and placed in a Precision Mechanical Convectional<br>
Oven at 85°C for a period of twelve hours. The twelve-hour period was repeated for<br>
each sample until the paint could be peeled off of the tray neatly. The total drying<br>
time varied due to gloss content. The flat paint total drying time was three to four<br>
days, while the gloss paint total drying time was five to seven days.<br>
The resulting solid sheets of gloss paint were then cut into ten 5x9 cm<br>
sections and labeled A - J. The initial mass of the rectangular samples was recorded.<br>
The samples were dried further in a Fisher Scientific Isotemp Oven at a temperature<br>
of 85°C for twenty-four hour periods, and the mass was recorded after each<br>
increment. Samples were dried until the change in mass after each period was<br>
minimal. The length, width, and height were measured and the density calculated for<br>
each sample.<br>
The preliminary study for determining average weight loss of the gloss and<br>
flat paints resulted in average weight losses of 48.2 % for gloss paint and 47.0 % for<br>
flat paint. Table 1 shows the weight loss of the thirteen samples of paint collected<br>
after a five-day drying period. While there were only three samples of flat paint, it<br>
was hypothesized that the flat paint would have a lower weight percent loss than gloss<br>
paint due to the higher ceramic content in flat paint.<br><br><br>
Table 2 shows the calculated density of ten samples of gloss paint, labeled A-<br>
J. The average density of the gloss samples is 1.45 g/cm3. Figure 1 depicts the mass<br>
loss as a function of drying time for two of the samples, A and B, over a period of 180<br>
hours. As expected, the curve decreases at a decreasing rate until it levels off<br>
asymptotically and the weight change is minimal.<br><br>
Example 2: Preparation and analysis of polymer blends<br>
The second phase of experiments involved blending various compositions of<br>
the dried, solid latex paint with HDPE or PMMA to produce paint/polymer blends.<br><br>
Composition ratios of 20/80 %, 30/70 %, and 35/65 % by weight of Flat/HDPE,<br>
Gloss/HDPE, Flat/PMMA, and Gloss/PMMA were prepared, as well as 100 % HOPE<br>
and 100 % PMMA. The mixes were co-extruded using a Brabender Inteli-Torque<br>
Plasti-Corder extruder operating at 50 RPM at a temperature of 180°C. Once cooled,<br>
the extrudate was ground in a Nelmor grinder. Each blend was injection molded into<br>
tensile specimens using a Negri Bossi V55-200 injection molding machine operated at<br>
205°C.<br>
Tensile mechanical properties were determined using a MTS QTest/25 Elite<br>
Controller, according to ASTM D 638. Modulus, ultimate stress, and percent strain at<br>
fracture were calculated. The average results of five specimens are reported for each<br>
composition.<br>
Thermal properties were determined using a TA Instruments Q 1000<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimeter in modulated DSC mode (MDSC) under an<br>
atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Approximately 8 mg samples of 35/65 Gloss/HDPE and<br>
35/65 Gloss/PMMA were encapsulated in standard aluminum pans and sealed by<br>
crimping. DSC scans for each sample were conducted at 3°C/minute while<br>
simultaneously modulating at 2°C every 40 seconds. The Gloss/HDPE sample was<br>
scanned over a temperature range of-20 - 200°C, and the Gloss/PMMA sample was<br>
scanned over a temperature range of-20 - 160°C. Each sample was heated, cooled,<br>
and reheated over the respective temperature range.<br>
Table 3 shows the average tensile mechanical properties (modulus, ultimate<br>
stress, and strain at fracture) of Gloss/HDPE, Flat/HDPE, Gloss/PMMA, and<br>
Flat/PMMA paint/polymer blends. Strain at fracture is reported, although not all of<br>
the specimens fractured. The value represents the highest percent strain prior to test<br>
termination. Of the five specimens tested at each composition of 100 % HDPE,<br>
Gloss/HDPE, Flat/HDPE, and Gloss/PMMA none fractured. However, for the<br>
Flat/PMMA compositions, none of the five specimens fractured at the 35/65 %<br>
Flat/PMMA composition, but several samples did fracture at the 30/70 % and 20/80<br>
% Flat/PMMA compositions. For the 100 % PMMA composition, all five specimens<br>
tested fractured. The Gloss/PMMA blends have a higher percent strain at failure than<br>
neat PMMA.<br><br><br>
Figures 2 and 3 graphically depict a comparison of the tensile modulus as a<br>
function of paint content between Gloss/HDPE and Flat/HDPE blends and<br>
Gloss/PMMA and Flat/PMMA blends, respectively. The modulus of 100 % HDPE<br>
(720 MPa) increases dramatically with the addition of 20 % flat or gloss paint but<br>
then decreases back toward 720 MPa. With the addition of 35 % flat paint, the<br>
modulus decreases below 720 MPa. As shown in Figure 3, any addition of flat paint<br>
to PMMA increases the modulus over that of 100 % PMMA (3,480 MPa). However,<br>
gloss paint has the opposite effect, and the modulus decreases from 3,480 MPa with<br>
any addition of gloss paint.<br>
Figure 4 graphically depicts a comparison of the tensile ultimate strength as a<br>
function of paint content between Gloss/HDPE and Flat/HDPE blends and<br>
Gloss/PMMA and Flat/PMMA blends. The ultimate strength increases from 14.5<br>
MPa for neat HDPE with gloss paint content but is fairly constant with the addition of<br>
flat paint. The ultimate strength of PMMA decreases linearly from 65.0 MPa with the<br>
addition of gloss paint and approximately linearly with the addition of flat paint.<br><br>
Figures 5 and 6 present the stress-strain curves for the gloss and flat<br>
Paint/HDPE and Paint/PMMA blends, respectively. Gloss and flat Paint/HDPE<br>
blends behave in a similar manner as neat HDPE. This result suggests that<br>
Paint/HDPE blends can replace HDPE in some applications. However, gloss and flat<br>
Paint/PMMA blends have a greatly increased toughness value, as is evident by the<br>
area under the stress-strain curves limited by the strain of failure. The enhanced<br>
toughness of Paint/PMMA blends is an astonishing result that provides an enhanced<br>
alternative to neat PMMA.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 present differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans of<br>
35/65 % by weight Gloss/HDPE and Gloss/PMMA, respectively. The total heat flow<br>
and the derivative of the reversing heat flow are plotted against temperature for both<br>
samples. In Figure 6, the Gloss/HDPE sample, a glass transition of the paint<br>
component occurs at 14°C, and a melting transition of the HDPE component occurs<br>
around 129°C. In Figure 7, the Gloss/PMMA sample, a glass transition of the paint<br>
component occurs at 14°C, and a glass transition of the PMMA component occurs at<br>
approximately 104°C.<br>
