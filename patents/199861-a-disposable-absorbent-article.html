				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD   <br>
This application relates to a disposal absorbentarticale more particularly lotion <br>
compositions that reduce the adherence of BM to the skin, thereby improving the ease of BM clean up and enhancing skin softness. The lotion compositions disclosed herein are especially suitable for use in absorbent articles such as diapers, pull-on products, adult incontinence devices, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to absorbent articles having a lotion coating on the outer surface of the top sheet that is transferable to the wearer's skin by normal contact and wearer motion and/or body heat.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many types of disposable absorbent products, such as diapers, are available that have a high capacity for absorbing urine. Disposable products of this type generally comprise some sort of fluid-permeable top sheet material, an absorbent core, and a fluid-impermeable back sheet material. Although these types of absorbent structures may be highly efficient for the absorption of fluids, they cannot absorb bowel movements (i.e., hereinafter referred to as "BM"). Typically, the BM is trapped between the outer surface of the fluid-permeable topsheet and the skin of the wearer, much of it adhering to the wearer's skin.<br>
To prevent BM from adhering to the wearer's skin, the caregiver often applies protective or "repellent" products such as vaseline or mineral<br>
oil to the buttocks and anal region before placing the absorbent article on the wearer. This procedure usually involves the caregiver's pouring of the oil or lotion, for example, in one of their hands, rubbing both hands together to distribute the substance thereon and then wiping the same on the skin of the infant. To eliminate the need for this wasteful, messy, and easily forgotten procedure, there have been numerous previous attempts to prepare absorbent articles which contain a protective or therapeutic skin care substance on the topsheet.<br>
One substance that has been applied as a lotion to diaper products to impart a soothing, protective coating is mineral oil. Mineral oil (also known as liquid petrolatum) is a mixture of various liquid hydrocarbons obtained by distilling the high-boiling (i.e., 300째-390째C) fractions in petroleum. Mineral oil is liquid at ambient temperatures, e.g. 20째-25째C. As a result, mineral oil is relatively fluid and mobile, even when applied to diaper topsheets.<br>
Because mineral oil is fluid and mobile at ambient temperatures, it tends not to remain localized on the surface of the topsheet, but instead migrates through the topsheet into the interior of the diaper. Accordingly, relatively high levels of mineral oil need to be applied to the topsheet to provide the desired therapeutic or protective coating lotion benefits. This leads not only to increased costs for these lotioned diaper products, but other detrimental effects as well.<br>
One of these detrimental effects is a decrease in the fluid handling properties as high levels of mineral oil tend to block the topsheet openings. Also, as mineral oil migrates to the interior of the diaper, it tends to act as a hydrophobic additive, thus decreasing the absorbency of the underlying absorbent core, if one is used. This decrease in absorbency becomes more pronounced as the level of mineral oil applied is increased.<br>
Even without increasing its level, the tendency of mineral oil to migrate once applied has other detrimental effects. For example, the applied mineral oil can transfer to, into and through the packaging or wrapper material for the lotioned diaper product. This can create the need for barrier-type packaging or wrapper films to avoid smearing or other leakage of mineral oil from the diaper product.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide lotioned diaper products that: (1) have desirable therapeutic or protective coating lotion benefits (2) do not require relatively high levels of coatings that are liquid at room temperature (e.g., mineral oil) (3) do not adversely affect the absorbency of the diaper product; and (4) do not require special wrapping or barrier materials for packaging.<br>
U.S Patent 3,585,998 to Hayford et al. teaches a disposable baby diaper, an interior liner of which carries an array of pressure-rupturable capsules containing baby oil. The patent teaches that it is desirable to break the capsules prior to using the diaper by applying pressure with such household items as a rolling pin, hand iron, etc. The same principle of   pressure-rupturable capsules is used in US Patent 3,464,413 to Goldfarb et al. for making bandages capable of delivering a medicinal material to an injury. Articles disclosed by both patents have a serious drawback. Namely, unless the capsules are ruptured by applying pressure prior to using the diaper or the bandage, the skin-care substance contained in the capsules is either not delivered at all or is delivered non-uniformly leaving some areas of skin uncoated.<br>
U.S. Patent 3,896,807 to Buchalter teaches an article impregnated with a solid oil phase of cream formulation which forms a cream upon addition of moisture thereto. A major disadvantage of the article disclosed by the reference is that transfer of a beneficial substance from the absorbent substrate to skin is delayed and is only realized when body fluids are released.<br>
.U.S. Patent 3,489,148 to Duncan et al. teaches a baby diaper comprising a hydrophobic and oleophobic topsheet wherein a portion of the topsheet is coated with a discontinuous film of oleaginous material. A major disadvantage of the diapers disclosed in the Duncan et al. reference is that the hydrophobic and oleophobic topsheets are slow in promoting transfer of urine to the underlying absorbent cores.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a disposable diaper having a hydrophilic topsheet having superior fluid handling properties.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a hydrophilic diaper topsheet having a lotion coating on the outer surface of the topsheet<br>
that is transferable to the wearer's skin and is effective at reducing the adherence of BM to the skin, thereby improving the ease of BM cleanup.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide lotioned diaper products that: (1) have desirable BM release, cleaning, therapeutic or protective lotion coating benefits (2) do not require relatively high levels of mineral oil; (3) do not adversely affect the fluid handling properties of the diaper; and (4) do not require special wrapping or barrier materials for packaging.<br>
It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide skin care compositions that are effective at reducing the adherence of BM to the skin, and also improve skin softness.<br>
These and other objects are obtained using the present invention, as will become readily apparent from a reading of the following disclosure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a disposable absorbent article having a lotion coating on the outer surface of the topsheet that is semisolid or solid at ambient temperatures (i.e., at 20째C) and is adapted to be transferred to the wearer's skin, where it acts to reduce the adherence of BM to the skin of the wearer, thereby improving the ease of BM clean up and enhancing skin softness.<br>
Briefly, the disposable absorbent articles of the present invention comprise:<br>
A)	a liquid impervious backsheet;<br>
B)	a liquid pervious, hydrophilic topsheet joined to said backsheet, said topsheet having an inner surface oriented toward the interior of said diaper and an outer surface oriented toward the skin of the wearer when said diaper is being worn, wherein at least a portion of said topsheet outer surface comprises an effective amount of a lotion coating which is semi-solid or solid at 20째C and which is partially transferable to the wearer's skin, said lotion coating comprising:<br>
(i) from about 5 to about 95% of a substantially water free emollient having a plastic or fluid consistency at 20째C and comprising a member selected from the group consisting of petroleum based emollients, fatty acid ester emollients, alkyl ethoxylate emollients, polysiloxane emollients, and mixtures thereof;<br>
(ii) from about 5 to about 95% of a solid polyol polyester; and<br>
C)      an absorbent core positioned between said topsheet and said backsheet.<br>
The quantity of lotion coating on a least a portion of the diaper topsheets of the present invention preferably ranges from about 0.1 mg/in2 to about 25 mg/in2, more preferably from about 1 mg/in2 to about 10 mg/in2. Lotioned diaper topsheets according to the present invention provide desirable BM cleaning, therapeutic and/or protective lotion coating benefits. Because the emollient is substantially immobilized on the surface of the topsheet, less lotion composition is needed to impart the desired skin care benefits. In addition, special barrier or wrapping materials are unnecessary in packaging the lotioned diaper products of the present invention.<br>
As will be discussed hereinafter, the lotion compositions of the present invention preferably have a melting profile such that they are relatively immobile and localized on the diaper topsheet at room temperature, are transferable to the wearer at body temperature, and yet are not completely liquid under extreme storage conditions.<br>
Importantly, the lotion compositions of the present invention are easily transferable to the skin by way of normal contact, wearer motion, and/or body heat. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the lotion composition changes the surface energy of the skin, and/or forms a "barrier" reducing the affinity of the skin for BM. The BM, therefore, has a reduced tendency to stick to the skin, and is easier to remove. It is further believed that the polyol polyester molecules do not readily penetrate the wearer's skin, but remain at or near the skin's surface, providing a long-lasting, lubricious feel to the skin.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided   a disposable absorbent article with comprises:<br>
(a)	a liquid impervious backsheet;<br>
(b)	a liquid pervious topsheet joined to said backsheet, said topsheet having an inner surface oriented toward the interior of said absorbent article and an outer surface oriented toward the skin of the wearer when said diaper is being worn, wherein at least a portion of said topsheet outer surface comprises an effective amount of a lotion coating which is solid or semi-solid at 20째C and which is partially transferable to the wearer's skin, said lotion coating comprising:<br>
(i) from 5 to 95% of a substantially water free emollient having a plastic or fluid consistency at 20째C and comprising a member selected from petroleum based emollients, fatty acid ester emollients, alkyl ethoxylate emollients, polysiloxane emollients, silicone wax emollients, and mixtures thereof;<br>
(ii) from 5% to 95% of an agent capable of immobilizing said emollient on said outer surface of the topsheet, said immobilizing agent having a melting point of at least 35째C and comprising a solid polyol polyester comprising a polyhydric alcohol containing at least 4 hydroxyl groups esterified with fatty acid or other organic radicals having at least 2 carbon atoms and up to 30 carbon atoms; and<br>
(c)	an absorbent core positioned intermediate said topsheet and said<br>
backsheet.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, the term "comprising" means that the various components, ingredients, or steps, can be conjointly employed in practicing the present invention. Accordingly, the term "comprising" encompasses the more restrictive terms "consisting essentially of and "consisting of."<br>
All percentages, ratios and proportions used herein are by weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
A.       Absorbent Article<br>
As used herein, the term "absorbent article" refers to devices which absorb and contain body exudates, and more specifically, refers to devices which are placed against the skin of a wearer to absorb and contain the various exudates discharged from the body. The term "disposable" is used herein to describe absorbent articles which are not intended to be laundered or otherwise restored or reused as an absorbent article after a single use. Examples of disposable absorbent articles include feminine hygiene garments such as sanitary napkins and panti-liners, diapers, incontinence briefs, diaper holders, training pants, and the like.<br>
Disposable absorbent articles typically comprise a liquid pervious topsheet, a liquid impervious backsheet joined to the topsheet and an absorbent core positioned between the topsheet and the backsheet. Disposable absorbent articles and components thereof, including the topsheet, backsheet, absorbent core, and any individual layers of these components, have a body surface and a garment surface.  As used herein,<br>
"body surface" means that surface of the article or component which is intended to be worn toward or adjacent to the body of the wearer, while the "garment surface" is on the opposite side and is intended to be worn toward or placed adjacent to the wearer's body or undergarments when the disposable absorbent article is worn.<br>
The following description generally discusses the absorbent core, topsheet, and backsheet materials that are useful in disposable absorbent articles. It is to be understood that this general description applies to these components of the specific absorbent articles shown in Figure 3 and further described below, in addition to those of other disposable absorbent articles which are generally described herein.<br>
In general, the absorbent core is capable of absorbing or retaining liquids (e.g., menses, urine, and/or other body exudates). The absorbent core is preferably compressible, conformable, and non-irritating to the wearer's skin. The absorbent core may be manufactured in a wide variety of sizes and shapes (e.g., rectangular, oval, hourglass, "T" shaped, dog bone, asymmetric, etc.). In addition to the absorbent composites of the present invention, the absorbent core may include any of a wide variety of liquid-absorbent materials commonly used in absorbent articles, such as comminuted wood pulp, which is generally referred to as airfelt. Examples of other suitable absorbent materials for use in the absorbent core include creped cellulose wadding; meltblown polymers including coform; chemically stiffened, modified or cross-linked ceilulosic fibers; synthetic fibers such as crimped polyester fibers; peat moss; tissue including tissue wraps and tissue laminates; absorbent foams; absorbent sponges; superabsorbent polymers; absorbent gelling materials; or any equivalent material or combinations of materials, or mixtures of these.<br>
The configuration and construction of the absorbent core may also be varied (e.g., the absorbent core may have varying caliper zones and/or have a profile so as to be thicker in the center; hydrophilic gradients; gradients of the absorbent composite of the present invention, superabsorbent gradients; or lower average density and lower average basis weight zones, e.g., acquisition zones; or may comprise one or more layers or structures). The total absorbent capacity of the absorbent core should, however, be compatible with the design loading and the intended use of the absorbent article. Further, the size and absorbent capacity of the<br>
 absorbent core may be varied to accommodate different uses such as diapers, incontinence pads, pantiliners, regular sanitary napkins, and overnight sanitary napkins, and to accommodate wearers ranging from infants to adults.<br>
The absorbent core can include other absorbent components that are often used in absorbent articles, for example, a dusting layer, a wicking or acquisition layer, or a secondary topsheet for increasing the wearer's comfort.<br>
The topsheet is preferably compliant, soft feeling, and non-irritating to the wearer's skin. Further, the topsheet is liquid pervious, permitting liquids (e.g., menses and/or urine) to readily penetrate through its thickness. A suitable topsheet may be manufactured from a wide range of materials such as woven and nonwoven materials (e.g., a nonwoven web of fibers); polymeric materials such as apertured formed thermoplastic films, apertured plastic films, and hydroformed thermoplastic films; porous foams; reticulated foams; reticulated thermoplastic films; and thermoplastic scrims. Suitable woven and nonwoven materials can be comprised of natural fibers (e.g., wood or cotton fibers), synthetic fibers (e.g., polymeric fibers such as polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene fibers) or from a combination of natural and synthetic fibers. When the topsheet comprises a nonwoven web, the web may be manufactured by a wide number of known techniques. For example, the web may be spunbonded, carded, wet-laid, melt-blown, hydroentangled, combinations of the above, or the like.<br>
The backsheet is impervious to liquids (e.g., menses and/or urine) and is preferably manufactured from a thin plastic film, although other flexible liquid impervious materials may also be used. As used herein, the term "flexible" refers to materials which are compliant and will readily conform-to the general shape and contours of the human body. The backsheet prevents the exudates absorbed and contained in the absorbent core from wetting articles which contact the absorbent article such as bedsheets, pants, pajamas and undergarments. The backsheet may thus comprise a woven or nonwoven material, polymeric films such as thermoplastic films of polyethylene or polypropylene, or composite materials such as a film-coated nonwoven material. A suitable backsheet is a polyethylene film having a thickness of from about 0.012 mm (0.5 miJ) to about 0.051 mm (2.0 mils). Exemplary polyethylene films are manufactured<br>
by Clopay Corporation of Cincinnati, Ohio, under the designation P18-1401 and by Tredegar Film Products of Terre Haute, Indiana, under the designation XP-39385. The backsheet is preferably embossed and/or matte finished to provide a more clothlike appearance. Further, the backsheet may permit vapors to escape from the absorbent core (i.e., the backsheet is breathable) while still preventing exudates from passing through the backsheet. The size of the backsheet is dictated by the size of the absorbent core and the exact absorbent article design selected.<br>
The backsheet and the topsheet are positioned adjacent the garment surface and the body surface, respectively, of the absorbent core. The absorbent core is preferably joined with the topsheet, the backsheet, or both in any manner as is known by attachment means (not shown in Figure 3) such as those well known in the art. However, embodiments of the present invention are envisioned wherein portions of the entire absorbent core are unattached to either the topsheet, the backsheet, or both.<br>
For example, the backsheet and/or the topsheet may be secured to the absorbent core or to each other by a uniform continuous layer of adhesive, a patterned layer of adhesive, or an array of separate lines, spirals, or spots of adhesive. Adhesives which have been found to be satisfactory are manufactured by H. B. Fuller Company of St. Paul, Minnesota under the designation HL-1258 or H-2031. The attachment means will preferably comprise an open pattern network of filaments of adhesive as is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,573,986, issued to Minetola, et al. on March 4, 1986, andwhich is incorporated herein by reference. An exemplary attachment means of an open pattern network of filaments comprises several lines of adhesive filaments swirled into a spiral pattern such as illustrated by the apparatus and method shown in US. Patent  3911,173 issued to Sprague, Jr. on October 7, 1975; U.S. Patent   4,785,996 issued to Zwieker, et al. on November 22, 1978; and U.S. Patent   4,842,666 issued to Werenicz on June 27, 1989. Each of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the attachment means may comprise heat bonds, pressure bonds, ultrasonic bonds, dynamic mechanical bonds, or any other suitable attachment means or combinations of these attachment means as are known in the art.<br>
A preferred  disposable  absorbent  article  in  which  the  lotioned topsheets of the present invention may be used are diapers.    As used<br>
herein, the term "diaper" refers to an absorbent article generally worn by infants, and incontinent persons that is worn about the lower torso of the wearer. In other words, the term "diaper" includes infant diapers, training pants, adult incontinence devices, etc.<br>
Figure 3 is a plan view of the diaper 50 of the present invention in its flat-out, uncontracted state (i.e., with elastic induced contraction pulled out) with portions of the structure being cut-away to more clearly show the construction of the diaper 50 and with the portion of the diaper 50 which faces away from the wearer, the outer surface, oriented towards the viewer. As shown in Figure 3, the diaper 50 preferably comprises a liquid pervious topsheet 520; a liquid impervious backsheet 530 joined with the topsheet 520; an absorbent core 540 positioned between the topsheet 520 and the backsheet 530, the absorbent core 540 having a garment facing surface 542, a body facing surface 544, side edges 546, waist edges 548, and ears 549. The diaper 50 preferably further comprises elasticized leg cuffs 550; an elastic waist feature multiply designated as 560; and a fastening system generally multiply designated as 570.<br>
The diaper 50 is shown in Figure 3 to have an outer surface 52, an inner surface 54 opposed to the outer surface 52, a first waist region 56, a second waist region 58, and a periphery 51 which is defined by the outer edges of the diaper 50 in which the longitudinal edges are designated 55 and the end edges are designated 57. (While the skilled artisan will recognize that a diaper is usually described in terms of having a pair of waist regions and a crotch region between the waist regions, in this application, for simplicity of terminology, the diaper 50 is described as having only waist regions including a portion of the diaper which would typically be designated as part of the crotch region). The inner surface 54 of the diaper 50 comprises that portion of the diaper 50 which is positioned adjacent to the wearer's body during use (i.e., the inner surface 54 generally is formed by at least a portion of the topsheet 520 and other components that may be joined to the topsheet 520). The outer surface 52 comprises that portion of the diaper 50 which is positioned away from the wearer's body (i.e., the outer surface 52 generally is formed by at least a portion of the backsheet 530 and other components that may be joined to the backsheet 530). (As used herein, the portion of the diaper 50 or component thereof which faces the wearer is also referred to as the body facing surface.  Similarly, the portion<br>
facing away from the wearer is also referred to herein as the garment facing surface.) The first waist region 56 and the second waist region 58 extend, respectively, from the end edges 57 of the periphery 51 to the lateral centerline 53 of the diaper 50. Figure 3 also shows the longitudinal centerline 59.<br>
Figure 3 shows a preferred embodiment of the diaper 50 in which the topsheet 520 and the backsheet 530 have length and width dimensions generally larger than those of the absorbent core 540. The elasticized leg cuffs 550 and the backsheet 530 extend beyond the edges of the absorbent core 540 to thereby form the periphery 51 of the diaper 50.<br>
Diapers of the present invention can have a number of well known configurations, with the absorbent cores thereof being adapted to the present invention. Exemplary configurations are described generally in U.S. Patent 3,860,003 issued to Buell on January 14, 1975; U.S. Patent 5,151,092 issued to Buell et al. on September 29, 1BB2: U.S. Patent 5,221,274 issued to Buell et al. on June 22, 1993. Each of these patents is incorporated herein by reference. Another diaper configuration to which the present invention can be readily adapted are described in co-pendingJJ.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 08/203,456; filed on February 28, 1994 and incorporated herein by reference. The absorbent cores of diapers described in these patents can be adapted in light of the teachings herein to include the absorbent composite of the present invention as an absorbent gelling material described therein.<br>
A topsheet 520 which is particularly suitable for use in the diaper 50, is carded and thermally bonded by means well known to those skilled in the fabrics art. A satisfactory topsheet for the present invention comprises staple length polypropylene fibers having a denier of about 2.2 As used herein, the term "staple length fibers" refers to those fibers having a length of at least about 15.9 mm (0.625 inches). Preferably, the topsheet has a basis weight from about 14 to about 25 grams per square meter. A suitable topsheet is manufactured by Veratec, Inc., a Division of International Paper Company, of Walpole, Mass. under the designation P-8.<br>
The topsheet 520 of diaper 50 is preferably made of a hydrophilic material to promote rapid transfer of liquids (e.g., urine) through the topsheet. If the topsheet is made of a hydrophobic material, at least the upper surface of the topsheet is treated to be hydrophilic so that liquids will<br>
transfer through the topsheet more rapidly. This diminishes the likelihood that body exudates will flow off the topsheet rather than being drawn through the topsheet and being absorbed by the absorbent core. The topsheet can be rendered hydrophilic by treating it with a surfactant. Suitable methods for treating the topsheet with a surfactant include spraying the topsheet material with the surfactant and immersing the material into the surfactant. A more detailed discussion of such a treatment and hydrophilicity is contained in U.S. Patents 4,988,344 entitled "Absorbent Articles with Multiple Layer Absorbent Layers" issued to Reising, et al on January 29, 1991 and U.S. Patent 4,988,345 entitled "Absorbent Articles with Rapid Acquiring Absorbent Cores" issued to Reising on January 29, 1991, each of which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of a diaper as described herein, the backsheet 530 has a modified hourglass shape extending beyond the absorbent core a minimum distance of about 1.3 cm to about 6.4 cm (about 0.5 to about 2.5 inch) around the entire diaper periphery.<br>
The absorbent core 540 may take on any size or shape that is compatible with the diaper 50. One preferred embodiment of the diaper 50 has an asymmetric, modified T-shaped absorbent core 540 having ears in the first waist region but a generally rectangular shape in the second waist region. Exemplary absorbent structures for use as the absorbent core of the present invention that have achieved wide acceptance and commercial success are described in U.S. Patent 4,610,678 entitled "High-Density Absorbent Structures" issued to Weisman et al. on September 9,1986; U.S. Patent 4,673,402 entitled "Absorbent Articles With Dual-Layered Cores" issued to Weisman et al. on June 16, 1987; U.S. Patent 4,888,231 entitled "Absorbent Core Having A Dusting Layer" issued to Angstadt on December 19, 1989; and U.S. Patent 4,834,735, entitled "High Density Absorbent Members Having Lower Density and Lower Basis Weight Acquisition Zones", issued to Alemany et al. on May 30, 1989.

In a preferred embodiment, the diaper 50 further comprises elasticized leg cuffs 550 for providing improved containment of liquids and other body exudates; an elastic waist feature 560 that provides improved fit and containment; and a fastening system 570 which forms a side closure which maintains the first waist region 56 and the second waist region 58 in an overlapping configuration such that lateral tensions are maintained around the circumference of the diaper to maintain the diaper on the wearer. The diaper 50 may also comprise elasticized side panels (not shown) in the waist regions 56 and 58 to provide an elastically extensible feature that provides a more comfortable and contouring fit and more effective application of the diaper 50.<br>
The elasticized leg cuffs 550 can be constructed in a number of different configurations, including those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,860,003; U.S. Patent No. 4,909,803, issued to Aziz et al. on Mar. 20, 1990; U.S. Patent No. 4,695,278, issued to Lawson on Sep. 22, 1987; and U.S. Patent No. 4,795,454, issued to Dragoo on Jan. 3, 1989, each being incorporated herein by reference.<br>

The fastening system is then applied to effect a side closure.<br>
The lotioned topsheets of the present invention are also useful in disposable pull-on products. The term "pull-on products", as used herein, refers to disposable garments having fixed sides and leg openings. Pull-on products are placed in position on the wearer by inserting the wearer's legs into the leg openings and sliding the pull-on product into position about the wearer's lower torso. Exemplary pull-on products are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,246,433, issued to Hasse, et al. on September 21, 1993.<br>
Another disposable absorbent article for which the lotioned topsheets of the present invention are useful are incontinence articles. The term "incontinence article" refers to pads, undergarments (pads held in place by a_ suspension system of same type, such as a belt, or the like), inserts for absorbent articles, capacity boosters for absorbent articles, briefs, bed pads, and the like regardless of whether they are worn by adults or other incontinent persons. Suitable incontinence articles are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,253,461 issued to Strickland, et al. on March 3, 1981; U.S. Patent Nos. 4,597,760 and 4,597,761 issued to Buell; the above-mentioned U.S. Patent No. 4,704,115; U.S. Patent No. 4,909,802 issued to Ahr, et al.; U.S. Patent No. 4,964,860 issued to Gipson, et al. on October 23, 1990; and in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/637,090 filed by Noel, et al. on January 3, 1991 (PCT Publication No. WO 92/11830 published on July 23, 1992).<br>
B.       Lotion Composition<br>
The lotion compositions of the present invention may be solid, or more often semisolid, at 20째C, i.e. at ambient temperatures. By "semisolid" is meant that the lotion composition has a rheology typical of pseudoplastic or plastic fluids. When no shear is applied, the lotion compositions can have the appearance of a semi-solid but can be made to flow as the shear rate is increased. This is due to the fact that, while the lotion composition contains primarily solid components, it also includes some minor liquid components.<br>
The lotion compositions of the present invention are at least semisolid at room temperature to minimize lotion migration in embodiments wherein the lotion compositions are applied to the topsheet of a disposable absorbent article. In addition, the lotion compositions preferably have a final melting point (100% liquid) above potential "stressful" storage conditions that can be greater than 45째C (e.g., warehouse in Arizona, car trunk in Florida, etc.).<br>
Specifically, the lotion compositions of the present invention should have the following melt profile:<br>
Characteristic	Preferred Range	Most Preferred<br>
% liquid at	2-50	3-25<br>
room temp. (20 째C)<br>
% liquid at	25-95	30-90<br>
body temp. (37 째C)<br>
final melting point (째C)	&gt;38	짙45<br>
By being solid or semisolid at ambient temperatures, these lotion compositions do not have a tendency to flow and migrate into the interior of the diaper topsheet to which they are applied. This means less lotion composition is required for imparting desirable therapeutic or protective coating lotion benefits.<br>
When applied to outer surface of diaper topsheets, the lotion compositions of the present invention are transferable to the wearer's skin by normal contact, wearer motion, and/or body heat.    Importantly, the<br>
lotions disclosed in the present invention reduce the adherence of BM to the skin of the wearer, thereby improving the ease of BM clean up, and improve skin softness.<br>
The diaper topsheets of the present invention contain an effective amount of the lotion composition. As used herein, the term "effective amount of a lotion coating" refers to an amount of a particular lotion composition which, when applied to a diaper topsheet, will be effective in reducing the adherence of BM to the skin and/or improving the softness of the skin of the wearer. Of course, the effective amount of a lotion coating will depend, to a large extent, on the particular lotion composition used.<br>
The lotion compositions of the present invention comprise: (1) an emollient to improve the lubricity of the solid polyol polyester(s); (2) a solid polyol polyester(s) immobilizing agent; (3) optionally a hydrophilic surfactant(s); and (4) other optional components.<br>
The viscosity of the formulated lotion compositions, including emollient, immobilizing agent, and optional components should be as high as possible to keep the lotion from flowing into the interior of the diaper. Unfortunately, high viscosities can also lead to lotion compositions that are difficult to apply without processing problems. Therefore, a balance must be achieved so the viscosities are high enough to keep the lotion compositions localized on the surface of the diaper topsheet, but not so high as to cause processing problems. Suitable viscosities for the lotion compositions will typically range from about 5 to about 200 centipoises, preferably from about 15 to about 100 centipoises, measured at 60째C.<br>
Polvol Polyesters<br>
By "polyol" is meant a polyhydric alcohol containing at least 4, preferably from 4 to 12, and, most preferably from 6 to 8, hydroxyl groups. Polyols include monosaccharides, disaccharides and trisaccharides, sugar alcohols other sugar derivatives (e.g., alkyl glycosides), polyglycerols (e.g., diglycerol and triglycerol), pentaerythritol, and polyvinyl alcohols. Preferred polyols include xylose, arabinose, ribose, xylitol, erythritol, glucose, methyl glucoside, mannose, galactose, fructose, sorbitol, maltose, lactose, sucrose, raffinose, and maltotriose. Sucrose is an especially preferred polyol.<br>
By "polyol polyester" is meant a polyol having at least 4 ester groups. It is not necessary that all of the hydroxyl groups of the polyol be esterified, however disaccharides polyesters should have no more than 3, and more preferably no more than 2 unesterified hydroxyl groups. Typically, substantially all (e.g., at least about 85%) of the hydroxyl groups of the polyol are esterified. In the case of sucrose polyesters, typically from about 7 to 8 of the hydroxyl groups of the polyol are esterified.<br>
By "liquid polyol polyester" is meant a polyol polyester from the hereinafter described groups having a fluid consistency at or below about 37째C. By "solid polyol polyester" is meant a polyol polyester from the hereinafter described groups having a plastic or solid consistency at or above about 37째C. As hereinafter described, liquid polyol polyesters and solid polyol polyesters may be successfully employed as emollients and immobilizing agents, respectively, in lotion compositions of the present invention. In some cases, solid polyol polyesters may also provide some emolliency functionality.<br>
Fatty acids and/or other organic radicals having at least 2 carbon atoms and up to 30 carbon atoms can be used to esterify the polyol. Typically they contain from 8-22 carbon atoms, and more typically at least 12-16 carbon atoms. The acid radicals can be saturated or unsaturated, including positional or geometrical isomers, e.g. cis- or trans-isomers. straight chain or branched chain aliphatic or aromatic, and can be the same for all ester groups, or can be mixtures of different acid radicals. Cyclic aliphatics such as cyclohexane carboxylic and polymeric ester-forming radicals such as polyacrylic and dimer fatty acid can also be used to esterify the polyol.<br>
Liquid polyol polyesters and nondigestible oils have a complete melting point at or below about 37째C. Suitable liquid nondigestible edible oils for use herein include liquid polyol polyesters (see Mattson &amp; Volpenhein, U.S. Patent 3,600,186 issued August 17, 1971, Jandacek; U.S. Patent 4,005,195; Issued January 25, 1977); liquid esters of tricarballylic acids (see Hamm; U.S. Patent 4,508,746; Issued April 2, 1985); liquid diesters of dicarboxylic acids such as derivatives of malonic and succinic acid (see Fulcher, U.S. Patent 4,582,927; Issued April 15, 1986); liquid triglycerides of alpha-branched chain carboxylic acids (see Whyte; U.S. Patent 3,579,548; Issued May 18, 1971); liquid ethers and ether esters<br>
containing the neopentyl moiety (see Minich; U.S. Patent 2,962,419; Issued Nov. 9, 1960); liquid fatty polyethers of polyglycerol (See Hunter et^al; U.S. Patent 3,932,532; Issued Jan. 13, 1976); liquid alkyl glycoside fatty acid polyesters (see Meyer et al; U.S. Patent 4,840,815; Issued June 20, 1989); liquid polyesters of two ether linked hydroxypolycarboxylic acids (e.g., citric or isocitric acid) (see Huhn et al; U.S. Patent 4,888,195; Issued December 19, 1988); and liquid esters of epoxide-extended polyols (see White et ai; U.S. Patent 4,861,613; Issued August 29, 1989).<br>
Preferred liquid nondigestible oils are sugar polyesters, sugar alcohol polyesters, and mixtures thereof, preferably esterified with fatty acids containing from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, and most preferably from fatty acids having 8 to 18 carbon atoms. Those which have minimal or no solids at body temperatures (i.e., 98.6째F, 37째C) usually contain ester groups having a high proportion of C12 or lower fatty acid radicals or else a high proportion of C18 or higher unsaturated fatty acid radicals. Preferred unsaturated fatty acids in such liquid polyol polyesters are oleic acid, linoleic acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Nondigestible polyol polyester hardstock or solid materials suitable for use herein can be selected from solid sugar polyesters, solid sugar alcohol polyesters and mixtures thereof, and contain ester groups, e.g. generally 5 to 8 ester groups, which consist essentially of long chain saturated fatty acid radicals. Suitable saturated fatty acid radicals contain at least 14, preferably from 14 to 26, most preferably from 16 to 22, carbon atoms. The long chain saturated fatty acid radicals can be used singly or in mixtures with each other. In addition, straight chain (i.e. normal) fatty acid radicals are typical for the long chain saturated fatty acid radicals.<br>
Certain intermediate melting polyol fatty acid polyesters have been developed that have a specific rheology that defines their physical properties, i.e., their melting points, viscosity, shear rates and shear viscosities and crystal size and shape are also useful. (See Bernhardt; European Patent Application Nos. 236,288 and 233,856; Published September 9, and August 26, 1987, respectively.) These intermediate melting polyol polyesters are viscous and have a high liquid/solid stability at body temperature that makes them good for coating skin. An example of such intermediate melting polyol polyesters are those obtained by substantially completely esterifying sucrose with a 55:45 mixture of fully<br>
hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated cottonseed or soybean oil fatty acid methyl esters.<br>
Preferred liquid polyol polyesters comprise sucrose polyesters. Especially preferred liquid polyol polyesters comprise sucrose esterified with a mixture of fully hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated cottonseed or soybean oil fatty acid methyl esters, or mixtures thereof, hereinafter referred to as sucrose polycottonate and sucrose polysoyate, respectively.<br>
Blends of completely liquid polyol polyesters with completely solid polyol polyester hardstocks, preferably esterified with C10 - C22 saturated fatty acids (e.g. sucrose octastearate), can be solid at room temperature. (See, for example, Jandacek; U.S. Patent 4,005,195; and Jandacek/Mattson; U.S. Patent 4,005,196; both issued January 25, 1977, and both of which are incorporated herein by reference.)<br>
Liquid or solid polyol polyesters can be prepared by a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art. These methods include: transesterification of the polyol (i.e. sugar or sugar alcohol) with methyl, ethyl or glycerol esters containing the desired acid radicals using a variety of catalysts; acylation of the polyol with an acid chloride; acylation of the polyol with an acid anhydride; and acylation of the polyol with the desired acid, per se. (See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,831,854, 3,600,186, 3,963,699, 4,517,360 and 4,518,772, all of which are incorporated by reference. These patents all disclose suitable methods for preparing polyol polyesters.)<br>
When making mixtures of liquid and solid nondigestible and nonabsorbable materials, the nondigestible particles can be dispersed as discrete, unaggregated entities in the liquid nondigestible oil. However, these nondigestible particles can also cluster together to form much larger aggregates which are dispersed in the liquid nondigestible oil. This is particularly true of those nondigestible particles that are platelet-like in form. Aggregates of platelet-like nondigestible particles typically assume a spherulitic shape that is porous in character and thus capable of entrapping significant amounts of liquid nondigestible oil.<br>
Solid nondigestible particles can be used alone or dispersed in the nondigestible liquid oil component.<br>
Diversely Esterified Polyol Polyesters<br>
"Diversely esterified polyol polyesters" contain two basic -types of ester groups: (a) groups formed from long chain saturated fatty acids radicals, and (b) groups formed from acid radicals which are "dissimilar" to these long chain saturated fatty acid radicals.<br>
Suitable long chain saturated fatty acid radicals contain from 20 to 30, most preferably 22-26, carbon atoms. The long chain saturated fatty acid radicals can be used singly, or in mixtures with each other, in all proportions. Usually, straight chain (i.e. normal) fatty acid radicals are used.<br>
The dissimilar radicals can comprise C12 or higher unsaturated fatty acid radicals or C2-C12 saturated fatty acid radicals or mixtures thereof, or can be fatty-fatty acids aromatic acid radicals, or ultra-long chain fatty acids or various branched cyclic or substituted acid radicals.<br>
Preferred "dissimilar" acid radicals comprises long chain unsaturated fatty acid radicals, containing at least 12, preferably from 12 to 26, more preferably from 18 to 22 carbon atoms and short chain saturated fatty acid radicals having from 2 to 12 and preferably from 6 to 12 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof.<br>
A more preferred solid polyol polyester comprises a sucrose octaester wherein, on average, 7 of the 8 sucrose hydroxyl groups have been esterified with behenic acid and the remaining group has been esterified with a short chain fatty acid having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms. In an especially preferred embodiment, the short chain fatty acid comprises oleic acid. Said solid sucrose polyesters wherein about 7 of the sucrose hydroxl groups have been esterified with behenic acid are hereinafter referred Jo as sucrose behenate.<br>
Fatty-fatty acid radicals are a fatty acid radical having at least one hydroxyl group that is itself esterified with another fatty acid or other organic acid. Ricinoleic acid is a preferred hydroxy-fatty acid. Sources of hydroxy-fatty acids include hydrogenated castor oil, strophanthus seed oils, calendula officinalis seed oils, hydrogenated strophanthus seed oils and hydrogenated calendula officinalis seed oils, cardamine impatiens seed oils, kamala oils, mallotus discolor oils, and mallotus claoxyloides oils.<br>
Hydroxy fatty acids can also be synthetically prepared by oxidative hydroxylation of unsaturated fatty acids using oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate, osmium tetroxide, and peracids "such as peracetic acid. Using this method, 9, 10-dihydroxy-octadecanoic acid can be made from oleic acid, and 9, 10, 12, 13-tetrahydroxy-octadecanoic acid can be made from linoleic acid. Another way to prepare hydroxy fatty acids, such as 10-hydroxy-12-cis-octadecenoic and 10-hydroxy-12 cis, 15-cis-octadecactanoic acids, synthetically is by conversion of fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic via microorganisms such as Nocardia Cholesteroliim.<br>
The same fatty acids sources used for esterification of the polyols can be used for esterification of the hydroxyl group of the hydroxy-fatty acid radical. These include aromatic acids such as benzoic or toluic; branched chain radicals such as isobutyric, neoctanoic or methyl stearic acids; ultra-long chain saturated or unsaturated fatty acid radicals, such as triconsanoic or triconsenoic; cyclic aliphatics such as cyclohexane carboxylic; and polymeric ester-forming radicals such as polyacrylic and dimer fatty acid.<br>
Aromatic acid radicals can also be used as a dissimilar ester group. A wide variety of aromatic compounds including benzoic compounds such as benzoic or toluic acid; amino benzoic compounds such as amino benzoic and aminomethyl benzoic acids; hydroxybenzoic compounds such as hydroxybenzoic, vanillic and salicylic acids; methoxybenzoic compounds such as anisic acid; acetoxyphenylacetic compounds such as acetylmandelic acid; and halobenzoic compounds such as chlorobenzoic, dichlorobenzoic, and fluorobenzoic acids; acetyl benzoic, cumic, phenylbenzoic, and nicotinic; and polycyclic aromatic radicals including fluorene carboxylic can be used singly, or in mixtures with each other, in all proportions.<br>
Various other ester-forming radicals can also serve as those which form the dissimilar ester groups of the diversely esterified polyol polyester particles used herein. Such other radicals can be branched alkyl chain; ultra-long chain saturated or unsaturated radicals; cyclic aliphatic radicals including cyclobutane carboxylic, cyclopentane carboxylic, cyclohexane carboxylic, cyclohexane acetic, and hydroxycyclic such as ascorbic; polycyclic aliphatic such as abietic acid; polymeric ester-forming radicals such as polyacrylic and dimer fatty acid; and alkyl chain radicals containing halogen amino or aryl groups.<br>
The diversely esterified polyol polyesters can be prepared by esterifying the desired polyol with the requisite type of ester-forming radicals by the methods described for making polyol polyesters. When using a methyl ester route to prepare these diversely esterified solid polyol polyesters having mixed dissimilar acid radicals and long chain saturated fatty acid radicals, the octaester of one of the types of acids (e.g., dissimilar acids, or long chain saturated fatty acids) can be prepared first, followed by partial interesterification of this initial reaction product with the methyl ester of the other type of acid.<br>
Polyol Polyester Polymers<br>
Other solid nondigestible polyol polyesters comprise polyol polyester polymers. Polyol polyester polymers are formed by polymerizing a polyol polyester monomer to provide a molecule having at least two separate esterified polyol moieties linked by covalent bonds between the fatty acid radicals. For example, two sucrose octabehenate monomers could be cross-linked between fatty acids to form a polymer. Repeating units of such polyol polyester polymers can be the same or different such that the generic term "polymer" in this context includes the specific term "copolymer". The number of repeating monomer (or co-monomer) units which make up such polyol polyester polymers can range from about 2 to 20, preferably from about 2 to 12. Depending on the method of preparing them, the polyol polyester polymers are frequently oligomers containing from 2 to 4 monomeric units, i.e., dimers, trimers, or tetramers.<br>
The most preferred the polyol polyester polymers are sucrose polyester polymers having a number average molecular weight of from about 4000 to about 60,000, preferably from about 4000 to about 36,000, more preferably from about 5000 to about 12,000.<br>
One way to prepare solid polyol polyester polymers is by polymerizing polyol polyesters using well known methods, including, but not limited to, photochemical reactions and reactions with transition metal ions, heat or free radical initiators such as di-tert-butyl peroxide.<br>
Alternatively, polyol polyester polymers can be prepared directly by esterifying and/or interesterifying the polyol material with polybasic polymerized fatty acids or their derivatives. For example, the polyol polyester polymers could be prepared by reacting the acid chlorides or acid<br>
anhydrides of the desired polymer acids with sucrose, preferably using a sequential esterification process. Polyol polyester polymers cart also be prepared by reacting methyl esters of the desired polymer acids with sucrose in the presence of a fatty acid soap and a basic catalyst such as potassium carbonate.<br>
Common examples of polymerizable acids are those containing two or more double bonds (polyunsaturated acids) such as the linoleic acid, linolenic and eleostearic acids. parinaric acid, eicosadienoic acid, eicosatetraenoic acid, arachidonic acid, 5,13-docosadienoic acid and clupanodonic acid. Monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic, elaidic and erucic acids, can also be used in preparing suitable long chain fatty acid dimers which in turn can then be used to form the solid polyol polyester polymers. Preferred polybasic polymerized fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives for use in preparing polymer-containing polyol polyesters include dibasic acids produced by dimerization of the fatty acids or fatty acid lower esters derived from polyunsaturated vegetable oils such as soybean oil or cottonseed oil or from animal fats such as tallow.<br>
All of the foregoing types of polybasic polymerized fatty acids may themselves be made by a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art. (See Lutton; U.S. Patent 3,353,967; Issued November 21, 1967, Goebel; U.S. Patent 2,482,761; Issued September 27, 1949, Harrison et al; U.S. Patent 2,731,481; Issued January 17, 1956 and Barrett et al; U.S. Patent 2,793,219; Issued May 21,1957, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.)<br>
1.   Emollient<br>
A key active ingredient in lotion compositions of this invention is one or more-emollients. As used herein, an emollient is a material that softens, soothes, supples, coats, lubricates, moisturizes, or cleanses the skin. An emollient typically accomplishes several of these objectives such as soothing, moisturizing, and lubricating the skin. For the purposes of the present invention, these emollients have either a plastic or fluid consistency at 20째C, i.e., at ambient temperatures. This particular emollient consistency allows the lotion composition to impart a soft, lubricious, lotion-like feel.<br>
The emollients useful in the present invention are also substantially free of water.   By "substantially free of water" is meant that water is not<br>
intentionally added to the emollient. Addition of water to the emollient is not necessary in preparing or using the lotion compositions of the present invention and could require an additional drying step. However, minor or trace quantities of water in the emollient that are picked up as a result of, for example, ambient humidity can be tolerated without adverse effect. Typically, the emollients used in the present invention contain about 5% or less water, preferably about 1% or less water, most preferably about 0.5% or less water.<br>
Emollients useful in the present invention can be petroleum-based, fatty acid ester type, alkyl ethoxylate type, fatty acid ester ethoxylates, fatty alcohol type, polysiloxane type, or mixtures of these emollients. Suitable petroleum-based emollients include those hydrocarbons, or mixtures of hydrocarbons, having chain lengths of from 16 to 32 carbon atoms. Petroleum based hydrocarbons having these chain lengths include mineral oil (also known as "liquid petrolatum") and petrolatum (also known as "mineral wax," "petroleum jelly" and "mineral jelly"). Mineral oil usually refers to less viscous mixtures of hydrocarbons having from 16 to 20 carbon atoms. Petrolatum usually refers to more viscous mixtures of hydrocarbons having from 16 to 32 carbon atoms. Petrolatum and mineral oil are particularly preferred emollients for lotion compositions of the present invention.<br>
Suitable fatty acid ester type emollients include those derived from C12-C28 fattu acids  preferably C16-C22 saturated fatty acids, and short chain (Ci-Cs, preferably C1-C3) monohydric alcohols. Representative examples of such esters include methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, isopropyl laurate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, ethylhexyl palmitate and mixtures thereof. Suitable fatty acid ester emollients can also be derived from esters of longer chain fatty alcohols (C12-C28. Preferably C12-C16) and shorter chain fatty acids e.g., lactic acid, such as lauryl lactate and cetyl lactate.<br>
Suitable alkyl ethoxylate type emollients include C12-C22 fatty alcohol ethoxylates having an average degree of ethoxylation of from about 2 to about 30. Preferably, the fatty alcohol ethoxylate emollient is selected from the group consisting of lauryl, cetyl, and stearyl ethoxylates, and mixtures thereof, having an average degree of ethoxylation ranging from about 2 to about 23.   Representative examples of such alkyl ethoxylates<br>
include laureth-3 (a lauryl ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 3), laureth-23 (a lauryl ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 23), ceteth-10 (a cetyl alcohol ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 10) and steareth-10 (a stearyl alcohol ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 10). These alkyl ethoxylate emollients are typically used in combination with the petroleum-based emollients, such as petrolatum, at a weight ratio of alkyl ethoxylate emollient to petroleum-based emollient of from about 1:1 to about 1:5, preferably from about 1:2 to about 1:4.<br>
Suitable fatty alcohol type emollients include C12-C22 fatty alcohols preferably C16-Cl8 fatty alcohols. Representative examples include cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. These fatty alcohol emollients are typically used in combination with the petroleum-based emollients, such as petrolatum, at a weight ratio of fatty alcohol emollient to petroleum-based emollient of from about 1:1 to about 1:5, preferably from about 1:1 to about 1:2.<br>
Other suitable types of emollients for use in the present invention include polysiloxane compounds. In general suitable polysiloxane materials for use in the present invention include those having monomeric siloxane units of the following structure:   (Structure Removed)<br>
whereinr Ri and R2, for each independent siloxane monomeric unit can each independently be hydrogen or any alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkaryl, arakyl, cycloalkyl, halogenated hydrocarbon, or other radical. Any of such radicals can be substituted or unsubstituted. Ri and R2 radicals of any particular monomeric unit may differ from the corresponding functionalities of the next adjoining monomeric unit. Additionally, the polysiloxane can be either a straight chain, a branched chain or have a cyclic structure. The radicals Ri and R2 can additionally independently be other silaceous functionalities such   as,   but   not   limited   to   siloxanes,   polysiloxanes,   silanes,   and<br>
polysilanes. The radicals Ri and R2 may contain any of a variety of organic functionalities including, for example, alcohol, carboxylic acid, phenyl, and amine functionalities.<br>
Exemplary alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, octadecyl, and the like. Exemplary alkenyl radicals are vinyl, ally!, and the like. Exemplary aryl radicals are phenyl, diphenyl, naphthyt, and the like. Exemplary alkaryl radicals are toyl, xylyl, ethylphenyl, and the like. Exemplary aralkyl radicals are benzyl, alpha-phenylethyl, beta-phenylethyl, alpha-phenylbutyl, and the like. Exemplary cycloalkyl radicals are cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and the like. Exemplary halogenated hydrocarbon radicals are chloromethyl, bromoethyl, tetrafluorethyl, fluorethyl, trifluorethyl, trifluorotloyl, hexafluoroxylyl, and the like.<br>
Viscosity of polysiloxanes useful may vary as widely as the viscosity of polysiloxanes in general vary, so long as the polysiloxane is flowabie or can be made to be flowabie for application to the diaper topsheet. This includes, but is not limited to, viscosity as low as 5 centistokes (at 37째C as measured by a glass viscometer) to about 20,000,000 centistokes. Preferably the polysiloxanes have a viscosity at 37째C ranging from about 5 to about 5,000 centistokes, more preferably from about 5 to about 2,000 centistokes, most preferably from about 100 to about 1000 centistokes. High viscosity polysiloxanes which themselves are resistant to flowing can be effectively deposited upon the diaper topsheets by such methods as, for example, emulsifying the polysiloxane in surfactant or providing the polysiloxane in solution with the aid of a solvent, such as hexane, listed for exemplary purposes only. Particular methods for applying polysiloxane emollients to diaper topsheets are discussed in more detail hereinafter.<br>
Preferred polysiloxanes compounds for use in the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,059,282 (Ampulski et al), issued October 22, 1991, which is incorporated herein by reference. Particularly preferred polysiloxane compounds for use as emollients in the lotion compositions of the present invention include phenyl-functional polymethylsiloxane compounds (e.g., Dow Corning 556 Cosmetic-Grade Fluid: polyphenylmethylsiloxane) and cetyl or stearyl functionalized dimethicones such as Dow 2502 and Dow 2503 polysiloxane fluids, respectively.    In<br>
addition to such substitution with phenyl-functional or alkyl groups , effective substitution may be made with amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, polyether, aldehyde, ketone, amide, ester, and thiol groups. Of these effective substituent groups, the family of groups comprising phenyl, amino, alkyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups are more preferred than the others; and phenyl-functional groups are most preferred.<br>
Besides petroleum-based emollients, fatty acid ester emollients, fatty acid ester ethoxylates, alkyl ethoxylate emollients fatty alcohol emollients, and polysiloxanes, the emollients useful in the present invention can include minor amounts (e.g., up to about 10% of the total emollient) of other, conventional emollients. These other, conventional emollients include propylene glycol, glycerine, triethylene glycol, spermaceti or other waxes, fatty acids, and fatty alcohol ethers having from 12 to 28 carbon atoms in their fatty chain, such as stearic acid, propoxylated fatty alcohols; glycerides, acetoglycerides, and ethoxylated glycerides of C12-C28 fatty acids; other fatty esters of polyhydroxy alcohols; lanolin and its derivatives. These other emollients should be included in a manner such that the solid or semisolid characteristics of the lotion composition are maintained.<br>
Other suitable emollients include the hereinbefore described liquid polyol polyesters.<br>
The amount of emollient that can be included in the lotion composition will depend on a variety of factors, including the particular emollient involved, the lotion-like benefits desired, the other components in the lotion composition and like factors. The lotion composition can comprise from about 5 to about 95% of the emollient. Preferably, the lotion composition comprises from about 10 to about 90%, most preferably from about 15 to about 85%, of the emollient.<br>
2.   Immobilizing Agent<br>
Another key component of the lotion compositions of the present invention is a solid polyol polyester hereinbefore described capable of immobilizing the emollient on the diaper topsheet to which the lotion composition is applied. Optionally, an additional immobilizing agent(s), hereinafter described, may be incorporated in said lotion compositions. Because the emollient in the composition has a fluid consistency at<br>
common ambient temperatures (about 20째C), it tends to flow or migrate, even when subjected to modest shear. When applied to a diaper topsheet, especially in a melted or molten state, the emollient will not remain primarily on the surface of the topsheet. Instead, the emollient will tend to migrate and flow into the interior of the diaper.<br>
This migration of the emollient into the interior of the diaper can cause undesired effects on the absorbency of the diaper core due to the hydrophobic characteristics of many of the emollients used in the lotion compositions of the present invention. It also means that much more emollient has to be applied to the diaper topsheet to get the desired therapeutic or protective lotion benefits. Increasing the level of emollient not only increases the cost, but also exacerbates the undesirable effect on the absorbency of the diaper core.<br>
The immobilizing agent counteracts this tendency of the emollient to migrate or flow by keeping the emollient primarily localized on the surface of the diaper topsheet to which the lotion composition is applied. This is believed to be due, in part, to the fact that the immobilizing agent raises the melting point of the lotion composition above that of the emollient. Since the immobilizing agent is also miscible with the emollient (or solubilized in the emollient with the aid of an appropriate emulsifier), it entraps the emollient on the surface of the diaper topsheet as well.<br>
It is also advantageous to "lock" the immobilizing agent on the surface of the diaper topsheet. This can be accomplished by using immobilizing agents which quickly crystallize (i.e., solidify) at the surface of the topsheet. In addition, outside cooling of the treated diaper topsheet via blowers, fans, etc. can speed up crystallization of the immobilizing agent.<br>
In addition to being miscible with (or solubilized in) the emollient, the immobilizing agent needs to have a melting point of at least about 35째C. This is so the immobilizing agent itself will not have a tendency to migrate or flow. Preferred immobilizing agents will have melting points of at least about 40째C. Typically, the immobilizing agent will have a melting point in the range of from about 50째 to about 1508C.<br>
Suitable additional immobilizing agents for the present invention can comprise a member selected from the group consisting of C14-C22 fatty alcohols,  C12-C22 fatty acids and C12-C22 fatty alcohol ethoxylates<br>
having an average degree of ethoxylation ranging from 2 to about 30, and mixtures thereof. Preferred immobilizing agents include C16-C18 fatty alcohols, most preferably selected from the group consisting of cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Mixtures of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol are particularly preferred. Other preferred immobilizing agents include C16-C18 fatty acids, most preferably selected from the group consisting of palmitic acid, stearic acid, and mixtures thereof. Mixtures of palmitic acid and stearic acid are particularly preferred. Still other preferred immobilizing agents include C16-C18 fatty alchol ethoxylates having an average degree of ethoxylation ranging from about 5 to about 20. Preferably, the fatty alcohols, fatty acids and fatty alcohols are linear.<br>
Importantly, these preferred additional immobilizing agents such as the C16- C18 fatty alcohols increase the rate of crystallization of the lotion causing the lotion to crystallize rapidly onto the surface of the substrate. Lower lotion levels can therefore be utilized or a superior lotion feel can be delivered. Traditionally, greater amounts of lotion were needed to generate softness because of the flow of these liquids into the diaper core.<br>
Other types of immobilizing agents can be used either alone or in combination with the fatty alcohols, fatty acids, and fatty alcohol ethoxylates described above. Examples of these other types of immobilizing agents includes polyhydroxy fatty acid esters, polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, and mixtures thereof. Preferred esters and amides will have three or more free hydroxy groups on the polyhydroxy moiety and are typically nonionic in character. Because of the possible skin sensitivity of those using diaper topsheets to which the lotion composition is applied, these esters and amides should also be relatively mild and non-irritating to the skin.<br>
Suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention will have the formula: '<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is a C5-C31 hydrocarbyl group, preferably straight chain C7-C-19 alkyl or alkenyl, more preferably straight chain C9-C17 alkyl or alkenyl, most preferably straight chain C11-C17 alkyl or alkenyl, or mixture thereof; Y is a polyhydroxyhydrocarbyl moiety having a hydrocarbyl chain with at least 2 free hydroxyls directly connected to the chain; and n is at least 1. Suitable Y groups can be derived from polyols such as glycerol, pentaerythritol; sugars such as raffinose, maltodextrose, galactose, sucrose, glucose, xylose, fructose, maltose, lactose, mannose and erythrose; sugar alcohols such as erythritol, xylitol, malitol, mannitol and sorbitol; and anhydrides of sugar alcohols such as sorbitan.<br>
One class of suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention comprises certain sorbitan esters, preferably the sorbitan esters of C16-C-22 saturated fatty acids. Because of the manner in which they are typically manufactured, these sorbitan esters usually comprise mixtures of mono-, di-, tri-, etc. esters. Representative examples of suitable sorbitan esters include sorbitan palmitates (e.g., SPAN 40), sorbitan stearates (e.g., SPAN 60), and sorbitan behenates, that comprise one or more of the mono-, di- and tri-ester versions of these sorbitan esters, e.g., sorbitan mono-, di- and tri-palmitate, sorbitan mono-, di- and tri-stearate, sorbitan mono-, di and tri-behenate, as well as mixed tallow fatty acid sorbitan mono-, di- and tri-esters. Mixtures of different sorbitan esters can also be used, such as sorbitan palmitates with sorbitan stearates. Particularly preferred sorbitan esters are the sorbitan stearates, typically as a mixture of mono-, di- and tri-esters (plus some tetraester) such as SPAN 60, and sorbitan stearates sold under the trade name GLYCOMUL-S by Lonza, Inc. Although these sorbitan esters typically contain mixtures of mono-, di- and tri-esters, plus some tetraester, the mono- and di-esters are usually the predominant species in these mixtures.<br>
Another class of suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention comprises certain glyceryl monoesters, preferably glyceryl<br>
monoesters of C16-C22 saturated fatty acids such as glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl monopalmitate, and glyceryl monobehenate. Again, like the sorbitan esters, glyceryl monoester mixtures will typically contain some di- and triester. However, such mixtures should contain predominantly the glyceryl monoester species to be useful in the present invention.<br>
Another class of suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention comprise certain sucrose fatty acid esters, preferably the C12-C22 saturated fatty acid esters of sucrose. Sucrose monoesters and diesters are particularly preferred and include sucrose mono- and di-stearate and sucrose mono- and di- laurate.<br>
Suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid amides for use in the present invention will have the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is H, C1-C4 hydrocarbyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, methoxyethyl, methoxypropyl or a mixture thereof, preferably C1-C4 alkyl, methoxyethyl or methoxypropyl, more preferably C-| or C2 alkyl or methoxypropyl , most preferably C1 alkyl (i.e., methyl) or methoxypropyl; and R2 is a C5-C31 hydrocarbyl group, preferably straight chain C7-C19 alkyl or alkenyl, more preferably straight chain C9-C17 alkyl or alkenyl, most preferably straight chain C11-C17 alkyl or alkenyl, or mixture thereof; and Z is a polyhydroxyhydrocarbyl moiety having a linear hydrocarbyl chain with at least 3 hydroxy Is directly connected to the chain. See U.S. patent 5,174, 927 (Honsa), issued December 29, 1992 (herein incorporated by reference) which discloses these polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, as well as their preparation.<br>
The Z moiety preferably will be derived from a reducing sugar in a reductiye amination reaction; most preferably glycityl. Suitable reducing sugars include glucose, fructose, maltose, lactose, galactose, mannose, and xylose. High dextrose corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, and high maltose corn syrup can be utilized, as well as the individual sugars listed above. These corn syrups can yield mixtures of sugar components for the Z moiety.<br>
The Z moiety preferably will be selected from the group consisting of -CH2-(CHOH)n-CH20H, -CH(CH2OHH(CHOH)n-i]-CH20H, -CH2OH-CH2-(CHOH)2(CHOR3)(CHOH)-CH2OH, where n is an integer from 3 to 5,<br>
and R3 is H or a cyclic or aliphatic monosaccharide. Most preferred are the glycityls where n is 4, particularly -CH2-(CHOH)4-CH20H.<br>
In the above formula, R1 can be, for example, N-methyl, N-ethyl, N-propyl, N-isopropyl, N-butyl, N-2-hydroxyethyl, N-methoxypropyl or N-2-hydroxypropyl,. R2 can be selected to provide, for example, cocamides, stearamides, oleamides, lauramides, myristamides, capricamides, palmitamides, tallowamides, etc. The Z moiety can be 1-deoxyglucityl, 2-deoxyfructityl, 1-deoxymaltityl, 1-deoxylactityl, 1-deoxygalactityl, 1-deoxymannityl, 1-deoxymaltotriotityl, etc.<br>
The most preferred polyhydroxy fatty acid amides have the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is methyl or methoxypropyl; R2 is a C-11-C17 straight-chain alkyl or alkenyl group. These include N-lauryl-N-methyl glucamide, N-lauryl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide, N-cocoyl-N-methyl glucamide, N-cocoyl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide, N-palmityl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide, N-tallowyl-N-methyl glucamide, or N-tallowyl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide.<br>
As previously noted, some of the immobilizing agents require an emulsifier for solubilization in the emollient. This is particularly the case for certain of the glucamides such as the N-alkyl-N-methoxypropyl glucamides having HLB values of at least about 7. Suitable emulsifiers will typically include those having HLB values below about 7. In this regard, the sorbitan esters previously described, such as the sorbitan stearates, having HLB values of about 4.9 or less have been found useful in solubilizing these glucamide immobilizing agents in petrolatum. Other suitable emulsifiers include steareth-2 (polyethylene glycol ethers of stearyl alcohol that conform to the formula CH3(CH2)i7(OCH2CH2)nOH, where n has an average value of 2), sorbitan tristearate, isosorbide laurate, and glyceryl monostearate. The emulsifier can be included in an amount sufficient to solubilize the immobilizing agent in the emollient such that a substantially<br>
homogeneous mixture is obtained. For example, an approximately 1:1 mixture of N-cocoyl-N-methyl glucamide and petrolatum that will normally not melt into a single phase mixture, will melt into a single phase mixture upon the addition of 20% of a 1:1 mixture of Steareth-2 and sorbitan tristearate as the emulsifier.<br>
Other types of ingredients that can be used as immobilizing agents, either alone, or in combination with the above-mentioned immobilizing agents, include waxes such as carnauba, beeswax, candelilla, paraffin, ceresin, esparto, ouricuri, rezowax, and other known waxes. Preferably the wax is a paraffin wax. An example of a particularly preferred paraffin wax is parrafin S.P. 434 from Strahl and Pitsch Inc. P.O. Box 1098 West Babylon, NY 11704.<br>
The amount of immobilizing agent that should be included in the lotion composition will depend on a variety of factors, including the particular emollient involved, the particular immobilizing agent involved, whether an emulsifier is required to solubilize the immobilizing agent in the emollient, the other components in the lotion composition and like factors. The lotion composition can comprise from about 5 to about 95% of the immobilizing agent. Preferably, the lotion composition comprises from about 5 to about 50%, most preferably from about 10 to about 40%, of the immobilizing agent.<br>
3.   Optional Hvdrophilic Surfactant<br>
As mentioned above, it is highly desirable that the diaper topsheet is made of a hydrophilic material to promote rapid transfer of liquids (e.g., urine) through the topsheet. Similarly, it is important that the lotion composition also be sufficiently wettable to ensure that liquids will transfer through the topsheet more rapidly. This diminishes the likelihood that body exudates will flow off the lotion coating rather than being drawn through the topsheet and being absorbed by the absorbent core. Depending upon the particular immobilizing agent used in the lotion composition of the present invention, an additional hydrophilic surfactant (or a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants) may, or may not, be required to improve wettability. For example, some immobilizing agents, such as N-cocoyl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide have HLB values of at least about 7 and are sufficiently wettable without the addition of hydrophilic surfactant.   Other immobilizing agents<br>
such as the C16 - C18 fatty alcohols having HLB values below about 7 will require addition of hydrophilic surfactant to improve wettability when the lotion composition is applied to diaper topsheets. Similarly, a hydrophobic emollient such as petrolatum will require the addition of a hydrophilic surfactant.<br>
Suitable hydrophilic surfactants will be miscible with the emollient and the immobilizing agent so as to form homogeneous mixtures. Because of possible skin sensitivity of those using disposable absorbent products to which the lotion composition is applied, these surfactants should also be relatively mild and non-irritating to the skin. Typically, these hydrophilic surfactants are nonionic to be not only non-irritating to the skin, but also to avoid other undesirable effects on any underlying tissue laminate structure, e.g., reductions in tensile strength.<br>
Suitable nonionic surfactants may be substantially nonmigratory after the lotion composition is applied to the diaper topsheets and will typically have HLB values in the range of from about 4 to about 20, preferably from about 7 to about 20. To be nonmigratory, these nonionic surfactants will typically have melt temperatures greater than the temperatures commonly encountered during storage, shipping, merchandising, and use of disposable absorbent products, e.g., at least about 30째C In this regard, these nonionic surfactants will preferably have melting points similar to those of the immobilizing agents previously described.<br>
Suitable nonionic surfactants for use in lotion compositions of the present invention include alkylglycosides; alkylglycoside ethers as described in U.S. patent 4,011,389 (Langdon, et al), issued March 8, 1977; alkylpolyethoxylated esters such as Pegosperse 1000MS (available from Lonza, Inc., Fair Lawn, New Jersey), ethoxylated sorbitan mono-, di- and/or tri-esters of C12-C18 fatty acids having an  average degree of ethoxylation of from about 2 to about 20, preferably from about 2 to about 10, such as TWEEN 60 (sorbitan esters of stearic acid having an average degree of ethoxylation of about 20) and TWEEN 61 (sorbitan esters of stearic acid having an average degree of ethoxylation of about 4), and the condensation products of aliphatic alcohols with from about 1 to about 54 moles of ethylene oxide. The alkyl chain of the aliphatic alcohol is typically in a straight chain (linear) configuration and contains from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms.    Particularly preferred are the condensation products of<br>
alcohols having an alkyl group containing from about 11 to about 22 carbon atoms with from about 2 to about 30 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Examples of such ethoxylated alcohols include the condensation products of myristyl alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, the condensation products of coconut alcohol (a mixture of fatty alcohols having alkyl chains varying in length from 10 to 14 carbon atoms) with about 6 moles of ethylene oxide. A number of suitable ethoxylated alcohols are commercially available, including TERGITOL 15-S-9 (the condensation product of C11-C15 linear alcohols with 9 moles of ethylene oxide), marketed by Union Carbide Corporation; KYRO EOB (condensation product of C13-C15 linear alcohols with 9 moles of ethylene oxide), marketed by The Procter &amp; Gamble Co., the NEODOL brand name surfactants marketed by Shell Chemical Co., in particular NEODOL 25-12 (condensation product of C12-C15 linear alcohols with 12 moles of ethylene oxide) and NEODOL 23-6.5T (condensation product of C12-C13 linear alcohols with 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide that has been distilled (topped) to remove certain impurities), and especially the PLURAFAC brand name surfactants marketed by BASF Corp., in particular PLURAFAC A-38 (a condensation product of a C18 straight chain alcohol with 27 moles of ethylene oxide). (Certain of the hydrophilic surfactants, in particular ethoxylated alcohols such as NEODOL 25-12, can also function as alkyl ethoxylate emollients). Other examples of preferred ethoxylated alcohol surfactants include ICI's class of Brij surfactants and mixtures thereof, with Brij 72 (i.e., Steareth-2) and Brij 76 ( i.e., Steareth-10) being especially preferred. Also, mixtures of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol ethoxylated to an average degree of ethoxylation of from about 10 to about 20 may also be used as the hydrophilic surfactant.<br>
Another type of suitable surfactant for use in the present invention includes"Aerosol OT, a dioctyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid marketed by American Cyanamid Company.<br>
Still another type of suitable surfactant for use in the present invention includes silicone copolymers such as General Electric SF 1188 (a copolymer of a polydimethylsiloxane and a polyoxyalkylene ether) and General Electric SF 1228 (a silicone polyether copolymer). These silicone surfactants can be used in combination with the other types of hydrophilic surfactants discussed above, such as the ethoxylated alcohols.    These<br>
silicone surfactants have been found to be effective at concentrations as low as 0.1%, more preferably from about 0.25 to about 1.0%, by weight of the lotion composition.<br>
The amount of hydrophilic surfactant required to increase the wettability of the lotion composition to a desired level will depend upon the HLB value and level of immobilizing agent used, the HLB value of the surfactant used and like factors. The lotion composition can comprise from about 1 to about 50% of the hydrophilic surfactant when needed to increase the wettability properties of the composition. Preferably, the lotion composition comprises from about 1 to about 25%, most preferably from about 10 to about 20%, of the hydrophilic surfactant when needed to increase wettability.<br>
4.   Other Optional Components<br>
Lotion compositions can comprise other optional components typically present in emollient, creams, and lotions of this type. These optional components include water pH reducing or buffering systems, vitamins, skin soothing agents or anti-inflammatories, viscosity modifiers, perfumes, disinfectant antibacterial actives, pharmaceutical actives, film formers, deodorants, opacifiers, astringents, solvents and the like. In addition, stabilizers or antioxidants can be added to enhance the shelf life of the lotion composition such as cellulose derivatives, proteins and lecithin. Suitable pH buffering systems include citric acid salts. Suitable vitamins include vitamins A and E. Suitable skin soothing agents or antiinflammatories include aloe vera and panthenol. All of these materials are well known in the art as additives for such formulations and can be employed in appropriate amounts in the lotion compositions of the present invention.<br>
C.    Treating Diaper Topsheets With Lotion Composition<br>
In preparing lotioned diaper products according to the present invention, the lotion composition is applied to the outer surface (i.e., body facing surface) of a diaper topsheet. Any of a variety of application methods that evenly distribute lubricious materials having a molten or liquid consistency can be used. Suitable methods include spraying, printing (e.g.,<br>
flexographic printing), coating (e.g., gravure coating), extrusion, or combinations of these application techniques, e.g. spraying the lotion composition on a rotating surface, such as a calender roll, that then transfers the composition to the outer surface of the diaper topsheet.<br>
The manner of applying the lotion composition to the diaper topsheet should be such that the topsheet does not become saturated with the lotion composition. If the topsheet becomes saturated with the lotion composition, there is a greater potential for the lotion to block the topsheet openings, reducing the ability of the topsheet to transmit fluid to the underlying absorbent core. Also, saturation of the topsheet is not required to obtain the therapeutic and/or protective lotion benefits. Particularly suitable application methods will apply the lotion composition primarily to the outer surface of the diaper topsheet.<br>
The minimum level of lotion to be applied to the diaper topsheets is an amount effective for reducing the adherence of BM to the skin of the wearer. The lotion composition is preferably applied to the diaper topsheets of the present invention in an amount ranging from about 0.1 mg/in^ to about 25 mg/in^ more preferably from about 1 mg/in2 to about 10 mg/in2 (mg of lotion per square inch of coated topsheet). Because the emollient is substantially immobilized on the surface of the topsheet, less lotion composition is needed to impart the desired skin care benefits. Such relatively low levels of lotion composition are adequate to impart the desired therapeutic and/or protective lotion benefits to the topsheet, yet do not saturate the topsheet's absorbency and/or wettability properties.<br>
The lotion composition may be applied to the entire surface of the topsheet or portions thereof. Preferably, the lotion composition is applied in a stripe aligned with and centered on the longitudinal centerline of the disposable absorbent article. Most preferably, as described in the Examples hereinafter, the lotion composition is applied to a discrete version of the topsheet, e.g., a 3.75 inch wide (diaper lateral direction) and 7 inch long (diaper longitudinal direction) patch generally disposed toward the second waist region.<br>
The lotion composition can also be applied nonuniformly to the outer surface of the diaper topsheet. By "nonuniform" is meant that the amount, pattern of distribution, etc. of the lotion composition can vary over the topsheet surface.   For example, some portions of the treated surface of the<br>
topsheet can have greater or lesser amounts of lotion composition, including portions of the surface that do not have any lotion composition on it<br>
The lotion composition can be applied to the topsheet at any point during assembly. For example, the lotion composition can be applied to the topsheet of the finished disposable absorbent product before it has been packaged. The lotion composition can also be applied to the topsheet before it is combined with the other raw materials to form a finished disposable absorbent product.<br>
The lotion composition is typically applied from a melt thereof to the diaper topsheet. Since the lotion composition melts at significantly above ambient temperatures, it is usually applied as a heated coating to the topsheet. Typically, the lotion composition is heated to a temperature in the range from about 35째 to about 100째C, preferably from 40째 to about 90째C, prior to being applied to the diaper topsheet. Once the melted lotion composition has been applied to the diaper topsheet, it is allowed to cool and solidify to form solidified coating or film on the surface of the topsheet. Preferably, the application process is designed to aid in the cooling/set up of the lotion.<br>
In applying lotion compositions of the present invention to diaper topsheets, spraying, gravure coating and extrusion coating methods are preferred. Figure 1 illustrates one such preferred method involving spraying of the coating on the diaper topsheet before the topsheet is assembled with the other raw materials into a finished product. Referring to Figure 1, a nonwoven topsheet web 1 is unwound from parent topsheet roll 2 (rotating in the direction indicated by arrow 2a) and advanced to spray station 6 where one side of the web is sprayed with a hot, molten (e.g., 65째C) totion composition. After leaving spray station 6, nonwoven topsheet web 1 becomes a lotioned topsheet web indicated by 3. Lotioned topsheet web 3 is then advanced around turning roll 4 and turning roll 8, and then wound up on lotioned topsheet parent roll 10 (rotating in the direction indicated by arrow 10a).<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an alternative preferred method involving continuous or intermittent spraying of the lotion composition on to a diaper topsheet during the converting operation. Referring to Figure 2, conveyor belt 1 advances in the direction shown by the arrows on turning rolls 3 and 4 and becomes returning conveyor belt 2.     Conveyor belt 1  carries<br>
nonlotioned diaper 5 to spray station 6 where topsheet patch 7 is sprayed with a hot, molten (e.g., 65째C) lotion composition. After leaving spray station 6, nonlotioned diaper 5 becomes lotioned diaper 8 having a lotioned topsheet. The amount of lotion composition transferred to topsheet patch 7 is controlled by: (1) the rate at which the molten lotion composition is sprayed from spray station 6; and/or (2) the speed at which conveyor belt 1 travels under spray station 6.<br>
While  the   hereinbefore   described   embodiments   are	preferred<br>
embodiments  of the  present  invention,  variations  of these	preferred<br>
embodiments are also possible. A few of these alternate	preferred<br>
embodiments are discussed below.<br>
For example, embodiments are envisioned wherein the lotion composition comprises only a liquid or only a solid polyol polyester. In the case of solid polyol polyesters, emolliency may be provided by the solid polyol polyester itself.<br>
In other alternate embodiments, the lotion composition may be applied to the inner surface of the diaper topsheet and/or to a layer disposed underneath the topsheet (e.g., a tissue). In these cases, the wearer's body temperature plus pressure and friction from the wearer's weight and motion contribute to some portion of the lotion transferring through the topsheet and onto the wearer's skin.<br>
In still other embodiments, the lotion may be applied to any part of the diaper wherein it can come in contact with the wearer's skin. For example, leg cuffs are areas the lotion compositions of the present invention can be applied (e.g., elasticized inner, standing cuffs or elasticized outer gasketing cuffs as hereinbefore described in a disposable diaper product).<br>
The lotion compositions described herein may also be employed separately as skin care compositions such as protective hand creams and lotions due to their efficacy in protecting and softening the skin.<br>
All of the above-described embodiments are expressly intended to be included in the scope of the present invention. It should also be apparent to one skilled in the art, that other various changes can be made to these embodiments wihtout departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
