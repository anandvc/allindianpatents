Furthermore, terms used herein should be defined in consideration of functions of components of the present invention and thus can be changed according to the custom or intention of users or operators. Therefore, definition of such terms should be determined according to overall disclosures set forth herein.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 to 6, the control button 10 of the drum type washing machine comprises a button securing part 20, a button operating part 30, an elastic member 40, and a button adjusting part 50.<br>
The button securing part 20 is to be coupled to a rotary switch 60 disposed on a printed circuit board 80, and generally comprises a securing body 21, a securing portion 22 and a coupling hole 26.<br>
8<br><br>
The securing body 21 has a circular shape, and fitting hole 21A is formed at the center thereof. The securing portion 22 extends from one side of the securing body 21 and has a rack 23 formed on an outer surface of the securing portion 22.<br>
The securing portion 22 has a plurality of securing hooks 25 formed on an outer peripheral surface of one end of the securing portion 22, and, the rack 23 is engaged with a pinion 38 described below and serves to reduce the speed of the control button 10 when the control button 10 is inserted into or protruded from a control panel 90.<br>
The coupling hole 26 is in communication with the fitting hole 21 A inside the securing portion 22 and is coupled to the rotary switch 60.<br>
The button operating part 30 is to be coupled to one side of the button securing part 20, and comprises an operating portion 31, a guide member 32 and an operating body 39.<br>
The operating portion 31 has an operating trough 31A formed therein, and a pinion 38 mounted within the operating trough 31A so as to be engaged with the rack 23, whereby the securing portion 22 of the button securing part 20 is coupled to the operating portion 31. Further, the operating portion 31 is open at one end thereof. Specifically, the open end of the operating portion 31 faces the button securing part 20.<br>
The guide member 32 is formed along one side of the operating portion 31, and the operating body 39 is integral to one end of the guide member 32, and to an end of the operating portion 31 that is opposed to the open end.<br>
Latch hooks 3 IB corresponding to the securing hooks 25 are formed on an inner peripheral surface at an inlet side of the operating trough 31A of the operating portion 31. The latch hooks 3 IB cooperatively engage the securing hooks 25 to prevent separation of the button operating part 30 from the button securing part 20.<br>
Specifically, the guide member 32 generally comprises a guide protruding piece 33, a guide-piece controlling protrusion 35, a secondary guide-piece controlling protrusion 35A, and a guide piece 37. The guide piece 37 is an elongate, generally U-shaped member having a fixed end 37 A and a movable end 37B.<br>
9<br><br>
The guide protruding piece 33 extends integrally on one side of an outer peripheral surface of the operating portion 31 in the longitudinal direction and has a guide-piece guiding portion 34 defined therein.<br>
The guide-piece controlling protrusion 35 is formed on the guide-piece guiding portion 34 to divide the guide-piece guiding portion 34 to a first guide section 34A and a second guide section 34B. Here, the first guide section 34A indicates a first side (for example, the right side) of the guide-piece guiding portion 34 (see Fig. 5) and constitutes a passage along which the control button 10 moves when being inserted into the control panel 90. The second guide section 34B indicates a second side (for example, the left side) of the guide-piece guiding portion 34 and constitutes a passage along which the control button 10 moves when being extended from within the control panel 90.<br>
Since the guide-piece controlling protrusion 35 has a leading corner located at one side (for example, a left side) of an imaginary straight line extending along a longitudinal axis of the guide piece 37, the movable end 37B of the guide piece 37 is guided toward the first guide section 34A by the leading corner of the guide-piece controlling protrusion 35 when the button adjusting part 50 is inserted into the control panel 90.<br>
Further, the guide-piece controlling protrusion 35 is formed with a V-shaped guide groove 36 that faces the operating body 39 and is divided into a first slope 36A and a second slope 36B. Here, the first slope 36A indicates a right side of the guide groove 36 (see Fig. 5). The second slope 36B indicates a left side of the guide groove 36. When guided to the first guide section 34A, the movable end 37B is guided along the first slope 36A and seated on the guide groove 36, thereby completing insertion of control button 10 into the control panel 90.<br>
Here, the first slope 36A of the guide groove 36 is longer than the second slope 36B to allow the movable end 37B of the guide piece 37 located on the guide groove 36 to be easily released from the guide groove 36 to permit operation of the button operating part 30 when using the washing machine.<br>
The secondary guide-piece controlling protrusion 35A is formed on one side of the operating portion 31 contacting the operating body 39 and faces the guide groove 36 to<br>
10<br><br>
allow the movable end 37B to be easily released from the guide groove 36. In this embodiment, the secondary guide-piece controlling protrusion 35A has a triangular shape, in which, assuming one side contacting the one side of the operating portion 31 is a base, another side perpendicular to the base is a height side, and the third side is a hypotenuse, a corner where the height side meets the hypotenuse is formed at a location biased to the first slope 36A side from an imaginary straight line extending from the center of the guide groove 36. With this configuration, when the button adjusting part 50 is pressed, the movable end 37B is moved from the guide groove 36 to the secondary guide-piece controlling protrusion 35A, slides along the hypotenuse of the secondary guide-piece controlling protrusion 35A to the second guide section 34B, and is then finally released.<br>
The fixed end 37 A of the guide piece 37 is secured to the button securing part 20 such that the movable end 37B can control the operation of the button operating part 30 while moving along the guide-piece guiding portion 34, the first guide section 34A, the second guide section 34B, and the like.<br>
The elastic member 40 has one end mounted between the operating body 39 and the operating portion 31, and the other end mounted on the securing body 21 of the button securing part 20. As the button operating part 30 is moved toward the button securing part 20 after insertion of the control button 10, the elastic member 40 becomes compressed. When the movable end 37B of the guide piece 37 is released from the guide groove 36 by pressing the button adjusting part 50, the button operating part 30 is moved in a direction where restoration of the compressed elastic member 40 occurs, thereby allowing the control button 10 to extend outward relative to the control panel 90.<br>
The button adjusting part 50 is provided to the control panel 90, and has a cylindrical shape, of which one end 52 is closed and the other end 56 is open. The operating body 39 of the button operating part 30 is press-fitted into the open end 56 of the button adjusting portion 50. The annular wall portion 54 of the button adjusting part 50 resides within an inserting hole 92 formed in the control panel 90 such that the closed end 52 is substantially flush with a surface of the control panel 90 when the control button 10 is<br>
11<br><br>
in the retracted position, and the closed end 52 is positioned outwardly of the surface of the control panel 90 (Fig. 4) when the control button 10 is in the extended position.<br>
The button securing part 20, button operating part 30 and button adjusting part 50 are made from a metallic material or a synthetic resin<br>
Next, an operating principle of the control button of the drum type washing machine according to one embodiment of the invention is described with reference to Figs. 4 to 6.<br>
The control button 10 of the drum type washing machine is coupled to the rotary switch 60 disposed on the printed circuit board 80 through the inserting hole 92 of the control panel 90. Then, when a user rotates the control button 10 toward a mark indicating a certain washing cycle among various washing cycles, the rotary switch 60 will be rotated by the rotation of the control button 10. The rotary switch 60 is provided for selectively inputting one of the various washing cycles, such as a standard cycle, wool/lingerie cycles, etc., to the printed circuit board 80, and enables the washing machine to perform the washing cycle selected by the user.<br>
Next, principles of insertion and protrusion of the control button are described.<br>
When the inserted button adjusting part 50 of the control button 10 is pressed, the button operating part 30 is moved inward by the compressive force to the button adjusting part 50. Then, the movable end 37B of the guide piece 37 located in the guide groove 36 is moved to the secondary guide-piece controlling protrusion 35A, and is guided to the second guide section 34B along the hypotenuse of the secondary guide-piece controlling protrusion 35A.<br>
When the movable end 37B is released from the guide groove 36, the elastic member 40, which has been compressed between the button operating part 30 and the button securing part 20, is restored to its original state, and the button operating part 30 moves away from the button securing part 20. At this time, the movable end 37B is located at the other end of the guide protruding piece 33 after being moved along the second guide section 34B and the guide-piece guiding portion 34, and the button adjusting part 50 protrudes from the control panel 90 (see Fig. 5).<br>
12<br><br>
The button operating part 30 spaced from the button securing part 20 is not completely separated from button securing part 20 since the latch hooks 3 IB of the button operating part 30 are latched to the securing hooks 25 of the button securing part 20.<br>
In this state, the user operates the washing machine to perform a selected washing cycle by rotating the control button 10 toward the selected washing cycle.<br>
Further, after using the control button 10, the user pushes the control button 10 again to make the button adjusting part 50 retract into the control panel 90.<br>
Specifically, when pushing the button adjusting part 50 of the control button 10 while it is protruding from the control panel 90, the button operating part 30 is moved toward the button securing part 20 by the compressive pushing force applied to the button adjusting part 50. Here, since the leading corner of the guide-piece controlling protrusion 35 is biased to a left side, the movable end 37B of the guide piece 37 is moved to the first guide section 34A from the guide-piece guiding portion 34. In this state, when further pressing the button adjusting part 50, the movable end 37B is guided to the first slope 36 A of the guide groove 36 after moving along the first guide section 34A, and when the button adjusting part 50 is released, the movable end 37B is located and stopped at the center of the guide groove 36. That is, movable end 37B is located and stopped between the first slope 36A and the second slope 36B by the restoration force of the elastic member 40, after moving along the first slope 36A of the guide-piece controlling protrusion 35.<br>
As a result, the separation between the button securing part 20 and the button operating part 30 is narrowed, and the button adjusting part 50 is retracted into the control panel 90 through the inserting hole 92 of the control panel 90, so that the button adjusting part 50 does not protrude from the control panel 90 (see Fig. 6).<br>
Further, the configurations of the rack 23 formed on the button securing part 20 and the pinion 38 formed on the button operating part 30 corresponding to the rack 23 enable retraction and extension of the control button 10 with respect to the control panel to be performed more smoothly. With cooperation of the rack 23 and the pinion 38, it is possible to prevent reduction in coupling force between the button coupling part 20 and<br>
