				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to processes for preparing organic<br>
pigment dispersions, including pigment flushes, and pigmented compositions<br>
such as ink compositions. The present invention also relates to methods for<br>
preparing ink bases and finished ink compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Syntheses of many organic pigments include a coupling step in<br>
a dilute aqueous medium to produce a slurry of the pigment product, which is<br>
typically followed by a step of filtering the slurry in a filter press to concentrate<br>
the pigment. The press cake that results is then either dried to provide a dry,<br>
particulate pigment or else is "flushed" with an organic medium such as an oil or<br>
resin to transfer the pigment particles from the aqueous press cake to the oil or<br>
resin phase. The flushing process requires additional time and materials over<br>
simply drying the pigment. If the pigment is used in an ink or coating<br>
composition, however, it must first be well-dispersed in an appropriate organic<br>
medium in order to achieve the desired color development and stability, and thus<br>
the flushing process is advantageous because it accomplishes the transfer<br>
without intermediate steps of drying the pigment and grinding the pigment in the<br>
organic medium to produce the pigment dispersion.<br>
[0003] In the past, pigment flushes have usually been prepared by<br>
batch processes in which the press cake is kneaded with an organic phase such<br>
as an oil or a resin, for example in a sigma blade mixer or dough mixer, to flush<br>
the pigment particles from the water phase to the organic medium phase and<br>
displace the water as a separate aqueous phase. The displaced water is<br>
decanted and the dispersion of the pigment in the varnish can be used as a<br>
pigment paste in preparing an ink or paint.<br>
[0004] The batch process has many shortcomings. The steps of<br>
adding varnish, kneading the dough to displace the water, and pouring off the<br>
water must usually be repeated a number of times in order to obtain the<br>
maximum yield from the flusher. This is a labor-intensive process that requires<br>
careful monitoring. Further, in order to remove the residual water, the batch<br>
must be heated and stripped under vacuum. For many pigments, the heat<br>
history from processing to remove the residual water results in a color shift.<br>
Because the precise heat history may vary from batch to batch, it is difficult to<br>
reliably and accurately reproduce the same color from batch to batch. One of<br>
the most significant shortcomings of the batch process is the lot to lot<br>
fluctuations of the pigment and the solids content of the presscake. Further, the<br>
process is time-consuming and inefficient. It is difficult to reduce the water<br>
content below about 3% by weight, even with the vacuum stripping. Finally, the<br>
pigment content of presscake, and therefore of the flush can vary.<br>
[0005] Continuous processes for preparing pigment flushes using<br>
presscake have been proposed. In particular, the processes described in U.S.<br>
Patents No. 6,273,599, 6,305,838, and 6,348,091, each of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference, have been highly successful in resolving some of the<br>
shortcomings associatdd with batch flushing processes. U.S. Patent 5,262,268<br>
describes using presscake to produce a toner in a twin-screw extruder.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] The present invention provides a process for continuous<br>
production of organic pigment dispersion, such as pigment flush, or an ink<br>
product in which a pigment is introduced into a twin screw extruder as a stable,<br>
aqueous pigment dispersion, which can resolve the issue of lot to lot<br>
pigment/color and solids variations of presscake. A stable dispersion is one that<br>
has a usefully long shelf life without settling or becoming unpumpable. The<br>
stable pigment dispersion can be destabilized with a destabilizing agent.<br>
[0007] in one embodiment of the invention, the stable pigment<br>
dispersion is fed at a desired rate into the extruder along with a destabilizing<br>
agent that precipitates the dispersed pigment. An organic medium, which may<br>
include organic components selected from solvent, vamish, oil, polymer,<br>
dispersant, and/or resin, is also fed into the extruder. The destabilized or<br>
precipitated pigment and organic medium are mixed in a first zone of the<br>
extruder to wet the pigment with the organic medium, displacing water from the<br>
pigment and producing an organic pigment dispersion, such as a crude pigment<br>
flush. At least a portion of the displaced water is removed in a second zone of<br>
the extruder. The second zone of the extruder includes a port for removing the<br>
displaced water, especially by draining the water, and preferably includes a dam<br>
that retains the organic pigment dispersion or pigment flush in the second zone<br>
for a time sufficient to allow most of the displaced water to be removed from the<br>
crude flush mass. A third zone has additional ports for adding rinsing water,<br>
particularly to remove salts or other by-products of the pigment destabilization or<br>
precipitation, and for draining the removing the rinsing water. The extruder may<br>
include a fourth zone that has one or more vacuum ports to draw off residual<br>
water clinging to the organic pigment dispersion or pigment flush. The extruder<br>
may have additional zones for introducing further materials for making a final<br>
pigment dispersion or ink product, such as resins, oils, solvents, dispersants,<br>
waxes, surfactants, and pigment or ink additives.<br>
[0008] In a second embodiment, the invention also provides a method<br>
for continuous production of an ink base or a finished ink from a stable, aqueous<br>
pigment dispersion. The method includes the steps just outlined for the process<br>
of the invention for producing a pigment flush and at least one an additional step<br>
of introducing into the extruder, at some point before the discharge outlet,<br>
preferably after the optional vacuum zone, one or more additional ink<br>
components, such as a varnish, pigmented tinting or toning compositions,<br>
solvent, and/or additives, to make an ink base or a finished ink composition.<br>
[0009] In one embodiment, the stable, aqueous pigment dispersion<br>
has a pigment content of at least about 25% by weight.<br>
[0010] In another embodiment, the stable, aqueous pigment dispersion<br>
is stabilized by an ionic dispersant, and the destabilizing agent is an ionic agent.<br>
In one embodiment, the dispersant may have carboxylic acid groups that are<br>
salted to stabilize the aqueous dispersion, and that are destabilized with a protic<br>
or Lewis acid.<br>
[0011] In one embodiment of the first zone, the stable pigment<br>
dispersion and destabilizing agent are introduced into the extruder at a first point<br>
-Aor<br>
barrel. The stable pigment dispersion and destabilizing agent are mixed in the<br>
extruder to produce an aqueous destabilized pigment material The organic<br>
medium is introduced into the extruder at a second point or downstream barrel of<br>
the first zone and mixed with the destabilized pigment material to produce an<br>
organic pigment dispersion phase and a water phase.<br>
[0012] In a second embodiment of the first zone, the stable pigment<br>
dispersion, destabilizing agent, and organic medium are all introduced into a first<br>
barrel of the extruder.<br>
[0013] In one embodiment of the process, the aqueous, stable,<br>
pigment dispersion is substantially destabilized with the destabilizing agent<br>
before the organic medium is introduced into the extruder. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, the organic dispersion is introduced into the extruder before the<br>
aqueous, stable pigment dispersion is substantially destabilized in the extruder.<br>
[0014] In certain embodiments of the invention, a toner product is<br>
made by using as the organic medium a toner vehicle, typically a solid polymer<br>
or resin with a low melting point.<br>
[0015] In certain embodiments of the invention, a masterbatch is made<br>
by using as the organic medium a polymer such as polyethylene homopolymers<br>
and copolymers, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer, polybutene,<br>
polystyrene, polyphenylene oxide, polycarbonate, polypropylene, and the like<br>
optionally with a resin of low melt viscosity such as a hydrocarbon, terpene, or<br>
rosin material.<br>
[0016] "A" and "an" as used herein indicate "at least one" of the item is<br>
present; a plurality of such items may be present, when possible. "About" when<br>
applied to values indicates that the calculation or the measurement allows some<br>

imprecision provided by "about" Is not otherwise understood in the art with this<br>
ordinary meaning, then "about" as used herein indicates a possible variation of<br>
up to 5% in the value.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0017] FIGURE 11s a schematic diagram of one extruder configuration<br>
for carrying out an embodiment of the inventive process; and<br>
[0018] FIGURE 2 is a schematic diagram of an alternative<br>
configuration for the first four barrels of the extruder of FIGURE 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019] The following description of the preferred embodiments) is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to Itmft the invention, its<br>
application, or uses.<br>
[0020] The inventive method for continuous production of organic<br>
pigment dispersions, pigment flush, or an ink product or other pigmented product<br>
employs a stable, water-borne pigment dispersion that is introduced into a twin<br>
screw extruder and destabilized in the extruder. The destabilized or precipitated<br>
pigment is mixed or flushed with an organic medium. The separate water phase<br>
may then be removed from the organic pigment dispersion phase.<br>
[0021] One example of a preferred extruder configuration has at least<br>
four zones, and optionally has a fifth zone or further zones, in a first zone,<br>
represented in the FIGURE 1 by barrels 1 through 3, the stable, aqueous<br>
pigment dispersion, organic medium, and destabilizing agent are fed into the<br>
extruder (barrel 1) and then mixed to destabilize or precipitate the pigment and<br>
flush or remove the pigment from the aqueous phase to the organic phase<br>
(barrels 2 and 3). The destabilizing agent is fed in separately from, and<br>
preferably after, the pigment dispersion. In a second zone, represented by<br>
barrels 4 and 5, at least a portion of the water displaced during the flushing stage<br>
in the first zone is removed by draining or drawing the liquid from the extruder.<br>
In a third zone, represented by the end of barrel 5 and barrels 6, 7A, 8, and 7,<br>
rinse water may be Introduced to rinse any impurity, such as a salt precipitated<br>
by interaction of the destabilizing agent and a salted dispersant resin of the<br>
aqueous pigment dispersion, from the organic pigment dispersion or pigment<br>
flush mixture, the rinse water being removed by draining or drawing the liquid<br>
from the extruder through a port. In a fourth zone, represented by sections 9<br>
through 11, residual water may be removed (as water vapor) by vacuum<br>
dehydrating the organic pigment dispersion or pigment flush through vacuum<br>
ports. The fourth zone may also have ports for introducing additives, resins, and<br>
so as desired for the organic pigment dispersion, flush product, or ink or other<br>
plgmented product. In a fifth, optional zone, represented by sections 12 through<br>
14, the organic pigment dispersion or flush is further mixed and other<br>
components may be added to the pigment dispersion or flush, as in the fourth<br>
zone. Further ports may be used to introduce Ink components or other desired<br>
materials in the fourth zone and/or optional fifth zone to produce an ink base,<br>
finished ink composition, or other pigment product. Each zone may be heat or<br>
cooled to a desired temperature for optimum mixing and preservation of the<br>
pigment color properties. The product may be cooled before discharging.<br>
[0022] FIGURE 2 illustrates an alternative example of a first zone of<br>
the extruder of FIGURE 1. In the alternative embodiment, the stable, aqueous<br>
pigment dispersion and destabilizing agent are introduced and mixed in barrel 1.<br>
Organic medium, shown in FIGURE 2 as polymer and dispersant, is introduced<br>
in barrel 2. The pigment is destabilized or precipitated in barrel 1, and may form<br>
a thick, presscake-like material. The destabilized pigment is then mixed with<br>
organic medium in barrels 2 and 3 to incorporate the pigment into the organic<br>
medium, forming an organic pigment dispersion and displacing a water phase.<br>
Processing of the organic pigment dispersion continues through the second,<br>
third, optional fourth, and optional fifth zones as before.<br>
[0023] In a first step of a first-embodiment of the method, a stable,<br>
water-based pigment dispersion, organic medium, and destabilizing agent are<br>
introduced into a first zone of the extruder. A stable, water-based pigment<br>
dispersion may be prepared in any of a number of known methods. The pigment<br>
used to make the stable, water-borne pigment dispersion may be, for example,<br>
in the form of an aqueous slurry, a presscake, a dry crude pigment or activated<br>
crude pigment, or a dry pigment. The pigment is stabilized in the aqueous<br>
dispersion with a polymeric, oiigomeric, and/or monomeric dispersant or<br>
combination of dispersants. The dispersant(s), base for salting the<br>
dispersant(s), and water (as needed) are combined with the pigment to form a<br>
stable, water-borne pigment dispersion of a desired pigment content.<br>
[0024] Any of a number of organic pigments may be used to form the<br>
stable dispersion. Suitable examples include, without limitation, azo pigments<br>
such as lithol reds (e.g., calcium lithol red, barium Irthol red), rubine reds, and<br>
naphtho! reds, oranges, and browns; monoarylide and diarylide pigments such<br>
as diarylide yellow, phthalocyanine blue and green pigments, azomethine<br>
pigments, methine pigments, anthraquinone pigments, perinone pigments,<br>
peryiene pigments, diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments, thioindigo pigments,<br>
iminoisoindoline pigments, iminoisoindoiinone pigments, quinacridone pigments<br>
such as quinacridone reds and violets, flavanthrone pigments, indanthrone<br>
pigments, anthrapyrimidine pigments, carbazole pigments such as carbazole<br>
violet, benzimidazolone yellows, tolyi orange, naphthol orange, and<br>
quinophthalone pigments, and so on.<br>
[0025] Examples of useful ionic dispersants that may be used in<br>
producing the stable, aqueous pigment dispersions include, without limitation,<br>
fatty acids (e.g., lauroyi acid, tall oil fatty acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic<br>
acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, and oleic acid); alkyibenzenesulfonates; alkyl<br>
sulfates such as dioctylsutfosuccinat.es; ionic resins such as alkyd resins,<br>
polyesters, rosins and modified rosins such as unsaturated acid- (e.g., maleio,<br>
fumaric-, acrylic-, methacryllc-, crotonic-) modified rosins, dimerized rosins,<br>
disproportionated rosins, hydrogenated rosins, phenolic-modified rosins, other<br>
maleic- or fumariomodified polymers, acid-functional vinyl resins including acidfunctional<br>
acrylic polymers, phenolic-acrylic polymers, and styrene-maleic<br>
anhydride (SMA) copoiymers, low molecular weight, acid-functional<br>
potyurethanes, and other stabilizing materials used or useful for preparing<br>
dispersions that are pH sensitive or that may be destabilized in the extruder by<br>
another material. The dispersants may be used in any stable combination. The<br>
ionic resins are salted with a suitable counterion to provide water solubility or<br>
dispersibiiity. Acid-functional dispersants may be salted with bases, e.g., sodium<br>
hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and mono- and dialkyl<br>
amines. The water-based dispersions may also include other additives useful<br>
for making organic pigment compositions or flush color such as oils (vegetable<br>
and petroleum), anttoxidants, defoamers, surfactants, so-called pigment or<br>
hyper-pigment dispersants, and non-dispersant resins.<br>
[0026] The stable, water-based pigment dispersions are preferably at<br>
least about 25% by weight pigment, more preferably at least about 35% by<br>
weight pigment. The pigment content of the stable dispersion depends on both<br>
the pigment and dispersant selected, and may exceed 50% by weight, or even<br>
60% by weight, and still be water-thin. The organic pigment dispersions typically<br>
have a pigment content by weight of from about 25% to about 50% by weight.<br>
TJ.e stable, water-based pigment dispersions may contain from 6 to about 40<br>
parts by weight of ionic dispersant per 100 parts by weight of pigment.<br>
[0027] The stable, water-based pigment dispersion may be prepared<br>
as an extension of tho pigment synthesis, by treatment of a pigment slurry, or by<br>
post-dispersion of s presscake or dry pigment, e.g. in high-speed dispersers,<br>
rotor-stators, basket mills, or pigment grinding mills.<br>
[0028] The organic medium into which the pigment is to be dispersed<br>
or flushed is sufficiently hydrophobic to allow a non-aqueous phase to form in the<br>
process. Types of organic materials that are suitable to prepare pigment flushes<br>
are well-known in the art. The organic medium may be fed through the same<br>
port as the stable, water-borne pigment dispersion, but it is r. ^ferabfy fed into<br>
the extruder through a separate port.<br>
[0029] Typical lands of resins and oils that may be used for flushing<br>
varnishes include, without limitation, alkyd resins, phenolic resins, polyesters,<br>
hydrocarbon resins, maleic resins, rosin-modified varnishes of any of these,<br>
polyamide resins, polyvinyl chloride resins, vinyl acetate resins, vinyl<br>
chloride/vinyl acetate copolymer resins, chlorinated polyolefins, polystyrene<br>
resins, acrylic resins, polyurethane resins, ketone resins, vegetable oils including<br>
linseed oil, soybean oil, neatsfoot oil, coconut oil, tung oil, mineral oils, and so<br>
on. Combinations of such resins and oils may also be employed. The resin, oil,<br>
or combination thereof may be combined with a hydrophobic organic solvent or<br>
liquid, including high boiling petroleum distillates.<br>
[0030] Typical kinds of organic materials that may be used to form<br>
organic pigment dispersions for toners include but are not limited to polyamides,<br>
epoxies, diolefins, potyurethanes, vinyl resins and polymeric esterification<br>
products of a dicarboxylic acid and a diol comprising a diphenol. Among suitable<br>
vinyl resins are those having as monomeric units styrene, p-chlorostyrene, vinyl<br>
naphthalene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, and isobutylene, vinyl chloride, vinyl<br>
bromide, vinyl fluoride, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl benzoate, vinyl<br>
butyrate, methyl acrylate, dodecyl acryiate, n-octyl acrylate, 2- chloroethyl<br>
acrylate, phenyl acrylate, methylalphachloroacrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl<br>
methacryiate, butyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylimide, vinyl<br>
methyl ether, vinyl isobutyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether, vinyl methyl ketone, vinyl<br>
hexyl ketone, methyl isopropenyl ketone, vinylidene chloride, vinylidene<br>
chlorofluoride, N-vinyl indole, and N-vinyl pyrrolidone, as well as styrene<br>
butadiene copolymers,<br>
[0031] Typical kinds of organic materials that may be used to make<br>
masterbatches include, without limitation, polymers such as polyethylene<br>
homopolymers and copolymers, polypropylene homopolymers and copolymers,<br>
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer, polystyrene, polyphenylene oxide,<br>
polycarbonate, polyacrylate, and the like. These polymers may be used in<br>
conjunction with a low molecular weight resin such as a hydrocarbon resin, rosin,<br>
or terpene resin.<br>
[0032] In the first embodiment, the stable, water-based pigment<br>
dispersion is fed into a first zone of the extruder, along with the organic medium<br>
and a separate feed of a destabilizing agent. The aqueous pigment dispersion,<br>
precipitating agent, and organic medium can be added at controlled, consistent<br>
rates for production of consistent flush product For example, they may each be<br>
fed from a line or tank, which may have a stirrer, and may be metered in with, for<br>
example, a pump.<br>
[0033] Preferably, the organic medium, stable, water-borne pigment<br>
dispersion, and destabilizing agent are each introduced at fairly constant rates.<br>
The relative amounts of the organic medium and the pigment of the water-based<br>
pigment dispersion for optimum processing can be determined based upon the<br>
particular materials chosen, but in general the amounts remain the same as<br>
those expected for conventional batch flushing processes. For example, the<br>
amount of organic medium introduced per unit of time may be from about 0.6 to<br>
about 3 times the amount of solid pigment introduced in the same unit of time.<br>
The ratio of organic medium to solid pigment may be adjusted according to<br>
factors known in the art, such as the type of pigment and the type of organic<br>
medium and may be controlled by the automated process controls.<br>
[0034] The water-based pigment dispersion is destabilized, and the<br>
pigment is released or precipitated, by the addition of the destabilizing agent.<br>
The destabilizing agent is selected based on the nature of the stabilization of the<br>
pigment dispersion. For example, when the pigment dispersion is prepared<br>
using pH-sensitive dispersant, for example a salted, anionic resin, a destabilizing<br>
agent that alters the pH, for example to acidic pH, is effective. Typical kinds of<br>
destabilizing agent that may be added include protic acids and Lewis acids such<br>
as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosophoric acid, phosphonic acid, acetic<br>
acid, formic acid, and aluminum chloride. These destabilizing agents may be<br>
added in combination, and other, weaker acids (e.g., calcium chloride, strontium<br>
chloride) may be added in combination with stronger acids. The destabilizing<br>
agent is preferably chosen so that any excess destabilizing agent and any salts<br>
produced by the interaction of the destabilizing agent with the water-borne<br>
pigment dispersant can be removed by washing or by evaporation.<br>
[0035] In a second embodiment of the invention, the stable, waterbased<br>
pigment dispersion and separate feed of destabilizing agent are<br>
introduced into the extruder, mixed, and then, at a downstream point, the organic<br>
medium is added In this embodiment, the water-based pigment dispersion is<br>
first substantially destabilized with the destabilizing agent before the organic<br>
medium is added. The destabilized aqueous pigment dispersion may have a<br>
high viscosity that is advantageous for mixing with a high viscosity polymer melt,<br>
such as may be used in making a masterbateh,<br>
[0036] A twin-screw extruder used in a preferred embodiment of the<br>
method is shown in FIGURE 1. The first zone comprises screw elements for<br>
mixing the destabilized, aqueous pigment and the organic medium. The<br>
destabilized, aqueous pigment is thought to be like a high solids presscake in the<br>
extruder, and the first zone should include one or more elements for high shear<br>
mixing. Referring again to the FIGURE 1, Barrel 1 has four separate ports for<br>
introduction (in preferred order) of stable, aqueous pigment dispersion, an alkyd,<br>
a varnish, and an acidic destabilizing agent. Barrel 1 contains feed screw<br>
elements. Barrel 2 contains combined mixing or kneading screw and conveying<br>
screw elements. Barrel 3 contains combined high shearing mixing and<br>
conveying screw elements. Barrels 2 through 4 may be heated with an oil jacket<br>
held at about 60°C. The pigment mixture in barrel 2 may be about 45°C, but<br>
may reach almost 90°C due to heat generated by the flushing shear.<br>
[0037] In an alternative embodiment shown in FIGURE 2, Barrel 1 has<br>
two separate parts for introduction of stable, aqueous pigment dispersion and<br>
destabilizing agent, while Barrel 2 has two separate ports for introduction of a<br>
polymer and a dispersant. Optionally, a further barrel may be introduced before<br>
Barrel 4 for longer mixing before separation of the aqueous phase.<br>
[0038] In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the screw profile<br>
in the first zone tapers from a deep channel used in the section or sections<br>
having a feeding port gradually to a shallow channel in a later (downstream)<br>
section or section of the first zone. The length of the first zone of the extruder in<br>
which the destabilized aqueous pigment and the organic medium are mixed is<br>
sufficiently long so that the pigment is flushed completely. The rotational speed<br>
of the screw also is a factor for efficient flushing. A preferred range for rotational<br>
speed of the screw is from about 150 to about 550 rpm, and a more preferred<br>
range for rotational speed is from about 250 to about 350 rpm. Because of the<br>
high pigment concentration, the flushing zone of the extruder may be relatively<br>
short as compared to a flushing zone needed for lower aqueous pigment<br>
concentrations.<br>
[0039] The displaced water and the crude organic pigment dispersion<br>
or pigment flush continue in the extruder to a second zone of the extruder where<br>
at least a portion of the displaced water is removed. Preferably a major portion<br>
of the displaced water Is removed in the second zone, more preferably at least<br>
about 80%, still more preferably at least about 90%, and even more preferably<br>
ail but a. residual amount of water that clings to the pigment flush is removed.<br>
Referring to the FIGURE 1, barrel 4 includes an outlet for removing water<br>
displaced in the flushing zone, preferably by draining the water off. While the<br>
water may be withdrawn by other means, gravity draining is the simplest and is,<br>
therefore, preferred. The outlet or port may contain a separate length of screw<br>
turned by a motor that drives the relatively viscous pigment-containing flush back<br>
into the barrel section while letting the water drain out, as describe in <br>
Patents No. 6,273,599, 6,305,838, and 6,348,091.<br>
[0040] The second zone preferably has a dam downstream of the<br>
water drain or outlet that retains the organic pigment dispersion or pigment flush<br>
for a time sufficient to allow most of the displaced water to drain from the crude<br>
organic pigment dispersion or flush mass. The dam causes the kneaded<br>
pigment/organic medium to dwell over the port long enough to allow more of the<br>
displaced water to drain from the kneaded pigment. A portion of the mixture of<br>
pigment and organic medium is carried into the dammed section of the extruder<br>
and remains in that section until the portion works its way out of the pocket of<br>
retained material and Is carried into the next section by the grabbing action of the<br>
screw. Such dam is described in more detail in U.S. Patents No. 6,273,599,<br>
6,305,838, and 6,348,091. in brief, at least one screw element downstream of<br>
the outlet, in barrel 5 of FIGURE 1, is reverse-threaded in a tight thread to<br>
provide sufficient reverse flow to cause the material to fill the area having the<br>
outlet. The reverse flow force that causes the damming effect is limited so that<br>
there is no squeezing, as squeezing would tend to produce an emulsion of the<br>
aqueous and organic phases, impairing the desired separation of water from<br>
organic phase. The effect of the reverse flow is to cause material to accumulate<br>
before eventually flowing over the created dam and/or being pulled on by<br>
forward-turning screws located further downstream. The water is not engaged by<br>
the forward screws and does not flow over the accumulated material. Instead,<br>
the water is held in the second zone to drain. Because more of the water is<br>
drained from the flush in a liquid phase instead of being evaporated, as<br>
compared to prior methods, the final product contains a lower concentration of<br>
salts. The dam thus improves the purity of the product.<br>
[0041] It is preferred, as illustrated in FIGURE 1, to introduce rinse<br>
water into the crude flush in a third zone to rinse any water miscibie or soluble<br>
impurities, particularly any salt precipitated by interaction of the destabilizing<br>
agent and a salted dispersant resin of the aqueous pigment dispersion, from the<br>
pigment dispersion or flush mixture that may be retained in the crude dispersion<br>
or flush. The rinse water may also, of course, remove impurities that were<br>
contained in the water-based pigment dispersion; thus, the water-based pigment<br>
dispersion can have a high or low impurity or salt content that can be washed out<br>
in the extruder. Typically, the water may be added at a rate of 60 to 150% of<br>
that of the pigment addition rate to the extruder. The rinse water (preferably<br>
introduced through a port in the top of the extruder) may be mixed with the crude<br>
flush product in one or more barrels of the third zone and then be removed by<br>
draining or drawing the liquid from the extruder through a port, as in the second<br>
zone. Again, as in the second zone, it is preferred to create a dam by<br>
introducing reverse-threaded (or left-hand) screw elements downstream from the<br>
port or drain. If both a second and third zone are described, then at least the<br>
third zone should include such a dam to minimize the residual water in the<br>
organic pigment dispersion or flush product that exits the third zone, in one<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the screw profile in the third zone tapers<br>
from a deep channel used in the section or sections having a feeding port<br>
gradually to a shallow channel in a later (downstream) section or section of the<br>
third zone. The length of the third zone of the extruder in which the preflushed<br>
pigment and wash are mixed is sufficiently iong to remove undesirable water<br>
immiscible impurities from the pigment.<br>
[0042] In FIGURE 1, a third zone begins with a inlet port at the end of<br>
barrel 5 for adding rinse water. Barrels 6 and 7A contain mixing and conveying<br>
screw elements, and Barrel 8 contains mixing elements and the rinse water<br>
outlet preferably configured as the outlet described for barrel 4. One or more of<br>
the mixing elements may Include a plurality of kneading disks. Barrel 7B may<br>
contain the reverse-threaded screw element or elements. Barrels 5 through 8<br>
may be jacketed with an oil jacket held at about 60°C. The pigment mixture in<br>
barrel 5 may be about 80°C or higher, and may reach about as high as 120°C in<br>
barrel 7.<br>
[0043] In FIGURE 1, a fourth zone is shown by barrels 9-11, which<br>
include conveying screw elements and two vacuum ports for removing residual<br>
water as water vapor. This zone is optional but preferred, and includes one or<br>
more vacuum ports to draw off residual water clinging to the pigment flush. The<br>
water is drawn off as water vapor. Suitable vacuum ports are known to be used<br>
with extruders and typically can include a section containing a screw turned by a<br>
motor in the vacuum port to help retain the flush in the extruder, as described in<br>
U.S. Patents No. 6,273,599, 6,305,838, and 6,348,091. A vacuum pump is<br>
typically connected to the vacuum port to provide the reduced pressure. The<br>
profile of the screw used for the vacuum section preferably has a shallow<br>
channel, which tends to increase the efficiency of vacuum dehydration by<br>
shaping the material in a thin layer form. FIGURE 1 shows identical vacuum<br>
ports on consecutive extruder sections. Barrels 9 through 11 may be jacketed<br>
with a hot oil jacket held at about 40C. The evaporation and lower jacket<br>
temperature should be expected to cool the material in the extruder; in barrel 9 it<br>
may be about 70°C or higher, and by barrel 11 it may be as high as about 90°C.<br>
[0044] Barrel 9 in FIGURE 1 shows an inlet, by which a desired<br>
additive, resin, solvent, or other material may be added to obtain the desired<br>
flush or ink product composition, toner, masterbatch, or other pigmented<br>
composition. Likewise, barrels 12 and 13 illustrate ports for addition of solvent,<br>
varnish, additive, as shown, and/or other materials desired in the composition of<br>
the final flush, ink product, toner, masterbatch, or other pigmented composition.<br>
Barrels 12 to 14 are shown with a chilled water jacket for cooling the product<br>
before discharge. The cooling water jacket may be 35-40°C, so that the product<br>
exiting the extruder may be at 65°C or lower. This last zone of the extruder may<br>
be as long or short as need to introduce the desired materials, with effective<br>
mixing, and to cool the product.<br>
[0045] The process of the invention produces more consistent product<br>
with less need for adjustment of parameters during the flush process.<br>
[0046] The pigment flush produced by the inventive process may be<br>
used to prepare an ink composition according to usual methods. Alternatively,<br>
the pigment flush may be made into an ink base or a finished ink composition in<br>
the continuous process of the invention by introducing additional materials such<br>
as varnish, other resins, organic solvent and/or additives into the extruder at<br>
some point before the pigment flush is discharged, preferably after the vacuum<br>
zone. The flushed pigment dispersion and other ink component(s) are combined<br>
in the extruder so that the output from the extruder is an ink base or ink<br>
composition. Typical resins used as ink varnishes that may be added include,<br>
without limitation, alkyd resins, polyesters, phenolic resins, rosins, cellulosics,<br>
and derivatives of these such as rosin-modified phenolics, phenolic-modified<br>
rosins, hydrocarbon-modified rosins, maleic modified rosin, fumaric modified<br>
rosins; hydrocarbon resins, vinyl resins including acrylic resins, poiyvinyl chloride<br>
resins, vinyl acetate resins, polystyrene, and copolymers thereof; polyurethanes,<br>
potyamide resins, and so on. Combinations of such resins may also be<br>
employed. Suitable example of organic solvents that may be added include,<br>
without limitation, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as petroleum distillate fractions<br>
and normal and isoparaffmic solvents with limited aromatic character. Any of the<br>
many additives known in the art that may be included in the ink compositions of<br>
the invention, so long as such additives do not significantly detract from the<br>
benefits of the present invention. Illustrative examples of these include, without<br>
limitation, pour point depressants, surfactants, wetting agents, waxes,<br>
emulsifying agents and dispersing agents, defoamers, antioxidants, UV<br>
absorbers, dryers (e.g., for formulations containing vegetable oils), flow agents<br>
and other rheology modifiers, gloss enhancers, and anti-settling agents. When<br>
included, additives are typically included in amounts of at least about 0.001% of<br>
the ink composition, and the additives may be included in amounts of up to about<br>
7% by weight or more of the ink composition.<br>
[0047] The toner produced by the process may have additional<br>
materials such as silica, dispersants, charge control additives, stabilizers, waxes,<br>
and so on added, preferably after the vacuum zone,<br>
-ib[<br>
0048] The masterbatch produced by the process may likewise have<br>
additional materials added, again preferably after the vacuum zone. Examples<br>
of such additional materials include, without limitation, stabilizers, slip additives<br>
and lubricants, nucleators, antioxidants, biocides, UV absorbers, hindered amine<br>
stabilizers, antisatic agents, fillers, tackifying resins, and so on.<br>
[0049] In one important aspect of the invention, the extruder further<br>
includes at least one monitoring apparatus that continually monitors a property of<br>
the material being processed in the extruder. The apparatus measures the<br>
property of the material and compares the value measured to a desired value for<br>
the property. The apparatus then uses the comparison to adjust one or more<br>
parameters of the process.<br>
[0050] The monitoring apparatus keeps the product of the extruder<br>
usable. In this regard, because of the many properties and parameters involved<br>
in producing the organic pigment dispersions, pigment flush, or !nk product or<br>
other pigment product in a continuous process instead of in the batch processes<br>
previously used, apparatuses that provide continuing monitoring of properties of<br>
the material during the processing with automated or semi-automated<br>
adjustment of processing parameters are important in order to avoid producing<br>
large amounts of unusable off-specification material. The choice of adjustment is<br>
preferably made according to predetermined logic and is made and applied to<br>
the process by a computer processing unit or "programmable logic controller."<br>
Suitable microprocessors that can be so programmed are known and need not<br>
be described further here.<br>
[0051] "" monitoring apparatus may include one or more measuring<br>
devices selected ..om spectrophotometers, viscometers, thermocouples, pH<br>
meters, turbidity meters, conductivity meters, moisture content meters, particle<br>
size analyzers, and combinations of these. The monitoring apparatus may also<br>
include one or more control devices for the extruder selected from mass flow<br>
meters, motor amp meters, devices that control the motor speed and/or the<br>
screw rotation speed, devices that control the rate of feed of one or more feed<br>
components, devices that begin or stop feed from auxiliary feed components,<br>
devices that control the amount of vacuum applied, devices that control the<br>
processing temperature at a point in the process, and combinations of these.<br>
The monitoring apparatus may be located at any point along the extruder at an<br>
outlet or in a sample loop. The monitoring apparatus is preferably located at the<br>
exit of the extruder. The monitoring apparatus may include a diverter to isolate<br>
out-of-specification material from the product stream until the value of the<br>
measured property is again acceptable.<br>
[0052] Further details about preferred monitoring apparatus types and<br>
their use may be found in U.S. Patent No. 6,348,091. It is preferred to use such<br>
instruments to monitor one or more properties in the present process.<br>
[0053] The invention is illustrated by the following examples. The<br>
examples are merely illustrative and do not in any way limit the scope of the<br>
invention as described and claimed. AH parts are parts by weight unless<br>
otherwise noted.<br>
Example of the Invention.<br>
[0054] A twin screw co-rotating extruder with a screw diameter of 44<br>
mm, 17D of 56, and a speed of 450 rpm is used to produce a pigment flush. The<br>
(Table Removed) [0055] A 44% by weight solids, water-based, blue dispersion is fed into<br>
the first barrel of an extruder as shown in the RGURE at a rate of 117 !bs./hr<br>
along with 56% acetic acid at a feed rate of 7.0 IbsThr., an alkyd and an organic<br>
vehicle at a feed rate of 12 Ibs/hr., and a first hydrocarbon varnish at a feed rate<br>
of 19.7 IbsThr. This mass is then mixed through the end of barrel 3. The<br>
displaced water is drained from the pigment/varnish mass in barrel 4. The water<br>
should be fairly clear. Water is then charged to the extruder at Barrel 5 at a flow<br>
rate of 80 IbsThr. The crude flush product and water are mixed in barrels 6 and<br>
7A, and the water is drained from the extruder in barrel 8. Barrels 9 to <br>
comprise a vacuum dehydration zone in which further, residual water is removed<br>
from the flush product at barrels 9 and 11.<br>
[00561 The flush is reduced by addition of 9.4 Ibs/hr of a hydrocarbon<br>
varnish and 8.8 Ibs/hr of a hydrocarbon oil in Barrels 12 and 13. The pigment<br>
flush is allowed to cool. The pigment flush, hydrocarbon varnish and<br>
hydrocarbon oil are further mixed and cooled in Section 14. The resulting<br>
product is a shade converted flush with less than 2% water content.<br>
[0057] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended<br>
to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded<br>
as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
