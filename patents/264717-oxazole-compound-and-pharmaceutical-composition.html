BACKGROUND ART<br>
Various oxazole compounds have been developed and are disclosed in documents such as WO 03/072102, WO 98/15274, etc. However, the oxazole compounds of the present invention are not disclosed in any literature.<br>
Some compounds having a specific inhibitory action against phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) have been reported. However, known PDE4 inhibitors have problems of side effects such as vomit induction, nausea, etc. and/or a defect of insufficient PDE4 inhibitory action. Therefore, known PDE4 inhibitors are not clinically used as therapeutic agents.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a compound that has a PDE4 inhibitory action and is free from the above-mentioned problems of the prior art.<br>
The present inventors conducted extensive research to solve the above problems, and succeeded in synthesizing an oxazole compound with a novel structure, the compound having high specificity and a strong PDE4 inhibitory action. Further, the present inventors found that the oxazole compound is capable of exhibiting preventive and/or therapeutic effects on PDE-mediated diseases, and in particular atopic dermatitis, based on its PDE4 inhibitory action. Furthermore, the inventors found that the compound has low penetration into blood when administered transdermally, and thus has low systemic side effects.<br>
The present inventors further found that the oxazole compound is capable of exhibiting a tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-α) production inhibitory action.<br>
In chronic inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune diseases and allergic diseases, cytokines produced by<br>
mmunocompetent cells are known to be important inflammatory mediators, and among such cytokines, TNF-α is presumed to play a particularly important role. Therefore, the oxazole compound of the present invention is extremely effective for the treatment of TNF-α-mediated diseases.<br>

The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 14000 rpm for one hour. After centrifugation, the supernatant was dispensed into new tubes as PDE4D enzyme solutions, and stored in a deep freezer.<br>
(3)	Determination on dilution ratio of PDE4D enzyme solutions<br>
The PDE4D enzyme solutions prepared in (2) above were dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl solution (pH 7.4) to give 10-, 25-, 50-, 100-, 200-, 400-, and 800-fold dilutions of the enzyme solutions. PDE4D activities were measured according to (4) below. The percentage of catalyzed cAMP to total cAMP was calculated, and such a dilution, in which the percentage was between 10% and 30%, was adopted in the inhibitory study below.<br>
(4)	Measurement of PDE4D inhibitory activity<br>
Necessary amounts of test compounds were weighed, and 100 % dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added thereto to adjust the concentration to 10 mM. The solutions were stored in a freezer as stock solutions of each test compound. After being thawed when required, the solutions were diluted 20-fold with 100 % DMSO to give a 500 µM concentration. Further, 10-fold serial dilutions were made with 100 % DMSO to prepare test compounds of different<br>
concentrations. 2 µl of solutions containing one of each of the test compound were separately added into 1.2 ml tubes in which 23<br>
[µl of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) had been placed beforehand. 25 µl of a PDE4D enzyme solution diluted at an optimal ratio determined in (3) above were added on ice to each of the tubes, and 50 [µl of a substrate solution containing 2 [µM[3H]cAMP prepared by dilution with a 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM MgCl2 was added thereto.  The final DMSO concentration in the reaction liquid was<br><br>
-248-? %. After mixing, the mixture was incubated for 10 minutes at 30 °C. At the completion of the incubation, the tubes were placed in a bath containing boiling water for 3 minutes, and the reaction was stopped. After cooling the tubes in ice, 25 µ1 solution of 0.2 mg/ml snake venom was added thereto, and after mixing the mixture was incubated for 10 minutes at 30 °C. At the completion of the incubation, 0.4 ml of a Dowex 1x8 resin solution prepared in an EtOH:H2O (1:1) solution was added thereto. After mixing, the tubes were allowed to stand at room temperature for at least an hour. 50 µ1 of the supernatant in one of each of the tubes was moved to one of the wells of a topCount plate, and the plate was dried overnight. 3H radioactivity (cpm) was measured using a TopCount .<br>
The IC50 values (concentration which produced 50% inhibition of substrate hydrolysis) for the test compounds were determined with the Excel (Microsoft Excel 2000 SR-1) statistical package using regression analysis function.<br>
The results are shown in Table 41. The table demonstrates that compounds represented by formula (I) have the outstanding PDE4 inhibitory activities.<br>

Test: Example 2 5      Inhibitory activity measurement on TNF-cx production<br>
TNF-a production inhibitory activity was  evaluated according to the  following tests. (1)   Isolation of mononuclear cells from mouse peripheral blood<br>
Mononuclear   cells   were   isolated   from  heparinized  blood 10      obtained    from    male    BALB/c    mice     (Charles    River    Laboratories,<br>
Japan) by density gradient centrifugation using Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane Laboratories) . Viable cell numbers in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were counted using trypan blue dye, and prepared in cell culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FCS) to 1.25 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
(2)	Induction of TNF-a production<br>
Test  compounds  were  dissolved  in  DMSO,  and test compound solutions were diluted for use in cell culture media. 20<br>
µl test compound solutions of different concentrations and 160 µl peiripheral blood mononuclear cell suspensions were placed in a 96-well plate, and cultured for 30 minutes. 20 µl (final concentration 1 (µg/ml) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from E. coli (serotype 055:B5) was added thereto to induce TNF-a production. The mixtures were then cultured at 37 °C for 5 hours, and the culture supernatant was removed from each well.<br>
(3)	Measurement of TNF-a concentration<br>
TNF-a concentrations in the culture supernatants were measured by ELISA (OptEIA™ Set Mouse TNF-a, BD Pharmingen) . The IC50 values (concentration which produced 50% inhibition of TNF-a production) for the test compounds were determined with the Excel (Microsoft Excel 2000 SR-1) statistical package using regression analysis function.<br>
The results obtained are shown in table 42.<br>
