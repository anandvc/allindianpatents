IONIC LIQUIDS BASED ON IMIDAZOLIUM SALTS INCORPORATING A NITRILE FUNCTIONALITY<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel ionic liquids. The ionic liquids can be used as solvents to immobilize catalysts for the biphasic or multiphasic synthesis of chemical products such as Pharmaceuticals.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Ionic liquids are salts with a melting temperature below the boiling point of water. Ionic liquids useful as solvents in industrial applications are also liquids at room temperature.<br>
Room temperature ionic liquids or molten salts were described for the first time in U. S. Pat. No. 2,446,331. The problem with these ionic liquids described in this patent is that the anionic component can decompose on contact with atmospheric moisture.<br>
More recently, air and moisture stable ionic liquids have been prepared, and now extensive studies have been carried out in two main areas:<br>
1.	The development of new ionic liquids based on many different cation<br>
and anion combinations.<br>
2.	The application of ionic liquids as immobilizing media for lanthanide<br>
and actinide series and transition metal catalysts.<br>
Ionic liquids are currently attracting considerable attention as novel solvents for organic synthesis and catalysis because the chemical industry is under pressure to replace environmentally damaging volatile organic solvents with more benign alternatives. "Room temperature ionic liquids", especially those based on 1,3-dialkylimidazolium cations, have emerged as leading contenders since they have negligible vapor pressure, are air and moisture stable, and are highly solvating for both ionic and molecular species, and as a result are suitable for multiphasic catalysis. Although applications in synthesis and catalysis have been most widely explored, with the first industrial scale process now on-line for over a year, ionic liquids are also finding uses in separation processes, in electrochemistry, as electrolytes in solar cells, as lubricants, and as matrices in MALDI mass spectrometry.<br><br>
One of the attractive features of ionic liquids in synthesis and catalysis is that both the cationic and anionic components can be varied and modified, so that a liquid can be tailored to specific applications. The term "task-specific ionic liquids" has been used to describe low melting salts with functional groups, such as amine and amide, sulfonic acid, ether and alcohol, carboxylic, urea and thiourea and phosphine functionalities, as well as fluorous chains attached to the alkyl side chains. The definition of task-specific ionic liquids is also extended to include ionic liquids with functional anions such as carboranes, metal carbonyl anions such as [Co(CO)4]  the proprietary catalyst [Rh(CO)2|2] and alkylselenites.<br>
If ionic liquids are to be used to immobilize catalysts in multiphasic reactions, then the design and synthesis of task-specific ionic liquids is extremely important. Many different reactions have been catalyzed using ionic liquids as immobilization solvents including hydrogenation, hydroformylation and C-C coupling reactions. While the non-nucieophilic nature of many ionic liquids seems to be advantageous, providing a protective environment for the catalyst which can extend its lifetime, it has also emerged that ionic liquids that incorporate a coordination centre might be extremely useful, such that the ionic liquid serves as both immobilization solvent and ligand to the catalyst. Wasserscheid et a/first described this concept by introducing a diphenylphosphine group at the 2-position of an imidazolium cation; the resulting salt was a not a "room temperature ionic liquid" and had to be dissolved in another ionic liquid for effective use in biphasic catalysis. The ligand, by virtue of being a salt, is highly soluble in ionic liquids and is strongly retained during product extraction. Groups such as NH2 and OH have also been successfully introduced into the imidazolium cation moieties but their ability to coordinate to lanthanide and actinide series and transition metals to give catalytically useful complexes is somewhat limited. More sophisticated functional groups such as thioureas and thioethers have been tethered to imidazolium based ionic liquids and they have been shown to extract toxic metal ions from aqueous solution.<br>
It is one object of this invention to provide the synthesis and characterization of quaternized nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, e.g. especially imidazolium or pyridinium heterocyclic compounds, such as salts, in which a nitrile group is attached to the alkyl side chain. The nitrile group is chosen as it is a promising donor to main group<br><br>
metals such as lithium and potassium, as well as lanthanide and actinide series and transition metals such as palladium and platinum. The physicochemical properties of these new ionic liquids are described. It is a further object of this invention to provide information about the relationship of the length of the alkyl unit linking the quatemized nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring and the CN group, and how this relationship influences the melting point of the ionic liquid. Yet another object of this invention is to produce ionic liquids, which provide coordination centers (i.e. that act as ligands), while maintaining a low melting point, less than about 100°Cf ideally at or below room temperature (i.e., acting as a solvent). A still further object of the invention is to demonstrate the applicability of these new ionic liquids in catalysis; as they have particular value in the immobilization of catalysts, enabling the catalyst to be recovered and efficiently recycled.<br>
It is yet a further aspect of the invention to provide dual-functionalized ionic liquids and their properties.<br>
Description and Summary of the Invention<br>
Novel chemical compounds are provided of the general formula,<br><br>
in which K+ is a 5- or 6- membered heterocyclic ring having 1-3 hetero atoms, which can be independently N, S, or O;<br>
with the proviso that at least one of the hetero atoms must be a quatemized nitrogen atom having a -R'CN substituent, wherein R' is alkyl (Cj to C12);<br>
the heterocyclic ring having up to 4 or 5 substituents independently chosen from the moieties:<br>
(OH;<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Most particularly preferred are the imidazoiium and pyridinium rings. Essentially any combination of cation with one or more R'C^N groups with any anion that results in a salt with a melting point below 100°C is included.<br>
In a further aspect the invention provides ionic liquids with a functionalized anion, in place of the usual anions which include BF4~, PF6\ NO3\ CH3CO2", CF3SO3~, (CF3SO2)2N"I (CF3SO2)3C", CF3CO2\ N(CN)2~. The functionalized anion may be a nitrile functionalized anion, e.g. [BF3RCN]" wherein R' is alkyl (d to C18,for example C, to C12). Preferably the anion is [BF3CHCH3CH2CN]HOW TO MAKE THE IONIC K*A' LIQUIDS<br>
The synthetic route to prepare the K+A" salts utilizes as starting material the appropriate alkyl-substituted heterocyclic compound, which is then reacted with the appropriate chloroalkyl nitrile. The reactants are employed in approximately equimolar quantities, in a solvent which can be any of the usual solvent systems for heterocyclic chemistry, such as tetrahydofuran, acetonitrile, and diethyl ether. The reaction proceeds at ambient temperatures up to about 200°C.<br>
The synthesis of e.g., 1-alkylnitrile-3-methylimidazolium and 1-alkylnitrile-2,3-dimethylimidazolium salts is depicted in Scheme 1, below. The imidazolium chlorides, e.g., [1-alkylnitrile-3-methylimidazolium][CI], wherein alkyl is C=1-12, especially C=1-4, such as (Cn = (CH2)n, n = 1 1a, n = 2 2a, n = 3 3a and n = 4 4a) are prepared in high yield from 1-methylimidazoie and the appropriate chloroalkyl nitrile CI(CH2)nCN in a modification to the literature procedure for the related 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides. The 1-alkylnitrile-2(3-dimethylimidazolium salt[1-alkylnitrile-3-methylimidazolium]Cl 5a is prepared similarly from 1,2-dirnethyiimidazoie and CI(CH2)3CN. The synthesis of 1a has been described previously using an alternative a somewhat more complicated method. Both methods are found in the references: (a) Hitchcock, P. B.; Seddon, K. R.; Weiton, T. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1993, 2639. (b) Suarez, P. A. Z.; Dullius, J. E. L; Einloft, S.; de Souza, R. F.; Dupont, J. Polyhedron 1996, 15, 1217, and Herrmann, W. A.; Goossen, L J.; Spiegler, M.; Organometallics 1998, *7,2162.<br><br>
The relatively strong electron withdrawing effect of the nitrile group activates chloromethylacetonitrile CICH2CN to such an extent that it reacts smoothly with 1-methylimidazole in the absence of solvent to give 1a. However, as the alkyl chain in the chloroalkyi nitrile CI(CH2)nCN precursor increases in length, the temperature required to complete the reaction also increases.<br><br>
Scheme 1: Synthesis of ionic liquids: 1a n = 1, R = H; 2a n = 2, R = H; 3a n = 3, R = H; 4an = 4,R = H;5an = 3,R = CH3;1b n= 1,R = H,A=PF6; 1cn= 1, R = H,A = BF4; 2b n = 2, R = H, A = PF6; 2c n = 2, R = H, A = BF4; 3b n = 3, R = H, A = PF6; 3c n = 3, R = H, A = BF4; 4b n = 4, R = H, A = PF6; 4c n = 4, R = H, A = BF4; 5b n = 3. R = CH3l A = PF6; 5c n = 3, R = CH3, A = BF4.<br>
Reaction of 1a - 4a with a molecular equivalent of HPF6 or NaBF4 affords the irnidazolium salts [1-alkyJnitrile-3-methylimida2olium3[PF6] (n = 1 - 4) 1b - 4b and [1-alkylnitrile-3-methylimidazolium][BF4] (n = 1 -4) 1c - 4c, respectively. The imidazolium salts [1-alkylnitrile-3-methylimidazolium]PF65b and [1-alkylnitrile-3-methylimidazolium]BF45c are prepared from 5a using an analogous method. For 1b -5b the salts are washed with water in order to remove the hydrogen chloride formed during the anion exchange reaction, whereas tetrohydrofuran and diethyl ether are used to wash 1c - 5c. The salts are then dried under vacuum for 1 - 2 days. The salts 2c, 3c, 4a, 4b and 3c are liquid at room temperature and are further purified by filtration through silica and left under vacuum at 40 - 50°C for several days. All the imidazolium salts are obtained in medium to high yield. They are stable in air and show no signs of<br><br>
decomposition up to 150°C.    Some of the ionic liquids within the scope of this invention are listed in the examples and appendix).<br>
The synthetic route to prepare ionic liquids with a functionalized anion involves the preparation of the anion as a potassium salt, followed by anion metathesis with various imidazolium halides. The synthesis of e.g. K[BF3CHCH3CH2CN]~ is depicted in Scheme 2. The first step of the anion synthesis involves hydroboration of ally) cyanide using boron trichloride and triethylsilane, then addition of water to afford the boronic acid wich is subsequently stirred with KHF2 in ether/H2O at ambient temperature. The product, K[BF3CHCH3CH2CN]" 1, is recrystallized from acetone on addition of diethyl ether as colourless needles in 74% yield. Surprisingly alpha-alkene hydroboration affords boronic esters or acids at the alpha-position.<br>
Commencing with 1-methylimidazole or 1-trimethylsylilimidazole a series of imidazolium halides 2-10 were prepared. Subsequent metathesis with 1 in acetone give the dual-functionalized ionic liquids 11 -19 in yield of 80 to 90%.<br><br><br>
USES OF THE IONIC LIQUIDS<br>
These ionic liquids can react with lanthanide and actinide series and transition metal chlorides and other metal salts or compounds used as catalysts to form complexes, for example, with PdCI2l PtCI2, RuCI3, RhCI3, and [Ru(arene)CI2]2. Included within the term salts are not only the chlorides, but other salts which are known and employed to those skilled in the art. Metal containing molecular compounds used as catalysts, e.g. Wilkinson's catalyst and Grubb's catalyst, or the like can also be employed in this invention.<br>
The process of making the complex is a straightforward one of dissolving a catalytically effective amount of the desired catalyst in enough of the ionic liquid to form a solution. If the catalyst and ionic liquid solution is to be used immediately in a catalyzed reaction, the amounts of the two can be those required for the reaction, the ionic liquid serving as solvent for the reaction step immediately following. The reaction product usually is separated from the reactants by solvent extraction, but the immobilized catalyst remains in the ionic liquid solvent, so is recovered and can be used for another reaction. The catalyst can also be prepared in a concentrated form in the ionic liquid , then later diluted with an excess of the ionic liquid to the desired catalyst concentration.<br>
Since these complexes form part of the liquid, they are highly soluble in the ionic liquid. Many will catalyze a wide range of organic transformations, like hydrogenation, hydroformylation, metathesis, C-C coupling reactions, dimerization, oligomerization and<br>
polymerization.<br>
The main advantages of the invention are:<br>
1.	The ionic liquids act as both ligand and solvent when used as media for<br>
organic synthesis in multiphasic catalysis, therefore, no other ligands are necessary.<br>
2.	The catalysts are strongly immobilized in the ionic liquids and can be<br>
easily recycled without loss (or minimal loss) of the catalyst.<br>
The dual-functionalized ionic liquids are particularly advantageous due to their very low viscosities, e.g. as shown in Examples 33 to 35.<br><br>
As noted above, the nitrile derivatized ionic liquids of this invention are useful as solvents for multiphasic catalysis, in terms of catalyst retention and product separation-Dissolution of PdCI2 in (C3CNmim][BF4] 3c affords [Pd(NCC3mim)2Cl2][BF4]2 in quantitative yield. The resulting solution is used to hydrogenate 1,3,-cyclohexadiene under biphasic conditions, which affords cyclohexene and cyclohexane. The overall conversion is 90% and the turnover frequency 247 molmofV1; cyclohexene is formed with a selectivity of 97%. This is possibly because the monoene dissociates from the catalyst and is less soluble in the ionic liquid than the diene, which is therefore hydrogenated in preference. Hydrogenation reactions have been widely studied in ionic liquids, including the substrate 1,3-cyclohexadiene, but this would appear to be the first time selectivity to cyclohexene has been observed. Selective hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene using palladium and platinum complexes with chiral ferrocenylamine sulfide and selenide ligands has been reported previously. It is clearly an advantage that the palladium ionic liquids system gives such selectivity without the need for aditional co-ligands. However, the most important feature of this system is that the catalyst is part of the ionic liquid and therefore not easily lost during extraction of the product. No decrease in activity is observed after re-use of the catalyst solution. No palladium residues in the organic phase are detected using inductively coupled plasma analysis.<br>
This invention is illustrated by the following examples. EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are given to illustrate the synthesis of these ionic liquids and application in catalysis.<br>
The 1-methylimidazole and 1,2-dimethylimidazole and chloronitriles are purchased from Fluka, HPF6 and NaBF4 are purchased from Aldrich and are used as received without further purification. The synthesis of the imidazolium salts 1a - 5a is performed under an inert atmosphere of dry nitrogen using standard Schlenk techniques in solvents dried using the appropriate reagents and distilled prior to use. All other<br><br>
compounds are made without precautions to exclude air or moisture. IR spectra are recorded on a Perkin-Elmer FMR 2000 system. NMR spectra are measured on a Bruker DMX 400, using SiMe4 for H 85% H3PO4 for 31P, as external standards at 20°C. Electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) are recorded on a ThermoFinnigan LCQ™ Deca XP Plus quadrupole ion trap instrument on sample diluted in methanol.19 Samples are infused directly into the source at 5 pL min'1 using a syringe pump and the spray voltage is set at 5 kV and the capillary temperature at 50°C. Samples 2c, 3c, 4a, 4b and 4c are purified by filtration through silica and left under vacuum (ca. 0.1 mm Hg) at 40 - 50°C in order to remove traces of salt impurities and volatile components. Differential scanning calorimetry is performed with a SETARAM DSC 131. Density is determined with a picometer at room temperature (20 ± 1°C) on 1.0 ml of sample. The measurements are repeated three times and average values are used. Viscosities are measured with a Brookfield DV-II+ viscometer on 0.50 ml of sample. The temperature of the samples is maintained to 25 ± 1°C by means of an external temperature controller. The measurements are performed in duplicate.<br>
