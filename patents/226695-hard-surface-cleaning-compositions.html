HARD SURFACE CLEANING COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to sprayable disinfecting hard surface cleaning compositions. More particularly the present invention relates to thickened lavatory cleaning compositions which provide a cleaning and disinfecting effect to hard surfaces, and which include visibly discernible inclusions.<br>
Cleaning compositions which also provide a disinfecting or sanitizing effect are commercially important products. Such compositions enjoy a wide field of utility in assisting in the removal of stains and grime from surfaces, especially those characterized as useful with "hard surfaces". Hard surfaces are those which are frequently encountered in lavatories such as lavatory fixtures such as toilets, shower stalls, bathtubs, bidets, sinks, etc., as well as countertops, walls, floors, etc. Two types of commonly encountered stains in lavatories include "hard water" stains and "soap scum" stains. Such hard surfaces, and such stains, may also be found in different environments as well, including kitchens, hospitals, etc.<br>
Various formulations in compositions of cleaning agents have been produced and are known to the art which cleaning agents are generally suited for one type of stain but not necessarily for both classes of stains. For example, it is known to the art that highly acidic cleaning agents comprising strong acids, such as hydrochloric acids, are useful in the removal of hard water stains. However, the presence of strong acids is known to be an irritant to the skin and further offers the potential of toxicological danger. Other classes of cleaning compositions and formulations are known to be useful upon soap scum stains, however, generally such compositions comprise an organic and/or inorganic acid, one or more synthetic detergents from commonly recognized classes such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,061,393; U.S. Patent No. 5,008,030; U.S. Patent No. 4,759,867; U.S. Patent No. 5,192,460; U.S. Patent No. 5,039,441. Generally, the compositions described in these patents are claimed to be effective in the removal of soap scum stains from such hard surfaces and may find further limited use in other classes of stains.<br><br>
However, the formulations of most of the compositions within the aforementioned patents generally have relatively high amounts of acids (organic and/or inorganic) which raises toxicological concerns, and further none of the above patents provide any disinfecting properties.<br>
While many disinfecting hard surface cleaning compositions are known to the art, there is nonetheless a need for further improved compositions in the art<br>
According to the one aspect of the invention, there is provided a sprayable hard surface cleaning and/or disinfecting composition which comprises (preferably consists essentially of):<br>
a thickener constituent which comprises both gellan gum and xanthan gum;<br>
at least one anionic surfactant;<br>
at least erne nonionic surfactant;<br>
an acid constituent;<br>
suspended inclusions which appear as visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials, preferably where said discrete particulate materials are based on alginates, preferably two or more classes of visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials present as suspended inclusions;<br>
at least one organic solvent;<br>
optionally, at least one further detersive surfactant selected from amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants;<br>
optionally, one or more constituents for improving the aesthetic or functional features of the inventive compositions; and;<br>
water.<br>
In further aspects of the invention there are provided processes for the production of the aforesaid compositions.<br>
It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a readily sprayable cleaning composition which features the benefits described above.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a process for the improvement of the simultaneous cleaning and sanitization of hard surfaces, which process comprises the step of: providing a composition as outlined above, and applying an effective amount to a hard surface requiring such treatment<br><br>
Particularly preferred compositions according to the invention are acidic in character, are effective in the removal of both soap scum stains and hard water stains, and which compositions provide an effective sanitizing effect to hard surfaces. Further, particularly preferred sprayable compositions may be dispensed from a manually operable trigger pump spray ^paratus and the composition provided by such device has visibly discernible, visibly discrete particulate materials on a treated hard surface.<br>
The inventive compositions necessarily comprise a thickener constituent hi addition to the gellan gum and the xanthan gum, one or more further thicteners may also be included in the inventive compositions. By way of non-limiting example such further thickeners include erne or more of; cellulose, alkyi celluloses, alkoxy celluloses, hydroxy alkyl celluloses, alkyl hydroxy alkyi celluloses, carboxy alkyi celluloses, caiboxy alkyi hydroxy alkyl celluloses, and mixtures thereof Examples of the cellulose derivatives include ethyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose, carboxy methyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, and ethyl hydroxy ethyl cellulose. Preferably, the thickener constituent is a mixture of xanthan gum and gellan gum to the exclusion of other thickener constituents described herein. Further examples of preferred thickener constituents are described in the Examples.<br>
The gellan gum and the xanthan gum may be present in the thickener constituent in any relative amounts with respect to each other. Desirably however the ratio of gellan gum to xanthan gum on a respective parts by weight basis is from 1:1-10, preferably 1:1-5 but more preferably from 1:1 to Imparts by weight These preferred respective weight ratios may be used in the presence of further thickeners forming the thickener constituent, and especially preferably are used in the absence of further thickeners. The present inventors have observed that the combination of gellan gum and xanthan gum, especially in flie respective weight ratios described above are particularly effective in providing the desirable xheological properties to the sprayable compositions. Even minor amounts of gellan gum when combined with xanthan gum may provide surprisingly good thickening and desirable rheological properties.<br>
The amount of thickener present in the composition may be any amount which is effective in suspending the suspended inclusions as hereinafter described. Desirably the<br><br>
composition of the present of invention is thickened to a viscosity range of from about 25 to about 300 centipoise, preferably to a viscosity of from about 100 to about 300 centipoise, more preferably is in the range of about 50-200 centipoise measured at room temperature, on a LVTDV n Brookfield viscometer, spindle #1, at 30 rpm, measured at 25°C. Generally good thickening has been observed when the total amount of the thickeners are present in amount from about 0.001 to about 5% by weight, more preferably from about 0.001 to about 3% by weight, more preferably from about 0.001 -1.5%wt, still more preferably from about 0.01-0.50%wt and most preferably the total amount of the thickeners are present in the inventive compositions in amount of from about 0.03%wt to about 0.20%wt<br>

Also where the acids are selected to feature disinfecting properties, they concomitantly provide anti-microbial activity necessary to disinfect the cleaned surface.<br>
As a necessary constituent, the inventive compositions include suspended inclusions based on alginates. These suspended inclusions appear as visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials to the consumer of the inventive compositions. These suspended inclusions desirably appear as small discrete visible particles suspended within the composition, particularly by a consumer having normal "20/20" vision. It is to be understood however that not all of the particulate materials present in the inventive composition need be visibly discernible as a portion of the particulate materials may be smaller than the visible threshold of the consumer having normal vision. It is nonetheless required that at least a portion of the particulate materials present in the inventive composition need be visibly discernible as discrete particles.<br>

The suspended inclusions present in the inventive compositions are based cm alginates although other visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials may be used as well, or in the place of alginate based materials. However the preferred suspended inclusions are based on alginates.<br>
Alginate based particulate materials used for the suspended inclusions in fee inventive compositions may be formed from an alginate or salts of alginic acid such as potassium alginate, calcium alginate or sodium alginate salts, and advantageously may be<br><br>
conveniently harvested from naturally occurring seaweed especially of the species Laminaria wherein the sodium alginate form predominates. Alginates typically consist of sequences of α-L-guluronic acid and β-D-mannuronic acid which may be present in the alginate in various differing ratios. The term "beads" conveniently describes the geometry of the alginate based particulate materials as when these are formed form an aqueous slurry containing an alginate such as sodium alginate with one or more further constituents and thai expelled to form individual particles or droplets, the coalescing aqueous slurry may form generally spherical particles, hence the term "beads**. Of course, other processes for the formation of alginate based suspended inclusions are also contemplated as being useful in conjunction with the present invention such as processes wherein the alginate optionally containing one or more further constituents is comminuted by other methods, such as milling, grinding or other known art technique. In such instances the comminuted alginate based suspended inclusions may not necessarily form generally spherical particles but may form individual particles of irregular geometry. In such an instance the largest dimension of such individual particles of irregular geometry are used as the basis for determining the average particle size of the<br>
In a preferred embodiment the alginate beads are based on calcium alginates as the calcium salts of alginates are insoluble or poorly soluble in water, and thus are particularly desirable in the present inventive compositions which are substantially aqueous. The calcium salts of alginates used to form the alginate based particulate materials preferably exhibit little swelling or. collapse when incorporated in the present inventive composition.<br>
The alginate based particulate materials may contain from about 0.5%wt to 100%wt of an alginate or alginate salt, although quite frequently the amount of alginate in the alginate based particulate materials are much less, generally on from about 0.5%wt to about 10%wt» more preferably from about 0.5%wt to about 5%wt Such alginate based particulate materials may be conveniently referred to as "alginate beads". Such alginate beads may be formed by a variety of known art processes including those described in the background section of PCT/US95/08313 to Thomas et al., as well as in US 6,467,699 Bl, the contents of which are incorporated by reference. Alternately such alginate based particulate materials may be commercially purchased from various<br><br>
suppliers, including geniaLab BioTechnologie (Braunschwig, Germany). As noted the composition of the alginate based particulate materials may include only a small proportion of an alginate or alginate salt, and may include one or more further non-alginate materials especially one or more inorganic materials such as titanium dioxide which improves the opacity, hence the visibility of the beads, as well as one or more coloring agents such as pigments such as ultramarine blue, said coloring agents which also improve the aesthetic appearance of the beads. Other further non-alginate materials not recited herein may also  include in thexomposition of the lginate based particulate materials. The alginate based particulate materials maybe composed of a major proportion of water which is entrained within the structure of the discrete alginate based particulates and due to the highly porous character of alginates when in an aqueous compositions 80%wi, and usually 90%wt or even greater of the mass of the discrete alginate based particulates may be water with the remaining balance to 100%wt being the alginate or alginate salt, mid one oFmore further  non-alginate materials. Conveniently such alginate based particulate materials may be prepared, stored and sold as a slurry of discrete alginate based particulates in an aqueous-based carrier composition which may contain a minor amount of one or more further additives such as one or more salts especially chloride salts such as calcium chloride, as well as a preservative for inhibiting the growth of undesirable microorganisms in the slurry containing the discrete alginate based particulates. A preferred commercially available alginate based particulate material comprise from about 0.5%wt to about 5%wt of a calcium alginate, a pigment present in an amount up to about 0.01%wt, from about 0.1 %wt to about 5%wt of TiCfe and die remaining balance of the mass of the alginate based particulate material comprised of a 2% calcium chloride solution in water which may also con an a minor amount, approx. 2% of calcium chloride. Such an alginate based particulate material can be separated from its aqueous-based carrier composition by means of a fine sieve or other means for decanting the aqueous-based carrier composition from the alginate based particulate materials.<br>
By the term "suspended" when referring to inclusions is to be understood that when the formed inventive compositions are manually shaken and then allowed to return to a quiescent state, such as by permitting them to stand on a tabletop or other surface at<br><br>
room temperature (appiox. 20°Q for 48 hours, the majority of the inclusions do not drop more than 7%, preferably do not drop more than 5%, most preferably do not drop more than 2% of their original distance from the bottom of the container in which the inventive composition is present when they have returned to a quiescent state following manual shaking. By "majority of inclusions"is meant to convey that at least 90% of preferably at least 95% and most preferably at least 97% of the inclusions physically present in the compositions. This is a particularly attractive and characteristic feature of preferred embodiments of inventive compositions, as the suspended inclusions do not appear to move perceptibly over long periods of time. Desirably, at least 90% of, preferably at least 95% and most preferably at least 97% of the inclusions physically present in the compositions do not drop more than 5%, most preferably do not drop more than 2% of their original distance from the bottom of the container in which the inventive composition is present when they have returned to a quiescent state following manual shaking when measured after 72 hours, more preferably when measured after 168 hours, still more preferably when measured after 10 days, yet more preferably after 14 days when left in a quiescent state at room temperature.

According to certain particularly preferred aspects of the invention, the inventive compositions comprise two or more classes of visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials  present as suspended inclusions. What is to be understood by the term "class" is a group of visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials present as suspended inclusions which present a characteristic visual appearance to the consumer of the product made of a plurality of individual particles which are indistinguishable from one another. Examples of characteristic visual appearances include, e.g., color, size, translucency or opacity, as well as average size and geometrical shape of the individual particles. Examples of two or more classes of visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials present as suspended inclusions in preferred embodiments of the invention include by way of non-limiting example: visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials<br><br>
of two or more different colors; visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials of two or more different sizes; visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials of different degrees of translucency or opacity; as well as visibly discernible, discrete particles of two or more distinguishable particle shapes or geometries. Of course, the two or more classes of visibly discernible discrete particulate materials present as suspended inclusions in certain preferred embodiments of the invention may be various combinations of the above exemplary visually distinguishable types, including: compositions comprising visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials of two, three, four or more different colors wherein the discrete particulate materials otherwise have essentially the same particle size and particle shapes. Alternately preferred as the two or more classes of visibly discernible discrete particulate materials present in the compositions include visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials of two, three, four or more different colors wherein the discrete particulate materials otherwise have different particle sizes and/or different particle shapes irregardless of the colors of the particulate materials.

other.<br>
The selection of the appearance characteristics two or more classes of visibly discernible, discrete particulate materials present as suspended inclusions may be desired from a consumer standpoint particularly to enhance the appearance of a product composition. The inclusion of two, but especially three or more classes of colored particulate materials each class being of a different contrasting color is particularly advantageous as providing an attractive appearance. Alternately the inclusion of two, but especially three or more classes of colored particulate materials each class being of a different contrasting color and also wherein average particle size of at least two classes of colored particulate materials are different is also particularly advantageous as providing an attractive appearance as welL<br><br>

When present, the pH adjusting agent, especially the pH buffers are present in an amount effective in order to maintain the pH of the inventive composition within a target pH range.<br>
As the compositions are largely aqueous in nature, and compR1ses as the balance of the composition water in to order to provide to 100% by weight of the compositions of the invention. The water maybe tap water, but is preferably distilled and is most preferably deiomzed water. If the water is tap water, it is preferably substantially free of any undesirable impuR1ties such as organics or inorganics, especially minerals salts which are present in hard water which may thus undesirably interfere with the operation of the constituents present in the aqueous compositions according to the invention.<br>
The inventive compositions provide certain technical benefits when used on hard surfaces, particularly: satisfactory removal of hard water stains, satisfactory removal of soap scum stains, and satisfactory disinfection or sanitization of hard surfaces. In preferred embodiments, the compositions are readily pumpable using a manually operable tR1gger spray apparatus are be desirably provided as a ready to use product in a container package which compR1ses a manually operable tR1gger spray apparatus and a non-pressuR1zed reservoir or bottle for containing the inventive compositions. In use, the consumer generally applies an effective amount of the composition and within a few moments thereafter, wipes off the treated area with a rag, towel, brush or sponge, usually a disposable paper towel or sponge, hi certain applications, however, especially where<br><br>
undesirable stain deposits are heavy, the composition according to the invention may be left on the stained area until it has effectively loosened the stain deposits after which it may then be wiped off, R1nsed of£ or otherwise removed. For particularly heavy deposits of such undesired stains, multiple applications may also be used.<br>
A particularly advantageous feature of the inventive compositions is that as the suspended inclusions are visibly discrete and visibly discernible to the consumer, these same inclusions are visible to the consumer on hard surfaces to which the inventive compositions have been applied This permits for ready visual inspection of the coverage of the hard surface by an inventive compositions immediately after application of the composition by a consumer. Such provides not only an attractive attR1bute to commercial products based on such compositions but also provides a visual indicator to the consumer of thorough coverage and contact with hard surfaces. This visual indicator provides an important means whereby the consumer may visually inspect a surface, particularly a surface wherein the presence of undesired microorganisms is suspected, to ensure that thorough coverage and contact with said hard surface is realized. As is known, physical contact between the inventive composition and undesired microorganisms is required in order to the inventive compositions to provide a disinfecting effect<br>
An important technical characteR1stic lies in rheology of the inventive compositions. The compositions maybe descR1bed as being iheopectic at lower shear rates, an especially upon standing in quiescent state, but are thixotropic at higher shear rates. Such dual properties are very advantageous, as when the compositions are at rest in a container, e.g., upon standing, their iheopectic behavior provides for the stable suspension of the inclusions descR1bed herein. When it is desired to dispense the compositions from a container especially through a manually operable tR1gger pump spray apparatus, the thixotropic characteR1stics of the compositions permit for their dispensing through the nozzle of such a pump spray apparatus. An exemplary manually operable tR1gger pump spray apparatus, such as a "Specialty TR1gger Pump Spray/Off" (ex. Owens-Illinois Corp.). Ideally, after being dispensed from such a pump spray apparatus and onto a surface, especially an inclined surface the compositions return to a quiescent state and once again display a rheqpectic behavior. Furthermore, as at least some of the suspended inclusions are delivered from the composition and onto the<br><br>
surface, these inclusions are present on fee surface and provide a useful indicator as to fee coverage of the sprayed composition onto fee surface.<br>
Alternatively in certain preferred embodiments the compositions of fee invention may be provided in a conventional aerosol as well, and a propellant added to the constituents making up fee composition. However fee latter use of fee inventive compositions in an aerosol dispenser is unlikely to be adopted for practical use as current conventional aerosol dispenser are typically metal canisters which do not readily permit for fee consumer to enjoy the appearance of the visibly discernible, visibly discrete particulate mateR1als as suspended inclusions when fee compositions are in a quiescent state. Nonetheless, the use of compositions provided in aerosol canisters does provide the benefit of pressuR1zed dispensing of fee composition, and the composition applied to a hard surface does present fee visibly discernible, visibly discrete particulate mateR1als on a treated surface. Nonetheless, the use of a manually operable tR1gger pump spray apparatus with the inventive compositions is usually preferred.<br>
The inventive compositions are desirably provided as a ready to use product which may be directly applied to a hard surface. By way of example, hard surfaces suitable for coating wife fee polymer include surfaces composed of refractory matariqip such as: glazed and unglazed tile, bR1ck, porcelain, glazed ceramics, vitreous ceramics such as china; glass; metals; plastics, e.g. polyester, vinyl, fiberglass, Formica®, CoR1an®; and other hard surfaces known to th<e industry. such known hard su are usually non-porous. surfaces which to be particularly denoted lavatory fixtures as shower stalls bathtubs and bathing appliances curtains doors bars toilets bidets wall floor1ng especially those include refractory mater1als the like. further associated wife kitchen environments other food preparation including cabinets countertop well walls floor plastics glass. still with medical facilities e.g. hospitals clinics laborator1es testing laborator1es.></e>
The compositions according to fee invention are easily produced by any of a number of known art techniques. Conveniently, a part of the water is supplied to a<br><br>
suitable mixing vessel further provided with a stirrer or agitator, and while stirring, the remaining constituents are added to the mixing vessel, including any final amount of water needed to provide to 100%wt of the inventive composition. The order of addition is often not critical but preferably, under constant stirring, to a portion of the water is first added the thickener constituent, thereafter stirring is allowed to continue until fee thickener constituents hemogemouslyjistributed in the water. Preferably a homogenizer or other high shear mixing device is used however so to ensure the uniform mixing of the thickener constituent in the compositions taught herein. Subsequently the nonionic surfactant is added, then the organic solvent if present, then the anionic surfactant followed by fee remaining constituents, including optional constituent Thereafter, the suspended inclusions are introduced, desirably as an aqueous shiny containing fee alginate based inclusions in an aqueous carrier, and finally fee remaining quantity of water needed to provide 100%wt of fee composition. While the process may be practiced at room temperature (approx. 20°C) it may be advantageous to heat the initial charge of water to an elevated temperature, e.g., even in excess of 90°C to facilitate the incorporation of one or more of fee constituents, particularly fee thickener constituents into fee water.<br>
The following examples below illustrate exemplary formulations and preferred formulations of fee inventive composition. It is to be understood that these examples are presented by means of illustration only and that further useful formulations fell within fee scope of this invention and the claims may be readily produced by one skilled in fee art and not deviate from fee scope and spirit of the invention Throughout this specification and in fee accompanying claims, weight percents of any constituent are to be understood as fee weight percent of fee active portion of fee referenced constituent, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Examples Exemplary formulations illustrating certain preferred embodiments of fee inventive compositions and described in more detail in Table I below were formulated generally in accordance wife fee following protocol<br><br>
Into a suitably sized vessel, a measured amount of water was provided at a temperature of between about 5°C-30°C and under stirring using a laboratory scale, homogenizer device, the thickener constituents were first added, and homogenization was permitted to continue for about 30 - 90 minutes until the thickened mixture became homogenous. The thickened mixture was then removed from the homogenizer device and introduced into a laboratory beaker provided a motor driven propeller as a stirrer. Thereafter under constant uniform stirring the remaining constituents were added in the following sequence: surfactants, organic solvent (when present), acid, caustic (sodium hydroxide) and then the remaining constituents, with the suspended inclusions, e.g^ alginate beads in a slurry being added as the last constituent Thereafter toe remaming amount of water needed to provide 100%wt of the composition. Mixing of the constituents in the laboratory beaker took from about 30 - 90 minutes, and the total time of mixing generally lasted from about 60 minutes to about 180 minutes. In each case, mixing was maintained until me particular composition appeared to be homogeneous, and the suspended inclusions well dispersed. The exemplary compositions were pourable, readily pumpable using a manually operable trigger spray apparatus and retained exceptionally well mixed characteristics (ie., stable mixtures) upon standing. Notwithstanding the above preferred protocol, other sequences of mixing and orders of addition of the constituents may be practiced.<br>
Examples of inventive formulations are shown in Table 1 below (unless otherwise stated, the components indicated are provided as "100% active") wherein me amounts of the named constituents are indicated in %w/w. Deionized water was added in "quantum sufficient" to provide the balance to 100 parts by weight of the compositions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
performed at various time intervals following initial production of the test sample, under different storage temperatures, namely at "room temperature* (approx. 68°F (20°C), 40°F, 105°F and 120°F). The storage at higher temperatures was intended to simulate the effects of storage at normal conditions, i.e., room temperature for a period of 6 months or more which is the expected shelf life of a commercial product produced based on a tested formulation.<br><br><br><br>
As is evident from the test results reported on Table 3, the representative composition according to the invention exhibited excellent storage stability characteristics even under elevated temperatures.<br>
Evaluation of spravabilitv:<br>
A quantity of a sample composition was placed into the interior of a non-pressurized bottle to which was affixed a manually operable "Specialty Trigger Pump Spray/Off' (ex. Owens-Illinois Coip.) trigger spray device. A vertical glass panel was used with the device to evaluate the sprayability characteristics of a sample composition. At varying distances from as little as 4 inches to as for as 24 inches, a composition was dispensed from the trigger spray device which was held perpendicularly to the vertical glass panel The delivery of the composition from the trigger spray device, and the wetting characteristics of the composition were observed and evaluated To be considered a "pass" the composition need be dispensed in a generally uniform spray from the trigger spray device within the range of 4 - 24 inches, and especially at about 18 from the vertical glass panel, and to generally even wet out the surface and not form a preponderance of beads or droplets which clung to the vertical glass panel without dispersing after contact<br>
Each of the formulations according to the invention described on Table 1 were considered to "pass" the spray test described above.<br><br>
The efficacy of inventive compositions in removing soap scum from a hard surface was evaluated in accordance with CSMA Methods DCC-16 (May 1995) titled "Guidelines for Evaluating the Efficacy of Bathroom Cleaners - Part 2: Scrubber Test for Measuring the Removal of lime Soap". This test is described generally as follows:<br>
First, a "parent" soil is made, based on the following formulation:<br><br><br>
The parent soil was produced according to the following steps: First, the bar soap was shaved into a suitable beaker. Afterward the remaining constituents were added in the order given above and stirred with three-blade propeller mixer. Next, the contents of the beaker was heated to 45-50°C and mixed until a smooth, lump-free suspension was achieved. This usually required about two hourewith moderate agitation. Subsequently, the contents of the beaker were filtered through a Buchner funnel fitted with Whatman #1 filter paper or equivalent The filtrate was then resuspended in clean, deionized water, using the same amount ofwater used to make the soil, and this was filtered again. The (re-filtered) filtrate was uniformly dried overnight at 45°C to form a filter cake. Thereafter, the filter cake was pulverized and was suitable for immediate use, or may be stored in a sealed container for up to six months.<br>
The test substrates (tiles) were prepared in 1he following manner: each tile was thoroughly washed (using a commercially available hand dishwashing detergent such as, Dove®) and scrubbed using a non-metallic scouring pad (such as a Chore Boy® Long Last scrubbing sponge). The washed tiles were then permitted to dry in an oven at 40.5°C overnight, then withdrawn and allowed to cool to room temperature (approx. 20°C) before being provided with the standardized "hard water" test soiL It is to be noted that for each test, new tiles were utilized, namely, the tiles were not reused. In preparation for supplying the tiles with an amount of the test soiL a test soil was<br><br>
The test soil was produced according to the following steps: The constituents indicated<br>
were introduced into a clean beaker, with the acetone being added prior to the water, and<br>
the 'parent' soil being added last The contents of the beaker were mixed using a<br>
standard three blade laboratory mixer until the contents formed a uniform mixture, arid<br>
the color changed from white to gray. This typically required 20-40 minutes, during<br>
which time the beaker was covered as much as possible to avoid excessive solvent loss.<br>
Next, a suitable quantity of the contents of the test soil from the beaker was provided to<br>
an artist's airbrush while the beaker was swirled to ensure	(Iftesting<br>
required more than one day, a fresh amount of test soil was prepared daily and used for that day's testing.)<br>
Soil was applied to a number of clean, dry tiles placed into rows and columns in preparation for depositing of the test soiL The airbrush was operated at 40 psi, and the<br>
*<br>
test soil was sprayed to provide a visually uniform amount of soil onto the tiles. (Uniform soil suspension during application was maintained by continuous brush motion and/or swirling of test soil in the airbrush,) in this manner, approximately 0.10g-0.15g test soil were applied per tile.<br>
The tiles were then allowed to air dry for approximately 30 minutes, during which time the a laboratory hotplate was preheated to approximately 320°C. Each tile was sequentially placed on the hotplate until the test soil began to melt, thereby "aging" the test soil. The melting of die test soil was observed carefully, and each tile was removed shortly before the soil began to coalesce into large droplets. This process was repeated for each tile, allowing the hotplate to recover to 320°C between tiles. Subsequently each tile was permitted to cool for at least about 30 minutes.<br>
To evaluate cleaning, a treated test tile was placed in a Gardner Apparatus and secured. A dry 10 ran by 7.6 cm sponge was first moistened with 100 g of tap water, and the excess wrung out from the sponge. The sponge was then fitted into a suitably sized holder in the Gardner Apparatus. A 4-5 gimn aliquot of a test formulation was then deposited directly onto the soiled surface of a tile, and allowed to contact the tile for 15 seconds. Thereafter, the Gardner Apparatus was cycled for from 3 - 6 strokes. The tile was then rinsed with tap water, and dried with compressed air from an airbrush<br><br>
compressor. This test was repeated several times for each formulation, using anew treated test tile for each evaluation.<br>
The tested tiles were evaluated by either reflective means, i.e., using a Minolta Chromameter in order to determine the change in reflectance between an unsoiled, untreated tile which was used as a "control", and the reflectance of a soiled tile which was cleaned using a quantity of an inventive composition in accordance with the test protocol described above* According to the reflective means, the percentage of hard water soil removal was determined utilizing the following equation:<br>
where <br>
RC =   Reflectance of tile after cleaning with test product<br>
RO =   Reflectance of original soiled tile<br>
RS -   Reflectance of soiled tile<br>
For each tile, a number of readings were taken and the results averaged to provide a median reading for each tile. Six tiles were used to evaluate each of the tested compositions and the average reading for each tile, as well as the averaged reflectance reading for all five tiles treated using a particular composition described in Table 1 are reproduced below. The tested tiles were evaluated, and the results of the calculated "% removal" are indicated on the Table 3, below. Additionally two comparative formulations, of presently available commercial products Tantastik" (ex* SC Johnson &amp; Son) and "Formula 409" (ex. Clorox) used, as supplied in their trigger-spray bottles, were tested under identical conditions to provide a comparison as to the soil cleaning efficacy of the formulations according to the invention.<br><br><br>
As can be seen from the foregoing the compositions according to the invention provided good cleaning results similar to the commercial products.<br>
Evaluation of ANtimicrobia; Efficacy<br>
Aliquots of the formulation according to Example 7 described in more detail on Table 1 was evaluated in order to evaluate its antimicrobial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus (gram positive type pathogenic bacteria) (ATCC 6538), Salmonella choleraesuis (gram negative type pathogenic bacteria) (ATCC 10708), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442). The testing was performed in accordance with the protocols outlined in AOAC Official Method 961.02 "Germicidal Spray Products as Disinfectants", as described in AOAC Official Methods of Analysis, 16th Ed., (1995).<br>
As is appreciated by the skilled practitioner in the art, the results of the AOAC Germicidal Spray Test indicates the number of test substrates wherein me tested organism remains viable after contact for 10 minutes with a test disinfecting composition / total number of tested substrates (slides) evaluated in accordance with the AOAC Germicidal Spray Test Thus, a result of "0/10" indicates that of 10 test substrates bearing the test organism and contacted for 10 minutes in a test disinfecting composition, 0 test substrates had viable (live) test organisms at the conclusion of the test Such a result is excellent, illustrating the excellent disinfecting efficacy of the tested composition.<br>
Results of the testing are indicated on the Table, below. The reported results indicate the number of test cylinders with live test organisms/number of test cylinders tested for each example formulation and organism tested.<br><br><br>
As may be seen from the results indicated above, the compositions according to the invention provide excellent cleaning benefits to hard surfaces, including hard surfaces with difficult to remove stains. These advantages are further supplemented by the excellent antimicrobial efficacy of these compositions against known bacteria commonly found in bathroom, kitchen and other environments. Such advantages clearly illustrate the superior characteristics of the compositions, the cleaning and antimicrobial benefits attending its use which is not before known to the art<br><br><br>
