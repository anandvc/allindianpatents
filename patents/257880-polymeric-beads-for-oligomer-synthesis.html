POLYMERIC BEADS FOR OLIGOMER SYNTHESIS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[1] The present invention relates to solid support media for use in oligomer synthesis, to methods of producing the media, and to methods of using the media.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[2] Solid state synthesis is applicable to the preparation of a wide variety of polymeric compounds such as nucleobase-containing polymers (for example oligonucleotides and their analogs), amino acid containing polymers (for example proteins, peptides, and their analogs). Solid state synthesis also is applicable to the preparation of compounds by combinatorial methods.<br>
[3] Oligonucleotides have been used in various biological and biochemical applications. They have been used as primers and probes for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as antisense agents used in target validation, drug discovery and development, as ribozymes, as aptamers, and as general stimulators of the immune system. As .the popularity of oligonucleotides has increased, the need for producing greater sized batches, and greater numbers of small-sized batches, has increased at pace. Additionally, there has been an increasing emphasis on reducing the costs of oligonucleotide synthesis, and on improving the purity and increasing the yield of oligonucleotide products.<br>
[4] A number of innovations have been introduced to the art of oligonucleotide synthesis. Amongst these innovations has been the development of excellent orthogonal protecting groups, activators, reagents, and synthetic conditions. The oligonucleotides themselves have been subject to a variety of modifications and improvements. Amongst these are chemistries that improve the affinity of an oligonucleotide for a specific target, that improve the stability of an oligonucleotide in vivo, that enhance the phaimacokinetic (PK) and toxicological (Tox) properties of an oligonucleotide, etc. These novel chemistries generally involve a chemical modification to one or more of the constituent parts of the oligonucleotide.<br>
[5] The term "oligonucleotide" thus embraces a class of compounds that include naturally-occurring, as well as modified, oligonucleotides.   Both naturally-occurring and<br><br>
modified oligomicleotides have proven useful in a variety of settings, and both may be made by similar processes, with appropriate modifications made to account for the specific modifications adopted. A naturally occurring oligonucleotide, i.e. a short strand of DNA or RNA may be envisioned as being a member of the following generic formulas, denominated oligo-RNA and oligo-DNA, respectively, below:<br><br>
wherein m is an integer of from 1 to about 100, and Bx is one of the naturally occurring nucleobases.<br>
[6] Physiologic pH, an oligonucleotide occurs as the anion, as the phosphate easily dissociates at neutral pH, and an oligonucleotide will generally occur in solid phase, whether amorphous or crystalline, as a salt Thus, unless otherwise modified, the term "oligonucleotide" encompasses each of the anionic, salt and free acid forms above.<br>
[7] In essence, a naturally occurring oligonucleotide may be thought of as being an oligomer of m monomeric subunits represented by the following nucleotides:<br><br><br>
wherein each Bx is a nucleobase, wherein the last residue is a nucleoside (i.e. a nucleotide without the 3'-phosphate group).<br>
[8J As mentioned above, various chemistry modifications have been made to oligonucleotides, in order to improve their affinity, stability, PK, Tox, and other properties. In general, the term oligonucleotide, as now used in the art, encompasses inter alia compounds of the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein m is an integer from 1 to about 100, each Gi is O or S, each G2 is OH or SH, each G3 is Os S, CH2, or NH, each G5 is a divalent moiety such as O, S, CH2, CFH, CF2, -CH=CH-, etc., each R2' is H, OH, O-rg, wherein rg is a removable protecting group, a 2*-substituent, or together with R4' forms a bridge, each R3' is H, a substituent, or together with IV forms a bridge, each IV is H, a substituent, together with R2S forms a bridge, together with R3» forms a bridge, or together with R5' forms a bridge, each q is 0 or 1, each R5' is H, a substituent, or together with R4' forms a bridge, each G6 is O&gt; S, CH2 or NH, and each G7 is H, PO3H2, or a conjugate group, and each Bx is a nucleobase, as described herein (i.e. naturally occurring or modified).<br>
[9] The standard synthetic methods for oligonucleotides include the solid phase methods first described by Caruthers et al. (See, for example, US Patent No. 5,750,666, incorporated herein by reference, especially columns 3-58, wherein starting materials and general methods of making oligonucleotides, and especially phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, are disclosed, which parts are specifically incorporated herein by reference.) These methods were later improved upon by K6ster et al. (See, for example, US Patent No. RE 34,069, which is incorporated herein by reference, especially columns, wherein are disclosed, which parts are specifically incorporated herein by reference.) These methods have further been improved upon by various inventors, as discussed in more detail below. Methods of synthesizing RNA are disclosed in, inter alia, US Patent Nos. 6,111,086, 6,008,400, and 5,889,136, each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Especially relevant are columns 7-20 of US 6,008,400, which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[10] The general process for manufacture of an oligonucleotide by the Koster et al. method may be described as follows:<br>
[11] First, a synthesis support is prepared by covalently linking a suitable nucleoside to a solid support medium (SS) through a linker. Such a synthesis support is as follows:<br><br><br>
wherein SS is the solid support medium, LL is a linking group that links the nucleoside to the support via G3. The linking group is generally a di-fimctional group, which covalentiy binds the ultimate 3'-nucleoside (and thus the nascent oligonucleotide) to the solid support medium during synthesis, but which is cleaved under conditions orthogonal to the conditions under which the 5?-protecting group, and if applicable any 25-protecting group, are removed. V is a removable protecting group, and the remaining variables have already been defined, and are described in more detail herein. Suitable synthesis supports may be acquired from Amersham Biosciences under the brand name Primer Support 200™. The solid support medium having the synthesis support attached thereto may then be swelled in a suitable solvent, e.g. acetonitrile, and introduced into a column of a suitable solid phase synthesis instrument, such as one of the synthesizers available form Amersham Biosciences, such as an AKTAoligopilot™, or OligoProcess™ brand DNA/RNA synthesizer.<br>
[12] In the foregoing method, synthesis is carried out from 3'- to 5'-end of the oligomer. In each cycle, the following steps are carried out: (1) removal of T', (2) coupling, (3) oxidation, (4) capping. Each of the steps (l)-(4) may be, and generally is, followed by one or more wash steps, whereby a clean solvent is introduced to tiiie column to wash soluble materials from the column, push reagents and/or activators through the column, or both. The steps (l)-(4) are depicted below:<br><br><br>
[13] In general, T is selected to be removable under conditions orthogonal to those used to cleave the oligonucleotide from the solid support medium at the end of synthesis, as well as those used to remove other protecting groups used during synthesis. An art-recognized protecting group for oligonucleotide synthesis is DMT (4,4'-dimethoxytrityI), The DMT group is especially useful as it is removable under weakly acid conditions. Thus, an acceptable removal reagent is 3% DCA in a suitable solvent, such as acetonitrile. The wash solvent, if used, may conveniently be acetonitrile.<br>
[14] The support typically is a controlled pore glass or a polymeric bead support Some polymeric supports are disclosed in the following patents: US 6,016,895; US 6,043,353; US 5,391,667 and US 6,300,486, each of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[15] After removal of protecting group T\ the next step of the synthetic cycle is the coupling of the next nucleoside synthon. This is accomplished by reacting the deprotected support bound nucleoside with a nucleoside phosphoramidite, in the presence of an activator, as shown below:<br><br><br>
wherein pg is a phosphorus protecting group, such as a cyanoethyl group, and NRNIRTO is an amine leaving group, such as diisopropyl amino. See, K6ster et al., supra, for information on manufacturing of the amidite. Typically used activators include for example tetrazoles dicyano imidazole, or pyridinium salts. Other suitable amidites, and methods of manufacturing amidites, are set forth in the following patents: US 6,133,438; US 5,646,265; US 6,124,450; US 5,847,106; US 6,001,982; US 5,705,621; US 5,955,600; US 6,160,152; US 6,335,439; US 6,274,725; US 6,329,519, each of which is specifically incorporated herein by<br><br>
reference, especially as they relate to manufacture of amidites. Suitable activators are set forth in the Caruther et al. patent and in the K6ster et al. patent. Especially suitable activators are set forth in the following patents: US 6,031,092 and US 6,476,216, each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[17] The next step of the synthesis cycle is oxidation, which indicates that the P(m) species is oxidized to a P(V) oxidation state with a suitable oxidant:<br><br>
wherein Gi is O or S.<br>
[18] The oxidant is an oxidizing agent suitable for introducing Gu In the case where Gi is oxygen, a suitable oxidant is set forth in the Caruthers et al. patent, above. In cases where G2 is sulfur, the oxidant may also be referred to as a thiation agent or a sulfur-transfer reagent Suitable thiation agents include the so-called Beaucage reagent, 3H-l,2-benzothiols phenylacetyl disulfide (also referred to as PADS; see, for example the patents: US 6,114,519 and 6,242,591, each of which is incorporated herein by reference) and thiouram disulfides (e.g. N,N^f',N'-tetramethylthiouram disulfide, disclosed by US patent No. 5,166,387). The wash may be a suitable solvent, such as acetonitrile.<br>
[19] The oxidation step is followed by a capping step, which although not illustrated herein, is an important step for synthesis, as it causes free 5'-OH groups, which did not<br><br>
undergo coupling in step 1, to be blocked from being coupled in subsequent synthetic cycles. Suitable capping reagents are set forth in Caruthers et al., KSster et al., and other patents described herein. Suitable capping reagents include a combination of acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole.<br>
[20] Synthetic cycle steps (l)-(4) are repeated (if so desired) n-1 times to produce a support-bound oligonucleotide:<br><br>
wherein each of the variables is as herein defined.<br>
[21] In general, the protecting group pg may be removed by a method as described by Caruthers et al. or Koster et al., supra. Where pg is a cyanoethyl group, the methodology of Koster et al., e.g. reaction with a basic solution, is generally suitable for removal of the phosphorus protecting group. In some cases it is desirable to avoid formation of adducts such as the Nl-cyanoethyl thymidine group. In these cases, it is desirable to include in the reagent a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine (TEA) as taught in US Patent No. US 6,465,628, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. In general, where the nucleobases are protected, they are deprotected under basic conditions. The deprotected oligonucleotide is cleaved from the support to give the following 5'-protected oligonucleotide:<br><br><br>
, which may then be purified by reverse phase liquid chromatography, deprotected at the 5 s-end in acetic acid, desalted, lyophilized or otherwise dried, and stored in an inert atmosphere until needed. Optionally, the G3H group may be derivatized with a conjugate group. The resulting oligonucleotide may be visualized as having the formula:<br><br>
[22] While synthesis on a solid phase support medium is known, there is a need for a solid support medium that has improved properties, especially with respect to loading (expressed in mmol of first nucleoside bound to the solid support medium per gram of solid support medium, or simply mmol/g), consistent swelling properties during the various synthesis cycles, and quality of foil length oligomer produced during synthesis.   Additionally, the<br><br>
support should be facile to manufacture. This invention is directed to these, as well as other, important ends.<br>

The polymeric bead supports of the present invention are amenable to the preparation of any of the wide variety of monomeric and oligomeric molecules that are synthesized by combinatorial methods. It is now widely appreciated that combinatorial libraries are useful perse and that such libraries and compounds comprising them have great commercial importance. Indeed, a branch of chemistry has developed to exploit the many commercial aspects of combinatorial libraries.  In order to maximize the advantages of each classical combinatorial approach, new strategies for combinatorial deconvolution have been developed independently by several groups. Selection techniques have been used with libraries of peptides (Geysen et al, J. Imnaau Meth., 1987,102, 259; Houghten et al, Nature, 1991, 354, 84; Owens et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1991,181,402; Doyle, PCT WO 94/28424; Brennan, PCT WO 94/27719); nucleic acids (Wyatt et al, Proc. Nail Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1994,91, 1356; Ecker et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 1993,21, 1853); nonpeptides and small molecules (Simon et aL, Proc. Nail Acad. Sci. USA,, 1992, 89, 9367; Zuckermann et al.9 J. Am, Chem. Soc, 1992,114,10646; Barftett et al, WO 91/19735; Ohlmeyer et ah, Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. U.S.A, 1993, 90,10922; DeWitt et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1993,90, 6909; Cody et al, United States patent 5,324,483; Houghten et al, PCT WO 94/26775; EUman, United States patent 5,288,514; Still et al, WO 94/08051; Kauf&amp;nan et al., PCT WO 94/24314; Carell et al,Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl, 1994,33, 2059; Carell et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engel, 1994,33,2061; Lebl et al, WO 94/28028). Each of the preceding is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. A review of the above references reveals that the most advanced of these techniques are those for the selection of peptides and nucleic acids.<br>
The majority of the techniques reported to date involve iterative synthesis and screening of increasingly simplified subsets of oligomers such as peptides and oligonucleotides. Monomers or sub-monomers that have been utilized include amino acids, amino acid-like molecules, i.e. carbamate precursors, and nucleotides, both of which are bifunctional. Utilizing these techniques, libraries have been assayed for activity in either cell-based assays, or for binding and/or inhibition of purified protein targets.<br>
Some combinatorial approaches utilize a multifunctional scaffold bearing multiple diversity sites, and derivatizing these sites with varied building blocks to form libraries of diverse small molecule compounds. Libraries may be generated such that each individual compound may be synthesized and isolated separately, or synthesized and used as a mixture<br><br>
of several desirable compounds. A mixture of compounds may be obtained by using a mixture of scaffolds and/or building blocks.<br>
The diversity of a combinatorial library is represented by the inherent physical and chemical properties of each scaffold and building block used, the number of different building blocks used during each derivatization step, the physical and chemical properties of the bonds arising from the derivatization chemistry, and the interactions of the scaffold and building block chemistries. Taken together, these interactions provide a unique conformation for each individual compound in the combinatorial library.<br>
The polymeric bead supports of the present invention are amenable to the preparation of any of the wide variety of monomeric and oligomeric molecules that are synthesized by such combinatorial methods. These include conventional small molecule drugs, and larger species such as oligomeric peptidomimetics, peptoids, and nucleotides, as well as oligomeric molecules derived from other preorganized or rigid scaffolds.<br>
For example, acids, amines and amino acids are classes of building blocks that have been recognised to be of tremendous utility in combinatorial chemistry because of their reactivity with a variety of functional groups and the availability of large numbers of such compounds of diverse structures from commercial sources. Amino acids, for example, have been extensively used in the synthesis of small molecule combinatorial libraries. The use of amino acids as key building blocks in the construction of substituted heterocycle libraries has been practiced by several groups for exploring known pharmacophores, in cyclic ureas and in 'prospecting libraries' (Bunin and Ellman, J. Am. Chem. Soc.t 1992,114,10997; DeWitt et aLt Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 1993, 90, 6909; Nefiri, et alt Tetrahedron Lett, 1997, 38, 931; Bartlett, et al, Book of Abstracts, 213th American Cliemical Society Natiofial Meeting, San Francisco, 1997, American Chemical Society, Washington D.C., ORGN-273).<br>
In some combinatorial procedures, the scaffold possess a plurality of masked (i.e., protected) functional groups (diversity sites). All the diversity sites are protected or masked in such a fashion that the protection and deprotection schemes are orthogonal in nature, ue. one may be deprotected selectively without affecting the integrity of any of the other masking groups. This, allows for selective functionalization of individual diversity sites as the scaffolds are attached or constructed during synthesis of the oligomeric or monomeric compounds. Alternatively, this also allows for the simultaneous reaction of multiple diversity sites, if so desired.<br><br>
The diversity sites may be combinatorialized with diverse building blocks. Sites that axe available for combinatorializing include the reactive amino and hydroxy groups. Derivatization of scaffolds at diversity sites is achieved using a variety of building blocks that include, but are not limited to, carboxylic acids, acid halides, anhydrides, sulfonic acids, sulfonyl halides, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, ketones, aldehydes, amines, and amino acids.<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides for the addition of functional groups onto a monocyclic or bicyclic scaffold which is attached to a solid support of the invention. The preparation of the combinatorial libraries begins with a monocyclic or bicyclic scaffold attached to the solid support directly, or through a linker stable to the synthesis conditions, but cleavable to release the compound into solution at the end of the synthesis. Preferred linkers include esters, particularly those derived from succinic acid. Alternatively, the scaffolds can be coupled to a constant moiety attached to the support, such as DMT, ethylene glycol or a similar diol.<br>
The scaffolds can be uniform, or a structurally diverse set of monocyclic and/or bicyclic ring systems which give different relative orientations of the functional groups and the pendant, diverse substituents. Additional combinatorial sites may be present on the scaffolds in the form of protected hydroxy or amino groups or other masked functional groups which may be selectively reacted with building blocks when desired.<br>
The scaffolds and building blocks used in the combinatorial library bear varied functional groups which, taken together, provide diverse properties ("diversity") to the resulting library members. These functional groups include hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, ionic moieties, polar moieties, hydrophobic moieties, aromatic centers, and electron-donors and acceptors. Together, the properties of the individual scaffolds and building blocks contribute to the uniqueness of the individual compounds in which they are found. Thus, a library of such compounds would have a myriad of properties, i.e.9 "diversity.11 Collectively, the properties of the individual scaffold and building blocks, which together form an individual library compound, contribute to the uniqueness of the compound and impart certain characteristics thereto for interaction with cellular, enzymatic or nucleic acid target sites.<br>
[43] As used herein, the term oligonucleotide has the meaning of an oligomer having m subunits embraced within the brackets [ ] of the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein the other variables are defined above, and are described in more detail hereinafter. It is to be understood that, although the oligonucleotide to be made is depicted in a single stranded conformation, it is common for oligonucleotides to be used in a double stranded conformation. For example, in the antisense method referred-to commonly as siRNA, two strands of RNA or RNA-like oligonucleotide are prepared and annealed together, often with a two-nucleotide overlap at the ends. Thus, the present invention contemplates manufacture of both single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides.<br>
Nucleobases<br>
[44] The nucleobases Bx may be the same or different, and include naturally occurring nucleobases adenine (A), guanine (G), tbymine (T), uracil (U) and cytosine (C), as well as modified nucleobases. Modified nucleobases include heterocyclic moieties that are structurally related to the naturally-occurring nucleobases, but which have been chemically modified to impart some property to the modified nucleobase that is not possessed by naturally-occurring nucleobases. The term "nucleobase," as used herein, is intended to by synonymous with "nucleic acid base or mimetic thereof." In general, a nucleobase is any substructure that contains one or more atoms or groups of atoms capable of hydrogen bonding to a base of an oligonucleotide.<br>
[45] As used herein, "unmodified" or "natural" nucleobases include the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases thymine (T), cytosine (C) and uracil (U).    Modified nucleobases include other synthetic and natural nucleobases such as 5-<br><br>

[50] In some embodiments of the invention, oligomeric compounds, e.g. oligonucleotides, axe prepared having polycyclic heterocyclic compounds in place of one or more heterocyclic base moieties. A number of tricyclic heterocyclic compounds have been previously reported. These compounds are routinely used in antisense applications to increase the binding properties of the modified strand to a target strand. The most studied modifications are targeted to guanosines hence they have been termed G-clamps or cytidine analogs. Many of these polycyclic heterocyclic compounds have the general formula:<br><br>
[51] Representative cytosine analogs that make 3 hydrogen bonds with a guanosine in a second strand include l,3-diazaphenoxazine-2-one (Rio« O, Rn - R-i4= H) [Kurchavov, et aL, Nucleosides andNucleotides, 1997', 16, 1837-1846], l,3-diazaphenothiazine-2-one (Rio= S, Rn - Ri4= H), [Lin, K.-Y.; Jones, R. J.; Matteucci, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 3873-3874] and 6,7,8,9-tetrafluoro-l,3-diazapbenoxazine-2-one (Rio = O, Rn - R14 - F) [Wang, J.; Lin, KL-Y., Matteucci, M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 8385-8388]. Incorporated into oligonucleotides these base modifications were shown to hybridize with complementary guanine and the latter was also shown to hybridize with adenine and to enhance helical thermal stability by extended stacking interactions (also see U.S. Patent Application entitled "Modified Peptide Nucleic Acids" filed May 24, 2002, Serial number 10/155,920; and U.S. Patent Application entitled "Nuclease Resistant Chimeric Oligonucleotides" filed May 24, 2002, Serial number 10/013,295, both of which are commonly owned with this application and are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).<br>
[52] Further helix-stabilizing properties have been observed when a cytosine analog/substitute has an aminoethoxy moiety attached to the rigid l,3-diazaphenoxazine-2-<br><br>
one scaffold (Ri0 ~ 0, Rn = -O-(CH2)2-NH2, Ri2-i4=H ) [Lin, K.-Y.; Matteucci, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998,120, 8531-8532]. Binding studies demonstrated that a single incorporation could enhance the binding affinity of a model oligonucleotide to its complementary target DNA or KNA with a ATm of up to 18° relative to 5-methyl cytosine (dC5me)s which is the highest known affinity enhancement for a single modification, yet On the other hand, the gain in helical stability does not compromise the specificity of the oligonucleotides. The Tm data indicate an even greater discrimination between the perfect match and mismatched sequences compared to dC5me. It was suggested that the tethered amino group serves as an additional hydrogen bond donor to interact with the Hoogsteen face, namely the 06, of a complementary guanine thereby forming 4 hydrogen bonds. This means that the increased affinity of G-clamp is mediated by the combination of extended base stacking and additional specific hydrogen bonding.<br>
[53] Further tricyclic heterocyclic compounds and methods of using them that axe amenable to the present invention are disclosed in United States Patent Serial Number 6,028,183, which issued on May 22, 2000, and United States Patent Serial Number 6,007,992, which issued on December 28, 1999, the contents of both axe commonly assigned with this application and are incorporated herein in their entirety. Such compounds include those having the formula: <br>
[54] Wherein Rn includes (CH3)2N-(CH2)2-Os H2N-(CH2)3S Ph-CH2-O-C(=O)-N(H)-(CH2)3S H2N-; Fluorenyl-CH2-O-C(=O).N(H)-(CH2)3-; Phthalimidyl-CH2-O-C(=O)-N(H)-(CH2)3-; Ph-CH2-O-C(=O)-N(H)-(CH2)2-O-; Ph.CH2-0-C(O)-N(H)»(CH2)3-0s (CH3)2N-N(H&gt;(CH2)2-O-; Fluorenyl-CH2-O-C(=O)-N(H)-(C3I2)2.O-; Fluorenyl-CH2-O-C(=O)-N(H)-(CH2)3-O-; H2N-(CH2)2-O-CH2-; N3-(CH2)2-O-CH2-; H2N-(CH2)2-O-, and NH2C(=NH)NH-.<br>
[55]     Also disclosed are tricyclic heterocyclic compounds of the formula:<br><br><br>

where Re is independently -CH=5 -N=s -C(Ci-8 alkyl)= or -C(halogen)=9 but no adjacent Rb are both -N=.<br>
[56] The enhanced binding affinity of the phenoxazine derivatives together with their uncompromised sequence specificity makes them valuable nucleobase analogs for the development of more potent antisense-based drugs. In fact, promising data have been derived from in vitro experiments demonstrating that heptanucleotides containing phenoxazine substitutions are capable to activate RNaseH, enhance cellular uptake and exhibit an increased antisense activity [Lin, K.-Y.; Matteucci, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, 8531-8532]. The activity enhancement was even more pronounced in case of G-clamp, as a single substitution was shown to significantly improve the in vitro potency of a 20mer 2'-deoxyphosphorothioate oligonucleotides [Flanagan, W. M.; Wolf, J.J.; Olson, P.; Grant, D.; lin, K.-Y.; Wagner, R. W.; Matteucci, M. Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. USA, 1999, 96, 3513-3518]. Nevertheless, to optimize oligonucleotide design and to better understand the impact of these heterocyclic modifications on the biological activity, it is important to evaluate their effect on the nuclease stability of the oligomers.<br>

[70] Representative guanidino substituent groups that are shown in formula HE and IV are disclosed in co-owned United States Patent Application 09/349,040, entitled "Functionalized Oligomers", filed July 7,1999, issue fee paid on 10/23/2002.<br>
[71] Representative acetamido substituent groups are disclosed in United States Patent 6,147,200 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Representative dimethylaminoethyloxyethyl substituent groups are disclosed in International Patent Application PCT/US99/17895, entitled I!2!-O-Dime%laminoethyloxyethyl-Modified Oligonucleotides11, filed August 6, 1999, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to either the 2\ 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound. The respective ends of this linear polymeric structure can be joined to form a circular structure by hybridization or by formation of a covalent bond, however, open linear structures are generally preferred. Within the oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the internucleoside linkages of the oligonucleotide. The normal internucleoside linkage of KNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester linkage.<br>
[72] While the present invention may be adapted to produce oligonucleotides for any desired end use (e.g. as probes for us in the polymerase chain reaction), one preferred use of the oligonucleotides is in antisense therapeutics. One mode of action that is often employed in antisense therapeutics is the so-called RNAse H mechanism, whereby a strand of DNA is introduced into a cell, where the DNA hybridizes to a strand of RNA- The DNA-RNA hybrid is recognized by an endonuclease, RNAse H, which cleaves the RNA strand. In normal cases, the RNA strand is messenger RNA (mRNA), which, after it has been cleaved, cannot be translated into the corresponding peptide or protein sequence in the ribosomes. In this way, DNA may be employed as an agent for modulating the expression of certain genes.<br>
[73] It has been found that by incorporating short stretches of DNA into an oligonucleotide, the RNAse H mechanism can be effectively used to modulate expression of target peptides or proteins. In some embodiments of the invention, an oligonucleotide incorporating a stretch of DNA and a stretch of RNA or 2'-modified RNA can be used to<br><br>
effectively modulate gene expression. In preferred embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises a stretch of DNA flanked by two stretches of 2'-modified RNA. Preferred 2'-modifications include 25-MOE as described herein.<br>
[74] The ribosyl sugar moiety has also been extensively studied to evaluate the effect its modification has on the properties of oligonucleotides relative to unmodified oligonucleotides. The 2'-position of the sugar moiety is one of the most studied sites for modification. Certain 2'-substituent groups have been shown to increase the lipohpilicity and enhance properties such as binding affinity to target RNA, chemical stability and nuclease resistance of oligonucleotides. Many of the modifications at the 2'-position that show enhanced binding affinity also force the sugar ring into the C3-endo conformation.<br>

[76] DNA:RNA hybrid duplexes, however, are usually less stable than pure RNA:RNA duplexes, and depending on their sequence may be either more or less stable than DNA:DNA duplexes (Searle et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1993, 21, 2051-2056). The structure of a hybrid duplex is intermediate between A- and B-fonn geometries, which may result in poor stacking interactions (Lane et al, Eur. J. Biochem., 1993, 215, 297-306; Fedoroff et aly J. Mot Biol, 1993, 233, 509-523; Gonzalez et al, Biochemistry, 1995, 34, 4969-4982; Horton et al, J. Mot Biol, 1996, 264, 521-533). The stability of a DNA:RNA hybrid is central to antisense therapies as the mechanism requires the binding of a modified DNA strand to a mRNA strand. To effectively inhibit the mRNA, the antisense DNA should have a very high binding<br><br>
affinity with the mRNA. Otherwise the desired interaction between the DNA and target mRNA strand will occur infrequently, thereby decreasing the efficacy of the antisense oligonucleotide.<br>
[77] Various synthetic modifications have been proposed to increase nuclease resistance, or to enhance the affinity of the antisense strand for its target mRNA (Crooke et aL, MedL Res. Rev., 1996,16, 319-344; De Mesmaeker et aL, Ace. Chem. Res., 1995, 28, 366-374). A variety of modified phosphorus-containing linkages have been studied as replacements for the natural, readily cleaved phosphodiester linkage in oligonucleotides. In general, most of them, such as the phosphofothioate, phosphoramidates, phosphonates and phosphorodithioates all result in oligonucleotides with reduced binding to complementary targets and decreased hybrid stability.<br>
[78] RNA exists in what has been termed "A Form" geometry while DNA exists in "B ' Form" geometry. In general, RNA:RNA duplexes are more stable, or have higher melting temperatures (Tm) than DNA:DNA duplexes (Sanger et aL, Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, 1984, Springer-Verlag; New York, NY.; Lesnik et aL, Biochemistry, 1995, 34, 10807-10815; Conte et alf Nucleic Acids Res., 1997,25, 2627-2634). The increased stability of KNA has been attributed to several structural features, most notably the improved base stacking interactions that result from an A-fonn geometry (Searle et aL, Nucleic Acids Res., 1993, 21, 2051-2056). The presence of the 2= hydroxyl in RNA biases the sugar toward a C3= endo pucker, i.e., also designated as Northern pucker, which causes the duplex to favor the A-form geometry. On the other hand, deoxy nucleic acids prefer a C2! endo sugar pucker, i.e., also known as Southern pucker, which is thought to impart a less stable B-form geometry (Sanger, W. (1984) Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY). In addition, the 2= hydroxyl groups of RNA can form a network of water mediated hydrogen bonds that help stabilize the RNA duplex (Egli et aL, Biochemistry, 1996, 35, 8489-8494).<br>
[79] DNA:RNA hybrid duplexes, however, are usually less stable than pure RNA:RNA duplexes and, depending on their sequence, may be either more or less stable than DNA:DNA duplexes (Searle et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 1993, 21, 2051-2056). The structure of a hybrid duplex is intermediate between A- and B-form geometries, which may result in poor stacking interactions (Lane et al} Eur. J. Biochem., 1993, 215, 297-306; Fedoroff et aL, J, Mol BioL, 1993, 233, 509-523; Gonzalez et aL, Biochemistry, 1995, 34, 4969-4982; Horton et aL, J. Mol. BioL, 1996, 264, 521-533). The stability of a DNA:RNA hybrid a significant aspect of antisense therapies, as the proposed mechanism requires the binding of a<br><br>
modified DNA strand to a mRNA strand. Ideally, the antisense DNA should have a very high binding affinity with the mRNA. Otherwise, the desired interaction between the DNA and target mRNA strand will occur infrequently, thereby decreasing the efficacy of the antisense oligonucleotide.<br>
[80] One synthetic 2-modification that imparts increased nuclease resistance and a very high binding affinity to nucleotides is the 2—methoxyethoxy (MOE, I'-OCIfeCI^OCHs) side chain (Baker et al, J. Biol Chem., 1997', 272,11944-12000; Freier et al.9 Nucleic Acids Res., 1997, 25, 4429-4443). One of the immediate advantages of the MOE substitution is the improvement in binding affinity, which is greater than many similar 2' modifications such as Omethyl, 0-propyl, and 0-aminopropyl (Freier and Altmann, Nucleic Acids Research, (1997) 25:4429-4443). 2=-O-Methoxyethyl-substituted oligonucleotides also have been shown to be antisense inhibitors of gene expression with promising features for in vivo use (Martin, ?.,Helv. Chim. Ada, 1995, 78,486-504; Altmann etal, Chimia, 1996, JO, 168-176; Altmann et at, Biochem. Soc. Trans., 1996, 24, 630-637; and Altmann et al, Nucleosides Nucleotides, 1997,16, 917-926). Relative to DNA, they display improved RNA affinity and higher nuclease resistance. Chimeric oligonucleotides with 2—0-methoxyethyl-ribonucleoside wings and a central DNA-phosphorothioate window also have been shown to effectively reduce the growth of tumors in animal models at low doses. MOE substituted oligonucleotides have shown outstanding promise as antisense agents in several disease states. One such MOE substituted oligonucleotide is presently being investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of CMV retinitis.<br>
[81] LNAs (oligonucleotides wherein the 2' and 4' positions axe connected by a bridge) also form duplexes with complementary DNA, RNA or LNA with high thennal affinities. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra show that duplexes involving fuDy modified LNA (esp. LNAiRNA) structurally resemble an A-form RNA:RNA duplex. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) examination of an LNA:DNA duplex confirmed the 3'-endo conformation of an LNA monomer. Recognition of double-stranded DNA has also been demonstrated suggesting strand invasion by LNA. Studies of mismatched sequences show that LNAs obey the Watson-Crick base pairing rules with generally improved selectivity compared to the corresponding unmodified reference strands.<br>
[82] LNAs in which the 2'-hydroxyl group is linked to the 4' carbon atom of the sugar ring thereby forming a 21-C54'-C-oxymethylene linkage thereby forming a bicyclic sugar moiety. The linkage may be a methelyne (-CH2-)n group bridging the 2' oxygen atom and the 4'<br><br>
carbon atom wherein n is 1 or 2 (Singh et al., Chem. Commun., 1998,4, 455-456). LNA and LNA analogs display very high duplex thermal stabilities with complementary DNA and RNA (Tm = +3 to +10 C), stability towards 3'-exonucleolytic degradation and good solubility properties. Other preferred bridge groups include the 2'-deoxy-2'-CH2OCH2-4' bridge.<br>
Alternative Linkers<br>
[83] In addition to phosphate diester and phosphorothioate diester linkages, other linkers are known in the art. While the primary concern of the present invention has to do with phosphate diester and phosphorothioate diester oligonucleotides, chimeric compounds having more than one type of linkage, as well as oligomers having non-phosphate/phosphorothioate diester linkages as described in further detail below, are also contemplated in whole or in part within the context of the present invention.<br>
{84] Exemplary non-phosphate/phosphorothioate diester linkages contemplated within the skill of the art include: phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3'-aIkylene phosphonates, 5!-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3*-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkyl-phosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, selenophosphates and boranophosphates. Additional linkages include: thiodiester (-O-C(O)-S-), thionocarbamate (-O-C(O)(NJ)-S-), siloxane (-O-Si(J)2-O-)&gt; carbamate (-O-C(O)-NH- and -NH-C(O)-O-)3 sulfamate (-0-S(O)(O)-N- and -N-S(O)(O)-N-, morpholino sulfamide (-O-S(O)(N(morpholino)-), sulfonamide (-O-SO2-NH-)&gt; sulfide (-CH2-S-CH2-)&gt; sulfonate (-O-SO2-CH2-)S N,N'-dimethyftydrazine (-CH2-N(CH3)-N(CH3)-)3 thioformacetal (-S-CH2-O-), formacetal (-0-CH2-O-)S thioketal (-S-C(J)2-O-)5 ketal (-O-C(Jh-O-)s amine (-NH-CH2-CH2-), hydroxylamine (-CH2-N(J)-O«)S hydroxylimine (-CH=N-O-)? and hydrazinyl (-CH2-N(H)-N(H».<br>
[85] In each of the foregoing substructures relating to internucleoside linkages, J denotes a substituent group which is commonly hydrogen or an alkyl group or a more complicated group that varies from one type of linkage to another.<br>
[86] In addition to linking groups as described above that involve the modification or substitution of the -O-P-O atoms of a naturally occurring linkage, included within the scope of the present invention are linking groups that include modification of the 5f-methylene group as well as one or more of the -OP-O- atoms.    Linkages of this type are well<br><br>
documented in the prior art and include without limitation the following: amides (-CH2-CH2-N(H)-C(O)) and -CH2-O-N=CH-;and alkylphosphorus (-C(J)2-P(=O)(OJ)-C(J)2-C(J)2-). J is as described above.<br>
Oligonucleotide Synthesis<br>
[87] Oligonucleotides are generally prepared, as described above, on a support medium, e.g. a solid support medium. In general a first synthon (e.g. a monomer, such as a nucleoside) is first attached to a support medium, and the oligonucleotide is then synthesized by sequentially coupling monomers to the support-bound synthon. This iterative elongation eventually results in a final oligomeric compound or other polymer such as a polypeptide. Suitable support medium can be soluble or insoluble, or may possess variable solubility in different solvents to allow the growing support bound polymer to be either in or out of solution as desired. Traditional support medium such as solid support media are for the most part insoluble and are routinely placed in reaction vessels while reagents and solvents react with and/or wash the growing chain until the oligomer has reached the target length, after which it is cleaved from the support and, if necessary further worked up to produce the final polymeric compound. More recent approaches have introduced soluble supports including soluble polymer supports to allow precipitating and dissolving the iteratively synthesized product at desired points in the synthesis (Giavert et al., Chem. Rev., 1997, 97,489-510).<br>
[88] The term support medium is intended to include all forms of support known to the art skilled for Hie synthesis of oligomeric compounds and related compounds such as peptides. Some representative support medium that are amenable to the methods of the present invention include but are not limited to the following: controlled pore glass (CPG); oxalyl-controlled pore glass (see, e.g., AM, et al., Nucleic Acids Research 1991, 19, 1527); silica-containing particles, such as porous glass beads and silica gel such as that formed by the reaction of trichloro-[3-(4-chloromethyl)phenyl]propylsilane and porous glass beads (see Parr and Grohmann, Angew. Chem. Internal Ed. 1972, 11, 314, sold under the trademark "PORASIL E" by Waters Associates, Framingham, Mass., USA); the mono ester of 1,4-dihydroxymethylbenzene and silica (see Bayer and Jung, Tetrahedron Lett., 1970, 4503, sold under the trademark "BIOPAK" by Waters Associates); TENTAGEL (see, e.g., Wright, et al., Tetrahedron Letters 1993, 34, 3373); cross-linked styrene/divinylbenzene copolyrner beaded matrix or POROS, a copolymer of polystyrene/divinylbenzene (available from Perceptive Biosystems); soluble support medium, polyethylene glycol PEG's (see Bonora et al., Organic Process Research &amp; Development, 2000, 4, 225-231).<br><br>
[89] Further support medium amenable to the present invention include without limitation PEPS support a polyethylene (PE) film with pendant long-chain polystyrene (PS) grafts (molecular weight on the order of 106, (see Berg, et ai, 7. Am. Chem. Soc, 1989, 111, 8024 and International Patent Application WO 90/02749),)- The loading capacity of the film is as high as that of a beaded matrix with the additional flexibility to accomodate multiple syntheses simultaneously. The PEPS film may be fashioned in the form of discrete, labeled sheets, each serving as an individual compartment. During all the identical steps of the synthetic cycles, the sheets are kept together in a single reaction vessel to permit concurrent preparation of a multitude of peptides at a rate close to that of a single peptide by conventional methods. Also, experiments with other geometries of the PEPS polymer such as, for example, non-woven felt, knitted net, sticks or microwell plates have not indicated any limitations of the synthetic efficacy.<br>
[90] Further support medium amenable to the present invention include without limitation particles based upon copolymers of dimethylaciylamide cross-linked with N,N'-bisacryloylethylenediamine, including a known amount of iV-tertbutoxycarbonyl-beta-alanyl-i\P-acryloylhexamethylenediamine. Several spacer molecules are typically added via the beta alanyl group, followed thereafter by the amino acid residue subunits. Also, the beta alanyl-containing monomer can be replaced with an acryloyl safcosine monomer during polymerization to form resin beads. The polymerization is followed by reaction of the beads with ethylenediamine to form resin particles that contain primary amines as the covalently linked functionality. The polyacrylamide-based supports are relatively more hydrophilic than are the polystyrene-based supports and are usually used with polar aprotic solvents including dimethyifonnamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and the like (see Atherton, et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1975, 97, 65U,Bioorg. Chem. 1979, 8, 351, and J. C. S. Perkin I 538 (1981)).<br>
[91] Further support medium amenable to the present invention include without limitation a composite of a resin and another material that is also substantially inert to the organic synthesis reaction conditions employed. One exemplary composite (see Scott, et al, J. Chrom. ScL, 1971, 9, 577) utilizes glass particles coated with a hydrophobic, cross-linked styrene polymer containing reactive chloromethyl groups, and is supplied by Northgate ' Laboratories, Inc., of Hamden, Conn., USA. Another exemplary composite contains a core of fluorinated ethylene polymer onto which has been grafted polystyrene (see Kent and Merrifield, Israel J. Chem. 1978,17, 243 and van Rietschoten in Peptides 1974, Y. Wolman,<br><br>
Ed., Wiley and Sons, New York, 1975, pp. 113-116). Contiguous solid support media other than PEPS, such as cotton sheets (Lebl and Eichler, Peptide Res. 1989, 2, 232) and hydroxypropylacrylate-coated polypropylene membranes (Daniels, et al.9 Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 4345). Acrylic acid-grafted polyethylene-rods and 96-microtiter wells to immobilize the growing peptide chains and to perform the compartmentalized synthesis. (Geysen, et al.s Proa Natl Acad. Sci USA, 1984, 81, 3998). A "tea bag" containing traditionally-used polymer beads. (Houghten, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci USA, 1985, 82, 5131), Simultaneous use of two different supports with different densities (Tregear, Chemistry and Biology of Peptides, J. Meienhofer, ed., Ann Arbor Sci. PubL, Ann, Arbor, 1972 pp. 175-178). Combining of reaction vessels via a manifold (Gorman, Anal Biochem., 1984, 136, 397). Multicolumn solid-phase synthesis (e.g., Krchnak, et al, Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 1989, 33, 209), and Holm and Meldal, in "Proceedings of the 20th European Peptide Symposium*1, G. Jung and E. Bayer, eds., Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., Berlin, 1989 pp. 208-210). Cellulose paper (Eichler, etal, Collect Czech. Chem. Commun^ 1989, 54, 1746). Support mediumted synthesis of peptides have also been reported (see, Synthetic Peptides: A User's Guide, Gregory A. Grant, Ed Oxford University Press 1992; US-A-4,415,732; 4,458,066; 4,500,707; 4,668/777; 4,973,679; 5,132,418; 4,725,677 and Re-34,069.)<br>
[92] Support bound oligonucleotide synthesis relies on sequential addition of nucleotides to one end of a growing chain. Typically, a first nucleoside (having protecting groups on any exocyclic amine functionalities present) is attached to an appropriate glass bead support and activated phosphite compounds (typically nucleotide phosphoramidites, also bearing appropriate protecting groups) are added stepwise to elongate the growing oligonucleotide. Additional methods for solid-phase synthesis may be found in Caruthers U.S. Patents Nos. 4,415,732; 4,458,066; 4,500,707; 4,668,777; 4,973,679; and 5,132,418; and Koster U.S. Patents Nos. 4,725,677 and Re. 34,069.<br>
[93] Commercially available equipment routinely used for the support medium based synthesis of oligomeric compounds and related compounds is sold by several vendors including, for example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. Suitable solid phase techniques, including automated synthesis techniques, are described in F. Eckstein (ed.), Oligonucleotides and Analogues, a Practical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York (1991).<br>
74<br><br>
[94] In general, the phosphorus protecting group (pg) is an alkoxy or alkylthio group or O or S having a /3-eliminable group of the formula -CHfeCEfe-Gw, wherein Gw is an electron-withdrawing group. Suitable examples of pg that are amenable to use in connection with the present invention include those set forth in the Caruthers U.S. Patents Nos. 4,415,732; 4,458,066; 4,500,707; 4,668,777; 4,973,679; and 5,132,418; and Koster U.S. Patents Nos. 4,725,677 and Re. 34,069. In general the alkyl or cyanoethyl withdrawing groups are preferred, as commercially available phosphoramidites generally incorporate either the methyl or cyanoethyl phosphorus protecting group.<br>
[95] The method for removal of pg depends upon the specific pg to be removed. The /3-eliminable groups, such as those disclosed in the Koster et al. patents, are generally removed in a weak base solution, whereby an acidic /5-hydrogen is extracted and the -CBkCffc-Gw group is eliminated by rearrangement to form the corresponding acrylo-compound CH2=CH-Gw. In contrast, an alkyl group is generally removed by nucleophilic attack on the ocarbon of the alkyl group. Such PGs are described in the Caruthers et al. patents, as cited herein.<br>
[96] The person skilled in the art will recognize that oxidation of P(UI) to P(V) can be earned out by a variety of reagents. Furthermore, the person skilled in the art will recognize that the P(V) species can exist as phosphate triesters, phosphorothioate diesters, or phosphorodithioate diesters. Each type of P(V) linkage has uses and advantages, as described herein. Thus, the term "oxidizing agent3' should be understood broadly as being any reagent capable of transforming a P(m) species (e.g. a phosphite) into a P(V) species. Thus the term "oxidizing agent" includes "sulfiirizing agent," which is also considered to have the same meaning as "thiation reagent." Oxidation, unless otherwise modified, indicates introduction of oxygen or sulfur, with a concomitant increase in P oxidation state from HI to V. Where it is important to indicate that an oxidizing agent introduces an oxygen into a P(ITF) species to make a P(V) species, the oxidizing agent will be referred to herein is "an oxygen-introducing oxidizing reagent."<br>
[97] Oxidizing reagents for making phosphate diester linkages (i.e. oxygen-introducing oxidizing reagents) under the phosphoramidite protocol have been described by e.g. Caruthers et al. and Koster et al., as cited herein. Examples of sulfurization reagents which have been used to synthesize oligonucleotides containing phosphorothioate bonds include elemental sulfur, dibenzoyltetrasulfide, 3-H-l,2-benzidithiol-3-one 1,1-dioxide (also known as Beaucage reagent), tetraefhylthiuram disulfide (TETD), and bis(O,O-diisopropoxy phosphinothioyl)  disulfide (known as Stec reagent).     Oxidizing reagents  for making<br><br>
phosphorothioate diester linkages include phenylacetyldisulfide (PADS), as described by Cole et al. in U.S. Patent No. 6,242,591. In some embodiments of the invention, the phosphorothioate diester and phosphate diester linkages may alternate between sugar subunits. In other embodiments of the present invention, phosphorothioate linkages alone may be employed. In some embodiments, the thiation reagent may be a dithiuram disulfides. See US 5,166,387 for disclosure of some suitable dithiuram disulfides. It has been surprisingly found that one dithiuram disulfide may be used together with a standard capping reagent, so that capping and oxidation may be conducted in the same step. This is in contrast to standard oxidative reagents, such as Beaucage reagent, which require that capping and oxidation take place in separate steps, generally including a column wash between steps.<br>
[98] The 5'-protecting group bg or T is a protecting group that is orthogonal to the protecting groups used to protect the nucleobases, and is also orthogonal, where appropriate to 2'-O-protecting groups, as well as to the 3'-linker to the solid support medium. In some embodiments of the invention, the 5'-protecting group is acid labile. In some embodiments according to the invention, the 5'-protecting group is selected from an optionally substituted trityl group and an optionally substituted pixyl group. In some embodiments, the pixyl group is substituted with one or more substituents selected from alkyl, alkoxy, halo, alkenyl and alkynyl groups. In some embodiments, the trityl groups are substituted with from about 1 to about 3 alkoxy groups, specifically about 1 to about 3 methoxy groups. In particular embodiments of the invention, the trityl groups are substituted with 1 or 2 methoxy groups at the 4- and (if applicable) 4s- positions. A particularly acceptable trityl group is 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl (DMT or DMTr).<br>
[99] In the context of the present invention, the term "reagent push" has the meaning of a volume of solvent that is substantially free of any active compound (i.e. reagent, activator, by-product, or other substance other than solvent), which volume of solvent is introduced to the column for the purpose, and with the effect, of pushing a reagent solution onto and through the column ahead of a subsequent reagent solution. A reagent push need not be an entire column volume, although in some cases it may include one or more column volumes. In some embodiments, a reagent push comprises at least the minimum volume necessary to substantially clear reagent, by-products and/or activator from a cross-section of the column immediately ahead of the front formed by the reagent solution used for the immediately subsequent synthetic step. An active compound, whether a reagent, by-product or activator, is considered substantially cleared if the concentration of the compound in a cross-section of<br><br>
the column at which the following reagent solution front is located, is low enough that it does not substantially affect the activity of the following reagent solution. The person skilled in the art will recognize that this the volume of solvent required for a "reagent push" will vary depending upon the solvent, the solubility in the solvent of the reagents, activators5 byproduct^ etc., that are on the column, the amounts of reagents, activators, by-products, etc. that are to be cleared from the column, etc. It is considered within the skill of the artisan to select an appropriate volume for each reagent push, especially with an eye toward the Examples, below.<br>
[100J As used herein, unless "column wash" is otherwise modified, it has the same meaning as "reagent push." In some embodiments of the invention, column wash may imply that at least one column volume is permitted to pass through the column before the subsequent reagent solution is applied to the column. Where a column volume (CV) of the column wash is specified, this indicates that a volume of solvent equivalent to the interior volume of the unpacked column is used for the column wash.<br>
[101] In the context of the present invention, a wash solvent is a solvent containing substantially no active compound that is applied to a column between synthetic steps. A "wash step" is a step in which a wash solvent is applied to the column. Both "reagent push" and "column wash" are included within this definition of "wash. step".<br>
[102] A wash solvent may be a pure chemical compound or a mixture of chemical compounds, the solvent being capable of dissolving an active compound.<br>
[103] In some embodiments according to the present invention, a wash solvent used in one of the wash steps may comprise some percentage of acetonitrile, not to exceed 50% v/v.<br>
[104] The sequence of capping and oxidation steps may be reversed, if desired. That is, capping may precede or follow oxidation. Also, with selection of a suitable thiation reagent, the oxidation and capping steps may be combined into a single step. For example, it has been surprisingly found that capping with acetic anhydride may be conducted in the presence of N,N'-dimethyldittauram disulfide.<br>
[105] Various solvents may be used in the oxidation reaction. Suitable solvents are identified in the Caruthers et al. and Koster et al. patents, cited herein. The Cole et al. patent describes acetonitrile as a solvent for phenylacetyldisulfide. Other suitable solvents include toluene, xanthenes, dichloromethane, etc.<br><br>
[106] Reagents for cleaving an oligonucleotide from a support are set forth, for example, in the Caruthers et al. and Koster et al. patents, as cited herein. It is considered good practice to cleave oligonucieotide containing thymidine (T) nucleotides in the presence of an alkylated amine, such as triethylamine, when the phosphorus protecting group is O-CH2CH2CN, because this is now known to avoid the creation if cyano-ethylated thymidine nucleotides (CNET), Avoidance of CNET adducts is described in general in US Patent No. 6,465,628, which is incoiporated herein by reference, and especially the Examples in columns 20-30, which are specifically incorporated by reference.<br>
[107] The oligonucleotide may be worked up by standard procedures known in the art, for example by size exclusion chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (e.g. reverse-phase HPLC), differential precipitation, etc. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the oligonucleotide is cleaved from a solid support medium while the 59-OH protecting group is still on the ultimate nucleoside. This so-called DMT-on (or trityl-on) oligonucleotide is then subjected to chromatography, after which the DMT group is removed by treatment in an organic acid, after which the oligonucleotide is de-salted and farther purified to form a final product<br>
[108] The 5J-hydroxyl protecting groups may be any groups that are selectively removed under suitable conditions. In particular, the 4,4'-dimethoxytriphenybnethyl (DMT) group is a favored group for protecting at the 5a-position, because it is readily cleaved under acidic conditions (e.g. in the presence of dichlroacetic acid (DCA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), or acetic acid. Removal of DMT from the support-bound oligonucleotide is generally performed with DCA (e.g. about 3 to about 10 percent DCA (v/v) in a suitable solvent. Removal of oligonucleotide after cleavage from the support is generally performed with acetic acid.<br>
[109] As described herein, oligonucleotides can be prepared as chimeras with other oligomeric moieties. In the context of this invention, the term "oligomeric compound" refers to a polymeric structure capable of hybridizing a region of a nucleic acid molecule, and an "oligomeric moiety" a portion of such an oligomeric compound. Oligomeric compounds include oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides, oligonucleotide analogs, modified oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide mimetics. Oligomeric compounds can be linear or circular, and may include branching. They can be single stranded or double stranded, and when double stranded, may include overhangs. In general an oligomeric compound comprises a backbone of linked monomeric subunits where each linked monomeric subunit is<br><br>
directly or indirectly attached to a heterocyclic base moiety. The linkages joining the monomeric subunits, the monomeric subunits and the heterocyclic base moieties can be variable in structure giving rise to a plurality of motifs for the resulting oligomeric compounds including hemimers, gapmers and chimeras. As is known in the art, a nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. The base portion of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base moiety. The two most common classes of such heterocyclic bases are purines and pyrimidines. In the context of this invention, the term " oligonucleoside" refers to nucleosides that are joined by internucleoside linkages that do not have phosphorus atoms. Intemucleoside linkages of this type include short chain alkyl, cycloalkyl, mixed heteroatom alkyl, mixed heteroatom cycloalkyl, one or more short chain heteroatomic and one or more short chain heterocyclic. These internucleoside linkages include but are not limited to siloxane, sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, acetyl, formacetyl, thioformacetyl, methylene formacetyl, thiofonnacetyl, alkeneyl, sulfamate; methyleneimino, methylenehydrazino, sulfonate, sulfonamide, amide and others having mixed N9 O, S and CH2 component parts.<br>

[Ill] Phosphoramidites used in the synthesis of oligonucleotides are available from a variety of commercial sources (included are: Glen Research, Sterling, Virginia; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, New Jersey; Cruachem Inc, Aston, Pennsylvania; Chemgenes Corporation, Waltham, Massachusetts; Proligo LLC, Boulder, Colorado; PE<br><br>
Biosystems, Foster City California; Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, California). These commercial sources sell high purity phosphoramidites generally having a purity of better than 98%. Those not offering an across the board purity for all amidites sold will in most cases include an assay with each lot purchased giving at least the purity of the particular phosphoramidite purchased. Commercially available phosphoramidites are prepared for the most part for automated DNA synthesis and as such are prepared for immediate use for synthesizing desired sequences of oligonucleotides. Phosphoramidites may be prepared by methods disclosed by e.g. Caruthers et al. (US 4,415,732; 4,458,066; 4,500,707; 4,668,777; 4,973,679; and 5,132,418) and Koster et al. (US RE 34,069).<br>
[112] Double stranded oligonucleotides, such as double-stranded RNA, may be manufactured according to methods according to the present invention, as described herein. In the case of RNA synthesis, it is necessary to protect the 2'«OH of the amidite reagent with a suitable removable protecting groups. Suitable protecting groups for 25-OH are described in US Patent Nos. 6,008,400, 6,111,086 and 5,889,136. A particularly suitable 2'-protecting group for RNA synthesis is the ACE protecting group as described in US 6,111,086. In some embodiments, it is considered advantageous to use a different 5'-protecting group for amidites used in RNA synthesis. Suitable 5'-protecting groups are set forth in US 6,008,400. A particularly suitable 5'-protecting group is the trimethylsilyloxy (TMSO) group as taught in US 6,008,400. See especially example 1, columns 10-13. The separate strands of the double stranded RNA may be separately synthesized and then annealed to form the double stranded (duplex) oligonucleotide.<br>
Oligonucleotide Use<br>
[113] Exemplary preferred antisense compounds include DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least the 8 consecutive nucleobases from the 5'-terminus of one of the illustrative preferred antisense compounds (the remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA beginning immediately upstream of the 5'-terminus of the antisense compound which is specifically hybridizable to the target nucleic acid and continuing until the DNA or RNA contains about 8 to about 80 nucleobases). Similarly preferred antisense compounds are represented by DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least the 8 consecutive nucleobases from the 3'-terminus of one of the illustrative preferred antisense compounds (the remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA<br><br>
beginning immediately downstream of the 3'-terminus of the antisense compound which is specifically hybridizable to the target nucleic acid and continuing until the DNA or RNA contains about 8 to about 80 nucleobases). One having skill in the art, once armed with the empirically-derived preferred antisense compounds illustrated herein will be able, without undue experimentation, to identify further preferred antisense compounds.<br>
[114] Antisense and other compounds of the invention, which hybridize to the target and inhibit expression of the target, are identified through experimentation, and representative sequences of these compounds are herein identified as preferred embodiments of the invention- While specific sequences of the antisense compounds are set forth herein, one of skill in the art will recognize that these serve to illustrate and describe particular embodiments within the scope of the present invention. Additional preferred antisense compounds may be identified by one having ordinary skill.<br>
[115] Specific examples of preferred antisense compounds useful in this invention include oligonucleotides containing modified backbones or non-natural internucleoside linkages. As defined in this specification, oligonucleotides having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone. For the purposes of this specification, and as sometimes referenced in the art, modified oligonucleotides that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides.<br>
RNAse H-Dependent Antisense<br>
[116] One method for inhibiting specific gene expression involves using oligonucleotides or oligonucleotide analogs as "antisense" agents. Antisense technology involves directing oligonucleotides, or analogs thereof, to a specific, target messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. The interaction of exogenous "antisense" molecules and endogenous mRNA modulates transcription by a variety of pathways. Such pathways include transcription arrest, RNAse H recruitment, and RNAi (e.g. siRNA). Antisense technology permits modulation of specific protein activity in a relatively predictable manner.<br>

[153]   Example 36: General Procedure for Synthesis of Oligonucleotides<br>
A 2.2mM synthesis is performed according to the following procedure:<br>
1.	Discharge 1 l.Og of 200 fim loaded support into a 35mm flow-through column;<br>
2.	Add approximately 150 mL of toluene to the column and allow the support to<br>
swell for several minutes. The swelled support should measure approximately 5.2 cm from<br>
the columns bottom plate to the top of the support bed.<br>
3.	Lower the columns top net adapter to approximately 7.2cm, creating a 2 cm gap<br>
between the support bed and the columns top plate.<br>
4.	Secure column locking mechanism.<br>
5.	Perform solid phase oligonucleotides synthesis using nucleoside phosphoramidites<br>
to produce an oligonucleotide having phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, or<br>
phosphorodithioate internucleoside linkages.<br>
The synthesis of step 5 can include the attachment of a first nucleoside to the support via a linker (for example a unilinker) using standard reagents, if the support is not previously derivatized to contain such a first synthon. Alternatively, if the support has been previously derivatized, the derivatized support is loaded on the'column as described above, the synthesis proceeds with the addition of phosphoramidites synthons. In addition, if the support (derivatized or not derivatized) has been previously swelled before loading onto the column, then the swelled support is loaded to allow for the aforementioned 2 cm gap.<br>
