				<td>OBSERVATION TOWER<br>
The present invention relates to an observation tower, in<br>
particular an observation tower having a moveable observation<br>
enclosure.<br>
In this regard, observation towers of many types are known<br>
in the art. For example, observation towers of the sort<br>
disclosed in EP 1031681 and EP 0659959 are employed for<br>
sighting forest fires. Such towers can be rapidly<br>
constructed, provided with foot-ladders or a lift for<br>
transporting personnel to the top, and can also be made out<br>
of. environment-friendly materials or disguised so as to blend<br>
in with the surrounding environment.<br>
Observation towers may also be used as means for providing<br>
leisure and entertainment facilities. Examples include the<br>
"Tower of the Americas" in Texas, USA, the "Faro de Madrid"<br>
in Madrid, Spain and the "Skylon" near Niagara Falls in<br>
Ontario, Canada. Numerous similar towers exist around the<br>
world, however in these examples, the observation platform,<br>
which may include therein restaurants and shops, is fixed at<br>
a specific height. Lifts or stairs are therefore provided<br>
to transport visitors from ground level to the observation<br>
platform, usually within the internal tower shaft. Thus,<br>
visitors are confined to restricted views when ascending and<br>
descending the tower to and from the observation platform.<br>
Alternatively, transparent lifts can be provided on the<br>
outside of the tower shaft, as on the "Macau Tower" in<br>
5 Macau, Asia, however the above identified problems may still<br>
prevail, with the added disadvantage that external lifts may<br>
be unsightly and disrupt the aesthetic profile of the tower.<br>
Further examples of tower structures, such as those disclosed<br>
10 in GB 655970 and EP 0337673 are provided with an observation<br>
platform mounted on a tower which itself is capable of<br>
ascending or descending. In both instances, the tower is<br>
capable of moving up and down, either by collapsing in on<br>
itself (e.g. using a so-called ^lazy tongs' system) or by<br>
15 sinking completely into the ground. The observation platform<br>
of these arrangements can thereby travel from a lower<br>
position to' a higher position. In both examples, a large<br>
horizontal or. vertical surface area is required at ground<br>
level. With the Alazy tongs' system, a larger surface area<br>
20 will be required for increased heights, and' with the latter<br>
example, the height of the tower must be accommodated below<br>
the surface of the ground. Restrictions with regard to<br>
locating the observation tower therefore apply with both<br>
examples of moveable tower.<br>
Furthermore, the vertical movement of the tower shaft<br>
required to enable boarding and disembarking of the<br>
observation platform compromises its overall strength,<br>
thereby limiting its maximum height and making it more<br>
vulnerable in adverse weather conditions.<br>
GB 1109555 and US 3633904 disclose towers that comprise a<br>
fixed tower shaft provided with a moveable observation<br>
platform. In both instances, visitors board the observation<br>
platform when it is at ground level and enjoy the<br>
surrounding scenery as the observation platform ascends to<br>
its maximum height. Similar towers have been designed and<br>
manufactured by Huss Maschinenfabrik GmbH &amp; Co. GK and<br>
Intamin Deutschland GmbH &amp; Co. GK, for example the Skytower<br>
and Gyro Tower, respectively. The aforementioned towers are<br>
limited by their height and the speed at which the<br>
observation platforms may ascend, and because of their<br>
profiles are susceptible to lateral movement during adverse<br>
weather conditions.' As previously indicated, safety of the<br>
passengers and crew is likely to be compromised in such<br>
conditions and the tower will have to be removed from<br>
operation until such time as conditions improve.<br>
Furthermore, the shape of the observation platform disclosed<br>
in GB 1109555 provides only restricted panoramic visibility,<br>
and the shape of the observation platform disclosed in<br>
US 3633904 prevents visitors from assuming a normal vertical<br>
position when seated or standing, thereby•diminishing their<br>
comfort. Functionality of the tower is hence restricted as<br>
a result of the observation platform's shape and angled<br>
orientation.<br>
It is hence an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
observation tower that seeks to overcome the above identified<br>
disadvantages.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided an observation tower comprising: a substantially<br>
upright support member; and an annular observation enclosure<br>
moveable up and down said support member; wherein the<br>
observation enclosure projects radially outwardly 'from and<br>
substantially normal to said support member and presents a<br>
tapering aerodynamic exterior profile around its<br>
circumference.<br>
The observation enclosure of the observation tower may in<br>
this respect have a toroid profile. ' As such, the curved<br>
sides of the observation enclosure allow air currents to flow<br>
easily over and around the enclosure to thereby- reduce the<br>
amount of lift or drag that is applied thereto. Less<br>
resistance is thus exerted on. the observation enclosure by<br>
air currents when, for example, it is moving up or down the<br>
supporting member of the observation tower.<br>
Also, the tower is less vulnerable to high speed winds and<br>
as a result, the observation enclosure is capable of<br>
ascending to heights of up to 200 metres. Increased control<br>
can be exerted over the speed at which the observation<br>
enclosure is movable, the speed being variable if and when<br>
necessary.<br>
In particularly adverse weather conditions the height of the<br>
observation enclosure can be reduced to decrease lateral<br>
deflection of the tower caused by wind pressure. This will<br>
enable the -tower to remain in operation during strong winds<br>
while maintaining safety and comfort for both visitors and<br>
crew.<br>
Conveniently, the substantially upright support member has<br>
a first portion arranged substantially above ground level and<br>
a second portion arranged substantially below ground level.<br>
In this regard, the observation enclosure may be lowered<br>
below ground level for gaining access to, or visibility of,<br>
an underground attraction.or enclosure.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there<br>
is provided an observation tower comprising: a substantially<br>
upright support member provided with a first portion arranged<br>
substantially above ground level and a second portion<br>
arranged substantially below ground level; and an observation<br>
enclosure moveable up and down said support member.<br>
A boarding level may be provided between said first and<br>
second portions of the support member for boarding said<br>
observation enclosure; wherein the observation enclosure is<br>
moveable up or down relative to said boarding level.<br>
Preferably, a sunken enclosure is provided around said second<br>
portion of the support member and may be arranged to house<br>
the observation enclosure when the observation enclosure is<br>
provided at the second portion of the support member.<br>
An outer surface of the sunken enclosure may comprises<br>
substantially transparent material.<br>
Damping apparatus may be provided as part of the observation<br>
tower for damping undesirable vibrations thereof. The damping<br>
apparatus may in this regard comprise a mass spring damper,<br>
tunable to vary its damping characteristics in accordance<br>
with the height of the. enclosure relative, to the .upright<br>
support member. In this•way, undesirable vibrations in the<br>
support member due to adverse weather conditions can be<br>
dampened out.<br>
Such a damping apparatus is preferably incorporated into the<br>
upright support member. Conveniently the damping apparatus<br>
is incorporated within a top portion of the support member.<br>
Examples of the present invention will now be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-<br>
Figure la, Ib, lc-and Id show an observation tower according<br>
to the present invention with an enclosure at different<br>
height positions;<br>
Figure 2,shows a close up perspective view of the enclosure<br>
of the present invention; and<br>
Figure 3.shows a cross-sectional view through the enclosure<br>
of the present invention.<br>
As shown in the figures, a tower 1.comprises a substantially<br>
upright support member 2 and ah annular observation enclosure<br>
3. The enclosure is moveable up1 and down said support member<br>
which is provided centrally thereto.<br>
The observation enclosure 3 projects radially outwardly from<br>
and substantially normal to said support member 2 and as<br>
shown presents a tapering aerodynamic exterior profile around<br>
its circumference.<br>
In the .preferred example shown, the observation enclosure has<br>
an annular profile, in particular a toroid exterior profile.<br>
As such, the curved sides of the observation enclosure allow<br>
air currents to flow easily over and around the enclosure to<br>
thereby reduce the amount of lift and/or drag that is<br>
applied thereto. Less wind pressure is thus exerted on the<br>
observation enclosure by air currents when stationery or, for<br>
example, when it is moving up or down the supporting member<br>
of the observation tower. The aerodynamic profile of the<br>
enclosure means therefore that it is less vulnerable to the<br>
affects of high winds, such that the enclosure will be<br>
stable at higher positions.<br>
Damping apparatus (not shown) may be provided as part of the<br>
observation tower for damping undesirable vibrations of the<br>
tower. The damping apparatus may in this regard comprise a<br>
mass spring damper, tunable to enable its damping<br>
characteristics to be varied in accordance with the height<br>
of the enclosure relative to the upright support member. In<br>
this way, undesirable vibrations in the support member due<br>
to adverse weather conditions can be dampened. The damping<br>
apparatus may be movable within the support for tuning<br>
purposes.<br>
Such a damping apparatus is preferably incorporated within<br>
the upright support member at a top portion thereof.<br>
An annular flow path may be provided through the centre of<br>
the enclosure between an inwardly facing wall 4 thereof and<br>
the support member 2 as shown in Figure 2. .<br>
The enclosure is preferably sized to house around 70-100<br>
persons, offering them a 360-degree panoramic walk-around<br>
experience. It can'be air-conditioned with climate-control<br>
to ensure comfort is optimised. A retractable solar shading<br>
arrangement may be provided to cover the roof of the<br>
enclosure when required.<br>
The enclosure may be constructed of steel and i glass,<br>
preferably using curved laminated safety glass.<br>
As shown in Figures la to Id, the enclosure is movable up<br>
and down the support member 2 and can dock at an alighting<br>
/<br>
platform position 5 and also move to an underground position,<br>
shown in Figure Id.<br>
The underground position can provide . shelter from<br>
particularly adverse weather conditions or may provide access<br>
to a particular or restricted access area.<br>
For example, the underground area may incorporate an<br>
underground aquarium, whereby the enclosure drops into an<br>
annular tank housing various aquatic plants and <br>
Horizontally translating off-set hinged glazed doors may<br>
afford access to the enclosure.<br>
The support member may be formed for example, from 3.4 m<br>
diameter grade 43 galvanised steel. A machine room, not<br>
shown, is provided at a'lower portion of the support member.<br>
Renewable energy is utilized to power the observation tower<br>
and this may take the form of photovoltaic systems or wind<br>
turbines.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
