				<td>CHIMERIC POLYPEPTIDE, METHOD FOR ITS MANUFACTURE AND COMPOSITION<br>
COMPRISING IT<br>
The invention relates to chimeric polypeptides wherein said polypeptides comprise a<br>
modified binding domain of growth hormone linked to a receptor binding domain of<br>
growth hormone receptor; and tandems/oligomers of said modified growth hormone<br>
binding domains.<br>
GH is a member of a large family of hormones involved in the regulation of<br>
mammalian growth and development. Human GH is a 22kDa polypeptide which is<br>
involved in a number of biological processes. For example, cell growth, lactation,<br>
the activation of macrophages and the regulation of energy metabolism. GH interacts<br>
sequentially with two membrane bound GHR's via two separate sites on GH referred<br>
as site 1 and site 2. Site 1 is a high affinity binding site and site 2 a low affinity site.<br>
A single GH molecule binds 1 GHR via site 1. A second GHR is then recruited via<br>
site 2 to form a GHR:GH:GHR complex. The complex is then internalised and<br>
activates a signal transduction cascade leading to changes in gene expression.<br>
The extracellular domain of the GHR exists as two linked domains each of<br>
approximately 100 amino acids (SD-100), the C-terminal SD-100 domain (b) being<br>
closest to the cell surface and the N-terminal SD-100 domain (a) being furthest away.<br>
It is a conformational change in these two domains that occurs on hormone binding<br>
with the formation of the trimeric complex GHR-GH-GHR.<br>
Modified GH's arc disclosed in US 5, 849, 535 which is incorporated by reference.<br>
The modification to GH is at both site 1 and site 2 binding sites. The modifications<br>
to site 1 produce a GH molecule which has a higher affinity for GHR compared to<br>
wild-type GH. These modified GH molecules act agonists. There is also disclosure<br>
of site 2 modifications which result in the creation of GH antagonists. Further<br>
examples of modifications to GH which alter the binding affinity of GH for site 1 are<br>
disclosed in US 5,854,026; US 6,004,931; US6,022,711; US6,057,292; and<br><br>
US6136563 each of which are incorporated by reference. A summary of the<br>
modifications made to site 1 is provided in Table 1. Modifications to site 2 are also<br>
disclosed, in particular amino acid residue G120 which when modified to either<br>
arginine, lysine, tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, or glutamic acid creates a GH<br>
molecule with antagonistic properties.<br>
In addition, the modified GH is coated in polyethylene glycol (PEG) by a process<br>
known as "pegylation" this has several beneficial effects. Firstly, the PEG coat<br>
increases the effective molecular weight of GH from 22kD to approximately 40kD.<br>
The effect this has is to decrease glomerular filtration of GH thereby increasing the<br>
half-life of GH in vivo which reduces the dose administered to produce the desired<br>
effect. In addition pegylation is thought to reduce both the immunogenicity and<br>
toxicity of proteins which are treated in this way, see Abuchowski et al J Biol Chem.,<br>
252,3578-3581,(1977).<br>
However, a consequence of pegylation is to reduce the affinity of the modified GH<br>
molecule for GHR. This means that an increased dose is required to counter the<br>
reduced affinity. This is undesirable since it counteracts the advantageous effect of<br>
pegylation with respect to increasing the half life of modified GH. It would be<br>
desirable to provide a modified GH molecule which does not require pegylation but<br>
has an increased half-life and also has the added benefits of reduced immunogenicity<br>
and lacks toxicity.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a chimeric polypeptide<br>
comprising:<br>
i)	at least one modified binding domain of growth hormone wherein said<br>
modification is the addition, deletion or substitution of at least one amino acid<br>
residue; and<br>
ii) a growth hormone binding domain of a growth hormone receptor.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide is modified in the site 1<br>
binding domain of growth hormone.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide is modified in the<br>
site 2 binding domain of growth hormone.<br>
In a yet further preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide is modified at<br>
both site 1 and site 2 of growth hormone.<br>
As previously described, site 1 mutations are known in the art which increase the<br>
affinity of growth hormone for its binding domain on growth hormone receptor.<br>
Such modified growth hormone acts as an agonist. If a site 1 modification is<br>
combined with a site 2 modification wherein the latter modification results in an<br>
inactive or partially active site 2 binding site then such a molecule is an antagonist.<br>
A modification just to site 2 which exploits a wild-type site 1 binding site also creates<br>
an antagonist.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention there is provided a polypeptide<br>
comprising a site 1 binding domain which has been modified by amino acid<br>
substitution wherein said modification is selected from the group consisting of:<br>
histidine 18 with alanine or aspartic acid; and/or histidine 21 with asparagine; and/or<br>
glutamrne 22 with alanine; and/or phenylalanine 25 with alanine; and/or aspartic acid<br>
26 with alanine; and/or glutamine 29 with alanine; and/or glutamic acid 167 with<br>
alanine; and/or aspartic acid 171 with serine; and/or lysine 172 with serine or alanine;<br>
and/or isoleucine 179 with tyrosine, of the sequence represented in Figure 13 .<br>
Preferably said modification to increase the affinity of site 1 for its binding domain in<br>
GHR consists of the amino acid substitutions: histidine 18 aspartic acid; histidine 21<br>
asparagine; arginine 167 asparagine; aspartic acid 171 arginine; glutamic acid 174<br>
serine; and iso leucine 179 threonine; as represented by the GH amino acid sequence<br>
in Figure 13.<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said modification to increase the<br>
affinity of site 1 for its binding domain in GHR consists of the amino acid<br>
substitutions: histidine 18 alanine; glutamine 22 alanine; phenylalanine 25 alanine;<br>
aspartic acid 26 alanine; glutamine 29 alanine; glutamic acid 65 alanine; lysine 168<br>
alanine; and glutamic acid 174 alanine; as represented by the GH amino acid<br>
sequence in Figure 13.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention said site 2 modification is to<br>
amino acid residue 120 of the sequence presented in Figure 13. Preferably said site 2<br>
modification is combined with site 1 modifications as herein disclosed.<br>
Alternatively, GH is modified only at amino acid residue glycine 120.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said site 2 modification is a substitution<br>
of glycine for an amino acid selected from the group consisting of: arginine; alanine;<br>
lysine; tryptophan; tyrosine; phenylalanine; and glutamic acid. Preferably said<br>
substitution is glycine 120 for arginine or lysine or alanine.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention the growth hormone binding<br>
domain of GHR is the extracellular domain of GHR. More preferably the binding<br>
domain is the C-terminal SD-100 domain of GH.<br>
Alternatively said binding domain is the full length GHR.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said chimeric polypeptide is a fusion<br>
protein wherein the modified GH is an inframe translational fusion with GHR, or part<br>
thereof. Preferaby, said fusion polypeptide comprises modified GH and the C-<br>
terminal SD-100 domain of GHR.<br><br>
In an alternative further preferred embodiment of the invention, the modified binding<br>
domain of GH is linked by a linker to the GH binding domain of GHR. The linker<br>
may be flexible.<br>
The linker could be at any residue within the extracellular domain of the receptor<br>
which would allow the modified GH to flexibly bind with the free receptor at the cell<br>
surface. Preferably the linkage is made between a residue close to the C-terminus of<br>
the modified GH molecule and a residue close to the N-terminus of GHR. More<br>
preferably the linkage is made between a residue close to the C-terminus of modified<br>
GH molecule and a residue close to the N-terminal of the N-terminal of the C-<br>
terminal SD-100. More preferably the linkage is made at any of residues 126-128 of<br>
the N-terminus of the C-terminal SD-100 of the GHR. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the linkage is made at residue 127 of the N-terminus of the C-terminal SD-<br>
100. Preferably the linker is a peptide.<br>
The crystal structure of the GHR:GH:GHR complex reveals that the distance<br>
between the C-terminus of GH (residue 191) and N-terminus of the C-terminus SD-<br>
100 (residue 126-128) is 10A. This provides invaluable information with respect to<br>
linker design.<br>
Preferably the linker is a polypeptide which comprises 5 to 30 amino acid residues.<br>
More preferably the linker comprises 10 to 20 amino acid residues. More preferably<br>
still the linker comprises at least one copy of the peptide:<br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention the linker is 10 amino acids in length and<br>
comprises two copies of the Gly4Ser linker. In an alternative embodiment of the<br>
invention, the linker is 15 amino acids in length and comprises three copies of the<br>
GIy4Ser linker. In yet an alternative embodiment, the linker is 20 amino acids in<br>
length and comprises four copies of the Gly4Ser linker.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said polypeptide is derived from human<br>
GH and human GHR.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a nucleic acid<br>
molecule which encodes a polypeptide according to the invention selected from the<br>
group consisting of:<br>
i)	a nucleic acid molecule as represented by the nucleic acid sequence in Figure<br>
13; and<br>
ii) a nucleic acid molecule which hybridises to the nucleic acid sequence in (i).<br>
Nucleic acid molecules which encode a modified growth hormone according to the<br>
invention can typically be synthesized by molecular techniques known in the art and<br>
include recombinant methods as well as the synthesis of nucleic acid molecules using<br>
oligonucleotide synthesizers.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said nucleic acid molecule hybridises<br>
under stringent hybridisation.<br>
The term "stringent hybridisation conditions" as used herein refers to parameters with<br>
which the art is familiar. Nucleic acid hybridization parameters may be found in<br>
references which compile such methods, e.g. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory<br>
Manual, J. Sambrook, et al., eds;, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory<br>
Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989, or Current Protocols in Molecular<br>
Biology, F.M. Ausubel, et al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York. More<br>
specifically, stringent conditions, as used herein, refers, for example, to hybridization<br>
at 65°C in hybridization buffer (3.5 x SSC, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, 0.02% Bovine Serum Albumin, 2.5mM NaH2PO4(pH7), 0.5% SDS,<br>
2mM EDTA). SSC is 0.15M sodium chloride/0.015M sodium citrate, pH7; SDS is<br>
sodium dodecyl sulphate; and EDTA is ethylenediammetetracetic acid. After<br><br>
hybridization, the membrane upon which the DNA is transferred is washed at 2 x<br>
SSC at room temperature and then at 0.1 - 0.5 X SSC/0.1 x SDS at temperatures up<br>
to 68'C.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a vector comprising<br>
the nucleic acid molecule according to the invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said vector is an expression vector<br>
adapted for recombinant gene expression.<br>
Typically said adaptation includes, by example and not by way of limitation, the<br>
provision of transcription control sequences (promoter sequences) which mediate<br>
cell/tissue specific expression. These promoter sequences may be cell/tissue specific,<br>
inducible or constitutive.<br>
Promoter is an art-recognised term and, for the sake of clarity, includes the following<br>
features which are provided by example only, and not by way of limitation. Enhancer<br>
elements are cis acting nucleic acid sequences often found 5' to the transcription<br>
initiation site of a gene (enhancers can also be found 3' to a gene sequence or even<br>
located in intronic sequences and is therefore position independent). Enhancers<br>
function to increase the rate of transcription of the gene to which the enhancer is<br>
linked. Enhancer activity is responsive to trans acting transcription factor which have<br>
been shown to bind specifically to enhancer elements. The binding/activity of<br>
transcription factors (please see Eukaryotic Transcription Factors, by David S<br>
Latchman, Academic Press Ltd, San Diego) is responsive to a number of<br>
environmental cues which include, by example and not by way of limitation,<br>
intermediary metabolites and/or environmental effectors.<br>
Promoter elements also include so called TATA box and RNA polymerase initiation<br>
selection (RIS) sequences which function to select a site of transcription initiation.<br><br>
These sequences also bind polypeptides which function, inter alia, to facilitate<br>
transcription initiation selection by RNA polymerase.<br>
Adaptations also include the provision of selectable markers and autonomous<br>
replication sequences which both facilitate the maintenance of said vector in either<br>
the eukaryotic cell or prokaryotic host. Vectors which are maintained autonomously<br>
are referred to as episomal vectors. Episomal vectors are desirable since these<br>
molecules can incorporate large DNA fragments (30-50kb DNA). Episomal vectors<br>
of this type are described in WO98/07876 which is incorporated by reference.<br>
Adaptations which facilitate the expression of vector encoded genes include the<br>
provision of transcription termination/polyadenylation sequences. This also includes<br>
the provision of internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) which function to maximise<br>
expression of vector encoded genes arranged in bicistronic or multi-cistronic<br>
expression cassettes.<br>
These adaptations are well known in the art. There is a significant amount of<br>
published literature with respect to expression vector construction and recombinant<br>
DNA techniques in general. Please see, Sambrook et al (1989) Molecular Cloning: A<br>
Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbour, NY and<br>
references therein; Marston, F (1987) DNA Cloning Techniques: A Practical<br>
Approach Vol III IRL Press, Oxford UK; DNA Cloning: F M Ausubel et al, Current<br>
Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.(1994).<br>

When administered, the pharmaceutical preparations of the invention are applied in<br>
pharmaceuticaUy-acceptable amounts and in pharmaceutically-acceptable<br>
compositions. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means a non-toxic material<br>
that does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active<br>
ingredients. Such preparations may routinely contain salts, buffering agents,<br>
preservatives, compatible carriers, and optionally other therapeutic agents.<br>
The compositions may be combined, if desired, with a pharmaceutically-acceptable<br>
carrier. The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable "carrier", means one or more<br>
compatible solid or liquid fillers, diluents or encapsulating substances which are<br>
suitable for administration into a human. The term "carrier" denotes an organic or<br>
inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is<br>
combined to facilitate the application. The pharmaceutical compositions may contain<br>
suitable buffering agents, including: acetic acid in a salt; citric acid in a salt; boric<br>

DNA constructs<br>
GENERATION OF SITE 2 MUTATED GH ANTAGONIST (GHa)<br>
The cDNA for human GH (Fig 1) has been PCR amplified from human pituitary<br>
tissue and cloned into the vector pTrcHis-Topo (pTrcHis-TOPO-GHstop). The GHR<br>
extracellular domain was amplified from human liver cDNA using PCR.<br>
Growth Hormone Antagonist (G120R) Constructs<br>
G120R Mutation of Growth Hormone<br>
The growth hormone (GH) gene was mutated using the phagemid ssDNA mutation<br>
method. The GH gene was first sub-cloned from pTrcHisGH into pT7T318 between<br>
BamHI and HindIII sites, to produce pT7T318-GH. This plasmid was then<br>
transformed into E. coli CJ236 and single stranded ssDNA produced.<br><br>
The ssDNA pT7T318-GH was then mutated by changing the codon for Gly120 from<br>
GGC to CGC, the primer GH.(G120R)For was used (Table 1).<br>
The dsDNA pT7T318-GH.G120R produced after the mutation process was then used<br>
to sub-clone the GH.G120R into a pHEAT vector, this gave pHEAT.GH.G120R<br>
(Fig.1).<br>
Generation of GH.G120R Constructs<br>
γ 1A7 rGH.G120R-(G4S)4-GHR(b)1 = GHa linked to b domain of GHR.<br>
The GH.G120R gene was excised from pHEAT.GH.G120R (Fig. 1) using the<br>
restriction sites BamHI and NotI. The gene was then ligated in place of the GH gene<br>
in pTrcHisX1A1 [GH-(G4S)4-GHR(b)] (Fig. 2). The resulting plasmid was<br>
transformed into Escherichia coli XL1 Blue and plated on LB (0.3% glucose,<br>
50µg/ml ampicillin, 12.5µg/ml tetracycline) agar plates.<br>
X 1B2 [GH.G120R-(G4S)4-GHRflec] = GHa linked to full length extracellular domain<br>
of the GHR.<br>
The strategy used to generate the x1A.7 gene was repeated, however the<br>
recipient vector was pTrcHisX1B1 [GH-(G4S)4-GHRflec] (Fig. 3). The resulting<br>
plasmid was transformed into E. coli XL1 Blue and plated on LB (0.3% glucose,<br>
50µg/ml ampicillin, 12.5µg/ml tetracycline) agar plates.<br>
X1C3 [GH.G120R-(G4S)4-GH.G120R] = GHa tandem.<br>
A PCR reaction was performed on pTrcHisGH using the primers DiGHEcoF1<br>
and DiGHHinRl (Table 1). The PCR product was then digested with EcoRI and<br>
HindIII, this was then ligated in place of the GHR(b) domain in pTrcHisxl A1 [GH-<br>
(G4S)4-GHR(b)] (Fig. 4). The resulting plasmid was transformed into the<br>
recombinant deficient E. coli SURE and plated on LB (0.3% glucose, 50µg/ml<br>
ampicillin, 12.5µg/ml tetracycline, 50µg/ml kanamycin) agar plates.<br>
Sequencing Results<br><br>
Plasmids containing the construct genes were sequenced. The sequences of the genes<br>
and the regions sequenced for GH.G120R, x1A7, x1B2 and x1C3 are shown in Figs.<br>
5-8, respectively.<br>
Expression Studies<br>
Single colonies were used to inoculate 3ml LB (0.3% glucose, 50µg/ml ampicillin,<br>
12.5µg/ml tetracycline) broth for E. coli XL1 Blue cells and LB (0.3% glucose,<br>
50µg/ml ampicillin, 12.5µg/ml tetracycline, 50µg/ml kanamycin) broth for E. coli<br>
SURE cells. These were grown, shaking, overnight at 37°C.<br>
4mls of 4YT media, containing the appropriate antibiotics, were then inoculated with<br>
200µl of the overnight LB culture. These were grown for 3 hours, 1ml samples were<br>
then taken (T0 samples).<br>
The 4YT cultures were then induced with IPTG to a final concentration of 1mM and<br>
then further incubated for another 4 hours (T4 samples).<br>
The T0 and T4 samples were processed immediately after .they had been taken. They<br>
were first centrifugcd to pellet the cells, the supernatant was then discarded and the<br>
pellet processed for running on a SDS PAGE gel. Protein was visualised on these<br>
PAGE gels by either Coomassie staining or by western blot using an anti-GH primary<br>
antibody to probe for the construct.<br>
In all cases the Coomassie stained PAGE gels do not show over-expression of the<br>
construct. However, the constructs are observed on the western blots (Fig. 9). These<br>
show that in all cases protein of the correct size is expressed.<br>
Purification<br>
In general protein was purified from 4 x 250ml cultures grown in 4YT, containing<br>
the appropriate antibiotics, and induced for 4-5 hours with IPTG to a final<br><br>
concentration of 1mM. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by<br>
treatment with lysozyme and sodium deoxycholate followed by sonication.<br>
The lysed cells were centrifuged to remove cell debris and the supernatant initially<br>
purified using Invitrogen ProBond Resin (Ni-column). Protein was eluted using 5ml<br>
0.5M imidazole.<br>
The protein sample was further purified by diluting the eluant from the Ni-column 10<br>
times in a suitable buffer and then passing it through a MonoQ ion-exchange column.<br>
Protein was eluted using a salt gradient of 0-1M NaCl over 20ml at a rate of<br>
0.5ml/min; 0.5ml fractions were collected. The fractions were then analysed for the<br>
presence of the construct, and the fractions containing the construct pooled.<br>
The purified protein was analysed by SDS PAGE (Coomassie staining and western<br>
blot) (Fig. 10) and assayed to measure its concentration. The protein was then<br>
submitted for the bioassay.<br>
In the cases of x1A7 and x1B2, which showed cleaved products by western blot, the<br>
constructs were submitted to the Rapid Translation System (RTS) for in vitro<br>
transcription. Previous, studies on x1A1 and x1B1 have shown that cleavage was<br>
greatly reduced using the RTS system in conjunction with protease inhibitors and<br>
chaperones for expression.<br>
Bioassay<br>
The purified constructs were submitted to the Asterion standard GH bioassay.<br>
Prepared 293 Hi, which stably express growth hormone receptor, were stimulated<br>
with the construct using a range of doses. A second duplicate plate was also prepared,<br>
bat 25ng/ml GH was added 30min. after adding the construct to observe the<br>
antagonistic capability of the construct.<br>
All the GH.G120R constructs had antagonistic activities (Fig. 11).<br><br>
Screening of Antagonist Activity<br>
An established bioassay is used to screen for antagonist activity (9). A permanent cell<br>
line expressing the full length GHR is transiently transfected with a luciferase<br>
reporter that binds activated Stat5 (9). Twenty-four hours later the cells are<br>
stimulated with GH for 6 hours with or without antagonist. The cells are then lysed<br>
and luciferase activity measured (9).<br>
Testing metabolic clearance rate in vivo<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats are anaesthetised and cannulae implanted in femoral and jugular<br>
veins. Two days later GH chimera or tandem is administered by intravenous or<br>
subcutaneous injection. Blood samples are collected via the femoral cannula and<br>
chimera and tandem or oligomer protein levels measured by radio-immunoassay.<br>
Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated using available computer programs fitting<br>
hormone concentration against time.<br>
