WO 
One of the most representative compounds of the .invention in WO 94/22808 is FCE28245, chemically 2-{4-t:i-phfjnylpropyl]oxybenzyl]-ainino-3-hydroxypropanamide met hnne.sulfonate claimed to be active in the test of the electro- shock convulsions in the mouse.<br>
PCT n* WO 95/18617 .(Teva-Technion) and PCT n. WO 96/21640 (Teva-Lemmon) describe 1-aminobenzocycloalkane derivatives, such as 1-aminoindans and 1-aminotetralins,<br>
 which can be used in the treatment of Parkinsons's disease, dementias, epilepsy and in post-traumatic diseases.<br>
However, some of the described compounds, such as raeeiuic N-( 2-acetamido )-l-aminoindan and its optically active forms; N- ( 2-acetamido ) -6-fluoro- 1-aminoindan; N-( 2-acetamido ) -l--aminotetralin; N,N-di- ( 2-acetamido)-1-aniinoindan and N - ( 2-propi onamido )-l-aminoi ndan were not veryy effective in the anticonvulsant activity test and <br>
don't seem endowed with a particularly favourable therapeutic index.<br>
Now it has been found that α-amino acids amides of general formula (I) are <br>
characterized by a higher efficacy and/or a better pharmacological profile than <br>
the prior art compounds. The present relates to an improved and synergistic mixture of compounds<br>
of formula I having unexpected properties.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be prepared reacting amino acids reacting amino acids esters or amides of formula II<br>

or a NHR2 group, wherein R2 is as defined above,<br>
with compounds of formula III<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Y is an oxygen atom or a NH group, whereas R3 and R4  which are the same or different, are hydrogen or, together with the carbon atom they, are linked to, they form one of the groups R, or R1, as defined above, to give compounds of formula IV.<br><br><br><br>
(IV)<br>
which can then be transformed into compounds of formula I hy means of one or more of the following reactions:<br>
when X is an alkoxy group, reaction with an amine<br>
of formula R2-NH2;<br>
N-alkylation;<br>
ncylation of any hydroxy group present in R^;<br>
salificatton and/or optical resolution.<br>
elimination of any protecting groups.<br>
A first embodiment, of the process described above involves the reductive amination of a compound of formula TI or a salt thereof (generally the hycltochloride) wherein X is an alkoxy group, for example mfit.hoxy, with a compound of general formula III wherein<br>
i<br>
Y js oxygen and the subsequent, reaction with an amine of formula R2-NH2-<br>
The reductive amination is carried out according to conventional methods, using stoichiometric amounts or slight excesses of the reagents, at temperatures ranging f.tom 0 to 40*C and in organic solvents such as alcohols or acetoriitrile. A hydride such as sodium cyanoborohydride or hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as Pd on-carbon can be used as a reducing agont..<br>
The subsequent amidat.ion reaction is carried out ur.ing an ami no oxcer.s in water or in an organic solvent, particularly methanol or ethanol, at. room temperature or heating in a chemical reactor.<br>
A  second  embodiment.  involves  the  reductive<br><br>
7 ami nation of a compound II wherein X is a R2~NH group,<br>
according to the procedures already described.<br>
Finally, a third embodiment involves the Lransimination of a compound II wherein X is R2~NH- with nri imine compound (generally a phenylimine) III wherein Y is NH. The reaction is carried out in an organic solvent, for example an alcohol, methylene chloride or rtcelonitrile at a temperature from 0* to 40'C. The subsequent reduction of the resulting compound is carried out in an organic solvent, generally an alcohol such as ethanol or methanol , using a hydride such as sodium borohydride as reducing agent, at a temperature from 0' to 40 "C.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds I can also be prepared by condensation of an alfa-halogen ester of formula V<br>
wherein Fj is as defined above and preferably H, W is a ha logon atom (generally chlorine or bromine) and R5 is arv alkyl group, with an amine of formula VI<br>
wherein Rg and R^ are as defined above, and subsequent amidati.nn with the amine ^2~^^2' Tne condensation of compound V with compound VT is carried out in an organic r.olvont., for example acetonitrile, alcohol, dimethylformamido at a temperature from 40* to 140*C in the presence of an acid-binding agent, for example potassium carbonate and preferably in the presence of<br><br>
8 catalytic amounts of potassium iodide. The amidation is<br>
Lheri carried out as described above.<br>
It is also possible to condense an alfa-halogen amide with the amine VI.<br>
For the envisaged therapeutical uses, compounds I wiJl be formulated in suitable pharmaceutical compositions which are a further object of the invention.<br>
Said compositions will typically contain 1 to 1000 mg of active ingredient, particularly 30 to 100 mg, and will be administered one or more times a day depending cm Ihe disease, the pharmacokinetics of the selected active ingredient and the conditions (weight, sex, age) of the patient.<br>
The compositions will be prepared using conventional techniques and excipients as described for example in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences Handbook, Mnck. Pub., N.Y., U.S.A., and will be administered by the oral, parenteral or rectal route. Examples of formulations comprise tablets, capsules, syrups, granulates, sterile injectable solutions or suspensions, suppositories and the like.<br>

The compounds of the invention were evaluated in some pharmacological tests in order to investigate their potential anticonvulsant activity. To this end, compounds were screened in the maximal electroshock (MRS) test. This model is widely used to assess the efficacy of antiepileptic agents against generalized and partial seizures. This study was performed in both rat and mouse by using the experimental procedure described in W. Lcisher et al. , Epilepsy Res., 2 (1988), 145-181. Briefly, a 60 Hz alternate current (mice 50 mA, rats 150 mA) was delivered for 0.2 sec through corneal electrods by means of an electrical stimulator. Anticonvulsant potency of a compound was determined after 60 ruin and up to 180 min from administration (p.o.) by calculation of itr. EDjo *or suppression of tonic hind limb extensions. Groups of 30 animals per dose were used and the EDtjQ was calculated from the dose-effect curve accordingly to l.itchfield and Wi Icoxon (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. , 96 (194
In the rat MES model only the time course of anticonvulsant activity was evaluated . Groups of 10 rats were treated at their equiactive dose 30, 60, 120, ','.40, 360 and 480 min before the establishment of the electroshock. The peak of anticonvulsanL activity and the duration of action were then evaluated.<br>
Tn another serie of experiments performed in mouse the nourotoxicity of tbe compounds was evaluated as a nnMSiire of the impaired motor function by using the horizontal screen test (L.L. Coughenour et al., Pharmacol. Bioch. and Behav., 6 (1977), 351--3S3). In<br><br>
thjs model mice are placed individually on top of a .«;quire wire screen which is mounted horizontally on a metal rod, which is then rotated 180* so that mice are on the bottom of the screens. Impairment of the motor function is observed from the number of animals that falls from the screen or fail to climb to the top of the screens. The medial neurological toxic dose (TDj0) is than calculated as above. The ratio of TD^Q and ED^Q refers to the therapeutic index (T.T.) for each compound. The T.I. is used to show a useful separation between neurotoxicity and antiepileptic activity. The larger the T.I. would indicate a better separation between the above activities and a good profile as anl iconvulsant.s.<br>
In the mouse MES model all the examined compounds sliowed a potency of ariLiconvulsant aqtivity expressed in moles better than that of milacemide and/or sodium valproato. The ED^Q values were comprised between 1.2 and 0.5 inmol/kg with a potency ratio ranging from 4.5 to 3f&gt; with respect to milacemide and from 1 to 6.7 with respect to sodium valproate.<br>
The evaluation of the time course of anticorivulsant activity showed that some compounds were rapidly ahuorhed with a peak of the effect at 30 minutes after administration, whereas other compounds exerted more deferred effect:; that peaked even at three hours after /.ulmi ni strati on .<br>
A common feature Lo many compounds was a good perSistance of the effects with a suppression of the convulsions equal to or greater than 50% still stylistically significant more than three hours after<br><br>
administration.<br>
The duration of action was longer than that of mi laromidc which was of • about, one hour.<br>
The results of the MES test in mouse of the more representative compounds of the invention at 60 min after administration arc shown in the following Trfble 2.<br>
The activity of the compounds has boon compared wi t.h Lhat of two compounds of the prior art: FCE 28245, ;i prototype of a new , eerie of alanirie derivatives endowed with an anticonvulsant activity and TEVA compound 2 (a !• ami noindane derivative), described in WO 94/22808 and in WO 95/18617 respectively.<br><br>
T.T.: therapeutic index<br>
All compounds were administered as HC1 salts. The individual enantiomers of 2-aminoindane and ciminotetral ine derivatives showed a significant Icotivulsant activity. The (S)-hydroxyl-2 ami noindane<br><br>
derivative CHF2993 and its enantiomer (R) CHF2996 were oquipotent in the MES test. This latter compound showed ;ilso the higher T.T. (44) since its low value of ncurotoxicity (&gt;1500 mg/kg P.O.). The introduction of a methyl-group in the mojoty of the CHF2993 resulted in a compound (CHF3440) with the same anticonvulsant activity buL with an increase of the neurotoxicity (TD5Q-689). Conversely, both the (S) 2-(2-indanylamino) propionamide an
All the tested compounds were about 3-4 times more polenl  than  FCE20245,  chemically  3-hydroxy--2-(4-(3-phenylpropyloxy)benzylamino)propanamide in.:I hanosulphonate.<br>
It is also worth noting that the 2-aminoindane derivative CHF33R1 had a higher T.I. than the prior art :l --.'•uniiioiridarie compound 2 known from WO Q5/1fi617, ch'-iinically (S)-2-( indanylamino) acetamide. Tn fact the ?.-HmLnolndane compound of the invention was more potent <is an nnticonvulsaut than the of prior art . taken together these results it appears that cl.-u:f. compounds invention o>:hihi l.od less impairment of the motor coordination than the compound of the prior art.<br>
Further to the MES test in mouse, some compounds were also evaluated in the MES test in rat and in a<br><br>
chemical model of Conic convulsions induced by bicuculline accordingly to the procedure described in Swi.nyard E.A. et. al., Antiepileptic Druys, 3r(1 Rdir.ion, Kavon Press, New York (1989). Tn this model mice were observed for 30 minutes after administration of a dose of bicuculline (s.c.) that induced in 97% of. the animals » presence of tonic convulsions. In animal?: treated with compounds, abolition of the hindleg tonic-extension component is taken as the end point thus suggesting that i h« .substance under examination has the ability to pi event the seizure spread.<br>
As reference compound FCE 26743 (S)-2-(4-(3-f Iuorober\zyloxy)ben7.ylamino)pro panamide war. used, disclosed in the prior art in KP-B1-0400495.<br>
The results are shown in Table 3 as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br>

In the rat MES test CHF2993, CHP2996 and FCE 26743 showed an anticonvulsant activity close to that found in<br><br>
the same moclol In mouse. In this test CHF 2983 was more potent, with an BD^Q of 19 my/kg P.O., lower than that reported .in mouse MF.S. The analysis of the kinetics of t ho pharmacological effects showed that CHF2993 had the longest duration ot action (6 hours). Tn any case the duration of action of all the tested compounds was longer than that, of the reference compound FCE 26743 (1 hour). Tn the bicuculline-induced convulsions in mice, KDrl0 fot CHF2993, CHF2983 and FCE 26743 was 65, 67 and 7.0 my/Kg P.O., respectively. Although these values were higher than those obtained in mouse MES test, still l.hns« values were in the same order of potency of their Mt:s&gt; ariticonvulsant activity.<br>
Taken together these results/ we can conclude that, t lie compounds described herein showed a significant ant Lcorivulsarit activity in the MES model in both mouse <uul vat and also in a model of bicucul ine-induced ronvulsions mouse. the activity exhibited by these compounds mice wore almost similar to that found for r.ottio standard antic-pi leptic drugs including phenytoin at. least four times higher than valproale which literature data mvidwntlate smaller therapeutic indexes comparison w those foiind present investigation.></uul>
