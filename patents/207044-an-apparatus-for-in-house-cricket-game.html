AN APPARATUS FOR IN— HOUSE CRICKET GAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to IN-HOUSE CRICKET, more particularly indoor cricket. In this game it includes a board, which contains 101 boxes with view of pitch and score board can be folded into three or four columns. Further, the present invention comprises a ball having ten sides showing numbers of runs from zero to four and six and no ball and wide ball.<br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Normally the home game includes playing cards, snakes and stairs, computer games, video games. Fan of cricket can not enjoy playing cricket indoor; hence, they have to go outside the house. In the hot season going out side the house will not be preferred and will not be allowed by the elders. In the monsoon cricket can not be played due to water assembling. Hence, this invention presents home game, preferably cricket.<br>
Indian patent no. 185365 presents a game-set for indoor cricket, comprising a board representative of cricket play ground. This consists of a set of three dicer of difference in number of sides. The play ground is divided into three portions. First part is divided into two portions, second in three parts and third in four portions and finally each portion divided into two parts with wickets marked by three dots, whereas in the present invention neither play ground is needed nor a set of dicer.<br>
Normally a ball of the cricket is round. In the indoor cricket as per the Indian patent no. 185365 a set of the dicer in the game is required. In the present invention a ball is not a round and not a set of dicer is required.<br><br>
batsman cannot have multiple runs. On one side of the ball two dots are shown for two runs. On one side of the ball three dots are shown for three runs. On one side of the ball four dots are shown for four runs. On one side of the ball six dots are shown for six runs. On one side of the ball 'NB' is shown for 'No Ball', as some time a bowler fails to ball regularly. On one side of the ball 'W is shown for 'wide ball', as some times a bowler throws a ball wide. By this all the type of bowling and run system is included in a single ball including umpiring.<br>
The outer diameter of the ball is suitable to play a home game. Preferably the outer diameter of the ball rages from 15 mm to 55 mm. The ball can be made up of any material like rubber, lakh, wood, plastic, acrylic, bakelite, aluminum, etc. The ball may be with a hole through it. The inner diameter of the ball also varies.<br>
The size of the playing board is in the measurement of 1 (width) x 1.5 (length). The preferred size of the playing board ranges from 12 inches (width) x 15 inches (length) to 15 x inches (width) x 18 inches (length). The board can be made up of any material like plastic, card board, rubber, wood, paper, etc.<br>
One more important part of the game is a score board Fig. 17, given separately or as one fold with the card of the game. The size of the score board can be set accordingly; preferably it is of 8 inches x 5 inches if given separately else it is of the size according to the board of the game. On the score board two main parts are given each divided into three columns. In each part one column shows serial number of the player, the second column is kept blank to write the name of the player and third column is to write runs of each player during the game and status of the out i.e. run out, catch out, lbw, etc. Below these columns there are rows for extra run of each team and below that there are columns for total runs + extra runs of each team and then final score of each team. At the bottom of the score board there is one more row to note down the overs of each team played.<br>
