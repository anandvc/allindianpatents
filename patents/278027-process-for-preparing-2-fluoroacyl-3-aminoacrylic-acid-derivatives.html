				<td>Process for preparing 2-fluoroacyl-3-aminoacrylic acid derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 2-fluoroacyl-3-aminoacrylic acid derivatives by reacting fluorinated carboxylic acids with dialkylaminoacrylic acid derivatives and acid halides.<br>
2-Fluoroacyl-3-aminoacrylic acid derivatives, for example 2-trifluoromethyl-3-aminoacrylic esters and 2-difluoromethyl-3-aminoacrylic esters, are valuable intermediates for preparing substituted pyrazoles, which may find use as fungicides.<br>
It is already known that trihaloacylated aminoacrylic esters are obtained when the corresponding chloroacroleins are reacted with a substituted amine (cf. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996, 37, 8751 - 8754). However, a disadvantage of this process is that the chloroacroleins used as starting compounds are difficult to prepare and are too expensive for an industrial application.<br>
EP-A-1 000 926 discloses that trihaloacylaminopropenoates are obtained by reacting trihaloaceto-acetates with dialkylformamide acetals. A disadvantage here is that the deacylated compounds occur as by-products and have to be removed from the desired product.<br>
WO-A-03/051820 discloses that 2-perhaloacy 1-3-aminoacrylic acid derivatives can be obtained by reacting 3-aminoacrylic esters with perhaloalkylcarboxylic anhydrides. A disadvantage here is that the preparation of the fluorinated derivatives requires low-boiling and expensive acid chlorides or anhydrides. In the case of use of, for example, trifluoroacetic anhydride, one equivalent of the valuable fluorinated unit is lost.<br>
WO-A-05/042468 teaches a process for preparing 2-dihaloacyl-3-aminoacrylic esters, in which acid halides are used. These acid chlorides are complicated to prepare from the acids. Moreover, their use is difficult owing to the low boiling points.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide novel, economically viable processes for preparing 2-fluoroacyl-3-aminoacrylic acid derivatives proceeding from fluorinated carboxylic acids, which do not have the above-described disadvantages.<br>
The object was achieved in accordance with the present invention by a process for preparing 2-fluoroacy 1-3-aminoacrylic acid derivatives of the general formula (I)<br>

Suitable bases are, for example, tertiary nitrogen bases, for example tertiary amines, substituted or unsubstituted pyridines and substituted or unsubstituted quinolines; alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, hydrogencarbonates or carbonates and other inorganic aqueous bases. Preference is given to using tertiary amines, substituted or unsubstituted pyridines, substituted or unsubstituted quinolines or substituted or unsubstituted imidazoles, and those of the general formula (V)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R10,R11and R12 are each independently C1-12-alkyl, C6-18-aryl, C7-19-alkylaryl- or C7-19-arylalkyl, or in each case two radicals together may also be part of a 5- to 8-membered N-heterocyclic radicals, or all three radicals together may be part of an N-heterobicyclic or N-tricyclic radical having 5 to 9 ring atoms per cycle, which may optionally also contain other heteroatoms, for example oxygen.<br>
Preferred examples of bases of the general formula (V) are triethylamine, trimethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, tri-n-propylamine, tri-n-butylamine, tri-n-hexylamine, tricyclohexylamine, N-<br>
methylcyclohexylamine, N-methylpyrrolidine, N-methylpiperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, N,N-<br>
dimethylaniline, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine, 2-, 3-, 4-picoline, 2-rnethyl-5-ethylpyridine, 2,6-<br>
lutidine, 2,4,6-collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, quinoline, methylimidazole, ethylimidazole,<br>
butylimidazole,	quinaldine,	N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine,        N,N-dimethyl-l,4-<br>
diazacyclohexane,	N,N-diethyl-1,4-diazacyclohexane,	1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene,<br>
diazabicylooctane (DABCO), diazabicyclononane (DBN) and diazabicycloundecane (DBU). Preference is further given to alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates or hydrogencarbonates, for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate and potassium hydrogencarbonate. The inorganic base may optionally be used in the form of an aqueous solution in concentrations between 10 and 40%.<br>
Particular preference is given to using triethylamine, tributylamine, methylimidazole, butylimidazole, pyridine, 2-, 3-, 4-picoline, 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine, 2,6-lutidine, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.<br>
The molar ratio of base to fluorinated carboxylic acid used may, for example, be 0.5 to 10, preferably 1 to 8, more preferably 1.5 to 6.<br>
The use of greater amounts of base is uncritical but uneconomic.<br>
The process according to the invention is performed, for example, at temperatures of-30 to 130°C, preferably between 10 and 60°C.<br>
The process according to the invention is generally performed under standard pressure. However, it is possible to work under elevated pressure or in vacuo.<br>
Solvents<br>
The reaction can be performed in bulk or in a solvent. Preference is given to performing the reaction in a solvent. Suitable solvents are, for example, selected from the group consisting of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example n-hexane, benzene, toluene and xylene, which may be substituted by fluorine and chlorine atoms, such as methylene chloride, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene; ethers, for example diethyl ether, diphenyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, isopropyl ethyl ether, dioxane, diglyme, dimethylglycol or THF; nitriles such as methyl nitrile, butyl nitrile or phenyl nitrile; DMF, N,N-dimethylacetamide, preference being given to toluene.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, the base is initially charged with<br>
the fluorinated carboxylic acid in a solvent or in bulk, then the dialkylaminoacrylic acid derivative is added and admixed with the carbonyl chloride. It is also possible to initially charge the base with the carbonyl chloride in a solvent or in bulk, then to add the dialkylaminoacrylic acid derivative and admix with the fluorinated carboxylic acid.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the base is initially charged with the fluorinated carboxylic acid in a solvent or in bulk, then the carbonyl chloride is added and admixed with the dialkylaminoacrylic acid derivative.<br>
Alternatively, the base can also replace the solvent. This is preferable especially when the salt of the base used is also liquid under the prevailing reaction conditions.<br>
For the workup, the procedure may be, for example, to remove any precipitated salts, for example by filtration, centrifugation or sedimentation and decantation, and to either directly further react the reaction solution thus obtained or to obtain the 2-fluoroacyl-3-aminoacrylic acid derivatives by concentrating, preferably to dryness. If appropriate, the resulting 2-fluoroacyl-3-aminoacrylic acid derivatives may also be purified by distillation. A further workup method can be effected by addition of water to the reaction mixture and subsequent phase separation.<br>
The process according to the invention for preparing 2-fiuoroacyl-3-aminoacrylic acid derivatives is described in the examples which follow, which further illustrate the above description. However, the examples should not be interpreted in a limiting manner.<br>
Preparation examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
To a solution of 32.7 g of triethylamine in 60 ml of toluene are added, at room temperature, first 11.6 g of difluoroacetic acid and then 14.35 g of ethyl dimethylaminoacrylate. 28 g of trimethylacetyl chloride are metered into this solution which is stirred at room temperature for 8 h. The reaction mixture is poured onto 30 ml of water, the organic phase is removed, the organic phase is washed with 20 ml of water, and the combined aqueous phases are extracted once again with 10 ml of toluene. The combined organic phases are concentrated under reduced pressure. This affords 21 g (94% of theory) of ethyl 2-(difluoroacetyl)-3-(dimethylamino)acrylate.<br>
Example 2<br>
To a solution of 17.8 g of triethylamine in 50 ml of toluene are added, at room temperature, first 5.7 g of trifluoroacetic acid and then 7.23 g of ethyl dimethylaminoacrylate. 14 g of trimethylacetyl chloride are metered into this solution which is stirred at room temperature for 6 h. The reaction mixture is poured onto 20 ml of water, the organic phase is removed, the organic phase is washed with 20 ml of water, and the combined aqueous phases are extracted once again with 10 ml of toluene. The combined organic phases are concentrated under reduced pressure. This affords 10.7 g (90 % of theory) of ethyl 2-(trifluoroacetyl)-3-(dimethylamino)acrylate.<br>
Example 3<br>
To a solution of 17.8 g of triethylamine in 50 ml of toluene are added, at room temperature, first 4.8 g of difluoroacetic acid and then 7.23 g of ethyl dimethylaminoacrylate. 16.3 g of benzoyl chloride are metered into this solution which is stirred at room temperature for 6 h. The reaction mixture is filtered and poured onto 30 ml of water, the organic phase is removed, the organic phase is washed with 20 ml of water, and the combined aqueous phases are extracted once again with 10 ml of toluene. The combined organic phases are concentrated under reduced pressure. This affords ethyl 2-(difluoroacetyl)-3-(dimethylamino)acrylate in a yield of 81 %.<br>
Example 4<br>
To a solution of 298 g of 1-methyl-lH-imidazole in 560 ml of toluene are added, at room temperature (RT), first 97 g of difluoroacetic acid and then 144 g of ethyl dimethylaminoacrylate. 304 g of trimethylacetyl chloride are metered into this solution which is stirred at RT for 2 h. After the reaction has ended, the phases are separated, the lower phase is extracted once with 50 ml of toluene and the combined organic phases are concentrated under reduced pressure. This affords ethyl 2-(difluoroacetyl)-3-(dimethylamino)acrylate in a yield of 91%.<br>
