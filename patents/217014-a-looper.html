				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a looper for measuring the wedge proportion of a longitudinal pull present within a strip in the longitudinal direction of the strip, wherein the wedge proportion extends across the strip width.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
A looper is known from the publication "Development of new high performance loopers for hot strip mills", Iron and Steel Engineer, June 1997, pp. 64 to 70, which comprises two dynamometers for measuring a force exerted onto the looper which corresponds to the longitudinal pull. Nothing is disclosed in this article in regard to the arrangement of the dynamometers and the general configuration of the looper.<br>
From German patent document 197 15 523 Al a measuring device for determining flatness is known which has a plurality of measuring rolls. The measuring rolls are individually supported on pivot arms which are connected to a looper shaft. By rotating the looper shaft the measuring rolls can be adjusted relative to the strip. The pivot arms are divided by joints into a shaft portion and a roll portion wherein the joints deflect restoring forces, exerted by the strip onto the measuring rolls and corresponding to the longitudinal pull, onto the dynamometers arranged on the respective pivot arm.<br>
A looper is disclosed in the document DE 2618901. A looper for hot rolling machine is disclosed in the document JP52120946. A device for measuring the flatness of metal strips is disclosed in the document DE 2633351.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a looper having a simple configuration with which the wedge proportion, extending across the strip width, of the longitudinal pull can be measured.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, this is achieved in that:<br>
the looper has a continuous looper roll extending across the strip width and being supported on both sides on a pivot arm, respectively;<br>
the pivot arms are connected with a looper shaft;<br>
when rotating the looper shaft the looper roll can be adjusted relative to the strip;<br>
the pivot arms are divided by a joint into a looper shaft arm and a looper roll arm;<br>
each joint deflects a restoring force, exerted by the strip onto the looper roll and corresponding to the longitudinal pull, onto the dynamometer arranged on the pivot arm, respectively.<br>
When the looper roll arm is formed as a plate or as a lever frame, the looper is of an even more simplified construction.<br>
When the looper shaft arm and the looper roll arm are connected to one another in the proximity of the dynamometer via a securing element, it is reliably prevented that the looper roll arm can lift of the dynamometer.<br>
When the joint, the looper roll, and the dynamometer define a triangle with three sides and the securing element is arranged outside of this triangle, the securing element is exposed to comparatively low forces.<br>
When the triangle is formed as a substantially isosceles triangle, a low mechanical loading of the looper roll arm results.<br>
The loading of the looper roll arm can be further minimized when the triangle is formed as a substantially rectangular (right) triangle.<br>
When one of the sides of the triangle is positioned opposite the joint and this side is longer than the two other sides of the triangle, the forces exerted onto the looper roll arm are particularly minimal.<br><br>
When the looper shaft arm is at least as long as the looper roll arm, the looper is provided with a large adjusting range.<br>
The mechanical loading is minimized when the dynamometer has a force axis and the looper roll arm performs a movement in the area of the dynamometer which is essentially parallel to the force axis.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a looper for measuring a wedge proportion of a longitudinal pull present within the longitudinal direction of the strip, running across a strip width, with a continuous looper roll that stretches across the strip width and is supported at both sides on a pivot arm, wherein each of the pivot arms are connected to a looper shaft, characterized in that the looper roll is engaged at the strip by twisting the looper shaft, wherein the pivot arms are respectively divided by a joint into a shaft arm and a looper roll arm and wherein the joint turns around at a dynamometer, each located at the respective pivot arm, with a reset force exerted from the strip onto the looper roll, corresponding to the longitudinal pull, wherein the joint, the looper roll and the dynamometer together form a triangle with three sides, wherein the dynamometer exhibits a force axis and the looper roll arm executes a movement in the region of the dynamometer that is essentially directed parallel to the force axis, wherein the shaft arm and the looper roll arm are connected to one another by a securing element in order to prevent the looper roll arm from lifting from the dynamometer in the vicinity of the dynamometer and the looper shaft is constructed with an excentrically engaging adjusting drive.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
In the drawing : FIG. 1 is a schematic perspective view of a pull measuring arrangement;<br>
FIG. 2 shows schematically a strip with a looper from above; and<br>
FIG. 3 shows the looper of FIG. 2 from the side. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
According to FIG. 1, the metal strip 1 is guided from an outlet device 2 via a looper roll 3 to an inlet device 4. The outlet device 2 and the inlet device 4 can form together, for example, a roll stand or driver. The metal strip 1 is preferably a hot or cold rolled steel strip. It has a strip width b. The looper roll 3 according to FIG. 1 is formed as a continuous looper roll. It extends across the entire strip width b.<br><br>
In the metal strip 1 a longitudinal pull is present in the longitudinal direction of the strip which is indicated in FIG. 1 by arrows A. The longitudinal pull has a wedge proportion across the strip width b which is illustrated in FIG. 1 by the different size of the arrows A. The looper roll 3 can be adjusted relative to the metal strip 1. This is indicated in FIG. 1 by the arrow B.<br>
According to FIG. 2, the looper roll 3 is supported on both sides on a pivot arm 5. The pivot arms 5 are connected to a looper shaft 6. Accordingly, by rotation of the looper shaft 6, the looper roll 3 can be advanced or adjusted relative to the metal strip 1.<br>
The pivot arms 5 are divided by a joint 7 into a looper shaft arm 8 and a looper roll arm 9. According to FIG. 2, the looper roll arms 9 are plates or lever frames. The term plate refers to a massive support element while the term lever frame refers to a support element that has two plates which are separated from one another by an intermediate space. It should additionally be mentioned that in practice both looper roll arms 9 are generally of the same construction. The different embodiment of the looper roll arms 9 in FIG. 2 is provided only for illustration purposes.<br>
According to FIG. 3, each one of the pivot arms 5 has a dynamometer 10 arranged on the looper shaft arm 8, wherein the dynamometer 10 rests against the looper roll arm 9. The dynamometer 10 is eccentrically arranged relative to the joint 7. Accordingly, the joint 7 deflects the restoring force, exerted by the metal strip 1 onto the looper roll 3, onto the dynamometer 10 arranged on the looper shaft arm 8, respectively.<br>
The restoring force corresponds to the longitudinal pull. Based on the measured restoring forces, the longitudinal pull can thus be determined. Accordingly, the individual longitudinal pull is measured for each of the two dynamometers 10 of the two pivot arms 5 based on the restoring force exerted thereon. The sum of the thus determined longitudinal pull provides the total longitudinal pull present within the metal strip 1. The difference of the two thus determined longitudinal pulls provides the wedge proportion which the longitudinal pull has across the strip width b.<br>
Based on the total longitudinal pull as well as based on the wedge proportion the outlet device 2 and/or the inlet device 4 can be readjusted. For example, it is possible to control or readjust, based on the total longitudinal pull, the rotational speed and, based on the wedge<br><br>
proportion,   at   least   an   adjustment   of   at   least   one   of   the   two   devices   2,   4.<br>
According to FIG. 3, the joint 7, the looper roll 3, and the dynamometer 10 define a triangle with three sides X, Y, and Z. In this context, the terms joint 7 and looper roll 3 refer to the respective rotational axes, while the term dynamometer 10 refers to the contact point of the dynamometer 10 at the looper roll arm 9. The rotational axes and the contact point define the comers of the triangle.<br>
It is illustrated that the triangle is substantially a right or rectangular triangle, substantially embodied as an isosceles triangle. The hypotenuse Z of the triangle is positioned opposite the joint 7. This side Z is thus longer than the two other sides X, Y. In this connection, "substantially" means that the right angle of the triangle can be between 80° and 100° and the lengths of the two identical legs of the triangle can differ from one another by maximally 10%.<br>
The dynamometer 10 has a force axis 12. The dynamometer 10 thus only measures forces which are directed parallel to the force axis 12. The looper roll arm 9 is formed such that in the area of the dynamometer 10 it performs a movement which is directed essentially parallel to the force axis 12. In this context, "substantially" means that the movement direction of the looper  roll  arm  9  has   an  angle  of maximally   10.degree,   with  the   force  axis   12.<br>
In the vicinity of the dynamometer 10 but outside of the triangle a securing element 13 is arranged. By means of the securing element 13 the looper shaft arm 8 and the looper roll arm 9 are connected with one another. This prevents the looper roll arm 9 from lifting off the dynamometer 10.<br>
The looper roll arm 9 is at least as long as the looper shaft arm 8. According to FIG, 3 it is even longer than the looper roll arm 9, in particular, by approximately 20% to 100%. The length of the looper shaft arm 8 is determined by the spacing of the axis of rotation of the looper shaft 6 from the axis of rotation of the joint 7. The length of the looper roll arm 9 is defined by the spacing of the axis of rotation of the looper roll 3 from the axis of rotation of the joint 7.<br>
Based on the comparatively large length of the looper shaft arm 8, a large adjusting range of the looper results when rotating the looper shaft 6. The rotation of the looper shaft 6 is carried<br><br>
out in this connection by means of an adjusting drive 14. The adjusting drive 14 according to FIG. 3 can be embodied as an eccentrically engaging hydraulic cylinder unit.<br>
With the looper according to the invention a reliable measurement of the total longitudinal pull as well as of the wedge proportion extending across the strip width b of the longitudinal pull present within the metal strip 1 is possible. The configuration of the looper is in this connection simple, robust, and not prone to failure. Especially, it is not required to segment the   looper   roll   3   and   to   correlate   each   individual   segment   with   a   dynamometer.<br>
While specific embodiments of the invention have been shown and described in detail to illustrate the inventive principles, it will be understood that the invention may be embodied otherwise without departing from such principles.<br><br><br>
