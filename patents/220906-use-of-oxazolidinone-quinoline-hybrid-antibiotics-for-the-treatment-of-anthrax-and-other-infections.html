Use of oxazolidinone-quinoline hybrid antibiotics for the treatment of anthrax and other infections The present invention<br>
describes the use of compounds in which the pharmacophores of quinolone and oxazolidinone are chemically linked together<br>
through a linker that is stable under physiological conditions for the treatment of anthrax and other infections.<br>
Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax most commonly<br>
occurs in wild and domestic lower vertebrates (cattle, sheep, goats, camels, antelopes, and other herbivores), but it can also<br>
occur in humans when they are exposed to infected, animals or tissue from infected animals.<br>
Bacillus anthracis, the etiologic agent of anthrax, isa large, gram-positive,, noiirmotile, spore-forming bacterial rod,<br>
The three virulence factors of B. anthracis are edema toxin, lethal toxin and a capsular antigen. Human anthrax has three major<br>
clinical forms: cutaneous, inhalation, and gastrointestinal. If left untreated, anthrax in all forms can lead to septicemia and death.<br>
Recently, anthrax has become of considerable interest, because it is considered to be a potential agent for use in biological<br>
warfare.<br>
The present invention provides the use of compounds of Formula (I) for the treatment of anthrax and other infections;<br><br><br><br>

The present invention also relates to pharmacologically acceptable salts, or solvates and hydrates, respectively, and to<br>
compositions and formulations of compounds of Formula (I), (II), or (III). The present invention describes procedures to produce<br>
pharmaceutical^ useful agents, which contain these compounds, as well as the use of these compounds for the production of<br>
pharmaceutical^ useful agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention contain at least one compound of Formula (1), (II) or (III) as<br>
the active agent and optionally carriers and/pr diluents and/or adjuvants. Optionally the pharmaceutical compositions according<br>
to the present invention may also contain additional known antibiotics.<br>
Examples of pharmacologically acceptable salts of sufficiently basic compounds of Formula (I) and of compounds of Formula<br>
(It) or (III) are salts of physiologically ac- ceptable mineral acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sul- furic and phosphoric acid; or<br>
6<br><br>
salts of organic acids like methanesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, lactic, acetic, triftuoro- acetic, citric, succinic, fumaric, maleic and salicylic acid.<br>
Further, a sufficiently acidic compound of Formula (I) may form alkali or earth alkaline metal salts, for example sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium or magnesium salts; ammonium salts; or.organic base salts, for example methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamtne, ethylenediamine, ethanblamine, choline hydroxide, meglumin, piperidine, morpholine, tris- (2-hydroxyethyl) amine, lysiqe or arginine salts; all of which are also further examples of salts of Formula (II) or (III). Compounds of Formula (I), (II) or (III) may be solvated, especially hydrated. The hydratisation can occur during the process of production or as a consequence of the hygroscopic nature of the initially water free compounds of Formula (I), (II) or (III). The compounds of Formula (I), (II) or (111) contain asymmetric C-atoms and may be present either as achiral compounds, mixtures of diastereomers, mixtures of enantiomers or as optically pure compounds.<br>
The present invention also relates to pro-drugs which are composed of a compound of Formula (I), (II) or (111) and at least one pharmacologically acceptable protective group which will be cleaved off under physiological conditions, such as an alkoxy-, aralkyloxy-, acyl-, acyloxymethyl group (e. g.pivaloyloxymethyl), an 2-alkyl"v2-aryl-or 2-aralkyl- oxycarbonyl-2-alkylidene ethyl group or an acyfoxy group as defined herein, e. g. ethoxy, benzyloxy, acetyl or acetyloxy or, especially for a compound of Formula (I), for hydroxy group (ROH), a sulfate, a phosphate (ROP03 or ROCH20PO3) or an ester of an amino acid. Especially preferred are pro-drugs of the hydroxy group of a compound of Formula (II) or (III) wherein R7 is H. As mentioned above, therapeutically useful agents that contain compounds of Formula (I), (II) or (III), their solvates, salts or formulations are also comprised in the scope of the present invention. In general, compounds of Formula (I), (II) or (111) will be administered by using the known and acceptable modes known in the art, either alone or in combination with any other therapeutic agent. Such therapeutically useful agents can be administered by one of the following routes: oral, e. g. as tablets, dragees, coated tablets, pills, semisolids, soft or hard capsules, for example soft and hard gelatine capsules, aqueous or oily solutions, emulsions, suspensions or syrups, parenteral including intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection, e. g. as an injectable solution or suspension, rectal as suppositories, by inhalation or insufflation, e. g. as a powder formulation, as microcrystals or as a spray (e. g. liquid aerosol), trans- dermal, for example via an transdermal delivery system (TDS) such as a plaster containg the active ingredient or intranasal. For the production of such tablets, pills, semisolids, coated tablets, dragees and hard, e. g. gelatine, capsules the therapeutically useful product may be mixed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients as are e. g. lactose, sucrose, glucose, gelatin, malt, silica gel, starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearinic acid or their salts, dried skim milk, and the like. For the production of soft capsules one may use excipients as are e, g. vegetable, petroleum, animal or synthetic oils, wax, fat, polyols. For the production of liquid solutions, emulsions or suspensions or syrups one may use as excipients e. g. water, alcohols, aqueous saline, aqueous dextrose, polyols, glycerin, lipids, phospholipids, cyclodextrins, vegetable, petroleum, animal or synthetic oils. Especially preferred are lipids and more preferred are phospholipids (preferred of natural origin; especially preferred with a particle size between 300 to 350 nm) preferred in phosphate buffered saline (pH = 7 to 8, preferred 7.4). For suppositories one may use excipients as are e. g. vegetable, petroleum, animal or synthetic oils, wax, fat and polyols. For aerosol formulations one may use compressed gases suitable for this purpose, as are e. g. oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The pharmaceutically useftil agents may also contain additives for conservation, stabilisation, e. g. UV stabilizers, emulsifiers, sweetener, aromatisers, salts to change the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating additives and antioxidants.<br>
A daily dosage per patient of about 1 mg to about 4000 mg especially about 50 mg to 3 g is usual with those of ordinary skill in the art appreciating that the dosage will depend also upon the age, conditions of the mammals, and the kind of diseases being treated or prevented. The daily dosage can be administrated in a single dose or can be divided over several doses. An average single dose of about 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg and 2000 mg can be contemplated. The invention also relates to a method of treating a disorder selected from a bacterial infection, a protozoal infection, and disorders related to bacterial infections or protozoal infections, in a mammal, fish, or bird which comprises administering to the mammal, fish or bird a combination comprising a compound of Formula (I), (ll) or (III) and another antibiotic, wherein the amounts of the compound and of the other antibiotic are together therapeutically effective in treating the disorder. In further embodiments, the compound of the invention may administered prior to, with or after the other antibiotic.
