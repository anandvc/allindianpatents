DESCRIPTION CYCLQALKYL-SUBSTITUTED AMINOMETHYLPRBROLIDINE DERIVATIVE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a synthetic quinolone antibacterial agent useful as a drug for humans,  animals or fishes or an antibacterial preservative-<br>
This invention also relates to a synthetic cpiinolone antibacterial agent in which the structure of substituent at the 7-position of l,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline skeleton or at the 10-position of 2,3"dihydro-7*oxo-7H-pyrido[l,2,3-de] [1.4]benzoxazine skeleton exerts inportant influence xxpan the expression of pharmacological effects such as ari-hTVurH-^-iHai activity, pharmacokinetics and safety, having a 3-[1-amino-l-cycloalkyl]methylpyrrolidin-l-yl qroup  which can provide excellent antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics and safety, as a sxabstituent at the 7- or 10-position, and also having excellent antibacterial activity, proper pharmacokinetics and high safety, namely to a 6-fluoro-l-[2-(S)-fluoro-l-(R)-cyclopropyl] -1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carbo3^1ic acid derivative or a 2,3-dihydro-3- (S) -methyl"7-oxo-7H-pyrido [1,2,3-de] [1,4]benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid derivative, and to an antibacterial agent and an antibacterial preparation, which con^tain the con5&gt;ound.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br><br>
Since the discovery of Norfloxacin, antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of synthetic qainolone antibacterial agents have been isproved, and many ccopoiinds are now used in the clinical field as chemotherapeutic agents which are effective in almost systemic infectious diseases.<br>
In recent years, generation of bacteria having low sensitivity to synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents has been increasing in the field of clinics. For exarnple, like the case of Staphylococcus aureus  (ME^SA) and pneumococcus (FR5P) idiich are non-sensitive to p-lactam antibiotics and enterococcus (VBE) which is non-sensitive to aminoglycoside antibacterial agents, a case has been increasing in which a Gram-positive bacterium originally resistant to drugs other than synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents becomes low-sensitive to synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents too. In consequence, development of a drug having further high efficacy has been called for in the field of clinics.    On the other hand, it has been revealed that synthetic quinolone antibacterial agents cause a side effect in which convulsion is induced when a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug is simultaneously used, as well as other side effects such as phototoxicity, so that development of a synthetic quinolone antibacterial agent having further high safety has also been called for in the field.<br>
It is known that structures of substituents at the 7-position and 1-position have a great influence to the antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics and safety of synthetic<br><br>
quinolone antibacterial agents. It is already known that guinolone derivatives having 3-ami ncanethylpyrrolidine as a STabstituent show strong antibacterial activity for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. For example, a 7"(3-ami nomethylpyrrolidin-1-yl) cjainolonecarboxylic acid derivative is described in Journal of Medicinal Cbesaistxy,  vol. 29, p. 445 (1986), a 7-[3-(l-amino-l-methylethyl)pyrrolidin-l-yl) quinolonecarbo3cylic acid derivative is described in JovumaZ of Medicinal Chemistry,  vol. 37, p. 733 (1994), and a 7-[3-(l-aminoal3cyl)pyrrolidi n-l-yl] cpainolonecarboacylic acid derivative is described in riitfgm'/^ja? £ Pharmacenit.ifvi7 Bulletin,  vol. 42, p. 1442 (1994) . However, no compounds are known which have a 3-(l-amino-l-cycloalkyl)inethylpyridin-l-yl group at the 7-position and are also related to the present invention.<br>
On the other hand, quinolone derivatives having 3-aminosnethylpyrrolidine as a substituent are compounds which show strong antibacterial activity, but, since most of these confounds have low selective toxicity, they act upon not only bacteria but also eucaryotic cells so that it is difficult to use them as medical drugs or animal drugs.<br>
Also, it is known that quinolone derivatives having a 3-aminops'xrolidine derivative at the 7-position and 2- (S) -f luoro-1- (R) -cyclopropyl groi^ at the 1-position of the quinoline skeleton have weaker micronucleus inducing toxicity than those corresponding 1-cyclopropylquinolone derivatives. Their exanples are described in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,   vol.<br><br>
37. P, 3344 (1994).<br>
On the other hand, quinolonecarhojcylic acid derivatives having a 3-[l-amino-l"Cycloal]cyl]inethylpyrrolidin-l-yl grox:tp as a substituent, which are related to the present invention, are exen5&gt;lified for example in JP-W-3-502452 (the term "JP-W" as used herein means an ^^unexaznined published Japanese international patent application") , and it describes compounds represented by a formula (a) or (b) shown below. However, substituent at the 5-position of these exeartplified quinolones is limited to a straight, branched or cyclic lower alkyl having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and JP-W-3-502452 does not describe compounds having the l-[2-(S)-fluoro-l-(R)-cycloprppyl]quinoline skeleton or 3- (S) -methyl-7H-pyrido[1,2,3-de] [1.4]benzoxa2ine skeleton related to the present invention. In addition, JP-W-3-502452 does not disclose illustrative examples of the 3-[1-amino-l-cycloalJc^l ] methylpyrrolidin-1 -yl group. Formula (a)<br><br>
[In the above formula, R7 is an alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a vinyl, a haloalkyl, a hydroxyalkyl having 2 to 4 carbon atcms, a cycloaikyl having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenyl or a phenyl substituted with a halogen, an alkyl, NH2 or OH, Re is a<br><br>

DefdLnitions of substituents of the cooqpound of formula (a) are independent to those the compound of the present invention.]<br>

In addition, PCT WD 96/39407 discloses compounds represented by the following formula (c) , but they are limited to 2-pyridone derivatives such as 4H-4-oxoquinotozone skeleton, and PCT WO 96/39407 does not describe conpounds having the 1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline skeleton or 2,3-dihydro"3-(S)-ethyl-7-oxo"7H-pyrido [1,2,3-de] [1.4] benzoxazine skeleton related to the<br><br>
present invention. Also, PCT WO 96/39407 does not disclose illustrative examples of optically active 3-[l"aniino-l-cyclqprppyl]inethylpyrrolidin-l-yl group.<br>
