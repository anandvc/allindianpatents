FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a tool holder which is used with being attached to a rotary part of a working machine, and more particularly to a tool holder which is used with attaching the basal side of a shaft of the tool holder to a rotary part of a working machine, which has a holding portion for holding a tool such as a cutting tool, in the tip end side of the shaft, and which can correct runout of a tip end portion of the tool such as a cutting tool attached to the holding portion.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
When a hole is to be opened in a workpiece or the inner face of a hole is to be ground by using a working machine or the like, a tool such as a cutting tool is attached to the tip end side of a tool holder mounted on a rotary part of the working machine. The tool in the tip end side of the tool holder is rotated at a high speed by rotating the rotary part of the working machine, whereby desired working can be performed on the workpiece for a short time period.<br>
As described above, the tool holder is used in a high speed state. When the tip end of the tool attached to the tip end of the tool holder deflects even at a small degree as a result of the high speed rotation, there arises a problem in that the dimensional accuracy of the hole is lowered or the inner peripheral face of the hole is roughened to disable the hole from being accurately worked.<br>
In order to solve the problem, conventionally, means for correcting<br><br>
vibrations of a shaft of a tool holder is disposed on the tool holder (see Japanese published unexamined Patent application No. 11-104931).<br>
Fig. 12 shows the conventional art example. With reference to the figure, the conventional art example will be described. In a tool holder 1, the basal side 2 of a shaft 3 is formed as a shank portion 2 which is tapered as well known in the art, in order to fit the basal side into a tapered hole lb of the main shaft la of a working machine which is not shown and has a well-known configuration. A holding portion 4 for a tool 4a is disposed in the tip end side of the shaft 3. (Usually, in order to fasteningly fix the tool 4a an example of which is a cutting tool such as a drill, a chuck 4 having a clamping hole which is expandable and contractable is disposed as the holding portion 4, In a well-known configuration, the cutting tool 4a may be attached directly integrally to the shaft 3 in the position of the chuck 4.) A large-diameter flange 5 which is used in the case where a grasping operation is to be performed by a grasping portion of a robot as well known in the art is formed on the outer periphery of the shaft 3 and on the side of the shank portion 2. The reference numeral 5a denotes a groove for engagement.<br>
In the tool holder 1 shown in Fig. 12, plural radial holes 6 are threadedly formed in a bottom of the groove 5a of the flange 5, and a male screw 7 which is a screw member serving as a mass is screwed into each of the holes 6. A hexagonal hole 8 for a hexagonal wrench is formed in the head of each of the male screws 7. Each male screw 7 is adjusted so as to advance or retract in the corresponding hole 6 by using a wrench, so that, when the tool holder 1 is rotated at a high speed, the positional change in a radial direction appears as a change of the mass, whereby vibrations of the shaft 3 of the tool holder 1 can be corrected.<br><br>
Even when vibrations of the shaft are corrected in a portion of the shaft 3 of the tool holder 1, the shaft center may sometimes deflect in a position closer to the tool attaching portion 4 in the tip end. Therefore, male screws 9 which similarly serve as a mass are attached to a tip end portion 3 a so as to be advanceable and retractable, so that vibrations of the shaft in the tip end portion 3a can be corrected by advancing or retracting each of the male screws 9.<br>
In the conventional art described above, however, the means for correcting vibrations of a shaft can correct vibrations of the shaft, only in a place where the correcting means is disposed and in the vicinity of the place.<br>
In the case of a long tool such as a drill 4a which protrudes by a large distance from the tool attaching portion 4, the portion where correction of runout of the shaft center with respect to the rotation center is required at the highest degree is a blade edge 4b which is in the tip end of the drill. In the conventional ^ described above, however, it is impossible to correct runout of the shaft center with respect to the rotation center in a portion which largely protrudes from the tool attaching portion 4, such as the blade edge 4b in the tip end of the drill.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a tool holder having runout correcting means for displacing an axis C of a tip end side of a shaft by a simple operation of rotating a screw member for pressurizing a part of the shaft, whereby a center of a tip end of a tool attached to a protruding tip end portion is made coincident with the rotation center Ca of the tool holder.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a tool holder in which a screw member for displacing the axis C of the tip end side of a shaft is disposed<br><br>
in at least three or more uniform positions in the periphery of the main shaft of the tool holder, whereby, even when the shaft center of a cutting tool serving as a tool deflects in any direction, the tip end of the cutting tool can be moved to the rotation center of the tool holder irrespective of the direction.<br>
It is a fiirther object of the invention to provide a tool holder in which, even in a case where a screw member is disposed in one place, the position of the tip end of the cutting tool can be fi-eely changed in either of leftward and rightward directions in accordance with the direction of rotation of the screw member.<br>
It is a still fiirther object of the invention to provide a runout correcting tool which is requested only to be attached to the periphery of a shaft of a tool holder that is already completed, whereby the tool holder can be changed to a tool holder having runout correcting means for displacing the axis C of the tip end side of the shaft to make the center of the tip end of a tool attached to a holding portion with largely protruding therefrom, coincident with the rotation center Ca of the tool holder.<br>
Other objects and advantages will easily become apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following description relating to the drawings.<br>
The invention has the following feature. A tool is attached to a holding portion at a tip end portion of a shaft. In the case where a drilling or cutting work is to be conducted, even when the position of the tip end of the tool is laterally shifted to deviate from the rotation center of a tool holder, a screw member is rotated to generate a force of displacing the axis of the tip end side of the shaft, between two contact portions of the tool holder, whereby the position of a blade edge of the tool can be easily moved toward the rotation center of the<br><br>
tool holder so as to coincide therewith. According to this configuration, it is possible to attain an effect that, in the case where a drilling or cutting work is to be conducted by rotating the tool holder at a high speed, precision working can be accurately performed.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a tool holder comprising an attaching portion to be attached to a rotary part of a working machine and disposed on a basal side of a shaft, and a holding portion for holding a tool at a tip end side of said shaft, wherein at an outer peripheral portion of said shaft a first contact portion and a second contact portion are set at positions separate from each other in a longitudinal direction of the shaft; said first contact portion is formed of a front wall face of a flange of the shaft; said second contact portion is formed of an inclined face around the shaft; an annular member is disposed around an outer periphery of said second contact portion of said shaft; a side face of said annular member is an abutting portion adapted to abut against said first contact portion; a female screw hole is disposed in said annular member from an outer peripheral side to an inner periphery of the annular member, and a screw member is threadedly engaged with said female screw hole, so as to be advanceably and retractably movable toward said inclined face serving as said second contact portion; the advance positions of tip end portions of said screw member are set toward said inclined face so that by rotating and advancing said screw member, said abutting portion abuts against said first contact portion, and a force is generated between said first contact portion and said second contact portion, said force causing an axis of said tip end side of said shaft to be displaced by bending in relafion to said basal side end of said shaft; characterized in that female screw holes are provided at least at three uniform positions around the periphery of said annular member and screw members are threadedly engaged with said female screw holes, respectively;<br><br>
and by advancing and rotating said screw members; said tip end portions are caused to abut against said inclined face and press said inclined face.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a section view of a tool holder 10 which is a first embodiment of the invention, and (A) of Fig. 2 is a section view taken along the line II-II of Fig. 1. In Fig. 2, (B) and (C) are views showing examples in which the number of screw members 24 is changed. Fig. 3 is an enlarged view of the runout correcting means shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Although a configurations of components denoted by reference numerals 10 to 18 in Figs. 1 to 5 are well known in the same manner as a tool holder 1 shown in Fig. 12, the configurations will be described below. As well known in the art, the tool holder 10 comprises a shaft 13 having a hollow portion 13a serving as a main unit. A flange 11 is disposed on an outer periphery of the shaft 13. A tapered shank portion 12 which protrudes in a rearward direction or toward a basal portion is disposed in back of the flange 11. The portion 12 serves as an attaching portion which is to be attached to a rotary part of a working machine.<br>
In a front position with respect to the flange 11, a diameter of the shaft 13<br><br>
is very smaller than that of the flange 11 (occasionally, the shaft may be larger in diameter than the flange 11).   A step lib is formed in front of the flange 11. As well known in the art, the shaft 13 is formed into a slender hollow cylindrical shape (occasionally, the shaft may be solid).   A holding portion 14 for holding a tool 17 is disposed in a tip end side of the shaft.<br>
The holding portion 14 is a portion which is well known as a chuck, and as well known fasteningly fixes a basal portion of a drill 17 which is an example of a cutting tool inserted into a center hole 14a of the holding portion 14, by using a collet chuck 15a, a clamp ring 15, etc.<br>
In the holding portion 14, the thickness as a whole is not even because of the thickness of the shaft in the holding portion 14, and production errors of the collet chuck (contract ring) 15a, the clamp ring 15, etc. As a result, a position of a tool tip end 18 is laterally shifted with respect to a rotation center Ca of the tool holder 10 to deviate from the rotation center Ca of the tool holder. When the drill 17 is rotated at a high speed under such a state, the blade edge 18 at the tip end of the drill 17 deflects. This state of runout is such a state that the blade edge 18 at the tip end of the drill 17 deflects in both a direction of an arrow S in Fig. 1 and a direction of depth in Fig. 1 when the blade edge 18 is rotated around the rotation center Ca centering around the center Ca. In such runout state, precision working becomes disabled.<br>
In the embodiment, therefore, a runout correcting tool 20 is detachably disposed on the outer peripheral face of the shaft 13. The runout correcting tool 20 has a main unit which is made of a metal material having substantial thickness and weight, and which is configured as a ring-like member (annular member) 21 so as to be fittable onto the outer periphery of the shaft 13.<br><br>
A screw member 24 is screwed advanceably and retractably with a tapped hole 23 which is formed from an outer periphery of the annular member 21 to an inner periphery. The screw member 24 configured by a male screw is passed by the whole length through the tapped hole 23 via a well-known operation groove disposed in a head 24b. Even when the tapped hole 23 with which the screw member 24 is screwed is formed only in one place of the periphery of the annular member 21, the tip end 18 of the tool 17 can be adjusted with respect to runout. However, it is preferable that such a tapped hole is formed in three or more places in a circumferential direction of the periphery of the shaft (see (B) and (C) of Fig. 2). When these holes are respectively formed in uniform positions, adjustment of "runout" of the center of the tip end 18 of the tool can be performed very easily and rapidly.<br>
An abutting portion 28 which is to abut against a first contact portion 26 disposed in the outer periphery of the shaft 13 is formed on one side face of the annular member 21.   The first contact portion 26 is formed in the step lib. Namely, the one side face 28 of the annular member 21 is caused to abut against the front wall face 26 of the flange.<br>
A tip end 29 of the screw member 24 can abut against a second contact portion 27 which is disposed in a position separated in the longitudinal direction from the first contact portion 26. The second contact portion 27 is configured by cuttingly forming an annular U-groove 22 in the outer peripheral face of the shaft 13.<br>
The two contact portions (26 and 27) are pressurized by rotating the screw member 24 to generate a force F of displacing the axis C of the tip end side of the shaft 13, between the portions.<br><br>
When the tip end portion 29 of the screw member is in press contact with the shaft 13, a reaction force of the shaft 13 causes the end face 28 of the annular member 21 and the side end face 26 of the flange 11 to be in press contact with each other, so that the annular member 21 and the shaft 13 are firmly fixed to each other. In the embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3, when the flange side end face 28 of the annular member 21 abuts against the end face 26 of the flange 11, i.e., in the press contact state in which the annular member 21 cannot be moved toward the flange 11, the through hole 23 is positioned so that its center is slightly deviated from a center 22a of the U-groove 22 toward the holding portion 14.<br>
When the screw member 24 is screwed and the tip end portion 29 of the screw member enters the U-groove 22, therefore, the screw tip end portion 29 abuts against only the inclined face (second contact portion) 27 of the U-groove 22 on the side of the holding portion 14, and does not abut against an inclined face on the side of the flange 11. As a result, when the screw member 24 is screwed into the tapped hole 23 to perform a fastening operation, the screwing force (in Fig. 3, the force directed toward the shaft center C of the tool holder 10) is caused by the ftinction of the inclined face 27 to have a force in the direction indicated by F in Fig. 3, i.e., a component of force which bends the portion of the shaft 13 on the side of the holding portion 14 in the direction of the arrow Fa.<br>
The reference numeral 30 denotes an annular cover which is placed on the outer periphery of the annular member in order to prevent the screw member 24 from jumping out. An end portion of the cover is detachably fixed to the shaft 13. The reference numeral 31 denotes an operation hole which has a diameter smaller than the screw head 24b, and which is positioned in the outer peripheral<br><br>
side of the screw head 24b.<br>
In the case where the drill 17 is attached to the thus configured tool holder 10 and then rotated, when the position of the blade edge 18 of the drill deviates from the rotation center axis Ca as shown in Fig. 4, the center portion of the tip end 18 of the tool 17 is made coincident with the rotation center Ca of the tool holder. In this case, as shown Figs. 3 and 5, the shaft 13 is bent by adjusting the fastening force (the press contacting force on the inclined face 27) of each of the three (or more) screw members 24 shown in Fig. 2, to displace the axis C in the direction of the arrow Fa, thereby making the position of the blade edge 18 coincident with the rotation center axis Ca.<br>
In the tool holder of the conventional art shown in Fig. 12, even when a screw 7 of the correcting tool is fastened, only the mass which is immediately below the screw can be changed. Therefore, it is difficult to correct runout of the shaft center which occurs on the side of the drill with respect to a correcting place. By contrast, in the embodiment, the fastening force exerted on the screw 24 causes the shaft 13 to be bent, so that the force can be applied toward the holding portion 14 as the force F shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, runout between the rotation center of the tip end 18 of the tool and the rotation center Ca of the tool holder 10 can be easily corrected.<br>
As described above, the runout correcting tool 20 of the embodiment can correct runout which occurs on the side of the tool 17 with respect to the correcting tool 20. This is realized by the fiinction of the inclined face 27. When the inclination angle of the inclined face 27 is changed, the direction of the force F can be directed more closely to the drill. However, the necessary force (the force of fastening the screw 24) must be increased in accordance with the<br><br>
change.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a tool holder 10 of a second embodiment of the invention in which runout of the blade edge 18 at the tip end of the drill can be corrected at a higher degree. The embodiment is different fi-om the first embodiment in that the attaching position of the runout correcting tool 20 is set to be closer to the drill 17. When the runout correcting tool 20 is closer to the drill as described above, it is not required to reduce the inclination angle of the inclined face 27, and runout of the tip end 18 of the drill can be corrected by a smaller fastening force.<br>
In the above description, the runout correcting means of the tool holder 10 shown in Figs. 1 to 6 corrects "runout" of the tool holder 10 after the runout correcting tool 20 which is configured so as to be attachable and detachable with respect to the tool holder 10 is attached to the tool holder 10. As described above, the runout correcting means 20 may be an independent component which is detachably configured. Altematively, the means may be configured by previously attaching the annular member 21 to the outer peripheral face of the shaft in a step of producing the tool holder 10.<br>
In Fig. 6, components which seem to be fimctionally identical or equivalent to those of Figs. 1 to 5 described above are denoted by the same reference numerals as those used in Figs. 1 to 5, and letter "e" is affixed to the reference numerals in order to distinguish the numerals fi'om those used in the figures. Therefore, the configuration of the components can be easily realized, and duplicated description is omitted, (Also in the configuration associated to partial views of Fig. 7 and the subsequent figures, components of the tool holder 10 to which the runout correcting tool 20 is attached are denoted by the same<br><br>
reference numerals as those of the previous figures,   letter f or g is affixed, and duplicated description is omitted.)<br>
In the above-described embodiment of Figs. 1 to 6, one inclined face of the U-groove 22 is used as the second contact portion of the runout correcting tool 20. It is requested only that an engagement structure for receiving the second abutting portion 29 exists correspondingly and scatteringly in the circumferential direction of the shaft 13. The second contact portion is not required to be formed as a U-groove. In Fig. 3, the screw member 24 is opposed to the second contact portion 27. Altematively, the U-groove 22 may be formed in the first contact portion 26, and the screw member 24 may be configured so as to be advanceable and retractable with respect to the U-groove. In the altemative also, the force F shown in Fig. 3 can be similarly generated.<br>
Among the embodiments described above, the embodiment mode relating to the runout correcting means 20 may be configured as shown in Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. The runout correcting means 20 shown in the figures are embodiment modes which are configured in a partly different manner from the runout correcting means 20 shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The object of the runout correcting means shown in Fig. 7 is to show a possibility that runout correcting means is disposed in an arbitrary intermediate position in the longitudinal direction of the shaft so as to enable the axis of the tip end side of the shaft 13 to be displaced.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, 33 denotes a trough-shaped recess portion which is disposed in an arbitrary intermediate position in a longitudinal direction 38 of the outer periphery of a shaft 13f.   The recess is opened in front and rear portions. In the recess, inclined faces for configuring first and second contact portions 26f<br><br>
and 27f are formed in front and rear positions which are separated from each<br>
other in the shaft longitudinal direction 38, respectively.   A pressing member 34<br>
made of steel is disposed in the recess 33 so as to be advanceable and retractable<br>
toward the trough bottom.   First and second abutting portions 28f and 29f which<br>
are correspondingly inclined so as to be in press contact with the inclined<br>
portions of the first and second contact portions are disposed in front and rear<br>
sides of the pressing member 34,    A female screw forming portion 36 for<br>
advanceably and retractably holding a screw member 24f is fixedly placed around<br>
the shaft.   The female screw forming portions 36 may be arranged fixedly and<br>
independently around the shaft, at a number which is equal to the numbers of the<br>
recesses   33   and  the  corresponding  screw  members  24f    Alternatively,   as<br>
illusfrated, an annular member 21f which is integrally formed may be placed<br>
around the shaft, and a desired number of female screw forming portions 36 may<br>
be disposed in the member.   Altematively, in the same manner as the U-groove<br>
22 of Fig. 1, the trough-shaped recess portion 33 may be formed by cutting the<br>
outer peripheral face of the shaft 13 continuously and annularly.    In the case<br>
where the trough-shaped recess portion 33  is  formed by  cutting the outer<br>
peripheral face of the shaft 13 continuously and annularly, when the annular<br>
member 21f is movable in the shaft circumferential direction, the position of the<br>
female screw forming portion 36 in the circumferential direction can be changed<br>
so that the displacement direction of the axis Cf of a tip end side of the shaft 13f<br>
can be arbifrarily changed.   Therefore, the number of the screw members 24f can<br>
be reduced.   A recess 34a is formed in the pressing member 34, and a tip end 35<br>
of the screw member 24f is loosely fitted into the recess.<br>
In the runout correcting means 20 of Fig. 7, when the screw member 24f<br><br>
is operated to advance the tip end 35 toward the shaft center, the pressing faces 28f and 29f on the both sides of the pressing member 34 press the inclined faces of the first and second contact portions 26f and 27f so that a distance between the inclined faces is lengthened, and, in the same manner as the case shown in Fig. 3, the force Ff of displacing the axis Cf of the tip end side of the shaft 13f is generated.<br>
The object of provision of a runout correcting means shown in Fig. 8 is to show a possibility that the means can be easily attached to a conventional tool holder such as shown in Fig. 12 and facilitate displacement of the axis of the tip end side of the shaft.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, llbg denotes a step which is usually formed in an arbitrary intermediate position in a longitudinal direction 38 and in an outer periphery of a shaft 13g, and which, in positions separated from each other in the longitudinal direction 38, forms a rising wall face 26g and a shaft outer peripheral face 27g that is perpendicular to the wall face. The faces constitute first and second contact portions 26g and 27g, respectively. A pressing member 40 made of steel is disposed in the step llbg so as to be advanceable and retractable toward a space in a comer 42. First and second abutting portions 28g and 29g which are formed as inclined abutting faces so as to be in press contact with the first and second contact portions 26g and 27g are disposed in front and rear positions of the pressing member 40.<br>
A tapped hole 23g is formed in the comer 42 of the shaft 13g. A screw member 24g which is passed through a hole 43 of the pressing member 40 is screwed advanceably and retractably with the tapped hole. In the runout correcting means 20g of Fig. 8, when the screw member 24g is operated to<br><br>
advance the pressing member 40 toward the comer 42, the abutting faces 28g and 29g of the pressing member 40 press the abutting faces of the first and second contact portions 26g and 27g so that a distance between the abutting faces of the first and second contact portions 26g and 27g is lengthened, and, in the same maimer as the case shown in Fig. 7, the force of displacing the axis Cg of the tip end side of the shaft 13g is generated.<br>
The object of provision of a runout correcting means shown in Figs. 9 and 10 is to provide means for enabling the screwing force of a screw member to act very effectively on displacement of an axis of a tip end side of a shaft.<br>
Referring to the figures, a rising wall face 26h or 26i constituting a first contact portion 26h or 26i uses a step formed in front of a flange 1 Ih or Hi (or an annular member which is fixed to the shaft and separately formed). An annular member 21h or 21i which is formed fixedly with the shaft 13h or 13i by an integral member (or fixedly formed in a fittable manner by a separate member) is disposed in a position of the shaft which is separated in a longitudinal direction 38. In the annular member, a second contact portion 27h or 27i is configured by a female screw portion 23h or 23i. A screw member 24h or 24i is screwed into the female screw portion 23h or 23i. A tip end of the screw member is formed as a first abutting portion 28h or 28i, and a basal portion of a thread portion of the screw memberis formed as a second abutting portion 29h or 29i.<br>
According to this configuration, when the screw member 24h or 24i is operated, the gap between the rising wall face 26h or 26i and the member 21h or 21i having the female screw portion 23h or 23 i is widened to generate a force of displacing the axis Ch or Ci of the tip end side of the shaft 13h or 13i.<br><br>
The axial direction of the screw member 24h or 24i in Fig. 9 or 10 may be se to be in parallel with the axis of the shaft 13h as shown in Fig. 9, or may be inclined or provided with an angle 47 as shown in Fig. 10. Namely, the axial direction may be arbitrarily set so as to facilitate the operation of the member.<br>
The object of provision of a runout correcting means shown in Fig. 11 is to generate a force which causes an axis of a tip end side of a shaft to be directed rightward or leftward or in deferent orientations depending on the direction of the operation of rotating a screw member.<br>
Referring to Fig. 11, a left-hand female screw (or right-hand female screw) 23j is formed in a rising wall face 26j serving as a first contact portion 26j. In a screw holding member 50, a right-hand (or left-hand) female screw 23j which is opposite in direction to the screw of the first contact portion 26j is disposed in a position which is separated in a longitudinal durection 38 of the shaft 13j, as a second contact portion 27j. The screw holding member 50 may have an independent configuration such as a steel nut. In first and second abutting portions 28j and 29j, a left-hand screw 28j and a right-hand screw 29j are formed in the both end sides of one screw member 24j, and the screws are screwed with left- and right-hand female screws formed in the first and second contact portions 26j and 27j, respectively. The contact portions 26j and 27j are made closer to or separated from each other by leftward or rightward rotating the one screw member 24j, so that an axis Cj of the tip end side of the shaft 13j can be directed rightward or leftward or in deferent orientations.<br>
The embodiment is assembled in the following manner. The both sides of the screw member 24j are screwed into the corresponding female screws, respectively.   Under this state, the nut 50 which remains to be in a rotatable state<br><br>
is fixed to an outer periphery of the shaft 13j by any means such as welding 51. The reference numeral 52 denotes a groove for fitting, and 53  denotes a rectangular member for operating the screw.<br>
Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 show the examples in which four sets of the runout correcting means 20 are arranged in the periphery of the shaft 13. In the same manner as the first embodiment, the number of the means can be, for example, any number of 1 to 6, or arbitrarily set.<br>
With respect to the runout correcting means 20 shown in the figures, the operation conducted on one set of the means has been described. When two, three, or more sets of the runout correcting means 20 which are arranged in the periphery of the shaft are altematingly operated, the shaft center C can be bent and displaced in an arbitrary direction. For example, the position of the blade edge 18 of the drill 17 may be made closer to the rotation center Ca of the tool holder 10 so as to coincide therewith. Altematively, an operation may be conducted so that the position of the blade edge 18 of the drill 17 is made remoter from the rotation center Ca to increase the cutting radius.<br>
As many apparently widely different embodiments of this invent be made without  departing  from the  spirit and  scope thereof,  it  i:<br>
In each of Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 showing the specific configurations, (A) is a section view of the tool holder and taken at a position corresponding to Fig. 3, and (B) is a section view taken at the position of the runout correcting means 20 shown in (A).<br>
