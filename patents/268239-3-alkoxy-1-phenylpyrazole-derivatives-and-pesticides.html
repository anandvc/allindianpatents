DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
OBJECT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years, in agricultural and horticultural fields, due to use of pesticides such as insecticides, miticides and nematicides for many years, pests have acquired resistance and are hardly controlled.    Further, use of highly noxious pesticides has been a problem.<br>
With respect to application of a pesticide, in a case where a pesticide is directly sprayed to a plant for example, no sufficient pesticidal effect is obtained in some cases due to non-uniform spraying, transpiration, decomposition by light, outflow of chemicals by rain, etc.    On the other hand, when a pesticide is applied to the soil and is absorbed from e.g. the root of a plant, the chemical will spread all over the plant body, and a stable effect will be obtained.    Further, pesticides applicable to soil treatment are advantageous to those who are engaged in agriculture from such a viewpoint that exposure to the chemical by spraying is small, and the method for applying the chemical is simple, thus leading to power saving.<br>
However, at present, very few pesticides such as insecticides, miticides and nematicides, which can be utilized for soil treatment and which are practical, have been known.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve the above problems of conventional pesticides such as insecticides, miticides and nematicides, and to provide pesticides such as insecticides, miticides and nematicides, which are excellent in the safety, pesticidal effects, residual effectiveness, etc., which have infiltration, and which can be applied by soil treatment.<br>
MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECT<br>
To develop pesticides having the above-described preferred characteristics, the present inventors have prepared various 3-alkoxy-1-phenyl-pyrazole derivatives, and conducted extensive studies on their physiological activities.   As a result, they have found that 3-alkoxy-1-phenyl-pyrazole derivatives (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the compounds of the present invention) represented by the following formula [I] have effects against various pests in agricultural and horticultural fields, and pests which have acquired resistance.    They have found that the compounds exhibit very high effects especially against mites represented by two-spotted spider mite, Kanzawa spider mite and citrus red mite, pest hemipterans represented by brown rice planthopper, green rice leafhopper and cotton aphid, pest coleoptera represented by rice water weevil, rice leaf beetle and chafers, nematodes represented by southern root-knot nematode, and pest lepidopterans represented by diamondbackmoth, beat armyworm and cotton bollworm, have high activity even by soil treatment with which safe and labor-saving application becomes possible, and exhibit fungicidal effects against rice blast disease.   The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these discoveries.<br>
The present invention provides the following (1) to (10).<br>
(1) A 3-alkoxy-1 -phenyl-pyrazole derivative represented by the formula [I] or an agriculturally acceptable salt thereof:<br>

They are blended usually in such proportions that the active ingredient is from 0.1 to 90 mass%, preferably from 1 to 70 mass% and the agricultural adjuvants are from 10 to 99.9 mass%, preferably from 20 to 90 mass% based on the entire amount (100 mass%) of the pesticide.<br>
The carriers to be used for such formulation may be classified into solid carriers and liquid carriers.    The solid carriers include, for example, animal and plant powders such as starch, activated carbon, soybean powder, wheat flour, wood flour, fish flour and powdered milk, and mineral powders such as talc, kaolin, bentonite, calcium carbonate, zeolite, diatomaceous earth, white carbon, clay, alumina, ammonium sulfate and urea.   The liquid carriers include, for example, water; alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol; ketones such as cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketone and isophorone; ethers such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as kerosene and light oil; aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene, trimethylbenzene, tetramethylbenzen, methylnaphthalene and solvent naphtha; halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene; acid amides such as dimethylacetamide; esters such as glycerin esters of fatty acids; nitriles such asacetonitrile; and sulfur-containing compounds such as dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
The surfactants include, for example, metal salts of alkylbenzenesulfonic acids, metal salts of dinaphthylmethanedisulfonic acids, salts of alcohol sulfates, alkylarylsulfonates, lignin sulfonates, polyoxyethylene glycol ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl aryl ethers, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoalkylates and salts of a formalin condensate of naphthalenesulfonate.<br>
The other adjuvants include, for example, adhesive agents and thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, gum arabic, sodium arginate, guar gum, tragacanth gum, and polyvinyl alcohol; antifoaming agents such as metal soap; physical property improvers such as fatty acids, alkyl phosphate salts, silicone and paraffin; and coloring agents.<br>
When these formulations are practically used, they may be used directly or after diluted with a diluent such as water to a predetermined concentration.<br>
Various formulations containing the compounds of the present invention, whether diluted or not, may be applied by conventional methods, i.e., application methods (such as spraying, misting, atomizing, dusting, granule application, paddy water application and seeding box application), soil treatment (such as mixing or drenching), surface application (such as painting, dressing and covering), dipping, poison bait or smoking.<br>
Further, the above active ingredients may be incorporated into livestock feeds so as to prevent infestation or growth of pest, especially pest insects after they are voided in excrement.<br>
Otherwise, they can also be applied by a so-called ultra-low volume, high concentration application method.    The proportion of the active ingredient in a pesticide in the case of the ultra-low volume, high concentration application method, is suitably selected as required, and it is from 0.1 to 20 mass%, preferably from 0.5 to 10 mass% in the case of a dust or a granule, and from 1 to 80% mass%, preferably from 10 to 50 mass% in the case of an emulsifiable concentrate or a wettable powder.<br>
The pesticides of the present invention are applied, when they are diluted with a diluent, usually at an active ingredient concentration of from 0.1 to 5,000 ppm. When they are used directly, the dose per unit area is from 0.1 to 5,000 g, preferably from 5 to 2,000 g per 1 ha in terms of the compound that serves as the active ingredient.    However, the dose is not limited to such specific range.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are sufficiently effective when used alone.    However, they may be used, if necessary, in combination or in admixture with fertilizers or other agrochemicals such as insecticides, miticides, nematicides, fungicides, antivirus agents, attractants, herbicides and plant growth modulating agents, and such combined or admixed use can sometimes produce improved effects.<br>
