				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to the field of cosmetic compositions of emulsion<br>
type and more particularly to the field of compositions comprising a textured liquid fatty<br>
phase.<br>
Cosmetic compositions comprising a liquid fatty phase-are commonly used<br>
nowadays, in particular for cleansing, caring for, making up and/or treating the skin, the<br>
hair and the scalp. The daily use of these compositions means that those using them are<br>
always more demanding and more sensitive to the texture more generally to the<br>
organoleptic properties of these compositions.<br>
Thus, it has been noted that cosmetic compositions which comprise more than<br>
10% by weight of fatty phase containing more than 40% by weight of non-volatile oil, are<br>
found to be advantageous for making up for the lack of cutaneous lipids in dehydrated<br>
skin, but on the other hand can pose problems in terms of sensory properties, insofar as<br>
they are capable of generating a greasy effect, sometimes accompanied by a tacky effect<br>
and/or a shiny appearance, which users do not find attractive.<br>
In addition to this undesirable effect from a sensory perception point of view,<br>
these emulsion-type compositions can show a lack of stability when they are combined<br>
with certain materials. Thus, it has been noted that the presence of large amounts of UV<br>
screens, in particular organic UV screens, in emulsions of this type can affect the stability<br>
thereof over time, or even initiate demixing thereof. The composition then becomes<br>
inhomogeneous and is no longer usable.<br>
There remains therefore, at this time, a need for emulsion-type cosmetic<br>
compositions with a significant fatty phase content, which are reproducible on demand in<br>
terms of viscosity, which are devoid of any fatty, tacky and shiny nature, and which have<br>
improved stability, in particular when they contain materials of organic UV screen type.<br>
The principal object of the present invention is precisely to meet these needs.<br>
In this regard, the inventors have, unexpectedly, noted that it is possible to<br>
obtain such emulsions, with the proviso of using therein, by way of emulsifier, a particular<br>
gemini surfactant in combination with at least one specific semi-crystalline polymer.<br>
Document EP1 502 582 describes compositions comprising at least one gemini<br>
surfactant and at least one associative polymer, said compositions being fluid and<br>
emulsified and containing a photoprotective system capable of screening UV rays.<br><br>
Documents WO 2007/054824, WO 03/024412 and WO 2004/105704<br>
describes moreover, oil-in-water compositions for topical application, comprising at least<br>
one gemini surfactant.<br>
Furthermore, documents FR 2 863 889 and EP 1 331 000 describe<br>
compositions which use semi-crystalline polymers.<br>
However, none of there documents either describes or suggests the use of the<br>
combination of the invention in the galenical architecture more particularly targeted,<br>
namely comprising more than 10% by weight of fatty phase containing more than 40% by<br>
weight of non-volatile oil.<br>
More specifically, a subject of the invention is a cosmetic or dermatological<br>
composition of oil-in-water type comprising, in a physiologically acceptable medium, at<br>
least one gemini surfactant of formula (I):<br><br>
in which:<br>
-	R1 and R3 denote, independently of one another, an alkyl radical containing<br>
from 1 to 25 carbon atoms;<br>
-	R2 denotes a spacer consisting of a linear or branched alkylene chain<br>
containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms;<br>
-	X and Y denote, independently of one another, a -(C2H4O)a-(C3H6O)bZ<br>
group where<br><br>
•	Z denotes a hydrogen atom or a radical -CH2-COOM, -SO3M, -P(O)(OM)2,<br>
-C2H4-SO3M, -C3H6-SO3M or -CH2(CHOH)4CH2OH, where M, M' represent H or an<br>
alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth metal ion, an ammonium ion or alkanolammonium<br>
ion,<br>
•	a ranges from 0 to 15,<br>
•	b ranges from 0 to 10, and<br>
•	the sum of a + b ranges from 1 to 25; and<br>
- n ranges from 1 to 10,<br><br>
in combination with an effective amount of at least one semi-crystalline polymer which is<br>
solid at ambient temperature and which has a melting point of below 70°C, comprising a)<br>
a polymeric backbone and b) at least one crystallizable organic side chain and/or one<br>
crystallizable organic block which is part of the backbone of said polymer, said polymer<br>
having a number-average molecular mass greater than or equal to 2000,<br>
said emulsion having a proportion of fatty phase greater than 10% by weight relative to the<br>
total weight of said composition and comprising more than 40% by weight of non-volatile<br>
oil(s) relative to the total weight of said fatty phase.<br>
The combination according to the invention makes it possible to obtain<br>
emulsions which are very homogeneous, which have increased stability and which are<br>
therefore compatible with the formulation of materials known to naturally have a<br>
destabilizing effect with respect to the known conventional emulsions, and in particular<br>
organic UV screens.<br>
In addition, the emulsions stabilized by the combination in accordance with<br>
the invention have a texture which is very pleasant to the touch. They are soft and give a<br>
feeling of lightness when they are applied to the skin."<br>
The term "physiologically acceptable medium" is understood to mean a<br>
medium compatible with human keratin materials, such as the skin, the mucus membranes,<br>
the nails, the scalp and/or the hair.<br>
Thus, the physiologically acceptable medium is in particular a cosmetically or<br>
dermatologically acceptable medium, i.e. with no unpleasant odour, colour or appearance,<br>
and which does not generate any tingling, tautness or redness unacceptable,to the user.<br>
The composition used according to the invention may be intended for cosmetic<br>
or pharmaceutical use, particularly dermatological use. Preferably, the composition<br>
according to the invention is intended for cosmetic use. It may be used for caring for or<br>
making up keratin materials.<br>
A composition according to the invention is in particular suitable for topical<br>
application to a keratin material, and in particular the skin.<br>
Thus, it may be used as a skincare product, for example as a protection,<br>
treatment or care cream for the face, for the hands or for the body, such as a body milk for<br>
protecting or caring for the skin, the scalp or the mucus membranes, or as a hygiene<br>
product, for example as a makeup-removing product for the skin or the mucus membranes,<br>
or else as a hair product, or more particularly as a suntan product.<br><br>
The compositions according to the invention may also constitute products for<br>
making up the skin and/or the hair, for example by incorporating therein pigments in order<br>
to constitute in particular foundations.<br>
Thus, a subject of the invention is also the cosmetic use of the composition as<br>
defined above, as a skincarc product, as a hygiene product, as a hair product, as a suntan<br>
product or as a makeup product.<br>
The invention futures relates to a cosmetic method for making up and/or for<br>
the non therapeutic care of keratin materials, such as skin, scalp, hair, eyelashes,<br>
eyebrows, nails and mucous membranes, wherein it comprises at least a step of applying<br>
to keratin materials a composition according to the present invention,<br>
Another subject of the invention is a process for the treatment, in particular<br>
cosmetic treatment, of a keratin material, such as the skin, scalp, hair, eyelashes,<br>
eyebrows, nails or mucus membranes, characterized in that a composition as defined<br>
above is applied to the keratin material.<br>
Other subjects, characteristics, aspects and advantages of the present invention<br>
will emerge more clearly on reading the description and the examples which follow.<br>
Gemini surfactant<br>
The gemini surfactant of formula (I) is preferably such that each of the groups<br>
R1-CO- and R3-CO- contains from 8 to 20 carbon atoms, and preferably denotes a coconut<br>
fatty acid residue (predominantly comprising lauric acid and myristic acid).<br>
In addition, this surfactant is preferably such that, for each of the radicals X<br>
and Y, the sum of a and b has a mean value ranging from 10 to 20 and is preferably equal<br>
to 15. A preferred group for Z is the group -SO3M where M is preferably an alkali metal<br>
ion such as a sodium ion.<br>
The spacer R2 advantageously consists of a linear C1-C3 alkylene chain, and<br>
preferably an ethylene chain (CH2CH2).<br>
Finally, n is advantageously equal to 1.<br>
A surfactant of this type is in particular the surfactant identified by the INCI<br>
name: Sodium dicocoylethylcnediamine PEG-15 sulfate, having the following structure:<br><br><br>
it being understood that PEG represents the group CH2CH2O, and cocoyl represents the<br>
coconut fatty acid residue.<br>
This surfactant has a molecular structure very similar to that of ceramide-3.<br>
Preferably, the gemini surfactant according to the invention is used as a<br>
mixture with other surfactants, and in particular as a mixture with (a) a glyceryl ester of a<br>
C6-C22 fatty acid (preferably of C14-C20 such as a stearate), (b) a glycerol diester of a<br>
C6-C22 fatty acid (preferably of C14-C20 such as a stearate) and of citric acid (such as a<br>
glycerol diester of a C6-C22 fatty acid and of monocitric acid), and (c) a C10-C30 fatty<br>
alcohol (preferably behenyl alcohol).<br>
Advantageously, the composition according to the invention comprises a<br>
mixture of sodium dicocoylefhylenediamine PEG-15 sulfate, of glyceryl stearate, of<br>
glyceryl stearate monocitrate, of behenyl alcohol.<br>

ester of a C6-C22 fatty acid represents from 30% to 40% by weight, advantageously 35%<br>
by weight; the glycerol diester of a C6-C22 fatty acid and of citric acid represents from<br>
10% to 20% by weight, advantageously 15% by weight; and the C10-C30 fatty alcohol<br>
represents from 30% to 40% by weight, advantageously 35% by weight, relative to the<br>
total weight of the mixture of surfactants containing the gemini surfactant.<br>
Advantageously, the composition according to the invention comprises a<br>

surfactant.<br><br>
As a variant, the gemini surfactant according to the invention may be used as a<br>
mixture with an anionic surfactant such as a lauric acid ester, sodium lauryl lactate. In this<br>
case, the gemini surfactant preferably represents from 30% to 50% by weight, and the<br>
anionic surfactant represents from 50% to 70% by weight, relative to the total weight of<br>
the mixture.<br>
The gemini surfactant may be used, for example, as a mixture with other<br>
surfactants in the form of products sold by the company Sasol under the name Ceralution®,<br>
and in particular the following products:<br>
•	Ceralution® H: Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate and<br>

This gemini surfactant represents from 3% to 50% of the weight of these<br>
mixtures.<br>
The gemini surfactant of formula (I) may be present in a composition .<br>
according to the invention at a content ranging from 0.01% to 5% by weight, relative to<br>
the total weight of the composition, preferably ranging from 0.1% to 3% by weight, and<br>
better still ranging from 0.2% to 1.5% by weight.<br>
. Semi-crystalline polymer<br>
The semi-crystalline polymer used in the composition of the invention is<br>
generally introduced into the liquid fatty phase of the emulsion.<br>
For the purpose of the invention, the term "semi-crystalline polymer" is<br>
intended to mean polymers comprising a crystallizable portion, pendant chain or block in<br>
the backbone, and an amorphous portion in the backbone, and having a first-order<br>
reversible phase change temperature, in particular melting temperature (solid-liquid<br>
transition). For the purpose of the invention, the term "polymers" is intended to mean<br>
compounds comprising at least 2 repeating units, preferably at least 3 repeating units, and<br>
more especially at least 10 repeating units. When the crystallizable portion is a block of<br><br>
the polymer backbone, the chemical nature of this crystallizable block is different from<br>
that of the amorphous blocks,; the semi-crystalline polymer is, in this case, a block<br>
polymer, for example of the diblock, triblock or multiblock type.<br>
Advantageously, the semi-crystalline polymer(s) of the composition of the<br>
invention has (have) a number-average molecular mass Mn of greater than or equal to<br>
2000, ranging, for example, from 2000 to 800 000, preferably from 3000 to 500 000, for-<br>
example from 4000 to 150 000, and better still from 4000 to 99 000.<br>
In the composition according to the invention, the semi-crystalline polymers<br>
are advantageously soluble in the fatty phase to at least 1% by weight, at a temperature<br>
above their melting point. Outside the crystallizabled chains or blocks, the blocks of the<br>
polymers are amorphous. For the purpose of the invention, the term "crystallizable chain<br>
or block" is intended to mean a chain or block which, if it was alone, would pass from the<br>
amorphous state to the crystalline state, reversibly, depending on whether the temperature .<br>
is above or below the melting point. For the purpose of the invention, a chain is a group of<br>
atoms that is pendant or lateral relative to the backbone of the polymer. A block is a group<br>
of atoms belonging to the backbone, this group constituting one of the repeating units of<br>
the polymer.<br>
Preferably, the polymer backbone of the semi-crystalline polymers is soluble<br>
in the liquid fatty phase.<br>
Preferably, the semi-crystalline polymers used in the composition of the .<br>
invention have a melting point (or melting temperature) Tm of less than 70°C, preferably<br>
less than 50°C, this temperature being at least equal to the temperature of the keratin<br>
support that is to receive the composition according to the invention. The semi-crystalline<br>
polymer has a melting point Tm such that 25°C ≤ Tm 
30°C ≤ Tm 
and in particular using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).<br><br>
Preferably, the crystallizable blocks or chains of the semi-crystalline polymers<br>
represent at least 30% of the total weight of each polymer, and better still at least 40%.<br>
The semi-crystalline polymers of the invention comprising crystallizable blocks are block<br>
or multiblock polymers. They can be obtained by polymerization of monomers containing<br>
reactive doubles bonds (ethylenic bonds) or by a polycondensation. When the polymers of<br>
the invention are polymers comprising crystallizable side chains, said polymers are<br>
advantageously in random form.<br>
Preferably, the semi-crystalline nolvmers of the invention are of synthetic<br>
origin. In addition, they do not comprise a polysaccharide backbone.<br>
The semi-crystalline polymers that can be used in the invention are in<br>
particular:<br>
1)	block copolymers of polyolefins of controlled crystallization, the monomers<br>
of which are described in document EP-A-951897;<br>
2)	polycondensates and especially aliphatic or aromatic polyester<br>
polycondensates, and aliphatic/aromatic copolyesters;<br>
3)	homopolymers or copolymers bearing at least one crystallizable side chain,<br>
and homopolymers or copolymers bearing in the backbone at least one crystallizable<br>
block, for instance those described in document US-A-5, 156, 911;<br>
4)	homopolymers or copolymers bearing at least one crystallizable side chain<br>
comprising one (or more) fluoro group(s), as described in document WO-A-01/19333;<br>
5)	and mixtures thereof.<br>
In the last two cases (3 and 4), the crystallizable block(s) or side chain(s) is<br>
(are) hydrophobic.<br>
Crystalline polymers comprising crystallizable side chains or bearing in the<br>
backbone at least one crystallizable block are described below.<br>
A) Semi-crystalline polymers comprising crystallizable side chains<br>
Mention may in particular be made of those defined in documents US-A-<br>
5,156,911 and WO-A-01/19333. They are homopolymers or copolymers comprising from<br>
50% to 100% by weight of units resulting from the polymerization of one or more<br>
monomers bearing crystallizable hydrophobic side chain(s).<br><br>
These homopolymers or copolymers are of any nature provided that they meet<br>
the conditions indicated hereinafter with, in particular, the characteristic of being soluble<br>
or dispersible in the liquid fatty phase by heating above their melting point Tm. They may<br>
result:<br>
-	from the polymerization, especially free-radical polymerization, of one or<br>
more monomers comprising reactive ethylenic double bond(s) with respect to a<br>
polymerization, i.e. comprising a vinyl, (meth)acrylic or allylic group;<br>
-	from the polycondensation of one or more monomers bearing coreactive<br>
groups (carboxylic acid, sulphonic acid, alcohol, amine or isocyanate), such as, for<br>
example, polyesters, polyurethanes, polyethers, polyureas or polyamides.<br>
a) In general, the crystallizable units (chains or blocks) of the semi-crystalline<br>
polymers according to the invention are obtained from monomer(s) comprising<br>
crystallizable block(s) or chain(s), used for the production of the semi-crystalline<br>
polymers. These polymers are chosen in particular from homopolymers and copolymers<br>
resulting from the polymerization of at least one monomer comprising a crystallizable<br>
chain or chains which may be represented by the formula X:<br><br>
where M represents an atom of the polymer-skeleton, S represents a. spacer and C<br>
represents a crystallizable group.<br>
The crystallizable chains "-S-C" may be aliphatic or aromatic, and optionally<br>
fluorinated or perfluorinated. "S" in particular represents a linear or branched or cyclic<br>
group (CH2)n or (CH2CH2O)n or (CH2O), n being an integer ranging from 0 to 22.<br>
Preferably, "S" is a linear group. Preferably, "S" and "C" are different.<br>
When the crystallizable chains are aliphatic (alkyl) chains, they comprise at<br>
least 11 carbon atoms and not more than 40 carbon atoms and better still not more than 24<br>
carbon atoms. They are in particular alkyl chains containing at least 12 carbon atoms, and<br>
are preferably alkyl chains containing from 14 to 24 carbon atoms (C14-C24). They may be<br><br>
hydrocarbon-based alkyl chains (carbon and hydrogen atoms) or fluoroalkyl or perfluoro-<br>
alkyl chains (carbon atoms, fluorine atoms and, optionally, hydrogen atoms). When they<br>
are fluoroalkyl or perfluoroalkyl chains, they comprise at least 11 carbon atoms, at least 6<br>
carbon atoms of which are fluorinated.<br>
As examples of semi-crystalline polymers or copolymers comprising<br>
crystallizable chain(s), mention may be made of those resulting from the polymerization of<br>
at least one monomer comprising a crystallizable chain chosen from saturated C14-C24<br>
alkyl (meth)acrylates (C14-C24 means that the alkyl group contains from 14 to 24 carbon<br>
atoms); C11-C15 perfluoroalkyl (meth)acrylates (alkyl group with 11 to 15 carbon atoms);<br>
C14 to C24 N-alkyl(meth)acrylamides with or without a fluorine atom (alkyl group with 14<br>
to 24 carbon atoms); vinyl esters comprising C14 to C24 alkyl or perfluoroalkyl chains<br>
(alkyl group with 14 to 24 carbon atoms), with a perfluoroalkyl chain containing at least 6<br>
fluorine atoms; vinyl ethers comprising C14 to C24 alkyl or perfluoroalkyl chains (alkyl<br>
group with 14 to 24 carbon atoms), with a perfluoroalkyl chain containing at least 6<br>
fluorine atoms; C14 to C24 alpha-olefins (alkyl group with 14 to 24 carbon atoms), such as,<br>
for example, octadecene; C14 to C24 para-alkylstyrenes (alkyl group with 14 to 24 carbon<br>
atoms), and mixtures thereof.<br>
For the purpose of the invention, the term "alkyl" is intended to mean a<br>
saturated group in particular containing from 8 to 24 carbon atoms (C8 to C24), unless<br>
otherwise mentioned.<br>
When the polymers result from a polycondensation, the hydrocarbon-based<br>
and/or fluorinated crystallizable chains as defined above are borne by a monomer which<br>
may be a diacid, a diol, a diamine or a diisocyanate.<br>
When the polymers used in the composition of the invention are copolymers,<br>
they also contain from 0 to 50% of groups Y or Z resulting from the copolymerization:<br>
a) with Y which is a polar or nonpolar monomer or a mixture of the two:<br>

The semi-crystalline polymers of the composition of the invention may be<br>
non-crosslinked or partially crosslinked, provided that the degree of crosslinking does not<br>
harm their dissolution or dispersion in the liquid fatty phase by heating above their melting<br>
point. This may then be a chemical crosslinking, by reaction with a multifunctional<br>
monomer during the polymerization. It may also be physical crosslinking which may then<br>
be due either to the establishment of bonds of hydrogen type or dipolar type between<br>
groups borne by the polymer, such as, for example, the dipolar interactions between<br>
carboxylate ionomers, these interactions being of small amount and borne by the polymer<br>
backbone; or to a phase separation between the crystallizable blocks and the amorphous<br>
blocks borne by the polymer.<br>
Preferably, the semi-crystalline polymers of the composition according to the<br>
invention are non-crosslinked.<br>

The examples which appear hereinafter are given by way of nonlimiting<br>
illustration of the field of the invention.<br>
-	The gemini surfactant used in the examples hereinafter is a mixture of<br>
Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate and Sodium<br>
Dicocoylethylenediamine PEG-15 Sulfate sold by the company Sasoc under the name<br>
Ceralution ®H.<br>
-	The semi-crystalline polymer used is a poly(stearyl acrylate) sold by the<br>
company Landec under the name Intelimer IPA 13-1.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
A cosmetic composition in accordance with the invention and the detailed<br>
formulation of which is provided hereinafter in Table I, is prepared and its properties in<br>
terms of stability and sensory quality are tested.<br>
Its stability over time is assessed at the end of a period of storage in which said<br>
composition is left to stand for 2 months at a temperature of respectively 37°C then 45°C.<br>
By way of comparison, two other formulations were prepared, in which the gemini<br>
surfactant is replaced with either a 12/46/42 mixture of cetylstearylglucoside and of cetyl<br>
and stearyl alcohols sold by SEPPIC under the name Montanov® (control 1), or<br>
polyglyceryl-3 methylglucose distearate sold by Goldschmidt under the name Tegocare<br>
450® (control 2).<br>
The corresponding formulations are also given in Table I below.<br><br><br><br>
In terms of stability, only the emulsion in accordance with the present<br>
invention is satisfactory. Examination under a microscope makes it possible to observe a<br>
fine and regular emulsion, unlike the control formulations, the emulsions of which are<br>
coarser and more irregular. These same results are confirmed by macroscopic evaluation.<br>
The control formulations exhibit, after two months of storage, whether at 37°C or at 45°C,<br>
a heterogeneous texture with masses visible to the naked eye. Only the formulation<br>
according to the invention remains smooth and fine.<br>
The combination according to the invention manifestly ensures a better<br>
dispersion of the silica fillers and effectively prevents agglomeration thereof.<br><br><br>
Procedure<br>
After homogenization of the various phases, the oily phase is dispersed in the<br>
aqueous phase with stirring at 75 °C. A firm cream, which is fondant on application and<br><br>
provides intense nutrition and moisturization without an unpleasant greasy film is<br>
obtained. The composition is also stable after storage for 2 months at 25°C and 37°C.<br>
Example 3<br>
Table 2 gives the composition of a formulation in accordance with the<br>
invention. This table also reports a control formula in which the poly(stearyl acrylate) is<br>
replaced with beeswax.<br><br><br><br>
Each composition was conserved for 2 months at temperatures of 25°C, 27°C<br>
and 45°C.<br>
Examination with the naked eye shows that the composition according to the<br>
invention is homogeneous and smooth, whereas the control composition exhibits masses<br>
and is therefore heterogeneous, thereby demonstrating that the presence of poly(stearyl<br>
acrylate) makes it possible to obtain a stable composition.<br>
Examination under a microscope after 2 months of storage at 45°C shows that<br>
the composition according to the invention is fine, whereas the control composition<br>
exhibits zones where the oil droplets have collapsed and therefore a heterogeneity.<br>
Moreover, the composition applied to the skin does not give a greasy feeling,<br>
or a shiny effect.<br><br>
