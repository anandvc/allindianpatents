				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a substrate whose surface is protected against organic pollution<br>
stemming from peripheral seals, in particular mastics comprising silicone-type materials.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A substrate is composed of a metal, a metal alloy, a ceramic, a glass, oxide or essentially mineral<br>
material, especially, in the latter two cases, in the form of thin film coatings on a substrate, in<br>
particular a glass substrate. The invention takes on a particular significance when the substrate is<br>
transparent and requires a high optical quality, which is the case for a glass substrate, or a<br>
substrate made of glass equipped with one or more functional coating layers, in particular when<br>
these functional layers impart a hydrophilic character to said substrate.<br>
In many technical fields, assemblies and juxtapositions of various materials and of various<br>
components that are either traditional (concrete, bricks, steel or concrete beams, glass, etc.) or<br>
modern, prefabricated or synthetic (doors, windows, panels, plastics, etc.) are encountered and<br>
it is necessary to make provision for the interstices or joints between these different materials<br>
and components, as they have different dimensional variations depending on temperature or<br>
moisture variations and also different movements under the effect of the wind, bindings, weight<br>
of the structure, and flow of certain components. The word "joint" therefore denotes either the<br>
separation line and the packing or weatherstripping or an interstice between two elements<br>
whether they are of the same nature or of different nature, or a desired continuity solution, that<br>
is to say a rectilinear break created in a structure to absorb the differences in movement or in<br>
behavior.<br><br>
These joints must then be filled with weatherstripping<br>
products and the joint then also denotes the assembly<br>
of the interstice and of the weatherstripping product<br>
used to seal it. Among the weatherstripping products, a<br>
mastic is defined, within the meaning of the present<br>
invention, as a pasty, malleable, plastic or elastic<br>
material, applied in a joint and forming<br>
weatherstripping by adhering to the surfaces inside<br>
this joint.<br>
A large number of weatherstripping and sealing mastics<br>
contain silicone-type components (also known as<br>
polysiloxanes). The silicone mastics are characterized<br>
by their properties of elasticity, durability and<br>
adhesion onto many substrates, and are thus very<br>
frequently used to provide sealing for glazing onto all<br>
mediums, and also between sanitary components and<br>
walls. Silicones are also incorporated into the<br>
composition of many other mastics as plasticizers (to<br>
impart plasticity, even elasticity, to the material).<br>
Moreover, the addition of silicone oils (low molecular<br>
weight silicones) on the surface of the mastics<br>
facilitates their use. Thus, mastics containing<br>
silicone-type components are many and varied.<br>
It has turned out that silicone-type compounds always<br>
contain, in a greater or lesser proportion, low<br>
molecular weight polysiloxanes (often called "silicone<br>
oils") which have the property of migrating toward the<br>
surface of the mastics then onto the surface of the<br>
materials, making said surface polluted by the<br>
silicones very difficult to clean. This property comes<br>
from the fact that the silicones have a surface energy<br>
that is among the lowest known surface energies and may<br>
therefore very easily wet any type of surface, in<br>
particular high-energy surfaces.<br><br>
This problem appears particularly important when the surface has a hydrophilic character, as the<br>
silicone surfaces are extremely hydrophobic. When in contact with water, the polluted area<br>
becomes extremely visible in contrast with the unpolluted area, as the water perfectly wets the<br>
hydrophilic surfaces, creating a film of water, whereas the hydrophobic surfaces are not wetted<br>
by the water, the latter stagnating in the form of droplets.<br>
The hydrophilic surfaces may be linked to the surface state of the substrate. A clean glass or<br>
metal surface, for example, has a high surface energy and therefore a hydrophilic character,<br>
being expressed by a water contact angle of less than 15°. The surface hydrophilicity may also<br>
be due to coatings that are especially adapted for conferring this property. On substrates such as<br>
ceramics or glass, coatings comprising at least partially crystalline titanium oxide, especially in<br>
anatase form, give said substrate "superhydrophilicity" properties, characterized by a water<br>
contact angle of less than 5°, or even less than 1°. Such coatings, which have, in addition,<br>
photocatalysis properties, are for example described in Application EP-A-0 850 204. Other types<br>
of coatings have a hydrophilic character are also known. Mention will be made, for example, of<br>
coatings based on SiO2 and/or SiOC, in particular when they are textured, the texture having<br>
patterns of dimensions around 10 to 200 nm, especially in the form of nodules.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to protect the surface of a substrate from pollution<br>
coming from mastics that comprise silicone-type components.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To that effect, the subject of the invention is a substrate having, on at least one part of its<br>
periphery, a mastic comprising silicone-type components, characterized in that a barrier to the<br><br>
migration of the silicones is placed on the surface of<br>
said substrate.<br>
The substrate may be made from a metal, metal alloy,<br>
ceramic, glass, oxide or essentially mineral material,<br>
especially, in the latter two cases, in the form of<br>
thin-film coatings on a substrate, in particular, a<br>
glass substrate. The substrate according to the<br>
invention is preferably a glass-based or ceramic-based<br>
substrate having, on at least one part of one of its<br>
faces, at least one thin film (in this case, the<br>
surface of the substrate is classed as the surface of<br>
the outer thin film, the only one capable of being<br>
polluted by the migration of the silicones), in<br>
particular a coating conferring a pronounced<br>
hydrophilic character such as a coating comprising at<br>
least partially crystalline titanium oxide, especially<br>
in anatase form, according to the teaching of the<br>
aforementioned Application EP-A-0 850 204. Such a<br>
coated substrate has photocatalytic and<br>
superhydrophilic properties, making it capable of self-<br>
cleaning owing to the removal of organic and mineral<br>
soiling under the combined effect of a stream of water,<br>
especially of rain, and visible and/or ultraviolet<br>
radiation, such as solar radiation. In the latter case,<br>
the silicone-based pollution is, indeed, able to<br>
constitute a poison for the self-cleaning activity of<br>
the coating.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, the term<br>
"barrier" is understood to mean any means making it<br>
possible to limit, or even suppress, the migration of<br>
silicones.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention, the<br>
barrier to the migration of the silicones is based on a<br>
polymer, preferably an elastomeric mastic that does not<br>
comprise any silicone-based plasticizers.<br><br>
The polymer acting as a barrier is preferably deposited<br>
in the form of a bead onto the surface of the substrate<br>
to be protected, either in direct contact with the<br>
mastic comprising the silicone-type compounds, or<br>
opposite to and at a distance of a few millimeters from<br>
said mastic. This second option is the one which has<br>
the greatest advantages.<br>
The elastomeric mastic acting as a barrier to the<br>
migration of silicones is preferably based on an MS<br>
polymer. MS polymers are silyl-terminated polyethers. A<br>
nonlimiting example of such an MS polymer is the<br>
polymer composed of a polyoxypropylene chain terminated<br>
by dimethoxysilyl groups. Due to the absence of<br>
cohesive units in their main chain, these polymers have<br>
a high flexibility and often do not require the<br>
addition of plasticizers (and therefore no silicone-<br>
based plasticizers), or even of solvents.<br>
It appears, surprisingly and for the time being<br>
inexplicably, that such barriers effectively protect<br>
the surface of the substrate. Since silicone oils have<br>
the ability to wet any type of material, it was not<br>
imagined that such a barrier, being of whatever nature,<br>
could have a real effectiveness. Without wishing to be<br>
tied to any one scientific theory, the origin of the<br>
very high effectiveness of the polymers from the family<br>
of MS polymers could stem from strong interactions<br>
between the silicone oils and the silyl end groups of<br>
the MS polymer.<br>
The barrier may also be composed of a thick layer, the<br>
thickness of which is preferably between 100 nm and<br>
2 micrometers, comprising at least partially<br>
crystalline titanium oxide, and preferably even almost<br>
completely crystalline titanium oxide in anatase form.<br>
This layer preferably has a large specific surface<br>
area: it may be, for example, a layer of silica<br>
deposited by a sol-gel type process at the periphery of<br><br>
the surface to be protected, said silica layer<br>
comprising titanium oxide particles, as described, for<br>
example in Application WO-A-03/087002. The<br>
effectiveness of such a barrier probably lies in its<br>
very high photocatalytic activity, such layers being<br>
capable of degrading the silicone molecules under<br>
visible or ultraviolet radiation, the kinetics of<br>
degradation occurring more rapidly than the kinetics of<br>
migration of said molecules.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the barrier to the<br>
migration of the silicones may be formed from a notch<br>
or a groove located on the surface of the substrate and<br>
opposite to the mastic that is a source of silicones.<br>
The groove or notch advantageously has a depth ranging<br>
from 10 to 200 micrometers and a width ranging from<br>
100 micrometers to 2 millimeters.<br>
It appears that the groove acts as a trap for the<br>
silicone oils. The dimensions of the groove are adapted<br>
depending on the quantity of silicone which may<br>
migrate, and taking into account a possible embrittling<br>
effect when the substrate is made from a brittle<br>
material such as glass or a ceramic.<br>
A third embodiment of the invention, in the case where<br>
the substrate is composed of a glass-based or ceramic-<br>
based substrate coated with at least one thin film,<br>
consists in marginating said thin film, that is to say<br>
in removing the thin film at the periphery of said<br>
substrate by mechanical and/or chemical processes. The<br>
barrier to the migration of silicones is thus formed<br>
from a peripheral margination of the thin film. It has,<br>
indeed, been proved, in particular when the thin film<br>
is based on titanium oxide, that the silicones found it<br>
more difficult to migrate onto the glass surface than<br>
onto the surface of the film. A stronger interaction<br>
between the silicon atoms of the silicones and the<br>
glass surface is possibly the cause of such a<br><br>
phenomenon. To form an effective barrier, it is essential that the margination be such that there<br>
is a marginated zone which is not covered by the mastic, the width of said uncovered zone<br>
advantageously being greater than or equal to 0.5 cm, or even 1 or 2 cm. It is known to only<br>
marginate the zone covered by the mastic in order to avoid degrading the mastic with the thin<br>
film when the latter has a photocatalytic activity, but this does not prevent the silicones from the<br>
mastic from migrating to the surface of the thin film. Such a peripheral margination may be<br>
accompanied by the creation of a beveled edge, also called a chamfered edge.<br>
The present invention will be better understood on reading the detailed description below of<br>
nonlimiting exemplary embodiments and the accompanying figures.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a perspective view of a flat substrate made of soda-lime-silicate glass 1<br>
having, on one part of its periphery, a mastic 3 comprising silicone-type components. The silicone<br>
oils migrate to the surface 2 of said substrate 1, and create a polluted surface 4 that is extremely<br>
hydrophobic and difficult to clean.<br>
The substrate 1 from figure 2, represented here in cross section, on the other hand retains a<br>
clean surface 2 thanks to the use of a barrier to the migration of silicones 5 based on MS<br>
polymer, more particularly MS polymer composed of a polyoxypropylene chain terminated by<br>
dimethoxysilyl groups. The bead of MS polymer 5 is deposited here in direct contact with the<br>
mastic 3.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a different embodiment, as the bead of polymer 5 acting as a barrier to the<br>
migration of silicones is deposited at about 5 millimeters from the mastic 3, a configuration that<br>
has an even greater effectiveness. In the case represented in the present figure, the substrate 1<br>
also has on one of its faces, a thin film 6, the surface 2 of said substrate 1 then being classed as<br>
the surface of said thin film 6, as only this surface 2 is capable of being polluted by the silicones.<br>
The thin film 6 is here a coating of around 15 to 20 nanometers, based on predominantly<br>
crystalline titanium oxide in the crystallographic anatase form, deposited by a chemical vapor<br>
deposition (CVD) technique. This thin film 6 gives the surface 2 photocatalytic properties and a<br>
pronounced hydrophilic character. Since the substrate 1 is in this specific case made of soda-<br>
lime-silica glass, this thin film is advantageously placed not directly on the substrate	<br><br>
1 but on a sublayer that is a barrier to the migration<br>
of alkalis, not shown in the figure.<br>
The same type of substrate is presented in figure 4,<br>
but in this embodiment of the invention, the barrier to<br>
the migration of silicones is formed from a peripheral<br>
margination 7 of the thin film 6. This peripheral<br>
margination 7 has the effect of removing the thin film<br>
6 at the periphery of the substrate, thus creating a<br>
marginated zone 7 that is free from the thin film 6 and<br>
not covered by the mastic 3.<br>
Figure 5 presents another embodiment according to the<br>
invention, according to which the barrier to the<br>
migration of silicones is a notch 8. The thin film 6 is<br>
of the same type as that presented in figure 3.<br>
The effectiveness of the latter embodiment is presented<br>
in the photograph of figure 6: the mastic 3 forms the<br>
black-colored part on the left of the figure, the<br>
groove 8 being positioned vertically approximately in<br>
the center of the figure. After sprinkling with water,<br>
the part of the surface 2 located on the left of the<br>
groove 8 has a very strong hydrophobic character that<br>
is expressed by high water contact angles and that is<br>
polluted by silicone oils. On the contrary, the part of<br>
the surface 2 located on the right of the groove is<br>
perfectly hydrophilic, therefore it is not polluted by<br>
silicone oils.<br>
The present invention is described in what has gone<br>
before by way of example. It is understood that a<br>
person skilled in the art is able to carry out various<br>
variants of the invention without so much as going<br>
outside the scope of the patent as defined by the<br>
claims.<br><br>
