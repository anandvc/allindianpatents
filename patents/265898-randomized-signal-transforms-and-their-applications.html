				<td>RANDOMIZED SIGNAL TRANSFORMS AND THEIR<br>
APPLICATIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[OOOl] The present invention generally relates to signal transforms, and<br>
more particularly, to randomized signal transforms andor their applications.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] As digital communication becomes more commonplace, the need for<br>
securing andlor authenticating the transferred digital data becomes increasingly<br>
more important. Digital signals carrying digital data is often (if not always)<br>
transformed into a specific format (e.g., by a transform) prior to being transferred.<br>
For example, a file containing digital data may be compressed prior to sending it<br>
over the Internet.<br>
[00031 , Since more powerhl computers, high-speed Internet connections,<br>
and superior compression technologies are available to most users, the demand for<br>
digital media content is greater than ever. With instant and anytime access to<br>
literally millions of their favorite music and videos, consumers are applauding the<br>
convenience that digital distribution has afforded them. They enjoy being able to<br>
download or stream music to their hard drive or personal computer hard drive as<br>
fluidly as any television broadcast.<br>
*<br>
[0004] While the demand for digital content grows, however, so does the<br>
potential for its unauthorized use. Without a secure distribution system in place,<br>
digital media files can be easily copied or compressed into smaller files without<br>
the content owner's authorization. These files can then be transferred across the<br>
Internet for others to use or distribute freely. This violates the copyrights held by<br>
thousands of media companies, record labels, filmmakers, and recording artists.<br>
Such unauthorized use also strips these entities of valuable revenues as well.<br>
[OOOS] One current approach is to encrypt the digital content to limit its<br>
unauthorized use. This approach, however, introduces additional overhead which<br>
can reduce the speed of systems utilizing signal transformation.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, signal transformation solutions are desired which<br>
provide additional security while limiting performance degradation.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Techniques are disclosed to provide randomized signal transforms<br>
and/or their applications. More particularly, a signal (e.g., an audio or video signal)<br>
is transformed by applying randomly-selected basis hctions to the signal. The<br>
applications of the randomized signal transforms include, but are not limited to,<br>
compression, denoising, hashing, identification, authentication, and data<br>
embedding (e.g., watermarking).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020] The following disclosure generally describes techniques for<br>
improving signal transformation. More specifically, a family of signal transforms,<br>
referred to herein as randlet transforms (RTs), are applied to signals (such as audio<br>
and/or video signals) to provide security, while maintaining reasonable<br>
performance. Each family member transform uses a set of basis hnctions (also<br>
referred to herein as "randlets") that are chosen randomly or pseudorandomly<br>
based on a secret key (K). In various described implementations, the application of<br>
RT can result in improved data embedding (e.g., watermarking), identification,<br>
authentication, hashing, denoising, and/or compression.<br>
[0022] Fig. 1 illustrates an exemplary randlet transform (RT) system 100.<br>
An RT module 102 receives input data (104) such as an audio andlor video signal.<br>
The signal may be provided by a computer-readable medium, by a source<br>
connected to a computer network (e.g., an intranet, the Internet, a wireless<br>
network, etc.), and the like (as will be further discussed with reference to the<br>
computing environment of Fig. 11).<br>
*<br>
[0023] The RT module 102 transforms the input signal using a set of basis<br>
functions (106) that are selected randomly. The randomness is provided by a<br>
random number generated (or multiple random numbers generated) by a<br>
pseudorandom generator (108). In an implementation, the pseudorandom<br>
generator (108) is seeded by a secret key (K) (110). The secret key (K) may be<br>
provided as a bit stream. In one implementation, the generator 108 is a<br>
cryptologically-strong pseudorandom generator. The output of the RT module 102<br>
(e.g., a vector) can be used for a number of applications (112), which will be<br>
further discussed, for example, with reference to Figs. 6- 10.<br>
[0024] Fig. 2 illustrates an exemplary RT method 200. After RT basis<br>
functions are generated (202) (as will be further discussed with reference to Figs. 3<br>
and 4), a number of the generated basis functions are selected at random (204)<br>
such as discussed with reference to Fig. 1. In an implementation, a secret key (K)<br>
(e.g., used as a seed for a pseudorandom number generator) specifies which basis<br>
functions should be selected for a particular instance. An input signal (104) is then<br>
b<br>
transformed by applying the randomly selected basis functions (206). In an<br>
implementation, the input signal may be divided into blocks as will be mher<br>
discussed with reference to Fig. 5, for example.<br>
[0025] Moreover, the RT may be applied as a discrete transform. The<br>
provided randomness may give the RT two distinct advantages. First, it is useful<br>
for security purposes because an attacker cannot know which basis functions are<br>
9'<br>
used in the transform, making attacks relatively much more difficult. Second,<br>
because the basis is chosen at random from a relatively large set of basis functions,<br>
the worst-case performance of the transform occurs with relatively low probability.<br>
The measure for the RT is therefore the average-case performance rather than the<br>
worst-case performance.<br>
[0027] The basis functions (also referred to herein as "randlets") are based<br>
on a set of two-dimensional functions called "mother randlets." A variety of<br>
mother randlets are discussed below. It is envisioned that basis functions that are<br>
one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional (e.g., corresponding to<br>
audio signals, images, and video signals, respectively) may be utilized.<br>
[0028] Fig. 3 illustrates an exemplary method 300 for generating RT basis<br>
functions. Generally, a randlet is produced by scaling (302), rotating (304),<br>
translating (306), discretizing (308), and normalizing (310) a mother randlet.<br>
Other orders of stages 302, 304, 306, and/or 308-310 are also envisioned.<br>
Furthermore, rotation may not be done for certain distributions such as<br>
symmetrical Gaussian distributions (i.e., rotation of a circle is not done).<br>
[0029] In an implementation, given a mother randlet m(x,y) , a randlet with<br>
horizontal translation a, vertical translation b, horizontal scaling a, vertical<br>
scaling P, and rotation 6 would be:<br>
[0033] Accordingly, to choose the specific randlets used in an instance of<br>
the RT, the secret key (K) is used to seed a pseudorandom number generator (such<br>
as 108 of Fig. 1). And, whenever a random number is needed, it is taken &amp;om this<br>
pseudorandom number generator.<br>
[0035] Fig. 4 illustrates an exemplary method 400 for generating an RT<br>
basis functions library. Generally, it is possible to define an RT basis by choosing<br>
all randlets independently and at random. In one implementation, however, this is<br>
unnecessary for practical reasons, as equal performance can be achieved by<br>
slightly constraining the choices of randlets. Furthermore, by limiting the choices<br>
of randlets, computational performance may be significantly improved.<br>
[0036] In an implementation, the basis fbnctions are constrained by<br>
allowing only a finite set of scaling and rotation operations, instead of choosing<br>
the scaling and rotation independently for each randlet. Instead of defining each<br>
randlet independently of all others, a random library of non-translated randlets is<br>
generated. These randlets are known as "step-mother randlets," and are generated<br>
by randomly scaling and rotating the mother randlets (402 and 404, respectively).<br>
This set of all step-mother randlets may be referred to as the "library" (406).<br>
100371 Each mother randlet is scaled randomly in both directions. The<br>
distributions for the scaling depend on both the specific mother randlet and the<br>
application. Examples are given in later sections. For each scaled mother randlet,<br>
the number of rotations generated may be proportional to the perimeter.<br>
[0038] The step-mother randlets are translated (408), discretized (410), and<br>
normalized (412). Because a step-mother randlet is a discretized version of a<br>
mother randlet that has been scaled and rotated by real numbers, the normalization<br>
constant is determined by setting the inner product of the randlet with itself equal<br>
to 1. Hence:<br>
[0041] Note that K depends on a and P .<br>
[0042] The following several important values are parameters for the<br>
creation of an RT basis:<br>
[0043] n: The total number of basis functions.<br><ru>: The width and height of the block to be transformed,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0045] FC): An algorithm which determines the type of each randlet.<br>
[0046] The full set of randlets is generated by randomly choosing and<br>
translating (408) step-mother randlets from the library. This is done by generating<br>
a list of n 3-tuples, with each one representing one randlet that will be used in the<br>
transform: <i>. In the 3-tuples, i is in index to the library, and so implicitly<br>
determines the scaling and rotation of the randlet. i is chosen at random by the<br>
function FC). The exact function F used depends on the application. a and b are<br>
the real-valued horizontal and vertical translation of center point of the randlet,<br>
chosen uniformly at random from [O,T] and [O,U], respectively. In an<br>
implementation, once the list has been generated, it is sorted according to the size<br>
of the randlets, e.g., with the largest randlets first and the smallest randlets last.<br>
[0048] As discussed above, mother randlets are the base randlets from<br>
which all others are created as discussed with reference to Fig. 4. Mother randlets<br>
are two-dimensional real-valued functions with localized effective support,<br>
centered around (0,O). There are generally two types of mother randlets, lowfrequency<br>
randlets and high-frequency randlets. Both types of randlets have a<br>
Gaussian shape in the horizontal direction. In the vertical direction, low-frequency<br>
randlets have a Gaussian shape while high-frequency randlets have an oscillatory<br>
i<br>
shape. The only high-frequency randlet is also known as the Gaussian randlet. It is<br>
usell for finding low-frequency components of an image or audio content. It has<br>
a Gaussian shape in both the horizontal and vertical directions, although each<br>
direction can have different widths.<br>
[0049] Gaussian Randlet:<br>
[0051] High-frequency randlets have a Gaussian shape in the horizontal<br>
direction and various oscillatory shapes in the vertical direction. Since they will be<br>
rotated, we refer to the smooth direction as the direction of the Gaussian, and the<br>
rough direction as the direction of the oscillatory function. The variations in the<br>
vertical direction give these randlets edge-detection properties in the horizontal<br>
direction. When rotated by B degrees, they will tend to detect edges at B degrees.<br>
Other types of randlets include:<br>
[0052] Half Randlet:<br>
[0053] 0~x2+uyy2 m(x, Y) = we<br>
[0054] Mexican Hat Randlet:<br>
[0055] m(x, y) = q2e"=x2+cY~2<br>
[0056] Wavelet Randlet:<br>
[0057] m(x, y) = CDv(y)eUxx2<br>
[0058] The w@ portion of the wavelet randlet is a one-dimensional wavelet<br>
function. In an implementation, when scaling a wavelet randlet, instead of<br>
choosing a wavelet of fixed size, a wavelet family can be chosen, and instead of<br>
scaling, a longer or shorter member of the wavelet family can be chosen.<br>
[0059] Generally, high-frequency randlets are scaled so that the randlet is<br>
longer in the smooth direction than in the rough direction. This enhances the<br>
randlet's ability to detect edges.<br>
[0060] In an implementation, the mother randlets may be obtained by<br>
combinations of the Gaussian, half, Mexican Hat, andor wavelet randlets.<br>
[0061] RT TRANSFORMATION<br>
[0062] Fig. 5 illustrates an exemplary method 500 for applying RT<br>
transformations. The transform is done by projecting each randlet onto the signal<br>
in turn (502). The randlets may be selected pseudorandomly (e.g., as discussed<br>
with reference to Figs. 1-2). After each projection is taken, it is subtracted from the<br>
signal (504). What remains of the signal after the subtraction is called the<br>
"residue." The RT transformation method 500 continues by projecting each<br>
selected randlet onto the residue of the previous randlet (506). In this manner, the<br>
transform converges to the original signal, and the power of the coefficients tends<br>
to fall exponentially.<br>
[0063] A transform coefficient k is computed (508) for each randlet by<br>
finding the inner product of randlet k and the residue of randlet k-1. If the randlet k<br>
is denoted by rk, the residue of randlet rn is denoted by R,, and coefficient n is<br>
denoted by c, , then:<br>
[0065] As each coefficient is generated, it is quantized (510), and it is the<br>
quantized value that is stored (512) as the coefficient in the transform. In<br>
accordance with one implementation, it is also this quantized value that is<br>
subtracted fiom the signal (504). In an implementation, a uniform quantizer is<br>
used, basing the number of levels on type and scaling of the randlet. Randomized<br>
rounding may also be used, e.g., to round the coefficient based on a random<br>
number. The effects of randomized rounding may be accommodated by the<br>
iterative convergence of the algorithm.<br>
[0066] Once the quantization is complete, the next residue is computed<br>
(514). If Qc) is the quantizer, then:<br>
[0068] In an implementation, the randlets are not projected upon the entire<br>
signal block. The effective footprint of the randlets is computed in a preprocessing<br>
phase (not shown) by considering only the area where the randlets have nonnegligible<br>
value. The randlets are then only projected in that area.<br>
[0069] In an alternative implementation, the basis functions are placed as<br>
normal and then their positions are perturbed to the nearby location of maximum<br>
power. This makes the transform converge with fewer coefficients, but extra<br>
information would have to be stored with each coefficient giving the horizontal<br>
and vertical perturbation.<br>
[0070] Since the center of each randlet ranges uniformly across the whole<br>
signal block, the extremities of the randlets can reach outside of the block. This<br>
causes edge effects at the block boundaries. These edge effects may be eliminated<br>
by padding each block with a mirror signal of itself at each edge. In general, a<br>
padding of 5 to 10 pixels (e.g., for an image) is sufficient, even for very large<br>
images.<br>
[0072] Generally, a specific instance of the RT is generated to work on a<br>
specific size of signal block (e.g., an image). There are three ways to do this. First,<br>
the randlets can be chosen with centers in the range [O,l], and the transform can<br>
be expanded to the actual size of whatever signal block is chosen. One advantage<br>
of this method is that many coefficients of the transform will become scalinginvariant.<br>
However, to ensure that this transform will scale well for large data<br>
blocks, an enormous number of randlets may need to be chosen. These randlets<br>
will be redundant on small signals, but necessary to enable the transform to be<br>
taken to large scales.<br>
[0073] Another method is to define the transform for a maximum signal<br>
block size. This method is similar to the previous method, except that the number<br>
of basis functions can be bounded, since the maximum block size is known. There<br>
is still the problem of redundant basis functions on smaller blocks, though.<br>
[0074] The third method is to generate the transform for a relatively small<br>
block, e.g. images of 50 x 50 or 100 x 100. Any block that is larger than this size<br>
is decomposed into blocks of this size, transform is performed separately on all<br>
blocks. This method may be beneficial for transforms, because it avoids the<br>
redundant basis functions of the previous two methods. However, the first method<br>
is useful for applications of the RT such as hashing and watermarking, where a<br>
small number of basis functions can be used. These are further discussed below<br>
under the same titles.<br>
[0075] Furthermore, since most signal blocks will not come in integer<br>
multiples of the block size, the blocks may be padded with zero values to achieve<br>
a size that is a multiple of the block size. This padding may be removed as part of<br>
the inverse transform or reconstruction discussed below.<br>
[0076] In one implementation, the basis functions need not be completely<br>
and independently random. For example, the first basis function may be chosen<br>
completely randomly. For each subsequent basis function, a set of linear<br>
constraints may be generated which include constraints that ensure orthogonality<br>
to all previously-chosen basis functions andlor normalization. Such constraints<br>
*<br>
may also ensure that the shape of the basis function is a randlet. The next basis<br>
function may then be randomly chosen fiom the functions which fulfill the<br>
constraints. As additional basis functions are chosen, it may however become<br>
harder for functions to fulfill all of the constraints. In this situation, the next basis<br>
function may be chosen randomly fiom among the functions which approximately<br>
fulfill the constraints (e.g., almost orthogonal), such as defined by some threshold<br>
which may vary with the size of the desired basis function. In one implementation,<br>
this process can be implemented by an optimization algorithm.<br>
[0078] Fig. 6 illustrates an exemplary method 600 for RT-based<br>
compression. After quantization (e.g., stage 5 10 of Fig. 5), many of the transform<br>
coefficients may be zero. This distribution of coefficients lends itself very well to<br>
compression because these coefficients may be eliminated (602).<br>
[0079] Moreover, lossy compression may be performed to an arbitrary level<br>
by throwing out coefficients corresponding to the smallest randlets (602). With<br>
respect to the sorted list of randlets discussed with reference to Fig. 4, lossy<br>
compression may be achieved by using only the randlets near the beginning of the<br>
list, ignoring the randlets at the end of the list. Other lossy compression techniques<br>
may also be utilized such as: (1) the coefficients can be compressed more harshly;<br>
and/or (2) thresholds may be applied to the value of the coefficients, e.g., throwing<br>
out coefficients where the magnitude (e.g., absolute value) is below a certain<br>
threshold.<br>
[OOSO] Furthermore, the rate of lossy compression can be varied<br>
dynamically as well, so the amount of bandwidth spent on a signal block is made<br>
accordingly to the bandwidth available. Also, an image can be sent iteratively so<br>
that the basic representation appears first, and the details are filled in later.<br>
Moreover, when the list of basis functions is sorted by size (as discussed with<br>
reference to Fig. 4), this happens automatically.<br>
[0082] Fig. 7 illustrates an exemplary method 700 for RT-based denoising.<br>
First, the small basis functions are de-emphasized (702). Then, the super-position<br>
of the remaining basis functions cancels out much of the noise (704).<br>
[0084] The RT is an ideal tool for multimedia signal hashing such as image<br>
hashing. Even though this section discusses image hashing specifically in portions,<br>
it is envisioned RT based hashing may be generally applied to signals as will be<br>
discussed with reference to Fig. 8.<br>
[0085] With respect to image hashing, the generated hash value is believed<br>
to be robust to perturbations in the image, and the randomized nature of the basis<br>
functions ensures that the hash is hard to predict. A modified version of the RT of<br>
Fig. 5 may be used for hashing, because there are fewer requirements to hash than<br>
for the full transform. In particular, when using a transform to generate hash<br>
values, it is not necessary to be able to invert the hash values to produce the<br>
original signal. Therefore, many fewer coefficients are used when hashing than<br>
when performing a full image transform.<br>
[0086] Additionally, when hashing, it may be valuable to have each<br>
coefficient taken from a same distribution as all of the other coefficients, when<br>
taken over all images, for example. Therefore, the use of residues is not done when<br>
the RT is used for hashing. This simplifies the hashing algorithm and ensures that<br>
the power of hash coefficients are not reduced by previous randlets. Also, when<br>
residues are taken, later coefficients depend on earlier coefficients, so a small<br>
perturbation in a signal can cause large changes in later coefficients. This is an<br>
undesirable property for an approximate hash.<br>
[0087] In an implementation, the hashed vector can be quantized using a<br>
suitable lattice. For example, one can have a public key lattice for which a private<br>
key allows quantization easily, whereas quantization from the public key may<br>
introduce more errors. Accordingly, the public key basis would be the image of a<br>
private key basis for the lattice under a suitable unimodular matrix transformation.<br>
Moreover, the quantization also allows one to ignore small changes.<br>
[OOSS] Furthermore, when choosing a transform for a hash, the randlets do<br>
not have to be sorted by size (such as discussed with reference to Fig. 4). As<br>
a<br>
illustrated in Fig. 8, an RT-based hashing is done by first scaling the signal to a set<br>
size (802), for example 256 x 256, and then projecting each of the selected<br>
randlets directly onto the signal (804), without using residues. The transform<br>
coefficients are computed (806) (as discussed with reference to Fig. 5). The<br>
coefficients that are produced are then (heavily) quantized (808).<br>
[0089] Finally, error correction is applied to the quantized transform<br>
coefficients (810) and the coefficients are stored (8 12). In an implementation, an<br>
error-correcting code's decoder is used to shrink the hash value and make it even<br>
more resistant to perturbations.<br>
[0090] HASHINGF OR IDENTIFICATION/AUTHENTICATION<br>
[0091] Images (and signals generally) can be compared by performing an<br>
RT-based hashing (as discussed with reference to Fig. 8) and comparing the<br>
various hash values. However, for image identification or authentication, the errorcorrecting<br>
decoding is not necessary (810). As a result, each signal or image is<br>
associated with a vector of quantized transform coefficients. By comparing the<br>
vectors of coefficients based on a distance metric, signals can quickly be<br>
compared.<br>
[0092] In an implementation, the L2 norm is utilized. It is envisioned that<br>
the L, norm may produce better results, where n is large (since it magnifies large<br>
differences between coefficients while downplaying smaller differences).<br>
CI<br>
[0093] Coefficients can be compared directly, or as ratios. For example,<br>
comparing the ratios of statistics in one image to the ratios of the same statistics in<br>
other images can help to defeat equalization attacks. This is similar to normalizing<br>
the transform coefficients. Alternately, statistics can be formed which are functions<br>
of subsets of coefficients. Again, these can be compared directly, or as ratios.<br>
[0095] Fig. 9 illustrates an exemplary method 900 for RT-based<br>
watermarking. It is envisioned that the method 900 may more generally be utilized<br>
for data embedding. In watermarking (or more generally data embedding), the RT<br>
is defined for a relatively small number of unsorted randlets and no residues are<br>
taken, just like in RT-based hashing (see the discussion of Fig. 8 above). First, the<br>
signal size is scaled (902). For an image signal, the transform is defined on an<br>
image of canonical size, [O, I] x [0, I] and is scaled to the size of the image that is<br>
presented. The transform is performed by projecting the randlets directly onto the<br>
signal (904) and computing the transform coefficients (906) such as discussed with<br>
reference to Figs. 5 and 8.<br>
[0096] The watermark is then applied to the transform coefficients (908),<br>
which are inserted back into the signal (910), e.g., via a minimum-norm matrix<br>
solution to inverting the transform. To ensure that the matrix is well-behaved, the<br>
randlets may be chosen so that they do not substantially overlap. This may make it<br>
easier to identi@ and defeat the watermark, however.<br>
[0098] Fig. 10 illustrates an exemplary method 1000 for reconstruction of a<br>
signal transformed using RT. Because residues are used when taking the transform<br>
(as discussed with reference to Fig. 5), the projection of each randlet is orthogonal<br>
to the previous randlets. This means that the original image can be reconstructed<br>
by simply adding up the projection of each randlet. That is, multiply each randlet<br>
by the corresponding transform coefficient (1002) and add them together (1004) to<br>
provide the input signal (1006).<br>
[0099] For example, if I[i, j] is the image, then:<br>
[OOl 011 In one implementation, the reconstruction method 1000 can be<br>
applied to almost-orthogonal basis hctions. Accordingly, the reconstruction<br>
method 1000 may be applied when residues are used, when the basis functions are<br>
orthogonal, or when the basis functions are almost orthogonal.<br>
[00103] Fig. 11 illustrates a general computer environment 1100, which can<br>
be used to implement the techniques described herein. For example, the computer<br>
environment 1100 may be utilized to execute instructions associated with<br>
performing the tasks discussed with reference to the previous figures. The<br>
computer environment 1100 is only one example of a computing environment and<br>
is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or hnctionality of<br>
the computer and network architectures. Neither should the computer environment<br>
1100 be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one<br>
or combination of components illustrated in the exemplary computer environment<br>
1100.<br>
[OO 1041 Computer environment 1 100 includes a general-purpose computing<br>
device in the form of a computer 1102. The components of computer 1102 can<br>
include, but are not limited to, one or more processors or processing units 11 04<br>
(optionally including a cryptographic processor or co-processor), a system<br>
memory 1 106, and a system bus 1 108 that couples various system components<br>
including the processor 1 104 to the system memory 1 106.<br>
[00 1051 The system bus 11 08 represents one or more of any of several types<br>
of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus,<br>
an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of<br>
bus architectures. By way of example, such architectures can include an Industry<br>
Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, a Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, an<br>
Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, a Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA)<br>
local bus, and a Peripheral Component Interconnects (PCI) bus also known as a<br>
Mezzanine bus.<br>

[00106] Computer 1102 typically includes a variety of computer-readable<br>
media. Such media can be any available media that is accessible by computer 11 02<br>
and includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable<br>
media.<br>
[00107] The system memory 1 106 includes computer-readable media in the<br>
form of volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM) 1110, and/or<br>
non-volatile memory, such as read only memory (ROM) 1112. A basic<br>
inputJoutput system (BIOS) 1114, containing the basic routines that help to<br>
transfer information between elements within computer 11 02, such as during startup,<br>
is stored in ROM 11 12. RAM 11 10 typically contains data and/or program<br>
modules that are immediately accessible to and/or presently operated on by the<br>
processing unit 1 104.<br>
[00 1081 Computer 1102 may also include other removablelnon-removable,<br>
volatilelnon-volatile computer storage media. By way of example, Fig. 11<br>
illustrates a hard disk drive 11 16 for reading from and writing to a non-removable,<br>
non-volatile magnetic media (not shown), a magnetic disk drive 11 18 for reading<br>
from and writing to a removable, non-volatile magnetic disk 1120 (e.g., a "floppy<br>
disk"), and an optical disk drive 1122 for reading from and/or writing to a<br>
removable, non-volatile optical disk 1124 such as a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or<br>
other optical media. The hard disk drive 1116, magnetic disk drive 1118, and<br>
optical disk drive 1122 are each connected to the system bus 1108 by one or more<br>
data media interfaces 1126. Alternatively, the hard disk drive 11 16, magnetic disk<br>
drive 11 18, and optical disk drive 1122 can be connected to the system bus 1108<br>
by one or more interfaces (not shown).<br>
[00109] The disk drives and their associated computer-readable media<br>
provide non-volatile storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures,<br>
program modules, and other data for computer 1102. Although the example<br>
illustrates a hard disk 1116, a removable magnetic disk 1120, and a removable<br>
optical disk 1124, it is to be appreciated that other types of computer-readable<br>
media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic<br>
cassettes or other magnetic storage devices, flash memory cards, CD-ROM, digital<br>
versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, random access memories (RAM),<br>
read only memories (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only<br>
memory (EEPROM), and the like, can also be utilized to implement the exemplary<br>
computing system and environment.<br>
[OOllO] Any number of program modules can be stored on the hard disk<br>
11 16, magnetic disk 1120, optical disk 1124, ROM 11 12, andlor RAM 11 10,<br>
including by way of example, an operating system 1126, one or more application<br>
programs 1128, other program modules 11 30, and program data 1132. Each of<br>
such operating system 1126, one or more application programs 1128, other<br>
program modules 1130, and program data 11 32 (or some combination thereof)<br>

may implement all or part of the resident components that support the distributed<br>
file system.<br>
[OOlll] A user can enter commands and information into computer 11 02 via<br>
input devices such as a keyboard 1134 and a pointing device 1136 (e.g., a<br>
"mouse"). Other input devices 1138 (not shown specifically) may include a<br>
microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, serial port, scanner, andlor the like.<br>
These and other input devices are connected to the processing unit 1104 via<br>
inputloutput interfaces 1140 that are coupled to the system bus 1108, but may be<br>
connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port,<br>
or a universal serial bus (USB).<br>
[00112] A monitor 1142 or other type of display device can also be<br>
connected to the system bus 1108 via an interface, such as a video adapter 1144. In<br>
addition to the monitor 1142, other output peripheral devices can include<br>
components such as speakers (not shown) and a printer 1146 which can be<br>
connected to computer 1 102 via the inputloutput interfaces 1 140.<br>
[00113] Computer 1102 can operate in a networked environment using<br>
logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computing<br>
device 1148. By way of example, the remote computing device 1148 can be a<br>
personal computer, portable computer, a server, a router, a network computer, a<br>
peer device or other common network node, game console, and the like. The<br>
remote computing device 1148 is illustrated as a portable computer that can<br>
*<br>
include many or all of the elements and features described herein relative to<br>
computer 1 102.<br>
[00114] Logical connections between computer 1102 and the remote<br>
computer 1148 are depicted as a local area network (LAN) 1150 and a general<br>
wide area network (WAN) 11 52. Such networking environments are commonplace<br>
in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet.<br>
[00115] When implemented in a LAN networking environment, the<br>
computer 1 102 is connected to a local network 1 150 via a network interface or<br>
adapter 1154. When implemented in a WAN networking environment, the<br>
computer 1102 typically includes a modem 1156 or other means for establishing<br>
communications over the wide network 1152. The modem 1156, which can be<br>
internal or external to computer 11 02, can be connected to the system bus 11 08 via<br>
the input/output interfaces 1140 or other appropriate mechanisms. It is to be<br>
appreciated that the illustrated network connections are exemplary and that other<br>
means of establishing communication link(s) between the computers 1102 and<br>
1 148 can be employed.<br>
[00116] In a networked environment, such as that illustrated with computing<br>
environment 1100, program modules depicted relative to the computer 1102, or<br>
portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device. By way of<br>
example, remote application programs 11 58 reside on a memory device of remote<br>
computer 1148. For purposes of illustration, application programs and other<br>
Ilr<br>
executable program components such as the operating system are illustrated herein<br>
as discrete blocks, although it is recognized that such programs and components<br>
reside at various times in different storage components of the computing device<br>
11 02, and are executed by the data processor(s) of the computer.<br>
[00117] Various modules and techniques may be described herein in the<br>
general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules,<br>
executed by one or more computers or other devices. Generally, program modules<br>
include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform<br>
particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Typically, the<br>
hctionality of the program modules may be combined or distributed as desired in<br>
various implementations.<br>
[OOllS] An implementation of these modules and techniques may be stored<br>
on or transmitted across some form of computer-readable media. Computerreadable<br>
media can be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By<br>
way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise<br>
"computer storage media" and "communications media."<br>
[00119] "Computer storage media" includes volatile and non-volatile,<br>
removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology<br>
for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures,<br>
program modules, or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not<br>
limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology,<br>
II<br>
CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic<br>
cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices,<br>
or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which<br>
can be accessed by a computer.<br>
[00120] "Communication media" typically includes computer-readable<br>
instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data<br>
signal, such as carrier wave or other transport mechanism. Communication media<br>
also includes any information delivery media. The term "modulated data signal"<br>
means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a<br>
manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not<br>
limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or<br>
direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, radio fiequency<br>
(RF), infrared (IR), wireless fidelity (e.g., IEEE 802.11b wireless networking)<br>
(Wi-Fi), cellular, Bluetooth enabled, and other wireless media. Combinations of<br>
any of the above are also included within the scope of computer-readable media.<br>

structural features andor methodological acts, it is to be understood that the<br>
invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific<br>
