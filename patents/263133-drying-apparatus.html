				<td>Drying Apparatus<br>
The invention relates to drying apparatus which makes use of a narrow jet of high<br>
velocity, high pressure air to dry an object, including part of the human body.<br>
Particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates to a hand dryer in which the air jet<br>
is emitted through a slot-like opening in the casing of the hand dryer.<br>
The use of air jets to dry hands is well known. Examples of hand dryers which emit at<br>
least one air jet through a slot-like opening are shown in GB 2249026A, JP 2002-<br>
034835A and JP 2002306370A. However, in practice it is very difficult to achieve an<br>
evenly distributed airflow of sufficiently high momentum to dry the user's hands<br>
efficiently in an acceptably short length of time. Furthermore, the amount of noise<br>
emitted by a motor suitable for generating an airflow of sufficiently high momentum<br>
adequately to dry the user's hands can be unacceptably high.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide drying apparatus in which an airflow of<br>
sufficient momentum efficiently to dry the user's hands is produced and in which the<br>
noise emitted by the motor is improved in comparison to prior art devices. It is a further<br>
object of the present invention to provide drying apparatus in which the noise emitted<br>
by the apparatus is comparatively low.<br>
A first aspect of the invention provides drying apparatus having a casing, a cavity<br>
formed in the casing for receiving an object, a fan located in the casing and capable of<br>
creating an airflow, a motor provided in the casing for driving the fan and ducting for<br>
carrying the airflow from the fan to at least one opening arranged to emit the airflow<br>
into the cavity, wherein the ducting comprises at least one air duct in which at least one<br>
vane is located, the or each vane extending in the direction of airflow and dividing the<br>
air duct into a plurality of airflow portions.<br>
2<br><br>
Preferably, the or each vane is positioned in the air duct such that the distance between<br>
the said vane and any adjacent wall of the air duct or further vane is no more than a<br>
predetermined value. This predetermined value is determined in such a way that it is no<br>
greater than the half-wavelength of the noise emitted by the motor, hi this way,<br>
standing waves are prevented form building up in the air duct but plane waves are<br>
allowed to pass along the air duct. This reduces the noise emitted by the machine<br>
overall and so enhances the comfort with which the user is able to use the drying<br>
apparatus.<br>
The predetermined value is therefore calculated as a function of both the operating<br>
speed of the motor and the speed of sound in the airflow passing along the air duct.<br>
Motor speeds vary from product to product and the speed of sound in the airflow will<br>
depend upon the expected operating temperature of the apparatus. However, an<br>
optimum predetermined value can be calculated. The formula to be used is thus:<br><br>
If the normal operating temperature of the apparatus is approximately 55Â°C, this can be<br>
simplified to:<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the operating speed of the motor is substantially 90,000rpm<br>
which puts the predetermined value at 120mm, although the preferred range of<br>
predetermined values is between 100mm and 150mm. In the embodiment, the distance<br>
between any point on the or each vane and the wall of the air duct or adjacent vane<br>
(measured in a direction perpendicular to the airflow) is sufficiently small to prevent<br>
standing waves being able to build up. The noise of the hand dryer is thus improved in<br>
comparison to the noise which would have been emitted absent the vanes.<br>
It is preferred that more than one vane is arranged in the or each air duct and that the<br>
vanes are arranged in rows, more preferably rows which overlap one another. If the<br>
3<br><br>
breadth of each air duct increases in the direction of the airflow, each successive row of<br>
vanes has a higher number of vanes than the previous row.<br>
The provision of the vanes in the air ducts assists in strengthening the structure of the air<br>
ducts and their direction helps to maintain the direction of airflow within the ducts,<br>
particularly as the duct becomes broader.<br>
An embodiment of the invention in the form of a hand dryer will now be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

Figure 7 is an isometric view of the ducting forming part of the hand dryer of Figure 1<br>
shown in isolation from the other components of the apparatus; and<br>
4<br><br>
Figure 8 is a sectional view of one of the air ducts of Figure 7 showing the location of a<br>
plurality of vanes.<br>
Referring firstly to Figures 1 and 2, the hand dryer 10 shown in the drawings comprises<br>
an outer casing 12 having a front wall 14, a rear wall 16, an upper face 18 and side walls<br>
20, 22. The rear wall 16 can incorporate fixing devices (not shown) for securing the<br>
hand dryer 10 to a wall or other structure prior to use. An electrical connection (not<br>
shown) is also provided on the rear wall or elsewhere on the casing 12. A cavity 30 is<br>
formed in the upper part of the casing 12 as can be seen from Figures 1 and 2. The<br>
cavity 30 is open at its' upper end and delimited thereat by the top of the front wall 14<br>
and the front of the upper face 18. The space between the top of the front wall 14 and<br>
the front of the upper face 18 forms a cavity entrance 32 which is sufficiently wide to<br>
allow a user's hands to be introduced to the cavity 30 through the cavity entrance 32.<br>
The cavity 30 is also open to the sides of the hand dryer 10 by appropriate shaping of<br>
the side walls 20, 22.<br>
The cavity 30 has a front wall 34 and a rear wall 36 which delimit the cavity 30 to the<br>
front and rear respectively. Located in the lowermost end of the cavity 30 is a drain 38<br>
which communicates with a reservoir (not shown) located in the lower part of the casing<br>
12. The purpose of the drain and reservoir will be described below.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, a motor (not shown) is located inside the casing 12 and a fan 40,<br>
which is driven by the motor, is also located inside the casing 12. The motor is<br>
connected to the electrical connection and is controlled by a controller 41. The inlet 42<br>
of the fan 40 communicates with an air inlet 44 formed in the casing 12. A filter 46 is<br>
located in the air passageway connecting the air inlet 44 to the fan inlet 42 so as to<br>
prevent the ingress of any debris which might cause damage to the motor or the fan 40.<br>
The outlet of the fan 40 communicates with a pair of air ducts 50, 52 which are located<br>
inside the casing 12. The front air duct 50 is located primarily between the front wall 14<br>
of the casing 12 and the front wall 34 of the cavity 30, and the rear air duct 52 is located<br>
primarily between the rear wall 16 of the casing 12 and the rear wall 36 of the cavity 30.<br>
5<br><br>
The air ducts 50, 52 are arranged to conduct air from the fan 40 to a pair of opposed<br>
slot-like openings 60, 62 which are located in the front and rear walls 34, 36<br>
respectively of the cavity 30. The slot-like openings 60, 62 are arranged at the upper<br>
end of the cavity 30 in the vicinity of the cavity entrance 32. The slot-like openings 60,<br>
62 are each configured so as to direct an airflow generally across the cavity entrance 32<br>
towards the opposite wall of the cavity 30. The slot-like openings 60, 62 are offset in<br>
the vertical direction and angled towards the lowermost end of the cavity 30.<br>
Figure 4 shows the upper ends of the air ducts 50, 52 and the slot-like openings 60, 62<br>
in greater detail. As can be seen, the walls 54a, 54b of the air duct 50 converge to form<br>
the slot-like opening 60 and the walls 56a, 56b of the air duct 52 converge to form the<br>
slot-like opening 62. Even greater detail can be seen in Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5<br>
shows that the slot-like opening 60 has a width of Wl and Figure 6 shows that the slot-<br>
like opening 62 has a width of W2. The width Wl of the slot-like opening 60 is smaller<br>
than the width W2 of the slot-like opening 62. The width Wl is 0.3mm and the width<br>
W2 is 0.4mm.<br>
Each pair of walls 54a, 54b, 56a, 56b is arranged so that the respective walls approach<br>
one another as they approach the respective slot-like opening 60, 62. If an imaginary<br>
axis 70 is considered to lie midway between each pair of walls, as is shown in Figures 5<br>
and 6, then each wall 54a, 54b, 56a, 56b lies at an angle of substantially 7Â° to the<br>
respective axis 70. Thus the angle formed between each pair of walls 54a, 54b, 56a,<br>
56b is thus substantially 14Â°. This angle has been found to be advantageous, although it<br>
could be varied by several degrees. Angles of between 10Â° and 20Â° may be used.<br>
Sensors 64 are positioned in the front and rear walls 34, 36 of the cavity 30 immediately<br>
below the slot-like openings 60, 62. These sensors 64 detect the presence of a user's<br>
hands which are inserted into the cavity 30 via the cavity entrance 32 and are arranged<br>
to send a signal to the motor when a user's hands are introduced to the cavity 30. As<br>
can be seen from Figures 1 and 3, the walls 54a, 54b, 56a, 56b of the ducts 50, 52<br>
6<br><br>
project slightly beyond the surface of the front and rear walls 34, 36 of the cavity 30.<br>
The inward projection of the walls 54a, 54b, 56a, 56b of the ducts 50, 52 reduces the<br>
tendency of the user's hands to be sucked towards one or other of the walls 34, 36 of the<br>
cavity, which enhances the ease with which the hand dryer 10 can be used. The<br>
positioning of the sensors 64 immediately below the inwardly projecting walls 54a, 54b,<br>
56a, 56b of the ducts 50, 52 also reduces the risk of the sensors 64 becoming dirty and<br>
inoperative.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 2, the shape of the cavity entrance 32 is such that the front<br>
edge 32a is generally straight and extends laterally across the width of the hand dryer<br>
10. However, the rear edge 32b has a shape which consists of two curved portions 33<br>
which generally follow the shape of the backs of a pair of human hands as they are<br>
inserted downwardly into the cavity 30 through the cavity entrance 32. The rear edge<br>
32b of the cavity entrance 32 is substantially symmetrical about the centre line of the<br>
hand dryer 10. The intention of the shaping and dimensioning of the front and rear<br>
edges 32a, 32b of the cavity entrance 32 is that, when a user's hands are inserted into<br>
the cavity 30 through the cavity entrance 32, the distance from any point on the user's<br>
hands to the nearest slot-like opening is substantially uniform.<br>
The air ducts 50, 52 form part of the ducting 90 which lies between the fan 40 and the<br>
slot-like openings 60, 62. A perspective view of the ducting 90 is shown in Figure 7.<br>
The ducting 90 includes a scroll 92 which lies adjacent the fan 40 and receives the<br>
airflow generated by the fan 40. The scroll 92 communicates with a first chamber 94<br>
which is generally square in cross-section, although the cross-section could easily be<br>
generally circular. The intention is that the cross-section of the chamber 94 should have<br>
dimensions which are substantially the same in both directions. Immediately<br>
downstream of the chamber 94 is a Y-junction 96 downstream of which the air ducts 50,<br>
52 are located. As has been described above, the air ducts 50, 52 pass towards the upper<br>
end of the casing 12 with the front air duct 50 being located between the front wall 14 of<br>
the casing 12 and the front wall 34 of the cavity 30 and the rear duct 52 being located<br>
between the rear wall 16 of the casing 12 and the rear wall 36 of the cavity 30. The air<br>
7<br><br>
ducts 50, 52 communicate with the slot-like openings 60, 62 at the upper end of the<br>
cavity 30.<br>
The ducting 90 is designed so that the cross-sectional area of the ducting 90 gradually<br>
transforms from the generally square (or circular) shape of the chamber 94 to the slot-<br>
like shape of the openings in a smooth and gradual manner. Immediately downstream<br>
of the chamber 94, the ducting divides into the air ducts 50, 52, at the upstream end of<br>
which the cross-sectional area is still generally square in shape - ie, the breadth and<br>
depth of the cross-section are substantially similar. However, the cross-section changes<br>
gradually with distance from the chamber 94 so that the breadth of each duct 50, 52<br>
increases as the depth reduces. All of the changes are smooth and gradual to minimise<br>
any frictional losses.<br>
At a point 98 immediately upstream of each of the slot-like openings 60, 62, the cross-<br>
sectional area of each of the air ducts 60, 62 begins to decrease so as to cause the<br>
velocity of the airflow travelling towards the slot-like openings 60, 62 to increase<br>
dramatically. However, between the chamber 94 and the point 98 in each air duct 50,<br>
52, the total cross-sectional area of the ducting (ie. the combined cross-sectional area of<br>
the air ducts 50 and 52) remains substantially constant.<br>
Figure 8 shows the air duct 50 in section, the section being taken along the centre-line<br>
of the duct 50 itself. As can be seen, the lower end 50a of the duct 50 has a generally<br>
elongate cross-section and is adapted to communicate with one of the branches of the Y-<br>
junction 96. The upper end 50b of the air duct 50 communicates with the point 98<br>
which is immediately upstream of the slot-like opening 60. The air duct 50 broadens as<br>
it approaches the upper end 50b.<br>
Inside the air duct 50, three vanes 100 are provided. The vanes 100 have an elongate<br>
shape and lie so as to extend in the direction of the airflow passing along the air duct 50.<br>
To this end, the single upstream vane 100a is positioned so as to lie along the central<br>
axis of the duct 50 but the downstream vanes 100b are inclined slightly towards the side<br>
8<br><br>
walls of the duct 50 so as to follow the.steamlines of the airflow passing along the duct<br>
50. Each vane 100 has an upstream edge 102 and a downstream edge 104, and each<br>
edge 102, 104 is radiussed so as to minimise any turbulence created in the airflow by<br>
virtue of their presence.<br>
The position of the vanes 100a, 100b within the duct 50 is determined so that the<br>
distance between any one vane 100a, 100b and either the wall of the air duct 50 or an<br>
adjacent vane 100b is no more than half of the wavelength of the noise emitted by the<br>
motor. This is determined according to the operating speed of the motor and the<br>
velocity of sound within the airflow travelling along the air duct 50. It will be<br>
appreciated that this distance can be calculated according to the formula:<br><br>
It will also be appreciated that the speed of sound in the airflow will vary according to<br>
the temperature and pressure of the airflow. To simplify the calculation, it has been<br>
found effective to use in this equation the speed of sound in the airflow at the slot-like<br>
openings, which is the point at which the temperature is likely to be lowest. Under<br>
normal operating conditions of the hand dryer shown in the embodiment, we expect the<br>
airflow temperature at the slot-like openings to be approximately 55Â°C - at which<br>
temperature the speed of sound in air is approximately 360m/s. The predetermined<br>
value can them be calculated using the simplified formula:<br><br>
In the embodiment, the motor is designed to operate at a speed of approximately 90,000<br>
rpm. The predetermined value is then calculated to be 120mm. Other speeds of the<br>
motor result in the predetermined value being.selected to be between 100mm and<br>
150mm.<br>
9<br><br>
Having calculated the predetermined value, the vanes 100a, 100b are positioned in the<br>
air duct 50 so that all relevant distances are no more than this value - and can be<br>
considerably less. The distances VI - V4 which are to be no greater than the<br>
predetermined value are shown in Figure 8.<br>
As the breadth of the air duct 50 increases, the need to provide larger numbers of vanes<br>
also increases. The vanes 100 are thus arranged in rows with a single vane 100a<br>
provided in the first, upstream row and two vanes 100b provided in the next row. If the<br>
breadth of the air duct 50 had been sufficiently large in the downstream area, or if the<br>
predetermined value had been smaller so that only two vanes 100b were insufficient,<br>
three vanes 100b could easily have been provided.<br>
The rows of vanes 100 are located so that the upstream edges 102 of the vanes 100b<br>
overlap with the downstream edge 104 of the vane 100a. This ensures that no point of<br>
the air duct 50 is left unrestricted in terms of the distance between the vanes 100 and the<br>
walls of the duct 50.<br>
It will be appreciated that vanes 100 are provided in the air duct 52 in the same manner<br>
as those provided in the air duct 50, with the predetermined value being calculated in<br>
the same way.<br>
The hand dryer 10 described above operates in the following manner. When a user's<br>
hands are first inserted into the cavity 30 through the cavity entrance 32, the sensors 64<br>
detect the presence of the user's hands and send a signal to the motor to drive the fan<br>
40. The fan 40 is thus activated and air is drawn into the hand dryer 10 via the air inlet<br>
44 at a rate of approximately 20 to 40 litres per second and preferably at a rate of least<br>
25 to 27 litres per second, more preferably air is drawn into the hand dryer 10 at a rate<br>
of 31 to 35 litres per second. The air passes through the filter 46 and along the fan inlet<br>
42 to the fan 40. The airflow leaving the fan 40 is divided into two separate airflows;<br>
one passing along the front air duct 50 to the slot-like opening 60 and the other passing<br>
along the rear air duct 52 to the slot-like opening 62.<br>
10<br><br>
As the airflow passes along the air ducts 50, 52, it divides into a plurality of airflow<br>
portions and flows past the vanes 100 located in each air duct 50, 52. The noise emitted<br>
by the motor is attenuated by the fact that the distance between the vanes 100 and the<br>
walls of the ducts 50, 52, and between the vanes 100 themselves, is restricted to a value<br>
which does not exceed the half-wavelength of the sound waves of the noise.<br>
The airflow is ejected from the slot-like openings 60, 62 in the form of very thin,<br>
stratified sheets of high velocity, high pressure air. As the airflows leave the slot-like<br>
openings 60, 62, the air pressure is at least 15kPa and preferably approximately 20 to 23<br>
kPa. Furthermore, the speed of the airflow leaving the slot-like openings 60, 62 is at<br>
least 80 m/s and preferably at least 100 or 150 m/s, more preferably approximately<br>
180m/s. Because the size of the slot-like opening 62 located at the end of the rear duct<br>
52 is greater than the size of the slot-like opening 60 located at the end of the front duct<br>
50, a larger volume of air is emitted from the duct 52 than from the duct 50. This<br>
provides a greater mass of air for drying the backs of the user's hands which is<br>
advantageous.<br>
The two thin sheets of stratified, high velocity, high pressure air are directed towards the<br>
surfaces of the user's hands which, during use, are inserted fully into the cavity 30 and<br>
are subsequently withdrawn from the cavity 30 via the cavity entrance 32. As the user's<br>
hands pass into and out of the cavity 30, the sheets of air blow any existing water off the<br>
user's hands. This is achieved reliably and effectively because of the high momentum<br>
of the air leaving the slot-like openings 60, 62 and because the airflow is evenly<br>
distributed along the length of each slot-like opening 60, 62.<br>
Each stratified sheet of air is directed towards the wall of the cavity 30 which is remote<br>
from the slot-like opening through which the respective sheet of air is emitted. Because<br>
the slot-like openings 60, 62 are also inclined towards the lowermost end of the cavity<br>
30, the emitted airflows are directed into the cavity 30. This reduces the risk of<br>
turbulent air movement being felt by the user outside the casing, e.g. in the user's face.<br>
11<br><br>
It is envisaged that it will take only a small number of "passes" of the hand dryer<br>
described above to dry a user's hands to a satisfactory degree. (By "pass", we mean a<br>
single insertion of the hands into the cavity and subsequent removal therefrom at a<br>
speed which is not unacceptable to an average user. We envisage that a single pass will<br>
have a duration of no more than 3 seconds.) The momentum achieved by the airflows is<br>
sufficient to remove the majority of water found on the surface of the user's hands after<br>
washing during a single pass.<br>
The water removed by the airflows is collected inside the cavity 30. Each airflow will<br>
rapidly lose its momentum once it has passed the user's hands and the water droplets<br>
will fall to the lower end of the cavity 30 under the forces of gravity whilst the air exits<br>
the cavity 30 either through the cavity entrance 32 or via the open sides of the cavity 30.<br>
The water, however, is collected by the drain 38 and passed to a reservoir (not shown)<br>
where it is collected for disposal. The reservoir can be emptied manually if desired.<br>
Alternatively, the hand dryer 10 can incorporate some form of water dispersal system<br>
including, for example, a heater for evaporating the collected water into the atmosphere.<br>
The means by which the collected water is dispersed does not form part of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the slot-like openings 60a, 62a can be arranged so that the<br>
sheets of air which are emitted therefrom are directed generally along planes which are<br>
substantially parallel to one another. This mirrirnises the amount of turbulent flow<br>
present inside the cavity 30 whilst the drying apparatus is in use.<br>
The invention is not intended to be limited to the precise detail of the embodiment<br>
described above. Modifications and variations to the detail which do not alter the scope<br>
of the invention will be apparent to a skilled reader. For example, the shape of the<br>
cavity 30 and its entrance 32 may be altered without departing from the essence of the<br>
present invention. Also, the operational speed of the motor is not limited to the value<br>
12<br><br>
given above but can be selected to provide the most suitable flowrate of air within the<br>
dryer.<br>
