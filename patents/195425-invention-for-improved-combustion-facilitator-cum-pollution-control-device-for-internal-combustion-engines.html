Improved Combustion Facilitator cum Pollution Control Device comprises of a rotor assembly fitted with permanent magnets, a stator assembly fitted with permanent magnets and an energizer chamber placed in the gap between the stator and rotor assemblies. A pulley, the drive for which is provided by a separate electric motor or taken from the engine to which the device is fitted, drives the rotor.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
It is known in the art that fuel is introduced into the cylinder after atomisation and mixing with air in the carburettor or directly injected into the cylinder as fine spray in multistages in a spark ignition petrol engine and diesel or kerosene a fine spray through injector nozzle into the cylinder in a compression Ignition engine. The atomisation obtained and the distribution of fuel inside the cylinder in these cases is not upto the desired level and results in incomplete combustion of the fuel. This leads to inefficient use of the fuel resulting in emission of partially burnt fuel as carbonmonoxide (Co) and unburnt fuel as Hydrocarbon (HC) into the atmosphere through the exhaust causing pollution of the atmosphere.<br>
The efficiency of combustion can be improved and emission of pollution brought down if the fuel molecules on entering the cylinder are uniformly distributed in the available volume such that each molecule or cluster of molecules is more or less equidistant from other surrounding molecules or molecular clusters. One of the methods to achieve this state is to ensure that the fuel when it enters the cylinder is in a higher energy state than what normally obtains.<br>
This invention as an attachment to the existing fuel line of an engine achieves such state to a great extent.<br>
1 2 DEC 2DD3<br><br>
It is known that hydrocarbon molecules are not ionic, i.e. they are electrically neutral without positive and negative ends. They have their centres of the positive and negative charges at one point. But they become polar with the centres of the positive and negative charges separated when introduced in a magnetic filed because the external magnetic field affects the internal magnetic moments of the electrons in the molecules. Such separations of the centres of positive and negative charges make the molecules electric dipoles.<br>
Such molecules being electric dipoles when moving in a magnetic field will tend to align in a particular direction and in a different direction when the magnetic field direction is changed.<br>
Energisation of the fuel is achieved in this invention to achieve better atomisation of the fuel and uniform distribution inside the cylinder leading to improved combustion, additional power, and reduction of pollutants released in to the atmosphere by the engine.<br>
The construction of the device is given in the drawings.<br>

.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS:<br>
With reference to the attached drawing pages 1,2, and 3, the rotor assembly consists of the body (1) and four permanent magnets (2), fitted with north and south poles of the magnets facing radially outward alternately with a pulley (3) to drive the rotor. The rotor assembly is enclosed by the stator assembly (4) fitted with pairs of permanent magnets (5) &amp; (6) with north and south poles facing radially inward alternately. The poles are alternate in each pair also. An energiser chamber (8) with inlet and outlet pipes (9) is placed in the gap between the rotor and stator assemblies. Two end plates (7) with bearings or bushes on which the rotor shaft floats, with openings to allow the inlet and outlet pipes keep the rotor assembly and the energiser chamber in place. The end plates are fastened to the stator assembly with bolts and nuts and nuts or some other means. The number of pairs of magnets fitted in the rotor and stator will vary depending on the speed of the rotor, speed of the fuel stream through the fuel pipes of the engine.<br>
Improved Combustion Facilitator cum Pollution Control Device for Internal Combustion Engines comprising a rotor assembly made up of a rotor body (1) fitted with permanent magnets (2) with north and south poles facing radially outward alternately and a pully (3) to drive the rotor, a stator assembly made up of body (4) fitted with pairs of permanent magnets (5,6) with north and south poles facing radially inward alternately in each pair and also circumferencialy, an energiser chamber (8) placed in the gap between the rotor and the stator assemblies with inlet and outlet pipes (9) and held in place by end plates (7) fastened by bolts and nuts and in which when the device is in operation substances passing through are subjected to alternating magnetic fields causing them to oscillate, acquire spin and reaching a higher energy state weakening the cohesive bonds among the molecules.<br>
) \ DtC 2C33<br><br>
When the engine is started the device is also started so that the rotor is also rotating. The fuel passes through the energiser chamber, which is so designed as to provide relaxation time to the fuel stream. The fuel in its transit time through the energiser chamber is subjected to alternating magnetic fields several times. The fuel molecules thus subjected to alternating magnetic fields in the chamber first align in one direction and then in the opposite direction and so on during their passage. The molecules are made to oscillate and some of the molecules acquire spin because of such frequent changes in their alignment. Such agitation and turbulence of the molecules results in a higher energy state of the fuel molecules. Molecules in higher energy states compared to their normal states in a given ambience will tend to be repulsed by other nearby high-energy molecules. Such states greatly weakens the cohesive bonds among the molecules just as it happens in any liquid when heat energy is applied to the liquid, the liquid molecules on reaching higher energy state pull apart from other such molecules weakening their cohesive bonds resulting in expansion of the liquid volume.<br>
Similarly in this case the higher energy state of the fuel molecules by the time they reach the end of their passage through the energiser chamber greatly weakens the cohesive bonds among the molecules. Such fuel with the molecules in higher energy state when they enter the cylinder of the engine the energized molecules fly apart resulting in better atomisation of the fuel. This better atomisation of the fuel and better distribution of molecules in the cylinder leads to improved combustion of the fuel, resulting in additional power and reduction in the release of CO and HC through the exhaust into the atmosphere because of more efficient and complete combustion of the fuel.<br><br>
This device is to be fitted in the fuel line after the AC pump and before the carburettor or after the pump and before the fuel metering unit in a petrol engine and after the diesel filters and before the fuel injection pump in a diesel engine. The device is to be fitted in a vertical position with the inlet pipes pointing down and the outlet pipes pointing up. An electrical lead is taken from the vehicle's electrical system to the motor attached to the device, which will drive the device's rotor when the engine is started.<br><br><br>
