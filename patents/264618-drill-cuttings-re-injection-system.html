DRILL CUTTINGS RE-INJECTION SYSTEM CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]      This application  is a non-provisional  utility application claiming  priority to  U.S.<br>
Provisional patent application no. 60/684,099, entitled, "Drill Cuttings Re-injection Systems," by<br>
Andy Dyson, Tom Robertson, and Marcio Laureano, filed May 24, 2005, incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
|ooo2|      The present invention relates generally to a system used to re-inject drilling cuttings or<br>
drilling slurry into an annulus in a subsea well. The present invention provides a system for a providing an increased re-injection rate into a pressure containing conduit while minimizing erosion caused by the flow of the re-injected drill cuttings. The present invention discloses configuring the re-injection inlet into a pressure containing conduit such that a cyclone effect is produced in the flow path of the drill cuttings, which minimizes erosion and may eliminate the need to hard face components of the system.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
|ooo3|      Environmental concerns can be an important issue in the drilling of subsea wells in<br>
different regions of the world. In particular, one environmental concern is the storage and safe disposal of cuttings produced during the drilling of subsea wells. Some regions with high particularly high environmental standards are the artic sector and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Regulatory requirements have been introduced in the Norwegian sector that would allow for the re-injection of drilling cuttings into the formation while the well is still being drilled.<br><br>
[0004] When drilling a subsea well, drilling mud is used to bring the drill cuttings to the surface where the mixture of drilling mud and cuttings, or slurry, may be filtered and stored. After being filtered, the slurry must be stored or disposed in accordance with environmental regulations of the region. As discussed above, one acceptable form of storage is the re-injection of the slurry into the well formation. The re-injection of slurry can be a complex process and can greatly increase the drilling time, and thus increase the cost spent on drilling a well. [0005] When re-injecting slurry into the well formation for storage the re-injection flow rate may be increased in an attempt to reduce the time that a drilling vessel needs to remain at a well. One disadvantage to increasing the re-injection flow rate is the increase in erosion of components used in the re-injection system. Slurry is a rather abrasive mixture as it contains drilling cuttings as well as potentially containing pieces broken off the drilling bit. Increased erosion decreases the useable life of a re-injection system and potentially could lead to failure during use. Although it is desirable to increase the re-injection flow rate, it must be balanced with the erosion caused by the re-injected slurry.<br>
|ooo6| The re-injection of slurry into a well formation may also lengthen the overall drilling time if the well cannot be drilled simultaneous to the re-injection of the slurry. In this instance the re-injection of slurry may be too costly to the overall drilling of a well. The modification of an existing wellhead to enable the use of a re-injection system may also increase the drilling costs per well. The re-injection system may also require a special running tool to install the system onto a subsea wellhead. The special running tool would also be an additional cost to a drilling company as well as the additional time and cost to train personal to use the special running tool. For these reasons, drilling companies may not be interested in using a re-injection system.<br><br>
[0007] The re-injection of slurry into an annulus of the well formation may cause undue wear on well components. For example, the slurry may be injected in an annulus that is between an inner casing and injection mandrel with the slurry being injected from the mandrel side towards the casing. The opening in the injection mandrel may cause the slurry to flow directly at the inner casing potentially causing erosion the inner casing. This possibility of erosion requires hard facing of the inner casing in an attempt to prevent undesirable erosion and possibly failure caused by the flow of the slurry. Hard facing of the casing is expensive and adds to the overall drilling costs associated with the well.<br>
[0008] During the drilling stage, the primary function of the well formation is to allow the drilling of the well to begin the production of hydrocarbons. A re-injection system that also utilizes the well formation to store drill cuttings may interfere with the drilling process causing the operators to switch between the two functions. Doing so would lengthen the time required to drill the well, thus increasing the overall drilling costs. To minimize costs, it would be beneficial if the re-injection system allowed for the injection of cuttings for storage while the well was being drilled. One possible problem is the transfer of drilling mud to the drilling site. The mud may have to travel through the re-injection system. It would be beneficial if a re-injection system allowed for the re-injection of slurry into the well while allowing for the passage of drilling mud downhole.<br>
[0009] In light of the foregoing, it would be desirable to provide a re-injection system that is adapted to store drill cuttings and/or slurry in an annulus of the well formation. It would further be desirable that the re-injection system may be connected to existing well head designs. It would also be desirable to provide a re-injection apparatus that provides for an increased diameter flow path thus allowing an increased flow of slurry, but also an apparatus that is<br><br>
configured such that the flow of slurry causes minimal erosion to the components of the apparatus. Additionally, it would be desirable to provide an injection system that has balanced injection ports that minimize the erosion on the boundary elements of the storage annulus. It would also be desirable to provide a re-injection system that may allow the drilling of the well concurrent to the injection of slurry within the well formation. Further, it would be desirable for the system to allow for the flow of material, such as drilling mud or cement, through the injection system to downhole locations without interrupting the re-injection of the slurry. [0010] The present invention is directed to overcoming, or at least reducing the effects of, one or more of the issues set forth above.<br>

[00371      While the invention  is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms.<br>
specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described<br>
in detail herein. However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited<br>
to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents<br>
and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
claims.<br>
Description of Illustrative Embodiments<br>
10038]      Illustrative embodiments of the  invention are described below as they might be<br>
employed in the use a system to re-inject drilling cutting back into a subsea formation. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.<br><br>
[0039]      Further aspects and advantages of the various embodiments of the invention will become apparent from consideration of the following description and drawings.<br>
[0040]Figure 1 shows the top view cross-section of a re-injection system 150 of the present disclosure. The re-injection system 150 includes an injection sleeve 5 of a drilling guide base 200. The drilling guide base 200 (shown in Figures 2 and 9) is adapted to be connected to conventional well heads and does not require the re-design of a new well head. The drilling guide base includes an injection sleeve 5 and an injection inlet 10. The injection inlet 10 includes a flow path 7 that allows for the flow of material from an injection source 8 through the injection inlet 10 and the injection sleeve 5. The injection inlet 10 is connected to an injection source 8, which may be in fluid communication with the surface to provide for the re-injection of filtered slurry, which includes drill cuttings. The drill cuttings may be filtered at a surface location by means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Various means could connect the injection inlet 10 to a source of filtered slurry as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. The injection inlet 10 provides for the re-injection of the cuttings into the remainder of the system through above referenced flow path 7. [0041] The flow path 7 of the injection sleeve 5 is in communication with an opening 15 of an injection adapter ring 20 positioned within the injection sleeve 5. The opening 15 is in fluid communication with a circular gallery 25 of an injection adapter ring 20. The circular gallery 25 circumscribes the inner diameter of the injection adapter ring 20 and provides a flow path for the re-injected slurry. As would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the dimensions of the circular gallery could be varied depending on the desired flow rate of the slurry through the re-injection system.<br><br>
[0042] The re-injection system of Figure 1 includes an isolation sleeve 40. The operation of the isolation sleeve 40, also referred to as a shut off sleeve, is described below in references to Figures 8A-8D. The isolation sleeve 40 is adapted to move between a first position and a second position when the drilling guide base 200 is removed. In the second position, isolation sleeve 40 blocks flow path 7 from communication with the opening 15 in the injection adapter ring 20 preventing the re-injection of slurry into the re-injection system 150. The isolation sleeve 40 may be moved into the second position to temporarily stop the re-injection of slurry or may be may be moved into the second position upon the completion of drilling the well bore by removal of the drilling guide base 200. The isolation sleeve may be slidably connected to the injection sleeve 5 and/or the injection adapter ring 20.<br>
[0043] The injection adapter ring 20 is connected to the conductor housing and includes a circular gallery 25 that circumscribes the inner diameter of the injection adapter ring 20. The circular gallery 25 is positioned to align with the flow path 7 of the injection sleeve 5. The circular gallery 25 provides a flow path for the slurry around the inner portion of the injection adapter ring 20. The shape and dimensions of the circular gallery may be varied to allow different flow rates of re-injected slurry as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, the injection adapter ring 20 may be a 30" ring.<br>
[0044] In the injection system 150 of Figure 1, an injection mandrel 50 is located within the injection adapter ring 20. The injection mandrel 50 includes injection ports 30. As shown in Figure 1, the injection mandrel may include two injection ports 30 that are in fluid communication with the circular gallery 25 of the injection adapter ring 20. The injection ports 30 may be balanced around the perimeter of the injection mandrel 50 to help minimize the amount or erosion caused by the flow of slurry within the system.   Additionally, the injection<br><br>
ports 30 may be configured to reduce erosion caused by the flow of slurry past the injection mandrel 50. For example, the entrance into the injection ports may be rounded and/or the ports may be angled or aligned with the flow path to minimize erosion. The number and configuration of injection ports 30 may be varied to provide multiple injection points around the injection mandrel 50 as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. The injection mandrel 50 of Figure 1 includes flow-by ports 55 that allow for the passage of material, such as cement or drilling mud, to pass through the re-injection system 150 without interrupting the re-injection of slurry.<br>
[0045] The injection ports 30 of the injection mandrel 50 are in communication with an annulus 57 between the injection mandrel 50 and an inner casing 60 (Shown in Figures 3 and 4). The injection ports 30 are configured to direct the flow of slurry into the annulus 57. The annulus 57 is used to store the slurry containing the drill cuttings in the well formation preventing potential environmental contamination by the drill cuttings. The opening size of the injection ports 30 could be varied to affect the flow rate into the annulus 57 as would be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.<br>
[0046] Figure 2 shows a side view cross-section of an injection system 150 of the present disclosure. A drilling guide base 200 may be connected to the conductor housing. The drilling guide base 200 includes an injection sleeve 5. An isolation sleeve 40 is positioned between the injection sleeve 5 and an adapter injection ring 20. The isolation sleeve 40 may be movable connected to the injection sleeve 5 and the adapter injection ring 20 such that isolation sleeve may be moved to prevent fluid communication between a flow path in the injection sleeve 5 and a flow path in the injection adapter ring 20.<br><br>
[0047] Figure 3 shows a top view cross-section of an embodiment of the re-injection system 150 wherein the injection mandrel 50 has four injection ports 30. In this embodiment there are two injection inlets 10 from which slurry may enter into the system. The injection inlets 10 may be positioned on opposite sides of the re-injection system, thus injection slurry into the system 150 in opposite directions. The location of the injections inlets 10 creates a cyclone effect within the circular gallery 25 of the injection adapter ring 20. The cyclone effect helps to minimize erosion as the slurry circles the gallery 25 and is directed into the annulus 57 by injection means. The injection means may be injection ports 30.<br>
[0048] As shown in Figure 3, the injection mandrel 50 may include four injection ports 30 angled to direct the flow of slurry into the annulus 57. The configuration of injection ports 30 may be balanced around the injection mandrel 50 to minimize erosion of the inner casing 60 due to the injection of slurry into the annulus 57. As shown, the flow 35 of the slurry is directed into the annulus 57 by the injection ports 30. A second inner casing 70 may be provided located within inner casing 60 creating a second annulus 58. As shown, two bypass ports 55 may be provided between each of the injection ports 30. The bypass ports 55 may allow the passage of material past the injection mandrel 50 without interruption to the injection of slurry into the annulus 57.<br>
[0049] Figure 4 shows a cut-away view of one embodiment of an injection mandrel 50. The injection mandrel 50 includes an injection port 30 which is in communication with a fluid flow path 31 around the injection mandrel 50. The injection port 30 is also in fluid communication with the inner cavity 32 of the injection mandrel 50. When installed in the re-injection system, the inner wall 33 of the injection mandrel 50 creates an annulus 57 with an inner casing 60. The fluid flow path 31 of the injection mandrel 50 is in fluid communication with the circular gallery<br><br>
25 of the injection adapter ring providing a flow path that allows the re-injected slurry to travel around the injection mandrel 50. The injection port 30 may be adapted to direct flow of the slurry through the injection port and into the annulus 57. The injection mandrel 50 also includes bypass ports 55 located around the perimeter. The bypass ports 55 allow for the passage of material past the injection mandrel 50 without interfering with the re-injection of slurry through injection ports 30 into the annulus 57. Although only one injection port 30 is shown in Figure 4, the number, location, and configuration of the injection ports 30 could be varied as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. The injection mandrel 50 also includes sealing means 51 to provide a sealing connection with the injection adapter ring 20 of the re-injection system 150.<br>
[0050] Figure 5 shows one embodiment of the injection adapter ring 20 of the present disclosure. The injection adapter ring 20 includes opening 15, which is in fluid communication with circular gallery 25 that circumscribes the perimeter of the injection adapter ring 20. When assembled as part of the re-injection system 150, the circular gallery 25 is in fluid communication with the fluid flow path 31 and injection ports 30 of the injection mandrel 50. The opening 15 of the injection adapter ring 20 is also in fluid communication with the fluid flow path 7 of the injection sleeve 5 as discussed above. The injection adapter ring 20 includes sealing means 21 to provide a sealing connection with the injection sleeve 5 of the drilling guide base 200.<br>
[0051] Figure 6 is a cross-section showing the isolation sleeve 40 in a closed position preventing the injection of slurry into injection adapter ring 20. Isolation sleeve 40 includes an opening 45 and is slidable connected to the injection adapter ring 20. When in the closed position, the opening 45 of the isolation sleeve 40 is no longer in fluid communication with the<br><br>
opening 15 of the injection adapter ring 20. As shown in Figure 6, the opening 15 of the injection adapter ring 20 is in fluid communication with a circular gallery 25 as well as an injection port 30 of an injection mandrel 50. The isolation sleeve 40 may be held in to closed position by a detent ring, as shown in Figure 7D.<br>
[00521 Figures 7A-7D show the retrieval of the drilling guide base once the drilling operations are concluded and there is no further need to re-inject drill cuttings into the wellhead. The drilling guide base running tool 300 (shown in Figure 9) is run to retrieve the drilling guide base 200. The running tool 300 unlatches the drilling guide base 200 from the conductor housing. As shown in Figure 7B, as the drilling guide base 200 moves upwards away from the wellhead the injection sleeve 5, pulls the isolation sleeve 40 upwards. Shear pins 85 connect the isolation sleeve 40 to the injection sleeve 5. The isolation sleeve 40 includes a recessed portion 86 adapted to receive a detent ring 90 positioned on the exterior of the injection adapter ring. Once the detent ring90 engages with the recess 86, the ring will close the sleeve and the sleeve shoulders out on an edge on the injection adapter ring allowing the shear pins to shear, thus releasing the drilling guide base 200 from the conductor housing. As shown in Figure 7C, the shear pin 85 breaks allowing the injection sleeve 5 to move upwards with respect to the isolation sleeve 40, which remains connected to the injection adapter ring 20. The isolation sleeve 40 seals the inlet in the injection adapter ring 20, as discussed above. After the shear pin 85 has sheared the drilling guide base 200 may be removed from the wellhead as shown in Figure 7D. [00531 Figure 8 is an isometric bottom view of the drilling guide base 200. The drilling guide base 200 includes an injection sleeve 5 that connects to the injection adapter ring when installed onto the wellhead. The drilling guide base 200 shown also includes two injection inlets 10 one the same side of the injection sleeve 5 that are in communication with a flow path through the<br><br>
injection sleeve 5. The location and number of injection inlets may be varied within the invention as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. The drilling guide base 200 also includes a slurry injection valve system to control the injection of slurry into the re-injection system. The valve may allow for the remote control of the re-injection system. The drilling guide base 200 also includes support legs 100 for support of the guide on the wellhead. The drilling guide base may be installed onto a wellhead in a number of different ways.<br>
100541 In a satellite application, the drilling guide base 200 may be previously installed onto an injector adapter ring 20 that then may be run to the wellhead. Alternatively, the drilling guide base may be run remotely and attached to the injector adapter ring 20. In both instances, the drilling guide base 200 may be retrieved from the wellhead prior to completion of the well. [00551 The pressure integrity of the injection adaptor ring 20 may be maintained by an external shut-off sleeve (see Figures 7A-7D) which seals the injection adapter ring inlet 15 when the drilling guide base 200 is no longer attached to the conductor housing. When the drilling guide base 200 is attached it pushes the external shut-off sleeve 40 to the open position providing communication between the injection inlet 10 and the circular gallery 25 of the injection adaptor ring 20. The interface between the drilling guide base 200 and the injection adaptor ring 20 is such that the sleeve 40 is automatically opened when the drilling guide base 200 is installed and closed when the drilling guide base 200 is removed. This may be in conjunction with control valves positioned in the flow loop to control any pressure which may appear in the re-injection system 150.<br>
100561 To prevent damage to the internal sealing surfaces on the injection adaptor ring 20, a sliding sleeve bore protector (SSBP) 320 may be included in the system as shown in Figure 9.<br><br>
The SSBP 320 is designed such that it is positioned to protect the seal surfaces during running the adaptor through to completion of drilling and remains in this position until the injection mandrel 50 is run. The injection mandrel lands on the top face of the SSBP 320 and slides it down thus exposing the sealing surfaces on the injection adaptor ring. When the injection mandrel is fully landed, the circular gallery 25 is formed with the seals on the injection mandrel 50 providing pressure containment. In the event that the injection mandrel 50 needs to be retrieved, the SSBP 320 will be automatically returned to it original position thus protecting the seal surfaces on the injection adaptor ring 20. The SSBP 320 provides the ability to pressure test the injection flow loop and valves on the drilling guide base 200 if the injection adaptor ring 20 is pre-installed in the drilling guide base 200. Further, SSBP 320 allows for pressure testing the seals between the injection adaptor ring 20 and the drilling guide base 200. [00571 The injection mandrel 50 may be run with a test plug 340 that seals on its bore as shown in Figure 10. The test plug 340 allows for the pressure testing of the injection mandrel 50 prior to re-injection. When the injection mandrel 50 has been landed within the system a pressure test can be performed on the inner diameter of the injection mandrel 50 to test the integrity of the seals between the outer diameter injection mandrel 50 and the inner diameter of the injection adaptor ring 20.<br>
100581 In another embodiment, a different SSBP 330 may be an integral part of a template receptacle as shown in Figure 11. This allows the for the pressure testing of the valves and injection flow loop by pressurising against the SSBP 330. The SSBP 330 is locked in position during drilling operations and protects the sealing areas that will be used by the injection adaptor ring 20.<br><br>
10059] In order to land the injection adaptor ring 20 into its final position within the re-injection system 150, the SSBP 330 has to be first unlocked from its original position in the template receptacle. Typically, the SSBP 330 will be unlocked by a remote operated vehicle causing it to automatically move to the open position as shown in Figure 12. If the injection adapter ring 20 needs to be retrieved from the re-injection system 150, the SSBP 330 will automatically slide back to its original position thus protecting the seal surfaces. As with the above embodiment, a SSBP 320 may be prevent damage to the internal sealing surfaces of the injection adapter ring 20 providing the ability to pressure test the injection flow loop and valves on the template and the seals between the injection adaptor ring 20 and template receptacle 400. The injection mandrel 50 of this embodiment is identical to above embodiment and as such may be run with a test plug 340 that seals on its bore. The test plug 340 allows for the pressure testing of the injection mandrel 50 prior to re-injection. When the injection mandrel 50 has been landed within the system a pressure test can be performed on the inner diameter of the injection mandrel 50 to test the integrity of the seals between the outer diameter injection mandrel 50 and the inner diameter of the injection adaptor ring 20.<br>
