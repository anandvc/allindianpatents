				<td>It is well known in the art that a wide range of diseases are caused   by   retroviruses.<br>
As far as is known at the present, AIDS is a disease of the immune  system caused by  the retrovirus  HIV  (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).    According to estimates by the World Health Organization, the disease, which affects about 10 million people, is continuing to spread and in virtually all cases results in the death of the patient.<br>
Retroviruses HIV-1  and HIV-2 have been identified as a cause of the disease and they have been characterized by molecular biology.<br>
Retroviral protease is a proteolytic enzyme that, owing to an aspartate residue in the active center,  is regarded as  an aspartate protease and participates in the maturation of new infectious  virions in infected cells in the reproductive cycle of a number of retroviruses.<br>
For example, HIV-1  and HIV-2 each have in their genome a region that codes for a "gag-protease".    That "gag-protease" is responsible for the correct proteolytic  cleavage of the precursor proteins  that are produced from the genome regions coding for the "Group Specific Antigens" (gag).    During the cleavage, the structural proteins of the virus core are liberated.    The "gag-protease" itself is a component of a precursor protein encoded by the pol-genome "   region of HIV-1  and HIV-2, which protein also contains the regions for the  "reverse transcriptase"  and the  "integrase"  and is  thought to be  cleaved  by  autoproteolysis.<br><br>
The "gag-protease" cleaves the major core protein p24 of HIV-1  and HIV-2 preferentially N-terminally of proline residues,  for example in the divalent residues Phe-Pro, Leu-Pro, or Tyr-Pro.    It is a protease having a catalytically active aspartate residue in the active  center,  a so-called  aspartate protease.<br>
As used herein, proteinase inhibitor refers  to  those  compounds which inhibit aspartate proteases of viral origin and which are useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of viral infections caused by retroviruses,  such as HIV,  in mammals,  both  human and non-human. Details of the design of such proteinase inhibitors can be found, for example, in Roberts, N.A., et al., Science. 248. 358 (20 April 1990); Overton, H.A., et al., Virology. 179. 508 (1990); Tucker, T.J., et al., L Med. Chem.. 35. 2525 (1992); and Phylip, L.H., et al., FEBS  Letters. 314. 449 (1992).<br>
Because of the hydrophobic  and/or lipophilic character of proteinase   inhibitors,   pharmaceutical   formulations   thereof  with conventional  solid or liquid pharmaceutical excipients  tend to  have disadvantages.  For example  the proteinase  inhibitor may not be satisfactorily absorbed.     Among the inherent factors known to affect absorption are the method of manufacture  or method of compounding; the particle size and crystal form or polymorph of the drug  substance;  and the diluents and excipients used in formulating the  dosage form,  including carriers,  fillers,  binders,  disintegrating agents,  lubricants,  coatings,  solvents,  suspending  agents,  and  dyes.<br>
A  requirement for  therapeutic  effectiveness   in vivo   is the achievement of good bioavailability,  for example  good  absorptive capacity and/or a high blood level, also in the case of enteral, such as oral, administration, in order to obtain sufficiently high concentrations in the infected  cells and/or good distribution within a host in need of treatment.<br>
An additional requirement is that the unit dosage form have good stability or shelf life so that it can be stored conveniently (e.g., no refrigeration, i.e., at room temperature (-20 °C) for a long period of time (e.g., about two years).<br><br>
While there are many known proposals to alleviate or overcome problems of this type, it has been found that many of these proposals are inadequate in the area of the proteinase inhibitors.     It has, however, surprisingly been found that certain classes of glycerides used as carrier components of formulation do assist in alleviating these inadequacies.     In particular,  they enable achievement  of better  absorption  and  thus  enhanced  bioavailability and have good stability or shelf life over a long period of time.<br>
The  present invention accordingly  provides  a pharmaceutical composition, preferably in unit dose, comprising (a) a therapeutically effective  amount of a proteinase inhibitor,  its pharmaceutically acceptable  salts or esters  (including  their salts); and (b) a carrier containing a monoglyceride of C8-C10  medium chain fatty acids.    The amount of the monoglyceride in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier of component (b) is at least sufficient to dissolve  the proteinase inhibitor.<br>
Preferably, the ratio of monoglyceride of component (b)  to component (a) is at least about 1.5, more preferably at least about 2.0, further preferably at least from about 2.5 to about 3.5, and most preferably at least about 3.    Preferably, component (b) has an acid value of less than or equal to about 0.5, more preferably less than or equal to about 0.26, and further preferably less than or equal to about 0.1  and even more preferably less than or equal to about 0.04.<br>
The medium chain fatty acids can also be partially ethoxylated with polyethylene glycol of molecular weight of from about 300 to about 500, which is equivalent to about six to about eight moles of ethylene   oxide.<br>
Mixtures of the monoglyceride of C8-C10 medium chain fatty acids  and the partially  ethoxylated medium chain fatty  acids  can also  be  contemplated.<br>
The  pharmaceutically  acceptable  carrier  can  further  contain polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br><br>
The  present  invention  accordingly  provides   a  pharmaceutical composition, preferably in unit dose, comprising (a) a therapeutically effective  amount of a proteinase  inhibitor,  its pharmaceutically  acceptable  salts  or esters  (including  their  salts); and (b) a carrier containing a monoglyceride of C8-C10  medium chain fatty acids.    The amount of the monoglyceride in the pharmaceutically acceptable  carrier of component (b)  is present in an amount sufficient to dissolve or solubilize the proteinase inhibitor.    Preferably the ratio of monoglyceride (b) to (a) is at least about 1.5. A skilled artisan would be able to determine the amount of monoglyceride that is needed to dissolve the proteinase inhibitor in  accordance  with  the  present invention  through  conventional techniques.<br>

The Examples below  describe work conducted using N-tert.-butyl-decahydro-2-[2(R)-hydroxy-4-phenyl-3(S)-[[N-(2-quinolylcarbonyl)-L-asparaginyl]amino]butyl]-(4aS,8aS)-isoquinoline-3(S)-carboxamide   (referred   to   hereinbelow   as "Compound A") and its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts as an example of a proteinase inhibitor.    Those of ordinary skill in the art also will appreciate how the invention and examples relate to those proteinase   inhibitors   described   hereinabove   and  other  proteinase inhibitors  in  general.<br>
Example  1<br>
The various formulations  tested below and the others which are  contemplated by the present invention were made in  the following manner.    As an example, Formulation A-63, discussed below, was made as follows:<br>
Compound A was sieved to remove large material.<br>
769.0 mg of CAPMUL MCM and 1.0 mg of dl-cc-tocopherol, all as liquids, were placed in a suitable vessel and were heated to 55-60°C with continuous stirring.     30.0 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP K30; average molecular weight of about 30,000) was added to the vessel and stirred until dissolved.    200.0 mg of the sieved Compound A was added slowly to the liquid by careful sprinkling it into  the  liquid while vigorously stirring and maintaining the temperature of the liquid at 55-60°C.<br>
When all of the Compound A had dissolved, the vessel was removed from the heat source,  the  stirring was  stopped,  and the resulting liquid was  allowed to reach room temperature (about 20 °C).    The cooled liquid was then filled into soft gel capsules.<br><br>
For compositions containing from about 120 mg to about 300 mg of proteinase inhibitor, and preferably about 200 mg, the compositions can contain the materials in the following ranges (based on weight percent of the composition):<br><br><br>
Preferably, for compositions containing about 200 mg of proteinase inhibitor, the compositions contain about 40-80% C8-C10 fatty acid monoglycerides,  about 0.5% dl-a-tocopherol,   about  0-28% PEG-400, about 0-10% Polyoxyl(40) Castor Oil; and about 0-30% polyvinylpyrrolidone.     Additionally,  preferred  compositions  are,   with all containing about 200 mg of proteinase inhibitor, (a) about 0.5% dl-a-tocopherol and about 79.5% C8-Ci0 fatty acid monoglycerides; and (b) about 0.5% dl-a-tocopherol;  about 40-76.5% C8-C10 fatty acid monoglyercides, about 0-27.5% polyoxyl(40) castor oil; and about 20-30%  polyvinylpyrrolidone.     More  preferred  compositions (mg/capsule)  are  as follows:<br><br><br><br>
A heating temperature of at least 55°C was selected to prevent lengthy dissolution time of Compound A in the glyceride.<br>
Example 2<br>
Inventive formulations A-59 and A-63  are set forth in Table  1 below.    Formulation A-63 was prepared as described in Example  1 above.    Formulation A-59 was prepared in a manner analogous to that described in Example 1.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
A human volunteer study  was  carried out using inventive formulation   A-63   as  compared   against  noninventive  formulation Formulation  A-14  (Compound A-mesylate  salt,  235.337  mg [equivalent to 200.000 mg of Compound A] in a carrier of anhydrous lactose, 63.300 mg; microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH  102), 60.000 mg;  sodium starch glycolate,  16.000 mg; Povidone (polyvinylpyrrolidone)  K30,   8.000  mg;   and  magnesium  stearate, 4.000 mg; (purified water used for processing,  92.590 mg) placed in a hard  gelatin capsule)  to  assess bioavailability.<br>
Twelve male volunteers were used in each  study, each given the equivalent of 600 mg Compound A after food:    that is three capsules each of the 200 mg hard gelatin capsule Formulation A-14 and three capsules each of the 200 mg soft gelatin capsules of Formulation A-63.    The 200 mg indicating that each capsule, hard or soft, contain the equivalent of 200 mg of Compound A.<br><br>
After a fourteen day screening period, each  subject received a single dose of either inventive formulation Formulation A-63  or non-inventive  formulation  Formulation  A-14  within  five  minutes   of<br>
"   a standardized meal (either (1) breakfast::    bowl of corn flakes with 100 ml of whole milk; two rashers of bacon; two fried eggs; two slices of toast with butter; 100 ml orange juice; and 150 ml of decaffeinated coffee or tea or (2) lunch:    200 ml of soup; sandwiches made from four pieces of bread; a chocolate biscuit; an orange or<br>
f   apple; and  150 ml decaffeinated coffee or tea).<br>
Blood samples were taken immediately before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours after the dose.    After a minimum six day washout period, each volunteer received a second dose of each relevant formulation after a standardized meal and blood sampling- was done at the times previously mentioned.     After another minimum  six  day washout period, each volunteer received a second dose of each relevant formulation  after a standardized meal and blood sampling  was done at the  times  previously  mentioned.<br>
The plasma samples of Compound A in biological fluid were analyzed by  solid phase  sample preparation  and high  performance liquid  chromatography  with  ultraviolet  detector  at  238  nm (HPLC/UV) as described below.<br>
C8  Advanced Automated Sample Processor (AASP)  cartridges were used to extract Compound A from plasma samples.    The limits of quantification were 0.5 ng/ml with 1.0 ml of plasma with a precision and accuracy of 0.5% and 99.1%, respectively.<br>
Venous blood samples (10 ml) were taken into either glass Becton  Dickinson  Vacutainers  or  polypropylene  Sarstadt  monovettes containing lithium heparin as an anticoagulant, and put on ice.    The samples were centrifuged within 1  hour of collection at 1500 g and the plasma transferred to 5 ml polystyrene screw  top  tubes  and stored frozen at -20°C.    Prior to transfer to the analytical laboratory, plasma  samples  from  HIV  positive  patients  were  inactivated by  heat<br><br>
treatment in a water bath for 2 hours at 56°C (±  1°C) to destroy any HIV present.    The samples were then refrozen at -20°C.    Prior to analysis  at the  analytical laboratory,  the samples  were  subjected  to the   same  heat  treatment.<br>
A 300 fxl aliquot of 0.5 molar monochloroacetic acid was added to each  1 ml aliquot of plasma, standard, or unknown and the samples were vortexed and then centrifuged for 3  minutes in a microfuge (MSE).<br>
Using a AASP prep station (Varian, Walton on Thames, England), C8 bonded phase AASP cassettes (Jones Chromatography, Hengoed, Wales) were primed with 2 x 1 ml of methanol and 2.x 1 ml of 0.001 M ammonium acetate (pH 3) buffer.    The plasma samples were then loaded onto the cassette and washed with 2x1 ml of 0.01 M ammonium acetate and 1 tal of 0.01 M ammonium acetate (pH 3) buffer:methanol (60:40).    The cassettes were transferred to the AASP system and the samples eluted into the HPLC system (Kratos Spectroflow 400 pump, ABI, Warrington, England; AASP mininjector, Varian, Walton on Thames, England; LKB 2141   variable  wavelength  detector,  Pharmacia/LKB,  Milton  Keynes, England).<br>
The AASP cassettes were purged with aliquots of methanol:water:glacial acetic acid (48.8:48.8:2.4) set for  10 cycles pre-injection and  10 cycles post-injection.    The valve reset time was sent to 1 minute with a typical cycle time and run time of 15 minutes.<br>
The eluent was methanol:0.01  M  ammonium  acetate:glacial acetic acid (90:9.75:0.25), at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, which resulted in a back pressure of approximately 800 psi.    A Phenyl Nova-Pak Guard-Pak (Waters, Harrow, England) was used with a Phenyl Nova-Pak cartridge (4 micron) (Waters, Harrow, England) fitted with in a Waters RCM 8 x 10 compression unit (Waters, Harrow, England). The UV detector was set at 238 nm.    These conditions resulted in a retention time of about  10 minutes for Compound A.    The retention time was dependent upon the analytical column (due  to  the number<br><br>
of residual silanol groups),  the concentration of ammonium acetate in the mobile phase, and the amount of methanol.    The optimum separation of Compound A from endogenous components  was achieved with a retention time of 10 minutes,  accomplished by varying  the  concentration of ammonium  acetate used  to prepare  the mobile phase.    The concentration of ammonium acetate was established for each analytical column and was between about 0.006 and about 0.019 M.<br>
The peak heights of Compound A were calculated automatically  by  computing  integrator  (Maxima  820 chromatography  data acquisition system,  Waters,  Harrow,  England). Peak heights or peak height ratios versus concentrations of Compound A were used to construct linear calibration curves and calculation  of subsequent patient  sample  concentrations  using RODAS suite of programs (Roche Products Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, England).     Calibration curves were established using an iteratively reweighed linear least squares regression.»   The time for maximum concentration   (Cmax), the time to achieve maximum plasma concentration   Tmax, and area under the plasma concentration - time profile (AUC) was determined from plasma concentration - time profile of each formulation.    Statistical analyses, e.g., mean, % coefficient of variability and median were also calculated.<br>
Relevant   pharmacokinetic   parameters   of  inventive   formulation Formulation  A-63   as  compared  to  noninventive  formulation Formulation A-14 are found in Table 2.<br><br><br>
The data of Table 2 show inventive formulation Formulation A-63 shows a Cm ax over five times that of noninventive Formulation  A-14.     Inventive formulation Formulation  A-63  shows  a AUC over 3.5 times that of noninventive formulation Formulation A-14.    The results of this evaluation were surprising.<br>
The  Compound  A-mesylate  salt  (used  in  non-inventive Formulation A-14) has a greater solubility than Compound A base (2.55 vs. 0.03 mg/ml at room temperature in water; 0.06 vs. 0.05 mg/ml at room temperature in pH 1.1 (HC1); and 2.32 vs   
 <br>
Example 4<br>
Other  formulations  contemplated  by  the  present  invention  are as follows:<br><br>
Mix Items 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in a suitable vessel with stirring and warm the mixture to about 50°C.    Add Compound A (item 1) to the mixture while mixing until clear solution is obtained.    Then cool the mixture  to room temperature.     Then  add dl-a-tocopherol  (item 7) and mix until dissolved.    Fill in size 16 oblong soft gelatin capsule.<br>
Example  5<br>
Additional  examples  of other formulations  contemplated  by the present invention are as follows:<br><br><br>
Mix   CAPMUL MCM, and where used, PEG(40) Castor Oil, PEG 400, PEG (8) caprylic/caproic glyceride, and dl-cc-tocopherol in a suitable vessel with stirring and warm the mixture to about 50°C. Add Compound A to the mixture while mixing until clear solution is obtained.    Then cool the mixture to room temperature.    Fill in appropriately sized hard or soft gelatin capsules.    The hard gelatin capsules can be sealed to prevent any leakage of the fill material.<br>
