				<td>6-11 Bicvclic Ketolide Derivatives<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel semisynthetic macrolides having antibacterial activity and useful in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. More particularly, the invention relates to 6-11 bicyclic ketolide derivatives, compositions containing such compounds and methods for using the same, as well as processes for making such compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Macrolide antibiotics play a therapeutically important role, particularly with the emergence of new pathogens. Structural differences are related to the size of the lactone ring and to the number and nature (neutral or basic) of the sugars. Macrolides are classified according to the size of the lactone ring (12,14, 15 or 16 atoms). The macrolide antibiotic family (14-, 15- and 16-membered ring derivatives) shows a wide range of characteristics (antibacterial spectrum, side-effects and bioavailability). Among the commonly used macrolides are erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin. Macrolides possessing a 3-oxo moiety in place of the 3-cladinose sugar are known as ketolides and have shown enhanced activity towards gram-negative bacteria and macrolide resistant gram-positive bacteria. The search for macrolide compounds which are active against MLSe-resistant strains (MLSu = Macrolides-Lincosamides-type B Streptogramines) has become a major goal, together with retaining the overall profile of the macrolides in terms of stability, tolerance and pharmacokinetics.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Antibacterial Activity<br>
Susceptibility tests can be used to quantitatively measure the in vitro activity of an antimicrobial agent against a given bacterial isolate. Compounds were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity by a micro-dilution method. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was determined in 96 well microtiter plates utilizing the appropriate Mueller Hinton Broth medium (CAMHB) for the observed bacterial isolates. Antimicrobial agents were serially diluted (2-fold) in DMSO to produce a concentration range from about 64 p.g/rnl to about 0.03 ^.g/ml. The diluted compounds (2 uJ/well) were then transferred into sterile, uninoculated CAMHB (0.2 mL) by use of a 96 fixed tip-pipetting station. The inoculum for each bacterial strain was standardized to 5 x 105 CFU/mL by optical comparison to a 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard. The plates were inoculated with 10 (il/well of adjusted bacterial inoculum. The 96 well plates were covered and incubated at 35 +/- 2°C for 24 hours in ambient air environment. Following incubation, plate wells were visually examined by Optical Density measurement for the presence of growth (turbidity). The lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent at which no visible growth occurs was defined as the MIC. The compounds of the invention generally demonstrated an MIC in the range from about 64 u,g/ml to about 0.03 ng/ml.<br>

The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient" means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches<br><br>
such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols such as propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminun hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir, preferably by oral administration or administration by injection. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharrnaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. In some cases, the pH of the formulation may be adjusted with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, bases or buffers to enhance.the stability of the formulated compound or its delivery form. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformarnide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br><br>
Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions, may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.<br>
In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the<br><br>
rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or: a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>
Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be. required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.<br><br>
The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons.<br>
Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
According to the methods of treatment of the present invention, bacterial infections are treated or prevented in a patient such as a human or other animals by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result.<br>
By a "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound of the invention is meant a sufficient amount of the compound to treat bacterial infections, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or contemporaneously with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts.<br><br>
The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human or other animal in single or in divided doses can be in amounts, for example, from 0.01 to 50 mg/kg body weight or more usually from 0.1 to 25 mg/kg body weight. Single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. In general, treatment regimens according to the present invention comprise administration to a patient in need of such treatment from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of the compound(s) of this invention per day in single or multiple doses.<br>
The compounds of the formulae described herein can, for example, be administered by injection, intravenously, intraarterially, subdermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously; or orally, buccally, nasally, transmucosally, topically, in an ophthalmic preparation, or by inhalation, with a dosage ranging from about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight, alternatively dosages between 1 mg and 1000 mg/dose, every 4 to 120 hours, or according to the requirements of the particular drug. The methods herein contemplate administration of an effective amount of compound or compound composition to achieve the desired or stated effect. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about 1 to about 6 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Alternatively, such preparations may contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound.<br>
Lower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific dosage and treatment regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of the disease, condition or symptoms, the patient's disposition to the disease, condition or symptoms, and the judgment of the treating physician.<br>
Upon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a<br><br>
function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered orally to fish by blending said pharmaceutical compositions into fish feed or said pharmaceutical compositions may be dissolved in water in which infected fish are placed, a method commonly referred to as a medicated bath. The dosage for the treatment of fish differs depending upon the purpose of administration (prevention or cure of disease) and type of administration, size and extent of infection of the fish to be treated. Generally, a dosage of 5 -1000 mg, preferably 20 -100 mg, per kg of body weight of fish may be administered per day, either at one time or divided into several times. It will be recognized that the above-specified dosage is only a general range which may be reduced or increased depending upon the age, body weight, condition of disease, etc. of the fish.<br>

Schemes 1-4 describe processes for the preparation of intermediates which are useful in the preparation of compounds according to the invention.<br>
Compounds of formula (1-2), which are useful as the starting materials for the preparation of compounds of the present invention, may be synthesized as detailed in Schemes 1 and 2 below. An erymromycin derivative (1-2) is prepared from erythromycin using the procedures described in U.S. Patents.4,990,602; 4,331,803; 4,680,386; 4,670,549; and European Patent Application EP 260,938.<br><br>

(Figure Remove)<br>
The erythromycin derivative of formula (1-2), is then reacted with an alkylating agent of the formula:<br>
Ri3-OC(0)0-CH2[G=CH Ru]CH2-OC(O)-ORi3      (1-3)<br>
where Rn is Ci-C^-alky! and RH is as previously defined.<br>
Most palladium (0) catalysts are expected to work in this process. Some palladium (II) jatalysts, such as palladium (II) acetate, which is converted into a palladium (0) species in-ntu by the actions of a phosphine, will work as well. See, for example, Beller et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1995, 34 (17), 1848. The palladium catalyst can be selected from, but lot limited to, the group consisting of palladium (II) acetate, :etrakis(triphenylphospine)palladium(0), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium, :etradi(benzylideneacetone)dipalladium and the like. Palladium on carbon and palladium (II) lalide catalysts are less preferred than other palladium catalysts for this process.<br>
Suitable phosphines include, but are not limited to, triphenylphosphine, bis(diphenylphosphino)methane, bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane,<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane, bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane, and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine, and the like.<br>

The most preferred solvents are tetrahydrofuran or toluene.<br>
The alkylating agents useful in the processes of the invention are di-carbonates (1-3). Generally, the alkylating agents have the formula (1-3), previously described. The preferred alkylating agents are those wherein Rn is a tert-butyl, isopropyl or isobutyl group. The alkylating reagents are prepared by reaction of a di-ol with a wide variety of compounds for incorporating the di-carbonate moiety. The compounds include, but are not limited to, ten-butyl chloroformate, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, and l-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)imidazole and the reaction is carried out in the presence of an organic or an inorganic base. The temperature of the reaction varies from about -30 °C to about 30 °C. Preferably, the alkylating reagent is di-tert-butyl dicarbonate.<br>
An alternative method of converting the alcohol into the carbonate involves treating the alcohol with phosgene or triphosgene to prepare the chloroformate derivative of the di-ol. The di-chloroformate derivative is then converted into the di-carbonate by the methods described in Cotarca, L., Delogu, P., Nardelli, A., Sunijic, V, Synthesis, 1996, 553. The reaction can be carried out in a variety of organic solvents such as dichloromethane, toluene, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate and chloroform in the presence of a base. Examples of suitable bases include, but are not limited to, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, dimethylaminopyridine, pyridine, triethylamine and the like. The temperature conditions can vary from 0 °C to about 60 °C. The reaction typically takes about 3 to 5 hours to run to completion.<br>

Compounds of formula (1-4), where Rg is an acetyl group, can be converted into the corresponding imine as outlined in Scheme 2. Selective deprotection of the oxime is typically accomplished via alkaline hydrolysis in protic solvents. Representative alkali compounds include lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and the like. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, isopropanol, ethanol, butanol and mixtures there of. The reaction temperature is preferably 0° to 35°C and reaction time is preferably 0.5 to 8 hours.<br>
In a like fashion, simultaneous deprotection of both the oxime and the 2' hydroxyl can be accomplished under a variety of conditions. Conditions for deprotection include, but not limited to, treating with an alcoholic solvent from room temperature to reflux, or treatment with a primary amine, such as butylamine. Alcoholic solvents preferred for the deprotection are methanol and ethanol. A more thorough discussion of the procedures, reagents and conditions for removing protecting groups is described in literature, for example, by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" 3rd ed., John Wiley &amp; Son.Inc, 1999.<br>
Deoxygenation of compounds of formula (2-1) under reducing conditions gives the macrolide imine of formula (2-2). Many reducing agents can be used to effect this transformation including, but not limited to, lithium aluminum hydride, titanium trichloride, borane, and various sulfides such as sodium hydrogen sulfide and sodium nitrite. For a more detailed account of oxime reduction see J. March in "Advanced Organic Chemistry" 4th ed., Wiley &amp; Son, Inc, 1992.<br>
A particularly useful method for the reduction of oximes to the corresponding imine uses a sulfite reducing agent, such as sodium hydrogensulfite, under acidic conditions, typically in protic solvents. Representative acids include, but are not limited to, acetic acid, formic acid, dilute hydrochloric acid, dilute phosphoric acid, dilute sulfuric acid, and the like. Suitable protic solvents include, but are not limited to, mixtures of water and methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or butanol. The reaction is typically carried out at 50° to 110 ° C, preferably for between 1 and 10 hours.<br>
Hydrolysis of the cladinose moiety can be accomplished as previously described in scheme 1 to give compounds of formula (2-3)<br>
Alternatively compounds of formula (2-3) can be formed directly from compounds of formula (2-1) via treatment with TiCla in alcoholic solvents, preferably methanol or ethanol<br>
Imines of formula (2-3) can be acylated under basic conditions using a suitable acylating agent in an aprotic solvent. Typical acylating agents include, but are not limited to, acetyl chloride, acetic anhydride, benzoyl chloride, benzole anhydride, and benzyl chloroformate.<br>

Stepwise formation of the 6-11 bridged macrolides is also possible as outlined in<br>
Scheme 3. In a similar manner as previously described, the procedure involves reacting a compound of formula (1-4) with a suitable alkylating agent. As before, the erythromycin derivative of formula (1-4) is reacted with an alkylating agent of the formula:<br>
R13-OC(O)O-CH2[C=CHRi, ]CH2-O-RP       (3-1) where RB is C|-C|2-alkyl, and RU and Rp are as previously defined.<br>
As discussed previously, most palladium (0) catalysts are expected to work in this process and the reaction is carried out in an aprotic solvent, preferably at elevated temperature, preferably at or above 50 °C. The most preferred solvents are tetrahydrofuran and toluene.<br>
The alkylating agents useful in the process of the invention are the mixed silyl ether carbonates (3-1). Generally, the alkylating agents have the formula (3-1), previously described. The preferred alkylating agents are those wherein RB is tert-butyl, isopropyl or isobutyl and Rp is tert-buty\ dimethyl silyl, triisopropyl silyl, tert-buty] diphenyl silyl or the like.<br>
The alkylating reagents of formula (3-1) are prepared by reaction of a diol sequentially with a wide variety of compounds for incorporating the carbonate moiety, followed by a wide variety of compounds for incorporating the silyl moiety. Alkylating reagents include, but not limited to, ferr-butyl chloroformate, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, and 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)imidazole; where as silylating reagents include, but are not limited to tejt-butyl dimethyl silyl chloride, tert-butyl dimethyl silyl triflate, tert-butyl dimethyl silyl cyanide, and tert-butyl dimethyl silyl imidazole.

Preferably, the alkylating reagent is di-ter/-butyl dicarbonate and the silylating reagent is tent-butyl dimethyl silyl chloride.<br>
The free oxime (3-3) is prepared using essentially the same procedure as for the deprotection of oxime (1-4) where Re is Ac in Scheme 2.<br>
Compounds of formula (3-4) can be formed directly from compounds of formula (3-3) by the application of the previously described procedure for the reduction of oximes of formula (2-1) to the corresponding imine of formula (2-2).<br>
The protecting group (Rp) is then removed from the hydroxyl of the compound of formula (3-4) using the appropriate conditions as outlined in T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" 3rd ed., John Wiley &amp; Son, Inc, 1999. For example, when the protecting group is TBS, tetra-n-butyl ammonium fluoride, hydrofluoric acid or trifluoro acetic acid may be used. Using standard conditions, the primary hydroxyl is converted to the tert-buty\ carbonate, and subsequently the 11-hydroxyl group is alkylated by means of a palladium (0) catalyst as described previously. In this way compounds of formula (3-6) can be prepared readily.<br>
Removal of the cladinose sugar is accomplished as previously described in Scheme 1 to give a compound of formula (1-5).<br>

Scheme 5 illustrates another process of the invention for the preparation of compounds according to the invention. Conversion of alkene (6-1) into ketone (6-2) can be accomplished by exposure of the alkene to ozone followed by decomposition of the ozonide with the appropriate reducing agent, as outlined in Scheme 3. The reaction is typically carried out in an inert solvent such as, but not limited to, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, glacial acetic acid, chloroform, methylene chloride or hexanes or mixtures thereof, preferably methanol, preferably at -78° to -20°C. Representative reducing agents are , for example, triphenylphosphine, trimethyl phosphite,, thiourea, and dimethyl sulfide, preferably triphenylphosphine. A more thorough discussion of ozonolysis and the conditions there for can be found in J. March "Advanced Organic Chemistry" 4th ed., Wiley &amp; Son, Inc, 1992.<br>
An alternative method for the preparation of ketone (6-2) involves dihydroxylation of the alkene followed by diol cleavage. The glycol (6-3) is first prepared by reacting alkene (6-1) with osmium tetroxide. This reaction can be carried out with stochiometric amounts of osmium tetroxide, or, if an oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, or<br>
N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide is present, with catalytic amounts of osmium tetroxide. These reactions can be carried out in a variety of solvents including: 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, tert-butanol and diethyl ether, preferably at 0 °C<br>
The glycol can be cleaved by a variety of reagents including, but not limited to, periodic acid, lead tetraacetate, manganesedioxide, potassium permanganate, sodium metaperiodate, and N-iodosuccinamide. Depending on the cleavage reagent, a variety of solvents can be used. Preferably the cleavage reagent is sodium metaperiodate, the solvent is preferably a mixture of ethanol, methanol, acetone, or 1,4-dioxane and water and the reaction temperature is 0 ° to 25 °C.<br><br><br>

Scheme 6 illustrates the procedure by which compounds of formula (7-1) may be converted to compounds of formula (7-2) by treatment with a halogenating reagent. This reagent acts to replace a hydrogen atom with a halogen atom at the C-2 position of the ketolide.   Various halogenating reagents may be suitable for this procedure.<br>
Fluorinating reagents include, but are not limited to, Af-fluorobenzenesulfonimide in the presence of base, 10% F2 in formic acid, 3,5-dichloro-l-fluoropyridinium tetrafluoroborate, 3,5-dichloro-l-fluoropyridinium triflate, (CF3SO2)2NF, N-fluoro-N-methyl-p-toluenesulfonamide in the presence of base, W-fluoropyridinium triflate, N-fluoroperfluoropiperidine in the presence of base.<br>

A suitable iodinating reagent is N-Iodosuccinimide in the presence of base, or \i, for example<br>
Suitable bases for the halogenating reactions requiring them are compounds such as alkali metal hydrides, such as NaH and KH, or amine bases, such as LDA or triethylamine, for example. Different reagents may require different type of base, but this is well known within the art.<br>
A preferred halogenating reagent is N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide in the presence of sodium hydride.<br>
Suitable solvents are dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, pyrrolidinone and the like.<br>
It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that compounds of formula (7-1) or (7-2) can be substituted for compounds of formula (6-1) or (6-2) in the preceding examples if the corresponding C-2 halogenated product is desired.<br><br>

For ease of illustration, in Scheme 7 only the 6-1 1 bridged moiety of each particular compound according to formula I will be shown, it being understood that it is intended to illustrate a compound according to formula I with the specified bridged moiety.   Compounds according to the invention of the formulas (6-1) and (tf-2) can be further functionalized in a variety of ways. Scheme 7 details a procedure for the conversion of the ketone (6-2) into an oxime of formula (7-7). Oxime formation can be accomplished, using the appropriate substituted hydroxylamine, under either acidic or basic conditions in a variety of solvents. Representative acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric, phosphoric, sulfuric, p-toluenesulfonic, and pyridinium p-toluene sulfonate. Likewise, bases that are useful are, for example, triethylamine, pyridine, diisopropylethyl amine, 1,5-lutidine, and the like. Appropriate solvents include, but are not limited to, methanol, ethanol, water, tetrahydrofuran, 1 ,2-dimethoxyethane, and ethyl acetate. Preferably the reaction is carried out in ethanol using triethylamine as the base. Reaction temperature is generally 25° C and reaction time is 1 to 12 hours.<br>
Ketone (6-2) can also be further utilized by conversion into the amine (7-9) via a reductive amination protocol. Thus, the ketone is treated with an amine in the presence of a reducing agent to obtain the product amine (7-9). The reaction can be carried out either with or without added acid. Examples of acids that are commonly used include, hydrochloric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, and the like. Reducing agents that effect reductive amination include, but are not limited to, hydrogen and a catalyst, zinc and hydrochloric acid, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium borohydride, iron petnatcarbonyl, and alcoholic potassium hydroxide. Generally alcoholic solvents are used. The preferred conditions use sodium cyanoborohydride in methanol with added acetic acid.<br>
A still further way to functionalize ketone (6-2) is via addition of Grignard reagents to form alcohols of formula (7-8). Scheme 8 depicts this protocol. The requisite Grignard reagents are readily available via the reaction of a variety of alkyl or aryl halides with magnesium under standard conditions (see B.S. Furniss, AJ. Hannaford, P.W.G. Smith, A.R. Tatchell "Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry" 5th ed., Longman, 1989). The addition is performed in an inert solvent, generally at low temperature. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to tetrahydrofuran, diethylether, 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and hexanes. Preferably the solvent is tetrahydrofuran or diethylether. Preferably the reaction is run at -78° to 0° C.<br>
In a similar way, reaction with other organometallic reagents gives rise to alcohols of type (7-8). Examples of organometallic reagents that may be used include, but are not limited to, organo-aluminum, organo-lithium, organo-cerium, organo-zinc, organo-thallium, and organo-boron reagents. A more thorough discussion of organometallic reagents can be found in B.S. Furniss, A.J. Hannaford, P.W.G. Smith, A.R. Tatchell "Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry" 5th ed., Longman, 1989.<br>
Furthermore, alcohols of type (7-14) can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding ketone (6-2) under a variety of conditions, (see Hudlicky, M. Reductions in Organic Chemistry, Ellis Horwood Limited: Chichester, 1984). The alcohols thus derived can be further modified to give compounds of type (7-15). Processes to generate compounds of formula (7-15) include, but are not limited to: alkylation of the alcohol with an electrophile or conversion of the alcohol into a leaving group such as a triflate, tosylate, phosponate, halide, or the like followed by displacement with a heteroatom nucleophile (e.g. an amine, alkoxide, sulfide or the like).<br>
It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, that the unsaturated compounds represented by compounds (6-1) and (6-2) can be reduced to form the corresponding<br>
saturated compound ( see Hudlicky, M. Reductions in Organic Chemistry, Ellis Horwood Limited: Chichester, 1984).<br>
The glycol (7-5) can be prepared by reacting alkene (6-1) with osmium tetroxide. This reaction can be carried out either with stochiometric amounts of osmium tetroxide, or, if a oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, or N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide are present, with catalytic amounts of osmium tetroxide. These reactions can be run in a variety of solvents including: 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, tert-butanol and diethyl ether, preferably at 0 °C. The glycols thus derived can be further modified to give compounds of type (7-12) by, for instance, selective alkylation of the primary alcohol with an electrophile (see B.S. Furniss, AJ. Hannaford, P.W.G. Smith, A.R. Tatchell "Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry" 5lh ed., Longman, 1989).<br>
Epoxides of type (7-10) can be prepared by the conversion of the primary alcohol into a leaving group such as a triflate, tosylate, phosponate, halide, or the like, followed by intramolecular nucleophillic displacement (see Tetrahedron Lett.^ 1983, 661-664). Epoxides of formula (7-10) can be further funtionalized via ring opening with a variety of nucleophiles. Representative nucleophiles include, but are not limited to, amines, alkoxides, sulfides, organometallic reagents and the like. Reactions can be carried out in the presence or absence of Lewis acid activators such as silver carbonate, silver triflate, boron trifluoride etherate, aluminum trichloride and the like, (see (a) J. Med Chem., 1997, 2762-2769, (b) J. Amer. Chem. Soc.,1999, 10251-10263, (c) Tetrahedron Lett., 2000,4229-4234)<br><br>

Compounds of the invention according to formula (6-1) are also capable of further functionalization to generate compounds of the present invention, Alkene (6-1) can be treated with an aryl halide or aryl triflate in the presence of a palladium catalyst [Pd(0) or Pd(II)] to provide compound (9-3): (See (a) Heck, Palladium Reagents in Organic Synthesis, Academic Press: New York, 1985, Chapter 1; (b) Sonogashira, Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, Volume 3, Chapters 2,4; (c) Sonogashira, Synthesis 1971, 111.}. Under the Heck coupling conditions, regioisomers and stereoisomers of the double bond are possible. Alternatively, compound (6-1) can undergo a cross metathesis reaction with vinylaromatic derivatives using ruthenium catalysts to give compounds of formula (9-2) (see (a) J. Org. Chem. 2000, 65, 2204-2207; (b) Reviews: Synlett. 1999,2, 267; (c) Reviews: Ivin, K. J.; Mol, J. C. Olefin Metathesis and Metathesis Polymerization, 2nd ed.; Academic Press: New York, 1997; (d) J.

It will be appreciated that ketones of formula (6-2) can be transformed into alkenes of formula (9-2) and (8-1) via Wittig reaction with the appropriate phosphonium salt in the presence of a base, (see (a) Burke, Tetrahedron Lett., 1987,4143-4146, (b) Rathke and Nowak, /. Org. Chem., 1985,2624-2626, (c) Maryanoff and Reitz, Chem. Rev., 1989, 863-927. Furthermore, vinyl halides of formula (8-1) can be functionalized by Sonogashira coupling with alkynes in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a copper halide and an amine base to give compounds of formula £8-2) (see (a) Sonogashira, Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, Volume 3, Chapters 2,4; (b) Sonogashira, Synthesis 1977,777.). In a similar manner, alkenes of formula (9-2) can be obtained from vinyl halides (8-1) via Suzuki cross coupling with organoboron reagents in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a base, or via Stille cross coupling with organostananes in the presence of a palladium catalyst. (see (a) Suzuki, J. Organomet. Chem. 1999, 576,147-168, (b) Stille, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl, 1986, 508-524 (c) Farina, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1991,9585-9595).<br><br>
It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, that the unsaturated compounds represented by compounds (9-2) and (8-2) can be reduced to form the corresponding saturated compound (see Hudlicky, M. Reductions in Organic Chemistry, Ellis Horwood Limited: Chichester, 1984).<br>
