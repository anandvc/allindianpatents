THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
 "A PYRAZOLE COMPOUND"<br>
PFIZER INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, of 235 East 42nd Street, New York, New York 10017, United States of America,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed:	<br>
29 MAY 2006	<br><br>
The present invention relates to a pyrazole compound.<br>
This invention lates to pyrazole derivatives and to process for the preparation thereof, intermediates used in their preparation of, compositions containing them and the uses of such derivatives.<br>
The compounds of the present invention bind to the enzyme reverse transcriptase and are modulators, especially inhibitors thereof. Reverse transcriptase is implicated in the infectious lifecycle of HIV, and compounds which interfere with the function of this enzyme have shown utility in the treatment of conditions including AIDS. There is a constant need to provide new and better modulators, especially inhibitors, of HIV reverse transcriptase since the virus is able to mulate, becoming resistant to the effects of known modulators.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of a variety of disorders including those in which the inhibition of reverse transcriptase is implicated. Disorders of interest include those caused by Human Immunod ificieny disorders of interest include those caused by Human Immunodificiency Virus (HIV) and genetically related retroviruses, such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).<br>
European patent application EP 0 786 455 Al discloses a class of imidazole compound which inhibit the growth of HIV. A class of N-phenylpyrazoles which act as reverse transcriptase inhibitors are disclosed in J. Med. Chem., 2000, 43, 1034. Antiviral activity is ascribed to a class of N-(hydroxyethyl)pyrazole derivatives in US patent number 3,303,200.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a compound of the formula<br><br><br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or derivative thereof, wherein:<br>
either R1 is H, C1-C6 alkyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyl, phenyl, benzyl, halo, -CN, -OR7,<br><br><br><br>
R8 is a five or six-membered, aromatic heterocyclic group containing (i) from 1 to 4 nitrogen heteroatom(s) or (ii) 1 or 2 nitrogen heteroatom(s) and 1 oxygen or 1 sulphur heteroatom or (iii)  1  or 2 oxygen or sulphur heteroatom(s), said       heterocyclic group being optionally substituted by halo, oxo, -CN, -COR5,<br>

R8 is a four to seven-membered, saturated or partially unsaturated heterocyclic group containing (i) 1 or 2 nitrogen heteroatom(s) or (ii) 1 nitrogen heteroatom and 1 oxygen or f sulphur heteroatom or (iii) 1 oxygen or sulphur heteroatom, said heterocyclic group being optionally substituted by oxo, C1-C6 alkyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyl, -SO2R5, -CONR5R5, -COOR5, -CO-(C1-C6 alkyiene)-OR5 or -COR5 and optionally substituted on a carbon atom which is not adjacent to a heteroatom by halo, -OR5, -NR5R5, -NR5COR5, -NR5COOR5, -NR5CONR5R5, -NR5SO2R5 or -CN;<br>
R10 is H, R8,  R9, R13, C1-C6 alkyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyl or -(C1-C6 alkyl)-(C3-C7 cycloalkyl), said C1-C6 alkyl and C3-C7 cycloalkyl being optionally substituted by -OR5, -OR13, R8, R9, R13 or COR13;<br>
R11 is H, C1-C6 alkyl or C3-C7 cycloalkyl, said C1-C6 alkyl and C3-C7 cycloalkyl being optionally substituted by -OR5, -NR5R5, -NR5COR5, -CONR5R5, R8 or R9;<br>
R12 is CrC6 alkyl substituted by R8, R9, -OR5, -CONR5R5, -NR5COR5 or -NR5R5;   <br>
R13 is phenyl optionally substituted by halo, -CN, -COR5, -CONR5R5, -S02NR5R5, -NRsSO2R5, -OR5, -NR5R5, -(C1-C6 alkylene)-NR5R5, C1-C6 alkyl, halo(C1-C6)alkyl or C3-C7 cycloalkyl; and<br>
      x is 0, 1 or 2;<br>
with the proviso that (a) when R1 and R3 are both phenyl, R2 is not methyl; and (b) when R1 is ethoxy and R3 is ethoxycarbonyl, R2 is not phenyl.<br>
      In the above definitions, halo means fluoro, chioro, bromo or iodo. Unless otherwise stated, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkylene and alkoxy groups containing the requisite number of carbon atoms can be unbranched or branched chain. Examples of alkyl include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, sec-butyl and t-butyl. Examples of alkenyl include ethenyl, propen-1-yl, propen-2-yl,<br><br>

Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. Where R1 and R2 are taken together, they form, along with the nitrogen atom and the carbon atom of the      pyrazole ring to which they are attached, a 5- or 6-membered ring. Where a heterocyclic group R8 or R9 is attached to an oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen heteroatom the heterocyclic group R8 or R9 must be linked through a ring carbon atom. Further, where a heterocyclic group R9 is attached to an oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen heteroatom the heterocyclic group R9 must be linked through a ring carbon atom that is not adjacent to a ring heteratom.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formula (I) include the acid addition and the base salts thereof.<br>
        Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts and examples are the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate, nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, maleate, fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, gluconate, succinate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulphonate,        ethanesulphonate,        benzenesulphonate,        para-<br>

compound of the formula (XV) or (XVI) is treated with POCI3, optionally in the presence of a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide, to give a compound of the formula (I) in which R1 or R3, respectively, is chloro.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, in many cases, compounds of the formula (I) may be converted into other compounds of the formula (I) by functional group transformations. For instance:<br>
(a)	compounds of the formula (I) in which R2 is H may be converted into<br>
compounds of the formula (I) in which R2 is optionally substituted C1-C6 alkyl by<br>
reaction with an appropriate alkylating agent. In a typical procedure, a solution of<br>
a compound of the formula (I) in which R2 is H in a suitable solvent such as<br>
ethanol or N,N-dimethylformamide is treated with an alkyl bromide and a base<br>
such as sodium ethoxide or sodium hydride and heated at a temperature of from<br>
     room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent. A preferred combination is N,N-dimethylformamide as the solvent, sodium hydride as the base and room temperature as the temperature. Examples of specific alkylating agents include bromoacetonitrile, ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate, methyl bromoacetate and chloroethylamine hydrochloride. The use of further specific<br>
         alkylating agents is illustrated by the Examples below;<br>
(b)	compounds of the formula (I) in which R1, R2 or R3 contains an ester<br>
functionality may be reduced with a suitable reducing agent, such as lithium<br>
aluminium hydride, to give corresponding compounds of the formula (I) in which<br>
         R1, R2 or R3 contains a hydroxy group. In a typical procedure, a solution of the compound of the formula (I), in which R1, R2 or R3 contains an ester group, in a suitable solvent, such as diethyl ether, is treated with lithium aluminium hydride, preferably with cooling to a temperature of from -78°C to 0°C;<br>
(c)	compounds of the formula (I) in which R1, R2 or R3 are substituted by a<br>
heterocycle of the formula R6 may be prepared by standard heterocycle-forming<br>
reactions well known to the skilled man (see, for example, Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry, 3rd Edition, by Gerry March or Comprehensive Heterocyclic<br>
Chemistry, A.R. Katritzky, C.W. Rees, E.F.V. Scriven, Volumes 1-11). For<br>
    instance, compounds of the formula (I) in which R2 is (2-amino-6-hydroxypyrimidin-4-yl)methyl may be prepared by the sequential reaction of a compound of the formula (I) in which R2 is H with chloroacetoacetate and then guanidine hydrochloride. This and other similar heterocyle-forming reactions are illustrated by the Examples below; and<br><br>
(d)	compounds of the formula (I) in which R1 or R3 is -CO2R5, wherein R5 is<br>
other than H, may be converted into compounds of the formula (I) in which R1 or<br>
R , respectively, is -CO2H by hydrolysis. Typically the reaction will be carried out<br>
in a suitable solvent, such as aqueous ethanol, or aqueous 1,4-dioxan and in the<br>
presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide. Such an acid may be converted<br>
to a primary amide by reaction with ammonia and a suitable coupling agent, such<br>
as a carbodirmide, e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Such a primary amide may<br>
then be converted into a nitrite by dehydration with a suitable dehydrating agent,<br>
        such as phosphoryl chloride.<br>
(e)	compounds of the formula (I) in which R1 or R3 is C1-C6 alkyl may be<br>
converted into the compounds of the formula (I) in which R1 or R3, respectively, is<br>
C1-C6 alkyl substituted by halo (such as bromo), by halogenation, using a suitable<br>
halogenating agent. Conveniently the reaction is effected in the presence of a<br>
solvent, such as a haloalkane (e.g. dichloromethane) and at ambient<br>
temperature. Suitable halogenating agents include halogens (e.g. bromine) or N-<br>
halosuccinimides (e.g. N-bromsuccinimide).<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) containing an -OH, -NH- or -NH2 group may be<br>
        prepared by the deprotection of the corresponding compound bearing an -OP1, -NP1- or -NHP1 group, respectively, wherein the group P1 is a suitable protecting group. Examples of suitable protecting groups will be apparent to the skilled person [see, for instance, 'Protecting groups in Organic Synthesis (Second Edition)' by Theodora W. Green and Peter G. M. Wuts, 1991, John Wiley and<br>
     Sons]. Such compounds bearing an -OP1, -NP1- or -NHP1 group may be prepared using the routes described above, mutatis mutandis.<br>
Compounds of the formula (IV), (V) and (XXI) are either commercially available or easily prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can be administered alone but will generally be administered in admixture with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient, diluent or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
For example, the compounds of the formula (I) can be administered orally, buccally or sublingually in the form of tablets, capsules, multi-particulates, gels, films, ovules, elixirs, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavouring or colouring agents, for immediate-, delayed-, modified-, sustained-, pulsed- or<br><br><br><br>
controlled-release applications. The compounds of the formula (I) may also be administered as fast-dispersing or fast-dissolving dosage forms or in the form of a high energy dispersion or as coated particles. Suitable formulations of the compounds of the formula (I) may be in coated or uncoated form, as desired.<br>
10<br>
Such solid pharmaceutical compositions, for example, tablets, may contain<br>
excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium<br>
carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate, glycine and starch (preferably corn, potato<br>
or tapioca starch), disintegrants such as sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose<br>
sodium and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone,	hydroxypropylmethylcellulose	(HPMC),<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included.<br>

General Example<br>
A formulation of the tablet could typically contain from 0.01 mg to 500mg of active compound whilst tablet fill weights may range from 50mg to 1000mg. An example of a formulation for a 10mg tablet is illustrated below:<br>
Ingredient	%w/w<br>
Compound of the formula (I) or salt	10.000*<br>
Lactose	64.125<br>
Starch	21.375<br>
        Croscarmellose sodium	3.000<br>
Magnesium Stearate	1.500<br>
* Quantity adjusted in accordance with drug activity.<br>
     The tablets are manufactured by a standard process, for example, direct compression or a wet or dry granulation process. The tablet cores may be coated with appropriate overcoats.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin or HPMC capsules. Preferred excipients in this regard include lactose, starch, a cellulose, milk sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the compounds of the formula (I) may be combined<br><br><br>
with various sweetening or flavouring agents, colouring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can also be administered parenterally, for example, intravenously, intra-arterially, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intraventricularly, intraurethrally, intrasternally, intracranially, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, or they may be administered by infusion or needleless injection techniques. For such parenteral admiriistration fney are "best used In the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary. The preparation of suitable parenteral formulations under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the compounds of the formula (I) will usually be from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg, preferably from 0.01 to 5 mg/kg (in single or divided doses).<br><br>
Thus tablets or capsules of the compound of the formula (I) may contain from 1 to 500 mg of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time, as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for any individual patient and it will vary with the age,<br>
        weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention. The skilled person will appreciate that, in the treatment of certain conditions the compounds of the formula (I) may be taken as a single dose as<br>
         needed or desired.<br>
The compounds of formula (0 can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation and are conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder inhaler or an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurised container, pump, spray,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134A [trade mark]) or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227EA [trade mark]), carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurised aerosol, the dosage unit may be<br><br><br>
determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser or nebuliser may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound, e.g. using a mixture of ethanol and the propellant as the solvent, which may additionally contain a lubricant, e.g. sorbitan trioleate. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of a compound of the formula (I) and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the formula (I) can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a gel, hydrogel, lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. The compounds of the formula (I) may also be dermally or transdermally administered, for example, by the use of a skin patch. They may also be administered by the pulmonary or rectal routes.<br>
They may also be administered by the ocular route. For ophthalmic use, the compounds can be formulated as micronised suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, optionally in combination with a preservative such as a benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, they may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
