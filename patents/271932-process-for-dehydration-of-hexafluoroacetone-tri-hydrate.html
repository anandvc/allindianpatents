				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for dehydrating a<br>
hexafluoroacetone hydrate by hydrogen fluoride, and furthermore relates to<br>
a process for producing a hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride adduct.<br>
BACKGROUND TECHNIQUE<br>
Hexafluoroacetone is produced in a large amount as an industrial<br>
raw material of 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane (bisphenol-AF),<br>
which is important as a crosslinking agent of fluororubber,<br>
hexafluoroisopropanol, which is important as a medicine intermediate, and<br>
the like. Industrially, hexafluoroacetone is produced by a process by an<br>
epoxidation of hexafluoropropene and a subsequent isomerization, a process<br>
by subjecting hexachloroacetone obtained by chlorinating acetone to a<br>
substitution fluorination with hydrogen fluoride by a chromium-supported<br>
activated carbon catalyst or the like, etc. Hexafluoroacetone is a gas<br>
having a boiling point of -28°C under atmospheric pressure. Therefore, in<br>
order to meet the convenience of handling, hexafluoroacetone trihydrate,<br>
which is obtained as a constant boiling composition of 106°C, is used as a<br>
raw material in many reactions or served for storage. There are, however,<br>
some cases in which existence of water is not permissible depending on the<br>
reaction conditions, the target product and other requirements.<br>
Furthermore, hydrates are generally lower in reactivity in many cases, as<br>
compared with anhydrides. Therefore, anhydride of hexafluoroacetone is<br>
requested in some cases, and upon use it is frequently conducted to convert<br>
the hydrate to the anhydride in place.<br>
As a process for dehydrating a hexafluoroacetone hydrate, there<br>
have been reported processes by the contact with Molecular Sieve (a<br>
registered trade mark) (Patent Publication 1), concentrated sulfuric acid,<br>
sulfuric anhydride, phosphorus pentoxide (Patent Publication 2), etc. By<br>
using concentrated sulfuric acid, sulfuric anhydride, phosphorus pentoxide,<br>
fuming sulfuric acid or the like as the dehydrator, hexafluoroacetone<br>
decomposition products may be produced. Furthermore, there occurs a<br>
waste in a large amount of sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid containing water<br>
and organic matters produced by the decomposition. Furthermore, there is<br>
also a problem that recovery percentage of hexafluoroacetone is not<br>
necessarily high when the dehydration is conducted by these processes<br>
including the case of using a synthetic zeolite.<br>
On the other hand, hydrogen fluoride may be used as a catalyst or<br>
solvent in reactions using hexafluoroacetone as a raw material. For<br>
example, bisphenol-AF is obtained by a dehydration reaction from a mixture<br>
of hexafluoroacetone, phenol and hydrogen fluoride (Non-patent Publication<br>
1).<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TASK TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
There is provided a process of obtaining a mixture of a<br>
hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride adduct and hydrogen fluoride by<br>
dehydrating a hexafluoroacetone hydrate, the process generating<br>
substantially no waste.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING TASK<br>
As a result of a study about a process for industrially producing a<br>
hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride adduct, which shows a reaction<br><br>
behavior similar to that of hexafluoroacetone in specific reactions, the<br>
present inventors have found that a hydrogen fluoride solution of a<br>
hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride adduct can quantitatively be produced<br>
with good yield and substantially no generation of waste through<br>
dehydration of a hexafluoroacetone hydrate by a simple process comprising<br>
mixing a hexafluoroacetone hydrate with hydrogen fluoride and then<br>
conducting distillation, thereby completing the present invention.<br>
That is, the present invention is a process for producing a<br>
hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride adduct, comprising separately<br>
obtaining a component containing a hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride<br>
adduct and hydrogen fluoride and a component containing water and<br>
hydrogen fluoride by bringing a hexafluoroacetone hydrate into contact with<br>
hydrogen fluoride and conducting distillation as it is.<br>
Aspects 1-5 of the present invention are shown in the following.<br>
Aspect 1 of the present invention is a process for dehydrating a<br>
hexafluoroacetone hydrate, comprising introducing a hexafluoroacetone<br>
hydrate and hydrogen fluoride either as a mixture or separately into a<br>
distillation column, obtaining a composition containing hexafluoroacetone or<br>
a hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride adduct and hydrogen fluoride as a<br>
low boiling component, and obtaining a composition containing water and<br>
hydrogen fluoride as a high boiling component.<br>
Aspect 2 of the present invention is a dehydration process according<br>
to Aspect 1, wherein the hexafluoroacetone hydrate and the hydrogen<br>
fluoride are continuously introduced either as a mixture or separately into<br>
the distillation column.<br>
Aspect 3 of the present invention is a process for dehydrating a<br>
hexafluoroacetone hydrate, comprising continuously introducing a<br>
hexafluoroacetone hydrate and hydrogen fluoride either as a mixture or<br><br>
separately into a distillation column, continuously obtaining a composition<br>
containing hexafluoroacetone or a hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride<br>
adduct and hydrogen fluoride as a low boiling component from a column top<br>
portion, and continuously obtaining a composition containing water and<br>
hydrogen fluoride as a high hoiling component from a column bottom<br>
portion.<br>
[4] A dehydration process according to any of claims 1-3, wherein the<br>
hexafluoroacetone hydrate is hexafluoroacetone trihydrate.<br>
Aspect 4 of the present invention is a dehydration process according<br>
to any of Aspects 1-3, wherein the hexafluoroacetone hydrate is<br>
hexafluoroacetone trihydrate.<br>
Aspect 5 of the present invention is a dehydration process according<br>
to any of Aspects 1-4, wherein the hexafluoroacetone hydrate is a<br>
hexafluoroacetone hydrate containing water.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the dehydration process of the present invention, since<br>
hexafluoroacetone or a hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride adduct to be<br>
obtained is in a mixture with hydrogen fluoride, it can be used as it is for a<br>
reaction in which hexafluoroacetone is used with hydrogen fluoride as a raw<br>
material, catalyst or solvent. Therefore, it is effective for simplification of<br>
the steps. Furthermore, it is a superior process on the side of<br>
environmental protection too, since it does not require a treatment of waste<br>
such as waste sulfuric acid containing organic materials, which is inevitable<br>
in processes conducted hitherto using concentrated sulfuric acid, fuming<br>
sulfuric acid, and the like.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In the following, the present invention is explained in detail.<br><br>
In the description, hydrogen fluoride may be represented by HF.<br>
In the description, hexafluoroacetone may be represented by HFA.<br>
In the description, a hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride adduct may be<br>
represented by HFAHF.<br>
In the description, a hexafluroacetone hydrate refers to a hydrate or its<br>
aqueous solution with unlimited hydration number and is a concept<br>
containing hexafluoroacetone trihydrate.<br>
In the description, hexafluoroacetone trihydrate may be represented by<br>
HFA.3W.<br>
The present invention is a process for producing a<br>
hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride adduct, comprising separately<br>
obtaining a component containing a hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride<br>
adduct and hydrogen fluoride and a component containing water and<br>
hydrogen fluoride by bringing a hexafluoroacetone hydrate into contact with<br>
hydrogen fluoride and conducting distillation as it is. Here, "as it is" refers<br>
to without conducting a treatment by a chemical substance that is used<br>
generally as a dehydrator, such as concentrated sulfuric acid, sulfuric<br>
anhydride, phosphorus pentoxide, and the like, or by an adsorbent such as<br>
molecular sieves and the like. However, not "as it is", that is, it is natural<br>
to be able to conduct a dehydration by these dehydrators before or after<br>
applying the dehydration process of the present invention.<br>
As HFA3W, which may be dealt with as an alternative reaction<br>
reagent to hexafluoroacetone, is represented by<br>
[Chemical Formula 1]<br><br>
it is a gem-diol dihydrate resulting from a reaction between<br>
hexafluoroacetone and water and is a liquid having a boiling point of 106°C.<br>
Even if HFA.3W is distilled, it is not possible to release water to obtain<br>
hexafluoroacetone.<br>
Furthermore, hexafluoroacetone monohydrate is a compound<br>
different from hexafluoroacetone and is represented as gem-diol. An<br>
equilibrium of the following formula between hexafluoroacetone and water<br>
is established, and the equilibrium shifts extremely rightward.<br>
[Chemical Formula 2]<br><br>
Hexafluoroacetone monohydrate is a solid having a melting point of<br>
52°C, which is high in sublimation property and strong in hygroscopic<br>
property. Although it decomposes at 46°C, it is not possible to obtain<br>
hexafluoroacetone by distillation, similar to HFA3W.<br>
On the other hand, a hexafluoroacetone-hydrogen fluoride adduct is<br>
a 1:1 adduct of hexafluoroacetone and hydrogen fluoride, represented by<br>
heptafluoroisopropanol of the following formula. Heptafluoroisopropanol<br>
alone is a thermally unstable compound, and it is considered that there is a<br>
partial decomposition into hexafluoroacetone and hydrogen fluoride at a<br>
temperature not lower than boiling point (14-16°C) and that an equilibrium<br>
of the following formula is established. The equilibrium depends on<br>
temperature, and heptafluoroisopropanol is decomposed by 35% at 20°C and<br>
by 70% at 100°C.<br>
[Chemical Formula 3]<br><br>
There is a report (US No. 3745093 Patent Publication) that HFAHF<br>
can be separated by distillation under non-equilibrium condition, but it is<br>
not possible to separate hexafluoroacetone and hydrogen fluoride even if<br>
distillation is conducted by a normal method (French Patent No. 1372549).<br>
In the course of completing the present invention, it has been<br>
confirmed by NMR measurement in hydrogen fluoride by the inventors and<br>
the like that HFAHF is heptafluoroisopropanol, and, if an excessive amount<br>
of hydrogen fluoride is coexistent, it exists stably as it is<br>
heptafluoroisopropanol with no decomposition even if it is left at room<br>
temperature or higher.<br>
It is possible to conduct dehydration of a hexafluoroacetone hydrate<br>
of the present invention by any type of batch type, half batch type or<br>
continuous type by using a common distillation apparatus equipped with a<br>
distillation pot, a distillation column, a condenser and other devices As the<br>
material of the apparatus, it is possible to use stainless steel, nickel alloy<br>
steel, silver, fluororesin, carbon and polyethylene, or metal materials lined<br>
or cladded with these materials. For the distillation pot, the distillation<br>
column and the packing material, with which a hydrogen fluoride aqueous<br>
solution of a relatively high temperature is brought in contact, it is<br>
preferable to use silver, resin materials, such as fluororesin and the like,<br>
resistant to a hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution, or metal materials lined<br>
or cladded with these materials. As the distillation column, it is possible to<br>
use any of packing-type formed of a publicly known packing material, a tray<br>
column, etc.<br>
The process of the present invention can be conducted under reduced<br>
pressure or pressurized condition, specifically even under a condition of a<br>
pressure of about 0.05-2MPa. In the following, the case of conducting it<br>
under atmospheric pressure is explained. Conducting it under other<br>
pressure conditions also belongs to the scope of the present invention. It is<br>
easy for a person skilled in the art to optimize the conditions, based on the<br>
following explanation and technical common sense in this technical field.<br>
The batch type dehydration process is explained.<br>
HFA3W and hydrogen fluoride are introduced into the distillation<br>
pot (column bottom) of the distillation column. Relative to 1 mol of<br>
HFA3W, hydrogen fluoride is necessary by 1 mol or greater, preferably<br>
2-100 mols, more preferably 3-50 mols, still more preferably 5-30. If<br>
hydrogen fluoride is too little, the effect of dehydration is insufficient, and<br>
operation of the distillation does not become stable. If it is too much, there<br>
is no problem in the effect of dehydration. With this, consumption of utility<br>
becomes large, and it is accompanied by enlargement of the apparatus.<br>
Each of them is not preferable. Here, it suffices that HFA.3W is a<br>
hexafluoroacetone hydrate. It may be one having a hydration number less<br>
than 3, such as hexafluoroacetone monohydrate. Furthermore, it may be<br>
an aqueous solution of a hexafluoroacetone hydrate. As a raw material<br>
used for the dehydration, it is preferably HFA.3W or one having a hydration<br>
number less than that. As the hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous hydrogen<br>
fluoride, which is available for industrial use, is suitable. In principle,<br>
however, the water content is not essential. It is possible to use even one<br>
containing about 50 mass % of water.<br>
By increasing the column bottom temperature to exceed boiling point<br>
of hydrogen fluoride, vapor is liquefied at the column top by the condenser to<br>
start reflux. After a certain period of time, it gets closer to 16°C, which is<br>
boiling point of HFA.HF. By gradually taking the reflux liquid out, the<br>
temperature gets closer to boiling point (19.5°C) of hydrogen fluoride.<br>
While making an adjustment to maintain the reflux condition, the reflux<br>
liquid is taken out. In case that the amount of reflux decreases, the column<br>
bottom temperature is gradually increased. At the initial stage of the<br>
distillation, a component containing a lot of HFA.HF is taken out of the<br><br>
column top at 16-20°C. Then, the temperature of the reflux liquid<br>
increases gradually. The HFA HF content decreases, and a component<br>
containing a lot of hydrogen fluoride is taken out. It is necessary to<br>
maintain the temperature of the reflux liquid in a range not to greatly<br>
exceed boiling point of hydrogen fluoride. Otherwise, dehydration of<br>
hydrogen fluoride becomes incomplete, and water is contained in the column<br>
top liquid. Although the admissible water content depends on use of the<br>
dehydrated HFA, it is 1 mass % or lower, normally 0.01 mass % or lower.<br>
Furthermore, the distillation is continued. It can be continued until the<br>
column bottom temperature, depending on the composition of hydrogen<br>
fluoride and water, increases to 112°C, the azeotropic temperature of<br>
hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution. Upon this, the column bottom liquid<br>
forms a maximum boiling point azeotrope of 38 mass % hydrogen fluoride<br>
and 62 mass % water. The column bottom liquid contains substantially no<br>
hexafluoroacetone. The admissible residual HFA depends on the use of the<br>
hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution, but is 1 mass % or lower, normally 0.01<br>
mass % or lower. As to the column bottom temperature, it can be<br>
conducted until the maximum azeotropic temperature of the hydrogen<br>
fluoride aqueous solution. It is also can be conducted at a temperature<br>
lower than the maximum azeotropic temperature as long as it is not lower<br>
than boiling point (19.5°C) of hydrogen fluoride. In that case, it results in<br>
obtaining a hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution having a concentration<br>
determined by boiling point, but the concentration may be determined by<br>
the use of the hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution. In this way, a<br>
component formed of hexafluoroacetone or HFA.HF and hydrogen fluoride<br>
and a component (hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution) formed of hydrogen<br>
fluoride and water are separately obtained.<br>
Next, the case of conducting the process of the present invention by a<br>
continuous process is explained.<br><br>
In the above-mentioned batch type dehydration process, it is<br>
preferable to conduct a shift to the continuous process from a condition in<br>
which the distillation column is maintained in a stable reflux condition. In<br>
the continuous process, it is operationally easy to use a hexafluoroacetone<br>
hydrate that the compositional ratio of hexafluoroacetone to water is<br>
constant, for example, HFA3W. Therefore, the case of using HFA3W is<br>
explained in the following. In general, it is preferable not to vary the<br>
composition ratio of hexafluoroacetone to water, but it is not necessary to be<br>
a specific composition ratio (in this case, the molar ratio of water/HFA is 3).<br>
HFA3W and hydrogen fluoride are continuously introduced into the<br>
distillation column. HFAHF and hydrogen fluoride are continuously taken<br>
out of the column top, and the hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution out of the<br>
column bottom. It is also possible to intermittently conduct the continuous<br>
operation of introducing hexafluoroacetone hydrate and hydrogen fluoride,<br>
taking HFAHF and hydrogen fluoride out of the column top, and taking the<br>
hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution out of the column bottom.<br>
It is possible to not only introduce a hexafluoroacetone hydrate and<br>
hydrogen fluoride into the distillation column through separate pipes, but<br>
also introduce them after their previous mixing. It is preferable to have the<br>
same positions for the introduction into the distillation column. It is<br>
possible to set the position (height) for the introduction into the distillation<br>
column at an arbitrary position from the column bottom to the column top.<br>
It is, however, preferable to introduce them at the position (height)<br>
corresponding to the boiling point of a mixed liquid resulting from the<br>
theoretical amounts of water and hydrogen fluoride, which are generated by<br>
a dehydration reaction of preferably HFA 3W and hydrogen fluoride.<br>
The reason why dehydration can effectively be conducted in the<br>
process of the present invention is assumed that, in the case of mixing<br>
hexafluoroacetone trihydrate with one equivalent or more of hydrogen<br>
fluoride, a reaction or equilibrium shown in the following formula is<br><br>
established in a short period of time, and in the distillation an equilibrium<br>
condition formed of three components of HFAHF, hydrogen fluoride and an<br>
azeotropic composition of water and hydrogen fluoride is established.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In the following, the present invention is explained in detail by<br>
examples, but the present invention is not limited to these examples.<br>
[EXAMPLE 1] Batch type production process<br>
As to material of the dehydration apparatus, a fluororesin or<br>
polyethylene was used for all of the parts with which hexafluoroacetone,<br>
hexafluoroacetone trihydrate and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride are brought<br>
into contact. As the distillation pot, a polytetrafluoroethylene container of<br>
10cm diameter x 15 cm height was used. As the distillation column, there<br>
was used a PFA column of 3cm diameter x 45cm height packed by a length<br>
of 35cm with polyethylene Raschig rings (4mm diameter x 4mm length) as a<br>
packing material. As the condenser, there was used a PFA cylindrical<br>
container of 10cm diameter x 15cm height equipped in the inside with a<br>
coiled tube to make a refrigerant to flow. As a receiver for an effluent from<br>
the column top, a 500ml PFA container was used.<br>
After putting 220g of HFA3W into the distillation pot, it was cooled<br>
with a dry ice/acetone bath to solidify it. Then, 240g of anhydrous<br>
hydrogen fluoride was weighed and put thereinto. Under a cooled<br>
condition (-20°C), it was set on the distillation column. It was allowed to<br>
stand still as it was until room temperature. Then, heating was started<br>
with a water bath and then an oil bath. During this, a conspicuous<br>
generation of heat in the distillation pot by the mixing was not observed.<br>
As the heating was continued, reflux was observed at an upper part<br>
of the distillation column. Then, temperature of the reflux portion started<br>
to become lower than boiling point (19.5°C) of hydrogen fluoride, and reflux<br>
of HFAHF was confirmed. Upon this, it was started to take the reflux<br>
liquid out, while securing reflux to maintain temperature of the column top<br>
at around 19.5°C, boiling point of hydrogen fluoride. The reflux liquid<br>
(HFAnHF) taken out was received in the receiver cooled with ice, and the<br>
volume was recorded over time. At the time when a suitable amount was<br>
collected, the container was changed, followed by measuring the volume and<br>
the mass, putting into a storage container made of polyethylene, and storing<br>
with sealing in a refrigerator.<br>
Since the column bottom temperature increases with lowering of the<br>
hydrogen fluoride concentration at the column bottom portion by the<br>
progress of the distillation, the oil bath temperature was adjusted to always<br>
have a temperature difference of 20°C or greater between the column top<br>
and the column bottom. Temperature of the column bottom showed on<br>
occasions temperature of the gas phase portion of the distillation pot due to<br>
decrease of the amount of the interior content (It was the same in the<br>
following.). Temperatures of the column bottom portion and the distillation<br>
column increased gradually, but temperature of the column top was almost<br>
constantly maintained at 20°C to maintain a suitable reflux. At the time<br>
when the column bottom temperature showed 60°C, the distillation was<br>
stopped.<br>
After the distillation, the reflux liquid (column top effluent)<br>
recovered from the column top was 252g (the molar ratio n of HFAnHF: 4.3,<br>
yield of hexafluoroacetone: 99%), and the column bottom liquid was a<br>
hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution (71 mass %) of 188g. Existence of water<br>
was not confirmed by measuring water content of the reflux liquid by Karl<br>
Fischer's method. Hexafluoroacetone was not detected in the column<br>
bottom liquid.<br>
[EXAMPLE 2] Batch type production process<br>
(a) The distillation pot was charged with 181g of the hydrogen fluoride<br>
aqueous solution (71 mass %) recovered from the column bottom after<br>
termination of the distillation of Example 1, 220g of HFA3W and 344g of<br>
anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. A distillation similar to that of Example 1<br>
was started. While the reflux liquid of the column top was taken out, the<br>
distillation was continued until the column bottom temperature showed<br>
51°C. With this, the column top effluent was 249g (the molar ratio n of<br>
HFAnHF: 4.15, yield of hexafluoroacetone: 99%), and the column bottom<br>
liquid was a hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution (76 mass %) of 489g.<br>
Existence of water was not confirmed by measuring water content of the<br>
column top effluent by Karl Fischer's method. Hexafluoroacetone was not<br>
detected in the column bottom liquid.<br>
(b) After termination of the distillation of (a), the distillation pot was<br>
charged with 412g of the hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution (76 mass %)<br>
recovered from the column bottom, and a distillation similar to that of<br>
Example 1 was started. While the reflux liquid of the column top was<br>
taken out, the distillation was continued until the column bottom<br>
temperature showed 85°C. With this, the column top effluent was<br>
hydrogen fluoride of 197g, and the column bottom liquid was a hydrogen<br>
fluoride aqueous solution (62 mass %) of 275g. Existence of water was not<br>
confirmed by measuring water content of the column top effluent by Karl<br>
Fischer's method. Hexafluoroacetone was not detected in the column<br>
bottom liquid.<br>
(c) After termination of the distillation of (b), the distillation pot was<br>
charged with 267g of the hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution (62 mass %)<br><br>
recovered from the column bottom, and a distillation similar to that of<br>
Example 1 was started. While the reflux liquid of the column top was<br>
taken out, the distillation was continued until the column bottom<br>
temperature showed 116°C. With this, the column top effluent was<br>
hydrogen fluoride of 54g, and the column bottom liquid was a hydrogen<br>
fluoride aqueous solution (48 mass %) of 206g. Existence of water was not<br>
confirmed by measuring water content of the column top effluent by Karl<br>
Fischer's method. Hexafluoroacetone was not detected in the column<br>
bottom liquid.<br>
[EXAMPLE 3] Batch type production process<br>
A distillation was conducted by using the same apparatus as that of<br>
Example 1. After putting 220g of HFA 3W into the distillation pot, it was<br>
cooled with a dry ice/acetone bath. Then, 122g of anhydrous hydrogen<br>
fluoride was weighed and put thereinto. Under a cooled condition (-20°C),<br>
it was set on the distillation column. Then, similar to Example 1, the<br>
distillation was continued until the column bottom temperature showed<br>
121°C and stopped.<br>
After the distillation, the reflux liquid (column top effluent)<br>
recovered from the column top was 229g (the molar ratio n of HFAnHF: 3.5,<br>
yield of hexafluoroacetone: 99%), and the column bottom liquid was a<br>
hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution (46 mass %) of 104g. Existence of water<br>
was not confirmed by measuring water content of the reflux liquid by Karl<br>
Fischer's method. Hexafluoroacetone was not detected in the column<br>
bottom liquid.<br>
[EXAMPLE 4] Batch type production process<br>
A distillation was conducted by using the same apparatus as that of<br>
Example 1. After putting 220g of HFA.3W into the distillation pot, it was<br>
cooled with a dry ice/acetone bath. Then, 271g of anhydrous hydrogen<br><br>
fluoride was weighed and put thereinto. Under a cooled condition (-20°C),<br>
it was set on the distillation column. Then, the distillation was continued<br>
until the column bottom temperature showed 128°C and stopped.<br>
After the distillation, the reflux liquid (column top effluent)<br>
recovered from the column top was 389g (the molar ratio n of HFAnHF: 11,<br>
yield of hexafluoroacetone: 99%), and the column bottom liquid was a<br>
hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution (38 mass %) of 96g. Existence of water<br>
was not confirmed by measuring water content of the reflux liquid by Karl<br>
Fischer's method. Hexafluoroacetone was not detected in the column<br>
bottom liquid.<br>
[EXAMPLE 5] Continuous production process<br>
A metering pump (EH-B10SH-100PR9 made by IWAKI CO., LTD.)<br>
as a device for supplying HFA.3W, and a device prepared by combining a<br>
needle valve with a cylinder equipped with an inner pipe and a branch pipe,<br>
which were made of stainless steel, as a device for supplying hydrogen<br>
fluoride were added to the apparatus shown in Example 1, thereby using it<br>
as the dehydration apparatus. Flow rate was adjusted by the reading of a<br>
weighing scale.<br>
Firstly, a distillation pot was charged with 303g of a 60 mass %<br>
hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution prepared by mixing hydrogen fluoride<br>
with water, and the distillation was started. At the time when reflux of<br>
hydrogen fluoride was confirmed, 638g of a mixed liquid (the molar ratio of<br>
hydrogen fluoride to HFA.3W: 13) of HFA.3W and hydrogen fluoride was<br>
continuously supplied for 5 hours to the position of 1/4 of the distillation<br>
column height from the column top, and an effluent from the column top was<br>
collected in a receiver. During the supply of the mixed liquid, while<br>
maintaining the column bottom temperature at about 107°C, the column top<br>
temperature was maintained in 16.5°C to 20.5°C by adjusting the amount of<br>
effluent.<br><br>
The column top effluent of 567g recovered from the column top at the<br>
time of termination of the dehydration treatment had a molar ratio of<br>
hexafluoroacetone/hydrogen fluoride of 10. Existence of water was not<br>
confirmed by measuring water content of this effluent from the column top<br>
by Karl Fischer's method. The column bottom liquid at the time of<br>
termination of the distillation was a hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution (48<br>
mass %) of 370g. Hexafluoroacetone was not detected in the column bottom<br>
liquid. The total recovery percentage (material balance) was not lower<br>
than 99.9%, the recovery percentage of hexafluoroacetone was 99.6%, and<br>
the recovery percentage of hydrogen fluoride was 100%.<br>
[EXAMPLE 6] Batch type production process<br>
A distillation was conducted by using the same apparatus as that of<br>
Example 1. After putting 220g of HFA-3W into the distillation pot, it was<br>
cooled with ice. Then, 271g of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride was weighed<br>
and added to HFA-3W in the distillation pot. Temperature of the mixture<br>
increased to about 30°C by mixing. Then, similar to Example 1, the<br>
distillation was continued until the column bottom temperature became<br>
127°C and stopped.<br>
After the distillation, the reflux liquid (column top effluent)<br>
recovered from the column top was 390g (the number n of HFAnHF-11),<br>
and the column bottom liquid was a hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution (38<br>
mass %) of 95g. Existence of water was not detected by measuring water<br>
content of the reflux liquid by Karl Fischer's method. HFA was not<br>
detected in the column bottom liquid.<br>
[EXAMPLE 7] Batch type production process<br>
A distillation was conducted by using the same apparatus as that of<br>
Example 1. At room temperature (about 25°C) the distillation pot was<br>
charged with 358g of 70 mass % hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution and<br>
430g of HFA-3W. Then, the reflux liquid was taken out while controlling it<br><br>
so that the column top temperature became 15-16°C. Similar to Example 1,<br>
the distillation was continued until the column bottom temperature became<br>
107°C and stopped.<br>
After the distillation, the reflux liquid (column top effluent)<br>
recovered from the column top was 339g (the number n of HFAnHF: 1), and<br>
the column bottom liquid was a hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution (50<br>
mass %) of 449g.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>

that it generates almost no waste since hydrogen fluoride is used as a<br>
dehydration agent. In addition, since anhydride to be obtained is a<br>
hydrogen fluoride adduct of hexafluoroacetone, there is a characteristic that<br>
it is particularly effective in the case of using hydrogen fluoride as a solvent<br>
or the like in reactions.<br>
