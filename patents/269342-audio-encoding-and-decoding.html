				<td>Audio encoding and decoding<br>
The invention relates to audio encoding and/or decoding for multi-channel signals.<br>
A nnitti-cliannel audio signal is an audio signal having two or more audio channels. Well-known examples of multi-channel audio signals are two-channel stereo audio signals and 5.1 channel audio signals having two front audio channels, two rear audio channels, one center audio signal and an additional low frequency enhancement (LFE) channel. Such 5.1 channel audio signals are used in DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) and SACD (Super Audio Contact Disc) systems. Because of the increasing popularity of muhi-channel material, efBcient coding of multi-channel material is becoming more important.<br>
In the field of audio processing, it is well known to convert a number of audio channels into another ntimber of audio channels. Such a conversion may be performed for various reasons. For example, an audio signal may be converted into another format to provide an enhanced user experience. E.g. traditional stereo recordings only comprise two channels whereas modem advanced audio systems typically use five or six channels, as in the popular 5,1 surround sovmd systems. Accordingly, the two stereo channels may be converted into five or six channels in order to take full advantage of the advanced audio system.<br>
Another reason for a channel conversion is coding efficiency. It has been found that e.g. surround sound audio signals can be encoded as stereo channel audio signals combined with a parameter bit stream describing the multi-channel spatial properties of the audio signal The decoder can reproduce the surround sound audio signals with a very satisfactory degree of accuracy'. Is this way, substantial bit rate savings may be obtained.<br>
A 5.1-2-5.1 multi-channel audio coding system is known. In this known audio coding system a 5.1 input audio signal is encoded into and represented by two down-mix channels and associated parameters. The down-mix signals are also jointly referred to as spatial down-mix. In the known system, the spatial down-mix forms a stereo audio signal having a stereo image that is, as to quality comparable to a fixed ITU down-mix from the 5.1 input channels. Users "having only stereo equipment can listen to this spatial stereo down-<br><br>
mix, whilst listeners with 5.1 channel equipment can listen to the 5.1 channel reproduction that is made using this spatial stereo down-mix and the associated parameters. The 5,1 channel equipment decodes/reconstructs the 5.1 channel audio signal from the spatial stereo down-mix (ie. the stereo audio signal) and the associated parameters.<br>
However, a spatial stereo down-mix is often considered to be of reduced quality compared to an original stereo signal or an explicitly generated stereo signal: For example, professional studio engineers often tend to find ftie spatial stereo down-mix somewhat dull and uninteresting. For this reason, an artistic stereo down-mix, which differs from the spatial stereo down-mix is often generated. For instance extra reverberation or sources are added, die stereo image is widened, etc. In order for users to be able to enjoy the artistic stereo down-mix, this artistic down-mix, instead of the spatial down-mix, may be transmitted via a transmission medium or stored on a storage medium. However, as the paransetric data for generating the 5.1 signal ftom the stereo signal is based on the original down-mix signal, this approach seriously affects the quality of the 5,1 channel audio signal reproduction. SpecificaDy, the input 5.1 channel audio signal was encoded into a spatial stereo down-mix and associated parameters. By replacing the spatial stereo down-mix by the artistic stereo down-mix, the spatial stereo down-mix may no longer be available at the decoding end of the system and a high quality reconstruction of tiie 5.1 channel audio signal is not possible.<br>
A possible approach to improve the quality of the 5.1 channel audio signal is<br>
to include further data of the spatial stereo down-mix signal. For example, in addition to the<br>
artistic stereo down-mix, the spatial stereo down-mix signal can be included in the same<br>
bitstream or can be transmitted in parallel. However, this substantially increases	the data rate-<br>
and thus the communication bandwidth or storage requirements and will degrade the quality to data rate ratio for an encoded multi-channel signal.<br>
Hence, an improved encoding/decoding system for multi-channel audio would be advantageous and in particular a system allowing an improved performance, quality and/or quality to data rate ratio would be advantageous.<br>
Accordingly, the Invention seeks to preferably mitigate, alleviate or eliminate one or more of the above mentioned disadvantages singly or in any combination.<br>

Specifically, an artistic down-mix may be transmitted instead of a spatial down-mix while allowing an efficient multi-channel recreation at a decoder based on enhancement data associated with the spatial down-mix. The dynamic selection of enhancement data allows a significantly reduced size of the enhancement data and/or an improved quality of the signal that can be generated.<br>

The following description focuses on embodiments of the invention applicable to a 5.1-to-2 encoder and/or a 2-to-5.1 decoder. However, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to this application.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of a multi-channel audio encoder 10 according to some embodiments of the invention. This multi-channel audio encoder 10 is arranged for encoding N audio signals 101 into M audio signals 102 and associated parametric data 104,105. In this, M and N are integers, with N &gt; M and M &gt; 1. An example of the multi-channel audio encoder 10 is a 5.1-to-2 encoder in which N is equal<br><br>
to 6, i.e. 5+1 channels, and M is equal to 2. Such a multi-channel audio encoder encodes a 5.1 channel input audio signal into a 2 channel output audio signal, e.g. a stereo output audio signal, and associated parameters. Other examples of the multi-channel audio encoder 10 are 5.1-to-l, 6.1-to-2, 6,1-to-l, 7.1-to-2 and 7.1-to-l encoders. Also encoders having other values for N and M are possible as long as N is larger than M and as long as M is larger than or equal to 1.<br>
The encoder 10 comprises a first encoding unit 110 and coupled thereto a second encoding unit 120. The first encoding unit 110 receives the N input audio signals 101 and encodes the N audio signals 101 into the M audio signals 102 and first associated parametric data 104. The M audio signals 102 and the first associated parametric data 104 represent the N audio signals 101. The encoding of the N audio signals 101 into the M audio signals 102 as performed by the first unit 110 may also be referred to as down-mixing and the M audio signals 102 may also be referred to as spatial down-mix 102. The unit 110 may be a conventional parametric multi-channel audio encoder that encodes a multi-channel audio signal 101 into a mono or stereo down-mix audio signal 102 and associated parameters 104. The associated parameters 104 enable a decoder to reconstruct the multi-channel audio signal 101 fi-om the mono or stereo down-mix audio signal 102. It is noted hat the down-mix 102 may also have more than two channels.<br>
The first unit 110 suppHes the spatial down-mix 102 to the second unit 120. The second unit 120 generates, fi'om the spatial down-mix 102, second enhancement data in the form of second associated parametric data 105. The second associated parametric data 105 represents the spatial down-mix 102, i.e. these parameters 105 comprise characteristics or properties of the spatial down-mix 102 which enable a decoder to reconstruct at least part of the spatial down-mix 102, e.g. by synthesizing a signal resembling the spatial down-mix<br>
102.	The associated parametric data comprise the first and second associated parametric data<br>
104 and 105.<br>
The second associated parametric data 105 comprises modification parameters enabling a reconstruction of the spatial down-mbc 102 fi-om K (=M) further audio signals<br>
103.	In this way, a decoder may perform an even better reconstruction of the spatial down-<br>
mix 102. This reconstruction may be done on basis of an altemative down-mix 103, i.e. the K<br>
further audio signals 103, such as an artistic down-mix. A decoder may apply the<br>
modification parameters to the altemative down-mix signal 103 so that it more closely<br>
resembles the spatial down-mix 102.<br><br>
The second unit 120 may receive at its inputs the alternative down-mix 103. The alternative down-mix 103 may be received from a source external to the encoder 10 (as shown in Fig. 1) or, alternatively, the alternative down-mix 103 may be generated inside the encoder 10 (not shown), e.g. from the N audio signals 101. The second unit 120 may con:5)are at least some of the spatial down-mix 102 with the alternative down-mix 103 and generate modification parameters 105 representing a difference between the spatial down-mix 102 and the alternative down-mix 103, e.g. a difference between a property of the spatial down-mix 102 and a property of the ahemative down-mix 103. In the example, the alternative down-mix 103 is specifically an artistic down-mix associated with the spatial down-mix.<br>
In the example, the second unit 120 may furthermore generate the modification parameters as absolute values which directly represent the spatial down-mix 102 without any reference to the altemative down-mix 103. Furthermore, the second unit 120 comprises functionality for selecting between the relative and the absolute modification parameters for the encoder output signal. Specifically, this selection is dynamically performed and can be done for individual signal blocks depending on the characteristics of the signal and/or the parametric data.<br>
In addition, the second unit 120 can comprise ftmctionality for including an indication of which modification parameters (absolute or relative) have been used for different sections of the encoded signal. For example, for each signal block, a data bit can be included to indicate if relative or absolute parametric data has been included for that signal block.<br>
The modification parameters 105 preferably con^jrise (a difference between) one or more statistical signal properties such as variance, covariance and correlation, or a ratio of these properties, or of the (difference between the) down-mix signal(s). It is noted that the variance of a signal is equivalent to the energy or power of that signal. These statistical signal properties enable a good reconstmction of the spatial down-mix.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of a multi-channel audio decoder 20 according to some embodiments of the invention. The decoder 20 is arranged for decoding K audio signals 103 and associated parametric data 104, 105 into N audio signals 203. In this, K and N are integers, with N &gt; K and K &gt; 1. The K audio signals 103, i.e. the altemative down-mix 103, and the associated parametric data 104, 105 represent the N audio signals 203, i.e. the multi-channel audio signal 203. An example of the multi-channel audio decoder 20 is a 2-to-5.1 decoder in which N is equal to 6, i.e. 5+1 channels, and K is equal to<br><br>
2. Such a multi-channel audio decoder decodes a 2 channel input audio signal, e.g. a stereo input audio signal, and associated parameters into a 5.1 channel output audio signal. Other examples of the multi-channel audio decoder 20 are l-to-5.1, 2-to-6.1, l-to-6.1, 2-to-7.1 and l-to-7.1 decoders. Also decoders having other values for N and K are possible as long as N is larger than K and as long as K is larger than or equal to 1.<br>
The multi-channel audio decoder 20 comprises a first unit 210 and coupled thereto a second unit 220. The first unit 210 receives the alternative down-mix 103 and enhancement data in the form of modification parameters 105 and reconstructs M further audio signals 202, i.e. the spatial down-mix 202 or an approximation thereof, fi'om the alternative down-mix 103 and the modification parameters 105. In this, M is an integer, with M &gt; 1. The modification parameters 105 represent the spatial down-mix 202. The first unit 210 is specifically arranged to determine if modification parameters 105 are absolute or relative modification parameters and to apply the parameters accordingly. Specifically, the first unit 210 can determine if the modification parameters 105 for individual signal blocks are relative or absolute parameters based on explicit data in the received bitstream. For example, a single data bit can be included for each signal block indicating if the parameters are absolute or relative modification parameters in that signal block.<br>
The second unit 220 receives the spatial down-mix 202 from the first unit 210 and modification parameters 104. The second unit 220 decodes the spatial down-mix 202 and modification parameters 104 into the multi-channel audio signal 203. The second unit 220 may be a conventional parametric multi-channel audio decoder that decodes a mono or stereo down-mix audio signal 202 and associated parameters 104 into a multi-channel audio signal 203.<br>
The first unit 210 may be arranged for determining whether it is necessary or desirable to reconstruct the signal 202 fi-om the input signal 103. Such reconstruction may not be applicable when the spatial down-mix signal 202 is supplied to the first unit 210 instead of the alternative down-mix 103. The first unit 210 can determine this by generating from the input signal 103 similar or same signal properties as are comprised in the modification parameters 105 and by comparing these generated signal properties with the modification parameters 105. If this comparison shows that the generated signal properties are equal to or substantially equal to the modification parameters 105 then the input signal 103 sufficiently resembles the spatial down-mix signal 202 and the first imit 210 can forward the input signal 103 to the second unit 220. If the comparison shows that the generated signal properties are not equal to or substantially equal to the modification parameters 105 then the mput signal<br><br>
103 does not sufficiently resemble the spatial down-mix signal 202 and the first unit 210 can reconstruct/approximate the spatial down-mix signal 202 fi'om the input signal 103 and the modification parameters 105.<br>
The iirst unit 210 may generate, fi'om the alternative down-mix, fiirther modification parameters/properties representing the alternative down-mix 103. In such a case, the first unit 210 may reconstruct the spatial down-mix 202 fi'om the alternative down-mix 103 and (a difference between) the modification parameters 105 and the fiirther modification parameters.<br>
The modification parameters 105 and the fiirther modification parameters, respectively, may include statistical properties of the spatial down-mix 202 and the alternative down-mix 103, respectively. These statistical properties such as variance, correlation and covariance, etc. provide good representations of the signals they are derived fi"om. They are useful in reconstructing the spatial down-mix 202, e.g. by transforming the alternative down-mix such that its associated properties match the properties comprised in the modification parameters 105.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of a transmission system 70 according to some embodiments of the invention. The transmission system 70 comprises a transmitter 40 for transmitting an encoded multi-channel audio signal via a transmission chaimel 30, e.g. a wired or wireless communication link, to a receiver 50. The transmitter 40 con5)rises a multi-channel audio encoder 10 as described above for encoding the multichannel audio signal 101 into a spatial down-mix 102 and associated parameters 104, 105. The transmitter 40 further comprises means 41 for transmitting an encoded multi-channel audio signal comprising the parameters 104, 105 and the spatial down-mix 102 or the alternative down-mix 103 via the transmission channel 30 to the receiver 50. The receiver 50 comprises means 51 for receiving the encoded multi-channel audio signal and a multichannel audio decoder 20 as described above for decoding the alternative down-mix 103 or the spatial down-mix 102 and the associated parameters 104, 105 into the multi-channel audio signal 203.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of a multi-channel audio player/recorder 60 according to some embodiments of the invention. The audio player/recorder 60 comprises a multi-channel audio decoder 20 and/or a multi-channel audio encoder 10 according to some embodiments of the invention. The audio player/recorder 60 can have its own storage for example sohd-state memory or hard disk. The audio player/recorder 60 may also facilitate detachable storage means such as (recordable) DVD<br><br>
discs or (recordable) CD discs. Stored encoded multi-channel audio signals comprising an alternative down-mix 103 and parameters 104,105 can be decoded by the decoder 20 and be played or reproduced by the audio player/recorder 60. The encoder 10 may encode multichannel audio signals for storage on the storage means.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a block diagram of a multi-channel audio encoder 10 according to some embodiments the invention. The encoder of Fig. 5 may specifically be the encoder 10 of Fig, 1. The encoder 10 comprises a first unit 110 and coupled thereto a second unit 120. The first unit 110 receives a 5.1 multi-channel audio signal 101 comprising lefl: front, left rear, right front, right rear, center and low frequency enhancement audio signals If, Ir, rf, rr, CO and Ife, respectively. The second unit 120 receives an artistic stereo down-mix 103 conprising left artistic and right artistic audio signals la and ra, respectively. The multichannel audio signal 101 and the artistic down-mix 103 are time-domain audio signals. In the first and second units 110 and 120 these signals 101 and 103 are segmented and transformed to the fi-equency-time domain.<br>
In the first unit 110, parametric data 104 is derived in three stages. In a first stage, three pairs of audio signals If and rf, rf and rr, and co and Ife, respectively, are segmented and the segmented signals are transformed to the frequency domain in segmentation and transformation units 112, 113, and 114, respectively. The resulting fi'equency domain representations of the segmented signals are shown as fi'equency domain signals Lf, Lr, Rf, Rr, Co and LFE, respectively. In a second stage, three pairs of these fi'equency domain signals Lf and Lr, Rf and Rr, and Co and LFE, respectively, are down-mixed in down-mixers 115, 116, and 117, respectively, to generate mono audio signals L, R, and C, respectively and associated parameters 141, 142, and 143, respectively. The down-mixers 115, 116, and 117 may be conventional MPEG4 parametric stereo encoders. Finally, in a third stage the three mono audio signals L, R and C are down-mixed in a down-mixer 118 to obtain a spatial stereo down-mix 102 and associated parameters 144. The spatial down-mix 102 comprises signals Lo and Ro.<br>
The parametric data 141, 142, 143, and 144 are comprised in the first enhancement data in the form of first associated parametric data 104. The parametric data 104 and the spatial down-mix 102 represent the 5.1 input signals 101.<br>
In the second unit, the artistic down-mix signal 103 represented in time domain by audio signals la and ra, respectively, is first segmented in segmentation unit 121. The resulting segmented audio signal 127 comprises signals las and ras, respectively. Next, this segmented audio signal 127 is transformed to the frequency domain by transformer 122.<br><br>
The resulting frequency domain signal 126 comprises signals La and Ra. Finally, the frequency domain signal 126, which is a frequency domain representation of the segmented artistic down-mix 103, and the frequency domain representation of the segmented spatial down-mix 102 are supplied to a generator 123 which generates further (second) enhancement data m the form of modification parameters 105 which enable a decoder to modify/transform the artistic down-mix 103 so that it more closely resembles the spatial down-mix 102.<br>
In the specific example, the segmented time-domain signal 127 is also fed to a selector 124. The other two inputs to this selector 124 are the frequency domain representation of the spatial stereo down-mix 102 and a control signal 128. The control signal 128 determines whether the selector 124 is to output the artistic down-mix 103 or the spatial down-mix 102 as part of the encoded multi-channel audio signal. The spatial down-mix 102 may be selected when the artistic down-mix is not available. The control signal 128 can be manually set or can be automatically generated by sensing the presence of the artistic down-mix 103. The control signal 128 may be included in the parameter bit-stream so that a corresponding decoder 20 can make use of it as described later. Thus, the specific exemplary encoder allows a signal to be generated which includes the spatial down-mix 102 or the artistic down-mix 103.<br>
The output signal 102, 103 of the selector 124 is shown as signals lo and ro. If the artistic stereo down-mix 127 is to be output by the selector 124 the segmented time domain signals las and ras are combined in the selector 124 by overlap-add into signals lo and ro. If the spatial stereo down-mix 102 is to be output as indicated by the control signal 128, the selector 124 transforms the signals Lo and Ro back to the time domain and combines them via overlap-add into the signals lo and ro. The time-domain signals lo and ro form the stereo down-mix of the 5.1-to-2 encoder 10.<br>
A more detailed description of the generator 123 is provided in the following. The function of the generator 123 is to determine second enhancement data and specifically modification parameters that describe a transformation of the artistic down-mix 103 so that it, in some sense, resembles the original spatial down-mix 102.<br>
  (1)<br>
wherein Z^ and R^ are vectors comprising samples of a time/frequency tile of the left and right channel of the artistic down-mix 103, and wherein L^ and R4 are vectors comprising samples of a time/frequency tile of the left and right channel of the modified artistic down-mix, wherein Aj,,..,A^ comprise the samples of a time/frequency tile of optional auxiliary<br><br>
channels, and wherein T is a transformation matrix. Note that any vector V is defined as a column vector. The modified artistic down-mix is the artistic down-mix 103 that is transformed by the transform so that it resembles the original spatial down-mix 102. The auxiliary channels ^£7,..., V^AT are in the described system the spatial down-mix signals or low-frequency content thereof<br>
The (N+2)x2-transformation matrix T describes the transformation from the artistic down-mix 103 and the auxiliary channels to the modified artistic down-mix. The transformation matrix T or elements thereof are preferably comprised in the modification parameters 105 so that a decoder 20 can reconstruct at least part of the transformation matrix T. Thereafter, the decoder 20 can apply the transformation matrix fto the artistic down-mix 103 to reconstruct the spatial down-mix 102 (as described below).<br>
Alternatively, the modification parameters 105 comprise signal properties, e.g. energy or power values and/or correlation values, of the spatial down-mix 102. The decoder 20 can then generate such signal properties from the artistic down-mix 103, The signal properties of the spatial down-mix 102 and the artistic down-mix 103 enable the decoder 20 to construct a transformation matrix T (described below) and to apply it to the artistic down-mix 103 to reconstruct the spatial down-mix 102 (also described below).<br>
Specifically, the generator 123 is arranged to generate both relative and absolute modification data and to select between this data for individual signal blocks (or segments). Thus, the modification parameters 105 for the encoded signal comprises both absolute modification data and relative modification data for different signal blocks. In contrast to the absolute modification data, the relative modification data describes the spatial down-mbc 102 relative to the artistic down-mix 103. Specifically, the relative modification data may be differential data which allows artistic down-mfac samples to be modified to correspond (more closely) to the spatial down-mix samples whereas the absolute down-mix data may directly correspond to the spatial down-mix samples without any reference or reliance on the artistic down-mix samples.<br>
It will be appreciated that there are several ways of modifying the artistic stereo down-mix 103 to resemble the original stereo down-mix 102, including:<br>
I.	Match of waveforms.<br>
II.	Match of statistical properties:<br>
a.	Match of the energy or power of the left and the right channel.<br>
b.	Match of the covariance matrix of the left and right channel.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
the enhancement layer signals to the modified artistic down-mix. In relation to Eq. (1), the only two auxiliary channels used here are the enhancement layer signals Lenh, Eenh-<br>
In the specific exemplary system, the second enhancement layer may contain two different types of data:<br>
The first type of data comprises the parameters contained in matrix T of Eq. (1). These parameters are in the example calculated for the entire signal bandwidth and transform the artistic stereo down-mix such that it in some sense resembles the spatial down-mix. Thus, this type of parameters may provide a modified artistic down-mix which more closely resembles the original spatial down-mix but does not (necessarily) allow a decoder to exactly generate the spatial down mix. For each time/frequency tile only four parameters are required, namely the values of T are required (Tl 1, T12, T21 and T22). These parameters can be coded either absolutely or differentially and the encoder 10 may specifically switch dynamically between the absolute and differential encoding.<br>
The second type of data corresponds to the actual spatial down-mix and is in the specific example a representation of a band-limited version of the spatial down mix. Specifically, this type of data represents a low-fi-equency part of the spatial down-mix (e.g. fi-equencies below, say, 1.7 kHz). This makes it possible to very accurately reconstruct this part of the spatial down-mix at the decoder rather than just generating a signal which has the same, e.g. statistical, properties (as with matrix T). This type of data can be coded absolutely or relatively to the artistic down-mix. Specifically, this type of data can be differentially encoded. For example, the transformation matrix T is applied to the artistic down-mix (see e.g. Eq. (26)) and the difference of that signal and the spatial down-mix can be encoded.<br>
Thus, in some embodiments the second enhancement data is divided into a first and second part of enhancement data wherein the first part describes the spatial down-mix less accurately than the second part. Typically, the corresponding data rate of the first part of the second enhancement data is lower than tiiat of the second part. The enhancement data of the second part of the second enhancement data may relate to only a part of the down-mix and specifically may only relate to a low frequency part.<br>
In some embodiments, the generator 123 may be arranged to select between absolute and relative data for both the first part and the second part of the second enhancement data either individually or together. In other embodiments, the generator 123 may only select between absolute and relative data for one of the parts of data. Specifically, in the following embodiments will be described wherein the first part of the second enhancement data comprises the parameters of T whereas the second the second part<br><br>
comprises a low-frequency representation of the spatial down-mix and the dynamic selection between absolute and relative data is only applied to the second part of the second enhancement data.<br>
The relative data for the second part of the second enhancement data can in these embodiments e.g. be generated as differential values relative to the artistic down-mix after the enhancement data of the first part has been applied (i.e. as differential values relative to the modified artistic down-mix).<br>
In the following, embodiments wherein the generator 123 selects only between relative and absolute data for the second part of the second enhancement data is described in the following.<br>
Absolute enhancement data for part of the first and the second part of the second enhancement data can in this example be derived for the associated time/frequency tiles by setting:<br><br>
where Lg, Es contain the samples of a time/frequency tile of the left and right channel of the spatial stereo down-mix respectively. Thus, in the specific example, the absolute enhancement data simply corresponds to the actual time/frequency tile samples of the spatial down-mix 102 which can replace the corresponding time/frequency tile samples of the artistic down-mix 103.<br>
Furthermore, for the part of the first and the second part of the second enhancement data, relative enhancement data for the associated time/ft'equency tiles can specifically be derived as differential data by setting:<br><br><br><br>
In this way, the generator 123 can generate both absolute enhancement data and relative enhancement data for the artistic down-mix 103 allowing a decoder to generate a modified artistic down-mix which more closely resembles the spatial down-mix 102 used for generating the multi-channel enhancement data.<br>
The generator 123 is furthermore arranged to select between the absolute enhancement data and the relative enhancement data. This selection is in the specific example performed for individual signal blocks (e.g. individual segments) and based on characteristics of the signals within these signal blocks. Specifically, the generator 123 can evaluate characteristics of the absolute enhancement data and the relative enhancement data for a given signal block and can decide which data to include in the enhancement layer for the given signal block. In addition, the generator 123 can include an indication of which data was selected thereby allowing the decoder to apply the received enhancement data correctly.<br>
In some embodiments, the generator 123 can evaluate the encoding to determine whether the absolute enhancement data or the relative enhancement data can be most efficiently encoded (e.g. with the lowest number of bits for a given accuracy). A brute force approach may be to actually encode both types of enhancement data and compare the encoded data size. However, this may be a complex approach in some embodiments, and in the exemplary encoder 10, the generator 123 evaluates the signal energy of the absolute enhancement data relative to the signal energy of the relative enhancement data and selects which type of data to include based on a comparison between the two.<br>
Specifically, for audio coders it is often beneficial, in terms of the bit rate, to encode a signal with as small an energy as possible. Accordingly, the generator 123 selects the type of enhancement data which has the lowest signal energy. In particular, the relative enhancement data is selected when<br><br>
and otherwise the absolute enhancement data is selected.<br>
A problem with switching between different enhancement data is that some noticeable artifacts may result. In the exemplary encoder 10, the generator 123 also comprises fimctionality for gradually switching between different enhancement data. Thus, instead of directly switching from one type of enhancement data in one signal block to<br><br>
mother type in the next signal block, the switch is made gradual from one set of data to the )ther.<br>
Thus, during a time interval (which may have a duration of less or more than )ne signal block), the generator 123 generates the enhancement data as a combination of the ibsolute enhancement data and the relative enhancement data. The combination may for example be achieved by an interpolation between the different types of data or may use an overlap and add technique.<br>
As a specific example, instead of abruptly switching between the different<br><br>
ivhere ak denotes the value of a in the k-th frame and 5 is the adaptation speed. A value of 5 = 0.33 can provide reliably artefect free encoding in many scenarios. The signals Lenh and B^nh given in Eq. (29) can be obtained using parameter interpolation or an overlap and add technique and are encoded and added to the bit-stream. In addition, the decision regarding lifferential or absolute enhancement data is included in the bit-stream, thereby making it possible for a decoder to derive the same value for a as is used in the encoder.<br>
It will be appreciated that although the description focuses on using lifferential and absolute modes with (intra-channel) coding of each of these M-channels individually, other embodiments may use a different encoding approach. For example, for Vf=2, a next step may be to apply e.g. M/S coding (Mid/Side coding, hence coding the sum and the difference signal) when performing (inter-channel) coding of the stereo signal. In many embodiments this may be advantageous both in the differential and the absolute mode 3f (intra-channel) coding of the individual channels.<br>
The elements of the transformation matrix T' may be real-valued or complex-v^alued. These elements may be encoded into modification parameters as follows: those slements of the transformation matrix Tthat are real and positive can be quantized logarithmically, like the IID parameters used in MPEG4 Parametric Stereo. It is possible to set an upper limit for the values of the parameters to avoid over-amplification of small<br><br>
signals. This upper limit can be either fixed or a function of the correlation between the automatically generated left channel and the artistic left channel and the correlation between the automatically generated right channel and the artistic right channel. Of the elements of T* that are complex, the magnitude can be quantized using IID parameters, and the phase can be quantized linearly. The elements of T' are real and possibly negative can be coded by taking the logarithm of the absolute value of an element, whilst ensuring a distinction between the negative and positive values.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates an example of the generator 123 of Fig. 5 in more detail. In the example, the generator 123 comprises a signal block processor 145 which receives the frequency domain spatial and artistic down-mixes 102, 126 and divides the signals into signal blocks. Each signal block can correspond to a time interval of a predetermined duration. In some embodiments, signal blocks may alternatively or additionally be divided in the frequency domain and e.g. transform subchannels may be grouped together in different signal blocks.<br>
The signal block processor 145 is coupled to an absolute enhancement data processor 146 which generates the absolutate enhancement data for the individual signal blocks as previously described. In addition, the signal block processor 145 is coupled to a relative enhancement data processor 147 which generates the relative enhancement data for the individual signal blocks as previously described. The relative and absolute enhancement data is determined based on the signal characteristics within the signal block and specifically, the enhancement data for a given time/frequency tile group can be determined based only on that time/frequency tile group.<br>
The absolute enhancement data processor 146 is coupled to a first signal energy processor 148 which determines the signal energy of the absolute enhancement data in each signal block as previously described. Similarly, the relative enhancement data processor 147 is coupled to a second signal energy processor 149 which determines the signal energy of the relative enhancement data in each signal block as previously described.<br>
The first and second signal energy processors 148, 149 are coupled to a selection processor 150 which for each signal block selects either the absolute or relative enhancement data depending on which type has the lowest signal energy.<br>
The selection processor 150 is fed to an enhancement data processor 151 which is furthermore coupled to the enhancement data processor 146 and the relative enhancement data processor 147. The selection processor 151 receives a control signal indicating which type of enhancement data has been selected and accordingly it generates the<br><br>
enhancement data as the selected enhancement data. Furthermore, the selection processor 151 is arranged to perform a gradual switch including an interpolation between the absolute and relative parameters during a switch time interval.<br>
The selection processor 151 is coupled to an encode processor 152 which encodes the enhancement data in accordance with a given protocol. In addition, the encode processor 152 encodes data indicating which type of data is selected in each signal block, for example by setting a bit for each signal block to indicate the data type. The encoded data from the encode processor 152 is included in the encoded bit stream generated by the encoder 10.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a block diagram of another embodiment of a multi-channel audio decoder according to some embodiments of the invention which specifically may be the audio decoder 20 of Fig. 2.<br>
The decoder 20 comprises a first unit 210 and coupled thereto a second unit 220. The first unit 210 receives down-mix signals lo and ro and modification parameters 105 as inputs. The inputs may for example be received as a single bitstream from the encoder 10 of Fig. 1 or 5. The down-mk signals lo and ro may be part of a spatial down-mix 102 or an artistic down-mix 103.<br>
The first unit 210 comprises a segmentation and transformation unit 211 and a down-mix modification unit 212. The down-mix signals lo and ro, respectively, are segmented and the segmented signals are transformed to the frequency domain in segmentation and transformation unit 211. The resulting frequency domain representations of the segmented down-mix signals are shown as frequency domain signals Lo and Ro, respectively. Next, the frequency domain signals Lo and Ro are processed in the down-mix modification unit 212. The fimction of this down-mix modification unit 212 is to modify the input down-mix such that it resembles the spatial down-mix 202, i.e. to reconstruct the spatial down-mix 202 from the artistic down-mix 103 and the modification parameters 105.<br>
If the spatial down-mix 102 is received by the decoder 20 the down-mix modification unit 212 does not have to modify the down-mix signals Lo and Ro and these down-mix signals Lo and Ro can simply be passed on to the second unit 220 as down-mix signals Ld and Rd of spatial down-mix 202. A control signal 217 may indicate whether there is a need for modification of the input down-mix, i.e. whether the input down-mix is a spatial down-mix or an ahemative down-mix. The control signal 217 may be generated internally in the decoder 20, e.g. by analyzing the input down-mix and the associated parameters 105 which may describe signal properties of the desired spatial down-mix. If the input down-mix<br><br>
matches the desired signal properties the control signal 217 may be set to indicate that there is no need for modification. Alternatively, the control signal 217 may be set manually or its setting may be received as part of the encoded multi-channel audio signal, e.g. in parameter set 105.<br>
If the encoder 20 receives the artistic down-mix 103 and the control signal 217 indicates that the received down-mix signals Lo and Ro are to be modified by the down-mix modification unit 212 then the decoder can operate in two ways, depending on the representation of the received modification parameters. If the parameters represent the relative transformation fi-om the artistic down-mix to the spatial down-mix (i.e. if the parameters is relative enhancement data), the transformation variables are obtained directly by applying the modification parameters to the artistic down-mix in inverse to the operation performed in the encoder. In different embodiments, this may for example be applied to the second part of the second enhancement data of the only.<br>
On the other hand, if the transmitted parameters represent absolute properties of the spatial down-mix, the decoder can directly replace the artistic down-mix samples by the spatial down-mix samples. For example, if the second part of the second enhancement data simply consists in the time/frequency tile samples of the spatial down-mix, the decoder can directly replace the corresponding time/frequency tile samples of the artistic down-mix by these. It will be appreciated that it is also possible for the decoder to first compute the corresponding properties of the actually transmitted artistic dovioi-mix. Using this information (transmitted parameters and computed properties of the transmitted artistic down-mix), the transformation variables are then determined that describe the transform fi-om (properties of) the transmitted artistic down-mix to (properties of) the spatial down-mix. To be more specific, transformation matrbc Tcan be determined using either method Il.a or (a slightly modified) Il.b that were previously described.<br><br><br><br>
Specifically, the down-mix modification unit 212 comprises functionality for extracting the artistic down-mix and the modification parameters 105 from the received bitstream. The artistic down-mix is divided into signal blocks (corresponding to the signal blocks used by the decoder). For each signal block the down-mix modification unit 212 evaluates the received data indication of the bitstream to determine if relative or absolute second enhancement data is provided for the first and for the second part for this signal block. The down-mbc modification unit 212 then applies the first and the second part of the second enhancement data as absolute enhancement data or relative enhancement data in response to the indication data.<br>
It has been found that low complexity but high performance can be achieved when the transformation matrix elements T12 and T21 are set to zero. In the following, some specific implementations of the down-mix modification unit 212 are described with this restriction. However, it will be appreciated that the implementations can easily be extended to the case when Ti2 and/or T21 are different than zero.<br>
In the case where no enhancement data of the second part of the second enhancement data is transmitted for the artistic down-mix signal, the first unit 210 can be implemented as shown in Fig. 8. The time domain stereo down-mix channels, lo and ro, are first segmented and transformed to the irequency domain by a QMF transformation, resulting in the signals La and R^, representing a time/frequency tile of the artistic stereo down-mix. Next, these signals are transformed using the transformation matrix T, resulting in the signals<br>
TiiLaandT22Ra.<br>
It will be appreciated that the enhancement data can be generated and applied in the time and/or frequency domain. Thus, it is possible to include the coded time domain enhancement data (Lcnh, Rcnh) '^ the bit-stream. However, in some applications it can be advantageous to include the coded frequency domain enhancement data rather than the time domain enhancement data. For example, in many encoders the enhancement data is generated in the frequency domain for time/frequency tiles and in order to generate the time domain signal, a frequency to time domain transformation is required at the encoder. Furthermore, in order to apply such enhancement data, the decoder converts the data from the time domain to the frequency domain. The domain conversions can thus be reduced by including the enhancement data in the frequency domain.<br><br>
In some embodiments, different time to frequency conversions may be used for generating the artistic down-mix and the enhancement data. For example, the encoding of the artistic down-mix can use a QMF transform whereas the enhancement data uses a MDCT transform. In this case, the enhancement data may be included in the (MDCT) frequency domain and a transform directly between the two frequency domains can be performed by the down-mix modification unit 212 as illustrated in Fig. 9.<br>
In the example, the transformation matrix T* can simply be the transformation matrix T of Eq. (2). However, in order to reduce switching artefacts T* can correspond to the transformation matrix T of Eq. (2) but modified for a gradual switch. Specifically, the matrix T* can include the factor a as determined by Eq. (30), where the decision regarding absolute or relative enhancement data is retrieved from the bit-stream. This scheme is used for those signal blocks/frequency bands where the enhancement layer data of the second part of the second enhancement data is present and otherwise the approach of Fig. 8 can be used.<br>
If the enhancement data (Lenh, Renh) is provided in the time domain, a similar approach to that of Fig. 9 can be used as illustrated in Fig. 10. However, in this case the frequency to frequency transformation is replaced by a time to frequency transformation which specifically can be by a time to QMF domain transform when QMF transforms are used for encoding the artistic down-mix. Thus, in this example, the enhancement data is applied in the frequency domain.<br>
In many embodiments, a decoder implementation for time domain enhancement data which only uses one time to frequency domain transform in the first unit 210 can be used.<br><br><br><br>
Fig. 11 illustrates an efficient implementation of the down-mix modification unit 212 for time domain enhancement data based on Eq, (34) and (35) is provided. For clarity, T^ and T21 of the matrix T are set to zero. In comparison to the implementation of Fig. 10, only one time to QMF domain transform is required by the implementation of Fig. 11.<br>
Thus, as described above the down-mix modification unit 212 generates a signal 202 which very closely resembles the spatial down-mix used for the multi-channel enhancement data. This may effectively be used by the second unit 220 to expand the two channel audio signal to a fiill surround sound multi-channel signal. Furthermore, by dynamically and flexibly selecting the most appropriate type of enhancement data (relative or absolute) for each signal block, a substantially more efficient encoding is achieved and a multi-channel encoding/decoding with an improved quality to data rate ratio is achieved.<br>
The second unit 220 can be a conventional 2-to-5.1 multi-channel decoder which decodes the reconstructed spatial down-mix 202 and the associated parametric data 104 into a 5.1 channel output signal 203. As described before, the parametric data 104 conprise parametric data 141, 142, 143 and 144. The second unit 220 performs the inverse processing of the first unit 110 in the encoder 10. The second unit 220 comprises an up-mixer 221, which converts the stereo down-mix 202 and associated parameters 144 into three mono audio signals L, R and C. Next, each of the mono audio signals L, R and C, respectively, are de-correlated in de-correlators 222, 225 and 228, respectively. Thereafter, a mixing matrix 223 transforms the mono audio signal L, its de-correlated counterpart and associated parameters 141 into signals Lf and Lr. Similarly, a mixing matrix 226 transforms the mono audio signal R, its de-correlated counterpart and associated parameters 142 into signals Rf and Rr, and a mixing matrix 229 transforms the mono audio signal C, its de-correlated counterpart and associated parameters 143 into signals Co and LFE. Finally, the three pairs of segmented irequency-domain signals Lf and Lr, Rf and Rf, Co and LFE, respectively, are transformed to the time-domain and combined by overlap-add in inverse transformers 224, 227 and 230, respectively to obtain three pairs of output signals If and lr, rf and rr, and co and Ife, respectively. The output signals If, k, rf, rr, co and Ife form the decoded multi-chaimel audio signal 203.<br>
The multi-channel audio encoder 10 and the multi-channel audio decoder 20 may be implemented by means of digital hardware or by means of software which is executed by a digital signal processor or by a general purpose microprocessor.<br><br>
