This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/632,452 (Attorney Docket No. PU040332), filed December 2, 2004 and entitled "QUANTIZER PARAMETER DETERMINATION FOR VIDEO ENCODER RATE CONTROL", which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed towards video encoders, and in particular, towards determination of quantizer parameters for rate control in video encoders.<br>
Background<br>
Video data is generally processed and transferred in the form of bit streams. Rate control involves the process of allocating bits for a group of pictures, a picture, a slice or a macroblock. A desirable rate control scheme should maximize picture quality for a given bit-rate. There are three general types of rate control, including constant bit-rate (CBR), variable bit-rate (VBR) and exact bits. The length of a sequence may or may not be known. If it is known, one can achieve exact bits for the compressed stream, which can be useful for some storage applications. CBR can be used for constant bit-rate transmission channels, such as in broadcast, for example. CBR only requires a small buffer and is normally used in a push mode. VBR can be used for variable bandwidth channels, such as for digital video disk (DVD). VBR typically requires a large buffer and is normally used in a pull mode. Because any channel has a limited bandwidth, VBR has two parameters. One VBR parameter is maximum bit-rate, and the other is average bit-rate. The VBR maximum bit-rate is set for a channel, and the VBR average bit-rate is set for storage space.<br>
Prior methods for rate control have included Test Model 5 (TM5) rate control. Unfortunately, such methods allowed the picture quality to vary too much between pictures and caused blocking within pictures. Embodiments of the present invention address these and other issues.<br>
Summary	"<br>
These and other drawbacks and disadvantages of the prior art are addressed by an apparatus and method for determination of quantizer parameters for rate control in video encoders.<br>
In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a video encoder is provided for encoding video signal data for an image block relative to at least one reference picture, including an adaptive quantizer for applying an adaptive quantizer parameter responsive to a current bit-rate. A corresponding method includes initializing an adaptive quantizer, calculating the bits used by the video signal data with the adaptive quantizer, assigning bits to each of a plurality of picture types, calculating a difference in adaptive quantizer responsive to the assigned bits from the previous number of bits used by the group of pictures and obtaining an updated adaptive quantizer for the video signal data, calculating an adaptive quantizer for a portion of the video signal data, encoding the portion of the video signal data, and obtaining (250) the actual number of bits used for the encoded portion of the video signal data.<br>
These and other aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments, which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The present invention? may be better understood by referencing, and in accordance with, the following exemplary figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a video encoder with adaptive determination of quantizer parameters for rate control in accordance with the principles of the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows a flow diagram for an encoding process with adaptive determination of quantizer parameters for rate control in accordance with the principles of the present invention; and<br>
Figure 3 shows a graphical diagram for a plot of quantizer parameter versus bit rate in accordance with the principles of the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention encompasses an apparatus and method for determination of quantizer parameters for rate control in video encoders. One embodiment described in the instant description is usable in rate control for H.264 video encoders or similar video compression schemes, for example; although application of the principles of the invention are not to be construed as being so limited. A new model is created to determine an adaptive quantizer parameter (QP) as a function of bit-rate. The adaptive QP optimizes the picture quality for various bit-rates. Previous encoding statistical information is used for encoding the next pictures.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may choose the QP according to bit-rate to accomplish rate control for video compression and encoding. A preferred embodiment creates and numerates a QP versus bit-rate model. A QP for a group of pictures (GOP) and for each type of picture is calculated by using the model such that picture quality is optimized at a given bit-rate. These and other embodiments improve picture quality variation between pictures, and blocking inside of pictures.<br>
The following description merely illustrates the principles of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements that, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of the invention and are included within its spirit and scope. Furthermore, all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the invention arid the concepts contributed by the inventor to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions. Moreover, all statements herein reciting principles, aspects, and embodiments of the invention, as well as specific examples thereof, are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally, it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future, i.e., any elements developed that perform the same function, regardless of structure.<br>
The functions of the various elements shown in the figures may be provided through the use of dedicated, hardware as well as hardware capable of executing software in association with appropriate software. When provided by a processor, the functions may be provided by a single dedicated processor, by a single shared processor, or by a plurality of individual processors, some of which may be shared.

Applicant thus regards any means that can provide those functionalities as equivalent to those shown herein.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a video encoder with determination of quantizer parameters for rate control is indicated generally by the reference numeral 100. An input to the encoder 100 is connected in signal communication with a non-inverting input of a summing junction 110. The output of the summing junction 110 is connected in signal communication with a block transformer 120. The input to the encoder 100 is further connected in signal communication with an intra prediction block 115 for I pictures, which has its output connected to a second input of the transformer 120. The transformer 120 is connected in signal communication with a quantizer 130. Although the invention described herein is conceptually part of the quantizer 130, it shall be understood that a separate quantizer parameter determination unit for rate control may feed the quantizer 130 in alternate embodiments, with the signaling between the units indicating which quantizer parameter to use. The output of the quantizer 130 is connected in signal<br>
communication with a variable length coder ("VLC") 140, where the output of the VLC 140 is an externally available output of the encoder 100.<br>
The output of the quantizer 130 is further connected in signal communication with an inverse quantizer 1,50. The inverse quantizer 150 is connected in signal communication with an invefse block transformer 160, which, in turn, is connected in signal communication with a reference picture store 170. A first output of the reference picture store 170 is connected in signal communication with a first input of a motion estimator 180 for multiple reference pictures. The input to the encoder 100 is further connected in signal communication with a second input of the motion estimator 180.<br>
The output of the motion estimator 180 is connected in signal communication with a first input of a motion compensator 190. A second output of the reference picture store 170 is connected in signal communication with a second input of the motion compensator 190. The output of the motion compensator 190 is connected in signal communication with an inverting input of the summing junction 110.<br>
Turning to Figure 2, an exemplary encoding process with determination of quantizer parameters for rate control in accordance with the present invention is indicated generally by the reference numeral 200. The process 200 includes a starting point 210 to start encoding a group of pictures (GOP). An initialization step 215 is used to initialize a quantizer parameter (QP). In step 220, a calculation of the bits for the current GOP is performed. Step 225, adds bits saved with a weight function and subtracts bits overused with a weight function. Step 230 assigns bits to each type of picture. Step 235, in turn, calculates a difference QP (DQP) from previous GOP bits and obtains the QP for the current GOP. Step 240 calculates the QP for the current picture and passes control to step 245 to encode the picture. Step 250 determines the actual number of bits for the picture and passes control to a decision step 255. The decision step 255 determines whether to begin a new GOP, and if so, passes control back'to step 220 for calculating bits for the new GOP, On the other hand, if decision step 255 makes the determination not to begin a new GOP, it passes control back to step 230 to assign bits for each type of picture.<br>
Turning now to Figure 3, plot of bit-rate versus quantizer parameter for rate control in accordance with principles of the present invention is indicated generally by the reference numeral 300. Here, quantizer parameter value is indicated along the<br>
horizontal axis with bit-rate value indicated along the vertical axis. The exemplary plot shows the QP and bit-rate curve for a HD video at a picture size of 1920x1080 and 24 Hz. In this exemplary embodiment, quantizer parameter value is generally increasing with respect to decreasing bit-rate, according to the following formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Rate control involves the process of allocating bits for a group of pictures, a picture, a slice and/or a macroblock. Preferred embodiments of the present invention assume that the length of a sequence is unknown. The group of pictures (GOP) includes pictures between two adjacent intra coded pictures, and also includes the first intra-coded picture.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention can meet bit-rate and/or storage requirements, avoid 'buffer overflow and underflow, encode good picture quality with a desired number of bits, limit picture quality variance between pictures, and encode good sequence quality at a desired bit-rate. A bit budget may be used for a sequence, a GOP, a picture, a slice and/or a macroblock.<br>
A bit budget may assume, for example, that the total bits and/or length of a sequence is unknown, that a GOP means pictures between two adjacent I pictures, and that the initial picture bit budget ratio for I, P, and B types of pictures is I:P:B = 6:3:1. The ratio may be updated after each GOP is encoded. For example, the initial bit budget ratio for a succeeding GOP may be initialized to the bit budget ratio resulting from the previous GOP. The bits may correspond to the maximum number of GOP bits (used only for VBR), the average GOP bits, the previous GOP .bits, and the total available bits.<br>
An estimate of encoding complexity may be obtained for an I picture or intra block as the sum of absolute difference, for a P picture as the sum of absolute prediction difference, for a B picture as the sum of absolute bi-directional prediction difference, and for a macroblock as the sum of absolute difference.<br>
For an exemplary VBR embodiment, after each picture is encoded, the Encoder Buffer Level is increased by the number of Picture Bits, the bit-rate is selected as the minimum of the {Max Bit Rate, Encoder Buffer Level multiplied by the Picture Rate, and the (Decoder Buffer Size minus the Decoder Buffer Level)<br>
multiplied by the Picture Rate}, the Bit-rate is varying from picture to picture, the<br>
Decoder Buffer Level is increased by the Bit-rate divided by the Picture Rate, and, when a picture is removed, the Decoder Buffer Level is decreased by the Out Picture Bits.<br>
For an exemplary CBR embodiment, after each picture is encoded, the Encoder Buffer Level is increased by the number of Picture Bits, the Bit-rate is the Bit-rate Specified, the Bit-rate is constant throughout the sequence, the Decoder Buffer Level is increased by the Bit-rate divided by the Picture Rate, and, when a picture is removed, the Decoder Buffer Level is decreased by the Out Picture Bits.A decoder buffer may be modeled with a buffer size set equal to the average bit-rate for 2-GOP bits. To avoid decoder buffer overflow, if the to-be-encoded picture might cause the decoder buffer to dyerf low, the encoder may reduce the picture size by increasing the QP. To avoid decoder buffer underflow, if the to-be-encoded picture might cause the decoder buffer to underflow, the encoder may increase the picture size by decreasing the QP and increase the bit-rate for VBR.An encoder buffer may be modeled by a Buffer size equal to the average bit-rate for 2-GOP bits. If the encoder buffer is in underflow, append zeros. If the to-be-encoded picture might cause the encoder buffer to underflow, increase the picture size. If the to-be-encoded picture might cause the encoder buffer to overflow, reduce the picture size.The end-to-end delay may be determined from encoder buffer output delay. For VBR, end-to-end delay may be determined from one picture, while six pictures have also been used successfully in verification experiments. For CBR, end-to-end delay may be determined from the starting output stream when the buffer is half full.<br>
Decoder buffer delay may be computed as well.  When a picture is scheduled to be removed,, all bits of the picture shall be in the decoder buffer. For VBR, the decoder buffer delay depends on the maximum number bits of a picture, while six pictures have been used successfully in verification experiments. For CBR, the decoder buffer delay may be determined when the buffer is half full.<br>
In operation, a bit budget for a picture in a GOP is determined by the target bit-rate, the bits consumed in the previous encoded GOP, and the difference bits between the targeted and the consumed bits up to the previous GOP.<br>
	(Figure Removed)<br>
With terms defined below (see Eqn. 6), the number of bits of an intra coded picture is leB times that of a B picture, and the number of bits of a P picture is PeB times that of a B picture. In a GOP, there is one I picture, Np P pictures, and NB B pictures. The target bits for each kind of picture is:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The first GOP Quantizer Parameter (QP) is initialized by using statistical results. For Each new GOP:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where dqp is a difference QP and is added to the previous GOP to form the new GOP QP; b is the base, here b is chosen 1.4; IB, PB are constants, they are the factors contributing to the GOP QP for I and P picture, respectively, here IB=4, PB=2;<br>
The GOP Picture QP is used for the I picture QP.<br>
For P pictures,<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where K1P+KiB=1 . In the case of no B pictures, KIB=O; in the case of two B pictures between previous P and current P, BitspreViousB is average bits of the two B pictures. Here, Kip=3/4 for one B picture, 1/2 for 2 B pictures;<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where Kap+Kae^l , here K2p=1/2; BitspreV!ousp is average bits of the previous two encoded P pictures; d is base, here d=1 .8;<br>
The function between QP and bit-rate has been found<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
If the bit-rate is changed from bri to Br2l the QP should be changed to QP2,<br>
Thus, in operation of exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the encoder 100 and quantizer 130 of Figure 1 implement the method 200 of Figure 2. At step 210 of Figure 2, the encoder prepares to encode a new Group of Pictures (GOP). A GOP is defined as the pictures between two Intra coded pictures, including<br>
the first Intra coded picture but not the second intra coded picture. At step 215, the first GOP Quantizer Parameter (QP) is initialized from statistical data collected perimentally. Exemplary statistical data may include, for example, 1) picture size: 2x288 (GIF), frame rate 30 Hz, QP is initialized to (106-bit-rate)/105+30; 2) picture :e: 720x480 (SD), frame rate 24 Hz, Film, QP=(4*106-bit-rate)/3*106+20; and 3) :ture size: 1920x1088(HD), frame rate 24 Hz, film, QP=(107-bit-rate)/5*106+26. At step 220 of Figure 2, the encoder calculates target bits for the GOP as:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
At step 225, the encoder determines the bits available to the GOP as the target bit count plus the bits that are saved from encoding previous GOPs or minus the bits that are overused by previous GOPs. At step 230, a bit budget is made for each type of picture. The numbers of bits for I, P and B pictures are calculated from the following formulas, respectively:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
This bit budget is recalculated after each picture is encoded. At step 235, the difference QP (dqp) and QP of a GOP are calculated from the following formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
This formula comes frqm the Bit-rate-QP model of the present invention. At step 240, a QP is calculated fdr each picture. For an l-picture, the QP of the I picture is the QP of the GOP. For a P-picture, the target bit count for a P picture is computed from the bits used by the previous P and B pictures and the bits available for the picture, and the dqp is calculated from that.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The formula of Equation 16, above, also comes from the model of the present invention. For a B-picture, the target bit count for a B-picture is computed from<br>
previous B and P pictures and the available bits for the picture, and from that the dqp is calculated.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
For more fine rate control, the QP of each block or macroblock is calculated. The target bit count for each type of block is computed, and a like approach is used to calculate the dqp for each block. At step 245, a picture is encoded using the QP obtained from the previous steps. If a finer rate control is used, each block is encoded from the QP obtained from the previous steps, and the average QP is used for reference to the next pictures. At step 250, when a picture is encoded, the actual number of bits is counted, and the average QP is calculated. At step 255, if all pictures in the GOP are encoded, the QP of the GOP is computed by using a weighted average of QPs of all pictures in the GOP, as shown below in Equation 18. Otherwise, the next picture is encoded in the same manner described above.<br>
