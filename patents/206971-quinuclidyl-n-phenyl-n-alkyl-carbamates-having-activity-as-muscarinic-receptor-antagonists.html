Carbamates derived from arylalkylamines<br>
The present invention relates to new compounds of type quinuclidyl A/-phenyl-A/-alkyi carbamate acting as muscarinic receptor antagonists, to the preparation of such compounds, and to the use of the same in the prevention and treatment of diseases related with respiratory tract, digestive tract, and urinary system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE ART<br>
It is known that compounds having a muscarinic receptor antagonizing effect induce bronchodilation, gastrointestinal motility inhibition, gastric acid secretion reduction, dry mouth, mydriasis, tachycardia, as well as urinary bladder contraction inhibition.<br>
Between 1983 and 1993, continuous advances were produced in the knowledge of muscarinic receptor pharmacology. During this period, a total of five human genes codifying muscarinic receptor subtypes (ml, m2, m3, m4 and m5) were cloned and expressed, which encoded five functional receptors (M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5). Although M5 is not completely characterized, it is already considered a functional receptor according to NC-IUPHAR Guidelines (MP. Caulfield et al.; Pharmacol. Rev. 1998, 50, 279-290).<br>
The M1 receptor is a postsynaptic neuronal receptor mainly located in brain and peripheral parasympathetic glands. In smooth cardiac muscle there is a major population of M2 receptors. The M3 receptor is predominantly located in glandular exocrine tissues such as salivary • glands. The M4 receptor is mainly present in cerebral cortex, striatum and some peripheral locations in specific species. In the smooth muscle of intestinal tract, bladder and bronchus, M2 and M3 receptors coexist. Nevertheless, functional information commonly accepted indicates that the M3 receptor is the responsible for the contractile effect of the endogenous neurotransmitter in the latter three tissues. Thus, it seems interesting to obtain M3 receptor selective antagonists to avoid the adverse effects due<br><br>
to blockade of other muscarinic receptors. At present, oxybutynin (Nippon Shinyaku), and tolterodine (Pharmacia) among others are commercially available compounds, both showing reduced selectivity for M2 and M3 receptors. However, darifenacin (Pfizer), and YIV1-905 (Yamanouchi), both in development phase, exhibit M3 antagonist activity without any significant affinity towards the M2 receptor.<br><br>
The following are some patent applications claiming compounds with carbamic structures as selective M3 receptor antagonists: JP 04/95071-A, WO 95/06635-A, EP 747355-A and EP 801067-A. All of them describe carbamates different to those described in the present invention, and the last one describes the structurally nearest to the hereby claimed.<br>
Therefore, it is understood that there is a big interest in providing new therapeutic agents that are selective M3 receptor antagonists.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
An aspect of the present invention relates to the provision of new carbamates of general fornnula (I)<br><br>
and stereoisonners, mixtures of stereoisomers, pharmaceuticaily acceptable salts, and pharmaceuticaily acceptable solvates thereof, wherein: R1, R2 and R3 are radicals independently selected from the group consisting of H, OH, SH, CN, F. CI, Br, I, carbamoylamtne, (C1-C4)-alkylthio, (C1-C4)-alkoxyl, (C1-C4)-alkoxyi substituted with one or several F, (C1-C4)-alkyl, and (C1-C4)-alkyl substituted with one or several F or OH; alternatively, either R1 and R2, or R2 and R3 may be forming a biradical selected from the group consisting of-CH2-CH2-CH2-, and -CH2"CH2-CH2"CH2".<br>
In compounds of formula (I), R4 is a radical selected from the croup consisting of cyciopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexenyl, norbornenyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl, 2-, 3-thienyl, 2-. 3-furyi, 2-, 3-, 4-pyridyl, 1-, 2-naphtyl, 1-, 2-ben2odioxolanyl, 1-, 2-benzodioxanyt, phenyl, and phenyl substituted with one or several substituents selected from the group consisting of OH, SH, CN, F, 01, Br, I, carbamoylamine, hydroxycarbonyl, (C1-C4)-alkoxycarbonyi, (C1-C4)-alkylthio, (C1-C4)alkyl, (C1-C4)-alkoxyl, {C1-C4)-alkyl substituted with one or several F or OH, and (C1-C4)-alkoxyl substituted with one or several F.<br><br>
In a particular embodiment, R4 is phenyl or phenyl substituted with one or several substituents selected from the group consisting of: OH, SH, CN, F, CI, Br, 1, carbamoylamine, hydroxycarbonyl, (C1-C4)-alkoxicarbonyl, (C1-C4)-alkylthio, (C1-C4)-alkyl, (C1-C4)-alkoxyl, (C1-C4)-alkyl substituted with one or several F or OH, and (C1-C4)-alkoxyl substituted with one or several F. In another particular embodiment, R4 is a radical selected from the group consisting of cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyi, cyclohexenyi, norbornenyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl, 2-, 3-thienyl, 2-, 3-furyl, 2-, 3-, 4-piridyl, 1-, 2-naphtyl, 1-, 2-benzodioxolanyt, and 1-, 2-benzodioxanyl.<br>
The nitrogen atom of the quinuclidine ring can be in an oxidized state (N-oxide) or as a pharmaceutically acceptable quaternary alkylamonium salt, wherein the alkylic chain, from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, may be linear or branched.<br>
Particularly preferred are compounds of formula (1) where the carbon 3 of the quinuclidine ring is {R), having the formula:<br><br>
In cases where compounds of fornnula (1) have an asymmetric carbon, the racemic mixtures thereof can be resolved in their enantiomers by conventional methods, such as separation by chromatography with chiral stationary phase or by fractioned crystallization of their diasteroisomeric salts. The later can be prepared by reaction with enantiomerically pure acids. Chiral compounds of formula (1) may also be obtained by enantioselective synthesis through chiral precursors.<br><br>
The present invention is also related to physiologically acceptable salts of carbamates of general structure (1), in particular to addition salts with mineral acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, sulphuric, and phosphoric acids, as well as with organic acids such as oxalic, succinic, fumaric, tartaric and maleic acids.<br>
The present invention is also related to A/-oxides of carbamates of general structure (I) and to quaternary (C1-C4)-alkytamonium salts of such carbamates with pharmaceutically acceptable anions.<br>
Compounds of general structure (I) can be prepared by two general methods (namely, A and B) represented in the scheme below. Starting arylalkylamines (11) are commercially available, or may be obtained by known methods such as alkylation of anilines, reductive amination, or reduction of anilides.<br>
According to Method A, acylation of the arylalkylamine (II) through a chioroformate (e.g. methyichloroformate, ethylchloroformate or 4-nitrophenylchloroformate) in an inert solvent (e.g. dimethylformamide, CH2CI2,1,2-dichloroethane, tetrahydrofurane or toluene) is carried out first, at a temperature ranging from 0 °C to the reflux temperature of the solvent. In some cases, it is advisable to carry out the reaction using the corresponding chioroformate as solvent, or using a base such as a tertiary amine or potassic carbonate. Then, the alkoxylic moiety is introduced by a transesterification reaction between the carbamate intermediate (III) and 3-quinuc!idoi, using a base such as sodium metal, sodium hydride, or sodium methoxide. The reaction can be carried out at a temperature ranging from 20°C to the reflux temperature of the used solvent.<br>
According to Method B, 3-quinudidol is first reacted with a chioroformate (e.g. trichioromethylchlcroformate) in an inert solvent (e.g. dimethylformamide, CH2CI2,1,2-diclhoroethane) at the reflux temperature of the solvent in order to obtain the corresponding hydrochloride of quinuclidol chioroformate. Then, arylalkylamine (II) is acylated with<br><br>
quinuclidol chJoroformate. The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent (e.g. dimethylformamide, CH2CI2, CHCI3, 1,2-dichloroethane) at a temperature ranging from 20 °C to the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
As it is illustrated in the enclosed human muscarinic receptor binding tests, the compounds of the present invention are selective M3 receptor antagonists versus M2 receptor. For this reason they can be used for the treatment of urinary incontinence (particularly, the one caused by unstable bladder), irritable bowel syndrome, and respiratory disorders (particularly, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, asthma, emphysema, and rhinitis), as well as in ophthalmic interventions.<br>
Thus, another aspect of the present invention is the use of carbamates of formula (I) for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of the following diseases: urinary incontinence, particulariy when it is caused by unstable bladder; irritable bowel syndrome; respiratory disorders, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, asthma, emphysema, and rhinitis. Furthermore, their use for the preparation of a medicament for ophthalmic interventions, is also forming part of this aspect of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
Binding test to human M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors<br>
The following tests show the M3 antagonist activity of compounds of formula (I), as well as their selectivity towards the M2 receptor. The results obtained for cloned human muscarinic M2 and M3 receptors are listed, and the used methodology is described.<br>
Membranes from CH0-K1 cells transfected with human M2 or M3 receptors (Receptor Biology) were used. The summarised experimental procedure for both receptors was the following: membranes (15-20 pg) were incubated with [^H]-NMS (0.3-0.5 nM) for 60 min at 25 °C, in presence or absence of the antagonists. Incubation was carried out in 96 wells polystyrene microplates in a total incubation volume of 0,2 mL of PBS pH 7.4. Non specific binding was determined in parallel assays in presence of atropine (5 μM). Samples were filtered through type GF/C glass fibre, preincubated with PEI 0,3%. Filters were washed 3-4 times with 50 mM Tris-HCI, 0,9% NaCI, pH 7.4 at 4°C, and dried at 50 °C for 45 min. Filter bound radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
For the calculation of the inhibition constant (Kj), displacement curves were analysed by non-linear regression (GraphPad Prism). Dissociation constant (KQ) of [3H]-NMS for each receptor was obtained through the saturation curves obtained in the same conditions as the experiments carried out with the antagonists. The results obtained, expressed as the mean of two independent experiments, each performed in duplicate, are shown in the table below. M2/M3 ratios greater than 1 indicates a M3 selective antagonist activity.<br>
