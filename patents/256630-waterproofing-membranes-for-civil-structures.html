				<td>THREE-DIMENSIONAL REVERSE TANKIMG MEMBRANES<br>
INVENTORS: Jyoti Sefh, Jay Kellett, M. S. Chetan and Neal S. Berke<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to reverse tanking waterproofing<br>
membranes which bond to freshly poured concrete, and more particularly to<br>
membranes having three-dimensional contours for creating unified moisture<br>
barriers in and around detail areas and other surface irregularities.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Waterproofing membranes having flexible plastic sheets for carrying a<br>
preformed, pressure-sensitive adhesive layer have been used for a number of<br>
years to provide protection to existing building surfaces. The adhesive layers<br>
are typically made of rubber-modified bitumen, which is aggressively sticky,<br>
and is covered by a release sheet that is removed before attaching the<br>
membrane to the substrate surface.<br>
A technique for "reverse tanking" waterproofing is described in US<br>
Patent 4,994,328 of Cogliano (bituminous adhesive) and US Patent 5,316,848 of<br>
Bartlett et al. (non-bituminous synthetic adhesive). According to this<br>
technique, the waterproofing membrane is first attached with the back side of<br>
its carrier sheet against a "formwork" (i.e., concrete mold usually formed by<br>
wooden boards joined together). Consequently, the waterproofing adhesive<br>
layer faces outwards. A concrete structure is created by casting concrete<br>
against the membrane-covered formwork surface, and this may be referred to<br>
as "post cast" or "post applied" concrete. The adhesive layer is covered by an<br>
elastomeric protective coating layer, a particle coating layer, or mixture or<br>
arrangement of both (i.e., either individually, mixed together as one layer, or<br>
arranged as discrete layers), to protect the adhesive from dirt and damage.<br>
This protective coating layer (whether of polymeric or particle coating) also<br>
operates to decrease the tack of the adhesive. The outer surface is further<br>
protected by a release sheet liner (that must be removed before fresh concrete<br>
is poured against the adhesive/protective coating layers). After curing, the<br>
concrete is bonded with the adhesive/protective coating layers, and thus a<br>
waterproofing bond is achieved in "reverse" order.<br>
Hence, in the world of "reverse tanking" waterproofing, it can be said<br>
that the waterproofing is "pre-applied" because it precedes the concrete<br>
structure; and, in turn, the concrete is said to be "post cast" or "post applied"<br>
because it follows installation of waterproofing.<br>
Reverse tanking is further discussed in US Patent Nos. 5,496,615 and<br>
6,500,520 which teach using particle coating layers. In the '615 patent,<br>
inorganic particles are used to resist foot traffic when the membrane is<br>
installed on a horizontal surface. In the '520 patent, particles are applied on<br>
top of an adhesive layer to enhance bonding with concrete by reacting with<br>
calcium hydroxide generated during hydration of cement.<br>
One of the difficulties of reverse tanking is achieving continuity of<br>
waterproofing in detail areas (i.e., surface irregularities), and especially in<br>
"tieback" detailing. Tiebacks are the terminal ends of rods or cables<br>
supporting the formwork and found protruding at intervals through the<br>
formwork surface. Other surface irregularities include penetration areas,<br>
such as where pipes or pile caps extend through the formwork.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the present process used in the industry for<br>
waterproofing "tiebacks" on concrete formworks. Drainage mats or sheets,<br>
which usually involve a fabric attached to a cuspated core sheet, are placed<br>
against the wooden formwork, and covered by sheets of reverse tanking<br>
waterproofing membrane, previously described above. Such sheet materials<br>
are available from Grace Construction Products, Cambridge, Massachusetts,<br>
under the trademarks HYDRODUCT® (drainage) and PREPRUFE®<br>
(waterproofing membranes). These sheet materials are required to be cut and<br>
arranged to surround the area on the formwork occupied by the tieback,<br>
which can be as large as a man's chest.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a wooden or metal box must be fabricated and<br>
fitted over the tieback. The box is fastened to the formwork, such as by<br>
screws and brackets, with a bead of adhesive for sealing around the edges<br>
against the formwork. The box is filled with liquid mastic or mortar cement<br>
to prevent twisting or collapse of the box due to the poured concrete.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the box is covered with waterproofing strips. The<br>
strips are available as a double-sided adhesive "tape" from Grace<br>
Construction Products under the PREPRUFE® brand name. One side has a<br>
tacky adhesive that sticks onto the box and surrounding formwork; the other<br>
side has a coated adhesive layer for bonding to post cast concrete. Although<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate a finished tape "box" shape, the actual waterproofing<br>
of the box with strips requires painstaking labor. The tape strips must be<br>
overlapped to provide a continuous barrier over and around the tieback.<br>
Fabricating, fastening, and waterproofing each box at a tie back detail requires<br>
about 30 minutes or more. In formwork installations that exceed one<br>
thousand square feet, one may confront one hundred tiebacks. Providing<br>
waterproofing for such detail areas as these would thus require days of labor.<br>
In view of the foregoing disadvantages, a novel method and<br>
waterproofing membrane system are needed for decreasing labor costs in<br>
waterproofing installations wherein tiebacks, pipe penetrations, pile cap<br>
penetrations, and other surface irregularities are encountered.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In surmounting prior art disadvantages, the present invention provides<br>
"reverse tanking" waterproofing for detail areas and other surface<br>
irregularities. An exemplary waterproofing membrane of the invention,<br>
having a three-dimensional contour surrounded entirely or partially by a flat<br>
collar portion, can be positioned over tiebacks or other surface irregularities,<br>
and seamed with conventional reverse tanking membranes to provide a<br>
continuous waterproofing barrier. Preferably, such shaped membranes are<br>
used in combination with correspondingly shaped molded support structures<br>
to prevent the membranes from collapsing under the weight of post cast<br>
concrete (i.e., concrete which is cast against them after they are installed).<br>
In an exemplary method of the invention, a molded rigid plastic or<br>
metal dome is positioned over a tieback and fastened to the formwork, and a<br>
"shaped" waterproofing membrane having a corresponding dome shape is<br>
fitted over the support and seamed with adjacent "sheet-form" waterproofing<br>
membranes on the formwork to provide a continuous moisture barrier. The<br>
term "shaped" will be used to define the reverse tanking membranes of the<br>
invention, in contrast to the term "sheet-form" which will be used to define<br>
conventional reverse tanking membranes (typically supplied in roll form).<br>
As another example, a waterproofing membrane having a threedimensional<br>
shape, such as a circular- or conical-shaped sleeve, surrounded<br>
by a contiguous flat collar portion, may be employed for waterproofing<br>
around penetrations such as pipes and pile caps. Three-dimensional shaped<br>
waterproofing membranes, having shapes such as domes, cones, cylinders,<br>
pyramids, or other three-dimensional forms, will save several steps otherwise<br>
needed for providing a continuous barrier at penetration joints. Such<br>
membranes may have at least one or both major faces coated with one or<br>
more conventional waterproofing adhesive layers (e.g., rubberized asphalt,<br>
synthetic polymeric adhesives, clay-based adhesives, etc.) which are operative<br>
to bond with fresh concrete.<br>
The present invention is also directed to waterproofed structures<br>
formed by the methods described herein, as well as to shaped waterproofing<br>
membranes and methods for making such membranes. An exemplary<br>
method for making shaped membranes comprises: providing a laminate<br>
having a carrier support sheet and, contiguous therewith, a continuous<br>
pressure-sensitive waterproofing adhesive layer, with optionally a protective<br>
polymeric coating layer and/or particle coating layer over the adhesive layer;<br>
and molding the laminate as one piece to provide a shaped waterproofing<br>
membrane having a three-dimensional contour that is entirely or partially<br>
surrounded by a flat collar portion. Preferably, the carrier support sheet<br>
comprises a polyolefin blend tiiat is operative to be molded below SOOT.<br>
More preferably, the support sheet comprises a blend of LDPE and HDPE<br>
resin, and the pressure-sensitive adhesive is a non-bituminous synthetic<br>
adhesive (e.g., SIS).<br>
The choice of materials is such that the laminate may be thermally<br>
molded into a three-dimensional contour at temperatures below 300°F, and<br>
more preferably below 250°F, without destroying the continuity of the<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer or protective coating layer, nor the ability of<br>
these layers to provide a waterproofing bond with post cast concrete.<br>
Other advantages and features of the invention are discussed in further<br>
detail hereinafter.<br>

Detailed Description of Exemplary Embodiments<br>
The waterproofing systems described herein are intended to bond with<br>
fresh cementitious compositions that are cast against them and allowed to<br>
harden. Cementitious compositions, such as concrete or mortar cement,<br>
which is applied this way to the waterproofing membranes, are sometimes<br>
referred to as being "post cast" or "post applied."<br>
The terms "cement" and "cementitious composition" are used to refer<br>
to dry powders as well as to pastes, mortars, grouts, and concrete<br>
compositions comprising a hydratable cement binder. The terms "paste",<br>
"mortar" and "concrete" are terms of art: pastes are mixtures composed of a<br>
hydratable cement binder (usually, but not exclusively, Portland cement,<br>
masonry cement, or mortar cement). Mortars are pastes additionally<br>
including fine aggregate (e.g., sand), and concrete are mortars additionally<br>
including coarse aggregate (e.g., crushed gravel, stone). Cementitious<br>
compositions are typically formed by mixing hydratable cement, water, and<br>
fine and/or coarse aggregate.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, an exemplary "shaped" waterproofing membrane<br>
10 and optional exemplary supporting structure 30 can be used to provide a<br>
continuous waterproofing barrier over a tieback 40 or other surface detail on<br>
the construction surface before concrete is post cast against it.<br>
As illustrated in the magnified view (enlarged circle) in Fig. 3, the<br>
waterproofing membrane 10 comprises at least one carrier support sheet 12<br>
having first and second major opposing faces, and, attached to a first major<br>
face thereof, at least one continuous pressure-sensitive waterproofing<br>
adhesive layer 14 operative to bond with post cast concrete or mortar.<br>
Optionally, but preferably, a protective layer 16, such as an elastomer<br>
coating, a particulate layer, or a mixture thereof (e.g., particles mixed into the<br>
elastomer) or arrangement thereof (e.g., discrete particle layer on top of or<br>
partially embedded into an elastomer layer) operates to protect the adhesive<br>
layer 14 from dirt and debris.<br>
For example, the carrier support sheet 12, pressure-sensitive<br>
waterproofing adhesive layer 14, and optional protective layer 16 of the may<br>
comprise materials and incorporate thickness dimensions taught in US<br>
Patents 5,316,848 and 5,496,615 of Bartlett et al., wherein it was taught that the<br>
carrier support sheet may be fabricated from a thermoplastic, rubber, or metal<br>
in the form of a continuous film, a woven material, or a non-woven material.<br>
Thermoplastics particularly suited for use in the present invention include<br>
high density polyethylene (HOPE), polyethylene teraphthate (PET),<br>
polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyamides (PA), or combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
While HDPE was the carrier support sheet material preferred by<br>
Bartlett et al., the present inventors prefer using, for making shaped<br>
waterproofing membranes 10 of the present invention, a carrier support sheet<br>
12 in the form of a continuous film made from a polyolefin blend. Most<br>
preferably, the blend comprises low density polyethylene (LDPE) and high<br>
density polyethylene (HDPE). The carrier support sheet 12 can be made by<br>
sheet-extruding the polymer or polymer blend through a sheet die and/or<br>
calendaring the sheet between opposed rollers to achieve a relatively uniform<br>
thickness. Use of LDPE in the polyolefin'blend is preferred due to increased<br>
ease of thermal molding (thermoforming). This is because the preferred<br>
method of the present invention involves thermoforming the carrier support<br>
sheet 12 and preformed waterproofing adhesive layer 14, and optionally a<br>
protective layer 16, altogether as one integral unit, e.g., as a unified laminate.<br>
Other polyolefin blends may be possible for the carrier support sheet<br>
12, such as very low density polyethylene (VLDPE) and HDPE or<br>
polypropylene.<br>
While it is possible to mold the carrier support sheet 12 separately,<br>
followed by subsequently applying the waterproofing adhesive 14 and<br>
optional protective layer 16 as separate coatings, the use of thermal molding<br>
("thermoforming") to obtain a three-dimensional shaped waterproofing<br>
membrane 10 from a unified laminate will save time and provide economic<br>
advantages. The thickness of the individual layers may change during<br>
thermoforming, which is the preferred method of making the shaped<br>
membranes, and so initial thicknesses of the layers should be chosen with this<br>
fact in mind.<br>
For example, the waterproofing membrane laminate 10 can be<br>
manufactured by coating or extruding onto a paper or plastic release sheet<br>
(not shown) first the protective layer 16 (e.g., polymer coating), followed by<br>
coating or extruding the waterproofing adhesive layer 14 (e.g., SIS), and then<br>
the resultant laminate can be applied to the carrier support sheet 14; and the<br>
release sheet can be removed just before the membrane laminate 12/14/16 is<br>
thermoformed to provide the shaped waterproofing membrane 10.<br>
Alternatively, the adhesive 14 and protective 16 layers can be coated or<br>
extruded directly onto the carrier support sheet 12, and then the release sheet<br>
liner (not shown) can be applied, such as by calendaring it onto the laminate<br>
whereby the calendaring operation ensures a uniform total thickness of the<br>
membrane. In either case, the release sheet liner is removed before molding<br>
(e.g., thermoforming) of the membrane to provide the three-dimensional<br>
profile.<br>
In still further exemplary methods and membranes of the invention,<br>
the adhesive 14 and protective coating layer 16 (polymeric) can be coextruded<br>
simultaneously between a carrier support sheet 12 and release sheet.<br>
For example, a continuous operation may involve co-extruding the adhesive<br>
and protective coating layers between the carrier support sheet 14 and release<br>
liner as they are being bed between rollers which laminate them together.<br>
Again, the release sheet is used for purposes of making the laminate and<br>
protecting the adhesive/protecting coatings until the thermoforming stage,<br>
whereupon it is preferably removed and discarded.<br>
"In exemplary methods of the invention, the 'thermoforming stage<br>
should preferably involve temperatures under 300°F in order to prevent<br>
damage to the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (and protecting coating layer)<br>
which must retain integrity, sufficient thickness, and ability to bond with and<br>
to waterproof post cast concrete. It is preferable to subject the carrier support<br>
sheet 12 side of the membrane 10 to a temperature mat is higher than the<br>
adhesive layer 14 side because it is the carrier support sheet 12 that primarily<br>
requires thermal softening for purposes of shaping, whereas the adhesive<br>
layer is more easily conformable and would require less heat for molding.<br>
The thickness of the carrier support sheet 12 is preferably 10-150 mils thick<br>
and more preferably 30-80 mils thick.<br>
An exemplary three-dimensional contour 11, shown as a dome shape<br>
in Fig. 3, may have an average diameter and height of 10 cm - 100 cm or<br>
larger, depending on the size of the surface detail, and is entirely or partially<br>
surrounded by a flat collar portion 13. The thickness and materials of the<br>
carrier support sheet 12 are chosen such that, in combination with the<br>
waterproofing adhesive layer 14 and protective coating layer 16, the average<br>
temperature needed for thermoforming the shaped membrane 10 (as a<br>
laminate) does not exceed 300°F (all temperatures herein being described in<br>
degrees Fahrenheit).<br>
Although the pressure-sensitive waterproofing adhesive layer 14 may<br>
comprise a bituminous adhesive, the present inventors prefer using synthetic<br>
non-bituminous adhesives. Such synthetic adhesives may include butyl<br>
rubber, polyisobutylene, polyisobutyl rubber, acrylic (or acrylate), vinyl ether<br>
based adhesives, styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), styrene-ethylene-butylenestyrene<br>
based (SEES), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), or mixtures thereof.<br>
Another possible adhesive is ethylene propylene diene monomer. Most<br>
preferred, however, are pressure-sensitive hot-melt adhesive block<br>
copolymers of SIS. Preferred adhesive layers should also withstand melting<br>
temperatures in the range between 160°F and SOOT (for a duration of between<br>
2 seconds to 2 minutes) without losing their continuous layer form and<br>
without the adhesive layer 14 (and optional protective coating layer 16) losing<br>
the ability to provide a bond with post cast concrete.<br>
The pressure sensitive adhesive layer 14 can optionally contain typical<br>
additives, such as light absorbers (i.e., carbon black, benzotriazoles, etc.), light<br>
stabilizers (i.e. hindered amines, benzophenones), antioxidants (i.e. hindered<br>
phenols), fillers (i.e. calcium carbonate, silica, titanium dioxide, etc.),<br>
plasticizers, rheological additives, and mixtures thereof. Preferred synthetic<br>
adhesive layers contain light absorbers, light stabilizers, and antioxidants.<br>
As discussed in US Patents 5,316,848 and 5,496,615, the adhesion to<br>
post cast concrete is improved when the synthetic adhesive layer 14 has a<br>
penetration greater than about 30 decimillimeters (dmm) (150 g, 5 sec., 70°F)<br>
as measured according to ASTM D 5-73, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The "adhesive" nature of the synthetic pressure sensitive adhesive 14 has the<br>
added benefit in that side laps and end laps of the membrane 10 are easily<br>
formed. The average thickness of the synthetic adhesive layer may be 10-150<br>
mils, more preferably 20-100 mils, with 50-100 mils being most preferred.<br>
In preferred membranes and methods of the invention, the shaped<br>
waterproofing membrane 10 further comprises a protective coating layer 16 to<br>
decrease tack and to protect the adhesive 14 from dust, dirt and the elements<br>
(particularly sunlight). At the same time, the protective layer 16 does not<br>
defeat the ability of the membrane 10 to form a fully adhered strong bond<br>
with post cast concrete. The protective coating layer 16 may comprise, for<br>
example, a polymer coating, a layer of particulate matter, or a mixture thereof.<br>
Exemplary polymer coatings may comprise sytrene butadiene rubber based<br>
(SBR) coatings, carboxylated SBR based coatings, acrylic based coatings (e.g.,<br>
an acrylate), polyvinylidene chloride based (PVDC) coatings, polyvinyl<br>
chloride based (PVC) coatings, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer based (EVA)<br>
coatings, ethylene ethyl acetate copolymer based (EEA) coatings,<br>
polychloroprene based coatings, polyester based coatings, polyurethane<br>
based coatings, styrene-isoprene-styrene based (SIS) coatings, styrenebutadiene-<br>
styrene based (SBS) coatings, styrene-ethylene butylene-styrene<br>
based (SEBS) coatings, or a mixture thereof.<br>
Preferred protective coating layers 16 are acrylic based coatings, and<br>
most preferred are styrene butylacrylate based coatings. Protective layers 16<br>
which are elastomeric in nature are preferred. As used herein, the term<br>
"elastomeric" means and refers to an elastic polymer having a property<br>
similar to those of vulcanized natural rubber; namely, to stretch when pulled<br>
and to retract rapidly to approximately original length when released.<br>
Elastomeric acrylic based coatings are preferred, and elastomeric styrene<br>
butylacrylate based coatings are most preferred. The average thickness of the<br>
protective layer 16 may be anywhere from 1-80 mils, and more preferably 5-60<br>
mils.<br>
The protective layer 16 may optionally contain typical additives and<br>
have a penetration value similar to those described for the pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesive layer 14 described above. Protecting layers 16 made from polymeric<br>
materials (e.g., butyl acrylate) preferably include titanium dioxide or zinc<br>
oxide for protection from sunlight, as well as fillers (e.g., talc, calcium<br>
carbonate, sand, slate dust) to enhance scuffing- and abrasion-resistance.<br>
As just mentioned, the protective layer 16 may comprise inorganic<br>
particles which are roll pressed onto the waterproofing adhesive layer 14<br>
(where no polymer protective coating is used) and/or mixed into the a<br>
polymer protective coating 16 material. A number of particulate materials<br>
believed suitable for this purpose are catalogued in US Patent 5,496,615 of<br>
Bartlett et al. and US Patent 6,500,520 of Wiercinski and Seth, as previously<br>
referenced above. For example, Bartlett et al. disclosed particles of calcium<br>
carbonate, cement, talc, sand, granite dust, slate dust, clay, titanium dioxide,<br>
and carbon black; while Wiercinski and Seth disclosed particles of aluminum<br>
oxide trihydrate, silica dioxide, fly ash, blast furnace slag, silica fume, alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal nitrites, nitrates, halides, sulfates, hydroxides,<br>
carboxylates, silicates, aluminate, or mixtures thereof. Combinations of such<br>
particles (e.g., calcium carbonate and talc) are also contemplated.<br>
Thus, the protective coating 16 layer may be made of a polymeric<br>
coating applied as a liquid and allowedTo dry; may be made of a mixture of<br>
polymeric coating material having particulates and/or other additives<br>
incorporated into the polymer; or may be made solely of particles that are<br>
applied by rolling them onto and embedding the particles entirely or partially<br>
into the outer adhesive layer 14 and/or outer polymer coating layer 16.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, an exemplary shaped waterproofing membrane 10<br>
preferably has a three-dimensional contour 11 such as as a dome, surrounded<br>
partially or entirely by a flat collar portion 13. The flat collar portion 13 has<br>
edges (such as designated at 15) which are preferably straight in nature to<br>
permit a waterproofing tape to be used conveniently to provide a water-tight<br>
seam with "sheet-form" (i.e., conventional reverse tanking) waterproofing<br>
membranes on the formwork or other substrate surface.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, an exemplary supporting structure 30 has a<br>
corresponding dome shape 31 also is entirely or partially surrounded by a flat<br>
collar portion 33 useful for fastening the structure 30 onto a formwork or<br>
other mounting surface. The support structure 30 may be thermoformed or<br>
stamped from a thermoplastic sheet material, such as ABS high impact<br>
polystyrene, poly(vinyl) chloride, polypropylene polyethylene, and others.<br>
The support structure may also be made from sheet metal such as steel, (e.g.,<br>
stainless) aluminum, copper, tin, or other metals. Many of these metals can be<br>
thermoformed or stamped into shape relatively conveniently. The average<br>
thickness of the support structure 30 is about 10-200 mils and more preferably<br>
20-100 mils. While various thermoplastics may be used, such as polyvinyl<br>
chloride (PVC), some materials such as high density polyethylene, while<br>
thermoformable, may require extra thickness in order to withstand the force<br>
of post cast concrete, and this extra thickness may present manufacturing<br>
difficulties during thermoforming because the added thickness will require<br>
higher melting temperatures or longer dwell time (in a heated mold) to soften<br>
the plastic, and this could lead to excessive heating and scorching of the<br>
material. Thus, preferred thickness will often depend upon the choice of<br>
material.<br>
The thermoplastic material used for the support structure 30 should<br>
ideally withstand nails, staples, or other fasteners being driven through the<br>
flat collar portion to secure the structure to formwork. This does not rule out<br>
using brittle materials which shatter, however, because such materials can<br>
also be attached using alternative means (e.g., adhesives, drilled holes, etc.).<br>
In addition to dome or hemispherical shapes, other thermof ormed or stamped<br>
three-dimensional shapes such as cylinders, boxes, pyramids, etc., can be<br>
employed, but dome shapes are preferred because they are least vulnerable to<br>
distortion or twisting caused by the wet concrete or mortar cast against the<br>
membrane-covered 10 supporting structure 30. Furthermore, a rounded<br>
shape provides better flow of the concrete around the support structure (30),<br>
thus better enabling the consolidation of the concrete, and improving or<br>
ensuring bonding between the concrete and support structure (30). It is<br>
preferable to have fewer sharp edges or creases which may lead to<br>
weaknesses in the surrounding concrete.<br>
Although the support structure 30 (dome) may be filled with material,<br>
such as a polyurethane foam or mortar cement, to resist collapsing under the<br>
weight of concrete, it is believed that the thickness of the support material and<br>
the material chosen (e.g., synthetic polymer, metal, or combination thereof)<br>
may be such as to allow the support structure 30 by itself, without filling its<br>
cavity, to support the weight of post cast concrete. Nevertheless, for<br>
extremely large formwork installations, wherein pressures of huge volumetric<br>
amounts of post cast concrete are involved, it may be necessary to fill dome<br>
structures 30 particularly at the bottom of the f ormwork where pressures may<br>
be greatest, but this can be conveniently accomplished such as by drilling a<br>
small hole in an installed dome, filling the dome through the hole with<br>
material (e.g., polyurethane foam which becomes rigid), and then sealing the<br>
hole with two-sided PREPRUFE® tape.<br>
In preferred methods of the invention, the supporting structure 30 is<br>
molded using the same mold as used for providing the three-dimensional<br>
contour in the shaped waterproofing membrane 10 (to be further described<br>
below). "<br>
The supportive dome structure 30, which similarly has a three dimensional<br>
contour portion 32 surrounded entirely or partially by a flat<br>
collar portion 34, serves not only to support the shaped waterproofing<br>
membrane 10 when it is installed over a tieback 40 or other surface detail, but<br>
also serves for protecting the similarly shaped membrane 10 during shipment.<br>
For example, the supportive dome structure 30 can be placed into a box<br>
situated on the outer first face of the membrane 10 to protect the adhesive side<br>
of the membrane (i.e., the rigid dome is placed over the soft dome), and thus<br>
the shaped membrane 10 is "tucked under the hat," so to speak. At the<br>
construction site, the order is reversed, with the supportive dome structure 30<br>
being fitted over the tieback and fastened onto the formwork 40 or other<br>
substrate surface by nails or other fasteners driven through the flat collar<br>
portion 34 and into the underlying formwork, and then this is followed by<br>
fitting the shaped waterproofing membrane 10 over the dome support 30.<br>
The membrane 10 can be attached it to the supporting dome structure 30<br>
and/or surrounding formwork or adjacent conventional membranes by any<br>
means known, such as by using a conventional mastic or other adhesive.<br>
It is envisioned that shaped membranes 10 with domes 30 of<br>
corresponding size can be packaged together as sets, much in the manner of<br>
stacking identically shaped hats or bowls. Moreover, such<br>
membrane/support sets can be variously sized (in the manner of stainless<br>
steel salad bowl sets) for situations wherein various-sized tiebacks or other<br>
surface irregularities are encountered.<br>
Accordingly, in a further exemplary embodiment, a plurality of shaped<br>
waterproofing membranes 10 are fitted with correspondingly shaped support<br>
structures 30 within the same packaging (e.g., shipping) carton or box, similar<br>
to the way in which dispensable paper drinking cups are sold stacked<br>
together in packaging. Preferably, each shaped membrane 10 is fitted into its<br>
corresponding support structure 30, and this "set" can be fitted within<br>
another "set" and thus easily removed from the packaging carton, one set at a<br>
time, as the need dictates. Moreover, the ability to stack the "shap'ect"<br>
membranes allows them to be conveniently shipped or transported alongside<br>
the "sheet-form" membranes with which they will be used for typical reverse<br>
tanking applications. For example, a shipment of both "shaped" and "sheetform"<br>
(conventional) membranes (supplied in roll form in carton) can be<br>
bundled together (such as by using plastic wrapping, binding materials, etc)<br>
for transport the cartons together conveniently to the construction site.<br>
Alternatively, rigid domes (or other three-dimensional shapes) can be<br>
used as the waterproofing membranes themselves, such as by first stamping<br>
or thermoforming a rigid sheet into the desired three-dimensional shape (e.g.,<br>
dome or pyramid surrounded by one or more collar portions or flanges), and<br>
subsequently this structure is coated or layered with a coating for bonding to<br>
fresh concrete. For example, the coating may comprise rubberized asphalt, a<br>
synthetic polymer adhesive (e.g., SIS, SEES, acrylic, polyurethane, etc.), a clay<br>
based adhesive (e.g., bentonite, smectite), or mixture thereof.<br>
The outer edges 15 of the shaped waterproofing membrane 10 are<br>
preferably straight so that the membrane can be conveniently overlapped<br>
with those of a conventional reverse tanking waterproofing membrane.<br>
Furthermore, the shaped membrane 10 (Fig. 3) and conventional membranes<br>
installed onto the formwork (See e.g., Fig. 1 PRIOR ART) can be seamed<br>
together by using two-sided reverse tanking tape (e.g., Grace PREPRUFE<br>
tape) to provide a continuous barrier between and around the area<br>
surrounding the tieback 40.<br>
In further exemplary embodiments of the invention, it is possible to<br>
provide a membrane that combines the properties of both the shaped<br>
membrane 10 and support structure 30, such as by coating the waterproofing<br>
adhesive layer 14 directly onto a rigid three-dimensional contour surrounded<br>
entirely or partially by a flat collar portion, followed by optionally coating a<br>
protective coating layer onto the adhesive layer. This method is less desirable<br>
than thermoforming a single laminate because it would be more timeconsuming<br>
to make (at the plant) or "assemble (at the construction site).<br>
In this connection, the present inventors believe that it will be most<br>
convenient for applicators to fasten a thermoformed dome support 30 in place<br>
over the tieback (e.g., by mailing the flat collar portion into the formwork);<br>
and then to cover the support dome with a correspondingly "shaped"<br>
waterproofing membrane 10 that is easily sealed with 'sheet-form"<br>
(conventional) reverse tanking membranes: using just four strips of tape. The<br>
installation time is estimated to only a few minutes, from removal of the<br>
pieces from the shipping carton. This is far less than what is required by<br>
present industry practice as earlier described in the background.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to the provision of a unified<br>
waterproofing barrier by providing a shaped waterproofing membrane 10,<br>
and relates to a well as the method for constructing such unified barriers on<br>
building and civil engineering surfaces using the shaped membrane 10 in<br>
combination with "sheet-form" (conventional) reverse tanking membranes.<br>
With this distinction between conventional "sheet-form" and "shaped"<br>
reverse tanking membranes in place, an exemplary method of the invention<br>
comprises: providing at least one "sheet-form" waterproofing membrane<br>
comprising a carrier support sheet with first and second opposed major faces,<br>
and, disposed over a first major face thereof, a pressure-sensitive adhesive<br>
layer operative to bond with post cast concrete; and providing at least one<br>
"shaped" waterproofing membrane (e.g., Fig. 3) comprising a carrier support<br>
sheet 10 having first and second opposed major faces, and, disposed over a<br>
first major face thereof, a pressure-sensitive waterproofing adhesive layer 14<br>
operative to bond with post cast concrete, the shaped membrane having a<br>
three-dimensional contour 11 surrounded (entirely or partially) by a flat collar<br>
portion 13 operative to overlap and form seams with the at least one sheetform<br>
waterproofing membrane.<br>
Preferably, both the sheet-form and shaped waterproofing membranes<br>
further comprise a protective coating layer 16, such as an elastomeric<br>
polymeric coating and/or a particle layer. More preferably, the carrier<br>
support sheet 12, adhesive layer 14, and protective layer 16 of the shaped<br>
membrane 10 are thermoformed together as a single piece laminate.<br>
In further exemplary methods, a support structure 30, preferably<br>
molded from the same mold used for thermoforming the shaped<br>
waterproofing membrane 10, is first installed onto a formwork or other<br>
mounting surface, so that the shaped membrane can be positioned over the<br>
installed support structure 30.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates another exemplary shaped waterproofing membrane<br>
50 of the invention which is installed around a penetration 60 (e.g., pipe) in<br>
the building or civil construction surface 62. In this case, the threedimensional<br>
contour 51 is cylindrically shaped and surrounded by a flat collar<br>
portion 53 molded from the same sheet material. The outer surface of the<br>
cylinder 51 and upper face of the flat collar portion 53 are covered by a<br>
waterproofing pressure sensitive adhesive and optional protective coating<br>
(similar to the layers illustrated in magnified view in Fig. 3). The flat collar<br>
portion 53 has preferably straight edges (as designated at 55) to provide quick<br>
seaming, using conventional two-sided reverse tanking tape (e.g.,<br>
PREPRUFE® brand), with "sheet-form" (conventional) reverse tanking<br>
membranes (not shown) that may be installed on the substrate surface 62.<br>
In a further exemplary embodiment, the cylinder form 51 can be<br>
replaced by a cone shape. The top of the cone can be cut at the desired cone<br>
height to achieve an opening diameter corresponding to the diameter or size<br>
of the object (pipe 60, pile cap, etc.) to be waterproofed. The use of the threedimensional<br>
cylinder shape 51 (Fig. 4) or cone shape will also save<br>
considerable labor at the construction site, because the waterproofing<br>
membrane 50 would require<br>
The foregoing embodiments and illustrations are provided for<br>
