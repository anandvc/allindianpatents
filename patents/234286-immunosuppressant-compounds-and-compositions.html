IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Number 60/471,931 (filed 19 May 2003) and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Number 60/562,182 (filed 14 April 2004), The full disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention provides a novel class of immunosuppressant compounds useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases or disorders mediated by lymphocyte interactions, particularly diseases associated with EDG receptor mediated signal transduction.<br>
Background<br>
EDG receptors belong to a family of closely related, lipid activated G-protein coupled receptors. EDG-1, EDG-3, EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8 (also respectively termed S1P1, S1P3, S1P2, S1P4, and S1P5) are identified as receptors specific for sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP). EDG2, EDG4, and EDG7 (also termed LPA1, LPA2, and LP A3, respectively) are receptors specific for lysophosphatidic (LPA). Among the SIP receptor isotypes, EDG-1, EDG-3 and EDG-5 are widely expressed in various tissues, whereas the expression of EDG-6 is confined largely to lymphoid tissues and platelets, and that of EDG-8 to the central nervous system. EDG receptors are responsible for signal transduction and are thought to play an important role in cell processes involving cell development, proliferation, maintenance, migration, differentiation, plasticity and apoptosis. Certain EDG receptors are associated with diseases mediated by lymphocyte interactions, for example, in transplantation rejection, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases and cancer. An alteration in EDG receptor activity contributes to the pathology and/or<br><br>
symptomology of these diseases. Accordingly, molecules that themselves alter the activity of EDG receptors are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of such diseases.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application relates to compounds of Formula I:<br>
in which: <br><br><br>
R25 R3, R4 and R5 are independently chosen from hydrogen, Ci-ealkyi, halo, hydroxy, Ci^alkoxy, halo-substituted Ci^alkyl and halo-substituted C1-6-alkoxy; and the INT-oxide derivatives, prodrug derivatives, protected derivatives, individual isomers and mixtures of isomers thereof; and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates (e.g. hydrates) of such compounds.<br>
A second aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition which contains a compound of Formula I or an N-oxide derivative, individual isomer or mixture of isomers thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in admixture with one or more suitable excipients.<br>
A third aspect of the invention is a method for treating a disease in an animal in<br>
which alteration of EDG receptor mediated signal transduction can prevent, inhibit or<br>
ameliorate the pathology and/or symptomology of the disease, which method comprises<br>
administering to the animal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I<br>
or  a  N-oxide  derivative,   individual  isomer  or  mixture   of isomers   thereof;   or  a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
A fourth aspect of the invention is the use of a compound of Formula I in the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for treating a disease in an animal in which alteration of EDG<br>
receptor mediated signal transduction contributes to the pathology and/or symptomology of<br>
the disease.<br>
A fifth aspect of the invention is a process for preparing compounds of Formula I<br>
and the N-oxide derivatives, prodrug derivatives, protected derivatives, individual isomers<br>
and mixtures of isomers thereof; and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention provides compounds that are useful in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases or disorders mediated by lymphocyte interactions. Also provided are methods for treating such diseases or disorders.<br>
Definitions<br>
In this specification, unless otherwise defined:<br>
"Alkyl" as a group and as a structural element of other groups, for example halo-substituted-alkyl, alkoxy, acyl, alkylthio, alkylsulfonyl and alkylsulfinyl, can be either<br><br>
straight-chained or branched. "Alkenyl" as a group and as a structural element of other groups contains one or more carbon-carbon double bonds, and can be either straight-chain, or branched. Any double bonds can be in the cis- or trans- configuration. "Alkynyl" as a group and as structural element of other groups and compounds contains at least one C =C triple bond and can also contain one or more C=C double bonds, and can, so far as possible, be either straight-chain or branched. Any cycloalkyl group, alone or as a structural element of other groups can contain from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably from 3 to 6 carbon atoms. "Alkylene" and "alkenylene" are divalent radicals derived from "alkyl" and "alkenyl" groups, respectively. In this application, any alkyl group of R1 can be optionally interrupted by a member of the group selected from -S-, -S(O)-, ~S(O)2-, -NR20- and -O- (wherein R20 is hydrogen or C1-6alkyl). These groups include -CH2-O-CH2-, -CH2-S(O)2-CH2- -(CH2)2-NR20-CH2- -CH2-O-(CH2)2-, and the like.<br>
"Aryl" means a monocyclic or fused bicyclic aromatic ring assembly containing six to ten ring carbon atoms. For example, C6-12aryl can be phenyl, biphenyl or naphthyl, preferably phenyl. A fused bicyclic ring can be partially saturated, for example, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalene, and the like. "Arylene" means a divalent radical derived from an aryl group. For example, arylene as used in this application can be phenylene, biphenylene, naphthylene and the like.<br>
"Halo" or "halogen" means F, CI, Br or I, preferably F or CI. Halo-substituted alkyl groups and compounds can be partially halogenated or perhalogenated, whereby in the case of multiple halogenation, the halogen substituents can be identical or different. A preferred perhalogenated alkyl group is for example trifluoromethyl or trifluoromethoxy.<br>
"Heteroaryl" means aryl, as defined in this application, with the addition of at least one heteroatom moiety selected from N, O or S, and each ring is comprised of 5 to 6 ring atoms, unless otherwise stated. For example, C2heteroaryl includes oxadiazole, triazole, and the like. C^eteroaryl includes quinoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline, and the like. C2-9heteroaryl as used in this application includes thienyl, pyridinyl, furanyl, isoxazolyl, benzoxazolyl or benzo[l,3]dioxolyl, preferably thienyl, furanyl or pyridinyl. "Heteroarylene" means heteroaryl, as defined in this application, provided that the ring assembly comprises a divalent radical. A fused bicyclic heteroaryl ring system can be<br><br>
partially saturated, for example, 2,3-dihydro-lH-isoindole, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline, and the like.<br>
As used in the present invention, an EDG-1 selective compound (agent or modulator) has a specificity that is selective for EDG-1 over EDG-3 and over one or more of EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8. As used herein, selectivity for one EDG receptor (a "selective receptor") over another EDG receptor (a "non-selective receptor") means that the compound has a much higher potency in inducing activities mediated by the selective EDG receptor (e.g., EDG-1) than that for the non-selective SIP-specific EDG receptor. If measured in a GTP-yS binding assay (as described in the Example below), an EDG-1 selective compound typically has an EC50 (effective concentration that causes 50% of the maximum response) for a selective receptor (EDG-1) that is at least 5,10,25, 50,100, 500, or 1000 fold lower than its EC50 for a non-selective receptor (e.g., one or more of EDG-3, EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8).<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention provides compounds that are useful for treating or preventing diseases or disorders that are mediated by lymphocyte interactions. In one embodiment, for compounds of Formula I, Ri is phenyl, naphthyl, furanyl or thienyl optionally substituted by Ce-ioarylCo^alkyl, C2-9heteroarylCo^alkyl, C3-8cycloalkylCo-4alkyl, C3-8heterocycloalkylCo-4alkyl or d-6alkyl; wherein any aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl group of Ri can be optionally substituted by one to five radicals chosen from halo, Chalky!, Ci^alkoxy, halo-substituted-Ci-ealkyl andhalo-substituted-Ci-6alkoxy; and any alkyl group of Ri can optionally have a methylene replaced by an atom or group chosen from -S-, -S(O)-, -S(0)2-, -NR7- and -0-; wherein R7 is hydrogen or Ci_6alkyl.<br>
In another embodiment, Y is chosen from phenyl and benzpoxazolyl; and X is a bond or is chosen from -X1OX2- and C^heteroarylene; wherein Xi and X2 are independently chosen from a bond and Cualkylene; wherein any heteroarylene of X is optionally substituted by a member of the group chosen from halo and Ci_6alkyL<br>
In another embodiment, R1 is chosen from:<br><br><br><br>
[l,3,4]oxadiazol-2-yl]-13-dihydrO"isoindol-2-yl}-propionicacid, 3-[2-(2-trifluoromethyl-<br>

Further preferred compounds are also shown in the examples and table 1, infra.<br>
The invention provides forms of the compound that have the hydroxyl or amine group present in a protected form; these function as prodrugs. Prodrugs are compounds that are converted into an active drug form after administration, through one or more chemical or biochemical transformations. Forms of the compounds of the present invention that are readily converted into the claimed compound under physiological conditions are prodrugs of the claimed compounds and are within the scope of the present invention. Examples of prodrugs include forms where a hydroxyl group is acylated to form a relatively labile ester such as an acetate ester, and forms where an amine group is acylated with the carboxylate group of glycine or an L-amino acid such as serine, forming an amide bond that is particularly susceptible to hydrolysis by common metabolic enzymes.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can exist in free form or in salt form, e.g. addition salts with inorganic or organic acids. Where hydroxyl groups are present, these groups can also be present in salt form, e.g. an ammonium salt or salts with metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, zinc or magnesium, or a mixture thereof. Compounds of Formula I and their salts in hydrate or solvate form are also part of the invention.<br><br>
When the compounds of Formula I have asymmetric centers in the molecule, various optical isomers are obtained. The present invention also encompasses enantiomers, racemates, diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Moreover, when the compounds of Formula I include geometric isomers, the present invention embraces cis-compounds, trans-compounds and mixtures thereof. Similar considerations apply in relation to starting materials exhibiting asymmetric carbon atoms or unsaturated bonds as mentioned above.<br>
Methods and Pharmaceutical Compositions for Treating Immunomodulatory Conditions<br>
The compounds of Formula I in free form or in pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt form, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, e.g. lymphocyte recirculation modulating properties, for example, as indicated by the in vitro and in vivo tests of Example 3 and are therefore indicated for therapy. Compounds of Formula I preferably show an EC50 in the range of 1 x 10"n to 1 x 10"5 M, preferably less than 50nM. The compounds exhibit selectivity for one or more EDG/S1P receptors, preferably EDG-1/S1P-1. EDG-1/S1P-1 , selective modulators of the present invention can be identified by assaying a compound's binding to EDG-1/S1P-1 and one or more of the other EDG/S1P receptors (e.g., EDG-3/S1P-3, EDG-5/S1P-2, EDG-6/S1P-4, and EDG-8/S1P-5). An EDG-1/S1P-1 selective modulator usually has an EC50 for the EDG-1/S1P-1 receptor in the range of 1 x lO"^11 to 1 x 10~5 M, preferably less than 50 nM, more preferably less than 5 nM. It also has an EC50 for one or more of the other EDG/S1P receptors that is at least 5,10,25, 50,100, 500, or 1000 fold higher than its EC50 for EDG-1/S1P-1. Thus, some of the EDG-1/S1P-1 modulatory compounds will have an EC50 for EDG-1/S1P-1 that is less than 5 nM while their EC50 for one or more of the other EDG/S1P receptors are at least 100 nM or higher. Other than assaying binding activity to the EDG/S1P receptors, EDG-1/S1P-1 selective agents can also be identified by examining a test agent's ability to modify a cellular process or activity mediated by an EDG/S1P receptor.<br>
The compounds of formula I are, therefore, useful in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases or disorders mediated by lymphocytes interactions, for example in transplantation, such as acute or chronic rejection of cell, tissue or organ alio- or xenografts or delayed graft function, graft versus host disease, autoimmune diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, hashimoto's thyroidis, multiple sclerosis,<br><br>
myasthenia gravis, diabetes type I or II and the disorders associated therewith, vasculitis, pernicious anemia, Sjoegren syndrome, uveitis, psoriasis, Graves ophthalmopathy, alopecia areata and others, allergic diseases, e.g. allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis, allergic contact dermatitis, inflammatory diseases optionally with underlying aberrant reactions, e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, intrinsic asthma, inflammatory lung injury, inflammatory liver injury, inflammatory glomerular injury, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, irritant contact dermatitis and further eczematous dermatitises, seborrhoeic dermatitis, cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated disorders, inflammatory eye disease, keratoconjunctivitis, myocarditis or hepatitis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, gut ischemia, renal failure or hemorrhage shock, traumatic shock, T cell lymphomas or T cell leukemias, infectious diseases, e.g. toxic shock (e.g. superantigen induced), septic shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome or viral infections, e.g. AIDS, viral hepatitis, chronic bacterial infection, or senile dementia. Examples of cell, tissue or solid organ transplants include e.g. pancreatic islets, stem cells, bone marrow, corneal tissue, neuronal tissue, heart, lung, combined heart-lung, kidney, liver, bowel, pancreas, trachea or oesophagus. For the above uses the required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula I are useful in cancer chemotherapy, particularly for cancer chemotherapy of solid tumors, e.g. breast cancer, or as an anti-angiogenic agent.<br>
The required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. In general, satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of from about 0.03 to 2.5 mg/kg per<br>
I     body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g. humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise from ca. 1 to 50 mg active ingredient.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be administered by any conventional route, in<br>
3     particular enterally, for example, orally, e.g. in the form of tablets or capsules, or<br>
parenterally, for example, in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions, topically, e.g. in<br><br>
the form of lotions, gels, ointments or creams, or in a nasal or a suppository form. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in association with at least one pharmaceutical acceptable carrier or diluent can be manufactured in conventional manner by mixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be administered in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, for example, as indicated above. Such salts can be prepared in a conventional manner and exhibit the same order of activity as the free compounds.<br>

The latter also applies to cocktail therapy, e.g. the administration of 3 or more active ingredients.<br>
Methods for Preparing Compounds of the Invention<br>
The present invention also includes processes for the preparation of immunomodulatory compounds of the invention. In the reactions described, it can be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups can be used in accordance with standard practice, for example, see T.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley and Sons, 1991.<br><br>
Compounds of Formula I can be prepared by proceeding as in the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
in which n, X, Ri, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined for Formula I above. Compounds of Formula I can be prepared sequentially by treating a compound of formula 2 with a suitable acid (e.g. TFA, and the like), reacting with *-butyl acrylate in the presence of a suitable amine (e.g. DIEA, and the like) and removing the f-butyl protecting group with a suitable acid (e.g. TFA, and the like). The reaction proceeds at a temperature of about 0 to about 120°C and can take up to about 24 hours to complete.<br>
Additional Processes for Preparing Compounds of the Invention:<br>
A compound of the invention can be prepared as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt by reacting the free base form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid. Alternatively, a pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt of a compound of the invention can be prepared by reacting the free acid form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic base. Alternatively, the salt forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared using salts of the starting materials or intermediates.<br>
The free acid or free base forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared from the corresponding base addition salt or acid addition salt from, respectively. For example a compound of the invention in an acid addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free base by treating with a suitable base (e.g., ammonium hydroxide solution, sodium hydroxide, and the like). A compound of the invention in abase addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free acid by treating with a suitable acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, etc.).<br><br>
Compounds of the invention in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-oxides of compounds of the invention by treating with a reducing agent (e.g., sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, tribromide, or the like) in a suitable inert organic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like) at 0 to 80°C.<br>
Prodrug derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., for further details see Saulnier et al., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985). For example, appropriate prodrugs can be prepared by reacting a non-derivatized compound of the invention with a suitable carbamylating agent (e.g., 1,1-acyloxyalkylcarbanochloridate, para-nitrophenyl carbonate, or the like).<br>
Protected derivatives of the compounds of the invention can be made by means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal can be found in T W. Greene, "Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry", 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1999.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared, or formed during the process of the invention, as solvates (e.g., hydrates).   Hydrates of compounds of the present invention can be conveniently prepared by recrystallization from an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents such as dioxin, tetrahydrofuran or methanol.<br>
Compounds of the invention can be prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to forma pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers can be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds of the invention, dissociable complexes are preferred (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and can be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities.   The diastereomers can be separated by chromatography, or preferable, by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more<br><br>
detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from the their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions", John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981.<br>
In summary, the compounds of Formula I can be made by a process, which involves:<br>
(a)	the above reaction scheme; and<br>
(b)	optionally converting a compound of the invention into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt;<br>

Example 3 Compounds of Formula I Exhibit Biological Activity<br><br>
A, In vitro: GPCR activation assay measuring GTP Tv- SI binding to membranes prepared from CHO cells expressing human EDG receptors<br>
EDG-1 (SIPi) GTP [y-  S] binding assay: Homogenized membranes are prepared from CHO cell clones stably expressing a human EDG-1 N-terminal c-myc tag. Cells are grown in suspension in two 850 cm2 roller bottles for three or fours days before harvesting. The cells are centrifuged down, washed once with cold PBS, and resuspended in ^0 ml of Buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,10 mM EDTA, EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail [1 tablet/25 ml]). The cell suspension is homogenized on ice, using a Polytron homogenizer at 30000 rpm at three intervals of 15 seconds each. The homogenate is first centrifuged at 2000 rpm on a tabletop low speed centrifuge for 10 minutes. The supernatant, after passing through a cell strainer, is then re-centrifuged at 50,000 x g for 25 minutes at 4°C. The pellet is resuspended into buffer B (15% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,0.1 mM EDTA, EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail [1 tablet/10 ml]). Protein concentration of the prep is determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce) using BSA as standard. The membranes are aliquoted and kept frozen at -80°C.<br>
Solutions of test compounds ranging from lOmM to O.OlnM are prepared in DMSO. SIP is diluted in 4% BSA solution as positive controls. The desired amount of membrane prep is diluted with ice-cold assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 % Fatty acid-free BSA, 5 \xM GDP) and vortexed well.   2 jal or less of compound is distributed into each well of a round-bottom 96-well polystyrene assay plate, followed by addition of 100 \xl of diluted membranes (3-10 ^ig/well) and kept on ice until the addition of hot GTPyS. [35S]-GTPyS is diluted 1:1000 (v/v) with cold assay buffer and 100 |il is added into each well. The reaction is carried out at room temperature for 90 minutes before the membranes are harvested onto Perkin-Elmer Unifilter® GF/B-96 filter plate using a Packard Filtermate Harvester. After several washes with wash buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2), and a rinse with 95% ethanol, the filter is dried in a 37°C oven for 30 minutes. MicroScint-20 is added and the plate sealed for scintillation counting on TopCount. EC50 values are obtained by fitting the GTP [y- S] binding curves (raw data) with the dose response curve-fitting tool of GraphPad Prism. Six or twelve different concentrations are used to generate a concentration response curve (using three data points per concentration).<br><br>
EDG-3,-5,-6 and -8 GTP [y- S] binding assays are carried out in a comparable manner to the EDG-1 GTP [y-35S] binding assay using membranes from CHO cells stably expressing c-terminal c-myc tagged or untagged receptors. For each membrane preparation, titration experiments are first run with SIP control to determine the optimal amount of membranes to be added per assay well. Compounds of the invention were tested according to the above assay and were observed to exhibit selectivity for the EDG-1 receptor. For<br>
example, 3-[6-(4»cyclohexyl-3-trifluoromethyl-benzyloxy)-3,4-dihydro-lH-isoquinolin-2-yl]-propionic acid (compound 9) has an EC50 of 0.2 nM in the above assay and is at least 1000 fold selective for EDG-1 compared to one or more of the other receptors including EDG-3, EDG-5, EDG-6 and EDG-8.<br>
B.	In vitro: FLIPR calcium flux assay<br>
Compounds of the invention are tested for agonist activity on EDG-1, EDG-3, EDG-5, and EDG-6 with a FLIPR calcium flux assay. Briefly, CHO cells expressing an EDG receptor are maintained in F-12K medium (ATCC), containing 5% FBS, with 500ug/ml of G418. Prior to the assay, the cells are plated in 384 black clear bottom plates at the density of 10,000 cells/well/25|al in the medium of F-12K containing 1% FBS. The second day, the cells are washed three times (25 jal/each) with washing buffer. About 25 jal of dye are added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and 5% CO2. The cells are then washed four times with washing buffer (25 jil/each). The calcium flux is assayed after adding 25 \xl of SEQ2871 solution to each well of cells. The same assay is performed with cells expressing each of the different EDG receptors. Titration in the FLIPR calcium flux assay is recorded over a 3-minute interval, and quantitated as maximal peak height percentage response relative to EDG-1 activation.<br>
C.	In vivo: Screening Assays for measurement of blood lymphocyte depletion and<br>
assessment of heart effect<br>
Measurement of circulating lymphocytes: Compounds are dissolved in DMSO and diluted to obtain a final concentration of 4% DMSO (v/v, final concentration) and then further diluted in a constant volume of Tween80 25%/H20, v/v. Tween80 25%/H20 (200 \il), 4% DMSO, and FTY720 (lOjig) are included as negative and positive controls,<br><br>
respectively. Mice (C57bl/6 male, 6-10 week-old) are administered 250-300 ^iL of compound solution orally by gavages under short isoflurane anesthesia.<br>
Blood is collected from the retro-orbital sinus 6 and 24 hours after drug administration under short isoflurane anesthesia. Whole blood samples are subjected to hematology analysis. Peripheral lymphocyte counts are determined using an automated analyzer. Subpopulations of peripheral blood lymphocytes are stained by fluorochrome-conjugated specific antibodies and analyzed using a fluorescent activating cell sorter (Facscalibur). Two mice are used to assess the lymphocyte depletion activity of each compound screened. The result is an ED50, which is defined as the effective dose required displaying 50 % of blood lymphocyte depletion. Compounds of the invention were tested according to the above assay and were preferably found to exhibit an ED50 of less than lmg/kg, more preferably an ED50 of less than 0.5 mg/kg. For example, 3-[6-(4-cyclohexyl-3-Mfluoromethyl-benzyloxy)-3,4-dihy&amp;^ 9) exhibits an ED50 of 0.2 mg/kg.<br>
Assessment of Heart Effect: The effects of compounds on cardiac function are monitored using the AnonyMOUSE ECG screening system. Electrocardiograms are recorded in conscious mice (C57bl/6 male, 6-10 week-old) before and after compound administration. ECG signals are then processed and analyzed using the e-MOUSE software. 90 \xg of compound further diluted in 200^1 water, 15% DMSO are injected IP. Four mice are used to assess the heart effect of each compound.<br>
D:       In vivo: Anti-angiogenic Activity<br>
Porous chambers containing (i) sphingosine-1-phosphate (5 jaM/chamber) or (ii) human VEGF (1 jig/chamber) in 0.5 ml of 0.8% w/v agar (containing heparin, 20 U/ml) are implanted subcutaneously in the flank of mice. SIP or VEGF induces the growth of vascularized tissue around the chamber. This response is dose-dependent and can be quantified by measuring the weight and blood content of the tissue. Mice are treated once a day orally or intravenously with a compound of formula I starting 4-6 hours before implantation of the chambers and continuing for 4 days. The animals are sacrificed for measurement of the vascularized tissues 24 hours after the last dose. The weight and blood<br><br>
content of the vascularized tissues around the chamber is determined. Animals treated with a compound of formula I show reduced weight and/or blood content of the vascularized tissues compared to animals treated with vehicle alone. Compounds of Formula I are anti-angiogenic when administered at a dose of about 0,3 to about 3mg/kg.<br>
E:       In vitro: Antitumor Activity<br>
A mouse breast cancer cell line originally isolated from mammary carcinomas is used, e.g. JygMC(A). The cell number is adjusted to 5xl05 for plating in fresh medium before the procedure. Cells are incubated with fresh medium containing 2.5mM of thymidine without FCS for 12 hours and then washed twice with PBS, followed by addition of fresh medium with 10% FCS and additionally incubated for another 12 hours. Thereafter the cells are incubated with fresh medium containing 2,5mM of thymidine without FCS for 12 hours. To release the cells from the block, the cells are washed twice with PBS and replated in fresh medium with 10% FCS. After synchronization, the cells are incubated with or without various concentrations of a compound of formula I for 3,6,9,12,18 or 24 hours. The cells are harvested after treatment with 0,2% EDTA, fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol solution, hydrolyzed with 250Dg/ml of RNaseA (type 1-A: Sigma Chem. Co.) at 37°C for 30 minutes and stained with propidium iodide at lOmg/ml for 20 minutes. After the incubation period, the number of cells is determined both by counting cells in a Coulter counter and by the SRB colorimetric assay. Under these conditions compounds of formula I inhibit the proliferation of the tumor cells at concentrations ranging from 10    to 10  M.<br>
