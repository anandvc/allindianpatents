Description<br>
The invention relates to preparations, in particular preparations for crop protection,<br>
which comprise at least one conazole fungicide, in particular epoxiconazole, and at<br>
least one further active compound.<br>
For application in crop protection and in the protection of materials, it is desirable to<br>
formulate fungicidally active compounds in the form of preparations which can easily be<br>
diluted with water to the low concentration desired for application. In addition to<br>
solvent-containing emulsion concentrates (ECs) in which the active compound is,<br>
together with surfactants, dissolved or suspended in an organic solvent or oil which is<br>
generally not miscible with water, mention may be made of suspension concentrates<br>
(SCs) in which the active compound is present in the form, of a finely divided<br>
suspension together with surfactants. Also known are water-dispersible powders (WP)<br>
and suspoemulsions (SEs) which have at least one first solid active compound phase<br>
and at least one further liquid organic phase which is emulsified/suspended in an<br>
aqueous phase.<br>
In principle, ECs have the disadvantage that they comprise relatively large amounts of<br>
organic solvents which, on the one hand, increases production costs and entails<br>
additional risks during storage and handling. Suspension concentrates for their part<br>
comprise, in contrast to ECs, only small amounts of volatile organic compounds;<br>
however, they have the disadvantage of a lower storage stability, in particular when the<br>
active compounds, such as in the case of epoxiconazole, tend to crystallize.<br>
Suspoemulsions in turn have, in addition to a content of volatile inflammable organic <br>
solvents which cannot be disregarded, the disadvantage that these complex<br>
multiphase systems are thermodynamically unstable, so that, on the one hand, the<br>
storage stability is frequently unsatisfactory and there may be, or is, an uncontrolled<br>
flocculation and formation of a precipitate of organic components on dilution with water.<br>
A further disadvantage of conventional water-dilutable active compound preparations<br>
such as SC, EC and SE is the fact that the active compound particles or active<br>
compound droplets suspended and emulsified, respectively, in the aqueous phase after<br>
dilution of the preparations with water have a relatively large particle size which is<br><br>
generally several µm. However, it is desirable that, after dilution of the formulation with<br>
water to the concentration desired for application, the active compound is present in<br>
the resulting aqueous preparation in a form which is as finely distributed as possible to<br>
ensure, on the one hand, uniform distribution in the formulation and thus better<br>
handling and dosing properties and, at the same time, to increase the bioavailability of<br>
the active compound in the formulation. Here, formulations in which the heterogeneous<br>
phase has mean particle sizes of less than 500 nm are aimed for.<br>
Conazole fungicides are organic active compounds having an imidazole or triazole<br>
group whose fungicidal action is, as is known, based on the inhibition of ergosterol<br>
biosynthesis and which are therefore active against a number of plant-damaging fungi<br>
from the group of the Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes.<br>
Epoxiconazole (common name for rel-1-[[(2R,3S)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)oxiranyl]methyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole), for example, is a more recently<br>
discovered active compound from the group of the azole fungicides.<br>
To broaden their activity spectrum and to increase their fungicidal activity, conazole<br>
fungicides are frequently formulated together with other active compounds. This may<br>
result in problems, in particular if the other active compound only has a low solubility in<br>
water.<br>
WO 03/055944 describes the use of copolymers based on acrylamidomethylpropane-<br>
sulfonic acid (AMPS) as crystallization inhibitor in aqueous suspension concentrates for<br>
crop protection.<br>
The earlier patent application PCT/EP 04/011797 discloses active compound<br>
formulations which comprise at least one active compound and at least one random<br>
copolymer which can be obtained by free-radical polymerization of olefinically<br>
unsaturated sulfonic acids with esters or amides of acrylic acid or of methacrylic acid.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide preparations of conazole<br>
fungicides and in particular of epoxiconazole which are dispersible in water or can be<br>
easily diluted with water without undesirable separatigns taking place. The preparations<br>
should comprise the smallest possible amounts of organic solvents and also ensure<br>
that the active compound is finely distributed in the aqueous phase on dilution. Also<br>
desirable is high storage stability.<br><br>
This object is achieved by a preparation which, in addition to at least one conazole<br>
fungicide (active compound 1), comprises at least one further crop-protection agent 2<br>
which has a solubility in water at 20°C of less than 20 g/l, and at least one copolymer<br>
CP constructed of ethylenically unsaturated monomers M, where the monomers M<br>
constituting the copolymer CP comprise<br>
a) at least one monoethylenically unsaturated monomer M1 which has at least one<br>
sulfonic acid group, and<br>
P) at least one neutral monoethylenically unsaturated monomer M2,<br>
where the ratio of active compound 1 to the at least one further crop protection agent 2<br>
is in the range from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to preparations comprising a mixture of at least two<br>
different crop protection agents, where<br>
a)	at least one active compound is selected from the group of the conazoles (active<br>
compound 1) and<br>
b)	the at least one further crop protection agent (active compound 2) has a solubility<br>
in water at 20°C of less than 20 g/l,<br>
furthermore comprising<br>
c)	at least one copolymer CP constructed of ethylenically unsaturated monomers M,<br>
where the monomers M comprise<br>
a) at least one monoethylenically unsaturated monomer M1 which has at least<br>
one sulfonic acid group, and<br>
(3) at least one neutral monoethylenically unsaturated monomer M2,<br>
where the ratio of active compound 1 to the at least one further crop protection agent 2<br>
is in the range from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
In an advantageous manner, the preparations according to the invention are suitable<br>
for stabilizing mixtures of at least one conazole fungicide, in particular epoxiconazole,<br>
and the active compound in aqueous phase without any organic solvents being<br>
required. In contrast to the suspoemulsions described in the prior art, dilution of the<br>
preparations according to the invention with water affords aqueous formulations in<br>
which epoxiconazole and the at least one further active compound 2 are present in<br>
extremely finely divided or even molecularly dispersed form in the continuous aqueous<br>
phase. It is assumed that the active compounds form aggregates with the copolymers<br>
CP in the aqueous phase. These aggregates generally have mean particle sizes of less<br>
than 500 nm, in particular less than 400 nm, especially less than 300 nm and very<br>
especially less than 200 nm. On dilution of the preparation according to the invention,<br><br>
there are very few, if any, inhomogeneities and instabilities as a result of coagulation,<br>
crystallization, flocculation or sedimentation. In addition, presumably by virtue of the<br>
extremely fine division of the active compounds in the aqueous application form,<br>
corresponding to the very low apparent particle diameter of the active compound<br>
aggregates, the activity of the active compounds is increased compared to<br>
conventional formulations of azole fungicides and in particular of epoxiconazole.<br>
The stated particle sizes are weight-average particle sizes which can be determined by<br>
dynamic light scattering. The person skilled in the art is familiar with methods to<br>
achieve this, for example from H. Wiese in D. Distler, Wassrige Polymerdispersionen<br>
[Aqueous polymer dispersions], Wiley-VCH 1999, chapter 4.2.1, p. 40ff and literature<br>
cited therein, and also H. Auweter, D.Horn, J. Colloid Interf. Sci. 105 (1985) 399,<br>
D. Lilge, D. Horn, Colloid Polym. Sci. 269 (1991) 704 or H. Wiese, D. Horn, J. Chem.<br>
Phys. 94(1991)6429.<br>
As active compound 1, the preparations according to the invention comprise at least<br>
one conazole fungicide (see http://www.hclrss.demon.co.uk/class_fungicides.html). As<br>
is known, the conazole fungicides include certain imidazole compounds, such as<br>
climbazole, clotrimazole, imazalil, oxpoconazole, prochloraz, and triflumizole, and also<br>
certain triazole compounds, such as azaconazole, bromuconazole, cyproconazole,<br>
dichlobutrazole, difenoconazole, diniconazole, epoxiconazole, etaconazole,<br>
fenbuconazole, fluquinconazole, flusilazole, flutriafol, furconazole, hexacohazole,<br>
imibenconazole, ipconazole, metconazole, myclobutanil, penconazole, propiconazole,<br>
prothioconazole, quinconazole, simeconazole, tebuconazole, tetra conazole,<br>
triticonazole, triadimefone, triadimenole and uniconazole. The active compound 1 is in<br>
particular one of the abovementioned triazole compounds, especially cyproconazole,<br>
epoxiconazole, fluquinconazole, hexaconazole, metconazole, penconazole,<br>
propiconazole, prothioconazole, tebuconazole and triticonazole. In a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment, the active compound 1 is epoxiconazole. In another particularly<br>
preferred embodiment the active compound 1 is metconazole.<br>
Furthermore, the active compound preparations according to the invention comprise at<br>
least one, for example 1 or 2, further active compounds 2 which have a solubility in<br>
water at 20°C of less than 20 g/l, in particular less than 10 g/l and especially less than<br>
5g/l. The active compounds 2 are in particular fungicidally active compounds.<br>
However, in principle, they can also be active compounds different from fungicides, for<br>
example insecticides, acaricides, herbicides, nematicides or growth regulators. What is<br><br>
essential is that active compound 1 and active compound 2 are different, that at least<br>
one of the active compounds is a conazole fungicide and that the further active<br>
compound has a solubility in water at 20°C of less than 20 g/l. Suitable, active<br>
compounds 2 are known to the person skilled in the art; see, for example,<br>
http://www.hclrss.demon.co.uk/index.html.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the active compound 2 has a melting point<br>
of less than 70°C (at atmospheric pressure).<br>
Examples of fungicidally active compounds 2 which are preferred according to the<br>
invention are, for example,<br>
strobilurin fungicides, such as azoxystrobin, dimoxystrobin, fluoxastrobin,<br>
kresoxim-methyl, metominostrobin, orysastrobin, picoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin<br>
and trifloxystrobin, in particular pyraclostrobin,<br>
morpholine fungicides, such as aldamorph, benzamorf, carbamorph, dodemorph,<br>
dimethomorph, fenpropimorph, fenpropidin, flumorph and tridemorph,<br>
chlorothalonil,<br>
boscalid,<br>
nonclassified fungicides selected from the group consisting of spiroxamine and<br>
metrafenone,	<br>
and the abovementioned conazole fungicides different from the active compound<br>
1 present in the composition, in particular prochloraz, cyproconazole,<br>
fluquinconazole, hexaconazole, metconazole, penconazole, propiconazole,<br>
prothioconazole, tebuconazole and triticonazole and especially metconazole,<br>
fluquinconazole and prothioconazole.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the active compound 2 is pyraclostrobin. In a<br>
further particularly preferred embodiment, the active compound 2 is one of the<br>
abovementioned conazole fungicides, in particular prochloraz, cyproconazole,<br>
fluquinconazole, hexaconazole, metconazole, penconazole, propiconazole,<br>
prothioconazole, tebuconazole and triticonazole and especially metconazole,<br>
fluquinconazole and prothioconazole.<br>
Especially, active compounds 1 and 2 are a combination of epoxiconazole as active<br>
compound 1 with at least one strobilurin, in particular pyraclostrobin, and, if<br>
appropriate, one further active compound, for example fenpropidin as active<br>
compound(s) 2, or a combination of epoxiconazole as active compound 1 with at least<br><br>
one further conazole fungicide different from epoxiconazole as active compound 2, in<br>
particular a conazole fungicide selected from the group consisting of prochloraz,<br>
cyproconazole, fluquinconazoie, hexaconazo|e, metconazole, penconazole,<br>
propiconazole, prothioconazole, tebuconazole and triticonazole and especially<br>
metconazole, fluquinconazoie and prothioconazole.<br>
A further preferred embodiment relates to preparations which comprise metconazole as<br>
active compound 1 and a strobilurin, in particular pyraclostrobin, as active compound 2.<br>
In the preparations according to the invention, the ratio of conazole fungicide to the at<br>
least one further active compound 2 is preferably in the range from 1:8 to 8:1, in<br>
particular in the range from 5:1 to 1:5 and especially in the range from 1:3 to 3:1.<br>
According to the invention, the preparations comprise at least one copolymer CP which<br>
stabilizes the active compound in the aqueous phase. In general, the preparations<br>
according to the invention comprise the copolymer CP in an amount from 0.1 to 10<br>
parts by weight, in particular from 0.5 to 8 parts by weight, especially from 1 to 5 parts<br>
by weight, based on 1 part by weight of the total amount of active compounds, i.e. the<br>
total amount of active compound 1 and active compound 2 (corresponds to 10 to<br>
1000% by weight, based oh the total amount of active compound 1 and active<br>
compound 2).<br>
The copolymers CP are generally so-called random copolymers, i.e. the monomers M1<br>
and M2 are distributed in a random fashion along the polymer chain. In principle,<br>
alternating copolymers CP and block copolymers CP are also suitable.<br>
According to the invention, the monomers M constituting the copolymer CP comprise at<br>
least one monoethylenically unsaturated monomer M1 having at least one sulfonic acid v<br>
group. The proportion of monomers M1 in the monomers M is generally from 1 to 90% <br>
by weight, frequently from 1 to 80% by weight, in particular from 2 to 70% by weight<br>
and especially from 5 to 60% by weight, based on the total amount of monomers M.<br>
Suitable monomers M1 are, in principle, all monoethylenically unsaturated monomers<br>
having at least one sulfonic acid group. The monomers M1 may be present both in their<br>
acid form and in the salt form. The stated, parts by weight refer to the acid form.<br>
Examples of monomers M1 are styrenesulfonic acid, vinylsulfonic acid, allylsulfonic<br><br>
acid, methallylsulfonic acid, and also the monomers defined by formula I below, and<br>

counterion. Examples of suitable cations are alkali metal cations, such as Na+ or K+,<br>
alkaline earth metal ions, such as Ca2+ and Mg2f, furthermore ammonium ions, such as<br>
NH4+, tetraalkylammonium cations, such as tetramethylammonium,<br>

hexylamine, dodecylamine, oleylamine, stearylamine, ethoxylated oleylamine,<br>
ethoxylated stearylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine or of N,N-<br>
dimethylethanolamine.<br>
In addition to the monomers M1, the monomers M constituting the copolymer CP<br><br>
comprise at least one neutral monoethylenically unsaturated monomer M2. Neutral<br>
means that the monomers M2 have no functional group which is present in ionic form<br>
or reacts acidic or basic in aqueous medium. The total amount of the monomers M2 is<br>
generally from 10 to 99% by weight, frequently from 20 to 99% by weight, in particular<br>
from 30 to 98% by weight and especially from 40 to 95% by weight, based on the total<br>
weight of the monomers M.<br>
Examples of monomers M2 are those with limited solubility in water, for example a<br>
solubility in water of less than 50 g/l and in particular less than 30 g/l (at 20°C and<br>
1013 mbar) and those having an increased solubility in water, for example a solubility<br>
in water of ≥50 g/l, in particular ≥80 g/l (at 20°C and 1013 mbar). Hereinbelow,<br>

In a further preferred embodiment, the monomers M2 are selected from the group<br>

In a second preferred embodiment of the invention, the monomers M2 comprise, in<br>
addition to the monomer M2a, at least one monomer M2b which has a solubility in<br>
water at 20°C of at least 50 g/l and in particular at least 80 g/l. Correspondingly, the<br>
monomers M which constitute the copolymer CP comprise, in addition to the monomer<br>
M1, both at least one of the abovementioned monomers M2a, in particular at least one<br>
of the monomers M2a mentioned as being preferred, and at least one of the<br>
abovementioned monomers M2b, in particular at least one of the monomers M2b<br>
mentioned as being preferred. Such copolymers are novel and also form part of the<br>
subject matter of the present invention.<br>
Frequently, the total amount of monomers M1 + M2b will not exceed 90% by weight, in<br>
particular 80% by weight and especially 70% by weight, based on the total amount of<br>
monomers M, and is, in particular, in the range from 10 to 90% by weight, in particular<br>
in the range from 20 to 80% by weight and especially in the range from 30 to 70% by<br>
weight, based on the total amount of monomers M. Correspondingly, the monomers<br>
M2a frequently make up at least 10% by weight, in particular at least 20% by weight<br>
and especially at least 30% by weight, for example from 10 to 90% by weight, in<br>
particular from 20 to 80% by weight and especially from 30 to 70% by weight, based on<br>
the total amount of monomers M.<br>

preference is given to copolymers CP whose constituting monomers M comprise as<br><br>
monomers M1 at least one monomer of the formula I, as monomers M2a at least one<br>
monomer selected from the group consisting of esters of acrylic acid with C2-C10<br>

In a third preferred embodiment of the invention, the monomers constituting the<br>
copolymer CP comprise, as monomers M2, methyl acrylate or a mixture of methyl<br>
acrylate with at least one of the abovementioned monomers M2b. The amount of<br>
monomers M1, based on the total amount of monomers, is in the ranges mentioned<br>
above and is generally from 1 to 90% by weight, in particular from 2 to 80% by weight<br>
and especially from 5 to 60% by weight. The total amount of methyl acrylate and any<br>

acrylate:monomer M2b is typically in the range from 10:1 to 1:1, in particular from 5:1<br>
to 1.2:1.<br>
In addition, the monomers M constituting the copolymer may comprise further<br>
monomers M3 different from the monomers M1 and M2. The proportion of monomers<br>
M3 in the total amount of monomers M is preferably not more than 40% by weight, in<br>
particular not more than 20% by weight. In a preferred embodiment, the monomers<br>
comprise no or not more than 3% by weight, especially not more than 1% by weight, of<br>
monomers M3 different from the monomers M1 and M2.<br>
The monomers M3 include monoethylenically unsaturated monomers having at least<br>
one carboxylic acid group, in particular monoethylenically unsaturated mono- and<br>
dicarboxylic acids having 3 to 6 carbon atoms (monomers M3a), such as acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, vinylacetic acid, crotonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid<br>
and the like, and the anhydrides of the abovementioned monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
dicarboxylic acids, where the proportion of monomers M3a does generally not exceed<br>
20% by weight and in particular 10% by weight, based on the total amount of<br>

The monomers M3 furthermore include polyethylenically unsaturated monomers (M3b).<br>
The proportion of such monomers M3 will generally not be more than 2% by weight<br><br>

methylenebismethacrylamide.<br>
For the preparations according to the invention, preference is furthermore given to<br>
copolymers CP having a number-average molecular weight Mn in the range from 1000<br>
to 500 000 Dalton, frequently in the range from 1500 to 100 000 Dalton, in particular<br>
from 2000 to 50 000 Dalton and especially from 5000 to 20 000 Dalton. Frequently, the<br>
weight-average molecular weight is in the range from 2000 to 1 000 000 Dalton,<br>
frequently in the range from 3000 to 200 000 Dalton, in particular from 4000 to 100 000<br>
Dalton and especially from 10 000 to 50 000 Dalton. The ratio Mw/Mn is frequently in<br>
the range from 1.1:1 to 10:1, in particular in the range from 1.2:1 to 5:1. The molar<br>
masses Mw and Mn and the nonuniformity of the polymers are determined by size<br>
exclusion chromatography (= gel permeation chromatography or short GPC).<br>
Commercial polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) calibration sets can be used as<br>
calibration material.<br>
In general, the copolymer comprised in the preparations according to the invention will<br>
have a glass transition temperature Tg in the range from -80 to 160°C and frequently in<br>
the range from -40 to +100°C. Here, the glass transition temperature Tg is to be<br>
understood as meaning the "midpoint temperature" determined according to<br>
ASTM D 3418-82 by differential thermal analysis (DSC) (cf. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of<br>
Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Volume A 21, VCH Weinheim 1992, p. 169 and also<br>
Zosel, Farbe und Lack 82 (1976), pp. 125-134, see also DIN 53765).<br>
In this context, it has been found to be helpful to estimate the glass transition<br>
temperature Tg of the copolymer CP with the aid of the equation from Fox (T.G. Fox,<br><br>
Bull. Am. Phys. Soc. (Ser. II) 1, 123 [1956] and Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der<br>
technischen Chemie [Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry], Weinheim<br>
(1980), pp. 17-18) using the glass transition temperature of the respective<br>
homopolymers of the monomers M which constitute the polymer. The latter are known,<br>
for example, from Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, VCH, Weinheim,<br>
Vol. A 21 0992) p. 169 or from J. Brandrup, E.H. Immergut, Polymer Handbook 3rd<br>
ed., J. Wiley, New York 1989.<br>
Some of the copolymers CP comprised in the preparations according to the invention<br>
are known from PCT/EP 04/011797, or they can be prepared by customary methods by<br>
radical polymerization of the monomers M. The polymerization can be carried out by<br>
free-radical polymerization or by controlled radical polymerization methods. The<br>
polymerization can be carried out using one or more initiators and can be carried out as<br>
solution polymerization, as emulsion polymerization, as suspension polymerization or<br>
as precipitation polymerization, or else neat. The polymerization can be carried out as<br>
a batch reaction or in semicontinuous or continuous operation.<br>
The reaction times are generally in the range from 1 to 12 hours. The temperature<br>
range in which the reactions may be carried out is generally from 20 to 200°C,<br>
preferably from 40 to 120°C. The polymerization pressure is of minor importance and<br>
can be in the range from atmospheric pressure or slightly reduced pressure, for<br>
example &gt;800 mbar, or at superatmospheric pressure, for example up to 10 bar, it also<br>
being possible to use higher or lower pressures.<br>
Suitable initiators for the radical polymerization are customary radical-forming<br>
substances. Preference is given to initiators from the group of the azo compounds, the<br>
peroxide compounds or the hydroperoxide compounds. Examples which may be<br>
mentioned are acetyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, tert-butylperoxy<br>
isobutyrate, caproyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile, 2,2'-<br>
azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile), 2,2'-azobis[2-methyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)propionamide],<br>
1,1'-azobis(1-cyclohexanecarbonitrile), 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), 2,2'-<br>
azobis(N,N'-dimethyleneisobutyroamidine). Particular preference is given to<br>
azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN). The initiator is usually employed in an amount of from<br>
0.02 to 5% by weight and in particular from 0.05 to 3% by weight, based on the amount<br>
of monomers M. The optimum amount of initiator depends, of course, on the initiator<br>
system used and can be determined in standard experiments by the person skilled in<br>
the art. Some or all of the initiator may be initially charged in the reaction vessel.<br><br>
Preferably, the major amount of the initiator, in particular at least 80%, for example<br>
from 80 to 100%, of the initiator, is added into the polymerization reactor during the<br>
course of the polymerization.<br>
Of course, the molecular weight of the copolymers CP can be adjusted by adding a<br>
small amount of regulators, for example from 0.01 to 5% by weight, based on the<br>
monomers M being polymerized. Suitable regulators are in particular organic thio<br>
compounds, for example mercaptoalcohols, such as mercaptoethanol,<br>
mercaptocarboxylic acids, such as thioglycolic acid, mercaptopropionic acid,<br>
alkylmercaptans, such as dodecylmercaptan, furthermore allyl alcohols and aldehydes.<br>
The copolymers CP are prepared, in particular, by radical solution polymerization in a<br>
solvent. Examples of solvents are water, alcohols, such as, for example, methanol,<br>
ethanol, n-propanol and isopropanol, dipolar-aprotic solvents, for example N-<br>
alkyllactams, such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), N-ethylpyrrolidone, furthermore<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),. N,N-dialkylamides of aliphatic carboxylic acids, such as<br>
N.N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide, furthermore aromatic, aliphatic<br>
and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons which may be halogenated, such as hexane,<br>
chlorobenzene, toluene or benzene. Preferred solvents are isopropanol, methanol,<br>
toluene, DMF, NMP, DMSO and hexane; particular preference is given to DMF.<br>
The preparations according to the invention can be formulated in solid form or in liquid<br>
form. Depending on the embodiment, the preparations according to the invention may<br>
also comprise auxiliaries and/or carriers customary in crop protection compositions or<br>
in compositions for the protection of materials. The auxiliaries include in particular<br>
conventional surface-active substances and other additives and carriers customary in<br>
crop protection and in the protection of materials, which compounds may be solid or<br>

sulfonates, alkyl methyl ester sulfonates, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and<br>
derivatives thereof with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene sulfonic acids,<br>
phenol- and/or phenolsulfonic acids with formaldehyde or with formaldehyde and urea,<br>
mono- or dialkyl sulfosuccinates; and also protein hydrolysates and lignosulfite waste<br>
liquors. The abovementioned sulfonic acids are advantageously used in the form of<br>
their neutral or, if appropriate, basic salts.<br>
The nonionic surfactants include, for example:<br>
fatty alcohol alkoxylates and oxoalcohol alkoxylates, in particular ethoxylates and<br>
propoxylates having degrees of alkoxylation of usually from 2 to 100 and in<br>
particular from 3 to 50, for example alkoxylates of C8-C30-alkanols or<br>
alk(adi)enols, for example of isotridecyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, oleyl alcohol or<br>
stearyl alcohol, and their C1-C4-alkyl ethers and C1-C4-alkyl esters, for example<br>

chemically modified lecithins, amino acid surfactants, for example N-lauroylglutamate.<br>
Unless specified otherwise, the alkyl chains of the surfactants listed above are linear or<br>

atoms.<br>
In one embodiment, the aqueous preparations according to the invention comprise not<br>
more than 10% by weight, preferably not more than 5% by weight and in particular not<br>
more than 3% by weight, for example from 0.01 to 5% by weight or from 0.1 to 3% by<br>

amount of active compound and copolymer CP.<br>
However, depending on the application, it may be advantageous to formulate the active<br>
compound preparations according to the invention with surface-active substances. In<br>
this case, the proportion of conventional surface-active substance is frequently in the<br>
range from 0.1 to 60% by weight, in particular in the range from 0.5 to 50% by weight,<br>
based on the total amount of active compound and copolymer CP, or in the range from<br>
0.1 to 60% by weight, in particular in the range from 0.5 to 50% by weight and<br>
especially in the range from 0.5 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the<br>
formulated preparation.<br>
In spite of the fact that one of the advantages of the preparations according to the<br>
invention is their low content of volatile organic compounds, for some applications it<br>
may be desirable for the preparations according to the invention to be mixed with<br>
organic solvents, oils and fats, preferably solvents or oils and fats which are<br>
environmentally friendly or biocompatible, for example the water-miscible solvents<br>
mentioned above or solvents, oils or fats whose miscibility with water is only very<br>

Suitable thickeners are compounds which confer a pseudoplastic flow behavior to the<br>
aqueous preparations, i.e. high viscosity at rest and low viscosity in the agitated state.<br>
Mention may be made, in this connection, for example, of polysaccharides, such as<br>
xanthan (Kelzan® from Kelco; Rhodopol® 23 from Rhone Poulenc; or Veegum® from<br>

Examples of powder-flow aids are in particular silicic acid, especially fumed silicic acid<br>
and precipitated silicic acid, and also calcium carbonate and magnesium stearate. The<br>
amount of powder-flow aid, if present, is typically up to 5% by weight, in particular up to<br>
2% by weight, for example from 0.1 to 5% by weight or from 0.2 to 2% by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Suitable carriers are, in principle, all liquid and solid substances which are usually<br>
employed in formulations for crop protection or the protection of materials, in particular<br>
in formulations of fungicides, and which are typically chemically inert. Liquid carriers<br>
are in particular water and mixtures of water with organic water-miscible solvents. Solid<br>
carriers are, for example, silicates and alumosilicates including bole, loess, clays and<br>
aluminas, for example phyllosilicates and tectosilicates, such as montmorillonite,<br>
hectorite, saponite, beidellite, sauconite, bentonite, talcum, kaolin, attapulgite,<br>

fertilizers, such as, for example, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium<br>
nitrate, ureas and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal,<br>
wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powder and other solid carriers. The solid<br>
carriers are preferably water-soluble or water-dispersible.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the invention relates to preparations in solid form.<br>
The total amount of active compound (active compound 1 + active compound 2) is<br>
generally in the range from 5 to 90% by weight, in particular from 10 to 70% by weight<br>
and especially from 15 to 60% by weight, based on the total weight of the preparation.<br>
The proportion of copolymer CP is usually from 5 to 95% by weight, in particular from<br>

90% by weight, in particular up to 80% by weight and especially up to 65% by weight of<br>
the solid preparation according to the invention. It is to be understood that, in the solid<br>
formulations, the proportion of liquid components different from active compounds 1<br>
and 2, in particular liquid solvent components, is generally not more than 20% by<br>
weight of the formulation, in particular not more than 10% by weight and especially not<br>
more than 1% by weight.<br>
The solid preparations may be present in various macroscopic forms. Examples of<br>
macroscopic forms which may be mentioned are powders as obtained, for example, by<br>
spray drying or freeze drying of liquid formulations, ground materials, granules,<br>
agglomerates or else films. Preference is given to powders.<br>
A first embodiment of solid preparations are those which substantially do not comprise<br>
any solid carrier and which substantially, i.e. to at least 95% and in particular to at least<br>
99%, consist of active compounds 1 and 2, polymer CP and, if appropriate, solid,<br>
preferably water-soluble auxiliaries. In these formulations, the total amount of active<br>
compound (active compound 1 + active compound 2) is generally in the range from 5<br>
to 90% by weight, in particular from 10 to 70% by weight and especially from 15 to 60%<br>
by weight, based on the total weight of the preparation. The proportion of copolymer<br>
CP is usually from 5 to 95% by weight, in particular from 10 to 90% by weight and<br>
especially from 20 to 85% by weight, based on the total weight of the solid carrier-free<br>
preparation. The proportion of auxiliaries may be up to 60% by weight, in particular up<br><br>
to 80% by weight and especially up to 65% by weight of the solid preparation according<br>
to the invention. If the solid preparations are present as powders, they may comprise a<br>
powder-flow aid in the amounts mentioned above. The proportion of solid inert carriers<br>
is preferably not more than 5% by weight, in particular not more than 1% by weight.<br>
A second embodiment of solid preparations are those which, in addition to the active<br>
compounds 1 and 2, the polymer CP and, if appropriate, solid, preferably water-soluble<br>
auxiliaries, comprise at least one solid carrier. In these formulations, the total amount of<br>
active compound (active compound 1 + active compound 2) is generally in the range<br>
from 5 to 80% by weight, in particular from 10 to 60% by weight and especially from 15<br>
to 50% by weight, based on the total weight of the preparation. The proportion of<br>
copolymer CP is usually from 5 to 85% by weight, in particular from 10 to 70% by<br>
weight and especially from 20 to 65% by weight, based on the total weight of the solid<br>
carrier-free preparation. The proportion of carrier material is typically from 10 to 90% by<br>
weight, from 20 to 80% by weight and in particular from 30 to 65% by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the composition. The proportion of auxiliaries may be up to 80% by<br>
weight, in particular up to 70% by weight and especially up to 55% by weight of the<br>
solid preparation according to the invention. If the solid preparations are present as<br>
powders, they may comprise a powder-flow aid in the amounts mentioned above.<br>
Preferred carrier materials are silicates, for example phyllosilicates including clays,<br>
such as montmorillonite, hectorite, saponite, beidellite, sauconite, bentonite, talcum,<br>
furthermore amorphous silicates and silicic acids, such as silica gels, kieselguhr, for<br>
example in the form of diatomaceous earth, precipitated silicic acid, synthetic silicates,<br>
such as zeolites.<br>
In another embodiment, the preparation according to the invention is a liquid or, in<br>
particular, an aqueous preparation. In addition to the components active compound 1,<br>
active compound 2 and copolymer CP, such preparations also comprise a liquid<br>
carrier, in particular water or a mixture of water with a water-miscible organic solvent,<br>
the proportion of organic solvents preferably not exceeding 20% by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the composition.<br>
Examples of water-miscible organic solvents are C3-C4-ketones, such as acetone and<br>
methyl ethyl ketone, cyclic ethers, such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, C1-C4-<br>
alkanols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, tert-butanol,<br>
polyols and their mono- and dimethyl ethers, such as glycol, propanediol, ethylene<br>
glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether,<br><br>

and propionitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, formamide, acetamide,<br>
dimethylacetamide, butyrolactone, 2-pyrrolidone and N-methylpyrrelidone.<br>
The total amount of active compound (active compound 1 + active compound 2)<br>
present in the liquid, in particular aqueous concentrates (liquid formulations) is<br>
generally in the range from 1 to 50% by weight, in particular from 5 to 40% by weight<br>
and especially from 7 to 35% by weight, based on the total weight of the preparation.<br>
The amount of copolymer CP is usually from 3 to 50% by weight, in particular from 5 to<br>
45% by weight and especially from 10 to 40% by weight, based on the total weight of<br>
the preparation. The proportion of auxiliaries may be up to 30% by weight, in particular<br>
up to 20% by weight and; especially up to 10% by weight of the liquid preparation<br>
according to the invention. Typical auxiliaries of liquid preparations are, for example,<br>
thickeners, antifoams, preservatives,antifreeze agents, biocides, pH-adjusting agents<br>
and surface-active substances. The solids content is typically in the range from 5 to<br>
70% by weight, in particular from 10 to 60% by weight and especially from 20 to 55%<br>
by weight. The proportion of water-immiscible volatile components is advantageously<br>
not more than 5% by weight, in particular not more than 1% by weight, based on the<br>
total weight of the aqueous liquid formulation.<br>
In the aqueous preparations, active compounds 1 and 2 and copolymer CP are present<br>
in the aqueous phase in finely distributed form. The mean particle size, determined by<br>
light scattering, in the concentrates is typically less than 1 urn, in particular less than<br>
500 nm and especially less than 300 nm.<br>
Aqueous phase is understood to be pure water or water which comprises dissolved<br>
additives, for example a buffer system or salts or further additives, such as, for<br>
example, water-miscible solvents. The pH of the aqueous phase is generally in the<br>
range from 2 to 13, preferably from 3 to 12, particularly preferably from 4 to 10.<br>
Typically, the aqueous formulations comprise at least one of the antifreeze agents<br>
mentioned above, if appropriate one or more of the biocides mentioned above, if<br>
appropriate one or more of the thickeners mentioned above, if appropriate one or more<br>
of the agents for adjusting the pH (buffers) mentioned above, if appropriate one or<br>
more of the antifoams mentioned above and if appropriate one or more of the surface-<br>
active substances mentioned above.<br><br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for preparing the preparations<br>
described, hereinbelow also referred to as process 1. Typically, this process comprises<br>
intimate mixing of the components present in the preparations according to the<br>
invention using customary processes.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, intimate mixing is achieved by a process comprising<br>
i) providing a solution of active compound 1, of copolymer CP and of at least one<br>
further active compound 2 in an organic solvent and then<br>
ii) substantial or complete removal of the organic solvent.<br>
If, as a result of the preparation, the copolymer CP is already present in an organic<br>
solvent, this solution is preferably used, for mixing with the active compound or the<br>
active compound solution.<br>
In a first step of process 1, a solution of the copolymer and at least one further active<br>
compound in a suitable organic solvent is prepared. To this end, a first solution of the<br>
copolymer CP in a first organic solvent is generally mixed with one or two separate<br>
solutions of the active compounds 1 and 2 in an organic solvent, where the solutions<br>
may already comprise further auxiliaries and additives. It is also possible to add the<br>
auxiliaries and additives at a later point in time. The solvents used for preparing the<br>
solutions may be identical or different; typically, solvents which are miscible with one<br>
another will be chosen. It may not be necessary to prepare a solution of copolymer CP<br>
if the synthesis of copolymer CP is carried out in a solvent suitable for use in the<br>
process for preparing the formulation according to the invention.<br>
Examples of organic solvents suitable for this purpose are C1C6-alkyl alcohols, such<br>
as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, esters<br>
of aliphatic C1-C4-carboxylic acids with C1-C4-alkanols, such as ethyl acetate, butyl<br>
acetate, ketones having preferably 3 to 6 carbon atoms, such as acetone, methyl ethyl<br>
ketone, methyl isopropyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetals, di-C1-C4-alkyl ethers,<br>
such as diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, cyclic ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
aliphatic C1-C4-carboxylic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, N-<br>
substituted or N,N-disubstituted C1-C4-carboxamides, such as acetamide,<br>
dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylpropionamide, lactams, such as N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone, lactones, such as, for example, butyrolactone, aliphatic and<br>
aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform,<br>
1,2-dichloroethane or chlorobenzene, and also mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br><br>
Preferred organic solvents are methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, dimethylformamide, N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone, methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene,<br>
acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isopropyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone,<br>
tetrahydrofuran and also mixtures of these solvents. Particularly preferred solvents are<br>
methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
In a second step, the solvent(s) is/are very substantially renToved in a customary<br>
manner by suitable processes. Customary processes for removing solvents are, for<br>
example, spray drying, evaporation at reduced pressure, freeze drying, evaporation<br>
under atmospheric pressure, if appropriate at elevated temperature. The processes<br>
suitable for drying furthermore include lyophilization or drying in a fluidized-bed dryer.<br>
This affords the active compound formulations according to the invention in solid form.<br>
In this manner, a solid, viscous or gel-like composition is generally obtained. If a solid is<br>
obtained after removal of the solvent, it is possible to prepare in a manner known per<br>
se and depending on the drying conditions finely divided powders or coarsely divided<br>
granules which can be dispersed or dissolved in water without any problems and<br>
without any significant increase of the particle size. It is also possible to prepare a<br>
coarsely divided solid and to grind this to the desired particle size.<br>
To prepare a solid formulation which comprises a carrier, it is also possible, for<br>
example, to adopt a procedure where<br>
i) one or more separate solutions of the active compound 1, the copolymer CP, the<br>
at least one further active compound 2 and, if appropriate, the auxiliaries in one<br>
or more different organic solvents are provided,<br>
ii) these solutions are mixed with the carrier or applied to the carrier and<br>
iii) the organic solvent(s) are substantially or completely removed.<br>
This process, hereinbelow also referred to as process 2, is particularly suitable if a<br>
viscous or gel-like product is obtained when no carrier is used.<br>
In process 2, the solution(s) are advantageously applied to the carrier by a spray<br>
process, for example by a spray drying or spray granulation process, where the<br>
solvent(s) is/are at the same time evaporated. The auxiliaries may also be applied to<br>
the carrier in this manner or be added at a later point in time.<br><br>
With respect to the solutions of the active compounds 1 and 2, the copolymer CP and<br>
the auxiliaries, in principle, what was said above for process 1 applies analogously.<br>
Typically, the preparation of aqueous preparations according to the invention<br>
comprises the active compounds 1 and 2, the copolymer CP and any auxiliaries being<br>
incorporated into an aqueous dispersion medium. The process may, for example,<br>
comprise the following steps:<br>
i) providing a solution comprising the active compounds 1 and 2, the copolymer CP<br>
and, if appropriate, part or all of the auxiliaries in an organic solvent which is<br>
preferably miscible with water, a melt of the components mentioned above or a<br>
powder of the components mentioned above,<br>
ii) incorporating the solution, the melt or the powder into an aqueous dispersion<br>
medium and<br>
iii) if present, substantial or complete removal of the organic solvent.<br>
To prepare the aqueous preparations according to the invention, the solution or melt or<br>
the powder obtained in step i) will be dispersed either in water or in an aqueous<br>
medium. An aqueous medium is to be understood as meaning water, an aqueous<br>
solution of surface-active substances and also mixtures of water with organic water-<br>
miscible solvents, where the proportion of such solvents is typically not more than 20%<br>
by volume, based on the total amount of water and solvent.<br>
Dispersing is usually carried out by application of shear forces, for example by shaking<br>
at high frequencies and high amplitudes or by stirring at high frequencies, by turbine<br>
agitation, or by use of a mixing chamber. Dispersing can be carried out continuously or<br>
batchwise. Preference is given to continuous dispersion. Dispersing can, if appropriate,<br>
be carried out at elevated temperature and/or elevated pressure.<br>
The organic solvent used for preparing the solution is preferably miscible with water. In<br>
this context, miscible with water means that, under the mixing conditions, the organic<br>
solvents are, without phase separation, miscible with water by at least 10% by weight,<br>
preferably 15% by weight, particularly preferably 20% by weight. Examples of water-<br>
miscible organic solvents are those mentioned above, in particular cyclic ethers, such<br>
as tetrahydrofuran.<br><br>
If a solution of the active compounds 1 and 2 and the copolymer CP has been<br>
dispersed in water, the organic solvent will then be substantially or completely<br>
removed. This is typically carried out by distillation, water that has been distilled off<br>
usually being successively replaced.<br>
In another, likewise preferred process, the preparation of aqueous preparations<br>
according to the invention comprises the following steps:<br>
i) providing an aqueous solution comprising the copolymer CP,<br>
ii) providing one or two separate solutions comprising active compound 1 and the at<br>
least one further active compound 2 in one or more water-miscible organic<br>
solvents,<br>
iii) mixing of the aqueous solution of the copolymer CP with the solution(s) of active<br>
compounds 1 and 2, and<br>
iv) substantial or complete removal of the organic solvent(s).<br>
In a first step, the copolymer CP and, if appropriate, further additives are dissolved in<br>
an aqueous solvent system. If the preparation already affords an aqueous solution of<br>
the copolymer, this aqueous solution is preferably used for mixing with the active<br>
compound solution. Furthermore, active compound 1 and active compound 2 are<br>
dissolved in a water-miscible solvent, if appropriate with addition of further auxiliaries.<br>
The aqueous solution of the copolymer CP is then mixed with the solution of<br>
epoxiconazole and the active compound 2.<br>
Mixing is advantageously carried out with input of energy, such as, for example, by<br>
application of shear forces, by shaking at high frequencies and high amplitudes or by<br>
stirring at high frequencies, by turbine agitation or by use of a mixing chamber. Mixing<br>
can be carried out continuously or batchwise. Preference is given to continuous mixing.<br>
The solvents of the dispersion obtained in this manner can be removed in a customary<br>
manner, as illustrated above.<br>
The preparations according to the invention are distinguished firstly by the fact that an<br>
extremely fine division of the dispersed active compound phase is ensured on dilution<br>
with water, where the mean particle size of the dispersed active compound phase is in<br>
the ranges mentioned above. Even on prolonged storage and/or storage at elevated<br>
temperature, the active compound preparations according to the invention do not lose<br>
these properties. The use of further surface-active compounds for this purpose is not<br><br>
required. Moreover, the preparations according to the invention can be formulated as<br>
low-solvent preparations (solvent content 
preparations (solvent content 
any separation taking place, the preparations can be stored over a relatively long<br>
period of time of several months, even at elevated temperature and/or at highly<br>
fluctuating temperatures. Also, crystallization phenomena like those that may<br>
sometimes occur with formulations of some conazole fungicides and in particular<br>
epoxiconazole formulations do not take place.<br>
The preparations according to the invention are particularly suitable for controlling<br>
phytopathogenic fungi and, in this respect, are at least equal and frequently superior to<br>
customary formulations of active compounds 1 and 2. The preparations according to<br>
the invention are highly effective against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, in<br>
particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes and Basidiomycetes.<br>
They are particularly important in the control of a multitude of fungi on various<br>
cultivated plants, such as wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, com, grass, bananas, cotton,<br>
soybeans, coffee, sugar cane, vines, fruits, ornamental plants, and vegetables, such as<br>
cucumbers, beans, tomatoes, potatoes and cucurbits and the seeds of these plants.<br>
They are especially suitable for controlling the following plant diseases:<br>
•	Alternaria species on vegetables and fruit,<br>
•	Bipolaris and Drechslera species on cereals, rice and lawns,<br>
•	Blumeria graminis (powdery mildew) on cereals,<br>
•	Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) on strawberries, vegetables, ornamental plants and<br>
grapevines,<br>
•	Erysiphe cichoracearuni and Sphaerotheca fuliginea on cucurbits,<br>
•	Fusarium and Verticillium species on various plants,<br>
•	Mycosphaerella species on cereals, bananas and peanuts,<br>
•	Phytophthora infestans on potatoes and tomatoes,<br>
•	Plasmopara viticola on grapevines,<br>
•	Podosphaera leucotricha on apples,<br>
•	Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides on wheat and barley,<br>
•	Pseudoperonospora species on hops and cucumbers,<br>
•	Puccinia species on cereals,<br>
•	Pyricularia oryzae on rice,<br>
•	Rhizoctonia species on cotton, rice and lawns,<br><br>
•	Septoria tritici and Stagonospora nodorum on wheat,<br>
•	Uncinula necator on grapevines,<br>
•	Ustilago species on cereals and sugar cane, and also<br>
•	Venturis species (scab) on apples and pears.<br>
The preparations according to the invention are also suitable for controlling harmful<br>
fungi, such as Paecilomyces variotti, in the protection of materials (for example wood,<br>
paper, paint dispersions, fibers or fabrics) and in the protection of stored products.<br>
The preparations are typically applied by treating the fungi, or the plants, seeds,<br>
materials or soil to be protected from fungal attack with a dilute aqueous preparation of<br>
the preparations according to the invention comprising a fungicidally effective amount<br>
of the active compounds 1 and 2. The application can be carried out both before and<br>
after the infection of the materials, plants or seeds by the fungi.<br>
The active compound concentrations in the aqueous preparations may be varied within<br>
relatively large ranges. In general, they are between 0.0001 and 1%, preferably<br>
between 0.0005 and 0.1%.<br>
When employed in crop protection, the application rates are between 0.01 and 2.0 kg<br>
of active compound per ha, depending on the kind of effect desired.<br>
In seed treatment, amounts of active compound of from 1 to 1000 g/100 kg of seed,<br>
preferably from 1 to 200 g/100 kg, in particular from 5 to 100 g/100 kg are generally<br>
used.<br>
When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the amount of active<br>
compound applied depends on the kind of application area and on the desired effect.<br>
Amounts customarily applied in the protection of materials are, for example, from<br>
0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably from 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active compound per cubic meter of<br>
treated material.<br>

Monomer solution 1: Mixture comprising 450 mg of methyl acrylate, 300 mg of<br>
1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone and 150 mg of 2-acrylamido-<br>
2-methylpropanesulfonic acid dissolved in DMF to 8.64 ml.<br>
Initiator solution 2: 100 mg of 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) dissolved in DMF to<br>
1.00 ml.<br>
Molecular weights and glass temperatures of copolymers CP1 to CP4 are listed in<br>
table 1:<br><br>
Preparation of preparations Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4 and Z5 according to the invention:<br>
General preparation procedure for solid formulations<br>
10 g of an active compound mixture of epoxiconazole and pyraclostrobin (weight ratio<br>
5:7 in the case of Z1, Z2 and Z3; weight ratio 1:1 in the case of Z5) or epoxiconazole<br>
and metconazole (weight ratio 1:1 in the case of Z4) were dissolved in a solution of<br>
30 g of copolymer CP and 70 g of DMF. The solvent was removed under reduced <br>
pressure at a temperature of 80°C, giving a solid homogeneous material which had no<br>
crystalline components.<br><br>
In comparative experiments VZ1, VZ2, VZ3 and VZ4, instead of the active compound<br>
mixture 10 g of pure epoxiconazole were formulated under the conditions given above.<br>
This gave solid materials each having crystalline components.<br><br>
On dilution of the preparations Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4 and Z5 with water to an active compound<br>
concentration of 64 ppm, optically water-clear solutions were obtained. Accordingly, the<br>
mean particle size of all samples was less than 100 nm. In contrast, on dilution of the<br>
samples VZ1 to VZ4, the separation of solid was observed.<br>
To determine the storage stability, samples of preparations Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4 and Z5 were<br>
stored for 5 months at -10°C, room temperature or 55°C. In none of the samples was<br>
there any formation of crystalline material. After this period of time, all samples could<br>
be diluted with water to give optically water-clear solutions.<br>
Application tests<br>
Examination of the fungicidal action<br>
The active compound preparation in question was prepared as a stock solution having<br>
a concentration of 64 ppm of active compound and then diluted with water to the active<br>
compound concentration stated below (table 3).<br><br>
Leaves of potted wheat seedlings of the cultivar "Kanzler" were inoculated with a spore<br>
suspension of brown rust (Puccinia recondita). The pots were then placed in a chamber<br>
with high atmospheric humidity (90 to 95%) and at 20 to 22°C for 24 hours. During this<br>
time, the spores germinated and the germ tubes penetrated into the leaf tissue. The<br>
next day, the infected plants were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous suspension<br>
having the active compound concentration stated below. The suspension was prepared<br>
as described above. After the spray coating had dried, the test plants were cultivated in<br>
a greenhouse at temperatures between 20 and 22°C and at 65 to 70% relative<br>
atmospheric humidity for 7 days. The extent of the rust fungus development on the<br>
leaves was then determined.<br>
The results of the biological test are summarized in table 3. The results show that, at<br>
low application rates, the copolymer-stabilized active compound mixture has better<br>
fungicidal activity than commercial products.<br><br>
