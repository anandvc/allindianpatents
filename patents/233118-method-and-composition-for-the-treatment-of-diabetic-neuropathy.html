				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention.relates to a composition and a method for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. More particularly, the present invention relates to a composition including a combination of ingredients, which provide a surprising degree of effective relief from symptoms of diabetic nenropathy and to a method for using the compositions; to. treat diabetic neuropathy.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a- common disease that is usually classified into insulin-dependent and non-insulin dependent types. Both types may be managed by diet, in combination with insulin in the' first type and a variety of drugs in the second type. However, while conscientious.'patients and doctors can usually manage the changes.in. blood glucose associated with diabetes reasonably satisfactorily, this 'does not prevent long term damage to many tissues as a result of the disease. This damage may .take many forms but the major types are damage to the eyes (retinopathy), nerves (neuropathy), kidneys (nephropathy) and cardiovascular system.<br>
There are many approaches to reducing or preventing these forms of damage, which are collectively known as the long-term complications of diabetes. One approach is based on damage that results from over-production of the glucose metabolite, sorbitol, in the cells of the body. Glucose can be converted to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose, reductase. High levels of sorbitol may be among the causes of diabetic complications such as diabetic neuropathy. As a result, a number of pharmaceutical companies have been developing aldose reductase inhibitors for the purpose of reducing diabetic neuropathy.<br>
It has been established that a wide variety of flavanoids are effective inhibitors of aldose reductase, including such flavanoids as quercetin quercitrinand myrecetrin..<br><br>
However, U.S. Patent No. 4,232,040 discloses thai, uespvte me iact tnat these flavanoids have been shown in in vitro studies to be among the most potent flavanoids for aldose reductase inhibition, a need exists for aldose reductase inhibitors that can be used more effectively and in "lower doses than these flavanoids.<br>
In fact, numerous patents are devoted to the goal of developing improved aldose reductase inhibitors. Among these patents are U.S. Patent Nos. 6,069,168; 5,011,840; 4,210,667; 4,147,795; 5,866,578; and 5,561,110. Numerous other patents exist which relate to aldose reductase inhibitors.<br>
Another approach to thetreatment of diabetic.neuropathy is disclosed in. U.S. Patent. No. 5,840,736 (Zeile et al.). In this method, pharmaceutical compositions aredisclosed for stimulating the growth of neurites in nerve cells. The compositions include a neurotrophic amount of a compouno and; a nerve growth' factor. These compositions may be administered"in a number of ways incluing; orally ana xopicany<br>
Still another approach to the treatment of neuropathy is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,550,249 (Delia Ville et al.). In this approach, compositions suitable for treatment of vitamin H deficiencies are adrninistered for the treatment of neuropathy. This patent relates to biotin salts with alkanolamines. The compositions may be administered orally parenterally or topically.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,665,360 (Mann) relates to the treatment of peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes mellitus by periodic topical application of a composition containing capsicum oleoresin as the active ingredient. When applied to the skin of the affected area, pain and burning associated with the neuropathy are said to be reduced. However, capsicum oleoresin has been shown to kill nerve endings in. some cases and thus this composition suffers from this disadvantage.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,981,594 (Okamoto et al.) relates to amethod of treatment of diabetic neuropathy using combined administration of a formulation including as an active ingredient, a prostaglandin I derivative with an anti-diabetic agent in order to improve nerve conduction velocities. Suitable anti-diabetic agents include oral hypoglycemic aeents and insulin.<br><br>
The Okamoto patent also contains a detailed discussion of the various types of neuropathy that may be associated with diabetes. According to this patent, nerve conduction velocity (NCV) is the most widely used method of objectively evaluating the seven ty of diabetic neuropathy.   This patent also mentions that current methods of treating diabetic neuropathy such as dietetic therapy, administration of insulin, aldose reductase inhibitors or ammoguanidine to improve abnormal glucose metabolism, and administration of troglitazone or agents for the improvement of blood flow have been tested but found to be insufficient when a single drug was used. Also, according to this patent, methods of treatment by combined use of different therapeutic agents which have different functions had yet to be established. The patent concludes that combined drug therapies1 for diabetic neuropathy, aiming at recovering, once reduced nerve conduction velocity, have not yet been confirmed.<br>
There treatment tor.diabetic neuropathy that does not suffer from the disadvantage that it causes severe side effects, as do many aidose reductase inhibitors, for example.<br>
Accordingly, it: is the primary object of the present invention to provide a composition that is effective for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a composition for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy that does not cause severe side effects in the patient treated with the composition.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the summary and detailed descriptions of the invention that follow.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a composition for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. The composition includes a mixture of a compound that promotes synthesis of nerve growth factor, an aldose reductase inhibitor and an antioxidant, optionally formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. It has been found that this combination of active agents provides significant, effective relief of symptoms of diabetic<br><br>
neuropathy, as well as at least partial recovery of lost neurological function in some cases. in view of the consensus in the art that combinations of various active agents have not been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, the present invention provides a surprising and unexpected effect. In addition, the composition of the present invention, when used in effective amounts to treat diabetic neuropathy, does not exhibit the severe side effects of many prior art compositions proposed for treatment of this ailment.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention relates to a method for the administration of a composition in accordance with the present invention for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. In the method, an effective amount of the composition of the invention is administered over a period of time sufficient to provide the beneficial effects of relief from the symptoms.<br>
In a third aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutically acceptable carrierr for a topical composition that provides excellent dispersions and/or. solutions of active ingredients and good penetration through the skin to the areas to be treated. The carrier for a topical composition may also include one or more materials that provide beneficial properties to the skin since many sufferers from diabetic neuropathy develop skin problems such as ulcers, lesions or cell damage.<br>
DETAILED  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In a first aspect the present invention relates to a composition for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. The composition includes at least a compound that promotes synthesis of nerve growth factor, an aldose reductase inhibitor and an antioxidant.<br>
The compound that promotes synthesis of nerve growth factor may be selected from suitable compounds that have been shown to have this activity. Suitable compounds that promote synthesis of nerve growth factor are those that do not induce significant, adverse side effects when administered to a patient in amounts that promote synthesis of nerve growth factor, and which do not react with one or more of the ingredients of the compositions of the invention thereby resulting in a substantial loss of activity of one or more active ingredients. Preferred compounds for promoting synthesis of nerve growth<br><br>
factor are those that occur naturally in the human body and/or materials obtained from plants, animals or derivatives thereof, which may be administered to humans without significant, adverse side effects in the amounts used.<br>
Exemplary compounds that promote synthesis of nerve growth factor useful in the present invention include vitamin D3, vitamin D3 analogs, compounds that maybe converted or metabolized into vitamin D3 in the human body, and metabolites thereof. Exemplary compounds that may be converted or metabolized into a vitamin D3 include certain cholesterols, which are illustrated below. Such cholesterols may be converted into Provitamin D when a hydrogen atom is removed from the number 7 carbon atom, to thereby form a double bond with the number 8" carbon atom, in the second, or 'B! ring of the cholesterol molecule. The cholesterol is 'oxidized' (that is, an electron is removed with the hydrogen atom), so that the double bond is a consequence; of two electrons shared mutuallv by  the numbers 7 and 8.carbon, atoms of the cholesterol.<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Provitamin D may be converted to Vitamin D3 in human body by the action of ultraviole light through the skin. In this reaction, the B ring of the sterol molecule is opened.<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
C holecalciferol, which is Vitamin D3, may be further converted into another vitamin D intermediate, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, in the hverby mitochondrial hydroxylase, in the presence of NADPH, and molecular oxygen.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
When a more active vitamin D3 is requirea, 25-hydroxycholecal'ciferol is transported to the kidney where a new hydrolase enzymeis synthesized. Thisenzyme introduces another hydroxyl group at position 1, and the bioactive form of Vitamin D3, calcitriol, is produced.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Exemplary vitamin D3 analogs include 1(S), 3(R)-dihydroxy-20(R)-(l-ethoxy-5-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2-heptyn-l-yl)-9, 10-seco-pregna-5(Z), 7(E), 10 (19)-triene. Exemplary vitamin D3 metabolites include I, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Also, pharmaceutically<br><br>
acceptable salts of the compounds that promote synthesis of nerve growth factor may be employed. The most preferred compound that promotes synthesis of nerve growth factor is vitamin D3.<br>
The preferred compounds that promote the synthesis of nerve growth factor may, in addition to this activity, also function to prevent neurotrophic deficits. This additional effect of the preferred compounds may also contribute to the overall beneficial effect of the com position of the present invention.<br>
In order to formulate the compound that promotes synthesis of nerve growth factor in, the composition of the present invention, it may be necessary to use a dispersant. suitable dispersants are known to persons skilled in the' art. A particularly suitable dispersant for the compounds that promote synthesis of nerve growth factor is corn oil.. Corn oil also has the advantage that it is a natural product. The amount'of com oil used is an amount sufficient to disperse me compound, that promotes.; syntnesis of nerve growth' factor.<br>
The second ingredient of the composition of the present invention is an aldose reductase inhibitor. Numerous suitable aldose reductase inhibitors are known to persons skilled in the art. Again, suitable aldose reductase inhibitors are those that do not induce significant, adverse side effects when administered to a patient in an amount effective for aldose reductase inhibition, and which do not react with one or more of the ingredients of the composition of the present invention thereby resulting in a substantial loss of activity of one or more active ingredients of the composition. Preferred aldose reductase inhibitors are close that occur naturally in the human body and/or materials obtained from plants, animals, or derivatives thereof, which may be administered to humanswithout significant, adverse side effects in the amounts used.   -.'<br>
As mentioned above, numerous aldose reductase inhibitors are known to persons skilled in the art. However, significant adverse side effects are associated with the use of many aldose reductase inhibitors in humans. Thus, it is important to select one or more aldose reductase inhibitors for use in the compositions of the present invention based on minimizing the risk associated with use of the aldose reductase inhibitor taking into account<br><br>
the amount of that particular inhibitor that must be employed to achieve the desired level of aldose reductase inhibition. Different aldose reductase inhibitors exhibit different levels of inhibition. With this in mind, the preferred aldose reductase inhibitors for use in the compositions of the present invention are flavonoids and flavonoid derivatives. Exemplary aldose reductase inhibitors include (-)-epigallocatechin; (-)-epigallocatechin-gallate; 1,2,3,6-tetra-o-gallyol-ß-d-gmcose; 2'o-acetylacetoside; 3,3',4-tri-o-methyl-ellagic acid; 6,3 ',4' -trihydroxy-5,7,8-trimethoxyfiavone; 6-hydroxy-iuteolin; 6-hydroxykaempferol-3,6-dimethyl ether; 7-o-acetyl-8-epi-loganic acid; acacetin; acetoside; acetyl trisulfate quercetin; amentoflavone; apigenin; apiin; astragalin; avicularin; axillarin; baicalein; brazilin; brevifolin carboxylic acid; caryophyllene; chrysm-5,7-dihydroxyfiavone; chrysoeriol; chrysosplenol; chrysospLenoside-a; chrysosplenoside-d;.cosmpsiin; 5-cadinene; dimethyimussaenoside; diacerylcirsimaritin;: diosmetin; dosmetin; ellagic acid; ebinin;, ethyl brevifolin carboxylate: flavocannibiside; flayosativaside; genistein; gpssypetm-8-gluc6side; haematpxylin; hesperidine; hispiduloside; hyperin; indole; uridine; isoliquiritigeoin; isoliquiritin; isoquercitrin; jionoside; juglanin; kaempferol-3-rhamnoside; kaempferol-3-neohesperidoside; kolaviron; licuraside; linariin; linarin; lonicerin; luteolin; luetolin-7-glucoside; luteolin-7-glucoside; luetolin-7-glucoronide; macrocarpal-a; macrocarpal-b; macrocarpal-d; macrocarpal-g; maniflavone; methy scutellarein; naringenin; naringin; nelumboside; nepetin; nepetrin; nerolidol; oxyayanin-a; pectolinarigenin; pectolinarin;, quercetagetin; quercetin; quercimertrin; quercitrin; quercitryl-2" acetate; reynoutrin; rhamnetin; rhoifolin; rutin; scutellarein; sideritoflavone; sophoricoside; sorbarin; spiraeoside; trifolin; vitexin; and wogonin.<br>
The most preferred tlavonoid and/or flavonoid derivative aldose reductase inhibitors are quercetin, quercitrin, myricetin, kaempferol and myrecetrin since these compounds exhibit a high level of aldose reductase inhibition in combination with a relatively low toxicity. Also, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these aldose reductase inhibitors may be employed. The particular aldose reductase inhibitor included in the composition may be determined by factors such as toxicity, bioavailability, solubility and dispersability, among others.<br><br>
The flavonoids and flavonoid derivatives are also preferred since some of these compounds may provide additional beneficial effects in the composition of the present invention. For example, quercetin may act as a chelator for transition metals that some studies have linked to certain symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.<br>
Flavonoids may also have some anti-inflammatory activity and/or may help stabilize cell membranes, both of which activities may be beneficial in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. For example, quercetin may also have an antioxidative and anticlastogentic effect.    In addition, some of the flavonoids and flavonoid derivatives may act as a radical scavenger to scavenge free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals to enhance further enhance the antioxidant effect of the composition of the present invention.<br>
Another active ingredient in the composition of the present invention is the , antioxidant. The antioxidant may be a single compound or a mixture of two or more, compounds. Also, the antioxidant may include one or more compounds that provide . additional beneficial effects beyond the antioxidant activity, such as aldose reductase inhibition.<br>
Compounds which may be used as antioxidants are those which exhibit antioxidant activity when administered without causing any severe adverse side affects when used in an amount effective to provide sufficient antioxidant activity, and which do not react with one or more of the ingredients of the composition of the present invention thereby resulting in a substantial loss of activity of one or more active ingredients. Preferred antioxidants are those that occur naturally in the human body and/or materials obtained from plants or animals which may be administered to humans without significant, adverse side effects in the amounts used, or derivatives thereof.<br>
Preferred antioxidants are selected from ascorbyl palmitate, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), vitamin A, vitamin E acetate, a-lipoic acid, especially DL- α-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, glutathione, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, catechin, galangin, rutin, luteolin, morin, fisetin, silymarin, apigenin, gingkolides, hesperitin, cyanidin, citrin, curcuminoid and derivatives thereof which exhibit antioxidant activity.<br><br>
Even more preferably, mixtures of two or more antioxidants are employed in the composition of the present invention. Particularly preferred antioxidant mixtures are mixtures of ascorbyl palmitate with one or more of vitamin A, vitamin E acetate and a-lipoic acid, especially DL-α-lipoic acid. Derivatives of one or more of these compounds, which exhibit antioxidant activity when administered in the compositions of the present invention may also be employed. Tne antioxidants may also be used in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and this may be preferred in some cases to increase solubility or dispeisability. to reduce adverse side effects, etc.<br>
By "derivatives" is meant structurally similar compounds that exhibit antioxidant , activity and contain at least one significant, common structural element with the compound from which it is derived, which common structural element provides antioxidant activity.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the antioxidant used in die composition of the present invention may be partially or completely replaced-with an amount of one ormore antioxidant enzymes having a comparable level of activity. The antioxidant enzymes useful in the present invention are those capable of scavenging radicals, promoting radical scavengers or preventing radical formation. In one more preferred embodiment, the antioxidant enzyme used in the present invention is skin absorbable. The preferred antioxidant enzymes for use in the present invention include superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methionine reductase aind equivalents thereof. These antioxidant enzymes may prevent the fomaation of free radicals or scavenge the formed free radicals to prevent cell damage. In addition, one or more of these antioxidant enzymes may act synergistically with one or more of the antioxidants in the composition to scavenge free radicals more effectively and thereby help to prevent cell damage in the skin.<br>
The antioxidants used in the composition of the present invention are preferably selected not only for their antioxidant activity, but also based on other beneficial effects that particular compounds may provide. For example, ascorbyl palmitate not only has antioxidant activity, but also may act as an aldose reductase inhibitor and may help prevent degradation of nitric oxide (NO) and thus is a particularly preferred antioxidant for the present invention. Similarly, vitamin E may also help prevent degradation of nitric oxide<br><br>
and is thus a preferred antioxidant. A racemic mixture of α-lipoic acid not only has a strong antioxidant activity but also has a recycling effect on vitamins C and E, and thus is a particularly preferred antioxidant for the present invention. In addition, a-lipoic acid can function in both lipid and non-lipid environments. Similarly, vitamin E may also contribute to an anticancer effect and provide a further beneficial effect on the skin and is thus a -preferred antioxidant in one embodiment of the present invention. Vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester) may also have anticancer effects. Vitamin A is also a fat-soluble material and thus is preferred for use due to this additional beneficial property. However, due to its solubility characteristics, vitamin A may need to be formulated in a suitable dispersant such as corn oil in much the same manner as vitamin D3 as described above.<br>
Preferably, the antioxidant used in the composition of the present invention includes a combination of effective amounts of vitamin A, vitamin. C or its ester, vitamin E and a-lipoic acid to achieve, in addition, to theantioxidant effect, the beneficial effect of recycling' vitamin C or its ester and vitamin E by α-lipoic acid.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, antioxidant mixtures including ascorbyl palmitate with one or both of vitamin A and vitamin E as tocopherols or vitamin E as mixed tocopherols are employed in the composition of the present invention. Most preferably, all-natural vitamin E tocopherols are employed. The antioxidants may also be used in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and this may be preferred in some cases to increase solubility or dispersability, to reduce adverse side effects, to increase bioavailability, etc.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, both quercetin and ascorbyl palmitate are included in the composition of the present invention because there seems to be an enhanced anti-oxidative effect of the combination of quercetin and ascorbyl palmitate.<br>
The antioxidant component of the composition is used in an amount effective to provide significant antioxidant activity when adrninistered to a patient in the composition of the present invention.<br>
Preferably, vitamins A and D3 may be formulated in a single corn oil dispersion. Generally, each cubic centimeter (cc) of the com oil dispersion of vitamins A and D3 used<br><br>
in the present invention may contain 500,000 to 2,000,000 IU of vitamin A and 50,000 to 200,000 IU of vitamin D3. Preferably, every cc of the corn oil dispersion of vitamins A and D3 used in the present invention may contain 800,000 to 1,200,000 IU of vitamin A and 80,000 IU to 120,000 IU of vitamin D3. The most preferred amounts of vitamins A and D3 employed in the composition of the invention are 1,000,000 IU and 100,000 IU, respectively.<br>
The aldose reductase inhibitor is used in an amount of 0.04 to 40 grams, per gram of the antioxidant in the composition. More preferably, the: aldose reductase inhibitor is employed in an amount of 0.17 to 15 grams and, most preferably, 0.4 to 4 grams of the aldose reductase inhibitor; per gram of the total antioxidant in the composition, is employed. The ratio of the amount of the compound that promotes synthesis of nerve ; growth factor to the amount of antioxidant employed in the compositions, of the present invention is from 200 IU per gram of antioxidant to 3 million IU, per. gram of antioxidant. More preferably, 1800 IU to 1 million IU, per gram of antioxidant, and, most preferably 5000IU to 200,000 IU, per gram of antioxidant, of the compound that promotes synthesis of nerve growth factor is employed.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may provide one or more of the following beneficial effects to a patient when administered in effective amounts: relief of pain, burning, tingling, electrical sensations and/or hyperalgesia, increased microcirculation, nitric oxide stabilization, promotion of healing of skin ulcers and lesions, protein kinase C inhibition, decreased oxidative stress, anti-inflammation, blockage of the formation of leukotrienes, stabilization of cell membranes, and promotion of the synthesis of nerve growth factor.<br>
Other compounds may also be included in the composition of the present invention to provide additional benefits. Desirable additional beneficial properties for the other compounds useful in the composition of the present invention include absorbability when applied topically, aldose reductase inhibition, antioxidant; properties, free radical scavenging, transition metal chelation, nitric oxide stabilization, and anti-inflammatory<br><br>
activity, which may have a beneficial effect on the pain of other related disorders such as fibromyalgia.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy involving the administration of a composition of the present invention by a method of administration selected from the group consisting of topical administration, oral administration, parenteral administration, via an implanted reservoir or by inhalation. The composition is administered to a patient that suffers from diabetic neuropathy. In the method, an effective amount of the composition of the invention is administered one to six . times daily as needed to relieve pain and other symptoms of the diabetic neuropathy.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be administered topically, orally, parenterally, by inhalation or via an implanted reservoir. The term "parenteral".as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intra-synovial intrasternai,. intrathecal, intrahepatic, ihtral'esional and intracranial'injection.or infusion techniques.<br>

the composition and the composition is rubbed into the skin until little or no residue<br>
remains on the skin. Treatment initially addresses acute symptoms but may be continued<br>
indefinitely to relieve pain, prevent symptoms of diabetic neuropathy from referring and<br>
possibly restore  some  nerve and/or skin function.	<br>
The topical embodiment of the method of the present invention may provide one or more of the beneficial effects described above for the composition of the invention. In addition, the method of the present invention employing the topical composition may provide some additional beneficial effects due to one or more of the ingredients contained in the pharmaceutically acceptable topical carrier as described in more detail below.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable topical carrier of the present invention is suitable for use as a carrier for a-topical composition wherein the active ingredients are dissolved, dispersed and/or suspended in the composition. The topical carrier of the present invention contains at least a hydrophilic ointment base, panthenol or a panthenol derivative and one or more dispersants, if needed to disperse one or more insoluble or partially insoluble active agents in the carrier. Another preferred carrier of the present invention employs hydroxymethyl cellulose as the carrier material.<br>
Yet another preferred pharmaceutically acceptable an acrylic copolymer in a non-aqueous solvent system, which mainly contains polyethylene glycol such as methoxy polyethylene glycol 550 (MPEG). A particular preferred MPEG is SENTRY CARBOWAX MPEG 550 sold by Union Carbide, which is a<br><br>
food/pharmaceutical/cosmetic grade material. Polyethylene glycols are generally non¬toxic, water-soluble polymers that are fully biodegradable. In the solution, the acrylic copolymer would preferably be present in a concentration range of 3-6 % by weight. Preferably, the acrylic copolymer has a molecular weight of more than 20,000. More preferably, the acrylic copolymer has a molecular weight of more than 100,000, so that the acrylic copolymer will not be substantially absorbed by the human body through the skin.<br>
Suitable hydrophilic ointment bases are known to persons skilled in the art. Exemplary hydrophilic ointment bases suitable for use in the present invention are non-U.S.P. hydrophilic ointment bases such as those made by Fougera, Inc. Sufficient hydrophilic ointment base is employed to act as a carrier for the active ingredients of the composition. Typically the hydrophilic ointment base will make up more than 80% of the total composition and more preferably 80-90% of the composition is the hydrophilic ointment base. The hydrophilic ointment base functions as a carrier and preferably enhances penetration of the active agents into the skin.<br>
The panthenol or panthenol derivatives useful in the present invention include at least D-panthenol, DL-panthenol and mixtures thereof. This component of the topical carrier has skin moisturizing properties, acts as a quick, deep penetrating component of the carrier that helps deliver the active agents through the skin to the area to be treated and imparts a healing effect to damaged tissue. The amount of panthenol or panthenol derivative to be employed is from 0.25 to 10 weight percent, more preferably, from 0.5 to 5 weight percent, and, most preferably, from 1 to 2 weight percent is employed, based on the total weight of the topical composition.<br>
The topical carrier of the present invention may also include additional ingredients known to persons skilled in the art such as other carrier materials, moisturizers, humectants, emollients dispersants, radiation blocking compounds, particularly UV-blockers, as well as other suitable materials that do not have a significant adverse effect on the activity of the topical composition in the amount used. Preferred additional ingredients for inclusion in the carrier are sodium acid phosphate as a moisturizer, witch hazel extract as a carrier, glycerine as a humectant, apricot kernal oil as an emollient, and corn oil as a dispersant.<br><br>
Other materials that may optionally be included in the topical composition of the present invention include inositol, other B-complex vitamins, and anti-inflammatory agents. The composition of the present invention may also be. employed to facilitate wound healing, for the treatment of skin cancer and/or one or more symptoms thereof, or as a composition for protecting skin from the harmful effects of radiation such as radiation breakdown.<br>
The topical composition ot the present invention is preferably made by cold compounding. This may be an important feature of the invention since one or more of the compounds employed in the topical composition are known to be sensitive to heat or other types of energy and thus the activity of the composition may be detrimentally affected as a result of formulating the composition in other ways. Thus, the ingredients of the topical composition the present invention are preferably mixed together, without heating, using a sufficient amount of the topical carrier'to provide a substantially homogeneous cream or ointment. It may be necessary to dissolve, disperse or suspend one or more of the ingredients prior to cold compounding in order to ensure substantially homogeneous distribution of one or more of the ingredients in the composition.<br>
Every kilogram of a preferred topical composition of the present invention may include: 10,000 to 3 million IU of the compound that promotes synthesis of nerve growth factor, 2 to 40 grams of aldose reductase inhibitor, 1 to 50 grams of antioxidants, and other suitable ingredients such as topical carriers.<br>
A more preferred topical composition of the invention can be made using the following ingredients, all based on use of one pound of hydropbilic ointment base. 25-35 cc of a 50% aqueous solution of sodium acid phosphate moisturizing agent, 5-10 cc of D-or DL-panthenol, 5-10 cc of glycerine, 1-3 cc of apricot kemal oil, 3-5 cc of a dispersion of vitamins A and D3 in a corn oil base, 10-20 cc of witch hazel extract, 0.5-2 cc of vitamin E acetate, 2-4 grams of ascorbyl palmitate and 4-8 grams of quercetin powder. Optionally, one or more of the glycerin, witch hazel extract, vitamins A and E and/or the ascorbyl palmitate can be reduced or eliminated from a particular composition, if desirable, or larger<br><br>
amounts of one or more components, i.e. antioxidant, can be employed while reducing the amount of another component of the same type or having a similar type of activity. The invention will now be further illustrated by the following example.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A topical composition including a mixture of an hydrophilic ointment base, sodium acid phosphate moisturizing agent, witch hazel extract, glycerine, apricot kemal oil and DL-panthenol, formulated together as the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and further including, as active agents, vitamins A and D3, ascorbyl palmitate, quercetin and vitamin E acetate, was prepared by cold compounding.. The formulation of the composition is given in Table 1.    ,<br>
The composition was prepared by first placing the-hydrophilic.ointment base in a stainless steelbowl and mixing briskly until, the ointment becomes creamy. Then,.the sodium acid phosphate, panthenol, ascorbyl palmitate, glycerine, apricot kemal oil, vitamins A and D3, witch hazel extract, vitamin E acetate and quercetin are added in that order. After each ingredient is added, mixing is continued until all traces of dry ingredients have disappeared and a substantially homogeneous mixture is obtained. The final color should be a consistent yellow and the cream should have the consistency of cake frosting. The mixture is then placed in a sterile container. All containers, which contact the composition during mixing must also be sterilized with, for example, zephiran choride or a chlorox solution such as betadine.<br>
This composition was topically administered, under the supervision of a physician, to several patients diagnosed with the most difficult case:? of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The topical composition was applied twice daily in the morning and afternoon, except that patients were permitted to apply the composition up to six times daily, as needed for pain relief over a period of a few days. All of the eight patients treated experienced immediate positive results that lasted up to a day or two after treatment was discontinued. The effects noted by the patients included the relief of burning pain, tingling, healing of damaged skin, and reversal of skin discoloration due to impaired circulation.<br><br>
