Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a simple and effieicnt process for the<br>
preparation 7P-(n uorinated metliyithioacctaiiiido)-7a-nietho.\y-3-( I -(2-hydro.\y<br>
ethyl)-] H-5-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl-l-dethia-l-oxa-3-cephem-4-carboxylic	acid<br>
derivatives of the formula (I),<br><br>
wherein R|a hydrogen or fluoro; R) is hydrogen or a counter-ion which forms a salt or esters which forms a prodrug.<br>
Ihe present invention also provides 7P-(fluorinated methylthioaeetamido)-7a-methoxy-3-( 1 -(2-arylmethoxyethyl)-1 H-5-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl-1 -dethia-1 -oxa-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula (II),<br>
4<br><br>
wherein Ru, hydrogen or fluoro; R5 is a carboxy-protecting group which can be removed under mild conditions; Rib is an alcohol-protecting group, which can be removed cleanly under mild conditions and represented by the formula (III),<br><br><br><br>
(C|-C4)alkoxy, aryl(CrC4)alkoxy or substituted aryl(C|-C4)alkoxy group; aryl group represents five or six membered aromatic group.<br>
The present invention also provides a simple and efficient process for the preparation of the compound of formula (II).<br>
The 7-methoxy-l-oxacephalosporins of the formula (I) are useful as bacterial growth inhibitors on human, animal, plant, perishable objects. They are useful for treating or preventing human, veterinary, or poultry infections caused by sensitive Gram-positive bacteria or Gram-negative bacteria. They arc stable and effective against bacteria resistant to other P-lactam antibiotics.<br>
Background of the iFnention<br>
In view of the vital pharmacological activities of 7-methoxy-l-oxacephalosporins of the formula (I), various methods of preparation were reported (Tsuji, T.; Narisada, M.; Hamashima, Y.; Yoshida, T. J. Antibiot. 1985, 38(4), 466; US Patent 4,532,233, 4,529,722 &amp; GB 2 144 119). In most of the cases, the 3-chloromethyl-I-oxaccphem of the general formula (IV) was treated with l-(2-(hydroxyethyl)-lll-letrazole-5-thiol of formula (V) to get condensation product of the formula (VI), which was treated with 4-mcthylbcnzyloxycarbonyl chloride of the formula (VII) under inert conditions to get the compound of the formula (VI11) in which the hydroxy group was protected as a "carbonate". The protected intermediate of the formula (Vlll) was further modified in several steps and finally dcprotcctcd to get the 7a-methoxy-l-oxaccphalosporin of formula (1). The process as described is shown in scheme- 1<br><br><br>
Alternatively, 3-chloromcthyl-l-oxacephcm of the general formula (IV) was condensed with l-(2-(4-methylbcnzyloxycarbonyloxy)ethyl)-lH-tetrazolc-5-thiol of formula (IX) under inert condition to get the compound of the fonnula (VIII) and subsequently carried on several steps leading to the 7a-mcthoxy-l-oxacephalosporin of the formula (I). The process shown in scheme- II<br><br><br>
The limitation of the above method is that 4-methylbenzyloxycarbonyl chloride is neither commercially available nor can be produced in a conventional manufacturing facility as the production of it involves the use of "phosgene" on large scale, which is hazardous and non cco-fricndly. in addition, transportation of the same is not possible without the danger of explosion. Fhe compound has very low stability even at low temperature, which prohibits the use of the same on commercial scale.<br>
Logically the use of benzyloxycarbonyl chloride as an alternative reagent in place of 4-methylbenzyloxycarbonyl chloride was reported in the literature to protect the hydroxy group. We have observed that the deprotection to get the 7a-methoxy-1-oxacephalosporin, requires hazardous reagents which are again cumbersome to use on larger scale. The reagents like stannic chloride/aluminum chloride/titanium tetrachloride in combination with excess Iriflir loacclic-acid only<br><br><br>
works and afforcis a jelly mixture wherein the isolalion of the oxaeephcm was always difficult leading to low yield &amp; quality. We have further observed that all the above hazardous reagents do not work if we use alone &amp; the combination is inevitable.<br>
Thus we investigated variously protected l-(2-(hydroxy)cthyl)-lH-tetrazole-5-thiols to employ in the oxacephalosporin synthesis. With most of the alcohol-protecting groups, satisfactory conversions could not be achieved in one or more of the following steps: attachment of the alcohol-protected l-(2-(hydroxy)cthyl)-llI-tctrazole-5-thiols to the 3-chloromethyl-1-oxaeephcm of the general Ibrmula (IV); methoxylation employing sodium melhoxide (or lithium methoxide) under high basic pll to get 7a-mcthoxy derivative; deacylation with tertiary amines and phosphorous pentachloride at high temperature; acylation under acidic pH; final deprotcction to remove both the carboxy-protecting group and alcohol-protecting group.<br>
With our continued search and intense investigation, we finally achieved identifying a clean process for producing the title compound of the invention of the formula (fl), which employs l-(2-arylmethoxyethyl)-llI-tctrazole-5-thiols of the formula (IX). This has been found to perform well in all of the steps of the synthetic scheme and also effect smooth deprotcction at the last step to yield the final 7a-mcthoxy-l-oxaeephalosporins of the general formula (1) in good purity and yield.<br>
Objectives of the Invention The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of 7p-(fiuorinated methylthioacetamido)-7a-methoxy-3-( 1 -(2-liydroxy ethyl)-lH-5-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl-l-dethia-l-oxa-3-cephem-4-carboxylic   acid   of<br>
the formula (I).<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a commercial process for the preparation of 7(3-(nuorinated mcthylthioacctamido)-7a-mcthoxy-<br><br><br>
3-( I -(2-liydroxyclhyI)-111-5-tclra/olyl)thiomcthyl-1 -dcthia-1 -o.\a-3-ccplicm-4-carboxylic acid  of the  formula (I)  which  would  be  easy  to  implement  on mainifacluring scales.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide simple method of dcprotection of the compounds of the formula (II) to afford 7p-(fluorinated methylthioacetamido)-7a-methoxy-3-( 1 -hydroxyalkyl-5-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl-1 -dcthia-l-oxa-3-ccphcm-4-carboxylic acid of the formula (1), employing a single reagent such as triduoroacctic acid alone or stannic chloride alone without any additional hazardous inorganic reagents as well as high boiling nitromelhane.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide novel intermediates of formulae (XI), (Xll), (XllI) and (II) their use in the preparation of oxacephalosporin of the formula (III).<br>
The intermediates being reported are stable through all the steps of oxacephem manufacturing and further permit an easy, complete and clean dcprotection under mild conditions at the last step.<br>

After tlie reaction was over, the reaction mixture was washed with water and the solvent removed under vacuum to get diphcnylmcthyl 7P-difliioromethylthioacetylamino-7a-methoxy-3-(l-(2-(4-mcthoxyben/,yloxy) ethyl)-lH-tetrazol-5-ylthiomethyl)-l-oxa-3-cephem-4-carboxylate, which can be used in next step without the need of any further purification.<br><br>
Diphenylmetiiyl	7p-difluoromcthyithioacctylamino-7a-mcthoxy-3-(l-(2-(4-<br>
methoxybenzyloxy)ethyl)-llI-tetrazol-5-ylthiomethyl)cephem-4-carboxylatc (4 gm) was dissolved in dichloromethane (20 ml) at 28 °C under dry condition and the clear solution was cooled to -20 °C. To the cold stirred solution, anisole (3.2 ml), trifluoroacctic acid (8 ml) were added at this'tempcrature and stirred well for 3 hrs.   After the completion of, the reaction mixture was poured into diisopropyl<br>
ether and the precipitated product was filtered.  The filtered solid was dissolved in<br>
*<br>
a mixlure of cold ctliyl acclalc, 2-lnitanone and dil. 1IC1.    The organic layer was<br><br>
 separated and extiaeted with cold aqueous sodium biearbonate solition. The aqueous layer was acidified and extracted into a mixture ethyl acetate and 2-butanone. The organic layer was concentrated and the lesidue was dissolved in aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, washed with dichloromethane and lyophilized to get pure sodium 7P-difluoromethylthioacetylamino-7a-methoxy-3-(l-(2-(4-methoxybenzyi oxy)ethyl)-1 H-tetrazol-5-ylmethyl)cephem-4-carboxylate.<br><br><br><br>
