				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 2-(aryl-1-hydroxy;methylene) cycloalkanones. More particularly it relates to the preparation of the monoadditive 2(aryl-l-hydroxy) methylene cycloalkanones of high regioselectivity having general formula 1 given in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R = nil, -CH2-, -CH(CH3)-; X = cyano, nitro and hydroxy, synthesised from compound having general formula 2 given in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R = nil, -CH2-, -CH(CH3)-.<br>
The compounds prepared by the process of this invention are useful for the preparation of mesogens that would find applications in the synthesis of side chain liquid crystalline polymers. In particular, this invention describes a process for the preparation of monoadditive phenyl-1-hydroxy methylene cycloalkanones, that offer high regio-selectivity.<br>
Mesogens are moieties which form part of the polymeric structure in liquid crystalline polymers. If the mesogens form part of the backbone of the polymers, then the polymers are known as main chain liquid crystalline polymers and if these are present as pendant groups along the backbone of the polymers, then the polymers are referred to as side chain liquid crystalline polymers. The mesogens prepared as per the process of this invention are useful for the synthesis of side chain liquid crystalline polymers that could be used for non¬linear optical applications.<br>
The hitherto known processes for the preparation of phenyl-1-hydroxy methylene cycloalkanones involve the reaction of cycloalkanones with aromatic aldehydes in the presence of a base in a suitable solvent. These processes do not offer any regio selectivity to obtain mono addition product' and bis condensed products are obtained.<br>
Another known process that offers regio selectivity to give mono addition product involves the reaction of cyclohexane silyl enol ether with aromatic aldehydes in the presence of titanium tetrachloride. This reaction offers exclusively mono addition product. The process however suffers from the following disadvantages :<br>
1.	Equimolar amount of titanium tetrachloride needs to be added, though the function of titanium tetrachloride is that of a Lewis acid catalyst.<br>
2.	The catalyst, titanium tetrachloride is hygroscopic and hazardous to handle.<br>
3.	The catalyst cannot be recovered at the end of the reaction giving rise to disposal and environmental hazards.<br>
4.	The reaction is carried out at -78°C. It is difficult to maintain this reaction condition in the laboratory.<br>
The  object  of the present invention is to provide  an  improved process  for  the preparation of    2-(aryl-1-hydroxy methylene) cycloalkanones   that  eliminates   the   above   mentioned<br>
disadvantages in the hitherto known process.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process in which catalyst used in the process of this invention can be recovered and reused.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of 2-(aryl-1-hydroxy methylene) cycloalkanones which comprises; reacting silyl enol ether derivative of cycloalkanone of formula 2 with aromiatic aldehydes in presence of a solid super-acid catalyst such as herein described, and a chlorinated solvent such as herein described, at ambient temperature in an inert atmosphere for a period ranging from 24 to 52 hours, filtering the reaction mixture to recover the super-acid catalyst, washing the filtrate with water, drying filtrate over a dehydrant, removing the chlorinated solvent under reduced pressure and recovering the product by column chromatography using an organic solvent as an eluent, to get the pure monabdditive 2-(aryl-l-hydroxy methylene) cycloalkanones of formula 1.<br>
In one of the embodiment of the present inveniton the silyl enol ether used may be such as silyl enol ether of cyclopentene, cyclohexene and 4-cyano benzaldehyde, 4-nitro benzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde.<br>
In yet another feature of the invention, the inert atmosphere<br><br>
may be maintained by using inert gas like nitrogen or argon.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the aliphatic chlorinated solvent used may be such as dichloromethane, chloroform,  carbon  tetrachloride, tetrachloroethane.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the solid super-acid catalyst chosen is sulphated zirconia.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the dehydrant used to dry the washed product is may be such as sodium sulphate, magnesium  sulphate  and calcium chloride.<br>

The process of the present invention has following advantages :<br>
1. The process is stereoselective in addition to regioselective. For the reaction at temperatures in the range   of 30 to 40°C, preferential syn-selectivity is<br>
observed.<br>
2.	Sulphated zirconia acts as Lewis acid and hence the process offers the use. of a single catalyst.<br>
3.	The process can be carried out as a one pot synthesis for the preparation of monoadditive 2-(phenyl-1-hydroxy methylene)  cycloalkanones.<br>
4.	Sulphated zirconia as the super-acid catalyst is used in small amounts compared to equimolar quantities of the Lewis acid used as the catalyst in known processes.<br>
5.	The super-acid catalyst can be recovered and used repeatedly after activation. The process is thus environmentally clean.<br>
6.	The product obtained as per the process of this invention meets the stringent purity requirements for use as mesogens in the synthesis of side chain liquid crystalline polymers for non-linear optical applications.<br>
7.	The process is amenable to scale up to meet the requirements which are usually small.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
