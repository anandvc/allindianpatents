				<td>HIGH TORQUE ONE WAY CLUTCH<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to one-way clutches and more<br>
particularly to a simplified one-way clutch assembly having a high torque<br>
capacity.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] In power transmission devices which shift between two or more<br>
speed ratios such as automotive automatic transmissions and certain power<br>
tools, one-way clutches are frequently employed to ensure smooth and reliable<br>
shifts. One-way clutches are devices that transmit torque in one relative<br>
rotational direction but do not transmit torque in the opposite relative rotational<br>
direction. There are several different types of one-way clutches that are currently<br>
in use. Roller clutches, sprag clutches, rocker clutches and dog clutches are the<br>
more commonly encountered types.<br>
[0004] Roller one-way clutches, as the name implies, utilize a plurality<br>
of rollers disposed between nesting annular members having ramped or<br>
camming surfaces against which the rollers wedge in one direction of relative<br>
rotation and release in the opposite direction of relative rotation. Sprag clutches<br><br>
are similar, utilizing dipole or dog bone elements in place of the rollers, and both<br>
rely upon friction to transmit torque in the engaged state.<br>
[0005] In contrast to roller and sprag one-way clutches are rocker<br>
clutches or dog clutches. Instead of a friction based mechanism, these clutches<br>
rely upon the more robust operation of abutment and engagement of opposing<br>
faces of a plurality of clutch elements. Because the torque transmitting mode is<br>
achieved through moveable elements such as struts which positively engage and<br>
couple inner and outer annular members, higher torque capacities are possible<br>
with this design<br>
[0006] The present invention is directed to an improved and simplified<br>
high torque capacity one-way clutch having a plurality of moveable struts.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] The present invention provides a high torque capacity one-way<br>
clutch having a first, inner annulus nested within a second, outer annulus. The<br>
first, inner annulus includes a plurality of transverse grooves or pockets on its<br>
outer surface as well as a centrally disposed circumferential groove. A like<br>
plurality of moveable clutch elements such as struts having a central opening are<br>
received within respective pockets in the inner annulus and are retained there by<br>
a circumferential retaining band passing through the openings in the struts and<br>
received in the circumferential groove. The second, outer annulus includes a<br>
plurality of transverse grooves or pockets on its inner surface and receives the<br>
inner annulus, clutch elements and circumferential band. Upon relative rotation<br><br>
of the inner and outer annuli in one direction, the struts engage the grooves in<br>
the inner and outer annuli and inhibit rotation between the annuli, thereby<br>
transmitting torque. Upon relative rotation of the inner and outer annuli in the<br>
opposite direction, the struts slide along the inner surface of the outer annulus<br>
without engaging and thus do not transmit torque.<br>
[0008] Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a high<br>
torque capacity one-way clutch.<br>
[0009] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a high<br>
torque capacity one-way clutch having a first, inner annulus having a plurality of<br>
transverse grooves and a circumferential groove on its outer surface.<br>
[0010] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
high torque capacity one-way clutch having a second, outer annulus having a<br>
plurality of transverse grooves on its inner surface.<br>
[0011] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
high torque capacity one-way clutch having a plurality of struts each defining an<br>
opening for receiving a circumferential retaining band.<br>
[0012] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
high torque capacity one-way clutch having a circumferential retaining band<br>
disposed about the circumference of a inner clutch annulus for retaining a<br>
plurality of clutch elements.<br>
[0013] Further objects, advantages and areas of applicability will<br>
become apparent from the description provided herein. It should be understood<br><br>
that the description and specific examples are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0021] With reference to Figure 1, a portion of an automatic<br>
transmission incorporating the present invention is illustrated and generally<br><br>
designated by the reference number 10. The automatic transmission 10 includes<br>
a housing 12 which supports, locates and protects various components of the<br>
automatic transmission 10 such as an input shaft 14, a concentrically disposed<br>
tubular shaft or quill 16 and a torque converter 18 having a stator 20. The<br>
automatic transmission 10 typically includes a plurality of planetary gear<br>
assemblies 22, one of which is illustrated in Figure 1. Active torque transmitting<br>
devices such as clutches 24 and brakes 26, one of both being illustrated in<br>
Figure 1, selectively connect various components of the transmission 10 to<br>
achieve a plurality of forward speeds or gear ratios. Operably disposed between<br>
both the stator 20 of the torque converter 18 and the shaft or quill 24 and a<br>
component of the planetary gear assembly 22 and the clutch 24 are high torque<br>
capacity one-way or overrunning clutches 30 according to the present invention.<br>
[0022] It will be appreciated that the locations of the one-way clutches<br>
30 in the automatic transmission 10 illustrated are by way of example only and<br>
that one-way clutches 30 according to the present invention may be utilized in<br>
other locations and for other purposes both in automatic transmissions and other<br>
power transferring and controlling devices.<br>
[0023] Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, the high torque one-way<br>
clutch 30 includes a first or inner annulus 32 having internal or female splines or<br>
gear teeth 34 which rotationally couple it to, for example, complementary male<br>
splines or gear teeth (not illustrated) on a component of, for example, an<br>
automatic transmission, such as the shaft or quill 16. If desired, one or two<br>
splines or gear teeth 34 may not be cut to form a key or index feature 36 which<br><br>
ensures mounting of the inner annulus 32 to an associated component, for<br>
example, the shaft or quill 16, only in one relative angular position.<br>
[0024] The first or inner annulus 32 defines a plurality, for example, 12,<br>
transverse grooves or pockets 38 about the outer surface 40 of the inner annulus<br>
32. Depending upon the diameter of the inner annulus, more or fewer grooves or<br>
pockets 38 may be utilized; in smaller diameter and lower capacity clutches, for<br>
example, 3, 4, 6, 8 or 10 grooves or pockets 38 may be utilized and in larger<br>
diameter and higher capacity clutches, for example, 14, 16 or 20 grooves or<br>
pockets 38 may be utilized. Centrally axially disposed on the outer surface 40 of<br>
the inner annulus 32 is a discontinuous circumferential channel or groove 42.<br>
[0025] As illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, preferably residing in each<br>
transverse groove or pocket 38 is a moveable clutch element or strut 44. Each of<br>
the struts 44 preferably defines a width slightly less than the width of the inner<br>
annulus 32 and includes a first, rounded, i.e., cylindrical end 46 that seats in the<br>
groove or pocket 38, a second, oblique end 48 and a narrow chamfer 50 along<br>
the outer surface of the strut 44 adjacent the oblique end 48. The struts 44 also<br>
define a centrally disposed rectangular opening 52. A thin slot 54 communicates<br>
between the opening 52 and the cylindrical end 46 of the strut 44. The thin slots<br>
facilitate assembly and repair of the one-way clutch 30 but may be omitted if<br>
desired. Extending about the periphery of the inner annulus 32 in the<br>
circumferential groove or channel 42 and received within each rectangular<br>
opening 52 of each strut 44 is a retaining spring, hoop or band 56. The retaining<br>
band 56 is preferably metal such as spring steel and is therefore flexible but non-<br><br>
extensible. Preferably, the ends of the retaining band 56 are welded together or<br>
secured by other means to form a hoop having a diameter which is just slightly<br>
larger than the nominal outside diameter of the inner annulus 32. The retaining<br>
band 56 maintains the plurality of struts 44 not only within a respective one of the<br>
grooves or pockets 38 but also axially centered in the pockets 38 in the outer<br>
surface 40 of the inner annulus 32. The retaining band 56 also provides a<br>
biasing force to the struts 44 which moves them away from the outer surface 40<br>
of the inner annulus 32 as illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figure 4, the high torque one-way clutch 30<br>
also includes a second or outer annulus 60. The second, outer annulus 60<br>
includes male or external splines or gear teeth 62 which are complementary to<br>
and couple the outer annulus 60 to, for example, a component of the automatic<br>
transmission 10 such as the stator 20. The inner surface of the second, outer<br>
annulus 60 defines a plurality of transverse grooves or notches 64 which are<br>
engageable by the struts 44.<br>
[0027] The actual number of the struts 44 (and the pockets 38) on the<br>
first, inner annulus 32 and the notches 64 on the second, outer annulus 60 and<br>
the ratio or relationship between them are the subject of several engineering<br>
considerations. On the one hand, the higher the number of the struts 44 that<br>
simultaneously engage, the higher the torque capacity of the clutch 30. This<br>
suggests that with twelve of the struts 44, the outer annulus should include<br>
twelve of the notches 64 or a multiple thereof, e.g., twenty-four, thirty-six or forty-<br>
eight. However, given reasonable manufacturing tolerances, it is unrealistic to<br><br>
expect that all twelve of the struts 44 will fully engage and carry equal loads.<br>
Moreover, this configuration, especially with a smaller number of the notches 64,<br>
can result in significant backlash, i.e., motion occurring after a reversal of rotation<br>
but before clutch lock-up. If significant torque is present immediately upon the<br>
reversal of rotation, it is typically followed by an abrupt and harsh clutch<br>
engagement. Depending upon the application, this may or may not be<br>
acceptable but it invariably causes accelerated wear of the clutch components.<br>
[0028] On the other hand, non-multiple relationships or ratios between<br>
the number of the pockets 38 (and the struts 44) and the notches 64 will result in<br>
a smaller number of simultaneously engaged struts 44 and thus nominally lower<br>
torque capacity but significantly reduced backlash. For example, in the<br>
embodiment illustrated and as noted, there are twelve of the pockets 38 and<br>
twelve of the struts 44 on the inner annulus 32. Excellent operation, i.e., rapid<br>
and smooth lock-up and torque transmission with acceptable backlash has been<br>
found to occur with fifty transverse grooves or notches 64 in the outer annulus<br>
60. In this configuration, only two of the struts 44, which are 180° apart, are<br>
simultaneously engaged at any given time. Accordingly, it should be appreciated<br>
that the number of the pockets 38 and the struts 44 on the inner annulus 32 and<br>
the number of the notches 64 on the outer annulus 60 utilized in combination<br>
may vary but preferably will facilitate simultaneous engagement of two, three,<br>
four or more of the struts 44 which are evenly spaced, i.e., 180°, 120° or 90°<br>
apart around the inner annulus 32.<br><br>
[0029] Referring now to Figure 5, the operation of the high torque one-<br>
way clutch 30 will now be described. It will be appreciated that the first, inner<br>
annulus 32 may be driven by or drive an associated circular member having<br>
splines or gear teeth complementary to the female splines or gear teeth 34.<br>
Likewise, the second, outer annulus 60 may drive, be driven by or maintained in<br>
a stationary position by an associated circular member having splines or gear<br>
teeth complementary to the male splines or gear teeth 62. In one direction of<br>
relative rotation between the inner annulus 32 and the outer annulus 60, for<br>
example, when the inner annulus 32 rotates counter-clockwise relative to the<br>
outer annulus 60, the struts 44 slide along the notches 64 and no torque is<br>
transmitted. If, however, the inner annulus 32 attempts to rotate clockwise<br>
relative to the outer annulus 60, the struts 44 which are biased radially outwardly<br>
by the retaining band 56, rapidly and with minimal rotation, engage the notches<br>
64, coupling the inner annulus 32 to the outer annulus 60 and transmitting torque<br>
therebetween. It will be appreciated that significant torque levels can be<br>
transmitted through the high torque one-way clutch 30 according to the present<br>
invention since it utilizes abutting faces of the struts 44 to transmit torque rather<br>
than friction elements. Torque capacity of the one-way clutch 30 can readily be<br>
increased by increasing the width of the inner and outer annuli 32 and 60 as well<br>
as the struts 44.<br>
[0030] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br><br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
