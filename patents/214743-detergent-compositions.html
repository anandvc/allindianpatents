				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relaies to built detergents for domestic use, especially having granular, tablet or syndet bar form. The compositions contain particular aluminosilicate builders, preferably hybrids of aluminosilicate and specific occluded materials such as silicate, carbonate, sulfate, phosphate, borate, nitrate, nitrite, Na2O, or mixtures thereof. The builder can be surface-modified or can be processed in a particular manner. The compositions further contain selected detergent adjuncts, such as certain surfactants, enzymes, polymers and/or bleaches. Other adjuncts, e.g., conventional surfactants, enzymes, builders or bleaches can also be present.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The formulation of zeolite builders into detergents is technically difficult. Zeolites hitherto formulated in detergents lack an ideal combination of low cost, ease of manufacture, high equilibrium binding of both Ca and Mg, rapid kinetics of binding for Ca and Mg, and ability to hold large amounts of surfactant. Zeolites or aluminosilicates, when added to laundry detergents, can interact adversely with numerous laundry detergent adjuncts, e.g. bleaches, bleach catalysts, enzymes, brighteners and other additives, and/or produce unacceptable harshness and/or give other major problems, such as redeposition onto textiles.<br>
Another significant technical problem is a strong tendency for low-level adjuncts or differently charged additives such as cationic surfactants, catalysts or enzymes to adsorb onto relatively large, anionically charged surfaces of insoluble inorganic builders. Since such adjuncts are often expensive and tend to be used at relatively low levels in detergent compositions, their loss by any mechanism, such as interaction with the builder, can have dramatic effects on overall cleaning performance.<br>
Accordingly, substantial and costly research and experimentation are needed to integrate a synthetic inorganic builder material with other detergent ingredients so as to benefit from its properties and at the same time avoid negating or reducing the desirable effect(s) of the adjuncts with which it is formulated. Such experimentation often results in failure. There is, therefore, an ongoing unmet need for fully formulated detergent<br><br>
Compositions acceptably incorporating synthetic inorganic builders, especially cenain types for which synthesis methods have only recently been described.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
WO 98/42622, to Englehard Corporation, published October 1. 1998. provides processes for preparing certain hybrid zeolite-silicate compositions. These materials do not contain hydroxysodalite, indeed a comparison is given to demonstrate the absence thereof. Also described are some detergent formulations using the hybrid aluminosilicates. Solving the problems of formulating these hybrid builders, especially with certain potentially interacting low-level, high cost ingredients, are not. however, specifically addressed. It appears to be assumed that the hybrid zeolite-silicate can simply be formulated as a replacement for current zeolites, and the formulation teaching is to conventional zeolite detergents. However, according to the theory of operation described in WO 98/42622, the hybrid material has a higher charge. Whether for this reason or due to some other theory of operation, it has now been discovered that the WO 98/42622 hybrid matenals do not have the same properties for purposes of formulation into detergents as do the conventional detergent zeolite, zeolite A.<br>
While WO 98/42622 provides apparently useful synthesis methods, and the evidence provided in WO 98/42622 strongly suggests that the WO 98/42622 hybrid material is different from zeolite MAP. whether this hybrid or silicate-occluded material is in fact novel may, or may not, be the case. There exists a substantial body of old prior an on zeolite manufacture which is not in computer-readable form and as such is relatively difficult to find and/or search. An accessible fraction of this art includes disclosure of occluded, or hybrid-type (to use the WO 98/42622 language) zeolites or hybrid aluminosilicates having occluded salts of various kinds, and hints that occlusion is well-known to zeolite manufacturers. For example, occluded zeolites are described in "Zeolite Chemistry and Catalysis". Ed. J. A. Rabo, ACS Monograph Series. Vol. 171, American Chemical Society, Washington D.C., 1976. See more particularly Chapter 5. "Salt Occlusion in Zeolite Crystals", pages 332 - 349 and references cited therein, see also Chapter 1 of the same reference. Thus, such matenals include, for example, sodium nitrate-occluded or other nitrate salt-occluded zeolite A, see the work referenced by Liquomik and Marcus. See also Chapter 1, pages 58-63 of the same ACS monograph, which discloses, for example, NaAlO2 occluded zeolite A; other occluded aluminosilicates, such as borate-occluded sodalite, NaOH-occluded sodalite, NaXO-r occluded cancrinite, halide- or nitrate-occluded zeolite Y, and yet other salt-occluded zeolites. In Chapter 4 of the ACS monograph, it is noted "Another consequence of the<br><br>
Donnan equilibrium is that electrolyte invasion can occur. In this process, anions from the aqueous phase enter into the zeolite phase with a correspondingly equivalent number of additional cations." See also Chapter 4 of the same ACS monograph at pages 310-111. for example the statement "Modified varieties of many zeolites can be prepared by occludms extraneous species within the zeolite crystal either during or after synthesis." Reference is made to the work of Barter and others. In Chapter 5 at page 338, reference is made to borate-occluded zeolite A. In short, a wealth of occluded aluminosilicate materials appear to be disclosed in the an.<br>
Surprisingly, in contrast, other than in WO 98/42622, there appears to be no specific disclosure whatever of the use of occluded or hybrid-type zeolites or other occluded alurninosilicates in detergent compositions.<br>
It is therefore against a background of (a) an apparent plurality of occlusions in zeolites coupled with (b) a lack of teaching on how to formulate occluded or hybrid-type alurnmosiiicate materials in detergents other than as a mere substitute for zeolite A or P as taught in WO 98/42622, that the present invention is provided.<br>
Additionally by way of background on zeolites and occluded zeolites, the practitioner is referred to D.W. Breck, "Zeolite Molecular Sieves", Wiley, New York, 1974 and to Kirk Othmer's Encycopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th Edition, 1995, Wiley. New York, see Vol. 16, "Molecular Sieves".<br>
Builders in general are described in many patents issued to Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Hoechst / Clariant. Kao. Lion, Crosfield. PQ Corp., and others. One recent review in the context of detergents is in Surfactant Science Series, Marcel Dekker. New<br>

York, see Vol. 71. Ed. M.S. Showell. published 1998. See more particularly Chapter 3, "Builders: The Backbone of Powdered Detergents" by Hans-Peter Rieck of Hoechst / Clan ant.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect or embodiment of the invention, it has now been discovered that improved detergent compositions beyond those described in WO 98/42622 can be formulated by combining the hybrid zeolite-silicates of W098/42622 with particular deiergent ingredients.<br>
In a second aspect or embodiment of the invention, improved detergent compositions are formed by combining detergent ingredients with certain hybrid zeolite-<br><br>
obuilders not specifically descnbed in W098/42622. In these materials, the hybrid builder has an occluded material other than silicate, such as sulfate, borate, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, or Na-,0.<br>
in a third aspect or embodiment of the invention, improved detergent compositions are formed by combining detergent ingredients with combinations of hybrid zeolite-silicate and hybrid zeoiite-cobuilder systems wherein these combinations are not descnbed in WO98/42622. In these systems, the hybrid builder has both occluded silicate and another occluded material other than silicate, especially an anion having charge greater than 1, such as occluded sulfate, occluded borate. occluded phosphate, though occluded nitrate, occluded nitrite, or mixtures of any of the aforementioned cobuilders is possible. In other variations, alkali metal oxides or hydroxides, such as Na,0 or NaOH, are present with excellent results.<br>
In a fourth aspect or embodiment of the invention, improved detergent compositions are formed by combining detergent ingredients with any of said hybrid zeolite-silicate or hybrid zeoiite-cobuilder systems, wherein the hybrid zeolite-silicate or hybrid zeoiite-cobuilder occluded system is further modified by chemical or physical modification of the external surfaces. Such modification can range quite widely, from a chemical approach, such as surface silylation or treatment with reactive aminosilicones, to a physical approach, such as such as direct contaciing of the hybrid with PEG, e.g., PEG 4000. waxy nonionic surfactants, film-forming polymers as defined in detail hereinafter, or combinations of chemical and physical treatment. The surface treatment adjunct can improve one or more aspects of cleaning or fabric care when the treated hybrid is included in a detergent formulation. For example, the treated hybrid when formulated with low-level cationic cosurfactants, enzymes, transition metal bleach catalysts, or the like, can be shown to have a reduced tendency to interfere with the cleaning performance of such desirable adjuncts.<br>
In a fifth aspect or embodiment of the invention, improved detergent compositions are formed by combining detergent ingredients with any of said hybrid materials in the presence of innocuous fillers or common inorganic pigments, including in particular nonzeolitic aluminosilicates such as hydroxysodalite and/or talc and/or whiteners such as titanium dioxide. The hydroxysodalite or other filler or whitener or mineral can be present in the hybrid, e.g., through crystal imperfections, can be present in the builder system, or can be introduced along with other detergent adjuncts. While these filled detergent compositions might be expected to be significantly worse for cleaning than the unfilled types of compositions, they are surprisingly effective, for example in laundry bars.<br><br>
Without being limned by theory,.the absolute magnitude of the canon exchange capacity and even the rate of sequestration of builder materials are not the only factors to consider in arriving at excellent detergent compositions. Wetting and dispersion rates, and processing characteristics of the materials, for example, can also be imponani. Thus, while the introduction of materials such as hydroxysodaiite and the aforementioned surface treatments of the hybrid may not add to the technical measurable builder capacity, through these other factors, the filler and/or surface treatment material may lead to improved detergent compositions. This is particularly true when problems such as redeposition are properly addressed through coformulation of the hybrid builder with other selected detergent adjuncts.<br>
The present invention, therefore, has numerous advantages, including improved laundry cleaning and/or anti-redeposition performance and/or cost effectiveness as compared with the cleaning and/or antiredeposition performance offered by W098/42622 alone. Other significant advantages are improved compatibility of the formulated ingredients, for example, a reduced tendency of the hybrid builder to interact negatively with coformulated detergent ingredients.<br>

Equally included in the invention are detergent compositions as generally described hereinabove wherein the hybrid material has measurably different wetting and/or surface charge as compared with a non-surface treated hybrid.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of such compositions, there is encompassed herein the detergent composition wherein the hybrid material has measurably different wetting andyor surface charge as compared with a non-surface treated hybrid; and wherein said measurable difference is accomplished by a step of treating the hybrid material with PEG or a film-forming polymer.<br>
Builder system<br>
In more detail, the present invention includes detergent compositions having a builder system. A "builder system" as defined herein comprises one or more detergent ingredients known m the art as "builders", provided that there is included at least one "hybrid" or "occluded" aluminosilicate builder as defined in more detail hereinafter.<br>
In certain embodiments, the builder system differs from builder systems disclosed in W098/42622 in that the hybrid builder material is different from the hybrids of WO98/42622.<br>
In other embodiments, the builder system can be identical with those disclosed in W098/42622, however, in this circumstance, the present detergent compositions have additional improving features deriving from the selection of adjuncts and/or the method of processing.<br>
At a minimum, a "builder system" as defined herein must have at least one ingredient which helps control water hardness. "Water hardness" includes uncomplexed calcium ansing from water and/or soils on dirty fabrics; more generally and typically, "water hardness" also includes other uncomplexed cations having the potential to precipitate under alkaline conditions, especially the alkaline earths, more particularly magnesium. Well-known conventional builders include sodium tripolyphosphate, a "soluble complexing builder" which has a range of functions and benefits beyond complexation of calcium, such functions include, for example, peptizalion of inorganic soils. Another well-known builder is zeolite A, especially 0.01-10 micron zeolite A in sodium form. This builder is a relatively insoluble crystalline material, which functions by ion exchange and is sometimes termed an "ton exchanging builder". Yet another well-known builder is sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate functions as a "precipitating builder" - it reduces water hardness by forming one or more types of insoluble complex, such as calcium carbonate. Builder systems herein can in genera! include one or more<br><br>
ater-soluble complexing builders and/or one or more ion-exchanging builders and/or one or more precipitating builders, provided that an essential hybrid component as defined hereinafter is present.<br>
Art-disclosed builder systems often also include transition-metal binding matenals known as chelants. and/or organic polymers, such as sodium poiyacrylate. which have a builder function, however for the purposes of unambiguously accounting for matenals in the present formulations, the convention will be used of separately accounting for chelants and those organic polymers which have a builder function - they will be added up with separately added detergent adjuncts. This is for purposes of formula accounting and does not exclude such matenals, in practice, from being coprocessed with the "builder system", for example into high density agglomerated particles.<br>
Typical builder systems herein are further exemplified by:<br>
-	a builder system comprising a hybrid as defined hereinafter, together with a<br>
layered silicate and sodium carbonate;<br>
-	a builder system comprising a hybrid as defined hereinafter, together with<br>
sodium tnpolyphosphate;<br>
-	a builder system comprising a hybrid as defined hereinafter, together with<br>
sodium   carbonate  and   a  member  selected   from   the   group  consisting  of sodium<br>
oxydisuccinate,  sodium  carboxymethyloxysuccinate,  sodium  nitrilotriacetate,  sodium<br>
citrate, and mixtures thereof;<br>
-	a builder system comprising a hybrid as defined hereinafter, together with zeolite<br>
A and sodium carbonate; and<br>
-	a builder system comprising a hybrid as defined hereinafter having a film-<br>
forming polymeric coating, optionally together with one or more of zeolite A, sodium<br>
carbonate, and sodium citrate (recall that in such a case, the level of polymer for formula<br>
accounting purposes is accounted into the detergent adjunct outside of the builder<br>
system).<br>
In terms of essential component, the detergent compositions and builder systems herein are required to include at least one crystalline, paniculate, inorganic ion exchanging builder material comprising a hybrid of crystalline zeolitic aluminosilicate and at least one occluded cobuilder. The term "hybrid" indicates that the aluminosilicate and cobuilder are integrated into the same crystal, as distinct from a simple mixture of separate crystals of the components. The term "occluded" further particularizes the location of one material relative to the other by specifying that the cobuilder is included into rather than simply externally onto the aluminosilicate crystals. The term "hybrid" may be used herein as a shorthand; when unqualified, it encompasses all suitable<br><br>
particulate crystalline aluminosilicates. having whatever kind of occluded material which helps detergent performance.<br>
in alternate terms, "hybrid" or "occluded" builder materials herein also encompasses all those zeolite compositions comprising both a cobuilder and a zeolite useful as a builder, provided that the composition is the product of a process comprising the step of adding an aluminum source to a concentrated silicate solution or silicate -cobuilder solution having a pH above 12, said silicate solution or silicate-cobuilder solution having been at least partially depolymenzed, preferably by heating, prior to the addition of said aluminum source. In such compositions, the cobuilder may vary widely, and includes phosphate, carbonate, borate, nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, Na,O. NaOH and mixtures thereof. This alternate definition emphasizes that the present invention is not limited to a particular theory of operation.<br>
In general, the hybnd builder materials herein can be categorized into a number of distinct classes, depending on the material that is occluded into the aluminosilicate crystals.<br>
(a)	hybrids comprising occluded silicate;<br>
(b)	hybrids comprising occluded nonsilicate cobuilder;<br>
(c)	hybrids comprising both occluded silicate and occluded nonsilicate<br>
cobuilder.<br>
The hybrid builder materials can further vary depending on the crystal type, thus hybrids herein can in general be hybrids based on a zeolite A crystal type, a zeolite P or gismondine crystal type, AX type, or any other crystal type known to be associated with ion-exchanging aluminosilicate materials.<br>
Hybrids comprising occluded silicate include those of WO 98/42622. Engelhard, which are disclosed in detail hereinafter.<br>
Hybrids comprising occluded nonsilicate cobuilder include the paniculate crystalline aluminosilicates having occluded material selected the group consisting of occluded phosphate, occluded carbonate, occluded borate, occluded nitrate, occluded nitrite, occluded sulfate, occluded Na,0, occluded NaOH and mixtures thereof. The adjective "occluded" is used to emphasize that not only is the selected material to be present, it must be located in the aluminosilicate crystals. The precise location may vary, though in most instances, it is believed that at least a portion of the occluded material lies outside the smallest zeolite cages while lying at least in part inside the larger zeolite cages.<br>
Mixtures of hybrids can in general be used in any proportion. Such mixtures include mixtures of a hybrid according to WO 98/42622 with mixtures of a hybrid<br><br>
varying from WO 98/42622 through possession of at least one of (i) a different, nonsilicate occluded cobuilder or fin a distinct crystal type as compared with WO 98/42622.<br>
Hybrid materials herein can have a range of panicle sizes; primary crystals in the size range of from about 0.01 to about 20 microns being suitable, from about 1 micron to about 10 micron and having a good ability to diffract X-rays being preferred. Such primary crystals can be agglomerated into larger aggregates to minimize dusting andyor segregation in fully-formulated laundry detergents. All hybrids herein can in general van-in primary crystallite size and degree of crystal perfection.<br>
Hybrid materials herein can have a range of occluded cobuilder content, for example from about 0.001 to about 1.0 number fraction of available occlusion sites can be occupied by occluded cobuilder. Hybrids having combinations of occluded and adsorbed cobuilder are possible.<br>
Hybrid materials herein can have varying cation composition, for example including hydrogen or ammonium or even in pan calcium or magnesium, though typically the preferred cation is sodium. Potassium or lithium, if present, will be in rather limited proponion, e.g., less than about 0.01% of available exchangeable sites. Charge-balancing amounts of such cations can be present, or sub-charge balancing amounts, for example when the hybrid material is extensively washed in pure water.<br>
Hybrid materials herein can optionally have adsorbed or occluded organic adjuncts, such as perfumes. Wherever located in a manufactured formulation, perfumes, like organic polymeric builders or chelants, are added up, for formula accounting purposes, outside of the builder system.<br>
Hybrid materials herein can have varying degree of hydration, for example if used in detergent compositions which arc aqueous suspensions, they can be fully hydrated. In other nonlimiting examples, if the hybrid material is incorporated in a nonaqueous liquid detergent, a high-density granular detergent comprising bleach or bleach precursor, or a composition comprising a hydrolytically labile perfume precursor or pro-perfume, the hybrid material may be anhydrous or only panially hydrated.<br>
Preferred hybrid builders having occluded nonsilicate cobuilder herein have occluded matenals which are typically relatively small inorganic anions, e.g., occluded phosphate, occluded carbonate, occluded borate, occluded nitrate, occluded nitrite, occluded sulfate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
A preferred group of hybrid builders having occluded nonsilicate cobuilder have occluded materials which have an anionic charge greater than one, e.g., occluded phosphate, occluded carbonate, occluded sulfate, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
A preferred group of hybrid builders having occluded nonsilicate cobuilder have occluded materials which are phosphorus-free and boron-free, e.g., occluded carbonate, occluded nitrate, occluded nitnte. occluded sulfate, and mixtures thereof,<br>
A preferred group of hybrid builders having occluded nonsilicate cobuilder have occluded materials which are nitrite-free, e.g., occluded carbonate, occluded nitrate, occluded sulfate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Another preferred group of hybrid builders having occluded nonsilicate cobuilder have occluded materials which are nitrate-free, nitrite-free, boron-free and phosphorus-free, e.g.. occluded carbonate, occluded sulfate. occluded Na20, occluded NaOH and mixtures thereof.<br>
Unless otherwise noted, hybrid builder herein is characterized by at least one of:<br>
(1)D a 5-minute rate of calcium sequestration at least 15%, preferably at least 20%, more preferably at least 25% greater than that of zeolite A having comparable crystal size; and/or<br>
(ii) a 15-minute or equilibrium capacity to sequester calcium in excess of the amouni of charge inducing aluminum in the zeolitic aluminosilicate. Alternately, said hybrid is characterized by a 15-minute or equilibrium calcium ion exchange capacity of at least 15% greater, preferably at least 20%. more preferably at least 25% greater than the calcium ion exchange capacity of a reference material selected from non-hybridized zeolite A. Such reference zeolite A in fully Na-exchanged form has a theoretical cation exchange capacity of about 7 meq/g, typically 5-7 meq/g e.g. 6 meq/g in practice wherein the abbreviation "meq/g" stands for milliequivalents per gram. Such material for reference purposes suitably has a panicle size of from about -1 micron to about 10 microns.<br>
See, for example, the methods disclosed in WO 98/42622 and further detailed hereinafter, especially Table 1 and the discussion of percentage improvement following immediately thereafter which illustrate how the above-identified percentages are to be calculated.<br>
Levels of builder system in the completed laundry detergent powder, syndet bar, gel, tablet or pouch can van1 widely, for example from 0.1% to about 99% of a builder system comprising the essential hybrid material. The proportion of the hybrid aluminosilicate builder material can likewise vary, comprising from about 0.01 to 1.0, more preferably 0.10 to 1.0, weight fraction of the builder system.<br>
Hybrid Aluminosilicate Not According to WO 98/42622<br>
It is to be emphasized that the present invention includes embodiments in which, by way of hybrid material, only hybrid alummosilicates not according to WO 98/42622<br><br>
are used as an essential component. These hybrids in general can be selected in any proportion from:<br>
(i) silicate-containing hybnds of zeolites having crystal type which differs by X-ray diffraction from those disclosed in WO 98/42622 and<br>
(ii) hybnds of a crystalline alummosilicate and at least one non-silica or nonsilicate occluded cobuilder. Preferably this cobuilder is selected from the group consisting, of phosphate, carbonate, borate, nitrate, nitrite, sulfate. Na,0. NaOH and mixtures thereof.<br>
Of course, combinations of silicate-type hybnds as per WO 98/42622 and hybnds having nonsilicate cobuilder selected from the group consisting of phosphate, carbonate, borate. nitrate, nitnte, sulfate, Na20 and mixtures thereof in all proportions are also encompassed.<br>
The hybrids not according to WO 98/42622 herein generally include those known in the an of zeolite manufacture, see for example "Zeolite Chemistry and Catalysis", Ed. J. A. Rabo. ACS Monograph Senes, Vol. 171, American Chemical Society. Washington D.C.. 1976. incorporated herein by reference. See more particularly the same Volume, Chapter 5, "Salt Occlusion in Zeolite Crystals", pages 332 - 349 and references cited therein. Such materials include, for example, borate-occluded, hydroxide-occluded, or nitrate- or other nitrate salt-occluded zeolite A. See, for example, the work by Barrer, or by Liquornik and Marcus referred to in the cited standard texts. The occluded salt molecules may, or may not penetrate the sodalite cages of the zeolite, and can be arranged in the larger cages. In general, the occlusion may be of the so-called reversible type, or may be non-reversible.<br>
Occlusion for the present purposes is best conducted with sodium as cation and without a transition-metal as the cation, though more generally, transition-metal or silver cation occluded variations are possible and can have beneficial effects, such as enhancement of antimicrobial activity of a detergent composition. In addition to occlusion of carbonate, nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, phosphate, borate, mixtures thereof, and mixtures thereof with silicate in any proportion, the present invention also encompasses occlusion of Na:0 in zeolites, such as Na:0-occluded zeolite A. It is known that certain zeolites tend to decompose nitrate catalytically to NaNO: (chabazite and mordenite) and even to produce Na:O.<br>
The hybrid aluminosilicates herein can be prepared by any known method, see for example the ACS monograph cited supra and references therein, such methods can be aqueous-based, for example using the above-identified anions in a method otherwise<br><br>
similar to the Engelhard WO 98/42622 method or variations thereof, or can be non-aqueous or melt-based methods.<br>
Preferred hybrids and combinations include those wherein the zeolite is zeolite A. B, P. X. AX or MAP; sodium is the sole cation; and the occluded cobuilder is selected from carbonate, hydroxide and Na20.<br>
Suitable levels are from about 0.1% to about 80%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 30%, by weight, of the hybrid alummosilicate when it is used alone.<br>
Suitable levels of a builder system in the present detergent compositions are from about 0.1% to about 85%, preferably from about 1% to about 40%. by weight.<br>
Builders other than the hybrid aluminosilicate are conventional and can. for example, be selected from water-soluble organic builders such as 2,2'-oxydisuccinate sodium salts, citric acid sodium salts, carboxymethyloxysuccinate sodium salts, nitnlotriacetic acid sodium salts and the like; water-insoluble inorganic builders such as zeolites A. P. B, X, or any of their modifications, water-soluble organic builders such as various cellulosic polymers, and water-soluble inorganic builders such as sodium carbonates, sodium phosphates, sodium tripolyphosphates and the like, encompassing a wide range of calcium and/or magnesium binding capability and rate. The builder system can be complemented by one or more materials known as chelants, (chelants like, organic polymers, being added up separately in the formula accounting and being materials which generally have the capability to strongly bind transition metal ions or colloidal transition metal precipitates in aqueous alkaline media). Chelants suitable for use herein include ethylenediamine disuccinate sodium salts, EDTA, HEDP, DTPA and mixtures thereof; typical levels are in the range of from about 1 ppm to about 2% by weight of the detergent composition.<br>
Hvbrid Aiuminosilicate Component according to WO 98/42622<br>
The present invention includes embodiments in which a particular hybnd aluminosilicate according to WO 98/42622 is used as an essential component. This hybrid matenal can be obtained from Engelhard Corp. It is a crystalline zeolitic aluminosilicate having occluded silicate, and in WO 98/42622 it is termed a "hybrid zeolite/silica composition" (HZSC). The terms "aluminosilicate having occluded silica", "aluminosilicate having occluded silicate", "hybrid zeolite/silica composition", and the acronym "HZSC" are used interchangeably.<br>
According to WO 98/42622, HZSC materials may be prepared by-crystallizing high aluminum zeolites in highly alkaline/high silica environments. Chemical analysis indicates an excess of silica tn the HZSC beyond that inherent to their crystalline frameworks. Such materials, at least in certain cases, demonstrate sequestration capacities<br><br>
cations such as calcium which exceed the amount of zeolitic aluminum available for ion-exchange and even exceed the theoretical limit possible for a zeolite. Thus. HZSC materials and their properties are potentially different both in degree and in kind from those of a conventional zeolite.<br>
According to the inventors of WO 98/42622, the "key mechanism in the effectiveness of HZSC materials is derived from the ability of zeolite cages to isolate and stabilize small, highly charged silicate units." The inventors of the present invention remark thai alternative theories can be advanced, for example it is known that small cobuilder polyanions (in this case silicate) can reduce electrostatic repulsions between cations in alummosilicates. This can stabilize both sodium-exchanged and calcium-exchanged occluded alummosilicates relative to the non-occluded aluminosilicates. Such theory would be broadly consistent with the compositional description of HZSC. While less likely in view of the WO 98/42622 data, sodium metasilicate, if intimately mixed with zeolite, could alternately provide compositions, effectively made by the processes of WO 98/42622. which act more effectively than builder compositions hitherto available, for example by an improved concerted action as a precipitating cobuilder. together with the zeolite. Theory should therefore not be considered limiting of the present invention. Rather, the value of WO 98/42622 as a source of builder for the present invention may lie to a greater extent in the product of the described processes than in the precise mode of description of the compositions.<br>
The above cautions notwithstanding, WO 98/42622 discloses that silicate units are introduced during synthesis of HZSC by providing an environment wherein silica in the reaction mixture is depolymerized to highly charged predominantly monomenc units before crystallization begins. The occluded silicate units of the HZSC are visible in 29Si NMR spectra. The HZSC as a whole is stated to be "more powerful" in complexing multivalem cations than are existing zeolites, silicates or mixtures thereof. The zeolite framework and occluded silicate units are stated to "act in concert, as a new type of hybrid composition, showing properties neither zeolites, silicates nor physical blends of the two demonstrate". In addition to high capacity for ion exchange, the HZSC's demonstrate unusually rapid rates of sequestration, important in applications such as detergent building.<br>
By way of technical background, but without being limited by theory, the sequestration properties of zeolites arises from their ability to ion-exchange. The ion-exchange ability derives from isomorphous substitution of Al(III) for Si(IV) in classical zeolite frameworks which results in a net excess of negative charge in the aluminosilicate framework. This requires counterbalancing by the inclusion of exchangeable cations.<br><br>
Excess charge, and thus exchange capacity, is a function of aluminum content "Detergent" zeolites, according to WO 98/42622. have hitherto been restricted to the relatively short list of "high aluminum" zeolites. By Lowenstein's Rule, the Si/Al ratio of a zeolite may not be lower than 1.0 and concomitantly, the aluminum content may not exceed 7.0 meq per gram for an anhydrous material in the sodium form. This capacity may alternatively be expressed as 197 mg CaO per gram zeolite (anhydrous) when water softening is the desired exchange reaction. Zeolites demonstrating this maximum aluminum content include Zeolite A, high aluminum analogs of Zeolite X and hish aluminum analogs of gismondine (often referred to as Zeolite B, P or MAP).<br>
Also according to WO 98/42622. while Zeolite A has been the "detergent zeolite" of choice for years, the possibility of employing a high aluminum version of gismondme-type materials in calcium sequestration has been known for more than a generation (USP 3.112,176 Haden et al.) and has recently found renewed interest (for example, USP 5.512.266 Brown, et al.). In addition to zeolites, the ability of silicates to complex ions such as calcium and especially magnesium has long been known and sodium silicate has long been employed as a cheap, low performance detergent builder. More recently, complex silicates such as Hoechst SKS-6 have been developed which are claimed to be competitive with higher performance zeolites.<br>
Moreover, according to WO 98/42622, the capacity for silicates to complex ions such as calcium and magnesium is inversely proportional to silicate chain length and directly proportional to the electronic charge on that chain fragment. Silicates depolymerize with increasing alkalinity (See Fig. 1 of WO 98/42622). At moderate pH (where wash cycles are conducted) silicates are polymeric. However, at much higher pH's silica not only becomes predominantly monomenc, but also that monomer may possess multiple charges. If such small, highly charged fragments could be exposed to solutions bearing multivalent cations, very powerful high capacity sequestration agents would result. The inventors of WO 98/42622 assert that they have created such a situation by isolating and stabilizing substantial concentrations of such species within zeolite cages where ions such as calcium and magnesium are free to enter from an aqueous environment (such as wash water) and react with these powerful sequestration agents.<br>
WO 98/42622 further discloses that HZSC compositions can be prepared by reacting a finely divided aluminum source such as a dned aluminosilicate gel or powdered gibbsite and more preferably finely divided metakaolin with concentrated silicate solutions at pH values above 12 at temperatures ranging from about ambient to about 100°C and at atmospheric pressure. It is crucial for the preparation of the HZSC compositions that the aluminum source must be added last to the reaction mixture. Thus,<br><br>
if all the ingredients of the reaction mixture are added together and heated to crystallization temperature, a conventional zeolite of the pnor an will be formed, and the HZSC materials of WO 98/42622 will not be formed.<br>
According to WO 98/42622. it is even more desirable to prepare HZSC compositions by heating the reaction mixture at temperatures of from 50°C to 85°C before the addition of the aluminum source for a period of time of about 30 minutes or longer. While not wishing to be bound by any theory of operation, it appears that heatina the reaction mixture for about 30 minutes pnor to aluminum addition allows the silicate to depolymenze and form the predominantly occluded silicate units previously discussed.<br>
According to WO 98/42622. HZSC's can also be prepared by reacting finely divided metakaolm with concentrated sodium silicate solutions at pH values above 12 at temperatures ranging from about ambient to about 100°C and at atmosphenc pressure.<br>
WO 98/42622 also states a preference to use high purity metakaolins. especially those low in iron and mania, when color is a consideration. For example, metakaolin having an Fe:O, content below 1%, preferably below 0.5% by weight and a TiO: content below 2% by weight preferably below 1% by weight are useful. The metakaolin should be in powder form. These powders may be prepared by removing grit and coarse impurities from kaolin ores, usually fractionating the degritted crude, drying the resulting slurry of fractionated hydrous kaolin, pulvenzing the dried material, calcining in conventional manner to produce metakaolin (see. for example. U.S. 3,112.176 (Haden et al.)), and pulvenzing the metakaolin by means of a hammer mill or the like. U.S. 3,014,836 Proctor et al. is cross-referenced herein for its disclosure of producing calcined kaolin pigments from an acidic (bleached) filter cake of kaolin by steps including drying, pulverizing, calcining and repulverizing; in practice of this invention the procedures of Proctor et a! must be modified by using lower calcination temperature to produce the desired metakaolin form of calcined clay. The kaolin ore may be upgraded by means such as froth flotation, magnetic purification, selective flocculation, mechanical delamination, grinding or combinations thereof before drying, pulverization, calcination and repulverization. In many commercial operations, a chemically dispersed slip of the kaolin is dried in a spray dryer, forming microspheres. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,586,523 Fanselow et al. The resulting microspheres of hydrous (uncalcined) kaolin are then pulverized, calcined and repulvenzed, as taught in the patent of Fanselow et al.<br>
Further according to WO 98/42622, the particle sizes of the hydrous kaoiinite precursor of the metakaolin starting material affect the size of the HZSC product. Since HZSC products having a fine particle size are usually preferred, fine particle size metakaolins obtained from fine panicle size hydrous kaolins are recommended. These<br><br>
article sizes are mosi frequently measured by kaolin producers as values obtained by sedimentation, typically using a Sedigraph® 5100 analyzer (supplied by Micromeretics Corporation) and the values are reported as "equivalent spherical diameter" (e.s.d.). Use of other measuring instruments may give somewhat different values. In Example 3 of WO 98/42622, reproduced below as "HZSC Synthesis Example 1", illustrative of the WO 98/42622 process, typical samples of the hydrous kaolin precursor of the metakaolin are about 90% by weight finer than 1 micron, e.s.d., as measured using the Sedigraph® 5100 instrument. The high brightness hydrous kaolin used in this example can be prepared from a coarse white Georgia kaolin crude by steps composing degritting, froth flotation to remove colored impurities, mechanical delammation and fractionation. The fractionated product, about 90% by weight finer than 1 micron e.s.d., can be recovered as a dispersed fluid aqueous slip that can be spray dried, pulverized, calcined to metakaolin condition and repulvenzed. The panicle size of the repulverized metakaolm is coarser than that of the hydrous kaolin.<br>
HZSC compositions of WO 98/42622 can moreover be prepared by synthesizing those zeolitic molecular sieves that have a high Al:0,/SiO2 molar ratio, e.g., SiOVAKO-, molar ratios in the range of 2 to 3 according to the teachings of the prior art, with the crucial exception that the aluminum source is added last to the reaction mixture. Species include type P (also referred to as type B). zeolite A. high alumina X types and chabazite analogs.<br>
After crystallization, the zeolite crystals are washed thoroughly with water, preferably deionized water, to remove sodium and spurious silica from the crystal surfaces. In some cases, some replacement of sodium by hydrogen may take place during washing. The crystals can be washed with solutions other than those of pure water.<br>
About 5 to 40% of the silica content of the washed crystals is due to the occluded silicate species, usually to 20%. Thus, the total SiO2 analysis as determined by conventional chemical analytical means will exceed that of the SiO: that would be expected based on the framework silica content as indicated by x-ray powder patterns and :"Si NMR analysis of the HZSC composition. The occluded silicate portion of this silica is readily ascertained from the :"Si NMR peaks at about -81 to -85 ppm.<br>
"Si NMR has become a standard technique in the analysis of zeolites. The utility of this technique is based on the fact that different frequencies correspond to different electronic environments around the silicon, typically affected in zeolites by the chemistry of neighboring atoms and/or Si-O bond angles. :vSi NMR detects all the Si. not just that which is associated with long-range crystallinity. This makes it sensitive to species that may not be detected by XRD.<br><br>
HZSC Synthesis Example 1 (see Example 3 of WO 98/42622)<br>
In order to prepare an improved builder, termed a Hybrid Zeolite-Siiica Composition (HZSC). based on a gismondine-type aluminosihcate. the following procedure is applied:<br>
1000 grams of fine panicle size meiakaolin obtained by calcining an uhrafine mechanically delaminated ground hydrous kaolin (90% by weight finer than 1 micron, e.s.d.), followed by pulverization is used. The powdered metakaolin is blended into an alkaline silicate solution containing 702 grams of N- Brand® sodium silicate solution and 1064 grams of NaOH in 4800 grams of deiomzed water which have been mixed and preheated to 72°C. The mixture is then reacted with vigorous stimng at 72°C for eight hours at ambient pressure in an open stainless steel vessel. The crystalline product of the reaction is filtered and washed three times with 2000-ml lots of 72°C deionized water. The crystalline product is dried in a forced air oven at 100°C. overnight. The crystalline product is analyzed and found to have a gross chemical Si/Al molar ratio of approximately 1.15 (SiO2/AUO, = 2.30) . AN XRD powder pattern essentially identical to that of WO 98/42622 Ex:/ample 1 and 2 (characteristic of gismondine-type zeolites) is obtained, This material is a HZSC (Hybrid Zeolite-Silica Composition) in accordance with WO 98/42622.<br>
Additionally, the sodium content of this material as synthesized is found to be essentially equal to that of the silica (Na/Si =1.01). and to be substantially above the aluminum content on a molar basis (Na/A! = 1.16). Generally, the aluminum content of a zeolite is expected to equal its cationic content in that each framework aluminum induces one net negative framework charge which is counterbalanced by cations in order to maintain electroneutrality. Extra sodium is a characteristic of HZSC and is believed to be the result of sodium in association with the occluded silicate species.<br>
The average particle size (50% by weight finer than) of the crystalline product is 5.5 microns as determined by a Sedigraph® 5100.<br>
HZSC Synthesis Example 2 - See (see Example 10 of WO 98/42622)<br>
In order to synthesize an improved builder, termed a Hybrid Zeolite-Silica Composition, in this example based on a Zeolite A framework, an HZSC material is prepared by the following procedure:<br>
An alkaline silicate solution is prepared by dissolving 175.0 grams of NaOH and 99.0 grams of N-Brand® sodium silicate in 522.8 grams deionized water. After mixing and preheating the mixture to 80°C, 109.5 grams Metamax® metakaolin are added and the mixture reacted by stirring for one hour at 80°C. in a constant temperature bath. The resultant product is filtered and washed three times with 1000-ml lots of deionized water.<br><br>
sample is then dned overnight in a forced air oven at 100°C. The product of this example demonstrates a strong, clean XRD powder pattern characteristic of Zeolite A. This material is then subjected to the hardness sequestration test of WO 98/42622 Example 7. The 15 second and 15 minute hardness removal readings are 43% and 51°/0 respectively, showing that hardness sequestration is remarkably faster and substantially more thorough than that of unmodified Zeolite A. The hybrid composition offers substantial advantages over comparable zeolites in both rate and amount of hardness removal.<br>
HZSC Synthesis Example 3 (see Example 13 of WO 98/42622)<br>
In order to prepare an improved builder, termed a HZSC, based on a gismondme-type structure, the following procedure is followed:<br>
An identical synthesis mixture to that of WO 98/42622 Example 12 is prepared but in a different order of addition/reaction. Thus. 74.97 pounds of deionized water, 42.7 pounds of 50°/o NaOH solution and 14.12 pounds of N-brand Sodium silicate are combined and heated under agitation to 72°C in a stainless steel reactor. After an equilibration period of 30 minutes to allow silicate depolymerization, 20.0 pounds of Luminex brand metakaolin are added and the-mixture reacted under vigorous agitation for 8 hours at 72° C. After the reaction penod, the product is washed and filtered on several large pan filters including multiple reslumes and rinses with substantial excess of deionized water.<br>
The powder XRD pattern for this product is that of a highly crystalline material of a gismondine-type structure, consistent with that of WO 98/42622 Example 12. However, unlike Example 12 of WO 98/42622, :"Si NMR shows a clear shoulder to the mam peak at -81 to-85 ppm which is characteristic of an HZSC. Additionally, elemental analysis indicates the characteristic elevated Si/Al ratio (Si/Al = 1.20) and sodium levels approaching molar silicon contents (Na/Si - 1.01) and the characteristic excess of sodium to aluminum on a molar basis (Na/Al 1.21).<br>
With the NMR indication of occluded silicate, exhaustive calcium exchange is conducted as in WO 98/42622 Example 12. Analysis of the exhaustively exchanged sample yields 23.8% CaO, 43.2% SiO: and 31.4% AI,03 on a dry weight basis. Thus, the material contains approximately 7.20 meq/g Si, 6.16 meq/g Al and 8.49 meq/g Ca. The Ca/'Al meq/g ratio approaching 1.4 is consistent with that of an HZSC and not consistent with that of a zeolite which is limited to 1.0. The calcium capacity approaching 8.5 meq/g is consistent with an HZSC and inconsistent with the 7.0 meq/g theoretical limit noted for zeolites.<br><br>
The produci of this example is an HZSC and not merely a high aluminum version of Zeolite P as prepared in WO 98/42622 Example 12 in spue of the fact that both are preparable using identical reactants, reaction times and temperatures and crystallization/washing equipment. It is therefore apparent that the order of reactam addition and probably full depolymenzation of silicate are imperative in the formation of HZSC.<br>
HZSC Synthesis Example 4 (see Example 14 of WO 98/42622)<br>
In order to prepare an improved builder, termed a HZSC, based on a gismondine-type structure, and to demonstrate that aluminum sources other than metakaolin may be employed in the formation of HZSC. the following procedure is followed:<br>
An alummosilicate gel with gross composition approaching 1:1 Si/Al is prepared by dissolving 2.95 kg of NaAlO:, in 14. 0 kg deiomzed water. To this is added 7.45 kg N-Brand® sodium silicate. The resultant gel is beaten with a high shear blade to a homogeneous appearing consistency. The homogenized gel is poured into stainless steel pans and is dried in an oven overnight at 100° C. A portion of this dried gel is pulverized and employed as dried alummosilicate reactant. Thus, 89 grams of NaOH and 88 grams of N-Brand® sodium silicate are dissolved in 600 grams of deionized water and brought to a temperature of 72° C under agitation. After equilibrating, 160 grams of the dried gel alummosilicate reactant are added to the mixture under agitation and crystallized at 72° C for 5.5 hours. The sample is washed and vacuum filtered with an excess of deionized water and dried at 100° C overnight. The XRD powder pattern for this material is that of a highly crystalline gismondine-type structure. The :9Si NMR spectrum shows a clear shoulder to the main peak at -81 to -85 ppm, characteristic of HZSC.<br>
The HZSC material produced in accordance with this example is tested in accordance with the procedure set forth in WO 98/42622 Example 7.<br>
The results obtained indicate that the material obtained by this example possess the same rapid cation exchange removal i.e. 48% in 15 seconds and 82% in 15 minutes as is possessed by the novel material of WO 98/42622 Example 3 (HZSC Synthesis Example 1 supra). Thus, this .example establishes that aluminum sources other than metakaolin may be employed in the synthesis of HZSC materials.<br>
Equilibrium ion exchange capacity of a HZSC.(see WO 98/42622 Example 5) The full sequestration capacity of the crystalline product of HZSC Synthesis Example 1 (WO 98/42622 Example 3) at pH 10 (typical of wash water) is established by exchanging 3.0 grams of the material twice with 6.0 grams of CaC1,.2H,0 dissolved in 400 ml deionized water. The exchanges are each conducted for approximately 45 minutes at a temperature of 100°C. The sample is filtered and washed six times with<br><br>
oporoximaiely 100 cc deiomzed water to remove any spurious CaCL The sample is then dried at ]00°C. for approximately 12 hours. The sample is then subjected to conventional X-ray fluorescence chemical analysis techniques. The analysis reveals 23.5 weight % CaO, 42.0 weight % SiO,, 31.9 weight % AU03 and approximately 1.0 % other materials on a dry weight basis. Thus, the material contains 7.0 meq/g Si. 6.26 meq/g Al and 8.37 meq/g Ca. Not only does this indicate 34% more calcium than can be accounted for bv exchange with the available aluminum, it is nearly 20% greater than the 7.0 meq capacity theoretically possible for ion-exchange into a maximum aluminum zeolite, In terms of mti CaO/g anhydrous zeolite (as in the Henkel test) this is a capacity of 236, well above the theoretical zeolite maximum of 197. Clearly, zeolite ion-exchange is not the only-sequestration mechanism operating for the HZSC.<br>
The Synthesis Examples supra demonstrate the preparation of the WO 98/42622 materials denoted "HZSC" for Hybrid Zeolite-Silica Compositions which demonstrate remarkable speed and thoroughness of multivalent cation complexation. This is especially useful in water softening/detergent building applications. These properties are asserted in WO 98/42622 to denve from the ability of zeolite cages to occlude small, highly charged silicate species. Whatever the theory with respect to the structure of these compositions, the zeolite and entrained or occluded silicate appear to act in concert as a hybrid composition showing properties that neither zeolites, specifically tested silicates, nor physical blends of the two demonstrate.<br>
In order to further demonstrate that the HZSC :'Si NMR peaks at about -SI to -85 ppm are due to occluded silicate in HZSC compositions, samples of 2 MAP products marketed by Crosfield under the tradenames Zeocros 180 and Doucil A- 24 are obtained and tested as received. XRD powder patterns for both samples indicate measurable hydroxysodalite as evidenced by peaks at 14.0, 24.3 and 25.1 degrees 2 theta. WO 98/42622 Figures 4a. b. A sample of high aluminum zeolite P made in accordance with the method of Haden (U. S. Patent 3.112.176) is found to contain no discernible sodalite as determined by XRD. Representative samples of HZSC, including those of WO 98/42622 Examples 3 and 13, are examined by XRD and in no case is measurable sodalite present.<br>
Pure zeolite MAP as prepared by the Haden method is subjected to :<jsi nmr analysis. it is found free of the shoulder at to ppm characteristic hzsc wo figure></jsi>
In a publication by Carr. S. W., Gore, B. and Anderson, M. W., Chem Mater. 1997, Vol. 9, pgs. 1927- 1932, it has been noted that as-received Crosfield zeolite MAPs contain an NMR shoulder near that characteristic of HZSC. With no such shoulder<br><br>
present in the pure MAP of Haden. an alternative explanation to Carr et al's claim of the shoulder being due to surface hydroxyl groups was sought by the inventors of WO 98/42622. Thus, they obtained a sample of hydroxysodalite and found it to have i larse NMR peak centered at about -85.0 ppm. Published values for sodalite vary from about -83.5 to -85 ppm. with the variation largely due to the exact degree of hydration {see High Resolution Solid State NMR of Silicates and Zeolites, G. Engelhardt and D. Michel. John Wiley &amp;_Sons. Chichester. 1987). This hydroxysodalite was added by the WO 98/42622 inventors at a 1% level to the pure MAP and resulted in an XRD pattern, WO 98/42622 Figure 4c. essentially identical to the sodalite-contaminated MAP of the commercial Crosfseld products. WO 98/42622 Figures 4a, b. The WO 98/42622 inventors subjected this mixture to •'Si NMR analysis and contrasted it to the pure MAP of Haden, sodalite contaminated Crosfield MAP. and HZSC of WO 98/42622 Example 3. Pure MAP has no shoulder in the region of -83 ppm. noted by Carr et al.. (WO 98/42622 Figure 5a). Addition of 1% sodalite yielded a spectrum. WO 98/42622 Figure 5c. with the shoulder essentially identical (although weaker) to that of the sodalite-contaminated Crosfield product, WO 98/42622 Figure 5d. Thus, the most reasonable explanation for Carr et al's observations is sodalite contamination in the as-received Crosfield MAPs. HZSC is free of these contaminants and yet still contains the characteristic NMR shoulder. It is most reasonable to assign this shoulder to occluded silicates which are also expected in this regime as no sodalite is present.<br>
Hardness Sequestration Rate (See WO 98/42622 Example 1} In order to assess the relative performance of HZSC-type matenals versus zeolite as water softening agents in mixtures resembling wash water, sequestration tests are conducted in mixed calcium/magnesium solutions at 35°C. and pH 10. 1.5 liter charges of 1.03 molar calcium plus magnesium solutions are buffered with glycine solutions to a pH of 10. The Ca:Mg molar ratio is established at 3:1. The test hardness solutions are heated to 35°C. in a constant temperature bath at which point 0.45 gram charges of air-equilibrated HZSC or reference builders are added and the test mixtures agitated by an overhead stirrer at a rate of 200 rpm. Total hardness concentration is monitored by an Orion Model 9332BN total hardness electrode connected to an Onon Model 720A pH meter. Both the "instantaneous" and "equilibrium" hardness removal of a builder can be critical parameters depending upon the particular environment in which they are employed. Hardness removal at 15 seconds is taken as indicative of "instantaneous" hardness removal and readings at 15 minutes are taken as a measurement of "equilibrium" properties.<br><br>

HZSC maienals as well as reference materials are subjected to this test and the results are summarized as Table 1.<br>
TABLE 1<br>
Timed Hardness Removal by HZSC-type builders and some reference<br>
materials<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
* gismondme-type hybrid with occluded silicate ** zeolite A-type hybrid with occluded silicate<br>
Reference Materials (See WO 98/42622)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Note with respect to percentage improvement levels discussed hereinabove. HZSC1 and HZSC3 have a 15-second hardness removal improvement, as compared with zeolite A, of ((48- 10)/10)x 100= 380.0%. HZSC1 and HZSC3 have a 15-mmute hardness removal improvement, as compared with zeolite A, of ((82 - 41) / 41) x 100 = 100.0%.<br>
This test indicates that HZSC maienals at 15 seconds are more rapid than the reference materials (conventional zeolites) and, at least in the case of HZSC having gismondine-type structure, have improved 15-mmute removal data than the reference materials. Note, however, that if the HZSC materials have reduced crystal size relative to the reference materials, an improvement in 15 sec hardness removal is expected. Since, for the zeolite A-type HZSC, the 15-mmute removal data is not substantially improved over the reference materials, this leaves some question as to the value of the overall water-softening improvement offered by the zeolite A-type HZSC. Such overall value is, however, not only a function of water softening in a simple test as given above, but also is dependent on the effective cleaning performance in a fully-formulated laundry detergent. This latter performance is affected by the presence of laundry detergent adjuncts. In short, the manufacturer of builder maienals is in a position to suggest builder materials to be<br><br>
evaluated by the detergent formulator. but is not well-placed to accurately predict throuch simple tests which materials are most effective in practice. Detergent compositions<br>
Detergent compositions of the present invention include a builder system that comprises, at least in pan, the hybrid alummosilicate as hereinbefore described, together with specified detergent adjuncts.<br>
When the builder system does not differ from WO 98/42622, the present inventive detergent compositions are required to constitute a combination of a WO 98/42622 hybrid material and at least one selected detergent adjunct not disclosed or suggested in WO 98/42622. These selected adjuncts, especially advantageous in conjunction with hybnd builders, are described in detail hereinafter as "Class I detergent adjuncts".<br>
When the builder system differs from one disclosed in WO 98/42622. more particularly, when the hybrid builder material is not one specifically disclosed in WO 98/42622. the present inventive detergent compositions comprise at least the hybnd builder material and one or more broadly defined detergent adjuncts. These more broadly defined detergent adjuncts can include any detergent adjunct or adjunct class disclosed in WO 98/42622 and the associated literature references, as well as any Class 1 detergent adjunct. Of course, preferred Class 1 adjuncts are included in all the preferred embodiments of all detergent compositions herein at levels of from about 0.0001% to about 99% of the detergent composition. Moreover, the preferred detergent compositions preferably include at least two Class 1 detergent adjuncts, more preferably at least three such adjuncts.<br>

Sources and examples of such matenals have been given in the summary heremabove. Class I detergent adjuncts Biodegradablv branched surfactants<br>
The present invention includes important embodiments comprising at least one biodegradably   branched   and/or   crystaUinity   disrupted   and/or   mid-chain   branched surfactant or surfactant mixture. The terms "biodegradably branched" and/or "crystaUinity disrupted" and/or "mid-chain branched" (acronym "MCB" used hereinafter) indicate that such surfactants or surfactant mixtures are characterized by the presence of surfactant molecules having a moderately non-linear hydrophobe; more particularly, wherein the surfactant hydrophobe is not completely linear, on one hand, nor is it branched to an extent that would result in unacceptable biodegradation. The preferred biodegradably branched surfactants are distinct from the known commercial LAS, ABS, Exxal, Lial, etc. types, whether branched or unbranched. The biodegradably branched matenals comprise particularly positioned light branching, for example from aboui one to about three methyl, and/or ethyl, and/or propyl or and/or butyl branches in the hydrophobe, wherein the branching is located remotely from the surfactant headgroup, preferably toward the middle of the hydrophobe. Typically from one to three such branches can be present on a sinele hydrophobe, preferably only one.   Such biodegradably branched surfactants can have   exclusively   linear   aliphatic   hydrophobes,   or   the   hydrophobe-   can   include cycloaliphatic or aromatic substitution. Highly preferred are MCB analog;- of common linear  alkyl   sulfate.  linear  alkyl  poly(alkoxylate)  and  linear  alkylbenzenesulfonate surfactants, said surfactant suitably being selected from mid-chain- C1-C4 -branched Cs-C1-C4 alkyl sulfates, mid-chain- C1-C4 -branched C1-C4 ralkyl ethoxylated. propoxylaied or butoxylated alcohols, mid-chain-C,-C,-branched -alkyl ethoxysulfates, mid-chain- C1-C4 -branched C1-C4 (1-alkyl benzenesulfonates and mixtures thereof. When amonic, thr surfactants can in general be in acid or salt, for example sodium, potassium, ammonium or substituted ammonium, form. The biodegradably branched surfactants offer substantial improvements in cleaning performance and/or usefulness in cold water and/or resistance to water hardness and/or economy of utilization. Such surfactants can, in general, belong to any known class of surfactants, e.g., anionic, nonionic, catiomc, or zwittenonic. The biodegradably branched surfactants are synthesized through processes of Procter &amp; Gamble, Shell, and Sasol. These surfactants are more fully disclosed in W098/23712 A published 06/04/98; W097/38957 A published  10/23/97; WO97/38956 A published<br><br>

Processing ofHvbnd Builder with Film-forming Polymers<br>
Certain embodiments of builder systems and detergent compositions of the present invention, especially those in granular or powder form, can also contain from about 0.1% to about 10%, typically .from about 0.3% 10 about 7%, preferably from about 0.3% to about 4%. more preferably 0.5% to about 2.5% by weight of a film-forming polymer soluble in an aqueous slurry comprising the organic surfactants, aluminosilicate matenals, and neutral or alkaline salts herein. The polymer must be at least partially soluble in the slurry for it to dry to a film capable of cementing the granule walls together as the slurry-is dned. For optimum granule physical properties, the polymer should be substantially soluble in the slurry, and is preferably completely soluble in the slurry. The slurry will typically   compnse   a   surfactant   phase   and   the   insoluble   aluminosilicate   material suspended in a solution (often saturated) of the neutral or alkaline salt, which preferably comprises sodium sulfate. The slurry will usually be alkaline in nature due to the presence of the aluminosilicate material and either anionic surfactants or alkaline salts. Since the slurry will generally be a strong electrolyte solution, optimum solubility of the polymer is obtained when it is in the form of an at least partially neutralized or substituted alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium (e.g., mono-, di- or triethanol ammonium) salt. The alkali metal, especially sodium, salts are most preferred. While the molecular weight of the polymer can vary over a wide range, it preferably is from about 1000 to about 500,000, more preferably is from about 2000 to about 250,000, and most preferably is from about 3000 to about 100.000. Suitable film-forming polymers herein include homopolymers and copolymers of unsaturated aliphatic mono- or polycarboxylic acids. Preferred carboxylic acids are acrylic acid, hydroxyacrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumanc acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, crotonic acid, and citraconic acid. The polycarboxylic acids (e.g. maleic acid) can be polymensed in the form of their anhydrides and subsequently hydrolyzed.  The copolymers can be  formed of mixtures of the unsaturated carboxylic acids with or without other copolymerisable monomers, or they<br><br>
can be formed from single unsaturated carboxylic acids with other copolymensable monomers. In either case, the percentage by weight of the polymer units derived from non-carboxylic   acids   is   preferably   less   than   about   50%.   Suitable   copolymensable monomers include, for example, vinyl chloride, vinyl alcohol, furan. acrylonitrile. vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate. methyl methacrylate. styrene. vinyl methyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether, vinyl propyl ether, acrylamide. ethylene, propylene and 3-butenoic acid. Preferred polymers of the above group are the homopolymers and copolymers of acrylic acid. hydroxyacrylic acid, or methacrylic acid, which in the case of the copolymers contain ai least about 50%, and preferably at least about 80%. by weight of units derived from the acid.    Particularly    preferred    polymers    are    sodium    polyacrylate    and    sodium polyhydroxyacrylate.  Other specific preferred  polymers  are the  homopolymers  and copolymers of maleic anhydride, especially the copolymers with ethylene. styrene and vinyl methyl ether. These polymers are commercially available under the trade names Versicol and Gantrez. The polymerisation of acrylic acid homo- and copolymers can be accomplished using free-radical initiators, such as alkali metal persulphates. acyl and aryl peroxides, acyl and aryl peresters and aliphatic azocompounds. The reaction can be carried  out  in  situ or in  aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions.  Chain-terminating agents can be added to control the molecular weight. The copolymers of maleic anhydride can be synthesised using any of the types of free-radical initiators mentioned above in suitable solvents such as benzene or acetone, or in the absence of a solvent, under an inert atmosphere. These polymerisation techniques are well known in the an. It will be appreciated that instead of using a single polymeric aliphatic carboxylic acid, mixtures of two or more polymeric aliphatic carboxylic acids can be used to prepare the above polymers. Other film-forming polymers useful herein include the cellulose sulfate esters such as cellulose acetate sulfate, cellulose sulfate. hydroxyethyl cellulose sulfate, methylcellulose sulfate. and hydroxypropylcellulose sulfate. Sodium cellulose sulfate is the most preferred polymer of this group. Other suitable film-forming polymers are  the carboxylated polysacchandes. particularly starches, celluloses and alginates, described in U.S. Pat. No. 3.723.322. Diehl. issued Mar. 27, 1973; the dextnn esters of polycarboxylic acids disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,919,107, Thompson, issued Nov. 11, 1975; the hydroxyalkyl starch ethers, starch esters, oxidized starches, dextrins and starch hydrolysates described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,803,285, Jensen, issued Apr. 9, 1974; and the carboxylated starches described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,629,121, Eldib, issued Dec. 21, 1971; all incorporated herein by reference. Preferred polymers of the above group are the carboxymethyl celluloses. Particularly preferred polymers for use herein are copolymers of acrylamide and acrylate having a molecular weight of from about 3.000 to about<br><br>
100,000, preferably from about 4,000 to about 20.000. and an acrylamide concern of less than about 50%, preferably less than about 20%, of the polymer. Most preferably, the polymer has a molecular weight of from about 4.000 to about 10,000 and an acrylamide content of from about 5% to about 15%. Such a polymer acts to increase the percentage of a crutcher mix that is in the aqueous (lye) phase. This improves the rate at which droplets of the crutcher mix will dry in a spray tower and can desirably increase the density of the resulting detergent granules when, for example, large amounts of sodium sulfate or other high-density inorganic salt is in the lye phase.<br>

The detergent compositions of the invention.can contain one or more conventional detergent surfactants chosen from soap and non-soap anionic, cationic, nomonic, amphotenc and zwittenonic detergent-active compounds, and mixtures thereof. Many suitable surfactants are available and are described in the literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch. in the well-known Me Cutcheon's, and in the "Surfactant Science Series" of texts published by Marcel Dekker. New York. Preferred surfactants include synthetic non-soap anionic and nomonic types, though soaps, including those derived from vegetable sources, can also be used, especially in bars.<br>
Anionic surfactants are well-known and include alkylbenzene sulphonates, e.g., "linear" types having an alkyl chain length of C8-C15 or non-biodegradable "hard-<br><br>
-branched" types though these latter types are relatively undesirable, especially where noi permitted by legislation or where environmental considerations are paramount. Primary and secondary alky! sulphates, particularly C12-C15 primary alkyl sulphates; alkyl ether sulphates; olefin suiphonates; alkyl xylene sulphonates; dialkyl sulphosuccinates; and fatty acid ester sulphonates. such as methyl ester sulfonaies, can be used. Sodium salts are typically preferred,<br>
Noniomc surfactants that may be used include primary and secondap, alcohol eihoxylates. especially C8-C20 primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with from 1 to 20 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, and more especially C9-C15 primary aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from 1 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. The corresponding derivatives of Guerbet. Exxal®, Isofol® or Lial® alcohols can also be useful.<br>
Also of interest are non-ethoxylated noniomc surfactants, for example polyhydroxyamides. The choice of detergent-active compound (surfactant), and the amount, will depend on the intended use of the composition: different surfactant systems may be chosen for handwashing products and for products intended for use in different types of washing machine.<br>
The surfactant system can optionally be complemented by one or more cationic surfactants, such as fatly alkyl tnmethylammonium salts or variants thereof.<br>
Examples  of other  suitable  cationic   surfactants   are  described   in   following<br>
documents, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety; M.C.<br>

Additionally, special-purpose surfactants, for example the linear or branched CK-<br>
CJlv fatty alkyldimethylamine-N-oxides may be added for grease cleaning. Cationic or<br>
amme oxide surfactants, when present, are typically used at levels below about 5%, more<br>
generally at levels in the range from about 0.1% to about 2%.<br>
The total amount of surfactant system present will also depend on the intended<br>
end use. but suitably ranges from about 2% to about 60 wt,%, preferably from 5% to 40<br>
wt.%.<br>
Detergent  compositions   suitable   for  use   in   most   automatic   fabnc   washing<br>
machines  generally contain  anionic  non-soap  surfactant,  or nomonic  surfactant, or<br>
combinations of the two in any ratio, optionally together with soap.<br>

Preferred supplementary builders for use in conjunction with the hybrid aluminosilicate include citric acid salts, more especially sodium citrate, suitably used in amounts of from 3 to 20 wi.%. more preferably from 5 to 15 wt.%. Other supplementary builders are the water-soluble or partly water-soluble silicates, whether crystalline or amorphous. These include the so-called layer .silicates such as SK.S-6 from Hoechst/Clanant and/or common 2-ratio or 3-ratio soluble silicates. Such materials, when present, are typically used at levels in the range from about 0.1% to about 20% of the composition; more commonly, the level is below about 10%.<br>
In more detail, suitable silicate builders include water-soluble and hydrous solid types and including those having chain-, layer-, or three-dimensional- structure as well as amorphous-solid silicates or other types. Preferred are alkali metal silicates, particularly those liquids and solids having a SiO2:Na20 ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1, including<br><br>
solid hydrous 2-ratio silicates marketed by PQ Corp. under the tradename BRJTESIL®. e.g., BRITESIL H20; and layered silicates, e.g., those described in U.S. 4.664.839, May 12. 1987. H. P. Rieck. NaSKS-6 or "SKS-6", is a crystalline layered aluminum-free 5-Na-,Si(X silicate marketed by Hoechst and is preferred especially in granular laundrv compositions. See DE-A-3.417.649, DE-A-3.742,043 and technical publications of Hoechst / Clanant, for example Surfactant Science Series, Marcel Dekker. New York, see Vol. 71, Ed. M.S. Showell, published 1998.

Layered silicates from Hoechst also include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the a. [3 and y layer-silicate forms. Other silicates may also be useful, e.g. magnesium silicate, for example for bleach stabilizing or process aid purposes.<br>
Also suitable herein are crystalline ion exchange materials or hydrates having chain structure and a composition represented by: xM,O-ySiO:.zM'O as anhydride wherein M is Na and/or K, M' is Ca and/or Mg; y/x is 0.5 to 2.0 and z/x is 0.005 to 1.0 as taught in U.S. 5,427,711.<br>
Conventional aluminosilicate builders or zeolites can be useful in certain embodiments. These include materials having formula: [M7(A102)z(Si02)v]-xH:0 wherein z and v are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to v is in the range from 1.0 to 0.5, and x is an integer from 15 to 264. Aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous, naturally-occurring or synthetically derived. An aluminosilicate production method is in U.S. 3,985,669. Krummel. ct al, October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are available as Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite X and, to whatever extent this differs from Zeolite P, the so-called Zeolite MAP. Natural types, including clinoptilolite, may be used. Zeolite A has the formula: Nai:[(AlO,),:(SiO2),,].xHjO wherein x is from 20 to 30, especially 27. Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of 0.1 -10 microns in diameter.<br>
Suitable carbonate builders include alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on November 15, 1973, although sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium sesquicarbonate, and other carbonate minerals such as trona. Other useful carbonate builders are those of U.S. 5,658,867 issued August 19, 1997. to Panchen et al incorporated herein by reference or any convenient multiple salts of sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate such as those<br><br>
having the composition 2Na2CO3.CaCO; when anhydrous, and even calcium carbonates including calcite, aragomte and vaterite, especially forms having high surface areas relative to compact calcite may be useful, for example as seeds or for use in synthetic detergent bars.<br>
Also preferred to complement the builder in certain embodiments are polycarboxylate polymers, more especially acrylic/maleic copolymers. suitably used in amounts of from 0.5 to 15 wt.%, especially from 1 to 10 wt.%. of the detergent composition. The invention however includes embodiments from which such conventional polycarboxylate polymers are substantially absent. The term "substantially absent" means that no amount is deliberately added though adventitious amounts may be present, for example as a result of presence in a preformulated additive, such as a paniculate enzyme additive. Bleach<br>
Detergent compositions of the invention can also include one or more components of a conventional bleach system. Such a bleach system may generally comprise any source of oxidative or reductive bleach, for example chlorine bleaches such as hyophalite, especially hypochlonte; any hypohalite precursor, such as sodium dichloroisocyanurate, or any reductive bleach, for example sodium hydrosulphite or sodium bisulfite. Preferred bleach systems include those which are oxidative and comprise at least one source of bleaching oxygen. Most generally, for example, when using a transition-metal bleach catalyst, there is no need for any source of bleaching oxygen other than oxygen from the air. Quite typically, however, a source of bleaching oxygen is added into the formulation. Such sources of bleaching oxygen include hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate monohydrate. sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium percarbonate, any other salt or adduct capable of releasing hydrogen peroxide in water, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Conventional bleach systems also often include hydrophilic bleach activators (bleach precursors) or the corresponding peracids, for example TAED (tetraacetylethylenediamine) or peracetic acid. Bleach stabilizers, for example heavy metal sequestrants and/or free radical inhibitors, may also be present. In certain instances, for example, low levels of tin compounds are used to stabilize bleach. In detergent compositions herein, sodium percarbonate or other persalts may be present in an amount of from 5 to 30 wt.%, preferably from 10 to 25 wt.%. Bleach activators are suitably used in amounts of from 1 to 8 wt.%, preferably from 2 to 5 wt.%. Organic or inorganic peroxyacids can also be used. These are normally in an amount within the range of from 2 to 10 wt.%, preferably from 4 to 8 wt.%. Enzymes<br><br>

Other useful SRA's are described in U.S. 4.240,918. 4.7S7.989. 4,525,524 and 4,877,896. Clay Soil Removal/Anti-redeposuion Agents<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also optionall}' contain water-soluble ethoxylated or acylated amines or polyamines having clay soil removal and antiredeposition properties. Granular detergent compositions which contain these compounds typically contain from about 0.01% to about 10.0% by weight of the water-soluble ethoxylated amines; liquid detergent compositions typically contain about 0.01% to about 5%.<br>
A preferred soil release and anti-redeposition agent is ethoxylated tetraethylene pentamme. See U.S. 4.597,898. See also European Patent Application 111,965, published June 27, 1984.

Other clay soil removal and/or anti redeposition agents are disclosed in U.S. 4,891,160, and WO 95/32272, published November 30, 1995. Another type of preferred antiredeposition agent includes the known cellulosic materials such as carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC). Pplvmenc Dispersing Agents<br>
Polymeric dispersing agents can be used herein at levels from about 0.1% to about 7%, by weight, especially in the presence of hybrid aluminosilicates, zeolite andVor layered silicate builders. Such agents include polymeric polycarboxylates and polyethylene glycols. Polymeric dispersing agents are believed to enhance detergent builder performance, by mechanisms such as crystal growth inhibition, paniculate soil release, peptization, or anti-redeposition.<br>
Polymeric polycarboxylate materials can be prepared by polymerizing or copolymenzmg suitable unsaturated monomers, preferably in their acid form. Unsaturated monomeric acids that can be polymerized to form suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic anhybride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid. The presence in the polymeric polycarboxylates herein or monomeric segments,<br><br>
containing no carboxylate radicals such as vinylmethyl ether, styrene. eihylene, etc. is suitable provided that such segments do not constitute more than about 40% by weight.<br>
Particularly suitable polymenc polycarboxylates can be derived from acrylic acid, as in water-soluble salts of polymerized acrylic acid. The average molecular weight of such polymers preferably ranges from about 2.000 to 10,000, more preferably from about 4,000 to 7,000 and most preferably from about 4,000 to 5,000. Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid polymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. See U.S. 3.308,067.<br>
Acrylic/maleic-based copolymers may also be used. Such materials include the water-soluble salts of copolymers of acrylic acid and maleic acid. The average molecular weight of such copolymers preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 100,000. more preferably from about 5,000 to 75,000, most preferably from about 7,000 to 65,000. The ratio of acrylate to maleate segments will generally range from about 30:1 to about 1:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to 2:1. Alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of the polymers can be used. See European Patent Application No. 66915, published December 15. 1982, as well as in EP 193,360, published September 3, 1986, which also describes such polymers comprising hydroxypropylacrylate. Still other useful dispersing agents include the maleic/acrylic/vmyl alcohol terpolymers.

Mixed suds suppressors typically comprise mixtures of alcohol - silicone at a weight ratio of 1:5 to 5:1.<br>
Suds suppressors, when utilized, are preferably present in a "suds suppressing amount. By "suds suppressing amount" is meant that the formulator of the composition can select an amount of this suds controlling agent that will sufficiently control the suds to result in a low-sudsing laundry detergent for use in automatic laundry washing machines. Other Ingredients<br>
A wide variety of other ingredients useful in detergent compositions can be included in the compositions herein, including perfumes, enzyme stabilizers, softening clays such as bentonites, montmorillonites, hectorites, other clays such as laponite or kaolin, chlorine scavengers, such as ammonium sulfate; other active ingredients, carriers, hydrotropes, processing aids, dyes or pigments, fillers, especially for bar compositions, etc. If desired, magnesium anchor calcium salts such as MgCU, MgS04, CaCU, CaS04, magnesium silicates and the like, can be added, for example as fillers for bar forms of the compositions.<br>
Various detersive ingredients employed in the present compositions optionally can be further stabilized by absorbing said ingredients onto a porous hydrophobic substrate, then coating said substrate with a hydrophobic coating. Preferably, the detersive ingredient is admixed with a surfactant before being absorbed into the porous substrate. In use, the detersive ingredient is released from the substrate into the aqueous washing liquor, where it performs its intended detersive function.<br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6.5 and about 11, preferably between about 7.0 and 10.5, more preferably between about 7.0 to about 9.5. Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkalis, acids, etc., and are well known to those skilled in the art. Form of the compositions<br>
Compositions herein can vary in physical form, as nonlimitingly illustrated by granular, tablet, bar, and pouch forms.

The mean panicle size of the components of granular detergent compositions herein is preferably be such that no more that 5% of particles are greater than 1.7mm in diameter and not more than 5% of particles are less than 0.15mm in diameter.<br>
"Mean particle size" herein can be determined by sieving a sample of material to be sized into a number of fractions (typically 5) on a series of Tyler sieves. Weights of fractions are plotted against the aperture size of the sieves. The mean particle size is the aperture size through which 50% by weight of the sample would pass.<br>
Certain preferred granular detergent compositions in accordance herein are high-density types, now common in the marketplace; typically these have a bulk density of at least 600 g/litre, more preferably from 650 g/litre to 1200 g/litre. Laundry washing method<br>
Machine laundry methods herein typically comprise treating soiled laundry with an aqueous wash solution in a washing machine having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a detergent composition of the invention. By an "effective amount" is here meant from 40g to 300g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 5 to 65 litres.<br>
In the context of fabric laundering, product "usage levels" can vary widely, depending not only on the type and seventy of soils and stains, but also on wash water temperatures and volumes and type of washing machine.<br>
In a preferred use aspect a dispensing device is employed in the washing method. The dispensing device is charged with the detergent product, and is used to introduce the product directly into the drum of the washing machine before the start of the wash cycle. Its capacity should be such as to be able to contain sufficient detergent product as would normally be used in the washing method.<br>
Once the washing machine has been loaded with laundry, the dispensing device containing the detergent product is placed inside the drum. At the commencement of the wash cycle of the washing machine, water is introduced into the drum and the drum periodically rotates. The design of the dispensing device should be such that it permits containment of the dry detergent product but then allows release of this product during the wash cycle in response to its agitation as the drum rotates and also as a result of its contact with the wash water.<br>
Alternatively, the dispensing device may be a flexible container, such as a bag or pouch. The bag may be of fibrous construction coated with a water impermeable protective material so as to retain the contents, such as is disclosed in European published Patent Application No. 0018678. Alternatively it may be formed of a water-insoluble synthetic polymeric material provided with an edge seal or closure designed to rupture in<br><br>
aoueous media as disclosed in European published Patent Application Nos. 0011500<br>
0011501.   0011502,   and  0011968.     A  convenient   form  of water-frangible   closure<br>
comprises a water soluble adhesive disposed along and sealing one edge of a pouch<br>
formed of a water impermeable polymeric film such as polyethylene or polypropylene.<br>

High Density Detergent Composition Processes<br>
Spray-drying towers can be used to make granular laundry detergents or base powders. These often have a density less than about 500 g/1. Typically, an aqueous slurry of insredients is passed through a spray-drying tower at temperatures of about 175°C to<br>
about225°C.<br>
Additional process steps must be used to obtain high density, low dosage detergents. "High density" means greater than about 550, typically greater than about 650, grams/liter or "g/1"). Thus spray-dried granules can be densified by loading a liquid, often a nonionic surfactant, into the pores of the granules and/or passing them through one or more high speed mixer/densifiers such as a device sold as a "Lodige CB 30" or "Lodige CB 30 Recycler". This comprises a static cylindrical mixing drum having a central rotating shaft on which are mounted mixing/cutting blades. Ingredients for the detergent<br>
w<br>
composition are introduced into the drum and the shaft/blade assembly is rotated at speeds in the range of 100-2500 rpm to provide thorough mixing/densification. See U.S. 5,149,455 and 5,565,422. Other suitable commercial apparatus includes the "Shugi Granulator" and the "Drais K-TTP 80.<br>
Spray-dried granules can also be densified by treating them in a moderate speed mixer/densifier so as to obtain particles, for which the "Lodige KM" (Series 300 or 600) or "Lodige Ploughshare" mixer/densifiers are suitable and are typically operated at 40-160 rpm. Other useful equipment includes the "Drais K-T 160". This process step using a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige KM) can be used alone or sequentially with the aforementioned high speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige CB) to achieve the desired density. Other types of granules manufacturing apparatus useful herein include the apparatus disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,306,898, to G. L. Heller, December 29, 1942.<br>
While it may be more suitable to use the high speed mixer/densifier followed by the low speed mixer/densifier, the reverse sequential mixer/densifier configuration can also be used. One or a combination of various parameters including residence times in the mixer/densifiers, operating temperatures of the equipment, temperature and/or composition of the granules, the use of adjunct ingredients such as liquid binders and flow aids, can be used to optimize densification of the spray-dried granules. By way of<br>
, example see the processes in U.S. 5.133.924; U.S. 4.637.891. (granulating spray-dried granules with a liquid binder and aluminosilicate); U.S. 4,726,908, (granulatins sprav-dned granules with a liquid binder and aluminosilicate); and U.S.5.160,657, (coatins densified granules with aluminosilicate).<br>
Heat sensitive or highly volatile detergent ingredients are preferably incorporated into the detergent composition without resorting to spray drying, for example, by feeding thermally sensitive or volatile ingredients continuously or batchwise into mixing/densifying equipment. One preferred embodiment involves charging a surfactant paste and an anhydrous material into a high speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige CB) followed by a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige KM) to form high density agglomerates. See U.S. 5,366,652 and U.S. 5.486,303. The liquid/solids ratio of ingredients can be selected to obtain high density agglomerates that are more free flowine and cnsp. See U.S. 5,565.137.<br>
Optionally, the process may include one or more streams of undersized panicles. These can be recycled to the mixer/densifiers for further agglomeration or build-up. Oversized particles can be sent to grinding apparatus, the product of which is fed back to the mixing/densifying equipment. Such recycles facilitate overall particle size control giving in finished compositions which having a relatively uniform distribution of particle size (400-700 microns) and density (&gt; 550 g/1). See U.S. 5,516,448 and U.S. 5,489,392. Other suitable processes which do not call for spray-drying are described in U.S.4,828,721, U.S. 5,108,646 and U.S. 5.1 7S.798,<br>
In yet another embodiment, the high density detergent compositions can be produced using a fluidized bed mixer in which the ingredients are combined as an aqueous slurry (typically 80% solids content) and sprayed into a fluidized bed to provide finished granules. Optionally prior to fluid bed mixing the slurry can be treated using the aforementioned Lodige CB mixer/densifier or a "Flexomix 160" mixer/densifier, available from Shugi. Fluidized bed or moving beds of the type available under the tradename "Escher Wyss" can also be used.<br>
Another alternate process involves feeding a liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant, an alkaline inorganic material (e.g. sodium carbonate) and optionally other detergent ingredients into a high speed mixer/densifier (residence time 5-30 seconds) so as to form particles containing a partially or totally neutralized anionic surfactant salt and the other starting detergent ingredients. Optionally, the contents in the high speed mixer/densifier can be sent to a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige KM) for further mixing resulting in the finished high density detergent composition. See U.S. 5.164,108.<br>
Optionally, high density detergent compositions can be produced by blending conventional spray-dried detergent granules with detergent agglomerates m various proportions (e.g. a 60:40 weight ratio of granules to agglomerates) produced by one or a combination of the processes discussed herein. Additional adjunct ingredients such as enzymes, perfumes, bnghteners and the like can be sprayed or admixed with the agglomerates, granules or mixtures thereof produced by the processes discussed herein. For example, see US 5,569,645. EXAMPLES 4-6<br>
Several detergent compositions made in accordance with the invention and specifically for top-loading washing machines are exemplified below. The base granule is prepared by a conventional spray drying process in which the starting ingredients are formed into a slurry and passed though a spray drying tower having a countercurrent stream of hot air (200-300°C) resulting in the formation of porous granules. The admixed agglomerates are formed from two feed streams of detergent ingredients which are continuously fed, at a rate of 1400 kg/hi, into a Lodige CB-30 mixer/densifier, one of which compnses a surfactant paste containing surfactant and water and the other stream containing starting dry detergent material containing sodium carbonate and insoluble inorganic builder such as hybrid aluminosilicate or combinations thereof with zeolite. The rotational speed of the shaft in the Lodige CB-30 mixer/densifier is about 1400. The contents from the Lodige CB-30 mixer/densifier are continuously fed into a Lodige KM-600 mixer/densifier for further build-up agglomeration. The resulting detergent agglomerates are then fed to a fluid bed dryer and to a fluid bed cooler before being admixed with the spray dried granules. The remaining adjunct detergent ingredients are sprayed on or dry added to the blend of agglomerates and granules. Alternately the magnseiosilicate can be dry-added, in whole or in part, to the composition.<br><br>
