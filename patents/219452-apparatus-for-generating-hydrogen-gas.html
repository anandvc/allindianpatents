				<td>APPARATUS FOR GENERATING HYDROGEN GAS Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for generating hydrogen gas; and, more particularly, to an apparatus for generating hydrogen gas from water.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Hydrogen gas which can be produced from basic industrial resources has a great potential to be widely applied in various fields of current energy system such as commonly distributed fuel, hydrogen-fueled cars and air planes, fuel cells and nuclear fusion energy.<br>
If hydrogen is chemically combusted under appropriately controlled conditions, hydrogen can be used as an energy source like commonly supplied urban gas, Hydrogen and oxygen are combusted in a volume ratio of 2 to 1 to produce water in vapor state. At this time, about 28,620 kcal per kilogram is generated, and this amount of calorie is sufficient to raise a temperature of about 0.3 tons of water at about 0 °C to about 100 °C.<br>
Also, hydrogen is capable of generating electric energy through a fuel cell as well as of generating enormous amounts of energy like a hydrogen bomb through a nuclear fusion reaction. Hydrogen can be directly combusted to produce energy and can also be a convenient energy source such as a fuel cell. Furthermore, hydrogen is a source of generating almost infinite amounts of water and is recycled as water, thereby being a renewable energy source.<br>
Although hydrogen exists with a traceable amount of about 0.1 parts per million (ppm) in atmosphere, hydrogen exists in various types of compounds with almost infinite amounts. Among various types of compounds, water (H20) is the most. commonly found compound containing hydrogen,<br><br>
Also, crude oil and natural gas composed of diverse carbon compounds containing carbon and hydrogen are good sources of hydrogen.<br>
There are two typical methods of generating hydrogen gas. One method is to obtain hydrogen gas by electrolyzing water. The other method is to obtain hydrogen gas from carbon compounds of natural gas or crude oil by a thermal decomposition.<br>
More particularly, hydrogen and oxygen should be separated from a water molecule composed of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms in order to obtain hydrogen gas from water. F'or the electrolysis of water, about 4 grams of hydrogen can be obtained from about 36 grams of water, Theoretically, the electrolysis of water requires about 1.23 voltages. However, a higher voltage is required in actual practice due to an internal resistance of a device.<br>
Since the electricity is an energy source that can be directly applicable in industries, the use of electricity to obtain hydrogen gas, which is, in turn, used again as an energy source, decreases efficiency on usage of the energy. Therefore, the use of electricity is limitedly applicable by using redundant electricity such as electricity generated at night to electrolyze water, store hydrogen from the electrolysis through an appropriate method and regenerate electricity by using a fuel cell.<br>
For another method for obtaining hydrogen gas» hydrocarbon such as naphtha obtained by purifying natural gas or crude oil gets to react with vapor at a hign temperature. However, the natural gas and crude oil ajre highly effective but non-renewable energy sources. Thus/ there is a limitation in obtaining hydrogen gas with use of such energy sources.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention<br><br>
to provide an apparatus for generating hydrogen gas from water without using a non-renewable energy source such as fossil fuel containing hydrocarbons.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for generating lots of hydrogen gas with use of a small amount of energy without employing electrolys is .<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for generating hydrogen gas, including: an operation fluid supply unit for supplying an operation fluid which is water after highly purifying water and pressurizing the water with a predetermined pressure; a body having a passage where the operation fluid flows; a dielectric implant for passing the operation fluid through a passage slot and generating an electric impulse with a high potential by a cavitation emission, the dielectric implant implanted in the passage of the body; a separation unit for separating ions of the operation fluid based on electric polarities of the ions by supplying a magnetic field to a flow of the operation fluid ionized by the electric impulse; and a collecting unit for separateiy collecting the ions separated by the separation unit and generating hydrogen gas.<br>
The body is formed with a dielectric material having a tolerance to a cavitation emission phenomenon generated inside of the body. That is, the body is made of one of ceramics, ruby and sapphire. The dielectric implant is formed in the passage of the body. Herein, the dielectric implant has one or more than one passage slot allowing the operation fluid to flow. Inner walls of the passage slot and portions around the inner walls are made of a dielectric material easily resulting in the cavitation emission phenomenon, e.g. asbestos. Also, an expansion unit of which cross-sectional area is expanded is formed at an outlet side of the passage slot. Particularly, the expansion unit serves to abruptly decrease a pressure of the operation fluid.<br><br>
The separation unit is connected with the body and includes a channel with a predetermined length and separation channels. Herein, magnetic bodies are formed at lateral sides of the channel such that a North pole of a group of the magnetic bodies and a South pole of another group of the magnetic bodies face with each other. The separation channels are formed at a rear end of the channel and serves to separate the operation fluid into two paths. At this time, the operation fluid is separated perpendicular to a magnetic field provided by the magnetic bodies.<br>
The collecting unit is an enclosed tank. At a bottom part of the collecting unit, there is an input pipe to which the operation fluid separately containing lots of hydrogen ions and hydrogen oxide ions is supplied. The input pipe is connected with each rear end of the separation channels. Also, the tank includes a catalytic plate contacting the operation fluid at a wide surface area region and having a specific structure allowing gas generated from a contact: surface of the catalytic plate to rise and a membrane for selectively passing hydrogen gas generated at the catalytic plate. Herein, the membrane is formed at an upper part of the tank.<br>
The upper part of the tank includes a first discharging pipe being formed at an upper part of the membrane and being connected with a first hydrogen tank, a second discharging pipe being formed at a bottom part of the membrane and being connected with a second hydrogen tank and a third discharging pipe being formed at a height around a top of the catalytic plate. Herein, the first discharging pipe discharges the hydrogen gas highly purified by passing through the membrane. The second discharging pipe discharges the hydrogen gas lowly purified by not passing through the membrane. The third discharging pipe recollects water passing through the catalytic plate and sends the water back to the operation fluid supply unit.<br><br>
The (first hydrogen tank stores the highly purified hydrogen gas, while the second hydrogen tank stores the lowly purified hydrogen gas containing oxygen or vapor. It is preferable to have a check valve at each inlet of the first and the second hydrogen tanks to prevent an inversed flow of gas.<br>
The catalytic plate is preferably made of one of palladium and rhodium. The catalytic plate has a property of absorbing or permeating lots of hydrogen. The hydrogen permeated from the catalytic plate can give rise to vigorous reduction reactions at a room temperature because of strong activity of the permeated hydrogen.<br>
Operations of the apparatus for generating hydrogen gas will be described in detail.<br>
The apparatus for generating hydrogen gas first ionizes water, which is an operation fluid. A magnetic field is then supplied to a flow of the ionized operation fluid. The operation fluid containing lots of ions aye separated based on their electric polarities by using the Lorentz force generated by the magnetic field. At this time, the collecting unit is formed at each of two respective places at which the separated positively charged ions and negatively charged ions arrive to thereby generate hydrogen gas.<br>
The operation fluid supply unit supplies highly purified water through purification steps. The water is pressurized with a predetermined uniform pressure by a pump allocated at an outlet side of the operation fluid supply unit and is subsequently supplied to an input pipe of the body. At this time, a pulse generator is connected to a pipe at the outlet side to thereby provide a pulse with a predetermined frequency. The predetermined frequency is related to unique oscillation numbers of the passage slot of the dielectric implant generating the cavitation emission phenomenon.<br>
The water flows into the passage of the body and rapidly passes through the passage slot of the dielectric<br><br>
implant. When the water passes through the expansion unit formed at the outlet side of the passage slot, the inside diameter of the expansion unit increases. This increased inside diameter decreases a pressure, thereby decreasing a boiling point. Therefore, fine bubbles are created within the flow of the operation fluid, and these bubbles expand and eventually burst out.<br>
When these bubbles burst around an end part of the expansion unit formed at the outlet side of the passage slot, a very high pressure wave is generated and affects the dielectric implant. At this time, the generated pressure wave nearly equals to an atmospheric pressure of about 10,000 bars.<br>
Because of the high pressure wave, there are created fine cracks on the inner walls of the passage slot of the dielectric implant. Electrons are emitted from the fine cracks due to a property of the material used in the inner walls, i.e., the property that easily resulting in the cavitation emission phenomenon. The emitted electrons are dispersed within the operation fluid, thereby resulting in the Vavilov-Cheronkov effect.<br>
As the electrons having negative charges are emitted, the outlet side of the passage slot becomes positively charged. The inner walls and adjacent regions to the inner walls can be charged with a high electric potential without causing electron discharge because of the above mentioned property. Electric shock generated by the high electric potential partially ionizes the water.<br>
The above described course of ionization can apply to other dielectric fluids containing hydrogen such as mineral oil, kerosene and acetone. Therefore, it is possible to use these dielectric liquids containing hydrogen as the operation fluid.<br>
A magnetic field is supplied to the flow of the operation fluid containing hydrogen ions and hydrogen oxide ions. As a result of the supplied magnetic field, the hydrogen and hydrogen oxide ions are affected by the<br><br>
Lorentz force in a perpendicular direction to the magnetic field, thereby being separated based on their electric polarities, i.e. positive charged ions and negatively charged ions.<br>
The separated ions move towards each corresponding collecting unit. Within the collecting unit, which is an enclosed tank, the operation fluid separately containing the hydrogen ions and the hydrogen oxide ions contacts the catalytic plate, which in turn, absorbs highly reductive hydrogen and discharges the hydrogen to thereby generate hydrogen gas.<br>
The generated hydrogen gas rises from each collecting unit and passes through the membrane to be stored in the first hydrogen tank. If the hydrogen gas does not pass through the membrane, the hydrogen gas is stored in the second hydrogen tank.<br>
