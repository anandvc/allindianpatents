				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to road wheels of vehicles. In particular this invention relates to construction of vehicle steel wheel of 5° and 15° drop center rims used but inot limited for commercial use. This invention further relates to a method of manufacturing the said type of wheel.<br>
Tire bead seat area would have a 5° or 15° taper and profile (where tire contact is involved) as defined in the international tire and rim standards / manuals / hand books such as ETRTO, TORA, 3ATMA. Whereas 15° drop center is mainly used for jtubeless type tyre application, the 5° drop center rims can be used for both tube and Itubeless applications. Removable flanges are not required for this design.<br>
This invention relates to a construction, apparatus and a method of producing a one-piece wheel of S°and 15° drop center rim, providing a generally circular steel blank from a sheet stock of pre-determined uniform thickness, the blank is preferably with a center hole pierced to a predetermined size. The blank Is preformed in spinning machine to a predetermined profile &amp; cylindrical shape, such preform is further spun and flow formed in a spinning machine, the preform being positioned between an outer roller &amp; inner mandrel and held against the clamping plate, such inner mandrel comprise of a outboard surface which conforms to the predetermined inner diameter of the rim well, the inner &amp; outer bead-seat and outer flange and such outer roller comprise of outboard surface which confirms to the predetermined inner diameter of the inner flange. The preform peripheral cylindrical portion is then spun against the outboard surface of the inner mandrel &amp; outboard surface of the outer roller to a i predetermined profile &amp; form in respect of well, inner &amp; outer bead-seats, inner &amp; outer flanges respectively. The spun rim comprising of predetermined semi-finished j well, inner &amp; outer bead seats and inner &amp; outer flanges is further subjected to a flow-forming &amp; spinning operation in an spinning machine, while the disc portion being j accurately located In the center hole &amp; clamped against the outer clamping plate, the rim peripheral portion being positioned between an inner mandrel and outer roller, such inner mandrel &amp; outer roll comprise of a outboard surface which conforms to the final profile &amp; shape of the well, inner &amp; outer bead seats and the inner &amp; outer flanges, to achieve the final profile and shape of the well, inner &amp; outer bead-seats and the outer &amp; inner flanges.<br>
PKIQE ART<br>
In its most conventional form, a fabricated sheet steel wheel of 5° and 15° drop center rim, the rim inner periphery have welded or jointed central disc also made of sheet steel. The tire mounts oh the outer periphery of the rim supported by the central disc, which provides a means of attachment to spindle hubs, brake drum or other like associated parts of the vehicle. It is essential that the rim and disc, in their assembled relationship, insure perfect roundness of the rim and accurate axial alignment of the rim with respect to the disc. Deviations in the respective directions being termed as "radial" and "axial" run-outs, the Vehicle manufacturers establish extremely rigid specifications in the tolerances for these dimensions.<br>
When such wheels are manufactured in the conventional method, the rim and discs are normally made as separate components. These two components are then assembled together; the disc fixed at its outer peripheral flange to the inner periphery of the rim by welding or some other like method to form the complete wheel assembly. In the conventional method of making the rims by using a butt-welded<br><br>
hoop made out of a steel strip of hot rolled sections or plate, achieving such a close tolerance on the roundness has found to be extremely djfficult due to the localized "kink" in the region of butt welded joint and the spring'b^.ciuring the rim diameter calibration operation.* Further substantial distortion clue^^w^lding the two parts requires further corrective additional costly operationj^^wore that the axial alignment between the rim and the disc is held within limits It Is"appreciated by the people who are skilled in the manufacturing wheels that sych'dlstortion once occurred cannot be corrected completely. Such shift in the axlal*allgnment and also the localized kink in the rim in the region of the butt welded joint Is know to produce first harmonics during vehicle running causing vibration and high noise. The axial shift between the disc and the rim also produces imbalance of the wheel causing vehicle disturbance or thumping/shake.<br>
Further when such wheels have been run with test overloads to Induce failure, fatigue cracks have usually occurred in the center of the disc where It Is attached to its supporting axle and In the welds, which have attached the rim to the disc.<br>
Further a welded assembly does not lend itself well to the rigorous balancing and centering of the wheel. Further the butt-welded joint of the hoop of the rim for the conventional process does not always lead to an airtight construction, which is necessary for fitting tubeless tires, Further the joint also constitutes a weak point, which restricts the useful life. The use of one piece wheels made from our invention, would lead to a noticeable reduction in weight as a whole and achieving balancing and centering, besides ensuring the air-tightness necessary when using tubeless tires.<br>
It is well recognized that wheels are not only critical to the safety of an automotive vehicle but also being an un-sprung mass has a pronounced effect on vehicle stability and driving comfort It is thus obvious that only a one-piece wheel of 5° and 15° design and a method of manufacturing the same would satisfy the requirement as enumerated as above.<br>
However, up to the present time none of the prior processes has enabled one-piece steel wheels of 5°and 15° drop center rims to be produced under satisfactory technical and /or economic conditions, either on account of the fact that they do not lend themselves to mass production at an attractive cost price, or on account of the fact that the wheels obtained do not satisfy the requirements of the users, strength, minimal unbalance, first harmonic content, and accuracy of the significant dimensional characteristics.<br>
The present invention relates to a construction, apparatus and method for producing one-piece wheel of 5°and 15° drop center rim for vehicles, which lends itself particularly well to mass production and provides wheels which meet the requirements of users such as have been enumerated above. A vehicle wheel of one-piece construction requires less material input and is substantially simpler to fabricate as there is only one part that is needed to manufacture and there are no assembly &amp; welding steps involved, thus resulting in cost savings.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a steel wheel of one-piece wheel of 5°and 15° drop center rim construction, a method and apparatus for making the same, which overcome the aforementioned problems in an economical and reliable manner.<br><br>
Itj is another object of invention to provide an improved method of manufacturing of a vehicle wheel in a way that reduces manufacturing cost while providing high strength wheel.<br>
It is further object of invention to provide for a design / construction that reduces the Wheel weight substantially, yet providing the high strength wheel.<br>
It is yet another object of invention to provide for a greater air space for a larger ejnvelope brake components for improved braking performance.<br>
ijt is still another object of invention to provide for a wheel having very low radial and lateral run outs.<br>
Vet another object of invention is to provide for a wheel having very low first harmonic Content.<br>
It is another object of invention to provide for a wheel having very low unbalance.<br>
It is another object of invention to provide a method whereby a family of vehicle Wheels having any plurality of axial width; diameter and offset may be produced from the blanks.<br>

providing a generally circular steel blank, preferably of predetermined uniform thickness and size, with a center hole pierced, and<br>
the blank is preformed to a predetermined cylindrical shape &amp; size by spinning &amp; flow forming in a CNC spinning machine, the blank being positioned &amp; clamped between an inner mandrel and a clamping plate, such inner mandrel having an outboard surface which conforms to a predetermined inner diameter wherein the well, inner &amp; outer bead seats and the outer flange are formed in the subsequent operations, and<br>
the spun and flow formed preform to a predetermined cylindrical shape &amp; size is further spun in a CNC spinning machine to reduce thickness consequently to increase the width in the forward direction to a predetermined size while maintaining the predetermined inner diameter wherein the well, inner &amp; outer bead seats and the outer flange are formed in the subsequent operations and at the same time further spinning is preformed on the peripheral portion of the cylinder to displace the material in the backward direction to a predetermined shape &amp; size of the inner flange, and<br>
the preform from the previous step, is further spun in a CNC spinning machine to impart final shape and profile to the rim portion comprising of well, inner &amp; outer bead seats and inner &amp; outer flanges using such inner mandrel, the central line axis of which is slightly offset against the centerline of the central hole of the preform during spinning operation.<br>
The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein spin forming the peripheral of the blank by engaging the same with a forming roller so as to obtain controlled thickness reduction and shape in the peripheral and inner portion of the blank.<br>
The method as claimed in claims 1 &amp; 2 wherein the material is displaced in the backward direction during spinning a portion of the preform peripheral cylindrical portion against the outboard surface of an outwardly positioned outer roll to form a predetermined cylindrical portion of the inner flange.<br>
The method as claimed in claims 1 to 3 wherein spin forming a portion of the blank peripheral portion by engaging the same with a forming roller to form the final shape of the well.<br>
The method as claimed in claims 1 to 4 wherein spin forming a portion of the blank peripheral portion by engaging the same with a forming roller to form the final shape of the bead seat.<br>
The method as claimed in claims 1 to 5 wherein spin forming the bead seat portion of the preformed blank is carried out by engaging the same with a forming roller against the outboard surface of the outer mandrel to form the final shape of outer flange.<br><br>
The method as claimed in claims 1 to 6 wherein the first-named spin forming step consists a plurality of passes of the forming roller.<br>
The method as claimed in claims 1 to 7 wherein after finish spinning operation boltholes are pierced in a conventional press.<br>
The method as claimed in claims 1 to 8 wherein after piercing the center hole, bolt holes, vent holes are pierced in a conventional press.<br>
.The method as claimed in claims 1 to 9 wherein after piercing the center, bolt holes &amp; vent holes, the center hole and the mounting holes are accurately machined to required size.<br>
.The method as claimed in claims 1 to 10 wherein after machining the center hole and the mounting holes to an accurate required size, the inner &amp; outer flange crown edges are machined to provide a radius or a flat.<br>
.The method as claimed in claims 1 to 11 wherein the disc blank provided is of low carbon steel or HSLA steel composition.<br>
.The method as claimed in claims 1 to 12 wherein a butt-welded hoop of predetermined diameter, width and thickness can also be used instead of a blank.<br>
.The method as claimed in claims 1 to 13 wherein the butt-welded hoop of predetermined diameter, width and thickness can also be used to manufacture the rim part alone.<br>
i.A one-piece wheel of 5° and 15° drop center rim having an integral disc and rim portion is made from a circular blank or hoop by the method as claimed in claims 1 to 14.<br>
i.A method of manufacturing a one-piece wheel of 5° and 15° drop center rim of the type having well, inner &amp; outer bead-seat and flanges substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></j></td>
