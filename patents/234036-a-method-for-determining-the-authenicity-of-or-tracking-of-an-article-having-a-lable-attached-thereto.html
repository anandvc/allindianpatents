A method for determining the authenticity of, or tracking of an article having a label attached thereto.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The   present   invention   generally   relates   to   a   system   for<br>
authenticating products based upon measuring anticipated changes in absorption, reflection, or emission of authentication materials due to the physical characteristics of a genuine product or product package. More particularly, the present invention provides for a system for authenticating products based upon an expected differential effect in adsorption, reflection or emission with respect to a define plurality of authentication materials when the absorption, reflection and/or emission of the same are measured across one material versus another. Such system may employ a plurality of authentication material applied to the back of a product label to produce a fingerprint when the absorption, reflection and/or emission of the authentication materials are measured across a portion of the product or product packaging.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0003]	U.S. patent No.  5,753,511  discloses an automated method of<br>
developing a database to store information for finger-print type analysis. The usefulness of the measurement of the effect of interaction of light-emitting materials within products with other components, such as neutral spirits, vodka, tequila, soft drinks and infant formula, in authenticating genuine product is disclosed. A fingerprint, referring to the light emission intensity from a   light-emissive     compound    in    combination     with a liquid sample of a product,<br><br>
is used to authenticate the product (Col. 4, Ln. 23 - 29). There is taught a method for determining the relative amounts of key ingredients in a product by exposing the products to selected light-emissive compounds present in a light-emissive compound, Bandpass and cutoff filters are used to isolate excitation wavelengths from emission spectra due to light emission from the sample.<br>
[0004] U.S. Patent No. 6,232,12461 similarly discloses measuring light emission from light emissive materials interacting with key elements in a product for the purpose of authenticating the product. The patent claims a method for determining relatedness of a sample to a standard known to be authentic or known to have at least one selected characteristic of authentic material that requires combining a sample with at least one light-emissive compound to form a sample mixture, and irradiating the same to develop a fingerprint.<br>
[0005] Systems such as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,753,511 and 6,232,124 permit products such as water, beverages and liquid pharmaceuticals to be fingerprinted using dyes such as fluorescent dyes to determine authenticity when compared to a side by side trial with the authentic product. For comparison purposes, however, samples must often be shipped to an appropriately equipped laboratory. U.S. Patent Application No. 09/428,704 commonly assigned, teaches in field testing, may be performed by placing the fluorescent dyes on a microchip. The microchips may be placed into the product and compared to an original in the field for authenticity testing. This provides an enhanced portability to authenticity testing.<br>
[0006] U.S. Patent Application No, 09/556,280, likely commonly assigned, provides for tracking of the origin of a container and/or authentication of a container using a emission detection device and a printer to print security dyes on the label of a product. The dyes used to mark the container provide a security feature that may be used to determine product authenticity and origin of manufacturing (track and trace). Such system, however, is less than fool proof as the marks may be removed by a skilled artisan.<br>
[0007] There remains a need for improved methods for permitting portable product finger printing.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
[0008] "Authentication Material" refers to a material used to authenticate, identify or mark a product. Among other physical properties, an authentication material may demonstrate different absorption, reflection, or emission upon exposure to an excitation source.<br>
[0009] An "Emission profile" can include, but is not limited to, emission intensity and time of relative emission. Analysis of the emission intensity or time of relative emission can be done as described herein and by other methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Other emission properties measurable by one of ordinary skill in the art (e.g. emission half-life, emission decay characteristics) are also embraced in the term emission profile.<br>
[00010] "Fingerprint" refers to the data set of absorption, reflection, or emission intensity from an authentication material in combination with the product to which it is affixed or intermingled, as measured through a particular media, including media comprising or surrounding the product such as its container. Accordingly, for example, the same product in a different translucent container, different products in the same translucent container, and different products in different translucent containers can all have different fingerprints with respect to one or more authentication materials. A "fingerprint profile" is an assembly of fingerprints.<br>
[00011] "Light-Absorbing Compounds": compounds that absorb light in response to irradiation with light. Light absorption can be the result of any chemical reaction known to those of skill in the art.<br>
[00012] "Light-Changeable Material": a material that absorbs, reflects, emits or otherwise alters electromagnetic radiation directed at the same. By "light-changeable compound" it is meant to include, without limitation, "light-sensitive", "light-emissive" and "light-absorbing" compounds, as defined below.<br>
[00013] "Light-emissive materials" refers to compounds and other materials that are involved in light emission in response to irradiation with light of a different wavelength. Light emission of interest can be a result of phosphorescence, chemiluminescence, or, fluorescence or polarized fluorescence. "Light emissive compounds," includes materials having one or more of the following properties: 1) they are a fluorescent, phosphorescent, or luminescent; 2) interact with components of the sample or the standard or both to yield at least one fluorescent, phosphorescent, or luminescent compound; or 3) interact with at least one fluorescent, phosphorescent, or luminescent compound in the sample, the standard, or both to alter emission at the emission wavelength. The emission wavelength can be any detectable wavelength including visible, infrared (including near infrared), and ultraviolet. Light, as used herein, likewise can be of any wavelength. Light-emissive compounds also include compounds that cause, or interact with components of the standard or sample to cause, or alter, Raman Scatter at a scatter or emission wavelength. The Raman effect occurs when light from a strong source (typically a laser) interacts with a material. Most of the light is absorbed or scattered without wavelength change but some of the light is scattered into other wavelengths (the Raman scatter).<br>
[00014] "Light-Sensitive Material": a material capable of being activated so as to change in a physically measurable manner, upon exposure to one or more wavelengths of light.<br>
[00015] For the purpose of the rest of the disclosure it is understood that the terms as defined above are intended whether such terms are in all initial cap, or not.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00016] The present invention provides for a system for authenticating products based upon measuring anticipated changes in absorption, reflection, or emission of authentication materials due to the physical characteristics of a genuine product or product package. More particularly, the present invention provides for a system for authenticating products based upon an expected differential effect in absorption, reflection or emission<br>
with respect to a defined plurality of authentication materials when the absorption, reflection and/or emission of the same are measured across one material versus another.<br>
[00017] In a preferred embodiment, a plurality of authentication materials, more preferably light-sensitive materials, more preferably light-changeable materials, more preferably light-absorbing, light-reflective, or light-emissive materials, is applied to the back of a product label to produce a fingerprint. Preferably, more than one such material is applied to the back of the label to allow multiple assessments of absorption, emission, reflection etc., at one time. The label is then preferably place against the side of the<br>
i<br>
product to which it is to be applied. Preferably, the authentication material is such that the material possesses or displays (such as emission of a light wavelength) at least one property that can be measured from the non-back side of the label. More preferably the authentication material is of such properties (such as intensity of emission) that such properties can be detected through the product and/or product container. When the label is applied to a product container, it is preferred that the container be of such construct (such as translucent) such that it does not interfere with excitation wavelengths impinging on the authentication material, and likewise does not interfere with the read of properties of authentication material through the container. Likewise, any change of property with respect to the authentication material, preferably, can be read through the product, and in a preferred embodiment such read through the container is dependent upon the product in the container. As would be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art, the product, product container and the particular authentication material preferably should be chosen allow excitation of the authentication material from outside the product container, and measurement of the response of the authentication material to the excitation form outside the product container.<br>
[00018] A preferred label may comprise a plurality of authentication materials, such as light-emitting materials, on its back (the portion typically in contact with the product or container housing the product). For example, a label could be marked on the back as shown below with nine different authentication materials displaying near infrared activity.<br>
(Drawing Removed)<br>
[00019] The label may then be placed onto a bottle that contains a product, such as cola or alcohol. An source capable of exciting one or more to the authentication materials may be used. Preferably more than one of such dyes would be excited by the source such that multiple changes can be registered with respect to the authentication materials such that a relative value may be obtained, for example relative fluorescent units. A device capable of both emitting the excitation source and receiving transmission of any response, such as increase in fluorescence, would be advantageous in that it would permit ease of detection of authenticity. The relative fluorescent units, etc. determined through the product acts as a fingerprint of the product authenticity, the product itself, and/or its container typically affecting such reads. Software may be used for example to recognize pre-selected patterns, and statistical software may be used to calculate when the product is non-authentic. Transmission and reading functions may be incorporated into a single device, such as the Verigard 300.<br>
[00020] As such the present invention permits the technology of portable product fingerprinting to be transferred to the inside of a label. The label may then be applied against the side of the product. Multiple authentication materials, such as infrared dyes, are preferred as they allow an array of emissions to pass through the product.<br>
[00021] When the authentication material, such as light-emissive authentication materials, are used, the detected profiles, such as the light-emissive profile, can be used to determine several factors, for example: (1) serial number determining the origin of the container; (2) if the container is authentic; (3) if the contents are authentic; (4) may act as a<br><br>
measure of safety when imaging the contents of beverage, water sample, or a pharmaceutical before purchase or drinking. The present invention therefore provides in its embodiments a significant advance in the areas of product tracking, authenticity and consumer safety.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00027] Is would be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art, a number of authentication materials can be use in the practice of the present invention. Some preferred materials are set forth below in Table 1.<br>
Table  1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [00028] A series of experiments was undertaken to demonstrate that authentication of the product in a bottle could be improved by using the method of the present invention, as well as other advantages could be achieved.<br>
Example 1<br>
[00029] The dyes were imaged through the label. To address the problem of making security markings resistant to rub off and solvent removal, the near infrared fluorescent dyes were placed under the label and a commercially available security camera (Verigard 300 camera) was used to image the dyes. Nine fluorescent dyes that have an excitation range of 710-735nm were placed onto an absorbent material (Fig.1). The label containing the dyes was then placed dye side against the side of a container (Fig. 2). An image of the dyes was then taken with the Verigard 300 camera (reference Veritec US Patent Application Serial No. 09/556,280), The Verigard 300 has two light emitting diode<br>
power supplies and a sensor that detects light from 740nm to about llOOnm. In this experiment the camera provides a means to detect the emission through to the label. The image from the Verigard 300 was then analyzed by exporting the image from the camera and importing it into a software program called Imagequant (Amersham Biosciences; Piscataway, NJ). Image not shown.<br>
Example 2<br>
[00030] The second set of experiments was designed to address the question of whether is was possible to image the dyes not only through the label alone (as described by Gosselin and Walfredo US 5,885,677), but also to image the dyes through the container. The dyes were placed onto an absorbent material exactly as described in the first set of experiments. In this experiment the label containing the dyes was placed dye side against the side of the container. An image of the dyes was then taken with the Verigard 300 camera through the empty container (Fig. 3). The image was then exported and analyzed using Imagequant software (shown in Fig. 5). Based on this data it was discovered that the NIR dyes could be imaged through the container.<br>
Example 3<br>
[00031] The Dye label system, Lab on a Label, (LOL) was applied to a container full of product. In this set of experiments the dyes were made up and placed on the label as previously described. An image of the LOL label was taken with the Verigard 300 camera through a full bottle of Scotch Whiskey (Johnnie Walker Red Label®). The image was then exported and analyzed using Imagequant software (shown in Fig. 6). Based on this data, it was discovered that the NIR dyes could be imaged through a full container. If the NIR dyes had been placed using a continuous ink jet printer (CIJ) or another printing method then the camera could read a security code on the back of the label. The image would not be visible to the eye but could provide a mark for bottle origin and whether the bottle was authentic.<br>
Example 4<br>
[00032] In this set of experiments the dyes were made up and placed on the label as previously described. An image of the LOL the label was taken with the Verigard 300 camera using the same LOL label as used in the previous experiment. This time the label was applied face against a different but closely related bottle of Scotch Whiskey (Johnnie Walker Black®). The resulting pattern after analysis with Imagequant software detects a difference between the two scotches (Fig. 7). In the same set of experiments is was possible to show with using the same LOL label that the system could differentiate the difference between Pepsi® (Fig. 5) and RC® (Fig. 9) cola when imaged through the container. Such technique could be used to verify the safety of a product or its authenticity.<br>
Example 5<br>
[00033] Studies were undertaken to determine whether the V-300 can read through opposite side of different labels and to study the variation in the fluorescence of the various dye combinations when placed on the inside of a label and read across the other end of a bottle, either filled with a liquid or empty.<br>
Dye Formulations:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [00034] The dyes were made up in the concentrations listed above in halo minus varnish (678) and applied using a micropipette. One micro liter was dispensed per spot. The order the dyes were applied is as follows.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [00035] After the application of the dye pairs, they were allowed to dry for ninety minutes, After drying, various images were taken. The label was affixed to a 24 fluid ounce bottle of Pepsi® and an image was taken across the filled bottle. The bottle was then emptied and an image was taken across the empty bottle. The bottle was then filled with RC Cola® and a third image was taken using the V300 camera. The same Pepsi® label was then taped onto a 1.75 L glass bottle of Johnny Walker Black Label® Whiskey (full) and an image was taken of this across the bottle. Finally, the label was attached to a 1.75 L glass bottle of Johnny Walker Red Label® Whiskey (full).<br>
