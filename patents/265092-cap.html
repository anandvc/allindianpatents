Caps, containers and methods The invention relates to caps, containers and methods for manufacturing and opening caps.<br>
Pressure caps (200) are known that are made of plastic, shown in Figures 1 and 2,  that are associable with a container (204). These caps comprise a closing part (201) provided with a retaining element (202) that engages a neck (2 03) of the container.<br>
The known caps are furthermore provided with a tamperproof ring (205) that, before opening, surrounds the neck. The tamperproof ring is connected to the closing part of the cap by means of fracturable elements.<br>
The tamperproof ring is furthermore provided with hooking elements that prevent the closing part from being removed from the tamperproof ring, and thus the opening of the container, without breaking of" the f racturable elements occurring.<br>
From the tamperproof ring an appendage (206) pro j ects arranged for being grasped by a user.<br>
By exerting a force on the appendage it is possible to break the fracturable elements and possibly separate the tamperproof ring from the body of the cap.<br>
Subsequently, the user, by acting on the closing part, can remove the retaining element from the neck and thus open the container.<br>
A drawback of known pressure caps consists of the fact that they are removable from the respective containers with a certain difficulty.<br>
In a first phase the user in fact has to break the fracturable elements by acting on the appendage of the tamperproof ring and subsequently removing the closing part from the neck.<br>
To open the containers the user necessarily has to use both hands, one hand is in fact used to grasp the container whereas the other' hand is used to act on the appendage in order to break the fracturable elements.<br><br>
Known caps cannot therefore be used for applications for<br>
which the possibility of opening the containers using only<br>
one hand is required, such as, for example, in the case of<br>
containers the contents of which have to be consumed during<br>
the course of a sporting activity, such as a bicycle ride or<br>
the like.<br>
Screw caps (300) are furthermore known, shown in Figures 3<br>
and 4, provided with a body (301) screwable on a threaded<br>
end of a container and of a closing part (3 02) connected to<br>
the body by means of a hinge element (303) .<br>
A drawback of the caps disclosed above is that they are very<br>
complicated and expensive to make.<br>
These caps are in fact obtained through injection moulding<br>
of plastic material inside very complicated moulds.<br>
An object of the invention is to improve known pressure<br>
caps.<br>
Another object of the invention is to obtain pressure caps<br>
that can be opened easily.<br>
A further object of the invention is to obtain pressure caps<br>
that are. easily reclosable after a first opening.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to obtain caps<br>
provided with a hinge interposed between a closing part and<br>
a fixing part fixing to a container that can be manufactured<br>
without the use of complex moulds.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to obtain<br>
pressure caps that can be associated with usual threaded<br>
necks of containers.<br>
A still further object is  to obtain containers that are<br>
particularly suitable for being shut with pressure caps.<br>
In a first aspect of the invention, a pressure cap is<br>
provided,  comprising a closure part associable with an<br>
opening of a container, engaging means associable with a<br>
neck of said container, said engaging means being provided<br>
with retaining means for engaging a projection of said<br>
container, a line of intended opening, in said engaging means<br>
interposed between a side body of said engaging means and<br><br>
said closing part, said line of intended opening being defined by fracturable means, characterised in that said line of intended opening and said closing part are positioned in relation to one another so that said fracturable means break along said line of intended opening when said closing part is induced to detach itself from said side body.<br>
Owing to this aspect of the invention, it is possible to obtain a pressure cap that is provided with opening indicating means and that can be easily opened by a user, possibly with just one hand.<br>
This enables a significant improvement to be obtained with respect to the state of the art which provides only two types of pressure caps. A first type consisting of easily openable caps, but devoid of opening indicating means, and a second type consisting of caps provided with opening indicating means but which are complicated to open. Owing to the invention, when the first opening of the container occurs the fracturable means is substantially fractured simultaneously to the removal of the closing part. It is not therefore necessary to perform two distinct operations, a first breaking operation of the fracturable elements and a second removing operation of the closing part.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, a screw cap is provided, comprising a side body screwable on a neck of a container and a closing part associable with an opening of said container, characterised in that it furthermore comprises a line of intended opening arranged substantially at the interface between said side body and said closing part,<br>
Owing to this aspect of , the invention, it is possible to obtain a screw cap that can be opened without removing the side body from the neck, unscrewing it from the latter. In particular,  the closing part can define a pressure closing element associated with an opening of the container.<br><br>
In this way, it is possible to obtain easily openable caps, for example pressure caps, that can be associated with usual threaded necks and can be manufactured using usual moulds for forming plastic material, such caps being provided with opening indicating means that indicate to a user whether the container has been tampered with prior to the first use. In a third aspect of the invention, a method is provided for opening a screw cap, said cap comprising a side body screwable on a neck of a container, a closing . part associable with an opening of said container and a line of intended opening defined by fracturable means and arranged substantially at the interface between said side body and said closing part, comprising screwing said side body onto said neck so that an edge of said neck interacts with said closing part to break said fracturable means along said line of intended opening.<br>
Owing to this aspect of the invention, it is possible to obtain a very simple method for opening a screw cap. In a fourth aspect of the invention, a screw cap is provided, comprising a side body screwable on a neck of a container and a closing part associable with an opening of said container, characterised in that it furthermore comprises unscrewing promoting means arranged for partially unscrewing said side body from said neck after a first opening of said cap.<br>
Owing ' to this aspect of the invention, it is possible to obtain a cap that can easily be opened by screwing the side body onto the neck, so that an edge of the neck interacts with the closing part to break the fracturable means along the line of intended opening. Subsequently to the opening, the unscrewing promoting means partially unscrews the side body from the neck so as to position the side body suitably with respect to the neck.<br>
In this case, if between the side body and the closing part a hinge is provided the unscrewing promoting means positions the side body so that the closing part, by rotating around<br><br>
the hinge, can engage the neck correctly for enabling the<br>
container to be closed again after a first opening.<br>
In a fifth aspect of the invention, a cap is provided,<br>
comprising  a  side  body associable  with  a neck  of  a<br>
container, a closing part associable with an opening of said<br>
container and a line of intended opening interposed between<br>
said side body and said closing part, characterised in that<br>
it furthermore comprises a wall thickening on said line of<br>
intended opening so as form hinge means that connect said<br>
side body and said closing part.<br>
Owing to this aspect of the invention, it is possible to<br>
obtain a cap provided with hinge means made extremely<br>
simply.<br>
In particular, it is possible to obtain a cap provided with<br>
hinge means by means of moulding of plastic material,<br>
without very complex moulds having to be used.<br>
During the first opening of the cap, the portion of the line<br>
of intended opening that is not affected by the wall<br>
thickening fractures, whereas the wall thickening, owing to<br>
the greater section, is not fractured and defines the hinge<br>
means around which the closing part can rotate in relation<br>
to the side body to enable the dispensing of a product<br>
contained in the container.<br>
In a sixth aspect of the invention, a container is provided,<br>
comprising a neck provided with a, dispensing end having a<br>
transverse dimension that is greater than the transverse<br>
dimension of a remaining part of neck, characterised in that<br>
the  dispensing  end  comprises  wall  means  having  a<br>
substantially uniform thickness -<br>
In a seventh aspect of the invention,  a container is<br>
provided compris ing a neck provided with a di spens ing end<br>
defined by wall means, characterised in that it furthermore<br>
comprises projection means extending from an intermediate<br>
portion of said wall means.<br><br>
Owing to these aspects of the invention it is possible to obtain containers that are particular suitable for being closed by pressure caps.<br>
In an eighth aspect of the invention, a container is provided comprising a neck provided with a dispensing end having a transverse dimension that is greater than the transverse dimension of a remaining part of neck, said dispensing end defining in said container a projection in which retaining means of a cap is engageable, characterised in that it furthermore comprises a further projection that cooperates with said projection to define seat means in which said retaining means is receivable.<br>
In a ninth aspect of the invention, a combination of a cap comprising retaining means with a container comprising a neck provided with a dispensing -end having a transverse dimension that is greater than the transverse dimension of a remaining part of neck is provided, said dispensing end defining in said container a projection in which said retaining means is engageable, and a further projection that cooperates with said projection to define seat means in which said retaining means is receivable.<br>
Owing to these aspects of the invention, it is possible to obtain -a container that it is difficult to tamper with inasmuch as the retaining means is received inside the seat means.<br>
Furthermore, if a cap provided with a hinge is associated with the container, the. further projection acts as a positioning element for preventing a move of the retaining means with respect to the container, so that the container can be' easily closed after a first opening. A move of a side body of the container that is integral with the retaining means with respect to the neck could in fact prevent a closing part from engaging correctly with the neck. In a tenth aspect of the invention, a container is provided comprising a neck provided with an opening and with a projection projecting from said neck, said neck comprising<br><br>
wall means  extending between said projection and said<br>
opening, characterised in that said wall means comprises a<br>
substantially smooth external surface.<br>
In an eleventh aspect of the invention, a method is provided<br>
for producing a cap provided with a hinge,  comprising<br>
forming a side body of said cap, weakening said side body<br>
for obtaining a line of intended opening, characterised in<br>
that said weakening comprises obtaining in said side body,<br>
along said line of intended opening, a less weakened zone of<br>
a remaining part of said side body, said less weakened zone<br>
defining a hinge precursor.<br>
Owing to this aspect of the invention, it is possible to<br>
obtain a method for producing a cap provided with a hinge<br>
that it is very simple to actuate inasmuch as it does not<br>
require the use of complicated moulds.<br>
Furthermore, in the case of caps formed by inj ection or<br>
compression moulding of plastic material, the method is very<br>
cheap inasmuch as the hinge precursor is obtained by the<br>
same weakening operation with which the line of intended<br>
opening is obtained.-<br>
The method according to the invention does not therefore<br>
involve any additional complication with respect to the<br>
usual method of manufacture of the caps.<br>
In a twelfth aspect of the invention, a cap is provided,<br>
comprising a side body associable with a neck of  a<br>
container, a closing part associable with an opening of said<br>
container and a  line of  intended opening  defined by<br>
fracturable means and interposed between said side body and<br>
said closing part, characterised in that said fracturable<br>
means has non-uniform breaking resistance.<br>
Owing to this aspect of the invention, it is possible to<br>
obtain a cap the opening of which can be initiated by<br>
applying very modest force to the closing part.<br>
This enables a user to open the cap easily, possibly using<br>
just one hand.<br><br>

With reference to Figures 5 and 6 a cap 1 is shown that is<br>
associable with a neck 2 of a container 3.<br>
The cap 1 can be made of plastic material, for example<br>
through injection or compression moulding of plastics.<br>
The container 3 comprises a substantially cylindrical first<br>
wall 4  and a  substantially. cylindrical second wall  5<br>
arranged substantially coaxially, the second wall 5 having a<br>
diameter less than that of the first wall 4.<br>
The first wall 4 has a substantially constant thickness and<br>
defines a dispensing end of the container 3.<br>
Between the first wall 4 and the second wall 5 an annular<br>
wall 6 extends transversely to the latter that defines a<br>
collar 7.<br>
With reference to Figure 11, a variation of the container 3<br>
is shown in which from the first wall 4 a projection 25<br>
extends that is arranged for interacting with the cap 1, as<br>
will be disclosed in greater detail below.<br>
The projection 25 comprises a further annular wall 26<br>
extending substantially perpendicular with respect to the<br>
first wall 4 and a tilted- wall 27 interposed between the<br>
further annular wall 26 and the first wall 4,<br>
With reference to Figure 14,  another variation of the<br>
container 3 is shown comprising a side wall 28 from which a<br>
projection element 29 projects, nearer an opening-30 of the<br>
container 3,  and a second projection element 31, further<br>
away from the opening 30.<br>
The side wall 28 comprises a first substantially cylindrical<br>
portion 32, interposed between the first projection element<br>
29  and  the  opening  30,  and  a  second  substantially<br>
cylindrical  portion  33,  interposed  between  the  first<br>
projection 29 and the second projection element -31.<br>
The first portion 32  comprises  a  substantially  smooth<br>
external surface 34.<br>
The first portion 32 and the second portion 3 3 can have a<br>
substantially constant thickness.<br><br>
In addition, the first portion 32 and the second portion 33<br>
are shaped so that the container 3 is provided with a<br>
dispensing, end 35 having a substantially constant inner<br>
diameter.<br>
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, the cap 1 comprises a closing<br>
part 8 removably associable with the opening 30 and engaging<br>
means 10 provided with retaining means 11, provided with a<br>
hook-shaped end, that engages the collar 7.<br>
The engaging means 10 comprises a * side body 12 having a<br>
first end 13 from which the retaining means 11 projects and<br>
a second end 14, opposite the first end 13, at which a line<br>
of intended opening 15 is provided extending between the<br>
side body 12 and the closing part 8.<br>
The line of intended opening 15 is defined by a plurality of<br>
fracturable elements 16 that connect the closing part 8 to<br>
the side body 12, between adjacent fracturable elements 16<br>
there being interposed a weakened zone,  for example a<br>
through cut 17.<br>
When the closing part is moved away from the side body 12,<br>
the  fracturable  elements 16  are  fractured,  making  the<br>
opening of the cap 1 clear.<br>
In other words,  the  engaging means  10,  owing to  the<br>
retaining means 11 that prevents the cap 1 from being able<br>
to be removed from the container without breakage of the<br>
fracturable elements 16 occurring, acts like an antitamper<br>
ring that assures the integrity of the cap l.<br>
The closing part 8 comprises closing means 18 provided with<br>
an annular appendage 19 that projects from a face 23 of the<br>
closing part. 8 to be received inside the first wall 4.<br>
The annular appendage 19 is shaped so as to interact with<br>
interference with an internal surface 20 of the first wall<br>
4.<br>
The closing means 18 enables a seal to be achieved between<br>
the closing part 8 and the neck 2.<br><br>
Closing means comprising the annular appendage 19 is also<br>
provided in the embodiments of the cap 1 shown in the<br>
Figures 8 and from 10 to 14.<br>
The embodiment . of the cap 1 shown in Figure 7 is provided<br>
with a closing part 8 provided with closing means  18<br>
comprising a further annular appendage 21 that projects from<br>
the face 23 for surrounding the first wall 4.<br>
The further annular appendage 21 is shaped so as interact<br>
with ' interference with a substantially smooth external<br>
surface 22 of the first wall 4.<br>
With reference to Figure 9, the further annular appendage 21<br>
comprises a groove 65 arranged for receiving in a shapingly<br>
formed manner a fashioned edge 66 extending from the<br>
external surface 22.<br>
The closing means 18 may comprise, instead of the annular<br>
appendage 19,  or of the further annular appendage 21, *<br>
substantially  annular  and  circumferentially  fragmentary<br>
bodies, defined, for example, by a plurality of protruding<br>
elements extending from the face 23.<br>
As shown in Figure 8, the cap 1 may comprise a hinge 36 that<br>
connects the closing part 8 to the engaging means 10, so as<br>
to enable the cap' 1 to be closed again after a first<br>
opening.<br>
The hinge 3 6 may comprise a portion of the plastic material<br>
with which the cap 1 is made.<br>
The hinge 3 6 can be obtained in- different ways, which will<br>
be illustrated below.<br>
Some steps of a production cycle for producing caps through<br>
injection  or  compression  moulding  should  be  recalled<br>
preliminarily, i.e. in order to enable the manner of making<br>
the hinge to be better understood.<br>
The caps are obtained through injection or compression<br>
moulding of plastics.<br>
At the outlet of the mould each cap comprises a continuous<br>
side wall, i.e. devoid of a line of intended opening. In<br>
other words,  the cap comprises a closing part that is<br><br>
connected to respective engaging means without a line of<br>
intended opening being defined between the closing part and<br>
a side body.<br>
The  line  of  intended  opening  is  preferably  but  not<br>
necessarily obtained in the course of a subsequent step of<br>
the production cycle by making weakening between the closing<br>
part and the side body.<br>
This weakening can be obtained by making, using a suitable<br>
tool, a fragmentary cut - possibly a through cut -through<br>
the side wall of the cap. In this way fracturable elements<br>
are obtained having a thickness, radially measured, that is<br>
substantially the same as the initial thickness of the side<br>
wall.<br>
Alternatively, the weakening can be obtained by crushing the<br>
side wall so as to reduce the section thereof to promote<br>
breakage during first opening of the. cap.<br>
Still alternatively, the cap may comprise ribs distributed<br>
circumferentially on the side wall.<br>
In this case, the weakening can be obtained by making a cut<br>
that traverses, possibly completely, the entire thickness of<br>
the side wall but which does not substantially cut the ribs.<br>
As a result, the ribs form fracturable elements arranged for<br>
being fractured during first opening of the cap.<br>
As shown in Figure 15, the engaging means" 10 may comprise a<br>
wall thickening 37 that forms the hinge 36 and a plurality<br>
of ribs 38 arranged for forming the fracturable elements 16-.<br>
The ribs 3 8 project inside the cap 1.<br>
In an embodiment that is not - shown, the ribs can project<br>
outside the cap 1.<br>
During the manufacture, of the cap 1, the engaging means 10<br>
is made to interact with a tool that makes a cut that cuts ■<br>
the entire circumferal extent of the engaging means 10.<br>
The cut weakens the engaging means 10,  for example by<br>
completely traversing  the  latter  or  extending  for  a<br>
substantial part of the thickness thereof, but does not<br>
completely traverse the wall thickening 37, or the ribs 38.<br><br>
During a first opening of the cap 1, the fracturable elements 16 are fractured whereas the thickening 37 that is provided with a greater section, and therefore with greater resistance to breakage, does not break but is deformed, giving rise to the hinge 16.<br>
Owing to the invention, it is possible to make caps provided with hinges with extreme simplicity, inasmuch as it is not necessary to use the complicated moulds provided in the prior art.<br>
The moulds can in fact easily be designed with a geometry that is such as to enable the wall thickening 37 to be - obtained.in the caps. The caps provided with hinges. are thus obtained without increased costs or complications to the productive cycle, inasmuch as the wall thickening is obtained directly in the moulding step.<br>
The closing part 8 comprises opening promoting means 39 arranged at a zone of the closing part 8 substantially opposite the thickening 37.<br>
The ribs 38 have a growing circumferal extent proceeding from the opening promoting means 39 to the thickening 37. In this way fracturable elements 16 are obtained having a section and therefore a resistance to fracturing that is variable.<br>
In particular, first ribs 38a, second ribs 38b and third ribs 3 8c are  provided having gradually increasing circumferal extents.<br>
During the first opening of the cap 1, the first ribs 3 8a, which are those having a lesser circumferal extent, can be easily fractured by a user who acts on the opening promoting means 3 9.<br>
Subsequently, once the cap 1 has been partially opened, through the effect of greater leverage/torque, the user can fracture the second ribs 3 8b and the third ribs 3 8c easily, although the second ribs. 3 8b and the third ribs 38c have greater resistance to breakage than the first ribs 38a.<br><br>
In this way, a cap is obtained the fracturable elements of which have significant resistance, when the cap is applied to a container, to ensure a hermetic seal, even if inside the container the pressure differs with respect to the pressure outside the latter, as occurs in the case of containers filled with gassy drinks. At the same time, the fracturable elements can easily be<br>
*<br>
broken to ensure good . inviolability and to facilitate<br>
opening by the consumer.<br>
With reference to Figure 16, a cap is shown provided with<br>
the wall thickening 37 and with fracturable elements 16a,<br>
16b and 16c having variable circumferal extents.<br>
In this case, the fracturable elements 16 are obtained by<br>
cutting, for example with a through cut, the engaging means<br>
10 using a suitably fashioned tool, in particular a tool<br>
provided with a fragmentary blade, or anyway provided with.a.<br>
discontinuity, at least at the fracturable elements 16, and<br>
possibly also the thickening 37.<br>
With reference to Figure 17, a cap is shown that is not<br>
provided with the wall thickening 37.<br>
In this. case,  a hinge precursor 24 and the fracturable<br>
elements 16 are obtained by making a cut, possibly a through<br>
cut, through the engaging means 10, this cut not affecting<br>
zones of the engaging means 11 in which the fracturable<br>
elements 16 and the hinge precursor 24 have to be defined.<br>
Also in this case the use of a suitably fashioned cutting<br>
tool is provided for.<br>
With reference to Figure 18, a cap 1 is shown provided with<br>
a thickening 37. that projects outside the engaging means 10.<br>
In this case, the fracturable elements 36 are obtained by<br>
using a tool  shaped so as not to interact with the<br>
thickening 37.<br>
With reference to Figure 19, a cap 1 is shown provided with<br>
a line of intended opening 15 made by crushing the engaging<br>
means 10 so as to cause a decrease in the section thereof to<br>
promote breakage at the line of intended opening 15.<br><br>
The crushing can be irregular so as to obtain engaging means<br>
provided with a lesser thickness at a zone nearer the<br>
opening promoting means 39 and a larger thickness at a zone<br>
that is more distant from the opening promoting means 39.<br>
This enables a cap l to be obtained comprising a fracturable<br>
part. provided with limited resistance to breakage in an<br>
initial step of a first opening of the cap.<br>
In other words, irregular crushing has a similar effect to<br>
that obtained by providing fracturable - elements having<br>
variable circumferal extents.<br>
Alternatively to the crushing obtained with a suitable tool,<br>
the moulding mould can be shaped so as to mould. engaging<br>
means 10 having an irregular thickness.<br>
With reference to Figure 10, a cap 1 is shown provided with<br>
engaging means 10 the side body 12 of which is shaped as a<br>
frustoconical wall,  the diameter of  the side body 12<br>
decreasing proceeding from the closing part  8  to  the<br>
retaining means 11.<br>
With reference to Figures 7 and Figures 11 to 14, the cap 1<br>
comprises positioning means 40 arranged for substantially<br>
preventing a movement of the engaging means 10 with respect<br>
to the neck 2, particularly after a first opening of the cap<br>
1.<br>
The positioning means 40 enables the cap to be easily closed<br>
again after a first opening.<br>
If there is no positioning means 40, a movement of the side<br>
body  12  would prevent  the; closing part  8  associated<br>
therewith from engaging the neck 2 correctly to enable<br>
closing of the container 3.<br>
With reference to Figure 7,  the positioning means 40<br>
comprises an arresting element 59 provided at an end of the<br>
retaining means 11 and arranged for being supportingly<br>
received on a further collar 9 that protrudes from neck 2.<br>
In this case, the collar 7 and the further collar 9 define a<br>
cavity 62 in which the hook-shaped portion of the retaining<br>
means 11 is received.<br><br>
As the hook-shaped portion is substantially contained inside<br>
the cavity 62, disengagement of the retaining means 11 from<br>
the collar 7 by a saboteur and therefore tampering with the<br>
cap is substantially prevented.<br>
Alternatively, if the container 3 is not provided with the<br>
further collar 9, the cavity can be delimited below by a<br>
convex part of the container 3.<br>
With reference, to Figure 27, a container 3 is shown in which<br>
the cavity 62  is defined by the collar 7 and by an<br>
enlargement  63  extending  above. the  proj ection  7  and<br>
connected  to  it  by  a  connecting  wall  64  extending<br>
substantially perpendicularly to the collar 7.<br>
With reference to Figure 11,  the positioning means 40<br>
comprises shoulder means 41 extending inside the cap 1 so as<br>
be interposed between the retaining means 11 and the line of<br>
intended opening 15,<br>
The retaining means 11 and the shoulder means 41 are shaped<br>
so as to surround the projection 25.<br>
With reference to Figure 12,  the positioning means 40<br>
comprises abutting means 42 arranged for interacting with<br>
the neck 2.<br>
The abutting means 42 comprises portions 43 of the ribs 38<br>
associated with the side body 12 and supportingly received<br>
on the projection 25.<br>
With reference to Figure 13, the abutting means 42 comprises<br>
an abutting element 45, with which the engaging means 10 is<br>
provided, that interacts with an end zone 44 of the neck 2.<br>
In this case, the side body 12 comprises a first annular<br>
body 46, that surrounds the first wall 4', and- a second<br>
annular body 47 having a smaller dimension than that of the<br>
first annular body 46.<br>
The abutting element 45 comprises a portion of tilted wall<br>
that connects the first annular body 46 to the second<br>
annular body 47.<br>
The line of intended opening 15 extends between the second<br>
annular body 47 and the closing part 8,<br><br>
With reference to Figure 14, the abutting means 42 comprises<br>
a ring 48 provided at an end of the engaging means 10 and<br>
arranged for interacting with an upper edge 49 of the neck<br>
2.<br>
The ring 48 also acts as a seal element for preventing part<br>
of the contents of the container 3 from penetrating and<br>
possibly partially remaining in a gap defined between the<br>
neck 3 and the side body 12.<br>
With reference to Figure 20, a cap 1 is shown comprising<br>
engaging means 10 provided with a. side body 12 provided with<br>
a thread 55 arranged for engaging a further thread 56<br>
obtained on a neck 2 of a container 3.<br>
The neck 2 furthermore comprises projection means 57, that<br>
cooperates with retaining means 11 with which the engaging<br>
means 10 is provided, and collar .means 58..<br>
The cap 1 furthermore comprises a closing, part 8, between<br>
the closing part 8 and the side body 12 a line of intended<br>
opening 15 being provided.<br>
By acting on the closing part 8 it is possible to open the<br>
cap along the line of intended opening 15, to enable the<br>
dispensing of a product contained inside the container 3.<br>
In this way, it is possible to obtain a pressure cap that is<br>
applicable to a usual container provided with a threaded<br>
neck.<br>
The cap is openable with remarkable simplicity, possibly<br>
using a sole hand.<br>
The closing part 8 can be provided with an annular appendage<br>
19 . - or with a further annular appendage 21, similarly to<br>
what was disclosed with reference to Figures 7. and 9 -<br>
arranged to engage, respectively, an internal surface 20, or<br>
a substantially smooth external surface 22, of the neck 2.<br>
As shown in Figure 20, between the side body 2 and the<br>
closing part 8 there can be interposed a hinge 36, that<br>
enables the cap 1 to be reclosed after a first opening.<br>
In order to- facilitate the opening of the cap 1, promoting<br>
means 3 9 is provided that is obtained in a zone of the<br><br>
closing part 8 substantially opposite a further zone in<br>
which the hinge 36 is obtained.<br>
The opening promoting means 39 comprises an activating<br>
surface 50, on which the user exerts a force, which can be<br>
obtained, for example, in an appendage 51 projecting from<br>
the closing part 8, as shown in Figure 21, or in a recess 52<br>
obtained in the closing part 8, as shown in Figure 23.<br>
Alternatively,  the activating surface 50,  whether it be<br>
defined in the appendage 51,  or in the recess 52,  can<br>
peripherally affect the entire perimeter extent of the<br>
closing part 8.<br>
As shown by the dashed line in Figure 20,  the annular<br>
appendage 19 can have a variable height,  for example a<br>
decreasing height, by moving from the opening promtoting<br>
means 39 to the hinge 36, so as to promote the insertion of<br>
the annular appendage inside the wall 4.<br>
The cap 1 furthermore comprises a further line of intended<br>
opening 53 interposed between the side body 12 and hooking<br>
means 11 with which the engaging means 10 is provided.<br>
The line of intended opening 15,  the further line of<br>
intended opening 53 and the hinge 36 can be obtained with<br>
the methods disclosed with reference to Figures 5 to 19.<br>
It should be noted that caps provided with the line of<br>
intended opening 15 (and possibly with the hinge 36) and<br>
caps devoid of the line of intended opening 15 can be<br>
obtained from the same semifinished product manufactured by<br>
moulding plastics.<br>
A manufacturer of caps can choose to weaken the side wall of<br>
the aforesaid semifinished product for obtaining the line of<br>
intended opening 15, if he is interested in manufacturing<br>
caps according to the invention, or can decide not to weaken<br>
the aforementioned side wall, obtaining in this way usual<br>
caps that are applicable to threaded necks.<br>
Thus a method of cap production is provided that is very<br>
versatile,  inasmuch as  it  enables  a .change  from the<br><br>
production of caps of a certain type to caps of a different<br>
type to be made with extreme facility.<br>
The  further  line  of  intended  opening  53  acts  as  an<br>
indicating element for indicating a possible opening of the<br>
container 3 achieved by unscrewing the side body 2 from the<br>
neck 3.<br>
With reference to Figure 22, a hood 71 is shown that is.<br>
associable, for example by pressure, with the cap 1 so as to<br>
substantially cover the closing part 8. The hood 71 protects<br>
a part of the cap 1 from impurities that may come into<br>
direct contact with the mouth of a user.<br>
The hood 71 can easily be removed.before opening of .the cap<br>
1.<br>
Also the cap embodiment specified in Figure 14 can be<br>
equipped with a hood 71.<br>
During bottling, a container 3, after being filled with a<br>
product, is closed with a cap 1, which is screwed onto the<br>
neck 3 by a capping head.<br>
An opening mode of the cap according to the invention may<br>
consist of further screwing of the cap 1 onto' the neck 2,<br>
which makes an  edge 44 of the neck 2 interact with the<br>
closing part 8, so as to break fracturable elements 36 that<br>
define the line of intended opening 15 and to remove the<br>
closing part 8 from the neck 2.<br>
With reference to Figure 28, a cap 1 is shown comprising<br>
unscrewing  promoting  means  67  arranged  for  partially<br>
unscrewing the side body 12 from the neck- 2 after a first<br>
opening of the-cap 1, for example carried out through the<br>
method disclosed above.<br>
The unscrewing promoting means 67 acts as a positioning<br>
means that positions the side body 12 so that the closing<br>
part 8, by rotating around the hinge 36, can correctly<br>
engage the. neck 2 to enable the container 3 to be closed<br>
again after a first opening.<br>
The unscrewing promoting means 67 comprises resilient means<br>
68, for example an appendage 69 of the side body 12, shaped<br><br>
so as to interact with activating means 70 associated with<br>
the neck 2.<br>
If it is preferable to prevent the opening mode disclosed<br>
above, for example to prevent undesired breakages of the<br>
fracturable elements 36 during application of the cap by the<br>
capping head, using antiscrewing means 54 is provided for.<br>
The antiscrewing means 54 also acts as positioning means<br>
that prevents a movement of the side body 12 with respect to<br>
the neck 2, to enable the cap 1 to be able to be closed<br>
again easily after a first opening.<br>
As shown in Figure 20, the antiscrewing means 54 comprises<br>
portions 43 of ribs 38 that define the fracturable elements<br>
36 of the line of intended openipg 15.<br>
The portions 43 are supportingly received on the further<br>
thread 56.<br>
As shown in Figure 21, the antiscrewing means 54 comprises a<br>
ring 48 provided at an end of the side body 12 and arranged<br>
for being supportingly' received on an upper edge 49 of the<br>
neck 2.<br>
As the ring 48 is arranged abutting against the upper edge<br>
49,  the side body 12 prevents portions of a product<br>
contained in the container 3 from penetrating a gap defined<br>
between the side body 12 and the neck 2.<br>
As shown in Figure 24, the antiscrewing means 54 comprises<br>
shoulder  means  41  arranged  for  interacting  with  the<br>
projection means 57, so that the latter is received between<br>
the shoulder means 41 and the retaining means 11.<br>
As shown in Figure 25, the antiscrewing means 54 comprises<br>
an arresting element 59 associated with the thread 55 and<br>
arranged for interacting with the further thread 56 for<br>
arresting the screwing of the side body 12 on the neck 2.<br>
In this case, .the ring 48 acts as a seal element to prevent<br>
part of the contents of the container 3 from penetrating and<br>
possibly stagnating in a gap defined between the neck 3 and<br>
the side body 12.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 26, the antiscrewing means 54 comprises a further arresting element 60 provided at an end 61 of the retaining means 11 and arranged for being supportingly received on the collar.means 58.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
