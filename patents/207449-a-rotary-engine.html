				<td>Background of invention;<br>
This relation relates to IC engines in general and more particularly pertains to a new rotary engine. Existing IC engines have certain drawbacks like low efficiency less efficient transfer of power to shaft and lower power to weight ratio etc. Various rotary engine structure has been proposed in the prior art. Some have narrow working compartment resulting in high drag  others have very bad combustion chamber geometry which can not be altered. Some have complicated mechanisms to provide unidirectional rotation, some others are bidirectional. And constant volume heat addition is not possible in prior arts.<br>
Object of invention;<br>
In view of the forgoing disadvantages present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new rotary engine construction with wider compartments, with combustion chamber for which geometry can be altered without changing other construction details of engine, with unidirectional rotation of rotor without any complicated mechanisms and with constant volume heat addition capability.<br>
Summary of invention;<br>
To attain the above said objectives, the present invention generally comprises a casing, rotor, stoppers, valves and cams. The casing has a cavity and rotor is placed inside it, combustion chamber is placed on the peripheral of the casing. The rotor is rotating circularly around a fixed shaft. Stoppers are used to get the sequence intake , compression, expansion, exhaust without changing the direction of rotor ( without reciprocating motion) or complex movement of rotor (like in Wankel engine). Valves are used for intake and exhaust. Intake takes place between intake stopper and lobe of rotor through intake valve. After intake the charge is compressed between lobe and intake stopper and goes into combustion chamber as rotor rotates and completely goes into combustion chamber. And then combustion takes place. When lobe crosses the combustion chamber opening expansion takes place between lobe and exhaust stopper and pushes rotor. This is how compression and expansion take place with out changing the rotors rotating direction. After that exhaust take place between exhaust stopper and lobe, through exhaust valve. Constant volume heat addition is achieved by increasing the width of the lobe"s end such that it closes the opening of combustion chamber for the time required for complete combustion of charge as lobes end crosses combustion<br>

Detailed description of the invention with reference to drawing:<br>
.The rotary engine of the present invention is a heat engine. It is rotary in type. Cycle used is Otto cycle and other cycles similar to it can be used. Stoppers are used to get the sequence intake compression, expansion, and exhaust. Descriptions of its components are given below. Numbers in parenthesis or bracket correspond to numbers in the drawing in their respective jgheets unless otherwise specified.<br>
Casing; Casing is shown in sheet2 it has an internal cavity of a shape of hollow cylinder with one end closed. The closed end has a hole (15) for inserting rotor"s shaft. The casing also has two smaller cavities for combustion chambers (1, 2) at diametrically opposite ends. Opening of combustion chamber is towards the center of casing. Combustion chamber has provisions for spark plug or injector. Volume of combustion chamber can be changed according to the compression ratio without affecting the casing volume. It has rectangular slots for Exhaust Stopperl (4), Exhaust Stopper2 (6), Intake stopperl (3) and Intake stopper2 (5) at diametrically opposite ends. It has seats for Intake Valvel (7), Intake Valve2 (9), Exhaust Valvel (8), Exhaust Valve2 (10). It also has ports to each of the valves fi-om outside (11,12,13 and 14). Casing has a top lid (16) to close it.<br>
Rotor; Rotor is shown in sheet 8. Rotor has two lobes (1 and 2) at diamstrically opposite side. It has a central shaft (3), which is the drive shaft. Maximum diametbr of the rotor is almost equal to casings inner diameter with some gap for fi:ee rotation. By increasing the width of lobe2 (1) at the edge we can increase constant volume heat addition time thereby increasing efficiency. So early ignition is not necessary, because of that backpressure will be less. By increasing steepness of the curve of rotor before lobe2 (1) (beginning of exhaust region) we can increase the torque on shaft. Since intake area and exhaust area are separate in rotor by increasing exhaust area without changing intake area we can increase efficiency (maintaining compression ratio).<br>
Intake Stopper assembly; It is shown in sheet 9. There are two intake stopper assemblies. They are positioned diametrically opposite side of casing. Each assembly comprises of stopper (3), bracket (4) and connecting block with rollers (5). The stopped can move relative to bracket only longitudinally about 2mm of distance.

Working procedure of the embodiment of invention<br>
Detailed description of the working procedure of the embodiment of invention with reference to drawings in sheet3, sheet4, sheet 5, sheet6:<br>
In the figure 1-4 in sheet 3, stoppers and valves position is shown for each 90° of rotation of rotor in counter clockwise direction. In the figure 1-4 in sheet 4, stoppers and valves position is shown for each 90° of rotation of rotor in the next revolution of rotor again in counterclockwise direction is shown. In sheets Valve and stopper timing is shown values in Y axis are the distance of valve or stoppers inner side fi-om center of rotor. Values in X axis are the degree of rotation of rotor"s lobel.<br>
hi sheets the operation timing of Intake valvel (1), Intake valve2 (2), Intake stopperl (3), Intake stopper2 (4), Exhaust valvel (5), Exhaust valve2 (6), Exhaust stopperl (7) and Exhaust stopper2 (8) are shown.<br>
In first diagram of sheet6 the sequence of intake (1), compression (2), Expansion (3) and exhaust (4) of 4 cycles with respect to degree of rotation of rotor are shown. In the second diagram, the cycles that happens through intake valvel (5) is grouped together. And cycles happens through intake valve2 is grouped (6) in another. In the third diagram repetition of these 4 cycles (a cycle comprises of the sequence of intake (1), compression (2), Expansion (3) and exhaust (4) ) are shown. A cycle completes in 2 revolution of rotor. And another cycle starts after 180° of rotation after the starting of previous cycle as shown in diagrams. ■Each stroke of the cycles last for 180°. There are four strokes of four independent cycles haj^pening at the same time in four different compartments inside engine.<br>
The following describes the operation of valves and stoppers to facilitate Cyclel. Cycle3 is similar to cyclel except that it starts after 360° degree of rotation of rotor after starting of Cyclel.<br>
At 100° of rotor"s lobel"s position Intake Stopperl starts operating (moving inward) tracing the outer profile of rotor. This allows Intake valvel to open allowing intake of cyclel (refer fig4 and figl in sheet3) As rotor rotates and lobel moves from 190°-280°   Intake<br><br>
Stopperl starts retracting and pulls Intake valvel to original position at 280° intake is complete.<br>
As rotor"s lobel crosses Intake Stopper2 at 280°, hitake Stopper2 starts operating. Allowing compression of charge between rotor"s lobe2 and Intake Stopper2.(refer figS in sheets). Compression continues until lobel reaches 450° (90°). At this time all the charge is compressed inside the combustion chamber2 and ignition takes place.<br>
When lobel is at 440°(80°) rotor"s lobe2 crosses Exhaust Stopper2, the Exhaust Stopper2 starts operating tracing rotor"s outer profile (refer fig4 in sheets and fig 1 in sheet 4). Expansion takes place between lobe2 and Exhaust Stopper2. Expansion continues until lobefreaches 620° (260°) (refer figl sheetS). From 540° - 620° (180° - 260°) of lobel"s position Exhaust Stopper2 starts retracting and stays in original position at 620°. ( refer figl and fig2 in sheet4).<br>
When lobel is at 620°(260°) rotor"s lobe2 crosses Exhaust Stopperl, the Exhaust Stopperl starts operating tracing rotor"s outer profile (refer fig2 and fig 3 in sheet 4). Exhaust Stopperl pushes Exhaust valvel to open it, allowing exhaust to take place. Exhaust continues until lobel reaches 800° (80°) (refer figS sheet4). From 720° - 800° (0° - 80°) of lobel"s position Exhaust Stopperl starts retracting and pulls Exhaust valvel to close at 800° Exhaust of cycle 1 is complete. (Refer fig3 and fig4 in sheet4).<br>
The following describes the operation of valves and stoppers to facilitate Cycle2. Cycle4 is similar to Cycle2 except that it starts after 360° degree of rotation of rotor after starting of Cycle2<br>
At 280° of rotor"s lobel"s po;ition Intake Stopper2 starts operating (moving inward) tracing the outer profile of rotor. This allows Intake valve2 to open allowing intake of cycle2 (refer fig2 and figS in sheet3) As rotor rotates and lobel moves from S60°-460° (0°-100°) Intake Stopper2 starts retracting and pulls Intake valvel to original position at 460° intake is complete.<br>
As rotor"s lobel crosses Intake Stopperl at 460°, Intake Stopperl starts operating allowing compression of charge between rotor"s lobe2 and Intake Stopperl (refer figl in sheets). Compression" dontinues until lobel reaches 630° (270°). At this time all the charge is compressed inside the combustion chamberl and ignition takes place.<br>
When lobel is at 620°(260°) rotor"s lobe2 crosses Exhaust Stopperl, the Exhaust Stopperl starts operating tracing rotor"s outer profile (refer fig2 and fig 3 in sheet 3). Expansion takes place between lobe2 and Exhaust Stopperl. Expansion continues until lobel reaches 800° (80°) (refer fig4 sheetS). From 720° - 800° (0° - 80°) of lobel"s position Exhaust Stopperl starts retracting and stays in original position at 800°. (Refer figS and fig4 in sheets).<br>
When lobel is at 800°(80°) rotor"s lobe2 crosses Exhaust Stopper2, the Exhaust Stopper2 starts operating tracing rotor"s outer profile (refer fig4 in sheet 3 and fig 1 in sheet 4). Exhaust Stopper2 pushes Exhaust valve2 to open it, allowing exhaust to take place. Exhaust continues until lobel reaches 980° (260°) (refer figl sheet4). From 900° - 980° (180° - 260°); of lobel"s position Exhaust Stopper2 starts reft-acting and pulls Exhaust valve 2 to close at 980° Exhaust of cycle2 is complete. (Refer figl and fig2 in sheet4).<br>
The following describes the operation of valves and stoppers in one revolution (360°) and state of four different compartments inside the engine. (Each compartment has one stroke of four independent cycles).<br><br>
At 100° of rotor"sposition as it crosses Intake Stopperl (refer fig 4. Sheet 3) Intake Stopperl starts operating, (moving inwards) tracing rotor"s outer profile. Since Intake stopperl is moved down Intake Valvel is now free to move and will be pushed down by spring. Allowing intake of cyclel (Note: A cycle consists of the sequence Intake, Compression, Expansion and Exhaust) at left side of Intake stopperl and compression of previous cycle at right side of Intake stopperl.<br>
At the same time at opposite side as Lobe2 crosses Exhaust Stopper2 (refer fig 4. sheet 3) Exhaust Stopper2 starts operating (moving inwards) tracing rotor"s outer profile. The projection in Exhaust Stopper2 pushes down Exhaust Valve2 to open it, allowing exhaust of second cycle before previous cycle at left side of Exhaust Stopper2 and expansion of cycle before previous one at right side of Exhaust Stopper2.<br>
From 10°-100° of rotor"s Lobe2"s position (refer fig 1. sheet 3) Intake stopperl will began to retract to its original position. And Intake Valvel will be pulled by the wedge like projection at the end of Intake stopperl. Intake of cyclel and compression of previous cycle will be over at 100° of rotor"s Lobei"s position.<br>
At 90 ° of rotor"s lobe2"s position combustion of previous cycle"s charge takes place at Combustion Chamberl (refer fig 2. sheet 3)<br>
From 190°-280° of rotor"s Lobel"s position (refer fig 1. sheet 3) Exhaust Stopper2 will began to retract to its original position. And Exhaust Valve2 will be pulled by the spring. Expansion of cycle before previous one and exhaust of second cycle before previous cycle will be over at 280° of rotor"s Lobel"s position.<br>
At 270° of rotor"s Lobel"s position as it crosses Intake Stopper2 (refer fig "2. Sheet 3) Intake Stopper2 starts operating (moving inwards) tracing rotor"s outer profile. Since Intake stopper2 is moved down Intake Valve2 is now free to move and will be pushed down by "spring. Allowing intake of cycle2 (Note: A cycle consists of the sequence Intake, Compression, Expansion and Exhaust) at right side of Intake stopper2 and compression of cyclel" at left side of Intake stopper2.<br>
