INDUSTRIAL PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF DIOL<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a diol<br>
industrially in a large amount stably for a prolonged period of time by<br>
continuously feeding a cyclic carbonate and an aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol into a reactive distillation column, carrying out a reactive<br>
distillation process, and obtaining a high boiling point reaction mixture<br>
having the diol as a main component thereof which is continuously<br>
withdrawn from the bottom of the reactive distillation column, and then<br>
continuously feeding the high boiling point reaction mixture into a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column for separating off material<br>
having a lower boiling point than that of the diol contained in the high<br>
boiling point reaction mixture, continuously obtaining the material having<br>
a lower boiling point than that of the diol as a column top component and<br>
a side cut component, and continuously obtaining the diol substantially<br>
not containing the material having a lower boiling point than that of the<br>
diol as a column bottom component.<br>
Background Art<br>
A reactive distillation process for producing a dialkyl carbonate<br>
and a diol through reaction between a cyclic carbonate and an aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol has been first disclosed by the present inventors<br>
(see Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
4-198141, Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
No. 4-230243, Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent Application<br><br>
Laid-Open No. 9-176061, Patent Document 4: Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 9-183744, Patent Document 5: Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-194435, Patent Document 6:<br>
International Publication No. W097/23445 (corresponding to European<br>
Patent No. 0889025, and U.S. Patent No. 5847189), Patent Document 7:<br>
International Publication No. W099/64382 (corresponding to European<br>
Patent No. 1086940, and U.S. Patent No. 6346638), Patent Document 8:<br>
International Publication No. WO00/51954 (corresponding to European<br>
Patent No. 1174406, and U.S. Patent No. 6479689), Patent Document 9:<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-308804, Patent<br>
Document 10: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-131394),<br>
and patent applications in which such a reactive distillation system is<br>
used have subsequently also been filed by other companies (see Patent<br>
Document 11: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 5-213830<br>
(corresponding to European Patent No. 0530615, and U.S. Patent No.<br>
5231212), Patent Document 12: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
No. 6-9507 (corresponding to European Patent No. 0569812, and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5359118), Patent Document 13: Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open No. 2003-119168 (corresponding to International Publication<br>
No. WO03/006418), Patent Document 14: Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open No. 2003-300936, Patent Document 15: Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 2003-342209). In the case of using a<br>
reactive distillation system for this reaction, the reaction can be made to<br>
proceed with a high conversion. However, reactive distillation<br>
processes proposed hitherto have related to producing the dialkyl<br>
carbonate and the diol either in small amounts or for a short period of<br><br>
time, and have not related to carrying out the production on an industrial<br>
scale stably for a prolonged period of time. That is, these processes<br>
have not attained the object of producing a diol continuously in a large<br>
amount (e.g. not less than 1 ton / hr) stably for a prolonged period of<br>
time (e.g. not less than 1000 hours, preferably not less than 3000 hours,<br>
more preferably not less than 5000 hours).<br>
For example, the maximum values of the height (H: cm), diameter<br>
(D: cm), and number of stages (n) of the reactive distillation column, the<br>
amount produced P (kg / hr) of ethylene glycol, and the continuous<br>
production time T (hr) in examples disclosed for the production of<br>
dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylene glycol (EG) from ethylene<br>
carbonate and methanol are as in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
In Patent Document 14 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
No. 2003-300936), it is stated at paragraph 0060 "The present example<br>
uses the same process flow as for the preferred mode shown in FIG. 1<br>
described above, and was carried out with the object of operating a<br>
commercial scale apparatus for producing dimethyl carbonate and<br>
ethylene glycol through transesterification by a catalytic conversion<br>
reaction between ethylene carbonate and methanol. Note that the<br>
following numerical values in the present example can be adequately<br>
used in the operation of an actual apparatus", and as that example it is<br>
stated that 2490 kg / hr of ethylene glycol was specifically produced.<br><br>
The scale described in that example corresponds to an annual production<br>
of 30,000 or more tons of dimethyl carbonate, and hence this implies that<br>
operation of the world's largest scale commercial plant using this process<br>
had been carried out at the time of the filing of the patent application for<br>
Patent Document 14 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
2003-300936) (April 9, 2002). However, even at the time of filing the<br>
present application, there is not the above fact at all. Moreover, in the<br>
example of Patent Document 14 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
No. 2003-300936), exactly the same value as the theoretically calculated<br>
value is stated for the amount of dimethyl carbonate produced, but the<br>
yield for ethylene glycol is approximately 85.6%, and the selectivity is<br>
approximately 88.4%, and hence it cannot really be said that a high yield<br>
and high selectivity have been attained. In particular, the low selectivity<br>
indicates that this process has a fatal drawback as an industrial<br>
production process. (Note also that Patent Document 14 (Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-300936) was deemed to have<br>
been withdrawn on July 26, 2005 due to examination not having been<br>
requested).<br>
With such a reactive distillation process, there are very many<br>
causes of fluctuation such as composition variation due to reaction and<br>
composition variation due to distillation in the distillation column, and<br>
temperature variation and pressure variation in the column, and hence<br>
continuing stable operation for a prolonged period of time is often<br>
accompanied by difficulties, and in particular these difficulties are further<br>
increased in the case of handling large amounts. To continue mass<br>
production of a dialkyl carbonate and a diol using a reactive distillation<br><br>
process stably for a prolonged period of time while maintaining high yield<br>
and high selectivity, and thus produce a diol, the process must be<br>
cleverly devised. However, the only description of continuous stable<br>
production for a prolonged period of time with a reactive distillation<br>
process proposed hitherto has been the 200 to 400 hours in Patent<br>
Document 1 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 4-198141) and<br>
Patent Document 2 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
4-230243).<br>
The present inventors have proposed an industrial reactive<br>
distillation process that enables a dialkyl carbonate and a diol to be<br>
mass-produced continuously and stably for a prolonged period of time<br>
with high yield and high selectivity, but in addition to this, a process<br>
enabling a diol to be separated out and purified in a large amount stably<br>
for a prolonged period of time from a high boiling point reaction mixture<br>
continuously withdrawn in a large amount from a lower portion of the<br>
distillation column is also required, a process for producing a large<br>
amount of a diol with a high yield having been called for. The present<br>
invention has been devised to attain this object.<br>
As shown in Table 1, with the exception of Patent Document 14<br>
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-300936), the amount<br>
of the diol produced per hour using reactive distillation processes<br>
proposed hitherto has been a small amount. Moreover, with the process<br>
of Patent Document 14 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
2003-300936), it is stated that approximately 2490 kg / hr of ethylene<br>
glycol containing approximately 130 kg / hr of unreacted ethylene<br>
carbonate and approximately 226 kg / hr of dihydroxyethyl carbonate was<br><br>
obtained as a column bottom component from a fourth step distillation<br>
column. However, this is merely a statement of the composition of the<br>
reaction mixture, there being no description whatsoever of production of<br>
a diol.<br>
As a process for producing a diol of relatively high purity using<br>
reactive distillation and a diol purifying column, a process is known in<br>
which the diol is obtained from a side cut of the diol purifying column.<br>
For example, in the example (FIG. 5) in Patent Document 12 (Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-9507 (corresponding to European<br>
Patent No. 0569812, and U.S. Patent No. 5359118)), a high boiling point<br>
reaction mixture withdrawn from a lower portion of a reactive distillation<br>
column is fed into a thin film evaporator (III), high boiling point material<br>
obtained therefrom is fed into a thin film evaporator (IV), low boiling point<br>
evaporated material obtained therefrom is fed into a distillation column<br>
(VII), and ethylene glycol is obtained as a side cut component 22 from a<br>
concentrating portion of the distillation column (VII), and then purification<br>
is further carried out using a purifier (IX), whereby ethylene glycol is<br>
produced in an amount of 255 g / hr. That is, in the process of Patent<br>
Document 12 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-9507<br>
(corresponding to European Patent No. 0569812, and U.S. Patent No.<br>
5359118)), ethylene glycol is not obtained from the high boiling point<br>
reaction mixture until four purifying apparatuses have been used.<br>
Furthermore, the process of Patent Document 12 (Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 6-9507 (corresponding to European Patent No.<br>
0569812, and U.S. Patent No. 5359118)) is a process in which a small<br>
amount of ethylene glycol is produced, there being no suggestions<br><br>
whatsoever regarding a process for producing a large amount (e.g. not<br>
less than 1 ton / hr) of a diol stably for a prolonged period of time (e.g.<br>
not less than 5000 hours).<br>
Moreover, in, for example, example 1 (FIG. 5) in Patent Document<br>
15 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-342209), a high<br>
boiling point reaction mixture withdrawn from a lower portion of a<br>
reactive distillation column is fed into a second distillation column 4, high<br>
boiling point material obtained therefrom is fed into a hydrolysis reactor 7,<br>
the reaction mixture therefrom is fed into a decarboxylation tank<br>
(gas-liquid separator 8), a liquid component obtained therefrom is fed<br>
into a third distillation column 10, and ethylene glycol is produced in an<br>
amount of 19 kg / hr as a side cut component from a stripping section of<br>
the third distillation column 10. However, with the process of Patent<br>
Document 15 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-342209),<br>
the ethylene glycol obtained contains 0.2 % by weight of diethylene<br>
glycol. To obtain ethylene glycol as required as a starting material for a<br>
PET fiber or a PET resin using the process of Patent Document 15<br>
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-342209), at least one<br>
further purifying apparatus is thus required. That is, with the process of<br>
Patent Document 15 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
2003-342209), ethylene glycol is obtained from a side cut outlet installed<br>
in the stripping section, which is below an inlet for feeding into the<br>
distillation column, but the purity of the ethylene glycol is insufficient,<br>
and moreover the process of Patent Document 15 (Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 2003-342209) is a process in which a small<br>
amount of ethylene glycol is produced, there being no suggestions<br><br>
whatsoever regarding a process for producing a large amount (e.g. not<br>
less than 1 ton / hr) of a diol stably for a prolonged period of time (e.g.<br>
not less than 5000 hours).<br>
Moreover, in, for example, example 10 (FIG. 6) in Patent<br>
Document 8 (International Publication No. WO00/51954 (corresponding<br>
to European Patent No. 1174406, and U.S. Patent No. 6479689)) and<br>
example 1 (FIG. 1) in Patent Document 9 (Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open No. 2002-308804), ethylene glycol is obtained from a side cut<br>
outlet installed in an enrichment section of an EG purifying column 41,<br>
which is above an inlet for feeding into the column, but in each case the<br>
amount produced is a small amount of less than 200 g / hr, there being<br>
no suggestions whatsoever regarding a process for producing a large<br>
amount (e.g. not less than 1 ton / hr) of a diol stably for a prolonged<br>
period of time (e.g. not less than 5000 hours).<br>
Approximately 16 million tons per year (2004) of ethylene glycol is<br>
produced worldwide, but hitherto all of this has been through a hydration<br>
method in which water is added to ethylene oxide. However, as shown<br>
by the statement "Production of EG (ethylene glycol) is by a hydration<br>
reaction of EO (ethylene oxide), the reaction generally being carried out<br>
... at 150 to 200 °C. At this time, not only is the target substance MEG<br>
(monoethylene glycol) produced, but moreover DEG (diethylene glycol)<br>
and TEG (triethylene glycol) are also by-produced. The proportions of<br>
these products depend on the water / EO ratio, and to obtain MEG with a<br>
selectivity of approximately 90%, the water / EO ratio must be made to<br>
be approximately 20 as a molar ratio. A large amount of water must<br>
thus be distilled off in an EG purification step, and a large amount of<br><br>
thermal energy is consumed in this. ... With regard to synthesis of EG<br>
from EO, it is not an overstatement to say that this is an imperfect<br>
process from the viewpoint of energy efficiency." in Non-Patent<br>
Document 1 (Japan Petroleum Institute (ed.), "Sekiyu-kagaku Purosesu"<br>
("Petrochemical Processes"), pages 120 to 125, Kodansha, 2001), this<br>
industrial production process has great drawbacks both from the<br>
perspective of the ethylene glycol yield and selectivity, and the<br>
perspective of energy saving.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a specific<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Following is a detailed description of the present invention.<br>
The reaction of the present invention is a reversible equilibrium<br>
transesterification reaction represented by the following formula in which<br>
a dialkyl carbonate and a diol are produced from a cyclic carbonate and<br>
an aliphatic monohydric alcohol:<br><br>
wherein R1 represents a bivalent group -(CH2)m- (m is an integer from 2<br>
to 6), one or more of the hydrogens thereof being optionally substituted<br>
with an alkyl group or aryl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Moreover,<br>
R2 represents a monovalent aliphatic group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms,<br>
one or more of the hydrogens thereof being optionally substituted with an<br>
alkyl group or aryl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
The cyclic carbonate used as a starting material in the present<br>
invention is a compound represented by (A) in the above formula. For<br>
example, an alkylene carbonate such as ethylene carbonate or propylene<br>
carbonate, or 1,3-dioxacyclohexa-2-one, 1,3-dioxacyclohepta-2-one, or<br><br>
the like can be preferably used, ethylene carbonate or propylene<br>
carbonate being more preferably used due to ease of procurement and<br>
so on, and ethylene carbonate being particularly preferably used.<br>
Moreover, the aliphatic monohydric alcohol used as the other<br>
starting material is a compound represented by (B) in the above formula,<br>
one having a lower boiling point than that of the diol produced being<br>
used. Although possibly varying depending on the type of the cyclic<br>
carbonate used, examples of the cyclic carbonate include methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol (isomers), allyl alcohol, butanol (isomers), 3-buten-1-ol,<br>
amyl alcohol (isomers), hexyl alcohol (isomers), heptyl alcohol (isomers),<br>
octyl alcohol (isomers), nonyl alcohol (isomers), decyl alcohol (isomers),<br>
undecyl alcohol (isomers), dodecyl alcohol (isomers), cyclopentanol,<br>
cyclohexanol, cycloheptanol, cyclooctanol, methylcyclopentanol<br>
(isomers), ethylcyclopentanol (isomers), methylcyclohexanol (isomers),<br>
ethylcyclohexanol (isomers), dimethylcyclohexanol (isomers),<br>
diethylcyclohexanol (isomers), phenylcyclohexanol (isomers), benzyl<br>
alcohol, phenethyl alcohol (isomers), phenylpropanol (isomers), and so<br>
on. Furthermore, these aliphatic monohydric alcohols may be<br>
substituted with substituents such as halogens, lower alkoxy groups,<br>
cyano groups, alkoxycarbonyl groups, aryloxycarbonyl groups, acyloxy<br>
groups, and nitro groups.<br>
Of such aliphatic monohydric alcohols, ones preferably used are<br>
alcohols having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably alcohols having 1<br>
to 4 carbon atoms, i.e. methanol, ethanol, propanol (isomers), and<br>
butanol (isomers). In the case of using ethylene carbonate or propylene<br>
carbonate as the cyclic carbonate, preferable aliphatic monohydric<br><br>
alcohols are methanol and ethanol, methanol being particularly<br>
preferable.<br>
In the process of the present invention, a catalyst is made to be<br>
present in a reactive distillation column A. The method of making the<br>
catalyst be present in the reactive distillation column A may be any<br>
method, but in the case, for example, of a homogeneous catalyst that<br>
dissolves in the reaction liquid under the reaction conditions, the catalyst<br>
can be made to be present in a liquid phase in the reactive distillation<br>
column by feeding the catalyst into the reactive distillation column<br>
continuously, or in the case of a heterogeneous catalyst that does not<br>
dissolve in the reaction liquid under the reaction conditions, the catalyst<br>
can be made to be present in the reaction system by disposing the<br>
catalyst as a solid in the reactive distillation column; these methods may<br>
also be used in combination.<br>
In the case that a homogeneous catalyst is continuously fed into<br>
the reactive distillation column, the homogeneous catalyst may be fed in<br>
together with the cyclic carbonate and/or the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol, or may be fed in at a different position to the starting materials.<br>
The reaction actually proceeds in the distillation column in a region<br>
below the position at which the catalyst is fed in, and hence it is<br>
preferable to feed the catalyst into a region between the top of the<br>
column and the position(s) at which the starting materials are fed in.<br>
The catalyst must be present in at least 5 stages, preferably at least 7<br>
stages, more preferably at least 10 stages.<br>
Moreover, in the case of using a heterogeneous solid catalyst, the<br>
catalyst must be present in at least 5 stages, preferably at least 7 stages,<br><br>
more preferably at least 10 stages. A solid catalyst that also has an<br>
effect as a packing in the distillation column may also be used.<br>

material of the reaction, the reaction mixture, a reaction by-product or<br>
the like, the compound can be used as a homogeneous catalyst, whereas<br>
in the case that the compound does not dissolve, the compound can be<br>
used as a solid catalyst. Furthermore, it is also preferable to use, as a<br>
homogeneous catalyst, a mixture obtained by dissolving a compound as<br>
above in a starting material of the reaction, the reaction mixture, a<br>
reaction by-product or the like in advance, or by reacting to bring about<br>
dissolution.<br>
Furthermore, ion exchangers such as anion exchange resins<br>
having tertiary amino groups, ion exchange resins having amide groups,<br>
ion exchange resins having at least one type of exchange groups<br>
selected from sulfonate groups, carboxylate groups and phosphate<br>
groups, and solid strongly basic anion exchangers having quaternary<br>
ammonium groups as exchange groups; solid inorganic compounds such<br>
as silica, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, aluminosilicates, gallium<br><br>
silicate, various zeolites, various metal-exchanged zeolites, and<br>
ammonium-exchanged zeolites, and so on can also be used as a<br>
heterogeneous catalyst.<br>
As a heterogeneous catalyst, a particularly preferably used one is<br>
a solid strongly basic anion exchanger having quaternary ammonium<br>
groups as exchange groups, examples thereof including a strongly basic<br>
anion exchange resin having quaternary ammonium groups as exchange<br>
groups, a cellulose strongly basic anion exchanger having quaternary<br>
ammonium groups as exchange groups, and an inorganic carrier<br>
supported type strongly basic anion exchanger having quaternary<br>
ammonium groups as exchange groups. As a strongly basic anion<br>
exchange resin having quaternary ammonium groups as exchange groups,<br>
for example a styrene type strongly basic anion exchange resin or the<br>
like can be preferably used. A styrene type strongly basic anion<br>
exchange resin is a strongly basic anion exchange resin having a<br>
copolymer of styrene and divinylbenzene as a parent material, and<br>
having quaternary ammonium groups (type I or type II) as exchange<br>
groups, and can be schematically represented, for example, by the<br>
following formula:<br><br><br>
wherein X represents an anion; as X, generally at least one type of anion<br>
selected from F", CI", Br", I", HC03\ C032", CH3C02", HC02", I03", Br03",<br>
and CI03" is used, preferably at least one type of anion selected from CI",<br>
Br", HCO3", and C032". Moreover, as the structure of the resin parent<br>
material, either a gel type one or a macroreticular (MR) type one can be<br>
used, the MR type being particularly preferable due to the organic<br>
solvent resistance being high.<br>
An example of a cellulose strongly basic anion exchanger having<br>
quaternary ammonium groups as exchange groups is cellulose having<br>
-OCH2CH2NR3X exchange groups obtained by converting some or all of<br>
the -OH groups in the cellulose into trialkylaminoethyl groups. Here, R<br>
represents an alkyl group; methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or the like is<br>
generally used, preferably methyl or ethyl. Moreover, X represents an<br>
anion as above.<br><br>
An inorganic carrier supported type strongly basic anion<br>
exchanger having quaternary ammonium groups as exchange groups that<br>
can be used in the present invention means an inorganic carrier that has<br>
had -0(CH2)nNR3X quaternary ammonium groups introduced thereto by<br>
modifying some or all of the -OH surface hydroxyl groups of the<br>
inorganic carrier. Here, R and X are defined as above, n is generally<br>
an integer from 1 to 6, preferably n = 2. As the inorganic carrier, silica,<br>
alumina, silica-alumina, titania, a zeolite, or the like can be used, it being<br>
preferable to use silica, alumina, or silica-alumina, particularly preferably<br>
silica. Any method can be used as the method of modifying the surface<br>
hydroxyl groups of the inorganic carrier.<br>
As the solid strongly basic anion exchanger having quaternary<br>
ammonium groups as exchange groups, a commercially available one<br>
may be used. In this case, the anion exchanger may also be used as<br>
the transesterification catalyst after being subjected to ion exchange with<br>
a desired anionic species in advance as pretreatment.<br>
Moreover, a solid catalyst containing a macroreticular or gel-type<br>
organic polymer having bonded thereto heterocyclic groups each<br>
containing at least one nitrogen atom, or an inorganic carrier having<br>
bonded thereto heterocyclic groups each containing at least one nitrogen<br>
atom can also be preferably used as the transesterification catalyst.<br>
Furthermore, a solid catalyst in which some or all of these<br>
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic groups have been converted into a<br>
quaternary salt can be similarly used. Note that a solid catalyst such as<br>
an ion exchanger may also act as a packing in the present invention.<br>
The amount of the catalyst used in the present invention varies<br><br>
depending on the type of the catalyst used, but in the case of<br>
continuously feeding in a homogeneous catalyst that dissolves in the<br>
reaction liquid under the reaction conditions, the amount used is<br>
generally in a range of from 0.0001 to 50 % by weight, preferably from<br>
0.005 to 20 % by weight, more preferably from 0.01 to 10 % by weight, as<br>
a proportion of the total weight of the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol fed in as the starting materials. Moreover, in the<br>
case of using a solid catalyst installed in the distillation column, the<br>
catalyst is preferably used in an amount in a range of from 0.01 to 75<br>
vol%, more preferably from 0.05 to 60 vol%, yet more preferably from 0.1<br>
to 60 vol%, based on the empty column volume of the distillation column.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the method of continuously<br>
feeding the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol into<br>
the continuous multi-stage distillation column A constituting the reactive<br>
distillation column in the present invention; any feeding method may be<br>
used so long as the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol can be made to contact the catalyst in a region of at least 5<br>
stages, preferably at least 7 stages, more preferably at least 10 stages,<br>
of the distillation column A. That is, the cyclic carbonate and the<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol can be continuously fed in from a required<br>
number of inlets in stages of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column A satisfying the conditions described earlier. Moreover, the<br>
cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol may be introduced<br>
into the same stage of the distillation column, or may be introduced into<br>
different stages to one another.<br>
The starting materials may be fed continuously into the distillation<br><br>
column A in a liquid form, in a gaseous form, or as a mixture of a liquid<br>
and a gas. Other than feeding the starting materials into the distillation<br>
column A in this way, it is also preferable to additionally feed in a<br>
gaseous starting material intermittently or continuously from the lower<br>
portion of the distillation column A. Moreover, another preferable<br>
method is one in which the cyclic carbonate is continuously fed in a liquid<br>
form or a gas / liquid mixed form into a stage of the distillation column A<br>
above the stages in which the catalyst is present, and the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol is continuously fed in a gaseous form and / or a<br>
liquid form into the lower portion of the distillation column A. In this<br>
case, the cyclic carbonate may of course contain the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol.<br>
In the present invention, the starting materials fed in may contain<br>
the product dialkyl carbonate and / or diol. The content thereof is, for<br>
the dialkyl carbonate, generally in a range of from 0 to 40 % by weight,<br>
preferably from 0 to 30 % by weight, more preferably from 0 to 20 % by<br>
weight, in terms of the percentage by mass of the dialkyl carbonate in the<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol / dialkyl carbonate mixture, and is, for the<br>
diol, generally in a range of from 0 to 10 % by weight, preferably 0 to 7 %<br>
by weight, more preferably 0 to 5 % by weight, in terms of the percentage<br>
by weight of the diol in the cyclic carbonate / diol mixture.<br>
When carrying out the present reaction industrially, besides fresh<br>
cyclic carbonate and / or aliphatic monohydric alcohol newly introduced<br>
into the reaction system, material having the cyclic carbonate and / or<br>
the aliphatic monohydric alcohol as a main component thereof recovered<br>
from this process and / or another process can also be preferably used<br><br>
for the starting materials. It is an excellent characteristic feature of the<br>
present invention that this is possible. An example of another process<br>
is a process in which a diaryl carbonate is produced from the dialkyl<br>
carbonate and an aromatic monohydroxy compound, the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol being by-produced in this process and recovered.<br>
The recovered by-produced aliphatic monohydric alcohol generally often<br>
contains the dialkyl carbonate, the aromatic monohydroxy compound, an<br>
alkyl aryl ether and so on, and may also contain small amounts of an<br>
alkyl aryl carbonate, the diaryl carbonate and so on. The by-produced<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol may be used as is as a starting material in<br>
the present invention, or may be used as a starting material after the<br>
amount of contained material having a higher boiling point than the<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol has been reduced through distillation or the<br>
like.<br>
A cyclic carbonate preferably used in the present invention is one<br>
produced through reaction between, for example, an alkylene oxide such<br>
as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or styrene oxide and carbon dioxide;<br>
a cyclic carbonate containing small amounts of such starting material<br>
compounds or the like may be used as a starting material in the present<br>
invention.<br>
In the present invention, a ratio between the amounts of the cyclic<br>
carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol fed into the reactive<br>
distillation column A varies according to the type and amount of the<br>
transesterification catalyst and the reaction conditions, but a molar ratio<br>
of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol to the cyclic carbonate fed in is<br>
generally in a range of from 0.01 to 1000 times. To increase the cyclic<br><br>
carbonate conversion, it is preferable to feed in the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol in an excess of at least 2 times the number of mols of the cyclic<br>
carbonate. However, if an amount of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol<br>
used is too great, then it is necessary to make the apparatus larger. For<br>
such reasons, a molar ratio of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol to the<br>
cyclic carbonate is preferably in a range of from 2 to 20, more preferably<br>
from 3 to 15, yet more preferably from 5 to 12. Furthermore, if much<br>
unreacted cyclic carbonate remains, then the unreacted cyclic carbonate<br>
may react with the product diol to by-produce oligomers such as a dimer<br>
or a trimer, and hence in the case of industrial implementation, it is<br>
preferable to reduce the amount of unreacted cyclic carbonate remaining<br>
as much as possible. In the process of the present invention, even if<br>
the above molar ratio is not more than 10, the cyclic carbonate<br>
conversion can be made to be not less than 98%, preferably not less<br>
than 99%, more preferably not less than 99.9%. This is another<br>
characteristic feature of the present invention.<br>
In the present invention, preferably not less than approximately 1<br>
ton / hr of a high boiling point reaction mixture AB containing the diol is<br>
continuously produced in the reactive distillation column A, this being fed<br>
into a continuous multi-stage distillation column C, so as to produce not<br>
less than approximately 1 ton / hr of the diol substantially not containing<br>
material having a lower boiling point than that of the diol as a column<br>
bottom component CB; the minimum amount of the cyclic carbonate<br>
continuously fed in to achieve this is generally 1.55 P ton / hr, preferably<br>
1.5 P ton / hr, more preferably 1.45 P ton / hr, based on the amount P<br>
(ton / hr) of the diol to be produced. In a yet more preferable case, this<br><br>
amount can be made to be less than 1.43 P ton / hr.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column A for carrying out the reactive distillation process in<br>
the present invention, but the continuous multi-stage distillation column A<br>
is preferably one that enables not only distillation but also reaction to be<br>
carried out at the same time so as to be able to produce preferably not<br>
less than 1.5 ton / hr of the dialkyl carbonate and/or preferably not less<br>
than 1 ton / hr of the diol stably for a prolonged period of time.<br>
In the present invention, the diol is produced by taking the cyclic<br>
carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol as starting materials,<br>
continuously feeding the starting materials into the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column A in which the catalyst is present, carrying<br>
out reactive distillation in the column A, continuously withdrawing a low<br>
boiling point reaction mixture AT containing a produced dialkyl carbonate<br>
and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol from an upper portion of the column<br>
A in a gaseous form, continuously withdrawing a high boiling point<br>
reaction mixture AB containing a produced diol from a lower portion of the<br>
column A in a liquid form, continuously feeding the high boiling point<br>
reaction mixture AB into a continuous multi-stage distillation column C,<br>
continuously obtaining material having a lower boiling point than that of<br>
the diol contained in the high boiling point reaction mixture AB as a<br>
column top component CT and / or a side cut component Cs, and<br>
continuously obtaining the diol substantially not containing the material<br>
having a lower boiling point than that of the diol. The continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column C must thus have a function of enabling<br>
the material having a lower boiling point than that of the diol contained in<br><br>
the high boiling point reaction mixture AB to be removed efficiently as the<br>
column top component CT and / or the side cut component Cs; the<br>
present invention provides an industrial distillation apparatus having a<br>
specified structure having this function, and it has been discovered that<br>
by using this apparatus, the object of the present invention can be<br>
attained.<br>
The high boiling point reaction mixture AB may contain a trace to a<br>
small amount of unreacted cyclic carbonate. In this case, it is<br>
preferable to make it such that such unreacted cyclic carbonate is<br>
substantially not present in the column bottom component CB from the<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column C. To achieve this, it is<br>
preferable to add a small amount of water into the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column C so that the unreacted cyclic carbonate is converted<br>
into the diol through hydrolysis, and/or devise the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column C such that the unreacted cyclic carbonate is reacted<br>
with the diol and thus converted into a dialkylene glycol or the like (e.g.<br>
for a temperature and residence time required for this reaction to<br>
proceed to completion to be secured, for back mixing of the column<br>
bottom component to be reduced, etc.). As a result, it can be made to<br>
be such that there is substantially no unreacted cyclic carbonate in the<br>
column bottom component CB from the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column C, this being preferable when carrying out the present invention.<br>
Note that the term "substantially not containing" used in the<br>
present invention means that the content is not more than 50 ppm,<br>
preferably not more than 10 ppm, more preferably not more than 5 ppm.<br>
To attain the above object, the continuous multi-stage distillation<br><br>
column C used in the present invention must be made to simultaneously<br>
satisfy various conditions.<br>
Specifically, the continuous multi-stage distillation column C must<br>
be as follows:<br>
(a)	the continuous multi-stage distillation column C comprises a<br>
distillation column comprising a stripping section having a length L1 (cm),<br>
an inside diameter D1 (cm) and an internal with a number of stages ni<br>
thereinside, and an enrichment section having a length L2 (cm), an inside<br>
diameter D2 (cm) and an internal with a number of stages n2 thereinside,<br>
wherein L1, D1, n^ L2, D2, and n2 satisfy the following formulae (1) to (9):<br>
300 
50 
3 
3 
1000 <l2></l2>
50 
10<l2></l2>
20 
D2 
(b)	the enrichment section of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column C has at least one chimney tray installed therein as<br>
the internal, the chimney tray having installed therein one or more<br>
chimneys each having an opening having a cross-sectional area S (cm2)<br>
satisfying the formula (10):<br>
200<s></s>
and each of the chimneys being such that a height h (cm) from the<br><br>
opening of the chimney to a gas outlet of the chimney satisfies the<br>
formula (11):<br>
10<h and></h>
(c) a side cut outlet is connected to a liquid collecting portion of<br>
the chimney tray of the continuous multi-stage distillation column C.<br>
It has been discovered that by using such a continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column C, a column bottom component CB<br>
substantially not containing material having a lower boiling point than<br>
that of the diol can be produced on an industrial scale of not less than 1<br>
ton / hr, preferably not less than 2 tons / hr, more preferably not less<br>
than 3 tons / hr, stably for a prolonged period of time of, for example, not<br>
less than 1000 hours, preferably not less than 3000 hours, more<br>
preferably not less than 5000 hours, from a large amount of the high<br>
boiling point reaction mixture AB which has been produced through a<br>
reactive distillation process between the cyclic carbonate and the<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol. The reason why it has become possible to<br>
separate out and purify the diol on an industrial scale with such excellent<br>
effects by implementing the process according to the present invention is<br>
not clear, but this is supposed to be due to a composite effect brought<br>
about when the conditions of the formulae (1) to (11) are combined.<br>
Preferable ranges for the respective factors are described below.<br>
If L1 (cm) is less than 300, then the separation efficiency for the<br>
stripping section decreases, and hence the desired separation efficiency<br>
cannot be attained. Moreover, to keep down the equipment cost while<br>
securing the desired separation efficiency, L1 must be made to be not<br>
more than 3000. Furthermore, if L1 is greater than 3000, then the<br><br>
pressure difference between the top and bottom of the column becomes<br>
too great, and hence prolonged stable operation becomes difficult, and<br>
moreover it becomes necessary to increase the temperature in the lower<br>
portion of the column, and hence side reactions become liable to occur.<br>
A more preferable range for L^ (cm) is 500 
1500 being yet more preferable.<br>
If D1 (cm) is less than 50, then it is not possible to attain the<br>
desired distillation amount. Moreover, to keep down the equipment cost<br>
while attaining the desired distillation amount, D1 must be made to be not<br>
more than 700. A more preferable range for D^ (cm) is 70 
with 190 
If L1 I D1 is less than 3 or greater than 30, then prolonged stable<br>
operation becomes difficult. A more preferable range for L1 / D^ is 4 
If ni is less than 3, then the separation efficiency for the stripping<br>
section decreases and hence the desired separation efficiency cannot be<br>
attained. Moreover, to keep down the equipment cost while securing the<br>
desired separation efficiency, ni must be made to be not more than 30.<br>
Furthermore, if ni is greater than 30, then the pressure difference<br>
between the top and bottom of the column becomes too great, and hence<br>
prolonged stable operation becomes difficult, and moreover it becomes<br>
necessary to increase the temperature in the lower portion of the column,<br>
and hence side reactions become liable to occur. A more preferable<br>
range for ni is 5 
If L2 (cm) is less than 1000, then the separation efficiency for the<br>
enrichment section decreases, and hence the desired separation<br><br>
efficiency cannot be attained. Moreover, to keep down the equipment<br>
cost while securing the desired separation efficiency, L2 must be made to<br>
be not more than 5000. Furthermore, if L2 is greater than 5000, then the<br>
pressure difference between the top and bottom of the column becomes<br>
too great, and hence prolonged stable operation becomes difficult.<br>
Moreover, it becomes necessary to increase the temperature in the lower<br>
portion of the column, and hence side reactions become liable to occur.<br>
A more preferable range for L2 (cm) is 1500 
3500 being yet more preferable.<br>
If D2 (cm) is less than 50, then it is not possible to attain the<br>
desired distillation amount. Moreover, to keep down the equipment cost<br>
while attaining the desired distillation amount, D2 must be made to be not<br>
more than 500. A more preferable range for D2 (cm) is 70 
with 90 
If L2 / D2 is less than 10 or greater than 50, then prolonged stable<br>
operation becomes difficult. A more preferable range for L2 / D2 is 15 
L2 / D2 
If n2 is less than 20, then the separation efficiency for the<br>
enrichment section decreases and hence the desired separation<br>
efficiency cannot be attained. Moreover, to keep down the equipment<br>
cost while securing the desired separation efficiency, n2 must be made to<br>
be not more than 100. Furthermore, if n2 is greater than 100, then the<br>
pressure difference between the top and bottom of the column becomes<br>
too great, and hence prolonged stable operation becomes difficult.<br>
Moreover, it becomes necessary to increase the temperature in the lower<br>
portion of the column, and hence side reactions become liable to occur.<br><br>
A more preferable range for n2 is 30 
yet more preferable. Note that in the present invention, at least one<br>
chimney tray must be installed in the concentrating portion, and the<br>
number of stages therefor is included in n2 above. Moreover, for the<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column C of the present invention,<br>
preferably D2 
Furthermore, in the case that the high boiling point reaction<br>
mixture AB fed into the continuous multi-stage distillation column C<br>
contains a small amount of unreacted cyclic carbonate, it is preferable<br>
for it to be devised such that the unreacted cyclic carbonate is made to<br>
undergo reaction in a lower portion of the column, so that substantially<br>
no unreacted cyclic carbonate is contained in the column bottom<br>
component CB- Accordingly, in a preferable embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a plurality (n3 stages) of trays K are further provided in a lower<br>
portion of the internals in a lowermost portion of the stripping section<br>
which is in the lower portion of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column C, some liquid are continuously withdrawn from an uppermost<br>
stage of the trays K, and given heat required for distillation and reaction<br>
in a reboiler, and then the heated liquid is returned into the distillation<br>
column C from a feeding port provided between the uppermost stage of<br>
the trays K and the internals in a lowermost portion of the enrichment<br>
section, while a remainder of the liquid is fed into lower trays in order.<br>
By devising the continuous multi-stage distillation column C in this<br>
way, the residence time of liquid in the lower portion of the column can<br>
be increased. Moreover, by making a diameter D3 of the column at and<br>
below the stages where the trays K are present be greater than the<br><br>
diameter D1 of the enrichment section {D^ 
held can be increased and hence the residence time can be increased,<br>
and thus a sufficient reaction time can be maintained. Furthermore, by<br>
making the column bottom liquid level be lower than the lowermost one of<br>
the trays K, back mixing of the liquid in the lower portion of the column<br>
can be prevented. As a result of the above, in the present invention,<br>
even in the case that a small amount of unreacted cyclic carbonate is<br>
contained, the unreacted cyclic carbonate can be reacted with the diol,<br>
which is generally present in a large excess, and thus converted<br>
completely into a dialkylene glycol having a high boiling point or the like.<br>
The trays K may be any type of trays so long as these trays fulfill<br>
the role described above, but in terms of the relationship between<br>
performance and equipment cost, a sieve tray or a baffle trays is<br>
preferable, the baffle tray being particularly preferable. In the case of<br>
the sieve tray or the baffle tray, a weir is preferably provided, it<br>
preferably being made to be such that liquid overflowing the weir<br>
continuously falls down from a downcomer portion into lower stage trays.<br>
In this case, the weir height is preferably in a range of from 4 to 30 cm,<br>
more preferably from 6 to 20 cm, yet more preferably from 8 to 15 cm.<br>
In the case of the baffle tray, a simple tray in which the weir is the baffle<br>
is particularly preferable.<br>
A preferable range for D3 is 1.2Di 
1.5Di 
Moreover, n3 is not less than 2, a preferable range for n3 being 3 
n3 
The chimney tray installed in the enrichment section of the<br><br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column C has provided therein at least<br>
one chimneys each having an opening having a cross-sectional area S<br>
(cm2) in the plane of the tray. Moreover, a chimney cover is preferably<br>
installed on an upper opening of each of the chimneys. This chimney<br>
cover plays a role in a gaseous component that rises up from lower<br>
stages flowing sideways at the upper opening (gas outlet) of the chimney,<br>
and moreover plays a role in preventing a liquid component that falls<br>
down from upper stages from falling down directly into the lower stages.<br>
The cross-sectional shape of each of the chimneys may be any of<br>
triangular, square, polygonal, circular, elliptical, star-shaped or the like,<br>
but a square shape or a circular shape is preferably used. Moreover, for<br>
each of the chimneys, the cross-sectional shape and area may vary from<br>
an upper portion to a lower portion of the chimney, but is preferably<br>
constant since then manufacture is simple and inexpensive. Moreover,<br>
the at least two chimneys may have different shapes to one another, but<br>
preferably have the same shape as one another.<br>
In the present invention, the cross-sectional area S (cm2) of the<br>
opening (the part of the chimney having the smallest cross section) of<br>
each of the chimneys connected to the chimney tray must satisfy the<br>
formula (10):<br>
200<s></s>
If S is less than 200, then a large number of chimneys are<br>
required to attain a predetermined production amount, and hence the<br>
equipment cost becomes high. If S is greater than 1000, then the flow<br>
of gas in the chimney tray stage is prone to becoming ununiform, and<br>
hence prolonged stable operation becomes difficult. A more preferable<br><br>
range for S (cm2) is 300 
preferable.<br>
Moreover, the height h (cm) from the opening of each of the<br>
chimneys to the gas outlet (a lower end of the upper opening of the<br>
chimney) of that chimney must satisfy the formula (11):<br>
10<h></h>
The chimney tray used in the present invention generally has<br>
installed therein a downcomer portion for allowing the liquid component<br>
to fall down into lower stages, and a weir for holding the liquid<br>
component. The height of the weir depends on h, but is generally set to<br>
approximately 5 to 20 cm less than h. Consequently, if h is less than 10,<br>
then the amount of liquid held in the chimney tray becomes low, and<br>
hence prolonged stable operation becomes difficult. Moreover, if h is<br>
greater than 80, then the amount of liquid held increases, and hence the<br>
strength of the equipment must be increased, and thus the equipment<br>
cost becomes high, and moreover the residence time of the purified diol<br>
in the column increases, which is undesirable. A more preferable range<br>
for h (cm) is 15 
An aperture ratio (the ratio of the total cross-sectional area of the<br>
openings in the chimneys to the area of the chimney tray including the<br>
total cross-sectional area of the openings) of the chimney tray is<br>
preferably in a range of from 10 to 40%. If the aperture ratio is less<br>
than 10%, then prolonged stable operation becomes difficult. Moreover,<br>
if the aperture ratio is greater than 40%, then the number of chimneys<br>
must be increased, or each of the chimneys must be made higher, and in<br>
either case the equipment cost becomes high. A more preferable range<br><br>
for the aperture ratio is 13 to 35%, with 15 to 30% being yet more<br>
preferable.<br>
In the present invention, the at least one chimney tray is installed<br>
in the enrichment section (a portion above an inlet for feeding into the<br>
column but below the top of the column) of the multi-stage distillation<br>
column C, and a fraction having as a main component thereof<br>
intermediate boiling point material having a lower boiling point than that<br>
of the diol but a higher boiling point than that of the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol is continuously withdrawn from the side cut outlet which is<br>
connected to the bottom of the liquid collecting portion of the chimney<br>
tray. The number of chimney trays can be made to be two or more if<br>
required, but is generally one. The stage at which the chimney tray is<br>
installed may be at any position in the enrichment section, but is<br>
preferably a stage that is at least 3 stages from the bottom of the stages<br>
in the enrichment section and at least 10 stages from the top of the<br>
stages in the enrichment section, more preferably a stage that is at least<br>
4 stages from the bottom of the stages in the enrichment section and at<br>
least 15 stages from the top of the stages in the enrichment section, yet<br>
more preferably a stage that is at least 5 stages from the bottom of the<br>
stages in the enrichment section and at least 4 stages from the top of the<br>
stages in the enrichment section.<br>
The continuous multi-stage distillation column C of the present<br>
invention preferably comprises a distillation column having trays and/or<br>
packings as internals in each of the stripping section and the enrichment<br>
section. The term "internal" used in the present invention means a part<br>
in the distillation column where gas and liquid are actually brought into<br><br>
contact with one another. Examples of the tray include a bubble-cap<br>
tray, a sieve tray, a ripple tray, a ballast tray, a valve tray, a counterflow<br>
tray, an Unifrax tray, a Superfrac tray, a Maxfrac tray, a dual flow tray, a<br>
grid plate tray, a turbogrid plate tray, a Kittel tray, or the like. Examples<br>
of the packing include random packings such as a Raschig ring, a<br>
Lessing ring, a Pall ring, a Berl saddle, an Intalox saddle, a Dixon<br>
packing, a McMahon packing or Heli-Pak, or structured packings such as<br>
Mellapak, Gempak, Techno-pack, Flexipac, a Sulzer packings, a Goodroll<br>
packing or Glitschgrid. A multi-stage distillation column having both a<br>
tray portion and a portion packed with packings can also be used.<br>
Furthermore, the term "number of stages ni or n2 of the internal" used in<br>
the present invention means the number of trays in the case of trays, and<br>
the theoretical number of stages in the case of packings, ni or n2 in the<br>
case of a continuous multi-stage distillation column having both a tray<br>
portion and a portion packed with packings is thus the sum of the number<br>
of trays and the theoretical number of stages.<br>
In the present invention, the internals in the stripping section of<br>
the continuous multi-stage distillation column C and the internals<br>
excluding the chimney tray in the enrichment section are preferably trays<br>
and/or packings. Furthermore, it has been discovered that it is<br>
particularly preferable if the internals in the stripping section are trays,<br>
and the internals excluding the chimney tray in the enrichment section<br>
are trays and/or structured packings. Moreover, it has been discovered<br>
that sieve trays each having a sieve portion and a downcomer portion are<br>
particularly good as the trays in terms of the relationship between<br>
performance and equipment cost. It has also been discovered that each<br><br>
sieve tray preferably has 100 to 1000 holes / m2 in the sieve portion<br>
thereof. A more preferable number of holes is from 150 to 900 holes /<br>
m2, yet more preferably from 200 to 800 holes / m2. Moreover, it has<br>
been discovered that the cross-sectional area per hole of each sieve tray<br>
is preferably in a range of from 0.5 to 5 cm2. A more preferable<br>
cross-sectional area per hole is from 0.7 to 4 cm2, yet more preferably<br>
from 0.9 to 3 cm2. Furthermore, it has been discovered that it is<br>
particularly preferable if each sieve tray has 150 to 1200 holes / m2 in<br>
the sieve portion thereof, and the cross-sectional area per hole is in a<br>
range of from 0.5 to 5 cm2.<br>
An aperture ratio (the ratio of the total cross-sectional area of the<br>
holes in one tray stage to the area of the tray) of each of the sieve trays<br>
in the enrichment section of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column C is preferably in a range of from 2 to 15%, more preferably from<br>
2.5 to 12%, yet more preferably from 3 to 10%. Moreover, an aperture<br>
ratio (the ratio of the total cross-sectional area of the holes in one tray<br>
stage to the area of the tray) of each of the sieve trays in the enrichment<br>
section of the continuous multi-stage distillation column C is preferably in<br>
a range of from 1.5 to 12%, more preferably from 2 to 11%, yet more<br>
preferably from 2.5 to 10%. Note that in the present invention, the<br>
chimney tray installed in the enrichment section is counted in the number<br>
of stages, but as described above, the aperture ratio for the chimney tray<br>
is different to the aperture ratio for the sieve trays.<br>
It has been shown that by adding the above conditions to the<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column C, the object of the present<br>
invention can be attained more easily.<br><br>
In the present invention, the dialkyl carbonate produced through<br>
the reactive distillation in the continuous multi-stage distillation column A<br>
is continuously withdrawn from the upper portion of the column in a<br>
gaseous form as the low boiling point reaction mixture AT together with<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol that has remained unreacted due to<br>
generally being used in excess. Moreover, the high boiling point<br>
reaction mixture AB containing the produced diol is continuously<br>
withdrawn from the lower portion of the column in a liquid form. The<br>
high boiling point reaction mixture AB having the diol as a main<br>
component thereof generally contains 10 to 45 % by weight of residual<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol, a trace of the dialkyl carbonate, a very<br>
small amount (generally not more than 0.2 % by weight) of unreacted<br>
cyclic carbonate, a small amount (generally not more than 0.4 % by<br>
weight) of by-products having a lower boiling point than the diol (a<br>
2-alkoxyethanol etc.), and a small amount (generally not more than 0.4 %<br>
by weight) of by-products having a higher boiling point than the diol (e.g.<br>
a dialkylene glycol) including catalyst.<br>
Material having a lower boiling point than that of the diol (the<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol, a trace of the dialkyl carbonate and<br>
by-produced C02, low boiling point by-products) and a small amount of<br>
the diol in the high boiling point reaction mixture AB continuously fed into<br>
the continuous multi-stage distillation column C are thus continuously<br>
withdrawn as the column top component CT and / or the side cut<br>
component Cs, while the diol containing the catalyst and a small amount<br>
of high boiling point by-products is continuously withdrawn as the column<br>
bottom component CB. In the present invention, the concentration of the<br><br>
diol in the column bottom component CB is generally not less than 95 %<br>
by weight, preferably not less than 97 % by weight, more preferably not<br>
less than 98 % by weight.<br>
Moreover, in the process of the present invention, a very small<br>
amount (generally not more than 0.2 % by weight) of unreacted cyclic<br>
carbonate fed into the continuous multi-stage distillation column C can<br>
be reacted with the diol, which is present in a large amount in the<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column C, to produce a dialkylene<br>
glycol, and hence it is easy to make the amount of unreacted cyclic<br>
carbonate present substantially zero; in the present invention, the<br>
column bottom component CB generally having substantially no unreacted<br>
cyclic carbonate therein is continuously obtained.<br>
Note that, generally, with an objective of obtaining an ultra high<br>
purity diol having a further reduced content of an aldehyde which may be<br>
contained in the diol in trace amount, or an ultra high purity diol having a<br>
high UV transmissivity, it is also preferable to feed a small amount of<br>
water into the lower portion of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column C in accordance with the process described in Patent Document<br>

Document 10 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-131394).<br>
The distillation conditions for the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column C used in the present invention vary depending on the<br>
form of the internals in the distillation column and the number of stages,<br>
the type, composition and amount of the high boiling point reaction<br>
mixture AB fed in, the purity of the diol required, and so on. The column<br>
bottom temperature is generally preferably a specified temperature in a<br><br>
range of from 150 to 250 °C. A more preferable column bottom<br>
temperature range is from 170 to 230 °C, yet more preferably from 190 to<br>
210 °C. The column bottom pressure varies depending on the<br>
composition in the column and the column bottom temperature used, but<br>
is generally in a range of from 50000 to 300000 Pa, preferably from<br>
80000 to 250000 Pa, more preferably from 100000 to 200000 Pa.<br>
Moreover, the reflux ratio for the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column C is preferably in a range of from 0.3 to 5, more preferably from<br>
0.5 to 3, yet more preferably from 0.8 to 2.<br>
In the present invention, the content of the diol in the column top<br>
component CT from the continuous multi-stage distillation column C is<br>
generally not more than 100 ppm, preferably not more than 50 ppm, more<br>
preferably not more than 10 ppm, yet more preferably not more than 5<br>
ppm. In the present invention, it is even possible to make the content of<br>
the diol in the column top component CT be zero.<br>
The side cut component Cs from the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column C generally contains the aliphatic monohydric alcohol,<br>
by-products having a lower boiling point than that of the diol (a<br>
2-alkoxyethanol etc.), the diol, and a small amount of impurities having a<br>
higher boiling point than that of the diol (e.g. a dialkylene glycol). The<br>
amount of the side cut component Cs is generally not more than 4%,<br>
preferably not more than 3%, more preferably not more than 2%, of the<br>
high boiling point reaction mixture AB fed into the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column C.<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, the content of the diol in the<br>
side cut component Cs can generally easily be made to be not more than<br><br>
0.5%, preferably not more than 0.4%, more preferably not more than<br>
0.3%, of the diol fed into the continuous multi-stage distillation column C.<br>
As the column bottom component CB from the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column C, the diol can be continuously obtained<br>
containing generally not more than 2%, preferably not more than 1.5%,<br>
more preferably not more than 1%, of by-products having a higher boiling<br>
point than that of the diol (e.g. a dialkylene glycol) and a small amount of<br>
catalyst component. The diol obtained as the column bottom component<br>
CB is generally not less than 99.5%, preferably not less than 99.6%,<br>
more preferably not less than 99.7%, of the diol fed into the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column C. It is a characteristic feature of the<br>
present invention that the diol can be obtained with such a high recovery.<br>
Moreover, in a preferable embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the reaction is carried out using starting materials and a catalyst not<br>
containing a halogen, and hence the produced diol can be made to not<br>
contain a halogen at all. In the present invention, a diol having a<br>
halogen content of not more than 0.1 ppm, preferably not more than 1<br>
ppb, can thus be easily produced.<br>
In the present invention, the reaction yield and the purification<br>
yield are thus high, and hence the diol can be produced with a high yield<br>
of generally not less than 97%, preferably not less than 98%, more<br>
preferably not less than 99%, based on the cyclic carbonate used.<br>
The material constituting each of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation columns A and C which are used in the present invention is<br>
generally a metallic material such as carbon steel or stainless steel. In<br>
terms of the quality of the dialkyl carbonate and diol to be produced,<br><br>
stainless steel is preferable.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Following is a more detailed description of the present invention<br>
through examples. However, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
following examples. Note that the halogen content was measured using<br>
ion chromatography.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A continuous multi-stage distillation column C as shown in FIG. 1<br>
having L1 = 1100 cm, D1 = 110 cm, L1 / D1 = 10, m = 10, L2 = 3000 cm,<br>
D2 = 110 cm, L2 / D2 = 27.3, and n2 = 60 was used. The inside diameter<br>
(D3) was increased to 200 cm over approximately 500 cm from the bottom<br>
of the column, and in this portion there were installed 8 stages of baffle<br>
trays K having a downcomer portion and for which a weir (height 10 cm)<br>
was the baffle. It was devised such that some liquid was continuously<br>
withdrawn from a lower portion of the uppermost stage of the baffle trays<br>
K, the withdrawn liquid being heated by a reboiler, and then fed back into<br>
an upper portion of this stage. Moreover, in the enrichment section, an<br>
upper portion was packed with Mellapak with a theoretical number of<br>
stages of 52, one chimney tray stage was installed below the Mellapak,<br>
and 8 stages of trays were provided below the chimney tray. In this<br>
example, sieve trays were used as the internals in the stripping section,<br>
and sieve trays were used as the trays in the enrichment section. These<br>
sieve trays had a cross-sectional area per hole of approximately 1.3 cm2.<br>
In the stripping section, the number of holes in each of the sieve trays<br><br>
was approximately 250 to 300 / m2, and the aperture ratio was in a range<br>
of from 3 to 4%. Moreover, in the enrichment section, the number of<br>
holes in each of the sieve trays was approximately 150 to 300 / m2, and<br>
the aperture ratio was in a range of from 2.8 to 3.6%. The chimney tray<br>
had four chimneys therein, each of the chimneys having S =<br>
approximately 500 cm2 and h = 25 cm, and the aperture ratio being in a<br>
range of from 18 to 25%. The chimney tray had a downcomer portion,<br>
the weir height being 10 cm.<br>
A starting material containing ethylene carbonate (EC) and<br>
methanol (MeOH) (molar ratio MeOH / EC = 8.4) and a catalyst (KOH in<br>
ethylene glycol subjected to thermal dehydration treatment; K<br>
concentration 0.1 % by weight based on EC) was continuously fed into a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column A, and reactive distillation was<br>
carried out, whereby 3.205 ton / hr of a column bottom component AB<br>
was continuously withdrawn. The ethylene carbonate conversion was<br>
100%, and the ethylene glycol selectivity was 99.8%. The column<br>
bottom component AB, which contained 0.99 ton / hr of methanol, 0.001<br>
ton / hr of dimethyl carbonate, 0.009 ton / hr of 2-methoxyethanol, 2.186<br>
ton / hr of ethylene glycol, and 0.019 ton / hr of diethylene glycol and<br>
catalyst component, was continuously fed into a continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column C from an inlet. This inlet was installed between the<br>
trays in the 10th and 11th stages from the bottom of the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column C.<br>
The continuous multi-stage distillation column C was operated<br>
continuously with a column bottom temperature of approximately 200 °C,<br>
a column top pressure of approximately 11000 Pa, and a reflux ratio of<br><br>
0.9. Moreover, the column bottom liquid level was kept below the<br>
lowermost one of the trays K.<br>
It was possible to attain stable steady state operation after 24<br>
hours.<br>
A column top component CT containing 0.968 ton / hr of methanol,<br>
and 0.001 ton / hr of dimethyl carbonate, a side cut component Cs<br>
containing 0.022 ton / hr of methanol, 0.009 ton / hr of 2-methoxyethanol,<br>
and 0.004 ton / hr of ethylene glycol, and a column bottom component CB<br>
containing 2.182 ton / hr of ethylene glycol, and 0.019 ton / hr of<br>
diethylene glycol, catalyst component and high boiling point by-products<br>
were continuously withdrawn from the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column C.<br>
The content of ethylene glycol in the column top component CT<br>
was not more than 5 ppm, i.e. substantially zero. Moreover, the content<br>
of ethylene glycol in the side cut component Cs was 0.18% of the<br>
ethylene glycol fed into the continuous multi-stage distillation column C.<br>
The concentration of ethylene glycol in the column bottom<br>
component CB was 99.1 % by weight. Moreover, 99.82% of the ethylene<br>
glycol fed into the continuous multi-stage distillation column C was<br>
recovered as the column bottom component CB- The ethylene glycol<br>
yield based on the ethylene carbonate was 99.6%.<br>
Prolonged continuous operation was carried out under these<br>
conditions. After 500 hours, 2000 hours, 4000 hours, 5000 hours, and<br>
6000 hours, the produced amounts of ethylene glycol per hour were<br>
2.182 ton, 2.182 ton, 2.182 ton, 2.182 ton, and 2.182 ton, and hence<br>
operation was very stable.<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
A starting material containing ethylene carbonate (3.565 ton / hr)<br>
and methanol (molar ratio MeOH / EC = 8) and a catalyst (KOH in<br>
ethylene glycol subjected to thermal dehydration treatment; K<br>
concentration 0.1 % by weight based on EC) was continuously fed into a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column A, and reactive distillation was<br>
carried out, whereby dimethyl carbonate and ethylene glycol were<br>
produced with similar reaction results to in Example 1, a column bottom<br>
component AB having ethylene glycol as a main component thereof being<br>
continuously withdrawn. The ethylene glycol was separated out by<br>
distillation using the same continuous multi-stage distillation column C as<br>
in Example 1 and a similar process.<br>
It was possible to attain stable steady state operation after 24<br>
hours.<br>
The column bottom component CB, which was continuously<br>
withdrawn from the continuous multi-stage distillation column C at 2.472<br>
ton / hr, contained 2.439 ton / hr of ethylene glycol, and 0.033 ton / hr of<br>
diethylene glycol, catalyst component and high boiling point by-products.<br>
The concentration of ethylene glycol in the column bottom component CB<br>
was 99.1 % by weight. Moreover, 99.8% of the ethylene glycol fed into<br>
the continuous multi-stage distillation column C was recovered as the<br>
column bottom component CB. The ethylene glycol yield based on the<br>
ethylene carbonate was 99.5%.<br>
Prolonged continuous operation was carried out under these<br>
conditions. After 1000 hours, 2000 hours, 3000 hours, and 5000 hours,<br><br>
the produced amounts of ethylene glycol per hour were 2.439 ton, 2.439<br>
ton, 2.439 ton, and 2.439 ton, and hence operation was very stable.<br>
Example 3:<br>
A continuous multi-stage distillation column C very similar to that<br>
used in Example 1 was used. However, the number of holes in each of<br>
the sieve trays in the stripping section and the enrichment section was<br>
approximately 550 to 650 / m2, and the aperture ratio was in a range of<br>
from 6.5 to 8.5%.<br>
A starting material containing ethylene carbonate (8.20 ton / hr)<br>
and methanol (molar ratio MeOH / EC = 9) and a catalyst (KOH in<br>
ethylene glycol subjected to thermal dehydration treatment; K<br>
concentration 0.1 % by weight based on EC) was continuously fed into a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column A, and reactive distillation was<br>
carried out, whereby dimethyl carbonate and ethylene glycol were<br>
produced with similar reaction results to in Example 1, a column bottom<br>
component AB having ethylene glycol as a main component thereof being<br>
continuously withdrawn. The ethylene glycol was separated out by<br>
distillation using the continuous multi-stage distillation column C and a<br>
similar process to Example 1.<br>
It was possible to attain stable steady state operation after 24<br>
hours.<br>
The column bottom component CB, which was continuously<br>
withdrawn from the continuous multi-stage distillation column C at 5.852<br>
ton / hr, contained 5.754 ton / hr of ethylene glycol, and 0.098 ton / hr of<br>
diethylene glycol, catalyst component and high boiling point by-products.<br><br>
The concentration of ethylene glycol in the column bottom component CB<br>
was 98.3 % by weight. Moreover, 99.8% of the ethylene glycol fed into<br>
the continuous multi-stage distillation column C was recovered as the<br>
column bottom component CB. The ethylene glycol yield based on the<br>
ethylene carbonate was 99.6%.<br>
Prolonged continuous operation was carried out under these<br>
conditions. After 500 hours, 1000 hours, and 1500 hours, the produced<br>
amounts of ethylene glycol per hour were 5.754 ton, 5.754 ton, and 5.754<br>
ton, and hence operation was very stable.<br>

monohydric alcohol from an upper portion of the column A in a gaseous<br>
form, continuously withdrawing a high boiling point reaction mixture AB<br>
containing a produced diol from a lower portion of the column A in a<br>
liquid form, continuously feeding the high boiling point reaction mixture<br>
AB into a continuous multi-stage distillation column C, distilling off<br>
material having a lower boiling point than that of the diol contained in the<br>
high boiling point reaction mixture AB as a column top component CT and<br>
a side cut component Cs so as to obtain a column bottom component CB,<br>
continuously feeding the column bottom component CB into a continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column C, and obtaining the diol as a side cut<br>
component Es from a side cut outlet of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column C. Moreover, it is an object to thus provide a specific<br>
industrial apparatus and industrial production process that are<br>
inexpensive and, for example, enable the diol to be produced in an<br>
amount of not less than 1 ton / hr, preferably not less than 2 tons / hr,<br>
more preferably not less than 3 tons / hr, stably for a prolonged period of<br>
time (e.g. not less than 1000 hours, preferably not less than 3000 hours,<br><br>
more preferably not less than 5000 hours). According to the present<br>
invention, the above objects can be attained by using a continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column C having a specified structure, and<br>
withdrawing a liquid component from the side cut outlet, which is<br>
installed at the bottom of a chimney tray having a specified structure<br>
installed in an enrichment section of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column C.</td>
