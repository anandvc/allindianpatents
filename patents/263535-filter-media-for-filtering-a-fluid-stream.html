				<td>MULTIPLE LAYER FILTER MEDIA<br>
Background<br>
The removal of particulates from a gas stream has long been a practice in a variety of<br>
industrial fields. Conventional means for filtering particulates and the like from gas streams<br>
include, but are not limited to, filter bags, Filter tubes, filter panels and filter cartridges. For<br>
convenience herein, the term "filter element" will be used to refer collectively to these types of<br>
filtration means.<br>
Selection of the type of filtration media used is typically based on the fluid stream with<br>
which the filter element comes in contact, the operating conditions of the system and the type of<br>
particulates being filtered.<br>
The flow of fluids, whether liquid or gas, produces a pressure differential, or pressure<br>
drop, across the element Preferably, the pressure differential is as small as possible for a given<br>
fluid flow rate in order to minimize the power required to filter the fluid.<br>
Filter media may be broadly characterized as either depth filtration media or surface<br>
filtration media. Particles tend to penetrate somewhat and accumulate within depth filtration<br>
media. In contrast, the majority of particles collect on the surface of surface filtration media.<br>
Many materials are known to be useful as depth filtration media, including spunbond or<br>
meltblown webs, felts and fabrics made from a variety of materials, including polyesters,<br>
polypropylenes, aramids, cellulose, glasses and fluoropolymers. Known meltblown filter media<br>
demonstrate high efficiency and low pressure drop. Meltblown filter media also have high dust<br>
capacity. However, meltblown filter media suffer from relatively low water entry pressures,<br>
which may make them unsuitable for outdoor use in some environments.<br>
Surface filters, such as membranes, have gained popularity in certain applications,<br>
particularly outdoor environments or those in which the fluid to be filtered contains liquid<br>
aerosols or harsh chemicals. In other applications, membrane filter media is useful because it<br>
has a more constant filtration efficiency than that of depth filtration media. Membranes have<br>
stable filtration efficiency because, unlike depth filtration media, a membrane filter's efficiency is<br>
not dependent upon the buildup of a cake of dust particles.<br>
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has demonstrated utility in many areas such as harsh<br>
chemical environments, which normally degrade many conventional metals and polymeric<br>
materials. A significant development in the area of particle filtration was achieved when<br>
expanded PTFE (ePTFE) membrane filtration media were incorporated as surface laminates on<br>
conventional filter elements. Examples of such filtration media are taught in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,878,930, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,207,812, which are directed to filter cartridges for removing<br>
particles of dust from a stream of moving gas or air. Membranes constructed of ePTFE are<br>
advantageously hydrophobic.<br>
In known filter systems where thermoplastic and ePTFE layers are bonded together to<br>
form filter elements, the bonded regions between separate layers may significantly restrict the<br>
fluid flow through the filter elements resulting in lower filter system performance. Such may be<br>
the case where conventional lamination techniques of bonding multiple layers by the application<br>
of heat and pressure across the entire surface of the filter element. In such filters, the<br>
uncontrolled intermingling of materials from the thermoplastic layer creates regions of restricted<br>
flow. Furthermore, the application of heat and pressure across the entire surface may cause stress<br>
and compression in large regions of the ePTFE layer, reducing filtration efficiency and lowering<br>
water entry pressure. In some outdoor environments, the loss of filtration efficiency and water<br>
entry pressure may lead to early failure of the filter element.<br>
Summary<br>
In view of the foregoing, an object of embodiments described herein is to provide<br>
improved multiple layer filter media. Embodiments described herein provide for multiple layer<br>
filter media with high efficiency and air permeability. Embodiments described herein may<br>
accommodate bonding of multiple layers in a single-step bonding process resulting in reduced<br>
manufacturing cycle times, parts costs and production costs while maintaining or improving<br>
filter performance.<br>
In one aspect, multiple layer filter media is provided. The multiple layer filter media may<br>

membranes. The two ePTFE membranes may have different attributes such as permeability and<br>
filtering capability. A permeable thermoplastic web may be disposed between the two ePTFE<br>
membranes. The permeable thermoplastic web may be comprised of polypropylene, polyester,<br>
nylon, polyethylene, polyurethane or a combination thereof. In such a variation, the permeable<br>
thermoplastic web may comprise the second thermoplastic material. In another variation of the<br>
current arrangement, the first material may comprise a cellulose paper having a binder comprised<br>
of the first thermoplastic.<br>
In still another arrangement, at least portions of the first material may be disposed in a<br>
permeable thermoplastic web. The permeable thermoplastic web may be comprised of<br>
polypropylene, polyester, nylon, polyethylene, polyurethane, or a combination thereof. In a<br>
variation of the current arrangement, the third material may provide support for the filter media<br>
similar to as described with respect to the previous arrangement.<br>
In another embodiment, the multiple layer filter media comprising three layers may also<br>
comprise a fourth layer. The fourth layer may be disposed such that the third layer is between<br>
the second and fourth, layers. The filter media may also comprise a fifth layer that may be<br>
disposed such that the fourth layer is between the third and fifth layers. The fourth layer may<br>
comprise a meltblown fibrous web. The fifth layer may comprise a spun bond thermoplastic<br>
fibrous web.<br>
In various embodiments, the first, second and third layers may be free from being bonded<br>
to each other in the first region of the multiple layer filter media. In this regard, in the first<br>
region, the layers may be adjacent to each other and held in place by virtue of their<br>
interconnection in the at least one second region. The melting point of the first and third<br>
materials may be lower than a melting point of the second filter material. Moreover, the melting<br>
point of the first and third materials may be lower than a temperature at which the second filter<br>
material is significantly degraded.<br>
In various embodiments, the ratio of the total area of the first region to the total area of all<br>
of the second regions may be at least 9 to 1. Moreover, in certain embodiments, the ratio of the<br>
total area of the first region to the total area of all of the second regions may be at least 32 to 1.<br>
In various arrangements, the continuous bond may have a minimum thickness that is less<br>
than 50 percent of a maximum thickness of the filter media in the first region. Furthermore, in<br>
certain arrangements the continuous bond may have a minimum thickness that is less than 25<br>
percent of a maximum thickness of the filter media in the first region.<br>
In various embodiments, the continuous bond of the at least one second region may<br>
include at least portions of the first material, at least portions of the second filter material, and at<br>
least portions of the third material that are directly bonded.<br>
In an arrangement, the filter media may have a specific quality factor of at least about 0.8<br>

than twice a minimum thickness of the filter media in the first region.<br>
The at least one second region may include a plurality of second regions. The plurality of<br>
second regions may be arranged in a pattern across the surface of the filter media. The pattern<br>
may be uniform. Each of the plurality of second regions may define a point bond. In various<br>
arrangements, the bonds may be ultrasonic bonds. Where the at least one second region is<br>
comprised of a plurality of point bonds, the ratio of the total area of the first region to the total<br>
area of all of the point bonds may be at least 9 to 1. In certain embodiments, the ratio may be at<br>
least 32 to 1.<br>
In another aspect, a method of making a filter media is provided. The method may<br>
include positioning first, second, and third layers and applying energy to at least one selected<br>
region of the lateral extent of the positioned layers. The positioning may include arranging the<br>
first, second, and third layers such that they are separately disposed in adjacent face-to-face<br>
relation across the lateral extent with the second layer disposed between the first and third layers.<br>
The first layer may comprise a first thermoplastic material, the second layer may comprise a<br>
second filter material, and the third layer may comprise a third thermoplastic material. The<br>
applying of energy may cause portions of the first thermoplastic material to be bonded with<br>
portions of the third thermoplastic material within the at least one selected region of the lateral<br>
extent thereby defining a continuous bond therebetween.<br>
In an embodiment of the current method, the applying step may include applying energy<br>
to a plurality of the selected regions. Each of the plurality of the selected regions may define a<br>
point bond. The ratio of the area of the filter media outside of the point bonds to the total area of<br>
all of the point bonds may be at least 9 to 1. In certain embodiments, the ratio may be at least 32<br>
to 1.<br>
In an embodiment, the applying step may include applying energy to heat the positioned<br>
first, second, and third layers to a temperature that is above a melting points of the first and third<br>

energy may include ultrasonic energy.<br>
The applying step may include flowing at least a portion of the first thermoplastic<br>
material though the second layer and into the third layer within the selected region of the lateral<br>
extent. In an embodiment, the first, second, and third layers may be free from bonding to each<br>
other outside of the selected region of the lateral extent after the applying step. Furthermore,<br>
after the applying step, the filter media may have an air permeability of at least 4 Frazier. In<br>
certain embodiments, the air permeability may be at least 10 Frazier. After the applying step, the<br>
filter media may have a water entry pressure of greater than 0.5 PSI. In certain embodiments, the<br>
water entry pressure may be greater than 1.5 PSI.<br>
The various features, arrangements and embodiments discussed above in relation to each<br>
aforementioned aspect may be utilized by any of the aforementioned aspects. Additional aspects<br>
and corresponding advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of<br>
the further description that follows.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Figure 1 is a cross sectional schematic diagram of an embodiment of a multiple layer<br>
filter media 100. The illustration of Figure 1 includes a first region 101 in which the multiple<br>
layers of the multiple layer filter media 100 are disposed adjacent to each other. The illustration<br>
also includes a second region 102 in which the multiple layers of the multiple layer filter media<br>
100 are bonded together. Each of these regions 101, 102 is described further below. The relative<br>
thicknesses of the layers illustrated in Figure 1 are for illustration purposes and are not<br>
necessarily drawn to scale.<br>
The multiple layer filter media 100 illustrated in Figure 1 includes two filtration layers: a<br>
depth filtration layer 103 and a membrane filtration layer 104. The direction of fluid flow<br>
through the multiple layer filter media 100 may be from a first side 106 to a second side 107 of<br>
the multiple layer filter media 100. As illustrated in Figure 1, the depth filtration layer 103 may<br>
be positioned upstream of the membrane filtration layer 104. The multiple layer filter media 100<br>
may further include a support layer 105. The support layer 105 may be positioned either<br>
upstream or downstream of the membrane filtration layer 104 relative to fluid flow through the<br>
multiple layer filter media 100. In the illustration of Figure 1, the support layer 105 is shown<br>
positioned downstream of the membrane filtration layer 104.<br>
Within the first region 101, the layers 103, 104,105 of the multiple layer filter media 100<br>
may be disposed adjacent to each other. Moreover, in the first region the layers may not be<br>
bonded to each other. For example, in the first region 101, layers 103, 104, 105 may be held<br>
adjacent to each other by virtue of their connection to the second region 102 where the layers<br>
103, 104, 105 may be bonded together. As such, the performance characteristics of the multiple<br>
layer filter media 100 may exceed those of known filter systems. For example, multiple layer<br>
filter media 100 with discrete bonded regions such as second region 102 may achieve double the<br>
fluid flow as compared to filter media using the same layers but utilizing known interconnection<br>
methods (e.g., bonding across the entire area of the various layers).<br>
The depth filtration layer 103 may function as a pre-filter layer. The depth filtration layer<br>
103 may be comprised of a material that includes thermoplastic. The depth filtration layer 103<br>
may comprise a meltblown polymeric web. Meltblown webs are produced by entraining melt<br>
spun fibers with convergent streams of heated air to produce extremely fine filaments.<br>
Meltblown processing forms continuous sub-denier fibers, with relatively small diameter fibers<br>
that are typically less than 10 microns.<br>
The meltblown polymeric web of the depth filtration layer 103 may be made from a<br>
variety of polymeric materials, including polypropylene, polyester, polyamide, polyvinyl<br>
chloride, polymethylmethacrylate, nylon, and polyethylene. Polypropylene is among the more<br>
preferred polymeric materials.<br>
Optionally, the depth filtration layer 103 may include at least one electret filter media<br>
layer comprising a highly efficient layer having an electrostatic charge. Electric charge can be<br>
imparted to meltblown fibrous webs to improve their filtration performance using a variety of<br>
known techniques. Optionally, the depth filtration layer 103 may include a scrim for the<br>
protection of the fine fibers of the depth filtration layer 103 from abrasion during processing.<br>
The scrim may, for example, be comprised of polypropylene, nylon and/or polyester.<br>
The membrane filtration layer 104 may be comprised of a microporous polymeric<br>
membrane. The microporous polymeric membrane may capture particles that pass through the<br>
depth filtration layer 103. Microporous polymeric membranes have demonstrated dependability<br>
and reliability in removing particles and organisms from fluid streams. Membranes may be<br>
characterized by their polymeric composition, air permeability, water intrusion pressure and<br>
filtration efficiencies. A preferred membrane filtration layer 104 has an average air permeability<br>
of at least 4 Frazier. A more preferred membrane filtration layer 104 has an average air<br>
permeability of at least 10 Frazier.<br>
A variety of microporous polymeric membranes can be used as the membrane filtration<br>
layer 104, depending on the requirements of the application. The membrane filtration layer 304<br>
may be constructed from one or more of the following exemplary materials: nitrocellulose,<br>
triacetyl cellulose, polyamide, polycarbonate, polyethylene, polypropylene, polysulfone,<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene fluoride, acrylate copolymer.<br>
The membrane filtration layer 104 is preferably constructed from a hydrophobic material<br>
that is capable of preventing the passage of liquid water. In addition, the membrane filtration<br>
layer 104 may remain intact through the bonding process and thereby retain its ability to prevent<br>
the passage of liquid water therethrough. Accordingly, the membrane filtration layer 104 in the<br>
multiple layer filter media 100 may be able to withstand applied differential pressure across the<br>
multiple layer filter media 100 without any liquid passing through it. A preferred multiple layer<br>
filter media 100 has a water entry pressure of greater than about 0.5 PSI. A more preferred<br>
multiple layer filter media 100 has a water entry pressure of greater than about 1.5 PSI.<br>
Preferably, the membrane filtration layer 104 comprises a microporous fluoropolymer,<br>
such as ePTFE, fluormated emylenepropylene (FEP), perfluoronalkoxy polymer (PFA),<br>
polypropylene (PU), polyethylene (PE) or ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (uhmwPE).<br>
Most preferably, the membrane filtration layer 104 comprises ePTFE. Suitable ePTFE<br>
membranes are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,814,405. The membranes described therein have<br>
good filtration efficiency, high air flow, and high burst strength. Methods of making suitable<br>
ePTFE membranes are fully described therein. However, ePTFE membranes constructed by<br>
other means can also be used. Suitable ePTFE membranes are available from W. L. Gore &amp;<br>
Associates, Inc. of Newark, Del. The membrane filtration layer 104 may optionally contain a<br>
filler material to improve certain properties of the filter.<br>
The support layer 105 may be provided to, inter alia, maintain the filtration layers in the<br>
proper orientation to fluid flow. Supporting material may be rigid enough to support the<br>
membrane filtration layer 104 and depth filtration layer 103, but soft and supple enough to avoid<br>
damaging the membrane filtration layer 104. The support layer 105 may comprise fibrous<br>
material. The fibrous material may include thermoplastic material. The support layer 105 may,<br>
for example, comprise spunbond thermoplastic fibers, hydroentangled thermoplastic fibers, wet<br>
laid thermoplastic fibers or any combination thereof. The fibers may, for example, comprise<br>
polyester, nylon, polypropylene, polyethylene, or any combination thereof. In a pleated<br>
orientation, the support layer 105 may provide airflow channels in the pleats while holding the<br>
pleats apart (e.g., preventing the pleats from collapsing). The support layer 105 may be<br>
positioned downstream (e.g., as shown in Figure 1) or upstream of the membrane filtration layer<br>
104.<br>
The support layer 105 may include a cellulose paper having a binding material such as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 7,138,057. The ratio of the weight of the cellulose paper to the<br>
weight of the binding material may, for example, be between 4 to 1 and 1.5 to 1. The binding<br>
material may be thermoplastic.<br>
As noted, the multiple layers of the multiple layer filter media 100 are bonded together in<br>
the second region 102. The multiple layer filter media 100 may include a plurality of second<br>
regions 102. Each of the plurality of second regions 102 may be a point bond. Each of the<br>
plurality of second regions 102 may be localized regions where the multiple layers of the<br>
multiple layer filter media 100 are bonded together. The plurality of second regions 102 may be<br>
situated throughout the multiple layer filter media 100 to hold the multiple layers of the multiple<br>
layer filter media 100 together during the life cycle of the multiple layer filter media 100. This<br>
life cycle may, for example, include manufacturing processes (e.g., pleating processes), shipping,<br>
installation, filtering, and cleaning. In an embodiment, the plurality of second regions 102 may<br>
each have a maximum cross dimension that is less than twice a minimum thickness of the<br>
multiple layer filter media 100 in the first region 101. This may be advantageous in that the any<br>
one of the plurality of second regions 102 that may be positioned in the bended area of a pleated<br>
multiple layer filter media 100 may be small enough that damaging stress is not introduced to the<br>
multiple layer filter media 100 in the area of the second region 102. For certain applications, the<br>
plurality of second regions 102 may each have a maximum cross dimension of less than 5<br>
millimeters.<br>
The exemplary second region 102 shown in cross-section in Figure 1 is generally round<br>
in shape as observed from a viewpoint perpendicular to the multiple layer filter media 100.<br>
Although other point bond shapes may be used, a circular point bond may be beneficial since it<br>
has no corners that could act as stress concentrators.<br>
Within the second region 102, material from one or more of the layers of the multiple<br>
layer filter media 100 may be colocated with material from one or more of the other layers of the<br>
multiple layer filter media 100. This may be achieved by causing material from one or more of<br>
the layers to flow into material from one or more of the other layers during the bonding process<br>
used to form the second region 102. The flowing of material from the layers during the bonding<br>
process may be controlled through, for example, material selection for the layers and control of<br>
the application of energy during the bonding process.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary embodiment wherein, in the second region 102, material<br>
from the depth filtration layer 103 has been caused to flow into the membrane filtration layer 104<br>
and the support layer 105. The bonding process to form such a configuration may have<br>
proceeded as follows. First, energy (e.g., ultrasonic, heat and/or pressure) is applied to the<br>
multiple layer filter media 100 in the area of the second region 102 to be created. This<br>
application of energy causes the depth filtration layer 103 to melt and become densified.<br>
Material from the melted depth filtration layer 103 also flows into both the membrane filtration<br>
layer 104 and the support layer 105. Also during the bonding process, material from the support<br>
layer 105 may melt and become densified and material from the support layer 105 may flow into<br>
other layers of the multiple layer filter media 100, such as the membrane filtration layer 104.<br>
After the removal of the energy source and the cooling of the second region 102, the material<br>
that had softened, melted and/or flowed may solidify. In this regard, the materials that have<br>
flowed together may have become fused together.<br>
Where the support layer 105 is comprised of a cellulose paper with a thermoplastic<br>
binder, portions of the thermoplastic binder may flow into the membrane filtration layer 104<br>
during the bonding process. Moreover, in an arrangement, the depth filtration layer 103 may<br>
include a cellulose paper with a thermoplastic binder.<br>
After formation, the second region 102 may include a relatively thin layer of densified<br>
material from the depth filtration layer 103 along the first side 106 of the multiple layer filter<br>
media 100. Adjacent to and interconnected with the layer of densified material from the depth<br>
filtration layer 103, may be the membrane filtration layer 104 with material from the depth<br>
filtration layer 103 occupying the porosity of the membrane filtration layer 104. Some material<br>
from the support layer 105 may also occupy a portion of the porosity of the membrane filtration<br>
layer 104. Disposed along the second side 107 and adjacent to the membrane filtration layer 104<br>
may be a densified support layer 105 intermixed with material from the depth filtration layer 103<br>
that was melted and flowed into the support layer 105 during the bonding process. Thus a<br>
continuous bond including material from the first layer directly bonded to the second layer and<br>
material from the first layer directly bonded to material from the third layer may be formed in<br>
second region 102. In this manner, after bonding, the second region 102 may be configured such<br>
that it contains an unbroken band of either a densified or intermixed material between the first<br>
side 106 and the second side 107 of the multiple layer filter media 100.<br>
The second region 102 of Figure 1, as described above, includes flowing of the depth<br>
filtration layer 103 into both the membrane filtration layer 104 and the support layer 105. In an<br>
alternate embodiment, the depth filtration layer 103 may, for example, only flow into the<br>
membrane filtration 104. In such an embodiment, a portion of the support layer 105 may flow<br>
into the membrane filtration layer 104 during the bonding process. In this regard, this alternate<br>
embodiment may include collocating material from the depth filtration layer 103 and material<br>
from the support layer 105 within the membrane filtration layer 104.<br>
It will be appreciated that by selecting materials for the various layers of the multiple<br>
layer filter media 100 with specific melting temperatures and flow characteristics, various<br>
configurations of intermixed layers may be achieved. For example, by selecting materials for the<br>
depth filtration layer 103 and the support layer 105 with lower melting temperatures than the<br>
membrane filtration layer 104, the configuration of Figure 1 may be achieved where the depth<br>
filtration layer 103 has flowed into the membrane filtration layer 104 and the support layer 105<br>
during the bonding process. In another example, by selecting a material for the support layer 105<br>
with a lower melting temperature than the depth filtration layer 103 or membrane filtration layer<br>
104, a configuration may be achieved where the support layer 105 material is flowed into the<br>
depth filtration layer 103 and membrane filtration layer 104 during the point bonding process.<br>
The bond strength of the second region 102 may exceed the shear strength of one or more<br>
of the layers surrounding the second region 102. For example, in arrangements where the depth<br>
filtration layer 103 is comprised of a meltblown web, the bond strength in the second region<br>
between the various layers may be greater than the shear strength of the meltblown web.<br>
Accordingly, when a force is applied to pull the layers apart, the meltblown web may tear outside<br>
of the second region 102 prior to any failure within the second region 102, thus leaving the<br>
second region 102 intact.<br>
The plurality of second regions 102 may be operable to restrict removal of one of the<br>
layers of the multiple layer filter media 100. For example, removal of one of the layers (e.g., the<br>
depth filtration layer 103 or the support layer 105) may damage the remaining layers of multiple<br>
layer filter media 100 in such a way that it is obvious to a user that the multiple layer filter media<br>
100 is no longer capable of functioning as intended.<br>
As noted, the second region 102 may become densified and the porosity of the membrane<br>
filtration layer 104 may become at least partially filled with material from the depth filtration<br>
layer 103. As a result, in the second region 102, the ability of the multiple layer filter media 100<br>
to allow fluid flow therethrough may be significantly reduced or eliminated. Accordingly, the<br>
overall bond strength between the various layers of the multiple layer filter media 100 may be<br>
balanced against the loss of fluid flow capability through the multiple layer filter media 100 due<br>
to the total area of the plurality of second regions 102. For example, as the total number and area<br>
of the second regions 102 is increased, the mechanical interconnection between the various<br>
layers is strengthened. However, at the same time the fluid flow capability of the multiple layer<br>
filter media 100 is reduced. Accordingly, it may be preferable to have the total area of the<br>
plurality of second regions 102 cover less than 10% of the total surface area of the multiple layer<br>
filter media 100 (e.g., the ratio of the area of the first region 101 to the total area of all of the<br>
second regions 102 may be greater than nine to one). More preferably, the total area of the<br>
plurality of second regions 102 may cover less than 3% of the total surface area of the multiple<br>
layer filter media 100 (e.g., the ratio of the area of the first region 101 to the total area of all of<br>
the second regions 102 may be greater than about thirty-two to one).<br>
The second region 102 illustrated in Figure 1 shows the materials of the multiple layer<br>
filter media 100 compressed toward the second side 107. Other configurations, such as the<br>
multiple layer filter media 100 compressed toward the first side 106 may also be utilized. The<br>
total amount of compression of the multiple layer filter media 100 within the second region 102<br>
may be such that the minimum thickness of the continuous bond formed in the second region 102<br>
is less than half of the maximum thickness of the multiple layer filter media 100 in the first<br>
region 101. In certain arrangements, the minimum thickness of the continuous bond in the<br>
second region 102 may be less than one quarter of the maximum thickness of the multiple layer<br>
filter media 100 in the first region 101.<br>
As noted, the stpplication of energy to the second region 102 may be used to melt and/or<br>
cause material from one or more of the layers of the multiple layer filter media 100 to flow into<br>
and be fused with material from one or more other layers of the multiple layer filter media 100.<br>
In this regard, to bond the layers of the multiple layer filter media 100 together, it may not be<br>
necessary to introduce additional materials, such as adhesives, in order to have the various layers<br>
bond together. Furthermore, the amount of energy applied to the second region 102 may be<br>
selected so that the structure of the membrane filtration layer 104 is not degraded during the<br>
energy application process. For example, the amount of energy applied to the second region 102<br>
may cause material. from the depth filtration layer 103 to flow into and bond within the<br>
membrane filtration layer 104, and also cause material from the depth filtration layer 103 to melt<br>
and flow into and bond within the support layer 105. In this regard, the membrane may retain its<br>
porous structure, which in the second region 102 may serve as a matrix for thermoplastic from<br>
the depth filtration layer 103 and/or the support layer 105. As may be appreciated, the<br>
application of energy applied to cause the above described flowing of materials may be<br>
continuously applied in a single process step resulting in the formation of a continuous bond.<br>
Ultrasonic bonding equipment may be used to apply the localized energy to create the<br>
second region 102. Using ultrasonic energy to create the second region 102 may have several<br>
beneficial characteristics. For example, ultrasonic bonding equipment may allow for precise<br>
control of the amount of energy delivered to each second region 102. In this regard, the energy<br>
delivered may be selected to melt only one or two of the layers of the multiple layer filter media<br>
100. The size and shape of the second region 102 may be determined by the size and shape of<br>
the anvil used in the ultrasonic bonding equipment along with the amount of power delivered<br>
during the bonding process.<br>
Another benefit of using ultrasound may be that all the layers may be bonded together in<br>
a single application of ultrasonic energy. For example the multiple layer filter media 100,<br>
arranged with the with the depth filtration layer 103 on one side of the membrane filtration layer<br>
104, and the support layer 105 on the other side of the membrane filtration layer 104, may be<br>
bonded together in a single-step application of ultrasonic energy. Additionally, multiple<br>
individual second regions 102 may be simultaneously created. Alternatively, a subset of layers<br>
of the multiple layer filter media 100 may be bonded together and then additional layers may be<br>
bonded to the subset of layers, thereby completing the bonding in two or more discrete bonding<br>
steps.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary ultrasonic bonding apparatus 200<br>
bonding multiple layers of materials. The ultrasonic bonding apparatus 200 may include an<br>
ultrasound horn 201 and an anvil 202. The design and operation of ultrasonic bonding<br>
equipment such as the ultrasonic bonding apparatus 200 are known.<br>
To bond multiple layers of the multiple layer filter media 100, individual sheets of<br>
materials may simultaneously be fed into the ultrasonic bonding apparatus 200. For example, a<br>
roll 203 of depth filtration layer 103 material, a roll 204 of membrane filtration layer 104<br>
material, and a roll 205 of support layer 105 material may be simultaneously be fed between the<br>
horn 201 and anvil 202 where the three layers will be bonded together in a single step application<br>
of ultrasonic energy.<br>
The horn 201 and anvil 202 may be configured to produce any appropriately configured<br>
second region 102 or plurality of second regions 102. For example, a plurality of second regions<br>
102 may be produced in. a diamond pattern 206 by placing a corresponding pattern on the anvil<br>
202.<br>
Other methods of creating point bonds may be utilized. For example, heated elements<br>
may be used to transfer heat to the multiple layer filter media 100 in the area of the second<br>
regions 102 to be created. Generally, this may require direct contact between the heated element<br>
and the multiple layer filter media 100. Other methods of transferring energy to specific points<br>
(e.g., infrared) may also be used to create the second regions 102.<br>
The thicknesses of the various layers of the multiple layer filter media 100 may be varied<br>
to achieve various performance characteristics of the multiple layer filter media 100. The<br>
permeability of each of the layers may also be varied to achieve various performance<br>
characteristics.<br>
Additional configurations of multiple layer filter media may also be created using the<br>
principles and methods described herein. For example, an additional membrane filtration layer<br>
may be added to the embodiment illustrated in Figure 3 between the existing membrane filtration<br>
layer 104 and the support layer 105. The presence of two membrane filtration layers may be<br>
advantageous in that, for example, the first membrane filtration layer may have a first particle<br>
efficiency and the second membrane filtration layer may have a second particle efficiency. In<br>
such a configuration, the first membrane filtration layer may act as a pre-filter for the second<br>
membrane filtration layer, thereby improving overall multiple layer filter media performance. A<br>
permeable thermoplastic web layer may be placed between the two membrane filtration layers.<br>
The permeable thermoplastic web layer may have a permeability that does not significantly<br>
affect the overall filtration performance of the multiple layer filter media in the first region. In<br>
the second region, the permeable thermoplastic web layer may melt and flow into both of the two<br>
membrane filtration layers, thereby bonding the layers together. In this regard, material from the<br>
permeable thermoplastic web layer may be directly bonded to material from the depth filtration<br>
layer 103 and/or the support layer 105. The permeable thermoplastic web layer may, for<br>
example, be comprised of polyester, nylon, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyurethane, or a<br>
combination thereof. The permeable thermoplastic web layer may comprise a meltblown web.<br>
Other arrangements may include additional layers. For example, an arrangement may<br>
include a fourth layer that includes a meltblown fibrous web and a fifth layer that includes a<br>
spunbond thermoplastic fibrous web. The layers in such an arrangement may be ordered such<br>
that the third layer is between the second and fourth layers and the fourth layer is between the<br>
third and fifth layers. The meltblown fibrous web of the fourth layer may provide additional<br>
filtering capability and the spunbond thermoplastic fibrous web of the fifth layer may provide<br>
additional support.<br>
The air permeability values noted herein may be determined according to a Frazier<br>
number test method. In this method, air permeability is measured by clamping a test sample in a<br>
gasketed-flanged fixture, which provides a circular section of approximately 2.75 inches in<br>
diameter and 6 square inches in area, for air flow measurement. The upstream side of the sample<br>
fixture is connected to a flow meter in line with a source of dry compressed air. The downstream<br>
side of the sample fixture is open to the atmosphere. Testing is accomplished by applying an air<br>
pressure of 0.5 inches of water to the upstream side of the sample and recording the flow rate of<br>
the air passing through the in-line flowmeter (a ball-float rotameter). Results are reported in<br>
terms of Frazier number, which has units of cubic feet/minute/square foot of sample at 0.5 inches<br>
of water pressure.<br>
Figure 3 is an isometric view of an exemplary filter assembly 300. The filter assembly<br>
300 comprises a bonded and pleated multiple layer filter media 301. The bonded and pleated<br>
multiple layer filter media 301 may be surrounded along its edges by a filter peripheral member<br>
302. A gasket 303 may be interconnected to the filter peripheral member 302. The bonded and<br>
pleated multiple layer filter media 301 may be comprised of multiple layer filter media such as<br>
described herein. The bonded and pleated multiple layer filter media 301 includes a plurality of<br>
second regions 102 in the diamond pattern 206 of Figure 2. As noted above, each of the plurality<br>
of second regions may have a maximum cross dimension small enough that the locations of the<br>
plurality of second regions may not need to be accounted for when forming the pleats.<br>
Alternatively, the plurality of second regions may be dispersed in a pattern that leaves bond free<br>
areas where pleats may be placed. In this manner, the pleat tips could be free of the plurality of<br>
second regions.<br>
By sealing the bonded and pleated multiple layer filter media 301 to the Filter peripheral<br>
member 302, the flow of fluid may be restricted to passing through the bonded and pleated<br>
multiple layer filter media 301. In this regard, the filtering performance of the filter assembly<br>
300 may correspond to the filtering performance of the bonded and pleated multiple layer filter<br>
media 301. Accordingly, a preferred filter assembly 300 may have a water entry pressure of at<br>
least about 0.5 PSI. More preferably, a preferred filter assembly 300 may have a water entry<br>
pressure of at least about 1.5 PSI.<br>
Moreover, the filter assembly 300 may have a specific quality of at least about 0.8<br>
1/krayls at 0.1 µm DOP particle at 2.5 cm/s air velocity. The specific quality is a useful metric to<br>
compare the filtration performance of filter media. It is the ratio of the penetration to the airflow<br>
resistance and the value is expressed in 1/kilorayls. The higher the ratio, the higher the particle<br>
collection efficiency relative to its airflow resistance. The airflow resistance is the ratio of the<br>
pressure drop across the filter to the face velocity. The specific quality is defined as:<br>
Specific quality = -log(penetration)/(filter pressure drop / face velocity) x 1/1000<br>
where penetration is the particle penetration of the filter, filter pressure drop is in Pa, and face<br>
velocity is in m/s. Specific quality is dependent on the particle size and face velocity.<br>
Penetration is measured by an automated efficiency tester (e.g., Model 8160, from TSI<br>
Inc., Shoreview, Minnesota). The test is performed at ambient room temperature (70° F) and<br>
relative humidity conditions (40%). A DOP solution is atomized to generate an aerosol<br>
containing particles from 0.03 to 0.3 microns in diameter. The filter sample is challenged with<br>
the aerosol at air flow velocity of between 1 and 5.3 cm/s. Two condensation nucleus particle<br>
counters measure the particle concentrations upstream and downstream of the test sample<br>
simultaneously. The penetration is reported as the percentage of upstream challenge particles<br>
collected by the filter.<br>
Additionally, a preferred filter media 301 of assembly 300 may have a dust loading<br>
capacity greater than about 10 g/m . Dust loading capacity may be determined according to the<br>
following method. A 5% aqueous sodium chloride solution is atomized using a constant output<br>
atomizer (Model 3096, from TSI Inc.). The particles are dried by heating to 80C and then<br>
diluted with clean, dry air. The filter test sample, 44.4 mm in diameter, is weighed prior to<br>
testing and is placed inside a filter holder. The face velocity is set to 53 mm/s. The pressure<br>
drop across the filter is monitored continuously by a pressure transducer. The filter is loaded<br>
with the sodium chloride aerosol until the final pressure drop across the filter media reaches 750<br>
Pa. The test sample is weighed again after the test to determine the mass loading. The dust<br>
loading capacity is defines as:<br>
Dust Loading Capacity = (Final Weight - Initial Weight) / Filter Area<br>
where the weights are in grams and the filter area is in square meters. Accordingly, dust loading<br>
capacity is expressed in g/m2.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an embodiment of a filter assembly 300 where the filter assembly is<br>
generally rectangular and the filter media 301 is pleated. The multiple layer filter media<br>
described herein may be incorporated into other configurations and products. For example, the<br>
multiple layer filter media described herein may be used in circular or cylindrical filters. For<br>
example, the multiple layer filter media described herein may be used in non-pleated<br>
configurations.<br>
Figure 4 is a flowchart of a method of making a filter media. The first step 401 in the<br>
method may be to position first, second and third layers. The positioning may include disposing<br>
the second layer between the first and third layers such that the first and second layers are in an<br>
adjacent face-to-face relationship and the second and third layers are in an adjacent face-to-face<br>
relationship across a lateral extent. This step may be accomplished by unrolling the first, second<br>
and third layers from rolls. The first layer may comprise a first thermoplastic material, the<br>
second layer may comprise a second filter material, and the third layer may comprise a third<br>
thermoplastic material.<br>
The next step 402 may be to apply energy to at least one selected region of the lateral<br>
extent. The applying of energy may cause portions of the first thermoplastic material to be<br>
bonded with portions of the third thermoplastic material within the at least one selected region<br>
thereby defining a continuous bond therebetween.<br>
The at least one selected region may include a plurality of selected regions that may be<br>
spaced across the lateral extent. Each of these selected regions may define a point bond. Within<br>
the at least one selected region, the applying of energy may cause at least a portion of the first<br>
material to flow through the second layer and into the third layer.<br>
The applying of energy may cause the layers to be heated in the selected at least one<br>
region to a temperature that is above a melting point of the first and third layers, and below a<br>
melting point of the second layer. The applying of energy may include applying ultrasonic<br>
energy to the layers. After the applying energy step is complete, the first, second, and third<br>
layers may be free from bonding with each other outside of the at least one selected region.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Three layers of material were simultaneously bonded together using ultrasonic bonding.<br>
The first layer, a meltblown media consisting of 30 grams per square meter (g/m2)<br>
polypropylene fine fibers with a 15 g/m2 polypropylene scrim was ultrasonically bonded<br>
together with a second material, an ePTFE membrane, and a third material, a spunbond polyester<br>
substrate with basis weight of 150 g/m2. The scrim for the meltblown was for the protection of<br>
the fine fibers from abrasion during processing. The fiber size of the meltblown was 1 to 5 µm.<br>
The fiber size of the ePTFE membrane was 0.1 to 0.3 µm and its basis weight was 5.0 g/m2. The<br>
fiber size of the spunbond polyester was 30 to 50 µm.<br>
The resulting filter media had a basis weight of 200 g/m2. The filter media had an air<br>
permeability of 10.7 Frazier and a water entry pressure of 3 PSI. The filtration efficiency of the<br>
filter media was 99.785% at 0.1 µm DOP (Dioctyl Phthalate) @ 2.5cm/s flow. The specific<br>
quality was 1.21/krayls. The dust loading capacity was 16.8 g/m2.<br>
The filter media was bonded using a patterned anvil roll that produced a plurality of point<br>
bonds across the filter media in a diamond pattern. The individual rolls of material were<br>
unwound from individual stands and the webs were brought together to form a multilayer web<br>
prior to bonding. The composite web passed through a processing point that comprised on the<br>
top side an ultrasonic horn providing ultrasonic energy in the form of high frequency movement<br>
(20000 Hz) and pressure against the material and a rotating cylindrical anvil positioned below<br>
the web with a pattern of points protruding up from the anvil surface.<br>
The round individual point bonds had a diameter of 1.6 mm and a density of<br>
approximately 524 point bonds per square foot. The total area of the point bonds was less than<br>
two percent of the total surface area of the bonded filter media. Due to the raised bond points on<br>
the anvil, the material was exposed to compression at the bond points and much less pressure<br>
between the points. The bonding of the three layers was completed in one pass through the<br>
machine.<br>
Additional modifications and extensions to the embodiments described herein will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art. Such modifications and extensions are intended to be within<br>
