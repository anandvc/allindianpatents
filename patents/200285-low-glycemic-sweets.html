				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
This invention relates to sweets, particularly the Indian sweets of low glycemic index, especially for consumers with diabetics or with diabetic tendencies, maintaining the same organoleptic, textural and visual properties of sweets conventionally produced using cane sugar.<br>
In conventional preparation of sweets, sugar derived out of sugar cane is used. For the preparation of sweets especially in the Asian subcontinent including India such as Rasagulla, Rasamalai, Gulab Jamun, Badam / Pista / Cashew Kadli, Doodh Peda, Kesar Peda, Chocolate Milk Burfi Peda, Jangri, Basundi, Laddoo, Mysore Pak, Sandesh etc., either the crystalline sugar is added during the heating process, or the precooked food is soaked in sugar syrup for a sufficient period till the desired sweetness is achieved. The diabetic patients or people with diabetic symptoms are generally advised not to consume sweets since normal sugar (sucrose) used in sweets will increase their blood sugar. Hence diabetic patients avoid consuming the sweets made of the conventional sugar by killing the desire of having the sweets. However, attempts have been made in the past to produce sweets with artificial sweeteners such as Aspartame etc., but have not been widely accepted as they result in products with bitter taste. Further, it has not been possible to prepare artificial sweetener based syrups with desirable consistency and viscosity as they decompose when cooked at elevated temperatures resulting in loss of their characteristics. As other alternative, the artificial sweetener is added to the end unsweetened food product just before serving. However this practice has not been a great success as it was reported that the same organoleptic properties of conventional sweets are not maintained.<br>
Hence the other possibilities of using natural sugar substitutes were explored. The prior art teaches using sorbitol as a cane sugar substitute. In the production of one of the hardboiled sweets based on freshly prepared cottage cheese (paneer in India), for example rasgulla, the sorbitol syrup has been used. However, the draw back with Sorbitol is that the sweetness index of sorbitol is significantly lower than that of cane sugar and is therefore less satiating than sugar. Moreover sorbitol has fairly high laxative property and hence is not suitable for general consumption.<br><br>
The other natural sugar substitute that was found is LEVULOSE also known as Fruit Sugar a Low Glycemix Index product (GI23-compare Glucose 100). However, the experiments of making sweets using levulose faced a peculiar problem of undesirable browning due to maillard reaction and caramelization of levulose when heated to elevated temperatures particularly due to reaction between carbohydrate and protein.<br>
Use of other sugar based alcohols in the production of confectionery products have also not been successful as they have been rejected by consumers due to their laxative properties and low level of sweetness. Literature has examples in which certain chocolates, ice creams and biscuits have been prepared from a set of nutritive / non-nutritive sweeteners. However, such confectioneries do not use syrups cooked at elevated temperatures as in the case of the Asian or Indian sweetmeats.<br>
Therefore there is a longstanding need to produce traditional Indian/Asian sweets with low Glycemic Index suitable for all consumers and especially for consumers with diabetics or with diabetic tendencies, maintaining the same organoleptic, textural and visual properties of sweets conventionally produced from cane sugar.<br>
Therefore the first object of the invention is related to sweets prepared by using levulose a natural sugar substitute of low Glycemic Index, by overcoming the above mentioned inherent drawback of levulose namely browning at elevated temperature.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention wherein the sweets prepared does not require the sweet syrup for obtaining sweetness, the levulose preferably in powder form is added at the end of preparation of such sweets rather than during the heating process, as is conventionally the method of preparation adopted while using cane sugar. This is in order to prevent the browning of levulose.<br>
The next object of the invention is to provide Indian sweet variety with low Glycemic Index (GI) suitable for all consumers and especially for consumers with diabetics or with diabetic tendencies, maintaining the same organoleptic properties, textural and visual properties of sweets conventionally prepared or produced using cane sugar.<br><br>
The next object of the invention is related to Indian sweet variety, which apart from being prepared or produced by using a natural sugar substitute, namely Levulose optionally containing other nutritive and or non-nutritive sweeteners, without the problem of browning during or after the processing at elevated temperatures.<br>
The next object of the invention is related to syrup (s) of Levulose of variable viscosity and high consistency, without browning and stable without decomposing when exposed to elevated temperatures for prolonged period, at the same time maintaining the organoleptic and visual characteristics of sucrose based syrups making such Levulose based syrups them suitable for the preparation of sweetmeats of low Glycemic Index.<br>
In the above description it is to be understood that the word, "SWEET', is used in its broadest sense which also includes confectionery, milk / cereal / lentil / nut based sweets or sweetmeats and their like. It is also to be construed that the description given here however does not limit the scope of the invention and includes the sweet products and processes used to prepare them by a person skilled in the art.<br>
It is to be understood that the phrases like, "Glycemic Index", "elevated temperatures", "browning" etc., have the same meanings, as a skilled person of the field knows them. Hence these terms are not defined in the description.<br>

b)	After gentle addition of the powder the pedas are made to desired shape.<br>
c)	Care is to be taken that powder should not be added to Khova during heating stage. This is the difference while comparing with the conventional preparation of pedas wherein the cane sugar is added during heating the Khova.<br>
d)	During the preparation of kesar peda the only notable difference is addition of approximately lOg of Kesar to half kilo Khova having 150g of powdered Levulose.<br>
e)	For the preparation of chocolate milk burfi peda 15 to 20g of cocoa powder is added instead of kesar.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 6 PREPARATION OF JANGIRI<br>

EXAMPLE 9 PREPARATION OF MYSORE PAK<br>
In the traditional method, Water is boiled along with sugar to prepare syrup. To this, gram flour and fat are added and kindled at high temperature till required consistency is obtained.<br>
But this method is not suitable for the manufacture of sweets using levulose as exposure to extended period of heating will reduce render Levulose brown.<br>
Thus the method adopted is as follows.<br>
a)	Gram flour is taken and stirred continuously by adding ghee until cooked.<br>
b)	Powdered, crystalline or levulose syrup is added to this mixture towards the end of the heating process preferably under inert gas blanket, to obtain Mysore Pak of required consistency.<br>

EXAMPLE 10 PREPARATION OF HAL WAS<br>
Though the method of manufacturing the halwas is common,<br>
a.	the ingredients used in the halwas and<br>
b.	the process of processing and obtaining the,<br>
ingredients might vary from Halwa to Halwa. The ingredients mentioned above may vary from Badam for Badam Halwa, ground wheat extract for wheat halwa, or addition of fruit and/ or nuts etc. as the halwa might require.<br>
a)	In the conventional method, the principle ingredient is added to the required fat and sugar, either in crystalline, powder or syrup form, and heated together right from the beginning until the required consistency is obtained.<br>
b)	But this method is not suitable for the manufacture of sweets using levulose as exposure to extended period of heating will reduce the sugar rendering it brown.<br>
c)	Therefore, in this process, the main and ingredient of the halwa is cooked with fat.<br>
d)	Depending upon the halwa, powdered, crystalline or syrup levulose is added either towards the end of the heating process, preferably under inert gas blanket in low flame, or after the heating process is completed to obtain halwa of the required consistency.<br><br><br>
