METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PREDICTING CHANGE IN AN OPERATING STATE<br>
OF AN ELECTRIC ENERGY STORAGE DEVICE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to an electrical energy storage<br>
device. More particularly, the invention is concerned with predicting effects<br>
upon an electrical energy storage device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Various hybrid propulsion systems for vehicles use electrical energy<br>
storage devices to supply electrical energy to electrical machines, which are<br>
operable to provide motive torque to the vehicle, often in conjunction with an<br>
internal combustion engine. An exemplary hybrid powertrain architecture<br>
comprises a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission<br>
which utilizes an input member for receiving power from a prime mover<br>
power source and an output member for delivering power from the<br>
transmission to a vehicle driveline. First and second electric machines, i.e.<br>
motor/generators, are operatively connected to an energy storage device for<br>
interchanging electrical power therebetween. A control unit is provided for<br>
regulating the electrical power interchange between the energy storage device<br>
and the electric machines. The control unit also regulates electrical power<br>
interchange between the first and second electric machines.<br>
[0003] One of the design considerations in vehicle powertrain systems is an<br>
ability to provide consistent vehicle performance and component/system<br>
service life. Hybrid vehicles, and more specifically the battery pack systems<br>
utilized therewith, provide vehicle system designers with new challenges and<br>
tradeoffs. It has been observed that service life of an electrical energy storage<br>
device, e.g. a battery pack system, increases as resting temperature of the<br>
battery pack decreases. However, cold operating temperature introduces<br>
limits in battery charge/discharge performance until temperature of the pack is<br><br><br>
increased. A warm battery pack is more able to supply required power to the<br>
vehicle propulsion system, but continued warm temperature operation may<br>
result in diminished service life.<br>
[0004] Modern hybrid vehicle systems manage various aspects of operation<br>
of the hybrid system to effect improved service life of the battery. For<br>
example, depth of battery discharge is managed, amp-hour (A-h) throughput is<br>
limited, and convection fans are used to cool the battery pack. Ambient<br>
environmental conditions in which the vehicle is operated has largely been<br>
ignored. However, the ambient environmental conditions may have<br>
significant effect upon battery service life. Specifically, same models of<br>
hybrid vehicles released into various geographic areas throughout North<br>
America would likely not result in the same battery pack life, even if all the<br>
vehicles were driven on the same cycle. The vehicle's environment must be<br>
considered if a useful estimation of battery life is to be derived. Additionally,<br>
customer expectations, competition and government regulations impose<br>
standards of performance, including for service life of battery packs, which<br>
must be met.<br>
[0005] It would be useful to include in a hybrid control system an ability to<br>
estimate or otherwise determine a potential effect that an operating parameter,<br>
e.g. electrical current level, has on life of a battery pack, in order to use such<br>
information to proactively control operation of the hybrid powertrain system<br>
to optimize battery life.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] A method for predicting change in an operating state for an electrical<br>
energy storage device includes establishing a plurality of values for an<br>
operating parameter of the electrical energy storage device and, for each<br>
respective value, determining a corresponding change in the operating state for<br>
the energy storage device based upon the respective value.<br><br><br>
[0007] In accordance with one embodiment, the operating state of the<br>
electrical energy storage device is its state of life. Further, the operating<br>
parameter of the electrical energy storage device is electrical current.<br>
Preferably, change in the state of life is determined based upon an integration<br>
of electrical current, a depth of discharge of the energy storage device, and, an<br>
operating temperature factor of the electrical energy storage device. Depth of<br>
discharge of the electrical energy storage device is preferably determined<br>
based upon the electrical current. And, the operating temperature factor of the<br>
electrical energy storage device is determined based upon the electrical current<br>
and temperature of the electrical energy storage device.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0008] The invention may take physical form in certain parts and<br>
arrangement of parts, an embodiment of which is described in detail herein<br>
and illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and<br>
wherein:<br>
[0009] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a<br>
control system and powertrain, in accordance with the present invention;<br>
[0010] Figs. 2 and 3 are algorithmic block diagrams, in accordance with the<br>
present invention; and,<br>
[0011] Fig. 4 is an exemplary data graph, in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0012] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Fig. 1 shows a control system and an exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
system which has been constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
invention. The exemplary hybrid powertrain system comprises a plurality of<br>
torque-generative devices operable to supply motive torque to a transmission<br>
device, which supplies motive torque to a driveline. The torque-generative<br>
devices preferably comprise an internal combustion engine 14 and first and<br><br><br>
second electric machines 56, 72 operable to convert electrical energy supplied<br>
from an electrical storage device 74 to motive torque. The exemplary<br>
transmission device 10 comprises a two-mode, compound-split electro-<br>
mechanical transmission having four fixed gear ratios, and includes a plurality<br>
of gears operable to transmit the motive torque to an output shaft 64 and<br>
driveline through a plurality of torque-transfer devices contained therein.<br>
Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in detail in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode, Compound-Split, Hybrid<br>
Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed Ratios", which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0013] The control system comprises a distributed control module<br>
architecture interacting via a local area communications network to provide<br>
ongoing control to the powertrain system, including the engine 14, the<br>
electrical machines 56, 72, and the transmission 10.<br>
[0014] The exemplary powertrain system been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. The hybrid transmission 10<br>
receives input torque from torque-generative devices, including the engine 14<br>
and the electrical machines 56, 72, as a result of energy conversion from fuel<br>
or electrical potential stored in electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The<br>
ESD 74 typically comprises one or more batteries. Other electrical energy<br>
storage devices that have the ability to store electric power and dispense<br>
electric power may be used in place of the batteries without altering the<br>
concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is preferably sized based upon<br>
factors including regenerative requirements, application issues related to<br>
typical road grade and temperature, and, propulsion requirements such as<br>
emissions, power assist and electric range. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to transmission power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC lines<br>
referred to as transfer conductor 27. The TPIM 19 transfers electrical energy<br>
to the first electrical machine 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19<br>
similarly transfer electrical energy to the second electrical machine 72 by<br>
transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is transferable between the electrical<br>
machines 56, 72 and the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is<br><br><br>
being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and<br>
respective motor control modules configured to receive motor control<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom to provide motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality.<br>
[0015] The electrical machines 56, 72 preferably comprise known<br>
motor/generator devices. In motoring control, the respective inverter<br>
receives current from the ESD and provides AC current to the respective<br>
motor over transfer conductors 29 and 31. In regeneration control, the<br>
respective inverter receives AC current from the motor over the respective<br>
transfer conductor and provides current to the DC lines 27. The net DC<br>
current provided to or from the inverters determines the charge or discharge<br>
operating mode of the electrical energy storage device 74. Preferably,<br>
machine A 56 and machine B 72 are three-phase AC electrical machines and<br>
the inverters comprise complementary three-phase power electronic devices.<br>
[0016] The elements shown in Fig. 1, and described hereinafter, comprise a<br>
subset of an overall vehicle control architecture, and are operable to provide<br>
coordinated system control of the powertrain system described herein. The<br>
control system is operable to gather and synthesize pertinent information and<br>
inputs, and execute algorithms to control various actuators to achieve control<br>
targets, including such parameters as fuel economy, emissions, performance,<br>
driveability, and protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and<br>
machines A and B 56, 72. The distributed control module architecture of the<br>
control system comprises an engine control module ('ECM') 23, transmission<br>
control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module ('BPCM') 21, and<br>
the Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. A hybrid control<br>
module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and coordination of the<br>
aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface ('UI') 13 operably<br>
connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator typically<br>
controls or directs operation of the powertrain, including the transmission 10.<br>
Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a<br>
brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control.<br><br><br>
Within the control system, each of the aforementioned control modules<br>
communicates with other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local<br>
area network ('LAN') communications bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for<br>
structured communication of control parameters and commands between the<br>
various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is<br>
application-specific. By way of example, one communications protocol is the<br>
Society of Automotive Engineers standard J1939. The LAN bus and<br>
appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module<br>
interfacing between the aforementioned control modules, and other control<br>
modules providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and<br>
vehicle stability.<br>
[0017] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, the HCP 5 generates various commands, including: an engine<br>
torque command, clutch torque commands, for various clutches of the hybrid<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands, for the electrical machines A<br>
and B, respectively.<br>
[0018] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates an axle torque request. For<br>
simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally having bi-directional interface with<br>
engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various parameters that are sensed by ECM<br>
23 include engine coolant temperature, engine input speed to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0019] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br><br><br>
control signals, i.e. clutch torque commands to the clutches of the<br>
transmission.<br>
[0020] The BPCM 21 interacts with various sensors associated with the ESD<br>
74 to derive information about the state of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. Such<br>
sensors comprise voltage and electrical current sensors, as well as ambient<br>
sensors operable to measure operating conditions of the ESD 74 including,<br>
e.g., temperature and internal resistance of the ESD 74. Sensed parameters<br>
include ESD voltage, VBAT, ESD current, IBAT, and ESD temperature, TBAT.<br>
Derived parameters preferably include, ESD internal resistance, RBAT, ESD<br>
state of charge, SOC, and other states of the ESD, including available<br>
electrical power, PBAT_MIN and PBAT_MAX.<br>
[0021] The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPIM) 19 includes the<br>
aforementioned power inverters and motor control modules configured to<br>
receive motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom to<br>
provide motor drive or regeneration functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable<br>
to generate torque commands for machines A and B based upon input from<br>
the HCP 5, which is driven by operator input through UI 13 and system<br>
operating parameters. Motor torques are implemented by the control<br>
system, including the TPIM 19, to control the machines A and B. Individual<br>
motor speed signals are derived by the TPIM 19 from the motor phase<br>
information or conventional rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and<br>
communicates motor speeds to the HCP 5.<br>
[0022] Each of the aforementioned control modules of the control system is<br>
preferably a general-purpose digital computer generally comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, read only memory (ROM), random<br>
access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br><br><br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0023] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0024] The action described hereinafter occurs during active operation of the<br>
vehicle, i.e. that period of time when operation of the engine and electrical<br>
machines are enabled by the vehicle operator, typically through a 'key-on'<br>
action. Quiescent periods include periods of time when operation of the<br>
engine and electrical machines are disabled by the vehicle operator, typically<br>
through a 'key-off action. In response to an operator's action, as captured by<br>
the UI 13, the supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other<br>
control modules determine required transmission output torque, To.<br>
Selectively operated components of the hybrid transmission 10 are<br>
appropriately controlled and manipulated to respond to the operator demand.<br>
For example, in the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 1, when the<br>
operator has selected a forward drive range and manipulates either the<br>
accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the HCP 5 determines how and when the<br>
vehicle is to accelerate or decelerate. The HCP 5 also monitors the parametric<br>
states of the torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the<br>
transmission required to effect a desired rate of acceleration or deceleration.<br>
Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates over a range of<br>
output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator demand.<br>
[0025] Referring now to Fig. 2, a method and apparatus to estimate a state-<br>
of-life ('SOL') of an energy storage device useable in a hybrid control system<br><br><br>
in real-time is described. The exemplary method and apparatus to estimate<br>
state-of-life ('SOL') of the energy storage device in the hybrid control system<br>
in real-time is disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
/	, Attorney Docket No. GP-307586, entitled "Method and<br>
Apparatus for Real-time Life Estimation of an Electric Energy Storage<br>
Device", which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary method<br>
and apparatus to estimate state-of-life comprises an algorithm that monitors an<br>
electrical current and a state-of-charge and temperature of the electrical energy<br>
storage device 74 during operation. Temperature of the electrical energy<br>
storage device 74 is further monitored during quiescent periods of ESD<br>
operation. Quiescent periods of ESD operation are characterized by ESD<br>
power flow that is de minimus whereas active periods of ESD operation are<br>
characterized by ESD power flow that is not de minimus. That is to say,<br>
quiescent periods of ESD operation are generally characterized by no or<br>
minimal current flow into or out of the ESD. With respect to an ESD<br>
associated with a hybrid vehicle propulsion system for example, quiescent<br>
periods of ESD operation may be associated with periods of vehicle inactivity<br>
(e.g. powertrain, including electric machines, is inoperative such as during<br>
periods when the vehicle is not being driven and accessory loads are off but<br>
may include such periods characterized by parasitic current draws as are<br>
required for continuing certain controller operations including, for example,<br>
the operations associated with the present invention). Active periods of ESD<br>
operation in contrast may be associated with periods of vehicle activity (e.g.<br>
accessory loads are on and/or the powertrain, including electric machines, is<br>
operative such as during periods when the vehicle is being driven wherein<br>
current flows may be into or out of the ESD). The state of life ('SOL') of the<br>
electrical energy storage device 74 is determined based upon the ESD current,<br>
the state of charge of the ESD, and the temperature of the ESD during<br>
quiescent and active periods of operation. The inputs to calculation of SOL,<br>
include ESD internal resistance RBAT, ESD temperature TBAT, ESD state of<br>
charge SOC, and ESD current IBAT. These are known operating parameters<br>
measured or derived within the distributed control system. From these<br><br><br>
parameters, an A-h integration factor 110, a depth of discharge ('DOD') factor<br>
112, a driving temperature factor 114, and a resting temperature factor, TREST,<br>
116 are determined, and provided as input to determine a parameter for SOL.<br>
The operating parameters used to calculate SOL include: ESD current, IBAT,<br>
which is monitored in real-time, measured in amperes, and integrated as a<br>
function of time; magnitude of electrical current flowing through the ESD 74<br>
during each active charging and discharging event; ESD state-of-charge<br>
('SOC'), including depth-of-discharge ('DOD'); and, ESD temperature factor<br>
during active periods of operation, referred to as TDRIVE. The inputs of RBAT,<br>
TBAT, SOC, and IBAT, are known operating parameters within the distributed<br>
control system. The input TRHST iS a derived parametric value.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Fig. 3, a schematic diagram of an algorithm,<br>
preferably executed in one of the aforementioned control modules, is<br>
described which is executed in the control system to pre-calculate an array of<br>
possible changes in ESD state of life, SOLdelta, for a subsequent time-step,<br>
k+1, for each control degree of freedom. In this embodiment, the selected<br>
control degree of freedom comprises ESD current, IBAT. The algorithm is<br>
executed to determine an effect upon ESD state of life at a subsequent time-<br>
step for the array of ESD electrical current levels, to optimize vehicle<br>
operation and control based upon SOL of the ESD 74. This comprises<br>
estimating values for a change in SOL, referred to as SOLdelta, over a range of<br>
current levels, as follows.<br>
[0027] The estimated SOL factor is represented by Eq. 1:<br>
[0028] SOLk+1 = SOLdelta(x,y) + SOLk	[1]<br>
[0029] wherein:<br>
[0030] SOLk+1 is a State of Life parameter calculated for a subsequent<br>
iteration, k+1, typically a time step equal to elapsed time until the subsequent<br>
loop cycle in the control system;<br>
[0031] SOLk is the most recently calculated State of Life parameter;<br><br><br>
[0032] SOLdelta(x,y) comprises parameter, SOLdelta, calculated for given x,<br>
y values; and,<br>
[0033] SOLdelta(x,y) comprises a vector containing a range of the<br>
parameters, SOLdelta, wherein values for x are held constant, while values for y<br>
are incremented over a range. The SOLdelta parameter determined is preferably<br>
used by the aforementioned hybrid vehicle control system for optimization in<br>
conjunction with other system constraints. This is shown graphically with<br>
reference to Fig. 4, and specifically items 170, 172, 174, and 176.<br>
[0034] Referring again to Fig. 3, the algorithm operates by monitoring input<br>
parameter TBAT_K, comprising temperature of the ESD 74 at point in time, k.<br>
The ESD current for the subsequent time step, k+1, referred to as IBAT_K+1,<br>
comprises the aforementioned array of ESD electrical current values as shown<br>
at 138, in this instance from -200 amperes to +200 amperes in incremental<br>
values of 100 amperes, wherein the positive and negative symbols refer to<br>
direction of current flow, for charging and discharging of the ESD 74,<br>
respectively. All other parameters (y) in Eq. 1 to calculate SOLdelta are held<br>
constant. The input parameters used in calculation of SOLdelta, including<br>
current-integration 110, depth of discharge factor 112, driving temperature<br>
factor 114, are determined for each value of ESD current for the subsequent<br>
time step, IBAT_K+1. A second array 144, comprising a table of SOLdeita values<br>
determined based upon ESD current, IBAT_K+1, is calculated and useable by the<br>
control system to make decisions regarding subsequent operation of the<br>
vehicle.<br>
[0035] Estimation of total cumulated effect on current A-h integration<br>
component 110 can be directly calculated for of the array of current values<br>
138, in this instance from -200 amperes to +200 amperes in incremental values<br>
of 100 amperes, for time step k+1. The A-h integration component 110 to<br>
SOLdelta is used to calculate a final value for SOLdeita for each cell in the<br>
SOLdelta(x, y) vector. A cumulative value of A-h/mile driven is generally<br>
known for each vehicle, and typically comprises a direct linear relationship<br>
between values for ESD current and SOLdelta.<br><br><br>
[0036] Estimation of effect upon depth of discharge (DOD) is knowable, as<br>
follows. A parametric value for SOC is known at time, k. The value for<br>
electrical current, shown with reference to vector 138, is used in calculation of<br>
a parametric value for SOC, as shown in 136, wherein the resulting SOCk+1 is<br>
calculated. This value is then compared to the SOCDOD-LOCK, which comprises a<br>
ESD state-of-charge achieved at the subsequent calculation cycle were the<br>
proposed current commanded. The contribution of the DOD effect on SOC<br>
increases as the system exceeds the SOC-DOD LOCK IN threshold, which has<br>
a parametric value of 75% in this embodiment. This means the system<br>
penalizes departures from a SOC target area. The system greatly penalizes<br>
SOC when, for example, an action by the controller causes ESD discharge<br>
below a set value, e.g. 40%, as a result of an action such as an extended<br>
vehicle acceleration. A resulting parametric value for Depth-of-Discharge 112<br>
is passed into the DOD - SOL impact table. This SOL delta component is<br>
then submitted to the SOLdeita calculation.<br>
[0037] Estimating an effect based upon ESD operating temperature<br>
comprises calculating estimates of heat transfer to the ESD caused by the<br>
upcoming change of the control parameter, IBAT. This provides an indication<br>
of an amount the ESD is warmed up during the elapsed time. The ESD<br>
heating value is determined by inputting each value for the current, IBAT_K+1, to<br>
a mathematical model of the ESD 74, which includes one or more vectors or<br>
matrices of resistance as a function of SOC and temperature. The matrix may<br>
be based upon predetermined calibration based upon laboratory data or a<br>
calculated resistance from a control module. The calculation is further based<br>
upon thermal mass of the ESD 74, and any ESD cooling system capability.<br>
An estimate of thermal change 134 is determined, based on a control<br>
operation, as shown in block 134, and referred to as a difference between ESD<br>
temperatures at times k and k+1, i.e. (TBAT_K+1 - TBAT_K), which is determined<br>
based upon the control parameter, IBAT at time, k+1. Driving temperature<br>
factor is determined at block 114, which is passed to the SOLdelta calculation of<br>
block 142 for the timestep, k+1. This result occurs because operating<br>
temperatures and resting temperatures affect ESD total life. The time<br><br><br>
integrated current factor from block 110, the DOD factor from block 112, and<br>
the driving temperature factor from block 114 comprise the inputs to Block<br>
142, which determines a parametric value for SOLdelta for each current value of<br>
the array of current values input to the algorithm from block 138. An array of<br>
values as previously described, are created in the SOLdelta(x,y) vector 144.<br>
[0038] As an example, operating a hybrid vehicle to maximize ESD current<br>
and charging typically leads to large amounts of current passing through the<br>
ESD. The parameter for A-h/mile is likely higher than for an average<br>
operator, and the A-h component for calculation of SOLdelta(x,y) likely<br>
reflects fairly high values for SOLdelta at all positive and negative current<br>
values. However, because the control system has enough time to adapt to<br>
driving style of various operators (usually more astute drivers attempt to<br>
maximize operation in a recharging mode, e.g. regenerative braking, and<br>
identify areas of ESD boost), the State of Charge in this example remains at an<br>
optimal level around 75% +/- 2%. At the given moment of the calculation,<br>
with SOC at 74.5, the SOCDOD-LOCK value of block 136 was at 74.9. The<br>
instantaneous DOD at this point is only 0.4 % DOD. This translates to a<br>
relatively small effect upon SOLdelta for all Ibat/k+i current values. Stated<br>
differently, in the next timestep, there is limited risk to SOL related directly to<br>
a large depth of discharge.<br>
[0039] Lastly, when the operator most likely started with a high ESD<br>
temperature while passing large quantities of current through the ESD, which<br>
most likely warms it beyond the capability of its cooling system, the effect due<br>
to low current levels are likely reasonable. However at higher positive<br>
charging currents there would be larger effect upon SOLdeita, due to a future<br>
potential for ESD heating. There would be lesser increases in the SOLdelta for<br>
larger discharging currents as well, but not as large as the charging currents<br>
because discharge currents have less resistance than charging currents.<br>
[0040] Referring again to Fig. 4, a datagraph showing a state-of-life factor as<br>
a function of vehicle operating time and mileage is shown. Included is a target<br>
profile 160, comprising an idealized, linear change in SOL over time and<br>
distance driven. A second line 170 comprises a system wherein initial SOL v.<br><br><br>
time is above the idealized profile, potentially leading to a shorter service life<br>
for the ESD 74. Therefore there is a need to have a less aggressive use of the<br>
ESD in subsequent usage to optimize ESD life. A third line 180 comprises a<br>
system wherein the initial SOL v. time is below the idealized profile, leading<br>
to an extended service life for the ESD 74. In this instance, the operating<br>
system may be able to more aggressively use the electric machines 56, 72 to<br>
propel the vehicle. Furthermore, such a system facilitates more effective<br>
utilization of the hybrid propulsion system in a vehicle used in a climate<br>
having lower ambient temperatures. Referring now to items 172, 174, 176,<br>
there is shown three values for SOLdelta that have been calculated in<br>
accordance with Eq. 1 above, and the invention as described herein. This<br>
information is useable by the hybrid control system to decide on an<br>
appropriate level of operation of the electrical machines, in terms of electrical<br>
current flow, for the subsequent step, while taking into account effect on life<br>
of the ESD using the SOL factor. Therefore, electric machine currents can be<br>
controlled in accordance with the general objective of maintaining SOL in<br>
accordance with the target profile 160. Varying degrees of control techniques<br>
can effect this objective including, for example, establishing (e.g. setting or<br>
dictating) machine currents where aggressive control is warranted, e.g. where<br>
actual SOL requires gross adjustments to comply with the target profile or<br>
SOL is on a track to premature end of life relative to the target profile.<br>
Alternatively, merely establishing machine current limits may be more<br>
appropriate where less aggressive control is warranted, e.g. where actual SOL<br>
requires minor adjustments to comply with the target profile or SOL is on a<br>
track to an extended end of life relative to the target profile. In general, it is<br>
desirable to converge the actual SOL to the target profile quickly while<br>
minimizing overshoot.<br>
[0041] This embodiment describes a method and system to predetermine an<br>
effect of a change in an operating parameter, e.g. ESD current, upon an<br>
operating state of the device, e.g. ESD state of life. For other applications,<br>
there may be more degrees of control, so effects on SOLdelta may be calculated<br>
across other control parameters, and passed to the control system. It is<br><br><br>
understood that such modifications fall within the scope of the invention. It is<br>
also understood that modifications in the transmission hardware are allowable<br>
within the scope of the invention. The invention has been described with<br>
specific reference to the preferred embodiments and modifications thereto.<br>
Further modifications and alterations may occur to others upon reading and<br>
understanding the specification. It is intended to include all such<br>
modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the<br>
