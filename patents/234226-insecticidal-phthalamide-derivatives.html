The compounds of the formula (JV), staiting materials in the above-mentioned preparation process (b), are novel ones and can be easily obtained according to the process described in JP-A 61- 246161, for example,<br>
by reacting a compound represented by the formula-<br>
(Figure Removed)wherein X and n have the same definition as aforementioned, with the compounds of the aforementioned formula (TS)<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br><br>
in which R represents a hydrogen atom and Y, m, A1, r, Q, A2, s and E have the same definitions as aforementioned.<br>
The reaction can be conducted in an adequate diluent. As examples of the diluent used in that case there can be mentioned aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons (may be optionally chlori-nated), for example, pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, petroleum ether, hgroine, benzene, toluene, xylene, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, di-chlorobenzene; ethers, for example, ethyl ether, methyl ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, butyl ether, dioxane, dimethoxyethane (DME), tefrahydrofuran (THF), diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DGM); esters, for example, ethyl acetate, amyl acetate; acid amides, for example, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methylpyrrolidone, l,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone,<br>
hexamethyl phosphoric triamide (HMPA); acids, for example, acetic acid.<br>
The reaction can be conducted in a substantially wide range of temperature. It can be conducted at the temperatures in a range of generally room temperature to. about 200Â°C, preferably room temperature to 150Â°C.<br>
Although said reaction is conducted desirably under normal pressure, it can be operated also under elevated pressure or under reduced pressure.<br>
In conducting the reaction, the aimed compounds can be obtained, for example, by reacting equimolar amount or a litile excess amount of the compounds of the formula (EH) to l mole of the compounds of the formula (X) in a diluent, for example, acetic acid.<br>
Many of the compounds of the above-mentioned formula (X) are known (available on the marker)<br>
compounds and as their specific examples there can be mentioned,<br>
phthalic anhydride,<br>
3-fluorophthalic anhydride,<br>
3-chlorophthalic anhydride,<br>
3-bromophthalic anhydride,<br>
3-iodophthalic anhydride,<br>
3-methylphthalic anhydride,<br>
3-nitrophthalic anhydride,<br>
3,6-difluorophthalic anhydride,<br><br>
3,6-dichlorophthalic anhydride, 4,5-dichlorophthalic anhydride, 3,4,5,6-tetrafluorophthalic anhydride, 3,4,5,6-tetrachlorophthalic anhydride, 3-methanesulfonyloxyphthalic anhydride.<br>
Among the above-mentioned examples, 3-methanesulfonyloxyphthalic anhydride can be easily obtained from 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride and methanesulfonyl chloride according to the process described in Tetrahedron Lett., 1988, 29, 5595-5598.<br>
Similarly the compounds of the aforementioned formula (JU), in which R3 represents a hydrogen atom, starting materials for the compounds of the formula (IV), can be easily obtained, as described in the aforementioned preparation process (a), by a catalytic hydrogen reduction of the compounds represented by the aforementioned formula (IX) hÃ¤ving a nitro group in place of an amino group, corresponding to the amino group (R3 ='H) in the formula (UI).<br>
The catalytic hydrogen reduction can be conducted in an adequate diluent and as examples of the diluent used in that case there can be mentioned ethers, for example, ethyl ether, methyl ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, butyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF); alcohols, for example, methanol, etha-nol, isopropanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, and as catalytic reduction catalyst there can be mentioned palladium carbon, Raney nickel, platinum oxide.<br>
It can be conducted at the temperatures generally between about O to about 100Â°C, preferably room temperature to about 80Â°C.<br>
Said reaction can be operated under normal pressure to elevated pressure.<br>
For example, an objective compound of the formula (UI), in which R3 represents hydrogen, can be obtained by hydrogenation of l mole of the nitro compound in a diluent, for example, ethanol in the presence of 0.1-10 % (w/w) palladium carbon.<br>
Moreover, the compounds of the formula (IH), in which R3 represents hydrogen, can also be obtained by a reaction with a metal ete. instead of a catalytic hydrogen reduction.<br>
As a process using a metal ete. there can be mentioned, for example, a process of treating iron powder in acetic acid, a process of reacting zinc dust under the neutral condition (Organic Syntheses Collective Vol. E, p. 447), a process of reacting stannic chloride under an acidic condition (Organic<br><br>
Syntheses Collective Vol. H, p. 254), a process of reacting titanium trichloride under the neutral condition, ete.<br>
