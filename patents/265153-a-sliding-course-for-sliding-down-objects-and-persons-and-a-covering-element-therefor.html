				<td>A SLIDING COURSE FOR SLIDING DOWN OBJECTS AND PERSONS AND A<br>
COVERING ELEMENT THEREFOR<br>
The present invention relates to a sliding course for sliding<br>
down objects and persons and a covering element therefor.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to a downhill sliding course or sliding track for sliding<br>
objects and persons down a slope or a hill comprising of covering or cladding<br>
elements for covering the surface of the slope and a water source to moisten the<br>
elements with water. With suitable accessories activities similar to skiing,<br>
sleighing and surfing can be performed on the sliding course, Accordingly, the<br>
object of the invention includes also accessories that can be used to perform<br>
these activities. The invention provides individual appliances to implement the<br>
sliding course.<br>
Background art<br>
All summer and winter sports are based on conditions created by nature,<br>
making use to smaller or grater extent of all possibilities available at the site and<br>
the possibilities provided by the climatic conditions.<br>
The biggest obstacle to summer skiing is that water runs-off very fast from<br>
the slopes and artificial ski trails. The continuous replacement of the run-off<br>
water has been solved earlier too, replacing it by way of a simple pump making<br>
the surface of the slope slippery and cooling it at the same time.<br><br>
But this water is very different from the snow suitable for skiing or from the<br>
waves of the ocean. It is not only warmer, melted, but it also moves along (or<br>
faster) with the user of the slope, and therefore there is no difference of impulse<br>
between them which could be used for control (it is a good visual illustration that<br>
an excellent snow covered slope is only suitable for skiing as long as the snow is<br>
stagnant, and at the moment the snow starts to slide - when avalanche develops<br>
- the skier is no longer able to direct the ski with the help of the snow moving<br>
together with him, and is carried away together with any obstacles on its path.<br>
For all sports mentioned above the basic paradigm of physics is valid :<br>
namely the phenomenon and law of conservation of momentum. It states<br>
that all bodies conserve their original state of movement as long as external<br>
forces do not force them to change it. In a closed system comprising two<br>
bodies of any type, the change in the state of motion of one of the<br>
bodies is equal to the change in the state of motion of the other. In the instant<br>
case, the two bodies are the user and the sliding course (slope) or the user and<br>
the water. Thus, changing the state of motion is only possible, if there is another<br>
body which can be forced to change its state of motion. This other body can be<br>
the Earth, sufficient quantity of water, air, etc. The change in the state of motion<br>
is determined by the vector sum of the effect of one or more forces. In the case<br>
of skiing, the change in the state of motion for hard slope is the result of the<br><br>
friction force and the force of inertia of the dislodged snow, while for powder snow the force<br>
of inertia of the dislodged snow alone. In the case of surfing the reaction force of the<br>
dislodged water enables the sports person to control the movemen.. In the case of slides<br>
dieting is impossible as the water moves together with the user, sometimes even faster than<br>
the user, and instead of giving a support for controlling direction the water sweeps away the<br>
user using a different sign forcing.<br>
One of the most enjoyable types of sliding is ski, particularly Alpine skiing. The sliding<br>
modes described in the technical state of the art try to create alf these enjoyment m the<br>
climatic conditions of summer. All modes, which have become independent sport can<br>
reproduee however only in a limited way the feeling of sliding down a high forest slope on a<br>
stable snow. Besides their special advantages and extraordinary richness in experience all<br>
have some disadvantages, which should be eliminated.<br>
We have observed that sea wave surfing is the sport that provides the movement<br>
expereences closest to skiing (and within that the sport that co-ordinates movement in a slope<br>
at a higher level, snowboarding, which is expanding rapidly). Nevertheless, there are a<br>
number of circumstances that hinder it becoming a real mass sport.<br>
-	It can only be pursued at sections of the beach where the wind and soil surface suppott<br>
the evolution of exceptionally high, braking waves. (Skiing too, can only be pursued in<br>
winter, and only on the mountains, and thus, for instance, the several billion people living in<br>
poorer and warmer countries are excluded form it.)<br>
-	It is only possible to surf when wind conditions are ideal (it is only possible to ski when<br>
snow conditions are good, although snow cannons are already available).<br>
-	In order to have time to enjoy travelling upon the waves it is necessary to get into the<br>
see far away from the shore swimming hard. (this corresponds to the necessity of climbing up<br>
to the top of a hill in order to slide down).<br>
US Patent 4,339,122 describes a slide of inhomogeneous inclination built on sloped<br>
terrain, imitating the experience of wave surfing, where the slippery surface is provided by a<br>
constant flow of water onto a plastic surface coming from pipes located at not too big<br>
distancss from each other on the underside, while the surfer slides down the slide on a<br>
footboard similar to the surfing board or a snowboard.<br>
The deficiencies of this known solution are the following:<br>
-The water supply of the sloped surface is not solved. The planned water supply system<br>
is not able to provide an even water layer with even water thickness.<br>
-The thickness of the water is unregulated to such an extent, that is not possible to<br>
exclude fully the formation of deep rivulets, streams hindering the sliding down, while at<br><br>
other places the covering surface might remain completely dry. For this reason, the friction<br>
and resistance will change from centimeter to centimeter making the control of direction more<br>
difficult.<br>
Nothing in the irregular covering surface with a curvature that is not pre-calculable,<br>
ensures'the even spreading of the water. The introduction of the water at numerous discrete<br>
points provides only an imaginary solution and only at the start of the operation, since at the<br>
points of outflow as a result of the special outlet the water spreads, but due to the unevenness<br>
and curvatuee of the surface on the one hand,' and to the springing effect of surface tension,<br>
after a distance of just but a fraction of a meter the water forms a stream.<br>
It is a significant disadvantage that the water needs to be supplied almost evenly on the<br>
whole height of the route for even the hope of having the water spread evenly, but in this way<br>
at the bottom of the slope the full volume of water is collected and the water layer will<br>
probably be thick, making impossible to control the direction of sliding and taking away the<br>
enjoymen..<br>
The depicted water supply system requires large volumes of water as the water poured<br>
onto the surface flows away immediately and so the water must be replaced continuously,<br>
otherwise the surface will not be evenly moist. To minimize water demand the inclination of<br>
the slope must be maximized at 7-20 deg.<br>
The yield of the water outlet points must be carefully regulated, but at least carefully<br>
adjusted, and this is a meter the patent does not discuss at all. Lacking this, the inequaltty of<br>
the water flow is even greater.<br>
The water outlet points and the piping conduciing to them must be positioned before the<br>
construction of the track covering, and therefore the effect of the water-film and how much<br>
additional water is still required can only be observed later, but modifications, if necessary,<br>
can only be carried out by breaking-up the covering.<br>
Should the water run on the track be spread evenly in spite of the above, even then a<br>
favorable direction control could not be achieved as the principle of physics to be described<br>
later suffers, as the momentum conservation phenomena used for controlling direction does<br>
not make the change in the state of motion possible for bodies moving togethe..<br>
In practice, the shaping of the sliding device "board" makes difficutt and cumbersome<br>
the required steering. The exertion of the bottom steering element arrests the slide at times<br>
even when this is not desirable, and when turning (banking) the user must tilt over the plane<br>
defined by the steering element and the board, which causes instability.<br><br>
At higher speeds the protuberant bottom steering element will only sink into the material<br>
of the covering panel and produced the required effect if the user is rather experienced Oust<br>
think about unwilling acceleration..<br>
- EP 0873 770 Al "SURFSLIDING METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SLIDING ON<br>
ARTEFICAL SURFACES" provides method and apparatus for surfing on artificial surface.<br>
-	The shortages of this known method are the following:<br>
-	does not provide even miniaturization, because although the excess drip water is<br>
partially drained, it is not able to spread evenly the water from the supply pipes.<br>
-Huge amounts of water are required for continuous operation, even when the water in<br>
the different sections is individually recalculated.<br>
-Huge dimensions also are required for the desired operations the size of the canal<br>
visibly exceeds that of a house.<br>
-Large amounts of capital are needed for construciing an architecturally correct facility.<br>
-It is questionabee whether is it possible for more than one sports person to be close by.<br>
-It demands extensive surfing experiences.<br>
-The principle of operation resembles more that of the roller boarding than surfing, i.e. at<br>
high speeds it is difficult to stop based on braking on artificial grass, and thus the tracks<br>
planned for high speed can be life threatening.<br>
-The length of the characteristically enclosed track must be limited for clear end-to-end<br>
visibility; otherwise it is not possible to provide fast help in case of possible accidents.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
The airn to be achieved by the invention is the production of a sliding course enabling<br>
direction controlled sliding executed on it on a suitable sloping terrain along with an<br>
additionll auxiliary aim to provide an enjoyment or experience similar to winter skiing in<br>
summe,, optionally to make it suitable for use in recreation parks, ski trail tracks or in<br>
enclosed or indoor areas. A further objective is that the sliding course be safe, environment<br>
friendly, energy and water saving, that its constructio,, maintenance and repair be as simple<br>
and cost saving as possible and that its use be easy to learn.<br>
There are no sports opportunitiss in the summer recreation parks, bathing estabiishments<br>
that serve this purpose, require activity, and action, provide individual and collective<br>
enjoyment without requiring skill and knowledge, but demand toil and offer challenge_ People<br>
looking for diversion can only chose dry-land team sports, i.e. ball games or at the most, can<br>
enjoy the passive delights of a slide, or can chose as recreation the passive joys of doing<br>
nothing.<br><br>
It is true in general; the real enjoyment for people is action, movement that he is able<br>
to control at (direct) all times. There are actions that offer momentary pleasure e.g. slides,<br>
when for a short period the person looses control over their state of motion, but only<br>
because it is evident right form the beginning, that at the end they will arrive at a safe,<br>
controlled state.<br>
The realization of an apparatus suitable to turn the world-wide practiced winter<br>
skiing, that had become a mass sport available to all into a sports activity that can be<br>
pursued in summer as an aquatic sport, by having the micro-terraces made along the<br>
surface of the slides made of more slippery material than ever, and made even more<br>
slippery with water poured on it stop the downpour of water, and thus rendering the<br>
sliding surface suitable for having direction controlled movement made on it.<br>
If the upper surface layer of the water mass is separated by a suitable, watertight<br>
plastic sheet with a smooth surface, suitably soft and flexible, and dividing the water<br>
layer thus produced into small pools located in compartments, micro-terraces, than these<br>
micro-terraces will not allow the water to pour down. The losses caused by small seeping<br>
and the water dislodged during the use by objects, sports people, surfers sliding down can<br>
be simply replaced with the water pumped into the basin located at the top of the slide so<br>
that the water runs through a slipover and flows smoothly to the uppermost micro-terrace<br>
and down the others one after the next to the lowest micro-terrace replacing the water<br>
shortage in each of them.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a sliding course for sliding persons<br>
and objects down a slope having a surface, said course comprising sliding elements<br>
covering the surface of the slope, and a water source for moistening said elements<br>
characterized in that<br>
said sliding elements comprise pools located. one below the other, wherein said<br>
pools form water filled micro-terraces;<br>
the pools forming the micro-terraces are formed by a covering sheet covering the<br>
slope in a water-tight manner and flexible ribs emerge from said sheet; and<br><br>
each pool is bordered by said covering sheet and by at least one of said flexible<br>
ribs and is closed by a flexible transverse sectioning rib joined to said covering sheet and<br>
said at least one flexible rib.<br>
In accordance with preferred embodiments of the sliding course of the present<br>
invention :<br>
-	the surface of the rib accosting the pool is made of a material having low<br>
friction coefficient in the moist state;<br>
-	the ribs andlor the covering sheet is affixed onto an underlay sheet;<br>
-	the underlay sheet is made of a self-supporting, rigid material.;<br>

-	it is mounted on a conveyor belt and the water source is the basin located at<br>
the bottom of the conveyor belt;<br>
-	the inclination angle of the conveyor belt ,is adjustable.<br>
The present invention also provides covering element for constructing a sliding<br>
course as hereinbefore described for sliding persons and objects down a slope having a<br>
surface, which course comprises covering elements covering the surface of the slope,<br>
characterized in that said covering element comprises a covering sheet adapted to be<br>
fastened to a sloped surface and having a basin on its upper side formed by ribs located<br>
at the lower part of the slope and closed by transverse rib sections at both ends, and<br>

Description of preferred embodimenss of the invention<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the operation of the sliding course I according to the invention. The<br>
sliding course has a sliding surface from which ribs 2 protrude. Between the ribs'2 there are<br>
gaps, slots, cavities, depressions or pools, respectivey,, containing water and so a sliding<br>
device 7 placed on top of the ribs 2 presses the ribs made of flexibIe material from the inside,<br>
which bend down. When the nbs bend down the stiding device 7 dislodges tbe water filling<br>
tbe pools between the ribs 2, consequenly, changes the state of motion. The force required for<br>
it acts on the sliding device 7 and thereby steering motions can be achieved similar to skiing if<br>
suitably controlled.<br>
One of the advantageoss solutions of the invention is the sliding surface 1 mounted for<br>
suppott on a slope 20 e.g. as found in nature or constructed, installed in recreaiion parks or<br>
bathing establishments.. The sliding surface 1 due to its width, provides sufficient place for<br>
the maneuvering required during surfing. Figure 2 shows a sliding course installed in such a<br>
larger area, where for lnstance the sliding surface 1 is placed on a hillside. The hillside is not<br>
necessarily straight and therefore the sliding surface 1 can include jumps 1a on the prosilient<br>
part of the slope. At the top of the hill there is a more or less horizontal launching pad 9 and<br>
the sliding surface 1 begins there. The sliding surface 1 widens along the slope, and both<br>
above it and along its sides there are water feeders 39. water feeders 39 must be arranged<br>
especially at the top of the sliding surface 1 and at widening sections of it. Each water feeder<br>
39 is equipped with an adjusting element or control valve 41. There are protective guard-rails<br>
3 at the side of the sliding surface 1 which prevenss the water from running off, and if made<br>
with a suitable, flexible and soft material serves as protection device, preveniing the persons<br>
sliding down the slope from sliding beyond the sliding surface 1. There is a collecting basin 4<br>
at the bottom of the sliding surface 1. There is a lift 33 by the sliding surface 1 which if<br>
necessary can divide the sliding surface into two parts. Both the part below the lift and the<br>
sliding surface 1 can be supplied with water continuously, which means that almost identical<br>
quantities of water flow down on each partition on the full width of the sliding surface I. The<br>
water is supplied to the water feeder 39 from the collecting basin 4 by a pump 11.<br>
Persons wishing to slide down the sliding surface 1 get to the launching pad 9 located at<br>
the top of the hill with the lift 33, from where they can slide down the sliding surface, which<br>
is continuously flushed by water slowly streaming to the collecting basin 4 and can execute<br>
maneuvess if they wish. During their slide a sliding device 7 can be affixed to their feet<br>
pushes down the ribs 2 located on the sliding surface in the manner shown in Figure 1, and<br>
the sliding device 7 transfers a part of the persons and of its own impulse to the water located<br>
in the space between the ribs 2. It is mainly due to this transfer of impulse that it is possible to<br><br>
carry out maneuvess during sliding down the sliding surface I, that is, it is possible to come<br>
down in a meandering fashion and not only along a straight line.<br>
The character of the sliding surface 1 is fully identical with all features of the skimg track<br>
(Figure 2). The users sliding down the sliding surface 1 can be seen well. The users starting<br>
from the launching pad 9 fasten the sliding device 7 to their feet and doing the maneuvess '<br>
they wish or now proceed towards .the end of the slope.<br>
The outrun surface area 1b located at the bottom of the sliding surface 1 has a very slight<br>
inclination or can even be a horizontal sliding surface. The importance of the overrun surface<br>
1b is to allow the users stop there and break in a more pleasant way.<br>
Figure 2 shows a lift 33 deployed to make scaling more pleasan,, together with its<br>
engineering structure. The sliding surface 1 is visibly not horizontal and it does not have an<br>
even width. The track sections having different inclination make sliding down- more<br>
enjoyable. The differenee in the width of the course in case of a slight downward widening<br>
does not cause problems due to the water spreading effect of the micro-terraces. In case of<br>
more significatt widening or of using assembly methods other than the horizontal (e.g. slated,<br>
distinct micro-terraced, micro-cellulrr construction mode) it is necessary to provide for<br>
additionll water feeding. The water is supplied directly to the sliding surface 1 by bleeding<br>
the pipe 12 conducted along the track or with separate water supply through control valves 41<br>
or other fixtures, but also spraying can be used, increasing thereby the entertainment feature<br>
of the course. Safety rail-rail 3 must be installed at the side of the sliding surface 1. A<br>
supplementary water supply could playa role in the faster fill-up of the course as water filling<br>
could start simultaneously at different levels of the course. In this case water control must be<br>
provided for after the filling, as during use less water is required than during filling.<br>
When narrowing the width of the course, a minor reduction of width will result in an<br>
insignificant water surplus, but the water surplus will become significant if the narrowing is<br>
more pronounced, creating pleasant and exciting rapid areas, where stopping or passing with<br>
ski represenss a serious challenge.<br>
The collecting basin 4 located at the bottom of the course should not necessarlly be an<br>
inherent part of the course. The basin can be hidden, in this case the users will stop on the<br>
overrun lb. The basin, however, is indispensabee for replacing the run-off water. The pump<br>
supplies the water collected and cleaned in the basin, and often warmed up on the slope, into<br>
the basin 8 located at the top of the course.<br>
Figure 3 shows the structure of the sliding surface 1. The ribs 2 located on the sliding<br>
surface 1 are able to retain water in the space between them, that is, there is a pool 10 or<br>
micro-terrace between two adjacent ribs. These micro-terracss 10 must naturally be closed at<br><br>
their lateral sides or ends and this is solved by a length of a transverse or sectioning rib 17<br>
abridging said ribs 2 with said sliding surface.<br>
The micro-terraces 10 can be elongate pools bordered by flexible ribs 2 having suitable<br>
profiles and made of a suitable material, and extending along an approximately horizontal<br>
path, approximately perpendicular to the angle of the slope, and vertical sectioning ribs 17<br>
limiting the lateral flow of water.<br>
The micro-terraces must always be closed on the sides to prevent water from pouring out<br>
or limiting the outflow to the required rate. The water-filled space between two adjacent ribs<br>
2, i. e. the micro-terrace must be interrupted by inserting vertical sectioning ribs 17 between<br>
the horizontal ribs according to the solution shown in Figure 3, detailed later on the basis of<br>
the solution shown in Figure 11, either by pasting or screwing them onto the upper covermg<br>
sheet 5, (if necessary to the horizontal sections can be interrupted by pasting supplementary<br>
vertical sectioning ribs 17). This solution allows the safe use of creek-surfing in those surface<br>
sections of slopes covered by large underlay sheets manufactured economically in coils or<br>
boards, that deviate from the horizontal by intention or accident.<br>
Figure 4. shows the structure of sliding surface 1 in a schemaiic sectional view. It is<br>
appreciated that the sliding surface I is placed on the surface created by the suppott surface<br>
20, and the sliding surface 1 can have jumps la or raised sites too. The collecting basin 4<br>
already referred to, is located at the bottom of the sliding surface 1, and is occasionally<br>
connected to the sliding surface 1 through the overrun surface Ib. The surface of the overrun<br>
Ib is horizontal or has a slight inclination. There is a underlay-plate 6 placed onto the support<br>
surface 20 to even out minor unevenness and to soften the course. The micro-terraces 10<br>
formed by the ribs 2 are located there. The below the launching pad 9 located at the top of the<br>
slope there is an upper basin 8, which allows the continuous replacement of the water on the<br>
lower parts of the course should the pump II stop. The ribs 22 below the sliding device 7<br>
placed on the sliding surface 1 bend and the dislodged water from there 13 runs off and<br>
spreads on the lower parts of the sliding surface 1. The continued feed and the dislodged<br>
water. 13 forms a permanent overflow curtain 19, which if properly adjusted spreads evenly<br>
through the whole width of the sliding surface 1.<br>
All sloping surfaces can be covered impermeably with a slippery material - preferably<br>
plastic - in such a manner that narrow pools, micro-terraces 10 are formed by ribs 2<br>
protruding from the surface, and then water is let onto the surface at the top. The water will<br>
stop at the micro-terraces 10, and the flow will slow down form there on to such an extent<br>
than can be taken as approximately zero. The body sliding down in the slope covered in this<br>
way by water opens the way for the flow of water by bending the ribs (see Figure 4.) and thus<br><br>
the surface becomes more slippery, and at the same time, the resultant of the reaction force of<br>
the dislodged water and the force required to bend the ribs is suitable to change the state of<br>
motion of the body (e.g. breaks, changes its direction.. The ribs 2, due to their flexibiltty<br>
return to their original position soon after the body passed, forming once again micro-terraces<br>
that fill, up with the permanently slow water flow and thus, the sliding surface I is almost<br>
immediately regenerated.<br>
Figure 4. shows the general theoretic scheme of the design of the course. The different<br>
elements can be left out as the case may be, and can be assembled into numerous variants.<br>
The sliding surface is in all cases mounted onto a natural or constructed support surface<br>
20. A support structure 20 is built onto the natural hillside after suitable preparation, and then<br>
the sliding surface 1 is fastened to it. In the absence of a natural hillside, the understructure is<br>
supported by a constructed support. In all cases the understructure must be made on the basis<br>
of and architectural static design. In the dimensioning the full filled-up water weight must be<br>
considered, as well as dynamic use and the changing load.<br>
The pools, micro-terraces 10 formed by the ribs 2 built onto the sliding surface 1 in their<br>
normal state are filled with water and allow the run-off of a minimal water overflow 19<br>
corresponding to the norma,, base level water transpott of the pump. The inclination of the<br>
sliding surface 1 is not always constant, it may have depressioss and protrusions la, which<br>
might create hogbacks, making the slide more enjoyable. The course at its lower section has<br>
an overrun surface 1b a few meters long, with a very small inclination, which could be almost<br>
horizontal or even of negative inclination. The water flowing down gets into the basin 4. The<br>
job of the basin 4 is to store the water required to fill up the whole length of the course and<br>
replace water losses, to provide space for water circulation and cleaning.<br>
The pump 11 placed in the inside of the basin 4 space or outside of it, conducss the water<br>
through the pipe 12 onto the basin 8 located at the top of the course. The yield of the pump '<br>
must be regulated, this can be achieved either by using several pumps or through the electric<br>
or water side regulation of the pump. The yield of the pump depends on the lift of the course,<br>
the geometric dimension,, water contents, the time requirement for filling-up and the number<br>
of users.<br>
The basin 8 ensures the even flow of water onto the course.<br>
The basin 8 is covered by the launching pad 9 at the top of the course, from there the<br>
users can start without damaging the course.<br>
In case of increasing the width of the sliding surface 1, or to replace water losses,<br>
additional water feeders 39 can be used in different sections of the course. Water feeders can<br><br>
have an important role at the start-up of the course, as starting the filling at several levels<br>
reduces the time required for the complete filling-up.<br>
Sliding surface can be produced in any slopped surface with any of the surface making<br>
methods described below.<br>
The material of the sliding surface 1 can be (poly)urethane-, PVC, KPE or other plastic,<br>
all UV stabilized, water resistan,, without any water soluble paint or any hazardous material<br>
contenss and it must be made of a wear resistant and elastic materia..<br>
The material of the ribs 2 can be (poly)urethane-, PVC, KPE or other plastic, all must be<br>
elastic, properly soft, UV stabilized, water resistan,, without any water soluble paint or any<br>
hazardous material contents and it must be made of a wear resistant and elastic materia..<br>
The ribs 2 can be fixed securely in different ways, e. g. by<br>
-pasting<br>
-shaped fitting, joining<br>
-	clamped down with a fastening element<br>
-the combination of the above.<br>
The ribs as seen, can be structured in a variety of shapes and manners.<br>
Figure 5.shows the different version of the ribs placed onto the sliding surface 1. For all<br>
versions it can be said that the position could be reversed in comparison to the Figure, that is<br>
they can bend not only towards the direction of the slope, downward,, but upwards too,<br>
relative to the normal of the sliding surface 1. This could be useful for instance for the lift 33,<br>
where the suitably constructed and positioned ribs can bend upward when the person proceeds<br>
upwards on the slope, sliding up with the aid of two sliding devices.<br>
The shapes of the ribs 2:<br>
-	2/a horizontal rib, straight: is a rib perpendicular to the inclination line of the course<br>
made with a protrusion angle not deviating from it by more than +10 deg.<br>
-	2/b horizontal rib uniform strength: identical tension is created through the whole cross-<br>
section of the rib<br>
-	2/c horizontal rib straight forward bending: ensures soft track characteristic, bending<br>
more easily at the arrival of the user, the course is more slippery. The angle of its position is<br>
more than +10 degree from the perpendicular, but without being horizonta.. Mounting this rib<br>
in the opposite sense a backward bending rib is achieved, making the course harder, it is more<br>
difficutt to use, but at the same time more enjoyable.<br>
-	2/d horizontal rib curving backward:: combines the softness of the forward bending rib<br>
with the relatively large water space, and allows pasted or painted promotional material to be<br>
placed on the valley-side surface.<br><br>
-	2/e horizontal rib curving forward : An even softer track characteristic than the straight<br>
forward bending rib.<br>
-	2/f horizontal rib with a stiffening profile; the rounded stiffening profile helps fast<br>
return to the original position, and protects the first user from damages caused by the thin<br>
profile edges. The stiffening profile placed on the hillside helps stopping providing shaped<br>
resistance.<br>
-	2/g horizontal rib with cavernous inside profile: the air sacks can have an advantagoous<br>
effect on the flexibility of the ribs. The sliding course can be made even more pleasant if the<br>
cavernous internal rib profile 2/g according to Figure 5 is used in such a manner that the<br>
caverns inside the ribs are closed, connected to each other and to a regulated power<br>
compressor, than the pressure of the enclosed air is varied. As a result the character of the<br>
course changes significantly, becoming harder as the pressure increases.<br>
-	2/h horizontal rib with grooved surface (Figure 9): the cross grooving of the ribs 2<br>
improvss significantly the friction across the axis of the course, improving the possibility of<br>
turning. The depth of the grooves is 1-10 mm, the width is 5-20 mm.<br>
-	2/multi covering sheet including several ribs (Figure 14): the manufacture of the ribs 2<br>
with the covering 5 accelerates site mounting. It is not necessary to pay attention to the<br>
horizontal assembly, water tightness is ensured without it. The 21m covering sheets are placed<br>
over each other with overlap, then they are fastened relative to the slope and pasted togethe..<br>
-	rib 2/z structured in a similar manner than the slates or shingles used for roofing (Figure<br>
13), it has an upward bend along one side forming a rib 2/z and a partial upward bend on two<br>
adjoining sides and represenss thereby a genarally rectangular course covering elemen.. These<br>
elemenss are positioned on the surface with a mutual overlap in the way as roofing tiles are<br>
laid on a roof. Its advantage is its almost complete insensitivity to horizontal assembly,<br>
completely different course surfaces resembiing spatial curves can be covered with it. The<br>
lower section can even be curved, but the tree sides melting together can form a spoon,<br>
concave spatulate or slipper-like elemen,, respectively. The full lower surface of the slate-like<br>
rib is pasted, thus the water tightness of the sliding surface 1 is guaranteed. On the lower side<br>
of the micro-terraces water passages and overflow bores are made.<br>
All of the forms described above can be combined with any of the fastening method..<br>
Figure 6 shows a version of the sliding surface 1 where,the ribs join self-supporting<br>
cover sheet Sa equipped with stiffening ribs. The covering sheet Sa is structured by bands and<br>
affixed to the supporiing surface 20 by screws. In this case bolsters too can act as or replace a<br>
supporting surface 20. The bands of the covering sheet Sa can be fastened to the supporiing<br>
surface 20 with the aid of fastening elemenss 25 for instance screws.<br><br>
Figure 6 shows one of the most obvious methods for the construction of the course. The<br>
course is made of plastic profile covering sheet Sa made specially for this purpose, which<br>
overlapping and fastened in a base-board-like manner fastens at the same time the horizontal<br>
ribs placed between them. The upper part of the plastic profile is smooth, while on the bottom<br>
is equipped with ribs of such height and strength that guarantee stable sliding surface even is<br>
the suppott is located at 60-120 cm. Fastening is ensured by the fastening elements 25 made<br>
in the form of screws and sunk into the base structure forming the supporiing surface. Water<br>
tightness too, is basically ensured by the entire bottom part of the rib 2 and the upper hillside<br>
of the base being filled without gap with adhesivessea.. In this way the course is self-<br>
supporting, the assembly time is reduced, the replacement of the elements is fast and simple.<br>
With the utilization of this solution it is sufficient to have the base structure consist of<br>
bolsters.<br>
The. ribs 2 forming tbe micro-terraces 10 of the course joint tbe covering sheet 5 with<br>
shaped fitting. Their shape is chosen based on the use of the course. The angular offset of the<br>
. ribs 2, their frequency and shape can change, always in order to achieve the desired results.<br>
Figure 7 shows the use of a cover sheet 5 made of flexible material, on which there are<br>
notches narrower than the surface and widening inside. On the side of the nbs 2 connecting to<br>
the covering sheet 5 there is a beading that fits into the notches. The covering sheet 5a is<br>
indirectly fastened to the supporting surface 20 through the underiay-piate 6. Both the<br>
covering sheet 5 and the underlay-paate 6 are for instance affixed with the aid of fastening<br>
elemenss 25 made in the form of screws. The covering sheet 5 thickens at the notches 24 and<br>
thus the whole surface becomes more flexible. The covering sheet 5 can be made of bands and<br>
the bands join together sidewise with connecting surfaces 21a.<br>
Figure 8 shows how is it possible to make the spreading of the water even along the<br>
width of the sliding surface 1. Probably the upper edge of the ribs 2 is not exactly horizontal.<br>
Probably the strength of the ribs 2 also is not even along their full length. At the same time the<br>
ribs 2 are easy to bend to allow the sliding device 7 to bend the easily. For this reason it can<br>
happen that as a result of the pressure of the water contained within, the first edge of the rib 2<br>
is located lower at certain places than at others, and so the water retained by it will seep down<br>
at this place onto the micro-terrace formed by the rib 2 below it. In unfavorable cases such<br>
seeping occur at the edge of the course, or are distributed unevenly along the width of the<br>
course, and thus, a small rivulet can form on the sliding surface 1. It is better if such an<br>
overflow is not caused by a slipover extending to the full length, but depressions 42 of smaller<br>
width are made intentionally, which form an overflow slit, and make the flow of the water to<br>
the water surface below 44 more even. Water passage bores 43 must be made on the ribs 2<br><br>
, too, which could have two roles. One of the roles is that they allow the draining of the water<br>
in case of cleaning or stoppage. The other role is that making such bores 43 subsequently or<br>
adjusting them can make the water flowmore even during operation.<br>
For the installatioss exposed to freezes in winter it is necessary to ensure the drainage of<br>
the water. For this purpose water passage bores 43 are formed at the lowest part of the water<br>
filled pond of the micro-terracss 10 and made after assembly are extremely suitable, as the<br>
bores located at the bottom of micro-terraces 10 can be considered as serially conneciing an<br>
upstream pond with a downstream pond, and thus the total loss of water can be limited to the<br>
water volume passing through all bores 43 located along a singe horizontal rib.<br>
Overflows can be formed on the top of the horizontal ribs. The overflows are small slits<br>
made in the material of the ribs, through which the water contained m the basin can drain<br>
away before reaching the lowest point of the upper edge of the horizontal rib. Their total<br>
cross-section is only slightly less than the flow cross-section of the freely flowing water, thus<br>
they cause swells within the micro-terraces. The water mass of the micro-terrace will start to<br>
dram away before the complete filling-up through the slipovers 42 and the water passages 43<br>
making streaming down of water more even. Their use is justified for large (especialyy wide)<br>
courses.<br>
It is a basic requirement for the vertical sectioning ribs 17 is that they must allow that the<br>
horizontal ribs to flexibly bend, while providing adequate water tightness after recovery. The<br>
sectioning or transverse elements cut to size at the assembly site can be made of the same<br>
material as the ribs 2 and screwed or pasted to the sliding surface 1 thereby these<br>
requirements are fully met. It is however necessary ensure that pasting involves only the<br>
sliding surface 1.<br>
Figure 9 shows a sliding surface where there are 2h ribs with grooves.<br>
Figure 10 shows a solution similar to that on Figure 7, where the covering sheet 5 is<br>
made of bands 15, but in this case the bands 15 are relatively narrow and there is a rib 16<br>
between two adjacent bands 15. Both the edge of the bands 15 and the root of the ribs 16 are<br>
equipped with conneciing elements. The ribs 16 have two connecting elemenss each and these<br>
each connects to a band 15 fastening two adjacent bands 15 together.<br>
In implementations where the surface is not even, and its geometry cannot be described<br>
by a cylinder-jacket due to nature or intentionall,, the use of long horizontal ribs is not<br>
satisfactory. In such cases systems made up of discrete micro-terraces 10 must be used<br>
(Figures 11, 12, 13), which basically represenss the version of the micro-terrace system<br>
broken into short elemental sections. Such other methods of forming micro-terraces are also<br>
possible, (Figure II) e.g. systems made up of discrete micro-terraces formed in a honeycomb<br><br>
. or rhomboidal (Figure 12), or slated (Figure 13) manner. In this way it is possible to construct<br>
courses of complex geometric design.<br>
Figure II shows a version where the ribs 2 are not rally horizontal. This means that the<br>
micro-terrace between the ribs also is not horizonaal. This howeve,, would be impossible, as<br>
the surface of the water 29 in the micro-terrace is always horizontal. Thus, in order to prevent<br>
lateral flow there are sectioning ribs 17 placed between two adjacent ribs 2, which can be<br>
identical to the ribs 17 closing the ends of the micro-terraces 10. As shown in the Figure it is<br>
preferred to locate the ribs 17 are not exactly below each other but in-laterally offset position.<br>
Tbis allows water to flow down from each micro-terrace 10 onto two downstream micro-<br>
terraces 10 positioned below it. Thus, overflow slit 42 and water passage bore 43 can be made<br>
separately in each micro-terrace 10 and even two overflow slits and two water passage bores<br>
can be made on each of them and even their size can be differen.. With a suitable adjustment<br>
of their number and size the uneven flow rates of the water can be compensated while or after<br>
installing the course.<br>
The micro-terraces 10 made by two crossing ribs 2 shown in Figure 12 are already<br>
equipped with defined overflow slit and thus, they need not be made. Here the water passage<br>
bores 43 provide opportuntty for adjustmen,, and they are the primary resourcss for solving<br>
unevenness. The water flow 19 running off from a micro-terrace 10 mainly stream only into<br>
another one of the micro-terracss 10.<br>
Figure 13 shows the sliding surface 1 made up of discrete covering elements. The<br>
covering element 27 comprises basically of a flat covering sheet 30 and a pond or basin 31<br>
made at its end. The covering element 27 must be placed in such a manner onto the slope that<br>
the basin 31 is at the bottom. The basin 31 is bordered by the covering element 30 and the 2v<br>
rib connected to the lower edge of the covering sheet 30, the basin 31 formed this way is<br>
closed on the sides by sectioning ribs 57. These covering elemenss 27 can simply be mounted<br>
individualyy onto the slope, for instance using additionally an underlay-plate 6, with the aid of<br>
screws or nails or other fastening elements, or adhesive or both. The placing of the covering<br>
elements 27 must start at the bottom of the slope with the same technique as for roofing, and<br>
continued upwards. The top covering element 27 must be placed on the covering element 27<br>
below in such a manner that the lateral juncture of adjacent covering elemenss 27 should be<br>
covered overlapped by the covering element 27 next above. In this overlappdd state water<br>
tightness can be achieved in a manner similar to roofing without any additional measure.. To<br>
have adequate water tightness the covering sheet 30 of the covering element 27 must be 2-3<br>
times longer than the length of the basin 31. These dimensions are understood along the<br>
direction of slope.<br><br>
Figure 14 shows a prefabricated covering sheet 5, where the multi-ribs 2<br>
come factory made. This can be with extrusion or line welding. The covering<br>
sheet 5 manufactured this way can be rolled-up in the form of a carpet since the<br>
material is flexible.<br>
This is a significantly simplified version, but due to the cost reduction<br>
effect, the combined rib 2/multi plays a non negligible role, because the covering<br>
sheet 5 and at least two pieces of horizontal ribs 2 are factory mounted, the<br>
micro-terraces being co-extruded from different quality materials onto a T shape<br>
or assembled separately and are manufactured in a single work phase with the<br>
covering sheet. The foot-type ribs must be pasted close together with an<br>
adhesive layer deposited onto their bottom surface (e.g. according to Figure 5<br>
with the adhesive layer shown for rib 2e) to the bolster prepared in advance (the<br>
precondition here is that the upper surface of the bottom bolster be suitable for<br>
pasting, i.e. equipped with a plastic sheet pasted to it), making this way a<br>
monolithic covering sheet 5 with horizontal rib 2. (See later the description of<br>
Figure 16). An additional advantage of using foot-type ribs is that in certain cases<br>
one of the foot-type ribs 2a-2f, 2h is suitable without any changes to perform the<br>
tasks of the vertical sectioning rib 17 (being perhaps cut to size at the site). The<br>
surface unevenness caused by the shoulders of the slope can easily be<br>
corrected with the longitudinal cut of the feet of the ribs or by leaving a spline-like<br>
indentation, and it is easy to set the ribs 2 as horizontal as possible.<br><br>
The sliding devices used for skiing can be used on the sliding course.<br>
Both ski and snowboard are suitable for sliding down if their slipperiness is<br>
adjusted and their very sharp steel edges made for snow are rounded down.<br>
To enjoy in full the possibilities inherent in the sliding course a sliding<br>
device similar to the snowboard developed specifically for the purpose can the<br>
used. The device fastening the feet of the user can be rather simple, or more<br>
complex, which enhances safety causing very little discomfort. Figure 15 shows<br>
a sliding device similar in design to the snowboard.. It can be used with special<br>
shoes 35, which protects the feet 37 of the user from bruises. The shoes 35 are<br>
similar to those used for surfing, skiing, snowboarding, but most of all to those<br>
used for roller-skating, and are made of aerated, strong, or even' completely<br>
rigid, water resistant material.<br>
There are bridles 34 on the sliding device 7 to accommodate the shoes<br>
35. The sliding device 7 can be a plane sheet by both the front and the end can<br>
be bent upwards to a small extent. Both longitudinal ends of the sliding device 7<br>
are suitably rounded. The edges of the sliding device 7 also can be rounded,<br>
excessive rounding however reduces direction control. If suitable material is<br>
used the edges can be made angular too.<br><br>
Figure 16 shows a sleigh like sliding device 38, which can accommodaee two people<br>
even; and is equipped with a gnp 40 to prevent falling down.<br>
It is possible to slide down alone or in groups with the sleight-tike board sliding device<br>
38. The sliding device has one or multiple layers, of a plastic, water resistant material, has a<br>
flat structuee resembling a flying saucer, and one or more persons can sit thereon. While<br>
sliding down, they can hold the gnp 40 and can control the direction of movement by the<br>
relocaiing their body weigh.. This sliding device 38 can be steered by extending feet just us in<br>
case of sliding down by a sleigh.<br>
A sleigh board can be braked with the aid of the breaks described for the rubber boat. As<br>
sliding device 38 is less steereable than sliding device 7, their simultaneous use in the sliding<br>
course is not recommended.<br>
An additionll possibility for group sliding is the special steereable rubber boat (Figures<br>
17 and 18). The difference in comparison to an inflatable plastic or rubber boat is that the<br>
bottom 51 is stiffened and is equipped longitudinally with ribs, and in stead of the oars,<br>
braking oars or members 46 can be mounted permanenlly or temporarily onto it. The braking<br>
oars can be in the front or in the back, and always the persons sitting in the boats are those<br>
who handle them. The braking oars can be moved separately from each other. If the persons<br>
in the boat press the oar on one side using the braking arm and push it against the sliding<br>
surface 1 the symmetry of the boat gets broken, its state of balance changes and a strong<br>
backward force develops turning the boat towards the braked side. The ribs made on the<br>
bottom of the boat ensure that the direction is kept, that is, that the boat move towards the<br>
direction of least resistance, and that moving in directions perpendicuarr to it is made harder.<br>
Figure 17 shows a sliding device 45 similar to a rubber boat. There is a pair of oars<br>
46affixed to one of its ends fastened with the aid of a fastening device 47. There is an arm 48<br>
linked to the oars 46 with the aid of which the oars 46 can be turned around the axis 49. When<br>
lifting the arm 48 the oar 46 is pressed against the sliding surface 1 and by exercising a break<br>
effect it serves to steer the sliding device. To improve steering, ribs should be made on the<br>
bottom of the sliding device 45.<br>
Figure 18 shows the version of the sliding device 45 made from a rubber boat, on the<br>
bottom of which there is a sheet 51 affixed with the aid of a rope 50. The sheet 51 is suitably<br>
shaped in the form of a tray ribbed on the bottom side. This sheet 51 can be affixed with the<br>
aid of the rope 50 to the rope eyelets 56 of the rubber boat serving as core fore the sliding<br>
device 45. The sliding device 45 is further equipped with oars 52 affixed in pairs, which are<br>
fastened to an. axle tube 54 through a brace.<br><br>
The sheet 51 that forms the rigid plastic sliding surface to be mounted on the bottom of<br>
the commercially available rubber boat is fastened to the eyelets on the sides of the boat with<br>
the rope 50 affixed to its side. The rudders on the two sides of the boat are linked by an axis<br>
49 passed through the rudder fastening axle tube placed into the oar ring of the boat where it<br>
can turn The boat side rudder fastening axle tube 54 cannot escape form the oar ring and thus<br>
it positions the rudders. The end of the axle tube opposite to the boat is affixed to the axis 49<br>
in a manner that makes turning possible. The rudder S5 is rigidly affixed to the axle tube 54<br>
(by welding or with separable connection) with a stiffening element or steel sheet. Its role is<br>
to make the plastic rudder resistant against the significant steering forces The rudders and<br>
braking arms are mounted on the axle tube at an angle at which in a stationary state the<br>
rudderl point upwards and the braking arms are pushed forward. When the braking arms are<br>
pulled back the rudders are pressed into the sliding surface I, they bend down the ribs 2<br>
creating significant friction. The user pulls one of the pair of braking arms 53 welded to the<br>
axle tube in accordance with the desired change of direction and as a result the rudders are<br>
pressed separately or for braking simultaneously against the sliding surface 1, where the<br>
created friction breaks the rudder changing the state of motion of the boat. The longitudinal<br>
ribs on the bottom of the boat stabilize the changed direction.<br>
With this additional fixtures the mass-produced rubber boats available commercially can<br>
be simply used.<br>
The physical principle of steered boat slide is based in a smaller part on the reaction force<br>
of the water, and in a greater part on the shape resistance of the ribs.<br>
One of'the special areas of utilization of the sliding surface I shown in Figure 19 is the<br>
mobile slide. This is an equipment resembling a conveyor belt, with the horizontal ribs 2 and<br>
the side sectioning ribs 17 forming the micro-terraces 10 being mounted onto a wide conveyor<br>
belt 63 (as wide as 3-20 meters). The conveyor belt 63 is driven by a driving motor 62 with a<br>
suitable gear, with the driving speed being variable to allow adjustment to the optimum speed.<br>
The conveyor belt 63 is dragged almost on its total width upon and along a stationary<br>
supporting surface 65 which provides support and ensures plane surface. The suppott surface<br>
65 can naturally be equipped with rollers to reduce friction. The lower end of the conveyor<br>
belt 63 is immersed under the water surface of the basin 4 and the micro-terraces' 10 get filled<br>
under the level of water in the basin 4 and moving together with the conveyor belt while<br>
carrying the water upwards. At the top of the course the micro-terraces 10 are emptied, tbe<br>
discharged water is collected and conducted back througb a water drain 64 directly into the<br>
basin 4 or onto the lower levels of the course. The users can access the course by stairs or<br>
ladder 59 and start from a launching pad 9 located at the top of the course. The water<br><br>
dislodged by the skier is constantly replaced as a result of the upward motion. The angle of<br>
the conveyor bett 63 can be adjusted with the aid of a hydrauiic cylinder/piston unit 61 and<br>
thereby the slope can be ~djusted to be steeper or milder verj quickly. The conveyor belt 63<br>
has a stable supporiing structure and can be placed on a foundaiion 60.<br>
If the adjustment is good the person sliding down on the sliding surface 1 will practically<br>
remain in the same level or place. The position of the person can be monitored with the help<br>
of suitable sensors, and if the person gets too close to the basin the operating speed of the<br>
driving motor 62 can be increased. If the person gets too high up, the speed of the driving<br>
motor 62 can be reduced. The same result can be achieved with the operaiion of<br>
cylinder/piston unit 61, that is by change the steepness of the sliding surface 1. This solution<br>
allows for a compact implementation in a relatively small area and also for training. With a<br>
proper design ski beginness can be trained.<br>
Figure 20 shows a version where the covering sheet 5 placed on the supporting surface<br>
201 has cavities 28. There are two cavities 28 made between two adjacent ribs 2, and two<br>
adjacent cavities 28 are separated by spacer rib 26. The spacer rib can be airtight or air<br>
permeable. With this structure it is possible to make inflatable sliding surface 23, the<br>
flexibility of which reduces significanlly the risk of bruises. There is an other inherent<br>
possibility, namely that with the use of airtight spacer rib 26 the pressure in the cavities 28<br>
located between two adjacent ribs 2 can be adjusted to different values and thus the angle of<br>
the ribs 2 can be adjusted between certain limits, allowing thereby adjustment of the<br>
characteristics of the sliding surface 23. A pillow is made from plastic foil with one or more<br>
air chambers or pockets an is placed to extend across the slope. The air pockess are made by<br>
the cavities 28 between which the ribs 2 are placed, which will occupy their working position<br>
after the air pockets are inflated forming then the micro-errraces 10. The bottom of the pillow<br>
can be affixed to the suppott surface 20 by pasting. This version is sensitive to damages but<br>
provides a soft surface.<br>
The invention has been described above and shown in the attached drawings on hand on<br>
preferred embodimenss of the solution according to the invention. Howeve,, based on these<br>
teachings and presentation person skilled in the art can develop numerous modifications and<br>
versions for the invention.<br><br>
