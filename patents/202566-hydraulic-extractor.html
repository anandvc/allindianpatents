This invention relates to a hydraulic extractor for removing the pandroll clip , particularly a heavy duty hydraulic extractor for removing extremely jammed pandroll clips and for unlocking the broken pandroll clip from the concrete sleeper of the rail track. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Over the years the railway track technology has undergone radial changes. The ordinary steel railway track has been replaced by high quality steel track having minimum wear and tear. The wooden sleeper has been replaced by concrete sleeper and pandroll clip has taken over in holding the rail onto the sleeper. The replacement of wooden sleeper with prestressed concrete sleepers and 13 meters rails with long welded rails (LWR) are the recent advancement of the railway track technology. In the present system, the rail is locked onto the concrete sleeper with the help of pandroll clip which catches the rail with a toe load of 720 kgs at a point. The pandroll clip is left to air and rain and thus gets rusted and welded due to the reason of tropical weather and also wrong maintenance, as per practice the clip should be greased at the interval of maximum six months, the maintenence procedure details that the clip is to be removed within six months of its use and and greased properly and then inserted and in consequence fastens the rail to the concrete sleeper, but for the conditions mentioned above it gets extremely jammed and rust welded to the insert before time.<br><br>
3.<br>
A pandroll clip is made of spring steel and is required to undergo a continuous movement inside the insert when the train passes. When the pandroll clip gets rust welded to the insert, it becomes difficult to remove the clip for its maintenance and further the conventional procedure of using a hammer for removing it, breaks at the point of the insert and also as it is found that the insert cemented to the concrete sleeper gets loosened because of the hammering and finally falls off. It becomes difficult to remove the broken clip for its replacement. This is usually done with the help of hammer and pointed punch. Hitherfore, the removal of broken/jammed pandroll clip has created problem and such removal procedure is only 5% effective for the removal procedure becomes dangerous as the insert would break and as a result the entire sleeper had to be replaced The entire procedure becomes cumbersome, time consuming and requires careful attention by skilled supervisor. Moreover, the removal of concrete sleeper of which insert has loosened/fallen off, needs planning and execution which is rather costly. Therefore there has been a demand for the removal of jammed/broken pandroll clip from the sleeper without damaging the sleepers and without infringing the movement of rail traffic. It has been the endeavour of all concerned in the railway track technology to avoid such disadvantages and to fabricate a device for the removal of the jammed pandroll clip in shortest possible time and the removal of the dammed pandroll clip in shortest<br><br>
4.<br>
possible time and the replacement of such pandroll clip, particularly when it gets broken inside the insert.1 The applicant has been able to invent a hydraulic extractor which is particularly meant for the removal of the jammed/broken pandroll clip from the concrete sleeper.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention lies with an alignment system with reference to the track/rail and concrete sleeper's insert and the reaction to the force applied to work in situ.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention of a hydraulic extractor is to remove the broken or jammed pandroll clip from concrete sleeper efficiently. overcoming the disadvantages mentioned above.<br>
Another object of the invention is to develop a noninfringing hydraulic which is particularly designed for the removal of jammed/broken pandroll clip from the railway sleepers in much shorter time and  thereby avoiding interference of the movement of rail traffic.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to adapt a hydraulic extractor which is designed to remove jammed pandroll clip from the insert in the railway concrete sleepers which is under heavy load at the toe and load point.<br><br>
5.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a hydraulic extractor for removing pandroll clip comprising a multiplier plate which is anchored to the reinforcing plate at an axis, said extractor is provided with a pair of anchoring lugs to clamp and hold on to the rail and a hydraulic unit is provided to actuate a piston ram to move said multiplier plate alongwith a screw ram which pushes the said pan droll clip out of the insert of the concrete sleeper.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the non-limiting examplarly embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Figure  1  shows  the assembly of the hydraulic  extractor Figure  2  A second embodiment of the Hydraulic extractor<br>
Figure  3  A third embodiment of the Hydraulic extractor.<br><br>
6. DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings, the complete unit is fitted into the track as illsutrated and anchoring lugs (2) holds the base of the rail (3) and the reinforing plate (25) which touches the side of the insert (5) of the concrete sleeper (4).<br>
Double flanged wheel (50) are provided for transporting the equipment using the mono rail i.e Rail (30). The Hydraulic extractor is pushed manually on it with the help of effort lever (10) which is screwed horizontally to the tension rod (40) housing the anchoring lugs (2) and on pushing the wheels (50) turn and cover the distance required. Further one wheel (50) Is insulated from the other so as not to trip the complex Rly signalling system using the rail (30) as a conductor. Further on the same axle of (3) of the double flanged wheel (50) nylon wheels (55) are provided at a distance such that they do not infringe the check Rails (not shown) adjoining the rail heads nor the Ballast or either ends for easy transport on cess and plain surface. The square alignment is done by nuts housed on the tension rod (40) by loosening and tightening them till perfect alignment is reached.<br><br>
7.<br>
The screw ram (8) face is butted on the face of the jammed pandroll clip (6) which is inside the insert (5) and then the effort lever (10) is moved up and down in the hydraulic unit, (11) to actuate the hydraulic force through piston ram (15) which in turn moves forward and tries to push the multiplier plate (20) which is anchored to the reinforcing plate (25) at an axis marked A. The screw ram (8) which is attached to the female nut (9) anchored to the multiplier plate (20) which transit the force on the basis of the clip (16) and as the pressure is increased of the movement of the effore lever (10), the jammed pandroll clip (6) gives away and it comes out of the insert (5).<br>
It has been found that the total force is working at a point D which touches the insert (5) and the turning movement is controlled by rail (3) base side which is in touch with the insert (5) of the concrete sleeper (4). As the rail (30) is firmly clamped to the insert (5) by the anchoring lugs (2) once the movement of the clip (6) is achieved the unit is opened by releasing the anchoring lugs (2). The applicant has found that the entire operation of the hydraulic extractor in removing a jammed pandroll clip does not take more than 10(ten) minutes.<br><br>
8.<br>
The embodiment as shown in figure 2	and three work on the<br>
same principle and identified with same	numerals for similar<br>
items of figure 1. The transport mode of	figure 3 is different<br>
and it is lifted and carried manually on or on a trolley to<br>
site of work.<br>
The invention described hereinabove	is in relation to a<br>
non-limiting embodiment and as defined	by the accompanying<br>
