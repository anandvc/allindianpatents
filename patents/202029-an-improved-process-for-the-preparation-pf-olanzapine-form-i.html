thiophene-3-carbonitrile, which on condensation with 2-fluoronitro benzene gave 2-(2-<br>
nitro anilino)-5-methyl thiophene-3-carbonitrile, which on reduction and cyclization with<br>
stannous chloride gave 4-AminO"2-methyl-10H-thieno[2,3-b][l,5] benzodiazepine<br>
hydrochloride.	The	4-Amino-2-methyl-10H-thieno[2,3-b] [ 1,5]benzodiazepine<br>
hydrochloride salt was condensed with N-Methylpiperazine in toluene and dimethyl sulphoxide to give Olanzapine which on crystallization in Acetonitrile to give Olanzapine (Pure).<br><br>

In the US patent no 5, 703, 232 the Form prepared has the same characteristic inter planar spacing by X-ray diffraction as the polymorph<br><br>
designated as Form-II in the US Patent no 5, 736, 541 and therefore should thus be considered same polymorph,<br>
US patent no 5, 637, 584 provides a methylene chloride crystalline solvate of 2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno [2,3-b][l,5]benzodiazepine (Olanzapine) and also provides a process for preparing anhydrous Form I using a methylene chloride solvate comprising drying such methylene chloride solvate and crystallizing the dried material in a solvate selected from the group consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons, C3-C9 ketones, C3-C9 branched alcohols, C3-C9 esters, C3-C9 hydrocarbons, C3-C9 ethers and cyclic ethers in the presence of Form I 2-methyl"4-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno [2,3-b][l,5] benzodiazepine.<br>
