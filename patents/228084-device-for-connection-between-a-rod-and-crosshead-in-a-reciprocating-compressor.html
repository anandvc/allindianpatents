				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to device for connection between a rod and crosshead in<br>
a reciprocating compressor.<br>
The most common type of reciprocating compressors consist of one or a plurality of<br>
cylinders inside which pistons provided with reciprocating motion slide.<br>
As far as the kinematic control mechanism for the reciprocating motion of the piston<br>
is concerned, reference is made by way of example to the kinematic mechanisms<br>
which consist of a connecting rod and crank or a connecting rod, crank and crosshead.<br>
The second type of transfer of reciprocating motion proposed is applied to machines<br>
which do not have a direct connection between the foot of the connecting rod and the<br>
piston, but require interposition of a stem or rod.<br>
However, the rod is not designed to withstand transverse forces and it is therefore<br>
necessary to provide at its articulation with the foot of the piston a straight guide<br>
which forces the centre of the articulation to move along the axis of the cylinder, con-<br>
stituted by the so-called crosshead.<br>
The crosshead consists of a body provided with a journal or pin for articulation with<br>
the connecting rod, and with runners, wherein the axis of the pin is at right-angles to<br>
the axis of the rod and of the runners, i.e. it is disposed in the shape of a cross relative<br>
to the latter.<br>
In general the runners are produced with a cylindrical surface made of cast iron or<br>
steel or light alloy, are integral with the body or added onto the latter and are covered<br>
with anti-friction metal. The runners slide in guides with a complementary cylindrical<br>
surface.<br>
In general the body is produced from cast iron, cast steel or forged steel.<br>
Hereinafter for the crosshead reference will be made by way of example to the con-<br>
figuration with a pin and two runners, which is designed for connection to drive shafts<br><br>
which can rotate in both directions, thus exchanging transverse forces with both the<br>
guides.<br>
At present the means for connection between the piston rod and the crosshead in a re-<br>
ciprocating compressor consist of common threaded units, i.e. they consist of a nut<br>
and a single lock nut.<br>
For correct fitting use is also made of elements to stop rotation, of the key type.<br>
In the fitting solutions generally used the means for connection between the rod and<br>
the crosshead, i.e. the nut and lock nut, abut supports, for example flanges, which are<br>
finally connected to the crosshead by means of tie rods.<br>
The tightening of the threaded units, such as to apply a predetermined load which as-<br>
sures the hold of these means for connection in use can be carried out manually for<br>
example, in the case of reciprocating compressors with low performance, or hydrauli-<br>
cally.<br>
The hydraulic tightening in the case of high-performance machines which must guar-<br>
antee maximum reliability and safety makes it possible to obtain better preloading and<br>
thus better hold of the connection between the rod and the crosshead.<br>
The hydraulic tightening of the means for connection between the rod and crosshead<br>
in reciprocating compressors is carried out for example by positioning the hydraulic<br>
jack on the rod, in the section between the nut and the lock nut, such as to abut be-<br>
tween the nut and the support, which in turn is secured to the crosshead.<br>
This solution is structurally more complicated, since corresponding holding means<br>
must be provided for the correct functioning of the hydraulic jack.<br>
The main disadvantage of the means for connection between the rod and crosshead in<br>
a reciprocating compressor such as those used at present relates to limitation of the<br>
load applicable to the rod during functioning. On the basis of the foregoing informa-<br>
tion this value is dependent on the nominal value of the preloading applied during fit-<br>
ting and above all on the extent of the relaxation once the tightening has been com-<br>
pleted, which is expressed in the form of a relaxation coefficient.<br>
In fact, in the present fitting solutions, in a reciprocating compressor the means for<br>
connection between the rod and the crosshead, i.e. the nut or lock nut, are not sub-<br><br>
jected to stress during the fitting step but only at the moment of release of the traction<br>
load applied in order to connect the rod to the crosshead. The coefficient of relaxation<br>
is therefore not optimised with these fitting solutions.<br>
In reciprocating compressors the means for connection between the rod and crosshead<br>
constitute a critical characteristic for the reliability and performance of the machine.<br>
The dynamic stresses induced by the cyclical load, which is characteristic of the func-<br>
tioning of reciprocating compressors, can limit the performance of these means for<br>
connection above all from the point of view of fatigue strength, which is characteristic<br>
of the reciprocating motion functioning system.<br>
The means for connection between the rod and crosshead of a reciprocating compres-<br>
sor used hitherto do not however constitute an optimised response in terms of per-<br>
formance of the machine.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide means for connection between the<br>
rod and crosshead in a reciprocating compressor which eliminate the above-described<br>
disadvantages.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide means for connection between<br>
the rod and crosshead in a reciprocating compressor which make it possible to obtain<br>
higher performance levels in terms of loads which can be applied to the rod for the<br>
same nominal preloading and type of thread of the nuts.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide means for connection between<br>
the rod and crosshead in a reciprocating compressor which are particularly simple and<br>
functional, with low costs.<br>
These objects according to the present invention are achieved by using means for<br>
connection between the rod and crosshead in a reciprocating compressor as described<br>
hereunder.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of means for connection between the rod and<br>
crosshead in a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention will be-<br>
come more apparent from the following description, provided by way of non-limiting<br>
example with reference to the attached schematic drawings, in which:<br><br>
figure 1 is a lateral elevated view partially in cross-section of a crosshead of a recip-<br>
rocating compressor on which a rod is fitted by means for connection, which are the<br>
subject of the present invention;<br>
figure 2 is a lateral view of figure 1, which shows a crosshead bearing a rod and<br>
means for connection, which are the subject of the present invention, partially in<br>
cross-section on different planes;<br>
figure 3 is a plan view partially in cross-section of figure 1; and<br>
figure 4 shows an enlarged detail of the means for connection between the rod and<br>
crosshead in a reciprocating compressor, which is the subject of the present invention.<br>
The figures show means for connection between the rod 12 and crosshead 13 in a re-<br>
ciprocating compressor, indicated as 10 as a whole, consisting substantially of<br>
threaded units, such as two lock nuts, an anti-rotational securing device and axial po-<br>
sitioning elements.<br>
The crosshead 13 shown in figures 1 to 3 consists of a body 14 and runners 15 with a<br>
cylindrical surface which slide in complementary guides 16. As shown in figure 2 the<br>
body of the crosshead 14 has a substantially hollow annular shape and is provided<br>
with a seat 17 to accommodate a pin 18, disposed with its axis 19 at right-angles to<br>
the direction of sliding X of the runners 15.<br>
The pin 18, which is provided with countersunk threaded holes 20, constitutes the<br>
point of articulation with the connecting rod, not shown in the figures.<br>
In the section in which it engages with the crosshead 13 the rod 12 has a countersunk<br>
threaded hole 2J, which is provided in a circular head surface 22 along an axis 23 of<br>
the rod, as shown in detail in figure 4.<br>
The rod 12 has a threaded end portion 24, a tapered section 25, a centring portion with<br>
a larger diameter 26 and finally, correspondingly connected to the latter, a stop sur-<br>
face 27 which is inclined by an angle a relative to the axis 23 of the rod.<br>
A conical ring 28 forms part of the axial positioning elements of the assembly consti-<br>
tuted by the rod and piston relative to the fixed parts of the cylinder.<br><br>
The positioning ring 28 has a frusto-conical mouth 29 which is complementary to the<br>
inclined stop surface 27 of the rod.<br>
A flange 30 constitutes a further axial positioning element and consists of a sleeve 31<br>
to contain the rod and lock nuts, which extends from a connection plate 32, provided<br>
with four holes 33 disposed in pairs on opposite sides.<br>
In the holes 33 there are engaged an equivalent number of tie rods 34, which are<br>
screwed onto the pin 18 accommodated in the body of the crosshead 14, in order to<br>
connect the flange 30 to the crosshead 13.<br>
The portion with a sleeve 31 of the flange 30 has an inner diameter which is equal to<br>
the maximum diameter of the centring portion 26 of the rod 12.<br>
At one end of the flange 30, on the inner diameter, there are provided cylindrical seats<br>
35, 36 against which there abut respectively a first inner lock nut 37 and a second<br>
outer lock nut 38.<br>
The first inner lock nut 37 consists of a cylindrical element with an elongate shape,<br>
provided with an inner thread 39 which extends along its entire length. Externally<br>
there are present three separate sections with an increasing diameter. A first cylindri-<br>
cal section with a smaller diameter 40 is followed by a first outer thread 41 with a<br>
larger diameter and finally a left-handed outer thread 42 with a maximum diameter.<br>
A lateral annular surface 43 of the first lock nut 37 is also provided with one or more<br>
holes 44 which co-operate with the anti-rotational securing element for the rod.<br>
On the inner surface of the second outer lock nut 38 there is present a thread 45, and<br>
on the other hand the outer surface has at one end a cylindrical section 46, in which<br>
there is provided a hole 47 for the intervention of the tightening means and a cylindri-<br>
cal section with a smaller diameter 48.<br>
The anti-rotational securing device consists of a ring nut 49 to secure the lock nuts 37<br>
and 38, which is provided with a hole 50 for the intervention of the tightening means,<br>
and in the inner diameter of which there is provided a left-handed thread 51. The ring<br>
nut 49 is provided with a thin end lip 52, which, when the rod 12 is fitted, is posi-<br>
tioned in the vicinity of a seat 53 provided in the flange 30, as shown in a detail in<br>
cross-section in figure 3.<br><br>
The anti-rotational securing device also comprises an element 54 to secure the rod<br>
which has a cylindrical end portion provided with a left-handed thread 55, a hole 56<br>
for the intervention of the tightening means and an outer limb 57. This outer limb 57<br>
is provided in the form of a circular ring consisting of a thinned wall, or alternatively<br>
it can be produced for example in the form of tabs disposed annularly.<br>
The anti-rotational securing device must assure a stable connection in conditions of<br>
use, by preventing the connected elements from becoming unscrewed from one an-<br>
other.<br>
The means for connection 10 between the rod 12 and the crosshead 13, which is the<br>
subject of the present invention, assure above all stable connection of the rod 12 to the<br>
flange 30, by means of the use of the double lock nut 37 and 38. These means thus as-<br>
sure connection of the flange 30 which is integral with the rod 12, to the body of the<br>
crosshead 14.<br>
Since the rod is connected to the piston, which is already fitted inside the cylinder, the<br>
conical positioning ring 28 is inserted on the free ends of the rod 12 until it abuts the<br>
corresponding inclined surface 27, as can be seen from the enlarged detail in figure 4.<br>
The conical ring 28, which is worked to the exact size during the initial fitting, serves<br>
the purpose of carrying out correct axial positioning in relation to the fixed parts of<br>
the cylinder of the unit constituted by the rod and piston.<br>
The flange 30 is thus inserted on the rod 12 until it abuts the conical ring 28, and also<br>
co-operates in carrying out the centring on the diameter of the rod.<br>
The second outer lock nut 38 is screwed entirely onto the outer thread 41 with a<br>
smaller diameter of the first inner lock nut 37. The inner thread 39 of this first lock<br>
nut 37 then engages with that of the end portion 24 of the rod 12.<br>
In this step the cylindrical sections with a smaller diameter 40 and 48 of the lock nuts<br>
37 and 38 are inserted at least partially in the respective cylindrical seats 35 and 36 in<br>
the flange 30. In this condition only the first inner lock nut 37 abuts the flange 30. On<br>
the other hand the second outer lock nut 38 will be made to abut the flange 30, within<br>
its circular seat 36, in the successive fitting steps.<br><br>
In order to tighten the means for connection between the rod 12 and the crosshead 13,<br>
the hydraulic jack is screwed onto the free section of the inner thread 39 of the first<br>
lock nut 37.<br>
Pumping the oil to the required pressure provides the correct pre-tensioning of the end<br>
24 of the rod 12 and deformation of the threads 39 of the first lock nut 37 engaged on<br>
the rod.<br>
Whilst keeping the oil pressure constant, the tightening of the second outer lock nut<br>
38 is completed until the lock nut abuts the seat 36 provided in the flange 30.<br>
When the pressure is released in order to remove the hydraulic jack from the lock nut<br>
37 there is reduced relaxation of the nominal preloading owing to the opposing thrust<br>
action exerted by the second lock<br>
nut 38.<br>
The extent of relaxation of the preloading is commonly expressed in the form of coef-<br>
ficient of relaxation.<br>
Finally, the application of the elements which constitute the anti-rotational securing<br>
device guarantees the maximum reliability in conditions of use, thus preventing loos-<br>
ening of the connection between the lock nuts.<br>
The securing ring nut 49 is screwed fully onto the outer left-handed thread 42 of the<br>
first lock nut 37. On completion of the operation the end lip 52 is folded inside the<br>
corresponding seat 53 provided in the flange 30, as shown in figure 3, such as to pre-<br>
vent relative rotation between the ring nut 49 and the lock nut 37 and thus to prevent<br>
the latter from becoming unscrewed or loosened in use.<br>
The securing ring nut 49 thus carries out the function of preventing possible loosening<br>
of the second lock nut 38 and thus also of the inner lock nut 37 which is integral with<br>
the latter, therefore rendering the lock nuts integral with the flange 30.<br>
Finally, the securing element for the rod 54 prevents relative rotation between the rod<br>
12 and the lock nut unit 37 and 38 unit relative to the flange 30, as previously de-<br>
scribed.<br><br>
The securing element for the rod 54 is screwed onto the left-handed thread of the<br>
countersunk hole 21 provided in the circular head surface 22 of the rod 12 itself.<br>
The outer limb 57 with a small thickness is thus folded into at least one hole 44 pres-<br>
ent in the lateral annular surface 43 of the first lock nut 37.<br>
As prescribed by the standards API618, the anti-rotational securing between the rod<br>
12 and flange 30, and consequently between the rod 12 and the crosshead body 14, is<br>
produced without using devices which are engaged in the highly preloaded section of<br>
the rod, such as centring keys. Since the rod is fatigue stressed, in fact the anti-<br>
rotational securing devices used hitherto jeopardise the intactness of the latter.<br>
The flange 30 is connected to the body of the crosshead 14 by means of fitting opera-<br>
tions which are known to persons skilled in the art, and are therefore listed only<br>
briefly.<br>
The flange 30 is connected to the body of the crosshead 14 by means of four tie rods<br>
34, which are screwed into the countersunk holes 20 in the pin 18 for articulation of<br>
the foot of the connecting rod, which pin is inserted in the seat 17 provided in the<br>
body of the crosshead 14.<br>
The four tie rods 34 are tightened by means of hydraulic jacks, simultaneously for<br>
each opposite pair of tie rods in the cross.<br>
The connection according to the present invention is also used for crossheads other<br>
than the type previously described.<br>
in use a plurality of devices therefore contribute towards assuring the hold of the<br>
threaded connections between the rod and the flange. As well as having anti-rotational<br>
securing elements which are provided with a left-handed thread, these securing ele-<br>
ments are also provided with thin limbs, which are folded inside holes in adjacent<br>
elements.<br>
The means for connection between the rod and crosshead of a reciprocating compres-<br>
sor, which is the subject of the present invention, have the advantage of minimising<br>
the decrease in preloading owing to the resilience of the parts concerned.<br><br>
By use of the means for connection which are the subject of the present invention, the<br>
common relaxation values, which in general are equal to 40-50% of the nominal pre-<br>
loading, are reduced to relaxation of 20-25% of the nominal load.<br>
The use of the means for connection between the rod and crosshead of reciprocating<br>
compressors, which is the subject of the present invention, thus makes it possible to<br>
obtain higher performance levels in terms of loads which can be applied to the rod for<br>
the same nominal preloading and type of thread of the nuts.<br>
During the fitting step the hydraulic jack advantageously acts on the inner thread of<br>
the inner lock nut, the threads of which are immediately deformed by the action ex-<br>
erted on them, and continue to be deformed even after the tightening pressure has<br>
been released, owing to the action of the second lock nut.<br>
In addition, the anti-rotational securing element of the rod, which assures the hold of<br>
the connection between the rod and flange, and consequently between the rod and the<br>
body of the crosshead, as required by the standards API618 fourth edition, has con-<br>
siderable advantages from the point of view of mechanical strength.<br>
In fact, elimination of the common anti-rotational securing devices, for example of the<br>
key type, which engage in a highly preloaded section of the rod, makes it possible to<br>
increase advantageously the fatigue strength of the rod.<br>
Numerous modifications and variations, all of which come within the scope of the in-<br>
vention, can be applied to the means for connection thus designed, between the rod<br>
and crosshead of a reciprocating compressor, which is the subject of the present in-<br>
vention; furthermore all the details can be replaced by technically equivalent ele-<br>
ments. In practice any materials and dimensions can be used, according to the techni-<br>
cal requirements.<br><br>
