				<td>Particle formation methods and their products<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to methods for preparing panicles of an<br>
ac-cive substance which have a layer of an additive, such as a<br>
taste masking additive, at the particle surfaces. The invention,<br>
also relates to the particulate products of such methods.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
There are a number of reasons why a particulars active substance<br>
(such as a drug) might need a protective barrier at the particle<br>
surfaces. The active substance may be physically or chemically<br>
unstable, or incompatible with another substance with which it<br>
needs to be formulated. It may need protection against, for<br>
example, moisture, light, oxygen or other chemicals. A surface<br>
coating may alternatively be needed to delay release of the<br>
active substance for a desired time period or until it reaches<br>
an appropriate site, or to target its delivery to such a site.<br>
Drugs intended for oral administration may need coatings to mask<br>
their flavour and render them more palatable to patients.<br>
To protect an active substance in this way, a protective<br>
additive needs to be coated onto the external surfaces of the<br>
active particles. Several methods are known for applying such<br>
coatings. Traditional pan or fluidised bed techniques apply a<br>
fluid coating directly to solid active particles.<br>
Alternatively, a thin film layer of a coating material may be<br>
deposited onto particle surfaces by adding the particles to a<br>
solution of the coating material and then removing the solvent,<br>
for instance by evaporation, spray drying or freeze drying.<br>
Plasticisers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), may be added to<br>
the solution, to enhance coating flexibility and surface<br>
adhesion. This technique is widely used in the pharmaceutical<br>
industry to coat solid drug dosage forms such as tablets,<br>
granules and powders.<br>
With changing trends in drug delivery, there is a growing need<br>
for direct coating of drug particles, especially fine particles.<br>
Traditional coating methods, as described above, involve several<br>
stages such as crystallising, harvesting, drying, milling and<br>
sieving of the drug to obtain particles of the desired size<br>
range, and a subsequent, separate, coating step. This increases<br>
the risks of product loss and contamination.<br>
The coating of microfine particles, for instance in the range<br>
0.5-100 µm, has often proved particularly problematic due to the<br>
large surface area of the particles and the non-uniform, often<br>
incomplete, coatings achieved using traditional pan or fluidised<br>
bed coating techniques. Problems can be particularly acute if<br>
the particles are irregular in shape. If the material to be<br>
coated is water soluble, organic solvents are needed for the<br>
coating solution, which can lead to toxicity, flammability<br>
and/or environmental problems. The coatings achieved can often<br>
cause problems such as increased particle aggregation and<br>
increased residual solvent levels, which in turn can have<br>
detrimental effects on downstream processing.<br>
In the particular case of taste masking coatings, the need for a<br>
continuous and uniform coating layer is particularly great,<br>
since any discontinuity in the coating, allowing release of even<br>
the smallest amount of a poor tasting active substance, is<br>
readily detectable. Thus, the above described problems with<br>
prior art coating techniques assume even greater significance in<br>
the case of taste masking.<br>
Recent developments in the formation of particulate active<br>
substances include processes using supercritical or near-<br>
critical fluids as anti-solvents to precipitate the active<br>
substance from solution or suspension. One such technique is<br>
known as SEDS™ ("Solution Enhanced Dispersion by Supercritical<br>
fluids"), which is described in WO-95/01221 and, in various<br>
modified forms, in WO-96/00610, WO-98/36a25, WO-99/44733, WO-<br>
99/59710, WO-01/03821 and WO-01/15664. The literature on SEDS™<br>
refers to the possibility of coating fine particles, starting<br>
with a suspension of the particles in a solution of the coating<br>
material (see in particular WO-96/00610, page 20 line 28 - page<br>
21 line 2, also WO-95/01221 Example 5). However, again the<br>
particles must be prepared beforehand and coated in a separate<br>
step.<br>
Distinct from the coating of particulate actives, it is also<br>
known to mix active substances such as drugs with, excipients<br>
(typically polymers) which serve as carriers, fillers and/or<br>
solubility modifiers. For this purpose the active substance and<br>
excipient are ideally coformulated to yield an intimate and<br>
homogeneous mixture of the two. Known techniques include co-<br>
precipitation of both the active and the excipient from a<br>
solvent system containing both. The SEDSTM process may also be<br>
used to coformulate in this way, as described for instance in<br>
WO-95/01221 (Examples 10 and16), WO-01/03821 (Examples 1-4) and<br>
WO-01/15664.<br>
The products of coformulation processes are generally intimate<br>
mixtures of the species precipitated, for instance a solid<br>
dispersion of a drug within a polymer matrix. This is<br>
particularly the case for the products of a very rapid particle<br>
formation process such as SEDSTM (see the above literature).<br>
Indeed, because prior art coformulations have for the most part<br>
been motivated by the need to modify the dissolution rate of an<br>
active substance, they have concentrated fas in WO-01/15664) on<br>
obtaining truly homogeneous mixtures of the active and<br>
excipient(s), with the active preferably in its mere soluble<br>
amorphous, as opposed to crystalline, state.<br>
Whilst such a high degree of mixing is desirable for many<br>
products, it is clearly not appropriate where the additive is a<br>
surface protector or taste masking agent, since it leaves at<br>
least some of the active substance exposed at the particle<br>
surfaces, whilst "tying up" a significant proportion of the<br>
additive within the particle core. In the case of an<br>
unpleasant-tasting drug, even very tiny amounts at the particle<br>
surfaces can be sufficient to stimulate the taste buds, despite<br>
the additional presence of a taste masking agent.<br>
Where such prior art formulations failed to. achieve a completely<br>
homogeneous dispersion of the active in the excipient, for<br>
instance at higher active loadings, SEM analysis suggested that<br>
they contained domains of purely crystalline, excipient-free<br>
active substance. These domains would be expected to be<br>
surrounded by a second phase containing a homogeneous mixture of<br>
the remaining active and the excipient. This too would be<br>
highly undesirable for taste-masked or otherwise surfaca-<br>
protected systems; at least some of the active would still be<br>
present at the particle surfaces. For this reason,<br>
active/excipient coformulation has tended to be used for systems<br>
containing lower active loadings, in order to achieve intimate<br>
homogeneous mixtures of the active (preferably in its amorphous<br>
phase) and the excipient. Alternative techniques, using<br>
physically distinct active and excipient phases, have been used<br>
to achieve coating of actives, especially at relatively high<br>
active:excipient ratios.<br>
Thus coformulation, in particular via SEDS™ as in WO-01/15664,<br>
has not previously been used to coat active substances with<br>
protective agents such as taste maskers.<br>
Statements of the invention<br>
It has now surprisingly been found, however, that the SEDS™<br>
process can be used to prepare a particulate coformulation of an<br>
active substance and an additive, generally a protective<br>
additive, in which the active substance is sufficiently-<br>
protected, at the particle surfaces, for the process to be of<br>
use in preparing taste masked or otherwise surface-protected<br>
drugs. The process can generate particles in which the active<br>
substance:additive concentration ratio varies across their<br>
radius, the surface having a sufficiently high additive<br>
concentration to "protect" (which includes masking) the active<br>
substance, but the core of the particle containing a<br>
significantly higher concentration of the active. Thus,<br>
although the particles are not strictly "coated", ie, they<br>
generally possess no distinct physical boundary between a core<br>
and a coating layer, nevertheless they can behave as though<br>
coated.<br>
In this way, SEDS™ can provide an extremely advantageous method<br>
for "coating" and protecting active substances. The SEDSTM<br>
process, as discussed in WO-95/01221 and the other documents<br>
listed above, can bring with it a number of general advantages,<br>
such as environmental friendliness, versatility and an extremely<br>
high degree of control over the physicochemical properties<br>
(particle size and morphology, for example) of the product. It<br>
also allows the single-step production of multi-component<br>
products.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is<br>
therefore provided a method for preparing particles of an active<br>
substance having a layer of an additive at the particle<br>
surfaces, the method involving dissolving both the active<br>
substance and the additive in a vehicle to form a target<br>
solution, and contacting the target solution with an anti-<br>
solvent fluid using a SEDS™ particle formation process, to cause<br>
the active substance and additive tc ccprecipitate.<br>
In the following description, unless otherwise stated,<br>
references to the crystallinity, morphology, particle growth<br>
rate, solubility and miscibility of a material refer to the<br>
relevant properties under the operating conditions (for example,<br>
pressure, temperature, nature of reagents) used for the particle<br>
formation step.<br>
By "active substance" is meant a substance capable of performing<br>
seme useful function in an end product, whether pharmaceutical,<br>
nutritional, herbicidal, pesticidal or whatever. The term is<br>
intended to embrace substances whose function is as a carrier,<br>
diluent or bulking agent for the additive (for instance, in food<br>
products, a polymer such as a cellulosic polymer may be coated<br>
with a pleasant tasting additive such as a sugar, to yield a<br>
product having the desired flavour but with a reduced additive<br>
concentration).<br>
The active substance may be a single active substance or a<br>
mixture of two or more. It may be monomeric, oligomeric or<br>
polymeric, organic (including organometallic) or inorganic,<br>
hydrophilic or hydrophobic. It may be a small molecule, for<br>
instance a synthetic drug like paracetamol, or a larger molecule<br>
such as a (poly)peptide, an enzyme, an antigen or other<br>
biological material. It is typically (although not necessarily)<br>
c---stalline or semi-crystalline, preferably crystalline, by<br>
wchich is meant that it is capable of existing in a crystalline<br>
form under the chosen operating conditions.<br>
The active substance preferably comprises a pharmaceutically<br>
active substance, although many other active substances,<br>
whatever their intended function (for instance, herbicides,<br>
pesticides, foodstuffs, nutriceuticals, dyes, perfumes,<br>
cosmetics, detergents, etc.), may be coformulated with<br>
additives in accordance with the invention.<br>
In particular the active substance may be a material (such as a<br>
drug) intended for consumption, which has an unpleasant taste<br>
and/or odour and needs to be coated with a taste masking agent.<br>
Examples include the bitter tasting anti-malarial drugs quinine<br>
sulphate and chloroquine; many oral corticosteroids such as are<br>
used for asthma treatment; many antibiotics; Dicyclomine HCl<br>
(anti-spasmodic); dipyridamole (platelet inhibitor); Toprimate<br>
(anti-epileptic); Oxycodone (analgesic); Carispodol (used in the<br>
treatment of hyperactivity of skeletal muscles); Bupropion<br>
(anti-depressant) ; Sumatripan (useci in migraine treatment) ;<br>
Verapamil HCl (calcium ion flux inhibitor); Tinidazole (anti-<br>
parasitic) ; acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin, anti-pyretic);<br>
Cimetidine HCl (used in the treatment of acid/peptic disorders) ;<br>
Diltiazem HCl (anti-anginal); theophylline; paracetamol; and<br>
Orphenadrine citrate (anti-muscarinic). Clearly this list is<br>
net exhaustive.<br>
The active substance may be a material which requires a<br>
protective coating because it is sensitive to heat, light,<br>
moisture, oxygen, chemical contaminants or other environmental<br>
influences, or because of its incompatibility with other<br>
materials with which it has to be stored or processed.<br>
Active substance instability can be a particularly acute problem<br>
in the case of Pharmaceuticals", since degradation can lead not<br>
only to a reduction in the active substance concentration or its<br>
bioavailability, but also in cases to the generation of toxic<br>
products and/or to an undesirable change in physical form or<br>
appearance. The most common reasons for degradation of drug<br>
substances exposed to atmospheric stresses are oxidation,<br>
hydrolysis and photochemical decomposition.<br>
Actives susceptible to hydrolysis typically contain one or more<br>
of the following functional groups: amides (eg, as in dibucaine,<br>
benzyl penicillin, sodium chloramphenicol and ergometrine);<br>
esters (eg, as in procaine, tetracaine, methyladopate and<br>
physostigmine); lactams (eg, as in cephalosporin, nitrazepam and<br>
chlorodiazeproxide); lactones (eg, as in pilocarpine and<br>
spironolactone); oximes (eg, as in steroid oximes); imides (eg,<br>
as in glutethimide and ethosuximide) ; malonic urease (eg, as in<br>
barbiturates); and nitrogen mustards (eg, as in melphalan).<br>
Actives that undergo photochemical decomposition include<br>
hydrocortisone, prednisolone, some vitamins such as ascorbic<br>
acid (vitamin C) , phenothiazine and folic acid. Those that can<br>
be affected, by oxidative degradation, often under ambient<br>
conditions, include morphine, dopamine, adrenaline, steroids,<br>
antibiotics and vitamins.<br>
In some cases, however, it may be preferred for the active<br>
substance not to be ascorbic acid.<br>
The additive may also be a single substance or a mixture of two<br>
or more, and may be mcnomeric, oligomeric or polymeric<br>
(typically either oiigomeric or polymeric). It may be organic<br>
(including organometallic) or inorganic, hydrophilic or<br>
hydrophobic. It is typically a substance capable of protecting<br>
an active substance from external effects such as heat, light,<br>
moisture, oxygen or chemical contaminants, and/or of reducing<br>
incompatibilities between the active substance and another<br>
material with which it needs to be processed or stored, and/or<br>
of delaying, slowing or targetting the release of the active<br>
substance (for instance, for drug delivery systems), and/or of<br>
masking the flavour and/or odour of an active substance, when<br>
applied to the surface of the active substance. It is<br>
preferably non-toxic and pharmaceuticaily acceptable. In<br>
particular it may be a hydrophobic polymer such as an ethyl<br>
cellulose.<br>
The additive may in particular be a taste and/or odour masking<br>
agent, in which case it should be a flavour and odour-free, or<br>
at least a pleasant tasting and smelling material, preferably<br>
hydrophobic, which is not significantly degraded by saliva<br>
during the typical residence times of a consumable product, such<br>
as a drug or foodstuff, in a consumer"s mouth. Water insoluble<br>
polymers are particularly suitable as taste masking agents.<br>
Instead or in addition, the function of the additive may be to<br>
delay release of the active substance and/or to target its<br>
delivery to a predetermined site or reagent species. This is of<br>
particular use when the active substance is a pharmaceutical<br>
(for example, drug delivery can be targetted to the intestines<br>
and colon using a coating which is insoluble in gastric fluids),<br>
but may also be necessary for instance to delay the onset of a<br>
chemical reaction involving the active substance.<br>
In some cases, the additive may itself be an "active" (eg,<br>
pharmaceutically active) substance, for instance where two or<br>
more drugs are to be co-administered but one must be released<br>
before another.<br>
Examples of pharmaceuticaliy acceptable additives include<br>
celluloses and cellulose derivatives (eg, ethyl cellulose<br>
(hydrophobic coating agent) , hydroxyethyl cellulose (commonly<br>
used for tablet coatings), hydroxypropyl cellulose and<br>
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose") ; polymers incorporating<br>
phthalate groups, such as hydroxypropyl methyl phthalate (used<br>
as an enteric coating for tablets and granules); acrylates and<br>
methacrylates, such as the polymethyl acrylates and<br>
methacrylates available as Eudragit™; polyoxyalkylenes, such as<br>
polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene and their copolymers which are<br>
available for instance as Poioxamer™, Pluronic™ and Lutrol™;<br>
vinyl polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol; homo- and co-polymers<br>
of hydroxy acids such as lactic and glycolic acids; and mixtures<br>
thereof. These are all amorphous or, in the case of<br>
(co)polymers incorporating lactic acid, semi-crystalline.<br>
Other commonly used coating additives include naturally<br>
occurring gums such as shellac, and many lipidic materials,<br>
examples being lecithin, waxes such as carnauba wax and<br>
microcrystalline wax, and phospholipids such as DPPC<br>
(dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline) . The additive may be or<br>
contain flavourings, including sugars and sweeteners. Again,<br>
these lists are by no means exhaustive.<br>
Preferred additives are those which are amorphous or semi-<br>
crystalline, most preferably amorphous, in nature. Suitably the<br>
additive is oligomeric or polymeric; most preferably it is a<br>
polymeric material. It also preferably has film forming<br>
capabilities, under the operating conditions used; polymers<br>
known to have such capabilities include ethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose.<br>
It may in cases, in particular where the active substance is<br>
crystalline or semi-crystalline, be unsuitable for the additive<br>
to be poly vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), since this is known to<br>
inhibit crystallisation and may lead to a homogeneous, amorphous<br>
active/additive dispersion rather than a "coatsd"-type system.<br>
In some cases it may be preferred for the additive not to be a<br>
cationic polymer or copolymer, in particular not a cationic<br>
copolymer synthesised from acrylates and/or methacryiates such<br>
as from dimethylamincethyl methacrylate and neutral methacrylic<br>
acid esters.<br>
In certain cases it may be preferred for the additive not to be<br>
a homo- or co-polymer of hydroxy acids such as lactic and<br>
glycolic acids, in particular not to be poly(glycolic acid).<br>
It may also be unsuitable, if the active substance is<br>
paracetamol, theophylline or ascorbic acid, in particular<br>
ascorbic acid, for the additive to be a hydrophobic polymer, in<br>
particular ethyl cellulose. If the active substance is<br>
ketoprcfen, it may be unsuitable for the additive to be<br>
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose.<br>
The active substance and/or the additive may be formed from an<br>
in situ reaction (ie, a reaction carried out immediately prior<br>
to, or on, contact with the anti-solvent fluid) between two or<br>
more reactant substances each carried by an appropriate vehicle.<br>
The vehicle is a fluid capable of dissolving both the active<br>
substance and the additive, the solubility of the active<br>
substance and the additive in the vehicle being preferably C.5 -<br>
40 % w/v, more preferably 1 - 20 % w/v or 1 - 10 % w/v. In<br>
particular, the vehicle should form, with the active and the<br>
additive, a single-phase solution rather than for instance an<br>
emulsion or other form of colloidal dispersion.<br>
The concentration of -he additive in the target solution is<br>
suitably (particularly in the case of a polymeric additive) 10 %<br>
w/v or less, more suitably 5 % w/v or less, such as between 1<br>
and 2 % w/v.<br>
The vehicle must be miscible with the anti-solvent fluid, under<br>
the operating conditions used to carry cut the SEDS™ process.<br>
(By "miscibie" is meant that the two fluids are miscibie in all<br>
proportions, and/or that they can mix sufficiently well, under<br>
the operating conditions used, as to achieve the same or a<br>
similar effect, ie, dissolution of the fluids in one another and<br>
precipitation of the active substance and additive.) The<br>
vehicle and anti-solvent are preferably totally miscibie in all<br>
proportions, again under the operating conditions at the point<br>
of vehicle/anti-soivent contact.<br>
The term "vehicle" includes a single fluid or a mixture of two<br>
or more fluids, which are typically liquids but may be, for<br>
instance, supercritical or near-critical fluids. The fluids may<br>
be organic solvents or aqueous. In the case of a vehicle<br>
comprising two or more fluids, the overall mixture should have<br>
the necessary solubility and miscibility characteristics vis-a-<br>
via the active substance, the additive and the anti-solvent<br>
fluid.<br>
The vehicle or its component fluids may contain, in solution or<br>
suspension, other materials apart from the active substance and<br>
additive.<br>
The selection of an appropriate vehicle depends on the active<br>
substance, the additive and the anti-solvent fluid as well as on<br>
the chosen operating conditions (including pressure, temperature<br>
and fluid flow rates). 5ased on the above guidelines as to the<br>
miscibility and solubility characteristics of the fluids<br>
involved, the skilled person would be well able to select<br>
suitable materials with which to carry out the method of the<br>
invention.<br>
When the vehicle is composed of two or more fluids, for instance<br>
an organic solvent with a minor amount of a co-solvent<br>
"modifier", or a water/organic solvent mixture, the two or more<br>
fluids may be mixed, so as to form the target solution, in situ,<br>
ie, at or immediately before the target solution contacts the<br>
anti-solvent fluid and particle formation occurs. Thus, in one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the active substance is dissolved<br>
in a first fluid and the additive in a second fluid, and the<br>
first and second fluids are mixed, so as to form the target<br>
solution, at or immediately before the target solution contacts<br>
the anti-solvent fluid and precipitation occurs.<br>
Ideally this mixing of the vehicle fluids occurs at the outlet<br>
of a nozzle used to co-introduce the fluids into a particle<br>
formation vessel. For example, a first fluid in which the<br>
active substance is dissolved may be introduced through one<br>
passage of a multi-passage coaxial nozzle as described in WO-<br>
96/00610 (Figures 3 and 4) or WO-01/02821 (Figure 4). A second<br>
fluid, in which the additive is dissolved, may be introduced<br>
through another passage of the nozzle. The nozzle passage<br>
outlets may be arranged to terminate adjacent one another at the<br>
entrance to the particle formation vessel, in a way that allows<br>
the two fluids to meet and mix inside the nozzle, immediately<br>
before coming into contact with an anti-solvent fluid introduced<br>
through another nozzle passage. Both fluids will be extracted<br>
together into the anti-solvent fluid, resulting in<br>
coprecipitation of the active substance and the additive. For<br>
this to work, at least one of the vehicle fluids should be<br>
miscibie, or substantially so, with the anti-solvent fluid.<br>
Ideally, although not necessarily (as described in WO-01/03821),<br>
the two vehicle fluids should be miscibie or substantially<br>
miscibie with one another.<br>
Such in situ mixing of vehicle fluids may be particularly useful<br>
if there is no readily available common solvent for the active<br>
substance and the additive (for instance, when one material is<br>
organic and the other inorganic), or if the active substance and<br>
additive solutions are in some way incompatible, for instance if<br>
the active and additive would form an unstable solution mixture<br>
in a common solvent.<br>
The anti-solvent fluid is a fluid, or a mixture of fluids, in<br>
which both the active substance and the additive are for all<br>
practical purposes (in particular, under the chosen operating<br>
conditions and taking into account any fluid modifiers present)<br>
insoluble or substantially insoluble. By "insoluble" is meant<br>
that the anti-solvent cannot, at the point where it extracts the<br>
vehicle, extract or dissolve the active substance or additive as<br>
particles are formed. Preferably the active substance and the<br>
additive are less than 10-5 mole %, more preferably less than 10-<br>
7 mole % or less than 10-8 mole %, soluble in the anti-solvent<br>
fluid.<br>
The anti-solvent fluid should be a supercritical or near-<br>
critical fluid under the operating conditions used. By<br>
"supercritical fluid" is meant a fluid at or above its critical<br>
pressure (Pc) and critical temperature (Tc) simultaneously. In<br>
practice, the pressure of the fluid is likely to be in the range<br>
(1.01 - 9.0)Pc, preferably (1.01 - 7.0) Pc, and its temperature in<br>
the range (1.01 - 4.0)Tc (where Tc is measured in Kelvin) .<br>
However, some fluids (eg, helium and neon) have particularly low<br>
critical pressures and temperatures, and may need to be used<br>
under operating conditions well in excess of (such as up to 200<br>
times) those critical values.<br>
The term "near-critical fluid" encompasses both high pressure<br>
liquids, which are fluids at or above their critical pressure<br>
but below (although preferably close to) their critical<br>
temperature, and dense vapours, which are fluids at or above<br>
their critical temperature but below (although preferably close<br>
to) their critical pressure.<br>
By way of example, a high pressure liquid might have a pressure<br>
between about 1.01 and 9 times its PC, and a temperature between<br>
about 0.5 and 0.99 times its Tc, preferably between 0.8 and 0.99<br>
times its Tc. A dense vapour mighx, correspondingly, have a<br>
pressure between about 0.5 and 0.99 times its Pc (preferably<br>
between 0.8 and 0.99 times), and a temperature between about<br>
1.01 and 4 times its Tc.<br>
The anti-solvent is preferably a supercritical fluid such as<br>
supercritical carbon dioxide, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, sulphur<br>
hexafiuoride, xenon, ethane, ethylene, chlorotrifluoromethane,<br>
chlorodifluoromethane, dichloromethane, trifiuoromethane or a<br>
noble gas such as helium or neon, or a supercritical mixture of<br>
any of these. Most preferably it is supercritical carbon<br>
dioxide, ideally on its own rather than in admixture with other<br>
fluids such as supercritical nitrogen.<br>
When carrying out the present invention using a supercritical or<br>
near-critical fluid anti-solvent, the operating conditions must<br>
generally be such that the solution which is formed when the<br>
anti-solvent extracts the vehicle remains in the<br>
supercritical/near-critical form during the particle formation<br>
step. This supercritical/near-critical solution should<br>
therefore be above the Tc and Pc of the vehicle/anti-solvent<br>
mixture. This generally means that at least one of its<br>
constituent fluids (usually the anti-solvent fluid, which in<br>
general will be the major constituent of the mixture) should be<br>
in a supercritical or near-critical state at the time of<br>
particle formation. There should at that time be a single-phase<br>
mixture of the vehicle and the anti-solvent fluid, otherwise the<br>
particulate product might be distributed between two or more<br>
fluid phases, in some of which it might be able to redissolve.<br>
This is why the anti-scivent fluid needs to be miscible or<br>
substantially miscibie with the vehicle.<br>
The anti-solvent fluid may contain one or more modifiers, for<br>
example water, methanol, ethane 1, isopropanol or acetone. A<br>
modifier (or co-solvent) may be described as a chemical which,<br>
when added to a fluid such as a supercritical or near-critical<br>
fluid, changes the intrinsic properties of that fluid in or<br>
around its critical point, in particular its ability to dissolve<br>
other materials. When used, a modifier preferably constitutes<br>
not more than 40 mole %, more preferably not more than 20 mole<br>
%, and most preferably between 1 and 10 mole %, of the anti-<br>
solvent fluid.<br>
The anti-solvent flow rate will generally be chosen to ensure an<br>
excess of the anti-solvent over the target solution when the<br>
fluids come into contact, to minimise the risk of the vehicle<br>
re-dissolving and/or agglomerating the particles formed. At the<br>
point of its extraction the vehicle may typically constitute 80<br>
mole % or less, preferably 50 mole % or less or 30 mole % or<br>
less, more preferably 20 mole % or less and most preferably 5<br>
mole % or less, of the fluid mixture formed.<br>
By "a SEDS™ particle formation process" is meant a process as<br>
described in WO-95/01221, WO-96/00610, WO-98/36825, WO-99/44733,<br>
WO-99/59710, WO-01/03821 and/or WO-01/15664, in which a<br>
supercritical or near-critical fluid anti-solvent is used<br>
simultaneously both to disperse, and to extract a fluid vehicle<br>
from, a solution or suspension of a target substance. Such a<br>
technique can provide better, and more consistent, control over<br>
the physicochemicai properties of the product (particle size and<br>
size distribution, particle morphology, etc..) than has proved<br>
possible for coformulations in the past.<br>
The simultaneous vehicle dispersion and extraction are<br>
preferably achieved by co-introducing the fluids into a particle<br>
formation vessel in such a way that the anti-solvent and the<br>
target solution both enter the vessel at the same point, which<br>
is substantially the same as the point where they meet and at<br>
which particle formation occurs. This is suitably achieved<br>
using a fluid inlet nozzle having two or more coaxial,<br>
concentric passages such as is shown in Figs 3 and 4 of WO-<br>
95/01221.<br>
3ecause the present invention is a modified version of those<br>
disclosed in the above listed patent publications, technical<br>
features of the processes described in those documents can apply<br>
also to the present invention. The earlier documents are<br>
therefore intended to be read together with the present<br>
application.<br>
The concentration of the active substance and the additive in<br>
the target solution must be chosen to give the desired<br>
active:additive ratio in the final product. In the case of a<br>
crystalline or semi-crystalline active substance, it is<br>
preferred that their relative concentrations be such that the<br>
active is able to precipitate in a crystalline form under the<br>
operating conditions used (with some additives, in particular<br>
polymeric excipients, most particularly semi-crystalline and/or<br>
amorphous polymers, too high an additive level can force the<br>
active to precipitate in an amorphous form homogeneously .<br>
dispersed throughout a "matrix" of the additive, with no outer<br>
coating). At the same time, the relative active and additive<br>
concentrations when carrying out the present invention are<br>
preferably such that there is sufficient additive to generate, an<br>
additive-rich, preferably active-free or substantially so, layer<br>
at the particle surface (too low an additive level could be<br>
insufficient to achieve "coating" of ail particles).<br>
The additive level in the coprecipitated particles may be up to<br>
50, 60, 70 or even 80 % w/w. However, particularly preferred<br>
are relatively low levels of the additive, for instance 4 5 % w/w<br>
or less, preferably 40 % w/w or less, more preferably 30 % w/w<br>
or less, most preferably 25 % or 20 % or 15 % or 10 % or 5 % w/w<br>
or less. The active substance level is therefore,<br>
correspondingly, preferably 55 % w/w or greater, more preferably<br>
60 % w/w or greater, most preferably 70 % or 75 % or 80 % or 85<br>
% or 90 % or 95 % w/w or greater.<br>
However, too low an additive concentration can be insufficient<br>
to form a protective surface layer around the active-rich<br>
particle core. The additive level may therefore be preferred to<br>
be at least 1 %, preferably at least 2 %, more preferably at<br>
least 5 %, most preferably at least 10 % or 20 % w/w. For a<br>
taste masking additive, the level may be preferred to be at<br>
least 10 % w/w, preferably at least 15 % w/w, more preferably at<br>
least 20 % or 25 % or 30 % or 40 % w/w, of the overall<br>
composition. The amount needed for effective coating will.<br>
depend to an extent on the size of the particles to be formed -<br>
smaller particles will have a higher surface area and thus<br>
require correspondingly higher additive levels.<br>
Thus, preferred additive concentrations might be between 1 and<br>
45 % w/w, more preferably between 5 and 45 % w/w, most<br>
preferably between 10 and 40 % w/w or between 15 and 35 % w/w.<br>
An appropriate active:additive concentration ratio will usually<br>
manifest itself by a reduction in the crystallinity of a<br>
crystalline/semi-crystalline active substance, when coformulated<br>
in accordance with the invention, compared to its pure form,<br>
although not reduction to a completely amorphous phase. The<br>
ratio is preferably such that in the product coformulation, a<br>
crystalline or semi-crystalline active substance demonstrates<br>
between 20 and 95 %, preferably between 50 and 90 %, more<br>
preferably between 60 and 90 % crystallinity as compared to the<br>
active smarting material. This indicates a degree of<br>
active/additive interaction, but not a truly intimate solid<br>
dispersion.<br>
It is thus possible to test for an appropriate active:additive<br>
concentration ratio, for a system containing a crystalline or<br>
semi-crystalline active substance, by preparing a range of<br>
samples with different ratios and identifying an upper limit in<br>
the additive concentration, above which the active crystaliinity<br>
is too greatly disturbed (for example, less than 10 %<br>
crystallinity, or 100 % amorphous). A sensible additive level,<br>
below this limit, can then be found by identifying systems in<br>
which the active crystallinity is appreciably reduced (eg, by at<br>
least 10 % or preferably 20 %, possibly by up to 30 or 40 or 50<br>
%).<br>
Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) may suitably be<br>
used to establish the nature of the products tested;<br>
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and/or X-ray diffraction<br>
(XRD) may be used to investigate degree of crystallinity,<br>
typically by comparing with data from the pure, completely<br>
crystalline active starting material and also its totally<br>
amorphous form. Confocal Raman microscopy (for instance, using<br>
a system such as the HoloLab™ Series 5000) may also be used to<br>
establish whether a given product has the desired<br>
active/additive distribution - this builds up a "sectional" view<br>
through a particle and can reveal the nature and/or relative<br>
quantities of the substances present in the section scanned.<br>
As well as the relative concentrations of the active substance<br>
and the additive, other parameters may be varied if necessary in<br>
order to achieve a coformulation in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Such parameters include the temperature and pressure<br>
at the point of particle formation, the concentrations of the<br>
active and additive in the target solution, the nature of the<br>
vehicle and of the anti-solvent fluid (taking account of any<br>
modifiers present) and their flow rates upon contact with one<br>
another.<br>
It has not previously been recognised that a coprecipitazion<br>
process performed using SEDS™, whatever the relative<br>
concentrations of the coprecipitated species, could ever result<br>
in a product in which there was both an intimate solid<br>
dispersion of the species and a coating effect of one species by<br>
the other, with no distinct phase boundary between the two<br>
regions.<br>
The coprecipitated product of the method of the invention<br>
appears to be a type of solid dispersion, each particle<br>
containing a molecular-level mixture of both the active<br>
substance and the additive. However, it has surprisingly been<br>
found that the product is not a homogeneous mixture of the two<br>
components, but has a significantly lower level of the active<br>
substance at and near the surface of each particle compared to<br>
that in the particle core, sufficient for the additive to form,<br>
in effect, a protective surface layer. Thus, for example, a<br>
taste masking additive can mask even a strongly flavoured active<br>
substance, whilst at the same time also being incorporated into<br>
the sub-surface core of each particle. There is typically,<br>
however, no distinct physical boundary between the protective<br>
surface "layer" and the "enclosed" core, but instead a gradual<br>
change, with a finite gradient, in the active:additive ratio.<br>
The particle constitution is that of a solid dispersion<br>
throughout, but with a varying additive concentration across its<br>
radius.<br>
It has also, surprisingly, been found that for certain<br>
active/additive systems, in particular certain drug/polymer<br>
systems, SEDS™ coformulation does not readily yield an amorphous<br>
phase active, even up to in some cases 80 % w/w additive.<br>
Instead the coformulated product can still contain crystalline<br>
active substance with a relatively high additive concentration<br>
at the particle surfaces.<br>
The process of the invention works particularly well, it is<br>
believed (although we do not wish to be bound by this theory),<br>
when the active substance precipitates more quickly than the<br>
additive under the operating conditions (including choice of<br>
solid and fluid reagents) used. More specifically, this occurs<br>
when the nucleation and/or particle growth rate of the active<br>
substance is higher, preferably significantly higher, than that<br>
of the additive. The quicker growing active substance appears<br>
to precipitate initially as a "core7" particle, around which both<br>
the active and the additive collect as the solid particles grow,<br>
with the relative concentration of the slower growing additive<br>
gradually increasing as the particles grow in diameter. Towards<br>
the outer surfaces of the particles, when most of the active<br>
present has already precipitated, the concentration of the<br>
additive becomes sufficiently high that it then effectively<br>
"coats" the active-rich core.<br>
Thus, the operating conditions and/or the reagents used in the<br>
method of the invention should ideally be chosen so as to<br>
enhance or maximise the difference between the precipitation<br>
rates of the active substance and the additive. (By<br>
"precipitation rate" is meant the combined effects of the<br>
nucleation and particle growth rates.) This may in turn mean<br>
enhancing or maximising the chance of phase separation<br>
occurring, between on the one hand the active substance and its<br>
associated vehicle and on the other hand the additive and its<br>
associated vehicle, immediately prior to or at the point of<br>
particle formation; phase separation can inhibit formation of a<br>
truly homogeneous solid dispersion between the active and<br>
additive.<br>
Certain active/additive pairs will already have significantly<br>
different precipitation rates. This appears particularly to be<br>
the case when the active substance precipitates in a crystalline<br>
form and the additive in an amorphous form. Crystal habit may<br>
also affect the active substance precipitation rate. For<br>
example, it has been found that the invented process can be<br>
effective for active substances having a needle-like crystalline<br>
habit, possibly because the crystal growth rate is significantly<br>
faster in one dimension than in the ethers. Generally speaking,<br>
the active substance may have a crystalline form (under the<br>
conditions used) which is significantly longer in one dimension<br>
than in at least one other dimension, and/or its crystals may<br>
grow significantly faster in one dimension than in at least one<br>
other dimension; this embraces for example needle-like crystals<br>
and also, potentially, wafer- or plate-like crystals (for which<br>
growth is faster in two dimensions than in the third) and<br>
elongate prism-shaped crystals- Active substances having other<br>
crystal habits, or amorphous actives, may of course be protected<br>
using the method of the invention, using operating conditions<br>
suitable to enhance the difference between the active and<br>
additive precipitation rates.<br>
In the above discussion, "significantly" longer or faster means<br>
approximately 5 % or more, preferably at least 10 % or 20 % or<br>
30 %, greater than the length or speed of the lower of the two<br>
parameters being compared.<br>
The present invention may also be effective when the active<br>
substance and the additive have significantly different (for<br>
instance, at least 5 % different, preferably at least 10 %, more<br>
preferably at least 20 % or 30 %, based on the lower of the two<br>
values) solubilities in the anti-solvent fluid, as this can also<br>
affect the relative precipitation rates of the active and<br>
additive particles. This effect could be enhanced by the<br>
inclusion of suitable modifiers in the anti-solvent fluid,<br>
and/or by introducing a "secondary" anti-solvent fluid, having a<br>
lower capacity than the main anti-solvent for extracting the<br>
vehicle, as described in WO-99/44733. Generally, the additive<br>
should be more soluble than the active substance in the anti-<br>
solvent fluid, which should promote precipitation of the<br>
additive nearer to the particle surfaces.<br>
Similarly, when the active substance and additive have a low<br>
compatibility with one another, ie, a low solubility in or<br>
affinity for or miscibility with one another, this too can make<br>
them less likely to precipitate together in intimate admixture.<br>
For example, the active substance and additive will preferably<br>
have a solubility in one another of less than 30 % w/w, more<br>
preferably less than 25 % w/w, most preferably less than 20 % or<br>
15 % or 10 % w/w.<br>
Thus, the active substance and additive might preferably have<br>
significantly different polarities and thus low mutual<br>
solubilities and a low mutual affinity - this is likely to<br>
reduce interaction between the active and additive during<br>
particle formation, and promote the growth of active-rich and<br>
additive-rich regions in the product particles.<br>
Differences in polarity may be assessed for example by<br>
classifying each reagent as either polar, apolar or of<br>
intermediate polarity. The polarity of a substance is something<br>
which can be assessed by the average skilled person by reference<br>
to the number, position and polarity of functional groups<br>
present on the substance, and can be affected by factors such as<br>
substituent chain lengths. Polar substances for instance<br>
typically contain a significant proportion of polar functional<br>
groups such as amine, primary amides, hydroxyl, cyano,<br>
carboxylic acid, carboxylate, nitrile, sulphoxide, sulphonyl,<br>
thiol, halide and carboxyiic acid halide groups and other<br>
ionisable groups. Substances of medium polarity may contain<br>
functional groups of medium polarity, such as for instance<br>
esters, aldehydes, ketones, sulphides and secondary and tertiary<br>
amides. Substances of low polarity typically contain no<br>
functional groups or only functional groups of an apolar nature,<br>
such as alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl and ether groups. Thus<br>
ethyl cellulose, for example, a polymer whose chain structure is<br>
dominated by alkyl groups, is considered to be non-polar,<br>
whereas the presence of a significant number of hydroxyi groups<br>
in hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) renders it a polar<br>
substance.<br>
For polymers, polarity may also depend on the grade, for<br>
instance the molecular weight, degree of substitution, degree of<br>
cross-linking and any other comonomers present.<br>
Polar compounds include for instance acidic or basic compounds,<br>
ionic compounds, including salts, and otherwise highly charged<br>
species, vinyl polymers such as poly vinyl alcohol (PVA), HPMC<br>
as mentioned above, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyi<br>
cellulose, polyethylene glycols, polyacrylatss and<br>
polymethacrylates and polyoxyaikyienes. Low polarity/apolar<br>
compounds include for example steroids, ethyl cellulose and<br>
lipidic materials. Materials of intermediate polarity include<br>
the polylactides and glycolides and mixtures thereof.<br>
Assigning a value of 1, 2 or 3 to each reagent, I meaning low<br>
polarity or apolar, 3 meaning highly polar and 2 representing<br>
substances of intermediate polarity, it is preferred when<br>
practising the present invention that the active substance and<br>
the additive have different polarity values. More preferably,<br>
the active has a polarity of 1 and the additive of 3, or vice<br>
versa.<br>
It might previously have been expected that in such incompatible<br>
active/additive systems, a rapid solvent removal process such as<br>
SEDS™ would result in products containing two distinct phases,<br>
the active and additive precipitating separately from the fluid<br>
vehicle. Instead, it has surprisingly been found that SEDS™ may<br>
be used to generate a product having a gradual active/additive<br>
concentration gradient across it.<br>
Instead or in addition, the operating conditions during the<br>
method of the invention may be modified to enhance the<br>
difference between the active and additive precipitation rates.<br>
Operating under relatively mild temperatures and/or pressures<br>
(for instance, only just above the critical temperature and/cr<br>
pressure of the anti-solvent fluid (together with any modifiers<br>
which are present in it) may be expected to enhance any inherent<br>
differences in particle precipitation rates, by reducing the<br>
vehicle extraction rate and maximising the chance of phase<br>
separation, between the active and additive components.<br>
Typically, such "mild" conditions might correspond to between 1<br>
and 1.1 times the critical temperature Tc (in Kelvin) of the<br>
anti-solvent fluid, preferably between 1 and 1.05 times Tc or<br>
between 1.01 and 1.1 times Tc, more preferably between 1.01 and<br>
1.05 times Tc or between 1.01 and 1.03 times Tc. The pressure<br>
may be between 1 and 1.5 times the critical pressure Pc,<br>
preferably between 1.05 and 1.4 times Pc, more preferably<br>
between 1.08 or 1.1 and 1.35 times Pc. In the particular case<br>
of a carbon dioxide anti-solvent (Tc = 304 K; Pc = 74 bar),<br>
typical operating temperatures might be between 304 and 313 K,<br>
and operating pressures between 80 and 100 or 120 bar.<br>
"Mild" working conditions may suitably be such that the anti-<br>
solvent fluid is in a supercritical form but more liquid-like<br>
than gas-like in its properties, ie, its temperature is<br>
relatively close to (for instance, between 1 and 1.3 times) its<br>
Tc (measured in Kelvin), but its pressure is significantly<br>
greater than (for instance, between 1.2 and 1.6 times) its Pc.<br>
Typically, for a supercritical carbon dioxide anti-solvent, the<br>
operating conditions are chosen so that the density of the anti-<br>
solvent fluid is between 0.4 and 0.8 g/car, more preferably<br>
between 0.6 and 0.8 g/cm3. Suitable operating conditions for a<br>
carbon dioxide anti-solvent are therefore between 25 and 50 oC<br>
(298 and 323 K) , preferably between 32 and 40 oC (305 and 313<br>
K) , more preferably between 32 and 35 oC (305 and 308 K) , and<br>
between 70 and 120 bar, preferably between 70 and 110 bar, more<br>
preferably between 70 and 100 bar.<br>
Most preferred, when practising the present invention, is to use<br>
an incompatible active/additive pair, as described above, and tc<br>
carry out the particle formation under mild conditions, also as<br>
described above.<br>
It can thus be important, when practising the invention, to use<br>
a SEDS™ process but in doing so to seek to minimise the rate of<br>
vehicle extraction by the anti-solvent. This appears to make<br>
possible the gradual additive concentration gradient which is<br>
characteristic of products according to the invention. It is<br>
indeed surprising that a process such as SEDS™, which is known<br>
to involve an extremely rapid solvent removal, can nevertheless<br>
be used to coformulate reagents into products having a non-<br>
homogeneous active/additive distribution.<br>
The rate of solvent extraction may be reduced in the ways<br>
described above, for instance by working under relatively "mild"<br>
conditions with respect to the critical temperature and pressure<br>
of the anti-solvent. Instead or in addition, the vehicle and<br>
the anti-solvent fluid may be chosen to have less than complete<br>
miscibility (ie, to be immiscible in at least some relative<br>
proportions) under the chosen operating conditions, for instance<br>
to be less than very or freely soluble (eg, as defined in the<br>
British Pharmacopoeia 1999, Volume 1, pages 11 and 21) in one<br>
another. For a carbon dioxide anti-solvent, suitable vehicles<br>
might include higher boiling solvents, such as with a boiling<br>
point of at least 373 K, for instance higher (such as C4-C10)<br>
alcohols such as butanol, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), dimethyl<br>
formamide (DMF) and mixtures thereof. Other, lower boiling<br>
solvents such as lower alcohols (eg, methanol, ethanol) , ketones<br>
(eg, acetone) and the like, including mixtures of such solvents,<br>
may also of course be used. The vehicle may if appropriate<br>
contain minor (eg, 10 % v/v or less) amounts of other solvents<br>
(which may include water) to modify its solubility<br>
characteristics.<br>
A higher target solution flow rate, relative to that of the<br>
anti-solvent fluid, can also help to increase solvent extraction<br>
times. Suitably the fluid flow rates are selected so as to<br>
achieve, at the point of target solution/anti-solvent contact, a<br>
vehicle:anti-solvent mole ratio of between 5 and 20 %,<br>
preferably between 5 and 10 %. A suitable flow rate for a<br>
supercritical CO2 anti-solvent, for instance, may be 20 ml/min,<br>
and the target solution flow rate may then suitably be 1 ml/min<br>
or greater.<br>
Moreover, a target solution containing a semi-crystalline or in<br>
particular an amorphous additive will typically have a<br>
relatively high viscosity. This too can help to impede solvent<br>
removal, again slowing the particle formation process and<br>
allowing the active substance to precipitate more rapidly than<br>
the additive.<br>
As described above, the method of the invention may be practised<br>
using two separate vehicle fluids, one carrying the active<br>
substance and one carrying the additive, which contact one<br>
another only at or immediately before their point of contact<br>
with the anti-solvent fluid (ie, the point of vehicle extraction<br>
and particle formation). If the two vehicle fluids have<br>
significantly different solubilities in the anti-solvent fluid,<br>
this can cause a small degree of phase separation at the point<br>
of particle formation, the extent of which depends, inter alia,<br>
on the time period between the vehicles mixing and their contact<br>
with the anti-solvent fluid (which in turn depends on the fluid<br>
flow rates and the internal geometry of the fluid inlet used),<br>
and again can lead to differences in precipitation rate between<br>
the active and the additive.<br>
Generally speaking, any difference in the rate of vehicle<br>
extraction, by the anti-solvent fluid, between the active<br>
substance containing solution and that carrying -he additive, is<br>
thought tc be able to increase the effectiveness of the present<br>
invention. The rats of vehicle extraction is in turn influenced<br>
by the molecular interactions between each solute and its<br>
respective solvent, high levels of interaction being likely to<br>
slow solvent extraction and inhibit precipitation. Thus, in<br>
this version of the invention, the solubility of the active<br>
substance in its vehicle fluid should be significantly (for<br>
instance, 5 % or more, preferably at least 10 % or 20 % or 30 %,<br>
based on the lower of the two-solubilities) different to the<br>
solubility of the additive in its vehicle fluid. The active<br>
substance should ideally be less soluble in (ie, form weaker<br>
interactions with) its (first) vehicle fluid than the additive<br>
is in its (second) vehicle fluid, so that the additive is<br>
marginally less ready to precipitate than the active.<br>
Modifiers (co-solvents) in one or more of the vehicle fluid(s)<br>
and/or the anti-solvent fluid may be chosen to enhance such<br>
effects; operating pressures and temperatures, and even fluid<br>
flow rates, may also influence them.<br>
The method of the invention preferably involves selecting the<br>
reagents (ie, the active substance, the additive, the vehicle<br>
fluid(s), the anti-solvent fluid and any modifiers or co-<br>
solvents present) and the operating conditions (such as<br>
temperature and pressure at the point of particle formation,<br>
fluid flow rates and concentrations of the active and the<br>
additive in the vehicle), in order to increase the difference in<br>
particle precipitation rates, under the conditions used, between<br>
the active substance and the additive. Preferably the<br>
precipitation rate difference is at least 5 % of that of the<br>
slower precipitating material, more preferably at least 10 %,<br>
most preferably at least 20 % or 30 % or 40 % or 50 % or 75 % or<br>
90 % or 100 %.<br>
It can be seen from the above that there are several potential<br>
ways in which the precipitation rate difference may be enhanced<br>
or maximised in accordance with the invention.<br>
The method of the invention can provide significant advantages<br>
over known methods for coating an active substance with an<br>
additive. Because it involves particle formation by SEDSTM it is<br>
a one-step process, which can be carried out in a closed<br>
environment, shielded if necessary from light, oxygen and other<br>
contaminants, and it allows excellent control over the<br>
physicochemical characteristics of the product (such as particle<br>
size and size distribution, morphology, purity, yield and<br>
handling properties), as described in the prior art on SEDS™.<br>
It is also extremely useful for formulating small particles,<br>
which can otherwise be difficult to coat.<br>
The coformulated particles made according to the invention<br>
differ from conventional coated products; they are solid<br>
dispersions of one material in another, but with a finite<br>
gradient in the relative concentration of the additive, which<br>
concentration increases radially outwards from the core to the<br>
surface of each particle. The particles are thus (in particular<br>
at their surfaces) not truly homogeneous mixtures of the two<br>
components, such as one would expect from a prior art<br>
coformulation process, since such mixtures would include at<br>
least some exposed active substance at the particle surfaces and<br>
hence be unsuitable for protecting or masking the active<br>
substance. In particles made according to the present<br>
invention, the active substance:additive ratio, at the particle<br>
surface, can be sufficiently low for a taste masking additive to<br>
mask, effectively, the flavour of for example an extremely<br>
bitter tasting drug such as quinine sulphate.<br>
Nor, however, are the particles "coated", in the conventional<br>
sense of the word, with the additive. They tend not to possess<br>
a core and a separate coating layer with a distinct physical<br>
boundary (at which boundary the "gradient" in the additive.<br>
concentration is theoretically infinite) between them. Rather,<br>
they exhibit a gradual change from an active-rich core to an<br>
additive-rich (and preferably active-free) surface.<br>
It is possible that the active substance at the core of a<br>
particle according to the invention will interact to -at least<br>
some degree with the additive present in the particle, and<br>
towards the centre the particle may have the form of a solid<br>
dispersion of the active and additive, manifested in general by<br>
a disturbance in the crystallinity of a crystalline or semi-<br>
crystalline active even at the particle core. However it is<br>
also possible that a particle may be formed in which, at its .<br>
centre, the active exists in a pure (and if relevant,<br>
crystalline) form. Evidence to date (in particular Raman<br>
confocal microscopy studies) suggest that a particle made by the<br>
method of the invention does not exhibit more than one separate<br>
"phase" nor any distinct phase boundary, but rather contains<br>
only gradual transitions between regions of different<br>
active:additive concentration ratios across its diameter.<br>
Such particle properties, thought to be unique, are likely to<br>
influence their dissolution profiles, in particular where the<br>
additive acts to inhibit release of the active substance. The<br>
release-inhibiting effect is likely to be most marked during an<br>
initial period of time corresponding to dissolution of the<br>
additive at the particle surfaces, and to fall off gradually<br>
thereafter.<br>
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data from the products<br>
is also likely to be affected by their unique active:additive<br>
concentration profile. For instance, when the active substance<br>
is crystalline or semi-crystalline, it is expected that -he DSC<br>
profile for a product made according to the invention will<br>
exhibit one or more peaks indicative of crystalline active, but<br>
that the peak(s) will be broader to at least some degree than<br>
those for the pure active substance, indicating a degree of<br>
interaction between the active and the additive. When both the<br>
active and the additive are crystalline or semi-crystalline, it<br>
can be expected that the DSC profile of the coformulation will<br>
exhibit two distinct peaks or sets of peaks, one for the active<br>
substance and one for the additive, with both peaks/sets being<br>
broader than those for the pure starting materials, again<br>
indicating a degree of solid/solid interaction but retention of<br>
at least some of the character of the individual materials.<br>
Similarly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of a product made<br>
according to the invention is likely to indicate reduced<br>
crystallinity for a normally crystalline active substance, due<br>
to interaction with the additive, but not a completely amorphous<br>
system such as might be seen with a truly homogenous solid<br>
dispersion.<br>
The gradient in the relative additive concentration, across the<br>
particle radius, will depend on a number of factors such as the<br>
solubility characteristics of the species present, the<br>
viscosities of their solutions, the nature and rate of their<br>
particle growth, etc., as described above. The gradient may or<br>
may not be constant across the radius, but the rate of change in<br>
additive concentration is typically continuous rather than<br>
stepped, from the core to the additive-rich surface (which<br>
preferably contains, at its outer limit, 100 % additive). It<br>
may be possible to identify "core" and "surface" regions of the<br>
particles with a concentration gradient between them. In this<br>
case the constitution of the "core" is preferably between 90 and<br>
100 % w/w active substance, more preferably between 95 and 100<br>
%, most preferably between 98 and 100 % w/w (it is possible that<br>
the core will contain no additive at all).<br>
The active substance in the core is preferably in a crystalline<br>
form, for instance between 80 % and 100 % or between 90 and 100<br>
%, ideally 100 % crystalline.<br>
The "surface" layer preferably contains between 5 and 0 %, more<br>
preferably between 2 and 0 % or between 1 and 0 % or between 0.5<br>
and 0 %, most preferably 0 % w/w of the active substance, ie,<br>
there is preferably no active substance exposed at the outer<br>
particle surface.<br>
For these purposes, the "surface" layer may suitably be taken to<br>
be the outermost region containing 0.0001 % or more of the total<br>
particle volume, preferably 0.001 % or more. The "core" region<br>
may suitably be taken to be the central region containing 0.0001<br>
% or more of the total particle volume, more preferably 0.001 %<br>
or more. Either region may be taken to contain up to 0.01 %,<br>
0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10 % or even 15 % of the total particle volume.<br>
The active:additive concentration gradient can be controlled, in<br>
the method of the invention, by altering the operating<br>
conditions as described above. It will be affected by these and<br>
by the nature of in particular the active substance and the<br>
additive but also the vehicle and the anti-solvent fluid. The<br>
skilled person, using available data on the solubilities,<br>
miscibilities and viscosities of the reagents he uses, should be<br>
well able to select and alter the operating conditions to<br>
influence the distribution of the additive in the product<br>
particles.<br>
The degree of crystallinity of a normally crystalline active<br>
substance will also vary gradually from the core to the surface<br>
of the particle. At the centre, the active substance may be<br>
highly, possibly even 100 %, crystalline, but towards the<br>
surface its interaction with the additive will typically be such<br>
as to disrupt its crystallinity and increasingly high levels of<br>
amorphous phase active substance may be present as the particle<br>
surface is approached. It can often be desirable, in for<br>
instance drug/excipient formulations, for an active substance to<br>
be present in a more readily dissolvable (and hence more<br>
bioavailable) amorphous form; this characteristic of the<br>
products of the invention can thus be advantageous, particularly<br>
when combined with the coating effect which can mask unpleasant<br>
flavours and/or delay release of the active substance for a<br>
desired period of time.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a particulate coformulation of an active substance and<br>
a (typically protective) additive, of the type described above.<br>
The coformulation is a solid dispersion of one component in the<br>
other but with a finite gradient in the relative additive<br>
concentration which increases radially outwards from the core to<br>
the surface of the particles, the particles having an additive-<br>
rich surface region but preferably no distinct physical boundary<br>
between that region and the rest of the particle.<br>
A particuiate coformulation in accordance with the invention may<br>
alternatively be described as an intimate, molecular level,<br>
solid-phase mixture of an active substance and an additive, the<br>
particles of which have an additive-rich, preferably active<br>
substance-free, surface region. The active substance:additive<br>
ratio, at the particle surface, is preferably sufficiently low<br>
for the additive to form, effectively, a protective surface<br>
layer around the active substance.<br>
In the case where the active substance has an unpleasant flavour<br>
or odour and the additive is a taste masking agent, the active<br>
substance:additive weight ratio, at the particle surfaces, is<br>
preferably sufficiently low for the additive to mask,<br>
effectively, the flavour or odour of the active substance.<br>
The outer additive layer is preferably sufficient to prevent any<br>
detectable release of the active substance for at least 30<br>
seconds, preferably at least 60, more preferably at least 90 or<br>
120 or 150 or 180 or even 240 or 300 seconds after the product<br>
of the invention comes into contact with saliva in a consumer"s<br>
mouth (or on immersion of the product in a pH neutral aqueous<br>
solution). It may also be preferred for there to be no<br>
detectable release of the active substance for at least 2, more<br>
preferably 3 or even 4 or 5, minutes on immersion of the product<br>
in an aqueous solution of pH between 1 and 2, mimicking the<br>
conditions in a consumer"s stomach.<br>
The thickness of the outer additive ("coating") layer will<br>
depend on. the nature of the active and additive, the size of the<br>
particle as a whole and the use for which it is intended.<br>
Suitable outer layers might be between 0.1 and 10 µm in depth,<br>
mere preferably between 0.1 and 5 µm.<br>
A coformuiation according to the invention preferably consists<br>
essentially of the active substance and the additive, ie, it<br>
preferably contains no, or only minor amounts (for instance,<br>
less than 5 % w/w, preferably less than 2 % w/w or less than 1 %<br>
w/w) of, additional ingredients such as surfactants, emulsifiers<br>
and stabilisers. It preferably contains no bulking agents such<br>
as silica, in particular colloidal silica.<br>
A coformuiation according to the second aspect of the invention<br>
is preferably made by a method according to the first aspect.<br>
Aspects of the coformuiation such as the nature, amounts and<br>
distribution of the active substance and the additive are<br>
therefore preferably as described above in connection with the<br>
first aspect: of the invention. The coformulation may in<br>
particular be or comprise a pharmaceutical or nutriceutical<br>
agent or a foodstuff. The active substance is preferably<br>
present in a crystalline form and the additive in an amorphous<br>
form.<br>
The coformulation may have a particle volume mean diameter (in<br>
the case of spherical or approximately spherical particles) of<br>
between 0.5 and 100 urn, preferably between 0.5 and 20, more<br>
preferably between 0.5 and 10 or between 1 and 10 µm. In the<br>
case of needle-like particles, the volume mean particle length<br>
is typically between 5 and 100 µm, preferably between 10 and<br>
100, more preferably between 50 and 100 µm, and the volume mean<br>
thickness between 0.5 and 5, preferably between 1 and 5, µm. In<br>
the case of plate-like particles, the volume mean thickness is<br>
typically between 0.5 and 5 µm. The present invention can thus<br>
be of particular benefit in preparing small particles having an<br>
effective coating deposited on them, since using conventional<br>
coating technologies the coating of fine particles (for<br>
instance, of size below 10 µm or 5 µm or more particularly below<br>
1 µm) can be extremely difficult. The present invention allows<br>
both core and coating to be generated in a single processing<br>
step, with a high level of control over product characteristics<br>
such as size and size distribution.<br>
A third aspect of the present invention provides a<br>
pharmaceutical composition which includes a coformulation<br>
according to the second aspect. The composition may be, for<br>
example, a tablet or powder, a suspension or any other dosage<br>
form, in particular one intended for oral or nasal delivery.<br>
A fourth aspect of the invention provides a foodstuff or<br>
nutriceutical composition which includes a coformulation<br>
according to the second aspect.<br>
A fifth aspect provides the use of a SEDS™ co-precipitation<br>
process in preparing particles of an active substance having a<br>
layer of an additive on the particle surfaces. By "co-<br>
precipitation process" is meant a method which involves<br>
dissolving both the active substance and the additive in a<br>
vehicle to form a single target solution, and contacting the<br>
target solution with an anti-solvent fluid so as to cause the<br>
active substance and additive to ccprecipitate.<br>
According to this fifth aspect of the invention, the SEDS™ co-<br>
precipitation is used to achieve a coating of the additive at<br>
the particle surfaces. Preferably the coating is a protective<br>
layer, in particular a taste and/or odour masking layer. A<br>
SEDS™ co-precipitation (ie, both active and additive being<br>
precipitated together from a common solvent system) has not<br>
previously been used for such a purpose.<br>
The present invention will now be described, by way of example<br>
only, with reference to the accompanying illustrative drawings,<br>
of which:<br>

quinine sulphate and the products of Examples A6 and A8<br>
respectively;<br>

product of Example Cl respectively; and<br>
Figs 22A and B show the results of a confocal Raman spectroscopy<br>
analysis of the constitution of a product according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Experimental Examples A<br>
These examples demonstrate the coformulation, using SEDSW, of the highly polar anti-malarial drug quinine sulphate (QS)<br>
(Sigma™, UK) with the apciar polymer ethyl cellulose (EC-N7,<br>
Hercules™, OK). QS has an unpleasant bitter taste and would<br>
conventionally need to be coated with a taste masking agent<br>
prior to administration.<br>
A SEDS™ process was used to precipitate both drug and polymer<br>
together from a single "target solution". The apparatus used<br>
was analogous to that described in WO-95/01221 (Fig I), using a<br>
50 ml Keystone™ pressure vessel as the particle formation vessel<br>
and a two-passage concentric nozzle of the form depicted in<br>
Figure 3 of WO-95/01221. The nozzle outlet had an internal<br>
diameter of 0.2 mm. Supercritical carbon dioxide was the chosen<br>
anti-solvent. The particle formation vessel was maintained at<br>
100 bar and 35 °C.<br>
Example Al - precipitation of QS alone<br>
A 1 % w/v solution of QS in absolute ethanol was introduced into<br>
the particle formation vessel at 0.3 ml/min through the inner<br>
nozzle passage. Supercritical carbon dioxide was introduced at<br>
9 ml/min through the outer nozzle passage. Particles formed and<br>
were collected in the vessel.<br>
The product was a fine, fluffy white powder. SEM (scanning<br>
electron microscope) examination showed a needle-like morphology<br>
(Fig 1), different to that of the starting material (Fig 2) .<br>
Example A2 - copreclpltation of QS and ethyl cellulose<br>
A 1 % w/v solution of QS in absolute ethanol, also containing 20<br>
% by weight (based on the overall drug/polymer mix) of ethyl<br>
cellulose, was introduced into the particle formation vessel<br>
with supercritical carbon dioxide, using the same operating<br>
temperature and pressure, and the same fluid flew rates, as for<br>
Example Al.<br>
The product, collected in the vessel, was again a fine, fluffy<br>
white powder,- having a similar particle morphology to the<br>
product of Example Al (see the SEM phonograph in Figure 3).<br>
Examples A3-A10 - increasing the polymer concentration<br>
Example A2 was repeated but using 3 %, 10 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %,<br>
60 %, 70 % and 80 % w/w respectively of the ethyl cellulose<br>
polymer.<br>
All products were fine, fluffy white powders. Those of Examples<br>
A3-A7 (respectively 5 %, 10 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % w/w ethyl<br>
cellulose) had a needle-like particle morphology with smooth<br>
surfaces - see the representative SEM photographs in Figures 4,<br>
5 and 6 for the products of Examples A3, A4 and A6 respectively.<br>
The Example A8 product (60 % w/w ethyl cellulose) contained<br>
spherical particles, most likely of ethyl cellulose, deposited<br>
on the edges of needle-like particles (see Fig 7). This effect<br>
became more marked as the ethyl cellulose content increased, the<br>
spherical polymer particles covering almost all the QS crystal<br>
surfaces in the products of Examples A9 (70 % w/w ethyl<br>
cellulose, Fig 8) and A10 (80 % w/w ethyl cellulose, Fig 9).<br>
Results and discussion<br>
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the products of<br>
Examples A2 to A10 were essentially similar (in terms of peak<br>
positions) to that of the pure, unprocessed QS powder (Fig 10).<br>
This indicates that there had been no solid state phase<br>
(polymorphic) change in the QS during SEDS™ processing and that<br>
its crystalline phase was still present in all products. In<br>
other words, the products were not true solid "dispersions" of<br>
the drug in the polymer (as were, for example, the products<br>
described in WO-01/15664). Figs 11 and 12 show the XRD patterns<br>
for the products of Examples A6 and A8 respectively; a slight<br>
reduction in crystallinity can be observed, which is consistent<br>
with the presence of the polymer in the surface regions of the<br>
particles.<br>
The XRD data are also consistent with the SEM observations of<br>
crystalline particles with polymer-like features on -he particle<br>
surfaces.<br>
When coformulating a drug with more than about 40% w/w of a<br>
polymer, in general an amorphous particulate product would be<br>
expected. Typically, even at levels below 40% w/w, the presence<br>
of the polymer would still be expected to cause a substantial<br>
decrease in the degree of drug crystallinity. This is<br>
illustrated and confirmed by the teachings in WO-01/15664. It<br>
is therefore surprising to find that the products of the present<br>
examples retained a substantial degree of crystallinity, even in<br>
those containing as much as 60 % w/w (Figs 7 and 12) or 80 % w/w<br>
(Fig 9) of the polymer. It is thought that this could be due to<br>
the difference in the rate of solvent extraction, by the<br>
supercritical carbon dioxide, from the solution elements of on<br>
the one hand the drug and on the other the polymer, under the<br>
relatively mild working conditions used. Relatively high levels<br>
of interaction between the polymer and the ethanol solvent, as<br>
compared to those between the QS and the ethanol, combined with<br>
relatively low levels of interaction between the polar drug and<br>
the hydrophobic polymer, could cause slower solvent extraction<br>
in the region of the polymer molecules, and hence delay or<br>
discourage their precipitation.<br>
On tasting the products of Examples A5 to A10 (by four<br>
panellists), no bitterness could be detected for up to as long<br>
as 120 seconds or more. In contrast, pure QS gave an<br>
immediately detectable bitter taste. This indicates that, at<br>
least at the particle surfaces in the coformulated products,<br>
there was no available QS and an extremely high (perhaps 100%)<br>
concentration of ethyl cellulose. That this can be achieved<br>
even at up to 70 % w/w QS (Example A5) could be of significant<br>
benefit in the formulation of quinine sulphate dosage forms.<br>
These tasting experiments, although net rigorous, provide an<br>
effective indication of the existence of a continuous protective<br>
layer, analogous to a coating, at the particle surfaces, an<br>
unexpected result from a conformulation process. It appears that<br>
this continuous layer is present in addition to the separate<br>
particles of excess polymer which are visible on the crystal<br>
surfaces in the Example A8 to A10 products (Figs 7 to 9).<br>
Experimental Examples B<br>
These examples demonstrate the coformulation, using SEDSTM, of<br>
the artificial sweetener aspartame (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine<br>
methyl ester, AldrionTM, OK) with ethyl cellulose (EC-N7,<br>
Hercules™, OK). Aspartame is an intensely sweet chemical,<br>
having a sweetening power of approximately 18 0 to 200 times that<br>
of sucrose, which is widely used in beverages, table-top<br>
sweeteners and other food and nutriceutical (for instance,<br>
vitamin preparations) products. It was chosen for these<br>
experiments because of the ease with which it can be detected if<br>
insufficiently taste masked.<br>
The aspartame (polar) and ethyl cellulose (non-polar) were<br>
precipitated together from a single "target solution" in a 1:1<br>
v/v acetonermethanol solvent mixture. The apparatus and<br>
operating conditions (temperature, pressure and fluid flow<br>
races) used were the same as those in Examples A. Again, the<br>
anti-solvent was supercritical carbon dioxide.<br>
Example B1 - coprecipitation of aspartame and ethyl cellulose<br>
The target solution contained 1 % w/v aspartame and 10 % w/w<br>
ethyl cellulose. The product collected in the particle<br>
formation vessel was a fine, fluffy white powder. SEM<br>
examination showed a needle-like morphology (Fig 14), similar to<br>
that of the aspartame starting material (Fig 13) , but with small<br>
spherical polymer particles visible on the aspartame crystal<br>
surfaces even at this relatively low polymer concentration.<br>
Examples B2 and B3 - increasing the polymer concertration<br>
Example B1 was repeated but with ethyl cellulose concentrations<br>
of 30 and 60 % w/w respectively in the target solution. In both<br>
cases the product was a fine, fluffy white powder with similar<br>
morphology to that of Example 31, although at these levels the<br>
polymer particles appeared completely to cover the aspartame<br>
crystals. Fig 15 is an SEM photograph of the Example B2 product<br>
(30 % w/w ethyl cellulose); Fig 16 shows that of Example B3 (60<br>
% w/w ethyl cellulose).<br>
The Example B2 product (30 % w/w ethyl cellulose) was tasted by<br>
seven panellists. No sweetness was detected for more than 600<br>
seconds. In contrast, sweetness could be detected immediately<br>
from the as-supplied aspartame starting material. The taste<br>
masking effect is believed to be due to the hydrophobic ethyl<br>
cellulose layer covering virtually every aspartame particle (Fig<br>
15) .<br>
Experimental Examples C<br>
In these experiments, the method of the invention was used to<br>
apply a taste masking coating to a highly polar active substance<br>
(NaCl) precipitated from an aqueous solution. Two alternative<br>
processing methods were used (Experiments C1 and C2). The<br>
products of both experiments were tasted by five panellists.<br>
Very little if any saltiness was detected for more than 300<br>
seconds, indicating efficient coating of the NaCl with the taste<br>
masking additive.<br>
These results illustrate further the bread applicability of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Example Cl - in situ mixing of active and additive solutions<br>
A three-passage coaxial nozzle, of the type illustrated in<br>
Figure 3 of WO-96/00610, was used to co-introduce into a 50 ml<br>
Keystone™ pressure vessel (a) a 30% w/v solution of pure NaCi<br>
(&gt;99%, SigmaTM UK) in deionised water, (b) a 0.22% w/v solution<br>
of EC-N7 (as in Examples B) in pure methanol and (c)<br>
supercritical carbon dioxide as the anti-solvent. The NaCl and<br>
EC-N7 solutions, introduced through the intermediate and inner<br>
nozzle passages respectively, met inside the nozzle immediately<br>
prior to their contact with carbon dioxide flowing through the<br>
outer nozzle passage.<br>
The flow rates for the fluids were (a) 0.02 ml/min, (b) 1.2<br>
ml/min and (c) 36 ml/min. The pressure vessel was maintained at<br>
100 bar and 35 °C. The nozzle outlet had an internal diameter<br>
of 0.2 mm.<br>
The relative NaCl and EC-N7 concentrations yielded a<br>
coformulation containing 30% w/w of the ethyl cellulose. The<br>
product was a fine, fluffy, white powder; SEM analysis showed<br>
micrcparticles with a rounded morphology (Fig 13) which were<br>
much smaller than those of the as received, milled pure NaCl<br>
(Fig 17).<br>
Figs 20 and 21 are XRD patterns for the NaCl starting material<br>
and the Example Cl product respectively. That for the Cl<br>
product indicates a slight reduction in crystallinity compared<br>
to that for the starting material, due to the presence of the<br>
polymer.<br>
Example C2 - pra-mixing of active and additive solutions<br>
In this experiment, 0.3 g of pure NaCl was dissolved in 1 ml of<br>
deionised water to form solution A. 0.13 g of EC-N7 was<br>
dissolved in 60 ml of pure methanol to form solution B. Solution<br>
3 was then added to solution A to form a solution mixture C.<br>
Mixture C was then pumped at 0.3 ml/min into a 50 ml Keystone™<br>
vessel kept at 100 bar and 35 °C, via the inner passage of a<br>
two-passage coaxial nozzle (outlet diameter 0.2 mm) as used in<br>
Examples 3. Supercritical carbon dioxide was introduced at 9<br>
ml/min through the outer nozzle passage.<br>
The product was a fine, fluffy white powder (SEM photomicrograph<br>
shown in Fig 19) having a similar morphology to that of the<br>
Example Cl product.<br>
Experimental Example D -<br>
Product Characterisation<br>
In this example, the constitution of a product prepared<br>
according to the invention was analysed.<br>
The product contained 20 % w/w quinine sulphate (QS) with an<br>
ethyl cellulose (EC) coating agent. It was prepared in the same<br>
way as Examples A, using the same operating temperature,<br>
pressure and fluid flow rates and the same two-passage coaxial<br>
nozzle. Supercritical carbon dioxide was the anti-solvent and<br>
the drug and coating agent were dissolved in absolute ethanol at<br>
1 % w/v.<br>
The product was analysed by Raman spectroscopy using the Kaiser™<br>
Raman confocal microscope system (HoloLab™ Series 5000). This<br>
builds up a cross-sectional image of the constitution of the<br>
product particles. The laser power at the sample was<br>
approximately 27 mW at 785 nm from an attenuated Kaiser™<br>
Invictus™ diode laser.<br>
Fig 22A shows a visual image of the sample, in which the needle-<br>
like QS crystals are visible. The two crosses indicate the<br>
Raman mapping area, which was 15 x 18 µm. Fig 223 is a contour<br>
map based on integration of the signal from the band at 1370 cm-1<br>
that corresponds to the vibration of quinine. This band is net<br>
present in the spectrum of the pure EC polymer; its absence is<br>
indicated by the darkest shaded outer regions in Fig 225. The<br>
white areas represent: pure QS.<br>
Fig 223 shows clearly that the product particles contain outer<br>
regions of pure EC and are thus completely "coated". Some also<br>
contain a QS "core" from which the EC prctectant is completely<br>
absent. Other shaded areas in Fig 223 reflect the intensity<br>
scale gradient of the 1370 cm"" spectral band and therefore<br>
indicate different drug:polymer ratios. These contours indicate<br>
not the existence of different compounds or discrete phases but<br>
a gradual change in the QS:EC concentration ratio between the<br>
core and the surface of the particle.<br>
Experimental Examples E<br>
These examples investigated the residual solvent content and<br>
stability of ethyl cellulose(EC)-coated quinine sulphate (QS)<br>
prepared according to the present invention.<br>
The product of Example A7 (50 % w/w QS in EC) was analysed for<br>
residual solvent (ethanol) content using the head space gas<br>
chromatography method (Genesis™ Headspace Analyser fitted on the<br>
Varian™ 3400 Series chromatograph).<br>
The analysis showed a residual ethanoi content of less than 500<br>
ppm, which represents the lower quantifiable limit. This is<br>
also much lower than the limit specified in the ICH<br>
(International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical<br>
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use)<br>
guidelines, which is currently 5000 ppm for ethanol.<br>
For the assessment of stability, 200 mg of the Example A6<br>
product (60 % w/w QS in EC) was stored for a month at room<br>
temperature and 100 % relative humidity, alongside a sample of<br>
the as-received pure QS. The sample prepared according to the<br>
present invention showed no change in powder physical appearance<br>
or flow properties after storage. In contrast the uncoated QS<br>
showed signs of partial caking and a lower degree of powder<br>
flowability. This indicates that the invented product had an<br>
effective polymer coating, adequate to protect the encapsulated<br>
active from environmental humidity and enhance its storage<br>
stability.<br>
