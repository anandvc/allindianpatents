				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates to a device for non-destructive determination of<br>
mechanical properties of steel sheets in one direction of steel sheet specimen.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The mechanical properties of steel are essential to be determined to improve and<br>
maintain quality of steel. A device for determining the mechanical properties<br>
finds a wide application in the steel industry. The destructive testing of steel<br>
specimen is the standard practice for determination of mechanical properties.<br>
This process is time consuming and costly. This method of determination of<br>
mechanical properties has limitations and problems like, the sample used is<br>
destroyed or altered mechanically in the test and highly trained workmanship is<br>
required to perform testing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop a device to determine<br>
mechanical properties non-destructively, which is more accurate and convenient<br>
to use.<br>
In modern steel making, the mechanical properties can be controlled through<br>
physical treatments during manufacturing of steel. Therefore, the measurement<br>
of mechanical properties of steel instantaneously throughout the rolling length<br>
can be useful not only to ensure the quality of product but also to regulate the<br>
process.<br><br>
The device of the present invention for the measurement of mechanical<br>
properties non-destructively is based on determining magneto-mechanical<br>
analogy of steel sheet specimen. There exists a correlation between magnetic<br>
moments of elementary atomic magnets of ferromagnetic material and its<br>
mechanical properties.<br>
To determine mechanical properties (yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and<br>
percentage elongation), in the present invention the steel sheet specimen is<br>
introduced between a pair of coils for magneto-inductive coupling. The primary<br>
coil having an air core is excited with a sinusoidal voltage source at fixed<br>
frequency to generate magnetic field strength in the specimen. The hysteresis<br>
curve of the ferro-magnetic material modulates the excitation voltage. This can<br>
be reflected as induced voltage in a receiving coil.<br>
The harmonic analysis of induced voltage in receiving coil is done to extract<br>
features of the particular specimen. The characteristic parameters of the<br>
harmonic analysis are correlated with the mechanical values determined by<br>
destructive tests. A neural network algorithm is applied to determine this<br>
correlation.<br>
Thus the present invention relates to a device for non-destructive determination<br>
of mechanical properties of steel sheets in one direction of a steel sheet<br>
specimen, said device comprising: a clamping unit for clamping the steel sheet<br>
specimen mechanical property of which is to be determined; a sensing system<br>
for generating magnetic field in the specimen and for sensing an induced<br>
modulated output signal; a data acquisition and digital signal processing unit for<br>
harmonic analysis and computation of characteristic parameters from the<br>
induced modulated output signal; and a processor for computation of neural<br>
network for correlating the characteristic parameters of harmonics with the<br>
mechanical properties of the specimen.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be further described below with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawing in which:<br>
FIG 1 shows a block diagram of the device with all its components.<br>
FIG 2 shows the device of the present invention.<br>
FIG 3 is a schematic diagram of sensor system.<br>
FIG 4 explains the neural network used for correlation.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVFNTION<br>
The basic working principle of the device is based on magneto-mechanical<br>
analogy. This analogy defines the correlation between the mechanical<br>
properties, like yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, percentage elongation<br>
and hardness of ferro-magnetic material and magnetic moments of the basic<br>
atomic magnets of ferro-magnetic material which are characterized by the shape<br>
of the hysteresis curve.<br>
The invention can be fully explained with the help of a block diagram of the<br>
device as shown in Figure 1. The device of the present invention is provided<br>
with a sensor system 3. This sensor system 3 (shown in Figure 2) comprises a<br>
primary coil 5 having an air core and excited with a sinusoidal voltage source at<br>
fixed frequency to generate magnetic field strength in a specimen 4 to be tested.<br>
The specimen 4 is placed with its plane perpendicular to the axis of the sensor<br>
system 3 (Figure 3).<br><br>
The hysterisis curve of the ferro magnetic material of the specimen 4 modulates<br>
the excitation voltage which is reflected as an induced voltage in a secondary or<br>
a receiving coil 6.<br>
A data acquisition and digital signal processing unit 8 is provided for carrying out<br>
harmonic analysis of the induced voltage In the receiving coil 6 for extracting the<br>
features of the test specimen 4.<br>
A neural network processor 9 is provided for correlating the parameters of the<br>
harmonic analysis from the data acquisition and digital signal processing unit 8<br>
with the mechanical values determined by destructive tests. The mechanical<br>
properties of the test specimen 4 can be displayed in a graphic user interface 10<br>
coupled to the processor 9.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 2, the device of the present invention can be made as a<br>
portable handheld unit. It comprises a clamping unit 1 to clamp steel sheet<br>
specimen 4 whose mechanical properties are to be determined. Clamping jaws 2<br>
hold the sensor system 3. The axis of the sensing system 3 is perpendicular to<br>
the plane of the sheet specimen 4. The springing action of the clamping jaws 2<br>
holds the specimen 4 in such a way that there is no leakage of flux through the<br>
gap.<br>
The two coils 5, 6 of the sensor system 3 are held by the clamping jaws 2 of the<br>
device. These two coils are placed opposite to each other and perpendicular to<br>
the plane of the specimen 4.<br><br>
The schematic diagram is shown in Fig 3. The sinusoidal voltage signal received<br>
in the receiving coil 6 is modulated by the hysteresis curve of the specimen,<br>
which acts as a magnetic coupling between the two coils. The receiving coil 6<br>
comprises a coil with more number of turns as compared to the primary coil 5<br>
wound on an E shaped soft iron core 7. The core 7 is used to increase the<br>
sensitivity of the receiving coil 6.<br>
A sensor is provided for measuring the thickness of the specimen 4.<br>
Fast Fourier transform can be used for harmonic analysis of the received voltage<br>
induced in the receiving coil.<br>
The data acquisition and digital signal processing unit 8 used for the analysis can<br>
be a DSP processor for computing the characteristic parameters of harmonics<br>
induced by the specimen 4.<br>
The results obtained from the harmonic analysis are to be correlated with the<br>
mechanical properties of the specimen obtained from the destructive tests.<br>
Since there are no simple equations for solving the correlation - the only<br>
information available is a set of characteristic parameters of harmonic analysis of<br>
the specimen. The correlation is obtained by designing and training a neural<br>
network. The neural network can be trained' with the harmonic information of a<br>
small group of specimens, the mechanical properties of which are known by<br>
destructive method. The thickness of the sheet specimen 4 also becomes an<br>
input along with the harmonic information, to determine the accurate correlation.<br>
Once the neural network converges with minimum error, it is ready to analyze<br>
properties of unknown specimen. Fig 4 explains the neural network used for<br>
correlation.<br><br>
The device of the present invention can measure the mechanical properties in<br>
one direction. It can be rotated to measure the mechanical properties in any<br>
other direction.<br>
The processor 9 used for computation of neural network can be a computer.<br>
This processor can also have a graphic user interface designed to make the<br>
whole process (i.e. placing commands to viewing the mechanical properties) user<br>
friendly by displaying the mechanical properties in a displaying unit 10.<br>
The device for non-destructive determination of mechanical properties of steel<br>
sheet reduces the number of destructive tests which are time consuming and<br>
costly. The mechanical properties can be instantaneously determined. It helps<br>
in making material choice according to the quality criteria and preserving the<br>
product quality. The device of the present invention can be put on line for<br>
measuring properties throughout the rolling length. The on-line usage of the<br>
device can aid in regulating the process.<br><br>
