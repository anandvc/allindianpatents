				<td>ENGINE OIL VISCOSITY DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS AND METHODS<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to engine control systems and<br>
methods.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Motor oil is a type of liquid oil used for lubrication by various<br>
types of motors. In particular, internal combustion engines use motor oil to<br>
provide lubrication between mechanical components. The motor oil also<br>
serves as a cooling system to the engine. The motor oil dissipates heat<br>
generated by friction between the mechanical components.<br>
[0004] Oil viscosity is the ability of oil to flow and is expressed as a<br>
proportionality constant between the shear stress and shear rate of a fluid.<br>
Viscosity is typically affected by temperature, chemical properties, and other<br>
constituents in the oil. Viscosity influences the oil's ability to flow which in-turn<br>
influences the motivating force, or pressure, required to push the oil<br>
sufficiently to develop the necessary flow. For example, hot oil flows faster<br>
than cold oil. which can influence operating pressure characteristics of the<br>
system The rate of oil flow is important to the life of an engine. Previously,<br>
engine oil viscosity was of interest only to provide good hydrodynamic<br>
lubrication of load-bearing surfaces and to assure adequate flow throughout<br>
the engine. With recent advancements in engine controls that use engine oil<br>
for precise timing, oil viscosity has become increasingly important. Such<br>
advancements include cam phasing, active fuel management, and two-step<br>
valve actuation. These are all positive displacement devices that require an oil<br>
flow source to develop sufficient pressure which provides hydraulic actuation<br>
of components within an engine. Thus, their function can be sensitive to the<br>
viscosity characteristics of the oil. Engine oil viscosity can be difficult to<br><br>
forecast due to the variability of oil change intervals associated with driving<br>
conditions as well as various oil chemistries, and aftermarket oil additives.<br>
[0005] Providing a control system to diagnose the viscosity of the<br>
engine oil would enhance the operation of engine components that rely on the<br>
engine oil.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, an engine oil viscosity diagnostic system is<br>
provided. The system includes: a solenoid response module that determines<br>
an actual response time based on a position signal; an expected response<br>
module that determines an expected response time based on a system<br>
voltage and engine oil temperature; and a diagnostic module that diagnoses<br>
viscosity of the engine oil based on the actual response time and the<br>
expected response time.<br>
[0007] In other features, an engine system for diagnosing engine oil<br>
viscosity is provided. The system includes: an engine oil sump that stores<br>
engine oil; a solenoid disposed within the engine oil sump; a solenoid sensor<br>
that generates a solenoid signal; and a control module that determines an<br>
actual response time based on the solenoid signal, determines an expected<br>
response time based on system voltage and engine oil temperature, and<br>
diagnoses viscosity of the engine oil based on the expected response time<br>
and the actual response time.<br>
[0008] In still other features, a method of diagnosing engine oil<br>
viscosity is provided. The method includes: determining an actual response<br>
time of a solenoid based on a trigger event and solenoid current; determining<br>
an expected response time based on system voltage and engine oil<br>
temperature; and diagnosing viscosity of the engine oil based on the actual<br>
response time and the expected response time.<br><br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should<br>
be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference<br>
numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein,<br>
the term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an<br>
electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that<br>
executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic<br>
circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described<br>
functionality.<br><br>
[0017] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary engine system 10<br>
includes an engine 12 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive<br>
torque. Air is drawn into an intake manifold 14 through a throttle 16. The<br>
throttle 16 regulates mass air flow into the intake manifold 14. Air within the<br>
intake manifold 14 is distributed into cylinders 18. Although four cylinders 18<br>
are illustrated, it can be appreciated that the engine 12 can have a plurality of<br>
cylinders including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders.<br>
Although the cylinders 18 are shown to be in an inline configuration, it can be<br>
appreciated that the cylinders 18 can alternatively be in a V-shaped<br>
configuration.<br>
[0018] A fuel injector 20 injects fuel that is combined with the air as<br>
it is drawn into the cylinder 18 through an intake port. An intake valve 22<br>
selectively opens and closes to enable the air/fuel mixture to enter the<br>
cylinder 18. The intake valve position is regulated by an intake camshaft 24.<br>
A piston (not shown) compresses the air/fuel mixture within the cylinder 18. A<br>
spark plug 26 initiates combustion of the air/fuel mixture, driving the piston in<br>
the cylinder 18. The piston drives a crankshaft (not shown) to produce drive<br>
torque. Combustion exhaust within the cylinder 18 is forced out through an<br>
exhaust manifold 28 when an exhaust valve 30 is in an open position. The<br>
exhaust valve position is regulated by an exhaust camshaft 32. The exhaust<br>
is treated in an exhaust system. Although single intake and exhaust valves<br>
22,30 are illustrated, it can be appreciated that the engine 12 can include<br>
multiple intake and exhaust valves 22,30 per cylinder 18.<br>
[0019] An engine oil sump 36 couples to the engine 12 and serves<br>
as a reservoir for engine oil. An engine oil pump (not shown) circulates oil<br>
through passages of the engine 12 to provide sufficient pressure for hydraulic<br>
function as well as lubrication and cooling for the engine 12. A viscosity<br>
sensitive solenoid 38 is disposed within the engine oil sump 36, just below a<br>
liquid level. A control module 40 controls the solenoid 38 and diagnoses<br>
engine oil viscosity based on one or more sensory inputs. More particularly,<br><br>
an oil temperature sensor 42 or equivalent algorithm generates an oil<br>
temperature signal based on a temperature of oil within the engine 12. An<br>
engine speed sensor 44 generates an engine speed signal based on a<br>
rotational speed of the crankshaft (not shown). A voltage sensor 46 senses a<br>
voltage of the engine system 10 provided by a power source 48. A current<br>
sensor 50 measures the current of the solenoid 38 and generates a current<br>
signal. Alternatively, a Hall effect sensor senses a changing magnetic flux of<br>
the solenoid 38 or a position sensor senses a position of an armature 54<br>
(Figure 2) of the solenoid 38 as will be discussed in further detail below. The<br>
control module 40 receives the above mentioned signals and diagnoses<br>
engine oil viscosity as will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0020] Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view of an exemplary solenoid<br>
38 having a viscosity sensitive oil flow damper that resides in the oil reservoir<br>
of the engine where ambient pressure acts uniformly on all components of the<br>
solenoid 38. The solenoid 38 generally includes an electromagnetic coil 52<br>
and an armature 54 that is disposed coaxially within the coil 52. The armature<br>
54 is biased to a first position relative to the coil 52 by a biasing force. The<br>
biasing force can be imparted by a biasing member, such as a spring (not<br>
shown in figure 2), or by a pressurized fluid. The solenoid 38 is energized by<br>
supplying current to the coil 52, which induces magnetic force along the coil<br>
axis. The magnetic force induces linear movement of the armature 54 to a<br>
second position. When in the second position, a volume 56 of oil is displaced<br>
by the movement of the armature 54 through a viscosity sensitive orifice 58.<br>
The displacement of oil through the viscosity sensitive orifice 58 results in an<br>
increase in pressure within the volume 56. This pressure acting on the frontal<br>
area of the armature 54 creates a resistive force that slows its movement<br>
which in-turn alters the current draw characteristics of the solenoid 38. As<br>
can be appreciated, at least one of a current sensor, a Hall effect sensor, or a<br>
position sensor can be used to detect the movement of the armature 54. For<br>
ease of the discussion, the remainder of the disclosure will be discussed in<br><br>
the context of the current sensor measuring the current draw of the solenoid<br>
38.<br>
[0021] Figure 3 is a graphical representation of current flowing<br>
through the solenoid 38. The top graph 60 corresponds to the actual current<br>
flowing through the solenoid 38 provided engine oil with three different<br>
viscosities. The bottom graph 62 corresponds to digital current readings. In<br>
both graphs 60 and 62, a trigger signal 64 occurs at approximately 50 ms and<br>
a "valley" shown generally at 66, 67, and 68 exists at approximately 60 ms.<br>
The "valley" 66 in the current readings corresponds to the armature 54 of the<br>
solenoid 38 hitting a mechanical stop. The time delay is the difference in time<br>
between the trigger signal 64 and the "valley" 66, 67, and 68 of the current<br>
readings.<br>
[0022] In the bottom graph 62, state 0 describes the state of the<br>
solenoid 38 before the trigger signal 64 is commanded, state 1 describes the<br>
state of increasing solenoid current, state 2 describes decreasing solenoid<br>
current, and state 3 describes increasing solenoid current after the armature<br>
54 of the solenoid 38 has hit the mechanical stop. The time delay is the time<br>
elapsed between the state 0 to state 1 transition and the state 2 to state 3<br>
transition.<br>
[0023] The time of the state 0 to state 1 transition is the time that<br>
the trigger signal 64 is activated. However, the time for the remaining<br>
transitions is calculated by inspection of the current signal. In state 1, the<br>
current signal increases and has a positive slope. In state 2, the current<br>
signal decreases and has a negative slope. The state 1 to state 2 transition is<br>
when the current slope changes from positive to negative. Since state 3 has<br>
an increasing slope, the state 2 to state 3 transition is determined by the time<br>
at which the current slope changes from negative to positive.<br><br>
[0024] As is commonly known, the derivative of a function<br>
represents the slope of the function. In a discrete domain, an adequate<br>
approximation of the derivative of the current signal can be calculated in order<br>
to determine the slope. Several numerical methods may be employed to<br>
achieve this objective. The simplest is a two-point backward difference<br>
approximation of the derivative. The two-point backward difference<br>
approximation uses the following equation:<br><br>
where y is the approximate derivative of the current signal, yn is the present<br>
sample of the current signal, yn-1 is the previous sample of the current signal,<br>
and h is the time between samples of the current signal.<br>
[0025] The two-point backward difference approximation of the<br>
derivative may be sensitive to signal noise. Approximations with a smaller<br>
degree of error can be calculated, but they generally use additional samples<br>
to achieve accuracy or use non-realtime processing. Therefore, it is<br>
preferable to calculate the derivative of a moving average of the current signal<br>
rather than the current signal directly. Although the moving average of the<br>
samples will help smooth out noise, it is still possible for slight increases and<br>
decreases in the derivative of the slope to prematurely indicate that the<br>
current signal has changed direction. Thus, it is preferable for a change in<br>
slope to persist for several consecutive samples before it is reported. If the<br>
state 2 to state 3 transition is not detected within a predetermined period, a<br>
maximum time (e.g., 50 ms) is reported as the response time of the solenoid<br>
38.<br><br>
[0026] Referring now to Figure 4, a dataflow diagram illustrates<br>
various embodiments of an engine oil viscosity diagnostic system that may be<br>
embedded within the control module 40. Various embodiments of engine oil<br>
viscosity diagnostic systems according to the present disclosure may include<br>
any number of sub-modules embedded within the control module 40. The<br>
sub-modules shown may be combined and/or further partitioned to similarly<br>
control the engine 12. Inputs to the engine oil viscosity diagnostic system<br>
may be sensed from the engine system 10 (Figure 1), received from other<br>
control modules (not shown), and/or determined by other sub-modules (not<br>
shown) within the control module 40. In various embodiments, the control<br>
module 40 of Figure 4 includes an enable module 70, a solenoid response<br>
module 72, an expected response module 74, and a diagnostic module 76.<br>
[0027] The enable module 70 selectively enables the solenoid<br>
control via an enable status indicator 80. The enable module 70 selectively<br>
enables solenoid control based on engine speed 82. If engine speed is zero<br>
or the engine speed is steady, the enable module 70 sets the enable status<br>
80 to TRUE. Otherwise, the enable status 80 remains set to FALSE. The<br>
solenoid response module 72 measures an actual response time 84 based on<br>
a position signal 63. The position signal 63 can indicate at least one of a<br>
solenoid current, an armature position, and a magnetic flux. The solenoid<br>
response module 72 measures an actual response time 84 by monitoring the<br>
position signal 63. In various embodiments, the solenoid response module 72<br>
measures an actual response time 84 by monitoring a solenoid current and<br>
determining a time between an electrical trigger event to the current valley as<br>
discussed above.<br><br>
[0028] The expected response module 74 predicts an expected<br>
response time 88 based on system voltage 92 and oil temperature 90. In<br>
various embodiments, the expected response time 88 is predicted based on a<br>
predefined lookup table that is stored in memory. The indices of the table are<br>
system voltage 92 and oil temperature 90. The response times for selected<br>
system voltage and oil temperature are predefined based on particular oil<br>
viscosities. In various embodiments, the expected response times are initially<br>
based on properties of factory fill oil.<br>
[0029] The diagnostic module 76 diagnoses the engine oil viscosity<br>
based on the actual response time 84 and the expected response time 88.<br>
The diagnostic module 76 computes a difference between the actual<br>
response time 84 and the expected response time 88, divides the difference<br>
by the expected response time 88 to determine a percent error. The<br>
diagnostic module compares the percent error to a threshold percentage. If<br>
the percent error is greater than the threshold percentage, a fault status is set<br>
to Test Fail. If the percent error is less than or equal to the threshold<br>
percentage of the expected response time, the fault status is set to Test Pass.<br>
In various embodiments, if the percent error is less than the threshold<br>
percentage and a total of vehicle miles 93 is less than a mile threshold, the<br>
diagnostic module 76 adapts the expected response time based on the<br>
percent error and stores the adapted expected response time in memory for<br>
later use. Either additionally or alternatively, if the percent error is less than<br>
the threshold percentage and oil life (not shown) is less than a threshold<br>
percentage, the diagnostic module 76 adapts the expected response time<br>
based on the percent error and stores the adapted expected response time in<br>
memory for later use.<br><br>
[0030] Referring now to Figure 5, a flowchart illustrates various<br>
embodiments of an engine oil viscosity measurement method that may be<br>
performed by the control module 40. The method may be run periodically<br>
during engine operation. At 100, enable conditions are evaluated. If the<br>
engine speed is steady or the engine speed is zero at 100, the expected<br>
response time is determined at 110. Otherwise, control proceeds to the end.<br>
At 110, the expected response time is determined based on system voltage<br>
and oil temperature. At 120, the actual response time is determined. At 130,<br>
a percent error is determined based on the difference between the expected<br>
response time and the actual response time. The percent error is evaluated<br>
at 140. If the percent error is greater than a predetermined error threshold at<br>
140, the fault status is set to Test Fail at 150. Otherwise if the percent error is<br>
less than a predetermined error threshold at 140, the total vehicle miles is<br>
evaluated at 160. If the total of vehicle miles is less than a mile threshold at<br>
160, the expected response time is trimmed by the percent error and stored in<br>
memory at 170. Otherwise, if the total of vehicle miles is greater than or equal<br>
to the mile threshold at 160, control proceeds to the end.<br>
[0031] As can be appreciated, once the fault status is set to Test<br>
Fail, additional steps can be performed to notify other systems and users of<br>
the failure. In various embodiments, a diagnostic code is set based on the<br>
fault status. The diagnostic code can be retrieved by a service tool or<br>
transmitted to a remote location via a telematics system. In various other<br>
embodiments, an indicator lamp is illuminated based on the fault status. In<br>
various other embodiments, an audio warning signal is generated based on<br>
the fault status or the engine's hydraulic control function may be limited.<br><br>
[0032] As can be appreciated, all comparisons discussed above can<br>
be implemented in various forms depending on the selected values for<br>
comparison. For example, a comparison of "greater than" may be<br>
implemented as "greater than or equal to" in various embodiments. Similarly,<br>
a comparison of "less than" may be implemented as "less than or equal to" in<br>
various embodiments. A comparison of "within a range" may be equivalently<br>
implemented as a comparison of "less than or equal to a maximum threshold"<br>
and "greater than or equal to a minimum threshold" in various embodiments.<br>
[0033] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can<br>
be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has<br>
been described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope<br>
of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will<br>
become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings,<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
TITLE: "An engine oil viscosity diagnostic system and a method of diagnosing<br>
engine oil viscosity"<br>
The invention relates to an engine oil viscosity diagnostic system, comprising a<br>
solenoid response module (72) that determines an actual response time based<br>
on a position signal; an expected response module (74) that determines an<br>
expected response time (88) based on system voltage and engine oil<br>
temperature; and a diagnostic module (76) that diagnoses viscosity of the engine<br>
oil based on the actual response time (84) and the expected response time (88).<br>
