This invention relates to mechanical/electrical generators and more particularly to improvements in mechanical internal combustion engine and electrical generator combinations for producing electrical energy,<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
From early times man has sought better and easier ways of performing his day to day tasks, which required some form of energy to accomplish. In the earliest of times man could only count on his own energy to cany out these tasks. Eventually he had fire, then domesticated animals, soon he learned to make and use steam, and then came the internal combustion engine. Shortly thereafter came electricity. From fee very beginning of the electric age man recognized the power of electricity, although he didn't know just what to do with it He still used his own hands, the hands of friends, his livestock, steam engines and the internal combustion engine which was growing in popularity with each passing day. Electricity as we have learned, provides us with almost anything we need in the course of our lives from birth to death- Without electricity there would be no refrigerators, microwaves, televisions, radios, computers or a host of other electrified instruments useful to man. One only has to experience an electrical black-out to readily appreciate the vast array of uses electricity has been put to.   As a matter of fact, man has now become almost completely dependent on electricity for every facet of life, whether at work or at home. Without it, be is in the dark, like his cave dwelling forefathers were and yet power failures are more frequent and longer than ever. Some power companies have even resorted to the tactic of strategic black-outs during the worst days of elect<br>
summertime due to the heavy demand of tunning air conditions. One answer to the problem of electrical shortage is to buy more electricity from neighboring producers of electrical power but this is not a long-term solution.<br><br>
WO 02/079625	PCT/US01/09558<br>
Currently there is more demand for electricity. Now uses for electricity are found everyday. As our population grows, new homes spring up everywhere, more factories are built to make more products and to supply jobs for all the new workers and for all that we require even more electricity. While the construction of new power plants is relatively infrequent, the need for emergency electric power generators has become common. Although the demand for emergency generators that are economical to use, dependable and affordable has never been greater this demand will be even greater in the future.<br>
This invention seeks to meet the aforenoted demand and need for a portable, relatively lightweight, highly efficient, economical generator utilizing an internal combustion engine for driving an electro-magnetic coil to produce electrical energy.<br>

Still another object of this invention is to provide an internal combustion engine in which there is prolonged dwell at the bottom of a piston stroke such that each piston carrying cylinder may be cleaned or purged of all spent gases while the piston is generally stationary relative to Us cylinder,<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide prolonged dwell at the bottom of the piston stroke in a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine whereby each cylinder is cleaned, purged and air cooled internally while exhaust valves are held open in a prolonged substantially stationary position.<br><br>
WO 02/079625	PCT/US01/09958<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a two cycle, multiple cylinder and piston, internal combustion engine in which each piston has a prolonged dwell period, such thai a related cylinder exhaust valve is in a complete state of closure prior to the introduction of fuel into the cylinder.<br>
An additional object of this invention is to provide an internal combustion, two cycle engine embodying mean productive of a prolonged dwell at the bottom of each piston stroke such that charging of a cylinder with fuel for the next combustion is accomplished while the piston is generally stationary relative to its cylinder.<br>
A still additional object of this invention is to provide an internal combustion engine employing endless opposed twin cams for regulating piston movement with the twin cams providing an infinitely variable compression stxoke for each piston to optimize combustion of a selectively suitable fuel<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a two cycle style rotary engine embodying cam means capable of dictating multiple firings of each cylinder for each complete engine rotor revolution.<br>

9<br><br>
WO 02/079625	PCT/US01/09958<br>
each having a piston (K), cylinder sleevo (S)t wrist pin (L) and associated combustion chamber 22 (see Fig. 2A).<br>
In Fig. 2A, the assembled relationship of the several parts shown in Fig. 2, as well as the front and back case members (B) and (U) of the engine housing are illustrated. It also will be noted that rotor (H), as shown in Fig. 2, carries six (6) arcuate shaped permanent magnets 24 mounted about its periphery and located between adjacent piston and cylinder assemblies.<br>
From the full cross sectional view of Fig. 2A showing the assembly of parts for the engine/generator, it will be noted that the engine hereof is in many respects similar to the teaching and disclosure of a four cycle engine set forth in my prior United States patent No. 4,653,438 issued March 31, 1987, entitled "Rotary Engine". Certain exceptions to the rotary engine of lhat patent are found in the cylinder assemblies hereof employing threadingly detachable cylinders (I), cylinder sleeves (J), pistons (K), wrist pins (L) and cam rollers (M), which are specifically described in my prior U.S. Patent No. 5636,599, issued June 10, 1997, entitled "improved Cylinder Assembly.<br>
Similarly, each modular poppet valve assembly embodying ireras (V), (W), (X), (Y) and (Z), shown at (N) in Fig. 1 hereof and the enlarged assembly view 1A as well, is more fully described in my United States patent No. 5,701,930, issued December 30,1997, entitled "Modular Valve Assembly". The specifics of the present engine structure, set out in the several above mentioned patents will not be described further herein, except for the marrying of generator and engine and the functional results thereof, as well appear in great particular presently.<br>
In general it is to be understood that the engine portion of the engine/generator comprises a rotor member (H in Fig. 1), which rotates with a main bearing (P in Fig. 1) supported on a central main shaft (Q) which has a number of port openings and internal passageways for the flow of air and fuel to the individual cylinders and piston assemblies,<br>
10<br><br>
(there being six(6) in the particular embodiment hereof) and the eventual exhaust of spent fuel and gases through an exhaust pipe (R) extending coaxially from one end of the main shaft (Q). Operation of the several piston cylinder assemblies (I) is in accordance with the design dictates of a pair of radially separated, opposed twin track cam surfaces 30 and 31 as will be described in greater detail hereafter.<br>
In response to ignition and explosion of a selected fuel in an associated combustion chamber 22 (see Figs. 2 and 2A) at the radially innermost end of each cylinder, an associated piston K moves radially outwardly along the interior of a related cylinder. Wrist pins (L) extending outwardly through elongated slots 25 in the walls of each cylinder (I) interjoin each piston (K) with its associated sleeve member (J); the latter riding over the exterior of its associated cylinder. Cam follower roller assemblies (M) (see Fig. 4), engageable with the opposing cam tracks formed in the two housing halves or cases (B) and (U), regulate radial movements of the pistons within their respective cylinders and relative to the main shaft (Q) to effectively rotatably drive the rotor about the main shaft Q. This described relationship is generally in accordance with the arrangement of parts and operation described more fully in my aforenoted patent No. 4,653,438 although the engine of that patent, is a four-cycle type and thus differs materially from the present engine particularly as to piston movements and piston reversal dictated by the twin cam means of the present engine.<br>
Inasmuch as the current engine is designed to have six (6) cylinders it will be noted from Fig. 2, for example, that opposing cylinder and piston assemblies are fired simultaneously whereby the pistons in those cylinders move in opposite directions simultaneously at diametrically opposed positions. This serves to balance forces from the firing and explosion of fuel in opposed cylinders. In this respect it will be noted from Fig. 2A in particular that the actual ignition and firing of fuel takes place in separate combustion chambers 22 disposed between the valve assemblies (N) and the spark plugs (F) which invade the combustion chambers in a known fashion.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 02/079625	PCT/US01/09958<br>
Figs. 3 and 3A ore quite similar to Figs. 2 and 2A although the spaik plugs (F) are<br>
while the exhaust valve cam follower (2) and the spark plugs (F) are all clearly shown in that<br>
Figure.<br>
Examining both Figs. 3 and 3 A it-will be understood that a piston (K) within cylinder<br>
(I)4 and its associated cylinder sleeve (J) mounted about the exterior of the cylinder are<br>
interjoined by wrist pin (L) which parses through slots 25 in diametrically opposed sides of<br>
the cylinder walls. The cylinder sleeve (J) is formed with cylindrical exterior coaxial<br>
trunnions 26 extending from dianwstrically opposite sides thereof on which are rotatable<br>
mounted cam roller bearings (M). It is apparent that all six cylinder assemblies are equipped<br>
with pistons'(K), sleeves (J), wrist pins (L) and cam roller bearings (M) as above related<br>
As best shown in Figs. 4 and 4A the cam roller beanngs (M) operatively control and harness the movements of the pistons (K) in their respective cylinders. This activity is accomplished by means of twin stationary cam tracks 30 and 31 (see Fig. 4A) which are formed in opposing registration on the inside wall of both outer case housing sections (B) and (U), In operation the roller bearings (M) (except at engine start-up, when engaged briefly with earn surface (31), stay in constant contact with the outer wall or surface 30 of the outer stationary cam track; with the two cam tracks being of sufficient width to provide clearance between the cam roller bearings and the radially innermost wall surface 31 of the opposing cam track.<br>
As shown in Tig, 4, each cam track 30 and 31 is asymmetrical for each half or 180° of rotor rotation during which a complete combustion cycle takes place. This cycle is then repeated again in the opposite 180o of rotor rotation. This twin cam design allows each cylinder to be fired twice per revolution of the rotor and therefore the six cylinder engine of the illustrated embodiment, if running at 1200 rpm for example, produces 1400 complete combustion cycles per minute. Mathematically this result is computed by multiplying six<br>
12<br><br>
cylinders times two firings per revolution which equals 12 complete combustion per revolution. That figure multiplied-by 1206 equals 14,400 complete combustions per minute. This is equal to the fire powt produced by a 24 cylinder conventional four cycle engine running at tlie saine speed oi a, twelya cylinder conventional tyro cycle engine running of the same seed This resultalso may be accomplished by a conventional six cylinder four cycle engine for, example, such as those ccrmmonfy found in most standard automobiles in use today, running at 4800 rpm.<br>
Shown in the elevational view Fig. 4 is the annular exhaust valve cam ring (T) which is securely mounted in the stationary end casing (U) (see Fig. 4A); .Cam T is responsible for opening the poppet exhaust valves atid holding them open fesrfho exhaast valve cam followers (Z) pass over the cam ring in response to the rotational movement of rotor (H). In the normal depiction of the elevational view oft'ig. 4, the exhaust valve cam ring (T) would not be shown or seen. Its full line showing in Fig. 4, however, is helpfiil for a better understanding of this engine. Turning now to Figs. 5 and 5A it will be recognized that insulated electrodes (A) are shown in Fig. 5 even though they arc actually mounted in the missing front case (B) as best shown in Fig. 5A of the drawings. It will be appreciated that the electrodes (A), like the cam tracks and the exhaust valve cam ring (T) ordinarily would not be illustrated in this elevational view of Fig. S inasmuch as the front end case (B) is removed. However, these items are shown in full lines in Fig. 5 for the sake of promoting understanding of the workings of the engine/generator.<br>
Fig. 5 also shows the six arcuate permanent magnets 24 disposed between the outer ends of adjacent cylinders, as previously noted- The stationary coil (C), which is held by and extends axially between the housing cases (IF) and (B), is shown b Fig. 5A along with its output coil wires 33, seen in Fig. 5.<br>
13<br><br>
WO 02/079625	PCT/US01/09958<br>
The main shaft oil lines 34 and oil supply manifold 35 at the inner end of the main shaft (Q) also are sibowa in Fig. 5A.<br>
Fig. 5, like the Figs. 2, 3 and 4, shows the positioning of engine parts at 0° of rotation for the rotor. The air-fuel mixture in the cylinders as shown in the sectional view Fig. 5A, has already been ignited and the pistons (K) shown in full lines in their respective cylinders (1)1 and (1)4 for instance, remain or "re held stationary by cam surface 30 for the next 10° of rotation, neither moving radially in or out appreciably relative to the center line of the engine. This unique static dwell condition permits the ignited air-fuel mixture to bum more completely thereby causing cylinder pressures to reach a maximum potential before piston movement Such action alone provides much greater efficiency and output horsepower as compared to the same volume of fuel consumed in a conventional engine.<br>
Having set forth the character and operation of the basic mechanisms of the engine, attention is directed now to the happenings taking place during a single revolution of the engine's rotor for which purpose atteiation is directed initially to Fig. 6 of the drawings. It will be recognized that Fig. 6 illustrates the unusual character of piston movement and also relates the various happenings and functions taking place during such movement.<br>
Starting at 0° at the left hand aide of the Fig. 6 graph, the combustion dwell is<br>
indicated by line 1 as extending from 0° to 10° of rotor rotation. As mentioned heretofore,<br>
each piston is held during this period in a relatively stationary position in its cylinder. In this condition the ignited air-fuel mixture is allowed to bum more completely, which thereby produces cylinder pressures of maximum potential before allowing the piston to move.<br>
From 10° to 48° the piston is permitted to fall radially outward,' as shown by line 2. This fall of tbe piston is very rapid and steep and produces very high torque at very low revolutions per minute, a condition which is however not always desirable. In the current engine/generator, this is a condition that is quite desirable since there is no outside gearing to worry about. AH of the high torque produced by the engine is absorbed evenly by the entire<br>
14<br><br>
WO 02/079625	PCT/US01/09958<br>
casing in the act of making electricity.  The casing therefore can be made much lighter with no fear or failure caused by heavy unevenly distributed loads applied to it from outside rotational forces.<br>
At 3° prior to the end of piston fall, as indicated by line 2, the exhaust cycle is initiated as shown by line 5, with exhaust dwell beginning at the end of the piston fall. The term "exhaust dwell" is not necessarily accurate When referring to the period of time the piston is relatively stationary at the bottom of its stroke as indicated byline 3. As shown, there is a lot more going on than simply exhausting the cylinder. The exhaust dwell period starts at 48°, while exhaust starts at 45° with a cylinder purge and internal cooling sequence starting at 70°. These operations are im3icated by lines 5 and-6; The exhaust cycle ends at 110°, when the exhaust valve is folly closed. Therefore, compression (line 7) begins at 110° while the cylinder purge and cooling port are still open. At 113 a precompression and charge cycle begins (see line S)&gt; Meanwhile cylinder purge and cooling (line 6) continues to pump fresh air into the cylinder until 120 whereat the purge port closes Which helps to charge the cylinder quickly. At 135° the dwell (line 3) terminates.<br>
At 135° the piston rise (line 4) moves the piston radially inward toward the center of the engine/generator, and preconlpression and charge (line 8) continues until 150° of rotation is reached whereat the pressurized intake port closes. Final compression (line 9) begins at 150° of rotation and continues to 180°, although the compressed air fuel mixture is ignited at 175°. Ignition at this point in the cycle is 5° prior to the next dwell period which commences at 180°; the next combustion dwell (line 1) starting the above described entire combustion sequence all over again.<br>
It will be noted that the functions described and set out in Fig. 6 of the drawings in the form of a graph are shown again in co-relation to the cam track layout illustrated in Fig. 7 of the drawings.<br>

With reference to Fig. 7 the top half of that figure reflects the graph data shown in Fig. 6, while the bottom half of that figure addresses the position of the cam track and piston<br>
relative to the center of the engine/generator main shaft (Q). Exhaust valve cam ring (T) is shown in the center of the layout It is believed that the reader will find Fig. 7 to he self-explanatory particularly when taken in conjunction with Fig. 6 of the drawings. It is further to be noted from the bottom half of Fig. 7 that the position of the cam followers (M) relative to the center line of the engine/generator's main shaft are set out This is indicated by dimensioa A-A at each of six positions of fee cam followers illustrated. B-B is shown as the distance from the outer cam fees to the center of the shaft; C-C is the distance from piston lace to the cylinder bottom and D-P is the length of piston stroke to the next numbered position.<br>
In the remaining drawings 8-13 major events happening inside the engine/generator during one complete combustion sequence are illustrated. For purposes of clarity all these drawings show parts that are normally stationary as rotating and parts that are normally rotating as stationary.<br>
Keferrmg initially to Fig. 8 of the drawings where ignition is occurring, rotor (H) is a t a position of 355° (or 5° prior to the combustion dwell at 0° of rotor rotation). As previously mentioned, fuel is ignited early to provide additional pressures needed to keep the cars roller bearings (M) from launching off the outer face 30 of the cam track at the top of a piston stroke. Insulated electrodes (A) in the front case (B) are in alignment with the spark plug insulators (E) carried is rotor (H). As best shown in Fig. 8A, a spark 37 is jumped across the gap between electrodes (A) and the insulators (E) and concurrently in combustion chamber 22;. it being understood that the two opposing cylinders (3)1 and (1)4, illustrated, counter balance opposing forces on the main shaft (Q) upon ignition of the fresh air/fiiel mixture in the cylinders as described.<br>
16<br><br>
WO02/079625	PCT/US01/09858<br>
The end of combustion dwell is illustrated in Figs/9 and 9A which shows the engine<br>
ignited 15° prior to the end of combustion dwell and the piston remains relatively stationary in its position in the cylinder  during the dwell  Meanwhile the combusted air/fuel mixture has had sufficient time to achieve its optmnun-pressure withitieorabustjop charaber 22. Cam roller bearings (M) are about to start their descent doWntho ooter cam face 30 of the cam track. Since the action of the two opj)dsing cylinders at 180° are performing the same functions simultaneously vibrational effect is substantially eHatfnate&amp;in i&amp;e. engine.<br>
Figs. 10 and lOAiHustrate the condition and position of parts at the end of a combustion stroke with the totor U 48 of roter rotation. 'Bach piston (K) in the two cylinders (1)1 and (1)4 is as far from the center of the engine/generator main shaft (Q) as it will get Exhaust valve cam followers (Z) came; into contact with the elevated sections 41 of the stationary exhaust valve cam ring (T) three degrees (3a) earlier and valve stems (V&gt; are moving away from their seats in the valve bodies (W). These valves will not be fully open for another ! 1 of rotor rotation, but spent gases are already exiting the cylinders past the partially open, valves into the exhaust manifold ring 42 which is inset into the exterior perimeter of the main shaft (Q), Exhaust gases travel along the exhaust manifold ring until they reach ports that connect there exhaust manifold ring to tne exhaust pipe (R)(R). These exhaust ports are shown best ia Fig. I2A of the drawings at 43 and 44.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10A the exhaust gases can be seen leaving the engine/generator at 45 through the exhaust pipe (R).<br>
It will be understood that Fig. 3 OB is a blown up portion of section 10A-10A of the cross sectional Fig. 10A keeping in mind that all the parts which are normally stationary are shown as rotating, it will be noted that two main shait cooling ports 46 are shown in the mam shall (Q), The exhaust pipe (R; is only in contact with the main shall where it is threadkigly attached to (Q) as indicated at 50, For the rest of its length tlirough the main<br>

shaft and the end case (U)m pipo (R) is provided with circumferential clearance to allow for free flow of cooling air 51 which RS drawn in from the outside of the engine/generator, past the bottom end case (U) and the lower portion of the main shaft, to flow about the outside diameter of the exhaust pipe and out through the two cooling ports 46 to the front of the engine. Since the back end f the engine tends to be warmer due to the exhaust and the front of the engine tends to be cooler, due to the intake of fresh air and fuel mixture, the temperature differential has an equalizing effect on the mam shaft<br>
Referring hack to the Fig. 10 it will be noted that the present position of the insulated electrodes (A) and the two cylinder sleeves 9J) shown with full and hidden lines at (1)3 and (DC) 6 are only 7° from the start of their combustion sequence whereat the insulated electrodes (A) come into alignment with their respective spark plug insulators (B).<br>
Figs. 11 and 11A show the engine/generator of this invention at 90° of rotor rotation at which position the exhaust cycle has been active for 45° of rotation and is designed to continue for another 20° before valve stem (V), which is fully open, as shown in Fig. 11 A, will fly close.<br>
Importantly, the cylinder purge cycle starts 20° earlier and will continue for another 30° of rotation. Both of these operations are completed when the pistons (K) are still in the same relatively stationary position relative to the cylinders as they were in at there end of their combustion stroke 42° earlier. In fact from this point, the pistons remains relatively stationary for another 45° of rotation. The exhaust valve cam followers (2) (see Fig. 1IA) are fully elevated at the extended raised plateaus 41 of the stationary exhaust valve cam ring (T). As a result, the valve stems (V) are fully open and have been held fully open for 31 ° at this stage. Such valve stems will continue to be held fully open for another 6°. Also, note that the main sliait (Q) cylinder purge and cooling ports 53 are now shown.<br>
It should be noted that the present position of the two cylinder sleeves (1)3 and (1)6, shown in full andhiddeu lines, are at 30" of rotation just slightly past halfway through their<br>
18<br><br>
WO 02/079625	PCT/US01/09958<br>
combustion strokes. Both of the as cylinder are prodducing trenipxjdous: amounts of rotational fbtce on the rotor (H). Also, at fhistiine&amp;e two cylinder sleeves (1)2 and (I)$; which are shows in -&amp;H lines with no hidden lines are just starting their final combustion cycle and are only 25° from their next ignition and 30° from their next combustion dwell.<br>
In Fig. 1 IB, which is a blow-up ofthecentralpoxtibn of cross sectional Fig. UA.the two-purge and cylinder cooling ports 53 are clearly seen. The triangular shape of thcTactual port openings into the cylinder can be seen in the elevatibnal view of Fig. 11 at 54. In Fig. MB one can also see the compound angles of cooKngpott 55, as it aligns with the combustion chamber.<br>
Although the exhaust valve stem (V) is fully open, as indicated at 56, purge and cooling air is directed by way of the angular partial port opening 55, thereby forcing the cooling air past the fiilly open valve stem 56, through the combustion chamber, past the spark plug and into the cylinder, across the top of the piston and then back out of the cylinder through the open exhaust valve assembly. As this purge and cooling air escapes past the open exhaust valve assemblies it also cools the rotor exhaust ports 58, the main bearing exhaust ports 59, the exhaust manifold ring 42 in the main shaft (Q), the exhaust ports in the main shaft 5 (see 44 of Fig. J2A) and the exhaust pipe (R), as well as the engine/generator exhaust.<br>
This described action represents the second and third systems for cooling the engine/generator; the fust having been seen m Fig. 10B where cool outside air is drawn in from the back of the engine/generator and out through the main shaft through ports 46. The pre-heated air which is drawn out of ports 46 in Fig. 10B is used either fully or partially in the cylinder purge and cooling pons 52 in Fig. ] IB. This provides an advantage in more closely controlling the internal temperatures of the engine for better combustion results. When the engine is cold, this system is effective to improve combustion by drawing cold air in around the exhaust pipe (R) as indicated by the circumferential clearance 57 to preheat such air as it<br>
19<br><br>
WO 02/079625	PCT/US01/09958<br>
chambers. Conversely jt is desirable when the engine is running hot under a heavy load or extene outside temperature, to use fresh air or a blend of fresh air and preheated air to achieve the best internal operating temperatures for the engine.<br>
Hie third method of cooling this engine is byway of lubricating oil which is sprayed on the cylinders and rotor assembly near the combustion chambers when the engine/generator Is ruamrjg.<br>
In Figs. 12 and 12A the enguWgenerator is depicted at 120° of rotation. The exhaust valves have been folly closed for 10° of rotation, the purge and cooling ports have just closed completely and the precompression and cylinder charge ports started to open 7° earlier at 113°. The pistons <k in cylinders and remain substantially stationary will that way for another while the cleaned purged are charged with a ftesh charge of air fuel. it can be seen intake port m main shaft branches off into two separate rectangular branch ports which precompression cylinder ports. as these aliga combustion chamber rotor filled precompressed fresh air-fuel mixture. exhaust also seein they connect she manifold ring to pipe. is shown manner emphasize its circular or round cross sectional shape. at k more reflective actual view through section although understood both same diameter running angle mirror images one another.></k>
Exhaust gases are visible in the exhaust manifold ring and exhaust ports (Fig. 12A) although the exhaust valves and ihe cylinders shown in Fig. 12a are both closed. The reason for this is that the cylinders (1)3 and (06 are in their exhaust cycle while the cylinders (1)2 and (1)5 are just beginning combustion dwell having had ignition 5° eai licr as can be seen by ihe position of the insulated electrodes (A) (fig. 12).<br>

The final Figs rotation The rotor is io a cycle of f^oal compressiotttJurins-^vbich all valves, of course, arectosed to the corabustion-ohanibcrs. T^io pistons (K) in cylmderi (1)1 and (T)4 iJlostxatfid in these figures -started to move radially inwardly toward their combustion cycle '-15° earlier and for the last 30° will continue toward the center of flic engine/generator. This is caused by the cam follower bearings (M) in contact with theinclining outer cam track surface 30. After25° of rotation the spark plugs will again ij*nite the air/fuel mixture within tile cylinders and the engine will be back to where it startediin the first ;drawiiigs of this series CFig. $X but on the opposite side of the engine. The cylinders 1(2) and 1(5) as1 shown in Fig. 12, that we're in the beginning of their combustion dwell in Pi&amp; J2, are ndw-slibwn in Fag. 13 appttodmately half way down the declining slope of the cam track face 30m the combustion cycle. At this time both of the cylinders 1(2) and 1(5) are producing and transmitting large amounts of rotating force to rotor (H).<br>
It will be recognized that the foregoing explanation associated with the Figs. 1-13A have foliowed the events occurring in one half of one fiill revolution of the engine/generator. In Figs. S-13, only 180° of natation is involved. During this 180° travej, each of the six cylinders fires one time. It is to be recognized by one familiar with the interior workings of a typical engine that the herein disclosed engine represents a giant leap forward in the search fora power dense, economical, dependable and reliable source of electrical power useful for virtually any and all portable, as well as stationary applications.<br>
