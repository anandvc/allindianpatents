				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a brake shoe for use in an internal shoe drum brake and the subject matter of this invention is divided out of co¬pending Application No. 687/MAS/92 (Indian Patent No. 181129).<br>
In the co-pending application no.687/MAS/92, there is described an internal shoe drum brake, primarily for a motor vehicle, and of the general kind having a pair of brake shoes mounted on a backplanes and separable by an actuator into braking engagement with a rotary brake drum, one pair of adjacent shoe ends providing shoe tips slid ably engaged respectively with oppositely directed faces of a fixed abutment which resists braking torque applied to the shoes from the rotating drum during braking.<br>
In two-leading shoe or Duplex drum brakes, the shoes have generally similar operating characteristics and their lining thickness and actuate extent, as well as their abutment shoe tips can be identical. The shoes are, therefore, interchangeable, leading to considerable cost savings in terms of reduced parts inventory and simplified production. Such interchangeability of the shoes also provides safety benefit in that risk of incorrect assembly is considerably reduced.<br>
The operating characteristics of some Simplex brakes require different specific orientations of the respective abutment shoe tips and the abutment surfaces on which they are supported in order to achieve the desired performance from this type of brake. The leading shoe in some such brakes tends to wear the more rapidly and is traditionally provided with a thicker lining than the trailing shoe. Such a brake is, therefore, inherently expensive to produce and carries an attendant risk of incorrect assembly of the brake shoes. Standardizing the thickness and actuate extent of the shoe lining in such a brake requires the angles of the abutment surfaces to differ substantially from each other and positioning of<br><br>
the  shoe  tip contact points at specific  locations on  the abutment is also necessary.    Such requirements can be incorruptible with the  brake geometry of existing brakes and  unsatisfactory performance can  result.<br>
An object of the  invention is to provide a brake shoe which permits  interchange ability of  shoes  in a Simplex type   internal  shoe drum brake,  and a brake incorporating a plurality of  such shoes.<br>
According  to  the   invention,   the  shoes of a brake of  the aforesaid general kind  have  shoe  tips each formed by  two differently directed  surface portions and the shoes are arranged  so that the abutment is engaged respectively by non-corresponding shoe  tip surface portions of the  shoes,  one  of  the  surfaces of  the abutment engaged by  the  shoe  tips diverging from the other surface  in a direction away from the centre of  the brake.<br>
Preferably,  the  shoe  tip surfaces are  mutually divergent in a direction away from the centre   line  of  the brake.<br>
In one preferred embodiment,   the  abutment surfaces engaged  by the  shoe  tips are differently  inclined and  the shoe   tips engage  the abutments  respectively at different locations there along.<br>
In a  typical practical example,   the  angles made respectively by the  leading and  trailing  shoe  abutments with a  line extending  through the centre  of the brake perpendicular to  the abutment may be  between  10° and   20° and preferably 17° for the  leading shoe,   and between 0° and   10° and preferably 4° for the  trailing shoe.<br><br>
Conveniently,   at least one of  the  shoe   tip  surface portions of each shoe  is arcuate  and,   typically both portions are accurate and arranged  so  that the centres of the  respective arcs are non-coincident.    The arcuate  shoe tip  surface portions may have different radii,   being typically about lOOmm and  about 60mm,<br>
Typically the arcuate  shoe  tip surface portions on each shoe are  arranged  so that the  lines passing through the  centre points of  the  surface portions and  the respective  centres of  the arcs  intersect.<br>
Preferably,   the  lining  thickness of the  two  shoes, and  conveniently the  arcuate extent of  the  linings also, are  identical.<br>
From another aspect of  the  invention,  a brake  shoe for use  in the aforesaid  internal  shoe drum brake comprises an arcuate platform carrying a lining of friction material on one  side  thereof and a web extending generally perpendicularly from the  other side  of  the platform and providing a shoe  tip at least one end thereof for engagement with  the brake abutment,   the  shoe tip being formed by at least two arcuate  surface portions having non-coincident centres of arc,   the  surface portions being arranged  so that the  lines passing through the  centre points of  the  surface portions and  the respective centres of  the  arcs  intersect.<br>
This arrangement enables  the discontinuity between the  arcuate  surface portions on each  shoe  to be minimized,<br>
Preferably,   the  arcuate  surface portions have different radii,  being  typically about 100mm and  about<br><br>
60mm.<br>
The  invention will  now be described,  by way of example, with  reference  to the  accompanying drawings  in which:-<br>
Figure   1  is a  front view of one  form of the  internal shoe drum brake  of  the  invention;<br>
Figure  2  is a  fragmentary front view illustrating part of the brake  of Figure   1  to an enlarged  scale,   and<br>
Figure   3  is a detail  illustrating diagrammatically an alternative embodiment of the brake of  the  invention.<br>
Referring  to Figure   1 of  the drawings,   this illustrates an  internal  shoe drum brake which has a backplate  1 vipon which are  mounted brake  shoes  2 and   3, each having a platform 2a,   3a carrying a  lining of friction  material  2b,   3b on  the outer face  thereof,   the inner face having  a web  2c   ,3c extending perpendicularly from approximately  the   lateral centre  of  the platform,   in conventional manner.     The  thickness of  the  linings  2b,   3b is  identical,   being  chosen  to provide  the  required wear life.     The outer ends of the webs form shoe  tips,  of which  those   2d,   3d  respectively engage  tappet heads 4,   5 forming part of an  actuator 6 operable  to expand  the shoes outwardly  into braking engagement with a surrounding rotary brake drum (not shown) .    The forward direction of drum rotation  is  indicated by arrow A.     The shoe  tips at the  other ends of  the webs engage  an abutment device  7 which is fixed  to or integral with the backplate  1 and  serves  to  react the  torque  forces imparted  to  the  shoes by the drum during braking.<br><br>
Details of  the  abutment 7 and  the   shoe  tips which engage   it are  illustrated more clearly  in Figure  2,     The abutment has a pair of oppositely facing abutment surfaces  7A/   7B which are  respectively  inclined  at different angles aL and aT relative  to  the  centre  line C of  the brake,  which passes through the brake centre C* and   is directed at right angles to the  abutment.     The angle  aL is  the  inclination of the  leading  shoe  abutment surface and aT is the equivalent angle  for the  trailing shoe  abutment surface.     It will be  seen that the inclination aL of  the  abutment surface 7A  is greater  than that of aT of the  abutment surface  7B,     In  this embodiment,  angle aL and angle aT denote  the   leading and trailing abutment angle  respectively and can be  chosen according  to the desired brake characteristics.       In practice,  each of  the  abutment surfaces  forms  the base  of a  slot within which  the  associated  shoe  tip  is engaged for restraint perpendicular to the backplate   1,<br>
The abutment shoe  tips of  the  two  shoes are identical and each comprises a pair of arcuate edge surface portions designated   respectively Tl and T2,   In this embodiment,   the  surfaces Tl,  T2 have   identical radii,  but are  struck from different centres  spaced respectively at either side  from a  line X which,   for convenience,   is the  radial centre  line  through a notional shoe  tip  formed by a  single  arc.     It will be  seen  that, for the  leading  shoe,  the  shoe  tip portion Tl contacts the  abutment 7A at a point CI on the abutment; conversely,   for the  trailing shoe,   the  shoe  tip portion T2 contacts the abutment 7B at a point C2.<br>
As will be  understood by those versed  in the  art, the  arcuate  shoe  tips pivot on the abutments during brake actuation and  also slide therealong as  lining wear<br><br>
r<br>
occurs.     In order to optimise  the  brake geometry,  the<br>
contact point CI of  the   leading shoe  for  the unworn  shoe condition  is arranged  to be   in  the  region of the longitudinal centre  of the abutment surface  7A and will move downwardly as  lining wear occurs.     For the  trailing shoe,   the  initial position of  the  contact point C2 is towards the  top of  the  abutment surface  7B  and will  move towards the  longitudinal centre of  this  surface  as lining wear occurs.    The  radii Rl,  R2 of  the   respective  surfaces Tl,   T2 are  chosen,   for the particular abutment angles illustrated,   in order to provide  the desired brake geometry.<br>
In  the particular arrangement  illustrated,   the<br>
respective  radii Rl,  R2 of the  shoe  tip portions of each<br>
shoe  are equal and   the  arcs of  these portions are  struck from points SI,  S2 which lie  to either side of the<br>
corresponding line X referred  to above.    As  shown,   the<br>
points SI,  S2  are  unequally spaced  from this  line,  but<br>
these  spacings may be varied  as desired,  and may be<br>
equal.     The  striking of  the  arcs from such different<br>
centres results in these arcs being differently directed<br>
in order to achieve the required different points of<br>
contact of the arcs with the  respective abutments.     It<br>
may alternatively be possible to use different arcs<br>
struck from a single centre of different centres to<br>
achieve the  same effect.<br>
Because the  shoe lining thickness and  the abutment shoe  tips of the two shoes are  identical,  it will be  seen that the shoes may be interchanged for use at either side of the brake and the operative surfaces of  the shoe  tips will be transposed so that the  shoe  tip portion Tl of shoe  2 will contact the  abutment at C2 and  the  shoe  tip portion T2 of shoe   3 will contact the abutment at C1,  for<br><br>
IT<br>
the  unworn lining condition of  the  shoes.<br>
The differently shaped surface portions of the respective abutment shoe  tips may be varied as desired, as may the angles of the  abutment surfaces 7A,   7B consistent with the  required brake geometry.    For exanple, although both shoe  tip portions of each shoe have been described and illustrated as arcuate,it may be possible for one  shoe tip portion to be planar.    When both portions are arcuate,  the degree of curvature of  the respective portions may differ substantially, depending upon the angles of the abutment surfaces on the abutment, one of which may be parallel  to the centre  line C of the brake, or substantially so.  It would also be possible for each shoe  tip to have more  than two portions.    Moreover, by making the shoe tips of each shoe  identical with each other,   it would be possible to provide a shoe which is interchangeable  as between the  actuator and  abutment ends of the brake,  as well as from side  to side thereof. Whilst the  invention has been described  in relation to a single web shoe,  it could equally be applied to a shoe of twin or multi-web configuration.<br>
In the alteimative embodiment illustrated  in Figure 3,   the shoe tip portions Tl and T2 of each shoe tip are of different radii Rl,  R2 and   struck respectively from different centres Si, S2.    Typical values for the radii Rl and R2 are approximately lOOmm for Rl and approximately 60mm for R2,    The abutment surfaces 7A,   7B in this embodiment are angled respectively at 17° and 4° relative  to the centre line C which passes through the brake centre and  is directed at right angles to the abutment 7,  as  in  the embodiment of Figures  1 and  2.     In use,   the  shoe tip portion Tl of  the   shoe  2  rests on  the abutment surface  7A at point Cl and  the shoe tip portion<br><br>
T2 of the shoe 3 rests on the abutment surface 7B at point C2, as<br>
previously, performing pivotal and sliding movements during brake<br>
operation and in the course of lining wear.<br>
It will be seen that by providing a pair of identical brake shoes in which the abutment shoe tips are composed of a plurality of shoe tip portions, it is possible to use two identical brake shoes in a simplex brake, even with widely varying abutment angles. Moreover, ease of manufacture is considerably increased by the reduction in parts and the chance of incorrect assembly of the shoes in the brake is very much reduced since either shoe can be used at either side of the brake.<br>
In all embodiments of the shoe of the invention in which the shoe tips far engagement with the abutment have a pair of arcuate surface portions with non-coincident centres of arc, the surface portions are arranged so that the lines passing through the centre points of the surface portions and the respective centres of the arcs formed by these surface portions intersect. This arrangement enables the two surface portions to merge with the minimum possible interruption at their junction.<br><br><br><br>
