				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a refrigerant leak preventive structures for a heat exchanger and method for forming the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a refrigerant leak-preventive structure in a heat exchanger of a refrigerator, in which refrigerant pressurized by a compressor to a high temperature and high pressure or a low temperature and low pressure flows. The refrigerant leak-prevention structure prevents leakage of refrigerant and introduction of external air both of which are generated at bonded sections between refrigerant tubes and headers. However, the heat exchanger of the invention is not restricted only to the refrigerator. Description of the Related Art<br>
[002] A refrigerator includes a compressor, a condenser, a throttle valve and an evaporator all of which constitute a system operation in the order named. In the refrigerator, heat is absorbed in the evaporator while more heat is discharged out of the refrigerator via the condenser. In particular, the condenser and the evaporator function as a heat exchanger by absorbing and discharging heat.<br>
[003] The conventional heat exchanger performs heat<br>
exchange of refrigerant with a pair of metal refrigerant tubes for introducing or discharging refrigerant, headers fixed to both ends of the metal refrigerant tubes and a plurality of fins formed in outer peripheries of the metal refrigerant tubes. In particular, the fins and the refrigerant tubes are coupled by using expansion of the refrigerant tubes and thus typically have a predetermined gap between the metal bodies.<br>
[0004] Owing to the metal structure, however, the conventional heat exchanger made of metal has a problem in that noises are generated at contact points between the metal bodies in on/off operation of the refrigerator, thereby causing inconvenience to the user. In order to improve this problem, a plastic heat exchanger is generally used at present.<br>
[0005] Fig. 1 illustrates a conventional plastic heat exchanger in the form of a tri-tube heat exchanger having an integral structure of a fin, a refrigerant tube and a defrosting tube.<br>
[0006] Referring to Fig. 1, the conventional plastic heat exchanger 112 includes a refrigerant tube, a fin and tube group or fin-tubes group 118 which is defined by combining a number of fins and defrosting tubes, fin-tubes group headers or headers 12 0 disposed at both ends of the fin-tubes group 118, right and left header tanks 124 and 126 extended from the headers 120. In particular, the fin-tubes group 118 indicates an array of ducts, in which at least a refrigerant tube and<br>
fins are integrally formed in each duct.<br>
[0007] A method of fabricating the above plastic heat exchanger, in particular, for bonding the fin-tubes group 118 and the headers 12 0 has been disclosed in US Patent Application Serial No. 09/954,056, which will be briefly described as follows.<br>
[0008] The undesignated reference numbers 130 and 132 indicate an inlet tube and an outlet tube of refrigerant, respectively.<br>
[0009] Fig. 2 illustrates a process of combining the fin-tubes group 118 and the headers 120.<br>
[0010] Referring to Fig. 2, the process of combining the fin-tubes group 118 and the headers 120 includes: primarily forming plastic into the fin-tubes group 118; double extruding at both ends of the plastic fin-tubes group 118 to form the headers 12 0; and placing thermal fusion jigs 13 6 into interspaces of the plastic headers 12 0 in a supporting fashion and thermal pressing an upper central portion of the fin-tubes group 118 using a thermal fusion apparatus 12 8 having thermal fusion molds 134 to thermal fuse the fin-tubes group 118 and the headers 12 0 more strongly.<br>
[0011] In particular, the thermal fusion molds 134 are in the shape of an overturned triangle so that ends of the fin-tubes group 118 are flared strongly bonding to the header 120. The non-described numeral 140 indicates power lines.<br>
[0012] The headers 120 are thermal fused to both ends of the fin-tubes group 118 according to the above fusion process, thereby possibly preventing abnormal noise from occurring in on/off operation of a refrigerator which has been a problem in the conventional heat exchanger made of metal.<br>
[0013] In particular, since the fin-tubes group 118 is bonded to the header 12 0 via thermal fusion, there are advantages in that the plastic heat exchanger 112 is readily fabricated and the manufacturing cost thereof can be reduced.<br>
[0014] Where the conventional heat exchanger 112 constructed according to the above bonding process is utilized as an evaporator, refrigerant is introduced under an atmospheric pressure (e.g., 0.9 to 1 atm.) similar to the atmospheric pressure and thus refrigerant leak or introduction owing to differential pressure may not take place.<br>
[0015] However, where the conventional heat exchanger 112 is utilized as a condenser, refrigerant having a high temperature and pressure (e.g., 9 to 10 atm.) is introduced as heated and pressurized by a compressor.<br>
[0016] In this circumstances, there is a problem that the high pressure of refrigerant opens between the fin-tubes group 118 and the headers 120 which are bonded through thermal fusion and thus refrigerant leaks through openings formed as above.<br>
[0017]  Furthermore, when refrigerant leaks from the heat<br>
exchanger 112 as above, it is impossible to maintain the refrigerant pressure within the condenser 112 in a set cooling cycle or the refrigerant pressure of the entire cooling cycle. As the refrigerant pressure is decreased as above, the refrigerator fails to properly perform the cooling cycle while the discharged quantity of refrigerant may not correspond to the set temperature of the refrigerator.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT [0029]  Reference will now be made in detail to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention with reference to the<br>
attached drawings.<br>
[003 0] Fig. 3 is an exploded perspective view and a partially enlarged view of a heat exchanger of the invention.<br>
[0031] Explaining a refrigerant leak-preventive structure of a heat exchanger 212 of the invention with reference to Fig. 3, the refrigerant leak-preventive structure includes refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 formed at both ends of a fin-tubes group 218 and refrigerant leak-preventive projections 221 which are formed by injection molding solution<br>
flowing into the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 during the injection molding of fin-tube headers 220.<br>
[0032] For example, each of the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 is formed on an outer periphery of a refrigerant tube 214 having a high pressure in the fin-tubes group 218. In particular, each of the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 is formed in a spiral configuration on the outer periphery of the fin-tubes group 218.<br>
[0033] The refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 are preferably formed at. least on the refrigerant tubes 214 of the fin-tubes group 218.<br>
[0034] By the injection molding, the refrigerant leak-preventive projections 221 are formed in a configuration which is substantially identical with that of the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215.<br>
[0035] The refrigerant leak-preventive structure of the heat exchanger having the above construction shows a refrigerant leak prevention operation, which will be described in detail as follows.<br>
[0036] When refrigerant of a high pressure is introduced into the heat exchanger 212 from a compressor, the high pressure of the refrigerant is applied to fused faces between the fin-tubes group 218 and the headers 220 of the heat exchanger 212 which were bonded through thermal fusion under<br>
high pressure.<br>
[0037] In order to solve the above drawback, the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 having the spiral configuration are formed on the outer peripheries of the both ends of the refrigerant tubes 214 of the heat exchanger 212 through which refrigerant is introduced under high pressure, and the fin-tube headers 22 0 are formed to enclose the both ends of the fin-tubes group 218 having the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 by a double injection molding, thereby fixing the headers 220 to the both ends of the fin-tubes group 218 .<br>
[0038] During the double injection molding of the headers 22 0, the injection molding solution flows into and then cooled in the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215, to form the refrigerant leak-preventive projections 221 on the outer peripheries of the both ends of the fin-tubes group 218.<br>
[0039] The injection molding permits the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 to have a substantially identical configuration with the refrigerant leak-preventive projections 221. That is, the refrigerant leak-preventive projections 221 are formed integral with the headers 220 by the double injection molding in a state that they are correspondingly engaged with the fin-tubes group 218.<br>
[0040]  As the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 and<br>
the refrigerant leak-preventive projections 221 are engaged into a corresponding fashion as above, the strong engaging force due to the tooth-shaped engagement between the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 and the refrigerant leak-preventive projections 221 does not allow the refrigerant to flow out to the outside although the refrigerant of high-pressure leaks in the bonded faces between the fin-tubes group 218 and the headers 22 0.<br>
[0041] In other words, the corresponding engagement between the fin-tubes group 218 and the headers 220 allows strong and reliable bonding and makes the leak paths complicated, thereby effectively restraining refrigerant leak.<br>
[0042] Fig. 4 is a flow chart illustrating a forming process of the heat exchanger of the invention.<br>
[0043] Referring to Fig. 4, the forming process of the fin-tubes group 218 and the headers 220 includes the steps of: forming the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 on the outer peripheries of the ends of the fin-tubes group 218, in particular, of the refrigerant tubes 214 through which high pressure refrigerant flows (ST 101) ; double injection-molding the headers 220 at the ends of the fin-tubes group 218 (ST 102) ; and thermally fusing the fin-tubes group 218 and the headers 220 via jigs and a heating source (ST 103).<br>
[0044]   The   thermal   fusing  step   (ST   103)   may  be<br>
substantially identical with a conventional method and thus detailed description thereof will be omitted hereinafter.<br>
[0045] According to the above process, the fin-tubes group 218 is coupled with the headers 22 0 in such a fashion that the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 and the refrigerant leak-preventive projections 221 are formed, so that leak of the refrigerant is effectively prevented.<br>
[0046] Fig. 5 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0047] Referring to Fig. 5, a plurality of refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 216 are formed in the shape of a separate ring on outer walls at both ends of a refrigerant tube 214 of the fin-tubes group 218. In case where the aforementioned ring-shaped refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 216 are applied, refrigerant leak-preventive projections 221 are also formed in a ring shape during their double injection molding.<br>
[0048] The configurations of the above refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 and 216 are not restricted to the aforementioned examples such as the spiral shape and the circular shape. The refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 and 216 may be at least two repeatedly formed so as to perform the identical function. Further, those skilled in the art who understand the invention may readily contemplate other shape<br>
of refrigerant leak-preventive grooves performing equivalent or similar functions.<br>
[0049] Fig. 6 illustrates the operation of the refrigerant leak-preventive structure of the heat exchanger of the invention.<br>
[0050] As shown in Fig. 6, after pressurized to a high temperature; and high pressure (e.g., 9 to 10 atm. ) in a compressor, refrigerant is introduced into the heat exchanger 212 where it is condensed through heat exchange with external air through a cooling cycle of the refrigerator. The high pressure of the refrigerant allows a high pressure to be applied between the fin-tubes group 218 and the headers 22 0 constituting the heat exchanger 212.<br>
[0 051] However, the refrigerant leak-preventive grooves 215 of the invention together with the refrigerant leak-preventive projections 221, which are formed simultaneous with double injection molding of the fin-tubes group 22 0, strongly couples the fin-tubes group 218 with the headers 220, thereby preventing leak of refrigerant.<br>
[0052] Even though the high pressure causes refrigerant to leak at all, leaked refrigerant is blocked from further flowing out owing to the complicated leak paths and adhering force applied in several directions so that refrigerant leak can  be  substantially  prevented.     As  a  result,   this<br>
construction can maintain the refrigerant pressure at a proper level in a refrigerant-cycling system, thereby ensuring reliability in the operation of the refrigerator.<br>
[0053] Non-described numerals 224 and 226 indicate right and left header tanks, and 23 0 indicates an inlet tube of refrigerant..<br>
[0054] The refrigerant leak-preventive structure of the heat exchanger of the invention having the above construction can be applied to the condenser, in which refrigerant pressurized up to the high temperature and high pressure (e.g., 9 to 10 atm.) in the above compressor is condensed through heat exchange with external air. The refrigerant leak-preventive structure of the invention can be also applied to an evaporator to restrict leak of refrigerant and introduction of external air.<br>
[0055] As an effect, the invention can prevent refrigerant leak which may minutely flow out between the fin-tubes group and the headers of the heat exchanger.<br>
[0 056] Moreover, the invention further enhances the pressure-resistant strength of the heat exchanger so that it can properly cope with elevated refrigerant pressure which is set in the cooling cycle.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
