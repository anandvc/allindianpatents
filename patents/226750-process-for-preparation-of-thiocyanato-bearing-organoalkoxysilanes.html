				<td>Specification<br>
PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF THIOCYANATO-BEARING<br>
ORGANOALKOXYSILANES<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a production process for thiocyanato-bearing<br>
organoalkoxysilanes.<br>
[0002]<br>
In the prior art, there existed methods for producing thiocyanato-bearing alkoxysilanes,<br>
which are represented by compounds such as thiocyanatoalkylalkoxysilanes. For instance,<br>
Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. Hei 12-229989 (equivalent to<br>
US6005129) proposed a process for producing thiocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane by reacting<br>
γ-chloropropyltriethoxysilane with sodium thiocyanate in ethanol under elevated pressure.<br>
However, this process had the procedural disadvantage that the ethanol had to be removed<br>
upon termination of the reaction by distillation or other means. In addition, because the<br>
reaction was a pressure reaction, it required special pressure reaction equipment, which was<br>
economically disadvantageous, etc.<br>
[0003]<br>
The present inventors arrived at the present invention as a result of studies directed towards<br>
the elimination of the above-described problems. It is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a process for producing thiocyanato-bearing alkoxysilanes in a high yield, with high<br>
productivity.<br>
[0004]<br>
The present invention relates to a "process for the preparation of (D) thiocyanato-bearing<br>
organoalkoxysilanes represented by the general formula (3) NCS-R1-Si(OR2)nR33-n (where<br>
R1 is a divalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R2 and R3 are monovalent<br>
hydrocarbon groups, and the subscript n is 0 to 3), in which (A) a thiocyanic acid salt<br>
represented by the general formula (1) MSCN (where M stands for an alkali metal) and (B) a<br>
halogenated alkylalkoxysilane represented by the general formula (2) XR1Si(OR2)nR33-n<br><br>
(where X is a halogen atom, and R1, R2, R3, and the subscript n are the same as above) are<br>
reacted in the presence of (C) a phase transfer catalyst."<br>
[0005]<br>
To explain this further, the thiocyanic acid salt (A) represented by the general formula (1)<br>
MSCN (where M stands for an alkali metal) is one of the raw materials used in the reaction,<br>
with the alkali metal M in the formula above exemplified by lithium, sodium, potassium, and<br>
rubidium. Of them, sodium and potassium are preferable. Such thiocyanic salts are<br>
exemplified by sodium thiocyanate and potassium thiocyanate. If the hydrolyzability of<br>
component (B) is high, component (A) causes a decrease in yields; for this reason, it is best<br>
used when thoroughly dried. Well-known conventional methods utilizing heating under<br>
reduced pressure or methods, in which azeotropic dehydration is carried out by adding an<br>
organic solvent, etc. can be employed in the drying operation. If the hydrolyzability of<br>
component (B) is low, component (A) does not have to be dehydrated and can be used in the<br>
form of an aqueous solution. The amount of the present component is preferably in the range<br>
of from 0.1 mol to 2.0 mol, and even more preferably, in the range of from 0.5 mol to 1.5<br>
mol.<br>
[0006]<br>
The halogenated alkylalkoxysilane of (B), which is represented by the general formula (2)<br>
XR1Si(OR2)nR33-n(where X is a halogen atom, R1 is a divalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to<br>
6 carbon atoms, R2 and R3 are monovalent hydrocarbon groups, and the subscript n is 0 to 3),<br>
is also one of the raw materials used in the reaction, with the X in the formula above<br>
representing halogen atoms exemplified by chlorine and bromine atoms. The divalent<br>
hydrocarbon groups of R1 are exemplified by methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene,<br>
isobutylene, and other alkylene groups. The monovalent hydrocarbon groups of R2 and R3<br>
are exemplified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, and other alkyl groups; vinyl, allyl, and<br>
other alkenyl groups; and phenyl, tolyl, and other aryl groups. Such halogenated alkylsilanes<br>
are exemplified by γ-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane, γ-chloropropyltriethoxysilane, γ-<br>
chloropropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ-chloropropylmethyldiethoxysilane, γ-<br>
chloropropyldimethylmethoxysilane, γ-chloropropyldimethylethoxysilane, δ-<br>
chlorobutyltrimethoxysilane, β-chlorobutylmethyldimethoxysilane, δ-<br><br>
chlorobutyltriethoxysilane, γ-chloro--methylpropyltrimethoxysilane, γ-chloro--<br>
methylpropylmemyldimethoxysilane, γ-chloro--methylpropyltriethoxysilane, γ-<br>
bromopropyltrimethoxysilane, γ-bromopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, and γ-<br>
bromopropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
[0007]<br>
The phase transfer catalyst of (C), which is used to promote the reaction between component<br>
(A) and component (B), is exemplified by tributylammonium bromide,<br>
trioctylmethylammonium chloride, and other quaternary ammonium salts;<br>
tributylphosphonium chloride and other quaternary phosphonium salts; triethylamine, and<br>
other tertiary amines; crown ethers; polyethylene glycols; 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undeca-7-<br>
ene (DBU), l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-nona-5-ene (DBN), and other cyclic amine compounds.<br>
The amount of the phase transfer catalyst is preferably in the range of from 0.0001 mol to 20<br>
mol, more preferably, in the range of from 0.001 mol to 10 mol, and even more preferably, in<br>
the range of from 0.001 mol to 5 mol per 1 mol of component (B).<br>
[0008]<br>
In the preparation process of the present invention, component (A) and component (B) are<br>
reacted in the presence of component (C), with the reaction temperature at such time being<br>
preferably between 30°C and 180°C, and, even more preferably, between 100°C and 160°C.<br>
The reaction time may differ depending on the type and amount of component (A),<br>
component (B), and component (C); however, it typically lasts from 30 minutes to 15 hours.<br>
[0009]<br>
In the preparation process of the present invention, component (B) serves both as a reaction<br>
substrate and as a solvent, which eliminates the need for a special organic solvent. However,<br>
organic solvents that are inert to component (A), component (B), and component (C) may be<br>
used if necessary. Such organic solvents are exemplified by toluene, xylene, octane, and<br>
dimethylformamide.<br>
[0010]<br><br>
In the preparation process of the present invention, upon termination of the reaction between<br>
component (A) and component (B), it is preferable to remove salts produced as by-products<br>
and contained in the reaction product using filtration, dissolution in water, or other means. In<br>
addition, if necessary, further purification can be carried out by means of distillation.<br>
[0011]<br>
Following the preparation process of the present invention ensures that (D) thiocyanato-<br>
bearing organoalkoxysilanes represented by the general formula (3) NCS-R1-Si(OR2)nR33-n<br>
(where R1, R2, R3 and the subscript n are the same as above) will be obtained in a high yield.<br>
Such thiocyanato-bearing organoalkoxysilanes are exemplified by γ-<br>
thiocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane, γ-thiocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane, γ-<br>
thiocyanatopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ-thiocyanatopropylmethyldiethoxysilane, γ-<br>
thiocyanatopropyldimethylmethoxysilane, γ-thiocyanatopropyldimethylethoxysilane, 5-<br>
thiocyanatobutyltrimethoxysilane, γ-thiocyanatobutylrnethyldimethoxysilane, 8-<br>
thiocyanatobutyltriethoxysilane, γ-thiocyanato--methylpropyltximethoxysilane, γ-<br>
thiocyanato--methylpropylmethyldimethoxysilane, and γ-thiocyanato--<br>
methylpropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
[0012]<br>
The thiocyanato-bearing organoalkoxysilanes obtained in accordance with the preparation<br>
process of the present invention as described above can be useful without any further<br>
treatment in applications such as silane coupling agents; in addition, they can be suitably<br>
employed as starting materials in the synthesis of other sulfur-containing organoalkoxysilanes<br>
or sulfur-containing organopolysiloxanes.<br>
Application Examples<br>
[0013]<br>
Below, the present invention is explained in detail by referring to application examples.<br>
Application Example 1<br>
[0014]<br><br>
106.9g (1.10 mol) potassium thiocyanate, 240.8g (1.00 mol) γ-chloropropyltriethoxysilane,<br>
and 0.77 g (0.005 mol) 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undeca-7-ene (DBU) as a catalyst were placed<br>
in a 500-mL four-neck flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a stirrer, and a temperature<br>
gauge and subjected to agitation for 6 hours at 150°C. Subsequently, reaction by-products<br>
were removed by filtering off the reaction product. 242.3g (0.92 mol) of the target γ-<br>
thiocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane were isolated by distilling the filtrate under reduced<br>
pressure. The yield of the γ-thiocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane was 92%.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
[0015]<br>
The reaction was conducted in the same manner as in Application Example 1, except that the<br>
1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undeca^-ene (DBU) was not added to the 500-mL four-neck flask<br>
equipped with a reflux condenser, a stirrer, and a temperature gauge; the target<br>
thiocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane was not produced at all.<br>
Application Example 2<br>
[0016]<br>
106.9g (1.10 mol) potassium thiocyanate, 198.7g (1.0 mol) γ-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
0.77g (0.005 mol) l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undeca-7-ene (DBU) as a catalyst, and 30g toluene<br>
were placed in a 500-mL four-neck flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a stirrer, and a<br>
temperature gauge and subjected to agitation for 10 hours at 125°C. Water was added to the<br>
resultant reaction product to induce phase separation, and reaction by-products were<br>
removed. 199.2g (0.90 mol) of the target γ-thiocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane were isolated<br>
by distilling the toluene layer under reduced pressure. The yield of the γ-<br>
thiocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane was 90%.<br>
Application Example 3<br>
[0017]<br>
106.9g (1.10 mol) potassium thiocyanate, 182.7g (1.0 mol) γ-<br>
chloropropylmethyldimethoxysilane, and 1.61g (0.005 mol) tetrabutylammonium bromide as<br>
a catalyst were placed in a 500-mL four-neck flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a<br><br>
stirrer, and a temperature gauge and subjected to agitation for 12 hours at 120°C.<br>
Subsequently, reaction by-products were removed by filtering off the reaction product.<br>
180.7g (0.88 mol) of the target γ-thiocyanatopropylmethyldimethoxysilane were isolated by<br>
distilling the filtrate under reduced pressure. The yield of the γ-<br>
thiocyanatopropylmethyldimethoxysilane was 88%.<br>
[0018]<br>
