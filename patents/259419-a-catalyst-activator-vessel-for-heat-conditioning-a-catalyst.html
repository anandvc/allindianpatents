LARGE CATALYST ACTIVATOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to a catalyst activator for heating the catalyst<br>
and conditioning it with a gas. The invention relates more particularly to a catalyst activator<br>
for conditioning olefin polymerization catalysts.<br>
Many solid catalyst compositions, such as those employed in hydrocarbon<br>
conversion operations, e.g., polymerization, cracking, dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and<br>
the like, are activated by subjecting the raw catalyst to elevated temperatures for an interval<br>
of time, while passing over the catalyst a stream of conditioning fluid which is inert, non-<br>
oxidizing, non-reducing, oxidizing, reducing, dry, or the like, depending on the particular<br>
nature of the catalyst and its intended use. One of the common objects of such treatment is<br>
the removal of moisture from the catalyst, since water is a catalyst poison in many<br>
applications.<br>
Catalyst activation processes comprise drying an activating fluid such as air<br>
and passing it through a catalyst bed at a constant rate, while applying heat, until the catalyst<br>
reaches the desired temperature, at which point the catalyst is held at the activation<br>
temperature for the proper length of time. However, solid catalyst compositions are often<br>
relatively impermeable, thus requiring a shallow bed in order to obtain the required flow of<br>
activating fluid. The bed thus becomes large and expensive.<br>
To alleviate the deficiencies encountered in activating solid particulate<br>
catalysts, including the continuous removal of impurities and catalyst poisons from the<br>
activation zones and temperature control of the bed, fluidized activation processes have been<br>
developed. In these processes, the catalyst is fluidized with a stream of activating fluid at<br>
elevated temperatures.<br>
One type of fluidized bed catalyst activator has a grid plate through which<br>
fluidizing gas flows upwardly to levitate particulate matter, forming the fluidized bed. The<br>
upper surface of the grid plate is machined with an array of generally conical depressions that<br>
overlap essentially completely so the upper surface of the grid plate has no flat surfaces on<br>
which catalyst particles can accumulate and escape the conditioning effect of the fluidizing<br>
gas.<br>
In one known catalyst activator the grid plate (see Figure 1) is nominally 1.13<br>
inch (28.58 mm) thick (dimension a, Figure 1), has an inside diameter of 42 inches (1,07 m),<br><br>
and the generally conical depressions are predominantly 90-degree (angle b, Figure 1) conical<br>
depressions having a nominal depth of one inch (25.4 mm) (dimensions a-c), a nominal<br>
diameter d at the upper major surface of 2.078 inches (52.78 mm), spaced apart in each<br>
direction by 1.781 inches (45.2 mm) from center to center, thus overlapping by about 16.7%.<br>
The nominal layout of a single 90-degree conical depression of the 42-inch<br>
(1.07 m) grid plate is shown in Figure 1. This known grid plate has 418 90-degree conical<br>
depressions, and around the outside periphery, where there is less clearance allowed to drill<br>
depressions, the grid plate has eighteen 70.5-degree conical depressions and twelve 60-degree<br>
conical depressions, for a total of 448 conical depressions of the three sizes provided. The<br>
depth of each type of conical depression is the same. The apex of each conical depression<br>
was bored through to the lower surface of the grid plate by drilling a 0.078 inch (1.98 mm)<br>
diameter (dimension e), 0.125 inch (3.175 mm) deep (dimension c) bore.<br>
As polymerization reactors have increased in size or number at a given plant<br>
location, the amount of catalyst needed has increased, and a need has arisen to increase the<br>
amount of catalyst activated at a given time.<br>
One approach to this problem is to provide more than one catalyst activator.<br>
This approach has the problem of requiring more equipment, operating personnel and other<br>
resources, including the vessels, sensors, piping, wiring, and computer capacity, than one<br>
catalyst activator.<br>
Another approach to this problem is to operate a catalyst activator of the same<br>
diameter as before, but with a deeper fluidized bed of catalyst. A problem created by this<br>
approach is that a deeper fluidized bed allows less activation air and more activation effluent<br>
from the fluidized bed to contact each particle of the catalyst, which may reduce the quality<br>
of the resulting activated catalyst.<br>
Yet another approach, increasing the diameter of the activator, has previously<br>
been rejected for at least two reasons.<br>
First, increasing the diameter of the inner vessel reduces its surface area<br>
exposed to flue gases, as a proportion of the interior volume. As the diameter increases, the<br>
wall surface area of the inner vessel increases proportionally to the increase in diameter,<br>
while the volume of the inner vessel (assuming the depth of the vessel remains constant)<br>
increases proportionally to the square of the increase in diameter. Also, the heat must be<br>
transferred further to reach the center of a larger-diameter vessel. These effects reduce the<br>
amount of heat transferred per unit volume, per unit time, and per particle of the catalyst in<br>
the inner vessel.<br>
Second, increasing the diameter of the grid plate that establishes a fluidized<br>
bed, and the size of the catalyst charge the grid plate is required to support, increases the<br>
weight of the grid plate, the diameter the grid plate must span, and the weight of catalyst the<br><br>
grid plate must bear. Simply scaling up the grid plate dimensions would require the grid<br>
plate to be quite thick to support both its own weight and that of a larger catalyst charge over<br>
a greater span. The depressions milled into the surface of the grid plate to eliminate flat areas<br>
further exacerbate this problem, as a considerable amount of metal is removed to form the<br>
depressions, thus effectively decreasing the thickness of the grid plate.<br>
Thus, simply scaling up the catalyst activator is not a satisfactory solution to<br>
the problem of processing more catalyst per batch.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the invention is a catalyst activator vessel for heat conditioning<br>
a catalyst. The activator vessel includes inner and outer vessels, a perforated, normally<br>
generally horizontal grid plate within the inner vessel, and a fluid path extending through the<br>
grid plate within the vessel.<br>
The inner vessel can enclose a catalyst charge. The outer vessel generally<br>
surrounds the inner vessel. The space between the inner and outer vessels defines a flue.<br>
The perforated grid plate within the inner vessel has an upper surface and a<br>
lower surface. The upper surface has a pattern of generally conical depressions that overlap<br>
by at least 17%. The grid plate is perforated by holes extending from the generally conical<br>
depressions through its lower surface. The fluid path extends upwardly through the<br>
perforated grid plate and is defined by a conduit along which fluidizing gas flows through the<br>
grid plate. The fluidizing gas will fluidize a particulate material, such as a catalyst, disposed<br>
above the grid plate in the inner vessel.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a catalyst activator vessel for heat<br>
conditioning a catalyst, in which the inner vessel has an inside diameter of at least 50 inches<br>
(1.27 m), the grid plate is more broadly defined as a normally generally horizontal, perforated<br>
grid plate disposed in the inner vessel, and other features are as described in the first aspect of<br>
the invention.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a fluidization bed comprising a vessel, a<br>
normally generally horizontal, perforated grid plate disposed in the vessel, and a fluid path<br>
extending upwardly through the grid plate. The grid plate and fluid path are defined above.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a perforated grid plate having an upper<br>
major surface perforated with a pattern of generally conical depressions and an opposed<br>
lower major surface, wherein the generally conical depressions overlap by at least 17%.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
As used in this specification:<br><br>
"Generally," "normally," or "substantially," as in the phrases "generally<br>
horizontal," "an outer vessel generally surrounding said inner vessel," "generally conical<br>
depressions," generally cone-shaped," "generally funnel-shaped," "generally cylindrical<br>
portions," "normally disposed below the level of said outer margin," "substantially at said<br>
apex," and any others, is broadening language intending to embrace both a feature that is<br>
shaped, oriented, or located either exactly or approximately, and either fully or partially, as<br>
described in the balance of the phrase.<br>
For example, a "generally horizontal" grid plate as defined in this<br>
specification can have a portion that is not horizontal - such as its outer flange. The entire<br>
plate can be not exactly horizontal, as it may have a concavity of 5 degrees or more below a<br>
horizontal plane, or it can be tilted somewhat out of a true horizontal orientation when in use,<br>
and still is regarded as "generally horizontal" herein. When a "generally horizontal" structure<br>
as defined here is not in use, it may be disposed in any orientation, even vertical, and still be<br>
"generally horizontal" as defined herein, providing it would be at least nearly horizontal<br>
when in normal use.<br>
"Upper" and "lower" are defined with respect to a normal orientation of an<br>
article or part when used as contemplated in this specification.<br>
"Overlapping," as in "overlapping, generally conical depressions," indicates<br>
two structures or surfaces that intersect in a finite region, so each structure or surface is<br>
interrupted by the other. "Completely overlapping" means that the overlap extends in an<br>
unbroken circle all the way around the conical depression in question, while "partially<br>
overlapping" is indicative that the overlap does not extend in an unbroken circle, but is<br>
broken at least at one point about the circumference of the depression. Percentage overlap<br>
refers to the amount, expressed as a percentage, by which the nominal diameter of a<br>
depression exceeds the center-to-center spacing between the depression and the nearest<br>
adjacent depression. A representative calculation of percentage overlap is provided in this<br>
specification.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
While the invention will be described in connection with one or more aspects,<br>
it will be understood that the invention is not limited to those aspects. On the contrary, the<br>
invention includes all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within<br>
the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br>
Figure 1 represents the prior art, and is discussed in connection with Figure 5<br>
below.<br>
Figure 2 shows a catalyst activator 10 according to the present invention for<br>
heat conditioning a catalyst. The illustrated activator 10 includes an inner vessel 12, an outer<br>
vessel 14 generally (here, partially) surrounding the inner vessel 12, a perforated grid plate<br>
16, and a fluid path 18 defined in part by the perforations in the grid plate 16. These<br>
perforations are illustrated in the remaining Figures.<br>
The activator 10 of this aspect of the invention further includes a furnace 20<br>
having a gas burner 22 and an air supply 24 supplying combustion air. The furnace 20 has a<br>
flue 26 communicating with the outer vessel 14 and a smoke stack 28 also communicating<br>
with the outer vessel 14 to take away the exhaust from the furnace 20. Thus, the space<br>
between the inner and outer vessels 12 and 14 defines part of the flue that exchanges heat<br>
with the inner vessel 12 to heat the catalyst charge 30 when the charge is within the inner<br>
vessel 12. Any source of heat, such as electrical resistance heating, high temperature fluid, or<br>
high pressure steam, can also or instead be used to heat the activator 10. The specific heating<br>
arrangement employed here is not critical to the practice of the invention.<br>
One surprising feature of the present invention is that the inner vessel 12 can<br>
be scaled up from a nominal 42-inch (1.07 m) inner diameter to a nominal 60-inch (1.52 m)<br>
inner diameter, thus approximately doubling the area of the grid plate 16 while increasing the<br>
surface area of the inner vessel 12 by less than 50%, and thus decreasing the surface area of<br>
the inner vessel 12 per unit volume within the inner vessel 12, without substantially reducing<br>
the rate at which the contents of the inner vessel can be heated to the very high temperature<br>
(800°F to 1700°F, 427°C to 927°C) required for activation. The same rate of temperature<br>
increase achieved in the 42-inch (1.07 m) vessel can be achieved in the 60-inch (1.52 m)<br>
vessel by raising the flue gas temperature only a small amount.<br><br>
While the inventor does not wish to be bound by the accuracy of the following<br>
theory, he theorizes that the heat transfer rate into the inner vessel 12 is unexpectedly-;high<br>
because much of the heat is transferred in the form of radiant heat, which transfers at a rate<br>
proportional to the fourth power of the temperature difference of the objects between which<br>
the heat transfer occurs. In other words, when the catalyst charge is relatively cool compared<br>
to the temperature of the flue gas, the rate of heat transfer to the catalyst charge is extremely<br>
high, so it quickly approaches the intended temperature. Also, a relatively small increase in<br>
the flue gas temperature causes a relatively large increase in the rate of radiant heat transfer,<br>
compared to the corresponding increase in convective or conductive heat transfer:<br>
The activator 10 has a source 32 of a fluidizing medium, which in this aspect<br>
of the invention is nitrogen gas, although other gases, such as dry air, or potentially liquids<br>
may find use as a fluidizing medium, depending on the conditions required to activate the<br>
catalyst charge 30. The fluidizing medium 32 is introduced via the fluid path 18 upward<br>
through the grid plate 16 into the catalyst charge 30, with sufficient fluid velocity and under<br>
other conditions suitable to fluidize the catalyst charge 30. The fluidizing medium 32 also<br>
contacts the catalyst particles and optionally conditions them. For example, to remove<br>
moisture from the catalyst charge, the fluidizing medium 32 may be a dry preheated gas that<br>
will entrain or allow evaporation of moisture.<br>
The fluidizing medium 32 and any effluent from the catalyst charge 30, such<br>
as fines and moisture, flows upward within the inner vessel 12 from the catalyst charge 30 to<br>
effluent treatment apparatus generally indicated as 34 of this aspect of the invention, which<br>
takes moisture and other effluents out of the fluidizing medium 32, and returns most of the<br>
fines to the catalyst charge 30.<br>
In this aspect of the invention, the catalyst charge 30 to be conditioned is<br>
introduced from a catalyst supply 36 via a catalyst introduction conduit 38. In this aspect of<br>
the invention, the catalyst charge 30 is introduced into the inner vessel 12 by conveying it on<br>
a stream of inert fluid, such as nitrogen gas.<br>
In this aspect of the invention, the conditioned catalyst charge 30 is removed<br>
from the inner vessel 12 via a drain 40 which extends from a drain hole 42 at the center of the<br>
grid plate. When the catalyst charge 30 is being conditioned, a cap 44 is set in the drain hole<br>
42, blocking it. To remove the catalyst charge 30, the cap 44 is raised out of the drain hole<br>
42 by elevating a plunger 46 connected by a plunger rod 48 to the cap 44. The fluidized bed<br>
will then drain through the drain 40 into a suitable vessel, such as the tote bin 50 shown in<br>
Figure 2. Instead of discharging the catalyst charge 30 to the tote bin 50, the catalyst charge<br>
could alternatively be discharged directly to a reactor requiring the catalyst, although the<br>
illustrated arrangement is desirable for a direct fired activator, so the activator will not be a<br>
source of ignition for any release of hydrocarbon from the polymerization reactor equipment.<br><br>
Figures 3-7 show different parts of the grid plate 16 of the catalyst activator of<br>
Figure 2. Figure 3 shows one quarter of the grid plate 16. Referring now especially to Figure<br>
4, the grid plate 16 is normally generally horizontal, having an upper major surface 52<br>
perforated with an array of generally conical depressions such as 54 and 56 (the depressions<br>
56 are shown only in Figure 3), a lower major surface 58, an outer flange 60 defining an outer<br>
margin 62, and a concave or lower center 64 normally disposed below the level of the outer<br>
margin 62. An "array" as used here is defined to include a patterned array or a randomized<br>
array. One example of a patterned array is a triangular array, more particularly an equilateral<br>
triangular array, as illustrated by this aspect of the invention. Another example of a suitable<br>
patterned array is a square array. The array may have a regular pattern or a randomized<br>
pattern. For any type of array, it may be desirable to ensure that no substantial amount of<br>
land or horizontal surface area be provided between the depressions.<br>
The words "concave" and "concavity" are used to define the position of the<br>
center in relation to the outer margin, and are defined broadly so as to include upper major<br>
surfaces that are either linear or curved.<br>
In this aspect of the invention the concavity in the upper major surface 52 is<br>
defined by an approximately 5.5° radial downward slope from the outer margin 62 to the<br>
center 64. Therefore, the upper major surface 52 is generally cone-shaped, its outer margin<br>
62 defining the base and its center 64 defining the apex of the cone. This slight concavity or<br>
departure from an absolutely horizontal upper major surface 52 is provided so the grid plate<br>
16 will drain when the charge 30 of catalyst is to be removed from the inner vessel 12.<br>
The grid plate 16 has a drain aperture 42 located substantially at its apex or<br>
center 64 for passing treated particulate material down through the grid plate.<br>
The grid plate 16 upper major surface 52 has a nominal diameter of at least 43<br>
inches (1.09 m), alternatively at least 44 inches (1.12 m), alternatively at least 45 inches (1.14<br>
m), alternatively at least 46 inches (1.17 m), alternatively at least 47 inches (1.19 m),<br>
alternatively at least 48 inches (1.22 m), alternatively at least 49 inches (1.24 m), alternatively<br>
at least 50 inches (1.27 m), alternatively at least 51 inches (1.3 m), alternatively at least 52<br>
inches (1.32 m), alternatively at least 53 inches (1.35 m), alternatively at least 54 inches (1.37<br>
m), alternatively at least 55 inches (1.4 m), alternatively at least 56 inches (1.42 m),<br>
alternatively at least 57 inches (1.45 m), alternatively at least 58 inches (1.47 m), alternatively<br>
at least 59 inches (1.5 m), alternatively at least 60 inches (1.52 m) (as in the illustrated aspect<br>
of the invention), alternatively at least 62 inches (1.57 m), alternatively at least 65 inches<br>
(1.65 m), alternatively at least 70 inches (1.78 m), alternatively at least 75 inches (1.91 m),<br>
alternatively at least 80 inches (2.03 m), alternatively at least 85 inches (2.16 m), alternatively<br>
at least 90 inches (2.29 m), alternatively at least 95 inches (2.41 m), alternatively at least 100<br>
inches (2.54 m), alternatively at least 105 inches (2.67 m), alternatively at least 110 inches<br><br>
(2.79 m), alternatively at least 115 inches (2.92 m), alternatively at least 120 inches (3.05 m).<br>
The diameter of the portion of the upper major surface 52 that is drilled with apertures is<br>
about 58 inches (1.47 m) in this aspect of the invention.<br>
Figures 3, 4, and 7 show the layout of the 90° conical depressions such as 54,<br>
mostly shown as full hexagons in Figure 3 (except for the marginal 90° conical depressions<br>
54, which have a partially circular outer periphery). The 70.5° conical depressions 56 fit into<br>
the periphery where there is insufficient room for a 90° depression. The depressions 56 all<br>
have partially hexagonal, partially circular outlines.<br>
The conical depressions; 54,56 are laid out in an equilateral triangular array,<br>
made up of a first family of equidistant parallel imaginary lines such as 66, crossed by a<br>
second family of equidistant parallel imaginary lines such as 68. The lines of the second<br>
family form angles of 60 degrees relative to the lines of the first family. The crossing points<br>
of the imaginary lines 66 and 68 locate the centers of the generally conical depressions 54<br>
and 56. Other patterns of conical depressions are also contemplated.<br>
In this aspect of the invention, the pitch or spacing between the adjacent<br>
parallel lines 66 or the adjacent parallel lines 68 is 1.5 inches (38.1 mm). This is closer<br>
spacing than was used in the 42-inch (1.07 m) prior art activator discussed in the background<br>
section, in which the pitch was 1-25/32 or 1.781 inches (45.2 mm). Alternatively, the pitch<br>
can be 1.78 inches (45.2 mm), alternatively 1.77 inches (45.0 mm), alternatively 1.76 inches<br>
(44.7 mm), alternatively 1.75 inches (44.5 mm), alternatively 1.74 inches (44.2 mm),<br>
alternatively 1.73 inches (43.9 mm), alternatively 1.72 inches (43.7 mm), alternatively 1.71<br>
inches (43.4 mm), alternatively 1.7 inches (43.2 mm), alternatively 1.69 inches (42.9 mm),<br>
alternatively 1.68 inches (42.7 mm), alternatively 1.67 inches (42.4 mm), alternatively 1.66<br>

alternatively 1.43 inches (36.3 mm), alternatively 1.42 inches (36.1 mm), alternatively 1.41<br>
inches (35.8 mm), alternatively 1.4 inches (35.6 mm), alternatively less than any of the<br>
previously stated values. Still smaller alternative pitches are also contemplated. One family<br>
of pitch lines may also be further apart than the other family of pitch lines, or the pitch lines<br><br>
may be different distances apart in different areas of the surface, without departing from the<br>
present invention.<br>
In this aspect of the invention, the pitch was specified to obtain a desired<br>
number of holes, and the number and diameter of holes was specified to give the desired total<br>
required gas flow. The fluidization gas velocity through the holes was held the same as the .<br>
rate previously used for a 42-inch catalyst activator so that particle attrition was not<br>
increased. This was accomplished by making the increased number of holes per unit area of<br>
grid proportionally smaller.<br>
One advantage of reducing the pitch is that the depth of the conical depression<br>
required to provide fully overlapping depressions is reduced, which means that more of the<br>
thickness of the grid plate remains to support the weight of the grid plate and the catalyst.<br>
Another advantage of reducing the pitch is to increase the number of holes among which the<br>
flow is divided, so the distribution of the fluidizing medium is more uniform. Improved<br>
uniformity in the fluidization medium, resulting from the shorter distances between adjacent<br>
jets or sources of the fluidization medium, assures improved contact of the fluidization<br>
medium with the catalyst. This improves the uniformity and quality of the catalyst.<br>
Referring to Figure 5, the 90° conical depressions 54 as milled into the upper<br>
major surface 52, without considering any of the overlapping depressions, are conical, and<br>
have circular margins 70. The conical depressions of the 42-inch (1.07 m) prior art grid plate<br>
(see Figure 1) were generally conical as well. The nominal diameters of the 90° conical<br>
depressions of the 42-inch (1.07 m) prior art grid plate were 2.078 inches (52.78 mm). The<br>
nominal diameters of the present 90° conical depressions can be 2.07 inches (52.6 mm),<br>
alternatively 2.06 inches (52.3 mm), alternatively 2.05 inches (52.1 mm), alternatively 2.04<br>

alternatively 1.86 inches (47.2 mm), alternatively 1.85 inches (47.0 mm), alternatively 1.84<br>
inches (46.7 mm), alternatively 1.83 inches (46.5 mm), alternatively 1.82 inches (46.3 mm),<br>
alternatively 1.81 inches (46.0 mm), alternatively 1.8 inches (45.7 mm), alternatively 1.79<br>
inches (45.5 mm), alternatively 1.78 inches (45.2 mm), alternatively 1.77 inches (45.0 mm),<br>
alternatively 1.76 inches (44.7 mm), alternatively 1.75 inches (44.5 mm), alternatively 1.74<br>
inches (44.2 mm), alternatively 1.73 inches (43.9 mm), alternatively 1.72 inches (43.7 mm),<br>
alternatively 1.71 inches (43.4 mm), alternatively 1.7 inches (43.2 mm) in diameter,<br><br>
alternatively less than any of the previously stated values. In the aspect of the invention<br>
illustrated, the diameters of the conical depressions at the base are 1.813 inches (46.05 mm).<br>
The depths of the generally conical depressions in the 42-inch (1.07 m) prior<br>
art grid plate were uniformly one inch (25.4 mm), and the nominal thickness of the 42-inch<br>
(1.07 m) prior art grid plate was 1.125 inches (28.6 mm), so the depth of the generally conical<br>
depression was 89% of the nominal thickness of the plate. The depths of the generally<br>
conical depressions in the illustrated aspect of the invention are 0.91 inch (23.1 mm), and the<br>
nominal thickness of the grid plate is 1.625 inches (41.3 mm), so the depth of the conical<br>
depressions is 56% of the nominal thickness of the plate. Alternatively, the ratio of<br>
depression depth to nominal plate thickness can be 80%, 79%, 78%, 77%, 76%? 75%, 74%,<br>
73%, 72%, 71%, 70%, 69%, 68%, 67%, 66%, 65%, 64%, 63%, 62%, 61%, 60%, 59%, 58%,<br>
57%, 56%, 55%, 54%, 53%, 52%, 51%, 50%, or less.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the margins of the non-peripheral depressions 54 are<br>
regular hexagons, in a plan view, because the generally conical depressions overlap<br>
essentially completely; their nominal base diameters are greater than their pitch. Where two<br>
adjacent conical depressions overlap, they intersect along a curved line 72 that is a segment<br>
of a circle lying in a plane perpendicular to the|major surface 52. Viewed from above (Figure<br>
3) or in section (Figure 4), the overlap appears as a straight line. Figure 7 shows that the<br>
overlapping generally conical depressions 54 have six scallops defining their margins. This<br>
configuration is illustrated as well in Figure 1, which shows the scalloped edges out of the<br>
plane of the section.<br>
In the 42-inch (1.07 m) prior art grid plate, the pitch was 1.781 inches (45.2<br>
mm), and the nominal base diameters of the generally conical depressions were 2.078 inches<br>
(52.78 mm), so the degree of overlap was:<br>
((2.078 /1.781)- 1) x 100% = 16.7%.<br>
In one aspect of the present grid plate 16, the pitch is 1.5 inches (38.1 mm), and the nominal<br>
base diameters of the generally conical depressions 54 are 1.813 inches (46.05 mm), so the<br>
overlap is 20.86%. Alternative degrees of overlap contemplated here are 17%, 17.1%,<br>
17.2%, 17.3%, 17.4%, 17.5%, 17.6%, 17.7%, 17.8%, 17.9%, 18%, 18.1%, 18.2%, 18.3%,<br>
18.4%, 18.5%, 18.6%, 18.7%, 18.8%, 18.9%, 19%, 19.1%, 19.2%, 19.3%, 19.4%, 19.5%,<br>
19.6%, 19.7%, 19.8%, 19.9%, 20%, 20.1%, 20.2%, 20.3%, 20.4%, 20.5%, 20.6%, 20.7%,<br>
20.8%, 20.9%, 21%, 21.1%, 21.2%, 21.3%, 21.4%, 21.5%, 21.6%, 21.7%, 21.8%, 21.9%,<br>
22%&gt;, or more.<br>
Another way of viewing the distinction between the present invention and the<br>
prior art is that, in the present invention, the generally conical depressions are shallower, as a<br>
proportion of the thickness of the grid plate, but more overlapped, so there are more<br>
perforations per square inch or mm of the grid plate surface.<br><br>
Comparing Figures 1 and 5, another difference between the present grid plate<br>
of Figure 5 and the prior art grid plate of Figure 1 is the configuration of the perforations 74<br>
of the present invention, versus the perforations 76 of the prior art. The prior art perforation<br>
76 is a simple bore having a diameter of 0.078 inch (1.98 mm) and a length of 1/8 inch (3.18<br>
mm), drilled in the apex of the generally conical depression.<br>
The perforation 74 of the present invention is a compound bore having an<br>
upper portion or neck or second generally cylindrical portion 78 and a lower or first generally<br>
cylindrical portion 80. The portion 78 communicates with the conical depression and has a<br>
diameter of 0.063 inch (1.59 mm), or less than 0.078 inch (1.98 mm), and a length of 1/8 inch<br>
(3.18 mm). Alternatively, the portion 78 can have a smaller diameter, such as 1/32= inch<br>
(0.031 inches, 0.79 mm). The portion 80 has a diameter of 0.25 inch (6.35 mm) and a depth<br>
of about 0.4 inch (10 mm), including a tapered back wall. Since the perforation 74 of the<br>
present invention is much longer than the perforation 76 of the prior art, and has a smaller<br>
diameter, it is more easily drilled by drilling the smaller-diameter part of the compound bore<br>
from above, and drilling the larger-diameter part of the compound bore from below. Since<br>
the very small diameter part of the bore is short, the very small drill bit is much less likely to<br>
shear off when the bores are being drilled.<br>
The present invention can be distinguished from the prior art by the number of<br>
perforations in the grid plate 16. If the prior art 42-inch (1.07 m) grid plate (which has a field<br>
of holes 20 inches (508 mm) in radius, and 448 perforations), were simply scaled up to 60<br>
inches (1.52.m) (with a field of holes 29 inches (737 mm) in radius) with the same pitch, it<br>
would have approximately:<br>
448 (29 / 20)2 = 941 perforations<br>
The present 60-inch (1.52 m) grid plate has 1338 perforations, which is about 397 more than<br>
the number of perforations it would have if it were merely scaled up. Alternatively, the<br>
present 60-inch (1.52 m) grid plate has at least 1000, alternatively at least 1050, alternatively<br>
at least 1100, alternatively at least 1150, alternatively at least 1200, alternatively at least<br>
1250, alternatively at least 1300, alternatively at least 1350, alternatively at least 1400,<br>
alternatively at least 1450, alternatively at least 1500, alternatively at least 1550, alternatively<br>
at least 1600, alternatively at least 1650, alternatively at least 1700, alternatively at least<br>
1750, alternatively at least 1800, alternatively at least 1850, alternatively at least 1900,<br>
alternatively at least 1950, alternatively at least 2000, alternatively at least 2100, alternatively<br>
at least 2200, alternatively at least 2300, alternatively at least 2400, alternatively at least<br>
2500, alternatively at least 2600, alternatively at least 2700, alternatively at least 2800,<br>
alternatively at least 2900, alternatively at least 3000, alternatively at least 3100, alternatively<br>
at least 3200, alternatively at least 3300, alternatively at least 3400, alternatively at least<br>
3500, alternatively at least 3600, alternatively at least 3700, alternatively at least 3800,<br><br>
alternatively at least 3900, alternatively at least 4000, alternatively at least 4500, alternatively<br>
at least 5000, alternatively at least 5500, alternatively 6000 or more overlapping, generally<br>
conical depressions or perforations.<br>
The present invention can further be distinguished from the prior art by the<br>
number of perforations in the grid plate 16, per square inch (cm2) of the perforated plate<br>
radius. The prior art 42-inch (1.07 m) grid plate has a surface area of 3.14159 (20)2 = 1257<br><br>
in2 (8110 cm2 ) and 448 perforations, or 0.356 perforations per square inch (2.30 per cm ).<br>
The illustrated 60-inch (1.52 m) grid plate has a perforated surface area of-3.14159 (29)2 =<br>
2642 in and 1338 perforations, or 0.506 perforations per square inch (3.26 per cm2).<br>
Alternative numbers of perforations per square inch contemplated herein are,-0.36 per in2<br>
(2.32 per cm2), 0.37 per in2 (2.39 per cm2), 0.38 per in2 (2.45 per cm2), 0.39;per»in2 (2.52 per<br>
cm2), 0.4 per in2 (2.58 per cm2), 0.41 per in2 (2.65 per cm2), 0.42 per in2 (2.71 per cm2), 0.43<br>
per in2 (2.77 per cm2), 0.44 per in2 (2.84 per cm2), 0.45 per in2 (2.90 per cm2), 0.46 per in2<br>
(2.97 per cm2), 0.47 per in2 (3.03 per cm2), 0.48 per in2 (3.097 per cm2), 0.49 per in2 (3.16 per<br>
cm2), 0.5 per in2 (3.23 per cm2), 0.51 per in2 (3.29 per cm ), 0.52 per in2 (3.35 per cm2), 0.53<br>
per in2 (3.42 per cm2), 0.54 per in2 (3.48 per cm2), 0.55 per in2 (3.55 per cm2), 0.56 per in2<br>
(3.61 per cm2), 0.57 per in2 (3.68 per cm2), 0.58 per in2 (3.74 per cm2), 0.59 per in2 (3.81 per<br>
cm ), or 0.6 per in (3.87 per cm2).<br>
In the illustrated aspects of the invention, a multiplicity of the generally<br>
conical depressions overlap six other contiguous generally conical depressions. This is true<br>
of all the non-peripheral generally conical depressions, in the illustrated aspect of the<br>
invention. Further, a multiplicity of the overlapping, generally conical depressions overlap<br>
less than six other contiguous generally conical depressions, in the illustrated aspect of the<br>
invention. This is true of the peripheral generally conical depressions.<br>
The number of perforations in the grid plate 16 per unit area is greater, but the<br>
diameter of the neck of each perforation, which limits the flow velocity, is less, than in the<br>
prior art. By providing more closely spaced, smaller diameter holes, the overall air flow is<br>
kept about the same, but is more finely distributed across more holes, which improves the<br>
quality of fluidization and reduces the maximum airflow velocity at any one point (in<br>
particular, directly in front of the hole). This change is contemplated to reduce catalyst<br>
particle attrition and to improve the contact efficiency between the catalyst and the<br>
fluidization air because of the reduced distances between adjacent holes.<br>
The grid plate 16 can be made of any suitable material that will withstand the<br>
conditions of activation. One example, of a suitable material is an INCONEL® 601 nickel-<br>
chromium-aluminum alloy forging. If fabricated as indicated herein, the grid plate 16 will<br>
support a catalyst load of at least 1500 lb (680 kg).<br><br>
Other suitable materials suitable for use as porous substrates are sintered<br>
materials which retain their structural integrity at activation temperature, which have a pore<br>
size such that the substrate will not blind with catalyst fines, and which are resistant to<br>
oxidation at operating conditions which would result in a reduction in permeability.<br>
Representative of such materials are type 316 stainless steel, INCONEL® alloys or<br>
HASTELLOY® alloys. Generally, the porous substrates can be formed from high melting<br>
alloys of nickel, iron, and at least one other metal selected from the following group:<br>
chromium, molybdenum, silicon, copper, and aluminum with alloys of nickel, iron, and<br>
chromium being specifically contemplated.<br>
The process of the present invention can be readily applied to the activation of<br>
any solid particulate material, regardless of type and regardless of the activating fluid. More<br>
particularly, the present invention is suited for the activation of particulate, metal oxide<br>
catalytic materials, especially such catalytic materials as are employed in polymerization<br>
reactions.<br>
Catalytic materials which are especially advantageously activated in<br>
accordance with this invention are supported monoolefin polymerization catalysts comprising<br>
chromium, at least a portion of which is in the hexavalent form such as chromium trioxide.<br>
These chromium-containing catalysts and their use as polymerization, particularly<br>
monoolefin polymerization, catalysts are well known. A representative method of preparing<br>
such catalysts is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,825,721, the disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
here by reference. As set forth in that patent, the supported chromium oxide catalysts can be<br>
prepared by depositing chromium oxide (e.g., Cr2O3) or a chromium compound calculable to<br>
chromium oxide, on a suitable support and activating to leave part of the chromium on the<br>
support in the hexavalent form. The support can be selected from one or more of the<br>
following members: silica, alumina, thoria, zirconia, silica-alumina, silica-thoria, silica-<br>
zirconia, acid-treated clays, and other materials generally known in the art as catalyst<br>
supports. One suitable catalyst is a silica gel-supported chromium oxide.<br>
As previously noted, the solid particulate catalysts are activated in accordance<br>
with the present invention by heating the particulate catalyst at a suitable activation<br>
temperature for a specified period of time. After such activation, the catalyst is cooled,<br>
purged with an inert gas, and collected in a dry container. The activation can be<br>
accomplished, for example, by heating the bed or deposit of catalyst at a temperature in the<br>
range of about 400°F (204°C) to about 2000°F. (1090°C), alternatively about 800°F (about<br>
427°) to about 1800°F. (about 982°C), for about 60 minutes to about 20 hours, alternatively<br>
about 4 hours to about 12 hours. This activation at elevated temperatures can be done in<br>
several stages such as gradually heating the bed of catalyst particles to an intermediate<br>
temperature of approximately 400°F to about 800°F. (204°C to about 427°C) and holding the<br><br>
particles at that temperature for 30 minutes to 2 hours after which a higher temperature, e.g.,<br>
1400°F. (760°C), is employed.<br>
Catalysts activated in accordance with the present invention are extremely<br>
valuable in the polymerization and copolymerization of polymerizable olefins, especially<br>
aliphatic and cyclic olefins including both mono- and diolefins, for example, ethylene,<br>
butadiene, and the like.<br>
To further illustrate the invention, a catalyst can be prepared by impregnating<br>
a coprecipitated gel composite containing 90 weight percent silica and 10 weight percent<br>
alumina with an aqueous solution of chromium nitrate. The total chromium trioxide content<br>
of the catalyst is 2.5 weight percent. The composite is activated with the present apparatus at<br>
a temperature of 1650°F (899°C) for 12 hours, using a superficial air velocity of 0.1 fps (3<br>
cm/sec). The conditioned catalyst thus made is suitable for the polymerization of ethylene to<br>
produce polyethylene. The chromium content is essentially intact, while the adsorbed water is<br>
completely removed. The catalyst loss is minimal, i.e., virtually all catalyst charged to<br>
activator is recovered in an activated condition, in comparison to standard activation<br>
treatments wherein catalyst loss can approach values considerably in excess of 50 percent and<br>
are as high as 65 percent.<br><br>

ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE<br><br><br>
A CATALYST ACTIVATOR VESSEL FOR HEAT CONDITIONING A CATALYST.<br>
A catalyst activator vessel for heat conditioning a catalyst is disclosed.<br>
The activator vessel includes inner and outer vessels, a perforated, normally generally<br>
horizontal grid plate within the inner vessel, and a fluid path extending through the grid<br>
plate within the vessel. The inner vessel can have an inside diameter of at least 50 inches<br>
(1.27 m). The space between the inner and outer vessels defines a flue. The perforated<br>
grid plate within the inner vessel can have an upper surface perforated with a pattern of<br>
overlapping, generally conical depressions and a lower surface, optionally overlapping by<br>
at least 17%. The fluid path extends upwardly through the perforated grid plate and is a<br>
conduit along which a fluid flows through the grid plate. The fluid will fiuidize a<br>
particulate material, such as a catalyst, disposed above the grid plate in the inner vessel.</td>
