				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to bonding of optical elements such as an optical waveguide, an optical collimator, an optical attenuator, an optical isolator, etc., and in particular, to an apparatus and process for bonding the optical elements by non-contact soldering.<br>
Description of the "Related Art<br>
There are several known methods of soldering electronic devices and optical elements. A first method is to heat a portion to be bonded by means of an electric iron and then supply lead. A second method is to place a high-frequency induction heater around the optical elements and apply constant<br><br>
heat to the portion to be bonded by high-frequency heating. A third method is to perform soldering by using a laser light source as a heat source, which is available where the electric iron cannot be used due to the high packaging density or there is mass production due to many portions to be bonded, -as shown, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,963,714 to Joseph R. Adamski et al entitled Diode Laser Soldering System. Lastly, a fourth method, which is available where there are many different portions to be bonded, is to apply heat to the portions to bonded by changing a light path using a prism. Here, the lead used in the first and second methods is in the form of a wire. The third and fourth methods, however, utilize lead powder plastered around the portions to be bonded.<br>
The soldering processes according to the known process are frequently applied to electronic devices. However, in order to apply such a soldering process to optical devices, the following should be considered:<br>
(1)	A possible contact during application of the heat to the bonding portions may affect the<br>
alignment of the optical elements;<br>
(2)	Bonding portions of the optical elements should be kept symmetric to prevent<br>
misalignment of the optical elements due to thermal expansion;<br>
(3)	Heat should be uniformly applied to symmetrical bonding portions to prevent mi salignment<br>
of the optical elements;<br>
(4)	The bonding portions should be filled completely with lead to secure reliability of the<br>
optical elements; and<br>
(5)	Reproductbility and mass production of the optical elements should be guaranteed.<br><br>
Examination of the respective soldering methods mentioned^above-.faasecLon-'t-he-fofegoing cotisiderations shows that neither the first nor second soldering methods meet all of the foregoing five points of consideration. Regarding the third soldering method, while meeting symmetry of optical elements arranged in a plane, it does not meet the foregoing considerations as to symmetry in three-dimensional space. Regarding the forth soldering method, while making connection of desired portions possible, it cannot secure the symmetry.<br>
In short, though very useful to the electronic devices, the conventional soldering methods are not suitable for optical elements due to the misalignment problem. That is to say, during application of heat to the bonding portions, if the lead contacts the surface of the bonding portions, the optical elements may be misaligned. Further, the laser beam applied to the bonding portions of the optical elements cannot be kept symmetric, which causes the misalignment of the optical elements due to the thermal expansion and non-uniform distribution of heat. As a result, the properties of the optical elements are affected., thus lowering reliability of the products. In addition, the reproducibiiity and mass production of the optical elements are also lowered.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and process for bonding optical elements by non-contact soldering, in which the interior of the bonding portions of the optical elements is sealed up completely to prevent moisture from penetrating into the optical elements,<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and process for bonding optical elements by non-contact soldering, capable of minimizing property variations of the optical elements.<br>
To achieve the foregoing objects, an apparatus for bonding optical elements according to the present invention comprises: a couple of optical elements having optical systems therein and which b surrounded by housings; an alignment apparatus which fixes one end of the each optical element and aligns the optical systems of the optical elements; laser light sources arranged respectively at predetermined ends of the housings for illuminating a laser beam lest the beam should be focused on the outer surface of the housings; lead-supplying units arranged respectively at the upper ends of the laser light sources for supplying the lead on the laser beam; and programmable logic control (PLC) which auto-controls the laser light sources and the lead supplying units.<br>
To achieve the foregoing objects, a method for bonding optical elements according to the present invention comprises steps of: fixing a couple of optical elements to an alignment apparatus for aligning the optical systems of the optical elements; illuminating a laser beams from plural laser light sources lest the beams should be in contact with cross-sections of bonding portions of the optical elements which are arranged between housings of the optical elements; after a predetermined time, supplying lead from lead supplying units on the laser beams; dissolving the lead by the laser beams so that the lead flows into gaps formed tn bonding sections between the housings; after a predetermined time, breaking off a driving force of the lead supplying units under auto-control of a programmable logic control (PLC); and, after a predetermined time, breaking off the laser beams<br><br>
under control of the PLC.<br>

DETAILED PESCRBPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2 the apparatus for bonding optical elements according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes optical elements 26 and 28 with various built-in optical systems, alignment apparatus 22 and 24 for the optical elements, continuously operable laser light sources 10a and 10b, lead-supplying units 14a and 14b, and lead 16a and 16b. Further, a housing 30 for protecting the optical system from the ambient environment is provided at the outer circumference of optical element 26. Likewise, a housing 32 is provided at the outer circumference of optical element 28, Through holes 34 are formed symmetrically on both sides of housing 32, and the lead 16a and 16b for fixing housings 30 and 32 are flowed into through holes 34, while one end of optical element 26 is fixed to alignment apparatus 22 and one end of the optical element 28 is fixed to alignment apparatus 24.<br>
The continuously operable laser light sources 10a and 10b are arranged at both sides of the optical elements 26 and 28 with a predetermined spacing. Laser light sources 10a and 10b illuminate laser beams 12a and 12b, respectively, lest the foci of the laser beams 12a and 12b should be in contact with outer surface of the housing 32, to apply heat to a bonding portion 40 (see Figs 2 and 3 for more detail on bonding portion 40) and dissolve lead 16a and 16b, thereby making optical elements 26 and 28 fixed. A diameter of the foci of the beams 12a and 12b illuminated from the laser light sources 10a<br><br>
and 10b is about 0.5mm~3rnm, and an electric power of the beam illuminated from the laser light sources 10a and 10b is about 15W-4OW. Lead-supplying units 14a and 14b, supplying lead 16a and 16b which are in the form of wire, are arranged at the upper end of the each laser light source 10a and 10b. Lead-supplying units 14a and 14b supply lead 16a and 16b on laser beams 12a and 12b. That is to say, lead-supplying units 14a and 14b supply lead 16a and 16b on the beam 12a and 12b so that the lead in contact with the beam in the first place without the lead 16a and 16b being directly contacted with bonding portion 40. Laser light sources 10a and 10b and lead-suppiying units 14a and 14b are automatically controlled by PLC (Programmable Logic Control) 40. Namely, PLC 42 controls the turning on and off(ON/OFF) of laser light sources 10a and 10b and controls the supplying time of lead 16a and 16b so that lead 16a and 16b are supplied symmetrically at left and right side of optical elements 26 and 28.<br>
An explanation of operation the mechanism and the process thereof regarding the bonding apparatus for optical elements by the non-contact soldering process with reference to Figs. 1 through 6 is as follows:<br>
First of all, optical element 26 is fixed and positioned to alignment apparatus 22 and optical element 28 is fixed and positioned to alignment apparatus 24, as represented in Fig, 1. After the foregoing procedure, the alignment apparatus alignsthe optical systems (not shown), which are packed inside optical elements 26 and 28, automatically or manually. After the optical systems are aligned at an optimum position, PLC 42 controls laser light sources 10a and 10b. Then, laser light sources 10a<br><br>
and 1 Ob illuminate laser beams 12a and 12b, lest the beams should be in contact with the surfaces of both the housing 30 of optical element 26 and the housing 32 of optical element 28. That is to say, laser light sources 10a and 10b illuminate beams 12a and 12b, as represented in Figs. 1 and 2, so that the beams cao be focused within the domain where the foes of the beams are not in contact with the surfaces of bonding portion 40 of the optical elements. In other words, the illumination position of laser beams 12a and 12b are the bonding portion 40 of the optical elements and the laser light sources 10a and 10b may apply heat at its maximum provided that optical elements 26 and 28 are put at vicinity of the focal length of beams 12a and 12b, Here, the diameters of foci of beams 12a and 12b at its focal length are about 0.5mm~3mm. Though they depend on usage, 2,5mm is applied in the embodiment of the present invention. The illumination time of beams 12a and 12b illuminated from laser light sources 10a and 10b consists of three steps to improve bonding reliability of lead 16a and 16b.<br>
After a predetermined time, namely, after laser light sources 10a and 10b heat up, in the vicinity of 100°C, the cross-section of bonding portion 40 sufficiently for a preliminary heating time "Tl", increasing affinity of the lead 16a and 16b, PLC 42 automatically controls lead-supplying units 14a and 14b as represented m Figs. 4 through 6, Then, lead-supplying units 14a and 14b supply lead 16a and 16b on laser beams 12a and 12b. Namely, lead-supplying units 14a and 14b supply lead 16a and 16b at a constant velocity for a primary heating time "T2" as represented in Figs. 4 through 6. Then lead 16a and 16b3 right before it touches bonding portion 403 come into contact with laser beams 12a and 12b in the first place and be dissolved, thereby being melted and flowed into the through holes<br>
,£age8.©£-^6<br><br>
34 of the bonding portion 40. Here, lead-supplying units 14a and 14b supply lead 16a and 16b on beams 12a and 12b at a velocity of about 5mm/sec. After that, under control of PLC 42, lead supplying units 14a and 14b break off supplying lead 16a and 16b at a velocity of about ~25mm/sec at the stage when the primary heating time "T2" elapses. In succession, laser light sources 10a and 10b illuminate beams 12a and 12b, thereby post-heating for the post-heating time "T3" so that lead 16a and 16b supplied already at bonding portion 40 are maintained in a stable formation, under control of PLC 42 as represented in Figs. 4 through 6. Then, PLC 42 turns off laser light sources 10a and 10b after the lapse of the post-heating time "T3". By the foregoing, optical elements 26 and 28 are bonded in manner of a non-contact soldering process as represented in Fig. 3. Here, in general, when the preheating time is too long, with respect to the preheating time, the primary heating time, and the post-heating time of the laser beam illumination time of laser light sources 10a and 10b, a problem may occur that plated portions on the cross-sections of bonding portion 40 of the optical elements may burn out or all fluxes may evaporate away. So, in the embodiment of the present invention, time is controlled at a ratio of preheating time; primary heating time; post-heating time - 1 sec; 1.5 sec-1.7 sec: 1.5 sec, respectively.<br>
While there have been illustrated and described what is to be considered to be the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made, and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the true scope of the present invention. Therefore, it is intended that the present invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated<br><br>
for carrying out the present invention, but that the present invention includes all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
