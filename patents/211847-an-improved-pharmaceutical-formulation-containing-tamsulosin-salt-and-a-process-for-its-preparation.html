Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride . Tamsulosin hydrochloride is an antagonist of alpha lA adrenoceptors in the prostate. Tamsulosin Hcl is (-)-[R]-5,4,2-[2-(0-ethoxy phenoxy) ethyl] amino propyl -2- methoxy benzene sulfonamide monohydrochloride. The empirical formula of Tamsulosin Hcl is C20H28N205S. Hcl. The molecular weight of Tamsulosin Hcl is 444.98. Tamsulosin Hcl is indicated in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benigh prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It aids in relaxing the smooth muscles in bladder neck and prostate resulting in an improvement in urine flow rate and a reduction in symptoms of BPH. The recommended daily dosage is 0.4mg.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
US Patent no 4,772,475 details a pharmaceutical controlled release individual unit or multiple units formulation in which the individual unit comprises a granulation product obtained by adding a release controlling agent to a mixture of a physiologically active substance and units-forming substance(s) and granulating and resultant mixture, said granulation product (granules) being substantially not disintegrated but gradually releasing the physiologically active substance in the gastrointestinal tract. The release controlling agent used is a methacrylic acid- ethyl acrylate copolymer or mixtures of said copolymer and ethyl cellulose. Examples of the formulation containing Tamsulosin Hydrochloride were given. The results of dissolution rates of the compositions exemplified in 21 Examples were provided in the patent .On a detailed study of these Examples it is observed that:<br>
In 6 Examples eudragit L30D-55 has been used as the release controlling agent(A) In 4 Examples same eudragit has been   used as the release controlling agent but in addition magnesium stearate was also used (B)<br>
In 3 Examples ethyl cellulose has been used as the release controlling agent (C), &amp; In another 6 Examples water has been used as the release controlling agent.<br><br>
In all the above cases the dissolution rate percentage were given. But in 10 cases only dissolution rate was provided for 2 hours, of the 10 examples, 3 samples showing more than 90% release,<br>
2	samples showing release between 61% and 66.2% 1 sample showing 57.6% and<br>
3	samples showing 41.7% to 44.8%<br>
all the values at the end of 2nd hour of dissolution study.<br>
Such a high degree of variation in dissolution rate and release of more than 90% drug at the end of 2nd hour in three out of 10 samples may be caused due to lack of uniform geometry of the resultant granulation of the active ingredients and also may not qualify for the formation of a controUed-release dosage form.<br>
The combination of acrylic acid polymers and their copolymers with celluloses may lead to inconsistent release profiles.<br>
WO Patent no 03 / 039531 Al discloses a pharmaceutical tablet comprising a tablet matrix having dispersed therein 0.1 to 10mg of Tamsulosin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and optionally having an enteric coating over said martix, wherein said tablet is a modified release tablet and has a dissolution profile such that in each of the media, simulated intestinal fluid (SIF), fasting state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) and fed state simulated intestinal fluid (FeSSIF) said tablet releasing not more than 60% of said Tamsulosin at 2 hours elapsed time in USP2 (a type of dissolution testing as per US Pharmacopeia.) apparatus using 500 ml of said media at 50-100 rpm paddle speed. The patent also provides data on the release of Tamsulosin in at the end of 30 minutes, 2 hours and 6 hours in Simulated gastric fluid(SGF) media and Simulated intestinal fluid.(SIF) media.<br><br>
In the book on sustained and controlled- release drug delivery systems by Gwen M. Jantzen and Joseph R.Robinson, the authors commented that in the case of the matrix based dosage form, " cracking of the matrix material can cause unwanted release".<br>
In their book on Novel drug delivery and its therapeutic application edited by L.F.Prescott and W.S.Nimmo, while commenting upon the relative merits of single and multi-particulate systems, the authors opined that" multiple units can have the following advantages;<br>
1)	they are less influenced by food (gastric emptying) than single units.<br>
2)	the individual units are normally well distributed in the gastrointestinal tract if taken after or together with food, and by spreading in this way the risk of local high concentrations of released drug is reduced.<br>
3)	there may be fewer problems with stenosis or obstruction caused by gastrointestinal pathology and<br>
4)	dose adjustment may well be easier.<br>
On the other hand the advantages of controlled release dosage form are reduction in drug blood level fluctuations, reduction in drug frequency, enhanced patient convenience and compliance and reduction in adverse side effects and normal food intake.<br>
It is well known that release of the active ingredient from a matrix based system depends on the availability of adequate amount of gastric fluids. As Tamsulosin is a sparingly soluble drug, the absence of a proper liquid content available throughout its dissolution time, may pose problems of a continuous drug availability.<br>
EP no 1088551 mentions various dosage forms that can be made using Tamsulosin as active agent. The active agent is mixed with diluents, other additives like binders, lubricants, a disintegrating agent, a stabilizer, a solublising aid, a plasticiser, and a<br><br>
colouring agent and compressing them into tablets for achieving a sustained release preparation. This approach suffers from the same disadvantages as stated above.<br>
The JP no 2001114679 discloses a medicine containing Tamsulosin for the treatment of lower urinary tract diseases with pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient which contains tamsulosin or its sah permitted pharmaceutically as an active principle. Tamsulosin is mixed with inactive diluent like lactose, a mannitol, a microcrystal cellulose, grape sugar, starch, a polyvinyl pyrrolidone and magnesium aluminium silicate in a solid tablet. It contains solublizing agent like hydroxypropylcellulose and hydroxyproylmethyl cellulose, a magnesium stearate, a calcium stearate, a polyethylene glycol, starch, lubricant like talk and stabilizing agent like lactose, glutamic acid or an aspartic acid.<br>
The invention is a self-sustaining discharge type gradual release tablet. It is obtained by coating a tablet, a granule, a fine grain agent and a capsule by conventional method .<br>
The JP No 2000080032 discloses a composition for oral administration containing tamsulosin Hcl and its dosage forms particular for the treatment of eccrisis obstacle treatment agent especially accompanying the neurogenic bladder. . This composition contains tamsulosin or tamsulosin Hcl as an active ingredient, mixed with inactive diluent lactose, mannitol, grape sugar, a microcrystal cellulose, starch, a polyvinyl pyrrolidone, magnesium aluminium silicate in a solid tablet with solublizing agent, binder, additives, like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, magnesium stearate, a calcium stearate, polyethylene glycol, starch, lubricant like talc, disintegrator like a calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, stabilizing agent like a lactose, glutamic acid or an aspartic acid a plasticizer like a triacetin, titanium oxide and a colouring agent like iron sesquioxide according to a conventional method. Tablet or the pilule as occasion demands with the film of glycocalyx such as cane sugar, gelatin, agar, hydroxypropylcellusle , Hydroxy propyl methylcellulose phthalate or the enteric nature matter. The composition is self-sustaining discharge type gradual release tablet., or granule, a fine-grain capsule form. The daily dose of the composition in ordinary cases is<br><br>
about 0.1-0.8mg, most preferably 0.2-0.4mg the active ingredient per adult when the tamsulosin hydrochloride is orally administered, and the daily dose is administered once after the meal.<br>
None of the prior art described above addresses the problem of improving the solubility of Tamsulosin and then controlling the release of the drug in a gradual manner by diffusion, so that the modified release dosage form presents a graded release profile over a period in excess of 4 hours, wherein at the end of the 4th hour, at least 70% of the drug gets released. Accordingly the present invention relates to a drug delivery system for administering tamsulosin as an oral dosage form for treating conditions such as benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition containing Tamsulosin Hydrochloride useful for the sustained release of the active ingredient.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a drug delivery system for the oral administration of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a drug delivery system for administering Tamsulosin Hydrochloride orally which releases the drug over a period of time, in excess of 4 hours.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a drug formulation wherein consistency of the drug release is provided by designing the process by layering the drug as a soluble complex on non-pareil seeds, a separate polymer coating for controlled release, and a second coating with enteric polymer for targetted drug release.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a drug formulation wherein the unit dosage drug is contained in ready to dissolve in multiple reservoirs.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a drug delivery system containing Tamsulosin Hydrochloride wherein the unit dosage of the drug is contained in is ready to dissolve multiple reservoirs where the release of the drug from the multiple reservoirs is controlled by a diffusion process.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to prepare hard gelatin capsules, containing Tamsulosin Hydrochloride each capsule containing a unit dose of the drug as multiple reservoirs.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a method of preparing a formulation   containing Tamsulosin Hydrochloride which can be administered orally.<br>
Detailed description<br>
Tamsulosin Hcl is only slightly soluble in water. The effect of solubilising agents on increasing the solubility of Tamsulosin HCL was assessed with two materials, poly vinyl pyrrolidone (PVPK -30) and cyclodextrin. Initially 200mg Tamsulosin HCL was dissolved in 100ml of demineralised water. Addition of any further drug did not result in any increased solubility of the drug, indicating the saturation of the drug in water. In another experiment, 5 gm of PVPK-30 was dissolved in 100 ml of demineralised water and 200 mg of Tamsulosin Hcl was added to this solution. The drug showed complete dissolution. Another 100 mg of Tamsulosin Hcl was added to this solution. The drug was completely soluble in this solution. Upon addition of another 100 mg of Tamsulosin Hcl, however some crystals remained. It was concluded that PVPK-30 was helping the dissolution of Tamsulosin Hcl atleast by 50%.<br>
In another experiment 1.0 gm of cyclodextrin was dissolved in 100 ml of demineralised water.  To this solution, 200 mg Tamsulosin Hcl was added and the drug dissolved.   To<br><br>
this solution, 300 mg of Tamsulosin Hci was added in increments of lOOmg. Upto 400 mg of Tamsulosin Hcl could be dissolved in this solution and a few crystals remained with 500 mg total drug. It was concluded that addition of 1% B- cyclodextrin was able to improve the dissolution of Tamsulosin Hcl by atleast 100%.<br>
This exciting prospect of improved solubility of Tamsulosin Hcl in the presence of Polyvinyl pyrrolidone / cyclodextrin was successfully worked out. Initially the drug and the solublising agent along with an emulsifier are dissolved in a solvent mixture of alcoholic and aqueous media. The drug, as it is in a completely dissolved state, is layered on to sugar spheres in a conventional way, resulting in a drug solubiliser complex. ( Tamsulosin with polyvinyl pyrrolidone and cyclodextrin ) in a very fine particulate deposit.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved release pharmaceutical formulation useful for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia which comprises a core of sugar spheres having a coating of a solution of Tamsulosin Hcl or a pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in Polyvinyl pyrrolidone and / or β-cyclodextrin containing a solublising agent, an emulsifiying agent, a binder and a solvent in the form of pellets, the spheres also having a coating of ethyl cellulose polymer and a further coating of an enteric polymer containing, plasticizers, antitacking agent and a solvent.<br>
The formulation may be in pellet or capsule form .The formulation of the invention ensures release of the drug at predefined rates in such a way that drug is available for bio-absorbtion even at the end of 4 hour and having good stability and useful for the treatment of Benign prostatic hyperplasia.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the above said improved release pharmaceutical formulation containing Tamsulosin Hydrochloride in an oral dosage form which comprises<br>
I.	preparing a solid solution of Tamsulosin Hcl or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts thereof   in Polyvinyl pyrrolidone and / or   13-cyclodextrin containing   a<br><br>
solublising agent, an emulsifiying agent, a binder and a solvent and forming info pellets.<br>
II.	impregnating the above solution on to sugar spheres.<br>
III.	coating the resulting drug loaded pellets  with a polymer coating layer<br>
IV.	providing the polymer coated pellets with a coating of an enteric polymer, containing plasticizers, wetting agent, antitacking agent and a solvent and if desired.<br>
V.	encapsulating the enteric coated pellets in hard gelatin capsules.<br>
The pellets or the capsules so prepared upon coming into contact with gastro intestinal fluids readily dissolves and readily diffuse through the polymer system loaded, on the drug loaded pellets. The polymer system acts as a controlled release membrane and allows diffusion of the drug through it at a predefined rate. A gastric resistant coat over the polymer coated pellets ensures that the gradual release of the drug takes place in the small intestine where its absorption is best. The predefined dissolution rates of Tamsulosin Hcl are worked out in such a way as to ensure less than 10% drug release at the end of 2 hours in the gastric medium and then subsequently shifting to pH 6.8 buffer to ensure that at the end of 1st hour, the drug release is between 35 to 55%, at the end of 2nd hour the drug release is between 50 to 70% and at the end of 4th hour, the drug releases not less than 70%, thereby ensuring an adequate amount of drug available for bio-absorption.<br>
