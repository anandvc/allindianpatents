				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to wireless communication systems. More particularly, the present invention is related to a method and apparatus for combining space-frequency block coding (SFBC), Spatial multiplexing (SM) and beamfonning in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
OFDM is a data transmission scheme where data is split into a plurality of smaller streams and each stream is transmitted using a sub-carrier with a smaller bandwidth than the total available transmission bandwidth. The efficiency of OFDM depends on choosing these sub-carriers orthogonal to each other. The sub-carriers do not interfere with each other while each carrying a portion of the total user data.<br>
An OFDM system has advantages over other wireless communication systems. When the user data is split into streams carried by different sub-carriers, the effective data rate on each sub-carrier is much smaller. Therefore, the symbol duration is much larger. A large symbol duration can tolerate larger delay spreads. Thus, it is not affected by multipath as severely. Therefore, OFDM symbols can tolerate delay spreads without complicated receiver designs. However, typical wireless systems need complex channel equalization schemes to combat multipath fading.<br>
Another advantage of OFDM is that the generation of orthogonal sub-carriers at the transmitter and receiver can be done by using inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) engines. Since the IFFT and FFT implementations are well known, OFDM can be implemented easily and does not require complicated receivers.<br>
MIMO refers to the type of wireless transmission and reception scheme where both a transmitter and a receiver employ more than one antenna. A MIMO system takes advantage of the spatial diversity or spatial multiplexing and improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and increases throughput.<br>
SFBC is a scheme for transmitting symbols of a space diversity coding on neighboring sub-carriers rather than on the same sub-carrier in the successive time slots. The SPEC avoids the problems of fast time variations associated with space time block coding (STBC). However, the channel needs to be constant over the sub-carriers that combining takes place.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is related to a method and apparatus for combining SFBC, 8M and beamforming in a MEMO-OFDM system. The system includes a transmitter with a plurality of transmit antennas and a receiver with a plurality of receive antennas. The transmitter generates at least one data stream and a plurality of spatial streams. The number of generated spatial streams is based on the number of the transmit antennas and the number of the receive antennas. The transmitter determines a transmission scheme in accordance with at least one of SFBC, SM and beam forming. The transmitter transmits data in the data stream to the receiver based on the selected transmission scheme.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS A more detailed understanding of the invention may be had from the<br>
following description, given by way of example and to be understood in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of an OFDM-MIMO system implementing a<br>
closed loop mode in accordance with the present invention; and<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of an OFDM-MIMO system implementing<br>
an open loop mode in accordance with the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention will be described with reference to the drawing figures wherein like numerals represent like elements throughout.<br>
The features of the present invention may be incorporated into an integrated circuit (IC) or be configured hi a circuit comprising a multitude of interconnecting components.<br>
The present invention provides a plurality of combinations of SFBC, SM, FD and beam selection according to the number of available data streams and spatial streams and the number of transmit and receive antennas. The combinations provide flexibility on the design of M3MO-OFDM systems and scalable solutions for any number transmit and receive antenna configuration. Each combination has trade-offs between performance, reliability and data rate. Therefore, a combination can be chosen according to some criteria, such as robustness, a data rate, a channel condition, or the Eke. The number of data streams is preferably decided based on a modulation and coding scheme. The number of spatial streams is decided by the number of transmit and receive antennas.<br>
There are two modes of operation of the system: a closed loop and an open loop. The closed loop is used when channel state information (CSI) is available to the transmitter. The open loop is used when CSI is not available at the transmitter. A variant may be used for transmission to legacy STA where it provides diversity benefits.<br>
In the closed loop mode, CSI is used to create virtually independent channels by decomposing and diagonalizing the channel matrix by preceding at the transmitter and further antenna processing at the receiver. Given the eigenvalue spread of wireless channels, a trade-off is made between a data rate and robustness by employing SFBC and/or SM. This scheme allows for a simple receiver implementation, simpler than a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) receiver. The combined solution enables higher throughput over a larger range compared to traditional techniques. The technique allows per sub-carrier power/bit loading and maintains a sustained robust link through closed loop<br>
operation with CSI feedback. Another benefit of the technique is that it is easily scalable to any number of antennas at both transmitter and receiver.<br>
The CSI can be obtained at the transmitter either by feedback from the receiver or through exploiting channel reciprocity. Latency requirements and feedback data rates are typically not significant to the inherent frequency non-selectivity of eigenvalues. A transmit antenna calibration scheme is required. In addition, channel quality information (CQI) is used to determine a coding rate and a modulation scheme per sub-carrier or group of sub-carriers. The determined coding rate and modulation scheme determines the number of data streams. According to the number of data streams, the combinations are chosen with the available spatial streams.<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of an OFDM-MEMO system 100 implementing a closed loop mode in accordance with the present invention. The system 100 includes a transmitter 110 and a receiver 130. The transmitter 110 includes a channel coder 112, a multiplexer 114, a power loading unit 116, a plurality of optional SFBC units 118, a plurality of serial-to-parallel (S/P) converters 120, a transmit beamformer 122, a plurality of IFFT units 124 and a plurality of transmit antennas 126. The channel coder 112 codes data preferably in accordance with a CQI which is provided by the receiver 130. The CQI is used to determine a coding rate and modulation scheme per sub-carrier or group of sub-carriers. The coded data stream is multiplexed by the multiplexer 114 into two or more data streams 115.<br>
The transmit power level of each data stream 115 is adjusted by the power loading unit 116 based on feedback 150 provided from the receiver 130. The power loading unit 116 adjusts power levels with respect to the data rate of each eigenbeam to balance the total transmit power over all eigenbeams (or sub-carriers).<br>
The optional SFBC units 118 perform SFBC on the data streams 115. SFBC is performed over eigen-beams and sub-carriers for each data rate that is transmitted. Eigen-beam and sub-carrier pairs are selected to ensure independent channels. OFDM symbols are carried on K sub-carriers. To<br>
accommodate SFBC, the sub-carriers are divided into L pairs of sub-carriers (or group of sub-carriers). The bandwidth of each group of sub-carriers should be less than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. However, when combined with eigen-beamforming this restriction is relaxed due to the frequency insensitivity of the eigen-beams.<br>
The pairs of sub-carrier groups used by the block code are considered independent. The following is an example of the Alamouti type SFBC applied to an OFDM symbol:<br>
(Symbol Removed)<br>
Once the optional SFBC units 118 construct OFDM symbols for all sub-carriers, the coded blocks are multiplexed by the S/P converters 120 and input to the transmit beamformer 122. The transmit beamformer 122 distributes eigen-beams to the transmit antennas. The IFFT units 124 convert the data in frequency domain to the data in time domain.<br>
The receiver 130 comprises a plurality of receive antennas. 128, a plurality of FFT units 132, a receive beamformer 134, a plurality of optional SFBC decoding units 136, a demultiplexer 138, a channel decoder 144, a channel estimator 140, a CSI generator 142 and a CQI generator 146.<br>
The FFT units 132 convert samples received in time domain by the antennas 128 to frequency domain. The receive beamformer 134, the optional SFBC decoding units 136, the demultiplexer 138 and the channel decoder 144 process the samples converted to the frequency domain.<br>
The channel estimator 140 generates channel matrix using a training sequence transmitted from the transmitter and decomposes the channel matrix into two beam-forming unitary matrices U and V, (U for transmit and V for receive), and a diagonal matrix D per sub-carrier (or per sub-carrier group) by singular value decomposition (SVD) or eigenvalue decomposition. The CSI generator 142 generates CSI 147 from the channel estimation results and the CQI generator generates a CQI 148 based on the decoding results. The CSI and the CQI provide feedback 150 from the receiver 130 to the transmitter 110.<br>
The channel matrix H between nT transmit antennas and nR receive antennas can be written as follows:<br>
(Symbol Removed)<br>
The channel matrix H is decomposed by SVD as follows: H = UDVH<br>
where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix. U E CnxnR and V e CnTxnT. Then, for transmit symbol vector s, transmit preceding is simply performed as follows:<br>
x = Vs. The received signal becomes as follows:<br>
where n is the noise introduced in the channel. The receiver completes the decomposition by using a matched filter: VHHH=VHVDHUH=D"U".<br>
After normalizing channel gain for eigenbeams, the estimate of the transmit symbols a becomes<br>
(Symbol Removed)<br>
The symbols s is detected without having to perform successive interference cancellation or MMSE type detector. DHD is a diagonal matrix that is formed by eigenvalues of H across the diagonal. Therefore, the normalization factor α = D-2 U are eigenvectors of HIP1, V are eigenvectors of IKE and D is a diagonal matrix of singular values of H (square roots of eigenvalues of HEP1).<br>
If the optional SFBG units 118 and the optional SFBC decoding units 136 are removed from the transmitter 110 and the receiver 130, respectively, the transmitter 110 and the receiver 130 may be used for SM.<br>
In the open loop mode, a combination of space-frequency coding and<br><br>
spatial spreading in the transmitter 110 provides diversity without requiring CSI 147. The CQI 148 is used to determine a coding rate and modulation per sub-carrier or group of sub-carriers. This coding rate and modulation scheme determines the number of data streams. According to the number of data streams, the combinations are chosen with the available spatial streams.<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of a system 200 implementing an open loop mode in accordance with the present invention. The system 200 includes a transmitter 210 and a receiver 230. In the open loop mode, a combination of space-frequency coding and spatial spreading in the transmitter 210 provides diversity without requiring CSI. A variant of this scheme may be used when operating with legacy IEEE 802.11a/g user equipment.<br>
The transmitter 210 includes a channel coder 212, a multiplexer 214, a power loading unit 216, a plurality of SFBC units 218, a plurality of serial-to-parallel (S/P) converters 220, a beamformer network (BFN) 222, a plurality of IFFT units 224 and a plurality of transmit antennas 226. As in the closed loop mode, the channel coder 212 uses CQI to determine coding rate and modulation per sub-carrier or group of sub-carriers. The coded data stream 213 is multiplexed by the multiplexer 214 into two or more data streams 215. The BFN 222 forms N beams in space, where N is the number of antennas 226. The beams are pseudo-randomly constructed by the BFN matrix operation. The independent sub-carrier groups used for the SFBC coding are transmitted on individual beams.<br>
For legacy support, SFBC coding may not be performed. Instead diversity through beam permutation is performed which improves diversity and therefore the performance of legacy IEEE 802.11a/g user equipment.<br>
The receiver 230 includes a plurality of receive antennas 231, FFT units 232, a BFN 234, an SFBC decoding and combining unit 236 and a channel decoder 238. The FFT units 232 convert samples received in time domain by the receive antennas 231 to frequency domain. The SFBC decoding and combining unit 236 decodes and combines symbols received from sub-carrier groups/eigen-beams and converts them from parallel to serial using a prior knowledge of the<br>
constellation size. Symbols are combined using MRC. The channel decoder 238 decodes the combined symbol and generates a CQI240.<br>
If the SFBC units 218 and the SFBC decoding function of the SBC decoding and combining unit 236 are removed from the transmitter 210 and the receiver 230, respectively, the transmitter 210 and the receiver 230 may be used for SM.<br>
Examples of SFBC, SM, FD and beam selection combinations in accordance with the present invention are explained hereinafter.<br>
Si denotes the group of the modulated symbols. The length depends on how many groups the sub-carriers for data are divided into. Sub-carriers are divided into two groups. Each Si includes symbols whose length is a half of the number of sub-carriers for data.<br>
dn denotes singular values of the channel matrix, where di &gt; da &gt; da &gt; ...&gt; dM, M is the maximum number of the singular values, (i.e., the number of transmit, antennas).<br>
Rate = 1 means that M symbols are sent and recovered per one sub-carrier during one OFDM symbol duration. When less than M symbols are sent and recovered, the rate is fractional.<br>
In FD, Si is sent on a half of sub-carriers and Si* is sent on the other half of sub-carriers.<br>
Single transmit antenna case - Single-input single-output (SISO).<br>
In a SISO case, only one data stream and one spatial stream are implemented. Without using FD, one symbol is sent per sub-carrier. Using FD, one symbol is sent per two sub-carriers. It is summarized in Table 1.<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
Two transmit antenna case.<br>
With two transmit antennas, a 2x 1 or a 2x2 MIMO-OFDM system may<br>
be supported, and either one or two data streams may be supported.<br>
2x1 MIMO-OFDM closed loop - one data stream case.<br>
In a closed loop mode, beam selection with or without FD and SFBC may be used. Since data transmitted on the beam having smaller singular value will die, one beam is selected through SVD. The SVD beam having a larger singular value is chosen. For a beam selection without FD, one data symbol is sent per a sub-carrier and for a beam selection with FD, one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers. In a beam selection with FD, the rate is a half of that in the beam selection without FD case, but the reliability is increased.<br>
Although the data transmitted on the beam having smaller singular value will die, two symbols can be sent at the same time by using SFBC through two sub-carriers. Using this scheme, one data symbol is sent per sub-carrier. Comparing with the beam selection case, the performance of this case will be degraded, since the second stream with the smaller singular value includes only noise.<br>
One data stream case for the 2x1 MIMO-OFDM closed loop is summarized in Table 2.<br><br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
2x1 MIMO-OFDM open loop - one data stream case.<br>
In an open loop mode, SM with or without FD and SFBC may be used. For SM (with the fixed beamforming matrix) without FD, one data symbol is sent per sub-carrier for each spatial stream by using the fixed beamforming and SM, and for SM with FD, one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers for each spatial stream by using the fixed beamforming and SM.<br>
Combination of FD and non-FD is possible. In such case, one symbol is sent on two sub-carriers on one spatial stream and one symbol is sent on one sub-carrier on the other spatial stream. The data rate is % of the SM without FD<br>
case.<br>
If SFBC with the fixed beamforming matrix is used, two data symbols of the data stream are sent on two sub-carriers through two antennas by using the fixed beamforming. The data rate is a half of the SM without-FD case.<br>
One data stream case for the 2x1 MIMO-OFDM open loop is summarized in Table 3.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
2x1 MIMO-OFDM (open loop) - two data stream case.<br>
For two data stream case, an open loop mode should be used since an SVD beam having a smaller singular value carries nothing but noise and will die, as explained hereinbefore. Without FD, one data symbol is sent per sub-carrier for each spatial stream and with FD, one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers for each spatial stream. Combination of FD and non-FD is possible.<br>
Two data stream case for the 2x1 MIMO-OFDM open loop is summarized in Table 4.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
2x2 MIMO-OFDM closed loop - one data stream case.<br>
In a closed loop mode, SM with or without FD, beam selection with or without FD and SFBC may be used. In a closed loop mode, two spatial beams are formed by SVD for each sub-carrier.<br>
For SM without FD, one data symbol is sent per one sub-carrier for each spatial stream and for SM with FD, one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers by using one spatial stream. Combination of FD and non-FD is possible.<br>
For beam selection, one SVD beam between two beams for each sub-<br>
carrier is selected, which has larger singular value, and the other beam of each sub-carrier is discarded. For beam selection without FD, one data symbol is sent per one sub-carrier by using one spatial stream. For beam selection with FD, one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers by using one spatial stream.<br>
Two spatial streams for each sub-carrier are generated according to the SVD of the channel of each sub-carrier and two data symbols can be sent on two sub-carriers by using SFBC.<br>
One data stream case for the 2x2 MIMO-OFDM closed loop is summarized in Table 5.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
2x2 MIMO-OFDM open loop - one data stream case.<br>
In an open loop, SM with or without FD and SFBC may be supported. SM is implemented with a fixed beamforming matrix and both spatial streams of each sub-carrier may be used.<br>
For SM without FD, one data symbol is sent per one sub-carrier for each spatial stream and for SM with FD, one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers by using one spatial stream. Combination of FD and non-FD is possible.<br>
Two data symbols of the data stream can be sent on two sub-carriers for each spatial stream by using the fixed beamforming and SFBC.<br>
The transmitting method is same as one for the 2x1 system. However, the performance will be better, since two receive antennas are used in a receiver.<br>
One data stream case for the 2x2 MIMO-OFDM open loop is summarized in Table 6.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
2x2 MIMO-OFDM closed loop - two data stream case.<br>
In a closed loop mode, SM with or without FD may be used. SM is performed with SVD beamforming and two spatial streams are available for each sub-carrier. Since there are two data streams, one spatial stream should be assigned to each data stream, and SFBC is not possible for the same reason.<br>
For SM without FD, one data symbol is sent per one sub-carrier for each spatial stream and for SM with FD, one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers by using one spatial stream. Combination of FD and non-FD is possible.<br>
Two data stream case for the 2x2 MIMO-OFDM closed loop is summarized in Table 7.<br><br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
In an open loop, SM is implemented with the fixed beamforming matrix and two spatial streams are available for each sub-carrier. As explained hereinbefore, one spatial stream is assigned to each data stream.<br>
For SM without FD, one data symbol is sent per one sub-carrier for each spatial stream and for SM with FD, one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers by using one spatial stream. Combination of FD and non-FD is possible.<br>
Two data stream case for the 2x2 MIMO-OFDM open loop is summarized in Table 8.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Three transmit antenna case.<br>
With three transmit antennas, 3x1, 3x2 and 3x3 MEMO-OFDM systems may be supported, and either one, two or three data streams may be supported.<br>
3x1 MIMO-OFDM closed loop - one data stream case.<br>
In a closed loop mode, beam selection with or without FD and SFBC may be used. Beams are generated with SVD beam forming, and for beam selection, one spatial beam is selected (only one beam is available since two other beams do not carry nothing but noise and will die). The beam having the largest singular value is selected.<br>
For beam selection without FD, one data symbol is sent per one sub-carrier for the chosen spatial stream and for beam selection with FD, one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers for the chosen spatial stream.<br>
For SFBC with SVD beamforming, two spatial streams are selected for each sub-carrier: one corresponding to the largest singular value and the other one corresponding to one of the rest. However, even though two symbols can be sent at the same time by using SFBC through two sub-carriers, the performance will be very low, since one spatial stream includes only noise.<br>
One data stream case for the 3x1 MIMO-OFDM closed loop is summarized in Table 9.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
3x1 MIMO-OFDM open loop - one data stream case.<br>
In an open loop case, SM and SFBC are implemented with the fixed beamforming matrix and three spatial streams are available.<br>
For SM without FD, one data symbol is sent per one sub-carrier for each spatial stream and for SM with FD, one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers for each spatial stream. Combination of FD and non-FD is possible. One data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers on one spatial stream and one symbol is sent per one sub-carrier on two other spatial streams, or one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers on two spatial streams and one symbol is sent per one sub-carrier on the other spatial stream.<br>
SFBC may be implemented with or without FD. Among three spatial streams for each sub-carrier, two spatial streams are used for SFBC and the other one is used for independent data symbol. Therefore, three symbols can be sent for each sub-carrier at each instant.<br>
One data stream case for the 3x1 MIMO-OFDM open loop is summarized in Table 10.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
3x1 MIMO-OFDM (open loop) - two data stream case.<br>
In this case, an open loop structure should be used to send and recover two data streams. SM and SFBC are implemented with the fixed beamforming matrix and two data streams are divided into three spatial streams for each sub-carrier.<br>
For SM without FD, one data symbol is sent per one sub-carrier for each spatial stream and for SM with FD, one data symbol is sent per two sub-carriers for each spatial stream. Combination of FD and non-FD is possible.<br>
With SFBC, one data stream is sent and recovered by using SFBC and<br>
the other data stream does not use SFBC. Among three spatial streams for each sub-carrier, two spatial streams are used for SFBC and the other one is for the other data stream.<br>
Two data stream case for the 3x1 MIMO-OFDM open loop is summarized in Table 11.<br>
 (Table Removed)<br><br>
