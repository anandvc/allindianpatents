VALVE WITH WHICH TO CONTROL A FLUID<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The present invention emanates from a valve with which to control a fluid, particularly to control a gas, in accordance with the type defined in greater detail in the preamble of Patent Claim 1.<br>
This type of valve is established in the field and is, for example, a gas control valve that can be used in a gas engine or even in a fuel cell of a motor vehicle, i.e. of a commercial vehicle, for example, or in a steady-state application.<br>
An established valve of the type mentioned in the introduction, with the help of which combustion gas can be blown into an inlet manifold of a gas engine or of a fuel cell, comprises a valve body in which an electromagnetic operating unit for a magnet armature can be incorporated. The magnet armature in the valve body, especially in a sleeve of the valve body, is guided to move in an axial manner and is designed as a valve closing element in the front region, said valve closing element working together with a valve seat. Fluid flow from the supply side to the run-off side can be controlled subject to the position of the magnet armature and of the valve closing element respectively. The axis of the gas exhaust cone hereby coincides with the axis of the valve.<br>
When being used in connection with a gas engine, gas valves that are designed in the manner described above have, as a rule, due to technical reasons regarding installation, been inserted at a steep angle of, for example, between 45째 and 90째 to the axis of the inlet manifold. A gas pillow that acts as<br>
 <br>
a blocking layer to air, comes into existence in the inlet manifold due to this configuration, when gas is blown into the inlet manifold, said air layer being conveyed through the inlet manifold in the direction of a cylinder of the gas engine. The result of this, when opening the cylinder, is that the quantity of air that is required for combustion is not conveyed to the cylinder and/or losses with regard to volumetric efficiency have to be tolerated.<br>
When using the above described gas valve according to prior art in a fuel cell, the gas valve is usually installed in such a manner that its axis is at a right-angle to the axis of the gas supply unit. This could, hereby, result in the formation of stagnant waves within the gas supply unit. Unfavourable gas transport conditions exist due to the straight assembly of the metering valve.<br>
The object of the invention is to create a valve with which to control a fluid by means of which optimised gas conduction is achieved when using the same in connection with gas combustion engines or also in connection with fuel cells.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The valve according to the invention with which to control a fluid, particularly to control a gas, with characteristics according to the preamble of Patent Claim 1, in which a gas re-directing device and/or a gas distributing unit is provided at the run-off side, facilitates, through a corresponding layout of the gas redirecting device and/or distribution device, an optimised and defined induction of a gas into a chamber in which the valve ends, with regard to the respective requirements.<br>
 <br>
By re-directing the gas in the run-off side region of the valve, braking and/or blocking of the air mass streaming through the inlet manifold in the region between an air flow meter and a butterfly valve respectively on the one hand and between a cylinder and its inlet valve respectively on the other hand is prevented when the valve is used in an inlet manifold of a gas combustion engine. Gas re-direction ensures that the gas flow can be supplied in an optimised manner to the inlet manifold with regard to the inflow angle and the inflow quantity. In addition, a possible noise emission due, for example, to the emergence of a gas propulsion jet at a, for example, opposite plastic inlet manifold is avoided. A marked improvement of the combustion characteristics can be achieved when using the valve according to the invention in connection with a gas combustion engine compared to using a valve without a gas redirecting device at the run-off side.<br>
Optimisation of the gas flow characteristics in a gas supply unit can be achieved when using the valve designed according to the invention in a fuel cell.<br>
Furthermore, by using a gas re-directing and/or gas distributing device, good fuel management can be achieved through radial or axial gas direction. A reduction of the gas propulsion jet's speed is achieved in an axial discharge due to the gas re-directing and/or gas distributing device.<br>
The gas re-directing and/or gas distributing device can be designed as a single piece along with the valve body and can, thus, be manufactured as an integrated unit during injection moulding of the valve body, for example, or can even present a separate component that is pasted, welded or grouted to the valve body and/or to a component of the valve located in the run-off side region.<br>
 <br>
In the case of a particularly cost-effective embodiment of the valve, according to the invention, the re-directing device is formed from a bent or angled pipe section. This type of gas re-directing device presents a component that can be easily incorporated in a valve. The pipe section has, for example, a run-off sided discharging nozzle whose axis spans an angle of between 60째 and 90째 with the axis of the valve. The pipe section can also be closed at the front side and be provided with radial discharge openings.<br>
If the pipe section presents a separate component, it is of advantage to design it in such a manner that it can be attached to the run-off sided connecting piece of the valve body whose outer diameter corresponds to the inner diameter of the pipe section. Already existing gas valves can be modified in terms of the invention particularly with this type of layout design.<br>
In the case of an alternative embodiment of the valve according to the invention, the gas re-directing device and/or the gas distributing device is formed by a perforated plate that is fitted to the run-off side of the valve and has a linear channel that can be engaged opposite the axis of the valve. The perforated plate is, for example, manufactured from a synthetic material or a metal.<br>
In order to ensure efficient functioning of the valve, the cross-section of the stream of the channels is at least twice as large as a dosing cross-section defined at the valve seat.<br>
The invention also has an inlet manifold of a gas combustion engine as an object that is designed with a pipe casing that is clamped by a valve designed<br>
 <br>
according to the invention, said valve dipping into the inner chamber of the pipe casing.<br>
The invention, furthermore, has a fuel cell with at least one gas supply unit as an object and that has a gas inflow channel, whereby at least one valve designed according to the invention dips into the gas inflow channel.<br>
Other advantages and beneficial designs of the object according to the invention can be gathered from the description, the drawings and patent claims.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
An inlet manifold 10 that leads to a cylinder of a gas combustion engine of a motor vehicle is illustrated in Figure 1. The inlet manifold 10 comprises a pipe casing 11 that borders an inner chamber 12 that serves as the flow path for gases fed to the cylinder, said gases comprising, on the one hand, air conveyed in an axial direction of the pipe casing 11 as indicated by arrow X and combustion gas, on the other hand, that is blown into the inner chamber 12 of the pipe casing 11 by means of a gas injection valve 13. A conventional gas injection valve 13' is illustrated in the left hand section of Figure 1 in order to help clarify the invention.<br>
The gas injection valve 13, designed according to the invention, is located at the right hand side of Figure 1 and is an electromagnetically operated valve with a valve body 14 in which an electromagnetic operating unit for a valve closing element is located that is not illustrated here in greater detail, that is guided in the valve body 14 and works together with a valve seat so that a fuel gas stream can be controlled from a supply side 15 to a run-off side 16 of the gas valve 13.<br>
A re-directing device 17 that is pasted to the valve body 14 and is designed as a pipe section is located at the run-off side 16 of the gas valve 13.<br>
The re-directing device 17 has a discharge nozzle 18 whose axis forms angle y with the axis of the pipe casing 11 of the inlet manifold 10.<br>
 <br>
The axis of valve 13 forms angle a with the axis of pipe casing 11 of the inlet manifold 10. This type of layout design of the gas valve 13 and this type of layout of the re-directing device 17 results in fuel gas A that is being blown into the inlet manifold 10 being brought into the inner chamber 12 of the inlet manifold 10 at a flat inflow angle. Flow of air in the inner chamber 12 is thus not impaired.<br>
On the other hand, a fuel gas pillow C forms when blowing in fuel gas in the case of gas injection valve 13' designed in the conventional manner and located in the left region of Figure 1, whose axis, like the axis of the pipe casing 11, also forms an angle a of 60째, for example, and that does not have any gas re-directing device, said fuel gas cushion acting as a blocking layer for the air conveyed through the inlet manifold 10 as per arrow X.<br>
The layout design of a gas valve according to the invention thus results in a significant improvement of the combustion characteristics of a gas engine.<br>
A gas supply unit 20 of a fuel cell used in a motor vehicle is illustrated in Figure 2. The gas supply unit 20, which serves to supply hydrogen to the fuel cell, comprises an inflow channel 21 that leads to gas injection valves 22A, 22B, 22C and 23 that, in turn, lead to a run-off channel 24 at the run-off side, said channel being connected to the fuel cell.<br>
Gas injection valves 22A, 22B and 22C are designed in the conventional manner so that the hydrogen that is metered by means of these valves is metered at right angles to the axis of the run-off channel 24, as is illustrated by means of valve 22C.<br>
 <br>
Valve 23 is, on the other hand, designed according to the invention so that it exhibits a valve body at whose run-off sided end a gas re-directing device 17 is located that is designed as a pipe section and effectuates a re-direction of gas metered by means of valve 25 by 90째. This type of re-direction of the hydrogen stream results in an improved gas stream in the run-off channel 24.<br>
Figures 3 to 5 present different embodiments of a gas re-directing device that is designed like a pipe section and located at the run-off end of a gas valve which is designed for a gas combustion engine application or a fuel cell application respectively.<br>
The gas valve according to Figure 3 comprises a valve body 31 that is fixed at a valve receiver 32 and is provided with a pipe section type of re-directing device 17' at its run-off sided end, said re-directing device being composed of a curved pipe section and metered gas re-directed by approximately 90째. The cross-section of the re-directing device 17' remains constant along its entire length.<br>
The gas valve according to Figure 4 also comprises a valve body 31 that is fixed in a valve receiver 32. The valve body 31 has a re-directing device 17" at the run-off sided end, said device producing a gas flow re-directed by 60째, for example, said device too being designed from a curved pipe section with a constant inner diameter.<br>
The version in Figure 5 differentiates itself from that in Figures 3 and 4 in that the valve body 31 is provided with a pipe section-type of re-directing device 17'" that results in a re-direction of the gas flow by 90째 and whose inner diameter at the run-off sided end is less than the supply-sided end. The inner<br>
 <br>
diameter at the supply-sided end corresponds to the outer diameter of a connecting piece 33 of the valve body 31.<br>
Figure 6 presents a section of a gas injection valve 60 that is provided with a valve body 61 that receives an electromagnetic operating unit for a magnet armature 63, that can be guided to move in an axial manner in sleeve 64 and supports itself in the established manner through a re-set spring at a plug-type of insert.<br>
At its run-off sided end, magnet armature 63 is designed as a valve closing element 67 that works together with a valve seat 68 to control a gas stream through the dosing pipes 69.<br>
A perforated plate 70 is located downstream from dosing pipes 69, said plate being located at sleeve 64 allocated to the valve body 61. The perforated plate 70 is secured against axial movement in the downstream direction by a collar 72 at the seat base sleeve 64. The perforated plate 70 is manufactured from a synthetic material, for example, and exhibits several linear channels 71 that are parallel and whose axes are engaged opposite the axis of valve 60. The angle that the axes of channels 71 spans with the axis of valve 60 amounts to approximately 30째 in the present case but can also amount to 60째 or more depending upon the operating conditions. This angle determines the flow direction of the gas.<br>
The summed-up cross-section of the stream of channels 71 is at least twice as large as the dosing cross-section of the dosing pipes 69 that are designed in the region of the valve seat 68. This ensures that the main constriction in the valve 60 lies at the valve seat 68.<br>
 <br>
Figure 8 presents a gas injection valve 80 designed according to the gas injection valve in Figure 6, said valve 80 being provided with a perforated plate 70' at its run-off side 16, the plate being fitted to valve sleeve 64. The perforated plate 70' is also manufactured from a synthetic material and has several curved and/or curvilinear channels 71' that have a similar curvature.<br>
Another embodiment of a gas injection valve 90 of the type illustrated in Figure 6 is presented in Figure 9, said valve also being furnished with a perforated plate 70" at its run-off side, said plate being fitted to valve sleeve 64. The perforated plate 70", however, has linear channels 71" whose axes are aligned parallel to the axis of the gas injection valve 90.<br>
Figure 10 presents another gas injection valve of the type illustrated in Figure 6. The gas injection valve 100 also comprises a perforated plate 70'" in the region of its run-off side 16, said plate being fitted to valve sleeve 64 and being secured in the same. The perforated plate 70"' has net-like linear channels 71"' that are partially engaged opposite the axis of the gas injection valve 100 and aligned partially parallel to the axis of the gas injection valve 100.<br>
A gas injection valve 110 that is inserted in a valve port 111 of an inlet manifold of a gas engine is illustrated in Figure 11. The gas injection valve 110 comprises a valve body 112 onto which a pot-like and/or pipe section type of gas re-directing and gas distributing device 117 is placed in the region of a runoff side 16 i.e., in the region of a valve section that dips into the inlet manifold. The gas re-directing and gas distributing device 117 comprises a floor 118 in which linear channels 119 are designed that are engaged opposite the axis of the gas injection valve 110. Linear channels 119 thus bring about a redirection and distribution of the gas blown in by the gas injection valve 110.<br>
 <br>
Figure 12 presents a gas injection valve 120 that is also inserted in a valve port 111 of an inlet manifold of a gas engine and has a valve body 112 onto which a pipe-section type of gas re-directing and gas distributing device 117' is placed in the region of the discharge side 16. The gas re-directing and gas distributing device 117' has a front side that is closed by floor 118' and four discharge openings 121 distributed along the periphery at its side wall, of which three are illustrated in Figure 12.<br>
Another embodiment of the gas injection valve 130 is illustrated in Figure 13. The gas injection valve 130 differentiates itself from the one according to Figure 12 in that it has a front-sided, closed, pipe-section type of gas redirecting and gas distributing device 117' that is not curvilinear but is straight instead. The axis of the gas re-directing and gas distributing device 117" thus coincides with the axis of gas injection valve 130. Corresponding to the embodiment presented in Figure 12, the gas re-directing and gas distributing device 117" has four gas discharge openings 121 distributed along its periphery, said openings being aligned in a radial manner relative to the axis of the gas re-directing and gas distributing device 117", three of these openings being illustrated in Figure 13.<br>
A gas injection valve 140 is presented in Figure 14 that essentially corresponds to the valve in Figure 13 but differentiates itself in that it is furnished with potlike gas re-directing and gas distributing device 117'" that has six gas discharge openings 121' distributed along its periphery of which four are illustrated in Figure 14. Apart from that, the design of the gas injection valve 140 corresponds to that of the gas injection valve in Figure 13.<br>
