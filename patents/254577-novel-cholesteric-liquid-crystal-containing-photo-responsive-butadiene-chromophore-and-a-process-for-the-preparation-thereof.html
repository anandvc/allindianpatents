				<td>The present invention relates to a color image recording medium and information recording process making use of novel thermo- and photo-responsive butadiene-linked cholesterols possessing chiral nematic liquid crystalline phases. The rewritable full colour image recording medium consisting of a pair of substrates at least one of which is transparent, containing an intermediate photo and thermoresponsive layer. The intermediate photo- and thermo-responsive layer consists of a butadiene linked cholesterol-liquid crystalline material. Rapid cooling of the cholesteric phase formed at high temperatures to ~0 Â°C results in formation of glasses in which the reflected colour characteristic of the film at the temperature from which it is cooled is retained. The colour of the glasses thus formed can be tuned by controlling the temperature of the film or irradiating it with UV light in the 350 nm region prior to formation of glass by rapid cooling. Using these processes the films can be tuned to any colour. These devices can therefore be used to record highly stable full color images by controlled heating or UV irradiation of the films. Images recorded by controlling the temperature can be erased by heating the sample, while images recorded using UV irradiation can be erased by irradiating with light in 266 nm region. The device is useful therefore for recording full colour images in a reversible manner.</td>

				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel cholesteric liquid crystal containing photoresponsive butadiene chromophore. Particularly it relates to cholesteric liquid crystal,containing photoresponsive butadiene chromophore possessing chiral nematic liquid crystalline phases and a color image recording medium and an information recording process making use of these liquid crystals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INEVNTION<br>
Design and development of organic photoresponsive materials has been an area of immense interest mainly due to their application in imaging and information recording devices (Reference may be made to US Patent No. 6,740,255; Ikeda, T. J. Mater. Chem. 2003, 13, 2037). Liquid crystals are especially useful for such applications since microscopic molecular perturbations occurring within them can be amplified to macroscopic levels, resulting in significant changes in their optical properties (Reference may be made to Demus ef a/. Handbook of Liquid Crystals , Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 1998; Ikeda, J. Mater. Chem., 2003, 13, 2037; Chen et al. Adv. Mater. 2003, 15, 1061; Walba ef al. Science 2000, 288, 2181; Eichhorn et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 12742; D. Demus, in Modern Topics in Liquid Crystals, ed. A. Buka, New Jersey, 1993). Cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) possess the inherent property of selective reflection of different wavelengths of light which arises due to a helical ordering of the molecules in the macroscopic scale (Reference may be made to F. Reinitzer, Monatsh, 1888, 9, 421; Chandrasekhar, S. Liquid crystals; 2nd ed.; Cambridge: Cambridge, 1992). The wavelength of light reflected by such materials depends on the pitch length of the helical ordering, which in turn is highly sensitive to external stimuli such as temperature, pressure and the presence of external impurities (Reference may be made to Ruslim, C. and Ichimura, K. J. Phys. Chem. B 2000, 104, 6529; Moriyama, M.; Song, S.; Matsuda, H.; Tamaoki, N. J. Mater. Chem. 2001, 11, 1003; Chen et al. Adv. Mater. 2003, 15, 1061; Mallia, V. A. and Tamaoki, N. Chem. Mater. 2003, 15, 3237; Delden ef al. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2003, 13, 319).<br>
These aspects have been subjects of innumerable studies and also make CLCs useful in a variety of display and information reading applications. The fluidity of CLCs however, has been disadvantageous in various applications, especially those pertaining to long-term storage of information. For such applications additional measures such as polymerization following the information recording process are often required (Reference may be made to Brehmer et al. Adv. Mater. 1998, 10, 17; Witte et al. Liq.<br>
Cryst. 1998, 24, 819; Tamaoki, N. Adv. Mater. 2001, 13, 1135). Furthermore, there are illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,183,666 and 6,537,711 by Tamaoki and co-workers, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, cholesteric glassy liquid crystals as efficient materials for recording full colour mages in a rewriteable manner, which can also be stored over long periods of time. These systems have made use of dimesogens containing two cholesteryl groups linked with diyne and alkylchains, which form cholesteric liquid crystals which can be reversibly solidified into a glassy form which retains all the properties of selective reflections of different wavelengths of light exhibited by the cholesteric films (Reference may be made to Tamaoki, N.; Song, S; Moriyama, M.; Matsuda, H. Adv. Mater. 2000, 12, 94; Tamaoki, N.; Aoki, Y.; Moriyama, M.; Kidowaki, M. Chem. Mater. 2003, 15, 719; Mallia, V. A.; Tamaoki, N. Chew. Soc. Rev. 2004, 33, 7; Mallia, V. A.; Tamaoki, N. J. Mater. Chem. 2003, 13, 219).<br>
When these dimesogens are doped with dialkyl azobenzene derivatives possessing alkyl chains of suitable length and the films are irradiated with UV light in the 350 nm region, photoisomerization of the azobenzene derivative affect the cholesteric pitch of the CLC. This leads to a change in the colour of the film. In a recent US Patent No. 6,103,431 by Tamaoki and co-workers, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, these devices could be used for recording full colour images with long term stability, which could be erased by simply reheating the glass film to its cholesteric state.<br>
Although such devices could be used for recording colour images, they possess some disadvantages. The main disadvantage was the cis isomers of azobenzene are thermally unstable and revert back rapidly to the trans isomer a process, which can occur before the glassification process is completed. The second major disadvantage is that the photoresponsive material is a mixture consisting of a host liquid crystalline method and a photoisomerizable guest material, which can potentially lead to crystallization on long term storage. In a recent study we could overcome the problem of thermal stability of the photoisomers by using photoisomerizable butadiene derivatives as the guest materials (Reference may be made to Davis et al. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2004, 14, 74). These could be used to develop colour images of much better quality. However these systems also consist of a mixture of two different materials and long-term stability due to crystallization of the glass can be a major problem in such mixed systems.<br>
In this invention we describe the synthesis of a novel cholesteric liquid crystal, which consists of the photoresponsive butadiene chromophore which is covalently<br>
linked to the cholesterol derivative. This results in formation of cholesteric liquid crystals, which are inherently photoactive. Using these materials we can record full colour images, which are thermally stable. The images could also be erased by irradiating the material with short wavelength UV light (266 nm).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide novel inherently photoactive chiral nematic liquid crystals containing a butadiene chromophore covalently connected to a cholesterol derivative using suitable linkers. These novel cholesterol derivatives possess a chiral nematic phase, which can selectively reflect different wavelength of light depending upon the temperature. Rapid cooling of their chiral nematic phases result in the formation of stable transparent glasses in which the chiral nematic superstructure is maintained. As a result these, glasses can selectively reflect different wavelength of light. The wavelength of light reflected depend upon the temperature from which are rapidly cooled.<br>
In addition thin glassy film of these materials formed between two transparent slides separated using appropriated spacers can be used for recording coloured images. This can be achieved by heating the film to its chiral nematic phase temperature until it shows the desired colour and then rapidly cooling it to form a glass. Alternatively irradiating the chiral nematic film using ultraviolet light in the 350 nm region, results in change of the pitch with corresponding change in the reflected colour. With increasing irradiation time the colour of the film can change from red to green to blue due to photoisomerization of the butadiene chromophore. Thus by controlling the time of irradiation any colour can be generated in the film. The image thus formed are of high resolution and are stable over extended periods of time (&gt;1 year). The image can be erased by irradiating the imaged film using short wavelength ultraviolet light region.<br>

The present invention has been completed based on the above findings and accordingly the present invention provides novel butadiene linked cholesterol derivatives represented by the Formula 1 shown in Figure 1 and derivatives thereof.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is that the material process a chiral nematic phase at high temperature, which can selectively reflect different wavelength of light depending upon the derivative and the temperature.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is that the chiral nematic phases can be rapidly cooled to form stable glasses in which the superstructure of the chiral nematic phase is retained. These glasses are capable of selectively reflecting light depending upon the temperature from which they are cooled.<br>
Yet another embodiment is that the colour which is fixed in the above manner can be erased by heating the film to its melt state.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention is that the wavelength of reflected light can be suitably controlled by irradiating the chiral nematic phases of varying period of time using ultraviolet light in the 350 nm. Using this method coloured image can be recorded on the film. The image thus formed can be stored over extended periods of time by rapidly cooling the material whereby it forms glasses in which the recorded image stored in a stable manner over extended period of time.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention is that the stored colour images can be erased by irradiating the glass film using short wavelength UV light in the wavelength range of 260 nm.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration.<br>

Example 1 Synthesis of a compound of formula 1a<br>
4-Hydroxy-4'-cyano-diphenylbutadiene (Structure 2) was prepared as per the Scheme in Figure 9. 4-methoxy-4'-cyano-diphenylbutadiene (Structure 1) in 84% yield was prepared according to known literature procedures. Structure 1 (1 g, 3.82 mmol) was weighed and dissolved in dry dichloromethane (35 ml) and stirred for 10 min. The reaction mixture was kept in ice for 5 min and boron tribromide (1.81 ml, 0.02 moles) was added drop wise keeping the reaction mixture at 0 Â°C. The solution was stirred for half an hour in ice and for 3 hours at room temperature. The mixture was cooled in ice and 50 ml of distilled water was added to it. The precipitate was filtered and dissolved in a mixture of diethylether and dichloromethane and reprecipitated by adding hexane. The precipitate was filtered and recrystallized from ethanol and dried to get 4-Hydroxy-4'-cyano-diphenylbutadiene (Structure 2, 70%). To Structure 2 (1g) dissolved in minimum amount of DMF, K2CO3 (2eq) was added and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes. 12-Bromododecanol (1.2 eq) was added dropwise. The mixture was heated for 12 hours at 100Â°C, following which it was cooled and poured into ice water. The solution was neutralized with 1:1 HCI and the precipitate was filtered. The precipitate was dissolved in CHCI3 and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The product was then purified by column chromatography using silica (100-200 mesh) and ethylacetate and hexane (1:1) as eluent to get Structure 3 (59%). To Structure 3 (1g, 2.3 mmol) dissolved in benzene (30 ml) was added pyridine (3 ml) and the solution was stirred well to dissolve the compound. Cholesteryl chloroformate (1.03 g, 2.3 mmol) in benzene (30 mL) was added dropwise and the mixture was refluxed for 24 hours at 80Â°C. Excess benzene and pyridine were distilled out under reduced pressure and the product obtained was dissolved in dichloromethane and precipitated using methanol. The product was purified by column chromatography using silca gel (100-200 mesh) and ethyl acetate and hexane (1:9) as eluent to get the corresponding cholesterol containing butadiene derivative Formula 1a (53%).

The phase transition behavior of the butadiene linked cholesterol derivatives are summarized in Table 1.<br>
Table 1 Phase transition characteristics of the butadiene linked cholesterol derivatives<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Boundary A* G- Glass, and I - Isotropic;a As observed by DSC.<br>
Example 8<br>
All the other derivatives show similar phase transition characteristics with their cholesteric pitch sensitive to external stimuli such as temperature, pressure and amount of cis isomers<br>
Example 9<br>
These materials when heated to their chiral nematic phase exhibit the characteristic reflection of specific wavelength depending upon the temperature. Figures 5 &amp; 7 shows the variation in the reflection band as a function of temperature. The wavelength shifts from long to short wavelength representative of change in colour of the film from red to green. These films can be rapidly cooled to retain any of these colours in a stable glassy state.<br>
Example 10<br>
These materials when irradiated at smectic liquid crystalline phase using UV light in 350 nm region, isothermal phase transition to chiral nematic phase occurs. The pitch of the cholesteric helix thus formed was found to be highly sensitive to the ratio of cis/trans isomers. With increasing ratio of cis isomer cholesteric pitch shortened with corresponding hypsochromic shift in reflection band. Figure 6 shows the variation in the reflection band as a function of irradiation time. The wavelength shifts from NIR to visible region with different intervals of irradiation time. These films can be rapidly cooled to retain any of these colours in a stable glassy state.<br>
The cholesterol-linked aryl butadienes of the present invention possess satisfactory properties for imaging and industrial applications. The main advantages of these systems include:<br>
1)	Cholesterol linked aryl butadienes can be used as single pure substances.<br>
2)	The synthetic methodology is economical.<br>
3)	They are quite stable under both thermal and photochemical conditions of the experiment.<br>
4)	The smectic to chiral nematic transition can be carried out using very small energy light<br>
1.5 mW cm-2 and the photochemical response are fast enough for imaging. 6) The thermal irreversibility of cis isomers of butadienes avoids blurring of image due to reverse isomerization.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
