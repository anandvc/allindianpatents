				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The Present invention relates to an apparatus for allocating codewords. The<br>
present invention relates to generation and allocation of modulation codes of source<br>
codes to be recorded on a recording medium, and more particularly, to a method for<br>
generating and allocating codewords in which codewords having a restricted run length<br>
are generated and the generated codewords are allocated so that the DC control<br>
characteristic of a code stream is maintained.<br>
In a Run Length Limited (RLL) code represented by (d, k, m, n), the performance<br>
of a code is evaluated mainly based on the recording density and the capability to<br>
suppress the DC component of the code. Here, m denotes the number of data bits (the<br>
number of so-called source data bits, which is also referred to as the number of<br>
information word bits), n denotes the number of codeword bits after modulation (the<br>
number of so-called channel bits), d denotes the minimum number of a series of 'Os' that<br>
can exist between T and T in a codeword, and k denotes the maximum number of a<br>
series of 'Os' that can exist between T and T in a codeword. The interval between bits in<br>
a codeword is represented by T.<br>
In a modulation method, to improve recording density it is used to reduce the<br>
number of codeword bits n while regarding d and m as given conditions. In the RLL<br>
code, however, d which is the minimum number of a series of 'Os' that can exist between<br>
T and T in a codeword, and k which is the maximum number of a series of'Os' that can<br>
exist between T and T in a codeword, should be satisfied. If, with this (d, k) condition<br>
satisfied, the number of data bits is m, the number of codewords satisfying RLL(d, k)<br>
should be equal to or greater than 2<m>. Moreover, in order to actually use this code, run<br>
length constraints, that is, RLL(d, k) conditions, should be satisfied in a part where a<br>
codeword is linked to another codeword. In addition, when the DC component of a code<br>
affects the system performance, it is desirable to use a code which has a DC suppression<br>
capability.<br>
The ffijwatit,n mason for suppressing the DC component in the RLL<br>
modulated eo* e stream is to minimize a reproducing signal's affect on a servo<br>
band. Herein, ifter, methods for suppressing the DC component will be referred<br>
to as Digital $ mi Vatue (DSV) control methods.<br>
DSV i^ol metres can Deoroadlyc^ssified into two types. One is a<br>
method having a OSV control code itself, where the DSV control code is<br>
capable of corjtrotiing a OSV. The other is a method of inserting a merge bit at<br>
each OSV control time. An Eight to Fourteen Modulation plus (EFM+) code<br>
performs DSV control using a separate code table, while An EFM code or a (1,<br>
7) code per<br>

Each main cor version code group and its corresponding code group form a pair<br>
so that the D

main conversion code groups. That is, there are no identical codewords<br>
between the n ain conversion code groups A and B. If duplicated codes are<br>
used, there mtiht be the conversion code groups C and D for demodulating the<br>
duplicated codes, where there are no identical codewords between the<br>
conversion code groups C and D, but codewords in the code group A or B may<br>

that in a low frequency band, the frequency spectrum of the<br>
stream according to the present invention is almost the same<br>
y spectrum of the EFM+, which indicates that the code stream of<br>
inrention has almost the same capability of suppressing DC<br>
that of the EFM+ method.<br>
Accord! igly, since the present invention uses 15-bit codes as the main<br>
code and selectively uses 17-bit DC control codes for controlling DC<br>
i present invention has better efficiency in recording density<br>
t EFM+ code and has the same DC suppression capability as<br>
the EFM+ code.<br>
Accoraing to the present invention, by using a short codeword having<br>
less bits as'e main conversion codeword, high efficiency is achieved in<br>
recording density.<br>
Also, When codewords which do not satisfy the run length conditions<br>
are replaced by other codewords, the codewords are allocated so that the DC<br>
suppression capability of the code stream can be maintained, and therefore<br>
higher DC suppression capability of the code stream is provided,<br><br><br>
