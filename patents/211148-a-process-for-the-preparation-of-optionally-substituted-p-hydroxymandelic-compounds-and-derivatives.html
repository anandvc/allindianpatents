A subject of the present invention is a process for the preparation of optionally substituted p-hydroxymandelic compounds and derivatives.<br>
In the disclosure of the invention which follows, the term, "optionally substituted p-hydroxymandelic compounds" is used to refer to an aromatic compound which carries at least one -CHOH-COOH group in para position of a hydroxyl group.<br>
The present invention relates, more particularly, to the preparation of p-hydroxymandelic acid and 3-methoxy p-hydroxymandelic acid<br>
One of the conventional synthesis routes for p-hydroxymandelic acids consists in carrying out the condensation, in alkaline medium, of glyoxylic acid on phenol and/or its corresponding derivatives.<br>
The yield is limited by the fact that the condensation reaction is not selective and also produces o-hydroxymandelic acids and dimandelic acids.<br>
Furthermore, the reaction yield is reduced due to a parasitic secondary reaction. In fact, glyoxylic acid in aqueous alkaline medium is converted according to Cannizaro's reaction into oxalic and glycolic acids.<br>
In order to prevent this Cannizaro's reaction from becoming dominant and destroying the glyoxylic acid, a proposal has been made in FR-A 2 132 364 for the condensation reaction to be carried out in a dilute aqueous medium and at low temperature or ambient temperature.<br>
In view of the difficulty in obtaining satisfactory reaction yields, it is important to control the various parameters of the process, and, in particular, the quality of the glyoxylic acid used.<br><br>
The most worthwhile process from an industrial viewpoint for the preparation of glyoxylic acid consists in oxidising the glyoxal with nitric acid. In this way, aqueous solutions of glyoxylic acid are obtained, which, in addition to unreacted glyoxal, also contain oxalic acid, organic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, glycolic acid, and nitric acid.<br>
Until now, new methods have been constantly sought for the separation and purification of glyoxylic acid.<br>
Therefore, a process was proposed in DE-A 1 198 339 which first and foremostly permitted the nitric acid to be eliminated, followed by the oxalic acid using basic ion exchange resins, followed by the glyoxal and the other impurities by over-concentration of the solution and crystallisation.<br>
In DE-A 2 501 743, a process was disclosed in which the glyoxylic acid is separated from these impurities by extraction using aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, or aliphatic esters of alcohols with low carbon condensation.<br>
A process for obtaining aqueous solutions of glyoxylic acid free from other acids has also been described in FR-A 2 552 426 which consists in treating the starting solution with an organic nitrogenous compound, preferably a tertiary amine, at a temperature which is at the most equal to 50Â°C, then in extracting the glyoxylic acid by extraction of the organic phase with water, at a higher temperature.<br>
A constant concem has therefore been noted in the prior art of providing a solution of glyoxylic acid which is free of impurities.<br>
Running counter to this teaching, it has been found that within the scope of preparing optionally substituted p-hydroxymandelic compounds condensation of glyoxylic acid and of the corresponding phenol is carried out with an increased yield, provided that said reaction is carried out in the presence of a dicarboxylic acid used in a certain quantity.<br>
A precise subject of the present invention is a process for the preparation of optionally substituted p-hydroxymandelic compounds and derivatives, which consists in carrying out the condensation, in water, in the presence of an alkaline agent, of an aromatic carrier compound<br><br>
with at least one hydroxyl group and the para position of which is free, with glyoxylic acid, said process being characterised in that the reaction is carried out in the presence of an effective quantity of a carrier compound with at least two carboxylic functions.<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, the use of a catalyst according to the invention allows the reaction yield to be increased.<br>
Another advantage of the process according to the invention is that it can involve a more technical glyoxylic acid containing, inter alia, oxalic acid.<br>
The process according to the invention is used, most particularly, with phenol but also with substituted phenols which have at least one non-substituted para position.<br>
The aromatic nucleus carries at least one hydroxyl group, but it can also carry one or more other substituents. Generally, "several substituents" means less than four substituenis per aromatic nucleus.<br>
Any substituent can be present provided that it is does not interfere in the reaction of<br>
the invention.<br>
Therefore, the process according to the invention is well suited for use with hydroxylated aromatic compounds corresponding to the following formula (I):<br><br>

In the afore-mentioned list of dicarboxylic acids, the compounds preferably used are: oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid.<br><br>
Aminopolycarboxylic acids are also perfectly well suited for implementation of the process according to the invention. As examples of aminopolycarboxylic acids suitable for use in the process of the mvention mention can be made of the following, inter alia:<br>
. ethylenediaminotetracetic acid (E.D.T.A.)<br>
. diethylenetriaminopentacetic acid (DT.P A.)<br>
. nitrilotriacetic acid (N.T.A.)<br>
. N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylene diaminotriacetic acid (H.E.D.T.A.)<br>
Of the afore-mentioned aminopolycarboxylic acids, ethylenediaminotetracetic acid is preferably selected.<br>
According to the process of the invention, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide which can be sodium or potassium hydroxide.<br>
For economic considerations, sodium hydroxide is preferably selected.<br>
With regard to the concentrations and quantities of reagents to be used, the preferred conditions are defined hereinbelow.<br>
In accordance with the process according to the invention a solution of glyoxylic acid is used. The concentration of said solution is not critical and can vary greatiy, e.g. between 15 and 70% by weight Preferably, commercial solutions are used, the concentration of which is approximately 50%.<br>
According to the process of the invention, the glyoxylic acid is reacted on the excess of the hydroxylated aromatic compound of formula (I), The molar ratio between the hydroxylated aromatic compound of formula (I) and the glyoxylic acid varies between 1.5 and 4.0 and is preferably selected between 2.0 and 3.0.<br>
The alkali metal hydroxide solution used has a concentration which is generally between 10 and 50% by weight The concentration of the starting solution is not critical. However, as the concentration of the hydroxylated aromatic compound of formula (I) is advantageously low in the reaction medium, a dilute solution of alkali metal is used to carry out the dilution of the reaction medium.<br><br>
The quantity of alkali metal hydroxide introduced into the reaction medium takes account of the quantity necessary to salify the hydroxyl function of the hydroxylated aromatic compound of formula (I) and of the quantity necessary to salify the carboxylic function of the glyoxylic acid.<br>
If the hydroxylated aromatic compound of formula (I) has salifiable functions other than the hydroxyl group, the quantity of alkali metal hydroxide necessary to salify all the salifiable functions which can be hydroxyl groups and/or COOH carboxylic functions is therefore introduced.<br>
Generally, the quantity of alkali metal hydroxide can vary greatly and be equal to, or approximately equal to, the stoichiometry, or in excess. Generally, the quantity of alkali metal hydroxide varies between 80 and 120% of the stoichiometric quantity.<br>
The concentration of the hydroxylated aromatic compound of formula (I) is preferably between 0.5 and 1.5 moles/litre, and, more particularly, in the region of 1 mole/litre.<br>
With regard to the quantity of catalyst used, this is determined in such a way that the molar ratio between the catalyst and the hydroxylated aromatic compound of formula (I) is between 0.005 and 0.025, and preferably between 0.01 and 0.02.<br>
The quantity of catalyst used, as expressed by the ratio between the number of moles of catalyst and the number of moles of glyoxylic acid is advantageously selected to be between 0.5 and 2.5%, preferably between 1 and 2%.<br>
The preferred catalyst is oxalic acid.<br>
The commercial solutions of glyoxalic acid can contain very low quantities of oxalic acid. The oxalic acid of the reaction can therefore be provided, in part, by the starting solution. In this case, it will be necessary to complete the quantity of oxalic acid by the addition of oxalic acid or of any other dicarboxylic acid in order that the afore-mentioned ratios are observed.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a solution of glyoxylic acid is advantageously used containing between 0.6 and 3%, preferably between 1.2 and 2.6%, by weight of oxalic acid, expressed in relation to the weight of glyoxylic acid.<br>
The reaction temperature is advantageously selected between 20Â°C and 60Â°C, and preferably between 30Â°C and 40Â°C.<br>
The process according to the invention is carried out at atmospheric pressure, but under a controlled inert gas atmosphere, preferably nitrogen or rare gases, in particular nitrogen.<br>
A preferred practical embodiment of the invention will be given hereinafter.<br>
The solution of glyoxylic acid and catalyst, and, in parallel, the solution of alkali metal hydroxide employed in a quantity necessary to salify the COOH function are introduced into a reaction medium containing the hydroxylated aromatic compound of formula (I), water and the alkali metal hydroxide in a quantity necessary to salify the hydroxyl group and other possible salifiable functions of the compound of formula (I).<br>
The reaction medium is kept under agitation and at the temperature selected within the afore-mentioned range for a variable period ranging from 1 to 10 hours.<br>
Another variant of the execution of the invention consists in adding the reaction catalyst not to the aqueous solution of glyoxylic acid but simultaneously with the hydroxylated aromatic compound of formula (I).<br>
At the end of the reaction, the optionally substituted p-hydroxymandelic acid obtained is separated in salified form using conventional separation techniques, in particular crystallisation.<br>
The process according to the invention is quite particularly well suited when an aqueous solution of glyoxylic acid is used containing monofunctional acids, such as formic and glycolic acid, and, in particular, when acetic acid is present in a concentration which is variable between 0.1 and 3%.<br><br>
The process according to the invention results in the production of optionally substituted p-hydroxymandciic compounds which can be represented by the following formula (IV):<br><br>
These products are particulariy worthwhile since they are intermediate products, which, inter alia, allow hydroxyarylacetic acids to be obtained by reduction and hydroxyarylglyoxylic (= hydroxyaryl Ä-oxo acetic) acids or hydroxyaromatic aldehydes to be obtained by oxidation.<br>
A preferred use of the invention is the preparation of hydroxyaromatic aldehydes by oxidation of the compounds of formula (IV) obtained according to the invention.<br>
The oxidation of the compounds of formula (IV) can be carried out according to the techniques described in writings. Thus, reference can be made to P. HEBERT [Bull. Soc. Chim, France, 27, p, 45-55 (1920)] and to NAGAI SHIGEKI et al [JP-A 76/128934]. The oxidation is generally carried out using oxygen or air under pressure, in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, such as derivatives of chromium, cobalt, copper, vanadum or osmium, for example.<br>
Therefore, the invention allows easy access to 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde and to vanillin and its analogues, e.g, 3-ethyl, 3-isopropyl vanillin, by oxidation respectively of p-hydroxymandelic acid and of 3-methoxy p-hydroxymandelic acids, and 3-ethoxy p-hydroxy-mandelic or 3-isopropoxy p-hydroxymandelic acids.<br>
The-following examples illustrate the invention, without however lumiting it.<br><br>
In the examples, the percentages stated are expressed by weight.<br>
The abbreviations mentioned in the examples have the following meanings:<br>
Conversion (TT)    =	number of moles of guaiacol converted<br>
number of moles of guaiacol introduced<br>
Yield (RR)	=        number of moles of mandelic acid formed<br>
number of moles of mandelic acid introduced<br>
Selectivity (RT)     =        number of moles of mandelic acid formed<br>
number of moles of guaiacol converted<br>
Example 1<br>
-	600 g distilled water,<br>
-	91.6 g (0.687 mol) of a 30% aqueous soda solution,<br>
-	93 g (0.750 mol) guaiacol<br>
are introduced into a 1-litre glass reaction vessel equipped with a double jacket, a pH electrode, a temperature probe, a condenser, an inert gas supply, and a mechanical agitation device.<br>
