				<td>MICROELECTRONIC CLEANING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING<br>
AMMONIA-FREE FLUORIDE SALTS FOR<br>
SELECTIVE PHOTORESIST STRIPPING AND PLASMA ASH RESIDUE<br>
CLEANING<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to ammonia-free fluoride salt containing cleaning compositions for cleaning microelectronic substrates, and particularly to such cleaning compositions useful with and having improved compatibility with microelectronic substrates characterized by sensitive porous and IOW-K and high-K dielectrics and copper metallization. The invention also relates to the use of such cleaning compositions for stripping photoresists, cleaning residues from plasma generated organic, organometallic and inorganic compounds, and cleaning residues from penalization processes, such as chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), as well as an additive in planarization slurry residues.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Many photoresist strippers and residue removers have been proposed for use in the microelectronics field as downstream or back end of the manufacturing line cleaners. In the manufacturing process a thin film of photoresist is deposited on a wafer substrate, and then circuit design is imaged on the thin film. Following baking, the unpolymerized resist is removed with a photoresist developer. The resulting image is then transferred to the underlying material, which is generally a dielectric or metal, by way of reactive plasma etch gases or chemical etchant solutions. The etchant gases or chemical etchant solutions selectively attack the photoresist-unprotected area of the substrate. As a result of the plasma etching process, photoresist, etching gas and etched material by-products are deposited as residues around or on the sidewall of the etched openings on the substrate.<br><br>
Additionally, following the termination of the etching step, the resist mask must be removed from the protected area of the wafer so that the final finishing operation can take place. This can be accomplished in a plasma ashing step by the use of suitable plasma ashing gases or wet chemical strippers. Finding a suitable cleaning composition for removal of this resist mask material without adversely affecting, e.g., corroding, dissolving or dulling, the metal circuitry has also proven problematic.<br>
As microelectronic fabrication integration levels have increased and patterned microelectonic device dimensions have decreased, it has become increasingly common in the art to employ copper metallizations, IOW-K and high-K dielectrics. These materials have presented additional challenges to find acceptable cleaner compositions. Many process technology compositions that have been previously developed for "traditional" or "conventional" semiconductor devices containing Al/Si02 or AI(Cu)/Si02 structures cannot be employed with copper metallized IOW-K or high-K dielectric structures. For example, hydroxylamine based stripper or residue remover compositions are successfully used for cleaning devices with Al metallizations, but are practically unsuitable for those with copper metallizations. Similarly, many copper metallized/ IOW-K strippers are not suitable for Al metallized devices unless significant adjustments in the compositions are made.<br>
Removal of these etch and/or ash residues following the etch and/or ashing process has proved problematic. Failure to completely remove or neutralize these residues can result in the absorption of moisture and the formation of undesirable materials that can cause corrosion to the metal structures. The circuitry materials are corroded by the undesirable materials and produce discontinuances in the circuitry wiring and undesirable increases in electrical resistance.<br><br>
The current back end cleaners show a wide range of compatibility with certain, sensitive dielectrics and metallizations, ranging from totally unacceptable to marginally satisfactory. Many of the current strippers or residue cleaners are not acceptable for advanced interconnect materials such as porous and IOW-K and high-K dielectrics and copper metallizations. Additionally, the typical alkaline cleaning solutions employed are overly aggressive towards IOW-K and high-K dielectrics and/or copper metallizations. Moreover, many of these alkaline cleaning compositions contain organic solvents that show poor product stability, especially at higher pH ranges and at higher process temperatures.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is, therefore, a need for microelectronic cleaning compositions suitable for back end cleaning operations which compositions are effective cleaners and are applicable for stripping photoresists and cleaning plasma ash residues from plasma process generated organic, organometallic and inorganic materials. This invention relates to compositions that are effective in stripping photoresists, preparing/cleaning ashed semiconductor surfaces and structures with good compatibility with advanced interconnect materials and copper metallizations.<br>
It has been discovered that ammonia (NH3) and ammonia-derived salts, such as NH4X where X is fluoride, fluoroborate or the like, are capable of dissolving /corroding metals such as copper through complex formation. Thus they are poor choices to be used in semiconductor cleaning formulations when compatibility of porous and IOW-K dielectrics and copper metallizations are required. These compounds can generate ammonia through equilibrium process. Ammonia can form complex with metals such as copper and result in metal corrosion/dissolution as set forth in the following possible equations.<br>
NH4F o NH3 + HF   (Equation 1)<br><br>
2NH4F + H20-&gt; NH3 + NH4F.HF (Equation 2)<br>
Cu + 2 NH3 -&gt; [ Cu (NH3)2]+ -► [ Cu (NH3)2]2+ (Equation 3)<br>
Thus, ammonium fluoride can provide nucleophilic and metal-chelating ammonia (NH3) through the equilibrium process described in Equation 1 or 2, particularly when other bases such as amines and alkanolamines are added. In the presence of oxygen, metals such as copper can be dissolved/corroded through complex formation with ammonia, as described in Equation 3. Such complex formation can further shift the equilibrium (Equation 1 or 2) to the right, and provide more ammonia, leading to higher metal dissolution/corrosion.<br>
Hydrofluoric acid (HF) attacks and destroys sensitive IOW-K dielectrics, such as hydrogen silsequioxane (HSQ) and methyl silsequioxane (MSQ), especially at acidic pH ranges. The presence of HF, even at small percentages, can be very harmful. Ammonia and ammonia-derived salts also show poor compatibility with sensitive dielectrics, such as hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) and methyl silsesquioxane (MSQ). Again, they can provide ammonia and/or other nucleophiles, and thus lead to reaction/degradation of sensitive dielectrics. Fluoride salts derived * from primary or secondary amines are undesirable for sensitive IOW-K dielectrics. They can provide efficient nucleophiles, such as the corresponding primary and secondary amines, through mechanisms similar to the aforementioned equations 1 to 3.<br>
It has been discovered that cleaning formulations containing non-ammonium and non-HF producing producing fluoride salts (non-ammonium, quaternary ammonium fluoride salts) show much improved compatibility with sensitive porous and IOW-K and high-K dielectrics and copper metallization. Any suitable non-ammonium producing, non-HF producing fluoride salt can be employed in the cleaning compositions of this invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The novel back end cleaning composition of this invention will comprise one or more of any suitable non-ammonium producing, non-HF producing fluoride salt (non-ammonium, quaternary ammonium fluoride salt) in a suitable solvent. Among the suitable non-ammonia producing, non-HF producing fluoride salts there may be mentioned tetraalkylammonium fluorides of the formula (R)4N+ P, where each R is independently a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, preferably alkyl of from 1 to 22, and more preferably 1 to 6, carbon atoms (R* H), such as tetramethylammonium fluoride and tetrabutylammonium fluoride salts; as well as fluoroborates, tetrabutylammonium fluoroborates, aluminum hexafluorides, antimony fluoride and the like.<br>
The non-ammonium producing, non-HF producing fluoride salts show significantly improved compatibility with IOW-K dielectrics and copper metallization. Tetraalkylammonium salts, such as tetramethylammonium fluoride (TMAF) can be blended and dissolved in water, certain anhydrous organic solvents, or water and * one or more polar, water miscible organic solvents. Selection of a copper/low-K compatible "friendly" solvent is also advantageous. Any suitable solvent free of strong nucleophiles, such as unhindered primary or secondary amines, is preferably employed. Preferred solvents do not include unhindered nucleophiles, and include for example, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sulfolane (SFL), dimethyl piperidone, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-pyrrolidinone (HEP), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and dimethylacetamide and the like. Polar nitrile-containing solvents, such as acetonitrile, isobutylnitrile and the like, can be especially advantageous.<br>
Moreover, whereas anhydrous ammonium fluoride is practically insoluble in most organic solvents, in contradistinction, tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts, such as for example tetramethylammmonium fluoride (TMAF), can be blended and<br><br>
completely dissolved in organic solvents, such as for example 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-pyrrolidinone (HEP). Thus, a very simple, completely anhydrous, and effective cleaning compositions for cleaning photoresist and ash residues from substrates having a IOW-K dielectric and copper metallization can be readily prepared- An example of such completely anhydrous cleaning composition is 50 parts by weight HEP and 0.8 parts by weight TMAF.<br>
Additionally, while not required by the fluoride salt-containing cleaning compositions of this invention, it may in some instances be desirable to optionally include in the cleaning compositions one or more "corrosion inhibiting solvent", i.e., a solvent compound that has at least two sites capable of complexing with metal is employed.<br>

The most preferable metal ion-free silicate component is tetramethyl ammonium silicate. Other suitable metal ion-free silicate sources for this invention may be generated in-situ by dissolving any one or more of the following materials in the highly alkaline cleaner.
