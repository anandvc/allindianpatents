Dated this 31 day of August 2006 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
MULTI-FUNCTIONAL SUPPORT MEANS FOR HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES SUCH AS FREEZERS, REFRIGERATORS AND THE LIKE<br>
The present invention relates to a multi-functional support means for household electrical appliances, particularly for freezers, in accordance with the introduction to the main claim. It relates in particular to a multi functional support means for heavy household electrical appliances which in certain situations need to be shifted with agility, but can also be used for appliances of static position.<br>
Household electrical appliances are known to rest on the floor via support means in the form of feet, usually four in number. These feet are well known, they being substantially profiled plastic protuberances fixed to the lower surface of the appliance. In the more costly appliances of this type, instead of feet, which represent static support means, support means in the form of wheels are present, these facilitating shifting of the appliance. These wheel-type support means are often positioned only on the rear side so that the appliance has merely to be lifted on its front side to enable it to be comfortably moved. When the front side is again lowered it rests on the floor, the appliance then maintaining the position attained.<br>
A drawback of the known art is that such an appliance is provided either with wheels or with static support feet, with the result that when the support means (static or wheel-type) has been mounted it can no longer be changed other than by very difficult removal and mounting operations.<br><br>
The two different support means must also be produced and kept in store and the appropriate one mounted at the time of order. An object of the present invention is to provide a support device which can be easily transformed from static to movable or vice versa. A further object of the present invention is to provide a support device which is economical and easily installed.<br>
This and further objects are attained by a multi-functional support device especially for household electrical appliances such as refrigerators, freezers and the like in accordance with the technical teachings of the accompanying claims.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages will be apparent from the description of a preferred but non-exclusive embodiment of the support device, illustrated by way of non-limiting example in the accompanying drawing, in which the single figure shows a perspective view of the support device of the present invention-Said figure shows a foot for household electrical appliances, particularly refrigerators, freezers and the like, which is indicated overall by 1. It comprises a connection plate 2, from which there projects, in one piece therewith, a static support part 3. The support part 3 lowerly presents a substantially flat surface 3a which acts as the floor support during static use of the appliance to which the support means is applied via the connection plate. In the interior of said support element 3 there is formed a compartment 5 containing, again in one piece therewith, snap connection means in the form of a cradle acting as a seat 4 for the shaft 6 of a wheel 7; said means enable the wheel to rotate, they presenting a<br><br>
cradle part 4a in which said shaft 6 rests, and snap-tangs 4b which<br>
maintain said shaft 6 in position and enable it to rotate.<br>
Said compartment 5 is of cross shape, with said seats being provided at<br>
the ends of one of the arms of the cross. In this manner the wheel shaft<br>
lies in the seats, with that wheel part which is to make contact with the<br>
ground being housed in the wider arm of the cross.<br>
The use of the invention is apparent from that described and illustrated.<br>
Specifically, if a static support is required, the foot 1 is used as it is, such<br>
that the surface 3a rests on the ground, whereas if a movable support is<br>
required, the wheel 7 is inserted into the appropriate seats, so that by<br>
projecting from the surface 3a it allows the appliance to be easily moved.<br>
To return to a static support condition the wheel 7 has merely to be<br>
extracted from the static support part.<br>
Such a foot can be mounted on any type of household electrical<br>
appliance, whether of low or high cost.<br>
Inserting the wheel 7 into the appropriate seats is sufficient to transform<br>
the foot from a static support means to a movable support m eans.<br>
This provides considerable advantages in terms of mounting speed and<br>
reduces the number of pieces required for mounting which htave to be<br>
kept in store, with all the consequent advantages.<br>
Modifications and variants are possible in addition to those already<br>
stated, hence for example the foot can be formed integral wi~th the base<br>
part or base frame.<br>
All the components of the invention can be of any material, however a<br>
polymeric material such as ABS is preferred.<br></td>
