In order to explain the supporting structure for the headlight unit 30, Fig. 2 shows a state in which the front cover 9 is partially removed. A headlight stay 31 extending toward the front of the vehicle and made from a steel plate or the like is welded onto the outer peripheral surface on the vehicle front side of the head pipe 3 formed in a substantially cylindrical configuration. The headlight unit 30 is constructed so that an engaging portion (see Fig. 6) provided on the back surface side thereof is brought into engagement with the front end of the headlight stay 31.[0025]<br>
Fir. 3 is a perspective view of the front cover 9.<br>
Reference numerals that are the same as those described above denote portions that are the same as or equivalent re those described above. An engaging portion 9a for engagement with the center cover 8, a mounting portion 9b for the winker unit 70, and an engaging portion 9c for engagement with the front lower cover 13 are formed in the front cover 9 that is formed integrally from resin or the like. Further, two openings 29 through which the lens surfaces of the headlight unit 30 are exposed are provided in the surface on the front of the vehicle. It should be noted that since the front cover 9 according to this embodiment has the two openings 29 of a large surface area, it also provides The effect of reducing the number of manufacturing steps due to the<br><br>
numerals that are the same as those described above denote portions that are the same as or equivalent to those described above. The headlight unit 30 is a left-right two-lamp headlight formed by placing two bulbs 33 in a single case 32 and covering the bulbs 33 respectively with symmetrical left and right lens 34. Upon mounting the headlight unit 30 onto the front cover 9, only the portions of the lens 34 are exposed through the openings 29 (see Fig, 3) of the front cover 9. Further, a mount 35 having an engaging shaft (see Fig. 6) for engagement, with the headlight stay 31 (see Fig. 2) is formed on the back surface side of the case 32. Further, a substantially cylindrical support shaft 36 that has been subjected to lightening, and a substantially disc provided to each of the left and right side surfaces of the case 32.  In addition, an optical-axis adjustment stay 3 8 accommodating an optical adjustment mechanism of a screw type or the like is provided on each of the left and right of the lower surface portion of the case 32.  It should be noted that wirings (see Fig. 6) for supplying electric power to the bulbs 33 are bundled together at predetermined locations by means of wiring guides 39, 40, 41 installed on the upper surface of the case 32. [0027]<br><br><br>
at substantially the top of the reflector portion 42, and connectors 43 for supplying electric power from wirings 44 are connected to terminals provided at the rear end thereof.  It should be noted that the reason why the installation location of the flange 37 is displaced slightly to the rear side of the vehicle (to the right in the drawing) from the optical-axis adjustment stay 38 is to secure, with respect to the support shaft 36 as the rotary shaft for optical axis adjustment, the amount of offset required for rotating the headlight unit 30.<br>
[0028].<br>
Fig. 6 is a rear view of the headlight unit 30. Reference numerals that are the same as those described above denote portions that are the same as or equivalent  those described above. The wiring guide 41 installed on the upper surface of the case 32 serves to tie the wirings 44 coupled to the left and right connectors 43, and wirings 45 in which the wirings 44 are covered with a tube made of resin or the like, into a bundle at one location. On the other hand, the wiring guides 39, 4 0 serve to arrange wirings 46, which are used for supplying electric power to the left and right winker units and the like, at predetermined positions.  Installed on the mount 35 is an engaging shaft 47 with a substantially U-shaped cross section for engagement with the headlight stay 31 (see Fig. 2}. The engaging shaft 47 is located on the line 0-0 corresponding to a horizontal optical-axis adjustment axis connecting between the right and<br><br>
to the central portion of the headlight unit 30, it is needless to mention that the engaging shaft 47 may be arranged at the central portion or slightly to the right on the line 0-0 in accordance with changes in the routing of wiring or in the configuration of the headlight stay. [0029]<br>
Fig. 7 is a top view of the headlight unit 30. Reference numerals that are the same as those described above denote portions that are the same as or equivalent to those described above.  Fig. 7 also shows auxiliaries that are arranged on the back surface side of the headlight unit 30 upon mounting the headlight unit 30 onto the motorcycle 1. A battery stay 50 for supporting a cattery 55 is coupled in direction upward of the vehicle (frontward direction in the drawing) to the headlight stay 31 welded onto the head pipe 3 (see Fig. 2) . Auxiliaries 53, 54 are arranged in both side surface portions of the battery 55. Further, a support stay 4 9 for fixedly holding an annular grommet 48 formed of resin or the like is provided at the distal end of the headlight stay 31. The engaging shaft 47 provided on the back surface side of the case 32 is inserted into an engagement hole formed at the center of the grommet 48, thereby supporting the headlight unit 30 on the back surface side.  Further, the engaging portion between the engaging shaft 47 and the grommet 43 is located on the line C-C connecting between the support shafts 36 and flanges 37 placed in the left and right side surfaces of the<br><br>
shaft stay 56 is a separate component that is fixed onto a cylinder portion 61 with a screw or the like after being positioned onto the front cover 9 by means of a dowel 62 (see Fig. 10), thereby slidably holding the outer peripheral surface of the support shaft 36 on the vehicle rear side. The support shaft stay 56 is arranged at the position illustrated in the drawing for the first time when fixing and supporting the headlight unit 30 onto the front cover 9. [0030]<br>
Due to the above-described construction, in the headlight supporting structure according to this embodiment, when the engaging shaft 47 is engaged with the headlight stay 31 welded<br>
are engaged with the front cover 9, the headlight unit 30 is fixed and supported onto the motorcycle 1 at a total of three engaging portions located on the line O-O.  It should be noted that the flange 37 of the support shaft 36 functions as a guide for engagement with the support shaft stay 56 and with the mounting portion on the front cover 9 side as described later.  In addition to facilitating the assembly, the flange 37 serves to prevent backlash or the like of the headlight unit 30 in the vehicle width direction. [0031]<br>
Fig. 6 is a perspective view showing a state where the headlight unit 30 is engaged with the headlight stay 31.<br><br><br>
have been removed from the bulbs 33, and a guide rib 42a is<br>
formed at the top of the reflector portion 42.<br>
[0032]<br>
As described above, the headlight unit 30 is supported at the distal end of the headlight stay 31 by means of the engaging shaft 47 provided on the back surface side of the case 32. Since the thick-walled portion of the grommet 48 formed of resin or the like having elasticity is interposed between the engaging shaft 47 and the headlight stay 31, the headlight unit 30 can be rocked with respect to the headlight stay 31 for the amount of elastic deformation the grommet 4 8 is allowed to undergo. Further, since the engaging portion between the engaging shaft 47 and the grommet 46 is arranged on the line O-O connecting between the support shafts 36 provided on both side surfaces of the case 32, even when the support shafts 36 are rotatably pivoted on the front cover 9, the rotary motion about the line 0-0 taken as the rotation axis is not hindered.<br>
[0033]<br>
With the headlight supporting structure according to this embodiment, the optical axis adjustment for the headlight is effected through vertical motion of the headlight unit 30 about the line 0-0 as the rotation axis. Further, since the headlight stay 31 can serve to bear the weight of the headlight unit 30, it becomes unnecessary to enhance the rigidity of the front cover 9 in order to mount the headlight unit 30. Further, since the<br><br><br>
where the headlight unit 30 is supported on the front cover 9 formed of resin or the like. Further, as compared with the arrangement of the related art in which the optical-axis adjustment axis is provided in the upper surface portion of the headlight unit, and the headlight unit is rocked by means of an adjustment mechanism provided in the lower surface portion thereof, the distance from the line 0-0 serving as the optical-axis adjustment axis to the upper and lower ends of the headlight unit 30 decreases, whereby setting to a predetermined adjusted position can be effected by means of a small adjustment.<br>
Further, the auxiliaries 53, 54 are supported onto both<br>
coupled to the battery stay 50, respectively. According to this construction, the headlight stay 31 can also serve to bear the weights of the battery stay 50, battery 55, sub-stays 51, 52, and auxiliaries 53, 54, thereby obviating the need to provide a stay or the like for supporting the auxiliaries onto the front cover 9 or the like. Furthermore, by arranging the auxiliaries in a concentrated manner in the vicinity of the headlight, concentration of mass or enhanced maintainability can be achieved. [0035]<br>
Fig. 9 is partial front view of the front cover 9. Reference numerals that are the same as those described above denote portions that are the same as or equivalent to those<br><br>
support shaft 36 and flange 37 of the headlight unit 30 is rotatably pivoted with respect to the front cover 9 at a mounting portion 75 arranged above an opening 59 in which the winker unit 70 (see Fig. 1) is fitted.  Further, a recess 57 that is brought into fitting engagement with the optical-axis adjustment stay 38 is provided at the bottom of the openings 29 through which the lens 34 is exposed. When the position of the lower end of the headlight unit 30 is adjusted vertically in the recess 57, the headlight unit 30 is rocked vertically about the line O-O, thereby effecting optical axis adjustment. This optical-axis adjustment mechanism can be operated by inserting a driver or the like from a hole provided in a lower portion of the recess 57<br>
[0036]<br>
Fig. 10 is a sectional view taken along the line A-A of Fig. 9. Reference numerals that are the same as those described above denote portions that are the same as or equivalent to those described above. The mounting portion 75 is composed of a fastening portion 58, which includes the cylindrical portion 61 having a screw hole for a mounting screw and the dowel 62 above the cylindrical portion 61, and a rib 60 having a sliding surface for rotatably journalling the support shaft 36. The support shaft 36 is rotatably journalled to the front cover 9 while being sandwiched between the rib 60 and the support shaft stay 56 (see Fig. 7).<br><br>
denote portions that are the same as or equivalent to those described above. The cylinder portion 61 and the dowel 62 are each brought into fitting engagement with a mounting hole (not shown) provided in the support shaft stay 56 (see Fig. 7)„ Due to the provision of the dowel 62, displacement of the mounting position and mounting angle of the support shaft stay 56 is prevented, and a cylindrical sliding surface allowing smooth rotation of the support shaft 36 is formed between it and the rib 60.<br>
Fig. 12 is a side view of the front cover 9. Reference numerals  that are the same as those described above denote<br>
portions that are the same as or equivalentt to hose described<br>
above.  Fig. 12 also shows the position of the support shaft 36 upon mounting the headlight unit 30 onto the motorcycle 1. The fastening portion 58 and the rib 60 which constitute the mounting portion 75 is received within a small substantially triangle space between the openings 29 of the headlight unit 30 and the opening 59 of the winker unit 70. [0039]<br>
Fig. 13 is a side view showing the relationship between the mounting positions of the support shaft 36, rib 60, and support shaft stay 56. As described above, the support shaft 36 is rotatably journalise so 35 to be sandwiched between the rib 50 and the support shaft stay 56. Accordingly, the optical axis<br><br>
support shaft 36 as a rotation axis. [0040]<br>
As described above, with the headlight supporting structure according to the present invention, the headlight unit is supported on the headlight stay, which is connected to the main frame, on the optical-axis adjustment axis thereof, whereby the headlight unit can be supported in a stable manner with its weight being borne by the headlight stay.  Further, since the support portion for bearing the weight of the headlight lies on the optical-axis adjustment axis, the moment in the rocking motion of the headlight for optical axis adjustment is reduced, thereby making it possible to perform optical axis adjustment in<br>
can be borne by the headlight stay, as compared with the case of mounting the headlight unit directly onto the front cover as an exterior part, there is no need to enhance the rigidity of the front cover, thereby making it possible to reduce the weight of the front cover. [0041]<br>
It should be understood as a matter of course that the configurations of the headlight unit, front cover, headlight stay, and the like, the configurations of the engaging shaft and grommet, the mounting methods thereof, and the like are not limited to those of the above-described embodiments cut may be modified in various ways.<br>
