THANE-400604.	<br><br>
NATIONALITY    :    INDIAN  NATIONAL     .<br>
The following Specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of<br>
this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:	<br><br><br><br><br><br>
1.0 Title : 'Automatic Bottom Discharge Chip Wringer for optimally recovering cutting oil by centrifugal separation from metal chips'<br>
2.0     Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for industrially viable chip wringer assembly and more particularly to recovery of cutting oil adhering on chips by way of adhesion and surface tension.<br>
3.0	Background of the Invention<br>
3.1	There is need in all industries to cut their cost down. This is an ongoing process. Therefore efforts are made in all spheres of activities to locate areas where it is possible to achieve this. One area where several companies have attempted to save cost is in consumption of cutting oil used as coolant in different machining process. These include gear hobbing, gun drilling, machining centers, broaching, tapping, keyway etc. It is observed that huge quantity of oil is carried away along with swarf generated in these processes. There is a practice to pile up this swarf &amp; allow the oil to drain by gravity. Substantial amount of oil still adheres to chips by way of surface tension. This oil has to be recovered forcibly. The force required is provided by rotating chips at high speed. The centrifugal force thus generated enables the oil to be recovered from chips.<br>
3.2	The typical arrangement of the oil recovery system is as shown in the accompanying drawing # 1 representing prior art of the present invention wherein such system comprise of a perforated sheet basket (items) mounted on bearings &amp; driven by an electric<br><br>
-3-motor (6), manual loading the oil laden chips in the basket &amp; starting the motor wherein the basket coupled therewith running at high speed subjecting chips &amp; oil to high centrifugal force. Due to increased centrifugal force the oil particles are thrown out through the perforations while chips remain secured inside the basket. The oil thrown is then collected in a circular ring around basket and finally led into a tank or bin. Operator switches off the basket, removes chips &amp; reloads it with next batch of chips. Such recovery system though principally seems working well seriously lacks in performance optimization. For removing chips after recovery of oil from the basket, the entire basket has to be first unscrewed from shaft, lifted completely out of the unit &amp; then turned upside down for emptying. Thus removing &amp; re-fixing the basket called for a lifting facility involving more labour consuming greater amount of time. There is an urgent necessity for automating the said arrangement.<br>
Additionally the mechanical wear and tear results from misbalancing the basket and while loading basket if sufficient care is not taken in. uniform distribution of chips. This causes imbalance during running, resulting into vibration and subsequent damage to bearings. Manual operations do not ensure optimized oil recovery.<br>
The US Patent no 4,377,259 describes equipment for recovering and preparing for reuse of scrap metal produced in machining operations. Basically this material consists of chips, borings and shavings produced by such machines as planers, automatic screw<br><br>
-4-machines, boring machines, lathes, milling machines and saws. This material is normally coated with the lubricant used in the machining process. The material frequently has a wide range of sizes and shapes. Some of the material is in the form of chips and small pieces requiring no size reduction. Significant quantities of the material consist of elongated spirals frequently resembling coiled springs. The latter machine turnings tend to become intermeshed producing a bulky, springy, snarled and entangling matrix which must be reduced to small chips to permit efficient extraction of the oil and also to reduce the bulk. The common method of reducing this type of material to small chips or pieces is to pass it through a hammer mill or a crusher which reduces these materials to a reasonably uniform small chip or short length. A number of crushers are available, employing a variety of reduction means. So far as is known, all of this equipment is designed for vertical feed, that is, the material to be crushed is fed from the top, passes down through the crusher and the processed material is discharged at the bottom. If the material, as received at the crusher, consisted entirely of chips, machine turnings, boring and the like, the problem of effectively crushing and reducing the metallic materials to a reasonably uniform, small size would be relatively simple. However, normally these materials, as received at the crusher, contain a substantial quantity of large pieces or chunks which are not the product of machining of various metal parts. It is these components of the material which cause substantial difficulty.<br>
	5<br><br>
-5-<br>
These include such items as ends of bar stock, bolts and steel parts from the machines on which the materials have been machined, broken and scrap parts. These materials are not suitable for processing in the crushers. When such materials enter the crusher, they become jammed in the teeth or between the rolls of the crusher, causing damage and, in some cases, stalling the crusher. When this happens, even if the crusher is not damaged it is necessary to stop the equipment and clean out the crusher to free it for further operation. This is an expensive and time consuming procedure and materially reduces economic efficiency of reclaiming the scrap from machining operations. Heretofore, there has been no successful means by which this problem could be eliminated despite the fact that it has plagued the machine turning recovery field for a number of years. Though this system accomplishes specific task it entails an expensive and time consuming method alongwith least optimized recovery of cutting oil. Also the chips need to be hammered and crushed limiting it to the prerequisite condition depending on input chips physical form.<br>
In a Japanese patent application no JP2003094283 concerns a machining method which makes stable machining possible by using water-insoluble oil agent, and in which measures for disaster prevention are sufficient. In the cutting method in which an aqueous solution is sprayed or jetted to a machining position at the time of machining using water-insoluble cutting oil, a recovered liquid is collected and stored in a recovery tank, the<br><br>
-6-water-insoluble cutting oil and the other solution are separated based on the specific gravity difference and respectively reused. Unfortunately in this system aqueous solution needs to be sprayed requiring use of additional process and additional chemicals increasing the volume of liquid to be handled by the system, ultimately reducing efficiency thereof.<br>
The US Patent application no 2002038586 concerns a cutting method in which a solution is sprayed or jetted to a machining portion by use of a water- insoluble cutting oil, wherein recovered liquid is collected and stored in one recovery tank, and separated into the water-insoluble cutting oil and another solution on the basis of the specific gravity difference, and are re-used. Stable machining is enabled by using the water-insoluble cutting oil, and measures against disaster are fully taken. The system does not ensure the removal of oil adhered to chips. 3.5 A Japanese patent no JP10034488 describes an apparatus to reuse the cutting oil which is attached to the cutting chips discharged from a cutting machine into a pit and restricts the generation of offensive odor caused by the decomposition of cutting oil. The cutting oil attached to cutting chips discharged from a plurality of cutting machines into their respective pits drips onto the bottom faces of the pits from the cutting chips, and the cutting oil on the bottom faces of the pits is forcibly energized downstream by the air blown from the air pipe at an upper position, and the oil film of the surface of the cutting oil is eliminated, resulting in the contact of air with the cutting oil.<br><br>
-7-In this method though the cutting oil from chips is removed, instead of recovering, it is evaporated in hot air wherein adjunctively necessitating hot air generator with blower means to that cause increasing cost of the system and loss of cutting oil thus evaporated.<br>
4.0	Object of the Invention<br>
4.1	The primary objective of the system is to optimize the recovery of cutting oil adhering on chips due to surface tension received from different machining processes.<br>
4.2	Another significant objective of the system is to ensure complete recovery of cutting oil irrespective of metal chip shape and size and to reduce the recovery time.<br>
4.3	Another significant objective of the invention is to reduce labour requirement.<br>
4.4	Another significant objective of the invention is eliminating vibration of the basket by removing cause of imbalance.<br>
4.5	Another significant objective of the invention is to have a discharge of chips directly to collection trolley.<br>
4.6	Another significant objective of invention is to collect cutting oil directly to storage bin.<br>
4.7	Another significant objective of invention is to eliminate hammering and crushing process for chips.<br><br>
5.0	Summary of Invention<br>
5.1	With reference to objects specified in the preceding section, the description herein explains the preferred embodiment of invention in substantial details.<br>
....8<br><br>
-8-5.2 The perforated sheet basket has a collapsible bottom made of upwardly closing - downwardly - opening flaps. The basket is driven by the motor mounted above. As the basket starts rotating, the bottom gets closed due to centrifugal force working on counter weights hinged on the other side of the bottom flaps. Since the counter weights are thrown out the flaps rise up &amp; the bottom gets closed. The oil laden chips are then poured into the basket through a hopper. Due to the rotation of the basket, centrifugal force acts on the chips and oil particles. Oil droplets are thrown out of the perforations. They are then collected in a bin. The chips remain inside the basket. The cycle runs for the duration which is preset on a timer in the control panel. This duration after experimentation is fixed at about two minutes. This ensures that oil recovery is almost 100%. On completion of these two minutes the motor stops. A mechanical or electrical brake is applied which stops the basket. As the basket stops, the centrifugal force on the counter weight is reduced. The reduced centrifugal force coupled with the weight of the chips inside the basket opens the flaps and dry chips fall into a trolley underneath. The cycle operates in two modes viz. Automatic &amp; Manual. In the automatic mode, the motor starts automatically after a pre set interval of time. The working continues likewise. In the manual mode, the unit has to be started by push button at the end of every cycle.<br>

The basket is fitted inside outer drum (1). The complete system is fitted on base frame (4). A person would load the oil laden chips in the basket and start the motor. The basket runs at high speed subjecting chips and oil to high centrifugal force. The oil thrown is then collected in a circular ring around basket and finally led into a tank or bin. The person operating the unit would then put it off, remove the chips &amp; reload it with next batch of chips. Accompanying drawings # 2 and 3 illustrate each a cross sectional view of the chip wringer of the present invention wherein the perforated sheet basket (2) has a collapsible bottom (9). The basket is driven by the motor mounted above. As the basket starts rotating, the bottom gets closed due to centrifugal force working on counter weights (8) hinged on the other side of the bottom flaps (9). Since the counter weights (8) are thrown out the flaps (9) rise up and the bottom gets closed. The oil laden chips are then poured into the basket through an intake hopper (10). Due to the rotation of the basket, centrifugal force acts on the chips and oil droplets. Oil droplets are thrown out of the perforations. They are then collected in a bin (7). The chips remain inside the basket. The cycle runs for the duration which is preset on a timer in the control panel. This duration after experimentation is fixed at about two minutes.
