The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to ion conductive random copolymers that are useful in forming polymer electrolyte membranes used in fuel cells.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fuel cells have been projected as promising power sources for portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and other applications due mainly to their non-polluting nature. Of various fuel cell systems, the polymer electrolyte membrane based fuel cell technology such as direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) has attracted much interest thanks to their high power density and high energy conversion efficiency. The "heart" of a polymer electrolyte membrane based fuel cell is the so called "membrane-electrode assembly" (MEA), which comprises a proton conducting polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM), catalyst disposed on the opposite surfaces of the PEM to form a catalyst coated member (CCM) and a pair of electrodes (i.e., an anode and a cathode) disposed to be in electrical contact with the catalyst layer.<br>
Proton-conducting membranes for DMFCs are known, such as Nation® from the E.I. Dupont De Nemours and Company or analogous products from Dow Chemicals. These perfluorinated hydrocarbon sulfonate ionomer products, however, have serious limitation when used in DMFCs. Nafion® loses conductivity when the operation temperature of the fuel cell is over 80°C. Moreover, Nafion® has a very high methanol crossover rate, which impedes its applications in DMFCs.<br><br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,773,480, assigned to Ballard Power System, describes a partially fluorinated proton conducting membrane from a, b, b -trifluorostyrene. One disadvantage of this membrane is its high cost of manufacturing due to the complex synthetic processes for monomer a, J3, P-trifluorostyrene and the poor sulfonation ability of poly (a, p, P-trifluorostyrene). Another disadvantage of this membrane is that it is very brittle, thus has to be incorporated into a supporting matrix.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,300,381 and 6,194,474 to Kerrres, et al. describe an acid-base binary polymer blend system for proton conducting membranes, wherein the sulfonated poly(ether sulfone) was made by post-sulfonation of the poly (ether sulfone).<br>
M. Ueda in the Journal of Polymer Science, 31(1993): 853, discloses the use of sulfonated monomers to prepare the sulfonated poly(ether sulfone polymers).<br>
U.S. Patent Application US 2002/0091225A1 to McGrath, et al. used this method to prepare sulfonated polysulfone polymers.<br>
The need for a good membrane for fuel cell operation requires balancing of various properties of the membrane. Such properties included proton conductivity, methanol-resistance, chemical stability and methanol crossover, fast start up of DMFCs, and durability to cell performance. In addition, it is important for the membrane to retain its dimensional stability over the fuel operational temperature range. In DMFCs methanol oxidation generates enough heat to raise the cell temperature. If the membrane swells significantly, it will increase methanol crossover. The membrane thus gradually loses its ability to block methanol crossover, resulting in degradation of cell performance. The dimension changes of the membrane also put a stress on the bonding of the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA). Often this results in delamination of the membrane from the electrode after excessive swelling of the membrane. Therefore, maintaining the dimensional stability over a wide temperature range and avoiding excessive membrane swelling are important for DMFC applications.<br>

Polymer membranes may be fabricated by solution casting of the ion conductive copolymer. Alternatively, the polymer membrane may be fabricated by solution casting the ion conducting polymer the blend of the acid and basic polymer.<br>
When cast into a membrane for use in a fuel cell, it is preferred that the membrane thickness be between 1 to 10 mils, more preferably between 2 and 6 mils, most preferably between 3 and 4 mils.<br>
As used herein, a membrane is permeable to protons if the proton flux is greater than approximately 0.0O5 S/cm, more preferably greater than 0.01 S/cm, most preferably greater than 0.02 S/cm.<br>
As used herein, a membrane is substantially impermeable to methanol if the methanol transport across a membrane having a given thickness is less than die transfer of methanol across a Nafion membrane of the same thickness. In preferred embodiments the<br>
15<br><br>
permeability of methanol is preferably 50% less than that of a Nafion membrane, more preferably 75% less and most preferably greater than 80% less as compared to the Nafion membrane.<br>
After the sulfonated random copolymer has been formed into a membrane (PEM), it may be used to produce a catalyst coated membrane (CCM). As used herein, a CCM comprises a PEM where at least one side and preferably both of the opposing sides of the PEM are partially or completely coated with catalyst layers. The catalyst is preferable a layer made of catalyst and ionomer. Preferred catalysts are Pt and Pt-Ru. Preferred ionomers include Nafion and other ion conductive polymers.<br>
In general, anode and cathode catalysts are applied onto the membrane by well established standard techniques. For direct methanol fuel cells, platinum/ruthenium catalyst is typically used on the anode side while platinum catalyst is applied on the cathode side and platinum is applied on the cathode side. Catalysts may be optionally supported on carbon. The catalyst is initially dispersed in a small amount of water (about l00 g of catalyst in 1 g of water). To this dispersion a 5% Nafion solution in water/alcohol is added (0.25-0.75 g). The resulting dispersion may be directly painted onto the polymer membrane. Alternatively, isopropanol (1-3 g) is added and the dispersion is directly sprayed onto the membrane.  The catalyst may also be applied onto the membrane by decal transfer, as described in the open literature (Electrochimica Acta, 40: 297 (1995)).<br>
The CCM is used to make MEA's. As used herein, an MEA refers to an ion conducting polymer membrane made from, a CCM according to the invention in combination with anode and cathode electrodes positioned to be in electrical contact with the catalyst layer of the CCM.<br>
The electrodes are in electrical contact with a membrane, either directly or indirectly, when they are capable of completing an electrical circuit which includes the polymer membrane and a load to which, a electric current is supplied. More particularly, a first catalyst is electrocatalytically associated with the anode side of the membrane so as to facilitate the oxidation of organic fuel. Such oxidation generally results in the formation<br>
16<br><br>
of protons, electrons, carbon dioxide and water. Since the membrane is substantially impermeable to organic fuels such as methanol, as well as carbon dioxide, such components remain on the anodic side of the membrane. Electrons formed from the electrocatalytic reaction are transmitted from the cathode to the load and then to the anode. Balancing this direct electron current is the transfer of an equivalent number of protons across the membrane to the anodic compartment. There an electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen in the presence of the transmitted protons occurs to form water. In one embodiment, air is the source of oxygen. In another embodiment, oxygen-enriched air is used.<br>
The membrane electrode assembly is generally used to divide a fuel cell into anodic and cathodic compartments. In such fuel cell systems, an organic fuel such as methanol is added to the anodic compartment while an oxidant such as oxygen or ambient air is allowed to enter the cathodic compartment. Depending upon the particular use of a fuel cell, a number of cells can be combined to achieve appropriate voltage and power output. Such applications include electrical power sources for residential, industrial, commercial power systems and for use in locomotive power such as in automobiles. Other uses to which the invention finds particular use includes the use of fuel cells in portable electronic devices such as cell phones and other telecommunication devices, video and audio consumer electronics equipment, computer laptops, computer notebooks, personal digital assistants and other computing devices, GPS devices and the like. In addition, the fuel cells may be stacked to increase voltage and current capacity for use in high power applications such as industrial and residential services or used to provide locomotion to vehicles. Such fuel cell structures include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,416,895, 6,413,664, 6,106,964,5,840,438, 5,773,160, 5,750,281,5,547,776, 5,527,363, 5,521,018, 5,514,487,5,482,680,5,432,021, 5,382,478,5,300,370,5,252,410 and 5,230,966.<br>
Such CCM and MEM's are generally useful in fuel cells such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,945,231, 5,773,162, 5,992,008, 5,723,229,6,057,051, 5,976,725, 5,789,093, 4,612,261,4,407,905,4,629,664,4,562,123,4,789,917,4,446,210,4,390,603,6,110,613, 6,020,083, 5,480,735,4,851,377,4,420,544, 5,759,712, 5,807,412, 5,670,266, 5,916,699, 5,693,434,5,688,613,5,688,614, each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to methods for the preparation of the ion conducting (e.g., sulfonate) random copolymers that are useful as polymer electrolyte membranes. In general, the methods to prepare the include combining a first monomer having at least one ion conducting group such as a sulfonate group with a second comonomer. The first monomer should have at least two leaving groups and the second comonomer should have at least two groups that can displace at least one leaving group of the first monomer. A third comonomer is included that has at least two leaving groups, such that at least one of the displacing groups of the second comonomer can displace at least one of the leaving groups of the third comonomer.<br>
In a particular embodiment for the preparation of such polymers, the process further includes the step of combining a fourth comonomer having at least two displacing groups that can react with the leaving groups of either the first comonomer or the third comonomer.<br>
The term "leaving group" is intended to include those functional moieties that can be displaced by a nucleophilic moiety found, typically, in another monomer. Leaving groups are well recognized in the art and include, for example, halides (chloride, fluoride, iodide, bromide), tosyl, mesyl, etc. In certain embodiments, the monomer has at least two leaving groups, which are "para" to each other with respect to the aromatic monomer to which they are attached.<br>
The term "displacing group" is intended to include those functional moieties that can act typically as nucleophiles, thereby displacing a leaving group from a suitable monomer. The result is that the monomer to which the displacing group is attached becomes attached, generally covalentlv, to the monomer to which the leaving group was associated with. An example of this is the displacement of fluoride groups from aromatic monomers by phenoxide or alkoxide ions associated with aromatic monomers.<br>
