BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a technology for<br>
control display on a screen by a plurality of processing units<br>
(tasks and applications), and more particularly to an<br>
allocation of the display area.<br>
The instant application has been divided out of the co-<br>
pending Indian patent application No. 495CAL9 9.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
When a plurality of applications display on one screen,<br>
a window system, such as X-Window System, has been used. In<br>
these window systems, each application displays acquiring the<br>
respective window (multi-window).<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application HEI4-274289<br>
discloses a device which groups windows acquired by each<br>
application, and displays or does not display in group units.<br>
Also in accordance with Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.<br>
1-100662, when contents displayed on a plurality of windows<br><br><br>
are inter-related, these plurality of windows are<br>
simultaneously displayed so that the user can easily<br>
understand the display contents.<br>
However, with the conventional display based on a<br>
multi-window, what application displays on what display area<br>
basically depends on the application. Therefore it is possible<br>
for an application to display a window which overlaps with the<br>
window displayed by another application. When such a problem<br>
occurs, the user must change the position of the window which<br>
is overlapped by another window in order to view the display<br>
of the window, which is troublesome.<br>
In satellite broadcasting TV, where users need not<br>
change the positions of windows, different applications must<br>
be used to prevent the overlapping display of windows. For<br>
such devices, a conventional window system cannot be used.<br>
In accordance with the Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
Application HEI4-274289, multiple windows specified by an<br>
application are grouped so as to improve the operability of<br>
each window, but the handling of overlapping of windows<br>
depends on the application. In other words, an undesired<br>
display of multi-windows is inevitable, and the above<br>
mentioned problems are not solved.<br>
In accordance with the Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
Application HEI1-100662, the handling of overlapping windows<br>
also depends on the application, where an undesired display of<br>
multi-windows is still inevitable, and the above mentioned<br><br><br>
problems are not solved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE IHVENTION<br>
With the foregoing in view, it is an object of the<br>
present invention to provide a device and a method which can<br>
display data in an appropriate display area for each<br>
processing unit, such as an application, according to the<br>
applied equipment.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a <br>
	method of controlling display on a display device in response to one or more<br>
processing units, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
receiving a request from one of the processing units for acquiring one of<br>
predefined display areas;<br>
determining whether or not to provide an authorization to acquire the one of the<br>
predefined display areas in response to the request; and<br>
wherein when a plurality of requests for acquiring the same one of the<br>
predefined display areas from a plurality of processing units are received in the receiving<br>
step, the authorization is provided to one and only one of the processing units that made<br>
one of the requests for acquiring the same one of the predefined display areas.<br>
According to the present invention, there is also provided a	.	<br>
	 display control device which controls display on a display device in<br>
response to one or more processing units, the device comprising:<br>
means for receiving a request from one of the processing units for acquiring one<br>
of predefined display areas;<br>
means for determining whether or not to provide an authorization to acquire the<br>
one of the predefined display areas in response to the request; the arrangement being<br>
such that in the event of a plurality of requests for acquiring the same one of the<br>
predefined display areas from a plurality of processing units being received by the<br><br>
receiving means, the authorization is caused to be provided to one and only one of the processing<br>
units that made one of the requests for acquiring the same one of the predefined display<br>
areas.<br><br><br>
(1) A display control device and method according to<br>
the present invention defines a plurality of display areas in<br>
the display device, and when a display area acquisition<br>
request is received from each processing unit, it is decided<br>
whether to use the requested display area, and the processing<br>
unit which is allowed to use the display area can display data<br>
there. By defining display areas in advance, and by allowing<br>
the use of each display area, without leaving control to each<br>
processing unit, an appropriate display for each processing<br>
unit according to the applied equipment becomes possible. Also<br>
inappropriate display is prevented.<br>
(2) When display area acquisition requests are<br>
received from a plurality of processing units, the display<br>
control device according to the present invention judges<br>
whether the display areas subject to respective acquisition<br>
requests can coexist, and if the plurality of processing units<br>
are requesting acquisition of display areas which cannot<br>
coexist, use is allowed to one of the processing units. As a<br><br><br>
consequence, a plurality of display processing which cannot<br>
coexist can be prevented and appropriate display becomes<br>
possible.<br>
(3)	When the display areas subject to respective<br>
acquisition requests all or partially overlap, the display<br>
control device according to the present invention judges as-<br>
coexistence impossible. As a consequence, it is possible to<br>
control such that displays by a plurality of processing units<br>
do not overlap.<br>
(4)	When a plurality of processing units request<br>
acquisition of one display area, the display control device<br>
according to the present invention judges as coexistence<br>
impossible. As a consequence, it is possible to control such<br>
that two or more processing units are not allowed to use one<br>
display area.<br>
(5)	When a plurality of display areas subject to<br>
respective acquisition requests partially overlap, the display<br>
control device according to the present invention judges as<br>
coexistence possible. As a consequence, it is possible to<br>
control such that a partial overlapping display is allowed.<br>
(6)	When a display processing is executed for a<br>
plurality of display areas which can coexist with partial<br>
overlapping portions, the display control device in accordance<br>
with the present invention displays assigning priority to an<br>
area having a higher priority in the overlapped portion. As a<br>
consequence,  it  is  possible  to  control  such  that  the<br><br><br>
overlapped portion is displayed according to priority.<br>
(7)	The display control device in accordance with the<br>
present invention judges the possibility of coexistence based<br>
on the coexistence relationship information where the<br>
possibility of coexistence of a plurality of display areas has<br>
been defined in advance. As a consequence, it is possible to<br>
quickly judge whether the requested display areas can coexist.<br>
(8)	When an acquisition request for a display area<br>
which cannot coexist is received, the display control device<br>
in accordance with the present invention allows use to the<br>
processing unit which sent the request first. As a consequence,<br>
it is possible to assign priority to the display by the<br>
processing unit which sent the display request first.<br>
(9)	When an acquisition request for a display area<br>
which cannot coexist is received, the display control device<br>
in accordance with the present invention allows use to the<br>
processing unit which has the higher priority. As a<br>
consequence, it is possible to display data which is most<br>
urgent, such as a warning display.<br><br>
(10)	When an acquisition request for a display area<br>
which cannot coexist is received, the display control device<br>
in accordance with the present invention allows use to the<br>
processing unit which requests the area having the highest<br>
priority. As a consequence, areas in a display can be<br>
different depending on the urgency.<br>
(11)	- (14) The display control device according to<br>
'5<br><br>
the present invention stores a processing unit which requested<br>
acquisition but was not allowed use of the display area as an<br>
acquisition waiting, and allows use of the display area when<br>
allowance is possible. As a consequence, use is allowed<br>
sequentially for display area acquisition requests. Each<br>
processing unit does not have to request acquisition again. If<br>
use is allowed considering the order of received requests,<br>
priority given to the processing units, and priority given to<br>
the display areas, then use can be allowed according to<br>
sequence in the order considering such priorities.<br>
(15)	When a request for a display area which cannot<br>
coexist is received, the display control device according to<br>
the present invention changes the display area requested by<br>
one or more processing units so as to allow use as a plurality<br>
of display areas which can coexist. As a consequence, a<br>
plurality of displays can coexist as much as possible while<br>
maintaining an appropriate display by a plurality of display<br>
areas.<br>
(16)	When a request for a display area which cannot<br>
coexist is received, the display control device according to<br>
the present invention changes the display area based on<br>
dependency relationship information defining the changes of<br>
the display area to make coexistence possible. As a<br>
consequence, the display area can be quickly changed so as to<br>
make coexistence possible.<br>
(17)	(21) The display control device according to the<br><br><br>
present invention defines the processing units which are<br>
allowed use for each display area as acquisition right<br>
information, and when a display area acquisition request is<br>
received from each processing unit, the display control device<br>
refers to the acquisition right information and decides<br>
whether use of the display area is allowed for each processing<br>
unit. As a consequence, it is possible to control by<br>
allocating processing units for each display area.<br>
(18)	The display control device according to the<br>
present invention does not allow two or more processing units<br>
simultaneous use of one display area. As a consequence, it is<br>
possible to control so as to correlate a display area and a<br>
processing unit on a one-to-one basis.<br>
(19)	(20) The display control device according to the<br>
present invention allows two or more processing units<br>
simultaneous use of one display area. As a consequence, it is<br>
possible to control so as to allow two or more processing<br>
units to use one display area.<br>
(22) (23) When the processing unit which requested the<br>
display area is actually not in a state to display on the<br>
display area, or is not in a state to execute processing<br>
related to the display processing, the display control device<br>
according to the present invention does not allow the<br>
processing unit to use the display area even if the display<br>
area requested by the processing unit can coexist with display<br>
areas requested by other processing units. As a consequence,<br><br><br>
to make display efficient, use is not allowed for a processing<br>
unit which cannot actually execute display processing and<br>
processing related to display.<br>
(24)	The display control device according to the<br>
present invention also has display processing supervisory<br>
means, wherein when each processing unit executes display<br>
processing for each display area, it is supervised whether the<br>
display processing is by a processing unit which is allowed<br>
use of the display area. As a consequence, execution of<br>
invalid display processing can be supervised.<br>
(25)	(26) The display control device according to the<br>
present invention assigns a key to the processing unit when<br>
use of a display area is allowed, and the display processing<br>
supervisory means supervises by judging whether the key shown<br>
by the processing unit is the correct key. As a consequence,<br>
invalid display processing can be easily supervised. By<br>
assigning a different key each time, invalid display<br>
processing using an old key can be prevented.<br>
(27) When a processing unit attempted to execute<br>
display processing for a display area which is not allowed use<br>
is discovered, the display control device according to the<br>
present invention executes processing to disable the display<br>
processing by the processing unit. As a consequence, a<br>
processing unit which attempted invalid display processing can<br>
be removed.<br>
In the present invention, "processing unit" refers to<br><br><br>
a set of processings to obtain a certain result. One<br>
processing unit may be comprised of one task, but may include<br>
two or more tasks.<br>
The concept "case when all the display areas subject<br>
to the acquisition requests overlap" includes the case when<br>
two or more acquisition requests are received for the same<br>
display area.<br>
"Cannot coexist" is the case when displaying in a ..<br>
plurality of display areas is not desirable. Depending on the<br>
equipment to which the display control device is applied to or<br>
depending on the status, a plurality of display areas may not<br>
be able to coexist if a part of the display area overlaps, or<br>
may be able to coexist even if overlapping exists in a<br>
predetermined allowable range. There is also a case when a<br>
specific display area can coexist even if it overlaps with<br>
another display area.<br>
The concept "resource used by a processing unit"<br>
includes not only hardware but also software, such as data and<br>
programs.<br>
The concept "display area storage means" refers to a<br>
means for storing the definitions of display areas, and<br>
includes means for substantially defining display areas,<br>
regardless table format or descriptions in a program. In the<br>
embodiments, the display area definition table in Fig. 6 falls<br>
under this concept.<br>
The concept "display area management means" refers to<br><br><br>
a means for deciding whether use of the area is allowed at<br>
least when a display area acquisition request is received. In<br>
the embodiments, the display control program shown in e.g. Fig.<br>
8 falls under this concept.<br>
The concept "computer" refers to a device which<br>
executes processing according to a program, and includes a<br>
personal computer, and a CPU and MPU built-in to such<br>
equipment as a TV.<br>
"Recording medium where a program is recorded" is such<br>
a recording medium as ROM, RAM, a flexible disk, CD-ROM,<br>
memory card and hard disk, where a program is recorded. This<br>
concept includes not only such a recording medium as a hard<br>
disk which is connected to a CPU and with which the recorded<br>
program is directly executed, but also such a recording medium<br>
as CD-ROM which records a program to be executed after<br>
installing it on a hard disk. A program here includes not only<br>
a program which can be directly executed, but also a source<br>
format program, compressed program and enciphered program.<br>
Features, other objectives, applications and effects<br>
of the present invention will be clarified by referring to the<br>
embodiments and drawings.<br>
The present invention provides for a method for<br>
controlling display on a display device in response to one<br>
or more processing units, the method being characterized by<br>

determining whether or not to provide an authorization<br>
to acquire one of a plurality of predefined display areas in<br>
response to an acquisition request from one of the<br>
processing units for acquiring the one of the predefined<br>
display areas,-<br>
wherein when a plurality of requests for acquiring the<br>
same one of the predefined display areas from a plurality of<br>
processing units are received, the authorization is provided<br>
to one and only one of the processing units.<br>
The present invention also provides for a device for<br>
controlling display on a display device in response to one<br>
or more processing units, the device characterized by<br>

1. Display control device in accordance with the basic concept<br>
of the invention<br>
Fig. 1 shows a general configuration of the display<br>
control device 2 as an embodiment of the basic concept of the<br>
present invention. The display control device 2 comprises<br>
display area management means 4 and display area storage means<br>
6. The display area storage means 6 stores definitions of a<br>
plurality of display areas which are set on a screen of the<br>
display device 8. To the display area management means 4, a<br>
display area acquisition request for displaying is sent from a<br>
plurality of processing units R1 - Rn. The display area<br>
management means 4 decides whether use of the display area is<br>
allowed for each processing unit, considering the relationship<br>
of the plurality of display areas requested from each<br>
processing unit R1 - Rn. Each processing unit R1 - Rn executes<br>
display processing for the display areas for which use is<br>
allowed.<br>
In this way, after each processing unit R1 - Rn sends<br>
a display area acquisition request, the display area<br>
management means 4 notifies each processing unit R1 - Rn<br>
whether use is allowed. As a consequence, display on a<br>
plurality of areas by each processing unit R1 - Rn can be<br>
appropriately controlled.<br><br><br><br>
2. First embodiment<br>
2.1	General configuration<br>
Fig. 2 shows a general configuration of a display<br>
control device 2 as an embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
this embodiment, acquisition status storage means 10 connected<br>
to the display area management means 4 is disposed. The<br>
acquisition status storage means 10 stores the acquisition<br>
status correlating a display area and tasks Tl - Tn which are<br>
processing units which acquired the display area. When a<br>
display area acquisition request is received from one of the<br>
tasks Tl - Tn, the .display area management means 4 judges<br>
whether the display area has been acquired by another task<br>
based on the storage content of the acquisition status storage<br>
means 10. If the display area has been acquired by another<br>
task, the task is not allowed to use the display area. If the<br>
display area has not been acquired by another task, the task<br>
is allowed to use the display area.<br>
2.2	Example of application to digital broadcasting receiver<br>
Fig. 3 shows a hardware configuration when the display<br>
control device shown in Fig. 2 is applied to a digital<br>
broadcasting receiver. In this example, each function shown in<br>
Fig. 2 is implemented by CPU 12.<br>
In satellite digital broadcasting and ground wave<br>
digital broadcasting, a plurality of services are multiplexed<br>
and sent as a transport stream. The radio wave captured by an<br><br><br>
antenna 38 is sent to a tuner 30. The tuner 30 selects and<br>
demodulates the transport stream carrying the desired service<br>
according to the control of the CPU 12. The demodulated<br>
transport stream is sent to a transport decoder (TS decoder)<br>
32. The transport decoder 32 selects the desired service from<br>
the transport stream according to the control of the CPU 12,<br>
and outputs it to an. audio video decoder (AV decoder) 34. The<br>
AV decoder receives the data, decompresses the compressed data,<br>
carries out D/A conversion, and outputs video composite<br>
signals (e.g. NTSC signals).<br>
Fig. 4 shows details of the AV decoder 34. The<br>
decompression circuit 41 decompresses the output from the TS<br>
decoder 32 and sends it to a video RAM 42. In data<br>
broadcasting, display content is controlled by overwriting the<br>
V-RAM 42 from the CPU 12. A composite signal generation<br>
circuit 44 converts the content of the V-RAM 42 from digital<br>
to analog so as to convert to video composite signals.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, A TV set 36, which is a display<br>
device, receives the video composite signals and outputs<br>
images and sound. A modem 17, which is a communication control<br>
circuit, is used for communication with the outside via<br>
telephone lines.<br>
The CPU 12 controls the above mentioned receive<br>
processing according to a station selection application<br>
(program) recorded in a ROM 16. The CPU 12 judges which<br>
service is to be received based on the input by the user.<br><br><br>
which is input from an operation input section 40. The<br>
operation input section 40 may be a receiving part of a remote<br>
controller (not illustrated) or operation buttons disposed on<br>
the receiver main body.<br>
In the ROM 16, such tasks as a caption application, a<br>
program schedule application, a program reservation<br>
application, a data receiving application, and a system<br>
setting application have been recorded, in addition to the<br>
station selection application. Also in the ROM 16, a display<br>
control program and a display area definition table have been<br>
recorded. A work memory 14 functions as a work area of the CPU<br>
12.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a display area definition example on the<br>
screen of the TV set 36. In this embodiment, each display area E1 - E3 is defined so as not to overlap with each other. In<br>
the ROM 16, a display area definition table (display area<br>
storage means) for indicating the definitions of each display<br>
area E1 - E3 has been recorded, as Fig, 6 shows. In this<br>
embodiment, the coordinates are indicated by display dots,<br>
where the upper left corner of the screen is (0, 0), the<br>
lateral direction is X and the longitudinal direction is Y.<br>
The lower right corner is (679, 339).<br>
The work memory 14 has an acquisition status storage<br>
table for recording acquisition status correlating each area<br>
E1 - E3 and tasks which acquired each area, as Fig. 7A shows.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a flow chart of an acquisition request<br><br><br>
processing portion (display area management means) of the<br>
display control program recorded in the ROM 16. Now, with<br>
reference to this flow chart, the case when a data receiving<br>
application (task Tl) executes display processing for the<br>
display area E2, will be described. The data receiving<br>
application is an application for receiving data broadcasting<br>
(e.g. weather forecasting data) and executing display based on<br>
this data. ..At first the data receiving application sends a<br>
request to acquire the display area E2 to the CPU 12. The CPU<br>
12 receives this request and starts the display control<br>
program shown in Fig. 8 (Step S201).<br>
Then the CPU 12 reads the display task storage table<br>
in the work memory 14, and acquires a use status of the<br>
requested display area E2 (Step S202). Based on the obtained<br>
status, the CPU 12 judges whether the requested display area<br>
E2 has been acquired by another application (task) (Step S203).<br>
Here, the display area E2 has not been acquired by any other<br>
task, as Fig. 7A shows. Therefore the processing advances to<br>
Step S204.<br>
In Step S204, the data receiving application (task Tl)<br>
is stored correlating to .the display area E2 of the display<br>
task storage table. Pig. 7B shows the display task storage<br>
table after storing the task Tl.<br>
Then the CPU 12 notifies the data receiving<br>
application (task Tl) to allow use of the requested display<br>
area E2. In this way, the data receiving application (task 1)<br><br><br>
acquires a display right for the display area E2. The data<br>
receiving application which acquired the display area E2<br>
executes display processing for the area. In other words,<br>
according to the data receiving application, the CPU 12<br>
overwrites the V-RAM 42 based on the received content of the<br>
data broadcasting, and displays data broadcasting, as shown in<br>
Fig. 9.<br>
A case when a program schedule application (task T3)<br>
requests acquisition of the display area E2 again in the above<br>
status will be explained. The program schedule application is<br>
an application to receive and display an electronic program<br>
schedule (EPG). In this case as well, the display control<br>
program shown in Fig. 8 is started by the acquisition request<br>
from the program schedule application (task T3) (Step S201).<br>
The CPU 12 recognizes that the requested display area E2 has<br>
already been acquired by the data receiving application (task<br>
1) based on the acquisition status storage table (see Fig. 7B).<br>
Therefore the processing advances from Step S203 to S207. In<br>
this embodiment, two tasks are not allowed to use the same<br>
display area, so the CPU 12 notifies the program schedule<br>
application (task T3) that the display area E2 cannot be<br>
acquired (Step S207). The program schedule application (task<br>
m<br>
T3) receives this message, and selects whether to wait until<br>
the display area E2 is released or to request acquisition of<br>
another display area, or to give up display at this time.<br>
Fig. 10 shows an example of the screen display when<br><br><br>
the program schedule application requests to acquire a display<br>
area E3 and a program reservation application requests to<br>
acquire a display area E1 in the above status. According to<br>
this embodiment, each application is allowed use of a display<br>
area such that disorder is not caused by e.g. overlapping of a<br>
display by each application, therefore display by a plurality<br>
of applications can be appropriately executed, as shown in Fig,<br>
10.<br>
When the above data receiving application (task Tl)<br>
which acquired the display area E2 ends the display processing<br>
on the display area, the data receiving application (task Tl)<br>
requests release of the display area E2 to the CPU 12. Fig. 11<br>
shows a flow chart of a processing program (release request<br>
processing) in this case. The CPU 12 receives the release<br>
request and starts processing shown in Fig. 11 (Step S301). At<br>
first, the CPU 12 obtains the working status of the display<br>
area E2, for which release was requested, from the acquisition<br>
status storage table (Step S302). Since the content of the<br>
acquisition status storage table at this point is as shown in<br>
Fig. 7B, the CPU 12 recognizes that the display area E2 has<br>
been acquired by the data receiving application (task Tl).<br>
Then the CPU 12 judges whether the task which<br>
requested the release has actually acquired the display area.<br>
This judgment is made based on whether the task which<br>
requested the release of the display area matches the task<br>
which has acquired the display area (step S303). This judgment<br><br><br>
is made to prevent a task which has not acquired the display<br>
area from requesting an incorrect release. When the tasks do<br>
not match in Step S303, the display area is not released, and<br>
failure of the release is notified to the task which requested<br>
the release (Step S307).<br>
Since the data receiving application (task Tl) which<br>
requested release of the display area E2 has actually acquired<br>
the display area E2 here, processing advances to Step S304. In<br>
Step S304, the task Tl which was stored correlating to the<br>
display area E2 in the acquisition status storage table is<br>
deleted. As a result, the content of the acquisition status<br>
storage table becomes the status shown in Fig. 7A. Therefore<br>
if a new acquisition request for the display area E2 is<br>
received, use can be allowed.<br>
After deleting the task from the acquisition status<br>
storage table, the CPU 12 notifies the data receiving<br>
application (task Tl) that the area is released (Step S305).<br>
In the above embodiment, when display area acquisition<br>
requests are received from a plurality of applications (tasks),<br>
it is judged whether the display areas subject to the<br>
acquisition request are the same areas, and if they are, then<br>
the task which requested the acquisition first is allowed use<br>
of the display area. In other words, if a plurality of tasks<br>
request acquisition for the same display area, it is judged<br>
that coexistence is impossible, and if the tasks request<br>
acquisition for different areas, then it is judged that<br><br><br>
coexistence Is possible.<br>
3. Second embodiment<br>
3.1 General configuration<br>
Fig. 13 shows a general configuration of a display<br>
control device 2 according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In this embodiment, coexistence<br>
relationship storage means 20 is disposed. The coexistence<br>
relationship storage means 20 stores the coexistence<br>
relationship information to indicate whether a plurality of<br>
display areas can coexist. The display area management means 4<br>
judges whether the display areas desired by the acquisition<br>
requests from each processing unit R1 - Rn can coexist, based<br>
on the coexistence relationship information of the coexistence<br>
relationship storage means 20. If coexistence is impossible,<br>
the processing unit which requested acquisition first is<br>
allowed use of the display area.<br>
A display processing supervisory means 22 judges<br>
whether each display processing by each processing unit R1 - Rn Is for a display area where use of each display processing<br>
is allowed. If the display processing is for a display area<br>
where use is not allowed, the display processing is not<br>
accepted.<br>
In the first embodiment, one task corresponds to one<br>
processing unit. In the second embodiment, however, the case<br>
where one processing unit R1 includes a plurality of tasks T11<br><br><br>
- Tim will be explained. For example, a program schedule<br>
application as a processing unit includes three tasks, that is,<br>
1) task 1, which sends operation input from an operation input<br>
section 40 to task 2 or task 3 depending on the situation, 2)<br>
task 2 which displays the program schedule on screen, and 3),<br>
task 3 which displays the details of the program on screen.<br>
A display area acquisition request is sent from each<br>
processing unit R1 - Rn, and use is allowed for each<br>
processing unit R1 - Rn. An acquisition request may be sent<br>
from each processing unit R1 - Rn independently, or be sent<br>
from a specific task of each processing unit R1 - Rn as a<br>
representative of the processing unit. The latter case will be<br>
explained below.<br>
3.2 Embodiment applied to a digital broadcasting receiver<br>
The case when the display control device 2 in Fig. 13<br>
is applied to a digital broadcasting receiver will be<br>
explained. The hardware configuration is the same as in Fig. 3.<br>
In the ROM 16, however, coexistence relationship information<br>
is also recorded, in addition to definitions of the display<br>
areas and the display control program.<br>
Fig. 14 shows the definitions of the display areas in<br>
this embodiment. In this embodiment, the display area E1 for<br>
the entire screen, the display area E2 for the left half, the<br>
display area E3 for the right half, the display area E4 for<br>
the upper half, and the display area E5 for the lower half are<br><br><br>
defined. This definition content is stored in the ROM 16 as a<br>
display area definition table, as shown in Fig. 15. Also, as<br>
Fig. 16 shows, the work memory 14 stores the acquisition<br>
status storage table which indicates the correspondence<br>
between a display area and the processing unit which acquires<br>
this area. In this embodiment, a key number is assigned to a<br>
processing unit which is allowed to display, as mentioned<br>
later. This key number is also stored in the acquisition<br>
status storage table.<br>
Fig. 17 shows the coexistence relationship table<br>
stored in the ROM 16. In this embodiment, areas cannot coexist<br>
if they overlap. In Fig. 17, display areas which cannot<br>
coexist are recorded for each display area, but display areas<br>
which can coexist may be recorded.<br>
Fig. 18 shows a flow chart of the acquisition request<br>
processing portion of the display control program recorded in<br>
the ROM 16. Processing when the processing unit R2 requests<br>
acquisition of the display area E3 while the display area E2<br>
has been acquired by the processing unit Rl, as shown in Fig.<br>
16B will be explained. In this explanation, the processing<br>
unit Rl is assumed to be the program schedule application and<br>
the processing unit R2 to be the data receiving application.<br>
In this case, the program schedule application, which is the<br>
processing unit Rl, is currently executing display in the<br>
display area E2. as shown in Fig. 19.<br>
When the acquisition request is received from the task<br><br><br>
T21 (for example, a task for displaying the content of data<br>
broadcasting on screen), which represents the data receiving<br>
application (processing unit R2), the CPU 12 starts the<br>
processing shown in Fig. 18 (Step S401). Then the CPU 12<br>
refers to the acquisition status storage table, and obtains<br>
data on which processing unit has acquired each display area<br>
(Step S402). In this case, the display area E2 has been<br>
acquired by the program schedule application (processing unit<br>
R1) and the other display areas are open.<br>
Then referring to the coexistence relationship table<br>
in Fig. 17, the CPU 12 obtains data on areas which cannot<br>
coexist with the display area E3 requested by the data<br>
receiving application (processing unit R2) (Step S403). in<br>
this case, the display areas E1, E4 and E5 are the areas which<br>
cannot coexist.<br>
Then the CPU 12 judges whether the display area E3 for<br>
which acquisition is requested has been acquired by another<br>
processing unit. Also the CPU 12 judges whether one of the<br>
display areas E1, E4 and E5, which cannot coexist with the<br>
requested display area E3, has been acquired by another<br>
processing unit. If one of these areas E3, E1, E4 and E5 has<br>
been acquired by another processing unit, the CPU 12 returns<br>
an acquisition failure .notice to the task which sent the<br>
request (Step S408).<br>
In this case, all the display areas E3, E1, E4 and E5<br>
are open, so processing advances to Step S405. In Step S405,<br><br><br>
the processing unit R2 and the key number, corresponding to<br>
the display area E3, are stored in the acquisition status<br>
storage table (see Fig. 16C). The CPU 12 sends the key number<br>
to the task T21 representing the data receiving application<br>
(processing unit R2) to notify that use of the display area is<br>
allowed (Step S406). The task T21 receives the key number and<br>
notifies that the use of the display area E3 is allowed along<br>
with the key number to the other tasks T22 - T2n (for example,<br>
a task for displaying the main menu, and a task fox- displaying<br>
the sub-menu) belonging to the data receiving application<br>
(processing unit R2). In this way, use of the display area E3<br>
is allowed to the data receiving application (processing unit<br>
R2). In this embodiment, a key number, including date and time<br>
when use is allowed, is generated and assigned. In this case,<br>
the key number "3205151307" is generated as area number "3",<br>
processing unit number "2", month "05", day "15", hour "13"<br>
and minute "07". The key number may be generated by another<br>
encryption processing.<br>
In this embodiment, it is supervised whether the<br>
display processing instructions sent from each task belonging<br>
to each processing unit is for the display area for which use<br>
is allowed. Fig. 20 shows a flow chart of the supervisory<br>
processing program (display processing supervisory means).<br>
Supervision of display processing by the task T22 belonging to<br>
the data receiving application (processing unit R2) which<br>
obtained the display area E3 will be explained below.<br><br><br>
The task T22 of the data receiving application<br>
notifies the requesting display area E3, the assigned key<br>
number "3205151307" and the display content (for example,<br>
"straight line, x1 = 10. y1 = 20, x2 = 10, y2 = 80") to the<br>
CPU 12. Receiving this, the CPU 12 starts the processing in<br>
Fig. 20 (step S501). At first, the CPU 12 refers to the<br>
acquisition status storage table in Step S502, and recognizes<br>
that the key number of the display area E3 is "3205151307"<br>
(see Fig. 16C)1 Then the CPU 12 judges whether the key number<br>
notified by the task T22 which requested display processing<br>
and the key number of the acquisition status storage table<br>
match (Step S503).<br>
When they do not match, the CPU 12 does not execute<br>
display processing regarding that the task belonging to a<br>
processing unit which is not allowed use of the display area<br>
attempts invalid display processing. In other words, the<br>
display content is not displayed.<br>
In this case, the key number "3205151307" matches,<br>
therefore the CPU 12 judges the display processing request as<br>
valid, and executes the display processing for the display<br>
area E3 (Step S504). As a result, the display content is<br>
displayed. This display processing may be executed by the CPU<br>
12, or by another CPU or circuit.<br>
In this way, the program schedule application uses the<br>
area E2 at the left, and the data receiving application uses<br>
the area E3 at the right. If the program schedule application<br><br><br>
attempts display processing for the area E3, or if the data<br>
receiving application attempts display processing for the area<br>
E2, then the display processing is disabled by the supervisory<br>
processing program. Thus the program is supervised so as to<br>
maintain an appropriate display by disabling display<br>
processing by a task belonging to a processing unit which is<br>
not allowed use of the display area.<br>
Next, the case when the caption application<br>
(processing unit R3) requests acquisition of the upper half<br>
display area E4 while the left half display area E2 has been<br>
acquired by the program schedule application (processing unit<br>
R1) (see Fig. 16B) will be explained.<br>
When the acquisition request is received, the CPU<br>
starts the processing shown in Fig. 18 (Step S401). Since<br>
another processing unit has acquired the display area E2,<br>
which cannot coexist with the display area E4 in Step S404,<br>
the processing advances to Step S408. In Step S404, the CPU 12<br>
returns an acquisition failure notice to the processing unit<br>
R3. In other words, in this embodiment, the left half display<br>
area E2 and the upper half display area E4 cannot coexist<br>
since they partially overlap.<br>
In the above case, a key number is not assigned to a<br>
task belonging to the processing unit R3, therefore display<br>
processing for the display area 4 cannot be executed. Even if<br>
display processing is attempted, the display processing is<br>
disabled by the supervisory processing program shown in Fig.<br><br><br>
20.<br>
In this embodiment, a key number is encrypted by<br>
including such elements as hour and minute. Therefore even<br>
when use of the same display area is allowed, the key number<br>
may be different for each assignment. In the case of the<br>
status shown in Fig. 16C, for example, when the processing<br>
unit R1 releases the display area E2 and the processing unit<br>
R4 is allowed use of the display area, a key number different<br>
from the one for processing unit Rl. that is, "2105151209", is<br>
assigned. As a consequence, even if a task belonging to the<br>
processing unit Rl attempts display processing for the display<br>
area E2 using the old key number, "2105151305", the display<br>
processing is disabled.<br>
3.3 Handling of task attempted invalid processing<br>
In the above mentioned case, display processing by a<br>
task is not executed if key numbers do not match. However, as<br>
Step S506 in Fig. 22 shows, subsequent processing may be<br>
completely disabled for the processing unit which requested<br>
the display processing. In other words, regarding the<br>
processing unit as a processing unit which attempted invalid<br>
processing, the display area which the processing unit has<br>
acquired is forcibly released, resources the processing unit<br>
is using are forcibly released, and information on the<br>
processing unit recorded in the kernel which is performing<br>
task control is deleted, so as to remove the processing unit.<br><br><br>
In this way. invalid processing by an invalid processing unit<br>
can be prevented by removing the processing unit which<br>
attempted invalid processing.<br>
4. Third embodiment<br>
4.1 Example when overlapped areas are not allowed to<br>
coexist<br>
In accordance with the above mentioned first<br>
embodiment and second embodiment. when a plurality of<br>
processing units request acquisition of display areas which<br>
cannot coexist, the processing unit which sent an acquisition<br>
request first is allowed use of the display area. However, it<br>
is also acceptable that priority be assigned to each display<br>
area, and a processing unit which requested a display area<br>
which has the highest priority among the plurality of<br>
processing units which requested acquisition is allowed use of<br>
the display area.<br>
An embodiment using this type processing will be<br>
explained below. For convenience of explanation, the second<br>
embodiment applied to a digital broadcasting receiver is<br>
basically used for explanation.<br>
In the ROM 16 (Fig. 3), a display area priority table,<br>
as shown in Fig. 23, has been recorded. The display area<br>
priority table defines priority for each display area. In this<br>
embodiment, the smaller the number assigned as priority the<br>
higher the priority.<br><br><br>
Fig. 24 shows a flow chart of the acquisition request<br>
processing portion of the display control program in<br>
accordance with the present embodiment. The following<br>
explanation is based on the case when the processing unit R3<br>
requests acquisition of the display area E1 (entire area)<br>
while the processing unit R1 has acquired the display area E2<br>
(left half area), and the processing unit R2 has acquired the<br>
display area E3 (right half area), as shown in Fig. 16C.<br>
When the acquisition request from the processing unit<br>
R3 is received, the CPU 12 starts the processing shown in Fig.<br>
24 (Step S401) . Then referring -to the acquisition status<br>
storage table in Fig. 16C and the coexistence relationship<br>
table in Fig. 17, the CPU 12 judges whether the display area E1 requested by the processing unit R3 can coexist with the<br>
areas which have already been acquired (Steps S402, S403,<br>
S410). Since the display E1 cannot coexist with the display<br>
area E2 and the display area E3, the processing advances to<br>
Step S411.<br>
In Step S411, referring to the display area priority<br>
table in Fig. 23, the CPU 12 judges whether the newly<br>
requested display area has a higher priority than the display<br>
areas which have been acquired and cannot coexist with the<br>
newly requested display area. If the priority is not higher<br>
(priority is lower or the same), an acquisition failure notice<br>
is sent to the processing unit which requested acquisition<br>
(Step S413). Since priority of the display area E1 requested<br><br><br>
by the processing unit R3 is "1", and priority of the display<br>
areas E2 and E3 which have been acquired is "2", the display<br>
area E1 has the higher priority. Therefore processing advances<br>
to Step S412.<br>
In Step S412, the display areas E2 and E3 which have<br>
been acquired are released. In this case, the processing unit<br>
Rl and R2 are deleted from the display area storage, table.<br>
Then processing advances to Steps S405 and S406. and the.,<br>
processing unit R3 is allowed use of the display area E1. As a<br>
result, use of the screen allowed to processing units Rl and<br>
R2 is changed to use of the entire screen allowed to the<br>
processing unit R3.<br>
In this way, in accordance with the present embodiment,<br>
when acquisition of display areas which cannot coexist is<br>
requested, use is allowed to a processing unit which requested<br>
a display area having a higher priority.<br>
4.2 Example when overlapped areas are allowed to coexist<br>
In the above mentioned case, overlapped areas are not<br>
allowed to coexist. However, overlapped areas may be allowed<br>
to coexist, where for the overlapped portion, a display area<br>
having a higher priority is displayed with priority.<br>
In this case. Fig. 25 shows the definition of the<br>
display areas. Fig. 26 shows a coexistence relationship table,<br>
and Fig. 27 shows a display area priority table. The flow<br>
chart of the acquisition request processing is the same as Fig.<br><br><br>
24.<br>
Assume that an urgent display application requests<br>
acquisition of the top part display area E4 while an<br>
application is using the display area E1 on the entire screen.<br>
In this case, the urgent display application is allowed to use<br>
the display area E4 since the area E4 can coexist with the<br>
area E1.<br>
Fig. 28 shows a flow chart of the display processing<br>
program. It is preferable to provide the display processing<br>
program as a part of the operating system (OS). The case when<br>
an urgent display application which is allowed to use the<br>
display area E4, as mentioned above, executes display<br>
processing for the display area E4, will be explained as an<br>
example. At first, the display processing request sent by the<br>
urgent display application is judged whether it is a valid<br>
request by the supervisory processing shown in Fig. 22. If<br>
judged as valid because key numbers match, the display<br>
processing request is sent to the display processing program<br>
of the OS in Step S504 in Fig. 22.<br>
When the display processing request is received, CPU<br>
judges whether the target area of the display processing<br>
request (area E4 in this case) overlaps with another area for<br>
which use has been allowed (Step S801 In Fig. 28). Since it<br>
overlaps with the area E1 for which use has been allowed here,<br>
processing advances to Step S802. In Step S802, CPU judges<br>
whether priority of the target area (E4 in this case) is<br><br><br>
higher than that of the other area (E1 in this case). Since<br>
the target area has the higher priority here, processing<br>
advances to Step S803, and write processing for the target<br>
area is executed. In other words, the CPU 12 overwrites the<br>
target area (E4 in this case) portion of V-RAM 42 according to<br>
the display processing request.<br>
In this way, the urgent display, as shown in Fig. 29.<br>
is executed. By creating an area for the urgent display to<br>
overlap another area and by assigning a higher priority, as<br>
shown in this example, an appropriate urgent display becomes<br>
possible while efficiently using the screen.<br>
When a display request processing is executed for the<br>
display area E1 in the status shown in Fig. 29, the processing<br>
flow is as follows. Since the other area E4 has a higher<br>
priority in Step S802, processing advances to Step S804. In<br>
Step S804, write processing is executed for the target area,<br>
excluding the portion of the other area. In other words, the<br>
CPU 12 overwrites the target area E1 portion of V-RAM 42.<br>
excluding E4, according to the display processing request. As<br>
a result, the display area E1 can be overwritten without<br>
deleting the urgent display of the display area E4.<br>
5. Fourth embodiment<br>
In accordance with the third embodiment, when a<br>
plurality of processing units request acquisition of display<br>
areas which cannot coexist, a processing unit which requested<br><br><br>
a display area having the highest priority is allowed use of<br>
the display area. However, priority may be assigned to each<br>
processing unit so that a processing unit having the highest<br>
priority is allowed use of the display area.<br>
In this case, it is preferable that the processing<br>
unit priority table shown in Fig. 30 is stored in the ROM 16,<br>
and the acquisition request processing shown in Fig. 31 is<br>
executed. In Fig. 31. when a plurality of processing units<br>
request acquisition of display areas which cannot coexist, it<br>
is judged whether the processing unit newly requested<br>
acquisition has a higher priority than a processing unit which<br>
has acquired an area which cannot coexist (Step S414). If the<br>
processing unit which newly requested acquisition has a higher<br>
priority, the display area of the processing unit which has<br>
acquired the display area is released, and the processing unit<br>
which newly requested acquisition is allowed use of the<br>
display area (Step S412).<br>
The order of acquisition requests, priority of the<br>
display areas, and priority of the processing units may be<br>
freely combined in deciding which processing unit is allowed<br>
use of the display area.<br>
6. Fifth embodiment<br>
Fig. 32 shows a general configuration of the display<br>
control device 2 according to the fifth embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In this embodiment, dependency relationship<br><br><br>
storage means 24 is disposed. In the dependency relationship<br>
storage means 24, display areas which cannot coexist with the<br>
requested display area are indicated, and display area change<br>
information for making display areas coexist has been recorded.<br>
Based on the information of the dependency relationship<br>
storage means 24, the display area management means 4 judges<br>
whether a display area which cannot coexist with the requested<br>
display area have been acquired by another processing unit.<br>
When the display area has already been acquired, the display<br>
area management means 4 changes the already acquired display<br>
area of the processing unit for making it coexist based on the<br>
Information of the dependency relationship storage means 24,<br>
and allows the processing unit which requested acquisition use<br>
of the requested display area.<br>
The hardware configuration, when the display control<br>
device 2 in Fig. 32 is applied to a digital broadcasting<br>
receiver, is the same as in Fig. 3. In the ROM 16. however,<br>
dependency relationship information is also recorded, in<br>
addition to the definitions of display areas and the display<br>
control program.<br>
The definitions of display areas in this embodiment<br>
are the same as Fig. 14, and the content of the display area<br>
definition table is the same as Fig. 15. The acquisition<br>
status storage table is the same as Fig. 16.<br>
Fig. 33 shows the content of the dependency<br>
relationship table for recording dependency information. The<br><br><br>
dependency relationship table is stored in the ROM 16. The<br>
second line of this table, for example, shows that when<br>
acquisition is requested for the display area E2, and if the<br>
display area E1 has been acquired by another processing unit,<br>
coexistence is made possible by changing the area of another<br>
processing unit from E1 to E3.<br>
Fig. 34 shows a flow chart of an acquisition request<br>
processing portion of the display control program recorded in<br>
the ROM 16. The case when the processing unit R2 requests<br>
acquisition of the display area E2 while the display area E1<br>
has been acquired by the processing unit R1 (see Fig. 35A)<br>
will be explained below.<br>
When an acquisition request is received from the<br>
processing unit R2, the CPU 12 starts the processing shown in<br>
Fig. 34 (Step S601). At first, referring to the acquisition<br>
status storage table, the CPU 12 judges whether the requested<br>
display area E2 has been acquired by another processing unit.<br>
If it has been acquired, processing advances to Step S611. and<br>
the CPU 12 returns an acquisition failure notice to the<br>
processing unit R2. In this case, the display area E2 is open,<br>
as shown in Fig. 35A, so the processing advances to Step S604.<br>
In Step S604, referring to the dependency relationship<br>
table shown in Fig. 33, the CPU 12 obtains information on<br>
areas which the requested display area E2 depends on. In this<br>
case, the display areas E1, E4 and E5 are areas which the<br>
display area E2 depends on.<br><br><br>
Then referring to the acquisition status storage table,<br>
the CPU 12 judges whether the display areas E1, E4 and E5<br>
which the display area E2 depends on have been acquired by<br>
another processing unit (Step S606). If they have not been<br>
acquired by another processing unit, the CPU 12 allows the<br>
processing unit which requested acquisition to use the display<br>
area in Steps S607 and S608, regarding that use of the display<br>
area will not cause any problems in terms of display area<br>
coexistence. In this case, the display area E1 (entire screen<br>
area) which the display area E2 depends on has been acquired<br>
by the processing unit R1. Therefore if use of the display<br>
area E2 (left half screen area) were allowed to the processing<br>
unit R2, a part of the display area would overlap and<br>
appropriate display would not be executed.<br>
So in this embodiment, the display area of the<br>
processing unit Rl is changed from E1 (entire screen area) to<br>
E3 (right half screen area) according to the dependency<br>
relationship table in Fig. 33 (Step S610). After this change,<br>
the processing unit R2 which requested acquisition is allowed<br>
use of the display area E2 (left half screen area). As a<br>
consequence, the processing unit Rl displays on the right half<br>
of the screen, and the processing unit R2 displays on the left<br>
half of the screen.<br>
In Steps S607 and S608, the CPU 12 releases the<br>
display area E1, and at the same time notifies changes to the<br>
display area T3, a new key number, "3105151322", to the<br><br><br>
processing unit R1, and sends key number "2205151321" to the<br>
processing unit R2 for the display area T2. Fig. 35B shows the<br>
content of the acquisition status storage table after change.<br>
In this way. when acquisition is requested for a<br>
display area which cannot coexist, allocation of display areas<br>
is changed so that coexistence becomes possible.<br>
In accordance with this embodiment, the display area<br>
which has been acquired is changed to make coexistence<br>
possible, but the display area which acquisition is requested<br>
may be changed to make coexistence possible. When the display<br>
area E2 (left half screen area) has been acquired by the<br>
processing unit R1, for example, if the display area E1<br>
(entire screen area) is requested by the processing unit R2,<br>
the request of the processing unit R2 may be changed to the<br>
display area E3 (right half screen area) for which use is<br>
allowed.<br>
7. Sixth embodiment<br>
Fig. 36 shows a general configuration of the display<br>
control device according to the sixth embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In this embodiment, an available resource<br>
storage means 28 and a use resource storage means 26 are<br>
disposed. The available resource storage means 28 stores<br>
information on resources of each processing unit R1 - Rn. Here<br>
the concept "resource" includes not only such hardware as a<br>
modem, speaker, video equipment, CD-ROM and DVD drive, but<br><br><br>
also such software as data and programs. The use resource<br>
storage means 26 stores the current availability status of<br>
each resource.<br>
When a display area acquisition request is received<br>
from processing units R1 - Rn, the display area management<br>
means 4 judges whether the display area can coexist with the<br>
display areas which have been acquired by other processing<br>
units. If coexistence is not possible, the processing unit is<br>
not allowed use of the display area. If coexistence is<br>
possible, the display area management means 4 obtains<br>
information on a resource to be used by the processing unit<br>
which requested acquisition referring to the available<br>
resource storage means 28. Then referring to the use resource<br>
storage means 26, the display area management means 4 checks<br>
whether the resource can be used now. If the resource cannot<br>
be used, the display area management means 4 does not allow<br>
the processing unit which requested acquisition use of the<br>
display area. This is because allowing use of the display area<br>
is meaningless since the processing unit cannot execute<br>
processing using the resource. For example, when the<br>
processing unit cannot display unless the resource is<br>
available, display is not executed even if use of the display<br>
area is allowed to the processing unit.<br>
With the foregoing in view, it is preferable to judge<br>
whether resources required for display processing can be used.<br>
A resource which is not directly related to display processing<br><br><br>
but is very closely related to screen display, such as a<br>
speaker, may also be judged whether it can actually be used.<br>
In other words, not only resources which the processing unit<br>
needs for display processing but also resources required for<br>
sound processing related to the display processing may be<br>
judged whether they can actually be used.<br>
The hardware configuration, when the display control<br>
device 2 in Fig. 36 is applied to a digital broadcasting<br>
receiver, is the same as Fig. 3. In the ROM 16, however, the<br>
available resource table shown in Fig. 37 is stored. In the<br>
work memory 14, the use resource table shown in Fig. 38 is<br>
stored.<br>
Fig. 39 shows a flow chart of the acquisition request<br>
processing portion of the display control program recorded in<br>
the ROM 16. Here, the case when the task T2 of the processing<br>
unit R2 requests acquisition of the display area E3 at the<br>
lower part of the screen while the task T1 of the processing<br>
unit R1 has acquired the display area E2 at the upper right of<br>
the screen, as shown in Fig. 7B, will be explained. It is<br>
assumed that the processing unit 2 is a browser application.<br>
The browser application accesses the Internet via a modem 17<br>
to read home pages. It is also assumed that the processing<br>
unit Rl is a telephone shopping application which executes<br>
display, as shown in Fig. 40. Here, the viewer has selected a<br>
purchase application, therefore the CPU 12 calls the reception<br>
center of the telephone shopping company via the modem 17. In<br><br><br>
other words, the modem 17 has already been used by the<br>
telephone shopping application (processing unit R1) as shown<br>
in Fig. 38.<br>
When an acquisition request is received from the<br>
browser application (processing unit R2), the CPU 12 staxts<br>
the processing shown in Fig. 39 (Step S701). Then referring to<br>
the acquisition status storage table in Fig. 7B, the CPU 12<br>
judges whether the requested display area E3 has been acquired<br>
by another processing unit (Steps S702, S703). In this case,<br>
the display area E3 is open, so processing advances to Step<br>
S704.<br>
In Step S704, referring to the available resource<br>
table in Fig. 37, the CPU 12 extracts resources to be used by<br>
the processing unit R2 which requested acquisition. In this<br>
case, a modem and a speaker are extracted. Then referring to<br>
the use resource table in Fig. 38, the CPU 12 judges whether<br>
the extracted modem and speaker are in use by another<br>
processing unit (Steps S705, S706). When all extracted<br>
resources can be used, the CPU 12 allows use of the display<br>
area to the processing unit, and writes that the resources to<br>
be used by the processing unit are in use in the use resource<br>
table in Fig. 38 (Steps S708, S709).<br>
In this case, the modem is in use by the telephone<br>
shopping application (processing unit R1), as shown in Fig. 38.<br>
so processing advances from Step S706 to S710. In Step S710,<br>
the CPU 12 notifies the browser application (processing unit<br><br><br>
R2) that display area acquisition failed. In this way, it is<br>
judged whether use of the display area is allowed considering<br>
the use status of resources.<br>
When a processing unit requests to release an area,<br>
the CPU 12 writes the release of the resource which the<br>
processing unit has been using in the use resource table. As a<br>
consequence, always the latest use status is stored in the use<br>
resource table.<br>
In accordance with the above embodiment, the resource<br>
cannot be used if another processing unit is using it. However,<br>
for a resource which specified the number of processing units<br>
(or tasks) that can be used simultaneously, whether that<br>
resource can be used may be judged by the number of processing<br>
units (tasks) which are actually using the resource.<br>
In the above explanation, use of the display area is<br>
allowed after judging whether such a resource as a modem is<br>
available. However, when the processing unit is for displaying<br>
the data of an electronic program schedule, use of the display<br>
area may be allowed after judging whether the data is actually<br>
received. In other words, the resources include not only<br>
hardware but also such software as data.<br>
8. Seventh embodiment<br>
In accordance with the above embodiments, when<br>
acquisition is requested for a display area which cannot<br>
coexist, an acquisition failure notice is returned to the<br><br><br>
processing unit. However, the processing unit which is not<br>
allowed use of the display area may be stored as acquisition<br>
waiting, so as to acquire the display area when use can be<br>
allowed.<br>
This embodiment will be explained based on the second<br>
embodiment in Fig. 13. The flow chart of acquisition request<br>
processing is shown in Fig. 41, instead of Fig. 18. The flow<br>
chart of release request processing is shown in Fig. 42. In<br>
the work memory 14, the acquisition waiting table, as shown in<br>
Fig. 43, is stored.<br>
Here, the case when the content of the acquisition<br>
status storage table is in the status shown in Fig. 16C (that<br>
is, the status when the processing unit R1 is using the left<br>
of the screen and the processing unit R2 is using the right of<br>
the screen) and the processing unit R4 newly requests<br>
acquisition of the display area E2 will be explained. It is<br>
assumed that nothing has been stored in the acquisition wait<br>
table, as shown in Fig. 43A.<br>
When an acquisition request from the processing unit<br>
R4 is received, the CPU 12 refers to the acquisition status<br>
storage table (Fig. 16) and coexistence relationship table<br>
(Fig. 17), and judges whether use of the display area E2 can<br>
be allowed (Step S402, S403, S404). In this case, the display<br>
area E2 has been acquired by the processing unit R1 and cannot<br>
coexist, so processing advances to Step S410.<br>
In Step S410, the CPU 12 notifies acquisition waiting<br><br><br>
to the processing unit R4, and the CPU 12 stores information<br>
that the processing unit R4 is waiting for acquisition of the<br>
display area E2 in the acquisition wait table (Step S411).<br>
When processing units have already been stored in the<br>
acquisition wait table, the processing units may be rearranged<br>
according to predetermined priority. In other words, the<br>
processing units are rearranged such that a processing unit<br>
with a higher priority comes first. For the priority used for<br>
this rearrangement, the order of sending acquisition requests,<br>
priority assigned to the requested display areas (see Fig. 23),<br>
and priority assigned to processing units (Fig. 30), for<br>
example, can be used.<br>
In this way, the processing unit which is not allowed<br>
use is stored in the acquisition wait table.<br>
Next, release request processing will be explained<br>
referring to Fig. 42. Here, it is assumed that the processing<br>
unit Rl requests the display area E2 in the status shown in<br>
Fig. 16C for explanation. The acquisition wait table is<br>
assumed to be in the status shown in Fig. 43B.<br>
When the release request is received, the CPU 12<br>
refers to the acquisition status storage table, and judges<br>
whether the processing unit Rl which requested release of the<br>
display area E2 has acquired the display area E2 (Steps S302,<br>
S303). Since the processing unit Rl has acquired the display<br>
area E2 in this case, the CPU 12 deletes the processing unit<br>
R1 from the acquisition status storage table and returns a<br><br><br>
release OK notice (Steps S304, S305).<br>
Then the CPU 12 advances to Step S310 and reads the<br>
acquisition wait table, shown in Fig. 43B. from the beginning.<br>
Here, the request by the processing unit R4 for the display<br>
area E2 is read. For this acquisition request in wait status,<br>
the CPU 12 executes processing of the acquisition request in<br>
wait status, as shown in Fig. 44. Since the area E2 requested<br>
by the processing unit R4 can coexist in this case, processing<br>
advances from Step S404 to S405.<br>
In Step S405, the CPU 12 stores the processing unit R4<br>
in the acquisition status storage table and returns the key<br>
number to the processing unit R4 (Steps S405, S406). Then the<br>
CPU 12 deletes the acquisition request by the processing unit<br>
R4 for the display area E2 from the acquisition wait table<br>
(Step S412).<br>
In this way, the processing unit R4 can be allowed to<br>
acquire the display area at the point when use of the display<br>
area becomes possible.<br>
Then the CPU 12 reads the next acquisition request<br>
stored in the acquisition wait table, and executes the<br>
processing shown in Fig. 44 for this request as well. This is<br>
because two or more requests may be allowed to use a<br>
respective area when the released area is large. After<br>
executing processing for all acquisition requests in wait<br>
status in the order of priority, the CPU 12 ends release<br>
request processing (Step S407).<br><br><br>
In accordance with this embodiment, each processing<br>
unit which requested acquisition is eventually allowed use of<br>
the respective area according to the change of status even if<br>
use is not immediately allowed.<br>
9. Other embodiments<br>
In the above embodiments, the case when the present<br>
invention is applied to a digital broadcasting receiver was<br>
explained, but the present invention can be applied to<br>
equipment where a plurality of applications execute display<br>
processing. In other words, the present invention can be<br>
applied to equipment having the basic configuration shown in<br>
Fig. 12 (the work memory 14 and the ROM 16 may be integrated).<br>
For example, the present invention can be applied to a home<br>
game machine, a telephone with display and a personal computer.<br>
In a car navigation system, the present invention can<br>
be applied for displaying map information and Internet<br>
information, for example.<br>
Also in a DVD system, the present invention can be<br>
applied when image information and such text information as a<br>
menu are displayed during the authoring of images.<br>
The present invention can also be applied to the<br>
screen display of a personal computer. Particularly, the<br>
present invention is effective for computers used in factory<br>
automation (FA), where the user cannot change the screen<br>
display format.<br><br><br>
In the above embodiments, the tasks T1 - Tn for<br>
carrying out display processing are executed by the CPU 12,<br>
but may be executed by another CPU.<br>
Also in the above embodiments, display areas have been<br>
defined in advance, but the user may change the size and<br>
position of the display areas.<br>
Also in the above embodiments, each means in the<br>
general configuration is implemented by the CPU, but a part or<br>
all of the means may be configured by hardware logic.<br>
10. Eighth embodiment<br>
10.1 General configuration<br>
In accordance with the above embodiments, it is judged<br>
whether the display area subject to the acquisition requested<br>
can coexist with other display areas which have been used, and<br>
if coexistence is possible, use of the display area is allowed.<br>
However, processing units which are allowed use of the display<br>
area may be predetermined for each display area so that<br>
allowing use of the display area is judged according to this<br>
information.<br>
Fig. 45 shows the general configuration of the display<br>
control device 2 according to the eighth embodiment. The<br>
display area storage means 6 stores definitions of the display<br>
areas set on the screen of the display device 8. In this<br>
embodiment, acquisition right information storage means 30<br>
connected to the display area management means is disposed.<br><br><br>
The acquisition right information storage means 30 stores<br>
processing units which can be allowed use of the display area<br>
for each display area. When one of the tasks T1 - Tn requests<br>
acquisition of a display area, the display area management<br>
means 4 judges whether use of the display area can be allowed<br>
to the task based on the content stored in the acquisition<br>
right information storage means 30. If the acquisition right<br>
for the requested display area is given to the task in the<br>
acquisition right information storage means 30, use is allowed.<br>
If the acquisition right is not given, use is not allowed.<br>
10.2.1 Example when one processing unit is allocated to one<br>
display area<br>
The hardware configuration, when this embodiment is<br>
applied to digital satellite broadcasting, is shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 46 shows a display area definition example in accordance<br>
with this embodiment. Fig. 47 shows the display area<br>
definition table stored in the ROM 16. And Fig. 48 shows the<br>
acquisition right information table stored in the ROM 16.<br>
According to this acquisition right information table, use of<br>
the display area E1 is allowed to the task T1, use of the<br>
display area E2 is allowed to the task T2. and use of the<br>
display area E3 is allowed to the task T3.<br>
Fig. 49 shows a flow chart of the acquisition request<br>
processing portion of the display control program stored in<br>
the ROM 16. For example, the case when the task T3 requests<br><br><br>
acquisition of the display area E1 will be explained. At first,<br>
the CPU 12 obtains the acquisition right information table<br>
from the ROM 16 (Step S901). Then the CPU 12 judges whether<br>
the task T3, which requested the acquisition, has an<br>
acquisition right for the display area E1 referring to the<br>
acquisition right information table (Step S902). In this case,<br>
the task T3 does not have an acquisition right for the display<br>
area E1, so the CPU 12 notifies an acquisition failure to the<br>
task T3 (Step S904).<br>
When the task T1 requests acquisition of the display<br>
area E1, the CPU 12 also judges whether use is allowed<br>
referring to the acquisition right information table in the<br>
same manner (Step S902). In this case, the task T1 has an<br>
acquisition right for the display area E1, so the CPU 12<br>
notifies an acquisition OK to the task T1 (Step S903).<br>
In this way, in accordance with this embodiment, each<br>
display area is defined so as not to overlap, and only one<br>
processing unit (task) is allowed use of each display area,<br>
therefore the display of each task does not overlap and is not<br>
lost.<br>
10.3 Example when a plurality of processing units are<br>
allocated to one display area<br>
The acquisition right information table may be defined<br>
as shown in Fig. 50, so that one display area can be used by a<br>
plurality of tasks (processing units). In this state.<br><br><br>
acquisition request processing is executed so that only one<br>
task (processing unit) is allowed use of each display area.<br>
For example, when the task T1 requests acquisition of the<br>
display area E1, use is allowed if no other tasks have<br>
acquired the display area. When the task 1 requests<br>
acquisition of the display area E1, use is not allowed when<br>
another task (task T2 or T5) has acquired the display area.<br>
In this way, when a plurality of tasks (tasks which<br>
have an acquisition right for the display area) request<br>
acquisition of one display area, the task which requested<br>
acquisition first is allowed use of the display area. However,<br>
the task which requested acquisition last may be allowed use<br>
of the display area. Also priority may be assigned to each<br>
task in advance so that a task which has the highest priority<br>
is allowed use of the display area.<br>
10.4.1 Example when a plurality of tasks are allowed to use<br>
one display area<br>
In this example, when a plurality of tasks (tasks<br>
which have an acquisition right for the display area) request<br>
acquisition of one display area, a plurality of tasks which<br>
requested acquisition are allowed use of the display area. In<br>
this case, display processing is executed by the plurality of<br>
tasks which are allowed use of the display area for the one<br>
display area. Therefore, in this case, display processing<br>
among the plurality of tasks which are allowed use of the one<br><br><br>
display area is adjusted among the tasks. In other words, an<br>
adjustment of display processing among the tasks is necessary,<br>
but this adjustment among the tasks is easy since the number<br>
of tasks which can use each display area is limited.<br>
The upper limit of the number of tasks (number of<br>
processing units) which can be used simultaneously may be<br>
defined in the acquisition right information table, as shown<br>
in Fig. 51. In this table, use of the display area E1 is<br>
allowed to the tasks T1, T2 and T5, but the number of tasks<br>
which can be allowed simultaneously is defined as 2. Use of<br>
the display area E2 is allowed to the task T2, and the number<br>
of tasks which can be allowed simultaneously is defined as 1.<br>
Also, use of the display area E3 is allowed to the task T3 and<br>
T4, and the number of tasks which can be allowed<br>
simultaneously is defined as 2. In this embodiment, the work<br>
memory 14 has the acquisition status storage table shown in<br>
Fig. 53, to manage the number of tasks using each display area.<br>
Fig. 52 shows a flow chart of acquisition request<br>
processing in accordance with this embodiment. Here, the case<br>
when the task T5 requests acquisition of the display area E1<br>
while the tasks T1 and T2 have been allowed use of the display<br>
area E1, as shown in Fig. 53, will be explained as an example.<br>
At first, the CPU 12 obtains the acquisition right<br>
information (Step S1001), and judges whether the task T5 has<br>
an acquisition right for the display area E1 (Step S1002). In<br>
this case, the task T5 has the acquisition right (see Fig. 51),<br><br><br>
so processing advances to Step S1003. In Step S1003. the CPU<br>
12 obtains information on the number of tasks using the<br>
display area E1 referring to the acquisition status storage<br>
table in Fig. 53. In this case, the CPU 12 recognizes that two<br>
tasks, T1 and T2, are using the display area E1.<br>
Then the CPU 12 judges whether the number of tasks<br>
using the display area, which is 2, is smaller than the number<br>
of tasks which can use the display area written in the<br>
acquisition right information table, which is 2 (Step S1004).<br>
In this case, the former is not smaller than (equal to) the<br>
latter, so the CPU 12 judges that no more tasks are allowed<br>
use of the display area, and notifies an acquisition failure<br>
(Step S1007).<br>
In this way, tasks exceeding the number of tasks which<br>
can use the display area are not allowed use of the display<br>
area. By limiting the number of tasks which can use the<br>
display area like this, the adjustment of display processing<br>
among tasks is prevented from becoming complicated.<br>
In the above embodiment, the CPU 12 refers to the<br>
acquisition right information table, as shown in Fig. 50, and<br>
the task T3 is not allowed use of the display area E1, for<br>
example. However, a task which is not written in the<br>
acquisition right information table, such as the task T3, may<br>
be allowed use of the display area if acquisition is requested<br>
by the task alone, so that when acquisition is requested by a<br>
task having an acquisition right (e.g. T1), the task having<br><br><br>
the acquisition right is allowed use of the display area and<br>
use by the task T3 is cancelled.<br>
The eighth embodiment can be Implemented by combining<br>
with one of the first to seventh embodiments. Also for the<br>
eighth embodiment, a modification similar to the second to<br>
seventh embodiments can be applied to the first embodiment.<br>
While the embodiments of the present invention, as<br>
disclosed herein, constitute preferred forms, it is to be<br>
understood that each term was used as illustrative and not<br>
restrictive, and can be changed within the scope of the claims<br>
