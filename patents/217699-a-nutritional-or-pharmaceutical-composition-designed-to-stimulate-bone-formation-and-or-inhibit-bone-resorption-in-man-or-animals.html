FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field concerning the maintenance or re-establishment of the equilibrium in bone metabolism in man or animals, in particular for the prevention or the treatment of disorders linked to an imbalance of bone metabolism by means of nutritional intake or therapeutic administration of a composition stimulating bone formation and/or inhibiting bone resorption.<br>
PRIOR ART.<br>
Bone is not a static tissue. Bone undergoes constant remodelling as a result of the destruction and de novo synthesis of bone tissue in a complex process involving two main types of cells, the osteoblasts which produce new bone tissue and the osteoclasts which destroy bone, respectively.<br>
The activities of these cells are regulated by a large number of cytokines and growth factors, most of which have been identified and cloned, as has been described in the general review by Mundy {Mundy, G.R., 1996, Clin. Orthop., vol. 324 : 24-28 ; Mundy, G.R.. 1993, J.Bone Miner Res, vol 8 : S 505 - S 510).<br>
The osteoblasts, the cells responsible for bone formation, differentiate from precursor cells and express and secrete many enzymes and many structural proteins of the bone matnx, including collagen type I, osteocalcin, osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase (Stein G et al., 1990, Curr. Opin Cell Biol, vol.2: 1018-1027; Harris S et al. ,1994, J. Bone Miner Res Vol.9:855-863).<br>
The osteoblasts also synthesise many growth regulatory peptides, including the BMP 
 <br>
Like alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and osteopontin, the BMP peptides are expressed by osteoblasts in culture at the time when these cells proliferate and differentiate.<br>
The osteoclasts are multinucleated cells which are responsible for bone loss in a process generally designated bone resorption.<br>
In a healthy adult, man or animal, the joint action of the osteoblasts and osteoclasts makes possible the maintenance of the bone mass over time and simultaneously ensures remodelling of bone tissue by resorption and de novo synthesis of bone.<br>
In a healthy adult, the rate of formation of the osteoclasts and osteoblasts is such that a balance is struck between bone formation and bone resorption. However, in osteoporotic individuals, an imbalance in the process of bone remodelling is produced which culminates in a loss of bone which proceeds at a more rapid rate than the rate of formation. Although this imbalance exists to a certain extent in most individuals as they age, it is much more severe and occurs at a younger age in osteoporotic individuals.<br>
Thus, in man and other mammals a great variety of disorders are related to abnormal metabolism of bone resorption and bone formation, leading to an imbalance in metabolism or bone remodelling.<br>
In particular, a great heterogeneity is observed in the value of the peak bone mass depending on the individuals, this heterogeneity being due to large variations in the process of bone growth from a very young age. Thus, the maximal bone mass attained on reaching adulthood, consequently designated peak bone mass, is very variable from one individual to another. As they grow old, the individuals who possess a low value for the peak bone mass and who undergo bone loss due to ageing are at a disadvantage. Thus, irrespective of the individual, an early preventive treatment of bone loss is recommended, so as to reduce as much as possible the imbalances in bone remodelling which are produced in a non-pathological manner with ageing, in particular the risks of premature bone fractures.<br>
Of the pathological disorders related to an imbalance in bone metabolism,  particular mention may be made of the disorders or<br><br>
diseases such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, bone loss or osteolysis observed close to a prosthesis, metastatic bone diseases, hypercalcemia due to a cancer, multiple myelomas and periodontal diseases.<br>
Some of the disorders or diseases of bone metabolism may be caused by long-term immobilisation, for example long-term hospitalisation or even after a period of weightlessness.<br>
Of the disorders linked to abnormal bone resorption, the most common is osteoporosis, the most frequent manifestation of which is observed in women after the start of menopause. Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterised by a reduction of the bone mass and a deterioration of the microarchitecture of bone tissue, associated with an increase of the fragility of the bone and its susceptibility to fracture.<br>
There are other factors likely to increase bone loss leading to osteoporosis, such as the consumption of cigarettes, alcohol abuse, a sedentary life style, a low calcium intake, an unbalanced diet or also vitamin D deficiency.<br>
Since osteoporosis, like other disorders associated with bone loss, constitutes a chronic disorder, its prevention and its treatment must be planned in the long term.<br>
It is currently accepted that early treatment must be preferred because the two critical phases for bone capital are :<br>
-	the period of growth during which the maximal bone mass (peak<br>
bone mass) is acquired ;<br>
-	ageing which conditions the rate of loss of bone mass.<br>
The prevention of osteoporosis must hence no longer be<br>
restricted to the elderly individual<br>
Moreover, in man and animals, there are many conditions characterised by the need to increase bone formation. For example, in the case of bone fractures, it is necessary to stimulate bone growth in order to accelerate complete repair of the bone. This need is also present in the periodontal diseases, the metastatic diseases of bone, the osteolytic diseases and the conditions under which repair of the connective tissue is required, for example for the cicatrisation or regeneration of defects or traumatisms of cartilage. The stimulation of<br><br>
bone growth is also required in the case of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, as well as in osteoporosis associated with diabetes and in osteoporosis associated with glucocorticoids.<br>
To-day there are many compounds active on the stimulation of bone formation or the inhibition of bone resorption, among which mention may be made of the family of the polyphosphonate compounds (European patent No. EP 210 728), the thioamide oxazolidinones (US patent application published under No2002/0010341), the amino bis-phosphonate compounds (US patent application published under No 2001/0046977) or also the isoflavone compounds (US patent application published under No 2002/0035074). The use of a plant extract of the Lycopersicon genus has also been suggested (US patent application published under No 2002/0009510).<br>
Although there exists to-day a large variety of active compounds for stimulating bone formation and/or inhibiting bone resorption, there is a constant need for new active compounds, in particular owing to the limited success of the current treatments.<br>
Furthermore, in view of the chronic character of some conditions caused by an imbalance in bone metabolism, there is a need for new active compounds which it will be possible to use in the long term in man and animals, and which are likely to be available in the form of a food additive, for example in the form of a nutritional composition.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
According to the invention, a nutritional composition and a pharmaceutical composition for human or veterinary use are provided which are designed to stimulate bone formation and/or inhibit bone resorption in man or animals and which contain, as active ingredient, the compound hesperidin or one of its derivatives..<br>
Hesperidin is a naturally occurring glucoside compound found principally in citrus fruit, i.e. the fruits of the Citrus genus. The majority of the hesperidin is present in the peel of the citrus fruits but it is also found in large quantities in the pulp and hence the juice of the citrus fruits, including oranges and lemons.<br>
Hesperidin is a glucosylated compound comprising a flavanone nucleus of hesperetin (3',5',5-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavanone) to which is covalently linked a glucoside moiety of rutinose. .L-rhamnosyMa 1^6)-glucose), bound to the hydroxyl group present on the carbon at position 7 of hesperetin.<br>
The compound hesperidin is a compound of the flavonoid family which is currently used in combination with vitamin C in order to potentiate the biological activity of vitamin C, in particular by reducing the denaturation of vitamin C as a result of oxidation. In this application, hesperidin is suggested as an auxiliary agent in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, in particular of hypertension and haemorrhages.<br>
Hesperidin has also been described as a chondro-protective agent owing to its capacity to inhibit the destruction of the matrix of chondrocytes derived from cartilage (patent application No EP 633 022).<br><br>
Hesperidin has also been suggested in the prior art as an agent for the prevention of the pigmentation of the skin (German patent application No DE 19742 025), as an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (US patent No 5 ,763,414) or of acyl CoA-cholesterol-Oacyl transferase (PCT application No WO 99/21.549} or also of platelet aggregation (Korean patent application No KR 276 979.<br>
In a surprising manner, it has been shown according to the invention that hesperidin stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption..<br>
As is illustrated by the examples, hesperidin induces an increase in the density of metaphyseal bone tissue (trabecular bone) and in the density of the diaphyseal bone (cortical bone), thus inducing an improvement in bone mineralisation.<br>
Hesperidin also stimulates bone accretion as is shown by the marked increase of the plasma levels of osteocalcin observed in the animals which have received food supplemented with this compound.<br>
it has also been shown that hesperidin causes a stop to the multiplication of osteoblast precursor cells and brings about their differentiation to mature osteoblasts, as is visualised by the induction of an increase in the activity of alkaline phosphatase. Similarly, hesperidin induces an increase in the accumulation of calcium in the osteoblasts.<br>
In addition, hesperidin inhibits bone resorption in oophorectomised rats, which is the reference experimental animal model mimicking human osteoporosis,<br>
In particular, it has been shown according to the invention that hesperidin makes possible the maintenance of bone capital in the course of ageing in the individuals which have terminated their growth, in particular in individuals in a situation of hormonal deficiency, as is observed in the 6 months old oophorectomised rats, which are a model mimicking the physiological situation of menopause.<br>
These two related activities of hesperidin on bone formation and the inhibition of bone resorption respectively confer on it great utility as a compound active in man or animals for maintaining or re-establishing the balance in bone metabolism, i.e.:<br><br>
-	either by maintaining constant over time, with age, the activities of the osteoblast and osteoclast cells and thus preventing disorders of bone metabolism;<br>
-	or by rectifying an imbalance in bone metabolism , for example in disorders like osteoporosis or also by stimulating bone regeneration for example in the case of infraction or fracture of bone.<br>
Thus, the object of the present invention is the use of the compound hesperidin or of one of its derivatives for the manufacture of a composition capable of maintaining or re-establishing the balance in bone metabolism in man or animal by stimulating bone formation and/or by inhibiting bone resorption.<br>
By hesperidin is meant the compound (S)-7-[[$-0-(6-deoxy-a-L-mannopyranosyl)-p-D-giucopyranosyF]oxy]-2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyi}-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one.<br>
By "derivative" of hesperidin, is meant according to the invention the following compounds:<br>
-	the compound hesperetin, consisting of the non-glycosylated flavanone nucleus of hesperidin,   which has the following formula:  (S)-2,3-dihydro-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one ;3',5,7-trihydroxy -4-methoxyflavanone ;<br>
-	a-glucosyl-hesperidin, which bears a chain of 1 to 20 glucose residues joined together by a 1,4-link, the chain of glucose residues being itself attached by a linkage of the 1,4 type to position 4 of the glucose residue of hesperidin; these derivatives of hesperidin and the procedure for their preparation are described in particular in the patent application No EP 0 825 19 and in the US patent No. 6,048,712.<br>
-	the methyl-hesperidin compounds, in particular the compound 31-methyl-7-(rhamnosyl-2-methyl-glucosyl) hesperidin and the compound 31-methylhesperidin, these compounds as well as the procedure for their preparation being described in the US patent No858,784 ;<br>
-	the conjugates of hesperetin and sulfate or glucuronide,<br>
which are found with hesperetin as products of the metabolism of hesperidin in the systemic circulation.<br>
By" stimulation of bone formation " is meant according to the<br><br>
invention, the capacity of hesperidin or of one of its derivatives to stimulate the activity of osteoblasts and thus promote the synthesis of the protein network of bone and the deposition of minerals, in particular calcium, in this protein network, i.e. to stimulate the mineralisation of the bone, also called bone accretion.<br>
In order to verify that the supply of hesperidin to man or animals, in particular a mammal, stimulates the formation of bone, the specialist skilled in the art will be able to have recourse in particular to conventional densitometry measurements and to verify that the supply of hesperidin or of one of its derivatives induces an increase of the bone density at a given dose<br>
The specialist skilled in the art may also have recourse to any of the other tests also described in the examples, such as the measurement of the resistance of bone to rupture or also to the measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity and the measurement of the accumulation of calcium in the osteoblast cells.<br>
By " inhibition of bone resorption" is meant according to the invention inhibition of the destructive activity of bone tissue by the osteoclast cells. In order to verify that the supply of hesperidin or of one of its derivatives in man or animals inhibits bone resorption, the specialist skilled in the art can measure the urinary excretion of desoxypyridtnoline as described in the examples, a diminution of the expression of desoxypyridinoline being the reflection of inhibition of bone resorption.<br>
The supply of hesperidin or of one of its derivatives to an animal organism induces simultaneously a stimulation of bone formation and inhibition of bone resorption, the overall increase of bone mineralisation, and hence of the bone density, being the result of the induction of these two mechanisms.<br>
In order to determine whether a subject presents a state of reduced bone mass and as a consequence requires a supply of hesperidin or of one of its derivatives, the specialist skilled in the art will be able to refer in particular to the report of the World Health Organisation (WHO) of 1994 entitled "Assessment of fracture risk and its application to screening for postmenopausal osteoporosis" (WHO Technical Series-843).<br><br>
A nutritional composition or a therapeutic composition containing hesperidin or one of its derivatives as active ingredient is designed in the first instance for the prevention of bone loss due to an imbalance in the remodelling of bone tissue in man or animals in particular in a non-human mammal, in particular a domestic mammal like a dog or a cat or even a horse, in particular a thoroughbred.<br>
A composition such as defined above is also designed to promote bone growth in young individuals in order to obtain individuals possessing high bone density and, if possible, concomitantly a high peak bone mass. In particular, a composition according to the invention is useful during the growth phase of man as well as other mammals, in particular of pedigree dogs, and also racehorses.<br>
The composition containing hesperidin or one of its derivatives is also designed for individuals presenting symptoms of bone deficit or likely to suffer from bone deficit, i.e. from an imbalance in the relationship between bone formation and bone resorption which, if it continues, induces a diminution of the bone mass. A composition according to the invention is also designed for individuals presenting symptoms of bone deficit resulting from a fracture, an operation or also a dental disease.<br>
In particular, a nutritional or pharmaceutical composition designed for human or veterinary medicine according to the invention is useful in the treatment of diseases such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, bone loss or osteolysis observed close to a prosthesis, metastatic bone diseases, hypercalcemia due to a cancer, multiple myelomas, periodontal diseases or also osteoarthritis<br>
The composition according to the invention may be available in the form of a nutritional composition or also in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, as is described hereafter.<br>
It has also been shown according to the invention that hesperidin induces the cessation of the multiplication and causes the differentiation of osteoblast cells without requiring the presence of auxiliary agents such as osteoblast differentiation factors like vitamin D3 and dexamethasone, contrary to many anti-osteoporosis compounds described in the prior art. This experimental observation emphasizes the value of hesperidin and its   derivatives   for  stimulating   bone   formation   or   inhibiting   bone<br><br>
resorption, because these compounds are biologically active when used on their own and consequently do not require to be supplied to the organism in the form of a combination of hesperidin or of one of its derivatives with another compound such as a vitamin.<br>
In addition, the fact that hesperidin induces an increase not only of the trabecular bone density but also of the cortical bone density demonstrates the high level of biological activity of this molecule. In fact, the trabecular bone, which forms the head of the bone and which is extensively vascularised is the preferred site of the exchanges of calcium between the bone and the systemic circulation, whereas the cortical bone which forms the straight body of the bone and which is vascularised only to a slight extent, is much less likely to be affected rapidly by a change in its mineralisation.<br>
Nutritional   compositions   containing   hesperidin   or  one   of  its derivatives<br>
As has already been mentioned above, many disorders linked to an imbalance of bone metabolism, such as osteoporosis, develop gradually over a long period of time and require chronic treatments. Their prevention or their treatment can hence be carried out by means of a regular supply of hesperidin or of one of its derivatives, preferably in the form of a nutritional composition.<br>
Similarly, a regular nutritional supply of hesperidin to young growing individuals, humans or animals, is such as to make possible the production of a high bone density and an elevated peak bone mass by stimulation of bone formation when these individuals attain adult age.<br>
A regular nutritional supply of hesperidin is also useful for preventing the bone loss that occurs with ageing.<br>
The object of the invention is also a nutritional composition for stimulating bone formation and/or inhibiting bone resorption, characterised in that it contains, as active nutritional compound, the compound hesperidin or one of its derivatives.<br>
By "nutritional composition" is meant according to the invention, a composition   containing   hesperidin   or   one   of  its   derivatives   and<br><br>
constituting a dietary composition or even a dietary supplement not possessing the characteristics of a medicine.<br>
The different uses of the compound hesperidin or of one of it derivatives for the manufacture of a nutritional composition will be defined hereafter in relation to the technical characteristics of the said nutritional composition.<br>
A nutritional composition accorcfing to the invention is preferably suitable for oral administration.<br>
According to a first feature, a nutritional composition according to the invention is a dietary food used for the maintenance of the good health of humans or animate who ingest it. Such a nutritional composition is also commonly designated "functional food", which is designed to be consumed either as an integral part of the diet or as a food supplement, but whose content of hesperidin or one of its derivatives implies a physiological role exceeding the supply of basic nutrient needs.<br>
According to a first feature, the said nutritional composition is designed to stimulate bone formation in young individuals in the growth phase,<br>
According to a second feature, the said nutritional composition is designed to prevent the bone loss that occurs with ageing.<br>
According to a third feature, the said nutritional composition is designed to prevent or treat disorders linked to an imbalance in the relationship between bone formation and bone resorption.<br>
According to a fourth feature, the said nutritional composition is designed to treat a bone defect resulting from a fracture.<br>
According to yet another feature, the said nutritional composition is designed to prevent or treat diseases selected from osteoporosis, Paget's disease, bone loss or osteolysis observed close to a prosthesis, metastatic bone diseases, hypercalcemia due to a cancer, multiple myelomas, periodontal diseases or osteoarthritis.<br>

In addition, the invention is illustrated without being limited by the following examples.<br><br>
Example   1   :   Effect of hesperidin  on  bone  metabolism  in  the oophorectomised rat.<br>
The objective of this set of experiments was to test the impact of hesperetin on the bone metabolism of the oophorectomised rat (OVX) in comparison with that of sham-operated control rats (SH). Hesperetin is a fiavanone, the glycosylated form of which (hesperidin) is specific for citrus fruit, and more particularly for the orange. This flavonoid is not present in other plant products. It is in the form of hesperidin that the experimental diets were supplemented.<br>
A. MATERIAL AND METHODS<br>
In order to study the possible impact of this molecule on bone tissue, 40 female 3 months old Wistar rats (266 ± 2 g) were used. These animals were accustomed to a basic semi-synthetic diet for the 7 days preceding the start of the period of experimentation. At DO, 20 rats were sham-operated,  the  other 20 were  oophorectomised.   Distributed  in groups of 10, they were fed on various diets for 3 months, at the end of which they were sacrificed. The last week before being killed, from D85 to D90, the rats were inspected and the urine was collected (over a period of 24 hours). Similarly, the body composition of the rats was measured. After being killed the plasma and the femurs were collected for different analyses [Femurs : resistance to rupture, densitometry ; Plasma : osteocalcinemia (marker for osteoblast activity), hesperetin level:    Urines:    desoxypyridinoline    (marker   for   bone    resorption)]. Throughout the entire duration of the experimentation, the rats were weighed once a week. The daily quantity of food distributed to each animal was 20 g.<br><br>
Distribution in groups<br>
10 TSH and 10 TOVX : sham-operated and oophorectomised rats<br>
receiving a standard control diet for 3 months<br>
10 Hp SH et 10 Hp OVX : sham-operated and oophorectomised rats receiving a standard control diet supplemented with hesperidin (0.5%) for 3 months<br>
B. RESULTS<br>
B. 1 Change in weight and body composition<br>
The results are presented in Figure 1. The values are expressed as means ± SD. The rats showed a standard change in weight. Although at the end of the experimental period the body weight (g) of the OVX animals was significantly higher than that of the sham-operated animals [T SH : 326.6 ± 9.4; T OVX : 363.3 ± 7 ; Hp SH : 335.4 ± 15.4 ; Hp OVX: 406.3 ± 12.7], no significant difference concerning the body composition (% fat mass with respect to total body weight) was observed between the groups.<br>
B.2 Uterine weight<br>
The uterine weight was evaluated in order to validate the castration. The oophorectomy effectively induced an atrophy of this organ (mg), by comparison with SH (p

B.3 Femoral biomechanics<br>
The diameter and length (mm) of the femurs were not significantly modified by the treatment.<br>
Table 2 : Femoral resistance to rupture :<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Although oophorectomy did not significantly diminished the femoral resistance to rupture (N), the oophorectomised rats receiving a diet supplemented with hesperidin show a tendency to improve this parameter.<br>
B.3 Densitometry<br>
The densities are expressed in g/cm2.<br>
Table 3 : Total femoral density (T-BMD)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Oophorectomy induces a significant diminution of the total femoral density of the rats receiving the control diet compared to the sham-operated animals. On the other hand, the consumption of hesperidin completely prevents this demineralisation and, in addition, significantly improves this parameter in the SH.<br>
Metaphyseal femoral density (M-BMD) (figure 2)<br>
The results relating to the whole femur are also confirmed at the metaphyseal zone essentially constituted of trabecular bone. The improvement of the mineralisation in the non-castrated animals which<br><br>
consumed the molecule was also demonstrated (by comparison with the TSH).<br>
Diaphyseal femoral density (M-BMD):<br>
The diaphyseal zone is constituted of cortical bone.<br>

The consumption of hesperidin significantly improves (p
B.4 Bone biomarkers<br>
Urinary excretion of desoxypyridinoline (figure 3)<br>
Oophorectomy induces a significant increase of bone resorption (p
vs   T SH).  This phenomenon  is prevented by the consumption of<br>
hesperidin by the OVX rats. Similarly, in the Hp SH rats, the urinary<br>
excretion of DPD is significantly diminished in comparison with the T SH.<br>
Plasma levels of osteocalcin (figure 4)<br>
The consumption of hesperidin stimulates bone accretion<br>
(Hp SH vs T SH ; Hp OVX vs T OVX; p
Circulating levels of hesperetin<br>
Hesperidin is, in fact, a glycoside of hesperetin (hesperetin-7-rhamnoglucoside). The mean plasma level of aglycone found in the OVX rats, like the SH, receiving the supplementary diets of hesperidin was 12.53 ± 2.48 µM. On the other hand, no trace of hesperetin was detected in the rats receiving the control diet.<br><br>
Conclusion of Example 1<br>
The set of results for this series of experiments indicates that hesperidin is capable of preventing bone loss following estrogen deficiency in the oophorectomised rate. This effect would seem to be due to a diminution of bone resorption coupied to an acceleration of osteoblast activity. A beneficial effect of this flavanone is even observed in intact (sham-operated) rats which thus have a hormonal status and normal bone metabolism.<br>
Example 2 : Effect of hesperetin on hPOB-tert cells (immortalised line of osteoblasts of human periosteum. Darimont et al.. 2002).<br>
We have tested three concentrations of hesperetin in the hPOB culture medium seeded to confluence : 1, 10 and 50 µM. Furthermore, these media lacked osteoblast differentiation factors (Vitamin D3 and dexamethasone). The control contained 0.1% DMSO (hesperetin being dissolved in the DMSO). The cells were incubated in these media for 35 days. The alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteoblast differentiation, was measured on a ceil lysate by using a commercial kit (Sigma No 247). The cells had been harvested at 0, 4, 8 and 12 days of incubation. The calcium content of the cells, the mineralisation marker, was quantified on a cell lysate after 21 days of incubation in the different media, with the aid of a commercial kit (Sigma No587).<br>
RESULTS<br>
ALP activity<br>
Alkaline phosphatase activity, hence osteoblast differentiation, is stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by the presence of hesperetin in the medium. The doses 10 and 50 µM increase this process from the 4th day of experimentation onwards, a plateau being attained on the 8th day of incubation. While 50µM hesperetin proves to be the most efficacious,<br><br>
a concentration of 1 µM, on the other hand, lacks effect in comparison to the untreated cells.<br>
Accumulation of calcium in the ceils :<br>
After 21 days of incubation only the 50 µM of hesperetin seems to stimulate calcium deposition, by comparison with the calcium content in the control cells (0.1% DMSO).<br>
Example 3 : Effect of hesperidin on bone metabolism in the six months' old oophorectomised rat<br>
A. Material and Methods<br>
The experiments were performed on 48 six months' old female Wistar rats : 24 oophorectomised (OVX) and 24 sham-operated (SH).<br>
The animals were housed in individual cages at a controlled temperature of 21 ± 1ºC, according to a day-night cycle of 12h-12h.<br>
After the surgical operation on DO, the animals were given seven days to accustom themselves to their surroundings. At the end of this period of adaptation, the rodents were distributed on the basis of weight parameters in 4 homogeneous groups and received daily for 72 days 22 g of the following diets :<br>
&gt;	group SH : 12 sham-operated rats fed with the control diet<br>
&gt;	group OVX : 12 oophorectomised rats which received the control diet<br>
&gt;	group SH Hp : 12 sham-operated rats fed with the hesperidin diet<br>
&gt;	group OVX Hp : 12 oophorectomised rats which received the hesperidin diet<br>
When sacrificed (D90), the animais were anesthetised by an intraperitoneal injection of chloraf {Fluka: 8% solution; 0.4 ml/100 g live weight). Blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta. The uterus was weighed.<br>
The femurs were extracted and adjacent soft tissues were removed, then the femurs were stored in 80% ethanol for the determination of bone density.<br><br>
B. RESULTS<br>
1. Foodstuff consumption<br>
The quantity of foodstuff distributed was calculated on the basis of the level of the lowest mean consumption the week preceding the experiment (group SH)<br>
The results are presented in Figure 7.<br>
The results in Figure 7 show that no significant difference was observed at the ievel of the feeding of the animals of the different groups.<br>
2.	Weight change<br>
The results of weight change are presented in Figure 8.<br>
The weight profile of the animals of all the groups show a similar pattern of change, namely an increase between the start and the end of the experiment, irrespective of the group considered.<br>
3.	Body composition<br>
The results of the measurement of body composition are presented in Figure 9.<br>
The body composition of the animals in the different groups was not significantly modified, irrespective of the treatment undergone by the individuals.<br>
4.	Uterine weight<br>
The results are presented in Figure 10.<br>
Uterine atrophy following ovarian ablation is not prevented by the consumption of hesperidin.<br>
The results presented in Figure 10 thus show that hesperidin lacks a uterotropic effect<br>
5.	Bone mineral density<br>
The results of the measurement of bone mineral density are presented in the Figures 11, 12 and 13. The results of the measurement of the total femoral mineral density are presented in Figure 11. The<br><br>
results of the measurement of the mineral density of the femoral proximal metaphysis are presented in Figure 12. The results of the measurement of the femoral diaphyseal mineral density are presented in Figure 13.<br>
Castration results in a demineralisation of the femur, demonstrated by a reduced total bone mineral density (g/cm2). This process is prevented (at least partially) by the consumption of hesperidin. A similar profile is demonstrated at the trabecular level (Fig. 12), as well as in the cortical bone (Fig. 13).<br>
6. Biomechanical properties<br>
The mechanical properties of the femur of the individuals of the different groups of animals were analysed. The results are presented in Figure 14.<br>
The biomechanical properties of the femur have deteriorated as a result of the estrogen deficiency. The consumption of hesperidin (OVX Hp) made it possible to preserve them, and even improve them in the intact animals.<br>
In conclusion, the results for Example 3 show that hesperidin possesses an osteoprotective activity in an experimental model of bone loss linked to ageing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
