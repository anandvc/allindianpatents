Electrical switchgear assembly<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to an electrical switchgear<br>
assembly in accordance with the precharacterizing<br>
clause of claim 1.<br>
Electrical switchgear assemblies have been disclosed<br>
which comprise one or more switchpanels. In this case,<br>
a busbar or a busbar arrangement, which usually runs<br>
horizontally and which is adjoined by distribution<br>
busbars, which distribute the electrical energy<br>
provided by the busbars to the individual devices,<br>
withdrawable parts or the like within the switchpanel,<br>
is located in each switchpanel.<br>
Power cables run from the individual devices to the<br>
downstream loads; furthermore, control and signal<br>
cables are provided, with which electrical signals are<br>
transmitted to switching devices located within the<br>
switchpanel, as well as further signal cables, with<br>
which signals originating from the individual switching<br>
devices and control devices are transmitted to a<br>
control center. These control and signal cables can<br>
also be in the form of a bus line.<br>
In the known switchgear assemblies, in addition to the<br>
device area, in which the switching devices and control<br>
devices are located, a cable area is provided, in which<br>
both the power cables and the control and signal cables<br>
are laid. This results in problems in cable routing for<br>
power and control cables, and furthermore technically<br>
complex modifications to the embodiment known to date<br>
are necessary for meeting certain standards (Form 4<br>
b/7) .<br><br>
WO 2006/105878	PCT/EP2006/002761<br>
- 2 -<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an electrical<br>
switchgear assembly having at least one switchpanel, in<br>
which the cable routing of power and control cables is<br>
simplified without technically complex modifications<br>
being necessary.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by<br>
the features of claim 1.<br>
According to the invention, the cable area for the<br>
control and signal cables (referred to as the control<br>
cable area below for short) is arranged on one side of<br>
the switchpanel and the cable area for the power cables<br>
(referred to as the power cable area below for short)<br>
is arranged on the other side of the switchpanel.<br>
Optimum isolation of the control cable area and the<br>
power cable area is therefore produced; the isolation<br>
takes place via the device area.<br>
If two switchpanels or more are arranged next to one<br>
another, the control cable area of one switchpanel<br>
adjoins the power cable area of the other switchpanel;<br>
the two initially form a common cable area, in which<br>
the individual cables can then be laid isolated from<br>
one another. Once the fitting and laying of the cables<br>
is complete, the control and power cable areas lying<br>
next to one another are isolated from one another by<br>
means of an insertable partition wall, with the result<br>
that, on the one hand, mutual influencing does not take<br>
place, which naturally also applies to the control and<br>
power cable areas of a switchpanel. The partition wall<br>
which is inserted after routing and laying of the<br>
cables is then the lateral boundary wall of a<br>
switchpanel.<br><br>
WO 2006/105878	PCT/EP2006/002761<br>
- 3 -<br>
Further advantageous configurations and improvements of<br>
the invention are described in the further dependent<br>
claims.<br>
The invention as well as further advantageous<br>
configurations and improvements of the invention and<br>
further advantages will be explained and described in<br>
more detail with reference to the drawing, which<br>
illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the invention<br>
and in which:<br>
the single figure shows a perspective view of a<br>
switchgear assembly, in a<br>
schematic illustration.<br>
The switchgear assembly has a first switchpanel 10, to<br>
which a second switchpanel 11, which is only partially<br>
illustrated, is connected. A device area 12, in which<br>
the switching devices and control devices are<br>
accommodated which can be installed in differently<br>
sized withdrawable parts 12a, 12b, is located in the<br>
switchpanel 10. Positioned adjacent, behind the device<br>
area 12, isolated by a partition wall 13, is a<br>
distribution busbar area 14, in which vertically<br>
running distribution busbars are arranged which are<br>
electrically conductively connected to busbars 15,<br>
which are accommodated in a busbar area 16. Outgoing<br>
cables (not illustrated) and power cables are laid from<br>
the devices 12 into a power cable area 17, from where<br>
they are led to motors and other loads arranged behind<br>
the switchpanel. This cable area 17 is to the right of<br>
the device area 12 of the switchpanel 10. To the left<br>
of this device area 12 there is a cable-routing area<br>
18, in which signal cables and control cables as well<br>
as a bus line are accommodated, with which control<br>
signals and, for example, state signals are fed to the<br>
devices in the individual withdrawable parts.<br><br>
WO 2006/105878	PCT/EP2006/002761<br>
- 4 -<br>
If two switchpanels 10 and 11 are arranged next to one<br>
another, the power cable area 17' of the switchpanel 11<br>
is next to the control cable area 18 of the switchpanel<br>
10; in order to install and lay the power and control<br>
cables, it is possible, as is the case here, for the<br>
two cable areas 17' and 18 to form a single area, which<br>
means a simplification of the installation for the<br>
laying process; once laying of the cables is complete,<br>
a partition wall 19 can be inserted between the power<br>
cable area 17' and the control cable area 18, as a<br>
result of which isolation of the two cable areas is<br>
achieved.<br>
It is naturally also possible to pass the power cables<br>
out of the switchpanel through the rear wall.<br>
The partition wall therefore provides for mechanical<br>
and electrical isolation of the power and control cable<br>
areas.<br><br>
