				<td>DETOXIFIZYME WITH ACTIVITY OF TRANSFORMING AFLATOXIN AND THE GENE ENCODES THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a detoxifizyme with the activity of transforming aflatoxin and the gene encodes thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Aflatoxins, a group of toxic mycotoxins, including Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), Aflatoxin G1 (G1) etc., are produced by many species of Aspergilus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals and humans. Aflatoxins are widely present in grain, feed, and food, and the harmful effects to human beings are: (1) direct poisoning by consumption of untreated aflatoxins contaminated food; (2) poisoning by consumption of poultry, milk, etc. indirectly from untreated aflatoxins contaminated feed; (3) waste and disposal of crops or nuts contaminated with aflatoxins.<br>
Because of these harmful effects, detoxification of aflatoxins has been studied for years. Some methods of transforming aflatoxins already exist, for instance: (1) Ammonization method: this method is used for wet feed. Because of the large amount of residual ammonia, it is banned in food processing by FDA. The application on feed is also limited. (2) NaOH method (for vegetable oil): due to high equipment investment, oil consumption, and cost, the method is no longer in use (3) White soil adsorption method: no longer in use because of higher labor cost, pollution etc. (4) Extraction method (for peanut powder, cotton seed, etc): it isn't widely used because of the high cost associated with extracting, recovering the solvent. (5) Heat method (268°C): cost for heating and lose of flavor and nutrients make it less practical. (6) Biological method: bacteria or immobilized bacteria are used to resolve aflatoxins. Bacteria can destroy the nutrients of food, and the products and their toxicities are not well understood. Thus this application is limited to only a few types of feed and peanut oil. (7) Ultraviolet method: strong ultraviolet oxidation used to destroy aflatoxins is not consistent and high energy consuming. (8) Ultra-filtration method: it isn't practical due to high equipment cost and rigorous technical requirement. (9) Enzyme method: clone of liver cytochrome oxidase P450 in E.coli was used to transform aflatoxins (Brown DW, etc. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. USA. 1996).<br>
To summarize, the chemical or physical methods to transform aflatoxins often require harsh conditions, but results in lower value for the treated grain, feed, and food. These methods are often not efficient and economical, thus difficult for large scale applications. P450 enzyme method does promote the metabolism of aflatoxins, but it may also lead to higher toxicity of AFB1 to human. Because of the specificities and high efficiencies of enzymes, more research is focused on enzymes that can transform aflatoxins directly.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to a detoxifizyme that can transform aflatoxins and gene encoding of the enzyme.<br>
This enzyme with AFB, transforming activity can be prepared from purification of crude enzyme produced from selected cells. The AFBt transforming protein can also be produced by DMA recombinant techniques. This new active protein is named Aflatoxin-detoxifizyme (ADTZ).<br>
The primers specific to the ADTZ gene can be obtained from purification and sequencing. The gene encoding of ADTZ can be cloned from the total RNA of Armillariella tabescens. The gene is a new gene that is never reported before. The recombinant protein can be expressed and purified from different expression systems, Pichia pastoris expression system, for example, using genetic engineering methods. The selected fungus, Armillariella tabescens, comes from China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC).<br>
Purification of ADTZ: break the fungus cell firstly, then obtain the crude protein by (NH4)2S04 precipitation method. ADTZ N-terminal peptide amino acid sequence can be obtained from mass spectrometry analysis of the target peak.<br>
Purification of ADTZ: At first we and precipitates proteins by the method of ammonium sulphate precipitate method. Secondly, we receive the purpose peak from the end short peptide of the order of amino acid.<br>
This invention relates to the extraction of total RNA of Armillariella tabescens. Throuth PCR and SMART RACE of the primers derived from the sequence of ADTZ N-terminal peptide amino acid sequence, ADTZ gene encoding can be obtained, its length is about 2.3 kb. The sequence contains a complete open reading frame, 3' and 5' non-translating regions. The ADTZ encoding cDNA contains 2088 base pairs. ADTZ mature peptide contains 695 amino acids, molecular weight: 73-77kDa (SDS-PAGE), pi: 5.3-6.8 (isoelectric focusing electrophoresis). Amino acids and DNA sequences are depicted in the Sequence Listing (SEQ ID No.1 and SEQ ID No.2). The protein claimed in the invention should be understood to include the molecular produced by elimination, substitution, modify and addition etc.<br>
This invention provides the recombinant expression carrier which comprises said gene, and the transformant obtained by a host cell transformed with said recombinant expression carrier. This invention further procides the method for the preparation of said detoxifizyme, which comprises: cultivating said transformant, and recovering the expressed detoxifizyme.<br>
This invention relates to a pair of primers to amplify the gene encoding of ADTZ mature peptide from cDNA of Armillariella tabescenes. The DNA can be cloned to eukaryotic integration type expression vectors, such as pHIL-S1. Expression plasmid pHIL-S1-ADTZ can be thus constructed from transformation of recombinant expression vector in Pichia pastoris GS115. This recombinant expression vector uses AOX as promoter. Experiments on time of cultivation and induction, lead to over 25% expression of ADTZ in total protein in soluble state.<br>
The invention relates to eukaryotic expression systems, including endocytic vectors (such as PA0815, PPIC3K, PPICZ, PHW010, PGAPZ), or excretion vectors (such as PPIC9K, PPICZa,<br><br>
PGAPZa, or other commercial vectors). For eukaryotic expression stains, Pichia pastoris KM71, MC100-3, SMD1168, SMD1165, SMD1163 can also be used as host cells.<br>
The invention relates to prokaryotic expression systems. Different expression vectors can be used, such as pET, pUCH33, or similar commercial vectors. For prokaryotic expression stains, E.coli BL21, E.coli JM109 can be used as host cells.<br>
Replication of expression vectors can be achieved following Sambrook's manual (Sambrook, et al. 2002, molecular cloning, Cold Spring Laboratory Press. USA). Preparation and transformation of E.coli DH5a may be achieved using calcium chloride protocol. Cell culture can be prepared using ampicillin (100 ug/ml) in LB media, and plasmid extracted using alkaline method.<br>
This invention relates to the optimal conditions to purify recombinant ADTZ. The expression culture can be first precipitated with (NH4)2S04. The resultant crude enzyme can be further purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and metal-chelating affinity chromatography to give recombinant ADTZ, which purity is greater than 95%.<br>
The invention provides the use of said detoxifizyme with activity of transforming aflatoxin for the manufacturing of feed or food. ADTZ can be used as a detoxification additive for feed, and immobilized ADTZ can be use in detoxification of peanut oil.<br>
The invention provides the use of said detoxifizyme with activity of transforming aflatoxin for the preparation of a medicament for preventing or treating tumor or cancer. ADTZ can be used in the prevention and treatment of aflatoxin induced tumors.<br>
The invention relates to methods of separation and sequencing of ADTZ gene in the first time. The gene encoding of ADTZ can be cloned by Armillariella tabescenes to expression vector to form recombinant transformant. The recombinant protein ADTZ can be expressed using this transformant. Recombinant ADTZ has similar activity in transforming AFB, as natural ADTZ from activity analysis. Recombinant ADTZ also significantly reduces mutagenic effects of AFB,. It has great potential in feed, food and pharmaceutical industries.<br>

Column was washed with 0.1 N HCl until AD -0, and washed again with 1N NaCl, and equilibrated with initial buffer overnight. The process was repeated, and active fractions were collected.<br>
1.3.2.3.	Activity testing using ELISA<br>
AFB, was treated with collected protein fractions; the remaining AFB1 was measured using ELISA method. The protein fractions were heated to 100°C for 10 min to prepare deactivated enzyme solutions as controls. The fractions that can lower the AFB, level are active fractions. Detail as following: (1)        Sample preparation<br>
Deactivated enzyme test mixture: AFB, (200 ul, 2.5 ng/ml in methanol) + deactivated enzyme solution (200 pi, 1.2 mg/ml).<br>
Active enzyme test mixture: AFB1 (200 ul, 2.5 ng/ml in methanol) + active enzyme solution (200 Ml, 1.2 mg/ml).<br>

Example 2<br>
Activity Measurement of purified ADTZ 2.1. Test of ADTZ activity in transforming AFB,<br>
To measure the activity of purified ADTZ, thin layer chromatography was used for the testing of remaining AFB1 after treatment with ADTZ. Detail follows: 2.1.1.   ADTZ enzyme mixture<br>
AFB1 solution (1 Ml, 0-5 MS/M^ methanol) (Alexis Biochemical's Inc., Switzerland) in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube was evaporated under nitrogen gas. Enzyme solution (300 \i(, 0.1 mg/ml), MgS04 (0.5 \i() and PEG 200 (10 pi) were added to the tube and mixed thoroughly. The<br><br>
mixture reacted in a water bath for 1 h at 30°C, and then added AFB, 0.5 ul per hour until the total amount of AFB, was 2ug. After addition, the mixture reacted for another 2 h.<br>
2.1.2.	Control mixtures<br>
Control 1: AFB, solution 1 ul in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube was evaporated under nitrogen gas. Deactivated enzyme solution 300 ul, deactivation at 100°C for 5 min, MgS04 0.5 ul and PEG 200 10 ul were added to the tube and mixed thoroughly. Control 2: AFB, solution 1 pi in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube was evaporated under nitrogen gas. PBS buffer solution 300 pi (0.1 M, pH 6.6), MgS040.5 ul and PEG 200 10 pi were added to the tube and mixed thoroughly. The two control mixtures were allowed to re-act the same manner as the enzyme mixture.<br>
The enzyme mixture and control mixtures were extracted with 2 volumes CHC13 twice. CHC13 extract was evaporated under nitrogen gas at 45°C. The crude mixtures were re-dissolved in methanol 1 ml to get the enzyme sample and two control samples for TLC.<br>
2.1.3.	TLC measurement<br>
TLC plates (10 x 10 cm, 60 A, Whatman, United States) were freshly activated at 100°C for 2 h. Samples were spotted on the plates 1 cm apart, and 1 cm from the edge from left to right, 1st: AFB, (10 ul, 25 ug/ml in CHC13), 2nd, 3rd: control 2 (10 pi), 4th: control 1(10 ul), 5th: enzyme mixture (10 ul), 6th: AFB, (10 ul, 25 ug/ml in CHC13). The plate was developed in anhydrous ether, visualized with UV light (A 365 nm), and photographed (result as shown in Fig. 2). There is almost no shift among AFB1 standards (1st and 6th spots), deactivated enzyme mixture control (4th) and PBS buffer controls (2nd and 3rd), but significant shift for ADTZ enzyme mixture (product Rf = 0.95). The product following ADTZ treatment is a lot less polar than AFB,, indicating the AFB, transforming activity of purified ADTZ.<br>
2.2.	The bioactivity of ADTZ in transforming AFB,<br>
Microorganism reversal mutation assays (Ames assays) were conducted as following:<br>
2.2.1.	Test the bacterial strains<br>
Histidine Auxotroph Salmonella Typhimurium strain TA98 was stored at -85°C. Genotype identification and spontaneous reversal mutation quantity determination were conducted before testing to ensure the strain meet the experiment requirement.<br>
2.2.2.	Prepa ration of liver S9<br>
(a)	SD rat induction: SD rats were quarantined for one week to make sure they<br>
were healthy.   A polychlorinated biphenyl corn oil suspension was administered via stomach<br>
tube to rats (500 mg/kg).  On the fifth day, after 12h of starvation, the animals were<br>
decapitated.<br>
(b)	Liver S9 preparation: livers were collected, weighted, and perfused in situ with<br>
ice cold sterile KCl (0.15 M), and homogenated in a homogenizer. Followed by centrifugation at<br>
9000 g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected, tested and stored at -85°C.<br>
2.2.3.	Preparation of S9 mix<br>
The following solutions: A, B and C were mixed with S9, and stored at 4°C (to be used within 4 h).<br>
A: (0.2 M, coenzyme II, sterilized by filtration) 0.2 ml.<br><br>
B: (0.2 M, glucose 6-phosphate, sterilized by filtration) 0.25 ml C: (0.4 M MgCl2 20 ml + 1 .65 M KCl, 20 ml  + 0.2 mol/L phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 500 ml + distilled water, 313 ml, mixed and sterilized by filtration) 8.55 ml. S9:  1.00ml.<br>
2.2.4.	Preparation of test mixtures<br>
In a 30 ml test sample, cone, of ADTZ was 0.2mg/ml, AFB, 0.2ng/ml, pH=6.0. The mixture reacted at 28 °C for 120 min, then extracted with CHC13 in the same volume for three times. The pooled CHC13 extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure at 40" C. The extraction crude was dissolved in 6.75 ml DMSO (3.75 ml and 3 ml) as enzyme test mixture. Similarly, deactivated ADTZ (pre-treated with CHC13) was used to prepare deactivated enzyme control mixture, and buffer solution was used to prepare buffer control mixture. All these samples were kept at -15°C.<br>
2.2.5.	Reverse mutation assay (Ames assay)<br>
The test mixtures in DMSO, S9 mix and Salmonella Typhimurium TA98 cell culture were added to the top stratum soft agar medium, mixed thoroughly, and poured onto the minimum defined Vogel selective medium at 40° C. The plates were incubated for 72 h at 37" C, and mutant colonies in every plate were calculated.<br>
Each sample was tested with positive control and negative control, and repeated once. The result of each sample was get from the mean value of six groups of two tests. Data were reported in number of mutant colonies, mutation rate (MR = number of mutant colonies in sample/ number of mutant colonies in negative control) and inhibition ratio ( = {1-( number of mutant colonies in sample- number of mutant colonies in negative control)/ (number of mutant colonies in AFB! control sample- number of mutant colonies in negative control)} x 100%<br>
2.2.6. Data evaluation criteria<br>
Test samples are considered Ames positive when:<br>
a), solvent controls are in normal range;<br>
b). test samples show positive at three different cone. (MR &gt;_ 2).<br>
2.2.7.Result<br>

be used within 30 min.<br>
9.4.	Spheroplast transformation of Pichia pastoris GS115<br>
9.4.1.	Aliquots of 100 ul each of Pichia pastoris GS115 spheroplasts were transferred to<br>
three sterile centrifuge tubes A, B and C.<br>
9.4.2.	Tube A (no DNA) negative control, tube B (added 30 ul linearized vector pHIL-S1),<br>
tube C (added 30 ul linearized recombinant plasmid pSA, incubated for 10 min at room<br>
temperature). 3 ml of PEG/CaT was prepared at the same time.<br>
9.4.3.	Aliquots of 1 ml each of PEG/CaT were added to tube A, B and C, mixed gently<br>
and incubated for 10 min at room temperature.<br>
9.4.4.	The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 750 xg for 5 min. The supernatant<br>
was discarded.<br>
9.4.5.	The cell pellets were re-suspended in 150 ul SOS, incubated for 20 min at room<br>
temperature.<br>
9.4.6.	Aliquots of 850 ul 1M Sorbitol solution each were added to the tubes.<br>
9.4.7. The entire transformations were plated on RD solid incubation plates using a sterile spreader (200ul/plate). The plates were incubated at 28-30°C. Transformants appeared between 4-6 days.<br>
9.5.	Selection of Mut* transformants<br>
9.5.1.	Using a sterile toothpick, His+ transformants were patched on both MM and MD<br>
plates, the strains GS115/His+Muts Albumin and GS115/His* Mut* B-gal were also patched on the<br>
plates as controls.<br>
9.5.2.	Plates were incubated at 28-30/C for 2 days.<br>
9.5.3.	After two days, scored the plates. Mut* strains will grow normally on both plates,<br>
while Muts will grow normally only on the MD plate but little or no growth on MM plate.<br>
9.6.	Induced expression of the recombinant strains<br>
9.6.1.	Inoculated a single colony of His"Mut+ transformant in 25 ml BMG in a 250 ml<br>
baffled flask. Grew at 28-30°C in a shaking incubator (250-300 rpm) until the culture reached<br>
OD600= 2-6 (-16-18 h).<br>
9.6.2.	Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500-3000 xg for 5 min at room<br>
temperature. Supernatant was decanted and cell pellet was re-suspended in BMM to an OD600of<br>
1.0 (~100-200ml BMM). The culture was placed in a 1-litter baffled flask and returned to<br>
incubator to continue growth at 250-300 rpm at 28-30°C.<br>
9.6.3.	100 % methanol was added to a final concentration of 0.5 % to maintain inducted<br>
expression.<br>
9.6.4.	After 96h, the expression culture was centrifuged for 2-3 min, supernatant was<br>
transferred to a separate tube and stored at -SOT for purification of expression product.<br>
The supernatant of the culture after 96h induction was analyzed. Total mount of protein was 0.23 mg/ml. The molecular weight of the protein product is consistent with the predicted value of 76.95 kDa by BioEdit (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html).<br>
Example 10 Purification of Recombinant ADTZ<br>
The recombinant expression culture was precipitated with 70% saturation (NH^SC^, producing crude enzyme as precipitate. The crude enzyme was dissolved in equal volume of PBS, centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded on a hydrophobic Phenyl Sepharose column; active product was collected from gradient elution. The product was subjected to dialysis desalination and concentrated after equilibration with PBS. The concentrated crude enzyme solution was then purified by metal chelating affinity chromatography using Chelating Sepharose column. The active peak was eluted using pH gradient pH7.5-6.0 and fraction collected. Details follow:<br>
10.1.      Crude enzyme from (NH4)2S04 precipitation<br>
(NH4)2S04 powder was added to the recombinant expression culture until 40 % saturation followed by centrifugation at 10000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was added more<br>
(NH4)2S04 until 70 % saturation. Crude enzyme was obtained from centrifugation at 10000 g for 20minat4°C.<br>
10.2.	Hydrophobic interaction chromatography<br>
ADTZ crude enzyme was dissolved in equal volume of 0.02 M PBS (pH 6.0). and centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatant was loaded on a Phenyl Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech. Inc., United States) which had been washed to background using 0.02M PBS + 30% saturation (NH4)2S04 , pH 6.0. Gradient elution with A (0.02M PBS + 10% saturation (NH4)2S04 , pH 6.0 ) and B (0.02 M PBS, pH 6.0) gave an active product. The product was subjected to dialysis desalination and concentrated after equilibration with F solution (0.02 M PBS + 5 M NaCl, pH 7.5) to 1 mg/ml.<br>
10.3.	Metal chelating affinity chromatography<br>
Chelating Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech. Inc., United States) was saturated with 0.2 M CuCl2, and then equilibrated with water and F solution (0.02 M PBS + 5 M NaCl, pH 7.5). The pooled fractions from hydrophobic interaction chromatography were loaded and purified with non-linear pH gradient using buffer G (0.02 M PBS + 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5-6.0, non-linear gradient incremented by 0.5 pH unit). The product peak was collected, and analyzed using SDS-PAGE.<br>
Conclusion: 58 mg purified recombinant ADTZ was obtained from I liter expression culture, purity was greater than 95%.<br>
Example 11<br>
Test of recombinant ADTZ activity<br>
Recombinant ADTZ activity was test following protocols in example 2.1. Test mixtures: (1) Enzyme mixture: 1 ul AFB, solution (0.5 ug/pl in MeOH, evaporated under nitrogen) + recombinant ADTZ enzyme solution (0.1 mg/ml, 300 ul) + 0.5 ul MgS04 + 10 ul PEG200; (2) Deactivated enzyme mixture: 1 ul AFB, solution (0.5 ug/ul in MeOH, evaporated under nitrogen) + deactivated recombinant ADTZ enzyme solution (0.1 mg/ml, 300 ul, preheated at 100°C for 5 min) + 0.5 ul MgS04 + 10 ul PEG200; (3) control mixture: 1 ul AFB, solution (0.5 ug/ul in MeOH, evaporated under nitrogen) + 300 [i( PBS buffer + 0.5 ul MgS04 + 10 ul PEG200. The test mixtures were mixed thoroughly, reacted for 1 h at 30°C, AFB, (0.5 ul x 2) was added every hour (total AFB1: 2 ug). After the addition, the reactions continued for 6 more hours. After the reaction, TLC (as described in example 1) showed new product with R/ -1 (= 0.93) for recombinant ADTZ, very similar to natural ADTZ., indicting activity of recombinant ADTZ in transforming AFB,. Result was shown in Fig. 13.<br>
Example 12<br>
Bioactivity of Recombinant ADTZ in Detoxifying AFBi The bioactivity of recombinant ADTZ was tested following protocols in example 2.2, where recombinant ADTZ was used instead of natural ADTZ. The number of mutant colonies of active recombinant ADTZ test sample is very similar to the negative control (DMSO control sample) (MR 
(MR &gt; 2), and are very close to the positive control (AFBi control sample). These results demonstrate the bioactivity of recombinant ADTZ. The results are shown in the following table.<br><br>
