4-5,6- and 7-lndole derivatives useful for the treatment of CNS disorders Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel class of 4-, 5-, 6- and 7-indole derivatives having aftinity for the dopamine D4 receptor. The compounds are useful in the treatment of certain psychiatric and neurologic disorders, in particular psychoses.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
Dopamine D4 receptors belong to the dopamine D2 subfamily of receptors, which is considered to be responsible for the antipsychotic effects of neuroleptics. The side effects of neuroleptic drugs which primarily exert their effect via antagonism of D2 receptors are known to be due to D2 receptor antagonism in the striatal regions of the brain. However, dopamine D4 receptors are primarily located in areas of the brain other than striatum, suggesting that selective antagonists of the dopamine D4 receptor will be devoid of extrapyramidal side effects. This is illustrated by the antipsychotic clozapine which exerts higher affmity for D4 than D2 receptors and is lacking extrapyramidal side effects (Van Tol et al. Nature 1991, 350, 610; Hadley Medicinal Research Reviews 1996, 16, 507-526, and Sanner Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1998, S, 383-393).<br>
A number of D4 ligands which were postulated to be selective D4 receptor antagonists (L-745,879 and U-101958) have been shown to posses antipsychotic potential (Ivlansbach et al. Psychophaiinacology 1998, 135, 194-200). However, recently it has been reported that these compounds are partial D4 receptor agonists in various in vitro efficacy assays (Gazi et al. Br. J. Pharmnacol 1998,124, 889-896 and Gazi et al. Br, J. Phannacol 1999,128, 613-620). Furthermore, it was shown that clozapine, which is an effective antipsychotic is a silent D4 antagonist (Gazi et ah BK J. Pharmacol 1999,128, 613-620).<br>
Consequently, D4 ligands, which are partial D4 receptor agonists or antagonists, may have beneficial effects against psychoses.<br><br>
Dopamine D4 antagonists may also be useful for the treatment of cognitive deficits (Jentsch at al Psychophannacology 1999, 142, 78-84).<br>
It has also been suggested that selective dopamine D4 antagonists may be useful to reduce dyskinesia occurring as a result of the treatment of Parkinson's disease with L-dopa (Tahar et al. Eur. J. PhawiacoL 2000, 399, 1S3-186).<br>
Furthermore, evidence for a genetic association between the "primarily inattentive" subtype of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a tandem duplication polymorphism in the gene encoding the dopamine D4 receptor has been published (McCracken et al. Mol. Psychiat. 2000, 5, 531-536). This clearly indicates a link between the dopamine D4 receptor and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and ligands affecting this receptor may be useful for the treatment of this particular disorder<br>
Accordingly, dopamirre D4 receptor ligands are potential drugs for the treatment of psychoses, the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, cognitive deficits, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyskinesia resulting from treatment of Parkinson's disease with L-Dopa.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the invention are considered usefiil in the treatment of positive symptoms of schizophrenia without inducing extrapyramidal side effects.<br>
A number of dopamine D4 ligands which can be described by the general formula<br><br>
wherein Het is 3-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 3-indazolyl, 2-indoIyl, 3-indolyl, 3-ben2ofuranyl, imidazo[l,2-a]pyridinyl, 3-furo[2,3-b]pyridinyl and 3-benzofiiranyl and Ar is optionally substituted phenyl or heteroaryl, have been described in WO 94/20459,<br><br>
wo 94/20497, WO 94/22839, WO 94/21630, WO 94/24105, WO 99/09025, WO 95/29911, WO 96/25414, US 5.700.802 and J. Med. Chein. 1996, 39(19), 1941-2.<br><br>
wherein Ar is optionally substituted phenyl or thienyl, n is 2-4 and Ind is optionally substituted 4-indolyL The compounds are said to inhibit binding of dopamin agonists and -antagonists to striatal receptors and to have sedative, tranquilizing, antidepressivc neuroleptic, analgetic and antihypertensive effect. The application does not present any biological test results.<br><br>
wherein Ar is 2-inethoxyphenyI or 1-napthyl, n is 2-4 and R is various heterocyclic rings, e.g. 5-oxindole. The compounds are said to have neuroleptic activity, and data showing the ability of the compounds to bind to dopamine D2 receptors are presented in the application.<br>

isoquinolyl, indolyl, etc. Notably n is 1 or 2.   The comounds are said to be useful for the<br>
treatment of psychoses and the mechanism primarily via modulation of the<br>

Experimental Section<br>
Melting points were determined on a Biichi SMP-20 apparatus and are uncorrected. Analytical LC-MS data were obtained on a PE Sciex API 150EX instrument equipped with lonSpray source and Shimadzu LC-8A/SLC-10A LC system. The LC conditions (CIS column 4.6 x 30 mm with a particle size of 3.5 µm) were linear gradient elution with water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (90:10:0.05) to water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (10:90:0.03) in 4 min at 2 mL/min. Purity was determined by integration of the UV trace (254 nm). The retention times, Rt, are expressed in minutes. Mass spectra were obtained by an alternating scan method to give molecular weight<br><br><br>
Examples<br>
la, 5'[[4-(4'ChlorQphenyl)piperazin~l'yl]methyi]'lH-indole,<br>
Indole-5-carboxylic acid (1,62 g) was dissolved in dry THF (20 mL). Carbonyl diimidazole (1.62 g) was added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 60 min, 4-(4" chlorophenyl)piperazine (1.9 g) dissolved in dry THF (20 mL) was added in one portion and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the remaining solid was dissolved in EtOAc (400 mL), washed with 10% aqueous sodium carbonate (100 mL), 1 M acetic acid (100 ml), brine (100 mL), dried (MgS04) and evaporated in vacuo to give a white solid (2.3 g). The solid was dissolved in dry THF (40 mL) and subsequently added dropwise to a cooled solution of alane in THF (prepared by the careful addition of 0.6 g cone, sulfuric acid to a suspension of 0.47 g lithium aluminium hydride in 20 mL dry THF). The mixture-was stirred at 15 °C for 2 h, quenched by the   -addition of water (1 mL), cone. NaOH {½ mL) and water (2 mL). The white precipitate was removed by filtration and the THF evaporated in vacuo to give the product as a white solid. Recrystallisation from MeCN gave 1.8 g 5-[[4-(4-chlorophenyl)pipera2in-l-yl]methyl]indole as white crystals. Mp 175-176°C; Analysis calcd. (C19H20CIN3): C:70.04, H: 6.19, N: 12.90; found.
