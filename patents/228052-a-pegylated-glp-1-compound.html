				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to GLP-1 compounds covalently attached to one or<br>
more molecules of polyethylene glycol or a derivative thereol, and related compositions<br>
and methods useful in treating conditions or disorders benefited by lowering blood<br>
glucose, decreasing food intake, decreasing gastric or intestinal emptying, or decreasing<br>
gastric or intestinal motility.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) induces numerous biological effects such as<br>
stimulating insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, inhibiting gastric emptying,<br>
inhibiting gastric motility or intestinal motility, enhancing glucose utilization, and<br>
inducing weight loss. GLP-1 may further act to prevent the pancreatic -cell<br>
deterioration that occurs as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) progresses.<br>
A significant characteristic of GLP-1 is its ability to stimulate insulin secretion without<br>
the associated risk of hypoglycemia that is seen when using insulin therapy or some types<br>
of oral therapies that act by increasing insulin expression.<br>
The usefulness of therapy involving GLP-1 peptides has been limited by the fact<br>
that GLP-1 (1-37) is poorly active, and the two naturally occurring truncated peptides,<br>
GLP-1 (7-37)OH and GLP-1 (7-36)NH2, are rapidly cleared in vivo and have extremely<br>
short in vivo half lives. It is known that endogenously produced dipeptidyl-peptidase IV<br>
(DPP-IV) inactivates circulating GLP-1 peptides by removing the N-terminal histidine<br>
and alanine residues and is a major reason for the short in vivo half-life.<br>
Various approaches have been undertaken to extend the elimination half-life of a<br>
GLP-1 peptide or reduce clearance of the peptide from the body while maintaining a<br>
biological activity. U.S. Patent No. 5,705,483 teaches GLP-1 peptide analogs made<br>
resistant to DPP-IV degradation by the incorporation of modifications at the N-terminus<br>
of the peptide. An alternative approach for extending the half-life of GLP-1 peptides is<br>
derivatization, wherein large acyl groups that prevent DPP-IV from accessing the N-<br>
terminus of the peptide are attached to various amino acids of GLP-1 (See International<br>
Application No. PCT/DK97/00340, filed August 22, 1997 entitled "GLP-1 Derivatives,"<br><br>
which claims the benefit of DK Provisional Application Nos 0931/96 filed August 30,<br>
1996, 1259/96 filed November 8, 1996 and 1470/96 filed December 20, 1996).<br>
Particular GLP-1 analogs are described in U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos.<br>
60/346474 filed January 8, 2002, and 60/405,097 filed August 21, 2002, now<br>
International Application No. PCT/US03/058203, filed January 3, 2003, all entitled<br>
"Extended Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Analogs" and are incorporated herein in their<br>
entirety. These applications describe analogs of GLP-1 (7-37)OH wherein various amino<br>
acids, when added to the C-terminus, yield GLP-1 peptide analogs with an extended half-<br>
life and reduced clearance than that of the native molecule. Furthermore, GLP-1 analogs<br>
with increased potency are described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 60/314,573<br>
filed August 23, 2001, now International Application No. PCT/US02/21325, filed August<br>
14, 2002, entitled "Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Analogs" (incorporated herein). Exendin-4<br>
can act at the GLP-1 receptor in vitro on certain cell types including insulin-secreting<br>
cells. [Goke, et al,, J. Biol. Chem., (1993)268:19650-19655]. Particular PEGylated<br>
exendin and exendin agonist molecules are described in International Application<br>
Number PCT/US00/11814 (incorporated herein in its entirety).<br>
While various approaches have resulted in GLP-1 compounds with a longer half-<br>
life or greater potency than that of native GLP-1, additional approaches that could be used<br>
either alone or in combination with known approaches are needed to further decrease<br>
GLP-1 compound clearance and increase GLP-1 compound half-life thereby optimizing<br>
its ability to be useful as a therapeutic that can be administered a minimum number of<br>
times during a prolonged period of time. Covalent attachment of one or more molecules<br>
of polyethylene glycol to a small, biologically active peptide such as GLP-1 or exendin-4<br>
poses the risk of introducing adverse characteristics such as instability to the molecule<br>
and reduction in bioactivity so severe as to make the molecule unsuitable for use as a<br>
therapeutic. The present invention; however, is based on the finding that covalent<br>
attachment of one or more molecules of PEG to particular residues of a GLP-1 compound<br>
results in a biologically active, PEGylated GLP-1 compound with an extended half-life<br>
and reduced clearance when compared to that of native GLP-1 or Val8-GLP-1 (or native<br>
exendin-4 for modified exendin-4 peptides of the invention).<br>
The PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the invention have greater usefulness as a<br>
therapeutic as well as greater convenience of use than native GLP-1 because they retain<br><br>
all or a portion of a biological activity of native GLP-1 yet have an enhanced half-life<br>
and/or reduced clearance when compared to that of the native GLP-1 compound or to that<br>
of Val8-GLP-1(7-3 7)OH. GLP-1 (7-37) has a serum half-life of only 3 to 5 minutes.<br>
GLP-1 (7-36) amide has a time action of about 50 minutes when administered<br>
subcutaneously. Even GLP-1 analogs and derivatives that are resistant to endogenous<br>
protease cleavage, do not have half-lives long enough to avoid repeated administrations<br>
over a 24 hour period. PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the invention may have a half-<br>
life in excess of 24 hours allowing for fewer administrations of the PEGylated GLP-1<br>
compound while maintaining a high blood level of the compound over a prolonged period<br>
of time. Such PEGylated GLP-1 compounds may be used therapeutically to treat<br>
subjects with disorders including, but not limited to, diabetes, obesity, gastric and/or<br>
intestinal motility abnormalities, and gastric and/or intestinal emptying abnormalities with<br>
a particular advantage being that the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the invention<br>
require fewer doses during a 24 hour period, increasing both the convenience to a subject<br>
in need of such therapy and the likelihood of subject's compliance with dosing<br>
requirements.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a 37 amino acid peptide secreted by the L-<br>
cells of the intestine in response to food ingestion. Numerous GLP-1 analogs and<br>
derivatives have been described in the art. The present invention describes modifications<br>
to GLP-1 compounds that result in extended elimination half-life and/or reduced<br>
clearance. Incorporation of 1 or 2 Cys residues into particular amino acid sites of the<br>
peptide provides a thiol group to which a polyethylene glycol (PEG) or PEG derivative<br>
may be covalpntly attached resulting in a PEGylated GLP-1 compound. Additionally, the<br>
lysine residues or the carboxy-terminus of the GLP-1 peptides, analogs or fragments of<br>
the invention imay be covalently attached to one or more molecules of PEG or a PEG<br>
derivative resulting in a molecule with extended elimination half-life and/or reduced<br>
clearance.<br><br>
The te|rm "polypeptide" or "peptide" as used herein, is intended to indicate any<br>
structural form (e.g., primary, secondary or tertiary form) of an amino acid sequence<br>
comprising mpre than 5 amino acid residues, which may or may not be further modified<br>
(e.g., acetylated, carboxylated, phosphorylated, lipidated, or acylated). The term "native"<br>
refers to a polypeptide that has an amino acid sequence that is identical to one found in<br>
nature. The term "native" is intended to encompass allelic variants of the polypeptide in<br>
question.<br>
The tehn "amino acid" is used herein in its broadest sense, and includes naturally<br>
occurring ami|no acids as well as non-naturally occurring amino acids, including amino<br>
acid variants and derivatives. One skilled in the art will recognize, in view of this broad<br>
definition, tha|t reference herein to an amino acid includes, for example, naturally<br><br>
occurring proteogenic L-amino acids; D-amino acids; chemically modified amino acids<br>
such as aminp acid variants and derivatives; naturally occurring non-proteogenic amino<br>
acids such as norleucine, -alanine, ornithine, etc.; and chemically synthesized<br>
compounds having properties known in the art to be characteristic of amino acids.<br>
Examples of non-naturally occurring amino acids include a-methyl amino acids (e.g., -<br>
methyl alanine), D-amino acids, histidine-like amino acids (e.g., 2-amino-histidine, P-<br>
hydroxy-histidine, homohistidine, -fluoromethyl-histidine and a-methyl-histidine),<br>
amino acids naving an extra methylene in the side chain ("homo" amino acids) and amino<br>
acids in which a carboxylic acid functional group in the side chain is replaced with a<br>
sulfonic acid group (e.g., cysteic acid). Preferably, however, the GLP-1 compounds of<br>
the present invention comprise only naturally occurring amino acids except as otherwise<br>
specifically provided herein.<br>
The term "GLP-1 compound" as used herein, includes native GLP-1, [GLP-1 (7-<br>
37)OH or GLP-l(7-36)NH2], GLP-1 analogs, GLP-1 derivatives, GLP-1 biologically<br>
active fragments, extended GLP-1 or an analog or fragment of an extended GLP-1<br>
peptide (see,, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 60/346474 and 60/405,097),<br>
exendin-4 aralogs and exendin-4 derivatives comprising one or two Cys residues at<br>
particular positions of the peptide as described herein.<br>
By custom in the art, the amino terminus of native GLP-l(7-37)OH has been<br>
assigned residue number 7 and the carboxy-terminus, number 37. The other amino acids<br>
in the polypontide are numbered consecutively, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. For example,<br>
position 12 is phenylalanine and position 22 is glycine in the native molecule.<br>
A "GLP-1 fragment," or "fragment of a GLP-1 compound" as used herein, is a<br>
biologically active polypeptide obtained after truncation of one or more amino acids from<br>
the AT-terminus and/or C-terminus of a GLP-1 compound. The nomenclature used to<br>
describe GLtM(7-37)OH applies to GLP-1 fragments. For example, GLP-l(9-36)OH<br>
denotes a GLP-1 fragment obtained by truncating two amino acids from the TV-terminus<br>
and one amino acid from the C-terminus. The amino acids in the fragment are denoted by<br>
the same number as the corresponding amino acid in GLP-l(7-37)OH. For example, the<br>
N-terminal glutamic acid in GLP-1 (9-36)OH is at position 9; position 12 is occupied by<br>
phenylalanine; and position 22 is occupied by glycine, as in GLP-1 (7-37)OH.<br><br>
GLP-1 compounds include GLP-1 analogs and exendin-4 analogs. To be clear,<br>
"exendin-4 analogs" as included within "GLP-1 compounds" always have one or two Cys<br>
residues. Preferably, a GLP-1 analog has the amino acid sequence of GLP-1 (7-3 7)OH or<br>
an extended GLP-1 peptide as described in U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos.<br>
60/346474 filed August 1, 2002, or 60/405,097 filed August 21, 2002, both entitled<br>
"Extended Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Analogs." or a fragment thereof, modified so that 1,<br>
2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 amino acids differ from the amino acid in the corresponding position of<br>
GLP-l(7-37)OH or a fragment of GLP-1 (7-3 7)OH or modified so that 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6<br>
amino acids differ from the amino acid in the corresponding position of an extended<br>
GLP-1 peptide. Most preferred GLP-1 analogs are described herein in Formulas, I, II, III,<br>
IV, V, VI and VII. Most preferred exendin-4 analogs are described herein in Formula<br>
VIII.<br>
The term "PEGylated" when referring to a GLP-1 compound of the present<br>
invention refers to a GLP-1 compound that is chemically modified by covalent<br>
attachment of one or more molecules of polyethylene glycol or a derivative thereof.<br>
Furthermore it is intended that the term "PEG" refers to polyethylene glycol or a<br>
derivative thereof as are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos: 5,445,090;<br>
5,900,461; 5,932,462; 6,436,386; 6,448,369; 6,437,025; 6,448,369; 6,495,659; 6,515,100<br>
and 6,514,4911). Preferably, in PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention,<br>
PEG (or a derivative thereof) is covalently attached to one or more lysine or cysteine<br>
residues of the GLP-1 compound. Most preferably, PEG is covalently attached to one or<br>
more cysteine residues of the GLP-1 compound. For PEGylated exendin-4 analogs of the<br>
present invention, PEG is attached to one or two cysteine residues introduced into<br>
exendin-4 or in exendin-4 analog at positions identified in Formula VIII. Optionally, the<br>
PEG molecules may be attached to the GLP-1 compound via a linker or spacer molecule<br>
(see exemplary spacer molecules described in U.S. Patent 6,268,343).<br>
In the nonmenclature used herein to designate GLP-1 compounds, the substituting<br>
amino acid and its position is indicated followed by the name of the parent peptide. For<br>
example, Glu22-GLP-l(7-37)OH designates a GLP-1 compound in which the glycine<br>
normally found at position 22 of GLP-1 (7-3 7)OH has been replaced with glutamic acid;<br>
Val8Glu22-GLP-l(7-37)OH (or V8E22-GLP-l(7-37)OH) designates a GLP-1 compound in<br><br>
which alanine normally found at position 8 and glycine normally found at position 22 of<br>
GLP-1 (7-37)OH have been replaced with valine and glutamic acid, respectively. Valg-<br>
exendin4 designates a GLP-1 compound in which serine normally found at position 8 of<br>
exendin4 has been replaced with a valine. Preferably the GLP-1 compounds of the<br>
invention haive insulinotropic activity.<br>
"Insulinotropic activity" refers to the ability to stimulate insulin secretion in<br>
response to elevated glucose levels, thereby causing glucose uptake by cells and<br>
decreased plfcsma glucose levels. Insulinotropic activity can be assessed by methods<br>
known in the art, including using in vivo experiments and in vitro assays that measure<br>
GLP-1 recepor binding activity or receptor activation, e.g., assays employing pancreatic<br>
islet cells or insulinoma cells, as described in EP 619,322 to Gelfand, et al, and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,120,712, respectively. Insulinotropic activity is routinely measured in<br>
humans by measuring insulin levels or C-peptide levels.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention an in vitro GLP-1 receptor signaling<br>
assay is used to determine whether a PEGylated GLP-1 compound of the present<br>
invention will exhibit insulinotropic activity in vivo. Insulinotropic activity is an activity<br>
that may be used to demonstrate that the PEGylated GLP-1 compound is biologically<br>
active.<br>
"In vitno potency" as used herein, is the measure of the ability of a peptide to<br>
activate the GLP-1 receptor in a cell-based assay. In vitro potency is expressed as the<br>
"EC50" which is the effective concentration of compound that results in 50% activity in a<br>
single dose-response experiment. For the purposes of the present invention, in vitro<br>
potency is determined using a fluorescence assay that employs HEK-293 cells that stably<br>
express the human GLP-1 receptor. These HEK-293 cells have stably integrated a DNA<br>
vector having a cAMP response element (CRE) driving expression of the P-lactamase<br>
(BLAM) gene. The interaction of a GLP-1 compound (or agonist) with the receptor<br>
initiates a signal that results in activation of the cAMP response element and subsequent<br>
expression of actamase. The p-lactamase CCF2/AM substrate that emits fluorescence<br>
when it is cleaved by p-lactamase (PanVera LLC) can then be added to cells that have<br>
been exposed to a specific amount of GLP-1 agonist to provide a measure of GLP-1<br>
agonist potencyl The assay is further described in Zlokarnik et al. (1998) Science 279:84-<br><br>
88. The EC50 values for the compounds listed in Example 4 were determined using the<br>
BLAM assay described above. Relative in vitro potency values may be established by<br>
running Val8-GLP-l(7-37)OH of native GLP-1 as a control and assigning the control a<br>
reference value of 100%.<br>
The t0rm "plasma half-life" refers to the time in which half of the relevant<br>
molecules circulate in the plasma prior to being cleared. An alternatively used term is<br>
"elimination half-life." The term "extended" or "longer" used in the context of plasma<br>
half-life or elimination half-life indicates there is a statistically significant increase in the<br>
half-life of a PEGylated GLP-1 compound relative to that of the reference molecule (e.g.,<br>
the non-PEGMated form of the peptide or the native peptide) as determined under<br>
comparable conditions. Preferably a PEGylated GLP-1 compound of the present<br>
invention hag an elimination half-life of at least one hour, more preferably at least 3, 5, 7,<br>
10, 15, 20 hours and most preferably at least 24 hours. The half-life reported herein in<br>
Example 5 is the elimination half-life; it is that which corresponds to the terminal log-<br>
linear rate of elimination. Those of skill in the art appreciate that half-life is a derived<br>
parameter that changes as a function of both clearance and volume of distribution.<br>
Clearance is the measure of the body's ability to eliminate a drug. As clearance<br>
decreases due, for example, to modifications to a drug, half-life would be expected to<br>
increase. However, this reciprocal relationship is exact only when there is no change in<br>
the volume of distribution. A useful approximate relationship between the terminal log-<br>
linear half-life (t 1/2), clearance (C), and volume of distribution (V) is given by the<br>
equation: t1/2 0.693 (V/C). Clearance does not indicate how much drug is being<br>
removed bull, rather, the volume of biological fluid such as blood or plasma that would<br>
have to be completely freed of drug to account for the elimination. Clearance is<br>
expressed as a volume per unit of time. The PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present<br>
invention preferably have a clearance value of 200 ml/h/kg or less, more preferably 180,<br>
150, 120, 100, 80, 60 ml/h/kg or less and most preferably 50, 40 or 20 ml/h/kg or less<br>
(See Example 5).<br>
In the present invention, a Cys amino acid may not be incorporated at positions 7,<br>
28, 29, 31 or 32 or GLP-1 or GLP-1 analog peptides because of loss of activity of the<br>
resulting peptide. It is contemplated that all other residues may be replace with a cysteine<br><br>
but it is preferably that such cysteine be incorporated at position(s) selected from the<br>
group consisting of 11, 12, 16, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 34, 35, 36 and 37 of GLP-1 or<br>
GLP-1 analog peptides, with preferably no more than 2 or 1 Cys amino acids per<br>
molecule. When Cys amino acids exist in the GLP-1 molecule, it is even more preferred<br>
preferred that they are located at position(s) selected from the group consisting of 22, 26,<br>
34, 35, 36 and 37 and even more preferred to exist at position 26 and/or 34. The resulting<br>
molecule may be PEGylated at the Cys amino acids resulting in a modified molecule that<br>
retains all or a portion of a biological activity while having a longer half-life than that of<br>
the unmodified molecule or than that of a native molecule. Alternatively, in the<br>
invention, GLP-1 or GLP-1 analog peptides may be PEGylated at one, two or three of the<br>
lysine residues at positions 18, 22 and 26; or at the amino acid at the carboxy terminus of<br>
the peptide.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is the unPEGylated GLP-1 compounds with<br>
the sequence as shown in SEQ ID NOs 3-10 provided that there are 2 or 1 Cys in the<br>
molecule. Applicants discovered that residues at specific position of the GLP-1<br>
compounds can be substituted with Cys and still retain biological activity. These<br>
unPEGylated GLP-1 compounds may be intermediates used in the process of producing<br>
the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention. These compounds may also<br>
be used as therapeutics for disorders where an extended half-life is not required, e.g.,<br>
irritable bowel syndrome.<br>
Once a peptide for use in the invention is prepared and purified, it is modified by<br>
covalently linking at least one PEG molecule to Cys or Lys residues or to the carboxy-<br>
terminal amino acid. It is difficult to endow delicate peptide or protein molecules with<br>
suitable new properties by attaching polymers without causing loss of their functionality.<br>
A wide variety of methods have been described in the art to produce covalently<br>
conjugated to PEG and the specific method used for the present invention is not intended<br>
to be limiting (for review article see, Roberts, M. et al. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,<br>
54:459-476, 2002). Carboxy-terminal attachment of PEG may be attached via enzymatic<br>
coupling using recombinant GLP-1 peptide as a precursor or alternative methods known<br>
in the art and described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,343,898 or International Journal of<br>
Peptide &amp; Potein Research 43:127-38, 1994. PEGylation of proteins may overcome<br>
many of the bharmacological and toxicological/immunological problems associated with<br><br>
using peptide s or proteins as therapeutics. However, for any individual peptide it is<br>
uncertain whether the PEGylated form of the peptide will have significant loss in<br>
bioactivity as compared to the unPEGylated form of the peptide.<br>
The bioactivity of PEGylated proteins can be effected by factors such as: i) the<br>
size of the PEG molecule; ii) the particular sites of attachment; iii) the degree of<br>
modification; iv) adverse coupling conditions; v) whether a linker is used for attachment<br>
or whether the polymer is directly attached; vi) generation of harmful co-products; vii)<br>
damage inflicted by the activated polymer; or viii) retention of charge. Depending on the<br>
coupling reac tion used, polymer modification of cytokines, in particular, has resulted in<br>
dramatic reductions in bioactivity. [Francis, G.E., et al., (1998) PEGylation of cytokines<br>
and other the repeutic proteins and peptides: the importance of biological optimization of<br>
coupling techniques, Intl. J. Hem. 68:1-18].<br>
PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention have an in vitro biological<br>
activity that is at least 0.5% that of native GLP-1 or more preferably that of Val8-GLP-<br>
l(7-37)OH. More preferably, the PEGylated GLP-1 compound of the present invention<br>
has an in vitrop biological activity that is at least 1% or 3% that of native GLP-1 or more<br>
preferably that of Val8-GLP-l(7-37)OH. Such biological activity may be determined by<br>
the in vitro potency assay as described herein (Example 4) or by other GLP-1 assays<br>
known in the art. Although some PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the invention may<br>
have biological activity lower than that of native GLP-1 or of Val8-GLP-l(7-37)OH as<br>
measured in a particular assay; this activity decrease is compensated by the compound's<br>
extended half -life and/or lower clearance value and may even be a favorable<br>
characteristic for a GLP-1 compound with an extended elimination half-life.<br>
It is further contemplated that the positions of the GLP-1 peptide which have been<br>
found to accommodate a cysteine residue without elimination of biological activity may<br>
be substituted with a cysteine in the analogous position of exendin-4 and result in an<br>
exendin-4 analog still capable of binding the GLP-1 receptor. Preferably there are no<br>
more than 2 sr 1 Cys amino acids per exendin-4 analog of the invention. Preferably Cys<br>
that exist in 1 he molecule are at positions selected from the group consisting of 11, 12, 16,<br>
22, 23, 24, 2 5, 26, 27, 30, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44 (see Formula VIII);<br>
preferably positions selected from the group consisting of 22, 26, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39,<br>
40, 41, 42, 4 5 and 44; even more preferably positions 26 and/or 34. Cys amino acids<br><br>
present in the molecule are covalently attached to a PEG molecule resulting in a<br>
PEGylated exendin-4 analog with an elimination half-life longer than that of native<br>
exendin-4. Preferably a PEGylated exendin-4 analog peptide (as described in Formula<br>
VIII) of the; present invention has a biological activity that is at least 0.5%, 1.0%, 3%,<br>
10%, 30%, or 50% that of the unPEGylated exendin-4 analog. The sequence of wild type<br>
exendin 4 is: HGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPS<br>
(SEQIDNO: 11).<br>
In its typical form, PEG is a linear polymer with terminal hydroxyl groups and has<br>
the formula HO-CH2CH2-(CH2CH2O)N-CH2CH2-OH, where n is from about 8 to about<br>
4000. The terminal hydrogen may be substituted with a protective group such as an alkyl<br>
or alkanol group. Preferably, PEG has at least one hydroxy group, more preferably it is a<br>
terminal hydroxy group. It is this hydroxy group which is preferably activated to react<br>
with the peptide. There are many forms of PEG useful for the present invention.<br>
Numerous derivatives of PEG exist in the art and are suitable for use in the invention.<br>
(See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos: 5,445,090; 5,900,461; 5,932,462; 6,436,386; 6,448,369;<br>
6,437,025^ 6,448,369; 6,495,659; 6,515,100 and 6,514,491 and Zalipsky, S. Bioconjugate<br>
Chem. 6:150-165, 1995). The PEG molecule covalently attached to GLP-1 compounds in<br>
the present invention is not intended to be limited to a particular type. PEG's molecular<br>
weight is preferably from 500-100,000 daltons and more preferably from 20,000-60,000<br>
daltons and most preferably from 20,000-40,000 daltons. PEG may be linear or branched<br>
and PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the invention may have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 PEG<br>
molecules attached to the peptide. It is most preferably that there be one PEG molecule<br>
per PEGylated GLP-1 compound molecule; however, when there are more than PEG<br>
molecules! per peptide molecule, it is preferred that there be no more than six. It is further<br>
contemplated that both ends of the PEG molecule may be homo- or heroly-functionalized<br>
for crosslimking two or more GLP-1 compounds together.<br>
The present invention provides GLP-1 compounds with one or more PEG<br>
molecules covalently attached thereto. One method for preparing the PEGylated GLP-1<br>
compounds of the present invention involves the use of PEG-maleimide to directly attach<br>
PEG to a thiol group of the peptide. The introduction of a thiol functionality can be<br>
achieved by adding or inserting a Cys residue onto or into the peptide at positions<br>
described above. A thiol functionality can also be introduced onto the side-chain of the<br><br>
peptide (e.k. acylation of lysine e-amino group of a thiol-containing acid). A PEGylation<br>
process of the present invention utilizes Michael addition to form a stable thioether linker.<br>
The reaction is highly specific and takes place under mild conditions in the presence of<br>
other functional groups. PEG maleimide has been used as a reactive polymer for<br>
preparing well-defined, bioactive PEG-protein conjugates. It is preferable that the<br>
procedure uses a molar excess of a thiol-containing GLP-1 compound relative to PEG<br>
maleimide to drive the reaction to completion. The reactions are preferably performed<br>
between pH 4.0 and 9.0 at room temperature for 15 to 40 hours. The excess of<br>
unPEGylated thiol-containing peptide is readily separated from the PEGylated product by<br>
conventional separation methods. Exemplary conditions required for PEGylation of<br>
GLP-1 compounds are set forth in Example 1. Cysteine PEGylation may be performed<br>
using PEG maleimide or bifurcated PEG maleimide.<br>
GLP-1 compounds have a variety of biological activities. For example, GLP-1<br>
has been found to stimulate insulin release, thereby causing glucose uptake by cells and<br>
decreased serum glucose levels [see, e.g., Mojsov, S., (1992) Int. J. Peptide Protein<br>
Research, 40:333]. GLP-1 is particularly promising as a treatment for non-insulin<br>
dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) as it does present a risk of hypoglycemia as do<br>
present NIDDM treatments. GLP-1 is also contemplated to be a treatment for obesity,<br>
irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia.<br>
It is contemplated that a use of a PEGylated GLP-1 compound of the present<br>
invention includes use in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of non-<br>
insulin dependent diabetes, obesity, stroke, myocardial infarction, irritable bowel<br>
syndrome or functional dyspepsia. PEGylation of a GLP-1 compound may be combined<br>
with other modifications known in the art to increase GLP-1 half-life (see, e.g, U.S.<br>
Patent Application Serial Nos. 60/346474 filed August 1, 2002, and 60/405,097 filed<br>
August 21,2002) and thereby increase the half-life of the compound even further than<br>
PEGylation alone or the other modification method alone.<br>
As used herein, the term "GLP-1 compound" also includes pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of the compounds described herein. A GLP-1 compound of this<br>
invention can possess a sufficiently acidic, a sufficiently basic, or both functional<br>
groups, and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic bases, and inorganic<br>
and organic acids, to form a salt. Acids commonly employed to form acid addition<br><br>
salts are inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid,<br>
sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, and organic acids such as p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, P-bromophenyl-sulfonic acid,<br>
carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid, and the like.<br>
Examples of such salts include the sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite,<br>
phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate,<br>
pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate,<br>
acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caproate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate,<br>
succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne-l,4-dioate, hexyne-1,6-<br>
dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate,<br>
methoxybenzoate, phthalate, sulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate,<br>
phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, glycolate,<br>
tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene-1-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-<br>
sulfonate, mandelate, and the like.<br>
Base addition salts include those derived from inorganic bases, such as<br>
ammonium or alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, and the<br>
like. Such bases useful in preparing the salts of this invention thus include sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, and the<br>
like.<br>
The PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention are particularly<br>
suited for parenteral administration, they can be also be delivered orally, by nasal<br>
administration, or by inhalation. Parenteral administration can include, for example,<br>
systemic administration, such as by intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or<br>
intraperitoneal injection. The PEGylated GLP-1 compounds can be administered to<br>
the subject in conjunction with an acceptable pharmaceutical carrier, diluent or<br>
excipient as part of a pharmaceutical composition for treating the diseases discussed<br>
above. The pharmaceutical composition can be a solution or, if administered<br>
parenterally, a suspension of the GLP-1 compound or a suspension of the GLP-1<br>
compound complexed with a divalent metal cation such as zinc. Suitable<br>
pharmaceutical carriers may contain inert ingredients which do not interact with the<br>
peptide or peptide derivative. Standard pharmaceutical formulation techniques may<br>
be employed such as those described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack<br><br>
Publishing Company, Easton, PA. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers for parenteral<br>
administration include, for example, sterile water, physiological saline, bacteriostatic<br>
saline (saline containing about 0.9% mg/ml benzyl alcohol), phosphate-buffered<br>
saline, Hank's solution, Ringer's-lactate and the like. Some examples of suitable<br>
excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, trehalose, sorbitol, and mannitol.<br>
The PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the invention may be formulated for<br>
administration such that blood plasma levels are maintained in the efficacious range<br>
for extended time periods. The main barrier to effective oral peptide drug delivery is<br>
poor bioavailability due to degradation of peptides by acids and enzymes, poor<br>
absorption through epithelial membranes, and transition of peptides to an insoluble<br>
form after exposure to the acidic pH environment in the digestive tract. Oral delivery<br>
systems for peptides such as those encompassed by the present invention are known<br>
in the art. For example, PEGylated GLP-1 compounds can be encapsulated using<br>
microspheres and then delivered orally. For example, PEGylated GLP-1 compounds<br>
can be encapsulated into microspheres composed of a commercially available,<br>
biocompatible, biodegradable polymer, poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-COOH and olive<br>
oil as a filler. See Joseph, et al. (2000) Diabetologia 43:1319-1328. Other types of<br>
microsphere technology is also available commercially such as Medisorb® and<br>
Prolease® biodegradable polymers from Alkermes. Medisorb® polymers can be<br>
produced with any of the lactide isomers. Lactide:glycolide ratios can be varied<br>
between 0:100 and 100:0 allowing for a broad range of polymer properties. This<br>
allows for the design of delivery systems and implantable devices with resorption<br>
times ranging from weeks to months. Emisphere has also published numerous articles<br>
discussing oral delivery technology for peptides and proteins. For example, see WO<br>
9528838 by Leone-bay et al. which discloses specific carriers comprised of modified<br>
amino acids to facilitate absorption.<br>
The PEGylated GLP-1 compounds described herein can be used to treat subjects<br>
with a wide variety of diseases and conditions. PEGylated GLP-1 compounds<br>
encompassed by the present invention exert their biological effects by acting at a receptor<br>
referred to as the "GLP-1 receptor" (see Dillon et al. (1993) Cloning and Functional<br>
Expression of the Human Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor, Endocrinology,<br>
133:1907-1910). Subjects with diseases and/or conditions that respond favorably to<br><br>
GLP-1 receptor stimulation or to the adminstration of GLP-1 compounds can therefore be<br>
treated with the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention. These subjects<br>
are said to "be in need of treatment with GLP-1 compounds" or "in need of GLP-1<br>
receptor stimulation".<br>
Included are subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes, insulin dependent<br>
diabetes, stroke (see WO 00/16797 by Efendic), myocardial infarction (see WO 98/08531<br>
by Efendic), obesity (see WO 98/19698 by Efendic), catabolic changes after surgery (see<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,006,753 to Efendic), functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome<br>
(see WO 99/64060 by Efendic). Also included are subjects requiring prophylactic<br>
treatment with a GLP-1 compound, e.g., subjects at risk for developing non-insulin<br>
dependent diabetes (see WO 00/07617). Additional subjects include those with impaired<br>
glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose, subjects whose body weight is about 25%<br>
above normal body weight for the subject's height and body build, subjects with a partial<br>
pancreatectomy, subjects having one or more parents with non-insulin dependent<br>
diabetes, subjects who have had gestational diabetes and subjects who have had acute or<br>
chronic pancreatitis are at risk for developing non-insulin dependent diabetes.<br>
The PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention can be used to<br>
normalize blood glucose levels, prevent pancreatic (3-cell deterioration, induce p-cell<br>
proliferation, stimulate insulin gene transcription, up-regulate IDX-l/PDX-1 or other<br>
growth factors, improve (3-cell function, activate dormant P-cells, differentiate cells into<br>
P-cells, stimulate P-cell replication, inhibit p-cell apoptosis, regulate body weight and<br>
induce weight loss.<br>
An "effective amount" of a PEGylated GLP-1 compound is the quantity that<br>
results in a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect without causing unacceptable<br>
side-effects when administered to a subject in need of GLP-1 receptor stimulation. A<br>
"desired therapeutic effect" includes one or more of the following: 1) an amelioration of<br>
the symptom(s) associated with the disease or condition; 2) a delay in the onset of<br>
symptoms associated with the disease or condition; 3) increased longevity compared with<br>
the absence of the treatment; and 4) greater quality of life compared with the absence of<br>
the treatment. For example, an "effective amount" of a PEGylated GLP-1 compound for<br>
the treatment of diabetes is the quantity that would result in; greater control of blood<br><br>
glucose concentration than in the absence of treatment, thereby resulting in a delay in the<br>
onset of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy or kidney disease. An<br>
"effective amount" of a PEGylated GLP-1 compound for the prevention of diabetes is the<br>
quantity that would delay, compared with the absence of treatment, the onset of elevated<br>
blood glucose levels that require treatment with anti-hypoglycaemic drugs such as<br>
sulfonyl ureas, thiazolidinediones, insulin and/or bisguanidines.<br>
An "effective amount" of the PEGylated GLP-1 compound administered to a<br>
subject will also depend on the type and severity of the disease and on the characteristics<br>
of the subject, such as general health, age, sex, body weight and tolerance to drugs.<br>
Typically, the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention will be administered<br>
such that plasma levels are within the range of about 5 picomoles/liter and about 200<br>
picomoles/liter. Optimum plasma levels for Val8-GLP-l(7-37)OH were determined to be<br>
between 30 picomoles/liter and about 200 picomoles/liter.<br>
A typical dose range for the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present<br>
invention will range from about 0.01 mg per day to about 1000 mg per day for an adult.<br>
Preferably, the dosage ranges from about 0.1 mg per day to about 100 mg per day, more<br>
preferably from about 1.0 mg/day to about 10 mg/day.<br>
A "subject" is a mammal, preferably a human, but can also be an animal,<br>
e.g., companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats, and the like), farm animals (e.g., cows,<br>
sheep, pigs, horses, and the like) and laboratory animals (e.g., rats, mice, guinea<br>
pigs, and the like).<br>
The peptides used to generate the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present<br>
invention can be prepared by using standard methods of solution phase or solid-phase<br>
peptide synthesis techniques. Peptide synthesizers are commercially available from, for<br>
example, Applied Biosystems in Foster City CA. Reagents for solid phase synthesis are<br>
commercially available, for example, from Midwest Biotech (Fishers, IN). Solid phase<br>
peptide synthesizers can be used according to manufacturers instructions for blocking<br>
interfering groups, protecting the amino acid to be reacted, coupling, decoupling, and<br>
capping of unreacted amino acids.<br>
Typically, an (-^-carbamoyl protected amino acid and the iV-terminal amino acid<br>
on the growing peptide chain on a resin is coupled at room temperature in an inert solvent<br>
such as dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone or methylene chloride in the presence<br><br>
of coupling agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and a<br>
base such as diisopropylethylamine. The (-N-carbamoyl protecting group is removed<br>
from the resulting peptide resin using a reagent such as trifluoroacetic acid or piperidine,<br>
and the coupling reaction repeated with the next desired N-protected amino acid to be<br>
added to the peptide chain. Suitable amine protecting groups are well known in the art<br>
and are described, for example, in Green and Wuts, "Protecting Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis", John Wiley and Sons, 1991, the entire teachings of which are incorporated by<br>
reference. Examples include t-butyloxycarbonyl (tBoc) and fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl<br>
(Fmoc).<br>
The peptides are also synthesized using standard automated solid-phase synthesis<br>
protocols using t-butoxycarbonyl- or fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-alpha-amino acids with<br>
appropriate side-chain protection. After completion of synthesis, peptides are cleaved<br>
from the solid-phase support with simultaneous side-chain deprotection using standard<br>
hydrogen fluoride methods. Crude peptides are then further purified using Reversed-<br>
Phase Chromatography on Vydac C18 columns using acetonitrile gradients in 0.1%<br>
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). To remove acetonitrile, peptides are lyophilized from a<br>
solution containing 0.1 % TFA, acetonitrile and water. Purity can be verified by<br>
analytical reversed phase chromatography. Identity of peptides can be verified by mass<br>
spectrometry. Peptides can be solubilized in aqueous buffers at neutral pH.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following examples that are not<br>
intended to be limiting in any way.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - PEGvlation of GLP-1 related analogs:<br>
PEGylation reactions are run under conditions that permit the formation of a<br>
thioether bond. Specifically, the pH of the solution ranges from about 4 to 9 and the<br>
thiol-containing peptide concentrations range from 1 to 10 molar excess of methoxy-<br>
PEG2-MAL concentration. The PEGylation reactions are normally run at room<br>
temperature. The PEGylated GLP-1 peptide is then isolated using reverse-phase HPLC or<br>
size exclusion chromatography (SEC). PEGylated GLP-1 analogues are characterized<br>
using analytical RP-HPLC, HPLC-SEC, SDS-PAGE, and/or MALDI Mass Spectrometry.<br>
Thiol-containing GLP-1 peptides are reacted with 40 kDa polyethylene glycol-<br>
maleimide (PEG-maleimide) to produce derivatives with PEG covalently attached via a<br><br>
thioether bond. For example, peptide Cex-51-C (V8E22I33C40 GLP-1, 45aa in length; 7.5<br>
mg, 1.8 µmol) is dissolved in 2 ml of 200 mM phosphate buffer containing 20 mM<br>
EDTA, pH 7.4. The solution is then purged with argon. To this solution is added 40 mg<br>
of methoxy-PEG2-MAL, a bifurcated PEG maleimide (Lot# PT-02B-10, Shearwater<br>
Polymers, Inc., Huntsville, Alabama) (0.55:1 mole/mole ratio of PEG to peptide). The<br>
reaction is performed for 2 hours. Then 25 mg of the PEGylated peptide is purified by<br>
RP-HPLC, characterized by size-exclusion HPLC, and tested for in vitro activity.<br>
Example 2 - 40kDa-PEG-maleimide reaction with GLP analogs<br>
GLP-1 analogs such as C16E22V8GLP and VgC38 GLP are selectively PEGylated at<br>
the introduced cysteine residue using maleimide-activated bifurcated 40 kDa mPEG<br>
(Shearwater Polymers, Inc.). For the PEGylation reaction, the peptide to be PEGylated is<br>
dissolved in 100 mM TRIS buffer at pH 8.0 and a 1.25-fold molar excess of bulk 40 kDa-<br>
mPEG is added. The reaction is allowed to stir at room temperature for 2-3 hours and<br>
then dialyzed overnight (7 kDa membrane) against 10 mM citrate, 10 mM phosphate, pH<br>
7.4 at approximately 5°C. The PEGylated-GLP molecules are purified by anion exchange<br>
chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences Corp, Piscataway, NJ)<br>
using a NaCl gradient at neutral pR.<br>
Example 3 - DSPE-3.4kDa-PEG-maleimide reaction with GLP-1 analogs<br>
GLP-1 analogs such as C16E22V8GLP-l and V8C38GLP-1 are selectively<br>
PEGylated at the introduced cysteine residue using maleimide-activated 3.4kDa mPEG<br>
terminated with a lipid, distearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DSPE) (Shearwater<br>
Polymers, Inc.). For the PEGylation reaction, the peptide is dissolved in 100 mM TRIS<br>
buffer at pH 8 and a 1.25-fold molar excess of bulk DSPE-3.4kDa-PEG-maleimide is<br>
added. Absolute ethanol is added to approximately 17% to assist in solubilizing the<br>
DSPE-3.4kDa-PEG-maleimide. The reaction is allowed to stir at room temperature for 2-<br>
3 hours and then dialyzed overnight (7 kDa membrane) against 10 mM citrate, 10 mM<br>
phosphate, pH 7.4 at approximately 5°C. The PEGylated-peptide is purified by anion<br>
exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences Corp,<br>
Piscataway, NJ) using a NaCl gradient at neutral pH.<br><br>
Example 4 - In vitro activity assay<br>
HEK-293 cells expressing the human GLP-1 receptor, using the Pan Vera LLC<br>
CRE-BLAM system, are seeded at 20,000 to 40,000 cells/well/100 µl DMEM medium<br>
with 10%FBS into a poly-d-lysine coated 96 well black, clear-bottom plate. The day after<br>
seeding, the medium is flicked off and 80 µl plasma-free DMEM medium is added. On<br>
the third day after seeding, 20 µl of plasma-free DMEM medium with 0.5% BSA<br>
containing different concentrations of PEGylated GLP-1 compound is added to each well<br>
to generate a dose response curve. Generally, fourteen dilutions containing from 3<br>
nanomolar to 30 nanomolar PEGylated peptide are used to generate a dose response curve<br>
from which EC50 values can be determined. After 5 hours of incubation with the<br>
PEGylated peptide, 20 µl of -lactamase substrate (CCF2/AM, PanVera LLC) is added<br>
and incubation continued for 1 hour at which time fluorescence is determined on a<br>
cytofluor. The assay is further described in Zlokarnik, et al. (1998), Science, 278:84-88.<br>
The following PEGylated GLP-1 peptides were tested as described and had EC50 values<br><br>
Example 5 - Pharmacokinetic analysis of derivatized GLP-1 peptide<br>
A PEGylated GLP-1 analog (V8E22I33C40 kDa PEG (PEGylated, C40-modified<br>
CEX-51)) is administered by intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) routes at a dose of<br>
0.1 mg/kg to male SD rats. The animals (2 rats per timepoint for IV, 3 rats for timepoint<br>
for SC) are bled at various times between 0 and 336 hours after dosing. Plasma is<br>
collected from each sample and analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic<br>
parameters are calculated using model-dependent (IV data) and independent (SC data)<br>
methods (WinNonlin Pro). A representation of the pharamcokinetic parameters is<br>
reported in the Table 1 below. By IV administration, the PEGylated GLP-1 analog has an<br>
elimination half-life of approximately 1.5 days while by SC administration the PEGylated<br><br>
GLP-1 analog has an elimination half-life of approximately 1.3 days. No adverse clinical<br>
observations are associated with IV or SC administration of 0.1 mg/kg V8E22I33C40-<br>
40kDaPEG. Prolonged elimination half-life, slow clearance and relatively high<br>
subcutaneous bioavailability (approximately 60%) are observed for the compound.<br><br>
When V8-GLP(7-37)OH is similarly IV administered to Fischer 344 rats at a dose of<br>
10 µg/kg, profoundly different clearance and elimination half-life values are obtained as<br>
listed below.<br>
Clearance: 1449 ml/hr/kg<br>
t1/2 (hr):	0.05<br>
A PEGylated GLP-1 analog (V8E22I33C40-40 kDa PEG (PEGylated, C40-modified<br>
CEX-51)) is administered by intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) routes at a dose of<br>
0.1 mg/kg to male cynomolgus monkeys. The animals are bled at various times between<br>
0 and 336 hours after dosing. Plasma is collected from each sample and analyzed by<br>
radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated using model-dependent<br>
(IV data) and independent (SC data) methods (WinNonlin Pro). A representation of the<br>
pharamcokinetic parameters is reported in the Table 2 below. By IV administration, the<br>
PEGylated GLP-1 analog has an elimination half-life of approximately 59.5 hours while<br>
by SC administration the PEGylated GLP-1 analog has an elimination half-life of<br>
approximately 61.6 hours.<br><br><br>
Example 6 - Pharmacodynamic analysis of derivatized GLP-1 peptide<br>
A PEGylated GLP-1 analog (V8E22I33C40-40 kDa PEG (PEGylated, C40-modified<br>
CEX-51)) is administered by subcutaneous (SC) route at doses of 3 nmol/kg (12.33mg/kg<br>
= 0.62 µg (microgram)/50g mouse) or 10 nmol/kg (41mg/kg = 2 µg (microgram)/50g<br>
mouse) to male C57BL/6OlaHsd-Lep0bmice versus a vehicle only control. The animals<br>
(6 mice per timepoint) are dosed with a single injection of either the PEGylated GLP-1<br>
analog or vehicle at 11:00am. The mice are then fasted overnight and an IPTGG (1 g<br>
dextrose/kg i.p.) is performed. Repeat samples for glucose and insulin are taken pre and<br>
after the glucose injection at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. A representation of the<br>
pharamcodynamic parameters is reported in the Tables below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
