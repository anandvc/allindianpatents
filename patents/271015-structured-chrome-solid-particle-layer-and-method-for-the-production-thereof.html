				<td>Structured chromium solids particles layer and method for its production<br>
The invention relates to a structured chromium solids particles layer which has a microstructure<br>
and a network of cracks, wherein solids particles are embedded in the network of cracks. The<br>
invention also relates to a method for the production of this structured chromium solids particles<br>
layer and a machine element which is coated with the structured chromium solids particles<br>
layer.<br>
Machine elements which are exposed to friction and high temperatures, for example piston<br>
rings, must have surfaces which are corrosion-resistant, wear- and seizure-resistant as well as<br>
scorch-resistant and must also have good sliding properties. For this the machine elements, in<br>
particular their contact surfaces, can be covered with wear-protection layers in the form of<br>
electrolytically deposited hard chromium layers.<br>
To improve wear and seizure resistance, solids particles can be embedded in electroplated hard<br>
chromium layers. Electroplated hard chromium layers which have a network of cracks and in the<br>
cracks of which solids particles are embedded are described in DE 3531410 A1 and<br>
EP0217126A1. Particularly advantageous properties can be achieved by diamond particles<br>
with a size from 0.25 - 0.4 urn, embedded in the cracks of such an electrolytically deposited<br>
hard chromium layer, as described in WO 2001/004386 A1 and EP 1114209 B1.<br>
Electroplated hard chromium layers can also be provided with a microstructure. Structured<br>
electroplated hard chromium layers which have particularly good tribological properties are<br>
known from DE 10255853 A1, WO 2004/050960 A1, DE 102004019370 A1 and<br>
WO 2005/108648 A2. A hard chromium layer the structure of which is cup-shaped and/or<br>
labyrinthine and/or columnar can be obtained according to this prior art through the composition<br>
of the electrolyte used during production and the low current yield of below 12 % as specific<br>
method measures. This cup-shaped and/or labyrinthine and/or columnar surface structure<br>
provides outstanding sliding properties and very good emergency running properties, as the<br>
surface structure is characterized by good lubricant-retention capacity.<br>
In order to combine the high wear-, seizure- and scorch resistances of the above-named<br>
chromium solids particles layer with the good tribological properties of a structured hard<br>
chromium layer, a chromium solids particles layer can be applied to the above-described hard<br>
chromium layer and a double layer thus produced. In this way the advantageous cup-shaped<br>
and/or labyrinthine and/or columnar structure of the structured hard chromium layer can be<br>
transferred to the chromium solids particles layer, even more wear-resistant in comparison with<br>
the structured hard chromium layer, i.e. continued by the chromium solids particles layer, and<br>
thus the very high wear resistance of the chromium solids particles layer can be combined with<br>
the tribological advantages of the structured hard chromium layer.<br>
However, a disadvantage of this type of double coating is that the electrolytic deposition<br>
process is laborious and expensive because of the need to change the deposition conditions<br>
and electrolyte, an overall relatively thick coating must be applied to the machine element and<br>
the structure of the top chromium solids particles layer is frequently no longer as pronounced as<br>
in the previously applied structured hard chromium layer. Furthermore, double coating brings<br>
with it the risk that, with machine elements rubbing after prolonged running times, for example<br>
long engine running times of correspondingly coated piston rings, the upper layer is eroded and<br>
then the structured hard chromium layer lying below, which is particle-free, leads to increased<br>
wear and scorching.<br>
Thus far it has not been possible to embed particles in a thus-structured chromium layer<br>
because crack-forming method measures for embedding particles could not be combined in a<br>
single process with structure-generating method measures.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to overcome the above-mentioned<br>
disadvantages of the prior art and to provide an electroplated hard chromium layer which is<br>
highly wear-resistant and scorch-resistant and simultaneously has good tribological properties<br>
as well as outstanding emergency running properties. Furthermore, the object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a method for the production of such an electroplated hard chromium<br>
layer.<br>
According to the invention this object is achieved by a structured chromium solids particles layer<br>
with a network of cracks in which solids particles are embedded, wherein the crack density<br>
is 10 - 250 /mm, the particle size of the solids particles lies in the range of from 0.01 - 10 urn,<br>
the proportion of solids particles in the overall layer is 1 - 30 vol.-% and the chromium solids<br>
particles layer has a microstructure with depressions in the surface of the layer, wherein the<br>
proportion of the surface area accounted for by the depressions is 5 - 80 %.<br>
The object is further achieved by a method for the production of a structured chromium solids<br>
particles layer, comprising the steps that<br>
(a) a machine element is introduced into an electrolyte which contains<br>
a Cr(VI) compound in a quantity which corresponds to 100 g/l - 400 g/l chromic anhydride,<br>
1 - 8 g/l sulphuric acid,<br>
5 - 18 g/l aliphatic sulphonic acid with 1 - 6 carbon atoms,<br>
solids particles with a size from 0.01 - 10 Âµm and<br>
less than 0.5 g/l inorganic fluoride compounds,<br>
(b) a chromium-containing layer is electrolytically deposited on the machine element at a current<br>
density of 20-100 A/dm2 and a current yield of 12 % or less, then<br>
(c) the current direction is reversed, wherein the solids particles embed themselves in<br>
microcracks of the layer,<br>
and steps (b) and (c) are optionally repeated.<br>
It is surprisingly possible with this method to embed solids particles in a chromium-containing<br>
layer and simultaneously to produce a microstructure of this layer, whereby the obtained layer<br>
has outstanding wear properties, very high scorch resistance values and simultaneously<br>
outstanding tribological properties as well as emergency running properties.<br>
Figures 1-3 show scanning electron microscopy photographs of the structured chromium<br>
solids particles layers according to the invention.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 show scanning electron microscopy slide photographs of structured chromium<br>
solids particles layers according to the invention, in which the surfaces of the structured<br>
chromium solids particles layers were polished in order to make the network of cracks in the<br>
layers visible.<br>
By machine elements are meant within the meaning of the invention machine elements of any<br>
type which are to be provided with a structured chromium solids particles layer. They can be<br>
metallic or non-metallic machine elements. If a structured chromium solids particles layer is to<br>
be formed on a non-metallic item, this will firstly be made electrically conductive by the<br>
application of a thin metal film. The coating according to the invention can be used to coat a<br>
large number of machine elements, in particular for coating machine parts which are exposed to<br>
mechanical wear, in particular friction wear, for example piston rings, cylinders, pistons, pins,<br>
camshafts, seals, composite materials, valves, bearings, pressure cylinders and embossing<br>
rolls. Piston rings, cylinders and pistons for combustion engines, in particular piston rings, are<br>
preferred machine elements.<br>
To form the structured chromium solids particles layer, the machine element is introduced into<br>
the electrolyte and cathodically connected. A direct current or a pulsating direct current, for<br>
example a pulsating direct current with a frequency of up to 10 kHz, is applied to the machine<br>
element. According to the invention a network of cracks and a microstructure of the layer forms<br>
in deposition step (b). In the polarity-reversal step (c) the workpiece is anodically connected and<br>
the microcracks widen with the result that the solids particles embed themselves in the<br>
microcracks. The solids particles are preferably kept suspended in the electrolyte. This can be<br>
achieved by matching the density of the electrolyte to the density of the solids particles.<br>
Furthermore, surfactants can be added to the electrolyte. The electrolyte preferably does not<br>
contain surfactants. The microstructure of the surface is preserved in spite of the polarity-<br>
reversal step and the coating combines the advantageous properties of a structured hard<br>
chromium layer with those of a solids-containing chromium layer. When steps (b) and (c) are<br>
repeated, the cracks are sealed in the subsequent deposition step and a further layer of a<br>
microcracked chromium layer is deposited, the cracks of which are again widened and filled<br>
with particles.<br>
By "electrolyte" is meant within the meaning of the present invention aqueous solutions the<br>
electrical conductivity of which results from electrolytic dissociation of electrolyte constituents<br>
into ions. Consequently, in addition to the above-named components and optionally further<br>
additives present, the electrolyte has water as remainder.<br>
The above-mentioned quantities of the individual components of the electrolyte refer to the<br>
electrolyte. According to the invention a Cr(VI) compound is used. Unlike chromium layers<br>
formed from trivalent Cr electrolytes, electrolytic chromium layers deposited from Cr(VI)<br>
compounds have more lattice defects as, in addition to cubically body-centred chromium,<br>
chromium formed from a hexavalent chromium electrolyte contains a larger proportion of<br>
hexagonal chromium hydride which is attributable to the formation of hydrogen during<br>
electroplating. This leads to a larger number and density of lattice defects and thus also to a<br>
greater hardness of the deposited chromium. A low current yield reinforces this effect. Cr03,<br>
which has proved particularly favourable for the electrolytic deposition of chromium, is<br>
preferably used as Cr(VI) compound.<br>
The electrolyte preferably contains a Cr(VI) compound in a quantity which corresponds to 150<br>
g/l - 300 g/l chromic anhydride. It is further preferred if the electrolyte contains 2 - 6 g/l<br>
sulphuric acid. The electrolyte preferably contains a quantity of 6 - 16 g/l aliphatic sulphonic<br>
acid with 1-6 carbon atoms. Aliphatic sulphonic acids with 1-4 carbon atoms are preferred,<br>
and among these methane sulphonic acid, ethane sulphonic acid, methane disulphonic acid<br>
and/or ethane disulphonic acid are particularly preferred. Methane sulphonic acid is most<br>
preferred.<br>
The electrolyte according to the invention contains less than 0.5 g/l (grams per litre) inorganic<br>
fluoride compounds, as these disrupt the formation of the structure of the layer according to the<br>
invention. By inorganic fluoride compounds are meant within the meaning of the invention<br>
fluoride compounds which can be partially or completely dissociated into simple fluoride ions<br>
(F ") or complex fluoride ions (e.g. HF2-, BF4-, SiF62- etc.), in aqueous media, in particular fluoride<br>
salts and fluoride-containing inorganic acids such as e.g. HF, HBF4, H2SiF6 and their salts, e.g.<br>
MIF, MIBF4, MI2SiF6, MIIF2, MII(BF4)2, MIISiF6, in which MI stands for alkali ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+,<br>
Cs+) and MII for alkaline-earth ions (Be2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+). The electrolyte preferably<br>
contains less than 0.25 g/l inorganic fluoride compounds, particularly preferably less than 0.1 g/l<br>
and most preferably less than 0.05 g/l inorganic fluoride compounds.<br>
The electrolyte can also contain customary electrolysis aids and catalysts which support<br>
chromium deposition. These may be present in the electrolyte in customary quantities.<br>
The current density in deposition step (b) is 20-100 A/dm2, preferably 30 - 80 A/dm2. The<br>
higher the chosen current density in the method according to the invention, the denser becomes<br>
the structure, i.e. the denser the depressions of the structured chromium solids particles layer<br>
become and the more space they occupy. Operations during polarity-reversal step (c) are<br>
preferably at a current density of 5 - 100 A/dm2, particularly preferably at a current density of 20<br>
- 80 A/dm2. During the method according to the invention the temperature can be 45 - 95Â°C,<br>
preferably 50 - 90Â°C, particularly preferably 60 - 80Â°C.<br>
The deposition duration is chosen depending on the desired thickness of the structured<br>
chromium solids particles layer, wherein the higher the current density and the current yield, the<br>
longer the deposition lasts and the more frequently steps (b) and (c) are repeated, the thicker<br>
the layer becomes. Deposition step (b) is preferably carried out for 5 - 240 minutes. Polarity-<br>
reversing step (c) is advantageously carried out for 5 - 600 s (seconds), depending on the<br>
current density in step (c) and the desired widening of the cracks. The polarity-reversing step is<br>
preferably carried out for 10 - 300 s, particularly preferably 30 - 90 s.<br>
A further important method parameter of the method according to the invention is the current<br>
yield. During an electrolytic deposition, as a rule only some of the current quantity used goes<br>
into metal deposition, the rest of the current quantity leads to losses, wherein primarily hydrogen<br>
is produced. By cathodic current yield, also called degree of efficiency, is meant the ratio of the<br>
current quantity leading to metal deposition to the total current quantity used. If, for example 100<br>
Ah is used, of which 25 Ah leads to metal deposition and 75 Ah is present as losses, the<br>
cathodic current yield is 25%.<br>
The current yield is as a rule optimized in the prior art towards as high a current yield as<br>
possible in order to achieve a high degree of efficiency. In the prior art the current yield during<br>
the deposition of electrolytic chromium layers is usually above approximately 15 %, frequently<br>
even above 20 %. In the method according to the invention, on the contrary, a lower current<br>
yield has proved necessary for the structure formation of the layer according to the invention.<br>
According to the invention the cathodic current yield is 12 % or less. If the current yield is<br>
higher, the desired structure of the hard chromium layer is not obtained. The current yield of the<br>
method according to the invention is preferably 8-12 %.<br>
The chromium solids particles layer itself can consist of several layers which are applied<br>
successively by repeating deposition step (b) and polarity-reversal step (c). If several layers are<br>
applied and particles are in each case introduced into the cracks of the individual layers, a<br>
coating can be obtained which has a better distribution of the solids particles in the coating both<br>
in its total thickness and also over its surface, as the cracks are not always formed at the same<br>
points.<br>
In order to achieve as uniform as possible a distribution of the cracks and thus of the solids<br>
particles in the layer according to the invention, steps (b) and (c) are therefore repeated,<br>
wherein depending on the intended use and the thickness of the desired structured chromium<br>
solids particles layer 1-100 repetitions, i.e. 2-101 cycles of steps (b) and (c) have proved<br>
favourable. Depending on the intended use the whole of the structured chromium solids<br>
particles layer has a layer thickness of approximately 20 - 800 Âµm. Layer thicknesses of 30 -<br>
500 Âµm are preferred, 50 - 300 Âµm particularly preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention the method concludes with<br>
a step of electrolyte deposition of chromium in order to re-seal the microcracks widened in the<br>
last polarity-reversal step (c) and filled with solids particles and thus fix the solids particles. It is<br>
particularly preferred that, at the end of the method after step (c), step (b) is also repeated. This<br>
method for the production of a structured chromium solids particles layer therefore comprises<br>
the steps that<br>
(a) a machine element is introduced into an electrolyte which contains<br>
a Cr(VI) compound in a quantity which corresponds to 100 g/l - 400 g/l chromic anhydride,<br>
1 - 8 g/l sulphuric acid,<br>
5 - 18 g/l aliphatic sulphonic acid with 1-6 carbon atoms,<br>
solids particles with a size from 0.01 - 10 Âµm and<br>
less than 0.5 g/l inorganic fluoride compounds,<br>
(b) a chromium-containing layer is electrolytically deposited on the machine element at a current<br>
density of 20-100 A/dm2 and a current yield of 12 % or less, then<br>
(c) the current direction is reversed, wherein the solids particles embed themselves in<br>
microcracks of the layer,<br>
steps (b) and (c) are optionally repeated, and then<br>
step (b) is repeated.<br>
As described above, the workpiece to be chromium-plated is cathodically connected during<br>
electrolysis. Hydrogen is formed at the cathode in the deposition step (b), metal deposition<br>
takes place and Cr(VI) is reduced to Cr(lll). Oxygen forms again at the anode, and an oxidation<br>
of Cr(lll) to Cr(VI) takes place. This oxidation of Cr(lll) to Cr(VI) takes place in particular at a<br>
PbO2 surface layer of the anode and a specific Cr(lll)/Cr(VI) ratio forms which depends on a<br>
series of parameters of the method, in particular on the composition and concentration of the<br>
electrolyte, the current density and the surface area ratio of anode to cathode (workpiece). For<br>
example, with otherwise unchanged conditions, an anode with a greater surface area can lead<br>
to a smaller Cr(lll) content. The chromium-plating electrolyte is as a rule used several times. In<br>
order to have a specific Cr(lll) content available immediately at the beginning of the method with<br>
a freshly-prepared electrolyte, a reductant, for example saccharose, can be added to the<br>
electrolyte.<br>
It has proved particularly favourable for the method according to the invention for a quick and<br>
uniform deposition of the structured chromium solids particles layer on the workpiece if the<br>
electrolyte contains Cr(lll) in a quantity which corresponds to 4 - 16 g/l Cr2O3. Additionally, the<br>
process is thus more stable overall. The electrolyte particularly preferably contains Cr(lll) in a<br>
quantity which corresponds to 8 - 12 g/l Cr2O3.<br>
To achieve a high wear resistance, hard material particles are preferably used as solids<br>
particles. By hard material particles are meant within the meaning of the invention particles of<br>
materials which have a Mohs' hardness of 9 or higher. Among these, hard material particles<br>
with a Mohs' hardness of 9.2-10 are preferred, and those with a Mohs' hardness of 9.4-10<br>
particularly preferred. The Mohs' hardness is determined according to the Mohs' hardness test<br>
known in the prior art.<br>
Preferred hard material particles are those comprising tungsten carbide, chromium carbide,<br>
aluminium oxide, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, boron carbide, cubic boron nitride and/or<br>
diamond.<br>
The quantity of solids particles which is contained in the electrolyte in the method according to<br>
the invention can be varied within wide ranges. It has proved advantageous that 0.1 - 200 g/l<br>
solids particles are contained in the electrolyte. Particularly preferably, 0.5 - 50 g/l solids<br>
particles and most preferably, 1 - 20 g/l solids particles are contained in the electrolyte.<br>
The particle size of the solids particles lies in the range of from 0.01 to 10 Âµm, preferably in the<br>
range of from 0.01 - 8 Âµm. Solids particles with a particle size in the range of from 0.1 - 5 Âµm<br>
are particularly preferred, and the particle size is most preferably 0.25 â 2 Âµm. Preferably above<br>
90 %, particularly preferably above 95 %, of the solids particles contained in the electrolyte lie<br>
within the above-named limits.<br>
The gap width of the cracks produced in step (c) of the method should be greater than the<br>
particle size and lies preferably above 0.02 Âµm, particularly preferably above 0.05 Âµm and most<br>
preferably above 0.1 Âµm.<br>
It is particularly preferred to use diamonds, aluminium oxide and/or silicon nitride particles as<br>
solids particles. The preferred size of diamond particles is 0.25 - 0.45 Âµm. The preferred size of<br>
aluminium oxide and silicon nitride particles is 0.1 - 5 Âµm.<br>
Embedded diamond particles have the advantage that at high thermal load stresses such as for<br>
example may occur with piston rings they lead to particularly good sliding properties. Diamond<br>
changes into graphite at higher temperatures and, when high pressures and inadequate<br>
lubrication coincide, the temperature for example of the contact surface of the piston ring can<br>
become so high that scorching occurs. Under these conditions, the diamond particles then<br>
advantageously change into graphite which then takes over lubrication tasks and thus prevents<br>
scorching. In addition to the good emergency running properties in the case of inadequate<br>
lubrication, which is attributable to the microstructure, in this way additional emergency running<br>
properties are achieved at high temperatures of approximately 700Â°C or higher.<br>
Embedded diamond particles can be formed from mono- and/or polycrystalline diamond. The<br>
better results are frequently achieved with polycrystalline diamond as, because of the many<br>
different crystals, a polycrystalline diamond has many sliding planes. Mixtures of solids particles<br>
or hard material particles of different types and/or size can also be used as solids particles or<br>
hard material particles.<br>
Furthermore, the cracks of the chromium solids particles layer may contain solid lubricant<br>
particles, solids particles to increase ductility and/or corrosion stability. By embedding further<br>
particles in addition to the solids materials particles, the layer can be further adapted for the<br>
respective application. Thus for example hexagonal boron nitride, graphite and/or polymer<br>
particles, in particular of polyethylene and/or polytetrafluoroethylene, can additionally be<br>
introduced into the cracks as solid lubricant particles. Ductile metals or metal alloys of tin,<br>
titanium or aluminium can be embedded to increase the ductility.<br>
By a structured chromium solids particles layer are meant within the meaning of the invention<br>
not only layers of pure chromium and solids particles, but also layers of chromium alloys, in<br>
particular with molybdenum, vanadium and zirconium. The invention thus also relates to<br>
structured chromium alloy solids particles layers. If the structured chromium solids particles<br>
layer is to be formed, not from pure chromium, but from an alloy, the alloy elements are<br>
dissolved as salts in the chromium-plating electrolyte and electroplated together with the<br>
chromium in the form of a chromium alloy. The alloy elements are present in the chromium layer<br>
preferably in quantities of 0.1 - 30 wt.-% (weight percent), particularly preferably 0.5 - 15 wt.-%.<br>
Such layers are frequently more wear-resistant compared with pure chromium layers.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, to produce chromium/molybdenum, chromium/vanadium and/or<br>
chromium/zirconium alloy layers which contain solids particles and are structured, 10 g/l to 200<br>
g/l of at least one compound forming a dense cathode film, selected from ammonium<br>
molybdate, alkali molybdate, alkaline-earth molybdate, ammonium vanadate, alkali vanadate,<br>
alkaline-earth vanadate, ammonium zirconate, alkali zirconate and alkaline-earth zirconate, can<br>
be contained in the electrolyte as additional component. Li+, Na+ and K+ can be used as alkali<br>
ions. Examples of alkaline-earth ions are Mg2+ and Ca2+. The named component forms a dense<br>
cathode film during electrolytic deposition, as described in WO 2004/050960. In a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment the component is (NH4)6MO7O24-4 H2O, which is particularly favourable<br>
for the formation of the structured chromium solids particles layer.<br>
If a chromium solids particles layer not alloyed with molybdenum, vanadium or zirconium is to<br>
be produced, the electrolyte preferably does not contain any of the above-named compounds<br>
forming a dense cathode film. In a further preferred embodiment the electrolyte does not thus<br>
contain a compound selected from ammonium molybdate, alkali molybdate, alkaline-earth<br>
molybdate, ammonium vanadate, alkali vanadate, alkaline-earth vanadate, ammonium<br>
zirconate, alkali zirconate and alkaline-earth zirconate.<br>
If the structured chromium solids particles layer consists of at least two layers, the individual<br>
layers may have alloy constituents at different levels or completely different constituents. This<br>
can be suitably chosen depending on the requirements to be met by the layer or the machine<br>
element to be coated.<br>
If the structured chromium solids particles layer is formed such that the at least two chromium-<br>
layer have a different crystal structure, the intrinsic strength of the layer can be further<br>
improved. The chromium is deposited from the electrolyte at the cathodically connected<br>
machine element to produce at least one layer of hard chromium, with the result that several<br>
strata of hard chromium with a different crystallization form are deposited in the chromium layer<br>
corresponding to the current density. After depositing each phase of a layer, the machine<br>
element is anodically connected with the result that the network of cracks in the hard chromium<br>
widens and is filled with the solids particles. The layers of varying crystal structure are deposited<br>
preferably alternately one above the other.<br>
The invention also relates to a structured chromium solids particles layer obtainable according<br>
to the above-described method.<br>
The structured chromium solids particles layer according to the invention has a network of<br>
cracks in which solids particles are embedded in the cracks, the crack density is 10 - 250 /mm,<br>
the particle size of the solids particles is in the range of from 0.01 - 10 Âµm, the proportion of<br>
solids particles in the overall layer is 1 - 30 vol.-% and the chromium solids particles layer has<br>
depressions in the surface of the layer, wherein the proportion of the surface area accounted for<br>
by the depressions is 5 - 80 %.<br>
By a microstructure is meant within the meaning of the invention a microscopic structure which<br>
lies in the urn range. The surface comprises projecting areas (load-bearing portion of the<br>
surface) and recessed areas (depressions, troughs). Unlike other structures known from the<br>
prior art which have a spherical structure with spheres passing into one another, the structure of<br>
the layer according to the invention can be paraphrased as a structure with insular depressions.<br>
The depressions are preferably designed cup-shaped and/or labyrinthine and/or columnar. This<br>
microstructure has proved particularly wear-, scorch- and corrosion-resistant and shows an<br>
outstanding lubricant-retention capacity of the surface, from which outstanding sliding and<br>
emergency running properties result. The lubricant-retention capacity of the surface is<br>
essentially caused by the particular microstructure in the depressions of which some lubricant is<br>
fixed, and not by the network of cracks of the layer, as the cracks can be sealed in the course of<br>
the method and thus can absorb no, or only insignificant quantities of, lubricant.<br>
In order to achieve a high wear- and scorch resistance of the layer according to the invention, a<br>
proportion of 1 to 30 vol.-% (per cent by volume) of solids particles in the chromium solids<br>
particles layer has proved favourable. Preferably, the proportion of solids particles in the<br>
chromium solids particles layer is 1 - 20 vol.-%, particularly preferably 2 to 10 vol.-%, relative to<br>
the volume of the whole chromium solids particles layer.<br>
It has also proved favourable if the crack density is 10 - 250 /mm, as an advantageous<br>
distribution of the solids particles is thus achieved in the layer according to the invention. The<br>
crack density is the number of cracks cut on average by a 1 mm line. Crack densities of 30 -<br>
200 /mm are particularly preferred and crack densities of 50-100 /mm are most preferred. The<br>
network of cracks preferably extends through the whole chromium solids particles layer<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The proportion of the surface area accounted for by the depressions is, according to the<br>
invention, 5-80 %. The proportion of the surface area accounted for by the depressions is<br>
ascertained in a top view looking onto the surface of the layer according to the invention (cf.<br>
Figs. 1-3) by determining the proportion of the surface which consists of depressions, relative to<br>
the total surface area. Microstructures in which the proportion of the surface area accounted for<br>
by the depressions is 10-70 %, in particular 15-60 %, have proved particularly favourable.<br>
An increased proportion of the surface area accounted for by the depressions can result from a<br>
larger number of individual depressions per surface unit of the surface area or from individual<br>
depressions occupying more space or depressions combining. Labyrinthine structures result<br>
from depressions joining together, as can be seen in Fig. 1. The total surface area is the sum of<br>
the surface area of the depressions and the surface area of the bearing area (load-bearing<br>
portion of the surface). The load-bearing portion of the surface is accordingly 20 - 95 %,<br>
preferably 30 - 90 % and particularly preferably 40 - 85 %.<br>
The chromium solids particles layer according to the invention has structures in the microrange.<br>
It has proved advantageous if the layer according to the invention has an average of 3 to 100<br>
depressions with a maximum extension of more than 30 urn per square millimetre (mm2) of the<br>
surface area. The maximum extension of a depression is the maximum size of a depression,<br>
measured from edge to edge of a depression, wherein the edge of a depression is the transition<br>
from the projecting area to the recessed area (depression). This transition can be seen in the<br>
bright colouring in Figures 1-3. For example, a depression 10 Âµm wide and 40 urn long would<br>
fall under the above definition of depressions with a maximum extension of more than 30 Âµm,<br>
while a depression 20 Âµm wide and 20 Âµm long would not fall under this definition. With<br>
labyrinthine structures, such as are shown in Fig. 3, the maximum extension is measured over a<br>
straight line from one end to the other end of the labyrinthine depression.<br>
Preferably, the average number of depressions with a maximum extension of more than 30 Âµm<br>
is 5 - 90 /mm2 surface area, particularly preferably 8-80 /mm2 surface area and most<br>
preferably 12 - 60/mm2 surface area. Furthermore, it is preferred that the proportion of the<br>
surface area accounted for by the depressions with a maximum extension of more than 30 Âµm<br>
is 5 - 80 %, relative to the total surface area of the structured chromium solids particles layer.<br>
The proportion of the surface area accounted for by the depressions with a maximum extension<br>
of more than 30 Âµm is particularly preferably 10 - 70%, in particular 15-60 %. The<br>
depressions with a maximum extension of more than 30 Âµm are preferably more than 3 Âµm,<br>
particularly preferably more than 5 Âµm and most preferably more than 10 Âµm deep.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the average minimum distance between adjacent depressions is 10<br>
- 150 Âµm. By average minimum distance between adjacent depressions is meant the average<br>
of the smallest distance between adjacent depressions. The distance is the section from the<br>
edge of one depression to the edge of the next depression.<br>
The network of cracks of the layer according to the invention consists of microcracks whereby<br>
within the meaning of the invention microscopic cracks in the nm to urn range are meant, in<br>
particular cracks of which the gap width lies in the range of from approximately 0.01 - 20 Âµm.<br>
A proportion of the surface area of the cracks can also be ascertained by electrolytic or<br>
chemical etching of the layer according to the invention. However, as the proportion of the<br>
surface area depends on the intensity and duration of the etching process, the proportion of the<br>
surface area of the cracks can vary within a wide range and is as a rule 2-30 %.<br>
Furthermore, with the structured chromium solids particles layer according to the invention, the<br>
suitable, preferred, and particularly preferred versions described above in connection with the<br>
method according to the invention are likewise suitable, preferred, and particularly preferred.<br>
The invention also relates to a coated machine element, in particular a piston ring, with a<br>
surface comprising a structured chromium solids particles layer applied to the surface. With the<br>
coated machine element, the above-described suitable, preferred and particularly preferred<br>
versions of the invention are likewise suitable, preferred and particularly preferred. The coated<br>
machine element according to the invention has the advantages described above in connection<br>
with the structured chromium solids particles layer according to the invention.<br>
The structured chromium solids particles layer of the present invention can be applied directly to<br>
a machine element or to one or more layers which were previously applied to the machine<br>
element.<br>
By a layer applied "to" a surface or a layer is meant within the meaning of the invention both a<br>
layer applied directly to the surface or the layer and also a layer applied to an interim layer. A<br>
layer C applied "to" a layer A is thus present with a layer structure A, C and with a layer<br>
structure A, B, C, wherein B is the intermediate layer and A the layer facing the machine<br>
element.<br>
For example, a customary chromium layer, a structured hard chromium layer (without solids<br>
particle) or a non-structured chromium solids particles layer can be found beneath the<br>
structured chromium solids particles layer according to the invention. A structured hard<br>
chromium layer described for example in WO 2004/050960 A1 or WO 2005/108648 A2 can be<br>
applied as structured chromium solids particles layer and a layer described in EP 0217126 A1<br>
or WO 2001/004386 A1 as non-structured chromium solids layer.<br>
One or more layers can be applied onto the structured chromium solids particles layer<br>
according to the invention. The above-described layers also come into consideration for this, in<br>
particular a particle-free structured hard chromium layer and a non-structured chromium solids<br>
particles layer.<br>
A running-in layer which makes the running-in of the machine element easier can be applied to<br>
the structured chromium solids particles layer according to the invention. This is preferable in<br>
particular when using the layer according to the invention on piston rings, because thus the<br>
running-in phase of the piston rings can be shortened and the oil consumption and emissions<br>
during running-in of the engine reduced.<br>
Particularly preferred running-in layers are PVD and CVD layers.<br>
By a PVD layer is meant within the meaning of the invention a layer deposited by PVD (physical<br>
vapor deposition) on a machine element. PVD methods are known per se to a person skilled in<br>
the art. The basic layer material is evaporated by laser, ion or electron beams or by arc<br>
discharge, mostly under reduced pressure, at approximately 1-1000 Pa, vaporized, and the<br>
PVD layer formed by condensation of the material vapor on the substrate. If necessary a<br>
suitable process gas can also be applied.<br>
By a CVD layer is meant within the meaning of the invention a layer deposited on a machine<br>
element by CVD (chemical vapor deposition). CVD methods are known per se to a person<br>
skilled in the art. With a CVD method a solid from the gas phase is deposited on the heated<br>
surface of a substrate by a chemical reaction. As a rule, CVD methods are also carried out<br>
under reduced pressure, at approximately 1-1000 Pa.<br>
According to the invention, all coatings obtainable by PVD or CVD methods are suitable as PVD<br>
or CVD layers. Preferred PVD or CVD layers are DLC (diamond-like carbon) layers. These are<br>
layers of amorphous carbon which can be deposited by PVD or CVD methods from a carbon-<br>
containing gas. These can be deposited in particular by PVD or PECVD (plasma-enhanced<br>
chemical vapor deposition) methods. More preferably, PVD or CVD layers comprise titanium<br>
nitride compounds or chromium nitride compounds, in particular titanium nitrides of the formula<br>
TiNx, titanium nitride compounds of the formula TiNxAy, chromium nitrides of the formula CrNx<br>
and chromium nitride compounds of the formula CrNxAy, in which A stands for carbon (C), boron<br>
(B), oxygen (O) and/or hard material-forming elements such as for example silicon (Si),<br>
vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), tungsten (W), aluminium (Al), tantalum (Ta), zirconium (Zr) etc. and<br>
x and y, independently of one another, are 0.1 to 1.5. Preferably, x and y, independently of one<br>
another, are 0.3-1.2, particularly preferably 0.5 to 1. For example, titanium nitride (TiNx),<br>
titanium carbonitride (TiCyNx), titanium oxide nitride (TiOyNx), titanium aluminium nitride<br>
(TiAlyNx), chromium nitride (CrNx), chromium carbonitride (CrCyNx), chromium oxide nitride<br>
(CrOyNx), chromium aluminium nitride (CrAlyNx) or also multi-element compounds such as for<br>
example chromium aluminium silicon nitrides, chromium aluminium zirconium nitrides or<br>
chromium aluminium silicon zirconium nitrides, can be used, in particular those of formulae<br>
CrAlaSibNx, CrAlaZrbNx or CrAlaSibZrcNx, in which a, b, c and x, independently of one another, are<br>
0.1 to 1.5, preferably 0.1-1.2, particularly preferably 0.2-1. In the multi-layer arrangement<br>
according to the invention chromium nitride compounds which can contain the above further<br>
elements are particularly preferably used as PVD or CVD layer. The PVD or CVD layer<br>
particularly preferably consists of the above-named compounds.<br>
The layer thickness of the PVD or CVD layer is preferably 5-80 Âµm, particularly preferably 5-60 Âµm, yet more preferably 5-40 Âµm and most preferably 10-30 Âµm. As the PVD or CVD layer is<br>
applied to a structured layer, also meant within the meaning of the invention by a PVD or CVD<br>
layer, is a deposited PVD or CVD material which completely or partially fills the depressions of<br>
the structured layer lying below and in the process completely or only partially covers the<br>
structured layer lying above or merely completely or partially fills the depressions of the<br>
structured layer lying below without forming a continuous layer within the meaning of a complete<br>
covering, is also meant. The layer thickness is, in the last-named case, the mean value from the<br>
fill level of the depressions.<br>
A coating of at least two layers which comprises the structured chromium solids particles layer<br>
according to the invention and a running-in layer on top of that is particularly preferred.<br>
After the running-in of such two-layer coating, the surface is formed from the elevations of the<br>
structured chromium solids particles layer and the solids particles as well as the running-in layer<br>
remaining in the depressions of the structure, and thus particularly advantageous properties of<br>
the then run-in layer achieved.<br>
It is understood that the features named above and to be further explained below can be used<br>
not only in the given combinations but also in other combinations or alone, without exceeding<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
The current yield in steps 1 and 3 is 8 %. The Cr(lll) content corresponds to 9 g/l Cr2O3. Steps 1<br>
and 2 are repeated five times.<br>
Comparison example 1:<br>
Production of a structured hard chromium layer according to WO 2004/050960 A1.<br>
A chromium electrolyte of the following composition is produced:<br><br>
A piston ring is introduced after customary pre-treatment into the electrolyte and coated at 55Â°C<br>
with 40 A/dm2 for 30 min with a cathodic current yield of 8.5 %.<br>
The piston ring has a structured chromium layer after the treatment. This chromium layer is<br>
glossy on the projecting surface regions (bearing area) and a brown cathode film is located in<br>
the depressions of the structure.<br>
Comparison example 2:<br>
Coating with an unstructured chromium-diamond layer according to WO 2001/004386 A1.<br>
A piston ring is introduced into a crack-forming electrolyte which contains the following<br>
constituents:<br>
250 g/l CrO3 chromic acid<br>
1.5 g/l H2SO4 sulphuric acid<br>
10 g/l K2SiF6 potassium hexafluorosilicate<br>
50 g/l monocrystalline diamond particles with an average particle size of 0.2 to 0.4 Âµm are<br>
dispersed therein by stirring and kept suspended during chromium plating. Chromium plating<br>
takes place at a temperature of 60Â°C. Firstly, the piston ring to be chromium-plated is<br>
cathodically connected in a first stage and chromium-plated at a current density of 65 A/dm3 and<br>
a current yield of 23 % over 8 minutes. In a second stage, polarity is reversed and the network<br>
of cracks of the previously-deposited chromium layer widened by anodic connection of the<br>
machine element at a current density of 60 A/dm3 over a minute and filled with diamond<br>
particles. This cycle, namely 8 min cathodic chromium plating and 1 min anodic etching, is<br>
repeated five times in total.<br>
Comparison example 3:<br>
Structured hard chromium layer with chromium diamond particles layer arranged above<br>
According to the above procedure according to comparison example 1, a piston ring is firstly<br>
provided with a structured hard chromium layer and then, according to the above procedure<br>
according to comparison example 2, with an unstructured chromium-diamond particles layer.<br>
The chromium-diamond particles layer partly assumes the structure of the hard chromium layer<br>
lying below.<br>
The scorch resistance, the wear resistance and the sliding properties of the correspondingly<br>
coated piston rings were then determined. For this, the piston rings were then left to run at full<br>
load under motor conditions on a motor test bench for 1000 hours in a 6-cylinder turbo diesel<br>
engine. The scorch- and wear resistance were determined with the help of simulation test<br>
machines (scorch-mark tester and wear tester both from Plint). The sliding properties were<br>
evaluated with reference to the topology of the surface of the coated piston ring. In the Table,<br>
++ means very good, + good and 0 average.<br><br>
As can be seen in the above Table, the structured chromium diamond particles layer according<br>
to the invention according to example 1 displays the outstandingly low wear, i.e. the very good<br>
wear resistance, of a chromium diamond particles layer, and also shows outstanding scorch<br>
resistance and the very good sliding properties of a structured hard chromium layer.<br>
