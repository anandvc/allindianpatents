				<td>ADescription<br>
The invention relates to a method and equipment for rolling a metal strip by means of a cold-rolling mill, which is followed by an annealing section and a cold-finishing part. It has been shown that it is difficult to achieve the desired material hardness in the case of rolling mills of this type.<br>
Accordingly, it is the object of the invention to specify a method and equipment by means of which the desired material hardness may be achieved precisely. In the process, it is also desirable to achieve the desired value for the thickness of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-finishing part.<br>
According  to  the  invention,  the  object  is<br>
achieved by a method  and equipment<br>
the features of fhe-invention according  to  -14.  The  exit  thickness  or the<br>
intended thickness of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-rolling mill is determined as a function of the intended hardness and of the intended thickness at the exit from the cold-finishing part. In thlk way, it is possible to achieve the desired intended hardness as the rolled strip runs out of the cold-finishing part. In this case, in a particularly advantageous refinement of the invention, the effect of the cold-finishing part, in particular the relationship between hardness of the metal strip and thickness reduction of the metal strip, as well as the effect of the annealing section, in particular on the material hardness, are taken into account. According to this particularly advantageous refinement of the invention, whilst taking into account the reduction in the material hardness in the annealing section and taking into account the relationship between the hardness of the metal strip and the thickness reduction of the metal strip in the cold-finishing part, the thickness of the rolled strip at the exit from the cold-roll ing mill is predefined in<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
such a way that, during the thickness reduction of the metal strip in the cold-finishing part to the desired intended thickness of the metal strip, the desired intended hardness is also established. It has been shown that the precision in reaching the desired intended hardness of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-finishing part may be improved considerably in this way.<br>
In an additionally advantageous refinement of the invention, the effect of the cold-finishing part, that is to say in particular the relationship between hardness of the metal strip and thickness reduction of the metal strip, is ascertained from the effect of the cold-rolling mill, that is to say in particular from the relationship between hardness of the metal strip and thickness reduction of the metal strip in the cold-rolling mill. The modelling of the relationship between thickness reduction of the metal strip and material hardness is carried out on the basis of the relationships between thickness reduction of the metal strip and material hardness at the roll stands of the cold-rolling mill or at some selected roll stands of the cold-rolling mill.<br>
In an alternative advantageous refinement for this purpose, the effect of the cold-finishing part, in particular the relationship between hardness of the metal strip and the thickness reduction of the metal strip, is determined in advance, in particular by means of tensile tests.<br>
In an additionally advantageous refinement, the ascertained effect of the cold-finishing part, in particular the ascertained relationship between hardness of the metal strip and thickness reduction of the metal strip, is corrected by comparing a measured value of the current hardness with the intended hardness of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-finishing part, with the effect of reducing the deviation  between  the  intended  hardness  and  the<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
measured value of the current hardness of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-finishing part.<br>
In an additionally advantageous refinement, the intended value for the thickness or the intended thickness of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-rolling mill, this value being ascertained from the effect of the cold-finishing part, in particular from the relationship between hardness of the metal strip and thickness reduction of the metal strip, is corrected by comparing the current hardness and the intended hardness of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-finishing part, with the effect of reducing the deviation between the intended hardness and the current hardness of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-finishing part.<br>
By means of these measures, relating to precise modelling of the relationship between hardness of the metal strip and thickness reduction of the metal strip, the desired intended hardness is achieved particularly well. If no measured values for the hardness of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-finishing part are available, then the current values are advantageously  ascertained  by  means  of  inverse<br>
modelling,    for<br>
ascertaining  the  current  values   for  the  model adaptation.<br>
The method according to the invention is particularly advantageously applied in achieving a constant material hardness over the entire length of the metal strip, as a result of which scrap is prevented to a great extent.<br>
In an advantageous refinement of the invention, the thickness of the metal strip is reduced by at least 10%, in particular by at least 20%, in the cold-finishing part. Furthermore, it is particularly advantageous to reduce the thickness of the metal strip by 20 to 40% in the cold-finishing part.<br>
Further advantages and inventive details emerge from   the   following   description   of   exemplary<br><br>
	- 4 -<br>
accompanying embodiments, using the/drawings and in conjunction with<br>
 In detail:<br>
FIG 1   shows a rolling mill according to the invention FIG 2   shows the determination of a correction factor<br>
according to the invention FIG 3   shows  a  method  for  achieving  a  constant<br>
hardness over the length of the metal strip.<br>
FIG 1 shows a rolling mill for implementing the method according to the invention. A cold-rolling mill 2 having, by way of example, four roll stands 21, 22, 23, 24 is followed by an annealing section 3 and a cold-finishing part 4. A metal strip, which, for example, runs out of a hot-rolling mill 1, runs into the cold-rolling mill 2 in the exemplary embodiment according to FIG 1, and is further reduced. It is then annealed in the annealing section 3 and cold-finished in the cold-finishing part 4 and, according to the invention, has its thickness reduced. The relationships, illustrated in the functional blocks 5, 6 and 7, show the change in the material hardness in the cold-rolling mill 2, in the annealing section 3 and in the cold-finishing part 4. A metal strip with a thickness HEKTM and a hardness KF0 runs into the cold-rolling mill 2 and runs out of the cold-rolling mill 2 with the thickness HAKTM and the hardness KFKTM. Functional block 5 shows the physical relationship between material hardness KF and thickness reduction EPS of the metal strip. In this case, the thickness reduction EPS is defined as<br>
EPS = 1_  HE_ HA<br>
where HE is the entry thickness and HA is the exit thickness of the metal strip. In the annealing section 3, the material hardness KF decreases as a function of the thickness reduction of the metal strip in the cold-rolling mill, as functional block 6 shows. In the process, the material thickness remains unchanged, that is to say HAKTM = HEDCR. After passing through the annealing section 3, the metal strip has the material<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
hardness KF0. In the present exemplary embodiment, the<br>
cold-finishing part 4 has two roll stands 41 and 42. In<br>
an advantageous refinement of the invention, the rolled<br>
strip is essentially reduced by means of the first roll<br>
stand 41, By means of the second roll stand 42, the<br>
desired surface condition and flatness of the rolled<br>
strip are achieved. The rolled strip, which runs into<br>
the cold-finishing part 4 with the strip thickness HEDCR<br>
and material hardness KF0,  runs out with the strip<br>
thickness HADCR and the material  hardness  KFDCR,  as<br>
functional block 7 shows. According to the method of<br>
the invention, the pair of values HAKTM and KFKTM is set,<br>
in  accordance  with  the  relationships  according  to<br>
functional blocks 6 and 7,  in such a way that the<br>
desired values for the exit thickness HADCR and the<br>
material hardness KFDCR are achieved by means of the<br>
thickness reduction in the cold-finishing part 4. If,<br>
for example, a rolled strip has the thickness HEKTM of<br>
4 mm and the hardness KF0 of 300 N/mm2 at the entry to<br>
the cold-rolling mill,  and if the desired thickness<br>
HADCR of the metal strip is 0.3 mm and the desired<br>
hardness KFDCR of the metal strip is 450 N/mm2, then for<br>
an exemplary configuration, the metal strip is to be<br>
rolled in the cold-rolling mill 3 in such a way that<br>
HAKTM = 0.5 mm and KFKTM = 600 N/mm . In the subsequent<br>
annealing section 3, the hardness of the metal strip is<br>
in turn reduced to the hardness KF0, that is to say<br>
300 N/mm . As a result of the subsequent reduction of<br>
the metal strip in the cold-finishing part 4 from an<br>
entry thickness HEDCR of 0.5 mm to an exit thickness<br>
HADCR of°-3 mm,the hardness KFDCR of the metal strip at<br>
the exit from the cold-finishing part 4 is increased to<br>
the  desired  450 N/mm2.  The  limits  of  the  method<br>
according to the  invention depend on the possible<br>
reduction  in  the  cold-finishing  part 4.  If,  for     <br>
example,  taking into account a material strength or  <br>
hardness model (with MSO ~ KFO,  <br>
MSI ~ KFI and KFE ~ MSE)	<br><br><br><br>
- 6 -<br><br>
then, given the reduction variation in the_ cold-finishing part of 10 ... 40%, a hardness variation of about 3 5% can be achieved. For this case, a variation in the entry thickness HDDCR from 0.33 to 0.5 mm in the cold-finishing part 4 is possible. This variation permits a change in the material strength KFDCR from 330 N/mm2 to 440 N/mm2.<br>
For the modelling, illustrated schematically, according to the functional blocks 5 and 7, a model  comes particularly advantageously into consideration. Furthermore, it has proven to be advantageous to transfer the model for the relationship between material hardness KF and thickness reduction EPS for the cold-rolling mill to the cold-finishing part 4 as well. In this case, the relationship, ascertained for the cold-rolling mill, between hardness KF of the metal strip and thickness reduction EPS of the metal strip is particularly advantageously corrected by comparing the current hardness and the intended hardness at the exit of the metal strip from the cold-finishing part 4, with the effect of reducing the deviation between intended hardness and current hardness at the exit from the cold-finishing part 4. A correction of this type is shown by FIG 2. The setting of the material strength in the cold-finishing part can be carried out in accordance with the following automation stages:<br>
1.	Feed-forward control 8 as a result of calculating<br>
and rolling an exit thickness HADCR in the cold-<br>
rolling mill in accordance with the desired value<br>
for the hardness VKFDCR and the thickness HADCR of<br>
the metal strip after the cold-finishing part 4.<br>
2.	Feedback  9  as  a  result  of  ascertaining  the<br>
achieved hardness KFDCR in the cold-finishing part<br><br>
	- 7 -<br>
4 and forming a correction value a for the thickness HAKTM of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-rolling mill 2 in accordance with the deviations from the desired value for KFDCR. 3. Ascertaining the material strength curve, that is to say the relationship between hardness KF of the metal strip and thickness reduction EPS, in the cold-rolling mill 2 over the length of the strip, and calculating and rolling the strip thickness HAKTM over the length of the strip in accordance with the ascertained material strength curve and the intended value for the hardness KFDCR of the metal strip.<br>
In detail, the exit thickness HAKTM of the metal strip is calculated in the feed-forward controller 8 in accordance with the desired hardness KFDCR of the metal strip. This is carried out as a function of the thickness of the metal strip HADCR at the exit from the cold-finishing part, the hardness KFDCR of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-finishing part, the thickness HEKTM of the metal strip at the entry to the cold-rolling mill, and of material properties MT of the rolled strip. The starting variables for the feedforward controller 8 are the thickness . HAKTM of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-rolling mill, and material parameters ME of 'the metal strip. These material parameters ME are essentially parameters which describe the hardness KFDCR of the metal strip. In the present example,  they are the parameters KFO, KFI and KFE, which describe the relationship between hardness KFDCR Of the metal strip and thickness reduction of the   <br>
metal strip. <br>
values tor tnickness-HADCR and hardness KFDCR of the   metal  strip,  the  feedback  unit  9  ascertains  a   correction value a,  with which the value  for the thickness HAKTM of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-rolling mill is corrected. It has proven to be particularly advantageous to multiply the correction<br><br>
	- 8 -<br>
parameter a and the desired thickness HAKTM of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-rolling mill. The correction parameter a is formed in such a way that the deviation between the current thickness HADCR of the metal strip at the exit from the cold-finishing part and the corresponding intended value is minimized.<br>
The more rapid cooling down of the outer and inner windings after the hot-rolling mill results in a higher strength of the ends of the strip. Even intermediate annealing after the cold-rolling mill is not able to eliminate this effect, as is shown by the curve 13 in FIG 3, in which the course of the hardness KF0 of the metal strip over the length BL of the metal strip is illustrated. In the case of deep-drawing material, in particular, it is generally necessary for these ends to be cut off following cold finishing, since the hardness KFDCR of the metal strip is intended to be constant over the length of the strip. In this case, the high proportion of scrap and the additional outlay lead to a high loading of the costs J Increases of up to 15% in material hardness occur; This increase in" material hardness decreases gradually over a strip length of about 50 m. Given an increase in material hardness of 15%, tne reduction EPSDCR in the cold-finishing part is reduced, according to the invention, by about 15%. This takes place particularly advantageously if the overall reduction EPSDCR is greater than 30%. In the case of the example cited above, a 15% change in the reduction means a change in the entry thickness of 50 jxm or 6%.<br>
The curves 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 in FIG 3 illustrate the use of the method according to the invention for achieving a constant hardness KF over the length of the metal strip. At the exit from the cold-rolling mill, the metal strip has a hardness KF0 corresponding to curve 13. At the ends of the strip, that is to say in the regions 10 and 12, the metal strip has a greater hardness than in the middle region. The regions 10 and 12 may comprise,  for example,  a<br><br>
strip length of 50 m each. According to the invention, the cold-rolling mill is adjusted in such a way that the metal strip has a thickness corresponding to curve 14 at the exit from the cold-rolling mill. The course of the curve 14 is selected such that, given a thickness reduction EPSDCR in the cold-finishing part, as shown by curve 15, a constant course of the thickness HADCR and of the hardness KFDCR of the metal strip is established, according to the curves 16 and 17.<br><br>
