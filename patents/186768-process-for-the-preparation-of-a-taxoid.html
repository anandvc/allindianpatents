Still more especially, the present invention relates to processes for the preparation of taxoids of general formula (I) in which Z represents a hydrogen atom or a radical of general formula (II) in which Rx represents a benzoyl radical or a radical Ra-O-CO- in which Rj represents a tert-butyl radical and R3 represents an isobutyl, isobutenyl, butenyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl or 5-thiazolyl radical, either R4 represents a hydrogen atom, R6 and R7 together form a ketone function and R and R5 together form a bond, or R4 represents a hydroxyl radical, R5 represents a hydrogen atom, R6 represents a hydrogen atom and R and R7 together form a bond.<br>
The taxoids of general formula (I) in which Z represents a radical of general formula (II) display noteworthy antitumour and antileukaemic properties.<br>
According to the invention, the taxoids of general formula (I) may be obtained by a process comprising:<br>
(a)  reacting a reducing agent, of the kind<br><br>
such as herein described, with a 9,10-diketo taxoid of general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Z1  represents a hydrogen atom or a group protecting the hydroxyl function or a radical of general formula:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Rx and R3 are defined as above and R8 represents a group protecting the hydroxyl function, and X represents, with the oxygen atom to which it is linked, a leaving group chosen from alkylsulphonyl radicals containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms, or arylsulphonyl radicals in which the aryl portion is a phenyl radical optionally substituted by one or more identical or different atoms or radicals chosen from halogen atoms and alkyl radicals containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or nitro or trifluoromethyl radicals, to obtain a compound of general formula:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Zp R, R4, R6, R6 and R,, are as defined above, in the form of a mixture of a taxoid of general formula (I) in which R4 represents a hydrogen atom, R6 and R, together form a ketone function, and R and R6 together form a bond, and of a taxoid of general formula (I) in which R4 represents a hydroxyl radical, R6 represents a hydrogen atom, R6 represents a hydrogen atom, and R and Ry together form a bond;<br>
b)	separating the thus obtained mixture by the usual methods, such as those herein described;<br>
c)	if necessary, replacing by a hydrogen atom the protective group represented by Zx or R6, in a manner such as herein described;<br>
thereby to obtain a taxoid of the formula (I).<br><br>
Generally, the reducing agent is chosen from aluminohydrides or borohydrides such as alkali or alkaline-earth metal borohydrides, such as sodium borohydride, in the presence of an aliphatic alcohol containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as ethanol, the reaction being carried out at a temperature of between 0 and 50°C, preferably about 20°C.<br>
Preferably, the protective group represented by R6 is chosen<br>
from groups which can be easily introduced and easily removed<br>
without affecting the rest of the molecule, such as silylated radicals<br>
such as the triethylsilyl radical. The replacement of theprotective group by a hydrogen atom, when it represents a silylated radical, is generally performed by means of an inoR6anic acid such as hydrochloric acid in an aliphatic alcohol containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, at a temperature of between -10 and 20°C, preferably about 0°C, or in the presence of a source of fluoride ions such as a hydrofluoric acid-triethylamine complex, working in an inert oR6anic solvent such as a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane at a temperature of between 0 and 50°C, preferably about 20°C.<br>
This process generally leads to a mixture of a taxoid of general formula (I) in which R4 represents a hydrogen atom, R6 and R7 together form a ketone function, and R and R5 together form a bond, and of a taxoid of general formula (I) in which R4 represents a hydroxyl radical, R5 represents a hydrogen atom, R6 represents a hydrogen atom and R and R7 together form a bond, which are separated by the usual methods such as chromatography.<br>
The compound of general formula (III) may be obtained by the action of an oxidizing agent on a compound of general formula:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Zx and X are as defined above.<br>
Generally, the oxidizing agent is chosen from agents which make it possible to oxidize the secondary alcohol function without affecting the rest of the molecule, such as for example oxygen, ammonium peruthenate, manganese dioxide, copper acetate or pyridinium chlorochromate. Preferably, pyridinium chlorochromate is used, working in an oR6anic solvent such as optionally halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, at a temperature of between 0 and 50°C, preferably about 25°C.<br>
The compound of general formula (VI) in which Z1  and X are as defined above may be obtained by the action of a sulphonyl halide on a compound of general formula:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Zx  is as defined above.<br>
The compound of general formula (VI) in which X preferably represents a trifluoromethy1sulphonyl radical may be obtained by the action of a derivative of trifluoromethanesulphonic acid such as the anhydride or N-phenyl trifluoromethanesulphonimide in an inert oR6anic solvent such as an optionally halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, working in the presence of an oR6anic base such as pyridine or a tertiary aliphatic amine such as triethylamine, at a temperature of between -50 and 20°C, on a compound of<br><br>
general formula (VII).<br>
The compound of general formula (VII) in which Z1  represents a radical of general formula (IV), in which R8 is defined as above, may be obtained by the action of a silylating agent on a compound of general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Rx and R3 are defined as above.<br>
Generally, a trialkylsilyl halide such as triethylsilyl chloride is used, working in an optionally halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, in the presence of an oR6anic base such as pyridine or a tertiary aliphatic amine such as triethylamine.<br>
The compound of general formula (VIII) in which R3 represents a phenyl radical and Rx represents a tert-butyl radical is known by the name of docetaxel. The docetaxel derivatives which correspond to the general formula (VIII) may be obtained under the conditions described in International Applications PCT WO 92/09589, WO 93/16060 and WO 94/12484.<br>
The compound of general formula (VII) in which Zx represents a hydrogen atom is 10-deactylbaccatin III which is extracted in a known manner from yew (Taxus baccata) leaves.<br>
According to the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) may also be obtained by<br><br>
esterification of a compound of general formula (I) in which Z represents a hydrogen atom by means of an acid of general formula:<br>
in which, either R9 represents a hydrogen atom and R10 represents a group protecting the hydroxyl function, or R9 and R10 together form a saturated 5- or 6-membered heterocycle, or by means of a derivative of this acid, followed by the replacement of the group R10 and, where necessary, R9 by hydrogen atoms.<br>
The conditions for esterification and replacement of the protective groups are identical to those which are described, for example, in International Applications PCT WO 92/09589, WO 93/16060 and WO 94/12484.<br>
The taxoids of general formula (I) obtained by carrying out the processes according to the invention may be purified according to known methods such as crystallization or chromatography.<br>
The taxoids of general formula (I) in which Z represents a radical of general formula (II) display noteworthy biological properties.<br>
In vitro.   measurement of the biological activity is performed on tubulin extracted from pig's brain by the method of M.L. Shelanski et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 7_0, 765-768 (1973). Study of the depolymerization of microtubules to tubulin is performed according to the method of 6. Chauviere et al., C.R. Acad. Sci., 293, series II, 501-503 (1981). In this study, the taxoids of general formula<br>
(I)	in which Z represents a radical of general formula<br>
(II)	were shown to be at least as active as Taxol and<br>
Taxotere.<br>
In vivo, the taxoids of general formula (I) in which Z represents a radical of general formula (II) were shown to be active in mice grafted with B16 melanoma at doses of between 1 and 10 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally, as well as on other liquid or solid tumours.<br>
The taxoids have antitumour properties, and more especially activity against tumours which are resistant to Taxol® or to Taxotere®. Such tumours comprise colon tumours which have a high expression ofthe mdr 1 gene (multiple drug resistance gene). Multiple drug resistance is a customary term relating to the resistance of a tumour to different compounds having different structures and mechanisms of action. Taxoids are generally known to be strongly recognized by experimental tumours such as P388/DOX, a cell line selected for its resistance to doxorubicin (DOX) which expresses mdr l.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the present invention.<br>

After 5 minutes at a temperature in the region of 2 0°C, the reaction mixture is diluted with 50 cm3 of ethyl acetate.

The taxoids according to the invention are especially useful for the treatment of cancer of the ovary. The taxoids according to the invention may be used to prevent or delay the appearance or reappearance of the pathological conditions, or to treat these pathological conditions.<br>
The taxoids according to the invention may be administered to a patient according to different dosage forms suited to the chosen administration route, which is preferably the parenteral route. Parenteral administration comprises intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration. Intraperitoneal or intravenous administration is more especially preferred.<br>
The present invention also comprises pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one taxoid of general formula (I), in a sufficient amount suitable for use in human or veterinary therapy. The compositions may be prepared according to the customary methods, using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants, vehicles or excipients. suitable vehicles<br><br>
include diluents, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic solvents. Preferably, the compositions take the form of aqueous solutions or suspensions, injectable solutions which can contain emulsifying agents, colourings, preservatives or stabilizers. However, the compositions may also be provided in the form of tablets, pills, powders or granules which can be administered via the oral route.<br>
The choice of adjuvants or excipients may be determined by the solubility and the chemical properties of the compound, the particular mode of administration and good pharmaceutical practice.<br>
For parenteral administration, sterile, aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions are used. For the preparation of non-aqueous solutions or suspensions, natural vegetable oils such as olive oil, sesame oil or liquid petroleum, or injectable oR6anic esters such as ethyl oleate, may be used. The sterile aqueous solutions can consist of a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt dissolved in water. The aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous administration provided the pH is appropriately adjusted and the solution is made isotonic, for example with a sufficient amount of sodium chloride or glucose. The sterilization may be carried out by heating or by any other means which does not adversely affect the composition.<br>
It is clearly understood that all the<br><br>
compounds participating in the compositions according to the invention must be pure and non-toxic in the amounts used.<br>
The compositions can contain at least 0.01 % of therapeutically active compound. The amount of active principle in a composition is such that a suitable dosage can be prescribed. Preferably, the compositions are prepared in such a way that a single dose contains from 0.01 to 1000 mg approximately of active principle for parenteral administration.<br>
The therapeutic treatment may be performed concurrently with other therapeutic treatments including antineoplastic drugs, monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapy or radiotherapy or biological response modifiers. The response modifiers include, without implied limitation, lymphokines and cytokines such as interleukins, interferons (a, (1  or <s and tnf. other chemotherapeutic agents which are useful in the treatment of disorders due to abnormal cell proliferation include without implied limitation alkylating for instance nitrogen mustards such as mechlorethamine cyclophosphamide melphalan chlorambucil alkyl sulphonates busulfan nitrosoureas carmustine lomustine semustine streptozocin triazenes dacarbazine antimetabolites folic acid analogues methotrexate pyrimidine fluorouracil cytarabine purine></s>
 <br>
 mercaptopurine and thioguanine, natural products, for instance vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine, vincristine and vindesine, epipodophyllotoxins such as etoposide and teniposide, antibiotics such as dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, plicamycin and mitomycin, enzymes such as L-asparaginase, various agents such as coordination complexes of platinum, for instance cisplatin, substituted ureas such as hydroxyurea, methylhydrazine derivatives such as procarbazine, adrenocortical suppressants such as mitotane and aminoglutethimide, hormones and antagonists such as adrenocorticosteroids such as prednisone, progestins such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, methoxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate, oestrogens such as diethylstilboestrol and ethynyloestradiol, antioestrogens such as tamoxifen, and androgens such as testosterone propionate and fluoxymesterone.<br>
The doses used for carrying out the methods according to the invention are those which permit a prophylactic treatment or a maximum therapeutic response. The doses vary according to the administration form, the particular product selected and features distinctive to the subject to be treated. In general, the doses are those which are therapeutically effective for the treatment of disorders due to abnormal cell proliferation. The taxoids according to the invention may be administered<br><br>
as often as necessary to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Some patients may respond rapidly to relatively high or low doses, and then require low or zero maintenance doses. Generally, low doses will be used at the beginning of the treatment and, if necessary, increasingly stronger doses will be administered until an optimum effect is obtained. For other patients, it may be necessary to administer maintenance doses 1 to 8 times a day, and preferably 1 to 4 times, according to the physiological requirements of the patient in question. It is also possible that some patients may require the use of only one to two daily administrations.<br>
In man, the doses are generally between 0.01 and 200 mg/kg. For intraperitoneal administration, the doses will generally be between 0.1 and 100 mg/kg, preferably between 0.5 and 50 mg/kg and still more specifically between 1 and 10 mg/kg. For intravenous administration, the doses are generally between 0.1 and 50 mg/kg, preferably between 0.1 and 5 mg/kg and still more specifically between 1 and 2 mg/kg. It is understood that, in order to choose the most suitable dosage, account should be taken of the administration route, the patient's weight, general state of health and age and all factors which may influence the efficacy of the treatment.<br>
