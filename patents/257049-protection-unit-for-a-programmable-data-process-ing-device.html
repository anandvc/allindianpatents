FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a protection unit for a (programmable)<br>
data-processing device, the data-processing device comprising at least one<br>
operating memory in which operating data can be stored or is stored for the<br>
operation of the data-processing device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A programmable data-processing device denotes in particular a<br>
control unit or controller in a motor vehicle, airplane, ship, a machine in an<br>
assembly line, or a remotely administered plant. Such data-processing devices,<br>
such as programmable controllers, are currently integrated in modern vehicles in<br>
large numbers and in a great variety. Increasingly they are cross-linked to their<br>
environment, especially since areas of "infotainment", or traffic detection<br>
systems are becoming increasingly more important.<br>
It is generally known to protect data-processing devices, such as<br>
personal computers that are connected to computer networks, for example the<br>
internet, from viruses or attacks by means of antivirus software or other<br>
programs. Such developments have not had any influence at all on the reliability<br>
or safety of data-processing devices in, for example, motor vehicles.<br>
The invention therefore has the object of creating a<br>
(programmable) protection unit for a (programmable) data-processing device,<br>
such as a motor vehicle controller, that ensures reliable and safe operation of the<br>
data-processing device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to attain this object the invention provides a protection<br>
unit for a (programmable) data-processing device, such<br><br><br>
as a controller of a motor vehicle, or the like, where the data-<br>
processing device comprises at least one operating memory in which<br>
operating data can be or is stored for the operation of the data-<br>
processing device,<br>
wherein the protection unit has at least one monitoring<br>
logic and at least one protection logic in an execution environment<br>
protected against unauthorized access,<br>
wherein the monitoring logic accesses the operating<br>
memory for the monitoring of unauthorized modifications, access, or<br>
similar protection violations of the operating data stored in the<br>
operating memory, and notifies the protection logic in case of any<br>
protection violations, and<br>
wherein the protection logic provides non-compromised<br>
replacement data for a substitute operation of the data-processing<br>
device in case of a protection violation. Data (operating data on<br>
one hand, and replacement data on the other hand) denotes data,<br>
programs, memory areas, or the like, within the scope of the<br>
invention that determine or influence the operation of such a data-<br>
processing device. Protection violation denotes in particular<br>
unauthorized access to the operating memory or the operating data<br>
as well as unauthorized modifications to the operating data within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
Within the scope of the invention a protection unit for a<br>
programmable data-processing device, such as a controller of a<br>
motor vehicle, is therefore provided that protects the data-<br>
processing device against unauthorized access, or unauthorized<br>
modifications of the operating data. Unauthorized modifications of<br><br>
the data and thus protection violations of the data-processing<br>
device can be determined continuously or cyclically by means of the<br>
monitoring logic of the protection unit. Corresponding test<br>
programs (monitoring logic) are stored within the protection unit<br>
in a tamper-proof manner and are executed in a tamper-proof manner.<br>
In particular, the protection unit is protected against<br>
unauthorized reading or writing of data by means of these programs.<br>
If the monitoring logic detects a protection violation, it will<br>
notify the protection logic that in turn provides non-compromised<br>
replacement data for the operation, or for a substitute operation<br>
of the data-processing device. This replacement data, or the<br>
replacement data operation thus form "emergency operation<br>
instructions." In this regard the invention is based on the<br>
recognition that it is not only essential to detect tampering with<br>
or unauthorized access to the operating memory, but that despite<br>
such a protection violation error-free operation, or at least an<br>
"emergency running operation," or "substitute operation" of the<br>
data-processing device must be ensured. This ensures, for example<br>
in motor vehicles, that in case of an unauthorized manipulation at<br>
least one emergency running operation or emergency operation is<br>
provided. This consideration particularly allows for the fact that<br>
progressive electrification, or automation of the primary driving<br>
functions in motor vehicles (drive by wire technology) makes<br>
increased demands on safety. It must be ensured at all times that<br>
the controllers involved behave in accordance with specifications,<br>
and that in case of fail-safe emergency running instructions can be<br>
reverted to in a quick manner. The safety device according to the<br><br>
invention thus forms a safe trust anchor that imparts full<br>
efficiency to protection measures, and can in a timely manner<br>
quickly execute the protection operation in order to prevent<br>
dangerous behavior of the motor vehicle caused by manipulation of<br>
its controllers.<br>
Advantageous further embodiments of the invention are<br>
explained as follows. It is provided that the safety device has at<br>
least one monitoring memory that stores information on one or more<br>
protection violation detected. Furthermore, an information<br>
interface is preferably provided that can read information on the<br>
protection violations and/or other status information from the<br>
protection unit. Information on the protection violations detected<br>
by the monitoring logic and the start of the emergency running<br>
instructions or the replacement data from the monitoring memory can<br>
be read in an authorized manner by means of this information<br>
interface and provided to the relevant devices to notify the user.<br>
The authorization information required for reading is stored in the<br>
execution environment. For this purpose, different authorization<br>
information can be stored in the execution environment so that<br>
different memory areas can be read depending on the authorization<br>
information provided to the information interface. Thus role<br>
models can be provided for the access to the monitoring memory.<br>
According to a further proposition according to the<br>
invention, the protection unit has an administration interface.<br>
Authorization information of the execution environment can be<br>
exchanged by means of this administration interface. For this<br>
purpose, the execution environment receives at least one piece of<br><br>
initial authorization information. In this manner, new<br>
authorization information, as well as new monitoring logics, and/or<br>
protection logics can be incorporated into the execution<br>
environment after successful external authorization.<br>
The execution environment for the execution logic of the<br>
protection unit is preferably hardware, or in the form of hardware.<br>
This execution environment forms a runtime environment for the<br>
logics and the memory described above and is protected against<br>
unauthorized writing and reading access. The execution environment<br>
comprises the authorization information in order to be able to<br>
safely execute the emergency running instructions, or the<br>
substitute operation, i.e. not until successful authorization. The<br>
execution environment further comprises the authorization<br>
information in order to be able to reload modified protection<br>
logic, and/or monitoring logics in the protection unit in an<br>
authorized manner. These may be, for example, cryptographic keys<br>
that can check the signatures of the logics, or can possibly decode<br>
the logic.<br>
It is further within the scope of the invention that the<br>
monitoring logic may be part of the execution environment and<br>
therefore part of the underlying hardware. In this case the<br>
monitoring logic is thus built or integrated into the hardware.<br>
However, the monitoring logic is preferably software. Software<br>
within the scope of the invention also denotes executable code for<br>
a programmable module, such as an FPGA. Such a monitoring logic<br>
embodied as software is preferably not loaded into the execution<br>
environment until the time of execution. Storage is effected<br><br>
either within the protection unit or in a memory area of the data-<br>
processing device. Before the monitoring logic is executed the<br>
execution environment verifies by means of the authorization<br>
information stored within whether the monitoring logic is<br>
authorized to execute. At runtime, the monitoring logic forms with<br>
the data-processing device an interface by means of which the<br>
corresponding data (or programs/memory areas) can be "permanently"<br>
verified for correctness by means of a respective logic unit. This<br>
can, for example, be done by verifying an electronic signature of<br>
the data (or programs/memory areas) via cryptographic mechanisms,<br>
or by monitoring memory thresholds that may not be deviated from by<br>
any executed program. For example, malicious modifications to the<br>
code by viruses, Trojan horses, buffer overflows, etc, can be<br>
recognized in this manner.<br>
The protection logic can also be part of the execution<br>
environment and thus of the underlying hardware, and therefore it<br>
may also be hardware. However, preferably the protection logic is<br>
also software. In this case, software also comprises an executable<br>
code for a programmable module, such as an FPGA. Thus the<br>
protection logic can also not be loaded into the execution<br>
environment until the time of execution. Storage is in the<br>
protection unit or in a memory area of the data-processing device.<br>
It is also within the scope of the invention that the<br>
monitoring memory, the information interface, the administration<br>
interface, and/or the operating data, or the operating memory are<br>
in software, or code for a programmable module (FPGA).<br><br>
Another object of the invention is also a data-processing<br>
device, such as a controller for a motor vehicle or the like,<br>
having at least one protection unit of the type described above.<br>
The invention thus also includes within the scope of protection the<br>
combination of a data-processing device on one hand, and a<br>
protection unit on the other hand, i.e. a data-processing device,<br>
into which at least one protection unit is integrated.<br>
A further object of the invention is a method for<br>
monitoring a data-processing device by means of at least one<br>
protection unit of the type described above, where the monitoring<br>
logic accesses the operating memory and determines possible<br>
protection violations, where the monitoring logic notifies the<br>
protection logic in case of a protection violation, and where the<br>
protection logic provides replacement data for the operation of the<br>
data-processing device or for a substitute operation in case of a<br>
protection violation. Information on detected protection<br>
violation(s) is stored in the monitoring memory. For this purpose,<br>
the monitoring logic can continuously or preferably cyclically<br>
(such as quasi-continuously) access the operating memory at a<br>
predetermined clock frequency. In order to verify any protection<br>
violations, for example, a verification of an electronic signature<br>
of the operating data is executed.<br>
Therefore, the memory of the data-processing device is<br>
"constantly" being checked by the monitoring logic within the scope<br>
of the invention. This can occur, for example, by verifying an<br>
electronic signature of the data by means of cryptographic<br>
mechanisms or by monitoring memory thresholds that may not be<br><br>
deviated from by an executed program. Any malicious modifications<br>
to the code by means of viruses, Trojan horses, buffer overflows,<br>
etc, can be recognized in this manner. The sampling rate, i.e. the<br>
frequency, at which the correctness of the data is checked by the<br>
monitoring logic, can be configured via the administration<br>
interface. If the monitoring logic has recognized a protection<br>
violation, it notifies the protection logic of the type of<br>
protection violation. Before the protection logic is executed, the<br>
execution environment checks by means of the authorization<br>
information stored there whether the protection logic is authorized<br>
to execute. The protection logic accepts data only from a<br>
monitoring logic that has been authorized by the execution<br>
environment. For the runtime, the protection logic forms an<br>
interface to the data-processing device by means of which access by<br>
the data-processing device to the data affected by the protection<br>
violation is prevented.<br>
It is of considerable importance that different<br>
replacement data can be provided depending on the type of<br>
protection violation. The protection logic thus activates one set<br>
of stored replacement data or emergency running instructions in a<br>
fail-safe manner. For this purpose, the appropriate emergency<br>
running instructions are verified by means of the authorization<br>
information stored in the execution environment and is executed in<br>
case of success. If the authorization fails, initial emergency<br>
running instructions are stored in the protection logic itself that<br>
is then executed. Depending on, the characteristic of the<br>
protection logic, the protection unit then executes the emergency<br><br>
running instructions. If the protection logic does not handle the<br>
execution of the emergency running instructions, the emergency<br>
running instructions are transferred to the data-processing device<br>
for execution, and execution is started in the runtime environment<br>
of the data-processing device via the interface of the protection<br>
logic. Subsequently the monitoring logic handles the monitoring of<br>
the emergency running instructions are executed, instead of the<br>
data monitored by the protection violation.<br>
Thus the replacement data described within the scope of<br>
the invention, which is also called "emergency running<br>
instructions," is preferably logic, or multiple logics, which are<br>
executed either within the protection unit, instead of and hence as<br>
a substitute for the operating data available in the data-<br>
processing device, or also outside of the protection unit in the<br>
data-processing device by means of the protection logic. In each<br>
case each set of emergency running instructions receives<br>
authorization information, such as an electronic signature that<br>
enables safe verification of the authorization of the emergency<br>
running instructions by means of the protection logic within the<br>
execution environment. The emergency running instructions are<br>
always executed after successful authorization only. The storage<br>
of the emergency running instructions or of the replacement data is<br>
handled by the protection unit. As an alternative, the replacement<br>
data, or the emergency running instructions, can also be stored in<br>
a memory area of the data-processing device, and then safely loaded<br>
by the protection logic. Corresponding replacement data, or<br>
emergency running instructions can be reloaded into the protection<br><br>
unit or the data-processing device by means of the authorization information in the<br>
execution environment in an authorized manner.<br>
The invention will be explained in further detail by means of a drawing<br>
illustrating only one embodiment example, as follows.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
The single figure shows in an extremely simplified schematic<br>
illustration a data-processing device comprising an integrated protection unit<br>
according to the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
A data-processing device DE is indicated in the figure. It can be a<br>
controller of a motor vehicle, such as an air-bag controller, a motor controller, a<br>
transmission controller, or the like. This data-processing device or controller DE has<br>
an operating memory BS in which operating data BD is stored for the operation of<br>
this controller. This operating data BD may also represent operating programs or the<br>
like.<br>
The figure indicates that according to the invention a protection unit<br>
PU according to the invention is integrated into this data-processing device or<br>
controller DE. This protection unit provides an execution environment AU that is<br>
protected from unauthorized access, this execution environment AU being formed<br>
for example as a hardware module.<br>
A monitoring logic UL on. one hand, and a protection logic SL on the<br>
other hand, are integrated into the protection unit. These are formed, for example,<br>
by programmable modules (FPGSs), or a respective code of such an FPGA,<br>
respectively. A monitoring memory US is also provided. The communication of the<br>
protection unit PU is conducted by means of an information interface IS, as well as<br>
by means of an administration interface AS.<br><br>
The protection unit according to the invention preferably<br>
operates as follows:<br>
operating data BD, or operating programs, or the like,<br>
are stored in the operating memory BS, as required for the<br>
operation of the respective controller DE, such as the air-bag<br>
control. In order to ensure safe operation of such a controller<br>
DE, a permanent monitoring of unauthorized access or unauthorized<br>
modifications of such operating data occurs by means of the<br>
protection unit according to the invention, and thus a<br>
verification, or monitoring of unauthorized protection violations.<br>
If the monitoring logic UL determines such a protection<br>
violation, information on the type of this protection violation as<br>
well as other information such as the time of the protection<br>
information is stored in the monitoring memory US. Furthermore,<br>
the monitoring logic UL notifies the protection logic SL of the<br>
type of protection violation. Depending on the type of protection<br>
violation, the protection logic SL can now provide replacement data<br>
ED for a substitute operation of the controller DE. Such<br>
replacement data ED thus forms emergency running instructions for<br>
an emergency running operation, or emergency operation of the<br>
controller DE. The drawing shows that the protection logic SL can<br>
provide different replacement data ED, or different emergency<br>
running instructions depending on the type of the protection<br>
violation to be determined. Thus, within the scope of the<br>
invention a flexible response can be provided to the type, or<br>
degree, respectively, of the protection violation, in that<br><br>
prepared, suitable emergency running instructions ED are activated<br>
in each respective case.<br>
Information on the protection violation and on the start<br>
of a substitute operation (or an emergency running instructions)<br>
can be read from the monitoring memory US in an authorized manner,<br>
and provided to the devices relevant for notifying the user by<br>
means of the monitoring logic UL. The authorization information<br>
required for reading in this regard is stored in the execution<br>
environment AU.<br>
Particular authorization information of the execution<br>
environment can also be exchanged by means of the administration<br>
interface AS also indicated in the figure. Thus, after successful<br>
outside authorization (such as by means of an administrator) new<br>
authorization information may be imbedded, and a monitoring logic<br>
UL, and/or a protection logic SL may be reloaded into the execution<br>
environment by means of the administration interface AS, insofar as<br>
the protection logic SL itself is not hardware, but instead as, for<br>
example, an FPGA code.<br>
The execution environment AU indicated only represents a<br>
runtime environment protected against unauthorized write and read<br>
access for the above-referenced logics and memories. The execution<br>
environment AU comprises the authorization information, and thus<br>
cryptographic keys, by means of which respective signatures of the<br>
logics described can be verified, or the logics can possibly be<br>
decoded.<br>
Overall, the protection unit according to the invention<br>
ensures safe operation of a controller or the like, for example in<br><br>
a motor vehicle. This is achieved although such motor vehicles are<br>
usually not permanently "online." A continuous online updating of,<br>
for example, anti-virus software is not necessary. By means of<br>
cross-linking controllers within motor vehicles, any tampering with<br>
or failures of online access would be particularly critical, since<br>
particular risks could be posed to passengers due to unauthorized<br>
access to safety-relevant functions via the bus systems. The<br>
invention finds a remedy in this regard by means of creating a safe<br>
assurance anchor within the motor vehicle that, for example, may be<br>
under the sole control of an automobile manufacturer, thus lending<br>
full effectiveness to the protective measures. Protection<br>
operations are rapidly executed, and dangerous behavior of the<br>
motor vehicle by manipulation of controllers is prevented in due<br>
time.<br><br>

PROTECTION UNIT FOR A PROGRAMMABLE DATA PROCESSING DEVICE<br><br>
Abstract<br><br><br>
A protection unit (PU) for a (programmable) data-<br>
processing device (DE), such as a controller of a motor vehicle,<br>
airplane, ship, or the like, the data-processing device comprising<br>
at least one operating memory (BS) in which operating data (BD) can<br>
be stored or is stored for the operation of the data-processing<br>
device, the protection unit (PU) having at least one monitoring<br>
logic (ÜL) and at least one protection logic (SL) in an execution<br>
environment (AU) protected against unauthorized access. For<br>
monitoring unauthorized modifications, access, or similar<br>
protection violations of the operating data stored in the operating<br>
memory, the monitoring logic (ÜL) accesses the operating memory and<br>
notifies the protection logic (SL) in case of any protection<br>
violation, and the protection logic provides replacement data for<br>
the operation, or for the substitute operation of the data-<br>
processing device in case of any protection violation.</td>
