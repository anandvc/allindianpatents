				<td>A  PROCESS  FOR THE   ISOLATION  OF  POLYHYDROXYBUTYRATE   FROM BACILLUSMYCOIDES RLJ B-017<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the isolation of polyhydroxybutyrate from Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the recovery of a polyhydroxybutyrate of the formula 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
from Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017 by using sucrose, molasses, pine apple waste, etc. as the<br>
carbon source.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Commodity polymers are typically produced from petrochemical sources by well-known synthetic means. However, recent advances in technology have resulted in the promise of new sources of commodity polymers. Particularly promising is the production of plastic resins using living organisms ("bioplastic" or Biopol), including bacteria to produce polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA); a number of bacteria which naturally produce PHA are also promising sources of PHA. (see for example, NOVEL BIODEGRADABLE MICROBIAL POLYMERS E.A. Dawes, ed., NATO ASI Series, Series E: Applied Sciences - Vol. 186, Kluwer Academic Publishers (1990); Poirier, Y.,D.E. Dennis, K. Klomparens and C. Somerville, 'Polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable thermoplastic produced in transgenic plants", SCIENCE, Vol. 256, pp. 520-523 (1992). In a large scale production, for example agricultural production, isolation and culture of a new organism and cheap raw material for the production of bioplastic is a critical step for determining the practical feasibility of such technology.<br>
PHB is an energy storage material produced by a variety of bacteria in response to environmental stress and is a homopolymer of D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate of the formula 1 which has properties comparable to polypropylene Because PHB is biodegradable, there is considerable interest in using PHB for packaging purposes as opposed to other plastic materials in order to reduce the environmental impact of human garbage. PHB also has utility<br>
in antibiotics, drug delivery, medical suture and bone replacement applications. PHB is commercially produced from Alcaligenes eutrophm and sold under the trade name Biopol.<br>
As described above and by Slater et al, in 'Cloning and Expression in Escherichia coli of the Alcaligenes entrophus H16 Poly-beta-Hydroxybutyrate Biosynthetic Pathway", Journal of Bacteriology, Vol. 170, No. 10, Oct., 1988, p. 4431-4436, which is also incorporated herein by reference, it was shown that E. coli could be genetically transformed with genes from A. eutrophus which code for the PHB biosynthetic pathway. E. coli are a far better vehicle for producing PHB than A. entrophus since more is known about handling the bacteria, E. coli, i.e. E coli is more easily controlled and manipulated. The transformed E. coli is able to express PHB in relatively large quantities.<br>
Despite PHB's advantages over other materials, its high cost of production has hindered its performance in the market. Currently, PHB is produced in transformed E. coli by growing the E. coli on luria broth (LB) and using glucose as the carbon source.<br>
Approximately one third of the production cost of PHB is attributable to the rich LB medium and the glucose. If a less expensive carbon source could be utilized, the overall cost of PHB production could be significantly reduced. In addition, much of the total cost of PHB production is attributable to purifying the PHB produced in the E. coli. Currently, PHB is purified by centrifugation, followed by mechanical lysis of the cells to release PHB, a high temperature procedure to agglomerate the PHB, and finally a spray drying step to procure to agglomerate the PHB, and finally a spray drying step to procure the purified granules. If a less expensive method were available for collecting the PHB from a new organism of high efficiency together with the application of a cheap carbon source, the overall cost of PHB production could be significantly reduced.<br>
In view of the above, there is a need for a simple and economical process for the production of bioplastics from a new biological source suing cheap raw materials. Such a process would preferably be easily adaptable as an integral part of the agricultural commercial production of bioplastics. Objects of the invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing bioplastics from a biological source material.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide improved techniques for producing polyhydroxy butyrate of the structure 1 using a new .bacteria, Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017, and sucrose and molasses as cheap carbon source.<br>
higher levels and which can utilize minimal medium containing sucrose for growing conditions.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a strain Bacillus mycoides RUB - 017 which can accumulate PHB at higher levels than previous methods and which can utilize minimal medium containing molasses for growing conditions<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide an economical and efficient process for the isolation of bioplastic polyhydroxybutyrate.<br>
It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method of agglomerating PHB granules from lysed Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017 cells using a solution sodium hypochlorite,  calcium hypochlorite or any metal hypochlorite in chloroform or any polyhalogenated hydrocarbon solvent. Summary of the invention: Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the isolation of polyhydroxybutyrate    from Bacillus<br>

According to the invention, a strain Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017 is used which can accumulate PHB at higher levels that previous methods and which can utilize minimal<br>
medium containing cheap material like sucrose, molasses, etc. for growing conditions. The carbohydrate utilization system present in Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017 allows sucrose, molasses, pineapple waste, etc. to be used as a cheap carbon source for the production of PHB. Molasses is a waste product from sugar processing and is very inexpensive. Similarly pineapple waste from fruit industry is also a waste product from fruit processing industries and is very inexpensive. Experiments show that the strain of Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017 grows in minimal medium containing molasses and has an average yield of PHB of approximately 85% (PHB dry weight/total cell dry weight).<br>
Experiments also show that PHB produced in transformed E. coli can be agglomerated with sodium hypochlorite or calcium monohypochlorite hydroxide solutions. To retrieve purified PHB of the structure 1 in large quantities, the transformed Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017 cells are first lysed by mechanical or physical means, such as by sonication, or generic means. The cells are then incubated in an ionic solution, such as 10 millimolar (mM) sodium hypochlorite), which agglomerates the PHB granules. Finally, the agglomerates are centrifuged from the culture at low speed. Experiments show that nearly all (100%) of the PHB of the structure 1 in culture is agglomerated and recovered by this process. The results are especially significant since the same type of agglomeration is not possible for retrieving PHB of the structure 1 from A eutrophus.<br>
From Figure 1 of the drawings, it is shown that Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017 accumulates a greater percentage of PHB in a short period of 24 hours. The strain Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017 is available from the Biochemeistry Division, Regional Research Laboratory, Jorhat-6, Assam, India.<br>
Experiments were performed which showed that the Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017 strain which could be grown on minimal medium containing sucrose or molasses. Activated sludge sample, from wastewater-treatment plant was appropriately diluted and then spread on YPM-agar plates containing (g 1-1); yeast extract, 10; bactopeptone, 10; meat extract, 5; NaCl, 5; and agar, 20. The plates were incubated at 50°C for 72 h. Several colonies appearing on the plates were screened for their PHB production. Isolate RLJ B-017, thus selected was used in this study.<br>
Morphological and taxonomic features of the selected isolate was examined by the established method (Sheath et al, 1986). The results are as shown Table 1 in Example 1.<br>
Organism Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017 was maintained and grown at 30 ± 0.5°C and maintained at 4°C by periodical transfer on YPM-agar slants. The inoculum was grown on nutrient rich medium occupying 20% of the flask volume. The nutrient rich medium consists<br>
1-1): sucrose, 20; nutrient broth, 8; KH2PO4, 1.5; (NH4)2S04, 2.0; Na2HPO4.12H20, 2.239; MgSO4.7H2O, 0.2; CaCI2.2H20, 0.02; FeSO47H2O,O.Q1; and trace-element solution 1 ml 1-1 . The trace element solution comprising (g 1-1): ZnSO47H20, 0.2; H3BO3, 0.6; MnCI2 4H2O, 0.06; CoCI2 6H2O, 0.4; CuSO44H2O, 0.02; NaMoO4.2H2O, 0.6.The pH was set at 7.2.<br>
The composition of basal culture media used was same as that of the inoculum media except nutrient broth was not added. Overnight grown inoculum was transferred directly in a 3L bioreactor containing the basal culture media of pH 7.2 with 2% sucrose as carbon source. The temperature of the bioreactor was set between 30-35 ° C and its rpm was at 200. the cells were harvested by centrifugation after 24 hours corresponding to the exponential growth, and washed twice with distilled water.<br>
10-15% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite solution of pH 11 was prepared for processing. The cell pellete after centrifugation was treated with dispersion of sodium hypochlorite and chloroform (1:1 v/v) . The treatment time was set between 2-3 hours at 30-35 ° C . The suspension was then centrifuged at 10000rpm for 15 minutes at 30 ° C . Three phases were obtained. The lower phase containing PHB dissolved in chloroform was precipitated by adding ethanol. The precipitate was kept at cold ( 4° C) for 1 hr. and was recovered by centrifuging at 10000rpm for 15 min at 4 ° C . The pellet obtained was pressed to remove ethanol and dried at 60° C for 24 hrs.<br>
Utilizing sucrose and molasses as carbon source for the production of PHB, where the sucrose and molasses are present in minimal medium , will result in considerable cost savings over the prior art practice of using rich medium with glues for producing PHB . The method will be cheaper to the process of production of PHB using the prior art of transformed E.coli, Alcaligenes eutrophus , or genetically manipulated plant cells because of their high cost involved in their production or commercial source.<br>
The invention has been described in terms of its preferred embodiments where a strain of Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017 has been isolated from waste water treatment plants which can accumulate larger quantities of PHB while using an inexpensive carbon source such as sucrose and molasses for PHB production. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within apirit and scope of the appended calins. The following non-limiting examples illustrate the methods of the present invention.<br>

Identification of the isolated strain<br>
Morphological and taxonomic features of the selected isolate was examined by the established method (Sheath et. Al, 1986). The results are as shown Table 1 in example 1.<br><br>
Organism and Maintenance<br>
Bacillus mycoides RLJ B-017, was grown at 30 + 0.5°C and maintained at 4°C by periodical transfer on YPM-agar slants. Inoculum Preparation<br>
The inoculum was grown on nutrient rich medium occupying 20% of the flask volume. The nutrient rich medium consists of (g 1-1): sucrose, 20; nutrient broth, 8; KH2PO4, 1.5; (NH4)2SO4, 2.0; Na2HPO4.12H2O, 2.239; MgSO4.7H2O, 0.2; CaCl2.2H2O, 0.02, FeSO47H20, 0.01; and trace-element solution 1 ml 1-1. The trace element solution contained (g 1-1): ZnSO47H2O, 0.2; H3BO3, 0.6; MnCl2 4H2O, 0.06; CoCl2 6H20, 0.4; CuSO44H2O, 0.02; NaMoO4.2H2O, 0.06. The ph was set at 7.2. Cultivation conditions<br>
The composition of basal culture ivation conditions media used was same as that of the inoculum media except nutrient broth was not added. Overnight grown inoculum was transferred directly in a 3L bioreactor containing the basal culture media of pH 7.2 with 2% sucrose as carbon source. The temperature of the bioreactor was set between 30-35°C andits rpm was at 200. The cells were harvested by centrifugation after 24 hrs. corresponding to the end of exponential growth, and washed twice with distilled water. Chemicals<br>
Nutrient  broth  and   all  the  other  chemicals  used  were  obtained  from  Difco Laboratories and Sigma Chemicals Co, and are of high purity analytical grade. However, Nutrient broth and all the other chemicals obtained from other commercial sources can also be used. Processing of Bio-polymer<br>
10-25% (v/v) Sodium hypochlorite solution of pH 11 was prepared for processing. The cell pellet after centrifugation was treated with dispersions of sodium hypochlorite and chloroform (1:1 v/v). The treatment time was set between 2-3 hours at 30-35°C. The suspension was then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 minutes at 30°C. Three separate phases were obtained. The lower phase containing  PHB dissolved in chloroform was precipitated by adding ethanol. The precipitate was kept at cold (4°C) for 1 hr. and was recovered by centrifuging at 10000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. The pellet obtained was pressed to remove ethanol and dried at 60°C for 24 hrs. Molecular weight by viscosity method was similar to mentioned above. NMR data were similar to shown in Example 1 and comparison of 'H NMR spectra with that of PHB obtained from M/s. Sigma Chemicals in Figure 2, Elemental analysis: similar to mentioned above Examples 1 and 2.<br>
