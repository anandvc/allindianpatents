METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING OXIDIZED COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing<br>
an oxidized compound in a chemical/pharmaceutical field, with<br>
which a target oxidized compound is produced by an oxidation<br>
reaction, and more specifically relates to a method for producing<br>
an oxidized compound suitable for an industrial, large-scale<br>
production. In particular, the invention relates to a method<br>
for producing an oxidized compound, where the method is suitably<br>
used for producing a 2- (2-pyridyl- or<br>
phenyl-methylsulfinyl) imidazole compound (e.g., see U.S. Patent<br>
Publication No. 4,255,431, European Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication No. 45,200, European Unexamined Patent Publication<br>
No. 74,341, European Unexamined Patent Publication No. 80,602,<br>
European Unexamined Patent Publication No. 5,129, European<br>
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 174,726, European Unexamined<br>
Patent Publication No. 175,464, United Kingdom Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication No. 2,134,523A, Pamphlet of International<br>
Publication WO 01/83, 473) which is useful as an antiulcer agent ,<br>
and to a production apparatus for carrying out the method.<br>
Background Art<br><br>
In the past, in the industrial production process<br>
comprising an oxidation step, in order to carry out a next step<br>
after terminating the oxidation step, an end point of the<br>
oxidation reaction is assessed while confirming the amount of<br>
an unreacted residue of the starting material with the use of<br>
a thin layer chromatography or the like, and the next treatment<br>
is carried out. For example, as the method for producing a<br>
2-(2-pyridylmethylsulfinyl)benzimidazole compound among<br>
various products produced by oxidation, there has known a method<br>
of oxidizing a corresponding<br>
2-(2-pyridylmethylthio)benzimidazole compound with meta chloro<br>
perbenzoic acid (e.g., see U.S Patent Publication No. 4,255,431<br>
and European Unexamined Patent Publication No. 80,602).<br>
As the method for obtaining sulfoxide from sulfide in<br>
general, there has been known a method of oxidizing with the use<br>
of peroxy acid, hydrogen peroxide, iodosobenzene,<br>
N-halosuccinimide, tertiary butyl hypochloride, sodium<br>
metaperiodate, selenium dioxide, bromine, chlorine, or ozone<br>
(e.g., see The Chemistry of Ethers, Crown Ethers, Hydroxyl Groups<br>
and Their Sulphur Analogues, Supplement E, Part 1, pp. 539-608,<br>
Saul Patai, Ed., John Wiley and Sons, An Interscience Publication,<br>
(1980) ; and Synthesis of Sulfoxides by Oxidation of Thioethers,<br>
Michel Madesclaire Ed., Tetrahedron Report Number 210,<br>
Tetrahedron, 42, 5459-5495 (1986)), and the like.<br>
In addition, there has been described a method of producing<br><br>
a 2-2(pyridylmethylsulfinyl)benzimidazole compound in the<br>
presence of a vanadium compound with the use of hydrogen peroxide<br>
as an oxidizing agent in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication<br>
No. 1-131176.<br>
However, it is not easy to determine the end point of the<br>
oxidation reaction in the reaction of oxidizing a<br>
2-(2-pyridylmethylthio)benzimidazole compound to produce a<br>
2-(2-pyridylmethylsulfinyl)benzimidazole compound with the use<br>
of any oxidizing agent and as well as in the oxidation reactions<br>
of obtaining other oxidized compounds, and thus in an industrial<br>
production process, the end point of the oxidation reaction is<br>
determined to move on to the next step by confirming the amount<br>
of an unreacted residue of the starting material with the use<br>
of a thin layer chromatography (hereinafter, also may be referred<br>
to as TLC). Therefore, it is not a method advantageous for an<br>
industrial production, and the production method which more<br>
simply determines the end point of the oxidation reaction and<br>
swiftly moves on to the next step has been demanded.<br>
The present inventors have conducted extensive studies to<br>
discover a production method advantageous in an industrial<br>
practice, with which 2-(2-pyridyl- or phenyl-<br>
methylsulfinyl)imidazoles can be produced from 2-(2-pyridyl- or<br>
phenyl-methylthio)imidazoles in good yield, less amount of<br>
byproducts such as corresponding sulfone products and<br>
2-(2-pyridyl- or phenyl-methylsulfonyl)imidazole-N-oxides<br><br>
produced by overreaction are produced, and a computational<br>
management or the like is possible. Accordingly, they found that<br>
the electric potential for the oxidation of the 2-(2-pyridyl-<br>
or phenyl-methylthio)imidazoles to 2-(2-pyridyl- or<br>
phenyl-methylsulfinyl)imidazoles increases as the reaction<br>
proceeds and rapidly decreases as the reaction comes to the end,<br>
and as a result of the further investigation, they have completed<br>
the invention.<br>

and commonly used oxidizing agent can be employed. For example,<br>

in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. S61-50978,<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H01-131176, U.S<br>
Patent Publication No. 4,628,098, Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication No. H10-195068, Pamphlet of International<br>
Publication WO 98/21201, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication<br>
No. S52-62275, or Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.<br>
54-141783, or a method analogous thereto. For the oxidation<br>
reaction to give the compound (II') from the compound (I'),<br>
oxidation carried out using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing<br><br>
agent is particularly preferable among others. In addition, it<br>
is preferable to use a vanadium compound as a catalyst.<br>
As the vanadium compound, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) , sodium<br>
metavanadate (NaV03) , ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) , vanadyl<br>
acetylacetonate [ (CH3COCH2COCH3) 2VO], and the like can be<br>
exemplified, and preferably vanadium pentoxide, sodium<br>
metavanadate, and vanadyl acetylacetonate are used.<br>
The used amount of the vanadium compound is in the range<br>
of usually about 0. 01 to 10 mol%, preferably about 0.05 to 2 mol%,<br>
and particularly preferably about 0 .1 to 0.5 mol%, to the compound<br>
(I'). As hydrogen peroxide, an aqueous hydrogen peroxide<br>
solution is usually used, but a solution state of an organic<br>
solvent such as n-butyl alcohol may also be used. The<br>
concentration of hydrogen peroxide to be used is in the range<br>
of usually 10 to 70% and preferably 20 to 40%, but is not<br>
particularly limited by these ranges.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide may be usually used in a slightly<br>
excessive amount, preferably from about 1 to 3 equivalent amount,<br>
and more preferably from about 1 to 1.5 equivalent amount, to<br>
1 equivalent amount of the compound (I') . As the solvent to be<br>
used in the reaction, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform<br>
and dichloromethane, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane,<br>
amides such as dimethylformamide, alcohols such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, and isopropanol, ketones such as acetone and<br>
methylethylketone, nitriles such as acetonitrile, water, or the<br><br>
like can be mentioned, and methanol, ethanol, acetone, and<br>
acetonitrile are preferably used and ethanol is particularly<br>
preferably used. These solvents may be used alone or in<br>
combination. The amount of a solvent to be used in the reaction<br>
is from about 0.5 to 10 L and preferably from about 1 to 5 L,<br>

The reaction temperature is under ice-cooling to near the<br>
boiling point of the solvent to be used, usually is from under<br>
ice-cooling to about 40°C', and more preferably from about 15 to<br>
30°C. The reaction time is usually from about 0.5 to 24 hours,<br>
and more preferably from about 1 to 8 hours.<br>
The target compound (II') produced by the above oxidation<br>
reaction usually precipitates as a crystal from the reaction<br>
solution, thus excessive hydrogen peroxide after the reaction<br>
can be decomposed by adding an oxidation reaction terminating<br>
agent (e.g., an aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution, etc.), and<br>
the precipitated crystals can be filtered to be isolated, but<br>
if necessary, the solvent extraction with chloroform or the like<br>
may be carried out, followed by concentration to be isolated.<br>
In addition, the isolated crystals can be purified by<br>
conventional means such as recrystallization, chromatography,<br>
and the like, if necessary. The optically active substance of<br>
the compound (II') can be obtained by optically resolving a<br>
racemate of the compound (II') produced by the above oxidation<br><br>
reaction, with the use of the optical resolution method<br>
(fractional recrystallization method, a chiral column method,<br>
a diastereomer method, a method using a microorganism or enzyme,<br>
etc.) , or can be directly obtained by carrying out an asymmetrical<br>
oxidation for the above-mentioned oxidation reaction. In<br>
addition, R-form of lansoprazole can be produced with the above<br>
oxidation reaction, for example, in accordance with the<br>
production method disclosed in Pamphlet of International<br>
Publication WO 00/78745, Pamphlet of International Publication<br>
WO 01/83743, and the like.<br>
The starting compound (I') can be produced, for example,<br>
in accordance with the method disclosed in U. S Patent Publication<br>
No. 4,255,431, European Patent Publication No. 45,200, European<br>
Patent Publication No. 74,341, European Patent Publication No.<br>
80,602, European Patent Publication No. 5,129, European Patent<br>
Publication No. 174,726, European Patent Publication No. 175,464,<br>
United Kingdom Patent Publication No. 2,134,523A, and the like.<br>
In the invention, an electric potential of an oxidation<br>
reaction solution for producing an oxidized compound is measured,<br>
and an end point of the oxidation reaction is determined on the<br>
basis of a predefined decrease of the electric potential.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable to use an oxidation reduction<br>
potential (ORP) meter for an electric potential measurement of<br>
the oxidation reaction solution. In addition, a reactor for<br>
carrying out the oxidation reaction is not particularly limited,<br><br>
and can be appropriately selected from various reactors according<br>
to the target oxidized compound (oxidation reaction).<br>
The oxidation reaction in the invention is not particularly<br>
limited, and can be exemplified by oxidation reaction of sulfide<br>
to sulfoxide, oxidation reaction of alcohol to ketone, oxidation<br>
reaction of aldehyde to carboxylic acid, oxidation reaction of<br>
amine to nitroso, oxidation reaction of phosphine to phosphine<br>
oxide, or the like, and preferably exemplified by the oxidation<br>
reaction of sulfide (e.g., the imidazole compound represented<br>
by the above-mentioned formula (I) or (I') or salts thereof) to<br>
sulfoxide (e.g., an oxidized compound of the imidazole compound<br>
represented by the above-mentioned formula (II) or (II') or salts<br>
thereof).<br>
As the industrial practice method of the invention, there<br>
mentioned a system as a preferred embodiment, in which a sensor<br>
(submersion type, etc.) for the oxidation reduction potential<br>
(ORP) meter is attached to the reactor for carrying out the<br>
oxidation reaction, the oxidation reduction potential of the<br>
oxidation reaction solution in the reactor is monitored at all<br>
time, a highest point for the electric potential to reach is<br>
determined by a program, and then a point where the electric<br>
potential is rapidly decreased is determined as the end point<br>
of the oxidation reaction. In addition, the program is<br>
preferably incorporated in the operation of informing the<br>
operator that the reaction is finished and stopping the reaction.<br><br>
Th|e termination of the oxidation reaction can be carried<br>
out, fori example, by removing a starting material such as an<br>
oxidizing agent provided in excess, or the like. For example,<br>
for the ioxidation reaction using hydrogen peroxide as an<br>
oxidizing agent to produce lansoprazole of which R2 is OCH2CF3,<br>
i<br>
R1 is CH3, R3 is H, R0 is H, and ring C' is a non-substituted benzene<br>
ring in the formula for the compound (II' ) , the oxidation reaction<br>
is preferably terminated by introducing an aqueous sodium<br>
thiosulfate solution (oxidation reaction terminating agent) to<br>
the oxidation reaction solution to decompose the unreacted<br>
hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Examples of the oxidation reaction terminating agent<br>
include sodium sulfite, sodium hydrogensulfite, and the like,<br>
in addition to the aforementioned aqueous sodium thiosulfate<br>
solution.<br>
For producing lansoprazole by using<br>
2- ( ( (3-methyl-4- (2, 2, 2-trif luoroethoxy) -2-pyridyl) methyl) thi<br>
o) benzimidazole monohydrate (hereinafter, also may be referred<br>
to as SUL) as a starting compound (I'), ethanol as a reaction<br>
solvent, and vanadyl aceylacetonate as a catalyst, and oxidizing<br>
with hydrogen peroxide, when the oxidizing agent (hydrogen<br>
peroxide) is added dropwise over 10 to 30 minutes, then reacted<br>
at 20 to 21 °C', and the oxidation reduction potential of the<br>
reaction solution is monitored with an ORP meter, the electric<br>
potential follows the time course shown in Fig. 1. That is, the<br><br>
electric potential gradually increases, and when drops by about<br>
70 mV after reaching to the highest electric potential, this<br>
dropped point can be determined as the reaction end point.<br>
Accordingly, it is confirmed that the end point corresponds to<br>
a point where the spot size of the starting material SUL comes<br>
within the range of about 1 to 3% of the SUL standard solution<br>
when the reaction solution is observed with TLC', the starting<br>
compound SUL is almost consumed, and that the oxidation is<br>
completed.<br>
In the invention, any ORP meter model can be employed, but<br>
in an industrial production, a meter in which an ORP transmitter<br>
can be equipped with an ORP sensor is preferable in order to enable<br>
a computational control. In particular, when a<br>
microprocessor-equipped ORP transmitter is used, a sensor defect,<br>
etc. can be monitored during the ORP measurement, thus is suitable<br>
for a large-scale apparatus in a factory. As the preferred ORP<br>
meter, for example, OR8EFG-PT-05-TT2-NN * A manufactured by<br>
Yokogawa Electric Corp. can be mentioned.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a specific example of an oxidized compound<br>
production system carrying out the method of the invention in<br>
an industrial scale.<br>
The system 100 is constructed in the manner to dropwisely<br>
introduce an oxidizing agent stored in the oxidizing agent tank<br>
2 by the flow rate regulator 3 into the reactor 1 which<br>
accommodates a starting compound (solution), and to supply an<br><br>
oxidation reaction terminating agent stored in the oxidation<br>
reaction terminating agent tank 4 in a predetermined amount to<br>
the reactor 1. When the temperature condition of the reactor<br>
1 and the like are set to predetermined conditions and an oxidizing<br>
agent in the oxidizing agent tank 2 is dropwisely introduced into<br>
the reactor 1, the oxidation reaction initiates and proceeds to<br>
produce an oxidized compound. Then, when an oxidation reaction<br>
terminating agent from the oxidation reaction terminating agent<br>
tank 4 is introduced into the reactor 1, the oxidation reaction<br>
terminates, and thereafter the reaction solution containing the<br>
oxidized compound is drained out to the processing unit for a<br>
next step by a draining apparatus not shown in the figure.<br>
The reactor 1 is provided with the ORP meter 5, and this<br>
ORP meter 5 detects the oxidation reduction potential of the<br>
reaction solution in the reactor 1 from the start of the oxidation<br>
reaction, and the detected values are inputted into the computer<br>
6. The computer 6 functions as a determination means which at<br>
all time monitors the inputted detected value of the oxidation<br>
reduction potential and determines the end point of the oxidation<br>
reaction on the basis of the inflection point (highest electric<br>
potential) with the time course. The computer 6 performs the<br>
calculation for detecting the highest electric potential of the<br>
oxidation reduction potential and the calculation for detecting<br>
the amount of an electric potential dropped from the highest<br>
electric potential, and compares the dropped amount of the<br><br>
electric potential with the threshold value preliminarily set,<br>
so as to determine the end point of the oxidation reaction. Here,<br>
the threshold value means the difference (amount of electric<br>
potential dropped) between the highest electric potential<br>
reached of the reaction solution and the electric potential at<br>
the end point of the oxidation reaction in the oxidation reaction<br>
carried out by the reactor, which is obtained by practically<br>
measuring the history of the oxidation reduction potential of<br>
the oxidation reaction solution in advance and then relating the<br>
history to the end point of the oxidation reaction confirmed from<br>
a quenching amount of the starting compound with TLC or the like.<br>
For example, in the aforementioned case of producing lansoprazole<br>
by oxidizing SUL with hydrogen peroxide, the dropped electric<br>
potential amount after reaching the highest electric potential<br>
which gives the end point of the oxidation reaction is 70 mV.<br>
The computer 6 has a CPU 6a for carrying out the determination<br>
process and a memory 6b for storing the program.<br>
The monitor 8 is a displaying means for displaying the<br>
history of the oxidation reduction potential monitored by the<br>
computer 6, and the operator can observe the change of the<br>
oxidation reduction potential of the oxidation reaction solution<br>
over a time course and the reaction end point with the monitor<br>
8. The chart in Fig. 1 is an exemplary output chart of the<br>
oxidation reduction potential displayed on the monitor 8. The<br>
operator can swiftly stop the oxidation reaction by giving the<br><br>
order to the automatic valve 7 to supply an oxidation reaction<br>
terminating agent stored in the oxidation reaction terminating<br>
agent tank 4 to the reactor 1 after confirming the end point of<br>
the oxidation reaction with the monitor 8. In addition, there<br>
may be provided with an informing means (not shown) such as a<br>
lamp or a buzzer which lights or alarms at the same time as the<br>
end point of the oxidation reaction is determined, thereby<br>
allowing the operator to more precisely recognize the end point<br>
of the oxidation reaction.<br>
Further, if the computer 6 is allowed to output a command<br>
signal x to the automatic valve 7 so as to supply an oxidation<br>
reaction terminating agent in the oxidation reaction terminating<br>
agent tank 4 to the reactor 1 when the end point of the oxidation<br>
reaction is determined, the oxidation reaction can be more<br>
promptly stopped, moving on to the next step is more swiftly done,<br>
and the production efficiency can be improved.<br>
In the invention, as the next step after terminating the<br>
oxidation reaction, for example, a process for isolating<br>
insolubles by filtering the liquid in which precipitated crystals<br>
of the oxidized compound are dissolved, or the like can be carried<br>
out. In the case, the concentration process by a solvent<br>
extraction of the oxidation reaction solution or the like, or<br>
the like may also be carried out, if necessary.<br>
As described above, the invention is particularly suitable<br>
for the oxidation reactions for obtaining the compound (II' ) from<br><br>
the compound (I') using an oxidizing agent, and among these<br>
particularly suitable for the oxidation reaction producing<br>
lansoprazole by oxidizing SUL with hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of producing a<br>
remarkably stable crystal of an imidazole compound represented<br>
by the above general formula (II') or a salt thereof.<br>
For the method of producing the remarkably stable crystal,<br>
the compound (II') is preferably a racemate, and it may be<br>
difficult to be directly applied to the optically active<br>
substance such as R-form and S-form of lansoprazole which has<br>
a different physicochemical characteristic to the racemate.<br>
The production method is characterized in that the<br>
remarkably stable crystal is produced from a solvate of the<br>
imidazole compound represented by the general formula (II') or<br>
a salt thereof by suspending the solvate into a solution having<br>
a pH of about 7 to 11 or into a solution containing water, an<br>
organic solvent (e.g., alcohol), and a basic substance.<br>
The solvate of the imidazole compound represented above<br>
by the general formula (II' ) or a salt thereof is not particularly<br>
limited in its production method and can be produced according<br>
to a method known per se, but preferably produced with remarkably<br>
high production efficiency by oxidizing an imidazole compound<br>
represented above by the general formula (I') or a salt thereof<br>
according to the above-mentioned method of producing the oxidized<br>
compound of the present invention, and then crystallizing from<br><br>
an organic solvent or an aqueous organic solvent. When an organic<br>
solvent such as alcohols e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol,<br>
n-butanol, isobutanol, etc., ketones e.g., acetone,<br>
methylethylketone, etc., esters e.g., ethyl acetate, etc.,<br>
sulfoxides e.g., dimethylsulfoxide, etc., and amides e.g.,<br>
dimethylformamide, etc., is used, a crystal of solvate containing<br>
such solvent is obtained, and when a mixed solvent of alcohols<br>
e.g., methanol, ethanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, etc., ketones<br>
e.g., acetone, methylethylketone, etc., esters e.g., ethyl<br>
acetate, etc., sulfoxides e.g., dimethylsulfoxide, etc., amides<br>
e.g., dimethylformamide, etc., or the like and water is used,<br>
a crystal of solvate of water and organic solvent containing each<br>
1 molar equivalent of such organic solvent and water is obtained.<br>
As the organic solvent included in the above solution,<br>
alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, etc.) are<br>
preferable, and ethanol is particularly preferable. Examples<br>
of the basic substance included in the above solution include<br>
amine such as ammonia and triethylamine, alkali metal hydroxide<br>
such as sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium carbonate,<br>
and sodium hydrogen carbonate, alkaline earth metal hydroxide,<br>
alkali metal carbonate, alkaline earth metal carbonate, alkali<br>
metal hydrogencarbonate, and the like, and ammonia is preferably<br>
used among them. It is preferable that the pH of the above<br>
solution is in the range of about 7 to 11, and preferably in the<br>
range of about 8 to 9, by adding the basic substance. In addition,<br><br>
the content of the organic solvent (preferably, alcohol) and the<br>
basic substance with respect to water in the above solution is<br>
not particularly limited, as long as it is the amount such that<br>
pH of the solution is ranging from about 7 to 11. For the<br>
preferred operational condition, the ratio of a water-organic<br>
solvent (preferably, alcohol) is from 10 to 500:1 (weight ratio) ,<br>
preferably from 20 to 200:1 (weight ratio), and more preferably<br>
from 20 to 100:1 (weight ratio). The ratio of a water-basic<br>
substance-organic solvent (preferably, alcohol) is from 10 to<br>
500:0.0001 to 0.5:1 (weight ratio), preferably from 20 to<br>
200:0.001 to 0.5:1 (weight ratio), and more preferably from 20<br>
to 100:1 (weight ratio). For example, when ammonia is used as<br>
a basic substance, the ratio of a water-ammonia water<br>
(25%)-organic solvent (preferably, alcohol) is from 10 to<br>
500:0.005 to 0.5:1 (weight ratio), preferably from 20 to<br>
200:0.005 to 0.1:1 (weight ratio), and more preferably from 20<br>
to 100:0.005 to 0.1:1 (weight ratio). Although the content of<br>
alcohol with respect to water is very small in quantity (e.g.,<br>
alcohol included as a crystalline solvent in the solvate or<br>
alcohol adhered on the surface of a crystal of the solvate (by<br>
the process of washing the crystal, or the like) ) , there is still<br>
an action and effect of improving the stability of the crystal<br>
to be obtained (crystal substantially not containing a solvent) .<br>
On the other hand, when the content of alcohol with respect to<br>
water is increased beyond the aforementioned range, the<br><br>
range.<br>
The present inventors have found during various<br>
investigations to complete the method of the invention that the<br>
SUL (compound of which R2 is OCH2CF3, R1 is CH3/ R3 is H, R0 is<br>
H, and C' is a non-substituted benzene ring in the general formula<br>
(I' ) ) which is a starting compound of lansoprazole can be obtained<br>
preferably by a series of reactions as shown in the following<br>
formula, and particularly, that the yield is improved when the<br>
condensation reaction at the second stage is carried out by<br>
adjusting the pH to 11.0 - 11.5, thereby being industrially<br>
advantageous.<br><br><br>
Since the compound with less byproducts produced by an<br>
overreaction and higher purity can be obtained as the oxidized<br>
compound obtainable in the invention, the invention can be<br>
suitably applied for a large-scale production of the compound<br>
useful as particularly a drug, and the like. For example, when<br>
a proton pump inhibitor typified by lansoprazole, an optically<br><br>
active substance thereof, or the like is obtained as a target<br>
product, this product can be employed as an antiulcer agent, an<br>
anti H. pylori agent, or the like, for example, in accordance<br>
with the method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication No. S61-50978 or Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication No. H03-173817.<br>

kg) was added to the mixture, and the mixture was concentrated.<br>
To the residue were added methanol (656 L) and<br>
2-benzimidazolethiol (59.8 kg), then the pH was adjusted to 11.0<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
[Production of<br>
(+/-)-2-(((3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-2-pyridyl)meth<br>
yl)sulfinyl)benzimidazole]<br>
2-(((3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-2-pyridyl)meth<br>
yl)thio)benzimidazole monohydrate (141.6 kg) was dissolved in<br>
ethanol (1164 L), and vanadyl acetylacetonate (0.44 kg) wetted<br>
with ethanol (about 200 mL) was added to the solution. Thereafter,<br>
a 35% hydrogen peroxide solution (42 L) was added dropwise to<br>
the mixture at 16 to 22°C, and then the mixture was reacted at<br>
18 to 24°C until the electric potential dropped by 70 mV from<br>
the highest electric potential of the ORP (oxidation reduction<br>
potential) meter. After the electric potential dropped by 70<br>
mV and the reaction was completed, an aqueous sodium thiosulfate<br>
solution (12.7 kg/127 L) was added to the reaction solution, and<br>
the mixture was stirred. Triethylamine (7L) was added to the<br>
mixture, the precipitated crystals were dissolved with heating<br>
at about 50 to 55°C', the insolubles were removed by filtration<br>
with heating, and the filtrate was cooled to crystallize. The<br>
crystals were filtered, and washed with a cooled aqueous ethanol<br>
solution (ethanol:water = 9:1 (weight ratio)).<br>
Subsequently, to the obtained crystals were added a 25%<br><br>
aqueous ammonia solution (0.9 L) and an aqueous ethanol solution<br>
(ethanol:water =9:1 (weight ratio), 864 L), the mixture was<br>
heated under stirring to dissolve the crystals, and cooled to<br>
crystallize. The crystals were filtered, and washed with a<br>
cooled aqueous ethanol solution (ethanol:water = 9:1 and 7:3<br>

with water, and air dried to obtain 107.5 kg of<br>
(+/-)-2-(((3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-2-pyridyl)meth<br>
yl)sulfinyl)benzimidazole (lansoprazole) as white crystals<br>
(yield: 76.3%) . This crystal is referred to as lansoprazole I<br>
type crystal. The obtained crystals are stable.<br>

To about 190 kg of the wet crystals of the solvate of<br>
ethanol-water of<br>
(+/-)-2-(((3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-2-pyridyl)meth<br><br>
yl)sulfinyl)benzimidazole obtained according to the method in<br>
EXAMPLE 2 was added a mixed solution (pH of about 9) of water<br>
(about 1043 kg) , a 25% aqueous ammonia solution (about 500 mL) ,<br>
and ethanol (the composition of the mixed solution was adjusted<br>
to water: 25% aqueous ammonia solution: ethanol = about 19:0.008:1<br>
(weight ratio)), and thus obtained suspension was stirred at 24<br>
to 30°C for about 60 minutes. The crystals were filtered, washed<br>
with water, and air dried to obtain about 110 kg of<br>
(+/-)-2-(((3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-2-pyridyl)meth<br>

(yield: 94%).<br>
TEST 1<br>
The stability of the crystals of the solvate of lansoprazole<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as lansoprazole (1)) obtained by vacuum<br>
drying the wet crystals of the solvate of ethanol-water of<br>
lansoprazole obtained according to the method in EXAMPLE 2, was<br>
compared to the stability of the white crystals of lansoprazole<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as lansoprazole (2)) obtained<br>
according to the method in EXAMPLE 3. The results for each of<br>
3 samples for the lansoprazoles (1) and (2) are shown in the Table<br>
1 below.<br><br><br>
Herein, the "content" in Table 1 refers to the content of<br>
lansoprazole in lansoprazole crystals expressed in wt%, and was<br>
measured by HPLC technique (analyzed under each of following<br>
conditions: for (1), Column: NOVA PAK, C18, 3.9 x 150mm,<br>
Temperature: constant temperature of around 25°C', Mobile phase:<br>
solution prepared by adjusting the pH of<br>
methanol:water:triethylamine (weight ratio = 60:40:1) with<br>
phosphoric acid to 7 . 0, Flow rate: 0.5ml/min, Detector: UV 285nm,<br>
and for (2), Column: CAPCELL PAC', C18, SG120, 4.6 x 250mm,<br>
Temperature: constant temperature of around 25°C', Mobile phase:<br>
solution prepared by adjusting the pH of<br>
acetonitrile:water:triethylamine (weight ratio = 40:60:1) with<br>
phosphoric acid to 7.0, Flow rate: 1 ml/min, Detector: UV 285<br><br>
nm) . The "residual ratio after stored for 6 months at 40°C" was<br>
calculated by [(Content after stored for 6 months at<br>
40°C)/(Initial Content)] x 100 (%) .<br>
From the Table 1, followings are understood. The initial<br>
content of lansoprazole (2) is slightly higher than that of<br>
lansoprazole (1), but it is almost the same. However, when the<br>
content after being stored for 6 months at 40°C was compared,<br>
the content of lansoprazole (2), which was subjected to<br>
suspending in the solution of pH = about 9 which contains water,<br>
ethanol, and ammonia, was almost unchanged from the initial<br>
content (residual ratio was either 100% or almost 100%), where<br>
the content of lansoprazole (1), which was not subjected to<br>
suspending in the solution of pH = about 9 which contains water,<br>
ethanol, and ammonia, was notably reduced from the initial<br>
content (residual ratio was from about 84 to 91%) .<br>
As above, it is appreciated that the lansoprazole (2) is<br>
the crystal having more excellent stability as compared to the<br>
lansoprazole (1) .<br>
TEST 2<br>
In the method according to EXAMPLE 3, the amount of ethanol<br>
added to the mixed solution in which the wet crystals of the<br>
solvate of ethanol-water of lansoprazole are suspended was<br>
changed, and the stability of thus obtained crystals was<br>
compared.<br>
The crystals obtained from each of mixed solution systems<br><br>
shown in Table 2 below were each dissolved in dimethylformamide<br>
just after the preparation and after stored at 60°C for 15 days,<br>
and the absorbance (390 nm) of thus obtained solutions of crystals<br>
was measured. The degree of coloration was compared as an<br>
indicator of the crystal stability. The results are shown as<br>
a relation between the added amount of ethanol and the change<br>
in absorbance (390 nm) of solutions of crystals, in the Table<br>
2 below.<br>
The absorbance of the solution prepared by dissolving 1<br>
g of crystals into 10 mL of dimethyl formamide was measured with<br>
the use of a spectral photometer (Jasco No. 0214332).<br>
In addition, the pH of each mixed solution in which crystals<br>
are suspended was adjusted to about 9 with an aqueous ammonia<br>
solution.<br><br><br>
*1: derives from ethanol provided as a crystal solvent and ethanol<br>
adhered on a crystal surface<br>
*2: change in absorbance = [Absorbance of solution of crystals after stored at 60°C for 15 days] - [Absorbance of solution of<br>
crystals just after preparation]<br>
From the Table 2, it is appreciated that the amount of<br>
absorbance change decreased, that is, the degree of crystal<br>
coloration was reduced, as the added amount of ethanol to the<br>
 mixed solution in which crystals are suspended was increased.<br>
As above, it is appreciated that the stability of crystals<br>
was further improved by increasing the amount of ethanol to be<br>
added to the mixed solution in which crystals are suspended.<br>
