TRANSFER CHUTE APPARATUS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
(1)      Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention pertains to a bulk material transfer chute that transfers<br>
a flow of material from a discharge conveyor to a separate receiving conveyor.  In<br>
particular, the present invention pertains to a precision transfer chute that receives a<br>
flow of material from a discharge conveyor and transfers that material to a receiving<br>
conveyor and deposits the flow of material onto the surface of the receiving conveyor<br>
in a precise manner that avoids spillage of the material, avoids excess dust<br>
generation from the transfer of the material, reduces material degradation, reduces<br>
stress and wear of the receiving conveyor components thereby reducing<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
maintenance and repair costs, and reduces the power requirements of the receiving<br>
conveyor.<br>
(2)      Description of the Related Art<br>
The transporting of bulk material, for example coal, from one area to another<br>
often involves the transfer of a stream or flow of the material from one conveyor<br>
apparatus to another conveyor apparatus.  In the transfer of the material from the<br>
one conveyor to the other conveyor, it is often necessary that the material be<br>
discharged from a discharge end of the one conveyor and transferred onto a<br>
receiving end of the other conveyor. To facilitate this transfer of the bulk material,<br>
large hoppers or transfer chutes have been designed that receive the flow of material<br>
from the discharge conveyor and deposit or discharge the flow of material onto the<br>
receiving conveyor.<br>
The design of bulk material transfer chutes has remained basically unchanged<br>
for over the past 50 years. The typical transfer chute has a general box-like<br>
trapezoidal configuration with interior corners and edges where fine coal and dust<br>
can accumulate and create a fire or explosion hazard. The discharge conveyor is<br>
positioned at the top of the chute and the receiving conveyor is positioned at the<br>
bottom of the chute. The top opening of the transfer chute has a general rectangular<br>
configuration with interior corners and edges and at least one flat end wall positioned<br>
opposite the discharge end of the discharge conveyor. Material, for example coal,<br>
discharged from the discharge conveyor often impacts against the flat end wall<br>
before falling downwardly into the interior of the chute due to gravitational forces.<br>
The coal falls downwardly through a transition section of the chute. The chute<br>
transition section has flat sidewalls that meet at angled interior comers and converge<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
as they extend downwardly, with the cross sectional area of the chute's transition<br>
section reducing as the chute extends downwardly.<br>
A loading section is positioned below the chute transition section. The loading<br>
section also has flat side walls with angled interior corners and sliding interior<br>
surfaces that direct the coal in the direction and speed of the receiving conveyor.<br>
A loading skirt is positioned at the bottom of the loading section. The loading<br>
skirt has sidewalls that extend along a portion of the receiving conveyor length, and<br>
a top wall or cover that extends over the skirted portion of the receiving conveyor.<br>
The chute loading section discharges the bulk material onto the portion of the<br>
receiving conveyor inside the loading skirt. The loading skirt sidewalls prevent<br>
spillage of coal from the sides of the conveyor resulting from the turbulence of the<br>
material transferred onto the conveyor, and the top wall forms a dust containment<br>
chamber with the sidewalls to minimize dust created by the turbulence.  The<br>
turbulence is created in the material by the uncontrolled flow of the material through<br>
the chute and the change in the material velocity when the faster moving material<br>
impacts with the slower moving receiving conveyor. The skirt functions to minimize<br>
dust and spillage of the bulk material that pours from the bottom of the loading<br>
section onto the receiving conveyor. The skirt is also intended to minimize the dust<br>
generated by material such as coal, pouring through the bottom of the loading<br>
section and impacting with the belt surface of the receiving conveyor.<br>
Rubber seals are commonly arranged along the outer sides of the skirt<br>
sidewalls adjacent to the receiving conveyor. The rubber seals are mounted to the<br>
skirt sidewalls by means of clamping-type apparatus. The apparatus hold the rubber<br>
seals in contact with the receiving conveyor and form a seal with the receiving<br>
conveyor that prevents the passage of dust from the receiving conveyor. The rubber<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
seals are designed as consumable parts, and through their constant contact with the<br>
receiving conveyor in providing an efficient seal, require regular maintenance and<br>
frequent replacement.  Additionally, the constant pressure of the contact of the seals<br>
against the receiving conveyor on both sides of the conveyor system creates a<br>
frictional drag on the receiving conveyor that requires increasing the horsepower of<br>
the receiving conveyor motive source, thus increasing the cost of operating the<br>
conveyor.<br>
The conventional bulk material transfer chute described above is<br>
disadvantaged in several respects. The bulk material discharged from the discharge<br>
conveyor that impacts with the transfer chute at the top of the chute interior creates<br>
dust, reduces the size of the material deposited into the chute, and causes wear to<br>
the wall of the chute that is impacted by the material. The impact of the material with<br>
the interior wall surfaces and corners causes a continuous build-up of material and<br>
can cause plugging of the chute. The plugging stops the flow of material through the<br>
chute and increases safety risks due to the potential for fire or an explosion, and<br>
increases maintenance costs to clear the plug. The material that falls through the<br>
chute transition section can spread out and entrain air that carries dust through the<br>
chute and out of the chute.  In some chute transition and loading section designs, the<br>
freefall of the bulk material through the chute and onto the surface of the receiving<br>
conveyor can cause wear to the conveyor and can generate dust or spillage. The<br>
random flow of the material through the chute can cause off center loading of the<br>
material on the surface of the receiving conveyor. This often results in spillage of the<br>
material from the sides of the receiving conveyor which increases maintenance costs<br>
for maintaining the skirting, and presents a safety and health hazard due to dust<br>
generation which could be inhaled by persons or could create a fire or explosion<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
hazard. The need for the loading skirt at the output of the chute transition section<br>
also adds to maintenance costs and increases the overall cost and health and safety<br>
risks of the transfer chute. The skirt drags on the conveyor causing wear to the<br>
conveyor and skirt, and increases power requirements of the conveyor. The skirt<br>
drag also requires that the skirt and conveyor be repaired or components replaced<br>
more frequently.<br>
Recent advancements have been made in controlling the material stream and<br>
velocity through the chute by means of computer-generated discrete element<br>
modeling (DEM).   Discrete element modeling accounts for the bulk material particle<br>
size and a theoretical coefficient of friction which simulates varying chute liner<br>
materials in an effort to predict the behavior of the material as it passes through the<br>
chute. The angular slope of the chute interior walls are arranged and adjusted so as<br>
to control the velocity of the bulk material passing through the chute and maintain a<br>
compressed material profile passing through the chute.<br>
While DEM has proved to be successful in many applications, this method of<br>
chute design also has distinct disadvantages.   DEM, as with conventional chute<br>
design, employs the use of a skirt system at the loading point on the receiving<br>
conveyor, with the same components and disadvantages as described previously.<br>
Additionally, DEM is based on a single bulk material particle size and<br>
coefficient of friction controlling the material profile and velocity as it passes through<br>
the chute.  Often these particular design criteria vary throughout the expected life of<br>
a bulk material handling system.  In a power plant application, frequently material<br>
particle size changes due to altering suppliers of coal and often due to associated<br>
equipment performance such as coal crushers and granulators. This change in<br>
particle size would result in the necessity to remodel the design of the chute to<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
accurately control the velocity and profile of material passing through the chute.<br>
Environmental conditions such as high moisture content due to heavy rain and<br>
freezing conditions, adversely affect the coefficient of friction between the bulk<br>
material particles and the boundary surfaces of the chute interior. This change in the<br>
coefficient of friction as a result of varying environment conditions renders the DEM<br>
inefficient in controlling material velocity.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The bulk material precision transfer chute apparatus of the present invention<br>
overcomes the disadvantages associated with prior art transfer chutes discussed<br>
above by providing an adjustable and novel transfer and loading chute construction<br>
that transfers bulk material from a discharge conveyor to a receiving conveyor while<br>
controlling the material velocity and profile, avoiding material degradation, reducing<br>
the generation of dust, reducing accumulation of material within the chute, and<br>
reducing wear to the transfer chute and receiving conveyor. The transfer chute of<br>
the invention also eliminates the need for a loading skirt, thereby reducing the<br>
transfer chute manufacturing costs, maintenance costs, safety and health risks, and<br>
energy consumption.  The chute construction provides the benefits of vertical<br>
adjustments of the chute flow path to best suit it for the condition of the coal (i.e. wet<br>
or dry). Wet coal could be dropped more vertically to prevent build-up and to adjust<br>
the velocity of discharge to the receiving conveyor.  Horizontal adjustment also<br>
allows for center loading of the receiving conveyor. The adjustability avoids plugging<br>
of the chute.<br>
The bulk material transfer chute apparatus of the present invention is<br>
comprised of a curved hood positioned at the top of the chute, a curved or round<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
funnel-shaped transition section, and an adjustable, round loading tube positioned<br>
below the transition section.  The component parts of the transfer chute are<br>
constructed of a metal or other similar type of abrasion resistant material and are<br>
supported by an exterior framework. A discharge conveyor conveys bulk material,<br>
for example coal, into the transfer chute at the top of the chute, and a receiving<br>
conveyor conveys the material discharged from the bottom of the chute.<br>
The hood section of the transfer chute has a curved configuration.  The hood<br>
is positioned opposite the discharge end of the discharge conveyor and redirects<br>
material discharged from the conveyor into a top opening of the chute transition<br>
section. The hood section is designed so that an opening device can be applied to<br>
allow easy access to the chute interior. This method of accessibility provides lower<br>
maintenance costs and increased safety. The curved shape of the hood captures<br>
the material and maintains a compact material profile. The hood is resistant to wear<br>
and reduces material impact forces, thereby minimizing the degradation of material<br>
and the generation of dust.<br>
The transition section has a top opening that receives the material redirected<br>
by the hood. The material redirected by the curved hood slides downwardly through<br>
the interior volume of the transition section. The transition section has a general<br>
funnel shape with rounded corners. A cross sectional area of the transition section<br>
interior decreases as the transition section extends downwardly.  The transition<br>
section is constructed of rolled or rounded plates that are designed to allow the<br>
material sliding through the transition section to concentrate into a compressed<br>
stream with a reduced cross sectional area profile as the material is directed<br>
downwardly toward the bottom of the transition section. The walls of the transition<br>
section are designed with a sufficient slope and curvature to prevent the build-up of<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
the material in the transition section, even if the flow of material is stopped by<br>
stopping the receiving conveyor. The sloped walls of the transition section and the<br>
reducing cross sectional area of the transition section control material flow through<br>
the section and minimize entrained air in the material, minimize accumulation of<br>
material, minimize the degradation of the material, and minimize the generation of<br>
dust due to reduced turbulence of the material. The slope of the transition section<br>
walls together with materials of construction such as lining material that improves the<br>
velocity of the material flow control the velocity of the material through the section to<br>
match the velocity of the receiving conveyor. The transition section can also be<br>
equipped with an internal diverter plate that assists in controlling the flow of material<br>
through the section to ensure center loading of the material on the receiving<br>
conveyor.<br>
The loading tube of the transfer chute apparatus is mounted at the bottom of<br>
the transition section. The loading tube has an interior bore with a circular cross<br>
section along its length. The circular cross section of the loading tube bore allows<br>
the material flowing through the tube to scour away any build-up and eliminates any<br>
corners for the material to accumulate.<br>
The length of the loading tube is curved as it extends from the transition<br>
section toward the receiving conveyor. The curved loading tube length and its<br>
adjustable downward angle are designed to place the material discharged from the<br>
tube onto the conveyor belt at an angle of discharge that minimizes impact of the<br>
material on the belt, thereby reducing impact damage to the belt and minimizing the<br>
generation of dust. The output end of the loading tube is adjustable both horizontally<br>
and vertically and is dimensioned and shaped so that it positions the discharged<br>
material onto the receiving conveyor evenly, centered, and in a profile similar to the<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
final, settled profile of the material on the conveyor. This minimizes the likelihood of<br>
spillage from the belt.<br>
A connection assembly mounts the loading tube to the bottom end of the<br>
transition section. The connection assembly enables movement of the loading tube<br>
through an arc segment relative to the transfer chute apparatus. A rubber seal or<br>
boot surrounds the connection between the loading tube and the transition section to<br>
provide a primary dust tight seal. A secondary dust seal is also provided inside the<br>
boot.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the upper end of the loading tube is connected<br>
to a lower end of the transition section by a pivot connection. A cylindrical bottom<br>
portion of the transition section is smaller than the cylindrical upper portion of the<br>
loading tube. The smaller diameter dimension of the transition section bottom<br>
portion relative to the loading tube upper portion enables the loading tube to extend<br>
upwardly surrounding the transition section, enabling free pivoting movement of the<br>
loading tube relative to the transition section.<br>
An adjustment mechanism is connected between the loading tube and the<br>
chute transition section. Adjusting the length of the mechanism adjusts the angular<br>
position of the loading tube relative to the transition section. The mechanism allows<br>
for the angular adjustment of the loading tube relative to the receiving conveyor,<br>
thereby enabling the adjustment of the angle of discharge of material from the<br>
loading tube onto the belt of the receiving conveyor. The angular adjustment of the<br>
loading tube relative to the receiving conveyor controls the velocity of the material<br>
flow through the chute and thereby prevents plugging and minimizes spillage of the<br>
material discharged from the tube and placed onto the conveyor belt.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show an embodiment of the bulk material precision transfer<br>
chute apparatus 10 of the present invention. The apparatus 10 is shown in Figure 1<br>
supported by a schematically represented framework 14 between the discharge end<br>
of a discharge conveyor 16 and the receiving end of a receiving conveyor 18.  In the<br>
illustrative environment of the apparatus 10 shown in Figures 1,2, and 3, the<br>
apparatus is used to transfer bulk material, for example coal, from the discharge<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
conveyor 16 positioned above the apparatus to the receiving conveyor 18 positioned<br>
below the apparatus.  It should be understood that the environment shown in Figures<br>
1, 2, and 3 is illustrative only, and should not be interpreted as limiting. As shown in<br>
Figures 1 and 2, the bulk material transfer apparatus 10 of the invention is basically<br>
comprised of a hood 22 positioned at the top of the apparatus, a transition section 26<br>
positioned below the hood 22, and a loading tube 28 positioned below the transition<br>
section 26.  Each of these component parts of the apparatus are constructed or lined<br>
of metal or other types of materials that are resistant to abrasion and wear. The<br>
discharge conveyor 16 and receiving conveyor 18 are shown schematically to<br>
represent the typical constructions of belt conveyors. Other types of conveying<br>
apparatus may also be employed with the bulk material transfer chute apparatus of<br>
the invention.<br>
The hood 22 is shown in Figures 1,2,3, and 4. The hood 22 is basically<br>
comprised of a vertically curved wall 32. The wall 32 extends as a continuous<br>
curved surface from a bottom edge 34 of the hood positioned on the transition<br>
section 26, and an opposite top edge 36 of the hood that is positioned over a top<br>
opening of the transition section 26. The curved vertical surface of the hood wall 32<br>
functions to guide material conveyed by the discharge conveyor 16 into the transition<br>
section 26. The curved vertical surface of the hood wall 32 redirects bulk material,<br>
for example coal, discharged from the discharge conveyor 16 downwardly into the<br>
transition section while reducing the impact force of the discharged material against<br>
the interior surface of the hood 22. As can best be seen in Figures 2 and 3, the hood<br>
wall 32 also has a general horizontally curved interior surface. This horizontal<br>
curvature of the hood wall 32 also functions to redirect and minimize entrained air in<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
the bulk material discharged from the discharge conveyor 16 downwardly into the<br>
transition section 26.<br>
A pair of hinge assemblies 38 shown in Figures 1 and 4 connect the hood<br>
bottom edge 34 to the transition section 26. The hinge assemblies 38 enable the<br>
hood to be pivoted between a first position shown in Figure 1, with the hood top edge<br>
36 positioned directly above the transition section 26, and a second position of the<br>
hood relative to the transition section 26 where the hood 22 is displaced to one side<br>
of the transition section 26. In the second position of the hood 22 it is clear of the<br>
discharge conveyor 16 and the transition section for servicing of these components.<br>
The transition section 26 supports the hood 22 on the apparatus 10. The<br>
hood could be supported by other separate structures. As best seen in Figure 3, the<br>
top of the transition section 26 has a polygonal configuration defined by a plurality of<br>
side walls 42 that surround an interior volume of the top of the section. The side<br>
walls 42 define the top opening of the transfer chute interior volume that extends<br>
downwardly into the transition section 26.<br>
Figure 5 is a top plan view of the transition section 26. As shown in Figure 5,<br>
the transition section 26 is comprised of a plurality of wall panels that give the<br>
section its general funnel shape. The panels include a plurality of elongated<br>
triangular panels 44, a plurality of larger triangular panels 46 and a generally arcuate<br>
panel 48 that are secured together side by side to define the rounded funnel shape<br>
of the transition section. The configurations and positioning of the panels 44, 46, 48<br>
defines an interior volume of the transition section 26 that has a cross-sectional area<br>
that decreases as the transition section extends downwardly from a top opening 52<br>
to a bottom opening 54 of the transition section. The plurality of panels 44, 46, 48<br>
give the transition section 26 an interior surface that is curved on all sides of the<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
transition section 26 directly below the hood 22. The curved surfaces are designed<br>
to allow the material falling through the transition section from the top opening 52 to<br>
the bottom opening 54 to concentrate into a stream with a reduced cross-sectional<br>
area profile. The panels 44, 46, 48 can be lined with or constructed of materials that<br>
are resistant to abrasion orwear. The pane! material is specifically selected to meet<br>
parameters for wear as well as a coefficent of friction that determines the material<br>
velocity. The panels 44, 46, 48 of the transition section 26 are designed with a<br>
sufficient slope to prevent plugging and the buildup of material in the transition<br>
section. The combination of the sloped panels 44, 46, 48 of the transition section,<br>
the reducing cross-sectional area of the transition section, the panel material<br>
coefficient of friction and transition section length control the material profile and the<br>
velocity of flow through the section and minimize entrained air in the material,<br>
minimize material accumulation, minimize the degradation of the material, and<br>
minimize the generation of dust due to collisions of the material.<br>
A diverter plate 56 is secured to the interior of the transition section 26. The<br>
diverter plate 56 is spaced above and is centered relative to the transition section<br>
bottom opening 54. The position of the diverter plate is determined by the type of<br>
material to pass through the chute, the typical volume of the material to be passed<br>
through the chute, and the length of the chute vertical drop from the discharge<br>
conveyor to the receiving conveyor. The diverter plate 56 has a V-shaped cross<br>
section with the apex of the V directed upwardly so as to divert the flow of material<br>
around the plate and not provide a shelf on which material can accumulate. The<br>
space directly below the diverter plate can be used to mount other devices out of the<br>
way of the material flow to avoid deterioration or damage to the devices due to<br>
contact with the material flow.   For example, devices such as fire protection devices,<br>

WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
chemical distribution devices, control devices and others can be positioned directly<br>
beneath the diverter plate 56.<br>
The diverter plate 56 is positioned in the center of the transition section 26<br>
toward the bottom of the section and directly above the circular bottom opening 54 of<br>
the section. The diverter plate 56 functions to split the stream of material as it flows<br>
downwardly across the rear interior wall surface of the transition section 26 diverting<br>
a portion of the material stream to each side of the section bottom opening 54.<br>
Some of the diverted material will be backwashed and return to the transition section<br>
rear wall and some of the material will flow freely to the front of the section bottom<br>
opening 54. This functioning of the diverter plate 56 assures even distribution of the<br>
material flow through the transition section bottom opening 54 while reducing the<br>
amount of entrained air traveling with the material flow.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the diameter dimension of the transition section<br>
bottom opening 54 is designed in consideration of the bridging effect based on the<br>
maximum material particle size as determined by standard engineering practice.<br>
The height of the lower end of the diverter plate 56 as shown in Figure 6 has been<br>
determined by experimentation to be one and a half times the dimension of the<br>
transition section bottom opening 54 to account for the bridging effect along with the<br>
reduced material velocity resulting from impact with the diverter plate 56.<br>
A pair of pivot pin mounts having coaxially aligned holes 58 are mounted on<br>
diametrically opposite sides of the transition section. The pivot mounts 58 are<br>
positioned adjacent the bottom opening 54 of the transition section. As will be<br>
explained, the pivot mounts 58 are used in mounting the loading tube 28 to the<br>
transition section 26.<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
As shown in Figures 1, 2 and 6, the loading tube 28 is suspended beneath the<br>
transition section 26 of the apparatus 10. The loading tube 28 has a hollow interior<br>
bore 60 that extends from an input end 62 of the tube to an output end 64 of the<br>
tube.  In the preferred embodiment, the interior bore 60 has a circular cross-sectional<br>
area through the entire length of the loading tube from the input end 62 to the output<br>
end 64. A non-circular cross section may also be used. A pair of triangular wing<br>
guides 72 project outwardly from the tube output end 64. As best seen in Figure 7,<br>
the loading tube 28 can be comprised of multiple upper portions 66 and a lower<br>
portion 68. The loading tube input end 62 on the tube upper portion 66 surrounds<br>
the transition section bottom opening 54 with the bottom opening being positioned in<br>
the interior of the loading tube 28. A pair of coaxial pivot pins 74 project inwardly<br>
from diametrically opposite sides from the interior of the loading tube upper portion<br>
66. The pins 74 engage in the holes of the pivot mounts 58 on the transition section<br>
26. The loading tube pins 74 and the pivot mounts 58 provide a connection<br>
assembly that mounts the loading tube 28 to the bottom end of the transition section<br>
26. The pivoting connection enables the loading tube 28 to be pivoted through an<br>
arc relative to the transition section 26 between first and second positions of the tube<br>
28 shown in dashed lines in Figure 7. Other types of connections permitting relative<br>
movement between the loading tube 28 and the transition section 26 may be<br>
employed.  As best seen in Figure 7, the loading tube lower portion 68 extends<br>
through a continuous curve from the loading tube upper portion 66 to the output end<br>
64 of the loading tube. This curved portion of the loading tube 28 is designed to<br>
place the material discharged from the tube onto the belt of the receiving conveyor<br>
18 at an angle and velocity of discharge that minimizes impact of the material onto<br>
the belt and thereby reduces impact damage to the belt and minimizes the<br>
-15-<br><br>
generation of dust. The ability of the loading tube 28 to be moved relative to the<br>
transition section 26 also enables the tube to position and profile the discharged<br>
material properly onto the belt of the receiving conveyor 18 to minimize the likelihood<br>
of material spillage from belt<br>
The pair of wing guides 72 are formed at the lower end of the loading tube 28<br>
at the tube output end 64. The wing guides 72 function to provide a guide for the<br>
material as it exits the loading tube output end 64 to form the material in its natural<br>
profile when transferred to the receiving conveyor. In the preferred embodiment, the<br>
height of the wing guides 72 on the tube output end 64 and the length to which the<br>
wing guides extend from the output end is equal to the approximate cross sectional<br>
height of the material exiting the tube output end as determined by standard<br>
engineering practice. For ease of manufacturing and as determined by<br>
experimentation, the wing guide length is equal to the wing guide height. As shown<br>
in the top plan view of the wing guides 72 in Figure 9, the wing guides are bent<br>
outwardly away from the center of the loading tube output end 64. The dimension<br>
between the distal tips of the wing guides 72 as viewed in Figure 9 is equal to the<br>
normal width of the material profile in its natural position on the receiving conveyor<br>
as determined by standard engineering practice.<br>
A rubber primary seal or boot 76 surrounds the connection between the<br>
loading tube 28 and the transition section 26. The seal 76 provides a dust-tight seal<br>
between the connection of the loading tube 28 and the transition section 26.<br>
An adjustment mechanism 82 is connected between the loading tube 28 and<br>
the hopper transition section 26 of the apparatus. In the example shown, the<br>
adjustment mechanism 82 includes a linear actuator 84 that is connected by pivot<br>
connections to a flange 86 that projects from the transition section 26 and a flange<br>
-16-<br><br>
88 that projects from the loading tube 28. Other similar functioning mechanisms may<br>
be used in lieu of the actuator 84. Adjusting the length of the actuator 84 adjusts the<br>
angular position of the loading tube 28 relative to the transition section 26. Thus, the<br>
mechanism 82 allows for the angular adjustment of the loading tube 28 relative to<br>
the belt of the receiving conveyor 18, thereby enabling the adjustment of the angle of<br>
discharge and velocity of material from the loading tube 28 onto the belt of the<br>
receiving conveyor 18. As stated earlier, the angular adjustment of the loading tube<br>
28 relative to the receiving conveyor 18 minimizes spillage of the material discharged<br>
from the tube onto the belt of the conveyor, minimizes material accumulation,<br>
minimizes wear to the belt of the conveyor, and minimizes the generation of dust.<br>
The boot 76 functions as a primary seal between the transition section 26 and<br>
the loading tube 28. As shown in Figure 7, the top of the primary seal 76 is secured<br>
around a circular flange 92 on the transition chute 26 by a two-piece circular clamp<br>
94. A lower end of the primary seal 76 is secured around the loading tube 28 by<br>
another two-piece, circular clamp 96. The primary seal 76 functions to eliminate any<br>
dust emissions escaping from the flexible pivoting connection between the transition<br>
section 26 and the loading tube 28. The primary seal 76 is preferably constructed of<br>
a chemical resistant impermeable membrane such as, but not limited to, PVC coated<br>
nylon material. In addition to chemical resistance, this material should be weather<br>
and UV resistant for outside applications. The actual material properties should be<br>
determined by standard engineering practice based on specific applications. The<br>
impermeable membrane 76 is loosely wrapped around the transition section 26 at its<br>
upper end and the loading tube 28 at its lower end to allow for free movement of the<br>
loading tube 28 about the pivot pin connections 74. The ends of the primary seal 76<br>
-17-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
can be heat sealed, taped, or glued to form a continuous closed surface around the<br>
transition section 26 and the loading tube 28.<br>
A secondary seal 102 is provided inside the primary seal 76 and between the<br>
transition section 26 and the loading tube 28. The secondary seal 102 also functions<br>
to reduce dust emissions at the flexible pivoting connection between the transition<br>
section 26 and the loading tube 28.<br>
A circular flange 104 is welded to the upper end of the transfer tube 28. A<br>
circle of bolt holes is provided through the flange 104. The circular secondary seal<br>
102 shown in Figure 8 is positioned on the flange 104. A circular retaining ring 106<br>
similar in construction to the circular flange 104 is secured on top of the secondary<br>
seal 102 by a plurality of bolts.<br>
As viewed in Figure 9, the secondary seal 102 has a center opening that is<br>
dimensioned approximately four inches smaller than the outside diameter of the<br>
cylindrical bottom opening 54 of the transition section 26. A plurality of slits 108 are<br>
cut into the seal to allow the cylindrical bottom opening 54 of the transition section 26<br>
to be inserted through the secondary seal 102. The circular opening and lapped<br>
edges of the secondary seal 102 with the exterior of the transition section cylindrical<br>
bottom opening 54 form a flexible semi-permeable seal allowing free movement of<br>
the loading tube 28 about its pivot connections 74 to the transition section 26.<br>
Figures 7 and 9 show horizontal adjustment flanges 112, 114 that enable<br>
adjusting the horizontal position of the output end 64 of the loading tube 28. The<br>
horizontal adjustment flanges include an upper flange 112 that is secured to the<br>
bottom end of the loading tube upper portion 66, and a lower flange 114 that is<br>
secured to an upper end of the loading tube lower portion 68.  Each of the flanges<br>
112, 114 has sets of oblong holes that are spatially arranged around the<br>
-18-<br><br>
WO 2006/076140	PCT/US2005/046384<br>
circumferences of the flanges.  Figure 9 shows the oblong holes 116 in the flange<br>
114 of the loading tube lower portion 68. The aligned holes of the two flanges 112,<br>
114 are secured together by threaded fasteners, for example nuts and bolts. The<br>
oblong shape of the holes of the flanges enables the loading tube lower portion 68 to<br>
be moved relative to the loading tube upper portion 66 to a limited extent to<br>
horizontally position the loading tube output end 64 over the receiving conveyor 18.<br>
If a greater horizontal adjustment of the position of the loading tube output end 64 is<br>
needed, the threaded fasteners can be removed from the holes of the two flanges<br>
112, 114 and the flanges can be rotated relative to each other to realign other holes<br>
of the two flanges to adjust the position of the loading tube lower portion 68 relative<br>
to the loading tube upper portion 66 and thereby adjust the horizontal position of the<br>
loading tube output end 64.<br>
