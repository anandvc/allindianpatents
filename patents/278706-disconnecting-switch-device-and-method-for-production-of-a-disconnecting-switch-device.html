				<td>Description<br>
Disconnecting switch device and method for production of a<br>
disconnecting switch device<br>
The invention relates to a disconnecting switch device having a<br>
first electrode piece and a second electrode piece, which<br>
electrode pieces can be moved relative to one another in order<br>
to disconnect a current path and are at least partially<br>
surrounded by an electrically insulating housing, and to a<br>
method for production of a disconnecting switch device.<br>
By way of example, a disconnecting switch device is known from<br>
the laid-open specification DE 100 25 685 Al. In the known<br>
disconnecting switch device, two electrode pieces are<br>
surrounded by an electrically insulating housing. Since<br>
disconnecting switch devices such as these are also intended<br>
for outdoor use, the electrically insulating housing must be<br>
manufactured from weather-resistant material. However,<br>
materials showing good electrical characteristics are often<br>
unsuitable for outdoor use.<br>
An object of the invention is therefore to specify a<br>
disconnecting switch device of the type mentioned initially<br>
which has good weather resistance.<br>
In the case of a disconnecting switch device of the type<br>
mentioned initially, the object is achieved according to the<br>
invention in that the housing has a first and a second shell,<br>
with the first shell sheathing the second shell and protecting<br>
it against external influences.<br>
When using a two-shell housing, the first shell may be<br>
manufactured from a material which has good<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
weather resistance. The first shell should preferably be formed<br>
from an insulating material. In particular, the first shell<br>
should be highly resistant to ultraviolet radiation and<br>
weathering. A material for the second shell can preferably be<br>
chosen on the basis of its electrical characteristics. For<br>
example, it is possible to use low-cost insulating materials.<br>
The volume of the first shell should advantageously be less<br>
than the volume of the second shell. The housing surrounds the<br>
two electrode pieces at least in the section in which the<br>
electrode pieces face one another. Disconnecting switch devices<br>
are also referred to as arrester disconnectors.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement, the first shell<br>
can be a lost shell for the second shell.<br>
If the first shell is used as a lost shell, then the<br>
disconnecting device can easily be fitted. The layers of the<br>
individual assemblies can be fixed with respect to one another<br>
in a simple manner by means of appropriate shaping. Since the<br>
shell acts as the first shell, auxiliary devices or special<br>
tools are required only to a minor extent during assembly. The<br>
first shell, as a shell, provides the disconnecting switch<br>
device with stability until the final characteristics are<br>
reached.<br>
It is advantageously also possible to provide for the first<br>
electrode piece to close a recess in the first shell.<br>
By way of example, the first shell may be in the form of a<br>
hollow body with at least one recess. A<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
rotationally symmetrical shape in the form of a cup is<br>
advantageous, with the recess advantageously being arranged in<br>
a base of the cup.<br>
By closing the recess with the first electrode piece, it is<br>
possible to gain access to the first electrode piece through<br>
the electrically insulating housing. The disconnecting switch<br>
device with the first electrode piece can then be included, for<br>
example, in a dissipation current path controlled by a surge<br>
arrester. Insertion of the first electrode piece with a<br>
complementary shape into the recess makes it possible to fix<br>
the relative position of the first shell with respect to the<br>
first electrode piece.<br>
Furthermore, according to one advantageous refinement, the<br>
recess can be surrounded by a projecting attachment on the<br>
first shell.<br>
The projecting attachment can protect that area of the first<br>
electrode piece which is accessible through the recess against<br>
external influences. The attachment may be in the form of a<br>
closed ring, for this purpose. Furthermore, a contact-making<br>
point in the area of the recess can be protected by the<br>
attachment. For example, this makes it possible for the<br>
disconnecting switch device to be screwed to a threaded bolt or<br>
into a threaded hole by means of the first electrode piece in<br>
the area of the recess in the first shell. The projecting<br>
attachment can act as a stop, and can delimit the screwing-in<br>
depth. Assuming adequate elasticity, a sealing effect can also<br>
be achieved by means of the attachment.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous for the first electrode piece<br>
and the second electrode piece to be aligned coaxially with<br>
respect to a longitudinal axis of the disconnecting switch<br>
device,<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
with a first end of the first electrode piece being adjacent to<br>
the first shell, and with a second end of the second electrode<br>
piece being adjacent to the second shell, with respect to the<br>
longitudinal axis.<br>
Since the second electrode piece is arranged at a distance from<br>
the first shell above the second shell, an isolation gap can be<br>
ensured between the electrode pieces even when using an<br>
electrical conductor material for the first shell. The second<br>
shell is formed like a type of cap, which merges flush with the<br>
first electrode piece and is separated from the second<br>
electrode piece in an electrically isolated manner by the<br>
second shell. The electrode pieces may preferably be in the<br>
form of rotationally symmetrical bodies.<br>
It is advantageously also possible to provide for the current<br>
path to have an arc gap.<br>
An arc gap may be arranged between the electrode pieces. By way<br>
of example, the arc gap can be bridged by an impedance element.<br>
The response of the arc gap can be controlled by the impedance<br>
element, which is preferably of a resistive nature. When<br>
current is flowing through the current path, an arc can be<br>
formed in the arc gap. The thermal energy of the arc can be<br>
used in order to trip the disconnecting switch device and to<br>
interrupt the current path. After interruption, the distance<br>
between the electrode pieces is sufficiently great that the arc<br>
is quenched, and does not restrike.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement, the second<br>
shell may be formed from a polyurethane.<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
Polyurethanes have an adequate dielectric strength and can be<br>
obtained at low cost. Polyurethanes may, for example, be<br>
introduced into the first shell in a liquid or highly viscous<br>
form, and can be cured there. A two-shell, electrically<br>
insulating housing is thus formed which prevents the formation<br>
of undesirable parallel current paths between the electrode<br>
pieces. In this case, the first shell makes contact at most<br>
with one of the two electrode pieces. The second shell may make<br>
contact with both electrode pieces. The second shell surrounds<br>
and bridges the arc gap in an electrically isolating manner.<br>
If the first shell is in the form of a cup, inner walls are<br>
covered by the second shell, except for areas in which a recess<br>
is arranged. The second shell can therefore merge flush both<br>
with the electrode pieces and with the first shell, and can<br>
thus form a moisture-tight assembly. The second shell can<br>
preferably form an adhesive joint between the first shell and<br>
the electrode pieces.<br>
It is advantageously also possible to provide for the first<br>
shell to be formed from a UV-stable insulating material.<br>
The use of insulating material for forming the first shell<br>
assists the electrically isolating effect of the second shell.<br>
Furthermore, when the two shells are connected by means of an<br>
integral joint, this can result in a connection with<br>
particularly good resistance. The electrode pieces and further<br>
assemblies can likewise be connected by an integral joint to<br>
the second shell. The use of insulating materials both for the<br>
first and for the second shell also ensures that the electrode<br>
pieces are protected against direct contact. Thermoplastic<br>
 <br>
insulating materials often have adequate UV resistance.<br>
A further object of the invention is to specify a method which<br>
allows a disconnecting switch device to be manufactured at low<br>
cost.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved for a method<br>
for production of a disconnecting switch device in that<br>
-	a first and a second electrode piece of a disconnecting<br>
switch device are at least partially inserted into a<br>
dimensionally stable first shell, which is used as a lost<br>
shell, of an electrically insulating housing of the<br>
disconnecting switch device,<br>
-	a second shell of the electrically insulating housing is<br>
introduced in a dimensionally flexible manner into the first<br>
shell, with the second shell being changed to a dimensionally<br>
stable body within the second shell.<br>
The first shell can be designed to be dimensionally stable such<br>
that it can be positioned relative to the electrode pieces and<br>
can withstand the forces originating from the dimensionally<br>
flexible shell. The first shell can therefore always be<br>
elastically deformable. However, it should retain its shape<br>
without the use of any external holding and supporting<br>
apparatuses.<br>
The dimensionally flexible second shell should have a fluid,<br>
preferably liquid or flowing consistency while being introduced<br>
into the first shell. Highly viscous substances can also be<br>
understood as being liquid for the purposes of the invention.<br>
During the introduction process, the second shell may also be<br>
in the form of a plurality of components, which react with one<br>
another within the first shell.<br>
 <br>
According to a further advantageous refinement, an impedance<br>
element, which makes electrical contact with the first<br>
electrode piece and with the second electrode piece, can be<br>
embedded in the second shell.<br>
The electrode pieces of the disconnecting switch device are<br>
part of a current path when in the installed state. The current<br>
path may contain an arc gap. For example, the electrode pieces<br>
may be arranged at a distance from one another, with a gas<br>
being arranged in the arc gap that is formed in this way. In<br>
order to control the breakdown behavior of the gas relatively<br>
accurately, an impedance element can bridge the arc gap. In<br>
order to avoid external influencing of the impedance element,<br>
it should be arranged at a distance from the first shell. In<br>
order to prevent direct contact with the first shell, parts of<br>
the second shell should extend between the impedance element<br>
and the first shell. This results in the impedance element<br>
being held in a dielectrically safe manner irrespective of the<br>
choice of material for the first shell. The impedance element<br>
should preferably be completely sheathed by the second shell,<br>
in such a way that connecting pieces pass through the second<br>
shell in order to allow electrical contact to be made with the<br>
impedance element.<br>
It is advantageously also possible to provide for the first<br>
electrode piece to be inserted in a sealing manner into a<br>
recess in the first shell.<br>
Interlocking insertion of the first electrode piece into the<br>
recess seals the first shell such that the second shell can be<br>
introduced, for example in the liquid state, into the first<br>
shell. In this case, depending on the expected viscosity of the<br>
second shell, it is possible to use different forms of fit,<br>
such as clearance fits, interference fits, or the like. If<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
required, it is thus possible to dispense with additional<br>
sealing elements.<br>
By way of example, it is possible to provide a shoulder on the<br>
first electrode piece and/or on the recess, thus limiting the<br>
depth of insertion of the electrode piece into the recess. It<br>
is thus possible to produce a flush transition to the first<br>
electrode piece on a surface of the first shell.<br>
It is advantageously also possible to make a longitudinal axis<br>
of the first electrode piece and a longitudinal axis of the<br>
first shell correspond approximately by the insertion of the<br>
first electrode piece.<br>
The use of a fit between the first electrode piece and the<br>
first shell for position fixing allows the disconnecting switch<br>
device to be assembled quickly. An area which extends<br>
essentially in an annular shape between the first electrode<br>
piece and the first shell can be filled with the second shell.<br>
Fixing the position between the first electrode piece and the<br>
first shell ensures that an adequate volume is available on all<br>
sides for accommodation of the second shell. The longitudinal<br>
axes of the electrode pieces should preferably be axes of<br>
rotation of the electrode pieces. This also applies<br>
approximately to the shells.<br>
One exemplary embodiment of the invention will be explained in<br>
more detail in the following text and is illustrated<br>
schematically in a figure, in which:<br>
 <br>
the figure shows a section through a disconnecting switch<br>
device.<br>
The section shown in the figure passes through a longitudinal<br>
axis 1, with respect to which a disconnecting switch device 2<br>
is essentially rotationally symmetrical.<br>
By way of example, the disconnecting switch device 2 is used<br>
for surge arresters. Surge arresters are used for voltage-<br>
dependent connection and disconnection of a current path which<br>
runs from a conductor, which is live during operation, to a<br>
ground potential. Switching is carried out, for example, by<br>
means of varistors in the surge arresters. Varistors are<br>
semiconductor elements which can fail, for example, when<br>
electrically overloaded. When a surge arrester fails, an<br>
undesirable ground fault can be formed. In order to cope with a<br>
situation such as this, a disconnecting switch device is<br>
additionally inserted in the current path.<br>
The disconnecting switch device 2 shown in the figure has a<br>
first electrode piece 3 and a second electrode piece 4. The two<br>
electrode pieces 3, 4 are rotationally symmetrical and are<br>
arranged opposite one another, coaxially with respect to the<br>
longitudinal axis 1. An annular electrically insulating spacer<br>
5 is arranged on the mutually opposite sides of the electrode<br>
pieces 3, 4, and the electrode pieces 3, 4 rest on this<br>
spacer 5. The spacer 5 surrounds an arc gap which is formed<br>
between the two electrode pieces 3, 4. The first electrode<br>
piece 3 has a projecting plateau 6 in order to guide an arc.<br>
The second electrode piece 4 is electrically conductively<br>
connected to an electrode plate 7. The electrode plate 7 covers<br>
a recess in the second electrode piece 4. A gas generator 8<br>
which can be<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
initiated thermally is arranged in the recess in the second<br>
electrode piece 4. The gas generator 8 is pressed against the<br>
electrode plate 7 by a spring element 9.<br>
Bridging the arc gap, an impedance element 10 makes<br>
electrically conductive contact with the first and the second<br>
electrode pieces 3, 4. The impedance element 10 is, for<br>
example, a pure resistance. The response behavior of the arc<br>
gap can be controlled by means of the impedance element.<br>
In order to allow the disconnecting switch device 2 to be used<br>
in outdoor conditions, it has an electrically insulating<br>
housing 10. The electrically insulating housing 10 is formed<br>
from two shells. The outer surface of the electrically<br>
insulating housing 10 is formed by a first shell 12.<br>
The first shell 12 is essentially in the form of a cup. The<br>
first shell 12 is provided with a recess, into which the first<br>
electrode piece 3 is inserted flush. In order to limit the<br>
introduction of the first electrode piece 3 into the recess,<br>
and to achieve a sealing effect, the first electrode piece 3 is<br>
provided with a circumferential shoulder, which is supported on<br>
the base of the first shell 12.<br>
The recess in the first shell is surrounded by a projecting<br>
attachment 13. When choosing a dimensionally stable insulating<br>
material, the attachment 13 is suitable for protecting a<br>
contact-making area of the first electrode piece 3. In the<br>
present exemplary embodiment, a threaded hole is provided for<br>
making contact. When the threaded hole is screwed onto a<br>
threaded bolt, the attachment 13 can,<br>
 <br>
for example, be pressed against a flat surface, so as to<br>
prevent direct access to the contact-making area of the first<br>
electrode piece 3. With a correspondingly elastic embodiment of<br>
the first shell 12, a sealing effect can be achieved if<br>
required on the flat surface by the attachment 13.<br>
The longitudinal axes can be aligned with respect to one<br>
another by appropriate matching of the dimensions of the recess<br>
in the first shell 12 and of the first electrode piece 3, when<br>
the first electrode piece 3 is inserted into the recess. The<br>
further components which are connected indirectly or directly<br>
to the first electrode piece 3, for example the spacer 5,<br>
impedance element 10, second electrode piece 4, etc., are also<br>
aligned with the alignment of the first electrode piece 3 and<br>
the first shell 12 with respect to one another.<br>
This results in an approximately annular area in the interior<br>
of the first shell 12, into which a second shell 14 can be<br>
introduced. In contrast to the first shell 12, the second shell<br>
14 makes contact both with the first electrode piece 3 and with<br>
the second electrode piece 4.<br>
The second shell 14 is introduced into the annular area in a<br>
liquid or highly viscous state. An electrical insulating<br>
material can be used as the material. One suitable insulating<br>
material is, for example, a polyurethane. The impedance element<br>
10 is embedded within the second shell. The assemblies of the<br>
disconnecting switch device are integrally joined to one<br>
another.<br>
In the contact area of the second electrode piece 4 (in this<br>
case a threaded bolt) , a mirror of the second shell 14 is<br>
accessible. The first shell 12 is separated from the<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
second electrode piece 4 by the mirror. The second shell 14<br>
ends flush with the first shell 12.<br>
When the disconnecting switch device 2 has been assembled, the<br>
first shell 12 extends like a bell over the second shell 14.<br>
During a dissipation process during operation, that is to say-<br>
when the surge arrester with which the disconnecting switch<br>
device 2 is associated has no fault, there is a dissipation<br>
current flow via the electrode pieces 3, 4 and an arc of<br>
relatively low intensity is struck in the arc gap. At the end<br>
of the dissipation process, the arc is quenched by varistors in<br>
the surge arrester.<br>
In the event of a fault in the surge arrester, a current<br>
likewise flows via the current path, which comprises the<br>
electrode pieces 3, 4 and an arc gap. However, an arc burns for<br>
longer and more strongly in the arc gap than in the case of a<br>
dissipation process of a fault-free surge arrester. A large<br>
amount of thermal energy is therefore also released. This<br>
energy initiates the gas generator 8, which suddenly generates<br>
a large amount of gas. The pressure cannot escape directly<br>
because the housing 11 is closed around the arc gap, thus<br>
forcing the electrode pieces 3, 4 apart from one another. The<br>
disconnecting switch device 2 has tripped. In the process, the<br>
arc is quenched.<br>
 <br>
