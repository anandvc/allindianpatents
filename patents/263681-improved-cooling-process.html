The present invention relates to a method and apparatus<br>
for introducing a solution into a cooling apparatus. In<br>
particular, although not exclusively, the present invention<br>
relates to a method arid apparatus for removing heat from a<br>
heat source.<br>
Heat exchangers are often used to remove excess heat<br>
from industrial processes. Typical heat exchangers include<br>
shell and tube-type heat exchangers, which comprise a length<br>
of tubing partially enclosed within a housing or shell. An<br>
industrial process stream containing excess heat is<br>
introduced into the tubing, whilst a coolant, such as water,<br>
is passed through the shell via a separate inlet and outlet.<br>
The water removes excess heat from the process stream.<br>
Thus, the water exiting the shell is at a higher temperature<br>
than the coolant entering the shell. The heated water<br>
stream is cooled in a cooling tower before it is<br>
recirculated back through the shell. In this way, heat<br>
removal can be carried out in a continuous manner.<br>
Most cooling towers contain a porous filler material,<br>
known as decking (packing). Water is introduced into the<br>
top of the cooling tower and drips down through the decking,<br>
whilst air is blown through the decking, causing some of the<br>
water to evaporate. The loss of heat by evaporation<br>
(evaporative cooling) lowers the remaining water<br>
temperature. The cooled water is recirculated to the heat<br>
exchanger.<br><br>
As evaporation occurs, contaminants,such as dissolved<br>
solids, build up in the recirculating water. Such<br>
contaminants can cause fouling, for example, as a result of<br>
biological growth, scale formation, corrosion and/or sludge<br>
deposition. The contaminant level may be reduced by<br>
removing a portion of the recirculating water from the<br>
system. The removal of water in this manner is known as<br>
blowdown.<br>
To replace the total water loss from the system, make-<br>
up water is introduced. The make-up water is treated with,<br>
for example, scale inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors,<br>
biocides and dispersants. These additives tend to be<br>
expensive and have to be added continuously to the make-up-<br>
water, adding to the cost of the overall process.<br>
The water quality of the cooling system has a<br>
significant effect on the thermal efficiency and life of the<br>
cooling tower and heat exchangers.<br>
In an air-cooler, warm air from the surroundings is .<br>
blown through wet decking or packing material. Heat from<br>
the air is transferred to the wet decking material, causing<br>
the water contained in the decking to evaporate. As a<br>
result, air emerging from the cooler is at a lower<br>
temperature than air introduced into the cooler. As the<br>
water evaporates, contaminants in the water may deposit on<br>
the decking material. Such deposits have a detrimental<br>
effect on the thermal efficiency and life of the air-cooler.<br>
JP 09 060320 A describes an apparatus for introducing solution into an<br>
evaporative cooling apparatus using a reverse osmosis membrane device.<br><br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a<br>
process for introducing a solution into an evaporative<br>
cooling apparatus, said process comprising<br>
a)	positioning a selectively permeable membrane between<br>
a first solution and a second solution having a higher<br>
solute concentration than the first solution, such that the<br>
solvent from the first solution flows across, the selectively-<br>
permeable membrane to dilute the second solution,<br>
b)	introducing the second solution into an evaporative<br>
cooling apparatus- in which solvent is removed from the<br>
second solution by evaporation, and<br>
c)	recycling the second solution from step b) to step<br>
a) to draw solvent from the first solution.<br>
Preferably, the evaporative cooling apparatus is a<br>
cooling tower or an air-cooler. Suitable air-coolers<br>
include air-coolers for domestic and industrial use.<br>
The selective nature of the membrane prevents<br>
undesirable solute(s) and other containments in the first<br>
solution from passing into the second solution.<br>
The first solution may be an impure aqueous stream,<br>
such as seawater, brackish water, river water and waste<br>
streams from, for example, an industrial or agricultural<br>
process. When such solutions are used, water is selectively allowed to pass across the membrane to dilute the second<br>
solution.<br>
The second solution may comprise seawater, brackish<br>
water and industrial process streams. Suitable industrial<br>
process streams may be derived from, for example, the salty<br><br>
residues of desalination plants, such as thermal<br>
desalination and/or reverse osmosis plants, and aqueous<br>
effluents, such as those typically employed as-make-up water<br>
for conventional cooling towers. The seawater, brackish<br>
water and industrial process streams employed may be<br>
concentrated prior to use. Alternatively or additionally,<br>
the seawater, brackish water and/or industrial process<br>
streams employed may be concentrated during the course of<br>
the process of the present invention, such that the solution<br>
in contact with the membrane in step a) has a higher solute<br>
(total dissolved salts) concentration than the first<br>
solution. For example, the evaporative cooling apparatus<br>
may be employed to remove solvent from the second solution<br>
by evaporation to produce a concentrated second solution<br>
that can be used to draw solvent from the first solution in<br>
step a). By recycling the second solution between steps a)<br>
and b) in a closed loop, solutes dissolved in the second<br>
solution may be "immobilised". Thus, it may be possible to<br>
recycle industrial process streams containing, for example,<br>
undesirable impurities, such as toxic and radioactive<br>
materials in such a closed loop which isolates the<br>
impurities from the surrounding environment.<br>
When seawater, brackish water and industrial process<br>
streams are used as the second solution, it is desirable to<br>
add additives, such as scale inhibitors, corrosion,<br>
inhibitors, biocides and dispersants to reduce or avoid<br>
fouling and corrosion in the process. These additives may<br>
be "immobilised" in the system when the second solution is<br>
recycled between steps a) and b) in a closed loop. Thus, it<br>
may not be necessary to continuously add such additives to<br>
the second solution.<br><br>
The second solution may have a known composition. For<br>
example, in one embodiment, the second solution is formed by-<br>
introducing a known quantity of a solute into a known<br>
quantity of solvent. Thus, the second solution may consist<br>
essentially of a selected solute dissolved in a selected-<br>
solvent. This second solution may be formed prior to step<br>
a). By forming the second solution in this manner, a<br>
substantially clean solution may be produced. Thus, the<br>
second solution may have a reduced concentration of<br>
suspended particles, biological matter and/or other<br>
components that may cause fouling of the cooling system.<br>
More preferably, the second solution is substantially free<br>
of such components. In one embodiment, additives such as<br>
scale inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors-, biocides and/or<br>
dispersants are included in the second solution. The second<br>
solution may be recirculated in a closed-loop, for example,<br>
such that it is continuously reused in steps a) and b). In<br>
such an embodiment, the components of the second solution<br>
are effectively "immobilised", within the loop. Thus, once<br>
the second solution is formed, further addition of solute<br>
and/or additives such as scale inhibitors, corrosion<br>
inhibitors, biocides and/or dispersants may not be<br>
necessary.<br>
The solvent in the second solution is preferably water.<br>
The solute (osmotic agent) in the second solution is<br>
preferably a water-soluble solute, such as a water-soluble<br>
salt. Suitable salts include salts of ammonium and metals,<br>
such as alkali metals (e.g. Li, Na, K) and alkali earth<br>
metals (e.g. Mg and Ca). The salts may be fluorides,<br><br>
 chlorides, bromides, iodides, sulphates, sulphites,<br>
sulphides,, carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, nitrates,<br>
nitrites, nitrides, phosphates, aluminates, borates,<br>
bromates, carbides, chlorides, perchlorates, hypochlorates,<br>
chromates, fluorosilicates, fluorosilicates,<br>
fluorosulphates, silicates, cyanides and cyanates. One or<br>
more salts may be employed. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
solute of the second solution is a sodium and/or potassium<br>
salt. Thus, the second solution may be formed by dissolving<br>
a known amount of "a sodium and/or potassium salt in water.<br>
In one embodiment, the second solution is formed by<br>
dissolving a sodium chloride in water. In a further<br>
preferred embodiment the second solution may be a solution<br>
of ammonia and carbon dioxide, with resultant aqueous<br>
species: ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate and<br>
ammonium carbamates (see WO 02/0608025). The second<br>
solution initially used in step a) may have a solute or<br>
total dissolved salts (TDS) concentration that is higher<br>
than the solute or TDS concentration of the first solution.<br>
In step a) of the present invention, the first solution<br>
is placed on one side of a semi-permeable membrane. A<br>
second solution having a higher solute concentration (and,<br>
therefore, a lower solvent concentration) is placed on the<br>
opposite side of the membrane. As a result, solvent passes<br>
across the membrane from the side of low solute<br>
concentration (high solvent concentration) to the side of<br>
high solute concentration (low solvent concentration). The<br>
flow occurs along a concentration gradient. Thus, high<br>
pressures are not required to induce solvent flow. However,<br>
a pressure differential across the membrane may be applied,<br>
for example, to increase the flux of water.<br><br>
After solvent (e.g. water) from the first solution has<br>
passed into the second solution, the second solution may be<br>
at an elevated pressure (osmotic pressure when water is used<br>
as a solvent), even when a pressure is not applied to induce<br>
solvent flow from the first solution to the second solution.<br>
This is because the flow of solvent from the first solution<br>
into the second solution occurs along a concentration<br>
gradient. This pressure may be used to aid the transfer of<br>
the second solution to subsequent processing steps of the<br>
present invention. This pressure may be sufficient to<br>
transfer the second solution to subsequent processing steps,<br>
for example, without the aid of pumps. In one embodiment,<br>
excess pressure is converted into mechanical work. Thus,<br>
the pressure (e.g. osmotic pressure) generated in the second<br>
solution may be used to reduce the power consumption and/or<br>
increase the heat transfer efficiency of the overall<br>
process.<br>
In one embodiment, the diluted second solution from<br>
step a) may be contacted with one side of a further<br>
selectively permeable membrane, whilst a third solution<br>
having a higher solute concentration than the diluted second<br>
solution is contacted with the other side of the membrane.<br>
As the second solution has a higher solvent concentration<br>
than the third solution, solvent from the second solution<br>
flows across the membrane to dilute the third solution.<br>
Like the second solution, the third solution may consist<br>
essentially of a selected solute dissolved in a selected<br>
solvent. Thus,by repeating steps (a) one or more times,<br>
the composition of the solution introduced into the cooling<br>
tower may be better controlled.<br><br>
The third and/or subsequent solution may be formed of<br>
any of the solutions described above in relation to the<br>
second solution. Thus, the solvent in the third and/or<br>
subsequent solution is preferably water.<br>
The solute (osmotic agent) in the third and/or<br>
■subsequent solution is preferably a water-soluble solute,<br>
such as a water-soluble salt. Suitable salts include salts<br>
of ammonium and metals, such as alkali metals (e.g. Li, Na,<br>
K) and alkali earth metals (e.g. Mg and Ca) . The salts may<br>
be fluorides, chlorides, bromides, iodides, sulphates,<br>
sulphites, sulphides, carbonates, hydrogencarbonates,<br>
nitrates, nitrites, nitrides, phosphates, aluminates,<br>
borates, bromates, carbides, chlorides, perchlorates,<br>
hypochlorates, chromates, fluorosilicates, fluorosilicates,<br>
fluorosulphates, silicates, cyanides and cyanates. One or<br>
more salts may be employed. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
solute of the third and/or subsequent solution is a sodium<br>
and/or potassium salt. Thus,, the third and/or subsequent<br>
solution may be formed by dissolving a known amount of a<br>
sodium and/or potassium salt in water. In one embodiment,<br>
the third and/or subsequent solution is formed by dissolving<br>
a sodium chloride in water. In another embodiment the<br>
third/ and or subsequent solution may.be a solution of<br>
ammonia and carbon dioxide, with resultant aqueous species:<br>
ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium<br>
carbamates (see WO 02/060825).<br>
The third and/or subsequent solution may be contain the<br>
same solute(s) and solvent(s) as the second solution.- It<br><br>
may also be possible to use different solutions as the<br>
second, third and/or subsequent solutions.<br>
■ In one embodiment, additives such as scale inhibitors,<br>
corrosion inhibitors, biocides and/or dispersants are<br>
included in the third and/or subsequent solution. As will<br>
be described in further detail below, the third and/or<br>
subsequent solution may be recirculated in a closed-loop,<br>
for example, such that it is continuously reused in steps a)<br>
and b). In such ah embodiment, the components of the third -<br>
and/or subsequent solution are effectively "immobilised"<br>
within the loop. Thus, once the third and/or subsequent<br>
solution is formed, further addition of solute and/or<br>
additives such as scale inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors,<br>
biocides and/or dispersants may not be necessary.<br>
In step b), the second solution is introduced into an .<br>
evaporative cooling apparatus. The cooling apparatus<br>
preferably comprises supporting material from which solvent<br>
(e.g. water) can evaporate. The supporting material is<br>
preferably porous and may advantageously have a large<br>
surface area. The supporting material may be made from<br>
plastic, metal, ceramic and natural materials, such as wood.<br>
In use,, the second solution is contacted with the<br>
supporting material. A gas, such as.air, may then be. passed<br>
through the wet supporting material causing the solvent of<br>
the second solution to evaporate. Depending on the relative<br>
temperatures of the solution and the gas, the temperature of<br>
either the solution or the gas is reduced as a result of the<br>
evaporative cooling. The cooled solution or gas may be used<br><br>
as a coolant, for example, to remove heat from a heat source<br>
or to cool the surrounding atmosphere.<br>
Solution emerging from step b) is recycled in step a) •.<br>
The second solution from step b) may be directly recycled to<br>
step a) to draw the solvent from the first solution.<br>
Alternatively, the second solution may be recycled to step<br>
a) after one or more intermediate steps. For example, the<br>
second solution from step b) may be used to remove heat from<br>
a heat source prior to being recycled to step a). In one<br>
embodiment, the second solution is used as a coolant in a<br>
heat exchanger prior to being recycled to step a). It may<br>
be possible to recirculate the second solution, for example,<br>
in a closed loop. Optionally, additional components, such<br>
as solvents, solutes and additives selected from, for<br>
example, scale inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, biocides<br>
and/or dispersants may be added to the closed loop.<br>
Examples of suitable evaporative cooling apparatuses<br>
include cooling towers and air-coolers, such as air-coolers<br>
for domestic and industrial use.<br>
Air-coolers typically comprise a housing containing a<br>
porous filler material (e.g. decking or packing). The<br>
second solution is introduced into the air-cooler and wets<br>
the filler material. When warm air from the surroundings is<br>
blown through the filler material, some of the solvent (e.g.<br>
water) of the second solution evaporates. The loss of heat<br>
by evaporation (evaporative cooling) lowers the temperature<br>
of the air. Thus, the temperature of the air emerging from •<br>
the air-cooler is lower than that of the air introduced into<br>
the air-cooler. The air emerging from the air cooler may be<br><br>
used as a coolant for, for example, a heat exchanger.<br>
Alternatively, the emerging air may be used to cool an<br>
enclosed space, such as a room.<br>
Cooling towers typically contain a porous filler<br>
material, known as decking (packing). The second solution<br>
is introduced into the top of the cooling tower and drips<br>
down through the decking, whilst a coolant, such as air, is<br>
blown through the decking, causing some of the solvent of<br>
the second solution-'to evaporate. The loss of heat by<br>
evaporation (evaporative cooling) lowers the temperature of<br>
the remaining second solution.<br>
As evaporation occurs, the concentration of the second<br>
solution increases. If contaminants are present in the<br>
second solution, they may be at least partially removed by<br>
removing a portion of the second solution entering the<br>
cooling tower (e.g. as a bleed). This removal is known as<br>
blowdown.<br>
Any suitable cooling tower may be employed in the<br>
process of the present invention. Examples of suitable"<br>
cooling towers include natural draft and mechanical draft<br>
cooling towers.<br>
After step a), the second solution may be used to<br>
remove excess heat from a heat source (step d). Thus,<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the present invention provides a method for<br>
removing heat from a heat source. Step d) may be carried<br>
out before and/or after the second solution is introduced<br>
into the evaporative cooling apparatus in step b) provided<br><br>
that the second solution used in step (d) is at a lower<br>
temperature than the heat source. •In one embodiment, step<br>
d) is carried out before and/or after the second-solution is<br>
cooled in a cooling tower in step b).<br>
In one embodiment, the second solution is used as a<br>
coolant in a heat exchanger to remove heat from an<br>
industrial process stream, such as steam from a power plant.<br>
For example, the heat exchanger may be a shell-and-tube-type<br>
heat exchanger, which comprises a length of tubing partially<br>
enclosed within a housing or shell. The industrial process<br>
stream is introduced into the tubing, whilst the second<br>
solution is passed through the shell via a separate inlet<br>
and outlet. The second solution removes excess heat from<br>
the process stream. Thus., the second solution exiting the .<br>
shell is at a higher temperature than the second solution<br>
entering the shell.<br>
Once the second solution has been heated in the heat<br>
removal step (d), it may be reused in step a). However, if<br>
the second solution is reused in step a), the overall<br>
concentration of solute in the second solution in contact<br>
with the selectively permeable membrane should be higher<br>
than the concentration of solute in the first solution, so<br>
that solvent from the first solution will pass across the<br>
selectively permeable membrane into the second solution. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, therefore, the removal of solvent<br>
from the second■solution is controlled to ensure that the<br>
second solution in contact with the selectively permeable<br>
membrane has a desired concentration. In one embodiment,<br>
.the second solution may be cooled prior to reuse in step a)<br>
(e.g. in a cooling tower).<br><br>
In step c), the solution used in steps a) , b) and,<br>
optionally, d) may be recirculated in a closed loop.<br>
Optionally, additional components, such as solvents, solutes<br>
and additives selected from, for example, scale inhibitors,<br>
corrosion inhibitors, biocides and/or dispersants may be<br>
added to the closed loop.<br>
Any suitable selectively membrane may be used in the<br>
process of the present invention. An array of membranes may<br>
be employed. Suitable membranes include cellulose acetate<br>
(CA) and cellulose triacetate (CTA) (such as those described<br>
in McCutcheon et al., Desalination 174 (2005) 1-11) and<br>
polyamide (PA) membranes. The membrane may be planar or<br>
take the form of a tube or hollow fibre. Thin membranes may<br>
be employed, particularly, when a high pressure is not<br>
applied to induce solvent flow from the first solution to<br>
the second solution. If desired, the membrane may be<br>
supported on a supporting structure, such as a mesh support.<br>
In one embodiment, one or more tubular membranes may be<br>
disposed within a housing or shell. The first solution may<br>
be introduced into the housing, whilst the second solution<br>
may be introduced into the tubes. As the solvent<br>
concentration of the first solution is higher than that of<br>
the second, solvent will diffuse across the membrane from<br>
the first solution into the second solution. Thus, the<br>
second solution will become increasingly diluted and the<br>
first solution, increasingly concentrated. The diluted<br>
second solution may be recovered from the interior of the<br>
tubes, whilst, the concentrated first solution may be removed<br>
from the housing.<br><br>
When a planar membrane is employed, the sheet may be<br>
rolled such that it defines a spiral in cross-section.<br>
The pore size of the membrane may be selected depending<br>
on the size of the solvent molecules that require<br>
separation. It may be possible to use a membrane having a<br>
pore size that allows two or more different types of solvent<br>
molecules to pass through the'membrane. Preferably, the<br>
pore size of the membrane-is selective to the passage of<br>
water. The pore size of the membrane is preferably selected<br>
to prevent the flow of solute and other contaminants from<br>
the first solution to the second solution. Typical pore<br>
sizes range from 1 to 100 Angstroms, preferably 5 to 50<br>
Angstroms, for example 10 to 40 Angstroms.<br>
The flow of solvent across a selectively membrane is<br>
generally influenced by thermal conditions. Thus, the<br>
solutions on either side of the•membrane may be heated or<br>
cooled, if desired. The solutions may be heated to higher<br>
temperatures of 40 to 90°C, for example, 60 to 80°C.<br>
Alternatively, the solutions may be cooled to -20 to 40°C,<br>
for example, 5 to 2 0°C. .The solution on one side of the<br>
membrane may be heated, while the other side cooled. The<br>
heating or cooling may be carried out on each solution<br>
independently. Chemical reactions may also be carried out<br>
on either side of the membrane, if desired.<br>
To improve the efficacy of the osmosis step, the first<br>
and/or second solution may be treated to reduce fouling and<br>
scaling of the membrane. Accordingly, anti-scaling and/or<br>
anti-fouling agents may be added to one or both solutions.<br><br>
Although not required, pressure may be applied to the first<br>
solution side of the membrane to increase the rate of flux<br>
of water across the membrane. For example, pressures of l'x<br>
10s Pa to 5 x 10s Pa [1 to 5 bar] may be applied, preferably<br>
pressures of.2 x 105 Pa to 4 x 105 Pa [2 to 4 bar].<br>
Additionally or alternatively, the pressure on the second<br>
solution side of the membrane may be reduced. For example<br>
the pressure may be less than 1 x 105 Pa [1 bar] , preferably<br>
less than 0.5 x 10s Pa [0.5 bar].<br>
The viscosities of the first solution and/or the second<br>
solution may also be modified to improve the rate of flux<br>
across the membrane. For example, viscosity modifying<br>
agents may be employed.<br>
The process of the present invention may further<br>
comprise a pre-treatment step of removing contaminants, such<br>
as suspended particles and biological matter, from the first<br>
solution. Additionally or alternatively, a threshold<br>
inhibitor to control scaling may be added to the first<br>
solution. Pre-treatment steps to alter the pH of the first<br>
solution may also be employed. When seawater is used 'as a<br>
feed, it is preferable to use a deep sea intake, as deep<br>
seawater typically contains fewer contaminants.<br>
According, to a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention, there is provided an apparatus for introducing a<br>
solution into an evaporative cooling apparatus, said<br>
apparatus comprising<br>
a housing comprising a selectively permeable membrane<br>
for separating a first solution from a second solution<br>
having a higher solute concentration than the first<br><br>
solution, said membrane being configured to selectively<br>
allow solvent to pass from the first solution-side of the<br>
membrane to the second solution-side of the membrane,<br>
an evaporative cooling apparatus, and<br>
means for removing.second solution from the housing,<br>
and<br>
means for introducing the second solution into the<br>
evaporative cooling apparatus.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention may further<br>
comprise a heat exchanger.<br>
These and other aspects of the present invention will<br>
now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings<br>
in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of an apparatus<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention,<br>
and<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of an apparatus<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of an apparatus<br>
according to a third embodiment of the present invention,<br>
and<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic diagram of an apparatus<br>
according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, there is provided an apparatus<br>
10 for producing a cool stream of air.<br><br>
The apparatus 10 comprises a housing 12 and an air<br>
cooler 14. The housing 12 comprises a selectively- permeable<br>
membrane 16 for separating seawater 18 from a solution 20<br>
formed by dissolving a known amount of sodium chloride in<br>
water.<br>
In use, "seawater 18 is circulated through the housing<br>
12 on one side of the membrane 16, whilst sodium chloride<br>
solution 2 0 is circulated through the housing 12 on the<br>
opposite side of the membrane 16. The sodium chloride<br>
solution 2 0 in contact with the membrane 16 has a higher<br>
total dissolved salt (solute) concentration than the<br>
seawater 18. Thus, water flows from the seawater-side of<br>
the membrane 16 to the solution-side of the membrane 16 by<br>
osmosis.<br>
The flow of water across the membrane 16 dilutes the<br>
sodium chloride solution 20. The diluted solution 20' is<br>
removed from the. housing 12 and is introduced into the air<br>
cooler 14. The air cooler 14 contains a porous filler<br>
material (not shown). The solution 20 is introduced into<br>
■the top of the air cooler 14 and wets the porous material.<br>
When.warm air 22 from the surroundings is blown through<br>
the wet porous material, heat from the air 22 is transferred<br>
to the wet porous material, causing water in the solution 20<br>
to evaporate. As a result, the air 24 emerging from the<br>
cooler 14 is at a lower temperature than the air 22<br>
introduced into the cooler 14'. The emerging air 24 may be<br>
used to cool an enclosed space, such as a .room.<br><br>
As water evaporates from the solution 20,.. .the solution<br>
2 0 becomes more concentrated. This concentrated solution 2 0<br>
is removed from-the air cooler 14 via line 26 and--<br>
recirculated to the solution-side of the membrane 16 in'<br>
housing 12 in a closed loop. The concentration of the<br>
solution 2 0 in contact with the membrane 16 is higher than<br>
that of the seawater 18 on the other side of the membrane<br>
16.<br>
The apparatus of- Figure 2 is similar to the apparatus<br>
of Figure 1. Thus, like numerals have been used to<br>
designate like parts. Unlike the apparatus of Figure 1,<br>
however, the apparatus of Figure 2 comprises two housings<br>
12a and 12b are used in series.<br>
The first housing 12a comprises a selectively permeable<br>
membrane 16a for separating seawater 18 from a solution 20a<br>
formed by dissolving a known amount of sodium chloride in<br>
water. The second housing 12b comprises a selectively<br>
permeable membrane 16b for separating solution 2 0a from the<br>
first housing 12a from a solution 20b formed by dissolving a<br>
known amount of sodium chloride in water.<br>
In use, seawater 18 is circulated through the housing<br>
12a on one side of the membrane 16a, -whilst sodium chloride<br>
solution 20a is circulated through the housing 12a on the<br>
opposite side of the membrane 16a. The sodium chloride<br>
solution 20a in contact with .the membrane 16 has a higher<br>
total dissolved salt (solute) concentration than the<br>
seawater 18. . Thus, water flows from the seawater-side of<br>
the membrane 16 to the solution-side of the membrane 16 by<br>
osmosis.<br><br>
The flow of water across the membrane 16a dilutes the<br>
sodium chloride solution 20a. The diluted solution 20a is<br>
circulated through the housing 12b on one side of the<br>
membrane 16b, whilst sodium chloride solution 2 0b is<br>
circulated through the housing 12b on the opposite side of<br>
the membrane 16b. • The sodium chloride solution 20b in<br>
contact with the membrane 16b has a higher total dissolved<br>
salt (solute) concentration than the solution 2 0a. Thus,<br>
water flows across the membrane 16b by osmosis to dilute the<br>
sodium chloride solution 20b. The diluted solution 2.0b is<br>
introduced into an air cooler 14 in the manner described<br>
with reference to Figure 1. As water flows across the<br>
membrane by osmosis, the sodium chloride solution 20a<br>
becomes increasingly concentrated and this is recirculated<br>
to housing 12a.<br>
In Figure 3, there is provided an apparatus 100 for<br>
removing heat from an industrial process stream.<br>
The apparatus 100 comprises a housing 110, a heat<br>
exchanger 112 and a cooling tower 114. The housing 110<br>
comprises a selectively permeable membrane 116 for<br>
separating seawater 118 from a solution 120 formed by<br>
dissolving a known amount of sodium chloride in water.<br>
In use, seawater 118 is circulated through the housing<br>
110 on one side of the membrane 116, whilst sodium chloride<br>
solution 120 is circulated through the housing 110 on the<br>
opposite side of the membrane 116. The sodium chloride<br>
solution 120 in contact with the membrane 116 has a higher<br>
total dissolved salt (solute) concentration than the<br><br>
seawater 118 . Thus, water flows from the seawater-side of<br>
the membrane 116 to the solution-side of the membrane 116 by-<br>
osmosis .<br>
The flow of water across the membrane 116 dilutes the<br>
sodium chloride solution 120. This diluted solution 120 is<br>
introduced into the cooling tower 114. The cooling-tower<br>
114 contains a porous filler material, known as decking (not<br>
shown). The solution 12 0 is introduced into the top of the<br>
cooling tower 114 and-drips down through the decking, whilst<br>
cool air 126 is blown through the decking, causing some of<br>
the water from the solution 120 to evaporate. The loss of<br>
heat by evaporation (evaporative cooling) lowers the<br>
temperature of the remaining solution 120. The remaining<br>
solution, however, is more concentrated than the solution<br>
entering the cooling tower 114 because of the loss of water<br>
by evaporation.<br>
The cooled solution 120 is.introduced into the heat<br>
': exchanger 112. In the heat exchanger 112, the solution 120<br>
used as a coolant to remove heat from an industrial process<br>
stream 124. Heat from the stream 124 is transferred to the<br>
solution 120 through the walls of the heat exchanger 112.<br>
Thus, the temperature of solution 120 is increased.-<br>
The solution 12 0 is withdrawn from the.heat exchanger<br>
124 via line 128 and reintroduced to the solution-side of<br>
the membrane 116 in a closed loop. The concentration of the<br>
solution 12 0 in contact with the membrane 116 is higher than<br>
that of the seawater 118 on the other side of the membrane<br>
116.<br><br>
The apparatus of Figure 4 is similar to the.apparatus<br>
of Figure 3. Thus, like numerals have been used to<br>
designate like parts. Unlike the apparatus of Figure 3,<br>
solution 120 from the housing 110 is introduced into the<br>
heat exchanger 112 before it is introduced into the cooling<br>
tower 114.<br><br>
