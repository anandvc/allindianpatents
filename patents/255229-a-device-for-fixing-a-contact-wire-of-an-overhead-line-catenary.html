Description<br>
Device for fixing a contact wire of an overhead line catenary<br>
The invention relates to a device for fixing a contact wire of<br>
an overhead line catenary, at least one pair of rollers<br>
consisting of a first and of a second roller being present on a<br>
basic body and being arranged with parallel-disposed roller<br>
axes on opposite sides of the intended position of the contact<br>
wire, in order to receive the contact wire between the running<br>
surfaces of the two rollers, and the second roller being<br>
displaceable toward the intended position of the contact wire<br>
by an adjusting means and being fixable.<br>
A contact wire fixing device of this type is known from EP 1<br>
026 026 Al. In this case, two first rollers are provided,<br>
counter to which a middle displaceable second roller acts. With<br>
the contact wire inserted, this is smoothed by the acting force<br>
of the second roller displaced toward the contact wire and by<br>
the counterforce of the first rollers. The second roller is<br>
moved toward the contact wire by means of a spindle.<br>
By a contact wire being fixed, it is smoothed on two opposite<br>
sides.<br>
It became apparent that the known appliance can tilt at an<br>
angle to the side during the fixing or smoothing of the contact<br>
wire. The result of this is that the surface to be touched by<br>
the pantograph is at least temporarily not smoothed. Moreover,<br>
the quality of smoothing, in particular for high-speed traffic,<br>
is not good enough.<br>
The object on which the invention is based, therefore, is to<br>
specify a device for fixing a contact wire, in which a<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057037	- 2 -<br>
2004P21389WOIN<br>
tilting of the roller axes during the smoothing operation is<br>
ruled out.<br>
Moreover, the object on which the invention is based is,<br>
particularly in the case of high-speed traffic, to eliminate<br>
disturbing relatively low waves in the contact wire, which has<br>
not yet been possible with the technique known hitherto.<br>
Both objects are achieved, according to the invention, by means<br>
of the feature combination of claim 1. In this case, a gripping<br>
means is arranged on the basic body, the grippers of which<br>
gripping means are positioned opposite one another so as to<br>
engage on both sides into two longitudinal grooves of the<br>
contact wire.<br>
To be precise, a conventional contact wire, which is designated<br>
as a grooved contact wire, has two mutually opposite grooves<br>
which run in the longitudinal direction and which are necessary<br>
for fastening the contact wire in the overhead line catenary.<br>
The inventive step is to be seen in that these grooves are used<br>
to ensure that the roller axes always assume a horizontal<br>
position and therefore the rollers always run along the contact<br>
wire at the top and bottom.<br>
The device as claimed in claim 1 of the invention achieves the<br>
advantage that the downwardly directed surface of the contact<br>
wire, against which the pantograph of a rail vehicle would come<br>
to bear, is always smoothed reliably.<br>
The particular advantage achieved is that the contact wire can<br>
be smoothed to a very great extent because the device cannot<br>
vary its position during the smoothing operation. Even very<br>
small waves are eliminated and therefore can no longer promote<br>
spark formation.<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057037	- 2a -<br>
2004P21389WOIN<br>
The second object is also achieved by means of the feature<br>
combination of claim 2. It is important, in this case, that, in<br>
the case of two pairs of rollers which are present, in the<br>
formula mentioned Kn is between 29 and 33 for a first pair of<br>
rollers and<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057037	-3 -<br>
2004P21389WOIN<br>
is between 21 and 25 for a second pair of rollers following in<br>
the intended direction of movement.<br>
If, for example, a third pair of rollers following the second<br>
is present, Kn is between 14 and 17 for this.<br>
The selection of the values for Kn achieves the advantage that<br>
the contact wire can be smoothed particularly effectively for<br>
high-speed traffic. Even very small waves are eliminated.<br>
For example, on the device as claimed in claim 2, which<br>
achieves the second object, a gripping means is arranged on the<br>
basic body, the grippers of which gripping means are positioned<br>
opposite one another so as to engage on both sides into two<br>
longitudinal grooves of the contact wire.<br>
This affords a combination of the devices as claimed in claims<br>
1 and 2 which has all the advantages of both devices.<br>
Advantageous developments of the devices as claimed in claims 1<br>
and 2 may be gathered from the subclaims.<br>
For example, the grippers have guide rollers which engage with<br>
an exact fit into the longitudinal grooves. Jamming is thereby<br>
prevented.<br>
For example, the diameters of the rollers are selected as a<br>
function of the diameter and/or of the strength of the contact<br>
wire. This ensures a particularly reliable smoothing operation.<br>
For example, the pressure forces of the rollers on the contact<br>
wire are selected as a function of the diameter and/or of the<br>
strength of the contact wire. This, too, ensures an improved<br>
smoothing.<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057037	- 4 -<br>
2004P21389WOIN<br>
A combination of these two functions is expediently possible.<br>
For example, two or more first and/or second rollers are<br>
arranged in each case one behind the other, and the spacings<br>
between rollers arranged one behind the other are selected as a<br>
function of the diameter and/or of the strength of the contact<br>
wire.<br>
Simply by a plurality of pairs of rollers being arranged, an<br>
improved smoothing of the contact wire becomes possible. In<br>
particular, however, taking into account a special spacing of<br>
the rollers arranged one behind the other, which is dependent<br>
on the diameter of the contact wire, even better smoothing is<br>
advantageously achieved.<br>
According to a further example, at least one third and at least<br>
one fourth roller are arranged with parallel-disposed axes on<br>
opposite sides of the intended position of the contact wire, in<br>
order to receive the contact wire between the running surfaces<br>
of the two rollers, at least one fourth roller being<br>
displaceable toward the intended position of the contact wire<br>
by a further adjusting means and being fixable. The axes of the<br>
first and second rollers, on the one hand, and of the third and<br>
fourth rollers, on the other hand, are in this case<br>
perpendicular to one another.<br>
This achieves the advantage that even a lateral smoothing of<br>
the contact wire becomes possible, thus assisting the smoothing<br>
of the lower surface.<br>
The contact wire to be fixed consists, for example, of a<br>
copper/magnesium alloy or of a copper/tin alloy or of even<br>
harder materials. The formula mentioned is particularly<br>
suitable for such a hard or strong contact wire.<br><br>

2004P21389WOIN<br>
By means of the device for fixing a contact wire according to<br>
the invention, in particular, the advantage is achieved that<br>
that surface of the contact wire which will be touched by the<br>
pantograph is always smoothed reliably. Moreover, even small<br>
waves in the contact wire can be eliminated reliably, so that<br>
they can no longer promote spark formation on the pantograph.<br><br>
