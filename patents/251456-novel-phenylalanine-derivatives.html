also the diseases in which α 4 integrins have the potential to participates in the pathology.<br>
The present invention also relates to the methods for producing the above novel phenylalanine derivatives and the synthesis intermediates thereof.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
In the inflammatory reactions, it is generally understood that when a microorganism invades a tissue or when the tissue is injured, leukocytes play an important role for the exclusion of the microorganism or for the repair of the injured tissue. It is also widely understood that in such cases, leukocytes usually circulating in the blood must pass through the vascular wall and be newly supplied to the injured tissue. It has been elucidated that the infiltration of the leukocytes from the blood vessel into the tissue is carried out by integrin molecules which are a group of heterodimeric proteins expressing on the leukocytes. The integrin molecules are classified into at least 8 subfamilies (β 1 through β 8 subfamilies) depending on the β chains thereof. Known typical subfamilies are β 1 and β 3 subfamilies involved in the adhesion of cell ingredients to the extracellular matrix such as collagen and fibronectin;β 2 subfamily involved in cell-to-cell adhesion in the immune system; and β 7 subfamily which mainly participates in the infiltration of leukocytes into rnucosal tissues (Nonpatent Literature l). As for the above-described α 4integrins, two kinds of molecules thereof are known. They are VLA-4 (very late antigen-4) molecule belonging to the 13 1 subfamily and comprisingα 4IS 1 chain and LPAM-1 (lymphocyte Peyer's patch HEV adhesion molecule-1) molecule belonging to the fi 7 subfamily and comprising or 413 7 chain. Usually most of leukocytes circulating in the blood have only a low adhesion affinity for the vascular endothelium cells and they cannot move out of the blood vessel. However, lymphocytes mainly comprising T cells and B cells are capable of<br><br>
moving out of  the blood vessel by a so-called lymphocyte homing phenomenon wherein they move from the blood into the lymphoid tissue through the blood vessel wall and then they return into the blood through the lymphatic vessel under the physiological conditions.  It is known that LPAM-1 molecules participate in the lymphocyte homing into the lymphoid tissue of an intestinal tract such as Peyer's patch (Nonpatent Literature 2). On the other hand, when an inflammation occurs, the vascular-endothelium cells are activated by cytokine and chemokine released from the inflamed tissue, the expression of  a group of cell surface antigens (adhesion molecules)  participating  in the  adhesion  of  leukocytes  to  the vascular-endothelium cells is caused, and a lot of leukocytes infiltrate out of the blood vessel toward the inflamed tissue through the adhesion molecules. As the cell surface antigens on the vascular-endothelium cells participating in the adhesion of the leukocytes, there have been known E-selectin (adhesion molecule mainly  participating  in the adhesion of neutrophils), ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mainly participating in the adhesion of lymphocytes, and  MAdCAM-1 mainly participating in the  adhesion of lymphocytes in the lymphoid tissue of an intestinal tract such as Peyer's patch (Nonpatent Literature  l).  It was reported that in those adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 acts as a ligand of both VLA-4 and LPAM-1 and that MAdCAM-1 acts as the ligand of LPAM-1. As a ligand of both VLA-4 and LPAM-1, fibronectin which is a kind of extracellular matrix is also known (Nonpatent Literature  l).  The  fi 1 integrin subfamily to which VLA-4 belongs comprises at least 6 integrins (VLA-1 to VLA-6) using extracellular matrixes such as fibronectin, collagen and laminin as the ligands. Many of integrins using extracellular matrixes as the ligands, such as VLA-5,β 3 subfamily and β5 subfamily, recognize arginine - glycine - aspartic acid (RGD) sequence in fibronectin, vitronectin, tenascin and osteopontin.  On the other hand, in  the interaction  of VLA-4 and fibronectin, the RGD sequence  does not participate  but a  CS-1 peptide  segment comprising<br><br>
leucine - aspartic acid - valine (LDV) as the core sequence participates (Nonpatent Literature 3). Clements et al. found a sequence similar to LDV in amino acid sequences of VCAM-1 and MAdCAM-1. It has been elucidated that a variant obtained by partially modifying the CS-1-like sequence of VCAM-1 and MAdCAM-1 molecules cannot interact to VLA-4 or LPAM-1 (Nonpatent Literatures 4 to 7). Thus, it was found that the CS-1-like sequence is important for the interaction of VLA-4/LPAM-1 and VCAM-l/MAdCAM-1.<br>
It was also reported that the cyclic pep tide having the CS-1-like structure is antagonistic both to the interaction of VLA-4 or LPAM-1 with VCAM-1, MAdCAM-1 or CS-1 peptide (Nonpatent Literature 8). The above-described facts indicate that all the interactions of or 4 integrin and VCAM-1, MAdCAM-1 or fibronectin can be blocked by using a suitableα 4integrin antagonist (the term ua4 integrin antagonist" in the specification indicates a substance antagonistic to α 4 β 1 and/or α 4 β 7 integrin).<br>
It is also known that the expression of VCAM-1 in vascularendothelium cells is caused by inflammatory factors such as LPS, TNF-α or IL-1 and that when the inflammation occurs, the infiltration of the leukocytes from the blood vessel into the tissue is carried out by the VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion mechanism (Nonpatent Literatures 9 to 11). Because VLA-4 is expressed on the surfaces of activated lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, mast cells and neutrophils, the adhesion mechanism of VLA-4/VCAM-1 plays an important role for the infiltration of those cells into the inflamed tissue. It was reported that VLA-4 is expressed on various sarcoma cells such as melanoma cells, and it was also elucidated that the adhesion mechanism of VLA-4/VCAM-1 participates in the metastasis of these tumors. By investigating the expression of VCAM-1 in various pathological tissues, it was made apparent that the adhesion mechanism of this VLA-4/VCAM-1 participates in various pathological stages.  Namely, it was reported that  in addition to the activated<br><br>
vascular-endothelium cells, the expression of VCAM-1 is increased in the inflamed tissues in the patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid synovial membrane (Nonpatent Literatures 12 and 13), lungs and respiratory tract epithelium in asthma (Nonpatent Literature 14) and allergic diseases (Nonpatent Literature 15), systemic lupus erythematosus (Nonpatent Literature 16), Sjogren's syndrome (Nonpatent Literature 17); multiple sclerosis (Nonpatent Literature 18) and psoriasis (Nonpatent Literature 19); atherosclerotic plagues (Nonpatent Literature 20), intestinal tissues of the patients with inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Nonpatent Literatures 21 and 22), inflamed tissue of Langerhans islet of patients with diabetes (Nonpatent Literature 23) and implants during the rejection of transplantation of heart or kidney (Nonpatent Literatures 24 and 25). The adhesion mechanism of VLA-4/VCAM-1 participates in these various diseases.<br>
There are many reports showing that in vivo administration of VLA-4 or VCAM-1 antibody was effective in improving the diseases of animal models with those inflammatory diseases.  Concretely, Yednock et al. and Baron et al. reported that the in vivo administration of an antibody againstα 4integrins was effective in controlling the incidence rate or in controlling encephalomyelitis in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, i. e. multiple sclerosis models (Nonpatent Literatures 26 and 27). Zeidler et al. reported that in vivo administration of an antibody against α 4-integrin was effective in controlling the incidence rate of mouse collagen arthritis (rheumatoid models) (Nonpatent Literature 28).  The therapeutic effect of an antibody against α 4-integrin in asthma models was reported by Abraham et al. and Sagara et al. (Nonpatent Literatures 29 and 30). The effect of an antibody against  α 4-integrin in inflammatory bowel disease models was reported by Podolsky et al. (Nonpatent Literature 3l). The effect of an antibody against α 4-integrin and that against VCAM antibody in insulin-dependent diabetes models  were reported  by  Baron et al.<br><br>
(Nonpatent Literature 32). It was made apparent with baboon models that the restenosis of a blood vessel after an angioplasty carried out because of arteriosclerosis can be inhibited by the administration ofα 4integrin antibody (Nonpatent Literature 33). It was also reported that α 4 integrin or VCAM antibody is effective in inhibiting the rejection of an implant or inhibiting metastasis of a cancer (Nonpatent Literatures 34 and 35). The therapeutic effect of an antibody against VCAM-1 in inflammatory bowel disease models was reported by Sans et al. (Nonpatent Literature 44).<br>
As described above, unlike VCAM-1, MAdCAM-1 which is a ligand of LPAM-1 is constitutively expressed on high endothelial venules (HEV) in the intestinal mucosa, mesenteric lymphatic nodes, Peyer's patch and spleen and it participates in the homing of mucosal lymphocytes. It is also known that LPAM-l/MAdCAM-1 adhesion mechanism not only has physiological roles in the homing of the lymphocytes but also participates in some pathological processes. Briskin et al reported an increase in the expression of MAdCAM-1 in inflamed regions in intestinal tracts of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Nonpatent Literature 36). Hanninen et al. reported that induction of the expression is observed in an inflamed tissue of Langerhans islet of NOD mouse which is a model of an insulin-dependent diabetes (Nonpatent Literature 37). The fact that LPAM-l/MAdCAM-1 adhesion mechanism participates in the progress of diseases is apparent from the fact that conditions of mouse models with inflammatory bowel disease (Nonpatent Literature 38) and the above-described NOD mouse models are improved by the in vivo administration of antibody to MAdCAM or antibody to fi 7 integrin (Nonpatent Literatures 39 and 40).<br>
The above-described facts indicate the possibility in that employing the blocking of VLA-4/VCAM-1, LPAM-l/VCAM-1 or LPAM-1/MAdCAM-l adhesion mechanism by a suitable antagonist is effective in treating the chronic inflammatory diseases described above.  Regarding the therapeutic<br><br>
effects of the suitable antagonist(s), they can be ensured by the animal models described in the above literatures or the other literatures such as Nonpatent Literature 45 and 46. The use of the antibody against VLA-4 as the VLA-4 antagonist is described in Patent Literatures 1 to 4. Peptide compounds as VLA-4 antagonists are described in Patent Literatures 5 to 8.<br><br>
orally administered is described in Patent Literatures 14 and 15.<br>

A suitably protected carboxylic acid (S*l) is loaded into a resin by a usual method. The substituent Q of the carboxylic acid (S*l) has a structure of 2-Y11-6-Y12-Ph-CO as described above with reference to the formula (l), it is a substituent which can be converted into 2-Y116-Y12-Ph-CO in any stage of the sY11thesis or it is a protective group of an amino group. The substituent R of the carboxylic acid (S'l) has a structure of a substituent which can be converted into NH2 or suitably<br><br>
protected form of group of NH2.<br>
As for the loading reaction conditions, the reaction can be conducted by using, if necessary, a suitable additive such as HOAt (l-hydroxyy-7-azabenzotriazole), HOBt (l-hydroxybenzotriazole) or DMAP (dimethylaminopyridine) and a condensing agent such as DIC (diisopropylcarbodiimide), DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) or EDC (l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) in an organic solvent such as dichlorom ethane, DMF (N,N-dimethylforinamide) or NMP (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone). For example, when Wang resin is used, the reaction is carried out in the presence of DIC and DMAP in DMF to obtain an ester (S-2).<br><br>
When Q is, for example, a protective group E (S-3) of an amino group, the protective group can be removed depending on the protective group E under proper conditions to obtain the amine (S-4). For instance, in case Fmoc group (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl group) is used as E, the protective group can be removed with a base such as piperidine in a solvent such as DMF. The amide (S*5) can be obtained by reacting the amine (S-4) with a proper carboxylic acid by using a condensing agent such as DIC and, if necessary, a suitable additive such as HOAt or HOBt in an organic solvent such as DMF, NMP or dichloromethane. The amide (S-5) can also be obtained by reacting a proper acid chloride under the presence of a base.<br><br><br>
The ester (S-2) can be changed to an amine (S~6) under suitable conditions depending on the substituent R. For example, when a nitro group is used as R, the ester (S'2) can be changed to the amine (S-6) in the presence of a reducing agent such as S11CI2 or hydrates thereof in a solvent such as NMP, DMF or ethanol. In the case of an amine protected with Fmoc group (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl group) (FmocNH), the protective group can be removed with a base such as piperidine in a solvent such as DMF to obtain the amine (S-6).<br><br>
A quinazolinedione (S-9) can be sY11thesized by the following method. First, an amide (S-7) can be obtained by reacting the amine (S'6) with a benzoic acid halide having a nitro group in the ortho position under the eX1stence of 2,6-lutidine base in a solvent such as NMP, or by reacting it with a carboxylic acid having a nitro group in the ortho position activated by using a condensing agent such as DIC and, if necessary, a suitable additive such  as HOAt or HOBt in  an organic solvent such  as DMF,  NMP or<br><br>
dichloromethane. Then, an amine (S-8) is obtained by reducing the nitro group with S11CI2 or hydrates thereof and cyclized by reagents such as CDI (carbonyldiimidazole), triphosgene or p-nitrophenylchloroformate to obtain the quinazolinedione (S-9).<br>
As the other sY11thesizing methods, the quinazolinedione (S-9) can also be obtained by the following method. First, an amide (S-8) can be obtained by reacting the amine (S-6) with a carboxylic acid having a amino group in the ortho position activated by using a condensing agent such as BIC and, if necessary, a suitable additive such as HOAt or HOBt in an organic solvent such as DMF, NMP or dichloromethane. Then, an amide (S-8) is cyclized by the same process mentioned above to obtain the quinazolinedione (S-9).<br>
The substituents R' and R'' on the formulae (S~7) to (S-9) are groups which result from benzoic acid derivatives used in the above reaction. They are R1' or -XrN(R12)R13 described in the formula (l), or groups which can be converted into R1' or -XrN(Rl2)Rl3 in any stage of the sY11thesis.<br><br>
In the formula (S-10), the compounds wherein R" is represented by a methyl group can be obtained by Mitsunobu reaction with the quinazolinedione (S-9) using methanol, diisopropylazodicarboxylic acid and the like. They can also be obtained by reacting methyl iodide under the eX1stence of a base such as potassium carbonate.<br><br><br>
The ester (S-10) thus obtained are cleaved from a resin under suitable conditions to obtain a carboxylic acid (S-ll).<br>
For example, when Wang resin is used, in the ester (S-10), each of Q, R', R" and R"' are converted, if necessary, into 2-11-6-Y12-Ph-CO, -XrN(R12)R13, a methyl group or R1' or groups which are converted into 2-Y11-6-Y12-Ph-CO, -X1-N(R12)R13, a methyl group or R1' under the conditions of removal of the resin. Then, the ester (S-10) is treated with an acidic solution including such as TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) thereto to obtain a solution of the carboxylic acid (l • Rl = OH) wherein, in the formula (l), Rl is represented by a hydroxyl group. Further, the pure carboxylic acid (l : Rl = OH) can be obtained by applying well-known isolating and purification methods such as concentration, extraction, crystallization, column chromatography, HPLC and recrystallization to the thus-obtained carboxylic acid (l : Rl = OH).<br>
Besides, the carboxylic acid (l : Rl = OH) can also be obtained by applying the sY11thesizing methods on the solid phase to the liquid phase method wherein a suitable protective group is selected and well-known isolating and purification methods are used.<br>
In the carboxylic acid (S-l1), each of Q, R' R" and R"' represent 2-Y11-6-Y12-Ph-CO, -X1-N(R12)R13, a methyl group or R1', or groups which can be converted into 2-Y11-6-Y12-Ph-CO, -XrN(Ri2)Ri3, a methyl group or R1' in subsequent processes. The carboxyl group in the formula (S-ll) can be converted into -CO-R11 group (wherein R11 represents an alkoxyl group) by well-known esterification.  More concretely, the methods are as follows.<br><br>
The carboxyl group is treated with suitable alcohol under the dehydration condition under an acidic catalyst; it is treated with O-alkylating agents such as an alkyl halide under the eX1stence of a base or an acid, if necessary; it is treated with suitable alcohol under the eX1stence of a base, if necessary, after converting into acid halide with thionyl chloride and the like; more concretely, it is treated with, for example, ethyl chloroformate under the eX1stence of a base to convert into acid anhydride. Then the reaction substance is treated with suitable alcohol, if necessary, under the eX1stence of a base.; Further it is also treated with suitable alcohol under the eX1stence of a condensing agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and a catalyst such as dimethylaminopyridine, if necessary.<br>
After these processes, the compounds of the present invention (l : Rl is an alkoxyl group) can be obtained by conveR81on of Q, R', R" and R"', if necessary.<br>
In the formula (l), for example, a compound of (S-15) wherein X1 represents CH2 can be sY11thesized as follows. In the formula, R11a represents R11 or functional groups which can be converted into R11 in any stage of the sY11thesis.<br><br>
A nitro compound (S-12), which is a starting material, can be obtained, for example, by the sY11thesizing procedure such as that of isopropylester of (S)-2-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-3-(4-nitrophenyl) propionic acid in Process 1 of Reference Example 4. The nitro compound (S-12) is reduced to an aniline compound by reacting with SnCl2, the hydrogenation reaction in the presence of metal catalysts, and the like. More concretely,<br><br>
corresponding aniline compounds can be obtained, for example, by the sY11thesizing procedure  such  as  that  of isopropylester  of (S)-2-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-3-(4-aminophenyl) propionic acid in Process 2 of Reference Example 4. After condensing thus obtained aniline compounds and an anthranilic acid substituted with Xa (Xa represents a halogen atom, a triflate group and the like) by using a suitable condensing agent(s), cyclization is conducted by reagents such as CDI (carbonyldiimidazole), ethyl chloroform ate and triphosgene to obtain (S-13). Another methods for obtaining (S-13) is as follows:  The above aniline compounds are reacted with 2-nitrobenzoic acid chloride substituted with Xa under the eX1stence of a suitable base; and then, a nitro group is reduced by S11Cl2,  the hydrogenation reaction in metal catalysts, and the like and cyclized by reagents such as CDI, ethyl chloroformate and triphosgene. The additional other method for obtaining (S-13) is as follows; The urea linkage is formed between the above aniline compounds and ester of an anthranilic acid substituted with Xa by using CDI, ethyl chloroformate, triphosgene and the like;  and then the reaction mixture is cyclized by reacting with a suitable base, if necessary.  Next, R14 is introduced by the methods such as reacting the compound (S-13) with alkylhalide under the eX1stence of a suitable base, and Mitsunobu reaction using alcohol.  Then, Xa is converted into a carboxylic acid by, for example, a conveR81on reaction using a palladium catalyst and carbon monoX1de. The carboxylic acid is converted into an alcohol compound (S-14, Xb = OH) by the method such as the reductive reaction via mixed acid anhydride. Further, Xb is converted into a leaving group (Xb = a halogen group, a triflate group, a mesylate group, a tosylate group, etc) using a suitable acid halide, sulfonyl halide, thionyl halide, phosphoryl halide and the like.  Then, the substitution reaction is conducted thereto using a suitably substituted amine to obtain the object compound (S-15).<br>

After centrifuging the cells on a plate centrifuge (SIGMA 4-15C) at room temperature at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes, 50 /i L of supernatant thereof was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc MaX1sorp). Each 50 μL of Substrate Buffer (Promega, CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive CytotoX1city Assay) was added thereto, shaken on a plate shaker at 1000 rpm for 10 seconds and reacted in dark place at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then, each 50 μ L of Stop Solution (Promega, CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive CytotoX1city Assay) was added thereto and shaken on a plate shaker at 1000 rpm for 10 seconds. Its absorbance of 490nm was determined with a plate reader (Molecular<br><br>
Devices, Vmax). The absorbance thus obtained detects an activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) dissolved in the supernatant of each well. Namely, the absorbance is proportional to the number of remaining Jurkat cells on the plate -via the binding to VCAM-1. The test was conducted in duplicate and the binding rate of each test substance in various concentrations was determined while the absorbance of the test substance-free well was determined to be 100 % and the absorbance of the Jurkat-cell-free well was determined to be 0 %. The concentration for the 50 % inhibition of binding, IC50, was calculated. The obtained results are shown in Result Table 1.<br><br>

Activity to elevate the number of lymphocytes in the peripheral b100d in a<br>
rat<br>
After the substance inhibiting the bond betweenα 4integrin and VCAM-1 is administered in vivo, in case its inhibitory activity works effectively, it is suggested that the number of lymphocytes in the peripheral b100d is increasing by inhibiting adhesion of lymphocytes to the b100d vessels or organs (Nonpatent Literatures 45 and 47). The activity of the compounds of the present invention to elevate the number of lymphocytes in the rat was examined.<br><br>
A dosing solution was prepared by dissolving the compounds of the present invention to dim ethylsulf oxide, adding the mixed solution of polyethylene glycol 400 )- propylene glycol = l--l and turning it upside and down repeatedly. The final concentration of DMSO was adjusted to become 2.5%.<br>
The dosing solution of a test substance (3mg/kg, 10mg/kg or 30mg/kg) was orally administered to a male Wistar rat (6 to 8 weeks age) in an amount of 4mL/kg. After the settled time points after the administration, the b100d was drawn from its abdominal large vein under anesthesia and stirred in a EDTA-2K coated container for b100d collection. Then, the number of lymphocytes in the peripheral b100d was determined by an automated comprehensive hematology analyzer (SF-3000, Sysmex). The test was executed in n = 5, and the ratio (%) of the number of lymphocytes in the peripheral b100d in a test-substance-administered group to that in a vehicle-treated group (a control group) was calculated while the average value of the number of lymphocytes in the peripheral b100d in a control group was determined to be 100% .
