QUINOLINES USEFUL IN TREATING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides quinolines that are useful in the treatment or inhibition of LXR mediated diseases.<br>
Atherosclerosis, a complex disease of lipid disorder and inflammation, is the<br>
leading cause of death in developed countries. A number of independent risk factors<br>
have been identified and the most notable are high levels of serum LDL cholesterol<br>
and low HDL cholesterol. Although some of the most effective therapies such as<br>
statins have been shown to lower LDL cholesterol significantly (20-60%), still most<br>
patients experience adverse coronary events. Also, statins have their own<br>
undesirable side effect profile (myotoxicity) which prevent many patients from taking<br>
them. Therefore, additional therapeutic strategies to not only decrease LDL<br>
cholesterol but also increase HDL cholesterol are critically needed. An important<br>
reason to increase HDL cholesterol is to increase cholesterol transport from<br>
peripheral tissues to liver for metabolism and excretion. This function of transporting<br>
cholesterol from periphery to liver is called reverse cholesterol transport and HDL<br>
plays a major role in this pathway. In addition, HDL has been suggested to inhibit the<br>
oxidation of LDL cholesterol, reduce the inflammatory response of endothelial cells,<br>
inhibit the coagulation pathway and promote the availability of nitric oxide. The key<br>
transporter involved in HDL production and reverse cholesterol transport is ABCA1.<br>
Therefore, upregulation of ABCA1 results in increased reverse cholesterol transport<br>
as well as inhibition of cholesterol absorption in the gut.<br>
LXRs (Liver X receptors), originally identified from liver as orphan receptors, are members of the nuclear hormone receptor super family and are involved in the regulation of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. They are ligand-activated transcription factors and bind to DNA as obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors. While LXRa is restricted to certain tissues such as liver, kidney, adipose tissue, intestine and macrophages, LXRß displays a ubiquitous tissue distribution pattern. Activation of LXRs by oxysterols (endogenous ligands) in macrophages results in the expression of several genes involved in lipid metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport including ABCA1, ABCG1 and ApoE. Studies have been conducted in LXRa k/o, LXRß k/o and double k/o mice to determine the physiological<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2005/058834	PCT/US2004/041399<br>
role of LXRs in lipid homeostasis and atherosclerosis. The data, indicate that in double k/o mice on normal chow diet, increased cholesterol accumulation was observed in macrophages (foam cells) of spleen, lung and arterial wail. This was associated with reduced serum HDL cholesterol and increased LDL cholesterol despite normal total cholesterol levels. While LXRa k/o mice did not show significant changes in hepatic gene expression, LXRß k/o mice showed 58% decrease in hepatic ABCA1 expression and 208% increase in SREBP1c expression suggesting that LXRß may be involved in the regulation of fiver SREBP1c expression. Agonists of LXRa or (3 are very effective in upregulating ABCA1 expression (desirable effect) in macrophages. The biological activities of several agonists have been shown in two atherosclerotic mouse models (ApoE k/o and LDLR k/o). Treatment of these mice with, agonists for 12 weeks resulted in significant inhibition of atherosclerotic lesions. While these two compounds had variable effects on serum cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, both compounds caused a significant increase in serum HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. These in vivo data agree well with the in vitro data obtained for the compounds in macrophages.<br>
In addition to the lipid and triglyceride effects described above, a very recent communication in Nature Medicine (9: 213-219, 2003) presents convincing data that activation of LXRs results in the inhibition of inflammation and proinfiammatory gene expression in three different models of inflammation (LPS-induced sepsis, acute contact dermatitis of the ear and chronic atherosclerotic inflammation of the artery wall). These data suggest that LXR modulators can mediate two-pronged effect (removal of cholesterol from the macrophages and inhibition of vascular inflammation) resulting in the inhibition of atherosclerotic lesion.<br>

Representative compounds of this invention were evaluated in standard pharmacological test procedures which measured their affinity to bind to LXR and to upregulate the gene ABCA1, which causes cholesterol efflux from atherogenic cells, such as macrophages.<br>
LXR activation is critical for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, but its coinC1dent regulation of fatty acid metabolism may lead to increased serum and hepatic triglyceride levels. Selective LXR modulators that activate cholesterol efflux with minimal impact on SREBP-1c expression and triglyceride synthesis in liver would be expected to reduce atherosclerotic risk with an improved therapeutic index and minimize the potential for deleterious effects on metabolic balance. A method is described herein for identifying selective LXR ligands with differential activity for regulating ABCA1 (ABCG1) vs. SREBP-1c.<br>
Accordingly, LXR ligands were identified initially in cell-free LXR beta and LXR alpha competition binding assays. LXR ligands were further characterized by gene expression profiling for tissue selective gene regulation. Selective LXR modulators demonstrate agonist activity for ABCA1 transactivation but exhibit no effect or inhibition of SREBP-1c gene expression in differentiated THP-1 macrophages. Gene expression analysis in an antagonist mode was used to further delineate differential regulation of ABCA1 and SREBP-1c gene expression. In a competition assay with known potent synthetic LXR agonists, selective LXR ligands<br>

Ceil type or tissue speC1fiCity may be further evaluated in additional cell lines, intestinal, CaCo2 or liver, HepG2 and Huh-7 cells where ABCA1 activity influences net cholesterol absorption and reverse cholesterol transport.

oral and parenteral administration include water (partially containing additives as above, e.g. cellulose derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution); alcohols, including monohydric alcohols such as ethanol and polyhydric alcohols such as glycols and their derivatives; lethiC1ns, and oils such as fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil. For parenteral administration, the liquid carrier can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid carriers are useful in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration. The liquid carrier for pressurized compositions can be a halogenated hydrocarbon or other pharmaceutically acceptable propellant.<br>
A liquid pharmaceutical composition such as a syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to one or more liquid carriers and the active ingredients, a sweetening agent such as sucrose, preservatives such as methyl and propyl parabens, a pharmaceutically acceptable dye or coloring agent, or a flavoring agent such as cherry or orange flavoring.<br>
Liquid pharmaceutical compositions which are sterile solutions or suspensions can be administered intraocularly or parenterally, for example, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection. Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy injectability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing a liquid carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The liquid carrier may be suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered rectally or vaginally in the form of a conventional suppository. For administration by intranasal or intrabronchial inhalation or insufflation, the compounds of this invention may be formulated into an aqueous or partially aqueous solution, which can then be utilized in the form of an aerosol. The compounds of this invention may be administered topically, or also trarisdermally through the use of a transdermal patch containing the<br>
