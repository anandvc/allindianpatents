				<td>BIO-VEHICLE, BIOSENSOR AND BIOTRANSDUCER SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a bio-vehicle, and more particularly to a bio-vehicle which is proteinaceous and capable of capturing and preserving chemicals of low molecular weight, e.g. odorants, drugs, and pigments. The present invention also relates to a biosensor, and more particular to a biosensor comprising a proteinaceous bio-vehicle and capable of detecting the binding of chemicals to the bio-vehicle. The present invention further relates to a biotransducer system, and more particularly a biotransducer system comprising a proteinaceous bio-vehicle and generating an electronic signal while detecting the binding of chemicals to the bio-vehicle. The present invention also relates to the uses of the above devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
To date, commercially available instruments in the artificial-olfaction field are rather sophisticated and most of them are expensive. Conventional array-based chemical sensing has followed a one-sensor-one-analyte approach that suffers on several disadvantages, e.g., highly selective binding materials for wanted ligands are rare and difficult to find. In fact, the detecting specificity of current systems is limited to a small number of ligands. Moreover, the outputs need to be processed by a PC-like hardware and often become extremely complicated when multiple analytes are applied. Several 'artificial-nose' systems have been demonstrated mainly based on chemical-sensing techniques; however, practical applications in current platforms are prevented by the high cost and limited information given. An alternative paradigm for sensing is to mimic the biological system, which has been shown in the<br>
2<br><br>
booming of biosensors (sensors incorporating a biological or biologically<br>
derived sensing elements). For designing the second-generation biosensor to<br>
satisfy more demands, ranged from home testing to the on-line monitoring in<br>
manufactories, the pocket-sized glucose biosensors already in market are<br>
considerable   standards.   Accordingly,   portable   instruments   available   at<br>
present (or in the expecting future) may allow users to design their own<br>
biosensors by replacing the chips of sensing elements. Such pioneer devices<br>
can be exampled by the "HAZMATCAD" manufactured by the Microsensor<br>
Systems Inc. (USA), the "Cyranose 320" provided by the Cyrano Sciences<br>
Inc. (Canada), and the "Chem Lab on a Chip" announced by the Sandia<br>
National Laboratories (USA). Despite of that, extensive applications of<br>
artificial-nose are still constrained by the variety of sensing elements that can<br>
be fabricated in scale and sold in cheap.<br>
Odor perception in biological system first occurs during odorant molecules binding onto specific protein receptors within specialized organs or tissues. In one approach, biological materials have to be utilized as parts of electronic nose devices based on different sensing technologies; therefore, the selections of biological materials are quite diverse. Preferable biomaterials can be purified olfactory receptors (Wu, Biosens. Bioelectron. 14:9 (1999)), antibodies (Wong et al., Biosens. Bioelectron. 17:9 (2002)), fish scales (Lundstrom and Svensson, Biosens. Bioelectron. 13:689 (1998)), insect antennae (Schroth et al., Electrochimica Acta 44: 3821 (1999)), and synthetic peptides (Wu and Lo, J. Biotech. 80:63 (2000)). Unfortunately, all these systems seem have difficulties for production in the industrial manner, considering the cost and viability. Consequently, there is a need to seek the ideal biomaterials for a broad range of sensing applications.<br>
3<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An objective of the present invention is to provide a bio-vehicle that provides<br>
alternative   options   for   capturing   chemicals   such   odorants,   drugs,   and<br>
pigments.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a biosensor that can<br>
be fabricated in scale and sold in cheap.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is to provide a biotransducer<br>
system which can be applied to a broad range of sensing applications.<br>
A first aspect of the present invention relates to a bio-vehicle for binding a<br>
specified   ligand.   The   bio-vehicle   comprises   a   solid   support;   and   a<br>

(MUP).<br>
A second aspect of the present invention relates to a biosensor for detecting<br>
the binding of a specified ligand. The biosensor comprises a piezoelectric<br>
base producing electrical charges in response to a mechanical stress; and a<br>
4<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention will now be described more specifically with reference to the  following embodiments-  It is to  be noted that the  following descriptions of preferred embodiments of this invention are presented herein for purpose of illustration and description only; it is not intended to be exhaustive or to be limited to the precise form disclosed. Referring to Fig, 1, a biotransducer system comprises one or more groups of proteinaceous elements capable of binding a broad range of chemicals of ligands 10 as a proteinaceous substrate 20, and an electronic detecting device 30 generating electronic signals varying with features of Hgands.  The electronic detecting device 30 includes a piezoelectric base 31 producing electric charges in response to a mechanical stress and a recorder 32 electrically connected to the piezoelectric base 31. This system is aimed at but not limited to a simple and portable device that can be used in routine works for sensing evaluation.<br>
The proteinaceous substrate 20 is immobilized onto the piezoelectric base 31. When the ligand(s) is bound to the proteinaceous substrate 20, a mechanical stress is applied onto the piezoelectric base 31 so that electric charges are generated and the recorder 32 records the electronic signals accordingly. For the application of sensoiy evaluation, air quality monitoring, quality control of cosmetic products, quality control of fermentation products or medical diagnosis via breath analysis, the biotransducer system is preferably capable of binding a ligand chemical(s) 10 of odorants, drugs, and pigments. The protein or proteins included in the proteinaceous substrate 20 is prferably<br>
7<br><br>
selected from a lipocalin protein family and recombinant functional homologues thereof. A profound review of lipocalin can be seen in Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)- Protein Structure and Molecular Enzymology 1482 (2000)).<br>
Lipocalins are a prolific group of proteins (more than 140) found in eubacteria and a variety of eukaryotic cells. Their major biological functions are pheromonal carriers, transporters for vitamin A, olfactory and gustatory proteins, colouration pigments, synthases of prostaglandin D, accessory enzymes for photosynthesis, modulators of immunity, stress proteins, and regulators of cell differentiations. Despite of low levels of overall sequence similarity (usually below 20%), members of the lipocalin family share a common signature of an eight-stranded antiparallel ? -barrel with a repeated +1 topology enclosing an internal ligand-binding pocket (for a concise introduction: www.ienner.ac.uk/lipocalin.htm').<br>
Most of lipocalins are abundant and can be isolated from the natural sources, e.g., one lipocalin, beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), is the major protein contain of cow's milk. Recombinant forms of lipocalins are available and well known in the art, e.g., retinal-binding protein (Wang et al., Gene 133(2):291 (1993)), tear lipocalin (Holzfeind et al., FEBS Lett. 395(2-3):95 (1996)), bovine beta-lactoglobulin (Cho et al., Protein Engineering 7(2):263 (1994)), major urinary protein (Ferrari et al., FEBS Lett. 401(l):73 (1997)), nitric oxide transport protein (Andersen et al., Structure 6(10):1315 (1998)), and odorant-binding protein (Lobel et al., European J. Biochem. 254(2):318 (1998)). One of the examples of the lipocalins is the major urinary protein (MUP). MUP isthe major protein component of mouse urine (about 5-10 mg per day for male) and acts as pheromone transporter (for review see Cavaggioni and Mucignat-Carerta, BBA 1482(2-1):218 (2000)). Recombinant MUP can be<br>
8<br><br>
prepared by a standard procedure well known to those skilled in the art. MUP<br>
performs especially well for carrying compounds of lower molecular weight,<br>
e.g. less than 1000 daltons and very volatile.<br>
An embodiment of the piezoelectric base 31 is a quartz crystal microbalance<br>
(QCM).<br>
The  preferred  electronic  nose  technology  of the  present  invention  is<br>
piezoelectric-based. Measurements are performed by detecting the binding of<br>
analytes (ligands) onto the sensing elements immobilized on piezoelectric<br>
materials, e.g., quartz crystal. The adsorption of ligand induces a shift in the<br>
oscillation frequency proportional to the mass of the encountered ligand. The<br>
operating performance of the present invention is described as bellow:<br>
i) Surface activation of QCM chip<br>
Gold electrodes of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) surface are cleaned by<br>
immersing in 1.2 N NaOH and then in 1.2 N HC1. After rinsing and drying,<br>
the QCM electrodes are soaked in 1 mM 2-aminoethanethiol/DMSO solution<br>
for 12 hours and washed by double distilled water for 10 min.   Then the<br>
QCM  electrodes  are  dried  in  oven  and  dripped  with  4   ul   of 2.5%<br>
glutaldehyde   for   1   hour.      Two   ul   of  1 %   polyethylenimine/methanol<br>
(PEI/MeOH) solution are added onto activated surface of QCM in a closed<br>
chamber at room temperature for 12 hours.    Finally, the QCM chips are<br>
washed two times and dried in oven.<br>
ii) Immobilization of MUP on activated QCM chips<br>
Activated QCM chips are dipped in 2.5% glutaldehyde solution for 1 hour,<br>
and then MUP solution (20|ig/ml in lOmM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) are<br>
added and kept for 1 hour.  Blocking the activated surface of QCM chips is<br>
performed by 100 mM glycine.<br>
iii) Determining the binding of ligand<br>
9<br><br>
A sample is respectively applied in a syringe and kept in an oven at 50°C.<br>
An AT-cut  QCM device  with basic resonant frequency of 10MHz is<br>
employed to determine the adsorption of odorant vapor.    The evaporated<br>
odorant sample is pumped into the detection chamber of QCM and the shift<br>
of resonant frequency is recorded.<br>
Figs. 2~5 illustrates the frequency vs. time diagrams of various samples<br>
illustrating the electronic signals outputted by the same biotransducer system.<br>
The sample for the ligand-binding test in Fig. 2 is air. Since a flow rate of air<br>
results in a certain level of buoyancy, the resonant frequency of QCM<br>
increases.<br>
The samples for the ligand-binding test in Figs. 3 and 4 are 40 ui and 4 ul<br>
phenylacetate, respectively. As shown, the adsorption of ligand induces a<br>
shift in the oscillation frequency proportional to the mass of the encountered<br>
ligand. It is also shown that a diluted sample can also be detected by the<br>
present system.<br>
The samples for the ligand-binding test in Fig. 5 are 4 ul phenylacetate, air<br>
and 40 ul phenylacetate in sequence. It is shown that the samples can be<br>
adsorbed and desorbed as well. Therefore, the present system can be reused<br>
and has potential in quantitative analysis and on-line determination.<br>
For the biochemical vapor testing, gaseous samples corresponding to 10 cm3<br>
of the yeast culture exposure are analyzed by the present invention. Pichia<br>
fermentans L-5 is cultured in 4 L fermentor with 1.6 L working volume<br>
aerated in 0.6 wm (volume air/volume tank per minutes) at 400 rpm. The<br>
initial medium contains phenylalanine (2000 ppm), glucose (100 g/L), and 50<br>
mM KH2PO4. The expected odorants in such culture exposure includes 2-<br>
phenylethyl alcohol and 2-phenylethyl acetate, etc.<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 show the binding of the odorants onto the proteinaceous<br>
10<br><br>
substrate at the early stage and middle stage, respectively. The potential in quantitative analysis and on-line determination is prominent. A variety of ligands are surveyed according to the above procedures. Table I lists the changes of signal in frequency upon the bindings of different ligands, including phenylacetate, propylbutyrate, hexylbutyrate, benzylbutyrate, propyltiglate, hexyltiglate, and benzyltiglate.<br><br><br>
Table I<br><br>
Ligand	phenylacetate	propyibutyrate	hexylbutyrate	benzylbutyrate<br>
Change of Signal (in frequency f)	46	26	23	43<br><br>
Ligand	propyltiglate	hexyltiglate	benzyltiglate	<br>
Change of<br>
Signal (in frequency/)	29	55	43	<br>
In addition to QCM, the electronic detecting device used in the present system can also be a field effect transistor (FET) device or surface acoustic wave (SAW) device. The principle and operation of the devices are well known to those skilled in the art, and will not redundantly described herein. In addition to the application in a biosensor or biotransducer system, the proteinaceous substrate can be used as a bio-vehicle for absorption, preservation, purification or delivery of specified ligands. The proteinaceous substrate is immobilized onto or received in a solid support (not shown) which can be a disposable biochip or a lasting container. While the invention has been described in terms of what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention need not be limited to the disclosed embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims which are to be accorded with the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar structures.<br>
