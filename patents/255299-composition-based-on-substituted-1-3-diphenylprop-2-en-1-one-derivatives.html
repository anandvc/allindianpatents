				<td>The invention concerns compositions comprising substituted 1,3-cliphenylprop-2-en-1-one derivatives and uses thereof, particularly in the fields of human and veterinary health. The compounds according to the invention have pharmacological antioxidant properties and PPARα and PPARγ activator properties which are advantageous. The invention more specifically describes the different uses of said compounds and the pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions comprising same. The compounds according to the invention are useful in particular for preventing or treating cardiovascular diseases, syndrome X, restenosis, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, inflammatory diseases, cancers or neoplasms (benign or malignant tumors), neurodegenerative, dermatological diseases and disorders related to oxidative stress, for preventing or treating the effects of ageing in general and for example skin ageing, in particular in the field of cosmetics (development of wrinkles and the like).<br>
The derivatives and/or compositions of the invention can be used in particular for treating diseases implicating tissues that express PPARa and PPARγ. More particularly, they advantageously allow to treat inflammatory, proliferative, degenerative diseases or pathologies affecting different organs and tissues, in particular diseases involving pathological angiogenesis or neovascularization as well as any pathology or disorder (for example related to age) involving an oxidative stress. In an advantageous manner, the compounds of the invention can be used in the treatment of diseases or disorders affecting tissues and/or organs, irrespective of the etiological component.<br>
The PPARs, or "peroxisome proliferator activated receptors", are nuclear receptors from the superfamily of transcription factors activated by the following ligands: steroids/thyroid hormones/retinoids. To date, three PPAR isotypes have been cloned in mice and humans : PPARα, PPARß/δ and PPARγ. While PPARß/δ expression in humans appears to be ubiquitous, PPARα and γ exhibit<br>
a differential tissue distribution (Braissant and Wahli 1998). PPARα is expressed in cells with high fatty acid catabolic activity and in cells with high peroxisomal activity (hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, renal proximal tubules, intestinal mucosa). PPARp/8 is expressed ubiquitously and abundantly in most tissues. As far as PPARγ expression is concerned, it is limited mainly to adipose tissue, certain immune system cells and retina and is present in only trace amounts in other organs (Braissant and Wahli 1998).<br>
The PPARs contain several domains having different properties. A DNA binding domain (DBD) recognizes specific sequences, also called response elements, located in regulatory regions of their target genes. Like other nuclear receptors, the PPARs also contain a ligand binding domain, the activation of PPARs by their ligand modulating the expression of genes which contain specific PPAR response elements (PPRE) in the promoter region. To activate transcription of their target genes, the activated PPARs must heterodimerize with another nuclear receptor, RXR (Retinoid-X-Receptor). Taking the example of PPARα, its action is mediated by a class of compounds such as the fibrates which have a lipid-lowering effect. Natural ligands have also been identified such as for example fatty acids, eicosanoids (leukotriene B4) and 8(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (Kliewer, Sundseth et al. 1997).<br>
The PPARs have been associated primarily with lipid and glucose metabolism. PPAR activators, such as fibrates, enable a regulation of plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations via activation of PPARα (Hourton, Delerive et al. 2001). Fibrate therapy leads to an increase in fatty acid oxidation in liver. Fibrates also decrease the synthesis and expression of triglycerides (Staels and Auwerx 1998). PPARα activators are also capable of correcting hyperglycemia and insulin level. Fibrates also reduce adipose tissue mass through a mechanism which is independent of food intake and leptin gene expression (Guerre-Millo, Gervois et al. 2000).<br>
The therapeutic interest of PPARγ agonists has been widely investigated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Spiegelman 1998). It has been shown that PPARγ agonists restore insulin sensitivity in target tissues and reduce plasma<br>
glucose, lipid and insulin levels both in animal models of type 2 diabetes and in humans (Ram VJ 2003).<br>
PPAR activation by ligands also plays a role in regulating the expression of genes that participate in processes such as inflammation, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis and the activities of iNOS, MMPase and TIMPs. Activation of PPARα in keratinocytes results in a cessation of their proliferation and expression of genes involved in differentiation (Komuves, Hanley et al. 2000). The PPARs have anti-inflammatory properties because they negatively interfere with transcription mechanisms involving other transcription factors like NF-KB or transcriptional activators like (STAT) and AP-1 (Desvergne and Wahli 1999). Said anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties make the PPARS (and particularly PPARα) interesting therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases such as vascular occlusive diseases (atherosclerosis, etc.), hypertension, diseases related to neovascularization (diabetic retinopathy, etc.), inflammatory diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, etc.) and neoplastic diseases (carcinogenesis, etc.).<br>
Free radicals play a role in a very large range of pathologies including allergy, tumor initiation and promotion, cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerosis, ischemia), genetic and metabolic disorders (diabetes), infectious and degenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Prion, etc.) and ophthalmic disorders (Mates, Perez-Gomez et al. 1999).<br>
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during normal cell functioning. ROS comprise the hydroxyl radicals (OH), superoxide anion (02), hydrogen peroxide (H202) and nitric oxide (NO). Said species are very labile and, due to their high chemical reactivity, constitute a danger to the biological functions of cells. They induce lipid peroxidation, oxidation of certain enzymes and very extensive oxidation of proteins leading to degradation thereof. Protection against lipid peroxidation is an essential process in aerobic organisms, because peroxidation products can cause DNA damage. Thus a deregulation or modification of the equilibrium between the production, processing and elimination of radical species by natural antioxidant defenses<br>
leads to the establishment of processes that are deleterious to the cell or organism.<br>
ROS are processed via an antioxidant system that comprises an enzymatic component and a non-enzymatic component.<br>
The enzymatic system is composed of several enzymes which have the following characteristics:<br>
-	Superoxide dismutase (SOD) destroys the superoxide radical by converting it to peroxide. The peroxide in turn is acted upon by another enzyme system. Low levels of SOD are continuously produced by aerobic respiration. Three classes of SOD have been identified in humans, each containing Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, or Ni as cofactor. The three forms of human SOD are distributed as follows : a cytosolic Cu-Zn SOD, a mitochondrial Mn-SO and an extracellular SOD.<br>
-	Catalase is very efficient at converting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to water and O2. Hydrogen peroxide is enzymatically catabolized in aerobic organisms. Catalase also catalyzes the reduction of a variety of hydroperoxides (ROOH).<br>
-	Glutathione peroxidase uses selenium as cofactor and catalyzes the reduction of hydroperoxides (ROOH and H202) by using glutathione, and thereby protects cells against oxidative damage.<br>
Non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses comprise molecules that are synthesized or supplied in the diet.<br>
Antioxidant molecules are present in different cell compartments. Detoxification enzymes for example eliminate free radicals and are essential to cell life. The three most important types of antioxidant compounds are the carotenoids, vitamin C and vitamin E (Gilgun-Sherki, Melamed et al. 2001).<br>
The inventors have shown that, in a surprising manner, the compounds of the invention have PPARα agonist activity and antioxidant properties. The inventive compounds are therefore capable of interfering with at least two signalling pathways which are activated in particular in inflammation : cytokine production and free radical production. By acting synergistically, the compounds of the invention constitute an advantageous therapeutic means for treating pathologies related to inflammation (atherosclerosis, allergy, asthma, eczema, pruritus, etc.), neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc.), deregulations of lipid and/or glucose metabolism (diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity, etc.), cell proliferation/differentiation (carcinogenesis, etc.) and disorders related to ageing (skin or central nervous system, etc.).<br>
The inventors have shown that the compounds according to the invention concurrently have PPAR activator, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.<br>
Thus, the invention concerns pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one substituted 1,3-diphenyl]prop-2-en-1-one derivative for the treatment of pathologies related to inflammation, neurodegeneration, deregulations of lipid and/or glucose metabolism, cell proliferation and/or differentiation and/or skin or central nervous system ageing.<br>

It can be seen that incubation of LDL with the test compounds at a concentration of 10-4M delayed conjugated diene formation. The lag phase was 111 minutes for copper alone as compared with a lag phase of 132, 145, 134 and 203 minutes, respectively, when LDL were incubated with compound 3, compound 12, compound 14, compound 17. The lag phase was more than 480 minutes when LDL were incubated with compound 2. This lag in the formation of conjugated dienes is characteristic of antioxidants.<br>

This lag in the formation of conjugated dienes is characteristic of antioxidants.<br>
Figure 1-10 shows the rate of diene formation after different treatments. Incubation of the compounds with LDL in the presence of copper slowed the rate<br>
of conjugated diene formation.

This rate was 1.8 nmol/min/mg of LDL with copper alone, 1.49 nmol/min/mg of LDL when LDL were incubated in the presence of compounds 37 at 10-4M, 0.71 nmol/min/mg of LDL when LDL were incubated in the presence of compounds 38 and 0.54 nmol/min/mg of LDL when LDL were incubated in the presence of compounds 41.<br>
Figure 1-14 represents the maximum amount of conjugated dienes formed over time.  Incubation of LDL with copper led to formation of 372 nmol of conjugated<br>
dienes per mg of LDL, as compared with 338 nmol per mg of LDL, 244 nmol per mg of LDL, and 71 nmol per mg of LDL in the presence of compounds 37, 38 and 41, respectively.<br>

EXAMPLE 2 : Evaluation of PPAR activation in vitro<br>
The inventive compounds which were tested are the compounds whose preparation is described in the above examples.<br>
Nuclear receptors of the PPAR subfamily which are activated by two major classes of pharmaceuticals - fibrates and glitazones, widely used in the clinic for the treatment of dyslipidemias and diabetes - play an important role in lipid and glucose homeostasis. The following experimental data show that the inventive compounds activate PPARα and PPARγ in vitro.<br>
PPAR activation was tested in vitro in RK13 fibroblast cell lines by measuring the transcriptional activity of chimeras composed of the DNA binding domain of the yeast gal4 transcription factor and the ligand binding domain of the different PPARs. These latter results were then confirmed in cell lines according to the following protocols :<br>
The example is given for RK13 cells.<br>
a.	Culture protocols<br>
RK13 cells were from ECACC (Porton Down, UK) and were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % (V/V) fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin (Gibco, Paisley, UK) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, Paisley, UK). The culture medium was changed every two days. Cells were kept at 37°C in a humidified 95% air/5% C02 atmosphere.<br>
b.	Description of plasmids used for transfection<br>
The plasmids pG5TkpGL3, pRL-CMV, pGal4-hPPARα, pGal4-hPPARγ and pGal4Φ have been described by Raspe, Madsen et al. (1999). The pGal4-mPPARα and pGal4-hPPARγ constructs were obtained by cloning into the pGal4-
c.	Transfection<br>
RK13 cells were seeded in 24-well culture dishes at 5x104 cells/well and transfected for 2 hours with the reporter plasmid pG5TkpGL3 (50 ng/well), the expression vectors pGaM-, pGal4-mPPARα, pGal4-hPPARα, pGal4-hPPARγ (100 ng/well) and the transfection efficiency control vector pRL-CMV (1 ng/well) according to the previously described protocol (Raspe, Madsen et al. 1999), then incubated for 36 hours with the test compounds. At the end of the experiment, the cells were lysed (Gibco, Paisley, UK) and luciferase activity was determined with a Dual-Luciferase™ Reporter Assay System kit (Promega, Madison, Wl, USA) according to the supplier's instructions as previously described (Raspe, Madsen etal. 1999).<br>
The inventors demonstrate an increase in luciferase activity in cells treated with the inventive compounds and transfected with the pGal4-hPPARα plasmid. Said<br>
induction of luciferase activity indicates that the inventive compounds are activators of PPARa.<br>
The results are exemplified in figures 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6 which illustrate the PPARa activator properties of inventive compounds 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 31, 33, 37, 38, 41.<br>
The inventors demonstrate an increase in luciferase activity in cells treated with the inventive compounds and transfected with the pGal4-hPPARγ plasmid. Said induction of luciferase activity indicates that the inventive compounds are activators of PPARγ.<br>
The results are exemplified in figure 2-7 which illustrates the PPARγ activator properties of inventive compounds 17, 33 and 29.<br>
One aspect of the invention is illustrated by the treatment of diseases like atherosclerosis and psoriasis the manifestations of which are vascular and cutaneous, respectively. These two pathologies are characterized by chronic systemic inflammation and uncontrolled cell proliferation (smooth muscle cells in the case of atherosclerosis and epidermal keratinocytes in psoriasis). These two pathologies have in common the expression of inflammatory cytokines, mediated by a transcription factor of the inflammatory response NF-kB, AP-1 and NFAT (Komuves, Hanley et al. 2000; Neve, Fruchart et al. 2000). By down-regulating the NF-kB and AP-1 signalling pathway, PPARa inhibits the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response such as the genes coding for interleukin-6, cyclooxygenase-2 and endothelin-1 and therefore impedes the mobilization of monocytes and spumous cells to the atheromatous lesions.<br>
EXEMPLE 3 : Evaluation of the effects on lipid metabolism in vivo<br>
The inventive compounds which were tested are the compounds whose preparation is described in the above examples.<br>
Fibrates, widely used in the clinic for the treatment of dyslipidemias underlying the development of atherosclerosis, one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world, are potent activators of the PPARa nuclear receptor, which regulates the expression of genes involved in lipid transport (apolipoproteins such as Apo Al, Apo All and Apo CIII, membrane transporters such as FAT) and catabolism (ACO, CPT-I and CPT-II). In humans and rodents, treatment with PPARa activators therefore leads to a decrease in circulating levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.<br>
The following protocols were designed to demonstrate a decrease in circulating triglyceride and cholesterol levels as well as the interest of the inventive compounds in a context of preventing and/or treating cardiovascular diseases.<br>
a)	Treatment of animals<br>
Apo E2/E2 transgenic mice were kept on a 12-hour light/dark cycle at a constant temperature of 20 ± 3°C. After a 1 week acclimation, the mice were weighed and divided into groups of 6 animals selected so that body weight would be uniformly distributed. The test compounds were suspended in carboxymethylcellulose and administered by intragastric gavage at the indicated doses, once a day for 7 or 8 days. Animals had access to food and water ad libitum. At the end of the experiment the animals were weighed and sacrificed under anesthesia. Blood was collected on EDTA. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 minutes. Liver samples were taken and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis.<br>
b)	Measurement of serum lipids and apolipoproteins<br>
Serum lipid concentrations (total cholesterol and free cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids) were determined by a colorimetric assay (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) according to the supplier's instructions. Serum concentrations of apolipoproteins Al, All and Clll were determined as previously described (Raspe et al. J. Lipid Res. 40, 2099-2110, 1999, Asset G et al., Lipids, 34,39-44,1999).<br>
The results are exemplified in figures 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8, 3-9, 3-10, 3-1 let 3-12 which illustrate the activity of inventive compounds 7,17, 29, 33 and 41 on triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism, c)      RNA analysis<br>
Total RNA was isolated from liver specimens by extraction with a mixture of guanidine thiocyanate/acid phenol/chloroform according to the previously described protocol (Raspe et al. J. Lipid Res. 40, 2099-2110, 1999). Messenger RNA was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR with a Light Cycler Fast Start DNA Master Sybr Green I kit (Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) on a Light Cycler System (Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Primer pairs specific for the genes ACO, Apo CI 11 and Apo All were used as probes. Primer pairs specific for the genes 36B4, β-actin and cyclophilin were used as control probes. Alternatively, total RNA was analyzed by Northern Blot or Dot Blot according to the previously described protocol (Raspe et al. J. Lipid Res. 40, 2099-2110, 1999).<br>
EXAMPLE 4: Evaluation of the antioxidant properties of the inventive compounds<br>
A particularly advantageous aspect of the invention is illustrated by the role of the intrinsic antioxidant properties of the compounds used in the inventive compositions in the control of oxidative stress. This original association between the PPARct agonist property and the antioxidant property represents an effective means of treating pathologies related to an alteration of the redox status of a cell. This illustration applies in particular to a pathology such as Alzheimer's disease in which free radicals play a decisive role. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, oxidative status is modified in brain cells. Free radicals thus cause lipid peroxidation as well as oxidation of proteins and nucleic acids (DNA/RNA). Said oxidations alter the biological properties of biomolecules and lead to neuronal degeneration (Butterfield, Drake et al. 2001). NF-kB is a transcription factor known to be sensitive to the redox status of cells.<br>
Therefore it is closely involved in the response to oxidative stress because it allows activation of the target genes of inflammation (Butterfield, Drake et al. 2001). The compounds used in the inventive compositions therefore have the original property of preventing activation of the NF-kB pathway at two different levels, by inhibiting its activation by free radicals (antioxidant) but also by preventing its transcriptional activity (PPARa agonist).<br>
The inventive compounds represent a novel means of fighting against the effects of ageing and more particularly against the effects of UV-induced photo-ageing where free radicals actively participate in the pathogenesis of disorders ranging from skin erythema and wrinkle formation to more serious pathologies like skin cancer (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma as well as melanoma).<br>
Metabolism is what underlies the production of free radicals, but environmental factors like excitatory ionizing radiation (ultraviolet) or inflammatory mediators (cytokines), chemotherapeutic drugs, and hyperthermia are potent activators of free radical species and produce a disequilibrium in the redox balance of the cell. When the stress is severe, survival of the cell depends on its capacity to adapt, resist the stress and degrade damaged molecules. During ageing, the capacity of cells to defend themselves appropriately against an oxidative attack is crucial, and so an increase in cells' capacity to resist such attacks should help provide a solution to fight against the occurrence of the effects of ageing and should promote an increase in the longevity of the organism.<br>
Solar radiation can alter the composition of certain molecules in the body. UVB was long considered to be the sole cause of the sun's deleterious effects on the body. It is now known that UVA radiation can have a direct adverse effect but above all that it potentiates the effects of UVB. The principal molecules vulnerable to alteration, often in a harmful way but also in a beneficial way, are : - DNA, in which thymine dimers can form under the action of UVB. Although DNA does not absorb UVA rays, the latter can damage the genetic material and therefore be mutagenic. A pathology such as Xeroderma pigmentosum, which is due to an absence or an alteration of DNA repair mechanisms, predisposes to the development of cancer of basal keratinocytes.<br>
-	Proteins, the spatial conformation of which can be altered. Many proteins can be inactivated in this manner: enzymes, transporters, ion channels, cytoskeletal proteins, receptors. Said alterations can be induced by UVA and UVB radiation.<br>
-	Lipids, which can undergo UVA-induced peroxidation, said peroxidation being proportional to the degree of fatty acid unsaturation.<br>
The following protocols were designed to demonstrate the intrinsic antioxidant properties of the compounds used in the inventive compositions for prevention and/or treatment of disorders related to oxidative stress.<br>
1. Protection against LDL oxidation bv copper:<br>
The inventive compounds which were tested are the compounds whose preparation is described in the above examples.<br>
LDL oxidation is an important alteration and plays a predominant role in the establishment and development of atherosclerosis (Jurgens, Hoff et al. 1987). The following protocol allows to demonstrate the antioxidant properties of compounds. Unless otherwise indicated, the reagents were from Sigma (St Quentin, France).<br>
LDL were prepared according to the method described by Lebeau et al. (Lebeau, Furman et al. 2000).<br>
The solutions of test compounds were prepared at 10~2 M concentration in bicarbonate buffer (pH 9) and diluted in PBS to obtain final concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 µM for a total ethanol concentration of 1 % (V/V).<br>
Prior to oxidation, EDTA was removed from the LDL preparation by dialysis. Oxidation then took place at 30°C by addition of 100 µl of 16.6 µlM CuS04 solution to 160 µL of LDL (125 µg protein/ml) and 20 µl of a test compound solution. The formation of dienes, the species under observation, was followed by measuring optical density at 234 nm in the samples treated with the<br>
compounds but in the presence or absence of copper. Optical density at 234 nm was measured every 10 minutes for 8 hours in a thermostated spectrophotometer (Tecan Ultra 380). The analyses were performed in triplicate. The compounds were considered to have antioxidant activity when they induced a longer lag phase and reduced the rate of oxidation and the amount of dienes formed in comparison with the control sample. The inventors demonstrate that the inventive compounds have at least one of the above-described antioxidant properties indicating that the inventive compounds have intrinsic antioxidant activity. Figures 1, 2 and 3 give an example of the results illustrating the antioxidant properties of compounds 2 and 5.<br>
Results are given in Figures 1-1,1-2, 1-3,1-4,1-5,1-6,1-7,1-8, 1-9,1-10,1-11, 1-12, 1-13 and 1-14 illustrating the antioxidant properties of inventive compounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38 and 41.<br>
2. Evaluation of protection conferred by the inventive compounds against lipid peroxidation:<br>
The inventive compounds which were tested are the compounds whose preparation is described in the above examples.<br>
LDL oxidation was determined by the TBARS method.<br>
According to the same principle described earlier, LDL were oxidized with CUSO4 and lipid peroxidation was determined as follows :<br>
TBARS were measured by a spectrophotometry method, lipid hydroperoxidation was measured using lipid-dependent peroxidation of iodide to iodine. The results are expressed as nmol of malondialdehyde (MDA) or as nmol of hydroperoxide/mg of protein.<br>
The previous results obtained by measuring inhibition of conjugated diene formation were confirmed by the experiments measuring LDL lipid peroxidation.<br>
The   inventive   compounds   also   effectively   protected   LDL   against   lipid peroxidation induced by copper (oxidizing agent).<br>
