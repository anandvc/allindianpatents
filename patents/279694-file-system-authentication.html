				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to file system authentication and, in particular, authentication of<br>
users for accessing files stored on a distributed or peer-to-peer file system.<br>
Distributed file systems have advantages over traditional centralised file systems including<br>
improved fault tolerance, availability, scalability and performance.<br>
A problem with known distributed file systems is that the anonymity of a user can be<br>
compromised because the user' s password is stored on a server on a network and is<br>
transmitted over the network after entry by the user. This provides an opportunity for the<br>
password to be intercepted and used for unauthorised access to the files distributed across the<br>
distributed file system.<br>
Another problem with known distributed file systems is that information about the location of<br>
files is stored on the network. This provides more opportunity for an unauthorised user to use<br>
the information to identify the location of files, or chunks of files, in order to gain<br>
unauthorised access to the files distributed across the peer-to-peer file system.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to preserve the anonymity of the users and to provide<br>
secure and private storage of data for users on a distributed file system.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of<br>
authenticating access to a distributed file system comprising the steps of;<br>
receiving a user identifier;<br>
retrieving an encrypted validation record identified by the user identifier;<br>
decrypting the encrypted validation record so as to provide decrypted information; and<br>
authenticating access to data in the distributed file system using the decrypted<br>
information.<br>
 <br>
Preferably the steps of receiving, retrieving and authenticating are performed on a node in the<br>
distributed file system separate from a node performing the step of decrypting.<br>
Preferably, the method further comprises the step of generating the user identifier using a<br>
hash.<br>
Therefore, the user identifier is unique and suitable for identifying unique validation records.<br>
Preferably, the step of authenticating access further comprises the step of digitally signing the<br>
user identifier.<br>
This provides authentication that can be validated against trusted authorities.<br>
Preferably, the method further comprises the slop of using the signed user identifier as a<br>
session passport to authenticate a plurality of accesses to the distributed file system.<br>
This allows persistence of the authentication for an extended session.<br>
Preferably, the step of decrypting comprises decrypting an address in the distributed file<br>
system of a first chunk of data and the step of authenticating access further comprises the step<br>
of determining the existence of the first chunk at the address.<br>
This efficiently combines the tasks of authentication and starting to retrieving the data from<br>
the system.<br>
Preferably, the method further comprises the step of using the content of the first chunk to<br>
obtain further chunks from the distributed file system.<br>
Therefore, there is no need to have a potentially vulnerable record of the file structure<br>
persisting in one place on the distributed file system, as the user' s node constructs its database<br>
of file locations after logging onto the system.<br>
 <br>
According to a second aspect of the present imention there is provided a distributed file<br>
system comprising;<br>
a storage module adapted to store an encrypted validation record;<br>
a client node comprising a decryption module adapted to decrypt an encrypted<br>
validation record so as to provide decrypted information: and<br>
a verifying node comprising :<br>
a receiving module adapted to receive a user identifier;<br>
a retrieving module adapted to retrieve from the storage module an encrypted<br>
validation record identified by the user identifier:<br>
a transmitting module adapted to transmit the encrypted validation record to<br>
the client node; and<br>
an authentication module adapted to authenticate access to data in the<br>
distributed file system using the decrypted information from the client node.<br>
Preferably, the client node is further adapted to generate the user identifier using a hash.<br>
Preferably, the authentication module is further adapted to authenticate access by digitally<br>
sign the user identifier.<br>
Preferably, the signed user identifier is used as a session passport to authenticate a plurality of<br>
accesses by the client node to the distributed file system.<br>
Preferably, the decryption module is further adapted to decrypt an address in the distributed<br>
file system of a first chunk of data from the validation record and the authentication module is<br>
 <br>
further adapted to authenticate access by determining the existence of the first chunk at the<br>
address.<br>
Preferably, the client node is further adapted to use the content of the first chunk to obtain<br>
further chunks from the distributed file system.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided at least one computer<br>
program comprising program instructions for causing at least one computer to perform the<br>
method according to the first aspect.<br>
Preferably the at least one computer program is embodied on a recording medium or read<br>
only memory, stored in at least one computer memory, or carried on an electrical carrier<br>
signal.<br>
The present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the<br>
accompanying figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates, in schematic form, a peer-to-peer network in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the invention; and<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a flow chart of the authentication, in accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, a peer-to-peer network 2 is shown with nodes 4 to 12 connected<br>
by a communication network 14. The nodes may be Personal Computers (PCs) or any other<br>
device that can perform the processing, communication and/or storage operations required to<br>
operate the invention. The file system will typically have many more nodes of all types than<br>
shown in Figure 1 and a PC may act as one or many types of node described herein. Data<br>
nodes 4 and 6 store chunks 16 of files in the distributed file system. The validation record<br>
node 8 has a storage module 18 for storing encn pled validation records identified by a user<br>
identifier.<br>
 <br>
The client node 10 has a module 20 for input and generation of user identifiers. It also has a<br>
decryption module 22 for decrypting an encnpted validation record so as to provide<br>
decrypted information, a database of chunk locations 24 and storage 26 for retrieved chunks<br>
and files assembled from the retrieved chunks.<br>
The verifying node 12 has a receiving module 28 for receiving a user identifier from the client<br>
node. The retrieving module 30 is configured to retrieve from the data node an encrypted<br>
validation record identified by the user identifier. Alternatively, in the preferred embodiment,<br>
the validation record node 8 is the same node as the verifying node 12, i.e. the storage module<br>
18 is part of the verifying node 12 (not as shown in Figure 1). The transmitting module 32<br>
sends the encrypted validation record to the client node. The authentication module 34<br>
authenticates access to chunks of data distributed across the data nodes using the decrypted<br>
information.<br>
With reference to Figure 2. a more detailed flow of the operation of the present invention is<br>
shown laid out on the diagram with the steps being performed at the User' s PC (client node)<br>
on the left 40, those of the verifying PC (node) in the centre 42 and those of the data PC<br>
(node) on the right 44.<br>
A login box is presented 46 that requires the user's email address (the same one used in the<br>
client node software installation and registration process) and the user's PIN number. If the<br>
user is a 'main user' then some details may alreach be stored on the PC. If the user is a visitor,<br>
then the login box appears.<br>
A content hashed number such as SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm), 160 bits in length, is created<br>
48 from these two items of data. This 'hash' is now known as the 'use ID Key', which at this<br>
point is classed as 'unverified' within the system.<br>
The software on the user's PC then combines this unverified User ID Key with a standard<br>
'hello' code element 50, to create 52 a 'hello. Packet'. This hello.packet is then transmitted<br>
with a timed validity on the Internet.<br>
 <br>
The hello, packet will be picked up by the first node (for this description, now called the<br>
verifying node') that recognises 54 the User ID Key element of the hello, packet as matching<br>
a stored, encrypted validation record file 56 that it has in its storage area. A login attempt<br>
monitoring system ensures a maximum of three responses. Upon to many attempts, the<br>
verifying PC creates a "black list" for transmission to peers. Optionally, an alert is returned to<br>
the user if a 'black list' entry is found and the user may be asked to proceed or perform a virus<br>
check.<br>
The verifying node then returns this encrypted validation record file to the user via the<br>
internet. The user's pass phrase 58 is requested by a dialog box 60, which then will allow<br>
decryption of this validation record file.<br>
When the validation record file is decrypted 62. the first data chunk details, including a<br>
'decrypted address', are extracted 64 and the user PC sends back a request 66 to the verifying<br>
node for it to initiate a query for the first 'file-chunk ID' at the 'decrypted address' that it has<br>
extracted from the decrypted validation record file.<br>
The verifying node then acts as a 'relay node and initiates a 'notify only" query for this 'file-<br>
chunk ID" at the 'decrypted address' .<br>
Given that some other node (for this embodiment, called the 'data node' ) has recognised 68<br>
this request and has sent back a valid Notification only' message 70 that a 'file-chunk ID'<br>
corresponding to the request sent by the verifying node does indeed exist, the verifying node<br>
then digitally signs 72 the initial User ID Key, which is then sent back to the user.<br>
On reception by the user 74, this verified User ID Key is used as the user's session passport.<br>
The user's PC proceeds to construct 76 the database of the file system as backed up by the<br>
user onto the network. This database describes the location of all chunks that make up the<br>
user' s file system.<br>
Further details of the embodiment will now be described. A 'proxy-controlled' handshake<br>
routine is employed through an encrypted point-to-point channel, to ensure only authorised<br>
 <br>
access by the legal owner to the system, then to the user's file storage database, then to the<br>
files therein. The handshaking check is initiated from the PC that a user logs on to (the 'User<br>
PC ) , by generating the Unverified encrypted hash' known as the 'User ID Key', this<br>
preferably being created from the user's registered email address and their PIN number. This<br>
'hash' is transmitted as a "hello, packet' on the Internet, to be picked up by any system that<br>
recognises the User ID as being associated with specific data that it holds. This PC then<br>
becomes the 'verifying PC and will initially act as the User PC's "gateway' into the system<br>
during the authentication process. The encrypted item of data held by the verifying PC will<br>
temporarily be used as a 'validation record" . it being directly associated with the user' s<br>
identity and holding the specific address of a number of data chunks belonging to the user and<br>
which are located elsewhere in the peer-to-peer distributed file system. This 'validation record'<br>
is returned to the User PC for decryption, with the expectation that only the legal user can<br>
supply the specific information that will allow its accurate decryption.<br>
After successful decryption, the User PC extracts the address and name of the first data chunk<br>
from the verification record and passes this back to the verifying PC with a request to check<br>
the existence of this 'data chunk' on the specifically addressed PC. On the event of a positive<br>
response from a 'data PC to this 'data access test'. the verifying PC signs the User ID Key and<br>
passes it back to the User PC. This action is notification to the User PC that the user can then<br>
proceed with full access rights to the system, whereupon the first action is to retrieve the<br>
user's personal database.<br>
It should be noted that in this embodiment, no communication is carried out via any nodes<br>
without an encrypted channel such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) or SSL (Secure Sockets<br>
Layer) being set up first. A peer talks to another peer via an encrypted channel and the other<br>
peer (proxy) requests the information (e.g. for some space to save information on or for the<br>
retrieval of a file). An encrypted link is formed between all peers at each end of<br>
communications and also through the proxy during the authentication process. This<br>
effectively bans snoopers from detecting who is talking to whom and also what is being sent<br>
or retrieved. The initial handshake for self authentication is also over an encrypted link.<br>
 <br>
Secure connection is provided via certificate passing nodes, in a manner that does not require<br>
intervention, with each node being validated by another, where any invalid event or data, for<br>
whatever reason (fraud detection, snooping from node or any invalid algorithms that catch the<br>
node) will invalidate the chain created by the node. This is all transparent to the user.<br>
Further modifications and improvements may be added without departing from the scope of<br>
the invention herein described.<br>
