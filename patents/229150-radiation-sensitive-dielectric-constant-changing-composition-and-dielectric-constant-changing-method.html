DESCRIPTION<br>
RADIATION SENSITIVE DIELECTRIC CONSTANT CHANGING COMPOSITION AND DIELECTRIC CONSTANT CHANGING METHOD<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a radiation sensitive dielectric constant changing composition, a method of forming a dielectric constant pattern, a dielectric constant pattern and a device having a dielectric constant pattern. More specifically; it relates to a novel radiation sensitive dielectric constant changing composition which can provide a dielectric constant pattern for use as an insulating material or a capacitor for circuit boards, a method of forming a dielectric constant pattern, a dielectric constant pattern and a device having a dielectric constant pattern.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Technical development for reducing the length of wiring, the dielectric constant of an interlayer film and the length of a gate is now under way in order to increase the speed of a semiconductor. The field of packaging technology for creating a system usable state while retaining the performance of a semiconductor is far behind the above development. Packaging structures are now being reviewed to catch up with the above development. For example, attempts are being made to reduce the length of wiring and the dielectric constant of an interlayer film in the field of packaging technology.<br>
In conventional packaging technology, the performance of a memory IC is maintained by placing a path capacitor or input/output capacitor near an IC terminal. However, there arises the need of placing these elements near an element to increase the speed, and studies on how to bring a passive<br><br>
element, which has been positioned away from an IC, as close to the IC as possible to reduce the length of wiring so as to increase the speed are now under way. As a result, attention is now paid to a substrate structure such as "embedded passive".<br>
In the above packaging technology, in order to form a distribution having a difference between two different dielectric constants, one material is first formed, followed by the deposition of another material having a different dielectric constant on the entire surface of the above material. Thereafter, an unrequired deposited portion is removed by etching after patterning with a photosensitive material. Since this method has a large number of steps and the obtained film is apt to greatly vary in thickness, a material which provides a film having high uniformity in thickness is desirably used as the material on which another material is deposited.<br>
As the integration becomes higher, a lower dielectric constant material is needed for an interlayer insulating film used to prevent a delay caused by cross talk between wirings in the assembly of a highly intergrated circuit. To this end, studies on the reduction of dielectric constant using organic and inorganic materials are now under way. As one of the studies, the reduction of dielectric constant using porous materials has been .reported in Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc, Vol. 511, 105 (1998); Electrochemical and Solid-State letters. Vol. 2, 77 (1999); Proc. DUMIC Santa Clara, 25 (1998); collection of drafts for the 61st lecture meeting of the Applied Physics Society, 4a-P4-20 (2000); collection of drafts for the 61st lecture meeting of the Applied Physics Society, 4a-P4-27 (2000); Proc. of the 2000 IITC, 143 (2000) and the like. A reduction in density by using a porous material makes it possible to form a film having a dielectric constant of 2 or less. However, since a reduction in the<br><br>
density of a film has a direct influence on the reduction of the strength of the film although it reduces the dielectric constant of the film, the development of an interlayer insulating film having higher strength than a conventional interlayer insulating film is desired.<br>
Meanwhile, studies on the reduction of the capacity of wiring by employing a hollow structure containing air which has the lowest dielectric constant as the structure of a highly integrated circuit have been reported by JP-A 63-268254 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application"); Microprocessor report, Aug. 4, 14 (1997); Symp. On VLSI Technology, 82 (1996); DUMIC Conference, 139 (1997); IEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol. 19, No. 1, 16 (1998) and the like. However, this hollow structure involves many problems in its process, for example, extremely high accuracy required for assembly and therefore is not implemented yet.<br>

In the present invention, a dielectric constant pattern can be formed from the above dielectric constant changing composition as follows, for example.<br>
First, the dielectric constant changing composition is dissolved or dispersed in a solvent to prepare a composition solution having a solid content of 5 to 70 wt%. The composition solution may be filtered with a filter having an opening diameter of about 0.1 to 10 p as required before use.<br>
Thereafter, this composition solution is applied to the surface of a substrate such as a silicon wafer and prebaked to remove the solvent so as to form the coating film of the dielectric constant changing composition. Part of the formed coating film is then exposed to radiation through a pattern mask and heated to form pores in the exposed portion of the coating film and solidify the film so as to produce a dielectric constant difference between the exposed and unexposed portions of the dielectric constant changing<br><br>
composition.<br>
An acid or base is formed from the radiation sensitive decomposer (C) by the above exposure to act on the component (A) to decompose it. When this decomposed product is gaseous at normal temperature, it dissipates at the time of heating after exposure to form pores.<br>
When the decomposed product is liquid or solid at normal temperature, it is vaporized or sublimated as a gas by heating at a temperature raised at the time of heating to be dissipated so as to form pores, or only the decomposed product is extracted to form pores. As a result, there is produced a dielectric constant difference between the exposed and unexposed portions.<br>
When the component (D) to be reacted with the residual component (A) which did not react with an acid or base is not existent at the time of heating, heating is further carried out to decompose the residual component (A). Heating is preferably carried out in such a manner that pores are not formed by the decomposed product.<br>
When the component (D)is existent at the time of heating, the residual component (A) which did not react with the acid or base reacts with the component (D) to stabilize the formed dielectric constant pattern.<br>
The solvent used to prepare a solution containing the dielectric constant changing composition used in the present invention uniformly dissolves the above components (A), (B) and (C), the optionally added component (D) and other additives and does not react with these components.<br>

The dielectric constant changing composition used in<br><br>
the present invention is formed into various shapes in consideration of application purpose before exposure to radiation. For example, it is formed like a rod, fiber, long board, sphere, film or lens and the present invention is not limited to these. A commonly used molding technique may be used, as exemplified by injection molding, compression molding, blow molding, extrusion, in-case frame polymerization, shaving, drawing, heating/cooling, CVD deposition, sintering and scanning.  Spin coating, slitting, bar coating, solvent casting, LB, spraying, roll coating, relief-printing or screen printing may also be used according to the application purpose of an optically molded product.<br>
In this molding process, heating (to be referred to as "prebaking" hereinafter) is preferably carried out. The heating condition which changes according to the composition of the material of the present invention and the type of each additive is preferably 30 to 200°C, more preferably 40 to 150° C. A hot plate or oven, or infrared radiation may be used for heating.<br>
The radiation used for exposure is an i-line having a wavelength of 365 nm, h-llne having a wavelength of 404 nm, g-line having a wavelength of 436 nm, ultraviolet radiation from a wide-range wavelength light source such as a xenon lamp, far ultraviolet radiation such as KrF excimer laser beam having a wavelength of 248 nm or ArF excimer laser beam having a wavelength of 193 nm, X-radiation such as synchrotron radiation, charged corpuscular beam such as electron beam, visible radiation or a mixture thereof. Out of these, ultraviolet radiation and visible radiation are preferred. The illuminance which depends on the wavelength of the radiation is preferably 0.1 to 100 mW/cm2 because the highest reaction efficiency is obtained. The projection of the radiation through a pattern mask makes possible the patterning of the radiation sensitive dielectric constant<br><br>
ihanging material. As for patterning accuracy which is effected by a light source used, a dielectric constant lattern having a dielectric constant variation distribution rith a resolution of about 0.2 pm can be produced.<br>
In the present invention, heating (to be referred to LS "post-exposure baking (PEB)") is preferably carried out Lfter exposure.  A similar device to the above prebaking Levice may be used for PEB and PEB conditions may be arbitrary. 'he heating temperature is preferably 30 to 150°C, more preferably 30 to 130°C. Heating is preferably carried out for stabilization, that is, a reaction between the residual :omponent (A) and the component (D) successively after &gt;ost-exposure baking or separately. The heating temperature lor stabilization is preferably 35 to 200° C, more preferably i temperature 10° C or more higher than the PEB temperature, :iuch more preferably a temperature 20° C or more higher than :he PEB temperature.<br>
Further, re-exposure may be carried out to decompose :he residual component (C) existent in the unexposed portion ind further improve the stability of the material.<br>
The re-exposure may be carried out by applying radiation having the same wavelength as the radiation used :o change the dielectric constant to the entire surface of :he pattern in the same amount.<br>
Optionally, heating may be further carried out to further improve the stability of the material. A similar levice to the prebaking device used at the time of molding :he material may be used for heating and the heating conditions may be arbitrary.<br>
According to the present invention, the method of forming a dielectric constant pattern of the present Lnvention may also be carried out by exposing a dielectric constant changing composition comprising the above components (A), (B) and (C) to radiation through a pattern<br><br>
mask and then treating it with the stabilizer (D).<br>
The treatment with the stabilizer (D) is preferably carried out after post-exposure baking.<br>
The stabilizer (D) has the function of stabilizing the residual decomposable compound (A) contained in the dielectric constant changing material after exposure to provide stability to an acid or base. This stabilization prevents a change in dielectric constant and hence the deterioration of a dielectric constant pattern formed by the method of the present invention even when it is used under the condition that light having a wavelength close to the wavelength used to change the dielectric constant passes therethrough.<br>
Besides the above examples, a low-boiling compound such as ammonia or triethylamine may be used as the stabilizer (D).<br>
For contact between the dielectric constant changing material after exposure to radiation and the stabilizer (D) for stabilization, a suitable method may be employed. For instance, the component (D) and optionally a catalyst are dissolved in a suitable solvent to be contacted to the dielectric constant changing material as a solution. Alternatively, when the component (D) is liquid or gaseous under contact conditions, it may be 100 % directly contacted to the dielectric constant changing material.<br>
When a solvent is used in the reaction between the above stabilizer (D) and the component (A), the solvent preferably dissolves the component (D) and an optionally added catalyst and does not dissolve the component (A) . If the above solvent is selected, the surface of the obtained dielectric constant pattern will not be roughened.<br>

Further, re-exposure may be carried out to decompose the residual component (C) existent in the unexposed portion and further improve the stability of the material.<br>

Further, according to the present invention, the dielectric constant pattern forming method of the present invention may also be carried out by exposing a dielectric constant changing composition comprising the above components (A), (B) and (C) to radiation through a pattern and heating it to decompose the decomposable compound in the unexposed portion.<br>
The above heating is preferably carried out at a temperature 10° C or more higher than the post-exposure baking temperature, for example, 170°C or higher, more preferably 200° C or higher.<br>
The residual decomposable compound (A) existent in the unexposed portion is decomposed or sublimated by heating to be removed but it preferably does not form pores substantially.<br>

As described above, the composition of the present invention is formed into a film and a pattern consisting of a plurality of regions having different dielectric constants can be formed. Therefore, when a film whose necessary portion has a low dielectric constant is used as an insulating material for a circuit board, the strength of the film can be greatly made higher than a conventional organic insulating material having a low dielectric constant and pores on whole of the film.<br>
The composition of the present invention can be suitably used as an interlayer insulating film between multi-layer wiring patterns.<br>
Further, the dielectric constant pattern formed from the composition of the present invention can be used as a capacitor and also as an input/output capacitor or path capacitor to be mounted on an LSI having built-in passive<br><br>
elements or a substrate having built-in passive elements. When the composition of the present invention is used as a capacitor, the capacitor can be made lighter and thinner than a capacitor made from a conventionally known material and can have a desired shape, thereby making it possible to increase the capacity per volume and the degree of freedom in the design of an array when passive elements are disposed in an array.<br>
