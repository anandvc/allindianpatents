This invention relates to novel compounds of benzofuroxan series_and to their use in therapeutics. In particular the invention concerns novel benzofuroxan derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and their use as tolerance resistant nitric oxide donors in treatment,of angina_pectoris. In addition the invention also relates to the use of other carefully chosen derivatives of benzofuroxan series showing tolerance resistance activity as nitric oxide donors and to their pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and formulations.<br>
This application is divided out of Indian Patent Application No. 462/CAL/99 filed on 18th May, 1999.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
After the discovery of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) by Furchgott et al (1980), and the elucidation of the biochemistry of EDRF by a number of laboratories (Ignarro, 1989; Vane et al, 1990; Bassenge et al, 1988; and Vanhoutte, 1989), it is now widely accepted that EDRF is the endogenous nitrovasodilator, nitric oxide (NO) donor. The organic nitrates and related compounds owe their pharmacological action to the release of nitric oxide (NO) and these compounds are collectively called<br>
nitrovasodilators. NO stimulates the guanylate cyclase enzyme in vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in increased levels<br><br>
- 2A -<br>
of cyclic GMP. This leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chain which results in relaxation of smooth muscles (Murad, 1986). NO is known to be involved in a number of bio-<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
regulatory processes like, vasodilatation, platelet deaggregation, vascular smooth .muscle proliferation, etc.<br>
Organic nitrates are used in prophylaxis, treatment and management of patients with angina pectoris. These are also useful in congestive heart failure associated with acute myocardial infarction, hypertension associated with surgical procedures and to produce controlled hypotension during surgical procedures. Among organic nitrates, nitroglycerine (sublingual) which is currently in use, is the drug of choice for immediate relief of anginal symptoms. Prophylactic treatment of stable angina pectoris involves the use of one or more drugs such as long acting nitrates like isosorbide dinitrate, a beta-blocker and/or a calcium channel antagonist, particularly in patients likely to experience coronary spasm. In some cases this triple therapy satisfactorily control angina. They are quite effective in the treatment of these conditions when used intermittently.<br>
Frequently repeated use of nitrates result in decrease in their pharmacological effects, a phenomenon well recognized as nitrate tolerance. The mechanism of tolerance is not well defined. As early as 1973, Needleman and Johnson (1973) have reported that tolerance to nitroglycerine could occur in isolated rabbit arteries. It was hypothesized by them that depletion of sulphydryl groups was associated with the development of tolerance to nitroglycerine. This is a major problem in the clinical use of organic nitrates (Frampton et al, 1992). Currently, the development of<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
tolerance is reduced by the use of intermittent dosing schedule with a nitrate-free interval of 10-12 hrs. However, this intermittent use is associated with decreased exercise tolerance during the last part of nitrate-free interval. This suggests possibility of increased frequency of or severity of angina during nitrate-free interval. The importance of development of tolerance has increased as these drugs are used more commonly in various dosage forms like oral, transdermal, and intravenous preparations and even as sustained-release preparations. Several indirect indices like exercise duration, systemic blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary artery wedge pressure has been used to assess tolerance to organic nitrates. However, it is not clear whether decreased response to nitrates is due to tolerance of the vascular smooth muscle cells or changes in regulatory factors like activation of neurohumoral factors or fluid retention etc. (Armstrong and Moffat, 1983 ). Irrespective of the mechanisms of tolerance development, clinically it is important to develop nitric oxide donors with least tendency to develop tolerance.<br>
P B Ghosh et al. (Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1968) disclosed the method of synthesis of various benzo -2,1,3-oxadiazoles (benzofurazans) and their N-oxides (benzofuroxans) and their potential as antileukemic and immuno-suppressive drugs in vitro.<br>
P B Ghosh et al. (Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1972) tested 4- nitrobenzofurazans and 4- nitrobenzofuroxans<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
bearing electron withdrawing substitutents in the 5 and 6 position (relative to NO2) as potential antileukemic and immuno suppressive drugs in vitro.<br>
Nishikawa et al. (The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1982) disclosed effect of N-ethoxycarbonyl -3- morpholinosydnonimine and its metabolites 3- morpholinosydnonimine, cyanomethyleneamino morpholine, N-nitroso -N-morpholinoamino acetonitrile as novel antianginal agents.<br>
F. Murad (J. Clin. Invest, 1986) disclosed cyclic guanosine monophosphate as a mediator of vasodilation.<br>
James Frampton et al. (Drug Evaluation, Adis International Limited, 1992) give a review of pharmacology and therapeutic efficiency of nicorandil in angina pectoris. Nicorandil, which has both vasodilator and venodilating properties was found to offer an effective  alternative to established vasodilator therapy with conventional nitrates and calcium antagonists in the long term treatment of stable angina pectoris.<br>
U S Patent No.5,272,164 disclosed novel carboximidamide derivatives particularly N-cyano-N1 -substituted pyridine carboximidamide derivatives having vasodilating effect and hypotensive effect besides other physiological effects which are helpful in treatment of ischemic heart diseases.<br>
U S Patent 5,424,326 disclosed phenyl -1,2,5- oxadiazole carboxamide -2- oxide and its derivatives, which are useful for the treatment of disorders of the cardiovascular system.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
F Benedini et. al. (J. Med. Chem. 1995) disclosed a new nitro ester -3- [ (nitroxy) alkyl] -2H- 1,3- b&amp;nzoxazin-4(3H)- ones showing marked inhibitory activity against ischemia-induced electrocardiographic changes, with only limited systemic hemodynamic effects. These nevf nitro ester derivatives, endowed with marked anti-anginal activity, which is not associated with concurrent and pronounced fall in systemic blood pressure, are indicative of a new class of selective nitrovasodilators having a preferential action on large coronary vessels, which could be clinically relevant in the treatment of coronary artery diseases.<br>
However, none of the above prior art disclosures on the drugs specifically used as vasodilator for treatment of cardiac ailments tackles the problem associated with the conventional NO-donors to develop tolerance in the patient after continuous use for a period of time. Significantly, the invention identifies the molecules showing vasodilator activity without tendency to develop tolerance unlike the conventional nitric-oxide donors. The molecules identified by this invention are either novel or their NO donor activities were hitherto unknown.<br>

The compounds according to this invention as given by general formula I or II and their salts or complexes can be administered orally, intravenously or parenterally as a pharmaceutical preparation in liquid or solid form. It may also be administered via topical, transdermal, sublingual, buccal or rectal route for example as a suppository, ointment, cream, powder, transdermal patch, metered aerosol or spray. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers present in the composition of this invention are materials recommended for the purpose of administering the medicament. These may be liquid or solid materials, which are otherwise inert or medically acceptable and are compatible with the active ingredients.<br>
EVALUATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY: Methods:<br>
a) In vitro Screening of NO Donors<br>
The method adopted was a modified method of Nishikawa et al (1982). Albino rabbits of either sex were stunned and exsanguinated. Thoracic aorta was quickly removed and cut helically (at an angle of 45°) into strips 4-5 mm wide and 25 to 30 mm long, after removal of adventitial connective tissue. The endothelium was rubbed off gently using a cotton swab soaked in Kreb's solution. Two strips were fixed vertically in organ baths containing 20 ml. Kreb's solution maintained at 37°C and bubbled with oxygen. A resting tension of 4 g was applied and the preparation was allowed to<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
equilibrate for 30 min. Each preparation was exposed to two primer doses of KC1 (30mM). After the contraction reached a maximum, the bath was drained off and replaced with fresh Kreb1s solution. Half an hour later, cumulative dose response curve for the test compound was taken on one tissue (test) and for glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in the other (standard). The dose range used was from 10~9 M to 10~3 M with a contact period of 4 min. for each dose. After the maximum relaxation was achieved with the last dose, papaverine (10-" M) was added to obtain the maximum relaxation.<br>
Tolerance was induced in both the tissues by adding 440 uM of GTN for 90 minutes. During this period the bath solution was changed every 30 min. and 440 uM of GTN was replaced. Later both the tissues were washed thoroughly and the dose response curve (DRC) for both the test compounds and the standard were repeated. The percentage relaxation with individual doses was calculated by taking the maximum relaxations to 10~4 M papaverine as 100% relaxation. A graph was plotted by taking the percentage relaxation vs the log (M) concentration of the compounds. The relaxant activity of the test compounds was assessed by calculating the mean relative potencies (MRP) and the mean activity ratio (MAR), both before and after tolerance, as defined below:<br>
Concentration of GTN producing 50% of its<br>
maximum relaxation<br>
MRP =   	<br>
Concentration of test compound producing 50% of the maximum relaxation of GTN.<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
Maximum relaxation produced by the test compound<br>
¦i MAR =   	<br>
.Maximum relaxation produced by GTN<br>
Selection criteria for in vivo study: Compounds having MRP greater than 3 and MAR greater than 1.3 after tolerance were selected for in vivo study. Dose response curves for compounds 8 and 16 are given in Figs.1-4 of the accompanying drawings as an example for the estimation of MRP and MAR. b)   In vivo Pharmacological Screening:<br>
A modified method of Benedini et al (1995) was adopted for studying the anti-anginal effect of the chosen compounds. Guinea pigs of either sex, weighing approximately 400-600 g were used for this study. Animals were anesthetized with urethane (1.25 g/kg, i.p.) and jugular vein was cannulated for intravenous administration of drugs/vehicle. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was monitored by a cannula inserted into the right carotid artery and connected to a pressure transducer. Standard limb lead II electrocardiogram was recorded continuously. All the recordings were carried out on a MacLab system (AD Instruments, UK).<br>
The ability of the test compounds to suppress the vasopressin induced T-wave elevation was used as the model for studying the anti-anginal effects of the compounds. Guinea pigs were divided into two groups for the purpose of this study, i) control group (pretreated with the vehicle for the compound) and ii) drug treated group. i)   Control Group<br>
In this group of animals the solvent used for dissolving<br><br>
the test compound was administered intravenously in a volume 4 of 1 ml/kg. The basal T-wave heights, heart ra,tes and MABP and changes after vehicle administration were rioted. Thirty seconds later 1 I.U./ml/kg of vasopressin was administered intravenously. The T-wave heights, heart rates and MABP and their changes after vasopressin administration were also noted. The T-wave elevation (after vasop res sin-administration) , maximum rise in MABP, and changes in heart rate were calculated from the above data and expressed as mean ± standard deviation. ii)  Drug treated group<br>
The effects of the test compound in suppressing the T-wave elevation caused by vasopressin were evaluated with atleast three dose levels. Groups of 6 guinea pigs were used for each dose. The test compound was injected 30 seconds prior to vasopressin administration. Changes in MABP, heart rate and T-waves were recorded as described for the control group. The percentage inhibition of vasopressin induced T-wave elevation was calculated for each dose taking the T-wave height estimated in control group as 100%. From the dose vs percent inhibition relationship, the dose required for 50% inhibition (EDso) for the T-wave elevation was estimated. Determination of the EDzo values for drop in MABP<br>
In a separate group of animals the drop in MABP after administration of the test compound (dose range of 0.1 - 1000 ug/kg, i.v.) was studied. Atleast three animals were used for each dose. Care was taken so that the doses were given only<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
after the MABP had stabilized from the effects of the previous dose. All doses were injected in a final volume of 1 ml/kg. The drop in MABP was noted for increasing concentrations of the test compound and a dose response curve was drawn. From this graph the dose required to produce a 20% fall in MABP (ED20) was calculated.<br>
The specificity of the test compound was defined by the selectivity index, which was calculated as shown below:<br><br>
Selectivity Index<br><br>
Dose required for 20% reduction in MABP (ug/kg)<br>
Dose required for 50% inhibition of T-wave elevation (ug/kg.)<br><br>
Compounds having selectivity ratio greater than 30 times that of GTN were selected for initial toxicology evaluation. The selectivity index for GTN was estimated to be 0.017, RESULTS OF IN VITRO Screening of NO Donors:<br>
The results of in vitro screening of the NO donors are given in the following Table 3. Compounds 1,2,3,5,6,7,8.9 and 10 amongst the novel molecules and compounds 14,15,16,21 and 22 amongst the known molecules were found to be the suitable compounds for both potency and activity and hence, the selectivity of their action was studied in vivo.

It was observed that compounds have a high selectivity index as compared to GTN.. In the case of compounds 5, 8 and 9 amongst the novel molecules and compound 16 amongst the known molecule the index is significantly higher. The index showed that these compounds could elicit anti-anginal activity at a dose, which has minimum systemic effect. Their selectivity in dilating coronary arteries was quite high as compared to a conventional drug like GTN.<br>
The high selectivity index of these compounds as compared to nitroglycerine show that they selectively dilate the coronary arteries and have a lower tendency to cause hypotension during clinical usage. For example, the compound with lowest selectivity index, compound 15 is 22 times more selective as compared to GTN. This shows that these compounds have very little tendency to cause hypotension.<br><br>

Conventional nitrates like GTN cause tachycardia, retrosternal discomfort, palpitations, collapse, syncope and postural hypotension, etc. as a manifestation of hypotensive effect. This could limit their use in selected patients. However, the compounds described in this invention due to a lower tendency to cause hypotension are superior to conventional nitrates.<br>
The benzofuroxans described in this invention can be used in cardiovascular disorders like acute effort angina, angina prophylaxis, mixed angina and silent ischemia, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, etc. They can be used alone or in combination. They could be combined with beta adrenergic blockers like propranolol, atenolol, carvedilol, etc. and calcium channel antagonists ]ike verapamil, diltiazem, etc.<br>
