Fungicidal mixtures based on carbamate derivatives and insecticides The present invention relates to mixtures comprising as active components a)      carbamate derivatives of the formula I<br><br>
in which the substituents and the index have the following meaning: T is CH or N n is 0, 1 or 2<br>
R is halogen, C1-C4-alkyl or C1-C4haloalkyl, it being possible for the radicals R to be different when n is 2,<br>
and . b)      at least one compound of the formula II<br><br>
in which R1 is C1-C4-alkyl or C1-C4-haloalkyl.<br>
The combating of harmful phytopathogenic fungi is in many regions not the only problem the farmer has to face. Also harmful insects can cause a great damage to crops and other plants.<br><br>
Thus, an efficient combination of fungicidal and insecticidal activity is desirable to overcome this problem.<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a mixture which, on the one hand, has good fungicida! activity, and, on the other hand, good insecticidal activity, resulting in a broader pesticidal spectrum of action. More particularly, the subject of the present invention is a mixture for protecting plants against diseases and insects, characterized in that it comprises an effective amount of a fungicide and at least an effective amount of an insecticide. Furthermore it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for treating plants using these mixtures.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a mixture comprising as active components<br>
a)	carbamate derivatives of the formula I<br><br>
I in which the substituents and the index have the following meaning:<br>
T is CH or N n is 0, 1 or 2<br>
R is halogen, C1-C44-alkyl or C1-C4-haloalkyl, it being possible for the radicals R to be different when n is 2,<br>
and<br>
b)	at least one compound of the formula II<br><br><br>
II<br>
in which R1 is C1-C4-alkyl or C1-C4-haloalkyl. Furthermore we have found a process for treating plants using these mixtures.<br>
The compounds of the formula I, their preparation and their action against harmful fungi have been disclosed in the literature (WO-A 96/01256 and WO-A 96/01258).<br>
The compounds II, their preparation and their action against harmful insects has also been disclosed (EP 295 117).<br>
Preferably, the compounds of formula I represent carbamate derivatives in which the combination of the substituents corresponds to one line of table 1 which follows:<br>
Table 1:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
More preferred are compounds 1.12,1.23,1.32 and 1.38, particularly preferred is compound 1.32.<br>
The compounds of formula II represent phenylpyrazoles, in which Ri is C1-C44-alkyl or C1-C4-haloalkyl, preferably ethyl (common name: ethiprole) or trifluormethyl (common name: fipronil), more preferably trifluormethyl.<br>
The compounds of formulae I and II are capable of forming salts or adducts with inorganic or organic acids or with metal ions.<br>
Examples of inorganic acids are hydrohalic acids, such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid.<br>
Suitable organic acids are, for example, formic acid, carbonic acid and alkanoic acids, such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and propionic acid, and also glycolic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, oxalic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, 2-phenoxybenzoic acid or 2-acetoxybenzoic acid.<br>
Suitable metal ions are in particular the ions of the elements of the first to eighth transition group, especially chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, and additionally those of the second main group, especially calcium and magnesium, and of the third and fourth main group, in particular aluminum, tin and lead. If appropriate, the metals can be present in the different valencies that they can assume.<br>
When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the substantially pure, especially the pure active compounds of formulae I and II, to which further active ingredients against harmful fungi or against other pests, such as insects or nematodes, can be added. Thus, a further active ingredient can be optionally added, for example at least one additional insecticide or fungicide, preferably an additional fungicide.<br>

The following are examples of formulations: 1. Products for dilution with water<br>
A)	Water-soluble concentrates (SL, LS)<br>
10 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in water or in a water-soluble solvent. As an alternative, wetters or other auxiliaries are added. The active compound dissolves upon dilution with water.<br>
B)	Dispersible concentrates (DC)<br>
20 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in cyclohexanone with addition of a dispersant, for example polyvinylpyrrolidone. Dilution with water gives a dispersion.<br>
C)	Emulsifiable concentrates (EC)<br>
15 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in xylene with addition of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil ethoxylate (in each case 5% strength). Dilution with water gives an emulsion.<br>
D)	Emulsions (EW, EO, ES)<br><br>
40 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in xylene with addition of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil ethoxylate (in each case 5% strength).

The use forms depend entirely on the intended purposes; it is intended to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of a wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and such concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The active compound concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from 0.01 to 1%.<br>
