				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and<br>
apparatus for the production of metal and metal compounds<br>
and, particularly, but not exclusively, to a method and<br>
apparatus for production of titanium-based alloys and<br>
intermetallic complexes, and more particularly, but not<br>
exclusively, to a method and apparatus for the production<br>
of titanium-aluminium based alloys and intermetallic<br>
complexes, and more particularly, but not exclusively, to<br>
a method and apparatus for the production of titanium-<br>
aluminium based alloys and intermetallic complexes in a<br>
powder form.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Titanium-aluminium alloys and inter-metallic<br>
compounds (generically termed herein "titanium-aluminium<br>
compounds") are very valuable materials. However, they<br>
are difficult and expensive to prepare, particularly in<br>
the preferred powder form. This expense of preparation<br>
limits wide use of these materials, even though they have<br>
highly desirable properties for use in automotive,<br>
aerospace and other industries.<br>
Titanium minerals are found in nature in the form of<br>
a very stable oxide (TiO2) . Common processes for the<br>
production of ' titanium are the Kroll process and the<br>
Hunter process. The Kroll process requires the use of<br>
magnesium as a reducing agent to reduce TiCl4 (prepared<br>
from the oxide by a pre-process of chlorination) to<br>
produce the Ti metal. The Hunter process requires the use<br>
of sodium as the reducing agent. Because TiCl4 is still<br>
thermodynamically stable, highly reactive reducing agents<br>
such as magnesium or sodium are required to produce<br>
titanium metal out of TiCl4. Such highly reactive reducing<br>
agents are difficult and expensive to handle. As the<br>
magnesium chlorides in the case of the Kroll process are<br>
stable up to temperatures in excess of 130OK, the product<br>
is often in the form of a Ti sponge mixed with MgCl2 and<br>
remnants of Mg and TiCl2. To obtain pure Ti, the product<br>
requires extensive post-processing, including washing and<br>
melting in a vacuum arc furnace to remove all impurities.<br>
This contributes to the present high cost of the<br>
production of titanium.<br>
In the known technologies for production of titanium<br>
alloys such as Ti-Al-V, and intermetallic compounds such<br>
as Ti3Al, TiAl, TiAl3, Ti-Al- (Cr, Hb, Mo, etc) and alloys<br>
based on these compounds, appropriate amounts of sponges,<br>
ingots or powders of the metals which comprise these<br>
alloys are milled or melted together and annealed, hence<br>
adding to the production cost, particularly as it is<br>
necessary to obtain the metals first which, as discussed,<br>
in the case of titanium, involves considerable expense.<br>
For production of a powder of these titanium alloys and<br>
intermetallic compounds, further processing is usually<br>
required, adding to the already high production cost.<br>
Prior Al-based processes for manufacturing of Ti-Al<br>
compounds include starting from Al powder and Ti powder<br>
(references: (I.Lu, M.O. Lai and F.H. Froes, Journal of<br>
Metals, February 2002, p62) and (N. Bertolino et al..<br>
Intermetallies, Vol 11, 2003, p 41} and reduction of TiCl4<br>
with A1C1 {US patent application US2002/0184 971 Al). For<br>
the first process, the starting materials are Al and Ti<br>
powders, the powders usually being mechanically milled to<br>
make a uniform mixture followed by heating in a furnace.<br>
The resulting materials are at best in the form of solid<br>
lumps and this process is usually unable to produce fine<br>
powder. Furthermore, the resulting compounds often<br>
require heat treatment to produce the required material<br>
properties. For the second process, Al metal is heated in<br>
the presence of chlorine at temperature around 1200C to<br>
produce gaseous AlCl that is then reacted with TiCl4 in the<br>
gas phase to produce powders of titanium aluminides. Both<br>
these processes are quite complex and costly to operate.<br>
It is also known to perform direct reduction of TiCl4<br>
with aluminium. However, this results in the production<br>
of an uncontrollable composition of compounds and<br>
production of a single phase material such as TiAl has not<br>
been achieved (see in particular S J Gerdemann &amp; D E<br>
Alman, page 3341 in Gamma Titanium Alumini 1999, edited by-<br>
Kim, Dimiduk &amp; Loretto, The Minerals Metals and Materials<br>
Society USA) -<br>
Over the past several decades, there have been<br>
extensive attempts made to replace the existing Kroll and<br>
Hunter technologies using techniques such as<br>
electrowinning, plasma-hydrogen and also aluminothermic<br>
reduction.<br>
The use of hydrogen plasma for the reduction of<br>
titanium chloride in a plasma atmosphere is difficult due<br>
to unfavourable thermodynatnic characteristics, since<br>
chlorine preferably reacts with titanium in the reverse<br>
reaction to produce titanium chlorides, hence degrading<br>
the quality of the produced Ti powder and.limiting the<br>
efficiency of the method. In a process disclosed in US<br>
Patent 5,935,293, a fast quench reactor was used to cool<br>
down the plasma in order to prevent recombination<br>
processes leading to formation of titanium chlorides.<br>
According to the description in US Patent 5,935,293, the<br>
process is highly energy expensive relative to the<br>
existing Kroll technology.<br>
In another process (G.Z. Chen, D.J. Fray and T.Vf.<br>
Farthing, Nature, Vol 407, (2000), 361), Chen et al. made<br>
titanium sponge directly from the oxide by reduction in a<br>
molten calcium chloride salt. Oxygen from the titanium<br>
oxide recombines with carbon at an anode to form CO2.<br>
However, the composition of the resulting sponge-like<br>
titanium product produced corresponds to the composition<br>
of the starting minerals. The process is still under<br>
development and is yet to be demonstrated on an industrial<br>
scale.<br>
Attempts have been made to uBe aluminium as a<br>
reducing agent for TiCl4 in plasma systems. For reduction<br>
of TiCl* using aluminium, the products are in the form of<br>
solid phase titanium-aluminium intermetallic compounds<br>
mixed with aluminium chloride and some residual titanium<br>
dichloride. A description of various attempts using<br>
aluminium together with a description of the<br>
thermodynamics of the process are given by Murphy and Bing<br>
{High Temp. Chem. Processes, Vol 3, 365-374, 1994).<br>
Because of difficulties associated with gas phase<br>
reactions it has not been possible to produce titanium<br>
and/or titanium-aluminium compounds by direct<br>
aluminothermic reduction of titanium chlorides.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with a first aspect, the present<br>
invention provides a etepwise method of producing<br>
titanium-aluminium compounds, comprising a first step oft<br>
- reducing an amount of titanium chloride (TiCl*)<br>
with an amount of aluminium at a temperature to<br>
trigger reactions to form titanium subchloride(s)<br>
and aluminium chloride (AlCl3) products;<br>
and then a second step of:<br>
- mixing said products, with the addition of more<br>
aluminium if required, and heating the mixture in<br>
a reaction zone to a temperature above 3 00C to<br>
form AICI3 in a gas phase, and to produce an end<br>
product in the reaction zone of the titanium-<br>
altmiinium compounds.<br>
When the term titanium subchloride is used, it can.<br>
refer to titanium trichloride TiCl3 and/or titanium<br>
dichloride TiClj or other combinations of titanium and<br>
chloride excluding. TiCl4 which is referred to herein as<br>
titanium chloride.<br>
When the term titanium compound is used, it can refer<br>
to titanium alloyB and/or titanium/metal intermetallic<br>
compounds. In one preferred form which is referred to<br>
herein, the titanium compounds include titanium-aluminium<br>
alloys and/or titanium-aluminium intermetallic compounds.<br>
In one embodiment, the method can also comprises the<br>
step of driving the removal of A1C13 away from the reaction<br>
zone to favour a forward reaction in the second step. In<br>
one form, the step of removing the A1C13 from the reaction<br>
zone is continuous-<br>
In one embodiment, the first step can be conducted at<br>
a temperature above the boiling point of AlCla. In<br>
another embodiment, the first step can be conducted at a<br>
temperature above 200C,<br>
In one embodiment of the method, the first step can<br>
be conducted with an excess amount of aluminium present to<br>
reduce all of the titanium chloride (TICI4) to form said<br>
titanium subchloride(s) and aluminium chloride (AICI3)<br>
products. In one embodiment, TMCI3 is prepared by the<br>
reduction of T1C1.4, although this reaction may also form<br>
titanium dichloride TiCla.<br>
In one embodiment of the method, the second step can<br>
be conducted at a temperature in the range 300C to 1000C.<br>
One embodiment of the method can comprise the further<br>
step of recycling at least some o£ the aluminium chloride<br>
formed, and utilising the aluminium chloride to produce<br>
Tid.4. The aluminium chloride can be used to reduce<br>
titanium oxide to produce TiCl4.<br>
In any of the embodiments of the method mentioned,<br>
aluminium oxide can be produced by the reduction of<br>
titanium oxide and the aluminium oxide electrolysed to<br>
produce aluminium raw material for use in the steps of<br>
said method.<br>
1<br>
In one embodiment of the method, the aluminium<br>
chlorides can be condensed away from the reaction zone at<br>
a temperature lower than that in the reaction zone. In<br>
one embodiment of the method, if titanium subchloride<br>
escapee the reaction zone it can be condensed at a<br>
temperature different to that in the reaction zone.<br>
Furthermore the condensed titanium subchloride can<br>
optionally be returned to the reaction zone.<br>
In further embodiments of the method, the precursor<br>
material can include a source of one or more elements<br>
selected from the group comprising chromium (cr), niobium<br>
(Nb), vanadium (V), zirconium (Zr), silicon (SiJ, boron<br>
(B), molybdenum (Mo), tantalum {Ta) and carbon (C), and<br>
products of said method can include titanium-aluminium<br>
compounds which include one or more of these elements.<br>
The source of the element(s) can be a metal halide, a<br>
subhalide, a pure element or another compound which<br>
includes the element. The products can also include one<br>
or more of an interrnetallic compound/ a titanium- (selected<br>
element)-alloy, and intermediate compounds. The source<br>
may also include a source of other precursors containing a<br>
required alloy additive, depending upon the required end<br>
product.<br>
In one form of the method, the source can include<br>
vanadium subchloride, auch as vanadium trichloride and/or<br>
vanadium dichloride, and a product of said method is an<br>
alloy or intermetallic complex including titanium,<br>
aluminium and vanadium. This method can comprise the<br>
steps of adding the source in appropriate .proportions, and<br>
carrying out the method to produce T1-6A1-4V.<br>
In a further form of the method, the source can<br>
include zirconium subchloride, and a product of the method<br>
is an alloy or intermetallic complex including titanium,<br>
aluminium, zirconium and vanadium.<br>
In one form of the method, the source can include<br>
niobium halide and chromium halide, and a product of said<br>
method is an alloy or intermetallic complex including<br>
titanium, aluminium, niobium and chromium. This method<br>
can also comprise the step of adding the source in<br>
appropriate proportions, and carrying out the method to<br>
produce Ti-48Al-2Nb-2Cr.<br>
In one embodiment of the method/ the aluminium can be<br>
added in the form of a powdei* having an approximate upper<br>
grain size of less than about 50 micrometres. In an<br>
alternative form of the method, the aluminium can be in<br>
the form of a powder of an approximate upper grain size of<br>
greater than about 50 micrometres, and the method<br>
comprises the step of milling the aluminium powder and<br>
titanium subchloride to reduce the grain size of the<br>
aluminium powder in at least one dimension, in yet<br>
another alternative form of the method, the aluminium can<br>
be in the form of flakes having a thickness in one<br>
dimension of less than about 50 micrometres. Using a fine<br>
aluminium powder is preferred, although the relatively<br>
coarser aluminium powder or flakes is a cheaper raw<br>
material.<br>
In an embodiment, the method is conducted in an inert<br>
gas atmosphere or in a vacuum.<br>
In any of the embodiments described, the method can<br>
also include a pre-processing step of forming the titanium<br>
subchloride as precursor material. The inventor has found<br>
that using a precursor material which includes titanium<br>
subchloride (preferably titanium trichloride) gives a<br>
number of advantages. There are not the problems of<br>
different; uncontrollable phases which are involved in<br>
starting from titanium tetrachloride as a precursor. The<br>
composition of the end product is relatively controllable<br>
and depends on the ratios of the starting materials. The<br>
correct ratios of starting materials are incorporated in<br>
the precursor materials to produce the appropriate<br>
proportions of components in the product.<br>
The inventor believes that the new method enables a<br>
cheaper and more controllable process for the production<br>
of titanium-aluminium compounds. It is not necessary to<br>
convert the raw titanium minerals to titanium metal, as in<br>
some of the prior art processes discussed earlier. In one<br>
¦embodiment of the present process, titanium oxide can be<br>
chlorinated using conventional technology to give titanium<br>
tetrachloride. This can then be reduced using aluminium<br>
or hydrogen to give titanium subchlorides (mainly titanium<br>
trichloride); which can then be used as the precursor<br>
material for the formation of the titanium-aluminium<br>
compounds.<br>
It is possible to form TA-6A1-4V using this process,<br>
which is one of the major titanium alloys used. It is<br>
also possible to form Ti-48Al-2Nb-2Cr. It is also<br>
possible to form other alloys such as Ti-Al-Nb-C, and Ti3Al<br>
based alloys.<br>
A process in accordance with embodiments, of the<br>
present invention described has the advantage that alloy<br>
powder is produced directly, with no further physical<br>
processing.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect, the present<br>
invention provides a method for production of a powder of<br>
titanium-aluminium intermetallic compounds including at<br>
least one of Ti3Al, TiAl and TiAl3, and alloys based on<br>
titanium-aluminium intermetallics, as defined in the first<br>
aspect, and wherein starting materials for the method<br>
include aluminium powder and titanium chloride.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect, the present<br>
invention provides a method of producing titanium-<br>
aluminium compounds, comprising a first step of-;<br>
- heating an amount of titanium chloride (TiCl4) in<br>
a plasma of an inert gas and hydrogen mixture, to<br>

vacuum, and at a temperature to trigger reactions<br>
to form titanium subchloride(s) and aluminium<br>
chloride (A1C13) products;<br>
and then a second step of:<br>
- mixing said products with aluminium, and heating<br>
the mixture in a reaction zone to a temperature<br>
above 300C to form A1C13 in a gas phase, and to<br>
produce an end product in the reaction zone of the<br>
titanium-aluminium compounds.<br>
In one embodiment, the method of the fourth aspect<br>
can be otherwise as defined in the first aspect.<br>
In accordance with a fifth aspect, the present<br>
invention provides a stepwise method of producing<br>
titanium-aluminium compounds, comprising a first step of:<br>
- heating' a mixture of Ticl* and aluminium to form<br>
products TiCl3 and A1C13, at a temperature leas<br>
than 300C;<br>
and then a second step of:<br>
- mixing said products, with the addition of more<br>
aluminium if required, and heating the mixture to<br>
a reaction zone temperature above 300C to cause<br>
AICI3 to be evaporated from the reaction zone and<br>
to form titanium-aluminium compounds.<br>
In one embodiment, the method of the fifth aspect can<br>
be otherwise as defined'in the first aspect.<br>
In accordance with a sixth aspect, the present<br>
invention provides a stepwise method of producing a metal-<br>
aluminium compound, comprising the first step of:<br>

temperature above 300C to form aluminium halides<br>
in a gaa phase, and to produce an end product in<br>
the reaction zone comprising a metal compound<br>
containing a percentage of aluminium.<br>
In one embodiment of this method, the reducing agent<br>
can be selected from the group comprising zinc, magnesium,<br>
sodium, aluminium or other like metals. In one embodiment<br>
the metal halide can be a titanium subhalide such as<br>
titanium trichloride, and a product of the reaction can<br>
include titanium compounds.<br>
In one embodiment, the method of the sixth aspect can<br>

Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The following description is of preferred embodiments<br>
of processes for producing metal compounds, including fine<br>
powder and ingots with specific compositions. The<br>
processes are useful for production of forms of metals<br>
such as titanium, vanadium and zirconium together with<br>
alloys and intermetallic compounds of these metals with a<br>
controllable amount of aluminium.<br>
For example, Ti-Al, Ti3Al, TiAl3, Ti-Al-Cr and Ti-V-<br>
Al can be made with accuracy by varying the aluminium<br>
content. The relative amounts of titanium chlorides and<br>
aluminium are determined by the required composition of<br>
end product. In one embodiment the process comprises the<br>
steps of preparing solid metal halides, mixing the halides<br>
with aluminium metal and heating the mixture to a<br>
temperature Tl to trigger reactions leading to formation<br>
of aluminium chloride at a temperature (Tl) above the<br>
boiling temperature of aluminium chlorides, and condensing<br>
the aluminium chlorides away from the reaction zone at a<br>
temperature T2, where T2 is less than Tl. The driving of<br>
the aluminium chloride away from the reaction zone moves<br>
the equilibrium of reaction in the forward direction i.e.<br>
to formation of aluminium chloride and metal (and other<br>
products depending upon reaction conditions and<br>
components).<br>
For titanium compounds, titanium subchlorides,<br>
(preferably titanium trichloride TiCl3) can be produced<br>
from a precursor material of TiCl4. The TiCl3 is mixed<br>
with aluminium and then heated to a temperature above 300C<br>
so that AICI3 is formed in the gas phase and the AlCl3 is<br>
condensed away from the reaction zone at a temperature<br>
below 200C, leaving a powder of Ti in the reaction zone<br>
containing a percentage of aluminium, as required for the<br>
end product.<br>
In one embodiment, the process comprises the steps of<br>
heating TiCl4 in a plasma of an argon-hydrogen mixture to<br>
produce TiCl.3, and then mixing the resulting TiCl3 powder<br>
with aluminium and then heating the mixture to trigger the<br>
reaction. The reaction vessel used is arranged to ailow<br>
for aluminium chloride to be continuously removed and<br>
condensed in a region away from the reaction zone of the<br>
titanium chloride and aluminium mixture. The T1CI3, and<br>
aluminium in a powder or a lump form (but preferably in a<br>
powder form) are mixed together under inert gas or in a<br>
vacuum. The mixture is then heated to a temperature of<br>
several hundred degrees to trigger reaction between the<br>
two compounds, leading to formation of AlCl3(gj. The A1C13<br>
is then condensed elsewhere in the vessel at a temperature<br>
below 200C-<br>
In a further embodiment, the process comprises the<br>
steps of heating predetermined amounts of TiCl4 and<br>
aluminium to form TiCl3 and A1C13, heating the product<br>
mixture to a temperature above 3O0C and providing foor A1C13<br>
to be evaporated from the reaction zone. The Ald3 was<br>
driven away from the reaction and condensed away from the<br>
reaction zone at a temperature below 2 00C. Further<br>
aluminium material was then added to the product in an<br>
amount depending on the required composition, and then the<br>
mixture was heated under the same physical conditions to a<br>
temperature above 300C to trigger chemical reactions<br>
leading to formation of AlCl3(g) whilst providing for the<br>
AlCl^g) to be condensed elsewhere in the vessel at a<br>
temperature below 200C.<br>
The overall reactions between titanium subchlorides<br>
TiCl3 and Al occur in the following form-.<br>
TiCl3 + Al «* Ti<sl alcl3 tixaly></sl>
where Al is present in the solid or liquid phase.<br>
The presence of Ti and Al may lead formation of Ti-Al<br>
intermetallic compounds such as TiAl3(S), TiAl<s and></s>
TisAlte). Then TiCl3 may react with aluminium according to<br>
the following simplified reactions:<br>
TiCl3{g) + TiAl3(s&gt; ** 2 Ti*Aly + AlCl3{g&gt; (2)<br>
TiCl3(g) + TiAl(S) ** 2 TixAly + AlCl3(g, (3)<br>
TiCl3{g) + Ti3Al(a, *? 2 TixAly + AlCl3(gj (4)<br>
Reactions 1-4 are driven in the forward direction by<br>
continuous removal of A1C13 from the reaction zone. As a<br>
result, equilibrium is moved to the right and the reaction<br>
proceeds "until completion. The inventor has found that<br>
the reaction proceeds slowly at temperatures slightly<br>
above 200C under an argon atmosphere at 1 atmosphere. The<br>
reaction becomes very rapid at temperatures above 500C as<br>
the Gibbs free energy of the total reaction becomes<br>
negative as seen in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the<br>
Gibbs energy for AICI3, TiCl3 and TiCl3+Ti-Al. Figure 2<br>
shows the total Gibbs energy for Reactions 1-4 leading to<br>
formation of solid titanium.<br>
Because of the strong affinity between titanium and<br>
aluminium, the presence of Al and Ti may result in<br>
formation of titanium-aluminium alloys and/or<br>
intermetallic compounds TixAly. For these compounds, the<br>
Gibbs energy of formation AGf is generally less than<br>
32kJ.mole~1 for aluminium concentrations up to 80% of the<br>
alloys (R.G.Reddy et al. J. Alloys and Compounds, vol 321<br>
(2001) 223) -<br>
Figure 2 shows the variation with temperature of the<br>
total Gibbs energy for reactions leading to formation of<br>
AlCl3(g) and Ti(S), starting from TiCl3 and Al. Also shown<br>
in Figure 2 is the total Gibbs energy for reaction leading<br>
to formation of Ti{S) and AlCl3(g), starting from TiCl3 and<br>
Ti-Al compounds. The total Gibbs free energy for Ti-Al is<br>
taken to be ~32kJ.roole~1.<br>
It is usually considered that chemical reactions<br>
proceed rapidly for negative values of the total Gibbs<br>
energy of the reaction. It is seen in Figure 2 that AG is<br>
negative at temperatures above 800K (525C) for Reaction 1.<br>
This is in excellent agreement with the experimental<br>
observations which show rapid reaction between TiCl3 and Al<br>
at a temperature of SOOC in an argon atmosphere at 1<br>
atmosphere pressure. The inventor found that as the<br>
temperature of the mixture TiCl3-Al increased above 3 00C, a<br>
cloud of white fume moved from the reaction zone towards<br>
the cold region of the vessel where it recondensed to form<br>
solid AlCl3. At temperatures above 500C, the reaction<br>
became almost spontaneous, which is in agreement with the<br>
results shown in Figure 2. For reactions involving Ti-Al<br>
compounds, the inventor found that in argon at 1<br>
atmosphere pressure, reactions leading to formation of<br>
Ti(S) and TixAly (Reactions 2, 3 and 4} seem to proceed<br>
rapidly at temperatures above 850C.<br>
Titanium chlorides may escape from the reaction zone,<br>
or disproportionate during heating. Gaseous TiCl3 that may<br>
evaporate during the heating process reacts more readily<br>
with Al and further enhances formation of Ti compounds.<br>
For a mixture of TiCl3 and Al powder, with the ratio of<br>
[Al]/[TiCl3] &gt; 1, the inventor found that only small<br>
quantities of less than a few percent of TiCl3 escape the<br>
reaction 2one, and are recondensed in a region of the<br>
vessel at a temperature around 50 OK and introduced back<br>
into the reaction sone, or alternatively collected for<br>
reprocessing. Any TiCl2 that is produced due to<br>
disproportionation, reacts with Al compounds faster than<br>
TiCl3 and enhances reactions, leading to formation of Ti<br>
compounds. The inventor found no evidence of major losses<br>
due to escape of TiCL*. The inventor has made experimental<br>
observations which suggest that, for production of<br>
titanium with a high aluminium content, disproportionation<br>
reactions have little or no significant impact on the<br>
efficiency of the process, since most of the Ti in the<br>
feedstock materials was able to be accounted for. For<br>
production of titanium with a low aluminium content, the<br>
initial amount of aluminium used is less than the<br>
stoichiometric amount needed to remove all of the chlorine<br>
from the TiCl3 materials. Excess titanium chloride<br>
remaining after depletion of available aluminium, is<br>
evaporated from the product and condensed, elsewhere for<br>
reprocessing.<br>
Production of TiCl3 can be carried out from TiCl4<br>
using a hydrogen plasma route or through reduction with<br>
aluminium. Production of TiCl3 in a hydrogen plasma, known<br>
as the Huel process, has been used in industry for several<br>
decades. Figure 3 shows the composition of TiCl4-Hydrogen<br>
plasma at temperature between 30OK and 500OK. It is seen<br>
that TiCl4 can be converted into solid TiCl3 by reacting it<br>
with hydrogen in a plasma. It is also seen that the<br>
conversion rate is almost 100%. The energy cost for<br>
synthesis of solid TiCl3 is very low as the overall<br>
reaction leading to TiCl3:<br>
TiCl4£3) + (1/2)H2 e* TiCl3(s) + HCl with AH=50 KJ/mole.<br>
For reduction of TiCl4 with aluminium, the process is<br>
usually carried out in closed vessel containing<br>
appropriate amounts of TiCl4 and Al at a temperature above<br>
2Q0C, leading to formation of a mixture of TiCl3 and A.lCl3.<br>
Pure TiCl3 is obtained from the mixture by distillation at<br>
temperature above 200C and. allowing AlCl3 to condense<br>
elsewhere.<br>
For the process disclosed herein, production of<br>
titanium-aluminium compounds is made by mixing titanium<br>
subchlorides, preferably TiCl3/ with aluminium in a powder<br>
form, placing the materials in a vessel under vacuum or in<br>
an inert atmosphere, and heating the mixture. For<br>
processing under flowing inert gas or under vacuum, A1C13<br>
formed due to reactions described above is driven into a<br>
different part of the vessel at a temperature below 200C.<br>
This favours the forward reaction formation of the<br>
aluminium halide. ' The heating continues until the<br>
reactions proceed to completion, or until complete<br>
depletion of available titanium subchlorides and/or<br>
aluminium occurs.<br>
Figure 4 shows a simple system used to make Ti-Al<br>
compounds with different Al contents and compositions.<br>
For this configuration, a mixture of TiCla and Al, fl) , is<br>
placed into a vessel (2) and heated to a temperature<br>
higher than 3 00C (typically up to a temperature of the<br>
order of 1000C depending on the composition of the<br>
mixture) . Reactions between TiCl3 and Al in the vessel (2)<br>
lead to formation of gaseous A1C13. A stream of argon gas<br>
(10) that is introduced in the vessel (2) carries the<br>
gaseous AlCl3 together with any titanium chlorides that may<br>
escape from the reaction zone and drives them through a<br>
second vessel (3) which is held at a temperature between<br>
3 00C and S00C, so that TiCl3 is recondensed while AlCl3<br>
remains in. the gas phase. Alternatively, TiCl^ may be<br>
recondensed on the upper walls of the vessel (2) if it is<br>
held at an appropriate temperature. The remaining AlCl3<br>
together with any TiCl4 that may have formed in the<br>
reaction zone due to disproportionation is driven through<br>
a vessel (4) at a temperature higher than 136C and lower<br>
than 200C so that A1C13 is recondensed, and the remaining<br>
TiCl4 is driven into a vessel (5) which is held at room<br>
temperature. The remaining argon gas is discharged out of<br>
the system or recycled.<br>
Typically the gaseous atmosphere in the vessel is an<br>
inert gas, such as argon, helium, neon, xenon. Reactive<br>
gases such as methane or oxygen are undesirable as they<br>
can chemically react with the mixture resulting in other<br>
products. It is noted that the reactions can also be<br>
conducted in the absence of a gaseous atmosphere (eg under<br>
vacuum).<br>
The TiCl3 and an aluminium powder, the relative mass<br>
of which compared to the mass of TiCl3 depends on the<br>
composition of the required product, are introduced into a<br>
vessel as described above and then heated until the<br>
reaction is complete.<br>
For these processes described above, the product is<br>
typically in the form of a fine powder. The powder may be<br>
discharged from the vessel, at the completion of chemical<br>
reactions in the reaction zone, for further processing.<br>
Alternatively, the powder may be further processed in-situ<br>
for production of other materials. Alternatively the<br>
powder may be heated in-situ to make coarse grain powder.<br>
In a further embodiment, the powder may be compacted<br>
and/or heated in-situ and then melted to produce ingot.<br>
It is highly advantageous to have titanium-aluminium<br>
compounds produced in powder form. As discussed in the<br>
preamble this is something that prior art processes cannot<br>
do directly. The powder form is much more versatile in<br>
manufacture of titanium aluminium alloy products, eg<br>
shaped fan blades that may be used in the aerospace<br>
industry.<br>
The aluminium to be mixed with the titanium<br>
subchloride in these processes is, in one ¦ embodiment, in<br>
fine powder form, usually having an approximate grain<br>
topsize of less than 5Q micrometres in diameter. Fine<br>
aluminium powder is usually less than 50 micrometres in<br>
diameter. A problem with using fine aluminium powder is<br>
that it is quite expensive to produce and therefore<br>
increases the cost of the process, although the inventor<br>
still believes that the cost will still be far less than<br>
prior art processes.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, coarse aluminium powder<br>
is used, the powder having an approximate grain topsiae of<br>
greater than SO micrometres in diameter. The coarse<br>
aluminium powder is added to the titanium subchloride and<br>
the mixture is mechanically milled to reduce the<br>
dimensions of the aluminium powder in at least one<br>
dimension. This can result in the production of "flakes"<br>
of aluminium which have a size in at least one dimension<br>
which is less than 50 micrometres and which is sufficient<br>
to facilitate a satisfactory reaction between the titanium<br>
subchlorides and the aluminium. Flakes provide a higher<br>
reaction surface area and the small thickness of the<br>
flakes results in a more uniform composition of product.<br>
In a further alternative embodiment, the aluminium<br>
raw material may be obtained in the form of flakes (±e<br>
already pre-milled) and mixed with the titanium<br>
subchlorides before reaction commences.<br>
A further embodiment of an. apparatus which can be<br>
used to prepare titanium-aluminium compounds in accordance<br>
-with the present invention is illustrated in Figure 5.<br>
The apparatus in this case is a simple vessel (60) having<br>
relatively long (tall) side walls (20) . An upper pozrtion<br>
• (40) of the side walls (20) forms a first condensation<br>
zone at temperature T2, for condensation of A1C13. A<br>
middle portion (50) of the side walls (2 0) forms a second<br>
condensation zone at temperature T3 allowing for<br>
condensation of TiCi3. Titanium-aluminium compounds (11)<br>
are formed at the bottom of the vessel (60).<br>
Parameters influencing reactions in the reaction zone,<br>
include the pressure in the reaction vessel, the<br>
temperature of the reaction zone and the grain size of the<br>
Al powder. The inventor has found that, for operation<br>
under low pressure, a lower temperature is required in<br>
order to drive the reaction, as A1C13 is removed faster<br>
from the reaction zone and TiCl3 species become more<br>
volatile and more active, thus triggering reactions with<br>
aluminium. However, this also results in a lower yield,<br>
escape of some volatile titanium chloride, and possibly to<br>
the production of a two phase product due to<br>
disproportionate on.<br>
Also, the inventor found that the reaction between<br>
TiCl3 and Al depends strongly on the size of the Al powder<br>
grains. The reaction is much faster for smaller grains<br>
and also the yield is higher. Very fine aluminium powder<br>
results in the formation of a product of Ti-Al compounds<br>
with very fine grains, having irregular shapes. The<br>
inventor also found that with cheaper, less fine powders,<br>
the production yield of titanium aluminium compounds was<br>
still satisfactorily high and the resultant grain size<br>
comparable to that achieved with finer aluminium powders.<br>
As discussed above, relatively coarse titanium<br>
powders can also be used, and the mixture can be milled to<br>
produce flakes, or the aluminium starting material can be<br>
provided in the form of flakes.<br>
As discussed above, TiCl4 can be used to produce the<br>
titanium subchlorides to be used as the precursor material<br>
for the production of the titanium aluminium compounds.<br>
Thus, titanium tetrachloride can be used as a feedstock<br>
material. The production of TiCl4 from titanium ore<br>
(titanium oxide) is a well known process, usually as a<br>
precursor step for preparation of Ti metal by processes<br>
such as the Kroll and Hunter process. Methods in<br>
accordance with the present invention can also use TiCl4 as<br>
a feedstock material. Instead of preparing the metal<br>
directly from TiCl4, however, TiCl4 is reduced to produce<br>
the precursor material TiCl3. As briefly described above,<br>
this embodiment utilises two methods for the production of<br>
TiCl3:<br>
Reduction of TiCl4 using Aluminium:<br>
TiCl4 and aluminium metal (coarse or fine powder) in<br>
appropriate amounts are introduced into a closed vessel<br>
under an inert gas atmosphere (such as argon) . The vessel<br>
is then heated to a temperature above 200C to form a<br>
mixture of TiCl3 and A1C13. .The TiCl3 powder is then<br>
extracted from the mixture by distillation as described<br>
before. The TiCl3 powder is then mixed with more aluminium<br>
if required and processed utilising an apparatus such as<br>
described above in relation to Figure 4.<br>
Reduction of TiCl4 using hydrogen:<br>
TiCl4 may be fed into a plasma-processing unit<br>
operating with argon and hydrogen gas to produce TiCl3.<br>
Products exiting from the plasma processing system may<br>
travel through a filter to separate TiCl3 from the gas<br>
stream and the resulting TiCl3 powder can then be moved<br>
into a processing chamber where it is mixed with an<br>
appropriate amount of aluminium, depending on the required<br>
composition of the end product. The mixture is then<br>
processed utilising an apparatus such as that described<br>
earlier in relation to Figure 4 or Figure 5. At the<br>
completion of the reaction/ the materials can be<br>
discharged from the reaction vessel for use in<br>
manufacturing. Alternatively, the powder can be<br>
consolidated in-situ, and then melted to produce ingots.<br>
Gases from the plasma system may be re-used after<br>
separation and cleaning.<br>
In the above-described processes, it is possible to<br>
include other precursor materials in addition to the<br>
aluminium and titanium subchlorides, to obtain products of<br>
desired composition. For example, the precursor materials<br>
may include vanadium subchlorides, such as vanadium<br>
trichloride and/or vanadium dichloride and the products<br>
may include titanium-aluminium-vanadium compounds. The<br>
precursor material may include chromium halides and the<br>
products may include titanium-aluminium-chromium<br>
compounds. Kiobium. halide may be added as a starter<br>
material to produce titanium-aluminium-niobium-chromium<br>
compounds. The precursor materials may also include one<br>
or more halides of elements such as chromium., niobium,<br>
vanadium, zirconium, silicon, boron, molybdenum and<br>
carbon.<br>
Figure 6 is a schematic diagram of a process for the<br>
production of titanium-aluminium compound powder from<br>
titanium tetrachloride starting materials, in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. The process<br>
discloses how aluminium trichloride can be recycled to<br>
produce raw materials.<br>
TiGl4 is reduced using hydrogen, as discussed above,<br>
to result in TiCl3 (Step 1) . TiCl3 is then mixed with<br>
aluminium powder and any other precursors that are<br>
required are added (Step 2) and then the mixture is<br>
processed at temperatures of up to 1000C (temperature will<br>
depend upon the precursor mix and products required). Any<br>
titanium trichloride given off is put back into the<br>
reaction mixture (Step 4) and any titanium tetrachloride<br>
which is given off is fed back into the process (Step 5)<br>
for the production of titanium trichloride (Step 1) . From<br>
the processing of Step 3, alloy powder products are also<br>
obtained (Step 6).<br>
Any aluminium trichloride produced as a by-product<br>
(Step 7) can be used for other purposes. For example,<br>
such by-products can be electrolysed to produce aluminium<br>
and chlorine (the aluminium may be fed back into Step 2) .<br>
Advantageously, in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the aluminium trichloride can be<br>
recycled to produce titanium tetrachloride by reacting the<br>
A1C13 with the titanium ore (rutile or titanium oxide, Step<br>
8; producing titanium tetrachlorides, Step 9; and<br>
aluminium oxide, Step 10) . The aluminium oxide produced<br>
by this process can be sold or electrolysed to produce<br>
aluminium raw material, which can be added to the<br>
precursor material in this process.<br>
Figure 7 shows the Gibbs free energy for the half<br>
reaction leading to aluminium oxide and titanium<br>
tetrachloride. The total Gibbs free energy for reaction<br>
leading to the formation of titanium tetrachloride is<br>
negative at all temperatures higher than 30OK, suggesting<br>
the reaction is exothermic.<br>
Figure 8 is a schematic diagram of a further<br>
production process for the production of titanium<br>
aluminium compound powder which involves the step of<br>
reduction of titanium tetrachloride with aluminium in<br>
order to obtain the required titanium trichloride<br>
precursor material. All the other process steps in the<br>
Figure 8 production process are the same as the process<br>
illustrated in Figure 6 with the exception of Step 1A<br>
which is the reduction of titanium tetrachloride by<br>
aluminium. Note that Step 1A also may produce some<br>
aluminium trichloride by-products which can be recycled<br>
via Step 7.<br>
The following are examples of preparation of titanium<br>
aluminium compounds in accordance with an embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Example 1: TJ-6A1-4V<br>
TiCl3 is prepared by reducing TiCl4 with Al powder. The<br>
starting materials were 20g of TxCl3 + lg of Al powder<br>
{grain size 
materials were mixed together very thoroughly and then<br>
introduced into a Ta crucible and heated in a quartz tube<br>
under flowing argon (100 cc/minute) . The temperature is<br>
taken to 1000C over 30 minutes and kept there for 1 hour.<br>
Materials left in the crucible are 1.65g of metallic<br>
powder. The powder is washed in distilled water to remove<br>
any residual chlorine (at ppm level) and then dried under<br>
argon. XRT&gt; analysis of the powder (Figure 9) shows peaks<br>
that can. be indexed on the T1-6A.1-4V composition, EDX<br>
analysis of the powder shows a weight % composition of<br>
Ti: 90.1%; Al: 5.8%; V: 4.1%. It was noted that the<br>
chlorine and oxygen level were either non existant or<br>
below the detection limits of the instrument.<br>
Example 2: Gamma Titanium aluminides<br>
lOg of TiCl3 was mixed with 3. 5g of Al powder {grain size<br>
crucible and heated in a quartz tube under flowing argon<br>
(100 cc/tninute) . The temperature is taken to 10 00C over<br>
30 minutes and kept there for 1 hour. The crucible is<br>
then left to cool down and opened. Materials left in the<br>
crucible consisted of 4.72 g of grey metallic powder. The<br>
powder was washed in distilled water and then dried under<br>
argon. XRD analysis (Figure 10) is consistent with the<br>
gamma TiAl composition. EDX analysis of the powder<br>
suggests the composition of 49.4% (atomic)Ti and 50.6%<br>
(atomic)Al.<br>
Example 3: Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb<br>
lOg of TiCl3, 3.52g of Al powder, 0.34g of CrCl2 and 0 .78g<br>
of HbCl5 were mixed thoroughly and then placed in a Ta<br>
crucible in a quartz tube and then heated under flowing<br>
argon (100 cc/minute) . The temperature was taken to 1000C<br>
over a period of 30 minutes and then left at 1000C for 1<br>
hour. 4.4g of metallic powder were left in the crucible.<br>
An EDX analysis of the powder suggests a composition of<br>
Ti-47Al-2.3Cr-2.3Wb (atomic percent).<br>
The methods described herein may also be used for<br>
production of metals and metal alloys hy mixing metal<br>
halide or a mixture of metal halides (chlorides, bromides,<br>
iodides and fluorides) and carrying out the process as<br>
described above for the TiCl4
zirconium alloys may be produced using the same procedures<br>
described above for Ti and Ti-alloys respectively. For<br>
zirconium-based products, the starting material is<br>
zirconium chloride. Other examples of metals that can be<br>
produced using the present process include vanadium and<br>
its alloys and intermetallic compounds. Titanium metal<br>
can be produced by the above process following extensive<br>
recycling of titanium chlorides. Titanium intermetallic<br>
compounds which can be produced include Ti3Al, TiAl and<br>
TiAl3. In still further embodiments, reducing agents other<br>
than aluminium which may be able to be used with a metal<br>
subhalide to produce a metal compound can include zinc,<br>
magnesium, sodium, aluminium or other like metals.<br>
The present method may be used for production of<br>
powders with a controlled particle size of various<br>
compositions including compounds of pure metal, oxides,<br>
nitrides of elements such as vanadium and zirconium, as<br>
described above for titanium.<br>
Modifications and variations as would be apparent to<br>
a skilled addressee are deemed to be within the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>

The present invention relates to a method and<br>
apparatus for the production of titanium alloys and<br>
titanium-aluminium inter-metallic compounds and alloys.<br>
Starting from a precursor material including titanium<br>
subchloride (titanium trichloride or titanium dichloride),<br>
the precursor material is reduced by aluminium tc produce<br>
titanium-aluminium intermetallic complexes or alloys and<br>
aluminium chloride which is driven away from the reaction<br>
zone so as to favour the forward reaction and the<br>
production of the titanium-aluminium compounds.<br>
Starting from a precursor material of titanium<br>
subchloride avoids the problems associated with starting<br>
from titanium metal (which is expensive to produce) or<br>
titanium tetrachloride (a reaction very difficult to<br>
0control), and results in the production of powdered forms<br>
of titanium-aluminium compounds with controllable<br>
composition.</td>
