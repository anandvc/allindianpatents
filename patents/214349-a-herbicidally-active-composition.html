				<td>Herbicidal mixtures based on 3-phenyluracils<br>
The present invention relates to herbicidally active compositions comprising 3-phenyluracils and at least one further active compound selected from herbicidally active compounds and safeners.<br>
In crop protection products, it is desirable in principle to _ increase the specificity and the reliability of the action of active compounds. In particular, it is desirable for the crop protection product to control the harmful plants effectively and, at the same time, to be tolerated by the useful plants in question.<br>
Various publications have described 3-phenyluracils as being highly effective herbicides. However, their compatibility with dicotyledonous crop plants such as cotton, oilseed rape and some graminaceous plants such as barley, millet, corn, rice, wheat and sugar cane is not always satisfactory, i.e. in addition to the harmful plants, the crop plants are also damaged to an extent which is not acceptable. It is possible to spare the useful plants by lowering the application rates; however the extent of the control of harmful plants is naturally also reduced.<br>
It is known that certain combinations of different herbicides with specific action result in an enhanced activity of a herbicide component by synergism. As a consequence, it is possible to reduce the application rates of herbicidally- active compounds required for controlling the harmful plants.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that in some cases better crop plant compatibility can be achieved by joint application of specifically acting herbicides with organic active compounds, some of which are themselves herbicidally active. In these cases, the active compounds act as antidote or antagonist, and, owing to the fact that they can reduce or even prevent damage to the crop plants, they are also referred to as safeners.<br>
DE 195 05 202 describes herbicidal compositions comprising a herbicidally effective amount of a 3-phenyluracil and an antagonistically effective amount of a<br>
3- (2-chlorophenylmethyl) -1- (1-methyl-l-phenylethyl) urea and/or a 1- (1-methyl-l-phenylethyl) -3- (4-tolyl )urea.<br>
3-Phenyluracils of the formula I:<br><br>
5                    :)<br>
10 in which the variables R^ - R^ are as defined below: Ri      is methyl or NH2;<br>
R2      is Ci-C2-haloalkyl;<br>
15<br>
R3      is hydrogen or halogen;<br>
R4      is halogen or cyano;<br>
20 R5      is hydrogen, cyano, Ci-Cg-alkyl, Ci-Cg-alkoxy,<br>
Ci-C4-alkoxy-Ci-C4-alkyl, Cs-Cy-cycloalkyl, Ca-Ce-alkenyl, Cs-Cg-alkynyl or benzyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by halogen or alkyl;<br>
25 R^, R"   independently of one another are hydrogen, Ci-Cg-alkyl, Ci-Cg-alkoxy, Cs-Cg-alkenyl, Ca-Ce-alkynyl, C3-C7-cycloalkyl, Cs-Cy-cycloalkenyl, phenyl or benzyl, where each of the 8 abovementioned substituents is unsubstituted or may be substituted by 1 to 6 -halogen<br>
30	atoms and/or by one, two or three groups selected from:<br>

35	C1-C4-alkoxycarbonyl, C1-C4-alkylaminocarbonyl,<br>
di(C1-C4-alkyl)aminocarbonyl, C3-C7-cycloalkyl, phenyl and benzyl; or<br>
R6, R7   together with the nitrogen atom form a 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or<br>
40	7-membered saturated or unsaturated nitrogen heterocycle<br>
which may be substituted by 1 to 6 methyl groups and which may contain 1 or 2 further heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur as ring members, 45<br><br>
and their agriculturally acceptable salts are disclosed in the earlier patent application PCT/EP 01/04850.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to increase the herbicidal activity of 3-phenyluracils of the formula I against undesirable harmful plants and to improve simultaneously their compatibility with useful plants.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved, surprisingly, by compositions comprising at least one 3-phenyluracil of the formula I and/or at least one agriculturally acceptable salt of i and at least one further active compound, selected from<br>

The invention relates in particular to compositions in the form of herbicidally active crop protection compositions comprising a<br>
10  herbicidally effective cimount of at least one mixture of A with B and/or C,   as  defined above,   and at least one  liquid and/or solid carrier and,   if desired,   one or more  surfactants  and,   if desired, one or more  further auxiliaries customary for crop protection compositions.   The  invention also relates to  compositions  in the<br>
15  form of  a crop protection composition  formulated  as  a 2-component composition comprising a first component which  comprises  the active compound A,   a solid or liquid carrier and,   if appropriate, one or more  surfactants,   and a second component which comprises at least one  further active compound selected from the herbicides<br>
20  B and the  safeners  C,   a solid or  liquid carrier  and,   if<br>
appropriate,   one or more  surfactants,  where  both components may additionally comprise  further auxiliaries customary for crop protection compositions.<br>
25  The  invention  furthermore relates to a method for controlling undesirable vegetation,   in particular in crops  of cereals,   corn, soybeans,   rice,   oilseed rape,   cotton,   potatoes,   groundnuts or in perennial crops,   and also in crops which,  by genetic engineering or by breeding,   are resistant to one or more herbicides  or to<br>
30 attack by insects.   The invention also relates to a method for the desiccation or defoliation of plants.   In the  latter methods  it  is immaterial whether the herbicidally active compounds  of components A)   and B)   and/or C)   are formulated and applied  jointly or separately,   and,   in the case of separate  application,   in which<br>
35  order the  application takes place.<br>

The categorization of the active compounds according to their mode  of   action  is based on current understanding.   If  an  active compound  acts  by more than one mode of   action,   this   substance was assigned to only one mode of  action.<br><br>
If  the phenyluracils I,   the herbicides  B  and/or the  safeners are capable of  forming geometrical isomers,   for example E/Z isomers,   it is  possible to use both the pure isomers and mixtures thereof in the compositions according to the invention.  If the phenyluracils I,   the herbicides B and/or the safeners C have one or more  centers  of chirality and,   as   a consequence,   are present as  enantiomers  or diastereomers,   it is possible to use both the-pure  enantiomers  and diastereomers and their mixtures in the compositions  according to the invention.<br>
If the phenyluracils I,   the herbicides B  and/or the  safeners  C have  functional  groups which can be ionized,   they can also be used in the form of their agriculturally acceptable  salts.   In general,   the salts  of those cations or the  acid addition salts  of those  acids  are   suitable whose cations  and anions,   respectively, have no  adverse  effect on the action of the  active compounds.<br>

dispersions, the active compounds A) to C), as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates consisting of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if desired, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>

Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomitant grinding of the active substances with a solid carrier.<br>

Solid carriers are mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders, or other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of the active compounds in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within wide ranges, in general, the formulations comprise from 0.001 to 98% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 95% by weight, of active ingredients. The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br><br>
The compounds according to the invention can, for example, be formulated as follows:<br>
I	20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are dissolved in a mixture composed of 80 parts by weight of alkylated benzene, 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 8 to 10 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of oleic acid N-monoethanolamide, 5 parts by weight of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and 5 parts fay weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
II	20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are dissolved in a mixture composed of 40 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 30 parts by weight of isobutanol, 20 parts by weight of the adduct of 7 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of isooctylphenol and 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
III	2 0 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are dissolved in a mixture composed of 25 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 55 parts by weight of a mineral oil fraction of boiling point 210 to 280°C and 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 4 0 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active ingredient-<br>
:V  20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are mixed thoroughly with 3 parts by weight of sodium diisobutylnaphthalenesulfonate, 17 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a lignosulfonic acid from a sulfite waste liquor and 60 parts by weight of pulverulent silica gel, and the mixture is ground in a hammer mill. Finely distributing the mixture in 20 000 parts by weight of water gives a spray mixture v;hich comprises 0.1% by weight of the active ingredient.<br><br>
V	3 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound<br>
mixture in question are mixed with 97 parts by weight of<br>
finely divided kaolin. This gives a dust which comprises 3%<br>
by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
VI	20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are mixed intimately with 2 parts by weight of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, 8 parts by weight of fatty alcohol polyglycol ether, 2 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a phenol-urea-formaldehyde condensate and 68 parts by weight of a paraf f inic mineral oil. This gives a stable oily dispersion.<br>
VII	1 part by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question is dissolved in a mixture composed of 7 0 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 20 parts by weight of ethoxylated isooctylphenol and 10 parts by weight of ethoxylated castor oil. This gives a stable emulsion concentrate.<br>
VIII1 part by weight of the active compound or active compound<br>
mixture in question is dissolved in a mixture composed of 80 parts by weight of cyclohexanone and 2 0 parts by weight of Wettol® EM 31 (nonionic emulsifier based on ethoxylated castor oil). This gives a stable emulsion concentrate.<br>
The components A and B and/or C can be formulated jointly or separately.<br>
The components A and B and/or C can be applied jointly or separately, simultaneously or successively, before, during or after emergence of the plants.<br>
If the active compounds A and B and/or C are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, it is possible to use application methods in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed with the aid of sprayers in such a way that the leaves of the sensitive crop plants are as far as possible unaffected, v/hereas the active compounds reach the leaves of the undesirable plants growing underneath or the uncovered soil surface (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
The required application rate of pure active compound composition, i.e. of A and B and/or C without formulation auxiliary, depends on the composition of the plant stand, on the i development stage of the plants, on the climatic conditions of the location where the composition is used and on the application method, in general, the application rate of A and B and/or C is<br><br>
from 0.001 to 3 kg/ha, preferably from 0.005 to 2 kg/ha and in particular from 0.01 to 1 kg/ha of active substance (a.s.).<br>
The required application rates of phenyluracil are generally in the range from 0.1 g/ha to 1 kg/ha and preferably in the range from 1 g/ha to 500 g/ha or from 5 g/ha to 500 g/ha of a.s.<br>
The compositions are applied to the plants mainly by foliar spraying. Application can be carried out by customary spraying techniques using, for example, water as carrier and spray liquor rates of from about 100 to 1 000 1/ha (for example from 300 to 400 1/ha). Application of the herbicidal compositions by the low-volume and the ultra-low-volume method is possible, as is their application in the form of microgranules.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention are suitable for controlling common harmful plants in useful plants, in particular in crops such as wheat, barley, oats, corn, soybean, sorghum, rice, oilseed rape, cotton, potatoes, dry beans, groundnuts or in perennial crops. In another embodiment of the invention, they are useful for controlling the whole vegetation, i. e. they act as a total weedkiller. Futhermore, in another emodiment of the present invention, the compositions are useful for controlling undesirable vegetation in forestry.<br>
Moreover, it may be useful to apply the compositions according to the invention jointly as a mixture with other crop protection products, for example with pesticides or agents for controlling phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates may also be added.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can also be used in crop plants which are resistant to one or more herbicides owing to genetic engineering or breeding or which are resistant to attack by insects owing to genetic engineering or breeding. Suitable are for example crop plants which are resistant to herbicidal EPSP synthase inhibitors, such as, for example, glyphosate, to herbicidal glutamine synthase inhibitors, such as, for example, glufosinate, to herbicidal protoporphyrinogen-IX oxidase inhibitors, such as, for example, butafenacil, or to herbicidal ALS inhibitors, such as, for example, imazamethabenz, imazamox, imazapic, imazapyr, imazaquin, imazethapyr, or crop plants which, owing to introduction of the gene for Bt toxin by-, genetic modification, are resistant to attack by certain insects.<br><br>
Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention which comprise at least one phenyluracil of the formula I and at least one herbicide B have better herbicidal activity against harmful plants than would have been expected by the herbicidal activity of the individual compounds. In other words, the joint application of phenyluracil I and herbicide B results in an enhanced activity against harmful plants in the sense of a synergy effect (synergism). For this reason, the mixtures can, based on the individual components, be used at lower application rates to achieve a herbicidal effect comparable to the individual components.<br>
Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention which, in addition to the phenyluracil I and, if appropriate, the herbicide B comprise an active compound from group C are better tolerated by useful plants than the respective phenyluracil I or the respective mixture of phenyluracil + herbicide B without active compound of group C.<br>
The 3-phenyluracils of the formula I can be prepared by the preparation processes A to D described below, which are the subject of the earlier application PCT/EP 01/04850. With respect to the preparation of individual compounds, reference is made to the examples of PCT/EP 01/04850. Compounds which are not explicitly disclosed in this document can be prepared in an analogous manner.<br>
In the schemes below, Q has the following meaning:<br><br>
A)  Reaction of a benzoic acid derivtive of the formula III in<br>
which R^, R* and Q are as defined above with a sulfonamide IV, if appropriate in the presence of a coupling agent such as N,N-carbonyldiimida2ole (CDI), or conversion of III into its acid chloride and subsequent reaction of the acid chloride of III with IV:<br><br><br>
In general, the reaction with IV is preceded by activation of<br>
the carboxylic acid III. For activation, it is possible for<br>
exaxnple, to convert III into its acid chloride by treatment<br>
Of the acxd III with SOCI3, POCI3, PCI3, COCI3 or (0001)7<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to prepare the i.ida.ole b;<br>
reaction of in with N,N-carbonyldii.idazole. These processes<br>
are generally known, for example fro. Houben Weyl, Methoden<br>
der Organxschen OheMe [Methods of Organic Chemistry<br>
vol. E5 (1985), Part 1, p. 587 ff. and Vol. E5 (1985 "<br>
part II, p. 934 ff.	U^B:)},<br>
As an alternative to the activation of III via its imidazolides or acid chlorides, it is also possible to use other customary methods of activating carboxylic acids for activating III.<br>
In a typical embodiment, for example,<br>
N,N"-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI) is added to a solution of the carboxylic acid in in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The resulting mixture is heated, preferably at reflux.temperature, until complete conversion has been achieved, and is then cooled. The unsubstituted or " substituted sulfonamide IV is added to this mixture followed, if appropriate, by a nitrogen base, for example a tertiary amine or an amidine base such as<br>
diazabicycloundecane (DBU), and the mixture is stirred until the reaction has gone to completion. Oonventional work-up and isolation in a customary manner gives the target compound I.<br>
The benzoic acid derivatives III - and their correspondina esters, which can be hydrolyzed in a customary manner to give the free acids III - are known from the prior art or can be prepared in an analogous manner.<br>
Processes for hydrolyzing the esters of III to the corresponding acids are likewise known from the prior art or can be carried out by standard methods for hydrolyzing esters (see also: Kocienski, "Protecting Groups", Thieme Verlaa 1994; Greene, Wuts, Protecting groups in organic synthesis Wiley 1999; Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Ohemie  "<br><br>
[Methods of organic chemistry]. Vol, E5, Part I (1985), p. 223 ff.)-<br>
The acids III, such as 2-chloro-5-[ 3 , 6-dihydro-3-methyl-2 , 6-dioxo-4- (trif luoromethyl) -1 (2H) -pyrimidinyl ] -4-f luoro-benzoic acid (CAS No. 120890-57-5), and their esters are described, for example, in EP-A 195346, WO 89/02891, WO 98/08151 and the literature cited therein, or they can be prepared in the manner described therein.<br>
B)  Reaction of an aniline compound of the formula V with an<br>
oxazinone compound VI, giving a 3-phenyluracil of the formula VII which is then alkylated with an alkyl halide:<br><br>
The oxazinone compounds VI are known, for example, from WO 99/14216. Here, R1 is preferably methyl.<br>
The reaction of the aniline compound V with the oxazinone VI is usually carried out in a carboxylic acid, for example acetic acid, at temperatures in the range from 0 to 100°C, for example at room temperature, where the components are<br><br>
usually employed in equimolar amounts, or one of the components is employed in excess.<br>
The alkylation of the aniline compound VII at the free uracil nitrogen is achieved in a manner known per se for uracils by reacting VII with an alkylating agent, preferably a methylating agent, for example a methyl halide, preferably methyl iodide, or dimethyl sulfate. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a base, for example an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, an alkali metal bicarbonate or, in particular, in the presence of an alkali metal carbonate. The alkylating agent is preferably employed in excess, based on VII. Suitable solvents are, in principle, all inert organic solvents, for example C1-C4-alcohols, haloalkyl compounds such as dichloromethane, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane and, preferably, polar aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
The aniline compounds of the formula V can be prepared by customary methods, for example by converting the benzoic acid compound VIII analogously to the procedure described under A into the corresponding N-sulfonylcarboxamide IX, which is initially nitrated and then reduced to give the aniline V:<br><br>
Suitable nitrating agents are, for example, nitric acid in various concentrations, including concentrated and fuming nitric acid, and also mixtures of nitric acid and sulfuric acid, acyl nitrates and alkyl nitrates.<br><br>
The nitration can be  carried out in the  absence  of  a solvent in an excess of the nitrating agent,   or in an inert solvent or diluent,   for example in water,   in  a mineral  acid,   in organic  acids  or in anhydrides thereof,   such as   acetic  acid and acetic anhydride,   in halogenated hydrocarbons  such as methylene chloride,   or  in mixtures of the  abovementioned solvents.<br>
The N-sulfonylbenzamide IX and the nitrating agent can be employed,   for example,   in equimolar amounts.   In terms of  the yield of IX,   it may be  advantageous to employ the  nitrating agent in an up to  lO-fold molar excess,   based on VIII.   if the reaction is  carried out in the  absence  of  a  solvent  using the nitrating agent  as  diluent,   the nitrating  agent  is   frequently employed in  an even greater excess.<br>
The nitration is usually carried out at temperatures  in the range from  (-100)°C to  200°C,   preferably  in the range  from (-30)   to  50OC.<br>
The resulting nitro compound X is then reduced by customary methods  to give  the  aniline compound V.<br>
The reduction of X to  V can be carried out   in a customary manner.   Usually,  the reduction of X is  caxried out using a transition metal such  as  iron,   zinc or tin under  acidic reaction conditions,   or by treating X with  a complex hydride such as  lithium aluminum hydride or sodium borohydride.<br>
The reduction of X can be carried out  in  the  absence of  a solvent or in  a  solvent  or diluent.   Examples  of  suitable solvents   are water,   alcohols  such as methanol,   ethanol  and isopropanol,   and also  ethers,   for example  diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether,   dioxane,   tetrahydrofuran  and ethylene  glycol  dimethyl ether,  where the  solvent  is  chosen in a manner  known per   se  according to  the  reducing  agent used.<br>
If  a metal  serves  as   reducing agent,   the  reduction  is preferably carried out   in an inorganic  acid,   in particular  in dilute or concentrated  hydrochloric acid,   or in a  liquid organic  acid,   such as   acetic acid or propionic acid.   However, it  is possible to mix the acid with one  of  the abovementioned solvents  or diluents.   The reduction of  X with complex hydrides  is usually carried out in an organic solvent, preferably in an ether  or an alcohol.<br><br>
Nitro compound X and the reducing agent are frequently-employed in approximately equimolar amounts; with respect to optimizing the reaction, it may also be advantageous to employ a relatively large excess of reducing agent, for example an up to 10-fold excess, based on the stoichiometric amount.<br>
The amount of acid is of minor importance. To achieve complete conversion of the starting material, it is recommended to employ at least equimolar amounts of acid. Frequently, the acid is also employed in excess, based on the nitro compound X.<br>
The reduction is usually carried out at temperatures in the range from (-30) to 200°C, preferably in the range from 0 to 80OC.<br>
For work-up, the reaction mixture is usually poured into water, and the aniline compound V is isolated by filtration or extraction with a water-immiscible solvent, for example ethyl acetate, diethyl ether or methylene chloride. If desired, the aniline compound V can be purified in a customary manner, for example by crystallisation.<br>
The hydrogenation of the nitro group in X can also be effected by catalytic hydrogenation. Examples of suitable catalysts are Raney-nickel, palladium on activated carbon, palladium oxide, platinum and platinum oxide. The amount of catalyst is usually in the range from 0.05 to 50 mol%, based on the nitro compound X to be reduced.<br>
The hydrogen partial pressure required for the hydrogenation is usually in the range from atmospheric pressure to 50 bar.<br>
The catalytic hydrogenation is frequently carried out in an inert solvent, for example in acetic acid, acetic acid/water mixtures, ethyl acetate or toluene. Following the removal of the catalyst, the reaction mixture is worked up in a customary manner, giving the aniline compound V.<br>
Further suitable methods can be found in the literature (see, for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Stickstoffverbindungen [Nitrogen compounds] I, Part 1 (1971), Vol. X/1, p. 463 ff.).<br><br>
Further methods which can be used in a similar manner for preparing the phenyluracils I are described in Boger, Wakabayashi: Peroxidizing herbicides, Springer Verlag 1999.<br>
Analogously to the synthesis route described here under B, it is also possible to prepare the carboxylic acid III starting from the carboxylic acid VIII.<br>
C)	Replacement of a halogen radical by a uracil radical Q:<br><br>
Hal = Halogen, preferably bromine or iodine.<br>
Here, the aniline V is initially converted into the corresponding diazonium salt which is then, in a Sandmeyer reaction in a manner known per se, converted into the halogen compound XI, for example by treatment with copper(I) halide or copper(II) halide or, in the case of the iodide XI (Hal = 1), also by treatment of the diazonium salt of V with iodine/potasslum iodide. These methods are generally known to the person skilled in the art, for example from Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Org. Chemie, Vol, 5/4, 4th edition 1960, p. 438 ff.<br>
The reaction of XI with a uracil compound QH, preferably in the presence of a copper (I) compound as catalyst, then affords the corresponding 3-phenyluracil I.<br>
By this route, it is also possible to prepare phenyluracils I where Hal = iodine similarly to the methods described by T. Maruyama, K. Fujiwara and M. Fukuhara in J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1995 (7), pp. 733-734, using Cu(I) compounds.<br>
D)	Reaction of the benzoic ester XII, for example the methyl<br>
ester, with an electrophilic aminating agent, giving<br>
3-(l-aminouracil-3-yl)benzoic ester XIII, hydrolysis of XIII to give 3-(l-aminouracil-3-yl) benzoic acid XIV (where R1 =, , NH2) and conversion of XIV by the method described under A into the compound I where R^ = NH2:<br><br><br>
Examples of electrophilic aminating agents are 2,4-dinitro-phenylhydroxylamine and O-mesitylenesulfonylhydroxylamine. Suitable reaction conditions for the electrophilic amination are given in DE-A 19 652 431, the disclosure of which on the electrophilic amination is expressly incorporated herein by way of reference.<br>
The esters XII can be prepared from the corresponding 3-aminoben2oic acids or 3-aminobenzoic esters using the methods described under B. The hydrolysis of XIII to acid XIV is carried out by customary methods, for example in the presence of catalytic amounts of a mineral acid such as. hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, or in the presence of an organic sulfonic acid, preferably in an aqueous or aqueous-alcoholic solvent. Alternatively, the "hydrolysis" can also be carried out under nonaqueous reaction conditions, for example by successive cleavage with a halogen transfer reagent such as boron tribromide or trimethylsilyl iodide and subsequent aqueous work-up.<br>
In the preparation, the 3-phenyluracils I to be used according to the invention can be obtained as isomer mixtures which can be separated into the pure isomers using conventional methods, for example crystallization, chromatography and the like.<br>
For further details about the preparation of the 3-phenyluracils 1,   reference is made to PCT EP/01/04850, in particular to the preparation examples.<br>
Use Examples<br><br>
The effect of the herbicidal mixtures according to the invention of components A and B and, if appropriate, C on the growth of undesirable plants compared to the herbicidally active compounds alone was demonstrated by the following greenhouse experiments (Examples 1 to 11):<br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were first grown to a height of 3 to 20 cm, depending on the plant habit, and only then treated. Here, the herbicidal compositions were suspended or emulsified in water as distribution medium and sprayed using finely distributing nozzles<br>
The respective components A and B and/or C were formulated as 10% by weight strength emulsion concentrate and introduced to the spray liquor with the amount of solvent system used for applying the active compound. In the examples, the solvent used was water.<br>
The test period extended over 21 days. During this time, the plants were tended, and their response to the treatments with active compound was evaluated.<br>
The evaluation for the damage caused by the chemical compositions was carried out using a scale from 0 to 100%, compared to the untreated control plants. Here, 0 means no damage and 100 means complete destruction of the plants.<br>
In the examples below, the value E which is to be expected if the activity of the individual compounds, i^ just additive was calculated using the method of S. R. Colby (1967) "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations". Weeds 15, p. 22 ff.<br>
E = X + Y - (X-Y/100) where<br>
X = effect in percent using active compound A at an application rate a;<br>
Y = effect in percent using active compound B at an application rate b;<br>
E = expected effect (in %) of A + B at application rates a + b.<br>
If the value calculated in this manner is higher than the value E calculated according to Colby, a synergistic effect is present.<br><br>

Safener action<br>
In the examples below,   the mixtures were  applied by the pre-emergence method.  To this  end,   the test plants were  initially sown  and covered with a thin layer of  soil.  Afterward  (i.e.   prior to the  germination of the test plants),   the mixtures according  to the  invention were  sprayed onto the soil  as  an  aqueous  spray liquor at the  stated application rate.  As   in the post-emergence method described above,  the test period was  21  days.  The  damage was  then evaluated  as described above using a scale  from  0  to 100%  damage  in comparison to untreated control plants   (0% damage).<br>
