Applicant: (a) Ketana Laljibhai Babaria<br>
(b)	Nationality: Indian<br>
(c)	B/137, Harisiddha Park Society Nr. Nav Sarjan School, Ranip,<br>
Ahmedabad 382480. Gujarat<br>
The following specification describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
 <br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel soya products, composition and process for preparation there of<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
It is well known that soya is high in dietary fiber and protein, cholesterol-free, and an excellent source of phytochemicals and minerals like phosphorus, potassium, calcium and iron as well.<br>
Now is an increased awareness among people regarding the benefits of soyabean (soya/ soybean/soy) in diet and keeping that in mind the present invention is prepared to prepare the instant food ready to cook and ready to eat.<br>
It is also known that taking soy isoflavone supplements may not be the same as eating soyfoods as research has shown that the body breaks down the isolated isoflavones in a supplement differently than when they appear in a food. The biological effects of isolated isoflavones may be different from the effects of isoflavones found naturally in food.<br>
Soy is an excellent source of a high quality protein, complete protein which is unique among plant sources provides all essential amino acids not available in any other food.<br>
Also, the yield of protein from soybeans is about twice that of meat, twelve times that of milk and four times that of eggs.<br>
Up to now, soy is by far the best and most complete nutritional beneficial plant food.<br>
After research is also proved that soy helps prevent against cardiovascular disease by suppressing the hardening of artery walls and thus help to protect the human heart. As soya is also cholesterol-free or fat-free, it's an ideal food for the heart, protecting kidneys from damage, destroying while suppressing tumor growth and preventing blood clotting hence prevent cancer, reducing the risk of colon cancer, protecting against prostate and breast cancers caused by hormone imbalance etc.<br>
 <br>
There is evidence suggesting that exposure to soy during childhood and/or adolescence reduces breast cancer risk later in life<br>
High blood pressure and brain infarction (the medical condition that occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is blocked by a blood clot) are two main risk factors of stroke. As soy is rich in potassium, it helps the body to eliminate excessive sodium, and hence lower the risk of stroke.<br>
Soybeans have favorable nutrient profile for heart health, decreasing negative effect of menopause, reduction of cancer, diabetes, kidney diseases and allergies<br>
Soybean is viewed as alternative HRT in large part because it is a unique natural source of Isoflavones<br>
Soy is called the Miracle Bean by National Soybean Research Laboratory, USA.<br>
Soya is the perfect super food by Chan Lee Peng.<br>
Isoflavones have received a great deal of research, especially for possible cancer and heart disease-preventive properties An American Heart Association Science Advisory for Professionals from the Nutrition Committee 2006<br>
World Soybean Research Conference (WSRC) is a regular forum for the world's soybean researchers to exchange research results and development activities<br>
Most people are in confusion to eat right and complete food. More vegetable, more fruits and dry fruits but still they are not complete nutrient and rich food which play role in treating and preventing many types of disease.<br>
It is difficult to choose the healthy and tasty. Soya is the perfect solution. A complete food for vegetarian.<br>
But as being unfavorable in taste no one prefers to eat soya bean in regular diet. The present invention is related to novel soya products, composition and process for preparation there of which are ready to cook or eat or use.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to prepare a composition ready to cook.<br>
 <br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide the composition of soya ready to eat.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide process for preparation of the soya product.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
This invention relates to instant food ready to cook and ready to eat and use prepared using soybean. The invention also relates to process for preparation of the said food.<br>
Detailed Description of The Invention<br>
This invention relates to instant food ready to cook and ready to eat and use prepared using soybean.<br>
Primarily enzyme activity is responsible for the at times unpleasant taste of soybeans. When enzymes are not activated correctly, unacceptable changes can arise in product taste. However, enzyme inactivation runs the risk of destroying valuable soybean phytochemicals. Hence, during the manufacture of instant food from soybean it is necessary to activate soyabean properly to have maximum banifits from soyabean. Generally it is very difficult and expensive to obtain a product that has the full nutritional value as of the original material along with acceptable taste without taste of soybean.<br>
The present invention is to have complete nutrition value and acceptable taste to people, easy to cook and ready to eat and use.<br>
Soaking is actually necessary because it can significantly reduce phytate content, thus making such soy even more healthful. Soaking at least from 6 hours to 16 hours will give good soya food.<br>
It is known that for soya products de-activation of the lipoxygenase enzymes is necessary. In the present invention is taken care that lipoxygenase is completely deactivated.<br>
 <br>
In article of Key Laboratory of Ford Science and Safety; Wuxi 214036, China explains that a microwave oven (2450 MHz) was used as heating source to inactivate soybean lipoxygenase. Variables studied were initial moisture level of the soybean and time of heating. After exposure to microwave, the temperature, the moisture loss, the residual lipoxygenase activity and the nitrogen solubility index (NSI) of the soybeans were determined. No linear relationship was observed between lipoxygenase activity and NSI. Complete inactivation of lipoxygenase in soybeans with moisture content between 26.9 and 56.8% was reached after 210 sec of microwave heating, corresponding to NSI between 49.4 and 39.2%, respectively. The beans with their innate moisture (8.7%) had approximately 98% inactivation of lipoxygenase and 56.1% of NSI after 240 sec of exposure. Thus processed soyabean are safe.<br>
In the present invention preparation first soyabean needs to proceed to de-activate lipoxygenase enzyme by soaking soyabean in hot water. Prior to soaking soyabean is boiled for 3 - 5 hours and let it remain in the same at least for 6 -16 hours, preferably 8 -10 hours to soak,<br>
Then to prepare powder remove the water and dry soyabean either in dryer or in the sun heat or any other possible way till complete moisture removed. Now mill the dried soyabean to get required particle size or mill wet soya at the expected particle size and dry the bland. Particle size in the product of the present invention plays an important role to get expected taste and crispy of the cooked food and hence the particle size of soaybean differs from item to item. The particle size of soyabean ranges from less than lOmicron to 1500micron, preferably 100 - lOOOmicron. To prepare milk, after removing water from the container after soaking, bland soya at least for 10 minutes or more and filter the bland by using water filter sieve or nylon cloth.<br>
In the present invention the products prepared are instant mix composition which can be cooked within 30 minutes to 6 hours. The other products of the present invention are compositions ready to use and ready to eat. The present invention is also providing the process for preparation of the same.<br>
 <br>
In the present invention all products are composition prepared using soyabean and other subsidiary ingredients. To prepare tasty, crispy and nutritive product, in the composition proper proportion of soyabean to other ingredients is to be maintained to get maximum amount soyabean to be used to get its maximum benefit.<br>
Subsidiary ingredients can be grain other than soyabean, spice, dry fruits, dairy products, fruit juice or extracts and the like. Other grain can be suji, rice, mung dal, gram dal or flour, udad dal and the like. The subsidiary ingredients other than grain can be from group but not limited to spice like salt, sugar, chilly, cumin, mustard seed, coriander seed, turmeric, fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi), spice mixture and the like, lemon juice, citric acid or sodium bicarbonate, fruit extract, dry fruits, dairy products selected from milk, butter milk, curd, milk powder and the like, gooseberry, fruit extract can be mango extract and the like, fennel and optionally additional preservatives.<br>
The preparation of instant mix comprises use of soyabean at least 10 - 20%, other grains between 2 - 60%, spices between 0.5 - 7%, dairy product between 0.5 - 50%. Preparation of ready to eat or ready to use comprises use of soyabean at least 10   40%, dairy product 0.5 - 50%, sugar 20 - 50%, dry fruit or fruits or fruit extract 10 - 50%. The same composition can be used if soya is not dried prior to crushed and get it fermented for 30 minutes to 6 - 8 hours. Dried soya will also contain about the similar nutritional value.<br>
The instant mix product in the present invention includes but not limited to idli (idali), dossa, uttapa, dahivada, handvo, khaman, gotta and the like, ready to eat or use product include but not limited to mattho, shrikhand and the like, curd, buttermilk and the like, composition use to prepare cold drink in water or milk etc.<br>
The food prepared from the above composition when fried consumes at least 20 - 40 % less oil.<br>
