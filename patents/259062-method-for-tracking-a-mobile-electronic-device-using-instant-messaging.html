				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The proposed invention provides a method for tracking any mobile electronic device which accesses wireless or wired network using Instant Messaging (IM). The mobile device, capable of instant messenger (IM) functionality, allows storage of one or more IM IDs in a separate non-volatile memory. When the mobile device is lost/stolen, and another person changes the SIM card, the phone verifies if the SIM card is the same as that of the owner by matching the IMSI numbers of the two. If there is a mismatch, the phone triggers the tracking feature. The tracking feature stealthily transmits instant messages to the stored messenger IDs. Furthermore, with video/voice capability in the IM client, there is a provision for transmitting live video/voice of the person using the mobile phone after the tracking feature is enabled as video calls or voice calls respectively.</td>

				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the communication technologies and specifically to user equipment / mobile communication devices. Further, this invention relates to security of mobile communication devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for tracking any mobile communication device using Instant Messaging.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Mobile communications is nowadays becoming an establishing force for social and economic development. The security of the mobile communication device devices is a significant factor in the present scenario.<br>
The existing art involves tracKing of mobile phones by a method with which it detects possible misuse (when the phone is stolen and SIM / USIM replaced), and reports it by itself to the actual owner through SMS or email, without the network making queries. Referring to figure 1 it shows the identity check procedure used in the prior art. The SGSN or MSC sends Identity Request (Identity Type) to the MS and in response to that the MS sends the Identity Response (Mobile Identity). If the SGSN or MSC decides to check the IMEI against the EIR, it sends Check IMEI (IMEI) to EIR. The EIR responds with Check IMEI Ack (IMEI).<br>
Researches   are   going   on   in  this  field   and  the   US   patent  titled,"Mobile<br><br>
communication apparatus having anti-theft and auto-notification functions", describes a mobile communication apparatus comprises a first SIM card, an anti-theft control circuit, and a transmission control circuit. The first SIM card is engaged with the mobile communication apparatus and has a corresponding first IMSI code. The anti-theft control circuit has a SIM-card-detection module and a subscriber information management module. The SIM-card-detection module is used for detecting whether the first SIM card is replaced by a second SIM card and generating a corresponding detection result. The subscriber information management module is used for storing the corresponding first IMSI code and predetermined contact information. The transmission control circuit is used for transmitting data and/or signals. When the SIM-card-detection module generates the detection result, the transmission control circuit will send a notice signal according to the predetermined contact information. However there is no transmission of information through IM facility.<br>
In another patent application titled/'Message automatic notification system, message automatic notification method, communication terminal device, and recording medium", a message automatic notification system sends a message via a communication network to at least another communication terminal devices registered in a communication terminal device. The communication terminal device includes a control circuit, a communication circuit, and a memory unit. The control circuit causes a message-sending condition to be registered in the memory unit, obtains presence information from the other communication terminal device registered in the memory unit via the communication network, judges<br><br>
whether the message-sending condition where a message is sent when the presence information turns to be a predetermined state is established based on the presence information obtained, and sends a message previously registered by a user in the memory unit when judged that the message-sending condition is established. However the publication does not discuss sending notification when a SIM card is replaced.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the proposed invention is to invent a new method for tracking any mobile electronic device using IM without the network making queries, which is unique.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for tracking the electronic device without any extra efforts from the user/operator to track it.<br>
It is yet another object of the proposed invention to provide a method which does not depend on the presence of EIR in the network, providing very efficient and fast way of tracking, compared to the network querying IMEI of all users which still does not guarantee any results.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide transparency to the new user thereby availing him/her to contact the original user from the information displayed in the device when the SIM / USIM card is changed, wherein the<br><br>
proposed system, compared to the current approach of just blocking the phone (if PIN verification fails), facilitates the new user to contact the original user where the former dint have the intention to steal.<br>
The proposed invention involves a method to track stolen mobile phones or any mobile electronic device which supports instant messaging, by making it automatically send instant messages to preset destination whenever the SIM / USIM card is changed or powered up with a different Network card from that of the original user who activated the tracking feature, provided the proposed tracking feature in the device is turned on. The Mobile Station or device checks whether the SIM in the device is changed. Whenever it finds that it is changed, it initiates the instant messaging application (in background) and connects to server to send information about new user secretly to the preset address(User is capable of configuring these parameters easily). This information will be sent to the IM ID stored in the Phone (by the Original user) using Instant Messaging systems. The only assumption is that Mobile would be able to send IM message over SMS or Data bearer. Mobile or device can also trigger live voice or video call for more information to registered IM ID at regular intervals. The invention proposes a method to track the stolen devices with no extra functionality at the network side or IM server side. This method would be really handy because more and more devices are coming with IM application and IM is gaining popularity day by day.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for tracking any mobile communication device using  Instant Messaging  (IM)  by making the device<br><br>
automatically send instant messages to predefined IM user whenever SIM / USIM card is changed or powered up with a different SIM / USIM card.<br>
The information sent to the predefined IM user by the device after initiating the IM application in background includes New Subscriber's number (IMSI), New Subscriber's Location, New Subscriber's Live voice and New Subscriber's Live video. The device provides a menu option with password (Tracking Control Key) protection. The said Tracking Control Key is used to turn on / off the said tracking feature and for editing the destination email-id / phone. The said Tracking Control Key is used for editing the user-defined part of the message contents for sending IM message. The said Tracking Control Key is used for the configuration of Voice and Video calls with periodicity and for the configuration of Location's information periodicity. When the user tries to activate the tracking feature, the user is prompted for the Tracking Control Key. The user is prompted for the alert-message destination and optionally the customizable contents of the alert message when the Tracking Control gets activated. If the user wishes to access / change the alert-message destination and the customizable contents, the user has to input the Tracking Control Key. In the IM message, the Location Information, MSISDN/IMSI of the current user can be included, in addition to any user-defined text. The device voice and video calls to defined user at periodic intervals. The user-authentication info for accessing the IM reporting feature, the destination IM ID, and any predefined text to be sent is stored in NVRAM. When the tracking feature gets activated, for a device supporting SIM / USIM card, the IMSI of the current SIM / USIM card is stored in the NVRAM where if there is no<br><br>
SIM / USIM card, user is prompted to insert SIM / USIM card. Once Tracking Control feature is successfully activated, whenever new SIM card is inserted, the device compares the IMSI stored in the NVRAM with the new IMSI and if there is a mismatch, sends an IM message to the destination which was specified by the owner. The current Location information of the device, if available can be included in the IM message. If the initial attempt to send IM message fails, the device keeps trying periodically until successful where the said period can be configured.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a system for tracking any mobile electronic device using IM by making the device automatically send instant messages to predefined IM user whenever SIM / USIM card is changed or powered up with a different SIM / USIM card. The system includes a Tracking Control Key authentication module which handles activation / deactivation of Tracking Control and accessing the customized information to be sent in the message. The system includes a customization module which maintains the message format and content information. The system includes a SIM / USIM Info access module which gets the required info from SIM / USIM, and detects the change of SIM / USIM card. The system includes a Location Info Access module which gets the information about the current location of the device, if the user has opted for it to be sent in alert message. The system includes a Call Barring Status Check module which, periodically checks it the status is changed, for sending alert message if outgoing call is barred. The system includes an Info Display module which displays the current settings. The system includes Network-access check module triggers the alert SMS for devices which don't use SIM card, when the<br><br>
device is connected to a network. The system includes a camera module for taking the pictures or Video Clip when a new SIM Card is inserted, as part of the MMS message to be sent to pre-defined destination. The system includes an Instant Messaging module which has instant Messaging application which can connect with IM server using SMS and Data Bearers.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction yvith the aqcompanying drawings.<br>
