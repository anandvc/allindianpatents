The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Inventions belong to the field of electro-chemical metal processing, namely to micro plasma treatment in electrolyte solutions, and can be applied in machine-building and other industries.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
One of the problems related to industrial application of micro plasma (micro arc, plasma-electrolyte) oxidation method is its significant energy consumption. At present there are no power supplies that would allow treating large-sized parts or simultaneously processing a large number of parts.<br>
Attempts have been made to reduce energy consumption of the process or apply coating to large-sized parts. Some of those attempts were aimed at selecting electric power supply modes to minimize energy expenditure; others involved mechanical displacement of parts, such as, for instance, motion of parts in relation to each other, counter electrode movement in relation to the processed part or gradual immersion into electrolyte, i.e. stage-by-stage part treatment.<br>
There is a method (RU 2218454 C2, 2003) for obtaining wear-resistant coatings, where a technological electrical insulating layer of inorganic compounds is formed on the base surface before micro arc oxidation. Such layer allows for electric energy saving by ensuring lower energy input into formation of an outer porous technological layer and by reducing starter currents.<br>
The disadvantage of this method is a need to apply electric insulating inorganic barrier, which results in abrupt processabiiity and productivity drop and increases the costs of obtaining a coating. Inorganic insulating barrier is to be uniform all over the part, which is technologically difficult to achieve, and this barrier is relatively hard to apply to irregular shaped parts. Therefore, impossibility of ensuring uniform electric insulating barrier on irregular shaped parts does not allow obtaining high-quality homogeneous coatings by micro arc method, because irregular electric density results in nonuniform coating thickness.<br>
There is a method (RU 2006531 CI, 1994) of electrolyte micro arc application of silicate coating to aluminum parts, which consists in immersing 5-10% of surface area of said part into electrolyte, while further immersion is carried out evenly at a certain speed,<br><br>
depending on  initial current density and total surface area of the part.  Initial current magnitude is J 000 A. which allows applying a 10-20 times less potent supply source.<br>
Improvement of the above-mentioned method is a method, stipulated in (RU 2065895 C1, 1996), where stage-by-stage immersion of the part is carried out.<br>
There is a method (RU 2149929 C1, 2000; US 6238540 B1, 2001), aimed at obtaining high-quality coating for extended surface of a processed large-sized part or for a large number of small parts simultaneously. It is done by facilitating the generation of micro plasma discharges and ensuring their stable combustion. Immersion is stage-by-stage in this process. First, the area is determined depending on the power output; then further immersion, till full submersion of the part, is carried out keeping current magnitude between the electrodes within certain limits.<br>
Gradual immersion of the part into electrolyte causes stage-by-stage expansion of an active micro-arc discharge zone, which can result in heterogeneous distribution of energy input into bare surface depending on time and, correspondingly, in heterogeneous coating properties, i.e. in obtaining Jow-quaJity coating- Parts, which were initially placed into solution, will have larger thickness. The whole article passes through electrolyte-air interface, which also causes coating defects. When parts are irregular shaped, it is impossible to ensure constant current density, as it is unpredictable in this case.<br>
There is a method of obtaining protective coatings on the surface of metals and alloys (RU 2194804 C2, 2000), where operational device is moved along the processed surface, and device is equipped with electrode and porous screen, through which liquid electrolyte is brought in. The authors underline that unlike existing oxidation methods, where power supplies enduring current of up to 500 A are used to maintain requested current density, the suggested method is based on the use of 2 kW device, ensuring necessary process parameters to apply coating to large-sized parts.<br>
Disadvantage of this method is a need to use a manipulator, which is to move along the surface of the part. This is especially problematic, when coating is applied to irregular shaped parts, containing holes, cavities etc. Despite the theoretic possibility of applying coatings to large surfaces, this method, however, does it at the expense of increasing the required time. Besides, a crucial disadvantage of applying small cathodes is the fact that when voltage is applied, cathode is polarized to a larger extent than the processed part. As a. result significant energy loss at cathode takes place and efficient electric energy use is decreased.<br><br>
There is a method for electrolytic micro arc coating application to parts made of valve metal (RU 2171865 C1, 2000), designed to obtain coatings on large-sized parts when using low-power supplies. In this method the electrode is given a specific form and an area much smaller than the area of a processed part. Coating application is carried out by electrode scanning along the surface of the part or simultaneous motion of electrode and processed part in relation to each other.<br>
Disadvantage of this method is a need for additional equipment (manipulator), and it is impossible to process irregular shaped parts. From electrochemical point of view, economical processes are viable, when area of processed part is smaller than cathode area. In this case cathode is weakly polarized. If cathode surface is smaller than the surface of processed part, then the main voltage drop takes place on cathode and anode is weakly polarized. Speed of coating formation in this case is reduced and the time requirement increases, as it is necessary to apply coating of a given thickness on one part segment and then move cathode to a different segment. This worsens processability and productivity of this method.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The task of the present invention is to develop a method for obtaining coatings by micro plasma oxidation on large-sized parts, including irregular shaped parts, or simultaneously on a large number of smaller parts.<br>
Another task of invention is to develop device, capable of processing parts with larger surface area using low-power supplies. Device design is determined by specific features of the method.<br>
In order to carry out the task, the suggested method for obtaining coating on parts in the micro plasma oxidation mode involves immersion of the processed part into electrolyte solution, while hermetically sealed container is pre-filled with electrolyte. The process involves micro plasma discharge generation on the surface of said part in low-pressure conditions over electrolyte solution and consequent coating formation.<br>
In suggested electrolyte micro plasma system the liquid boiling temperature decreases, when the pressure goes down. When electric current goes through the surface of the part, temperature of the near-electrode layer increases, which leads to vapor bubble formation on the surface; these bubbles block part of treated surface, leading to barrier layer formation and<br><br>
decrease in surface area available for electrode reaction. Current magnitude decreases, thus resulting in starter currents decrease.<br>
As far as gas bubbles move along the surface and take off, there is no complete surface blockage, which allows gradually treating the whole surface of the part. In the place, where oxide layer was formed, bubble formation is less likely, because electric current in this area does not go through and electro-chemical and micro plasma process moves to a different segment on the surface of the part.<br>
Surface blockage is also due to evolved gas. When electric current passes through, gas release is observed in water electrolyte on the basis of reaction:<br>
40H = 2H2O+ O3 ↑ - 4e" - on anode,<br>
2H+ + 2e = H2 ↑- on cathode.<br>
Initially evolved gas is on the surface of processed part, blocking it for electrode reactions and resulting in formation of a layer with increased resistance (surface decreases).<br>
If one decreases pressure in the system, then evolved gas on electrodes starts to occupy larger volume (the same gas quantity under low pressure occupies larger volume), in accordance with Mendeleyev-Clapeyron law:<br>
M = m/μRT = PV.<br>
This leads to blockage of a larger surface area and, correspondingly, reduction in currents at initial moment of the process.<br>
It is advisable to perform micro plasma discharge generation under the conditions of low pressure equal to that of electrolyte gas.<br>
Further coating formation can take place at atmospheric - or higher than atmospheric - pressure, for instance, at 1-2 atm.<br>
Micro plasma oxidation can be carried out in pulse mode or in asymmetric sinusoidal mode or in sinusoidal mode of processed part polarization.<br>
One more inventive subject matter is a device for carrying out the above-mentioned method. The device comprises the following: hermetically sealed container for electrolyte, -equipped with means for creating vacuum (low pressure) in container; power supply with two clamps; first electrode, immersed in electrolyte, including at least one processed part and connected to the first power supply clamp; and second electrode, immersed in electrolyte or containing electrolyte, when container is used for electrolyte as a second electrode, and connected to the second power supply clamp.<br><br>
Moreover, the device comprises means for feeding compressed air into container.<br>
It is advisable to equip electrolyte container with a cover, having compaction for its hermeticaj sealing.<br>
It is also advisable that the second electrode be immersed in electrolyte and serve as a cathode.<br>
It is easier to understand and examine the method studying the detailed description, provided later on, with references to examples and drawings, which represent the following:<br>

A PREFERABLE MODE FOR EMBODYING THE INVENTION<br>
Processed part as one of electrodes (anode) and the second electrode (cathode) are placed into container with electrolyte solution; container is hermetically sealed, electrodes are connected to power supply.<br>
First, pressure in the system is pumped out to reach the pressure of liquid vapors (lower level does not make sense, as it leads to electrolyte boiling).<br>
Then power supply is switched on, gas bubbles are formed on the surface of the part. They block part of processed surface, then micro plasma discharges are generated and oxide-ceramic layer is formed on the surface.<br>
As thickness of oxide-ceramic layer increases, pressure in the system can be increased up to atmospheric level by letting the gas in, and necessary coating thickness can be formed under normal conditions.<br><br>
The increase in pressure over the atmospheric level leads to decrease in volume occupied by evolved gas on the surface of the part (the gas is released in pores), partially opening the surface, and this allows applying thicker coatings.<br>
Micro plasma oxidation in pulse mode of processed part polarization is preferable.<br>
Evidence is provided by experimentally obtained current and voltage pulse values, as well as voltammetric curves determined on their basis with the use of computer measurement system (CMS), described in detail in (RU 2284517 Cl, 2006).<br>
In order to obtain the value of voltammetric curve, trapezoidal voltage pulse (fig. 4) with ascending OA and descending BC segments was used. CMS records relevant current pulse (fig. 5) and thus., knowing values of current and voltage at certain moments of time on descending and ascending parts of voltage pulse, one can obtain dependence of current on voltage (Fig. 6).<br>
Fig. 6 represents voltammetric curve, where current value lm corresponds to current maximum in Fig. 5. Value ln corresponds to active current (at this moment dU/dt = 0) and value of the system capacity current lt=0 (C - pseudo-capacity, S - area) corresponds to site current in Fig. 6.<br>
Active current is a base value for identifying the quality of energy, spent in the process: P=U0Int, where U0 is maximum voltage pulse, ln is current pulse site, t is pulse duration. Therefore, decrease in current magnitude indicates change in spent energy at invariable values of maximum applied voltage and pulse duration.<br>
Device for implementing the method (Fig. 1) comprises container 1 with electrolyte solution 2, hermetic cover 3 for container 1 and compaction system 4. Processed part 5 as one of electrodes (anode) and the second electrode 6 (cathode) are placed in container 1; they are both designed to connect to power supply 7. Device comprises vacuum pump 8 and force pump 9, designed to connect to container 1, for instance, by connecting pipes (not shown), located in hermetic cover 3.<br>
Device functions in the following way:<br>
Processed part 5 as anode and cathode 6 are placed into container 1 with electrolyte solution 2 and are connected to power supply clamps 7. Before connecting electrodes to power supply, vacuum is created under cover 3 (low pressure) by vacuum pump 8. Pulse power supply with 50 Hz frequency, voltage of up to 600 V and rectangular pulse duration of 50-1000 mcs , as well as power supply with sinusoidal current type of 50 Hz frequency and voltage of up to 600 V were used to generate micro plasma discharges. Subsidiary electrode (cathode) was made of stainless steel.<br><br>
Example I. In order to obtain oxide-ceramic coating of the sample (processed part) 5 made of aluminum alloy with surface area of 3.8 cm2, the sample was placed into electrolyte 2. Container 1 was hermetically sealed and vacuum was created by vacuum pump 8 under the cover 3. Low pressure was made equal to electrolyte vapor pressure (three-component phosphate-borate electrolyte). Then power supply 7 was connected to electrodes. Applied voltage of 300 V, anode mode (current density of 100-300 A/dm2), pulse duration of 200 mcs. Micro plasma discharges were generated on sample surface and oxide-ceramic coating was formed.<br>
Example 2. Under the same conditions, oxide-ceramic coating was obtained on a similar sample, but under atmospheric pressure (force-pump 9 was used to obtain atmospheric pressure). Fig. 2a shows voltammetric curves of above-mentioned processes at the time point of 3 minutes: curve 1 without vacuum, curve 2 under vacuum conditions.<br>
Curve comparison demonstrates that current of the process in vacuum is significantly lower than current of the process under atmospheric pressure.<br>
Example 3. All conditions of the process are analogous to conditions in examples J and 2, except for the fact that coating was applied to sample made of titanium alloy (with surface area of 3.8 cm2). Fig. 2b shows comparative voltammetric curves of processes in vacuum and under atmospheric pressure.<br>
Curve comparison demonstrates that current of the process in vacuum is lower than current of the process under atmospheric pressure.<br>
Example 4. All conditions of the process are analogous to conditions in example 3.' Fig. 3a and 3b show comparative voltammetric curves of processes for the period of 15 minutes, in vacuum (3b) and under atmospheric pressure (3a), confirming the presence of lower current magnitudes in the course of the process of applying coating in vacuum.<br>
Fig. 7a shows surface microphotographs of the sample made of titanium alloy, processed under atmospheric pressure, and Fig. 7b shows surface microphotographs of the analogous sample processed in vacuum for the period of 1 minute. Comparative analysis demonstrates that coating is applied more uniformly in vacuum.<br>
Example 5. In the course of 2 minutes coating was formed under conditions of example 3 and coating thickness was measured. Coating thickness of the sample processed in vacuum was 12 micron and it was 20 micron without vacuum. In order to form thicker coatings and accelerate coating application, pressure was increased to atmospheric level.<br>
Example 6. In order to obtain oxide-ceramic coating on the sample (processed part) 5 made of titanium alloy with surface area of 3.8 cm , the said sample was placed in electrolyte<br><br>
2. Container 1 was hermetically sealed and vacuum pump 8 was used to create vacuum under cover 3. Low pressure was set equal to electrolyte vapor pressure (water solution NaOH, concentration of 100 g/1). Then power supply 7 with sinusoidal current type was connected to electrodes. Applied voltage was 300 V, frequency was 50 Hz. Micro plasma discharges were generated on sample surface and oxide-ceramic coating was formed.<br>
The table lists comparative values of current density for processes in pulse (example 4) and sinusoidal modes in vacuum and without vacuum for the period of 15 minutes with the same applied voltage.<br>
Table<br><br>
The table demonstrates that reduction of currents takes place both in pulse and in sinusoidal modes of oxide-ceramic coating formation.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As noted before, one of the problems of industrial application of micro arc oxidation method is its high energy consumption. Suggested method of vacuum-compression micro plasma oxidation (VCMPOj vacuumizes electrolytic micro plasma system and thus creates conditions for reduction of currents both at the initial moment and in the course of further coating formation. This allows reducing power supply load and decreasing power intensity of the process, thus increasing the surface of processed parts. Additional technical effect consists in obtaining more homogeneous coatings.<br><br>
