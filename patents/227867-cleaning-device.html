				<td>The present invention relates to cleaning device.<br>
More specifically, the invention attempts to provide a practical solution to problems associated with the use of a conventional bristie-based toilet brush. A disadvantage of a conventional toilet brush is that the brush bristies are arranged in groups of individual filaments in close proximily, which encourages the collection and retention of soil particles removed from the toilet bowl surface during cleaning. The task of cleaning the soiled brush, for the user, can be both difficult and unpleasant. Another disadvantage is that the brush is intended to be re-usable and, over time, the difficulty in cleaning the bristie head, can result in the build up of particles that is both unsightly and a hygiene risk. This effect also reduces the device's ongoing cleaning efficacy, and deters potential user(s) from undertaking required cleaning tasks with the tool.<br>
In many cases the brush bristies are attached to the brush head by metal staples which is problematic because of the corrosive environment of the <br>
toilet. Bleach and cleaning chemicals are typically present in the toilet and any of these can cause corrosion of these staples leading to unsighdy brown discoloration of the bristies. Furthermore, the standard arrangement of bristies within the brush head has a tendency to retain water between the <br>
individual bristie filaments, when submerged during use. As a result, it is not-unusual for water which may be soiled, to visibly collect witiiin the brush holding receptacle in which the brush head at least is located when not in use.<br>
In an attempt to overcome the problems identified above, several proposed designs have been documented. Many of tiiese incorporate a handle having a disposable cleaning "head" which is intended to be flushed away after use. However, problems encountered widi such designs include the fact diat the configuration of the head and the handle are such that the user requires a significant amount, of dexterity to attach the two elements together before<br><br><br><br>
use as the user has to accurately align the head orcleaning member with the end of the handle before attachment can be made, and this can be difficult, especially for the elderly or infirm.<br>
Furthermore in the prior art documents the cleaning head typically has a design which is unsatisfactory when needing to clean regions of the toilet which are difficult to reach, for example, underneath a rim of a toilet. In addition, following use of such devices, it is necessary for the user to manually remove the soiled cleaning head from the end of the handle, which is both unpleasant and very unhygienic. Furthermore, due to die shape of prior art cleaning heads, the head when disposed of can be difficult to flush and can even result in blockage of the toilet.<br>
In order to be flushable, the head must pass through the toilet waste pipe, through the sewage pipe system, and arrive at the entrance of the treatment works without, at any point, causing damage or mechanical blockage.<br>
Some of the prior art documents rely upon either total, or partial, disintegration/solubility of the cleaning head in water, to allow the head, and in some cases, an attached handle, to flush away. The breakdown rate of water sensitive materials (e.g. short paper fibre) and water soluble materials (e.g. polyvinyl alcohol) are significantly affected by two key factors, i.e. water temperature, and the level and duration of agitation (pressure/stress/time). Additionally, the presence of certain chemicals in the toilet water, for example bleach and cleaning acids, can also affect the breakdown rate of certain water sensitive materials. These variables, and particularly the inevitable variation in time involved in each cleaning task which is estimated at between approximately ten seconds to about two minutes, make it virtually impossible to devise one material that will break up precisely at the end of each toilet cleaning session. Hence, it is clearly important that the material does not breakdown before the task is completed, as this premature breakdown is lilcely to leave residual material in contact with the reusable handle, as well as failing to adequately complete the cleaning task.<br><br>
Previous designs exist which feature a flushable head that has a pocket-like configuration. Such a shape would, material thickness allowing, fit under the toilet rim. However, this pocket design is based upon a friction fit arrangement where a straight reusable handle is loaded into one end of the disposable cleaning component. This fixing arrangement is common to most prior art designs referred to above. It has been noted, however, that such a design has a key limitation. Given the restrictions in component size to achieve flushability, the aperture to accept the tip of the reusable handle must also be small, or in the case of the pocket design, naturally closed.<br>
In the interest of personal hygiene it is highly desirable that the user does not need to make direct contact, or contact in close proximity to, any part of the reusable handle that has made previous contact with a soiled head, or toilet water. It is therefore given that the user will hold only the end of the reusable handle that is intended for grip. This necessitates a level of accuracy and dexterity in component loading that is believed to be at best awkward, if not unacceptably difficult, without the additional complexity and cost of an automatic loading/ guiding mechanism.<br>
The aim of the present invention is therefore to address the above problems and to provide a re-usable cleaning device which is simple to use and hygienic.<br>
It is a further aim of the invention that the cleaning head be instantly fiushable on completion of the cleaning task. Hence, the incorporation of a disposable cleaning head, which offers the maximum amount of cleaning surface area within the geometric constraints of what is easily fiushable is an aim of the invention.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cleaning device including a handle adapted to be held by a user, a flushable cleaning member selectively attached thereto via attachment means on the handle, said handle incorporating a cleaning member ejection means operable by the user to detach the cleaning member from the handle to allow disposal of the cleaning member after use and wherein the cleaning<br><br>
member has a cleaning surface and an opposing attachment surface and said attachment means attaches to the attachment surface of the cleaning member.<br>
In one embodiment the attachment means lies substantially parallel with the attachment surface of the cleaning member.<br>
*<br>
Thus there is provided a cleaning device including a handle adapted to be held by a user, and a flushable cleaning member selectively attached thereto and wherein said handle incorporates a cleaning member ejection means operable by the user to detach the cleaning member from the handle to allow disposal of the cleaning member.<br>
Typically the cleaning device is used to clean a toilet.<br>
Preferably, the cleaning member is substantially planar. By the term "planar", we mean the cleaning member has a thin wall thickness between opposing first and second surfaces, the first surface provided for the cleaning action and the second surface provided to allow attachment to the cleaning means handle. Preferably, the cleaning member is substantially planar at the time of attachment to the handle. The cleaning member may be flat or curved prior to attachment and in one embodiment, by attachment, may be moved to a flat or curved condition.<br>
Preferably, the cleaning member is flexible and conformable to the surface shape which is being cleaned thereby allowing the member to clean all areas of the toilet. Preferably this is possible when the cleaning member is dry and water is not required to soften the same.<br>
Advantageously, this improves the versatility of the device for cleaning regions or areas, which are otherwise hard to reach if the cleaning member is three-dimensional. Also, many people clean the dry areas of the toilet such as around the rim before they clean the lower wet areas in the bowl. Advantageously, and preferably, the maximum surface of the cleaning member is useable for cleaning whilst still being flushable whole.<br><br>
Although varying in precise shape and dimensions, the majority of toilets comprise three common elements that require regular cleaning, i.e. a rim, a bowl section, and a waste pipe/trap section. The present invention provides a disposable cleaning member which has a cleaning surface and an opposing attachment surface. The cleaning surface at least, is sufficiently conformable and therefore versatile to effectively clean each of the three toilet elements identified above. Most previous designs of cleaning member rely upon a three-dimensional cylindrical, conical, or hemispherical-shaped disposable head. These shapes are only beneficial if they are sufficiently flexible to make contact with the bowl of the toilet and providing sufficient force is applied thereto. Disadvantageously, such excessive force results in the material of these heads ripping.<br>
Preferably, the part of the handle to which the cleaning member is attached is resilient and may comprise a flexible material, for example, rubber or the like. Alternatively and preferably the second end may be articulated so as to allow movement of the attachment means about at least one axis of rotation, but preferably in more than one axis which allows the cleaning end of the device to reach awkward regions of the toilet, such as under the rim or in the base of the bowl of the toilet<br>
Typically the attachment means of the handle, in addition to allowing the effective attachment of the cleaning member with the same, is provided with articulation means to allow articulation of the cleaning member and attachment means as a unit with respect to the handle. This, in conjunction with the fact that the attachment means can be provided to be conformable, along with the cleaning member, to the contours of the surface which is being cleaned and that the attachment means is located with a sufficient portion of a surface of the cleaning member to allow the load or force applied via the handle to be spread across the cleaning member, ensures that the cleaning effect of the cleaning member is uniform across the cleaning surface of the same and hence provides an effective cleaning action.<br><br>
Preferably, the handle includes attachment means which are adapted to engage with the cleaning member, preferably upon contact therewith and alignment means can be provided to allow the attachment of the handle with the cleaning member to be aligned, typically substantially centrally with the cleaning member. Advantageously, central alignment enables a greater surface area of the cleaning member to be utilised and in a balanced manner.<br>
Preferably, the attachment means is adapted to automatically engage with the cleaning member, preferably on contact therewith. In one embodiment the attachment means include at least one hook or loop means, which hook or loop means is adapted to engage with at least one hook or loop means provided on the cleaning member. Typically a plurality of spaced apart hooks or loop are provided on each of the cleaning member and handle. Preferably, the attachment means extend substantially perpendicular away from the handle attachment means to provide the required amount of vertical grip on the cleaning member, and a required amount of, typically greater, shear grip on the cleaning member. Hence, the attachment is able to withstand a substantial amount of sideways force and yet it is relatively easy to disengage the cleaning member from the attachment means.<br>
An advantage of the cleaning device as herein described is that it is very simple to attach to the second end of the device, i.e. by bringing the handle attachment means into contact with the cleaning member as opposed to prior art systems, which require greater dexterity and typically deformation of the cleaning member to grip the same which can result in the cleaning member being less efficient.<br>
In one embodiment, the cleaning device may comprise first and second arms, which arms are preferably attached together by a pivot. Preferably, each arm has a first end and a second end. Preferably, the arms are adapted to be pivoted between a first configuration in which the first ends of the arms are substantially apart and in which the second ends of the arms are substantially together, and a second configuration in which the first ends of the arms are substantially together and in which the second end of the arms are substantially apart, preferably in a tongs arrangement. Biasing means<br><br>
adapted to bias the arms in the first configuration can be provided. The biasing means can be in the form of a spring. In this embodiment the fkst end of each arm is adapted to be held by a user, preferably in a hand thereof. The second end of the first arm includes the attachment means, which is adapted to engage with the cleaning member typically when the arms are in the first configuration. Hence, a user may hold the first ends of the arms when in the first configuration and bring the second end of the first arm into contact with the cleaning member. In one embodiment the second end of the second arm is adapted to fit substantially inside the second end of the first arm, such that when the arms are in the second configuration, the attachment means is exposed for contact with the cleaning member.<br>
In this embodiment, the second end of the second arm is adapted to eject the cleaning member when the arms are moved from the first configuration to the second configuration. In use the user can urge the first ends of the arms together thereby causing them to pivot, thereby causing the second ends of the arms apart. The second end of the second arm is urged against the cleaning member thereby detaching the cleaning member away from the second end of the first arm.<br>
In a further and preferred embodiment, the part of the handle to be gripped by the user includes a movable part or is compressible and is adapted to be compressed or moved selectively by a user.<br>
Typically, the part of the handle for attachment with the cleaning member includes the ejection means, which is located adjacent the attachment means. In one embodiment the ejection means is in the form of a resilient member. Preferably, the resilient member is located substantially in the centre of the attachment means with the attachment means surrounding the ejection means. In one embodiment the ejection means is a resilient diaphragm.<br>
Preferably, the ejection means is adapted to move between a first position in which the same is not in contact with the cleaning member, and a second position in which the ejection means contacts the cleaning member and<br><br>
moves away from the attachment means to push the cleaning member away from the attachment means. Preferably, when in the first position, the ejection means is disposed substantially inside the second end of the handle. Preferably, the ejection means is adapted to eject the cleaning member when it is moved from the first to second position by the user manipulation of the movement or compressible means on the handle which is mechanically connected to the ejection means along the handle. In one embodiment the ejection means is a resilient member in a chamber within the handle.<br>
Typically the device includes a handle having a first end adapted to be held by a user and a second end with attachment means adapted to engage with the cleaning member. Preferably, the attachment means is located around the circumference of the second end of the handle. Preferably, the handle includes sliding means adapted to slide within the handle under manual influence with the ejection means for the cleaning member connected to part of the sliding means.<br>
Preferably, the device comprises biasing means adapted to bias the sliding means in the first configuration. Preferably, the biasing means comprises a spring.<br>
In one embodiment the device includes a magazine in which a plurality of said cleaning members are provided for selective removal from the magazine when attached to the handle of the device. Typically the handle with the attachment means portion exposed is placed into the magazine to allow the attachment means to contact and attach the exposed cleaning member in the magazine to remove the same therefrom.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a cleaning member for use with a cleaning device for a toilet bowl said cleaning member being substantially planar and fiushable for disposal in the toilet bowl.<br>
Preferably, the cleaning member is substantially planar at least at the time of attachment to the cleaning device but preferably retains the substantially<br><br>
planar shape during use due to an inherent resilience of the cleaning member and/or support from the attachment means on the surface of the cleaning member to which the attachment means is applied.<br>
The cleaning member is typically in the form of a cleaning member. The cleaning member may be fibrous, preferably at points of contact with the attachment means of the cleaning device. In one embodiment the cleaning member may comprise a foam-like material including at least one void therein.<br>
The cleaning member can be substantially oblong or rectangular and typically a rectangular cleaning member is more flushable than, for example, a square or circular cleaning member of similar dimensions, as these latter shapes have a tendency to block the toilet outflow pipe. This is due to the fact that with the two opposing sides significantly longer than the other two opposing sides, then in the rectangular format, the natural orientation of the cleaning member in the flow is for one of the shorter edges to lead in the direction of movement.<br>
Preferably, the width of the cleaning member is less than 60mm, more preferably, less than 55mm and, most preferably less than 50mm. The length of the cleaning member is less than 120mm, preferably less than 100mm, more preferably, less than 90mm and, most preferably less than 80mm. The length of the cleaning member is preferably a minimum of 130% of thecleaning member width, and more preferably a minimum of 150%.Typically the cleaning member is no more than 30mm thick and preferably up to 15mm in thickness.<br>
Preferably the cleaning member is of a single layer construction.<br>
Preferably any cleaning chemicals added to the cleaning member are semi-dry, or more definitively remain in a liquid state however concentrated when all water has been driven away by heat. This ensures that any water that makes contact with the stack of cleaning members and subsequently evaporates, does not allow the cleaning members to 'fuse' together in use, as<br><br>
they could if the cleaning chemical was inherently dry or solid when all water has been driven away.<br>
Preferably the majority and more preferably 100% of the cleaning member's dry weight constituents are either natural mineral or biodegradable in conditions found within sewage treatment works and the sewer system.<br>
Preferably the cleaning member is substantially formed of materials that are not readily water soluble or water degradable (i.e. within 5 minutes in water at less than 25 degrees C).<br>
Preferably the cleaning member is manufactured by spray-applying an aqueous dispersion of polymer binder onto a non-woven fibre substrate.<br>
Preferably the fibre is cellulosic<br>
Preferably the fibre has a minimum titre of substantially 15 dtex.<br>
Preferably me resin binder is inadsorbent, and more preferably inadsorbent and biodegradable, and more preferably is a starch polymer, an aliphatic polyester, or combination of both.<br>
Preferably the abrasive is considered 'non-scratch' on a porcelain surface and is non-reactive with acidic cleaning chemicals.<br>
Preferably the single web of fibre should be coated with 0-300 gsm spray solids (dry resin &amp; mineral / filler) on the engagement side, and 100-500 gsm dry solids on the cleaning surface.<br>
Preferably the fibre element of the cleaning member structure comprises a substantial percentage by weight of substantially adsorbent fibres, and more preferably a minimum of 30% adsorbent cellulosic fibre.<br>
Alternatively, the cleaning member may be of a multi-layer construction including any combination of engagement layer, soil barrier layer and<br><br>
cleaning layer. The engagement layer attaches to the handle and comprises a woven loop scrim or an open structured nonwoven fibre web. The soil barrier layer reduces risk of contamination of the handle and comprises a fine titre (less than 3 dtex) closely formed non-woven web, or continuous flexible film. The cleaning layer provides abrasion and absorbency and comprises coarse fibre (at least 15 dtex) or a blend with fine fibre (less than 3 dtex), with or without additional spray-applied resin-bound abrasive.<br>
The cleaning member can in one embodiment include at least one aperture, slot, channel or cut-out to facilitate the deformation during cleaning and thereafter improve the flush-ability thereof following cleaning.<br>
The cleaning member may comprise a plurality of smaller cleaning members which are, preferably held in position by the attachment means of the handle. In this embodiment the smaller cleaning members are detached separately for disposal and flush easier than a single larger cleaning member.<br>
According to a further aspect, there are provided storage means for supporting at least one cleaning device defined herein when not in use and for storing a plurality of cleaning members as defined herein and wherein the storage means includes a guide to allow the guided introduction of the handle into contact with the cleaning members so as to allow the attachment of the handle and a cleaning member to form the cleaning device for use.<br>
Preferably the storage means includes a separation means to facilitate the attachment of individual cleaning members to the handle in use.<br>
According to a yet further aspect, there is provided a cleaning device having a handle with a first part adapted to be held by a user, and a second part adapted for attachment of a cleaning member said device including cleaning member ejection means adapted for selective operation by the user of the device to act against the engagement of the attachment means and the handle and force the cleaning member from the attachment means to allow the cleaning member to be removed for disposal.<br><br>
In one embodiment the actuation means for the ejection means is located at the portion of the handle gripped by the user and mechanical actuation is used. In an alternative embodiment a fluid is displaced from the handle gripping part to the attachment means on the handle such that the cleaning member is ejected from the attachment means of the device. In one embodiment the fluid is contained within the device, preferably the body thereof and in one embodiment the fluid is air or is a liquid. In one embodiment the fluid is displaced by a piston-cylinder arrangement wherein the handle includes a cylinder having a piston slideably mounted therein. The ejection means can include a resilient member, which preferably comprises a resilient diaphragm.<br>
In which ever embodiment of the invention, the ejection means in the first position is disposed substantially inside the handle of the device.<br>
According to a further aspect, there is provided a cleaning device comprising a handle having a first end adapted to be held by a user and a second end adapted to have a cleaning member attached thereto, and sliding means adapted to move between a first configuration in which the sliding means is not in contact with the cleaning member, and a second configuration in which the sliding means contacts the cleaning member.<br>
Preferably, the sliding means is adapted to eject the cleaning member when it is moved from the first to second configuration. The body may comprise a first cylinder. The sliding means may comprise a second cylinder mounted on to the body. Preferably, the second cylinder is adapted to slide along the body. Alternatively, the sliding means may comprise a member slideably mounted inside the body, one end adapted to slide over the attachment means but not the cleaning member to eject the cleaning member, the other end including a button projecting through the body to allow the user to operate the same.<br>
All of the features described herein may be combined with any of the above aspects, in any combination.<br><br>

Referring to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown a first embodiment of a domestic cleaning device 2 which can be used for cleaning household furniture, in particular the interior of a toilet bowl (not shown). Second and third embodiments of the cleaning device 2 are shown in Figure 3 and 4, and Figure 5 and 6, respectively. In each embodiment, the device 2 consists of a handle 4 and a fibrous non-woven cleaning member 6, examples of which are illustrated in various embodiments in Figure 8.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the handle 4 of the device 2 consists of an upper member 8 and a lower member 10 connected together by a hinge 12 which allows respective movement of the upper and lower members 8,10. In the first embodiment of the device 2, the bringing together by a user of the upper and lower members 8,10 on one side of the hinge 12, results in the upper and lower members 8,10 being urged apart on the other side of die hinge 12.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, an underside of the upper member 8 forms an attachment plate 28, which consists of a series of small downwardly facing hooks illustrated as arrows 28a. The hooks 28a of the attachment plate 28 engage with fibres and/or voids 38 which make up the cleaning member 6 so that the cleaning member 6 is attached thereto. Embodiments of the cleaning member 6 are illustrated in Figure 8 and are described hereinafter. The cleaning member is either woven or non-woven material, or a foam material.<br>
In use, a user first arranges the upper and lower members 8,10 of the handle 4 at the positions where they are gripped such that they are urged apart, This is facilitated by a spring mechanism (not shown) or a natural bias by design which ensures that the device 2 is always ready for use by a user for convenience. This ensures that the upper and lower members 8,10 on the opposite side of the hinge 12 are forced together. The user then very simply touches an upper region of a cleaning member 6 with the attachment plate 28 of the handle 4 so that the cleaning member 6 is attached thereto as illustrated in Figure 9. The cleaning member 6 shown in Figure 9 is just one<br><br>
ot the embodiments of the cleaning member 6 possible. Other embodiments of the cleaning member 6 are shown in Figure 7 and 8.<br>
The hooks 28a hook onto and around the fibres 38 or voids of the cleaning member 6. Because the cleaning member 6 forms a relatively large fibrous area, it is very easy for the user to attach the cleaning member 6 to the handle 4 requiring very little dexterity. Hence, the elderly or infirm are able to use the device 2 with ease. An advantage of this mechanism is that there is no need for the user to touch the cleaning member 6 as it is being attached to the handle 4. When attached together, the cleaning member 6 and handle 4 form the complete cleaning device 2 which can be used to clean a toilet. The cleaning member 6 is flat and substantially two-dimensional and is therefore suitable for cleaning regions of a toilet which are difficult to reach, for example, around the underside of the rim.<br>
Following use of the cleaning member 6, the user then simply ejects the cleaning member 6 from the attachment plate 28 of the handle 4. This is achieved by squeezing together the upper and lower members 8,10 of the handle 4 at the point where they are held by the user, as illustrated by arrow 'A' in Figure 2. This results in the sections of the upper and lower members 8,10 of the handle 4 on the opposite side of the hinge 12 being forced apart. The result of this is that the lower handle member 10 is urged against the cleaning member 6 in a direction as shown by arrow B in Figure 2, with sufficient force to unhook the hooks 28a of the attachment plate 28 from the fibres/voids 38 of the cleaning member 6. The cleaning member 6 is physically urged away from the underside of the handle 4 in a desired direction, for example, into the bowl of the toilet. An advantage of this mechanism is that there is no need for the user to touch the cleaning member 6 at all once it has been used to clean the toilet. Therefore, use of the device 2 is hygienic and safe.<br>
Referring to Figures 3 and 4, there is shown a second embodiment of the cleaning device 2. The handle 4 consists of a bulbous head section 14, which tapers into a central rigid neck section 16, and a head section 18. The underside of the head section 18 consists of a centrally mounted flexible<br><br>
diaphragm 20 which is surrounded by the attachment plate 28. The diaphragm can flex in and out of the head section 18. The attachment plate of the second embodiment of the device 2 consists of a series of downwardly projecting hooks 28a arranged around the diaphragm 20.<br>
In use, a user attaches a cleaning member 6 to the attachment plate 28 of the handle 4 in the same way as described above in respect of the first embodiment, i.e. by simply touching the underside of the head section 18 and, hence, attachment plate onto a cleaning member 6. The hooks 28a engage with the fibres/voids 38 on the surface of the cleaning member 6 thereby maintaining it in position. As with the first embodiment, there is no need for the user to touch the cleaning member 6 or head section 18 by hand during attachment.<br>
The three sections of the handle 14,16,18 are hollow and filled with air. In addition, the body section 14 of the handle 4 is made of a flexible compressible material, for example, rubber. In order to dislodge the cleaning member 6 from the attachment plate 28, the user simply squeezes the compressible body 14 as illustrated by arrow CC' shown in Figure 4. This results in the air inside the body 14 being forced down through the neck 16 of the device 2 towards the head section 18. The shift in ak pressure within the head section 18 causes the diaphragm 20 to move outwardly in the direction of arrow D shown in Figure 4. The result of this is that the soiled cleaning member 6 is unhooked from the hooks 28a and urged away from the attachment plate 28. As with the first embodiment, the cleaning member 6 can be directed into the toilet or a refuse bin (not shown). In addition, there is no need for the user to handle the soiled cleaning member 6 once it has been used.<br>
Referring to Figure 5 and 6, there is shown a third embodiment of the cleaning device 2. The device 2 consists of an elongate inner tube 22 at one end of which there is attached a flexible end 22a. The attachment plate 28 is formed around the end of the flexible end 22a and consists of a number of attachment hooks 28a. The device 2 further consists of an outer tube 24, which is slideable around the outside of the inner tube 22. The inner and<br><br>
outer tubes 22, 24 are approximately the same length. A stopper 26 is provided at the end of the inner tube 22 distal from the attachment plate 28. The stopper 26 is connected via an internal screw thread (not shown) to the attachment plate 28 and is provided as a means to remotely detach the attachment plate 28 from the end of the flexible end 22a.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, a cleaning member 6 can be attached very simply onto the end of the attachment plate 28 on the end of the inner tube 22 by movement of the outer tube 24 back so that the attachment plate 28 on the end of the inner tube 22 is exposed. The attachment plate 28 is then brought into contact with the cleaning member 6. The hooks 28a engage with the fibres/voids 38 in the cleaning member 6 resulting in attachment thereof. The end 22a is flexible which allows a user to manipulate the end 22a and hence, cleaning member 6 into awkward regions of a toilet.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, a user can simply eject the cleaning member 6 from the end of the inner tube 22 by sliding the outer tube 24 in a direction towards the attachment plate 28 as illustrated by arrow CE'. The result is that outer tube 24 is urged against the top of the cleaning member- 6 which is then forced away from the tubes 22,24 in a direction of arrow 'F' as shown in figure 6. Hence, as with the other two embodiments shown in Figures 1-4, the cleaning member 6 may very simply be attached to the attachment plate 28 of the device, and ejected therefrom after use without any need for the user to touch the cleaning member 6 either before or after use. This embodiment of the device 2 also has a resilient spring (not shown) which pulls the outer tube 24 back over the inner tube 22 so that the device is always ready for use by a user.<br>
The hooks 28a on the attachment plate 28 effectively hook underneath the fibres/voids 38 of the cleaning member 6 such that the cleaning member 6 is maintained in position "when used to clean the toilet. Constant pressure is normally applied to the handle 4, and hence, the cleaning member 6, during the cleaning operation. After use, each of the three ejection mechanisms ensure that there is no need for the user to ever touch the soiled cleaning member 6.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 7, there are shown enlarged views of various embodiments of the attachment plate 28. The attachment plate 28 can form either a continuous cleaning surface as shown in Figure 7d, or include various shaped holes 30.<br>
In Figure 8, there are shown various embodiments of the cleaning member 6. In each embodiment, the cleaning member 6 consists of a fibrous network of woven or non-woven material, or foam or the like. The cleaning member 6 can be manufactured out of a material which is sufficiently tough to allow it to be used to clean a toilet or other surface. Normally, it is preferred that the material is biodegradable and non-hazardous so that it can be flushed down the toilet following use. The cleaning member 6 is normally rectangular in shape and relatively planar such that it can be manoeuvred into small areas not otherwise reachable by more three-dimensional cleaning members 6. The cleaning member 6 may be made entirely of a network of fibres 38, or alternatively, a fibrous layer having voids to which the hooks 28a of the attachment plate 28 may engage.<br>
The cleaning member 6 can have a series of slots 32 which extend there across. The slots 32 are provided to facilitate the disposal of the cleaning member 6 by flushing down the toilet. The design of the cleaning member 6 is such that it has sufficient strength to endure substantial pressure during the cleaning process, but also can break up and disperse as it is flushed. The position and length of the slots 32 are such that the attachment plate 28 keeps the cleaning member 6 together as one piece while it is used for cleaning. However, following use, the cleaning member 6 is ejected from the attachment plate 6 so that the slots 32 are not held together any longer. This facilitates the breaking up of the cleaning member 6. It is envisaged that the cleaning member 6 could consist of more than 1 cleaning member, for example, four smaller cleaning members. In this case, the attachment plate 28 keeps the four smaller cleaning members together in position as a single cleaning member 6. Following use, the four smaller cleaning members disperse as they are flushed down the toilet.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 9, there is shown the action of engagement of the hooks 28a of the attachment plate 28 with a cleaning member 6. The handle 8 shown in Figure 9 is that of the first embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 2. In addition, the cleaning member 6 shown in Figure 9 is just one of the many possible embodiments of cleaning member 6. However, it should be appreciated that mechanism of attachment is essentially the same for all of the three embodiments of handle 4 and cleaning member 6.<br>
Referring to Figure 10, there is shown a storage -unit 34 in which a number of cleaning members 6 and the handle 4 can be stored when not in use. The unit holds a number of unused cleaning members 6.<br>
Referring to Figures 11-13 &amp; 16, there is shown a fourth embodiment of a cleaning device 2 and corresponding second embodiment of a storage unit 34. The device 2 consists of an elongate tube 40 which substantially encloses an elongate member 42. Elongate tube 40 comprises two halves 40a, 40b which are snap-fitted, screwed, glued, or otherwise held together. Elongate tube 40 includes ribs 58 to aid guidance into storage unit 34. Elongate member 42 has a projection 44 which projects through an opening 46 in the elongate tube 40 and which can be actuated to move the elongate member 42 along the elongate tube 40, and biasing means to bias the elongate member 42 in a particular direction.   An attachment member 56 including substantially parallel connected plates 28, 48 is pivotally mounted on the end of elongate tube 40. Elongate member 42 is connected to ejection means 52 via an opening in plate 48. Ejection means 52 includes an elongate member 54 and an ejection plate 50 which is adapted to slide over plates 28 but not plates 48. Attachment plates 28 include hooks  for engagement with a cleaning member 6 as heretobefore described. In use, a cleaning member 6 is attached to the attachment plates 28 for cleaning, the pivotally mounted member 56 assisting this function, and when finished the user ejects the cleaning member 6 by sliding button 44 forward, in the opposite direction to which it is biased by a spring basing means, which in turn slides ejection plate 50 over attachment plates 28, from a position where it is proximal to plate 48 and flush or less than flush to attachment plates 28 to a position<br><br>
where it is more than flush to attachment plates 28, thereby forcing the cleaning member 6 off attachment plates 28.<br>
The storage unit 34 may hold a number of unused cleaning members 6 at an angle to the base e.g. 30 degrees, and parallel to the attachment plate 28 when the same is placed in the storage unit 34. This allows the cleaning member 6 to engage the attachment plate 28 on contact without further action by the user. The storage unit 34 includes a door 60 to allow refilling of cleaning members 6. The door can be attached in a number of standard ways, such as snap-fit, slideable mounting, hinges, etc. Openings 62 in the door or other parts of the storage unit 34 allow the user to see how many cleaning members 6 are contained in the storage unit 34. The storage unit includes a rim 64 to prevent cleaning members 6 from falling out accidentally if for example the storage unit 34 was inverted, and slots 66 to guide the ribs 58 of the cleaning device 2 into the storage unit 34.<br>
Referring to Figures 14-15 &amp; 17-19, there is shown a fourth embodiment of a cleaning device 2 and corresponding alternative third embodiment of a storage unit 34. Storage unit is comprised of two sections 34a, 34b which are held together by snap-fit, clips, and/or hinges and the opening of which facilitating the replacement of a cartridge 68 of cleaning members 6 held therein.<br>
When the cleaning device 2 is placed in the storage unit 34, the attachment plates 28 of the cleaning device 2 are aligned with the cleaning member 6 by the ribs 58 in the slots 66, the same also securing the cleaning device 2 in an upright position.<br>
As the cleaning device 2 is removed from the storage unit 34, the ribs 58 disengage from the slots 66 allowing the cleaning device to move towards the user. If the user pulls the cleaning device 2 too far up the storage unit 34, the attachment member 56 contacts deflection ribs 70, so as to guide the end of the cleaning device 2 with the attachment member 56 out of the opening of the storage unit 34 without fouling and/or disengaging the cleaning member 6.<br><br>
The storage unit 34 includes two or more interference ribs 72 in contact with the outer surface of the cartridge 68 of cleaning members 6, deforming the cartridge wall such that the cleaning members are gripped slightly by the inner surface of the cartridge 68. The cartridge 68 is sufficiently flexible to allow such deformation, being manufactured from card, film and/or the like, and creating the effect that the cartridge is 'nipped' in. the middle. As the cleaning members 6 have a natural tendency to stick together, the interference ribs 72 allow the cleaning members 6 to be removed one at a time in use. A further embodiment includes a cartridge 68 provided with interference ribs to achieve a similar result to that hereinbefore described.<br>
Referring to Figures 20-22, there is shown a further embodiment of the cleaning end of the cleaning device 2. In this case the device handle comprises two halves 40a, 40b, substantially enclosing an elongate member 42 which passes downward to the attachment means 56. The attachment means 56 is also shown which includes attachment plates 28. The elongate member 42, at the lower end, adjacent the attachment means, is configured so as to have a central section 54 which has a supporting rib 55, and two arms 57, 59 to either side of the central section. The free range of pivotal movement of the attachment means 56 when used for cleaning and/or the attachment of a cleaning member thereto is defined by the ability of the arms 57,59 to pivot with the barrel 61. The central section 54 is separate form the arms by the slots 63 and is housed in the chamber 41 formed by first half 40a of the handle and the extended wall of the second half 40b of the handle.<br>
If desired, biasing means may also be included to bias the resilient elongate member 42 in a particular direction.<br>
To eject a cleaning member, the elongate member 42 is actuated to move downwardly with respect to the handle and attachment means and as it does so the member 42 moves as a unit in that the arms 57, 59 and central section 54 all move in the same direction and plane through the barrel 61 which acts to bring the same together. The provision of the strengthening rib 55 acts to<br><br>
further strengthen member 42 when used for ejection as illustrated in Figure 22. The downward movement passes through the attachment means 56 and causes the ejection means to provide an ejection force to remove the cleaning member from the attachment means 56. This causes the ejection of the cleaning member from the attachment means 56 as hereinbefore described.<br>
Figures 20 and 21 show the configurations of the cleaning device 2 in use for cleaning in cross section. In this arrangement the resilient member 42 have the arms 57, 59 locating with the attachment means 56 and allow pivotal movement of the same while the central section 54 does not exert a restraining force on the attachment means and lies in the chamber 41 defined by the parts 40a and 40b in the chamber. Figure 20 shows the attachment means in a position for use to clean and Figure 21 shows the configuration of the cleaning device 2 in position for the device to be placed into a complementary storage unit (not shown) to allow the attachment of a cleaning member in the storage unit onto the attachment means and the lifting of the cleaning member from the storage unit for use.<br>
1. While in cleaning use the attachment means is pivotally moveable with respect to the resilient member 42 about the arms 57,59 and when in die ejection mode, when it is important that an increased degree of rigidity is provided. This is achieved by the combination of the downward force applied as described and die barrel 61 such that the member 42 as it moves through the pivot location comprises the arms 57,59 and central section 54 restricted to move as a unitary member and in only one, downward direction and therefore apply a single unitary force. This provides the required strength and rigidity to allow the ejection means to operate efficiently and with sufficient strength to cause the ejection of the cleaning member from the attachment means to be achieved. Thus, in applying the ejection force to the cleaning member to remove the same from the attachment means the arms act in conjunction with the further portion of the resilient member 42 to apply the ejection force in a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane in which the attachment means lie and the attachment means lies substantially parallel with the cleaning<br><br>
member so as to allow the ejection force to be applied uniformly across the cleaning pad to allow ejection and hence removal of the cleaning member to be achieved.<br>
One of the key features of this invention is to provide an attachment mechanism between the reusable handle 4 and disposable cleaning member 6 that is easy to engage with only the use of the user's hand in the intended position on the handle. Therefore the device 2 consists of the attachment means 28, located at the far end of the reusable handle 4 which features a series of protruding hooks 28a. These low profile hooks 28a engage with the fibres/continuous filaments 38 featured on the upper surface layer of the cleaning member 6. Whilst it is intended that the user positions, and presses the attachment plate 28 onto the centre of the cleaning member 6, it is not critical exactly where contact is made, thereby requiting only a minimum level of dexterity.<br>
The option exists for the attachment pkte 28 to be replaceable from the end of the handle 4, should it become soiled or damaged. The attachment plate 28 can consist of either (i) a supporting plate (not shown) onto which a cut section of hook tape from a suitable existing Hook and Loop fastening system is mounted, or (ii) a single injection moulded component as shown in the Figures. The option of a bespoke moulded hook 28/ fibre 38 system would enable the following improvements to be engineered:-<br>
1) The hook 28a profile geometry and spacing may be engineered to provide only a minimum degree of adhesion, i.e. sufficient to safely engage the cleaning member 6 and lift it from within water in the toilet in a fully saturated state. This could be achieved by reducing the degree of engagement of each hook 28a and fibre 38, and by the reduction in surface density of hooks 28a and fibres 38. This may reduce the risk of any shed fibres 38 or cleaning member residue remaining within the hooks 28a when the cleaning member 6 is disengaged, and potentially prolong the useful life of the hooks 28a. Additionally, disengagement of the cleaning member 6 will be easier, affording flexibility in the design of the ejector mechanism. Even with<br><br>
a considerably reduced degree of engagement, the fastening system will deliver more than adequate sheer strength, whilst cleaning. 2) The attachment plate 28 can be vented with a series of apertures 30 (see Figures 7a &amp; 7e) to allow water flow to help removal of any residual fibres 38 which may be trapped within the hooks 28a.<br>
Another key aspect of this invention has been the development of a disposable cleaning member 6 which is not only easy to mount onto the handle 4, i.e. by simply touching the top surface of the cleaning member 6 with the handle's attachment plate 28, but is very simple and economic to produce. Alternative designs, particularly those involving a 3D shaped head engaged by a friction fit, involve a single or multi-stage moulding/fabrication process. A moulding or fabrication process will almost certainly result in significant greater costs in both, unit and investment capital terms. In contrast, a flat, single layer, roll of cleaning material can be very simply converted into the small cleaning members 6 of the preferred dimensions.<br>
A key feature of this invention is to utilise a material construction that will deal effectively with most toilet cleaning tasks combined with the preferred geometry. The desired characteristics can be summarised as follows:-<br>
1) Absorbency — for wiping action to remove loose soil from surface<br>
with minimum smearing; '   2) Abrasion — to help remove hardened stains and lime-scale build-up;<br>
3)	Instant conformability — to easily conform under pressure to the<br>
contour of the surface being cleaned. This is possible when the<br>
cleaning member 6 is dry, i.e. water is not required;<br>
4)	Rigidity — sufficiently rigid to be self-supporting when saturated, and<br>
transfer   applied   pressure   through   the    cleaning   member   to<br>
unsupported areas;<br>
5)	Strength - to endure most demanding tasks for a relatively prolonged<br>
period, for example, 2 minutes.<br><br>
6) A dehydrated chemical cleaning formula can be incorporated in the cleaning member 6 to replace and/or supplement the use of separate cleaning chemicals.<br>
Many previously submitted designs appear to provide adequate levels of absorbency. However, the levels of abrasion, strength (for the maximum life in use) and balance of conformability/rigidity have until now been inadequate to match or even improve upon the cleaning efficacy of a bristle-based toilet brush.<br>
As water solubility and degradation has been considered unreliable to provide instant flushability after use, the cleaning member 6 must remain whole and intact for at least the maximum demand likely to be requited of the cleaning member 6. This has been loosely defined as 2 minutes under constant agitation, under 500 grams plus of constant firm pressure whilst saturated in tepid water against the porcelain bowl surface. The scope of this invention allows the use of two material breakdown specifications, i.e. (i) the disposable cleaning member 6 does not measurably breakdown whilst within the sewage disposal system; or (ii) the cleaning member 6 is designed to commence breakdown a short time after the equivalent maximum demand is placed upon it.<br>
The second option is the preferred material specification as it provides an added degree of safety against any potential blockage within the sewage system. Whilst the configuration of geometry and cleaning member mass should ensure the complete cleaning member 6 will always flush without causing obstruction there is the possible risk in areas of low volume water flow that cleaning members 6 could settle and build up within the sewer over time. It is therefore preferable that the material begins to degrade as soon after flushing as possible.<br>
In addition to the material construction options identified above, the rate of breakdown can be accelerated to varying degrees by the inclusion of the slots or cut lines 32 during production. It is important these cut lines 32 are<br><br>
configured in patterns that work with the chosen hook 28a layout of the attachment plate 28 or fastener plate, to ensure the cleaning member 6 does not breakdown during use, or when disengaged.<br>
The disposable cleaning member 6 can be made from biodegradable materials although this is not essential. In addition, the cleaning member 6 is made from a non-woven substrate. However, it is possible that an alternative substrate could be used such as foam or a woven fabric. If required the material provides an open structure of randomly arranged cross members which allow the hooks 28a to attach or engage. This can be fibrous or foam.<br>
The material used for the cleaning member 6 depends on the chosen breakdown characteristics required.<br>
For example, the disposable cleaning member 6 is based on a single layer construction of non-woven material. Biodegradable fibres 38 are formed into a "high-loft" web, for example, carded and lightly needle punch bonded. Tliis web may be composed of a cellulose fibre e.g. Viscose Rayon, or a Viscose/poly lactic acid fibre blend. The high loft web is then spray bonded and heat cured to create a strong matrix of resin bonded fibres 38. The resin is a partially hydrolysed PVOH which is applied in solution. A natural mineral, or biodegradable grit, for example, chalk/ground nut shell may be added to the spray solution for added abrasion.<br>
The result of such a process is that the high loft web structure enables the engagement of the hooks 28a, by virtue of the relatively wide, deep spacing between fibres 38, throughout the thickness of the cleaning member 6. The resin binder ensures a strong bond during cleaning, and minimizes fibre entrapment in the hooks 28a after disengagement. The resin binder and the inclusion of soft grit particles provide the desired level of abrasion to lift stubborn stains, but not scratch the porcelain surface. The resin binder blend delivers a retarded level of solubility which is engineered to commence breakdown only after flushing. As there is only a low level of mechanical bond, the material structure will breakdown into small particles,<br><br>
and eventually individual fibres after the binder has dissolved. The fabric structure and density delivers an optimal mass for flushing.<br>
An alternative method of delivering each of the attributes above is to use an insoluble binder, and use partially hydrolysed PVOH fibre blended with Viscose / PLA. This would enable partial breakdown of the cleaning member 6 in the sewer as part of the fibre structure degrades/dissolves at time of ejection or in the liquid after ejection from the attachment means.<br>
The material can also include a two-layer construction in which a top layer utilises a woven loop scrim made from continuous yarn. This has the benefit of being least likely to shed after disengagement from the fastening hooks 28a, as it is not constructed from individual, relatively short fibres 38. The second layer could be manufactured utilising a similar process described above, but using an insoluble binder. This would deliver the required abrasion, handle and feel characteristics. Alternatively, the second layer could be produced using other non-woven methods, with abrasion provided by means of a finishing process.<br>
The hook 28 and fibre 38 fastening method enables a number of ejection mechanisms to be considered as illustrated in Figures 1 to 6. It is most important that the ejector mechanism cleanly removes the complete soiled cleaning member 6 after use. The arrangement of the interface between the attachment plate 28 and cleaning member 6 is important to ensure the minimum amount of residual fibres 38 are held within the hooks 28a. In the event that residual fibres 38 build up within the proximity of the hooks 28a of the attachment plate 28, or if the plate 28 becomes either damaged or soiled, an alternative design is to provide a mechanism by which the plate 28 or plate can be remotely dismounted without the need for the user to grip the plate directly.<br>
In addition to the optional ejector mechanisms shown in the Figures, there are two other handle 4 design considerations that have a significant relevance to cleaning performance of the device 2. For example, a cleaning preparation dispensing arrangement (not shown) within the handle, either (i)<br><br>
in the form of a detachable container (disposable or refillable), or (ii) a cavity within the handle 4 that can be filled as required by the user or a disposable handle filled with liquid, gel or mousse. This mechanism can dispense the preparation either through the disposable cleaning member 6, or directly onto the toilet bowl surface. As a further option the cleaning members cane be impregnated or coated with a cleaning material which may be susceptible to environment conditions and in which case the cleaning members can be sealed in packaging from environmental conditions prior to use.<br>
