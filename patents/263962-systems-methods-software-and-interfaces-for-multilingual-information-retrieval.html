Systems, Methods, Software, and Interfaces for<br>
Multilingual Information Retrieval<br>
Related Application<br>
The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application<br>
60/641,669 which was filed on January 4, 2005, and which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference <br>
Technical Field<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention concern information<br>
retrieval, particularly multi-lingual or cross-lingual information retrieval<br>
systems, methods, and software.<br>
Background<br>
The importance of search engine technology has grown significantly in<br>
the last decade or so, mirroring the expansion and usage of the Internet. When a<br>
user clicks a search button, a search engine hunts through tens of millions of<br>
terms to find terms and corresponding documents that satisfy the query. But,<br>
this superficial simplicity obscures the complexity of the underlying search<br>
technology, because good search engines do not generally stop with a simple<br>
matching of query terms.<br>
To appreciate the complexity, consider that search engines fall generally<br>
into one of two categories: monolingual or multilingual. Monolingual search<br>
engines receive queries or search requests in one language, and retrieve<br>
documents in the same language. For example, Spanish language queries yield<br>
Spanish language documents. Monolingual search engines typically process a<br>
query by breaking, or parsing, it into individual terms, and then reducing or<br>
"stemming" each individual term to its root or base form.   The stemmed terms,<br>
sometimes in combination with equivalent terms, are then used to find relevant<br>
documents. Thus, for example, a search for documents containing the word 'cat'<br>
also retrieves documents that include the term cats, cat's, cats', or even feline.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/074324	PCT/US2006/000394<br>
Multilingual searches engines, on the other hand, receive search requests<br>
in one language, such as German, and retrieve relevant information in another<br>
language, such as French or English. In such cases, the challenge of effective<br>
searching is more complex, because in non-English languages, nouns can be<br>
masculine, feminine, or neutral; verbs change form to show number (singularity<br>
or plurality), to show tense (present, past, future and so forth), and to show<br>
person- first ("I"), second ("you"), and third ("he/she/it."); adjectives change<br>
form based on the nouns they modify; and character-punctuationrsuch-as accent<br>
or other diacritical marks, significantly affect meaning. While stemming resolves<br>
these complexities in a monolingual search, stemming alone cannot address the<br>
added complexities of linguistic conflicts across languages, and in some cases,<br>
may even interfere. For example, gender in most languages can be normalized<br>
to a single stem without loss of significant meaning; however, there are some<br>
languages, such as Portuguese, that require gender to be retained in order to<br>
maintain meaning. As a result, multilingual search engines typically rely on<br>
some method of translating queries and possibly documents into a common<br>
language.<br>
Although there is continuing research in this area, the present inventors<br>
have recognized a need for alternative methods, systems, and interfaces for<br>
facilitating multi-lingual searches.<br>
Summary<br>
To address this and/or other needs, the present inventors have a devised<br>
one or more novel methods, systems, and interfaces for facilitating multi-lingual<br>
searches. For example, one exemplary method entails creating multiple<br>
language-specific indices for a collection of documents, with each index<br>
including stemmed and non-stemmed versions of terms from the documents.<br>
Each term in the index is associated with a document identifier, a position<br>
indicator, and a language indicator. The exemplary method further entails<br>
receiving a query and a set of one or more target languages from a user. The<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/074324	PCT/US2006/000394<br>
query is parsed into one or more terms or phrases, with each term or phrase<br>
associated with a specific language.<br>
The original and stemmed versions of each term or phrase are then<br>
translated into the target languages, using one or more techniques that each<br>
separately yields a set of one or more potentially equivalent query terms.<br>
Exemplary techniques include using a database of pre-translated documents, an<br>
electronic language dictionary, an automated translator, and pivot language.<br>
Each set of potentially equivalent query terms is then taken as a separate query<br>
and processed against the corresponding language-specific index, using a<br>
conventional monolingual search technique, such as a Boolean or natural<br>
language query, to identify documents from the collection. The resultant<br>
documents are presented to the user in language groupings or by computed<br>
relevance.<br>

Exemplary Multilingual Information-Retrieval System<br>
Figure 1 shows an exemplary online multilingual information-retrieval<br>
system 100, which incorporates teachings of the present invention. System 100<br>
includes one or more databases 110, one or more servers 120, and one or more<br>
access devices 130.<br>
Databases 110 include a set of multilingual documents 112 and<br>
corresponding set of monolingual indices 114.<br>
Documents 112, in the exemplary embodiment, include English, French,<br>
German, and Japanese documents. (Other embodiments may include other<br>
languages, and in some embodiments, some of the documents are multilingual,<br>
meaning that one or more portions, such as a paragraph, are written in a different<br>
language than other portions of the documents.) Each of the documents, of<br>
which document 1121 is representative, is associated with a unique document<br>
identifier, such as Dl, and includes a number of terms, such as terms tl, 12, t3,<br>
..., tn, with each term having a corresponding position within the document,<br>
such as pi, p2, p3,..., pn.  Multilingual documents 112 are associated logically<br>
with monolingual indices 114.<br>
Monolingual indices 114 include an English index 1141, a French index<br>
1142, a German index 1143, and a Japanese index 1144, each of which has a<br>
similar structure. Representative of the other indices, French index 1142<br>
includes a number of data structures, such as representative data structure<br>
1142A. Data structure 1142A includes a term 1142B in its original form from at<br>
least one of documents 112, a normalized or stemmed version of the term<br>
1142C, positional data 1142D, language identifier 1142E, and document<br>
identifier 1142F. Assigning document terms to these language-specific indexes<br>
not only enables the system to discern the language type of each document term,<br>
both in its original form and its stemmed form, but also enables the system to<br>
find each term in a document, with all the searching options available in<br>
conventional monolingual searches. In some embodiments, the indices are<br>
logical portions of a single index, whereas in other embodiments, each index is<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/074324	PCT/US2006/000394<br>
logically independent of the others and may reside in separate storage locations<br>
or devices.<br>
Databases 110, which take the exemplary form of one or more electronic,<br>
magnetic, or optical data-storage devices, include or are otherwise associated<br>
with respective indices (not shown). Each of the indices includes terms and<br>
phrases in association with corresponding document addresses, identifiers, and<br>
other conventional information. Databases 110 are coupled or couplable via a<br>
wireless or wireline  communications network,such as-alocal-, wide-, private<br>
or virtual-private network, to server 120<br>
Server 120, which is generally representative of one or more servers for<br>
serving data in the form of webpages or other markup language forms with<br>
associated applets, ActiveX controls, remote-invocation objects, or other related<br>
software and data structures to service clients of various "thicknesses." More<br>
particularly, server 120 includes a processor module 121, a memory module 122,<br>
a subscriber database 123, a search module 124, and a multilingual module (or<br>
software) 125,<br>
Processor module 121 includes one or more local or distributed<br>
processors, controllers, or virtual machines. In the exemplary embodiment,<br>
processor module 121 assumes any convenient or desirable form.<br>
Memory module 122, which takes the exemplary form of one or more<br>
electronic, magnetic, or optical data-storage devices, stores subscriber database<br>
123, search engines 124, and multilingual module 125.<br>
Subscriber database 123 includes subscriber-related data for controlling,<br>
administering, and managing pay-as-you-go or subscription-based access of<br>
databases 110. In the exemplary embodiment, subscriber database 123 includes<br>
one or more preference data structures, of which data structure 1231 is<br>
representative. Data structure 1231 includes a customer or user identifier portion<br>
1231 A, which is logically associated with one or more search preferences, such<br>
as preferences 1231B, 1231C, and 1231D. Preference 1231B and 1231C include<br>
respective default value governing whether search results include documents<br>
from first and second languages, such as German and Japanese. Preference<br>
123 ID includes a default value governing whether search results are presented<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/074324	PCT/US2006/000394<br>
based strictly on relevance, or whether they are grouped via language. (In the<br>
absence of a temporary user override, for example, an override during a<br>
particular query or session, the default value for the search preferences governs.)<br>
Search module 124 includes one or more search engines and related user-<br>
interface components, for receiving and processing queries against one or more<br>
of databases 110, with use of indices 114. In the exemplary embodiment, one or<br>
more search engines associated with search module 124 provide Boolean, tf-idf<br>
(term frequency-inverse document frequency), and/or-natural-language search —<br>
capabilities.<br>
Multilingual module 125 includes an indexer module 1251, a translator<br>
module 1252, and an interface module 1253. Indexer module 1251 comprises<br>
machine readable and/or executable instructions for processing documents 112<br>
and defining or updating indices 114. Translator module 1252 comprises<br>
machine-readable and/or executable instructions for translating and/or extending<br>
query terms (or concepts) submitted in a user query to multiple sets of<br>
equivalent query terms in one or more corresponding target languages. Interface<br>
module 1253 comprises machine readable and/or executable instructions for<br>
wholly or partly defining web-based user interfaces (such as a user interface<br>
138) over a wireless or wireline communications network on one or more<br>
accesses devices, such as access device 130.<br>
Access device 130 is generally representative of one or more access<br>
devices. In the exemplary embodiment, access device 130 takes the form of a<br>
personal computer, workstation, personal digital assistant, mobile telephone, or<br>
any other device capable of providing an effective user interface with a server or<br>
database. Specifically, access device 130 includes a processor module 131, a<br>
memory 132, a display 133, a keyboard 134, and a graphical pointer or selector<br>
135 (also known as a mouse).<br>
Processor module 131 includes one or more processors, processing<br>
circuits, or controllers. In the exemplary embodiment, processor module 131<br>
takes any convenient or desirable form. Coupled to processor module 131 is<br>
memory 132.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/074324	PCT/US2006/000394<br>
Memory 132 stores code (machine-readable or executable instructions)<br>
for an operating system 136, a browser 137, and a graphical user interface<br>
(GUI)138. In the exemplary embodiment, operating system 136 takes the form<br>
of a version of the Microsoft Windows operating system, and browser 137 takes<br>
the form of a version of Microsoft Internet Explorer. Operating system 136 and<br>
browser 137 not only receive inputs from keyboard 134 and selector 135, but<br>
also support rendering of GUI 138 on display 133. Upon rendering, GUI 138<br>
presents data in association with one or more interactive-control-features (or—<br>
user-interface elements). (The exemplary embodiment defines one or more<br>
portions of interface 138 using applets or other programmatic objects or<br>
structures from server 120.)<br>
More specifically, graphical user interface 138 defines or provides one or<br>
more display regions, such as a query or search region 1381 and a search-results<br>
region 1382. Query region 1381 is defined in memory and upon rendering<br>
includes one or more interactive control features (elements or widgets), such as a<br>
query input region 1381 A, a query submission button 1381B, and a language<br>
selection region 1381C. Query input region 1381A also allows a user to<br>
designate or identify the language of one or more of the terms input in the query<br>
region. Language-selection region 1381C allows a user to select, using check<br>
boxes, radio buttons, or pull-down menus, one or more languages in which to<br>
search.<br>
Search-results region 1382 is also defined in memory and upon rendering<br>
includes one or more interactive control features 1382A-1382D. Control<br>
features 1382A-1382C correspond to one or more monolingual document lists<br>
and enable a user to selectively access or retrieve one or more corresponding<br>
documents relevant to the governing query from databases 110 via server 120.<br>
Each of control features 1382A-1382C includes a respective document identifier<br>
or label, such as LX DOCS, LY DOCS, and LZ DOCS, identifying respective<br>
languages and/or the number of corresponding documents. In some<br>
embodiments, the control feature is incorporated with a folder icon or associated<br>
with a particular language tab.   Control feature 1382D enables a user to<br>
selectively change the contents of results region 1382 to a relevance mode,<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/074324	PCT/US2006/000394<br>
where the documents found to be relevant to the governing query are listed in<br>
rank order of relevance.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, each of these control features of interface<br>
138 takes the form of a hyperlink or other browser-compatible command input.<br>
Although Figure 1 shows query region 1381 and results region 1382 as being<br>
simultaneously displayed, some embodiments present them at separate times.<br>
Exemplary Methods of Operating a Multilingual Information-Retrieval System<br>
Figure 2 shows a flow chart 200 of an exemplary method of operating a<br>
multilingual information retrieval system, such as system 100 in Figure 1.<br>
Flow chart 200 includes blocks 210- 270, which are arranged and described<br>
serially. However, other embodiments execute two or more blocks in parallel<br>
using multiple processors or processor-like devices or a single processor<br>
organized as two or more virtual machines or sub processors. Other<br>
embodiments also alter the process sequence or provide different functional<br>
partitions or blocks to achieve analogous results. Moreover, still other<br>
embodiments implement the blocks as two or more interconnected hardware<br>
modules with related control and data signals communicated between and<br>
through the modules. Thus, the exemplary process flow applies to software,<br>
hardware, and firmware implementations.<br>
At block 210, the exemplary method begins with provision of a<br>
multilingual document collection—that is a collection comprising two or more<br>
documents written in two or more languages. In the exemplary embodiment, the<br>
document collection takes the form of one or more databases, such as database<br>
110 in Figure 1, which includes English, French, German, and Japanese<br>
documents. In the exemplary embodiment, each document is treated as a single<br>
unit with a single identifier no matter how many languages it contains, and each<br>
term in the document, regardless of its language, is associated with that single<br>
document. The assignment of consecutive word positions across language<br>
boundaries within the same document provides full text searching across<br>
language types.   The process of tokenizing a document, that is, finding the<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/074324	PCT/US2006/000394<br>
words in the document, is language specific, meaning that each document (or<br>
document portion) is tokenized with a tokenizer consistent with its language.<br>
The exemplary method continues at block 220.<br>
Block 220 entails defining a set of one or more language-specific indices<br>
for the document collection, using for example indexer 1251 in Figure 1. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment, this entails tokenizing each of the documents in the<br>
collection,eliminating stop words, and then stemming the remaining terms.<br>
Stemmed and non-stemmed versions of the remaining terms are then stored in<br>
association with one "or more document identifiers for uniquely identifying the<br>
corresponding collection document that contain the terms, and with one or more<br>
positional indicators for indicating positions of the terms in the documents.<br>
Additionally, a language indicator or identifier is stored in association with the<br>
terms to facilitate language-specific searching and to effectively define logical<br>
language-specific indices including a number of data structures, such as data<br>
structure 1142A in Figure 1. Some embodiments may simply store terms in<br>
language-specific locations or files. After the one or more indices are defined,<br>
processing continues at block 230.<br>
Block 230 entails receiving a query from a user. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment, this entails a user directing a browser in a client access device,<br>
such as device 130 in Figure 1, to an internet-protocol (IP) address for an online<br>
information-retrieval system, such as system 100, and then logging onto the<br>
system using appropriate credentials. Successful login results in a web-based<br>
search interface, such as interface 138 in Figure 1 (or one or more portions<br>
thereof) being output from server 120, stored in memory 132, and displayed by<br>
client access device 130.<br>
The user then defines the query by interacting with the interface,<br>
specifically entering terms of the query into a query input region and selecting<br>
one or more of the listed target languages for use in directing the query to<br>
appropriate databases or portions thereof; and finally actuating a query<br>
submission feature to transmit the query to a server, such as server 120 for<br>
processing. In some embodiments, the user also identifies the language of the<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/074324	PCT/US2006/000394<br>
query, or the language of one or more portions, such as words or phrases, in the<br>
query. The identification of language may be done automatically and/or with<br>
user assistance, such as confirmation of automatically generated and presented<br>
language identifiers.   The exemplary embodiment supports the following use<br>
     cases:<br><br>
Execution then advances to block 240 (as shown in Figure 2.)<br>
Block 240 parses the query into one or more query terms, with, each<br>
query term associated with a corresponding language identifier, ha the<br>
exemplary embodiment, this entails parsing the query using conventional<br>
language-specific parsing techniques and eliminating language-specific stop<br>
words. The exemplary embodiment also entails stemming the words using<br>
language-specific stemmers to define stemmed versions of the query terms.<br>
Execution of the exemplary method continues at block 250.<br>
Block 250 translates the original and stemmed versions of each query<br>
term into each of the target languages to define respective sets of one or more<br>
equivalent query terms; In the exemplary embodiment, translating the original<br>
and stemmed versions of each term includes identifying equivalent query terms<br>
using each of the following: a lexicon built from a database of pre-translated<br>
documents (that is, a parallel corpus), an electronic language dictionary, an<br>
automated translator, and a pivot language.<br>
For lexicons built from parallel corpora, the exemplary embodiment<br>
considers a parallel corpus to be a body of documents where each document is<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/074324	PCT/US2006/000394<br>
represented in at least two languages A and B. Exemplary parallel corpora<br>
include legal documents in the European Union, which are commonly provided<br>
in at least German, French, and English. Patents are also sometimes translated<br>
into multiple languages and can also serve as parallel corpora. The parallel<br>
corpora can be used, in combination with an IBM statistical machine translation<br>
training phase and a similarity thesaurus, to generate a one-way lexicon of terms<br>
where a term has one to many weighted translations. That is each term a -&gt;<br>
(maps or translates to equivalent query terms) b1wb2W, b3W. The-electronit<br>
dictionary provides a one-way lexicon of terms where each term has- one or more<br>
translations: for example, a -&gt; b1, b2. Automatic machine translation is used in<br>
the exemplary embodiment for natural language translation of a phrase or<br>
sentence from language A to B: for example, "a1 a2" -&gt; b1. A pivot language<br>
may be used to create the associations between two languages that have each<br>
established associations to the pivot language. If a term or concept in language A<br>
has an associated term or concept in language B, and if the same term or concept<br>
in language A has its associated term concept in language C, then the concept in<br>
language B has an associated concept in language C. In other words, if<br>
a -&gt; b and a -&gt; c, then b -&gt; c.<br>
Thus, in the exemplary embodiment, each query term (concept or phrase)<br>
is associated with 2X sets of equivalent query terms, with X being the number of<br>
target languages. Moreover, each set of equivalent terms results from as many<br>
as four possible translation or equivalence-determination techniques. Integrating<br>
several translation methodologies or techniques is believed to result in more<br>
accurate and meaningful translations with fewer ambiguities.   Execution<br>
continues at block 260.<br>
Block 260 entails identifying one or more sets of documents from the<br>
document collection for each of the target languages, with each set identified<br>
based on the equivalent query terms for the corresponding target language. In<br>
the exemplary embodiment, this entails use of a Boolean or natural-language<br>
search engine to process each of the sets of equivalent query terms using a<br>
corresponding one of the language specific indices 114.   Each of the equivalent<br>
monolingual queries is resolved by relying on the OR operator to provide hits for<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/074324	PCT7US2006/000394<br>
one or more of the language specific terms in a document. In some<br>
embodiments, other logical operators may be used to combine the various sets of<br>
equivalent monolingual query terms. For natural-language searching,<br>
identifying each set of documents includes determining a relevance score for<br>
documents based on the equivalent query terms, and then identifying documents<br>
having a relevance score exceeding a predetermined threshold.<br>
Block 270 entails presenting a graphical user interface listing the<br>
identified set of documents in groups based on corresponding language~and/or in<br>
rank order of relevance. In the exemplary embodiment, this enfailsdisplaying a.<br>
listing of the identified set of documents on interface 138, specifically search-<br>
results region 1382. Whether the set is displayed in language groupings or in<br>
rank order of relevance (or other criteria such as date) is governed by user<br>
preference stored in subscriber database 123. Some embodiments include a<br>
command feature on the interface, enabling a user to selectively alter the display<br>
mode from the language-grouping mode to the relevance mode and vice versa. In<br>
some embodiments, the relevance mode results in normalization of the scores<br>
between documents of different language types, In addition, search concepts are<br>
weighted by language type.<br>
Conclusion<br>
In furtherance of the art, the present inventors have presented various<br>
embodiments of multilingual information-retrieval systems, methods, software,<br>
and interfaces. One exemplary system enables a user to submit a single<br>
monolingual or multilingual query and search one or more collections of<br>
monolingual or multilingual documents. Components of the system include<br>
multiple monolingual indices, a mechanism for translating a query into multiple<br>
sets of equivalent monolingual query terms, and a mechanism for effectively<br>
routing the respective sets of monolingual query terms to the appropriate<br>
monolingual indices for identification of relevant documents. Ultimately, the<br>
exemplary embodiment allows any combination of collections and languages to<br>
be searched with a single query and a single search platform.<br>

SLWK4962.035WO1	19	Thomson Global Resources<br><br>
The present inventors have a<br>
devised one or more novel methods, systems, and<br>
interfaces for facilitating multi-lingual searches.<br>
One exemplary method entails creating multiple<br>
language-specific indices for a collection of<br>
documents, with each index including stemmed<br>
and non-stemmed versions of terms from the<br>
documents. Users   submit   queries   that   are<br>
associated  with  a  set  of one  or  more  target languages. Query processing entails translating<br>
original and stemmed versions of each term in a<br>
query into each of the target languages, using one or<br>
more techniques that each yield a set of potentially<br>
equivalent query terms. Each set of potentially<br>
equivalent query terms is then processed against<br>
the corresponding language-specific index, using<br>
a conventional monolingual search technique, such<br>
as a Boolean or natural language query, to identify<br>
documents from the collection. The resultant<br>
documents are presented to the user in language<br>
groupings or by computed relevance.</td>
