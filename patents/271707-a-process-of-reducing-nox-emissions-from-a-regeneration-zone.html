				<td>METHOD FOR CONTROLLING NOX EMISSIONS IN THE FCCU<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]       The present invention reiates to NOX reduction compositions and the method<br>
of use thereof to reduce NOX emissions in refinery processes, and specifically in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes. In particular, the present invention reiates to NOX reduction compositions and processes for reducing NOX emissions released from a FCC unit (FCCU) regeneratioh zone operating under a heterogeneous combustion mode during a FCC process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] An increased concern about air pollution from industrial emissions of noxious oxides of nitrogen, sulfur and carbon have led governmental authorities to place limits on allowable emissions of one or more of such pollutants. Clearly, the trend is in the direction of increasingly stringent restrictions.<br>
[0003] NOX, or oxides of nitrogen, in flue gas streams exiting from FCC regenerators is a pervasive problem. FCCUs process hydrocarbon feeds containing nitrogen compounds, a portion of which is contained in the coke on the catalyst as it enters the regenerator. Some of this coke nitrogen is eventually converted into NOX emissions, either in the FCC regenerator or in a downstream CO boiler, Thus all FCCUs processing nitrogen-containing feeds can have a NOX emissions problem due to catalyst regeneration.<br>
[0004] In a FCC process, catalyst partides or inventory are repeatedly circulated between a catalytic cracking zone and a catalyst regeneration zone. During regeneration, coke from the cracking reaction deposits on the catalyst partides and is removed at elevated temperatures by oxidation with oxygen containing gases such as air. The removal of coke deposits restores the activity of the catalyst partides to the point where they can be reused in the cracking reaction. The coke removal step is performed over a wide range of oxygen conditions. At the minimum, there is typically at least enough oxygen to convert essentially all of the coke made to CO and FIzO. At the maximum, theamount of oxygen available is equal to or greater than the amount necessary to oxidize essentiaüy all of the coke to COa and H2O.<br>
[0005] In a FCCU operating with sufficient air to convert essentially all of the coke on the catalyst to COi and HaO, the gas effluent exiting the regenerator will contain "excess oxygen" (typically 0.5 to 4% of total off gas). This combustion mode of operation is usually called "complete burn" or "full burn". When the FCCU regenerator is operating in full burn mode, the conditions in the regenerator are for the most part oxidizing. That is, there is at least enough oxygen to convert (burn) all reduced gas phase species (e.g., CO, ammonia, HCN) regardless of whether this actually happens during the residence time of these species in the regenerator. Under these conditions, essentially all of the nitrogen deposited with coke on the catalyst during the cracking process in the FCCU riser is eventually converted to molecular nitrogen or NOX and exits the regenerator as such with the off gas. The amount of coke nitrogen converted to NO* as opposed to molecular nitrogen depends on the design, conditions and operation of the FCCU, and especially of the regenerator, but typically the majority of coke nitrogen exits the regenerator as molecular nitrogen.<br>
[0006] On the other händ, when the amount of air added to the FCCU regenerator is insufficient to fully oxidize the coke on the cracking catalyst to CO2 and H2O, some of the coke remains on the catalyst, while a significant portion of the coke carbon burned is oxidized only to CO. In FCCUs operating in this fashion, oxygen may or may not be present in the regenerator off gas. However, should any oxygen be present in the regenerator off gas, it is typically not enough to convert all of the CO in the gas stream to COa according to the chemical stoichiometry of<br>
(Formula Removed)This mode of operation is usually called "partial burn." When a FCCU regenerator is operating in partial burn mode, the CO produced, a known pollutant, cannot be discharged untreated to the atmosphere. To remove the CO from the regenerator off gasand realize the benefits of recovering the heat associated with burning it, refmers typically burn the CO in the regenerator off gas with the assistance of added fuel and air in a burner usually referred to as "the CO boiler". The heat recovered by burning the CO is used to generate steam.<br>
[0007] When the regenerator is operating in partial burn, the conditions in the regenerator, where the oxygen added with air has been depleted and CO concentration has built up, are reducing. That is, there is not enough oxygen to convert/burn all reduced species regardless if some oxygen is actually stiil present. Under these conditions some of the nitrogen in the coke is converted to so called "reduced nitrogen species", examples of which are ammonia and HCN. Small amounts of NOX may also be present in the partial burn regenerator off gas. When these reduced nitrogen species are burnt in the CO boiler with the rest of the regenerator off gas, they can be oxidized to NOX, which is then emitted to the atmosphere. This NOX along with any "thermal" NOX formed in the CO boiler burner by oxidizing atmospheric N2 constitute the total NOX emissions of the FCCU operating in a partial or incomplete combustion mode. [0008] FCCU regenerators may also be designed and operated in an "incomplete burn" mode intermediate between full burn and partial burn modes. An example of such an intermediate regime occurs when enough CO is generated in the FCCU regenerator to require the use of a CO boiler, but because the amounts of air added are large enough to bring the unit close to full bum operation mode, significant amounts of oxygen can be found in the off gas and large sections of the regenerator are actually operating under oxidizing conditions. In such case, while gas phase reduced nitrogen species can stiil be found in the off gas, significant amounts of NOX may also be present. In most cases a majority of this NOX is not converted in the CO boiler and ends up being emitted to the atmosphere.<br>
[0009] Yet another combustion mode of operating a FCCU is nominally in full burn with relatively low amounts of excess oxygen and/or inefficient mixing of air with coked catalyst. In this case, large sections of the regenerator may be under reducing conditions even if the regenerator is nominally oxidizing. Under these conditions, reduced nitrogen species may be found in the regenerator off gas along with NOX.<br>
[0010] Where both oxidizing and reducing regions exist simultaneously within the FCCU regeneration zone, heterogeneous modes of combustion may develop. For example, as the operation conditions within a FCCU regenerator approaches the transition point between full and partial burn (or incomplete burn) combustion modes, oxidizing and reducing regions may exist in the regenerator. Heterogeneous combustion modes may also exist in a FCCU regenerator where the coke content of the catalyst partides is not uniform across the radial or axial dimension of the regenerator, or where oxygen, CO, CC-2, NOX, SOX and gas phase reduced nitrogen and sulfur species formed during regeneration are not uniformly distributed across the radial or axial dimension of the regenerator. Due to poor mixing, the pollutants formed in each area (e.g., CO, SOX, reduced nitrogen and sulfur species in the reducing areas, and SOX and N0.x in the oxidizing areas) may not have sufficient time to react with gases from other areas and produce a f!ue gas häving the expected composition for the nominal mode of operation of the regenerator. As a result, the fiue gas will contain both oxidized and reduced species. [0011] Some regenerators are mainly a large vessel containing the fluidized catalyst being regenerated, while others employ advanced designs to improve catalyst regeneration and the mixing efficiency of coked catalyst and air, or to allow the burning of more coke without overheating the regenerator. Additional complexity is introduced by the different air grid designs employed for air distribution, and the various catalyst/flue gas separation system designs used. The design of the regenerator, the mode of operation, the wear and tear of the equipment during operation, the type and location of the air distribution device (air ring), the fluidized catalyst bed (dense phase bed level), and other factors result in commercial regenerators which often have heterogeneous modes of combustion. The heterogeneity may be in the mixing of coked catalyst coming from the stripper and its distribution throughout the vessel, especially in the angular dimension. Alternatively, the heterogeneity may be in the mixing of air with the catalyst. The result can be a heterogeneous coke distribution on the cracking catalyst inventorybeing regenerated and/or a heterogeneous composition of the gas phase throughout the regenerator. All these heterogeneities may occur simultaneously. In this respect the depth of the catalyst dense phase bed (dimension L) versus the diameter of the regenerator (dimension D) is important in facilitating the evolution of heterogeneities in the FCCU regenerator. For example, a low L/D value can be conducive to creating both oked catalyst and air maldistribution. In extreme cases, when L/D is too low for the air superficial velocity employed, channeling of gases through the bed may occur. Thus, the condition exists vvhere air moves through the catalyst bed as a continuous stream, forming few or no bubbles, and allowing little or no contact with the surrounding catalyst and gases. A large L/D value can also result in increased catalyst traffic through the cyclones, increase back pressure and impact the distribution of both spent catalyst and air throughout the regenerator vessel.<br>
[0012] Further, heterogeneous combustion modes may also exist in a FCCU regeneration zone comprised of multistage or multiple regeneration vessels. In this case, the catalyst regeneration zone consists of two or more regenerator vessels, each one optionally operating in a different combustion mode or, alternatively each regenerator vessel may have catalyst and/or gas maldistribution and independently operate in a heterogeneous mode of combustion. Typically, in these types of regeneration zones, the cracking catalyst inventory is circulated from one vessel to the other and then on to the riser and stripper. The flue gas from the first stage may be fed into a second stage, or alternatively, sent downstream.<br>
[0013] Afterburn is a clear evidence of a regeneration zone suffering from combustion heterogeneities. FCCU operators typically attempt to minimize afterburn with the addition of CO combustion promoters to the unit to facilitate the oxidation of CO in the dense bed. The CO combustion promoter compositions are typically added to the FCCU unit either as a separate partide additive or as an integral component of the cracking catalyst. Thus, use of a CO combustion promoter to control afterburn is another evidence of a regeneration zone suffering from combustion heterogeneities.<br><br>
[0014] Combustion heterogeneities caused by catalyst or gas maldistribution may also be evident when both 02 and CO are detected in the regenerator effluent. For units nominally in full burn excess 02 in the flue gas of equal or greater than 0.1%, preferably equal or greater than 0.3%, most preferred equal or greater than 0.5%, and CO of at least 100 ppm, preferably at least 50 ppm, and most preferred at least 25 ppm respectively indicate that the regenerator is suffering from maldistribution. For units operating in partial burn or incomplete combustion mode häving at least 0.1% CO in the flue gas preferably at least 0.5%, most preferred at least 1%, any amount of excess 02 in the flue gas, preferably, more than 0.05%, most preferred more than 0.1%, is evidence of maldistribution.<br>
[0015] Temperatee gradients throughout the regenerator vessel or vessels both in the radial and axial dimensions may also be symptoms of heterogeneities caused by catalyst or gas maldistribution. FCCU operators typically measure temperatures in the regenerator at various points in the dense bed, the dilute phase, the cyclones, the plenum (if present) and overhead, and the flue -gas pipe. A temperature difference between any temperature measurement point above the dense bed and the average dense bed temperature of 10 °F, preferably 20 °F, most preferred 30 °F is evidence of maldistribution or heterogeneity existing in the regenerator. In the alternative, a temperature gradient across the axial dimension at any point above the air grid of 10 °F, preferably 20 °F, most preferably 30 °F is evidence of maldistribution or heterogeneity in the regenerator. <br>
[0016] Attempts to control NOX released from a regeneration zone häving heterogeneous combustion modes have included adjusting operation conditions of the FCCU during a FCC process, For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,268,089 and 5,382,352 disclose reducing NOX emissions by operating close to the point of transition between full and partial burn mode (i.e., incomplete combustion mode, or full burn with low excess 02). It is believed that this mode of operation allows NOX formed in oxidizing sections of the regenerator, and reduced nitrogen species, e.g. NH3, formed in reducing sections of the regenerator to react with each other effectively reducing NOX emissions. However,even in this mode of operation, NOX emissions persist and any reduced nitrogen species left is converted to NOX in a downstream CO boiler and is emitted as NOX along with any unreacted NOX escaping the regenerator.<br>
[0017] Several additive compositions have been proposed for reducing NOX emissions from a FCCU regenerator during a FCC process wherein the regenerator is operating in a specified mode of combustion, For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,129,834; 6,143,167; 6,280,607; 6,379,536; 6,165,933 and 6,358,881 discloses additive compositions which are useful for controlling NOX emissions from a FCCU regenerator operating in a full burn combustion mode. On the other händ, U.S. Patent No. 6,660,683 discloses additive compositions which are useful for the control of NOX emissions from a FCCU regenerator operating in a partial or incomplete combustion mode. The additive compositions accomplish NOX reduction by converting reduced nitrogen species to molecular nitrogen before they exit the partial or incomplete combustion mode regenerator and are converted to NOX in a downstream CO boiler. <br>
[0018] Additive compositions have not been reported for use to control NOX emissions released from a FCCU regeneration zone operating under heterogeneous combustion modes. Clearly, the use of additives under such conditions presents a particularly difficult challenge to the FCCU operator for several reasons. First, since additive compositions are typically circulated throughout the entire FCCU, the additives will be subjected to various combustion conditions. Secondly, each combustion mode requires a different chemistry to reduce NOX emissions released from a FCCU regeneration zone operating under heterogeneous combustion conditions during a FCC process. Thirdly, an additive suited for reducing emissions under one combustion regime may be ineffective under another combustion regime and may even promote an increase of NOX emissions under the other combustion regime.<br>
[0019] Consequently, there exists a need in the refming industry for improved processes for reducing NOX emissions released from a FCCU regeneration zone operating under heterogeneous combustion modes during a FCC process, which processes are simple and effective.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020] The essence of the present invention resides in the discovery of particulate compositions which are capable of being circulated throughout a fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) along with the cracking catalyst inventory to simultaneously minimize the content of reduced nitrogen species, e.g. NHs and HCN, and NOX present in the off gas of the FCCU regeneration zone when the regenerator is operated in a heterogeneous mode of combustion. Advantageously, processes of the invention exhibit high efficiencies for the oxidation of reduced nitrogen species present in the regions of the regenerator operating under reducing conditions while simultaneously converting NOX to NT in regions of the regenerator operating under oxidizing conditions. <br>
[0021] In accordance with the process of the invention, NOX reduction compositions, vvhich comprise (a) at least one component häving the ability to convert NOxto molecular nitrogen under oxidizing conditions and (b) at least one component häving the ability to convert gas phase reduced nitrogen species under reducing conditions, are circulated along with the FCC cracking catalyst inventory during a FCC process. The NOX reduction compositions may be used either as an integral part of the FCC catalyst partides or as separate partide additives. In one embodiment of the invention, the NOX reduction compositions are used as separate particulate additives and are circulated along vvith the circulating FCC catalyst inventory. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, components of the NOX reduction compositions are added to the circulating catalyst inventory independently as separate partides.<br>
[0022] Accordingly, it is an advantage of this invention to provide FCC processes for the reduction of the content of NOX in the off gas released from a FCCU regeneration zone operating in a heterogeneous combustion mode during a FCC process. <br>
[0023] It is also an advantage of this invention to provide FCC processes for the reduction of NOX emissions from a FCCU regeneration zone operating in heterogeneous modes of combustion by simultaneously minimizing the amount of reduced nitrogen species and NOX emitted from the regeneration zone during a FCC process.<br>
[0024]      Another advantage of the invention is to provide FCC processes which are<br>
effective to oxidize reduced nitrogen species and to reduce NO* present in a FCCU<br>
regeneration zone operating in a heterogeneous mode of combustion without increasing<br>
the production of either NOX or reduced nitrogen species under any combustion mode in<br>
the FCCU regenerator.<br>
[0025]       It is also an advantage of the present invention to provide FCC processes for<br>
the reduction of NOX emissions from a FCCU regeneration zone operating in a<br>
heterogeneous combustion mode due to multistage or multiple regeneration vessels in the<br>
regeneration zone.<br>
[0026]        Yet another advantage of this invention is to provide  improved  FCC<br>
processes for the reduction of "NO* emitted in the off gas released from a FCCU<br>
regenerator operating under heterogeneous combustion conditions.<br>
[0027]       These and other aspects of the present invention are described in further detail<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0036]       For purposes of this invention, the term "NOX" is used herein to represent<br>
oxides of nitrogen, e.g. nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NOa), the principal<br>
noxious oxides of nitrogen, as well as N204, NaOj and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0037]       The term "reduced nitrogen species" is used herein to indicate any gas phase<br>
species fonned in the regenerator of a FCCU during a FCC process which gas phase<br>
species contain a nitrogen atom häving a nominal charge of less than zero. Examples of<br>
reduced nitrogen species include, but are not limited to, ammonia (NHa), hydrogen<br>
cyanide (HCN), and the like.<br>
[0038]      The term "reduced sulfur species" is used here to indicate any species formed<br>
in the regenerator of a FCCU during a FCC process which species contains a sulfur<br>
häving a nominal charge of less than zero. Examples of gas phase reduced sulfur species<br>
include, but are not limited to, I-fcS, COS, and the like.<br>
[0039]       The term "oxidizing conditions" is  used here to describe the reaction<br>
conditions in an area of a FCCU regenerator where oxygen is present in sufficient<br>
amounts to fully oxidize any reduced species present (e.g., CO, NHa, HCN, H2S, COS,<br>
gas phase hydrocarbons) accordingto the applicable stoichiometric reaction, e.g.,<br>
(Formula Removed)2NH3 + 5/2 02-&gt;2NO + 3H2O 2HCN + 7/202-»2CO3+2NO + H2O H2S + 3/2 02-»SO2 + H20 COS + 3/2 02-+C02 + SO2 Hydrocarbon + O2—»C02 +H20 (stoichiometry is specific to hydrocarbon)<br>
regardless of whether this actually happens during the residence time of these species in the regenerator, While coke on the cracking catalyst is a reductant which can be oxidized by oxygen to CO or C02, it is not available to react directly over the additive composition like gas phase species are able to do. Thus, coke in-of-itself is not directly included in the reductants considered to define oxidizing conditions.<br>
[0040] The term "reducing conditions" is used here to indicate the reaction conditions in an area of a FCCU regenerator where oxygen is not present in sufficient amounts to fully oxidize all reduced species present (e.g., CO, NHs, HCN, H2S, COS, gas phase hydrocarbons) according to the applicable stoichiometric reaction, regardless of whether this actually could happen during the residence time of these species in the regenerator. While coke on the cracking catalyst is a reductant which can be oxidized by oxygen to CO or CO2, it is not available to react directly over the additive composition like gas phase species are able to do. Thus, coke in-of-itself is not directly included in the reductants considered to define reducing conditions.<br>
[0041] The term "heterogeneous combustion mode" is used herein to indicate a condition within a FCCU regeneration zone where non-homogeneous regions of oxidizing or reducing conditions exist in the regeneration zone during a FCC process, Typically, such heterogeneous conditions are caused by catalyst or air/gas maldistribution or heterogeneity within the regeneration zone.<br>
[0042] The term "catalyst maldistribution or heterogeneity" is used herein to indicate a condition in a FCCU regenerator where the coke content of the catalyst partides in the<br>
regenerator, or each regenerator vessel for multi-stage regenerators, is not uniform across the radial or axial dimensions of the regenerator.<br>
[0043] The term "gas maldistribution or heterogeneity" is used here to indicate a condition in a FCCU regenerator where in the gas or air in a FCCU regenerator, or each regenerator vessel for multi-stage regenerators, oxygen, CO, NOX, SOX) and gas phase reduced species are not distributed uniformly across the radial or axial dimensions of the regenerator.<br>
[0044] The term "afterburn" is used herein to indicate the burntng of CO which occurs when CO and OT escaping the dense bed of fluidized cracking catalyst being regenerated react at any point above the dense catalyst bed, including the area immediately above the dense bed (dilute phase), the cyclones where entrained catalyst is separated from the flue gas, the plenum, overhead above the cyclones, or even the flue gas pipe. Afterburn is measured as the difference between any of the temperatures measured after the regenerator dense bed, or the average of all or any group of such temperatures measured (e.g., dilute phase, cyclone, plenum, overhead, or flue gas temperatures and the like) minus any of the dense bed temperatures or the average of all or any group of dense bed temperatures measured.<br>
[0045] For purposes of this invention, the terms "regenerator" and "regeneration zone" are used interchangeably.<br>
[0046] In accordance with the present invention, the content of NOX emitted during a FCC process from a FCCU regeneration zone operating under a heterogeneous mode of combustion is effectively brought to a lower and more acceptable level by simultaneously controlling the amount of reduced nitrogen species and NOX emissions present in the flue gas released from the regeneration zone. This simultaneous control is accomplished by contacting the circulating cracking catalyst inventory during a FCC process with a NOX reduction composition comprising (1) at least one reduced nitrogen species component häving the ability to reduce the content of reduced nitrogen species by converting the reduced nitrogen species to molecular nitrogen under reducing conditions and (2) at least one NOX reduction component häving the ability to reduce the content of NOX emissions<br>
under oxidizing conditions. It is an important feature of this invention that the reduced nitrogen species component and the NOX reduction component of the NOX reduction compositions do not increase the content of reduced nitrogen species or NOX in the FCCU regeneration zone under any mode of combustion during a FCC process. <br>
[0047] For convenience, the present invention will be described with reference to a FCC process although the present cracking process could be used in any conventional cracking process, i.e. thermofor catalytic cracking process, with appropriate adjustments in partide size to süit the requirements of the process. Apart from the addition of the NOX reduction composition of the invention to the catalyst inventory, the manner of operating the process will remain unchanged, Thus, conventional FCC catalysts may be used, for example, zeolite based catalysts with a faujasite cracking component as described in the seminal review by Venuto and Habib, Fluid Catalytic Cracking with Zeolite Catalysts, Marcel Dekker, New York 1979, ISBN 0-8247-6870-1 as vvell as in numerous other sources such as Sadeghbeigi, Fluid Catalytic Cracking Handbook, Gulf Publ. Co. Houston, 1995, ISBN 0-88415-290-1. Typically, the FCC catalysts consists of a binder, usually silica, alumina, or silica-alumina, a Y type acidic zeolite active component, one or more matrix aluminas and/or silica-aluminas, and fillers such as kaolin clay. The Y zeolite may be present in one or more forms and may have been ultra-stabilized and/or treated with stabilizing cations such as any of the rare earths. <br>
[0048] Somewhat briefly, the fluid catalytic cracking process in which a heavy hydrocarbon feedstock will be cracked to lighter products takes place by contact of the feed in a cyclic catalyst recirculation cracking process with a circulating fluidizable catalytic cracking catalyst inventory consisting of partides häving a mean partide size of from about 50 to about 150 µm, preferably about 60 to about 100 µm. The significant steps in the cyclic process are:<br>
(i) the feed is catalytically cracked in a catalytic cracking zone, normally a riser cracking zone, operating at catalytic cracking conditions by contacting feed with a source of hot, regenerated cracking catalyst to<br>
produce an effluent comprising cracked products and spent catalyst<br>
containing coke and strippable hydrocarbons; (ii)      the effluent is discharged and separated, normally in one or more<br>
cyclone, into a vapor phase rich in cracked product and a solids rich<br>
phase comprising the spent catalyst; (iii)     the vapor phase is removed as product and fractionated in the FCC<br>
main column and its associated side columns to form gas and liquid<br>
cracking products including gasoline; (iv)     the spent catalyst is stripped, usually with steam, to remove occluded<br>
hydrocarbons from the catalyst, after which the stripped catalyst is<br>
oxidatively regenerated to produce hot, regenerated catalyst which is<br>
then recycled to the cracking zone for cracking further quantities of<br>
feed.<br>
[0049] Suitable feedstocks include petroleum distillates or residuals of erude oils which, when catalytically cracked, provide either a gasoline or a gas oil product. Synthetic feeds häving boiling points of about 204 °C to about 816 °C, such as oil from coal, tar sands or shale oil, can also be included.<br>
[0050] Cracking conditions empioyed during the conversion of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons to lower molecular weight hydrocarbons include a temperature of 480°C to about 600 °C. A catalyst to hydrocarbon weight ratio of about l to 100, preferably about 3 to 20 is contemplated for hydrocarbon conversion. The average amount of coke deposited on the surface of the catalyst is between 0.5 weight percent and 3.0 weight percent depending on of the quality of the feed, the catalyst used, and the unit design and operation. Rapid disengagement of the hydrocarbons from the catalyst is accomplished in a quick-stripping zone either intrinsic within the reactor or located in an external vessel. This stripping function is performed in the presence of steam or another inert gas at a temperature of about 480 °C to about 600 °C.<br>
[0051] The catalyst regeneration zone of the FCC process indudes a lower dense bed of catalyst häving a temperature of about 600 °C to about 800 °C and a surmounted dilute<br>
phase of catalyst häving a temperature of from 600 °C to about 800 °C. As it is well known in the art, the catalyst regeneration zone may consist of a single or multiple reactor vessels. In order to remove coke from the cataiyst, oxygen is added to the regeneration zone. This is performed by conventional means, such as for example, using a suitable sparging device in the bottom of the regeneration zone or, if desired, additional oxygen is added to other sections of the dense bed or the dilute phase of the regeneration zone.<br>
[0052] Preferably, the regeneration zone consists of at least one regenerator vessel häving catalyst and/or gas maldistribution regardless of the combustion mode of operation. In one embodiment of the invention, the regeneration zone is operated at the transition stage between full and partial burn conditions. It is also within the scope of the present invention, that the regeneration zone consists of more than one regenerator vessels wherein each regenerator vessel is operated in a different mode of combustion, or have catalyst and/or gas maldistribution regardless of the combustion mode of operation. <br>
[0053] In the process of the invention at least two different and distinct catalyst/additive compositions are used in combination to achieve the overall reduction in the content of NOX emissions emitted from FCCUs häving a regeneration zone operating under a heterogeneous combustion mode. At least one of the catalyst/additive compositions must be suitable for reducing NOX emissions under full burn or oxidizing conditions without häving a net result of increasing the formation of reduced nitrogen species under any combustion condition and is hereinafter referred to as the "NOX reduction component". Additionally, at least one of the catalyst/additive compositions must be able to convert reduced nitrogen species to N2 under partial or incomplete burn or reducing conditions without häving a net result of increasing the formation of NO* under any combustion condition and is hereinafter referred to as the "reduced nitrogen species component". It is an important feature of the present invention that the NOX reduction component and the reduced nitrogen species component have different and distinct compositions, e.g., do not have the same compositions.<br>
[0054] NOX reduction compositions useful in the process of the invention comprise any physical mixture or blend of at least one fluidizable NOX reduction component and at least one fluidizable reduced nitrogen species component häving the combined effect to reduce NOX emissions in the flue gas released from a FCCU regeneration zone operating in heterogeneous combustion modes. Typically, the NOX reduction component useful in the present invention will be any particulate catalyst/additive composition which has the functional property of being effective for reducing NOX emissions in a FCC unit operating in full burn combustion mode, or alternatively the functional property of being able to convert NOX to N2 by (a) direct NOX decomposition, (b) reaction of NOX with any reductants present in the regenerator such as CO, NH3, HCN, hydrocarbons, coke, and the like, (c) absorption of NOX in the regenerator and transfer to the riser and stripper for reduction to N2, (d) partlal oxidation of any NOX precursors, such as gas phase reduced nitrogen species, to N2 or (e) any other suitable reaction mechanism, under FCC full burn conditions. In addition, the NOX reduction component must not significantly increase the formation of reduced nitrogen species when used in a FCCU operating under any combustion condition, but in particular, under partlal burn or reducing conditions. That is, when used in a FCCU operating under partlal burn or reducing conditions, the NOX reduction component must not cause an increase in the content of reduced nitrogen species in the FCCU regenerator off gas of more than 10% of the amount of reduced nitrogen species absent the presence of the NOX reduction component,<br>

[0077] Another class of materials useful as the reduced nitrogen species component include NOX removal compositions such as disclosed and described, in PCT International Publication No. WO 2004/033091 and U.S. Patent Application 2004/0072675, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.

[0079] It is within the scope of this invention that the reduced nitrogen species component of the NOX reduction compositions of the invention will comprise at least one reduced nitrogen species component or any combination of reduced nitrogen species components as described hereinabove.<br><br>
[0080] In accordance with the present invention, NOX reduction compositions useful in the invention process may be used as separate particulate additives circulated along with the cracking catalyst inventory, or alternately, incorporated within the cracking catalyst as a component thereof. Where the NOX reduction compositions are used as separate particulate additives, NOX reduction components and reduced nitrogen species components comprising the NOX reduction compositions may be added to the FCC cracking catalyst inventory independently as separate partides, or in the alternative, the components are added to the cracking catalyst invention physically admixed or blended into a single partide additive. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the components of the NOX reduction compositions are added to the circulating cracking catalyst inventory independently as separate partides.<br>
[0081] NOX reduction compositions or the components thereof are generally used in the present invention in the form of partides and will have a partide size sufficient to permit the compositions to be circulated throughout the catalytic cracking unit simultaneously with the cracking catalyst. Typically, the NOX reduction compositions and components thereof will have a mean partide size of greater than 45 µm. Preferably, the mean partide size is from about 50 to 200 µm, most preferably from about 55 to about 150µm, and even more preferred from about 60 to about 120 µm. Partides comprising the invention composition and components thereof generally have a surface area of at least 5 µg, preferabiy at least 10 nr/g, most preferably at least 30 m2/g, and a Davison Attrition Index (DI) of 50 or less, preferably 20 or less, most preferably 15 or less.<br>
[0082] When used as a separate additive, NOX reduction compositions or the components thereof are used in any amount sufficient to reduce the NOX emissions present in the FCCU regenerator relative to the amount of NOX emissions present without the use of the NOX reduction compostions, as measured by conventional gas analysis methodology, including but not limited to, chemiluminescence, UV spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and the like. Typically the amount of theNOx reduction compositions used as separate partide additives is at least 0.01, preferably at least 0.05, most preferably at<br>
least 0.1, wt % of the catalyst inventory. Preferably, theNO* reduction compositions are used in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to about 45 wt %, most preferably from about 0.05 to about 30 wt % and even more preferably from about 0.1 to about 20 wt% of the cracking catalyst inventory.<br>
[0083] When the NOX reduction compositions are incorporated into or onto the cracking catalyst as a separate component of the cracking catalyst, the NOX reduction compositions will typically be used in an amount of at least 0.01, preferably at least 0.05, most preferably at least 0.1, wt % of the cracking catalyst composition. Preferably, the NOX reduction compositions will be used in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to 45 wt %, most preferably from about 0.05 to about 30 wt %, even more preferable from about 0. l to about 20 wt %, of the cracking catalyst composition.<br>
[0084] It is also within the scope of the invention that at least one NOX reduction component or at least one reduced nitrogen species component comprising the NOX reduction compositions of the invention may be incorporated into the cracking catalyst as a component thereof as described hereinabove, while the other component, ie. the NOX reduction component or reduced nitrogen species component, respectively, is used as a separate particulate additive as described hereinabove.<br>
[0085] The relative amount of each of the NO* reduction component and the reduced nitrogen species component to be used in the NOX reduction compositions of the invention will vary and is not restricted to any specific ratio. The amount of each component will depend on such factors as the specific unit regenerator design and operation, the mode of operation, the extent of maldistribution for either the catalyst or the gases, the oxygen levels, the presence of any other additives, and the desired NOX reduction to be achieved. In general, however, the components are used in a ratio of 0.02 to 50, preferabiy 0,1 to 10, most preferably 0.2 to 5.0. Separate partides of the NO* reduction compositions and/or components thereof may be added to the catalyst inventory in any conventional manner, e.g., vvith make-up catalyst to the regenerator or by any conventional method.<br>
[0086] Other catalytically active components may be present in the circulating inventory of catalytic material in addition to the cracking catalyst and the NOX reduction compositions. Examples of such other materials indude the octane enhancing catalysts based on zeolite ZSM-5, CO combustion promoters based on a supported noble metal such as platinum, stack gas desulfurization additives, commonly known as SOX additives, such as DESOX® (magnesium aiuminum spinel), vanadium traps and bottom cracking additives, such as those described in Krishna, Sadeghbeigi, op eit and Scherzer, Octane Enhancing Zeolitic FCC Catalysts, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1990, ISBN 0-8247-8399-9. These other components may be used i n their conventional amounts. <br>
[0087] The effect of the present process is to minimize the overall content of NOX emissions reieased from a FCC process operating in a heterogeneous combustion mode. Very significant reduction in NOX emissions may be achieved using the present process, in some cases up to about 90% relative to the base case using a conventional cracking catalyst, at constant conversion, using the preferred form of the NOX reduction compositions of the invention as described hereinabove. NOX reduction of 10 to 90% is readily achievable with the process according to the invention, as shown by the Examples below. However, as will be understood by the one skilled in the catalyst art, the extent of NOX reduction will depend on such factors as, e.g., the composition and amount of the additive utilized; the design and the manner in which the FCCU is operated, including but not limited to oxygen level and distribution of air in the regenerator, catalyst bed depth in the regenerator, stripper operation and regenerator temperature; the properties of the hydrocarbon feedstock cracked; and the presence of other catalytic additives that may affect the chemistry and operation of the regenerator, Thus, since each FCCU is different in some or all of these respects, the effectiveness of the process of the invention may vary from unit to unit.<br>
[0088] The scope of the invention is not in any way intended to be limited by the examples set forth below. The examples include the preparation of oxidative additives useful in the process of the invention and the evaluation of the invention process to reduce NOX and gas phase reduced nitrogen species in a catalytic cracking environment.<br>

It should be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific details set forth in the examples.<br>

The slurry was milled in a Drais miil to an average partide size of less than 2.5 urn and then spray dried in a Bowen Engineering spray dryer. The spray-dried product was calcined for 1.5 hours at 593 °C.

[0097] A microspheroidai particuläte support material was prepared as follows: A slurry was prepared from an aqueous slurry häving 20% solids of a pepdzable alumina (Versal 700 alumina powder obtained from La Roche Industries Inc., 99% AloO}, 30% moisture). The alumina slurry was prepared using 31.6 Ibs of the alumina. To the alumina slurry 3.87 Ibs of an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (50% NaOH) was added. Then, 10.4 Ibs of cerium carbonate crystals (obtained from Rhone Poulenc, Inc., 96% CeO2, 4% La2O3, 50% moisture) was added to the slurry.

Finally, 3.38 !bs of exchanged süica sol of Nalco 1140 (obtained from Nalco Chemicals Co.) was added to the slurry. The mixture was agitated to assure good mixing and then milled in a stirred media miil to reduce agglomerates to substantially less than 10 microns. The milled slurry was fed to a 10 ft diameter Bowen Engineering spray drier to form microspheres with a diameter of approximately 70 microns. Thereafter, the spray-dried product was calcined at approximately 650°C to remove volatiles and provide a final support.<br>

[0099] The activity of Additive B for reducing NO emissions from the FCCU regenerator was assessed by measuring the activity for catalyzing the reduction of NO by CO in a Regenerator Test Unit (RTU). The RTU is an apparatus specifically designed to simulate the operation of an FCCU regenerator. The RTU is described in detail in G. Yaluris and A. W. Peters "Studying the Chernistry of the FCCU Regenerator Under Realistic Conditions," Designing Transportation Fuels for a Cleaner Environment, J.G. Reynolds and M.R. Khan, eds., p. 151, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999, ISBN: 1-56032-813-4, which description is herein incorporated by reference. After calcination for 2 hours at 593°C, the additive was blended at 0.5% level with a FCC catalyst, OCTACAT®-DCH obtained from Grace Davison, which had been deactivated for 4 hours at 816°C in a fluidized bed reactor with 100% steam. The cracking catalyst alone or the blend was then fed to the RTU reactor operating at 700°C. The gas feed to the reactor was a mixture containing 5000-5500 ppm CO, 500-550 ppm NO, various amounts of oxygen added as 4% Oa/Na, and the balance nitrogen. The total gas feed rate excluding the O2 containing gas feed was 1000-1100 sccm. The amount of oxygen during this experiment was varied so that the conditions in the RTU reactor would simulate reducing and oxidizing areas of an FCCU regenerator. The results are shown in Figure l. The data shows that Additive B is very effective in reducing NO emissions.<br>
