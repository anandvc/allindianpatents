This invention relates to a disposable medical syringe.<br>
Recycling of used disposable syringes has  become a menace particularly in the developing and underdeveloped countries where proper disposal facilities and government control are  inadequate. Miscreants collect used  syringes,  clean them and simply repack JM<br>
them in printed covers which are illegally secured.  Such diseases<br>
spread as hepatitis  B,  AIDS and  other   pyogenic  infections can be 9cfts:S(S <br>
through these recycled   plastic syringes.  As  such any simple means<br>
whereby such recycling can be  prevented has  become an established<br>
topic<br>
l^kkkik  for invention by present day inventors. Even so OCJSMMKKXK<br>
commercially viable solutions have not come forth as evidenced by the lack of such safe syringes in the market. The object of  this invention is to propose a simple syringe which would prevent<br>
recycling if properly used, which is economical and differs only<br>
presterile<br>
slightly from the existing dJcsjists disposable :^mx±MX±tmx  syringes.<br>
Inventors have generally focussed on making some alteration on the syringe after its first use so that the second user would be warned. But this would require government legislation to ensure that all first used syringes are altered in a specific manner. Both the government legislation and its compliance are hard to be achieved. The object of this invention is to propose a simple means whereby the first user of the syringe is compelled (without any law jtuficfflt enforcement)to make visible alteration in the syringe before its first use so that recycling is prevented. It is also<br><br>
another ob;3ect of this invention to provide an economical means for effecting this. The syringe should suffer only minimal altera¬tion so as not to interfere with its routine function. The invention achieves this by providing a seal for the syringe on the same lines as  the existing seal for dry cells*<br>
i^G:Si3witxjsig±9    Accordingly this invention provides a disposable medical syringe comprising an elongated hollow body provided with at its front end an integrally fitted needle or a nozzle for fitting a hypodermic needle, and a plunger dimensioned to work within the said hollow body through the hind end of the latter, as|Jcdk said hollow body and plunger being provided with digital gripping members towards their hind ends, characterised in that the assembled syringe is StK provided with a seal fitted on to and stretching between a front fitted Rszxis cap for the syringe and the said hollow body or plunger or on to the said hollow body and/or ^loragKse the plunger towards the hind end of the syringe so as to restrict the movement xAxtkft of the said front cap or the plunger with respect to the said hollow body.<br>
The plunger of the disposable syringe has sealing means on one end which is slidably inserted into and in sealing relationship with the said hollow body to vary the interior volume of said body. In cases where a hypodermic m needle is provided along with the syringe in the same package, the needle may be fitted on the xafi<br><br>
said nozzle and a cap provided on the said needle^  the seal stretch¬ing  between the said needle cap and the said  hollow body or  plunger of the syringe.  The attachment of the seal to the said hollow body or  plunger  is usually made at  or near the said digital gripping<br>
members as this is the  part which readily  lends itself for attach-<br>
seal ments. The IS^gE is usually integral with or  provided with means<br>
for nondetachable fitting HMfaaxik on to the said  front cap and the said digital KX gripping member (s)  so that the seal has to be ksxJajcaksRtx    broken before  using the syringe.  The seal usually has a  band  or cord  shaped  body.   In cases where the seal is attach¬ed solely to the hollow body of the syringe,  the seal attached to the said hollow body is dimensioned  to enclose the hind  end  of the said  fitted  plunger nclii within the seal.  A ring shaped  front end of the seal is  usually used for  fitting on to the  base of a needle cap.   In some embodiments the  band  or cord  shaped  seal is integral at one of its xm ends with the said  plunger  or hollow body, nondetachable fitting being  provided towards the other  end. The usual means of KcraiKtatitkla nondetachable fitting comprises a resilient  bulbous or ring shaped tip for the seal dimensioned to be introduced  into and  to resist separation from a corresponding hole or  bulbous tip on the syringe  body.  The seal may be broken with a suitable tool.   But it  is ideal if the seal can be  broken with the operator's fingers.  So as to achieve this means are provided for  breaking the seal easily solely with the operator's fingers.  This usually comprises a tag and narrow portions on the body of the seal near the said tag.  The seal holding on to the syringe after  breaking the  seal is  a nuisance.  So means are<br><br>
provided for detaching the seal from the syringe after breaking the seal« The syringe and seal are made of a synthetic material such as plastic and provided in a presterile package.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings^ wherein: Fig,i: is the sectional elevation of UXQCSBH  one embodiment of the<br>
xsis±  syringe with the seal according to the invention; the<br>
seal being shown in side view; Kigx2 Fig.iA: is the end on view of the hollow body of the syringe<br>

according to JdaKxixxwddcoxKi Fig.4 viewed from the back; Fig.5: is the sectional elevation of another embodiment of a syringe<br>
with the seal according to the invention; Fig.5A: is the end on view of the hollow body of the syringe accord¬ing to i^kSLxkxxsxkisx  Fig.5 viewed from the back; Fig.6: is the plan view of a syringe fitted with another embodi¬ment of the seal according to the invention; Fig.6A: is the end on view of the hollow body of the syringe shown in Fig.6 viewed from the back^ the seal being shown in sectional view; Fig.7: is the plan view of another syringe with needle and needle cap fitted with a seal according to the invention.<br>
As aknra shown in the figures the syringe according to the<br>
invention comprises an elongated hollow body B provided with at<br>
its front end an integrally fitted hypodermic needle with an<br>
optional cap E or a nozzle for fitting a hypodermic needle 0,<br>
and a plunger P dimensioned to work within the said hollow body,<br>
gripping<br>
said hollow body and  plunger  being  provided with digital gipidtHg members G and H towards their hind  ends.  The assembled  syringe is provided with a seal L stretching between a front fitted cap C or  E for the syringe and the said digital gripping M«»faKKxXX<br>
members G or H - Figs.5 to 7.   Alternatively the seal L is fitted<br>
gripping towards the hind end of the syringe on to the digital stkftuk^&amp;x<br>
member G aaadk^^OKxHKxSltg      and/or H - Figs.1  to 5A.  The seal in<br><br>
most of the embodiments shown has a bulbous tip D and tag A and is provided with the narrow portions N near the tag.<br>
In the sectional elevations shown the syringe is shown in sectional view and the seal L in side view. In Figs. lA,iB,2A,3A, 4A,5A, and 6A, the body of the seal is athisKn: shown in sectional view remaining within holes on the digital gripping member. The plan view of the seal for the syringes shown in Figs. 2 and 5 has a shape similar to the one shown in Fig.lC, The end on view of the plunger (viewed from the back) shown in Fig.4 has a shape similar to the end on view of the hollow body shown in Fig,4A. The plunger P of the syringe has a resilient plunger tip member R at one end, a stem and the digital gripping awtaia: member H at the other end.<br>
The seal according to Fig,l is made of a resilient plastic. The bulbous tip D of the seal is introduced through jc holes on the digital gripping members H and G. The bulbous tip portion of the seal has a narrow tip and a wider base and is resilient and is dimensioned to resist separation when once introduced through the hole on G. The plunger P cannot be removed from the hollow body B of the syringe when the seal is in its place. Xgh When the tag A is twisted with the i fingers, the body of the seal remaining tightly within holes in the gripping members would resist rotation and the seal would break at the narrow portion N. The seal can now be K easily removed from the syringe by pulling on the bulbous tip D. The syringe is now ready for use. One possible defect of<br><br>
the  seal according to Fig.1 is that the  persons recycling the syringe<br>
may themselves refit another  seal which they have manufactured  on<br>
the old syringe and then market the  product.  This  possibility is<br>
overcome in the syringes according to kkfi: Figs.2,3 and 4 where the<br>
integral seal has £crt(^»c«^ attachments on to the  plunger P and/or on to the<br>
hollow  body B.   By tearing at the narrow portions shown the seal<br>
part can be detached  from the syringe so as to result  in an ordinary<br>
syringe.<br>
In t;he syringe according to ^*ig.5, the seal has attachments only to the gripping mm  member G of the ksiiaca hollow body B of the syringe. The resilient seal is broken by twisting the tag A with the iJcsigSLk  fingers and the seal removed from the syringe* The resulting syringe differs from existing syringes only in having two holes on the gripping member G. In the syringe according to Figs.6 and 7 the seal L has a iainat band or cord shaped body attach* ed integrally to the ixsackxH front cap C (Fig.6) or through a ring shaped front end I dimensioned to be fitted over the base of the needle cap E (Fig.7). This seal has a resilient bulbous tip D towards its hind end, the flattened tag A and the narrow portions N,N between the tag and the body of the seal. In Fig^gA the body of the seal is shown in sectional view remaining within a corresp¬onding hole on the digital g±9.  gi^ipping member G, The resilient ka bulbous tip portion sttaOL  of the seal has a narrow tip and a wider base and is dimensioned to resist separation when once introduced through the hole on G. The front cap C or E cannot be removed without breaking the seal. When the tag A is twisted with the fingers the seal would break at the two narrow portions N and *^»<br><br>
 he bulbous tip D ack in the seal for the syringes shown in Figs.1 to 3 and 5 to 7 may be of the button type as shown in Fig,4.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
