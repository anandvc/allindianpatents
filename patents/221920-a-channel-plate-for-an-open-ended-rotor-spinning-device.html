PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
A Channel plate for an open-end rotor spinning device<br>
The invention relates to a channel plate for an open-end rotor spinning device according to<br>
the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Open-end rotor spinning devices with a rotor housing which is open at the front and is<br>
closed during the spinning operation by a so-called channel plate are prior art and described<br>
in detail in numerous patent applications. In this context channel plates, which are<br>
integrated directly into a pivotally mounted cover element of the open-end rotor spinning<br>
device and also channel plates which can be screwed into the cover element are known.<br>
Furthermore channel plates are known which have a central bearing receiver in which a<br>
channel plate adapter can be fixed so as to be easily replaceable.<br>
Modern open-end spinning devices for example, have a fibre channel plate integrated into the cover element which closes the rotor housing which can be subjected to a vacuum with a lip seal during the spinning process. A draw-in cylinder and an opening cylinder for the fibre band are also mounted in the cover element, which covers the entire front side of the open-end rotor spinning device.<br>
A channel plate of this type with a replaceable channel plate adapter is described in relative detail for example, in DE 197 29192 Al.<br>
The channel plate adapter consists substantially of an insertion body the contact face of which is matched precisely to the shape and size of the central bearing receiver in the fibre channel plate and of a channel plate projection which projects into the spinning rotor when the spinning device is closed. A fixing attachment with a central hole, in which a thread draw-off tube is positioned is arranged on the back on the insertion body. A channel plate adapter of this type can be fixed in a defined manner in the bearing receiver of the fibre channel plate via the fixing attachment and a corresponding locking element for example a rod spring as well as a centring pin. The central hole in the insertion body of the channel plate adapter also penetrates the channel plate projection on the end face of which a thread draw-off nozzle is fixed, which catches in the central hole of the channel plate adapter. The channel plate projection, on its outer surface also has the outlet opening of a fibre guide channel, which continuously connects the fibre band opening mechanism arranged in the cover element pneumatically to the spinning rotor.<br>
2<br><br>
Channel plate adapters of this type are preferably matched to a specific rotor shape and/or rotor size, so a precise fibre band feed and an optimum thread draw-off can be ensured in all production conditions. This means that in a batch change, which also causes a spinning rotor change, the channel plate adapter is generally also replaced.<br>
The above-described channel plate adapters have been used in practice for a long time and have proved themselves outstandingly in practically all fibre materials and virtually all yarn thicknesses.<br>
It has also been shown that during the spinning of yarns made of polyester or of yarns, the material of which has a relatively high polyester content some curtailments have had to be made with regard to the rotor speed of the open-end spinning device as otherwise there is the risk of melting points. This means that with the known channel plates or the known channel plate adapters rotor speeds of over 100,000 rotations per minute can scarcely be produced without risk in the case of yarns with a relatively high polyester content.<br>
The invention is based on the object of modifying the channel plates or channel plate adapters which are known and proven per se such that an increase in the rotor speeds and therefore also an increase in the production output of open-end rotor spinning devices is possible in particular when spinning yarns with a relatively high polyester content without the risk of the fibres being thermally damaged thereby.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a channel plate which has the features described in claim 1.<br>
An advantageous embodiment of a channel plate of this type is described in the sub-claim.<br>
The arrangement of the outlet opening of the fibre guide channel at most half in a cylindrical region of the outer surface of the channel plate projection has the advantage that owing to a modification of this type of the channel plate projection in particular owing to the reduction in the spacing of the wall region adjacent to the end face of the channel plate projection of the outlet opening of the fibre guide channel from the longitudinal centre axis of the channel plate the opening angle between the fibre slide face of the spinning rotor and the front region of the outer surface of the channel plate projection is increased. An increase of this<br>
3<br><br>
type of the opening angle influences both the air throughput through the fibre guide channel and also the feeding of the fibres delivered via the fibre guide channel onto the fibre slide face of the spinning rotor, in a positive manner. In other words owing to the configuration according to the invention, the thermal load of the open-end spinning device is reduced to a non-critical measure, even for polyester yarns, and an improved orientation of the air flow transporting the individual fibres is also achieved. The acute-angled impinging of the fibres on the slide face of the spinning rotor leads overall to a gentler feeding of the fibres.<br>
Furthermore, the wall region of the outlet opening located furthest away from the end face of the channel plate projection has a significantly larger spacing from the longitudinal centre axis of the channel plate. By keeping the channel plate contour in the region behind the outlet opening of the fibre guide channel, the air flow via the fibre guide channel is simultaneously effectively prevented from being able to flow off past the front edge of the spinning rotor immediately and it is thereby prevented that the fibres fed pneumatically are fed onto the fibre slide face of the spinning rotor. Because of the improvement in the flow course of the fibre transporting air flow, with channel plates modified according to the invention, the speed of the spinning rotor and therefore the thread draw-off speed can be significantly increased even in the case of yarns made of polyester or polyester mixes, without thermal damage occurring on the fibres. The configuration according to the invention also exhibits significant advantages in the spinning of cotton yarns. In the case of cotton yarns, both the yarn strength and the spinning stability are increased, for example, during the spinning process. In other words, the number of thread breaks occurring during this spinning process drops up to 30% when using the channel plate according to the invention.<br>
As described in claim 2, it is provided in a preferred embodiment that the channel plate is in two parts. In other words, the channel plate has a central bearing receiver, in which a channel plate adapter can be fixed so as to be replaceable. The channel plate adapter, in this case, consists of an insertion body, which is matched with respect to shape and size to the bearing receiver of the channel plate, as well as a channel plate projection, which is configured as already described above. The above-described improvements to the flow conditions are also produced when using a channel plate adapter of this type, with corresponding modification of the channel plate projection. In other words, corresponding attempts have shown that the highest thread draw-off speeds can be produced with high<br>
4<br><br>
yarn quality with channel plate adapters which have the modification according to the invention.<br>
The advantages of the invention are brought to bear, in particular, in the case of relatively small spinning rotors. In other words the invention has proven especially advantageous when the diameter of the rotor groove arranged in the rotor cup of the spinning rotor is below 30 mm.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail hereinafter with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view of an open-end spinning device with a channel plate arranged in a cover element in which a channel plate adapter is arranged so as to be replaceable in a central bearing receiver.<br>
Fig. 2 is a lateral view to an enlarged scale of a channel plate with a channel plate projection which has been modified according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 3 is a lateral view to an enlarged scale of a channel plate, in which a channel plate adapter is arranged so as to be replaceable in a central bearing receiver and has a channel plate projection which has been modified according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 4 is a lateral view of a channel plate adapter according to the prior art, the outlet opening of a fibre guide channel being shown in plan view,<br>
Fig. 5 is a lateral view of a channel plate adapter which has been modified according to the invention, with the outlet opening of a fibre guide channel in plan view,<br>
Fig. 6 is a front view of a channel plate adapter according to the prior art,<br>
Fig. 7 is a front view of a channel plate adapter according to the present invention.<br>
The open-end spinning device shown in Fig. 1 bears the reference numeral 1 overall. Spinning devices 1 of this type have, as known, a rotor housing 2 in which the spinning cup<br>
5<br><br>
26 of a spinning rotor 3 circulates at a high speed. According to the present embodiment the spinning rotor 3 is supported by its rotor shaft 4 in the bearing interstice of a preferably axially thrust-free support disc bearing arrangement 5. The spinning rotor 3 is driven in this case by a tangential belt 6 extending along the machine, which belt is placed by a pressure roller 7 on the rotor shaft 4. The rotor shaft 4 is axially positioned in the bearing interstice of the support disc bearing arrangement 5 preferably via a permanent magnet thrust bearing 18.<br>
As conventional, the rotor housing 2, which is per se open at the front, is closed during the spinning operation by a pivotably mounted cover element 8. For this purpose the cover element 8 has a channel plate 27 with a seal 9.<br>
The rotor housing 2 is also connected via a suction line 10 to a vacuum source 11, which generates the necessary spinning vacuum in the rotor housing 2.<br>
Furthermore, a channel plate adapter 12 is arranged so as to be replaceable in a central bearing receiver 34 of the channel plate 27 and, as shown, for example in Fig. 3 to an enlarged scale, substantially consists of an insertion body 28 with a contact face 37 and a channel plate projection 30. The outlet opening 31 of a fibre guide channel 14 is arranged in the outer surface of the channel plate projection 30, which has a cylindrical region 50 and a concavely curved region 60. Reference is expressly made here to the fact that the cross-sectional face of the cylindrical region does not have to be circular. A cylindrical region is taken to mean according to the mathematical definition, an outer surface section which has parallel outer surface lines.<br>
The channel plate projection 30 also has a central through-hole 38, in which a thread draw-off nozzle 13 is fixed on the input side and a thread draw-off tube 15 is fixed on the output side.<br>
As also shown in Fig. 1, an opening cylinder housing 17 is fixed to the cover element 8, which is rotatably mounted to a limited degree about a pivot pin 16, or is integrated into the cover element. The cover element 8 also has rear bearing brackets 19, 20 for mounting an opening cylinder 21 or a fibre band drawn-in roller 22.<br>
6<br><br>
The opening cylinder 21 is driven in this case in the region of its wharve 23 by a circulating tangential belt 24 extending along the machine, while the drive (not shown) of the fibre band feed roller 22 preferably takes place via a worm gear arrangement, which is connected onto a drive shaft 25 extending along the machine.<br>
Fig. 2 shows, to an enlarged scale, a channel plate 27 for closing the rotor housing 2 of an open-end spinning device 1. The channel plate 27 has a channel plate projection 30 which has been modified according to the invention, which is positioned inside the rotor cup 26 of a spinning rotor 3 when the rotor housing 2 is closed. The channel plate projection 30 at the end face, in a through-hole 38, has a thread draw-off nozzle 13, which can be non-positively locked via permanent magnet pins 39. A thread draw-off tube 15 is fixed on the output side in the through-hole 38. As can be seen, an outlet opening 31 of a fibre guide channel 14, which pneumatically connects the fibre band opening mechanism to the rotor housing, is arranged in the region of the outer surface of the channel plate projection 30. The outlet opening 31 of the fibre guide channel 14 lies in the spinning position, in other words opposing a fibre slide face 40 of the spinning rotor 3 when the rotor housing 2 is closed in such a way that the fibres exiting the fibre guide channel 14 are fed at a relatively acute angle onto the fibre slide face 40. The fibres fed on subsequently arrive via the fibre slide face 40 into the rotor groove 41 of the spinning rotor 3, where, as known, the formation of a thread takes place, which is then drawn off via the tube 15. The diameter of the rotor groove 41 in the rotor cup 26 of the spinning rotor 3 is preferably below 30 mm in this case.<br>
In a channel plate 27 which has been modified according to the invention or a channel plate adapter 12 which has been modified according to the invention, the channel plate projection 30 is configured compared to the previously conventional channel plate adapters, which are shown in figures 4 and 6, in such a way that in particular the wall region 32 of the outlet opening 31 adjacent to the end face 42 of the channel plate projection 30 is lowered compared to the wall region 33 located behind the outlet opening 31. In other words, the channel plate projection 30 is preferably configured such that in particular a cylindrical outer surface section 50 has a spacing b from the longitudinal centre axis M of the channel plate 27, while the spacing a remains unchanged in the rear wall region 33. This measure, as shown, in particular by a comparison of figures 4, 6 with the figures 5, 7, leads to a significant enlargement of the outlet opening 31 of the fibre guide channel 14 in the direction of the spinning rotor 3.<br>
