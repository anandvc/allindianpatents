Cationic dyes exhibit very brilliant shades, A disadvantage is their unsatisfactory fastness to washing.<br>

Y1   is the direct bond; or ethylene; and<br><br>
A further emodiment of the present inveintion relates to processes for the preparation of the dyes of formula (1).<br>
Generally, the process comprises alkylating a thiirane compound of formula (1f) with the amino compound of formula (1e) to the compound of formula (1) according to the following reaction scheme:<br><br><br>
The reaction is generally initiated by contacting, for example by mixing together the starting compounds (1e) and (If) or by dropwise addition of one starting compound to the other.<br>
Customary, the temperature is in the range of 250 to 400 K, preferably in the range of 270 to 300 K during the mixing of the starting compounds.<br>
The reaction time is generally dependent on the reactivity of the starting compounds, on the selected reaction temperature and on the desired conversion. The reaction time is usually in the range from 1 to 3 days.<br>
The selected reaction pressure is generally in the range from 50 kPa to 3 MPa, especially from 100 kPa to 1 MPa, and is more especially atmospheric pressure.<br>
Preferably the reaction is carried out in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
The molar ratio of compound of formula (1b) to the catalyst is generally selected in the range from 10:1 to 1:5. especially in the range from 10:1 to 1:1.<br>
Preferred are acid catalysts. HA and Lewis acids like Ag+.<br>
In addition, the reaction may be carried out with or without a solvent, but is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent, preferably organic solvents or solvent mixtures.<br>
Preferred solvents are alcohols like methanol, ethanol. propanol. 2'propanol or butanol; nitriles like acetonitril or propionitril; amides like dimethylformamide. dimethylacetamide or N-methylpyrolidone; halogenated hydrocarbons like chloroform, methylenechloride, trichloro-ethylene or chlorobenzene; or other solvents like dimethylsulfoxide or water or mixtures of the mentioned solvents.<br><br>
The product prepared according to the process of the present invention may advantageously be worked up and isolated, and if desired be purified.<br>
Customary, the work up starts by decreasing the temperature of the reaction mixture in the range from 350 to 273 K, especially in the range from 320 to 273 K.<br>
It may be advantageous to decrease the temperature slowly over a period of several hours.<br>
In general, the reaction product is filtered off and then washed with water or a salt solution and subsequently dried.<br>
Filtration is normally earned out in standard filtering equipment, for example Buchner funnels, filter presses, pressurised suction filters, preferably in vacuo.<br>
The temperature for the drying is dependent on the pressure applied. Drying is usually carried out in vacuo at 50-200 mbar.<br>
The drying is usually carried out at a temperature in the range from 313 to 363 K, especially from 323 to 353 K, and more especially in the range from 328 to 348 K.<br>
Advantageously the product is purified by recrystallisation after isolation.<br>
The dyes of formula (1) according to the invention are suitable for dyeing organic materials, such as keratin-containing fibers, wool, leather, silk, cellulose or polyamides, cotton or nylon, and preferably human hair. The dyeings obtained are distinguished by their depth of shade and their good fastness properties to washing, such as, for example, fastness to light, shampooing and rubbing. The stability, in particular the storage stability of the dyes according to the invention are excellent.<br>
Gernerally, hair dyeing agents on a synthetic base may be classiefied itnto three groups:<br>
temporary dyeing agents semipermanent dyeing agents, and permanent dyeing agents.<br><br>
The multiplicity of shades of the dyes can be increased by combination with other dyes.<br>
Therefore the dyes of fonnula (1) of the present invention may be combined with dyes of the same or other classes of dyes, especially with direct dyes, oxidation dyes; dye precursor combinations of a coupler compound as well as a diazotized compound, or a capped diazotized compound; and/or cationic reactive dyes.<br>
Direct dyes are of natural origin or may be prepared synthetically. They are uncharged, cationic or anionic, such as acid dyes.<br>
The dyes of formula (1) may be used in combination with at least one single direct dye different from the dyes of formula (1).<br>
Direct dyes do not require any addition of an oxidizing agent to develop their dyeing effect. Accordingly the dyeing results are less permanent than those obtained with permanent dyeing compositions. Direct dyes are therefore preferably used for semipermanent hair dyeings.<br>
Examples of direct dyes are described in "Demiatology", edited by Ch. Culnan, H. Maibach, Verlag Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, Basle. 1986, Vol. 7, Ch. Zviak, The Science of Hair Care, chapter 7, p. 248-250, and in "Europaisches Inventar der Kosmetikrohstoffe", 1996, published by The European Commission, obtainable in diskette form from the Bundesver-band der deutschen Industrie- und Handelsunternehmen fur Arzneimittel, Reformwaren und Korperpflegemlttel e.V., Mannheim.<br>

Non-ionic surfactants contain as hydrophilic group, for example, a polyol group, a poly-alkylene glycol ether group or a combination of polyol and polyglycol ether groups. Such compounds are, for example:<br>
addition products of 2 to 30 mol of ethylene oxide and/or 0 to 5 mol of propylene oxide with linearar fatty alcohols having 8 to 22 carbon atoms, with fatty acids having 12 to 22 carbon atoms and with alkylphenols having 8 to 15 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, C12-C22 fatty acid mono- and di-esters of addition products of 1 to 30 mol of ethylene oxide with glycerol,<br><br>
C8-C22alkyl*mono- and -oligo-glycosides and ethoxylated analogues thereof,<br>
addition products of 5 to 60 mol of ethylene oxide with castor oil and hydrogenated<br>
castor oil,<br>
addition products of ethylene oxide with sorbitan fatty acid esters,<br>
addition products of ethylene oxide with fatty acid alkanolamides.<br>
The surfactants which are addition products of ethylene and/or propylene oxide with fatty alcohols or derivatives of such addition products may either be products having a "normal" homologue distribution or products having a restricted homologue distribution. "Normal" homologue distribution are mixtures of homologues obtained in the reaction of fatty alcohol and alkylene oxide using alkali metals, alkali metal hydroxides or alkali metal alcoholates as catalysts. Restricted homologue distributions, on the other hand, are obtained when, for example, hydrotalcites, alkali metal salts of ether carboxylic acids, alkali metal oxides, hydroxides or alcoholates are used as catalysts.<br>
The use of products having restricted homologue distribution may be preferred.<br>
Examples of cationic surfactants that can be used in the dyeing compositions according to the invention are especially quaternary ammonium compounds. Preference is given to ammonium halides, such as alkyltrimethylammonium chlorides, dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides and trialkylmethylammonium chlorides, for example cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, stearyltrimethylammonium chloride, distearyldimethy-lammonium chloride, lau-ryldimethylammonium chloride, lauryldimethylbenzylammonium chloride and tricetylmethyl-ammonium chloride.

SM-2059 (manufacturer: General Electric), SLM-55067 (manufacturer: Wacker) and also Abil®-Quat 3270 and 3272 (manufacturer: Th.

They are distinguished not only by a good conditioning action but also especially by their good biodegradability.<br>
Quaternary ester compounds^ so-called "esterquats", such as the methyl hydroxyalkyl-dialkoyloxyalkylammonium methosulfates marketed under the trademark Stepantex®. are also very readily biodegradable.<br>
An example of a quatemary sugar derivative that can be used as cationic surfactant is the commercial product Glucquat®100, according to CTFA nomenclature a "lauryl methyl glu-ceth-10 hydroxypropyl dimonium chloride".<br>
