"A LUBRICATING OIL COMPOSITION"<br>
NEW JAPAN CHEMICAL CO., LTD., a juridical person under the laws of Japan, of 13, Yoshijima Yagura-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto 612-8224, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil for compressors such as those of automotive air conditioners, refrigerators, room air conditioners, and large-scale refrigerators for industrial use, and is intended to provide a low-viscosity lubricating oil for refrigerators comprising a branched-chain carboxylic acid monoalkyl ester with outstanding hydrolytic stability.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Unlike the properties required of ordinary lubricating oils such as engine oils, transmission oils, hydraulic oils and turbine oils, considerably different performance is required of oils used in the compressors of refrigerators because of the use of refrigerants in refrigerators. Particularly, in cases where esters are used as the lubricating oil for refrigerators, the<br><br>
requisite properties include lubricity as well as miscibility with refrigerants, electrical insulating property and a high level of hydrolytic stability.<br>
Conventionally used refrigerants for refrigerators are fluorocarbons, such as those containing one or more chlorine atoms within the molecule, such as CFC-11 (trichloromonofluoromethane), CFC-12 (dichlorodifluoro-methane) and HCFC-22 (monochlorodifluoromethane). However, it has become increasingly evident that such volatile substances are destroying the ozone layer and are a source of global warming, leading to various adverse effects on humans and the earth's environment, so that the manufacture of CFC's is now prohibited, and there is an international commitment to step-wise reduction in HCFC level. Natural refrigerants such as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and ammonia, and replacement fluorocarbons such as HFC-134a, are increasingly being used instead as chorine-free refrigerants that will avoid destroying the ozone layer.<br>
Because of good miscibility that conventional chlorofluorocarbons have with lubricating oils based on mineral oils, such mineral oil lubricating oils were used as lubricating oils for refrigerators. Lubricating oils for refrigerators circulate in the refrigerator system along with refrigerant discharged from the compressor, and<br><br>
then the good miscibility between chlorofluorocarbons and mineral oil-based lubricating oils prevented the refrigerant and lubricating oil from separating.<br>
However, replacement fluorocarbons (hydrofluoro-carbons) such as HFC-134a have much higher molecular polarity than chlorofluorocarbons, they have poor miscibility with mineral oil-based lubricating oils. Poor miscibility between refrigerants and lubricating oils can result in the separation of the refrigerant and lubricating oil during operation, leading to seizure as a result of insufficiently lubricated compressors.<br>
This has led to the use of polyglycols (polyalkylene glycols, polyethers) or esters, which have good miscibility, as lubricating oils to be used with replacement fluorocarbons. However, the electrical insulating property of polyglycols is a problem, and although they can be used in automotive air conditioners, they are unsuitable for use in hermetic refrigerator compressors.<br>
Because esters have good electrical insulating properties, they can be used in various applications. Particularly, esters of neopentyl polyol and monovalent carboxylic acids (polyol esters) are actually being used.<br>
However, among the polyol esters, esters of straight-chain carboxylic acids have poor hydrolytic<br><br>
stability and are decomposed through hydrolysis, and therefore polyol esters of mixtures of branched and straight-chain carboxylic acids, or polyol esters of branched-chain carboxylic acids are being used. Even so, the hydrolytic stability thereof is still poor, requiring complicated operations, such as the need to monitor air and moisture during assembly and maintenance or repair of refrigerators. Thus, there is a need to develop esters with better hydrolytic stability. There is a particular need to develop esters having better electric insulating properties and miscibility with refrigerants, and better hydrolytic stability.<br>
On the other hand, aliphatic carboxylic acid monoesters such as coconut oil methyl ester, 2-ethylhexyl laurate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate and isobutyl stearate have conventionally been used as base oils in metal processing oils and the like. However, such aliphatic straight-chain carboxylic acid monoesters suffer from poor hydrolytic stability, and have poor miscibility with replacement fluorocarbons, making them unusable as lubricating oils for refrigerators.<br>
Furthermore, in light of the recent problem of global warming, there has been development of high-efficiency equipment for the purposes of energy conservation in various types of refrigerators in order to<br><br>
reduce carbon dioxide emission, which is a major cause of warming. To minimize energy loss in such equipment, there have been improvements in the materials for the parts that are used, and it has become essential to lower the viscosity of lubricating oils to reduce friction loss during operation. Examples of such low-viscosity oils include those with a kinematic viscosity (at 40 °C) of 32 mmVs (VG32) , 15 mm2/s (VG15) , 10 mm2/s (VG10) , and some with even lower viscosity properties. There is thus increasing demand for esters with lower viscosity and better hydrolytic stability.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide a lubricating oil for refrigerators that overcomes such drawbacks. A particular object of the present invention is to provide a low-viscosity lubricating oil for refrigeratiors with better invention<br>
hydrolytic stability.<br>
As a result of extensive research to achieve the aforementioned object, the present inventors has found that certain aliphatic branched-chain carboxylic acid monoalkyl esters, prepared by the esterification of a specific aliphatic saturated branched-chain carboxylic<br><br><br>
-6-acid and a specific monohydric alcohol, are excellent in hydrolytic stability, electrical insulating properties and miscibility with refrigerants, and also reduce the viscosity of lubricating oils for refrigerators, and these findings have led to the completion of the present invention.<br>
Thus, the lubricating oil for refrigerators according to the present invention comprises at least one aliphatic saturated branched-chain carboxylic acid monoalkyl ester represented by the formula (1)     <br><br>
wherein R1 is C1-C18 straight-chain alkyl or C3-C18 branched-chain alkyl; R2 is hydrogen, C1-C18  straight-chain alkyl or C3-C18 branched-chain alkyl; with the provisovithat the total number of carbon atoms contained in the alkyls represented by R1 and R2 is 2 to 18 and that when R2 is hydrogen, R1 is a branched-chain alkyl; and R3 is C1-C20 straight-chain alkyl, C3-C20 branched-chain alkyl or C3-C10 cycloalkyl.<br><br>
It has also been found that (I) at least one aliphatic saturated branched-chain carboxylic monoalkyl ester represented by the aforementioned formula (1) achieve(s) excellent advantages when used in combination with (II) a conventional lubricating oil for refrigerators, such as a fatty acid polyol ester, a phthalic acid ester, an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester, a polyvinyl ether, a hydrocarbon oil, a polyalkylene glycol or the like. For example, better hydrolytic stability is achieved in lubricating oils based on both components (I) and (II), and the reduction in the viscosity is achieved in lubricating oils based on components (I) and (II).<br>
Thus, the present invention also provides a lubricating oil for refrigerators, characterized in that it comprises a mixture of<br>
a)	at least one aliphatic saturated branched-chain carboxylic acid monoalkyl ester represented by the formula (1) and<br>
b)	at least one member selected from the group consisting of<br>

v) hydrocarbon oils, and<br>
vi) polyalkylene glycols, wherein the weight ratio of component a) : component b) is 0.5 : 99.5 to 99.5 : 0.5.<br>
It has also been found that the lubricating oil for refrigerators of the present invention, particularly its component, namely at least one aliphatic saturated branched-chain carboxylic acid monoalkyl ester represented by the aforementioned formula (1), has good miscibility with refrigerants, particularly hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, and that a mixture of at least one such ester and a refrigerant, particularly a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant, acts as a working fluid for refrigerators.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a working fluid composition for refrigerators, comprising (I) at least one aliphatic saturated branched-chain carboxylic acid monoalkyl ester represented by the formula (1) of the present invention and (II) a refrigerant (particularly at least one hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant).<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a working fluid composition for refrigerators, comprising (I) a) at least one aliphatic saturated branched-chain<br>
carboxylic acid monoalkyl ester represented by the<br><br>
above formula (1) , and b) at least one member selected from the group consisting of i) fatty acid polyol esters, ii) phthalic acid esters, iii) alicyclic dicarboxylic acid esters, iv) polyvinyl ethers, v) hydrocarbon oils and vi) polyalkylene glycols, and<br>

hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant).<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for lubricating a refrigerator, particularly a method for lubricating refrigerators using at least one hydrofluoro¬carbon refrigerant, characterized by the use of the aforementioned lubricating oil for refrigerators.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides use of an aliphatic saturated branched-chain carboxylic acid monoalkyl ester represented by the formula (1) as a lubricating oil for refrigerators, particularly as a luburicating oil for refregirators using a refrigerant (particularly at least one hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant).<br>

When a straight-chain alcohol is used in combination with a branched-chain alcohol, it is recommended that the content of a C12 to C20 straight-chain alcohols be 5 to 50   mol% of the total alcohol for the sake of better refrigerant miscibility and hydrolytic stability.<br>
Esterification<br>
In carrying out the esterification reaction, the<br>
  amounts of the starting materials are such that the alcohol represented by the formula (3) is used, for example, in an amount of 1 to 1.5 equivalents, preferably 1.05 to 1.2 equivalents, per equivalent of the carboxylic acid represented by the formula (2).<br>
)       The present ester can also be obtained by an ester interchange reaction in which, in place of the carboxylic acid represented by the formula (2) or the alcohol represented by the formula (3), a lower alcohol ester of said carboxylic acid and/or a C1 to C4 lower alkanoic acid<br>
	ester of an alcohol represented by the formula (3) such as<br><br>
an acetic acid ester or a propionic acid ester of said alcohol.<br>
It is preferable that the acid and alcohol components to be used in the esterification reaction are as free of impurities as possible. Impurities include metal compounds, hetero atom-containing compounds (such as sulfur-containing compounds, nitrogen-containing compounds, and phosphorus-containing compounds), and oxygen-containing compounds (such as peroxides and carbonyl compounds).<br>
Examples of esterifiteation catalyst include Lewis acids, alkali metals, and sulfonic acids. Specific examples of Lewis acids include aluminum derivatives, tin derivatives, and titanium derivatives. Specific examples of alkali metals include sodium alkoxides and potassium alkoxides. Specific examples of sulfonic acids include para-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, and sulfuric acid. Acidic ion exchange resins can also be used. Among them, C3 to C8 tetraalkyl titanates, titanium oxide, sodium Cx to C4 alkoxides, sodium hydroxide, C3 to C12 tin fatty acids, and tin oxide are preferred. These may be used, for example, in an amount of about 0.05 to 1 wt% relative to the total amount of the carboxylic acid represented by the formula (2) and the alcohol represented by the formula (3).<br><br>
The esterification temperature may be 100 to 230°C, and the reaction is normally completed within 3 to 30 hours.<br>
In the esterification, a water-entraining agent such as benzene, toluene, xylene and cyclohexane can be used to accelerate the distillation of the water produced by the reaction.<br>
Since the water absorption, hydrolytic stability, and electrical insulating properties will be adversely affected in the event that oxygen-containing compounds such as oxides, peroxides and carbonyl compounds are formed as a result of the oxidative degradation of the starting materials, the ester formed and the organic solvent (water-entraining agent) during esterification, the reaction is preferably carried out in a nitrogen or other inert gas atmosphere or in an inert gas stream.<br>
After the completion of the reaction, the excess starting materials are distilled off at reduced or normal pressure. The ester formed can then be purified by a conventional purification method, such as liquid-liquid extraction, distillation under reduced pressure, adsorption by treatment with activated carbon and so forth.<br>
The ester that is obtained may sometimes be contaminated by various impurities depending on the production process. Such impurities include acidic<br><br>
compounds, metal compounds (organometal compounds and inorganic metal compounds), hetero atom-containing compounds (such as sulfur-containing compounds, nitrogen-containing compounds and phosphorus-containing compounds), and oxygen-containing compounds (such as peroxides and carbonyl compounds). Such impurities lead to poor hydrolytic stability, electric insulating properties and thermal stability, and can also cause corrosion of metal components or production of sludge.<br>
Examples of processes for removing the acidic compounds include separation of unreacted starting acids by distillation, thorough neutralization with alkalis and thorough washing with water, and purification with adsorbents that are effective for removing acids. As to the processes for removing metal compounds, metal catalysts are removed, optionally after having been hydrolyzed, by filtration, optionally followed by purification treatment of the product with adsorbents that are effective for removing metals. Alkali metals used for neutralization can be removed by thorough washing with water, optionally followed by purification of the product with an adsorbent that is effective for removing metals. As to the processes for removing hetero atom compounds, there may be mentioned a sufficient neutralization with use of alkalis and washing with water for removing sulfur-<br><br>
containing catalysts and phosphorus-containing catalysts, and purification with an adsorbent that is effective for removing hetero atoms. Examples of processes for removing peroxides and carbonyl compounds include reduction treatment with metal hydrides such as sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride.<br>
Specific examples of the adsorbents used in such purification include natural and synthetic adsorbents, such as activated carbon, activated alumina, silica gel, silica alumina, activated clay, zeolites, magnesia, calcia, diatomaceous earth and hydrotalcite, as well as non-sulfonic acid-based ion exchange resins, synthetic hydrotalcites and similar synthetic adsorbents. Although the amount thereof to be used will vary depending on the type of adsorbent, an amount of 0.01 to 5 wt%, preferably 0.05 to 5 wt%, relative to the theoretical yield of the ester is usually recommended.<br>
Particularly, an ester purified by using one or more adsorbents selected from the group consisting of activated carbon, activated alumina, silica gel, activated clay, zeolites, hydrotalcite, non-sulfonic acid-based ion exchange resins and synthetic hydrotalcites at room temperature to 110°C, preferably room temperature to 90°C, has the following properties a) through h) and are especially suitable as lubricating oils for refrigerators.<br><br>
a)	The total acid number of the present esters is recommendably not more than 0.1 mgKOH/g, preferably not more than 0.05 mgKOH/g, and even more preferably not more than 0.03 mgKOH/g. A total acid number of not more than 0.1 mgKOH/g will make it easier to achieve good hydrolytic stability, with minimal metal corrosion property.<br>
b)	Ash content or sulfated ash content as defined in JIS-K-2272 of the present esters is recommendably not more than 30 ppm, preferably not more than 10 ppm, and even more preferably not more than 5 ppm. An ash content or sulfated ash content of not more than 30 ppm will easily allow better hydrolytic stability and thermal stability to be achieved.<br>
c)	The present esters recommendably have a sulfur content of not more than 50 ppm, preferably not more than 30 ppm, and even more preferably not more than 10 ppm. A sulfur content of not greater than 50 ppm will readily allow better hydrolytic stability and thermal stability to be achieved.<br>
d)	The present esters recommendably have a phosphorus content of not more than 50 ppm, preferably not more than 30 ppm, and even more preferably not more than 10 ppm. A phosphorus content not greater than 50 ppm will readily allow better hydrolytic stability and thermal stability to be achieved.<br><br>
e)	The present esters recommendably have a hydroxyl value of not more than 5 mgKOH/g, preferably not more than 3 mgKOH/g. A hydroxyl value of not greater than 5 mgKOH/g will readily result in an ester with less hygroscopicity, and will allow better hydrolytic stability and electrical insulating properties to be achieved.<br>
f)	The present esters recommendably have a peroxide value of not more than 1.0 meq/kg, preferably not more than 0.5 meq/kg. A peroxide value of not greater than 1.0 meq/kg will tend to result in better thermal stability.<br>
g)	The present ester recommendably have a carbonyl value of not more than 5.0, preferably not more than 3.0, and even more preferably not more than 1.0. A carbonyl value of not greater than 5.0 will result in better thermal stability.<br>
h) The hue of the present esters are recommendably such that they have a Hazen number of not greater than 100, preferably not greater than 50, and even more preferably not greater than 30. A Hazen number of not greater than 100 will result in better thermal stability.<br>

Further, among such 2-ethylhexanoate esters, it is recommended, in view of excellent refrigerant miscibility and electrical insulating properties, to use at least one<br><br>
member selected from the group consisting of isopropyl 2-ethylhexanoate, isobutyl 2-ethylhexanoate, (sec-butyl) 2-ethylhexanoate, cyclohexyl 2-ethylhexanoate, (n-heptyl) 2-ethylhexanoate, isoheptyl 2-ethylhexanoate, (2-ethylhexyl) 2-ethylhexanoate, (1-methylheptyl) 2-ethylhexanoate, isooctyl 2-ethylhexanoate, isononyl 2-ethylhexanoate, (3,5,5-trimethylhexyl) 2-ethylhexanoate, (2,6-dimethyl-4-heptyl) 2-ethylhexanoate, isodecyl 2-ethylhexanoate and isoundecyl 2-ethylhexanoate.<br>
The esters of the present invention recommendably have a volume resistivity of 1 x 1011  Ω cm or more, preferably lxlO12 Ω cm or more, and more preferably lxlO13 Ω cm or more. A volume resistivity of less than 1011 Ω-cm is less likely to result in good electrical insulating properties.<br>
Preferably, the ester of the present invention separates from refrigerant at a temperature of 10°C or lower, particularly 0°C or lower, and even more preferably -10°C or lower.<br>
The esters of the present invention have a kinematic viscosity of 0.5 to 15 mm2/s at 40°C, preferably 0.5 to 10 mmVs at 40°C.<br>
In general, exposing the ester to elevated temperatures in the presence of water will result in decomposition into the corresponding carboxylic acid and<br><br>
alcohol. It is known that refrigerator lubricating oils are exposed to very high temperatures caused by friction during the operation of compressors. The presence of water in the refrigerator system might result in the hydrolysis of the ester serving as the lubricating oil. It is considered that minimal increase in the total acid number following heat treatment of the ester is indicative of suppressed hydrolysis and higher stability. When compared by this method, polyol esters which can be used as low-viscosity refrigerator lubricating oils suffer from greater increase in the total acid number, greater change in the weight of iron piece immersed in the oil, and changes in appearance due to surface corrosion of metal such as iron, copper and aluminum.<br>
By contrast, the present esters are sufficiently resistant to hydrolysis so that there is less increase in acid number and less change in appearance due to surface corrosion of iron and copper.<br>
Combined use of present ester and other base oil<br>
The lubricating oil for refrigerators according to the present invention can be mixed with at least one other base oil (henceforth, "combination base oil" to prepare a lubricating oil for refrigerators, provided that the<br><br>
effects of the present invention are not thereby compromised.<br>
The aliphatic saturated branched-chain carboxylic acid monoalkyl ester (a) represented by the formula (1) and the combination base oil (b) are used in a weight ratio of (a) : (b) = 0.5:99.5 to 99.5:0.5, preferably (a):(b)= 5:95 to 95:5, and even more preferably (a):(b)= 15:85 to 85:15.<br>
Examples of the combination base oils include one or more members selected from the group consisting of (bl) hydrocarbon oils, (b2) organic acid esters other than the present ester, (b3) polyalkylene glycols, (b4) polyvinyl ethers, (b5) polyphenyl ethers, (b6) alkyl phenyl ethers, and (b7) silicone oils. These will be described below.<br>

Working fluid composition for refrigerators<br>
The present invention is also intended to provide a working fluid composition for refrigerators comprising the lubricating oil for refrigerators according to the present invention and a refrigerant as described above.<br>
That is, researches by the inventors revealed that the lubricating oil for refrigerators according to the present invention, particularly the ester represented by the formula (1), has good miscibility with refrigerants, such as the aforementioned hydrocarbon refrigerants, halogen-containing hydrocarbon refrigerants, perfluoroether and other fluoroether refrigerants, dimethyl ether and other such fluorine-free ether refrigerants, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and similar refrigerants, especially at least one such refrigerant selected from the group consisting of the aforementioned hydrocarbon and halogen-containing hydrocarbon refrigerants (especially hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants).<br><br>
It was thus discovered that a mixture of (I) the lubricating oil for refrigerators according to the present invention and (II) a refrigerant, such as the aforementioned hydrocarbon refrigerant, halogen-containing hydrocarbon refrigerant, perfluoroether and other fluoroether refrigerant, dimethyl ether and other such fluorine-free ether refrigerant, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and similar refrigerant, especially at least one refrigerant selected from the group consisting of the aforementioned hydrocarbon and halogen-containing hydrocarbon refrigerants (especially hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants) function as a working fluid for refrigerators.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a working fluid composition comprising:<br>
(I)	an aliphatic saturated branched-chain carboxylic<br>
acid monoalkyl ester represented by the formula (1),<br>
and<br>
(II)	a refrigerant, such as the aforementioned<br>
hydrocarbon refrigerant, halogen-containing hydrocarbon<br>
refrigerant, perfluoroether and other fluoroether<br>
refrigerant, dimethyl ether and other such fluorine-<br>
free ether refrigerant, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and<br>
similar refrigerant; particularly at least one<br>
refrigerant selected from the group consisting of the<br><br>
aforementioned hydrocarbon and halogen-containing hydrocarbon refrigerants (especially hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants).<br>
The ratio of the aforementioned component (I) to component (II) is generally (I) :(II) = 1:99 to 85:15, preferably 2:98 to 80:20, by weight.<br>
The present invention also provides a working fluid composition comprising:<br>
(I)	(a) at least one aliphatic saturated branched-<br>
chain carboxylic acid monoalkyl ester represented<br>
by the formula (1), and<br>
(b) at least one member selected from the group consisting of (i) the fatty acid polyol esters, (ii) the phthalic acid esters, (iii) the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid esters, (iv) the polyvinyl ethers, (v) the hydrocarbon oils and (vi) the polyalkylene glycols, and<br>
(II)	a refrigerant, such as the aforementioned<br>
hydrocarbon refrigerant, halogen-containing<br>
hydrocarbon refrigerant, perfluoroether and other<br>
fluoroether refrigerant, dimethyl ether and other<br>
such fluorine-free ether refrigerant, carbon<br>
dioxide, ammonia, and similar refrigerant,<br>
particularly at least one refrigerant selected<br>
from the group consisting of the aforementioned<br><br>
hydrocarbon and halogen-containing hydrocarbon refrigerants (especially hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants). The ratio of components (a) to (b) in component (I) above is, for example, (a):(b) = 0.5:99.5 to 99.5:0.5, preferably (a):(b) = 5:95 to 95:5, more preferably (a):(b) = 15:85 to 85:15, by weight. The ratio of component (I) to component (II) is generally (I) :(II) = 1:99 to 85:15, preferably 2:98 to 80:20, by weight.<br>
When such a mixture is used as working fluid, an advantage is that the lubricating oil of the present invention will be miscible over a wide temperature range, from low to elevated temperatures, with refrigerants such as the aforementioned hydrocarbon refrigerants, halogen-containing hydrocarbon refrigerants, perfluoroether and other fluoroether refrigerants, dimethyl ether and other such fluorine-free ether refrigerants, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and similar refrigerants, particularly at least one refrigerant selected from the group consisting of the aforementioned hydrocarbon and halogen-containing hydrocarbon refrigerants (especially hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants) . The working fluid is less likely to cause phase separation.<br><br>
The lubricating oil of the present invention can be used to lubricate the aforementioned types of refrigerators. Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of such a refrigerator.<br>
The refrigerator is composed primarily of a compressor 1, condenser 2, expansion valve 3, evaporator 4, and tubing 5 connecting the various components. A dryer (not shown) may also be included as needed.<br>
The method for lubricating refrigerators is described below with reference to a refrigerator using a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant, but the method for lubricating refrigerators using other refrigerants is basically the same.<br>
A working fluid composition comprising the lubricating oil of the present invention and a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant is introduced into the compressor 1 of the refrigerator. At this point, the working fluid composition may be used in an amount effective for operating the refrigerator. In general, the amount may be determined in accordance with the performance required of the refrigerator, the intended application, and so forth. The amount of the working fluid composition can be suitably selected in accordance<br><br>
with the knowledge of those having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The refrigerant is primarily compressed by the compressor 1 and is passed through the tubing 5, and the compressed refrigerant is liquefied by the condenser 2, and is guided through the expansion valve 3 to the evaporator 4, where the refrigerant is vaporized to effect heat exchange through the evaporator 4. At this point, most of the refrigerator oil remains in the compressor 1, but the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant is present as dissolved in the refrigerator oil. During this refrigerator cycle,  a small amount of the refrigerator oil circulates in the device along with the refrigerant.<br>
The compressor 1 illustrated here is a compressor with an open, semi-open, or hermetic compressor, depending on the method by which the compression parts and the motor driving them are assembled. Due to differences in the compression method, there are refrigerators with reciprocal, rotary, scroll or screw compressors, as well as refrigerators with centrifugal compressors, but any of them can be used.<br>
The lubricating oil of the present invention results in better operation of the compressor 1 because of good miscibility between the lubricating oil of the present invention and the hydrofluorocarbon in the compressor 1.<br><br>
Since the working fluid composition is less likely to cause phase separation, the lubricating oil is less likely to localize in areas other than the compressor 1. Furthermore, the lubricating oil of the present invention has good hydrolytic stability and causes a small increase in the total acid number, so that less corrosion is encountered in the compressor 1, condenser 2, expansion valve 3, evaporator 4, or tubing 5 connecting such parts. At the same time, the lubricating oil of the present invention has low viscosity, leading to less energy loss as a result of friction during the operation of the refrigerator. The working fluid composition also has excellent insulating properties, and thus serves as an insulating oil to prevent leakage in the compressor motors of refrigerators having hermetic or semi-hermetic compressors, making the oil of the invention especially desirable for use in refrigerators with hermetic compressors.<br>
Examples of compressor 1 include (1) high pressure container compressors, in which a hermetic container holding the refrigerator oil houses a motor comprising a rotor and stator, a rotating shaft fixed to the rotor, and a compressor device connected to the motor via the rotating shaft and a high pressure refrigerant gas discharged from the compressor device is held in the<br><br>
hermetic container; and (2) low pressure container compressors, in which a hermetic container holding the refrigerator oil houses a motor comprising a rotor and stator, a rotating shaft fixed to the rotor, and a compressor device connected to the motor via the rotating shaft and a high pressure refrigerant gas discharged from the compressor device is directly discharged out of the hermetic container.<br>
As an insulating film serving as a material in the electrical insulation system of the motor, preferably usable are crystalline plastic films with a glass transition point of 50°C or higher, specifically an insulating film made of at least one member selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyphenylene sulfide, polyether ether ketone, polyethylene naphthalate, polyamideimide and polyimide, or a composite film comprising a film with a low glass transition temperature covered by a resin layer with a higher glass transition temperature, because of lower susceptibility to loss of tensile strength or electrical insulating properties. The magnet wire used in the motor is preferably coated with an enamel having a glass transition temperature of 120°C or higher, such as a single layer of polyester, polyester imide, polyamide or polyamideimide, or an enamel coating<br><br>
comprising a composite coating composed of a lower layer with a low glass transition temperature and an upper layer with a higher glass transition temperature. Examples of enamel wires coated with such composite coating include those having a polyester imide lower layer and a polyamideimide upper layer (AI/EI), and those having a polyester lower layer and a polyamideimide upper layer (AI/PE) .<br>
The dessicant to be used in the dryer is preferably a synthetic zeolite comprising a silicate and aluminate alkali metal complex salt with a pore diameter of not more than 3.3 A and a carbon dioxide gas absorption capacity of not more than 1.0% at a carbon dioxide partial pressure of<br>
250 mmHg at 25°C. Specific examples include XH-9, XH-10, XH-11, and XH-600, manufactured by Union Showa.<br>

Examples 1 through 5 show that the present esters have good hydrolytic stability, have a small increase in total acid number, and cause substantially no change on metal surfaces. Their refrigerant miscibility and electrical insulating properties are also excellent. They<br>
also have an extremely low kinematic viscosity at 40°C, are capable of reducing energy loss during the operation of refrigerators, and are effective for saving energy.<br>
On the other hand, Comparative Examples 1 and 2 show that aliphatic straight-chain monocarboxylic acid esters have poor hydrolytic stability and refrigerant miscibility.<br>
In Examples 6 through 14, the ester was mixed with various other esters. The oil mixtures with a kinematic viscosity at 40°C adjusted to between 10 and 15 mm2/s also have good hydrolytic stability, and therefore the present esters can be used as viscosity regulators to reduce the viscosity.<br>
Comparative Examples 3 through 5, on the other hand, show that branched-chain carboxylic acid esters of neopentyl glycol suffered a large increase in total acid number, with a tendency to cause a greater level of metal corrosion.<br><br>
