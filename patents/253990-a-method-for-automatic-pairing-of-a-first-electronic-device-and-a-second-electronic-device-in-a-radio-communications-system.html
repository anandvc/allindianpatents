				<td>The present invention relates to a method for automatic pairing of a first electronic device and a second electronic device in a radio communications system.<br>
The present invention relates to a method and device for pairing of electronic Bluetooth devices, and particularly for pairing a device with an accessory to the device, e.g. a mobile phone with a headset. More; specifically, the invention relates to a method for automatic pairing with a high level of security.<br>
State of the art<br>
Systems and protocols for communication between electronic devices have been provided in many different forms through the years. In recent years, an attempt has been made to standardise a system for short range radio communication between electronic devices, under the name Bluetooth. Bluetooth is basically a wireless personal area network technology, which is an open standard for short-range transmission of digital voice and data between predominantly mobile devices, such as laptops, Personal Digital Assistants PDA,, and mobile phones, but also between mobile devices and stationary devices, and between stationary devices, such as printers,.computers, fax machines and so on. Bluetooth supports point-to-point and multipoint applications. Bluetooth typically provides up to 720 Kbps data transfer within a range of 10 meters and up to 100 meters with a power boost. Bluetooth uses omni -directional radio waves that can transmit through walls and other non-metal barriers in the unlicensed 2.4GHz band.<br>
To use Bluetooth communication between two devices, the two devices need to first establish a trusted relationship. This is done through the Bluetooth pairing, sometimes referred to as bonding, process. During pairing, one and the same passkey is entered in both devices. For the example of using a wireless headset with a mobile phone, the user has first to pair the two device together to ensure that GSM subscription is protected and integrity for voice calls is kept. Since Bluetooth has normally at least 10 m range, the user need to confirm that connections are to be established in order to ensure that it is the right devices that get connected. Some Bluetooth devices, like headsets, have no user interface so they use a fixed passkey. <br>
To simplify logistics, the value of this is sometimes the same in alt sample^, e.g.<br>
]<br>
"0000" in all Sony Ericsson headsets.	|<br>
In a typical state of the art solution for pairing a headset with a mobile phone, the pairing process involves the steps of:<br>
making headset discoverable and pairable, e.g. by simply by<br>
powering on the headset;<br>
initiating a pairing procedure from the phone;<br>
selecting a headset to pair with from a list of such devices that were<br>
discovered as a result of starting the pairing procedure;<br>
entering a passkey mat corresponds to the headset to pair with, e.g. a<br>
standard passkey for these types of devices. A problem with the current solution is that many users find it highly non-<br>
i<br>
intuitive and cumbersome to perform all the necessary steps which include<br>
decisions that users may not be accustomed to. And if some problem occurs in one<br>
of the steps, it is difficult to correct it. Furthermore, using the same, un-changeable,<br>
passkey for all devices of a certain type, such as hands-free headsets, is considered<br>
to imply a reduced security level.	I<br>

Brief description of the drawings<br>
The invention will be described in detail below with reference to thje accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic drawing of a mobile terminal and a headset communicating point-to point in a radio communications system; and<br>
Fig. 2 schematically illustrates pairing of the electronic devices of Ifig. 1, according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
The present description relates to the field of electronic devices which are capable of being interconnected by means of direct short range radio communication, such as by means of Bluetooth. Such devices include all mobile radio terminals devised for radio communication with a radio station, which radio station also may be mobile terminal or e.g. a stationary base station. Consequently,<br><br>
the term radio terminal includes mobile telephones, pagers, communicators!,<br>
i !<br>
electronic organisers, smartphones, PDA:s (Personal Digital Assistants) arid DECT terminals (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephony). Electronic devices capable of<br>
I<br>
making use of the present invention further includes stationary devices, such as desktop computers, fax machines, printers and so on, which are communicatively connectable to mobile equipment by means of direct short range radio       i communication. Furthermore, it should be emphasised that the term comprising or comprises, when used in this description and in the appended claims to indicate included features, elements or steps, is in no way to be interpreted as excluding the<br>
';<br>
presence of other features elements or steps than those expressly stated.<br>
Examples of embodiments will now be described with references mftde to the<br>
accompanying drawing. The invention will mainly be described with reference to a<br>
first electronic device in the form of a mobile telephone, and a second electronic<br>
device in the fbrm of a passive accessory, such as a headset or a hands free! kit The<br>
devices should be provided with means for communicating by radio, such as a<br>
Bluetooth connection.	i<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a typical arena for the present invention, wherein a headset 1 is useable for conveying audio data to and from a radio telephone 30 over 4 first type transmission link 36. The radio telephone 30, as such, communicates with base stations 38 of a mobile telephone system, over a second type transmission link. The communication terminal is disclosed in the embodiment of a cellular mobile phone 30 devised for radio communication. The terminal 30 comprises a chassis pr housing 34, carrying a user audio input in the fbrm of a microphone 32 and! a user audio output in the form of a loudspeaker 33. A set of keys, buttons or the Uke constitutes a data input interface 35, and is usable e.g. for dialling, according to the established art. A data output interface comprising a display 31 is further included,<br>
I<br>
devised to display communication information, address list etc in a manner! well known to the skilled person. The radio communication terminal 30 include^ radio transmission and reception electronics, and is devised with an antenna, suciji as a traditional stub antenna or a built-in low profile antenna device inside the housing 34, for communicating with a base station 38 by over an air interface, e.g. defined<br><br>
by NMT, PDC, CDMA, GSM or WCDMA. In the illustrated embodiment^ the terminal 30 is rally operational without the headset 1, by carrying its own jmdio interface 32,33. In an alternative embodiment, the terminal may lack eitheif speaker 33 or microphone 32, or both, only being useable for conveying audio signals by use of the headset 1.<br>
The communication between the headset 1 and the terminal 30 is preferably<br>
achieved by a transmission interface which is different from that of the<br>
communication between the terminal 30 and the network base stations 38. More<br>
specifically, communication over transmission link 36 is preferably achieved over a<br>
short range radio, preferably Bluetooth.	;<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the process of automatic pairing of devices according to an embodiment of the invention. In the illustrated embodiment, a first electronic device is provided in the form of a mobile radio terminal 30, and a second electronic device is provided in the form of a cordless headset or hands-free device 1 i Both terminal 30 and headset 1 are provided with Bluetooth transceiver means, and are thus devised for communicative connection. Bluetooth typically has a range of about 10m, which means that there may well be several different Bluetooth devices within the coverage area of headset 1, which is one of the reasons why pairing is a crucial element in Bluetooth communication. In Fig. 2, the range Rl of headset 1 in normal Bluetooth communication defines a coverage area 50, a portion of which is indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 2. Within coverage area 50, terminal 3(j) is located, and also a second terminal 40. The invention brings about an advantage over prior art solutions by removing the need for a user to interact during the pairing procedure. Furthermore, a secure pairing procedure is provided, such that ijhe correct devices are paired, in this case terminal 30 and headset 1. All the u$er needs to understand is that the two devices need to be in close range from each o^her when the Bluetooth function in at least one of the devices is turned on.<br>
The process steps a user needs to take to pair terminal 30 to headset 1 can be described as follows, for the illustrated embodiment:<br>
The user brings terminal 30 and headset 1 in close proximity to each other, e.g. by holding one in each hand;<br><br>
The user turns die Bluetooth function on in the un-paired terminal 30, upon which the terminal is made discoverable and pairable. This step may be performed before the first step described above;; The user powers on the un-paired headset 1; The terminal 30 and the headset 1 performs paring automatically and the user is notified about the successful outcome, e.g. through sound and text indications. Possibly, user confirmation using the terminal interface may be included.<br>
The invention covers what happens during the third step above, starting with the headset being powered on.<br>
In one embodiment, a key element is the usage of an extremely low output power, e.g. -50 dBm, when transmitting an inquiry signal from headset 1. The output power, in turn, reflects the range R2 of headset 1. In Fig. 2 the range R2 is illustrated by a circle, which defines a coverage area 60 for headset 1 whep transmitting in a low power mode. The range R2, which is considerably smaller than the standard transmission range Rl, may e.g. be 2 m, 1m, 0.5 m or even smaller.<br>
Upon transmitting the inquiry signal from headset 1, in the low power mode defining a range R2, any active Bluetooth device within coverage area 60 may generate and transmit a response signal. By using the low power mode as described, the probability for more than one device being located within coverage ar^a 60 is very small. Needless to say, the lower the power, i.e. the smaller range R2J, the lower the probability of receiving more than one inquiry response signal ffozn other devices.<br>
When headset 1 receives a first inquiry response signal, it aborts the inquiry process and start paging the sender of the response signal. In the illustrated embodiment, terminal 30 is the only device within coverage area 60, and ifill therefore be the device sending the inquiry response signal. Once this inquiry response signal is detected by headset 1, transmission of the inquiry signal is interrupted This way, headset 1 is devised to set up communication with flic closest device.<br><br>
In a more advanced embodiment, transmission of the inquiry signal is performed with an increasing output power, rendering a range R2(t) which! is increasing with time. Starting from zero, or a very low original output power value, the output power is increased at a certain rate until either full output powetf, representing the full range Rl, has been reached, or until a first inquiry response signal has been detected This way, an even higher degree of certainty is achieved m finding and connecting with the closest Bluetooth device, terminal 30 in the illustrated example.<br>
In yet another embodiment, an attenuation of the sensitivity to dete<jrtion of inquiry response signals is used instead a low output power. in such an embodiment the signal transmitted from headset at full power or predetermined lower level and attenuation input sedsor set to only sense certain representing range r2. furthermore also this may employ time-depending functioji that die sensitivity decreased rate thereby increasing></jrtion>
When terminal 30 responds to the page, the headset 1 preferably establishes a High Level Authentication (HLA) connection to the terminal 30, e.g. by using some standard security protocol, or other type of protocol, on top of the Bluetooth L2CAP protocol. Examples of usable security protocols include "Entity authentication using public key cryptography", FIPS PUB 196; "Entity authentication using a cryptographic check function", ISO 9798-4; and TLS, "Transport Layer Security" protocol v. 1.0, RFC 2246.<br>
On the HLA connection, headset 1 requests terminal 30 to start pairing. Headset 1 preferably retrieves a private key from a memory, and transmits said private key to terminal 30.<br>
Terminal 30 subsequently verifies that headset 1 is a trusted devicejby using a certificate and said private key.<br>
By means of the high level authentication, the terminal 30 and the headset 1 creates a common and unique passkey, preferably comprising 16 unpredictable characters.<br><br>
Terminal 30 thereby initiates pairing using the newly derived passkey.<br>
The invention removes three cumbersome user interactions steps fro^n the pairing process, in that:<br>
I.	The user no longer needs to start the pairing process manually. In<br>
the preferred embodiment, automatic pairing is performed upon power on of at least one of the devices to be paired. Typically, an<br>
t<br>
accessory to be paired with an electronic device will be turned on<br>
when it is held in proximity to the device. One example is a headset<br>
used as an accessory to an electronic device in the form of a mobile<br>
phone. Another example is a mouse used as an accessory to an<br>
electronic device in the form of a computer. The electronic device<br>
may on the other hand be powered on already.<br>
13.	The user no longer needs to select a device in a list of located<br>
devices, since the closest one is automatically located and Selected to be the pairing partner.<br>
III.        The user no longer needs to enter a passkey manually, since key transmission is performed automatically between the pairing devices.<br>
All together, the invention makes the pairing process a lot simpler than prior art solutions, and therefore more attractive to average non-technical consumers. Furthermore, compared to the current solution where a commonly known passkey is used by all headsets, the use of a unique and long passkey increases the security level considerably.<br>
The foregoing has described the principles, preferred embodiments £nd modes of operation of the present invention. However, the invention should be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive, and not as being limited to the particular embodiments discussed above. For one thing, it should be appreciated that the relation between output power and range cannot be represented by I an absolute number, rather it is dependent on other factors such as how well shielded one or both devices are from each other. It should therefore be appreciated! that variations may be made in the disclosed embodiments by persons skilled in the art<br><br>
