				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to a joint yoke for a universal joint and also to a universal joint comprising the same.<br>
US 5 647 799A describes a universal joint having a joint yoke, which comprises a longitudinal axis. The joint yoke comprises a base portion centred on the longitudinal axis, from which two yoke arms extend. These are arranged off-set in opposite directions from the longitudinal axis. Each yoke arm comprises a support bore. The support bores of both yoke arms are arranged on a common bore axis, which extends at a right angle to the longitudinal axis. Each yoke arm has two arm portions, which are formed integrally with the base portion and project therefrom. The two arm portions are separated by the support bore and have end faces distanced from the base portion. In each of these end faces, respectively, a threaded bore is arranged. Furthermore, each yoke arm comprises a bridge element, which connects its two arm portions and has abutment faces formed in correspondence with the end faces and by which the bridge element abuts the two end faces of the arm portions and which bridge element is fastened by means of screws. For this, the bridge elements have respectively in the abutment faces a through bore, through which a threaded headed screw can be screwed into the threaded bore of the corresponding arm portion.<br>
Such joint yokes and therefore, also universal joints, which have these joint yokes, are designed for a specific torque range. For high torques, as they for example are present in drives of rolling mills, bridge elements can be provided, which are attached by more than one screw on the corresponding arm portion. The rotational diameter of<br>
-1-<br><br>
2<br>
such joint yokes is however limited, as in the assembled condition only a small space is available. Because of this reason a as high as possible torque capacity has to be achieved. This means, that for a joint yoke a as large as possible bearing bush has to be provided, because of which the support bore has to be formed correspondingly large. This means, that the size of the bridge element and, therefore, also the size of the end faces are dependent on the one side on the size of the support bore and on the other side on the rotational diameter. Therefore, the connection between the bridge element and the arm portions are of special importance.<br>
The invention has the object to provide a joint yoke, which has a high torque capacity.<br>
The object is solved according to the invention by a joint yoke for a universal joint comprising<br>
a longitudinal axis,<br>
a base portion,<br>
centred on the longitudinal axis,<br>
two yoke arms,<br>
off-set in opposite directions from the longitudinal axis,<br>
having, respectively, a support bore, wherein the support bores have a<br>
common bore axis, extending at a right angle to the longitudinal axis,<br>
having, respectively, two arm portions integral with the base portion, separated by the support bore and having end faces, distanced from the base portion, with at least two threaded bores, which centres, respectively projected onto the bore axis of the neighbouring support bore, are arranged with different distances to the longitudinal axis, wherein the threaded bore, arranged with the largest distance to the longitudinal axis, has a larger diameter than the other threaded bores, having, respectively, a bridge portion, connecting the two arm portions and provided with abutment faces formed correspondingly to the end faces and in which through bores are arranged, which are formed and arranged in correspondence to the threaded bores,<br><br>
3<br>
screws,<br>
serving for the attachment of the bridge elements on the arm portions of the yoke arms and adapted to the threaded bores and the through bores.<br>
Advantageous in this embodiment is, that the screws, arranged, when projected onto the bore axis, furthest away from the longitudinal axis, ensure, that the torque capacity is remarkably increased compared to an arrangement, in which the screws and, therefore, the threaded bores have the same diameter.<br>
Another advantage is that, because of the fact, that the threaded bores, arranged in reference to the bore axis closer to the longitudinal axis, and therefore, also the corresponding screws are formed smaller, also the angularity of the two joint yokes of a universal joint towards each other can be increased. So, with the same layout a larger bending angle can be achieved.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention it is provided, that the end faces of the arm portions and the abutment faces of the bridge elements are provided with a toothing. Preferably, its teeth extend parallel to the bore axis. Because of this, the connection between the two arm portions via the bridge element is further improved, as the arm portion which depending on the rotational direction is not loaded, is stronger involved in the transmission.<br>
In the case, that three threaded bores are provided, it is possible, to form two of the threaded bores with the same diameter, while the third threaded bore, which is arranged, when projected onto the bore axis of the neighbouring support bore, in the end face furthest away from the longitudinal axis, has a larger diameter. In case that three threaded bores are provided, that it is also possible to form all with different diameters. All three threaded bores, can be arranged with different distances, when projected onto the bore axis of the neighbouring support bore, to the longitudinal axis. In a further embodiment of the invention it is provided, that per end face the threaded bore, which has the largest diameter, has the smallest distance to the bore axis.<br><br>
4<br>
Furthermore, the threaded bores, provided per end face, can be arranged all with different distances to the bore axis.<br>
Preferably, the threaded bore, which is arranged, when projected onto the bore axis of the neighbouring support bore, with the largest distance to the longitudinal axis is increased by 1 to 35% compared to the next smaller threaded bore, whereby an immense increase in the transmissibility can be achieved. When for example this threaded bore is increased in size by around 20% in diameter compared to the next smaller threaded bore, an increase in the torque capacity of more than 20% compared to an arrangement, in which all threaded bores of an end face have the same diameter, can be achieved.<br>
The object according to the invention is also solved by a universal joint, which comprises a first joint yoke, which is formed according to one or more of the features of the joint yoke according to the invention, a second joint yoke and a journal cross, connecting the first joint yoke and the second joint yoke.<br>
Preferably, the second joint yoke is also formed like the first joint yoke according to the features of the joint yoke according to the invention.<br>
In the/drawing one embodiment of the joint yoke and of a universal joint according to the invention are schematically represented.<br>
Figure 1	is a side view of a universal joint with a joint yoke according to<br>
the invention.<br>
Figure 2	shows a joint yoke according to the invention as an individual<br>
component, partially in sectional view;<br>
Figure 3	shows a top view to Figure 2, wherein, however, the bridge ele-<br>
ment is represented in a disassembled condition;<br><br>
Figure 4	shows a partial representation of the joint yoke of Figure 3, with<br>
view onto an end face of the first yoke arm in an enlarged scale;<br>
Figure 5	shows a view corresponding to Figure 4, however, with an as-<br>
sembled bridge element.<br>
Figure 1 shows a universal joint having the first joint yoke 2 and the second joint yoke 3, which are articulatably connected to each other by means of a journal cross 4. All components are shown centred on the longitudinal axis 5, which means, that the first joint yoke 2 is not be bent in reference to the second joint yoke 3.<br>
Both joint yokes 2, 3 can be formed in the same way. However, both may also differ in design. One of these joint yokes, namely the first joint yoke 2, is described in more detail concerning the embodiment in the following. It comprises a base portion 6, centred on the longitudinal axis 5, and two yoke arms, namely the first yoke arm 7 and the second yoke arm 8. Both are attached off-set in opposite direction to the longitudinal axis 5 on the base portion 6.<br>
The first joint yoke 2 formed according to the invention is described by means of Figures 2 to 5.<br>
The first joint yoke 2 comprises the first yoke arm 7, which in the representation of Figure 2 is arranged off-set towards the top from the longitudinal axis 5, and the second yoke arm 8, which in Figure 2 is arranged off-set towards the bottom from the longitudinal axis 5. The two yoke arms 7, 8 are formed the same. A support bore 9 extends through the two yoke arms 7, 8, respectively. Both support bores 9 are centred on the bore axis 10. The bore axis 10 extends at a right angle to the longitudinal axis 5. The two yoke arms 7, 8 are formed in the same way and are formed separately and comprise, respectively, two arm portions and a bridge element 15 and 18, respectively. Following the construction of a yoke arm, namely of the first yoke arm 7, will be described in detail. This description is also valid for the construction of the second yoke arm 8.<br><br>
6<br>
As it is especially visible from Figure 3, the first yoke arm 7<br>
comprises two arm portions, namely the first arm portion 11  and<br>
the second arm portion 12 distanced from the first  arm  portion<br>
and which are  connected  integrally to the base portion 6 of the<br>
first joint  yoke 2. The two arm portions 11, 12 are separated<br>
from each other by means of the bore portion 9a of  the  support<br>
bore 9.  They have end faces 13 or 14, respectively, distanced<br>
from the  base  portion  6,  which,  respectively,  are provided<br>
with a toothing, which teeth extend preferably parallel  to  the<br>
bore axis 10 of the neighbouring support bore 9. As the yoke arm<br>
is split, portion 9b of the support bore 9 forms part  of  the<br>
bridge element 15. The bridge element 15 has two abutment faces<br>
16, 17, wherein the first abutment face 16 is formed in<br>
correspondence to the first end face 13 and the second  abutment<br>
face 17 is formed correspondence to the second end face 14. The<br>
toothings of both faces 13, 16 or 14,17, respectively,  form  a<br>
pair and  engage  in  each  other, so  that  an   interengaging<br>
connection between the bridge element 15 on the one side and  the<br>
two arm portions 11,12 on the other side is given.  Additionally<br>
it is provided? that the bridge element 15 is connected  in  the area  of  the  end  faces  13,  14  or  abutment  faces  16, 7<br>
respectively,  to  the arm portions 11 or  12,  respectively,  by<br>
means of screws. For this, in the bridge element 15 through bores<br><br>
6A<br>
are provided in   the area of the abutment faces 16, 17. Although several headed screws are used for the connection, which are shown in  Figure 5 and are arranged as desribed in detail in  the following, only one through bare 25 is visible in Figure 3,<br>
In   figure 4 the arrangement and the layout of threaded bores 19, 20, 21 in   reference to the first end face 13 are visible. The first threaded bore 19 is arranged in relationship to the bore axis  10 with  the  distance A and, projected on the bare axis 10  of  the neighbouring support bore 9, in relationship to the  longitudinal axis  5  with  the  distance  D.  The  threaded  bore  19  has  a predetermined  diameter- The second threaded bore 20 is  arranged relative to the first threaded bore 19 in Figure  4  with  the distance  E projected onto the bore axis 10 to  the  longitudinal axis  5 and with the distance B in relationship to the bore  axis 10,  So  it is off-set to the first threaded bore 19.  The  third threaded bore 21 is  arranged with a larger distance F,  measured as  a projection  of its centre onto the bare  axis  10  of  the neighbouring  support  bore  9,  to  the  longitudinal  axis 5, compared  to  distances  D  and E. In  relationship  to  the  bore axis  10  the  third  threaded  bore  21  is  arranged  with  the distance  C.  The third threaded bore 21 has ...............<br><br>
7<br>
also compared to the further threaded bores 19, 20 the largest distance to the longitudinal axis 5. Furthermore, its diameter C is also remarkably increased in relationship to the diameter of the other bores 19, 20 (in the size range between 1 and 35%, preferably 20%). On the corresponding abutment face 16 through bores are provided in correspondence to the arrangement of the threaded bores 19, 20, 21, which are adapted to the diameter of the screw to be inserted into the threaded bores 19, 20, 21, e.g. headed screws 22, 23, 24 according to Figure 5. In Figure 3. only the corresponding through bore 25 through the bridge element 15 in reference to the third threaded bore 21 in the bridge element 15 is visible. The headed screws 22, 23, 24 are inserted through the corresponding bores in the bridge element 15 into the threaded bores 19 or 20 or 21, respectively, wherein the headed screw 24 belongs to the through bore 25 in the bridge element 15 and to the largest threaded bore 21 in the first arm portion 11 and to its end face 13, respectively. In the represented embodiment three threaded bores are provided for each end face. However, a larger number is also possible, wherein, however, the threaded bore arranged with the largest distance to the longitudinal axis 5 should also have the largest diameter. The other threaded bores can, respectively, have the same diameters, but also differently formed diameters are possible. A compact design is especially achieved, when the third threaded bore 21 having the largest diameter, is arranged compared to the other threaded bores 19, 20 closer to the bore axis 10 or at least with the threaded bore 19, which is arranged with the smallest distance to the longitudinal axis 5, are arranged in reference to their bore axis with the same distances to the bore axis 10. As far as in connection with the threaded bores 19, 20, 21 description has been made in reference to the distance to the bore axis 10 and longitudinal axis 5, respectively, the distances of the centre or axis of these threaded bores 19, 20, 21, projected onto the bore axis 10 of the neighbouring support bore 9, in reference to the longitudinal axis 5 and their distance to the bore axis 10 are meant. The description given for the end face 13 is also valid correspondingly for all end faces of the arm portions of the two yoke arms 7, 8 of the joint yoke.<br><br>
