PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  Performed : -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a room temperature curable composition exhibiting, when cured, low permeability to gas(es).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Room temperature curable (RTC) compositions are well known for their use as sealants. In the manufacture of Insulating Glass Units (IGU), for example, panels of glass are placed parallel to each other and sealed at their periphery such that the space between the panels, or the inner space, is completely enclosed. The inner space is typically filled with a gas or mixture of gases of low thermal conductivity, e.g. argon. Current room temperature curable silicone sealant compositions, while effective to some extent, still have only a limited ability to prevent the loss of insulating gas from the inner space of an IGU. Over time, the gas will escape reducing the thermal insulation effectiveness of the IGU to the vanishing point.<br>
A need therefore exists for an RTC composition of reduced gas permeability compared to that of known RTC compositions. When employed as the sealant for an IGU, an RTC composition of reduced gas permeability will retain the intra-panel insulating gas for a longer period of time compared to that of a more permeable RTC composition and will therefore extend the insulating properties of the IGU over a longer period of time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that curable silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane combined with filler of a certain type upon curing exhibits reduced permeability to gas. The composition is especially suitable for use as a sealant where high gas barrier properties together with the desired characteristics of softness, processability and elasticity are important performance criteria.<br>
-2-<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a curable composition comprising:<br>
a)	at least one silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane;<br>
b)	at least one crosslinker for the silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane( s);<br>
c)	at least one catalyst for the crosslinking reaction;<br>
d)	at" least one organic nanoclay; and, optionally,<br>
e)	at least one solid polymer having a permeability to gas that is less than the permeability of the crosslmked diorganopolysiloxane(s).<br>
When used as a gas barrier, e.g., in the manufacture of an IGU; the foregoing composition reduces the loss of gas(es) thus providing a longer service life of the article in which it is employed.<br>

The curable composition of the present invention includes at least one organic nanoclay filler (d). Nanoclays possess a unique morphology with one dimension being in the nanometer range. The nanoclays can form chemical complexes with an intercalant that ionically bonds to surfaces in between the layers making up the clay particles. This association of inter cal ant and clay particles results in a material which is compatible with many different kinds of host resins permitting the clay filler to disperse therein.<br>
The term "exfoliation" as used herein describes a process wherein packets of nanoclay   platelets   separate   from   one   another   in   a   polymer-matrix.   During<br>
-5-<br><br>
exfoliation, platelets at the outermost region of each packet cleave off, exposing more platelets for separation.<br>
The term "gallery" as used herein describes the space between parallel layers of clay platelets. The gallery spacing changes depending on the nature of the molecule or polymer occupying the space. An interlayer space between individual nanoclay platelets varies, again depending on the type of molecules that occupy the space.<br>
The term "intercalant" as used herein includes any inorganic or organic compound that is capable of entering the clay gallery and bonding to its surface.<br>
The term "intercalate" as used herein designates a clay-chemical complex wherein the clay gallery spacing has increased due to the process of surface modification. Under the proper conditions of temperature and shear, an intercalate is capable of exfoliating in a resin matrix.<br>

The expression "modified clay" as used herein designates a clay material that has been treated with any inorganic or organic compound that is capable of undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the clay.<br>
The term "nanoclay" as used herein describes clay materials that possess a unique morphology with one dimension being in the nanometer range. Nanoclays can form chemical complexes with an intercalant that ionic ally bonds to surfaces in between the layers making up the clay particles. This association of intercalant and clay<br>
-6-<br><br>
particles results in a material which is compatible with many different kinds of host resins permitting the clay filler to disperse therein.<br>
The expression "organic nanoclay" as use herein describes a nanoclay that has been treated or modified with an organic intercalant.<br>
The term "organoclay" as used herein designates a clay or other layered material that has been treated with organic molecules (variously referred to as "exfoliating agents/' "surface modifiers" or "intercalants") that are capable of undergoing ion exchange reactions with "the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the clay.<br>

Example 4: 45 grams mix (Silanol.5000 and Silanol 50000 @ 50:50) + 5 grams of SF ME100 clay<br>
The above-indicated blends were then used to make cured sheets as follows: PDMS-nanoclay formulations were mixed with n-propyl silicate ("NPS)" acrosslinker) and solubilized dibutyl tin oxide ("DBTO" a cross linking catalyst), as listed in Table 2) using a hand blender for 5 -7 minutes with air bubbles being removed by vacuum. Each blend was poured into a Teflon sheet-forming mold and maintained for 24 hours under ambient conditions (25°C and 50% humidity) to partially cure the PDMS components. The partially cured sheets were removed from the mold after 24 hours and maintained at ambient temperature for seven days for complete curing.<br>

COMP ARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 AND EXAMPLES 5-9<br>
To provide a 1 weight percent C-15A clay (see Example 5, Table 3): 227.7 g of OMCTS (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) and 2.3 g of C-15A were introduced into a three-neck round bottom flask fitted with overhead stirrer and condenser. The mixture was stirred at 250 rpm for 6 hours at ambient temperature. The temperature was increased to 175 C° while stirring was continued. 0.3 g of CsOH in 1ml of water was added to the reaction vessel through a septum. After 15 minutes, polymerization of OMCTS began and 0.5 ml of water was then added with an additional 0.5 ml of water being added after 5 minutes. Heating and stirring were continued for 1 hour after which 0.1 ml of phosphoric acid was added for neutralization. The pH of the reaction mixture was1 determined after 30 minutes. Stirring and heating were continued for another 30 minutes and the pH of the reaction mixture was again determined to assure complete neutralization. Distillation of cyclics was carried out at 175 C° and the mixture was thereafter cooled to room temperature.<br>
The same procedure was followed with 2.5, 5 and 10 wt% of C-15A (see Examples 6-8, Table 3).<br>
Similar in-situ polymerization procedures were followed with 10 wt% high1 aspect ratio clay (SF ME 100) (see Example 9, Table 3). The in-situ polymer with different amounts of clay were then used to make cured sheets as follows: In-situ PDMS-nanoclay formulations were mixed with NPS crosslinker and solubilized DBTO catalyst using a hand blender for 5-7 min with air bubbles being removed by vacuum. The mixture was then poured into a Teflon sheet-forming mold and maintained for 24 hours under ambient conditions (25°C and 50% humidity). The partially cured sheets were removed from the mold after 24 hours and maintained at ambient temperature for seven days for complete curing.<br>

Argon permeability was measured using a gas permeability set-up as in the previous examples. The measurements were based on the variable-volume method at 100 psi pressure and at a temperature of 25°C. Measurements were repeated under identical1 conditions 2-3 times in order to assure their reproducibility.<br>
The permeability data are graphically presented in Figures 1 and 2. As shown in the data, argon permeability in the case of the cured sealant compositions of the invention (Examples 1-3 and 5-8 of Figure 1 and Examples 4 and 9 of Figure 2) was significantly less than that of cured sealant compositions outside the scope of the invention (Comparative Examples 1 and 2 of Figures 1 and 2). In all, while the argon permeability coefficients of the sealant compositions of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 exceed 900 barrers, those of Examples 1-9 illustrative of sealant compositions of this invention did not exceed 900 barrers and in some cases, were well below this level of argon permeability coefficient (see, in particular, examples 3, 8 and 9).<br>
While preferred embodiments of the present invention has been illustrated and described in detail, various modifications of, for example, components, materials and parameters, will become apparent to those skilled in the art, and it is intended to cover in the appended claims all such modifications and changes which come within the scope of this invention.<br>
