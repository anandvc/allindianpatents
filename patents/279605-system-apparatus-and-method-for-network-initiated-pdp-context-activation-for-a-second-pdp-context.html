				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates in general to the field of mobile communications and, more<br>
particularly, to network initiated mobility management for mobile terminals.<br>
PRIORITY CLAIM<br>
This patent application is a non-provisional application of U.S. provisional patent application<br>
60/745,685 filed on April 26, 2006 and entitled "Network Initiated Activation for Local<br>
Breakout/Initiation of a New Primary PDP Context Due to Mobility," which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
When using mobile packet switched services there is in some cases a need to use an Internet<br>
Protocol (IP) point of presence (POP) that is, in the network topology, located closer to the<br>
physical location of the user equipment. This need may arise due to several reasons.<br>
One such reason could be to avoid suboptimal routing that would occur if the user equipment<br>
(UE) (also referred to as a mobile terminal) keeps its IP point of presence and uses the same<br>
IP address to communicate, while it moves far away from the IP point of presence. This may<br>
cause inefficiencies depending on what kind of services the UE is using. The inefficiencies<br>
could arise in the form of too long delays, too low throughput (e.g., due to the long delay<br>
when Transport Control Protocol (TCP) is used as the transport protocol). Additionally, the<br>
suboptimal routing can cause unnecessary transmission costs for the operator.<br>
Another reason for the need of a local IP point of presence is to use localized content, where<br>
the localization could be based on the IP address. Another example of this is local multicast<br>
services.<br>
In addition, IP mobility solutions, namely Mobile IP (RFC 3344, IP Mobility Support for<br>
IPv4; RFC3775, Mobility Support in IPv6), may require a local IP address to work in the<br>
 <br>
mobile system. Note that Mobile IP based solutions are being discussed for the new System<br>
Architecture Evolution (SAE) system architecture (3GPP TR 23.882, System Architecture<br>
Evolution: Report on Technical Options and Conclusions), though there is no conclusion yet<br>
if they will eventually be used.<br>
In the current General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), mobile terminals can request a new IP<br>
address using the packet data protocol (PDP) context activation procedure. This procedure is<br>
initiated by the terminal, and it is typically invoked when the terminal expects to use packet<br>
switched services. There is no mechanism in GPRS where terminal mobility would trigger the<br>
activation of a new PDP context. Also, there is no easily deployable mechanism for a<br>
network-initiated IP address allocation. In other words, there is no network-initiated PDP<br>
context activation procedure. For these reasons, current GPRS technology does not provide<br>
the means' to satisfy the need for a local IP point of presence.<br>
Note that one exception exists: when the mobile terminal roams to a new network, it may<br>
perform a new attach and subsequently a new PDP context activation procedure which can<br>
allocate a local IP point of presence (i.e., local IP address) in the visited network. This<br>
typically occurs when the mobile terminal moves to a new network operator. But according to<br>
the discussion above, there is also a need to allocate a local IP point of presence, which is<br>
initiated by the network, even when the mobile terminal remains in the same network. This<br>
need is especially high in networks that span over a large geographical area, e.g. USA or<br>
China.<br>
Although Mobile Internet Protocol version 6 (MIPv6) route optimization could be used to<br>
solve the routing optimization problems, it has a number of disadvantages. First, the policy<br>
enforcement point is changed in an ongoing flow which may compromise charging and policy<br>
control enforcement. Second, policy and charging enforcement becomes more complicated<br>
because the network has to process more headers, i.e. those associated with Mobile IP. Third,<br>
moving the enforcement point could also require that the Policy Control and Charging Rules<br>
Function (PCRF) node is moved which introduces a lot of complexity, namely the transfer of<br>
context from the old to the new PCRF, and selection of the current PCRF becomes difficult.<br>
 <br>
Also note that MIPv6 would require that the terminal implements the corresponding MIPv6<br>
protocol mechanisms which are assumed to be complex. Additionally, the correspondent<br>
nodes are also required to support MIPv6 route optimization. That means that the MIPv6<br>
approach works only for IPv6 compatible networks.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides a system, apparatus and method wherein the network initiates<br>
a PDP context activation for a second PDP context using a new IP address that can be used<br>
for new transport sessions whenever one or more operator configured criteria apply. For<br>
example, the present invention can be used to: (1) route ongoing and new communication<br>
sessions from the old network device associated with the old IP address through a new<br>
network device associated with the new IP address using the old IP address; (2) route ongoing<br>
communication sessions from the old network device through the new network device using<br>
the old IP address, and new communication sessions directly through the new network device;<br>
or (3) route ongoing communication sessions from the old network device through the new<br>
network device without using the new IP address, and new communication sessions directly<br>
through the new network device. Alternatively, the UE can initiate the second Primary PDP<br>
context set up based on (specific) location information received in the broadcast information<br>
received from the base stations or initiated from a PDN GW/Serv. GW.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention allows the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)<br>
core network to take control over the Gateway GPRS Support Node/Packet Data Network<br>
Gateway (GGSN/PDN GW) handover process to provide smooth handovers in the network<br>
for local breakout. By using network initiated PDP context activation for the second PDP<br>
context with a new IP address, small impact is foreseen in the User Equipment (UE) or mobile<br>
terminal, and no tunneling support is needed in the UE. The impact on the Policy Control and<br>
Charging (PCC) architecture is also minimal. Moreover, there will not be any impact on<br>
procedures when local breakout is not supported. This new PDP context with a new IP<br>
address can then be used for local breakout of IP-traffic. Alternatively, this PDP context can<br>
also be used for IP-based mobility protocols such as Mobile IP (with or without route<br>
optimization), MIPv4, MIPv6, or Roam-IP.<br>
 <br>
A first embodiment of the present invention provides a method for creating a second network<br>
address for a mobile terminal having a first network address within a communications<br>
network. The second network address for the mobile terminal is created whenever one or<br>
more network operator criteria are satisfied. Thereafter, the second network address is<br>
provided to the mobile terminal and one or more network devices such that the second<br>
network address is used for one or more new communication sessions with the mobile<br>
terminal.<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention provides a method for creating a second<br>
network address for a mobile terminal having a first network address within a<br>
communications network. The network determines whether one or more network operator<br>
criteria associated with a mobile terminal have been satisfied. If the network operator criteria<br>
have been satisfied, the second network address for the mobile terminal is created, one or<br>
more use-based parameters are defined for the first and second network addresses, the second<br>
network address is registered with a network database, the second network address is<br>
provided to the mobile terminal and one or more applicable network devices and<br>
correspondent nodes, and the first and second network addresses are used and removed in<br>
accordance with the defined use-based parameters.<br>
A third embodiment of the present invention provides a network node for creating a second<br>
network address for a mobile terminal having a first network address within a<br>
communications network. The network node includes a communications interface<br>
communicably coupled to the mobile terminal and one or more network devices and a<br>
processor communicably coupled to the communications interface. The processor is<br>
configured to create the second network address for the mobile terminal whenever one or<br>
more network operator criteria are satisfied and provide the second network address to the<br>
mobile terminal and one or more network devices via the communications interface such that<br>
the second network address is used for one or more new communication sessions with the<br>
mobile terminal.<br>
 <br>
A fourth embodiment of the present invention provides a system having a communications<br>
network and a mobile termination. The communications network has at least one network<br>
node and one or more network devices. The mobile terminal is communicably coupled to the<br>
network node and has a first network address. The network node has a processor configured<br>
to create a second network address for the mobile terminal whenever one or more network<br>
operator criteria are satisfied and provide the second network address to the mobile terminal<br>
and at least one of the network devices such that the second network address is used for one<br>
or more new communication sessions with the mobile terminal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in<br>
detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable<br>
inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific<br>
embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the<br>
invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
To facilitate the understanding of this invention, a number of terms are defined below. Terms<br>
defined herein have meanings as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the<br>
areas relevant to the present invention. Terms such as "a", "an" and "the" are not intended to<br>
refer to only a singular entity, but include the general class of which a specific example may<br>
be used for illustration. The terminology herein is used to describe specific embodiments of<br>
the invention, but their usage does not delimit the invention, except as outlined in the claims.<br>
The present invention provides a system, apparatus and method wherein the network initiates<br>
a PDP context activation for a second PDP context using a new IP address that can be used<br>
for new transport sessions whenever one or more operator configured criteria apply. For<br>
example, the present invention can be used to: (1) route ongoing and new communication<br>
sessions from the old network device associated with the old IP address through a new<br>
network device associated with the new IP address using the old IP address; (2) route ongoing<br>
communication sessions from the old network device through the new network device using<br>
the old IP address, and new communication sessions directly through the new network device;<br>
or (3) route ongoing communication sessions from the old network device through the new<br>
network device without using the new IP address, and new communication sessions directly<br>
through the new network device. Alternatively, the UE can initiate the second Primary PDP<br>
context set up based on (specific) location information received in the broadcast information<br>
received from the base stations or initiated from a PDN GW/Serv. GW.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention allows the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)<br>
core network to take control over the Gateway GPRS Support Node/Packet Data Network<br>
Gateway (GGSN/PDN GW) handover process to provide smooth handovers in the network<br>
 <br>
for local breakout. By using network initiated PDP context activation for the second PDP<br>
context with a new IP address, small impact is foreseen in the User Equipment (UE) or mobile<br>
terminal, and no tunneling support is needed in the UE. The impact on the Policy Control and<br>
Charging (PCC) architecture is also minimal. Moreover, there will not be any impact on<br>
procedures when local breakout is not supported.<br>
This new PDP context with a new IP address can then be used for local breakout of IP-traffic.<br>
Alternatively, this PDP context can also be used for IP-based mobility protocols such as<br>
Mobile IP (with or without route optimization, MIPv4 (see RFC 3344, IP Mobility Support<br>
for IPv4) or MIPv6 (see RFC3775, Mobility Support in IPv6) or Roam-IP (see Z. R. Turanyi,<br>
Cs. Szabo, E. Kail, A. G. Valko, "Global Internet Roaming with ROAMIP," ACM Mobile<br>
Computing and Communications Review (MCCR), Vol. 4, No. 3, p. 58-68., July 2001; Zoltan<br>
Turanyi, Andras G. Valko "Roaming agent for internetwork handover", invention disclosure,<br>
ETH/RL-99:1441; Zoltan Turanyi, Andras G. Valko "Mobility Management for Mobile<br>
terminals", U.S. Patent No. 6,990,339 B2, January 24, 2006). Roam-IP is a global mobility<br>
architecture that uses application layer solutions for global reachability and reuses transparent<br>
tunneling mechanisms to ensure session continuity. The present invention and Roam-IP on<br>
application layer solutions for reachability. As discussed in the references cited above, most<br>
applications have their own registration mechanisms which eliminate the need to provide<br>
reachability at a permanent IP address (which is a feature of Mobile IP). While Roam-IP<br>
provides solutions for how to maintain session continuity even when the user hands over from<br>
one network to another, it does not consider how a local IP point of presence can be provided<br>
in a mobile network spanning a large coverage area. Hence, the present invention can be<br>
regarded as being complementary to Roam-IP such that a network operator may use both the<br>
present invention and Roam-IP, or any one of them.<br>
Now referring to FIGURE 1, a flow chart illustrating a method 100 for creating a second<br>
network address for a mobile terminal having a first network address within a<br>
communications network in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention is<br>
shown. The second network address for the mobile terminal is created whenever one or more<br>
network operator criteria are satisfied in block 102. The first and second network addresses<br>
can be an Internet Protocol (IP) point of presence, identifier or combination of data that can be<br>
 <br>
used to properly route traffic to the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal, also referred to as<br>
user equipment (UE), can be a phone, personal data assistant (PDA), computer or other<br>
mobile communications device. The one or more network operator criteria may include a<br>
movement of the mobile terminal within a home public land mobile network (PLMN) or to a<br>
new visited PLMN, a traffic type associated with the first network address, a traffic quality<br>
associated with the first network address, a traffic quantity associated with the first network<br>
address, a determination that the first network address is not local enough for the one or more<br>
new communication sessions or a combination thereof. The second network address can be<br>
created by initiating a packet data protocol (PDP) context activation by a network node or the<br>
mobile terminal. The mobile station initiates the PDP context activation after receiving a<br>
specific location information in a broadcast from a base station or initiated from a PDN<br>
GW/Serv. GW. In other words, the network instructs the mobile terminal to initiate the PDP<br>
context activation. Thereafter, the second network address is provided to the mobile terminal<br>
and one or more network devices such that the second network address is used for one or<br>
more new communication sessions with the mobile terminal in block 104. The one or more<br>
network devices may include a database, a correspondent node, a Gateway General Packet<br>
Radio Service Support Node (GGSN) or a PDN GW/Serv. GW.<br>
The use of the second network address and continued use of the first network address can<br>
fixed or dynamically determined by the network operator. In other words, the network<br>
operator is free to configure the present invention to determine how and when both ongoing<br>
and new communication sessions should be routed to the mobile terminal via the first network<br>
address, the second network address or a combination thereof. For example, the first network<br>
address can be mandatory for one or more ongoing communication sessions, optional for the<br>
one or more ongoing communication sessions, or used only for one or more specific<br>
applications. Similarly, the second network address can be mandatory for the one or more<br>
new communication sessions, optional for the one or more new communication sessions, or<br>
used only for one or more specific applications. The second network address can also be used<br>
for tunneling traffic from the first network address, a network node (e.g., a Gateway General<br>
Packet Radio Service Support Node (GGSN) or a Packet Data Network Gateway/Serving<br>
Gateway (PDN GW/Serv. GW)), or an anchor point to the second network address. Typically,<br>
the first network address will be removed after a specified period of time, a traffic threshold is<br>
 <br>
reached or a combination thereof. Likewise, the second network address will be typically<br>
maintained as long as the mobile terminal is connected to the communications network, until<br>
the mobile terminal moves to a new communications network or until a specified period of<br>
time has elapsed. As previously discussed, the second network address can be used for a local<br>
breakout of Internet Protocol (IP) traffic or with one or more IP-based mobility protocols<br>
(e.g., Mobile IP with route optimization, Mobile IP without route optimization, MIPv4,<br>
MIPv6, Roam IP or a combination thereof).<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 2, a flow chart illustrating a method 200 for creating a second<br>
network address for a mobile terminal having a first network address within a<br>
communications network in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention is<br>
shown. The network determines whether one or more network operator criteria associated<br>
with the mobile terminal have been satisfied in block 202. If the one or more criteria have not<br>
been satisfied, as determined in decision block 204, the network continues to monitor the<br>
mobile terminal in block 202. If the one or more operator criteria associated with the mobile<br>
terminal have been satisfied, as determined in decision block 204, the second network address<br>
is created for the mobile terminal in block 206 and one or more use-based parameters are<br>
defined for the first and second network addresses in block 208.<br>
The use-based parameters define how and when the first and second network addresses with<br>
be used with ongoing and new communication sessions, and when they will be removed. The<br>
application of the use-based parameters can be fixed or dynamically determined by the<br>
network operator. For example, the first network address can be mandatory for one or more<br>
ongoing communication sessions, optional for the one or more ongoing communication<br>
sessions, or used only for one or more specific applications. Similarly, the second network<br>
address can be mandatory for the one or more new communication sessions, optional for the<br>
one or more new communication sessions, or used only for one or more specific applications.<br>
The second network address can also be used for tunneling traffic from the first network<br>
address, a network node, or an anchor point to the second network address. Typically, the first<br>
network address will be removed after a specified period of time, a traffic threshold is reached<br>
or a combination thereof. Likewise, the second network address will be typically maintained<br>
as long as the mobile terminal is connected to the communications network, until the mobile<br>
 <br>
terminal moves to a new communications network or until a specified period of time has<br>
elapsed. The second network address is registered with a network database in block 210 and<br>
provided to the mobile terminal and one or more applicable network devices and<br>
correspondent nodes in block 212. Thereafter, the first and second network addresses are<br>
used and removed in accordance with the defined use-based parameters in block 214.<br>
The third and fourth embodiments of the present invention will now be described in reference<br>
to the examples shown in FIGURES 3A, 3B and 3C. The present invention provides support<br>
in the 3GPP core network for local breakout solutions by initiating a PDP context activation<br>
procedure for a local IP point of presence. Basically the same mechanisms can be used both<br>
within a home PLMN and in the roaming case when the user moves to a new visited PLMN.<br>
Currently a tunneling mechanism is in place which tunnels traffic to and from the existing IP<br>
point of presence where the existing IP address is allocated. In many cases, the trigger for the<br>
activation of the new PDP context is the mobility of the user, which may be both mobility<br>
within the same PLMN, or roaming to a new PLMN<br>
The selection of "home PDN GW" (or GGSN, since this can be applied on 2G and 3G GPRS<br>
also) is decided by the local Serving GPRS Support node (SGSN)/MME and the domain<br>
name service (DNS) configuration for access point names (APN). Note that the new SAE<br>
system may use new mechanisms for the selection of a PDN GW/Serv. GW node in the<br>
MME, other than the current DNS lookup mechanism. The APN name needs to be available<br>
at the new SGSN (either retrieved from the SGSN context response (for legacy it is hidden in<br>
the PDP context, for new messages this info must be available), or alternatively from the UE)<br>
in order to support the present invention with handovers between operators (handovers<br>
between operators are rarely or maybe never used today). If the APN name is available, then<br>
the local GGSN/PDN GW or SGSN/MME can decide whether new PDP contexts shall be<br>
allocated locally or traffic shall be tunneled to the old GGSN/PDN GW. It is not required to<br>
support this between PLMNs but by using the same tunneling solution between PLMNs and<br>
within PLMNs it is possible to support that scenario also.<br>
The network initiates a PDP context activation of another PDP context with a new IP address<br>
(using the standard network requested PDP context activation procedure, in 3GPP 23,0606, or<br>
 <br>
an evolution thereof), when the old GGSN or PDN GW is not considered to be local enough<br>
for the traffic. This is defined by operator configured criteria. The MME/SGSN may or may<br>
not change as a result of the change in the PDN GW/Serv. GW /GGSN. The new PDP<br>
context may be used for new transport sessions, i.e. all new connections to different<br>
applications, p-2-c or p-2-p based. The new IP address may also be used for tunneling of<br>
traffic from another node, such as the previous GGSN or PDN GW/Serv. GW, or from any<br>
anchor point. For the latter, the tunneling protocol/solution may be Mobile IPv4, Mobile IPv6<br>
or any other mobility protocol using the new IP address as tunnel end-point.<br>
The system includes a communications network 300 and a mobile terminal 302. The<br>
communications network 300 has at least one region (e.g., Region A and Region B), at least<br>
one network node (e.g., PDN GW/Serv. GW home address.304, PDN GW/Serv. GW foreign<br>
address 306 or other network node) and one or more network devices (not shown). The<br>
mobile terminal 302 is communicably coupled to the network node 304 and has a first<br>
network address 308. The applicable network node has a processor configured to create a<br>
second network address 310 for the mobile terminal 300 whenever one or more network<br>
operator criteria are satisfied and provide the second network address 310 to the mobile<br>
terminal 302 and at least one of the network devices (e.g., PDN GW/Serv. GW home address<br>
304, correspondent node 312 or other device) such that the second network address 310 is<br>
used for one or more new communication sessions with the mobile terminal 302. The<br>
network node also includes a communications interface communicably coupled to the mobile<br>
terminal 302 and one or more network devices.<br>
Now referring to FIGURE 3A, a tunneling protocol/solution for Mobile IPv4 using the<br>
present invention is shown. The ongoing communication session (path 314) prior to initiation<br>
of the second network address 310 is between the mobile terminal 302, the home PDN<br>
GW/Serv. GW 304 and the correspondent node 312. After creation of the second network<br>
address 310, the ongoing communication session and any new communication sessions (path<br>
316) are routed from the home PDN GW/Serv. GW 304 and through the foreign PDN<br>
GW/Serv. GW 306 (care-of address) using the second network address 310. Triangular<br>
routing 318 is possible with MIPv4, but it optimizes the uplink only and makes firewall<br>
configuration and policy enforcement very difficult.<br>
 <br>
Referring to FIGURE 3B, a tunneling protocol/solution for Mobile IPv6 using the present<br>
invention is shown. The ongoing communication session (path 314) prior to initiation of the<br>
second network address 310 is between the mobile terminal 302, the home PDN GW/Serv.<br>
GW 304 and the correspondent node 312. After creation of the second network address 310,<br>
the ongoing communication session is routed from the home PDN GW/Serv. GW 304 and<br>
through the foreign PDN GW/Serv. GW 306 (care-of address) using the second network<br>
address 310 (path 316), and any new communication sessions (path 320) are optimally routed<br>
by MIPv6 directly through the foreign PDN GW/Serv. GW 306 (care-of address) using the<br>
second network address 310.<br>
Now referring to FIGURE 3C, a protocol/solution without tunneling using the present<br>
invention is shown. The ongoing communication session (path 314) prior to initiation of the<br>
second network address 310 is between the mobile terminal 302, the home PDN GW/Serv.<br>
GW 304 and the correspondent node 312. After creation of the second network address 310,<br>
the ongoing communication session is routed from the home PDN GW/Serv. GW 304 through<br>
the foreign PDN GW/Serv. GW 306 (care-of address) without using the second network<br>
address 310 (path 322), and any new communication sessions (path 324) are routed directly<br>
through the foreign PDN GW/Serv, GW 306 (care-of address) using the second network<br>
address 310. In this case, there is no tunneling to the new IP address 310; instead, the Gn/Gp<br>
interface between SGSN and GGSN (alternatively that the inter PDN GW/Serv. GW interface<br>
in SAE/LTE) is used for traffic to/from the old IP address 308 for already ongoing<br>
communications. For new sessions the UE 302 shall use the new IP address 310 allocated<br>
from the new GGSN or PDN GW. This can be achieved e.g., by having different routing costs<br>
or by having explicit support for this mechanism in the UE 302 TCP/IP stack. The network<br>
can then include mechanism, either timer based or traffic measurement based, that eventually<br>
removes the old IP address 308 through the GGSN initiated delete of PDP context (or evolved<br>
version thereof). The new IP address 310 in the new GGSN or PDN GW for SAE is kept as<br>
long as the UE 302 is still connected to the network, or until the UE 302 moves to the next<br>
location where a Local Breakout (LBO) is needed.<br>
 <br>
The network may provide additional information on how the new address should be used, i.e.,<br>
whether to use it for all applications or only specific ones, whether it is mandatory or optional<br>
to use it, whether Mobile IP can be used with the address (without or with route optimization)<br>
whether the other addresses will be deleted, and so on. Note that it is possible that some of<br>
the traffic is using the local IP address while the rest of the traffic is using the IP address from<br>
the original IP point of presence, e.g., in the roaming scenario it may be possible that the<br>
home operator allows only some of the traffic to be local (e.g., only emergency traffic or only<br>
internet traffic is allowed to be broken out locally).<br>
Alternatively, the UE can initiate the second Primary PDP context activation based on<br>
(specific) location information received in the broadcast information received from the base<br>
stations or initiated from a PDN GW/Serv. GW. The location information is either based on<br>
the Routing/tracking area (or similar, e.g., using some bits of the routing/tracking area<br>
identifier) but then the UE needs to know at which RA change the new primary PDP context<br>
shall be set up. The more realistic approach seems to be that an additional information is<br>
added to the broadcast message with some identity of the regions where a local GGSN/PDN<br>
GW close to the base station can be selected.<br>
The mobile terminal can take advantage of the new IP address in several ways. When an IP<br>
application starts a new transport session, it asks for a new socket connection from the<br>
operating system of the terminal. The operating system assigns an IP address for the socket<br>
connection. Thereby the operating system has control over which IP address is being used by<br>
new connections. Whenever a new, local IP address is assigned to the terminal, new<br>
connections can start using this new address.<br>
Additionally, applications can be directly informed about the existence of the new local IP<br>
address. In many applications, there is a registration process where the IP address can be<br>
registered in a server together with an application-level id. The allocation of a new IP address<br>
can trigger such a registration process, making user that the application will start using the<br>
new IP address.<br>
 <br>
Although the change of the IP address could in theory be problematic for applications in some<br>
rare cases, most applications can handle the loss of connectivity at an old IP address and<br>
automatically re-establish connectivity at a new IP address. Note that this is needed not only<br>
for local breakout, but also to handle cases when network connectivity may go up and down.<br>
Furthermore, many network operators, e.g. broadband operators do not allow users to keep the<br>
same IP address for extended periods of time (e.g., more than a day), which is another reason<br>
why applications already today need to prepare for a change of the IP address.<br>
Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be<br>
understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Moreover, the<br>
scope of the present application is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments of<br>
the process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, means, methods and steps<br>
