Field of the Invention<br>
A  process   for  making<br>
Puis invention relates to/rubber compositions having improved physical properties.<br>
More panicularly, it relates to sulfur-vulcanized rubber compositions which are vulcanized in the presence of panicular coagents with anti-reversion and/or accelerating activity. The invention also relates to a sulfur-vulcanization process which is carried out in the presence of particular coagents with anti-reversion and/or accelerating activity and the use of such coagents in the sulfur-vulcanization of rubber. Finally, the invention relates to rubber products comprising rubber vuicanized with sulfur in the presence of such coagents.<br>
Background of the Art<br>
In the tire and belt industries, among others, bener mechanical and heat resistance propenies are being demanded. It has long been known that the mechamcal properties of rubber can be improved by using a large amount of sulfur as a cross-linking agent to increase the cross-link densiry in vulcanized rubbers. However, the use of large amounts of sulfur suffers from the disadvantage that it produces reversion and leads to a marked decrease in heat resistance and resistance to rlex cracking, among other properties, in "die rlnai product. The fact that reversion is a contmuing problem can be seen from, "Rubber Microstructure and Reversion", Nordsiek, Dr. K.H., Rubber World. 197 (3), pp. 30-38. 1987, and "Physikalische und Chemische Aspekte der Reversion". Kautschuk — Gummi-Kurstoffe. 34, No. 9, 1981.<br>
In order to eliminate the foregoing disadvantage, it has been proposed to add coagents to sulfur-vulcanization systems. One known ry-pe of coagent are the maleimides. Such vulcanization systems are disclosed in, "Vulcanization With Maleimides", Journal of Applied Polvmer Science. Vol. 8, pp. 2281-2298 (1964).<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,297,713 suggests the use of dithio-bis(N-phenylmaleimides) as vulcanizing agents for rubber. However, this system does not employ sulfur as a vulcanization agent and thus suffers from several disadvantages which result from the absence of sulfur cross-links in the rubber product.<br>
Japanese patent publication JP 1014-238 discloses sulfur-vuicanization systems wherein maleimides are used as coagents and which also contain either dibenzothiazyl disulfide or tetramethylthiuram disulfide. However, this solution is of limited application<br>
nee only vulcanization accelerators having relatively short scorch times can be used with<br>
le bis-maleimides.<br>
European patent application (EP-A-) 0191931 suggests that the use of a bismaleimide ompound in combination with a sulfenamide and a dithiophosphoric acid leads to further .improvements in the mechanical and anti-reversion propenies of sulfur-vulcarazed rubbers, .""he patent specification claims that these ribbers exhibit improved resistance to reversion, esistance to heat aging and resistance to fle.x cracking. However, tbJs system is limited to ilcanization carried out in the presence of a sulfenamide accelerator in combination with i dithiophosphoric acid accelerator and is thus of limited utility in acaial practice.<br>
In the anicle, "Change in the Strucmre and Properties of Vulcanizates Based on Namral Rubber Under Prolonged Vulcanization in the Presence of Vulcanizing Systems Containing Sulfur and Bismaleimides". Chavchich, T.A.. et al., Kauchxik i Rezina. vol. 4, pp. 20-3. 1981, there is disclosed that vulcanization of namral rubber tread stocks with sulfur in the presence of m-phenylene-bismaleimide at 143 °C over a 600-minute period gave vulcanizates with enhanced physiomechanical properties and resistance to reversion.<br>
Other articles relating to the sulfur-vulcanization of rubbers using bismaleimides as coagents include, "Vulcanization of cis-l,4-isoprene rubber by derivatives of maleimide under the action of high temperatures and radiation," Kauchuk i Rezina. vol. 3, pp. 10-12, 1974; "High-temperature Vulcanization of Unsaturated Rubbers by-Ihio Derivatives of Makdmide", Kaucimk i Reziia. vol, 3, pp. 16-19, 1975; aod., "Influence of the Type and Concemraiion of Crosslinkix^ Agent on the Ef^cGveress of a Combined System of<br><br>
Bismaleimide and Sulfur", Kauchuk i Rezina. No. 10, pp. 15-19. 1985.<br>
Even more recently, Japanese patent applications JP 3286-445 and JP 3312-333 disclosed the vulcanization of rubber with sulfur and an aliphatic bismaleimide or N,N'-toluene-bismaleimide. These particular bismaleimides are said to improve the heat resistance and adhesion properties of the rubbers.<br>
Further, EP-A-0345825 and 0410152 also relate to the use of bismaleimides as coagents   in   sulfur-vulcaruzation   of  rubber.   These   two   disclosures   are   directed   to   vulcanization systems which contain a second coagent, presumably to improve upon the bis¬maleimide system.<br>
Despite the fact that some of the above patents claim to reduce reversion by addition of a bismaleimide. in actual practice the reduction in reversion achieved with the bismaleimides is insufficient. Accordingly, although the reversion and the heat resistance are slightly improved, the problem remains that there is no generally applicable anti-reversion agent which may be used in com.bination with a number of different rubber accelerators during the vulcanization process and which satisfactory' solves the reversion problem while at the same time sigmficantly improving the heat resistance of sulfur-vulcanized rubbers without having an adverse affect on other rubber propenies.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a solution to the above problems by the use of a nove! class of coagents with anti-reversion and/or accelerating activity in the suifar-vulcanization of rubbers. More particularly, in a first aspect, the present invention relates tc a sulfiar-vulcanized rubber composition which comprises the vulcanization reaction product of:<br>
(A)	100 parts by weight of at least one natural or synthetic rubber;<br>
(B)	0.1 to 25 parts by weight of sulfur and/or a sufficient amount of a sulfur donor to provide the equivalent of 0.1 to 25 parts by weight of sulfur; and<br>
(C)	0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a coagent of the following fonnula I:<br><br><br>
wherein R, and R2 represent each independently a suitable leaving group; R3 and R4 are independently selected from hydrogen, OH, CH2OH, CH2XI, CH2Br, CH2NH,, CH.CN, CH2R, CH2OR, SO2R, CHCU, CCI3, CHBro, CBr3 CH.F and CF3, wherein R is hydrogen. ' C1-10 alkyl, C6-18 aryl, C7-20 alkaryl or C7-20 araikyl, the aryl groups being optionally substiuited; R5 and R6 are independently selected from the same substituents as for R, and may also be hydrogen or halogen; B1 B2, B3. and B4 are independently selected from oxygen and sulfur; n is an integer from 1 to 10; and D is a polyvalent radical. Prefcrahiy, n is i.<br>
*<br>
In another aspect, the present mvention relates to a vulcanization process carried out in the presence of a coagent of the formula I as defined above. In a further aspect, the invention relates to the use of such a coagent in the sulfur-vulcanization of rubbers. The invention also encompasses rubber products which comprise at least some rubber which has been vulcanized with sulfur in the presence of a coagent of the formula I as defined above.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The present invention provides an excellent anti-reversion effect as well as improvements in several rubber properties without having a significant adverse effect on the remaining properties of the rubber, when compared with similar sulfur-vulcanization systems using other coagents.<br>
The present invention is applicable to ail natural and synthetic rubbers.Examples of such rubber include, but are not limited to, natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, •bantadine rubber,  isoprene rubber, acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber,  chloroprene rubber.<br><br>
isopreneisobutylene rubber, brominated isoprene-isobutylene rubber, chlonnatea isoprene-isobutylene rubber, ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymers, as well as combinations of two or more of these rubbers arid combinations of one or more of these rubbers with other rubbers and/or thermoplastics.<br>
Examples of sulfur which may be used in the present invention include various types of sulfur such as powdered sulfur, precipitated sulfur and insoluble sulfur. Also, sulfur donors may be used in place of, or in addition to sulfur in order to provide the required level of sulfur during the vulcanization process. Examples of such sulfur donors include, but are not limited to, tetramethylthiuram disulfide, tetraethylthiuram disulfide, tetrabutylthiuram disulfide, dipentamethylene thiuram hexasulfide, dipentamethylene thiuram tetrasulfide, didiiodimorpholine, caprolactamdisulfide, and mixture thereof.<br>
In this text, references to sulfur shall include sulfur donors and mixmres of sulfur  and sulfur donors. Further. references to the quantity of sulfur employed in the vulcanization. when applied lo sulfur donors refer to the quantity of sulfur donor which is required to provide the equivalent amount of sulfur that is specified. The anti-reversion coagents of the present invention are characterized by the fact that they must be capable oT fonning cross-links bonded to the rubber by a carbon-carbon linkage. This type of crosslink is known in the rubber literamre from, for example "High-temperature vulcanization of unsaturated rubbers by thio derivatives of maleimide", Krashennikov et al., Kauchuk i Rezina. No. 3, pp. 16-20, 1975. Such cross-links bonded to the rubber by a carbon-carbon linkage are highly desirable in rubbers, and panicularly sulfur-vulcanized rubbers since such cross-links are thermally stable.<br>
Accordingly, we have found that it is desirable, in sulfur vulcanization, to produce cross¬links bonded to the rubber by carbon-carbon linkages. For the purposes of this parent application, these cross-links will be hereinafter referred to as, "carbon-carbon" cross-links. In order to make a thermally stable rubber composition which still possesses the advantageous properties of sulfur-vulcanization, however, it remains necessary-to combine the formation of carbon-carbon linkages with the formation of the stable monosulfidic cross¬links which result from sulfur-vulcanization.<br><br>
While it is possible to obtain a significant number of carbon-carbon cross-links by sulfur-vilcanizing rubber in the presence of bismaleimides, we have found that such rubbers still suffer from significant reversion (reduction in the cross-link density) upon thermal loading of the rubber after \ailcanization. This leads to a corresponding worsening of some of the important properties of such rubber compositions during their use in, for example, tires.<br>
Succinimido coagents of the present invention include, but are not limited to compounds represented by the general formula I which is defined above.<br>
Suitable leaving groups for the purpose of the present invention are groups or atoms which become cleaved from the substrate molecule of formula I at appropriate reaction rate and include, for e.xample, CI, Br. S,, OSO.R, S^R. OR, OOR. OCOR. OSOR (R being, for example, hydrogen, C1-10 alkyl, C6-8 aryl.

See, for example, "Advanced Organic Chemistry" by J. March, 4th ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons'(e.g  pp. 205, 1005 and 1008), herein incorporated by reference. Preferred leaving groups for the purpose of the present invention are chlorine and bromine.<br><br>

Of these, the following compounds are panicularly preferred: BCSI-MX. BBSI-MX. BDBSI-MX, BMBTS-MX, BBDTCS-MX. BBDTCS-B, BDTCBS-B, and BBMS-MX.<br>
The substituted succinimide compounds of formula I may be prepared in a manner known per se. for example by reacting a substituted succinic acid and a diciiiiino compound, e.g. m-xyiylenediamine. The latter compound is known in the an. see e.g. Chemical Abstracts 107:134698V (1986) and U.S. Patent No. 4,482.741. Altemativeiy. the compounds of formula I may be piepared starting from the corresponding maieimido compounds, for example by introducing the desired substituent(s) through an addition reaction.<br>
The bis-3-halogen succinimides of the present invention can be suitably made by feeding HX, wherein X is a halogen atom, through a solution of the corresponding bismaleimide in dichloromethane. Thus, a convenient way to make bis-3-chlorosuccinmido-m-xylylene, is to feed hydrogen chloride through a solution of ra-xylylene bismaleimide in ulculoromcthane. A more preferred route is to add hydrogen chloride to (m-xylylene)bis maleamic acid in a suitable solvent, e.g. acetic acid, at elevated temperature till the addition is completed. The bis-3,4-dihalogensuccinimides of the present invention can be made, for example, by adding X, wherein X is a halogen atom, to a solution of the corresponding bismaleimide in dichloromethane at room temperature.<br>
The amount of sulfur to be compounded with the rubber is, based on 100 parts of rubber, usually 0.1 to 25 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.2 to 8 parts by weight. The amount of sulfur donor to be compounded withthe-rubber is an amount sufficient to provide an equivalent amount of sulfur which is the same  as if sulfur itself were used.<br><br>
The amount of anti-reversion coagent to be compounded with the rubber is, based on 100 parts of rubber, 0.1 to 10 pans by weight, and more preferably 0.3 to 6 parts by weight. These ingredients may be employed as a pre-mix. or added simultaneously or separately, and they may be added together with other rubber compounding ingredients as well.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought that the anti-reversion activity of the coagents according to the present invention is caused by the in situ formation of maleimides, probably by a 1,2-elimination reaction of the added succinimides under the thermal conditions of the rubber vulcanization and by the presence of amines which are formed in the sulfur vulcanization. It is also thought that under sulfur-vulcanization conditions, at optimum cure, a substantial portion of the coagem remains in the rubber composition in a form in which it is still capable of reacting with the sulfur-vulcanized rubber to form additional cross-links, which cross-links are bonded to the rubber by a carbon-carbon linkage. See also WO 92/07904, which is incorporated herein by reference. If desired, the elimination reaction may be accelerated by adding an catalytic amount of a suitable base to the rubber composition.<br>
In most circumstances it is also desirable to have a \ailcanizaiion accelerator in the rubber compound. Conventional, known vulcanization accelerators may be employed. The preferred vulcanization accelerators include mercaptobenzothlazole, 2,2'-mercaptobenzo-tinazole disulfide, sulfenamide accelerators including N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide, N-teniary-butyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide, N.N'-dicyclohexyl-2-henzothiazole sulfenamide, and 2-(morpholinothio)benzothiazole; thiophosphonc acid derivative accelerators, thiurams, dithiocarbamates, diphenyl guanidine, diorthotolyi guanidine, dithiocarbamylsulfenamides, xanthates, triazine accelerators and mixitures thereof.<br>
When the vulcanization accelerator is employed, quantities of from 0.1 to 8 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of rubber composition, are used. More preferably, the vulcanization accelerator comprises 0.3 to 4.0 parts by weight, basal on 100 parts by weight of rubber.<br><br>
Other conventional rubber additives may also be employed in their usual amounts. For example, reinforcing agents such as carbon black, silica, clay, whiting and other mineral fillers, as well as mixtures of fillers, may be included in the rubber composition. Other additives such as process oils, tackifiers, waxes, antioxidants, antiozonants. pigments, resins, plasticizers, process aids, factice, compounding agents and activators such as stearic acid and zinc oxide may be included in conventional, known amounts. For a more complete listing of rubber additives which may be used in combination with the present invention see, Hofmann, Rubber Technology Handbook. Chapter 4, Rubber Chemicals and Additives, pp. 217-353, Hanser Publishers, Munich 1989.<br>
Further, scorch retarders such as phthalic anhydride, pyromellitic anhydride, benzene hexacarbo.xylic tnanhydride, 4-methylphthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, 4-chiorophthalic atihydnde. N-cyclohexyl-thiophthaiimide, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, maleic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, itaconic anhydride and N-nitrosodiphenylamme may also be included in the mbber composition m conventional, known amounts. Finally, in specific applications it may also be desirable to include steel-cord adhesion promoters such as cobalt salts and dithiosulfates in conventional, known quantities.<br>
The present invention also relates to a vulcanization process which comprises the step<br>
)  of vulcanizing at least one namral or synthetic rubber in the presence of 0.1 to 25 pans by<br>
weight of sulfur or a sulfur donor per 100 pans by weight of rubber, characterized m that<br>
said process is carried nut in the presence of an effective amount of a coagent of formula<br>
I, as defined above.<br>
The process is carried out at a temperature of 110-220°C over a period of up to 24<br>
hours. More preferably, the process is carried out ai a tcmperature of 120-190°C over a<br>
period of up to 8 hours in the presence of 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of anti-reversion<br>
coagent. Even more preferable is the use of 0.3-6.0 pans by weight of anti-reversion<br>
coagent. All of the additives mentioned above with respect to the rubber composition may<br>
also be present during the vulcanization process of the inventionr	<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of the vulcanization process, the vulcanization is<br><br>
earned out at a temperature of 120-190"C over a period of up to 8 hours and in the .presence of 0.1 to 8.0 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of rubber, of at least one vulcanization acceleratoi.<br>
Finally, the present invention also includes articles of manufacture, such as tires and belts, which comprise sulfur-vulcanized rubber which is vulcanized in the presence of the anti-reversion coagents of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides A process for producing sulJfur vulcanized rubber composition comprising reacting:<br>
(A)     100 parts by weight of at least one natural or synthetic rubber,<br>
(R)     0.1 to 25 parts by weight of sulfur or sulfur donor in sufficient<br>

Experimental<br>
Methods used in the Examples:  compounding,  vulcanization and characterization of compounds<br>
In the following examples, rubber compounding, vulcanization and testing was carried out according to standard methods except as stated otherwise.<br>
Base compounds were mixed in a Farrel Bridge BR 1.6 liter Banbury type internal mixer (preheating at 50°C, rotor speed 77 rpm, mixing time 6 min with full cooling). Vulcanization ingredients and coagents were added to the compounds on a Schwabenthan Polymix 150L two-roll mill (friction 1:1.22, temperamre 70°C, 3 min). Sheets and test specimens were vulcanized by compression molding in a Fontyne TP-400 press.<br>
Cure characteristics were determined using a MDR 2000E (arc 0.5°): delta torque or extent of crosslinking (Roo) is the maximum torque (MH, also denoted as initial torque maximum, T) minus the minimum torque (ML). Scorch safety (t,2) is the time to 2% of delta torque above minimum torque (ML], optimum cure time (t<jo is the time to of delta torque above minimum reversion below maximum torque. final measured after overcure time.></jo><br>
Tensile measurements were carried out using a Zwick 1445 tensile tester (ISO-2 dumbbells, tensile properties according io 412-87, tear strength according to ASTM D 624-86). Hardness was determined according to DIN 53505, and ISO 48 (IRHD). Heat build-up (HBU) and compression set after dynamic loading were determined using a Goodrich Flexometer (load 11 Kg, stroke 0.445 cm, frequency 30 Hz, stan temperature 100°C, running time 25 min; ASTM D 623-78), unless stated otherwise.<br>
