				<td>The present invention relates to a process to prepare a specific trioxepane<br>
compound, an initiator composition comprising such a trioxepane compound,<br>
polymer modification processes using the trioxepane compound, and products<br>
resulting from these processes.<br>
In the process of crosslinking polymers, e.g. thermoplastic polymers such as high-<br>
density polyethylene, it is common practice to use an initiator composition, e.g. a<br>
peroxide-based initiator composition. In these processes the polymer is given the<br>
shape of the (final) shaped article and the crosslink process is performed.<br>
Trioxepane compounds are known in the art and are for example disclosed in Kirk-<br>
Othmer, The Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd Edition Volume 17,1982,<br>
p. 57. According to this disclosure, they can be prepared by reaction of a hydroxyl<br>
hydroperoxide with an aldehyde or ketone, specifically acetone, in the presence of<br>
an acid catalyst.<br>
WO 98/50354 discloses the preparation of 1,2,4-trioxepane compounds using<br>
62.58% pure hexylene glycol hydroperoxide and any one of the four ketones<br>
cyclohexanone, ethyl acetoacetate, acetone, and 2,4-pentadione. The product<br>
resulting from this reaction as described in the examples is a composition of 1,2,4-<br>
trioxepane and more than 4 wt% of the dialkyl peroxide. The dialkyl peroxide is<br>
inevitably formed during the preparation process. The resulting trioxepane<br>
composition is subsequently used as an initiator composition for crosslinking a<br>
thermoplastic polymer. In WO 98/50354 it is described that the crosslinking<br>
reaction only takes place in the presence of both the initiator composition and a co-<br>
agent. More specifically, the co-agent is triallyl cyanurate.<br><br>
However, like most of the other initiators that have been used up to now, the<br>
peroxide-based initiator composition of WO 98/50354 suffers from the problem that<br>
it starts to decompose at a temperature below the one at which the crosslinkable<br>
polymer melts or at a temperature at which the crosslinkable polymer's viscosity is<br>
insufficiently low to make easy processing possible. Because of such early<br>
decomposition of known initiator compositions, the crosslinking process cannot<br>
take place in a homogeneous composition, therefore the quality of the shaped<br>
article is not optimal. Further, the early decomposition of the initiator may result in<br>
premature crosslinking of the crosslinkable polymer during processing. If early<br>
decomposition is to be prevented, the processing of the crosslinkable polymer<br>
comprising the initiator composition cannot take place at a temperature at which<br>
the crosslinkable polymer is in a molten state or has a sufficiently low viscosity. In<br>
that case the forming of the shaped article is an energy-consuming and very<br>
inefficient process, one which often results in a shaped article with an imperfect<br>
surface, non-homogeneous mechanical and physical properties, and low durability.<br>
It is generally understood that a homogeneous distribution of the initiator in the<br>
crosslinkable polymer results in a more efficient and simpler crosslinking process<br>
and in a higher standard, more durable, and better crosslinked polymer. Hence,<br>
tumble-mixing or other forms of pre-processing of the initiator and the solid<br>
crosslinkable polymer have been suggested to achieve a homogeneous<br>
distribution of initiator in the crosslinkable polymer up to now.<br>
It will be understood that the process of crosslinking polymers and the distribution<br>
of initiator composition in the crosslinkable polymer are subject to improvement.<br>
One way to achieve an improved distribution of the initiator composition in the<br>
crosslinkable polymer and an improved process to crosslink the crosslinkable<br>
polymer would be by mixing the initiator and the crosslinkable polymer in a more<br>
readily processable state.<br><br>
There have been a few initiators up to now that do not decompose at a<br>
temperature below the melting temperature of e.g. certain types of (ultra) high-<br>
molecular weight polyethylene. One example is ethyl-O-benzoyl laurohydroximate.<br>
However, this is an initiator compound prepared using a process wherein toxic<br>
compounds are used, such as HCI gas and hydroxyl ammonium chloride. Besides,<br>
ethyl-O-benzoyl laurohydroximate is usable as an initiator for the crosslinking of<br>
crosslinkable polymers only in the presence of a co-agent such as triallyl<br>
cyanurate. The use of triallyl cyanurates in the crosslinking process is<br>
disadvantageous, as it adds another compound to the crosslinking process and,<br>
besides, it is thought that triallyl cyanurates can lower the safe processing<br>
temperature.<br>
There is therefore a need for an initiator composition and a process to crosslink a<br>
crosslinkable polymer that do not suffer from the above drawbacks. More<br>
specifically, there is a need for an initiator composition for crosslinking polymers<br>
that is stable at a temperature at which the crosslinkable polymers melt or have a<br>
low viscosity to make easy processing and homogeneous distribution of the<br>
initiator composition possible, which composition is environmentally friendly, does<br>
not require a co-agent, and can be prepared without having to use toxic materials.<br>
There is a need in the art for a process to crosslink polymers wherein the polymers<br>
and the initiator can be mixed in a molten or low viscous state, in which process<br>
the processing to a shaped article and the crosslinking can take place<br>
simultaneously, and which results in a durable and processable crosslinked<br>
polymer.<br>
According to the invention, a process is provided to prepare a trioxepane<br>
compound of the following formula (I)<br><br><br>
comprising less than 3.5 wt% of dialkyl peroxide based on the total amount of<br>
peroxides, said process comprising the steps of reacting a glycol compound of the<br>
formula R3CHOH-CH2-C(CH3)2OH with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an<br>
acid to form a glycol hydroperoxide, purifying the glycol hydroperoxide, reacting the<br>
purified glycol hydroperoxide with a ketone or aldehyde of the formula R1R2CO in<br>
the presence of an acid to form the trioxepane compound, and purifying the<br>
trioxepane compound, wherein R1, R2, and R3 are independently selected from<br>
hydrogen and a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl group, with the proviso<br>
that if R1 and R2 are both methyl groups, R3 is not hydrogen.<br>
According to the invention, an initiator composition is provided comprising a<br>
trioxepane compound of the following formula (I)<br><br>
and 0 ppm to 3.5 wt% of a dialkyl peroxide compound of the formula (II)<br>
R3CHOH-CH2-C(CH3)2-O-O-C(CH3)2-CH2-CHOHR3 (II)<br>
based on the total amount of peroxides, wherein R1, R2, and R3 are independently<br>
selected from hydrogen and a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl group, and<br>
optionally two of the group of R1, R2, and R3 are linked to form a ring structure, with<br>
the proviso that if R1 and R2 are both methyl groups, R3 is not hydrogen.<br><br>
The current invention further provides a process to prepare a crosslinked polymer<br>
wherein a reaction mixture comprising the crosslinkable polymer is brought to a<br>
temperature between 160°C and 500°C, which is suitable for starting the crosslink<br>
reaction of the crosslinkable polymer in the presence of an initiator composition<br>
comprising a 1,2,4-trioxepane of the above formula (I) and 0 to 3.5 wt% on the total<br>
amount of peroxides of a dialkyl peroxide of formula (II). Also a masterbatch<br>
comprising a crosslinkable polymer and the initiator composition is provided.<br>
The current invention moreover provides a crosslinked polymer obtainable by the<br>
process, a shaped article comprising such a crosslinked polymer, and a process to<br>
form a shaped article comprising a step wherein a crosslinkable polymer is<br>
processed to a desired shape and another step wherein the crosslinkable polymer<br>
is crosslinked. In the above process the crosslinking step preferably takes place<br>
simultaneously with or subsequent to the step of shaping the article. For<br>
thermoplastic (TPE) polymers, however, the crosslinking step preferably takes<br>
place before or simultaneously with the step of shaping the article.<br>
When a 1,2,4-trioxepane compound is prepared by the conventional process, this<br>
conventional process comprising first reacting a glycol with hydroperoxide,<br>
subsequently reacting the glycol hydroperoxide with a ketone or aldehyde, where<br>
the second step is as disclosed in both the above-mentioned Kirk-Othmer's<br>
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology and WO98/50354, and subsequently<br>
purified by conventional methods like washing steps to remove undesired<br>
hydrogen peroxide and water-soluble byproducts to acquire a technically pure<br>
product, the amount of remaining dialkyl peroxide is found to be always at least<br>
about 4 wt%.<br>
It has now been found that a trioxepane compound containing less than 3.5 wt%<br>
dialkyl peroxide can be prepared if the glycol hydroperoxide is purified between the<br>
two reaction steps. Preferably, the glycol hydroperoxide is purified such that it is<br><br>
more than 65% pure, more preferably more than 75% pure, even more preferably<br>
more than 85% pure, and most preferably more than 90% pure, based on the total<br>
amount of peroxides.<br>
The initiator composition according to the present invention is characterised by an<br>
increased safe processing temperature, while at the same time a good crosslink<br>
efficiency is maintained. The increased safe processing temperature is related to a<br>
higher decomposition temperature of the initiator composition. An increased safe<br>
processing time means a decreased premature crosslinking of the crosslinkabie<br>
polymer. As the crosslinkabie polymer-containing initiator composition according to<br>
the invention has an increased safe processing temperature, it can be processed<br>
at temperatures higher than 160°C, preferably higher than 1709C, even more<br>
preferably higher than 175°C, without premature crosslinking resulting. Moreover,<br>
because the crosslinkabie polymer can be crosslinked in a low viscous or molten<br>
state, the processing thereof to shaped objects is significantly easier and can take<br>
place simultaneously with the crosslinking of the crosslinkable polymer in the<br>
presence of the initiator composition, for example by extruding the molten polymer.<br>
An additional benefit of being able to add the initiator composition to molten<br>
crosslinkabie polymer is that the resulting crosslinked polymer is more evenly<br>
crosslinked, which is demonstrated by an improved durability and a better surface<br>
of the crosslinked polymer. As an additional benefit a reduced occurrence of<br>
bubble formation has been found in the crosslinked polymer.<br>
In the process to prepare a trioxepane compound in a purified state the purification<br>
of the glycol hydroperoxide and the 1,2,4-trioxepane compound may be by any<br>
conventional purification method. The purification of the glycol hydroperoxide<br>
preferably is done by extraction, crystallisation, filtration, solvent evaporation or a<br>
combination of one or more of these purification methods. The purification of the<br>
1,2,4-trioxepane compound preferably is done by extraction, distillation, solvent<br><br>
evaporation or a combination of one or more of these purification methods. The<br>
purification step(s) may be repeated one or more times.<br>
Preferred 1,2,4-trioxepane compounds of formula (I) and dialkyl peroxides of<br>
formula (II) are those wherein R1-3 are independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrogen and substituted or unsubstituted C1-C20 alkyl, C3-C20<br>
cycloalkyl, C6-C20 aryl, C7-C20 aralkyl, and C7-C20 alkaryl, which groups may include<br>
linear or branched alkyl moieties, while two of the groups R1-3 may be connected to<br>
form a (substituted) cycloalkyl ring; the optional one or more substituents on each of<br>
R1-R3 being selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, alkoxy, linear or branched<br>
alk(en)yl, aryloxy, halogen, carboxylic acid, ester, carboxy, nitrile, and amido. It<br>
should be noted, however, that if R1 and R2 are both methyl groups, R3 is not<br>
hydrogen.<br>
Preferably, R1 and R3 are selected from lower alkyl groups, more preferably C1-C6<br>
alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, and isopropyl, methyl and ethyl being most<br>
preferred. R2 is preferably selected from hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl, iso-<br>

, wherein R4 is independently selected from any of the<br>
group of compounds given for R1-3. Another preferred product is:<br><br>

more preferably at least 10 ppm, and even more preferably at least 100 ppm dialkyl<br><br>
peroxide. In the most preferred embodiment the amount is at least 500 ppm. The<br>
initiator composition preferably comprises less than 3 wt% dialkyl peroxide, more<br>
preferably less than 2.5 wt%, and even more preferably less than 2 wt%. In the<br>
most preferred embodiment the amount of dialkyl peroxide is less than 1 wt%. All<br>

above 85 wt%. Preferably, the amount is more than 91%, more preferably more<br>
than 92 wt%, and most preferably more than 95%. The amount of trioxepane<br>
compound generally is less than 100 wt%, preferably less than 99.9 wt%. All<br>

The process to crosslink crosslinkable polymer In the presence of the initiator<br>
composition normally takes place at a temperature equal to or higher than the<br><br>
temperature suitable for starting the crosslinking. Preferably, the temperature is<br>
higher than 175°C, more preferably higher than 185°C, and most preferably higher<br>

such as extrusion, injection moulding, roto-moulding, compression moulding,<br>
transfer moulding.<br>
Particularly suitable shaped articles according to the invention are pipes, tubes,<br>
cables, profiles, belting, containers, etc. A preferred shaped article according to the<br>
present invention is a pipe or cable comprising a crosslinked polyethylene as<br>
crosslinked polymer.<br>
The initiator composition according to the present invention can also be suitably<br>
used to modify the molecular weight (distribution) of thermoplastics and/or<br>
thermoplastic elastomers in order to change their Theological properties. Therefore,<br>
the present invention also relates to a process wherein the rheology of a polymer or<br>
copolymer is modified by means of free radicals, using the initiator composition<br>
according to the present invention. The initiator composition can be employed in<br>
processes such as the degradation of polypropylene, the grafting of monomers onto<br>
polymers (e.g. maleic anhydride on polypropylene), and the functionalisation of<br>
poiyolefins. It can also be used for degradation processes near a flame front.<br>
In these processes, the initiator composition can be contacted with the polymeric<br>
material by applying the initiator composition to the surface of a polymeric object<br>
mixing it throughout a polymeric matrix (in the molten, dissolved, granulated, or<br><br>
powdered state), or incorporating it into the polymer during the polymerisation step.<br>
These processes can be performed according to conventional methods.<br>

0.001-15.0 wt%, more preferably 0.005-10.0 wt%, most preferably 0.01-5.0 wt%,<br>

according to the invention include isotactlc polypropylene, a-tactic polypropylene,<br>
syndiotactic polypropylene, alkylene/propylene copolymers such as ethylene/-<br>
propylene random and block copolymers; propylene/diene monomer copolymers,<br>
propylene/styrene copolymers, poly(butene-1), poly(butene-2), polyisobutene,<br>
isoprene/isobutylene copolymers, chlorinated isoprene/ isobutylene copolymers,<br>
poly(methylpentene), polyvinyl alcohol, polystyrene, poly(α-methyl)styrene, 2,6-<br>
dimethyl polyphenylene oxide, styrenics, and mixtures or blends of these polymers<br>
and/or with other non-degradable polymers. Typically, with the degradation some<br>
properties of the polymer are improved, such as tenacity of fibres, warpage of<br>
injection moulded articles, the transparency of polymer films, and/or flowability away<br>
from a flame front. The modification process of the present invention is particularly<br>
advantageous for various polypropylene processes such as fibre spinning, high<br>
speed injection moulding, and melt-blowing of non wovens.<br>
Examples of suitable polymers which can be grafted by means of the initiator<br>
composition according to the present invention are copolymers and block copolymers<br>
of conjugated 1,3-dienes, and one or more copolymerisable monoethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomers such as aromatic monovinylidene hydrocarbons, halogenated<br>
aromatic monovinylidene hydrocarbons, (meth)acrylonitrile, alkyl (meth)acrylates,<br>
acrylamides, unsaturated ketones, vinyl esters, vinylidenes, and vinyl halides;<br>
ethylene/propylene copolymers and ethylene/propylene copolymers with other<br><br>
(poly)unsaturated compounds such as hexadiene-1,4, dicyclopentadiene and 5-<br>
ethylidene norbornene; polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and<br>
copolymers thereof; and polyols including polyols which are essentially free of<br>
ethylenic unsaturation. Such polyols include polyalkylene polyether polyols having<br>
from 2-6 carbon atoms per monomelic unit and an Mn of 400-2000, polyhydroxyl-<br>
containing polyesters, hydroxy-terminated polyesters, and aliphatic polyols.<br>
Suitable monomers for grafting onto the above-mentioned polymers are olefinic or<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as: substituted or unsubstituted vinyl<br>
aromatic monomers including styrene and α-methylstyrene; ethylenically unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof such as (meth)acrylic acids, (meth)acrytic<br>
esters and glycidyl methacrylate; ethylenically unsaturated nitrites and amides such<br>
as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, and acrylamide; substituted or unsubstituted<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as butadiene; vinyl esters such as vinyl<br>
acetate and vinyl propionate; ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and their<br>
derivatives including mono- and diesters, anhydrides, and imides, such as maleic<br>
anhydride, citraconic anhydride, citraconic acid, itaconic acid, nadic anhydride, maleic<br>
acid, aryl, alkyl, and aralkyl citraconimides and maleimides; vinyl halogenides such as<br>
vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride; olefins such as isobutene and 4-<br>
methylpentene; and epoxides.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In the Examples the following methods are used.<br>
Determination of the safe processing temperature<br>
The increase in melt viscosity of the crosslinked polymer samples was measured<br>
at the temperatures indicated in the tables below using an Alpha Technology<br>
Rheometer MDR 2000E. To determine the safe processing temperature the ts2<br>
(min) was measured, ts2 (min) being the time from start of measurement to<br>
minimum viscosity + 0.22 Nm. A higher ts2 (min) is directly related to an increased<br>
sale processing temperature.<br>
Determination of the crosslink efficiency<br>
For all polymers the A torque (represented by delta S in the tables) of the samples<br>
was measured using the Alpha Technology Rheometer MDR2000E. The delta<br>
torque is directly related to the crosslink efficiency.<br>
In addition, for high-density polyethylene crosslinked polymer the crosslinking<br>
efficiency was also determined by means of the gel fraction after cure. The gel<br>
fraction was determined by adding 0.3 gram of crosslinked HDPE from the<br>
Rheometer to xylene, boiling the resulting mixture for 16 hours at a temperature of<br>
136-138°C. During the boiling process the non-crosslinked HDPE was extracted<br>
from the xylene. After the boiling process the HDPE samples were washed with<br>
acetone and dried in a hot air oven for 2 hours and the sample was weighed again.<br>
The gel fraction is calculated as follows<br><br>
The loss of weight is related to the amount of non-crosslinked polymer, hence the<br>
lower the gel fraction, the lower the crosslink efficiency. Further, the t90 (min) was<br>
measured, being the time needed to achieve 90% of total crosslinks.<br><br>
Preparation of an initiator composition according to the present invention<br>
Hexylene glycol hydroperoxide was prepared by reaction of 118.1 g (1.0 mol)<br>
hexylene glycol and 145.7 gr (3 mol) hydrogen peroxide in the presence of sulfuric<br>
acid at a temperature of 30°C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was cooled down to<br>
20°C and neutralized with sodium hydroxide until pH = 6.8. After separation the<br>
underlayer was drained. The remaining crude hexylene glycol hydroperoxide was<br>
converted to sodium salt by the addition of 160 g of a 25% NaOH solution.<br>
Subsequently, the sodium salt was extracted 3 times with ethyl ether in order to<br>
lower the dialkyl peroxide content (di(3-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylbutyl)peroxide). The<br>
remaining sodium salt of hexylene glycol hydroperoxide was acidified with H2SO4<br>
25% until pH 3. Hexylene glycol hydroperoxide was isolated from the solution with<br>
ethyl ether. After evaporation of the ethyl ether the resulting product was analysed<br>
and found to contain 92% hexylene glycol hydroperoxide.<br>
73 g (0.5 mol) of the above-prepared hexylene glycol hydroperoxide were reacted<br>
with 35 g (0.6 mol) of acetone in the presence of sulfuric acid at a temperature of<br>
20°C for 1 hour. After separation, the acid layer was removed and the crude<br>
trioxepane was washed once with a 4% NaOH solution. The trioxepane was dried<br>
on magnesium sulfate. The filtrated product was analysed and found to contain<br>
95% 3,3,5,7,7-pentamethyl-1,2,4-trioxepane and 0.3% of dialkylperoxide (di(3-<br>
hydroxy-1,1-dimethylbutyl)peroxide).<br>

Using the above procedure, the following initiator compositions were prepared.<br><br><br><br>
(Comparative) Examples 1 to 11<br>
Determination of safe processing time and crosslink efficiency of initiator<br>
compositions in crosslinking of high-density polyethylene<br>
To 100 g HDPE (Lupolen 5216Z ex Elenac) in a 250 ml pot an initiator composition<br>
was added and the reaction mixture was tumble-mixed for 30 minutes at ambient<br>
temperature. The amount of initiator composition was such that 5 mmol trioxepane<br>
was present per 100 g of polyethylene. After 16 hours the sample was put on the<br>
Rheometer and the ts2 (min) was measured. After the sample had reached the<br>
maximum torque, it was removed from the Rheometer and the crosslink efficiency<br>
(gel fraction) of the product was determined.<br>
The results are as follows:<br><br><br><br>
(Comparative) Examples 12 and 13<br>
Determination of safe processing time and crosslink efficiency of initiator<br>
compositions in crosslinking of silicone rubbers<br>
To 100 g crosslinkable silicone rubber (Silopren HV3/611U ex GE Bayer) an<br>
initiator composition was added and the whole was mixed on a Dr. Collin two-roll<br>
mill for 5 minutes at ambient temperature. The amount of initiator composition was<br>
chosen such that 2 mmol was present per 100 g of silicone rubber. After mixing the<br>
compound was put on the Rheometer and the ts2 and the crosslinking efficiency (A<br>
torque) were measured.<br>
The results are given in the table below.<br><br><br>
As demonstrated, the safe processing temperature (ts2) in silicon rubber of the<br>
initiator composition according to the invention having a low dialkyl content is<br>
significantly higher than that of the comparative initiator composition having a high<br>
dialkyl content.<br>
(Comparative) Examples 14 and 15<br>
Determination of safe processing time and crosslink efficiency of initiator<br>
compositions in crosslinking of EPDM-rubbers<br>
To a crosslinkable EPDM rubber compound (100 g EPDM, Keltan 578 (ex DSM),<br>
70 g carbon black SRF, 70 g carbon black FEF (ex Cabot), and 50 g oil (Sunpar<br>
2280; ex Sunoco oil) an initiator composition was added and the whole was mixed<br>
on a Dr. Collin two-roll mill for 5 minutes at 60°C. The amount of initiator<br>
composition was chosen such that 14 mmol trioxepane per 100 g rubber was used.<br>
After mixing, the compound was put on the Rheometer and the ts2 and the<br>
crosslinking efficiency (A torque) were measured.<br>
The results are given in the table below.<br><br>
As demonstrated, the safe processing temperature (ts2) in EPDM rubber of the<br>
initiator composition having a low dialkyl content is significantly higher than that of<br>
the initiator composition having a high dialkyl content.<br><br>
Examples 16 to 23<br>
Safe processing time depending on the amount of initiator composition used in the<br>
crosslinking of HOPE<br>
To 100 g HDPE (Lupolen 5216Z ex Elenac) in a 250 ml pot an initiator composition<br>
was added and the reaction mixture was tumble-mixed for 30 minutes at ambient<br>
temperature. The amount of initiator composition was such that 2, 5, 10, 17.2 or<br>
17.3 mmol trioxepane was present per 100 g of polyethylene. After 16 hours the<br>
sample was put on the Rheometer and the ts2/min was measured. After the<br>
sample had reached the maximum torque, it was removed from the Rheometer<br>
and the crosslink efficiency (gel fraction) of the product was determined.<br>
The results are given in the tables below.<br><br><br><br>
From the above table it can be seen that the safe processing temperature, as<br>
expressed in ts2, and the crosslinking time, as expressed in t90, decrease when<br>
the amount of initiator increases.<br>

Polypropylene degradation<br>
Initiator composition A (when used) was dissolved in dichloromethane (approx. 5<br>
wt% solution) and mixed with polypropylene (PP) powder in an amount of 0<br>
(Comparative Example 24), 0.325 (Example 25) or 0.65 (Example 26) meq<br>
peroxide /100 g PP. The mixtures were placed in a fume cupboard for 4 hours to<br>
remove dichloromethane. In addition, 0.05% by weight of Irganox 1010<br>
(antioxidant) powder, based on the weight of PP, was mixed in.<br>
The resulting mixture was fed into a Haake Rheocord system 40 with Rheomex<br>
TW100 intensive mixing screws using a Plasticolor 2000 single screw feeder with<br>
screw housing type 15/22. In order to maintain low-oxygen conditions, nitrogen<br>
was introduced into the hopper (2.5 Itr/min) and around the die (9 Itr/min). During<br>
extrusion the screw speed was set to 50 rpm and the temperature settings were<br><br>
190/250/250/250°C. The resulting strand was cooled using a water bath and<br>
granulated using an Automatlk ASG5 granulator.<br>
Before analysis the granules were dried overnight in a circulation oven at 60°C.<br>
The melt flow index (MFI) of the polymer was analysed in the conventional way<br>
using method ASTM D1238 (230°C / 2.16 kg).<br>

Maleic anhydride grafting onto polypropylene<br>
Initiator composition A (when used) was dissolved in dichloromethane (approx. 5%<br>
weight solution) and mixed with a propylene homopolymer (grade HC001A-B1 ex<br>
Borealis) in an amount of 0 (Comparative Example 27), 0.5 (Example 28) or 1.0<br>
(Example 29) meq peroxide /100 g PP.<br>
The mixtures were placed in a fume cupboard for 4 hours to remove the dichloro-<br>
methane. Subsequently, 0.05% by weight of Irganox 1010 (antioxidant) and 1% by<br>
weight of maleic anhydride (MAH) powder, both based on the weight of PP, were<br>
mixed in.<br><br>
The resulting mixture was fed into a Haake Rheocord system 9000 with Rheomex<br>
TW100 intensive mixing screws using a Plasticolor 2000 single screw feeder with<br>
screw housing type 15/22. in order to maintain low-oxygen conditions, nitrogen<br>
was introduced into the hopper (2.5 Itr/min) and around the die (9 Itr/min). During<br>
extrusion the screw speed was set to 80 rpm and the temperature settings were<br>
160/220/220/220°C. The resulting strand was cooled using a water bath and<br>
granulated using an Automatik ASG5 granulator.<br>
Before analysis the granules were dried overnight in a circulation oven at 60°C.<br>
The MFt of the polymer was analysed in the conventional way using method ASTM<br>
D1238(190°C/2.16kg).<br>
To remove non-grafted MAH, the dried polymer was extracted with 80 ml of a<br>
mixture of dichloromethane/cyclohexane 3:1 V7V for 3 hours in the boiling mode<br>
and 1 hour in the rinsing mode in a Tecator Soxtec System HT2 (1045 Extraction<br>
unit + 1046 Service unit). Subsequently, the extracted polymer was vacuum dried<br>
overnight in a vacuum oven at 70°C. The extracted and dried polymer was used to<br>
press film material in a Fontijne press.<br>
The conditions used were:<br>
1.3 grams of polymer<br>
1 min at 190°C/10 kN<br>
1 min at 190°C/50 kN<br>
1 minat190°C/150 kN<br>
1 min at 30°C/150 kN<br>
The obtained film material was used to analyse the MAH grafting index by Infrared<br>
measurement using a Brüker Vector 22 FT-IR. This index is defined as the<br>
absorbance ratio of the MAH peak at 1790 cm-1 and the PP peak at 1167 cm-1<br>
(correction for film thickness) multiplied by 100.<br><br>
The results are shown in the table below. It shows that the initiator composition<br>
