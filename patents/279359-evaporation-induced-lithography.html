				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to lithographic pattern formation upon evaporation of a<br>
liquid drop containing solute (molecules) or dispersed particles, referred herein as<br>
Evaporation Induced Lithography. More particularly the process of the present invention<br>
is entirely evaporation based producing patterns of colloidal particles ranging from<br>
nanoparticles, quantum dots, single molecules to polymers in aqueous and organic<br>
solvents. The process also includes formation of patterns of more than one layer<br>
including reaction of two species along the TEM grid lines<br>

gold thin film in a manner analogous to that of a dip-pen. Molecules are delivered from<br>
the AFM tip to a solid substrate of interest via capillary transport, making DPN a<br>
potentially useful tool for creating and functionalizing nanoscale devices.<br>

US 7,018,944 describes a method for generating a mask: having a nanoscale pattern,<br>
the method comprises a suspension liquid (containing periodically arranged objects),<br>
being placed on top of a supporting liquid that is placed on a substrate surface. The<br>
periodic arrangement of the objects in the suspension liquid has to be maintained over a<br>
given area using the apparatus. These ordered objects in the suspension create a mask<br>
and deposit a material through interstices contained in the mask so as to create a<br>
pattern on the substrate. The deposition of the material is carried out by one of the<br>
processes like sputtering, evaporation and spraying of a colloidal solution. It does not<br>
have the rigidity of the grid in depositing patterns.<br>
Further, the primary aim of the above patent is to organize particles on a substrate by<br>
placing the original particles on a liquid, which upon drainage leads to arrangement of<br>
the particles on the substrate surface. In this way layer of particles are arranged on the<br>
substrate surface based on their natural separation depending on the diameters of the<br>
particles. In addition, depositions of materials in the interstices of the particles followed<br>
by removal of the particles generate patterns of the new materials.<br>

Lithography" Langmuir: Vol. 22, No. 26: December 19, 2006, pp 11426- 11435) reports<br>
the assembly of colloidal particles into confined arrangements and patterns on various<br>
cleaned and chemically modified solid substrates using a method which the term<br>
3<br>
 <br>
authors term as"confined dewetting lithography". It teaches use of functionalized<br>
substrate surfaces with positively charge materials so that negatively charge polystyrene<br>
spheres could be better deposited. This art teaches use of polystyrene spheres of<br>
micrometer sizes to deposit the same in patterned formats as per the pattern of the grid<br>
(which is a cell) on ITO/glass and Si/SiO2 surfaces.<br>
The drawbacks of the prior art methods of lithography is one or more of the following: (a)<br>
they are limited by the diffraction wavelength of light (photolithography); (b the pattern<br>
formation could be made on specific substrates and requires high vacuum conditions<br>
(electron and ion beam lithography or X-ray lithography); (c) the speed of writing any<br>
particular high-resolution large scale structure is very low (dip-pen lithography); (d) the<br>
structures obtained by the conventional method (soft lithography) have either low<br>
resolution or are not applicable to a large set of materials constituting the structure; (e)<br>
there is no systematic way of controlling the patterns of structures especially at the large<br>
scale and those that are not formed by reaction diffusion (pattern formation by reaction<br>
diffusion waves); (f) there is limited flexibility in terms of various pattern formation or<br>
systematic pattern generation (nanosphere lithography); (g) organized single-molecule<br>
patterns on substrates are either not possible or difficult to achieve, (h) does not have<br>
rigidity of the grids in depositing patterns.<br>
Thus there is need for a fast, efficient single method where colloidal particles or solute<br>
particles can be systematically patterned on substrate surfaces, and the nature of the<br>
patterns can be controlled by external parameters and also layer-by-layer deposition of<br>
patterned structures could be obtained.<br>
Objects of Invention<br>
Thus the main objective of the present invention is to generate scalable patterned<br>
assembly of colloidal particles and molecular materials deposited on a substrate surface<br>
such as glass slides by evaporating a liquid drop, containing the colloidal particles or<br>
molecular materials, onto which a metallic grid mask (TEM grid) is placed for guided<br>
pattern formation.<br>

Unlike the prior art the present invention does not use any films. The grids used do not<br>
form cells and no charged particles of use of chemical charge for deposition is used. The<br>
rigidity of the grids used is also unlike that of prior art. More particularly the process of<br>
the present invention is entirely evaporation based and the sidewall of the glass slide on<br>
which the process is carried out is not even bounded and no supporting or suspension<br>
liquids are used unlike the prior art. Further the TEM grid is not pretreated before its<br>
usage. Moreover the application of present method for producing patterns of colloidal<br>
particles ranging from nanoparticles, quantum dots, single molecules to polymers in<br>
aqueous and organic solvents. Additionally the formation of patterns by reaction two<br>
species along the TEM grid lines (CdS nanoparticles by reaction between CdCI2 and<br>
Na2S) is demonstrated.<br>

 <br>
The method developed by the present inventors has the unique advantage of patterned<br>
deposition of molecular and colloidal particles on the substrate surface by evaporation at<br>
room temperature where the pattern is guided by the structure of the mask -metallic grid<br>
(TEM grid) and the structure is formed by assembly of the materials along the patterned<br>
lines. The mask could also be membrane and the deposition pattern in that case follows<br>
the porous structure of the membrane.<br>
It is a facile, versatile and a general method for the generation of micron and submicron<br>
scale patterns of molecular and nanoscale materials assembled on a substrate surface.<br>
The primary condition for generating patterns of any materials is that the substance,<br>
whose pattern is to be generated, should be soluble or dispersible in a volatile liquid like<br>
water and toluene. The substances, the patterns of which can be generated are<br>
nanoscale particles of metal such as gold (Au), silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) or other<br>
metal nanoparticles that are dispersible in a volatile solvent and semiconductors such as<br>
CdS, Mn2+ doped CdS and ZnS or other semiconductor nanoparticles that are<br>
dispersible in a volatile solvent, solutions of single molecules such as an organic dye<br>
(Rhodamine B, Nile Red), solution of inorganic materials such as<br>
CdCI2, solution/dispersion of polymers like polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), or other polymers<br>
that are soluble or dispersible in a volatile solvent.<br>
The droplets of these solutions / dispersions, upon evaporation in the presence of a<br>
metallic grid mask such as a transmission electron microscope (TEM) grid, lead to<br>
the deposition of patterned assembly of molecular and nanoscale materials on the<br>
surface of glass slides (substrates) where the droplets were placed. The pattern of the<br>
assembly follow that of the TEM grid with dimensions of lines far reduced than those of<br>
the TEM grids.<br>
Smaller lines and arrays may be deposited using membrane as mask for deposition<br>
where the deposited pattern follows the pattern of the porous structure as shown in<br>
Figure 13<br>
According to a preferred aspect the method produces layer-by-layer three-dimensional<br>
deposition of assembled materials on the substrate surface. The patterns of the second<br>
layer of deposition can be made at a chosen angle to that of the first layer patterns.<br>
7<br>
 <br>
The materials of the second layer is same or different from that of the first layer. For<br>
example, when the first layer of patterned deposition is made of assembly of metal<br>
nanoparticles, the second layer is of semiconductor nanoparticles (quantum dots).<br>
If the first patterned layer is made of a reactant the second patterned layer is made of a<br>
second reactant, where the second reactant reacts with the first one at the overlapping<br>
regions and produces the product at the intersections, which constitute the reaction<br>
sites.<br>
Hence, present invention of patterns generation by restricted evaporation using a TEM<br>
grid or any other similar mask opens a new approach to the growth of organized<br>
multidimensional arrays of colloidal particles in general. The present invention reveals<br>
the versatility of the simple evaporation process for aligning nanometer-to-micrometer-<br>
sized objects.<br>
The striking simplicity of the present restricted evaporation process finds use in the<br>
fabrication of biological devices, semiconductors and other electronic devices. This facile<br>
method of arranging particles in two and three - dimensional arrays is considered as a<br>
general method of patterned deposition of particles of various sizes and nature. The<br>
method may be used as basis for higher hierarchical device structures and opens up the<br>
possibility of making large-scale electronic devices with individually addressable<br>
nanoscopic and or molecular components.<br>
The details of the method are mentioned below. The potential applications of this<br>
simple method range from optoelectronic devices to micro and nano arrays of DNA,<br>
proteins etc.<br>
The principle behind this new technique is to evaporate a droplet of the solution<br>
(dispersion) containing the materials, of which pattern is to be generated, placed on a<br>
substrate surface (flat) in the presence of a metallic grid mask placed on top of the<br>
droplet.<br>
The invention is now defined by way of following non-limiting illustrative examples:<br>
8<br>
 <br>
Grids used in the examples<br>
Commercially available TEM grid is used as the metallic grid mask. TEM grids are used<br>
are made of copper or nickel metals. The grids made of copper had regular arrays of<br>
rectangular openings of 45 micron x 45 micron with the metallic arms of the rectangle<br>
having dimensions of 45 microns x 5 microns (Figure 1a). Overall, the grid is circular<br>
with a diameter of about 3 mm.<br>
On the other hand, the grids made of nickel has regular arrays of rectangular openings<br>
of 100 micron x100 micron with the metallic arms of the rectangle having dimensions of<br>
100 microns x 10 microns (Figure 1b). Overall, the grid is circular with a diameter of<br>
about 3 mm.<br>
More than one such grids may be attached and used together.<br>
Example 1<br>
The present example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of AuNPs on a<br>
substrate surface. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is first cleaned by<br>
ethanol solution and then air-dried. A colloidal solution of Au nanoparticles is prepared<br>
by treating 5 mL aqueous HAuCI4 (0.1 mM) with 1 mM of NaBH4. A drop (20 uL) of an<br>
aqueous solution of the colloidal Au nanoparticles is then placed onto the glass slide. A<br>
TEM copper grid is then placed carefully onto the drop such that the grid stays on the<br>
drop. A schematic view of the method of pattern generation is shown in Figure 2. The<br>
drop along with the TEM grid is then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30 min. The grid is<br>
then lifted after 30 min such that the structures imprinted on the slide are minimally<br>
disturbed. The structure imprinted on the slide is then investigated using optical<br>
microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy etc. The details of<br>
the micrographs are shown in Figures 3, 4, 5a and 5b. These two dimensional arrays are<br>
0.4-0.6 micron in height with a width of 4-6 micron. When the above evaporation is<br>
carried out in the presence of a commercially available IR light lamp (commercial 150<br>
watts IR lamp, Brite Lamps) the patterns are more distinct, lines are thinner (typical line<br>
width of 2 micron instead of 4-6 micron) and the evaporation process is completed in 10<br>
min instead of 30 min.<br>
9<br>
 <br>
Example 2<br>
The present example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of Rhodamine B<br>
dye on a substrate surface. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is first cleaned<br>
by ethanol solution and then air-dried. An aqueous solution of Rhodamine B dye was<br>
prepared by dissolving 100 uL of 0.1 M dye in 10 mL of Milli-Q water. A drop (20 uL) of<br>
an aqueous solution of the Rhodamine B dye was then placed onto the glass slide. A<br>
TEM copper / nickel grid was then placed carefully onto the drop such that the grid holds<br>
its position on the drop. A schematic view of the method of pattern generation is shown<br>
in Figure 2. The drop along with the TEM grid is then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30<br>
min. The grid is then lifted after 30 min such that the structures imprinted on the slide is<br>
minimally disturbed. The structure imprinted on the slide is then investigated using<br>
optical microscopy. The details of the micrographs are shown in Figure 6. When the<br>
above evaporation is carried out in the presence of a commercially available IR lamp<br>
(commercial 150 watts IR lamp, Brite Lamps) the patterns are more distinct, lines are<br>
thinner (typical line width of 1 micron instead of 3 micron) and the evaporation process is<br>
completed in 10 min instead of 30 min.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of Nile Red dye on a<br>
substrate surface. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is first cleaned by<br>
ethanol solution and then dried. An aqueous solution of Nile Red dye is prepared by<br>
dissolving 0.1 mg of the dye in 5ml of toluene. A drop (20 uL) of an aqueous solution of<br>
the Nile Red dye is then placed onto the glass slide. A TEM copper / nickel grid is then<br>
placed carefully onto the drop such that the grid holds its position on the drop. A<br>
schematic view of the method of pattern generation is shown in Figure 2. The drop along<br>
with the TEM grid is then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30 min. The grid is then lifted<br>
after 30 min such that the structures imprinted on the slide is minimally disturbed.The<br>
structure imprinted on the slide is then investigated using optical microscopy. The details<br>
of the micrographs are shown in Figure 7.<br>
When the above evaporation is carried out in the presence of a commercially available<br>
IR lamp (commercial 150 watts IR lamp, Brite Lamps) the patterns are more distinct,<br>
lines were thinner (typical line width of 1 micron instead of 3 micron) and the evaporation<br>
process is completed in 10 min instead of 30 min.<br>
10<br>
 <br>
Example 4<br>
The present example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of CdCI2 on a<br>
substrate surface. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm was first cleaned by<br>
ethanol solution and then dried. An aqueous solution of 1.1 x 10-4 M of CdCI2 is<br>
prepared. A drop (20 uL) of an aqueous solution of CdCI2 is then placed onto the glass<br>
slide. A TEM copper / nickel grid is then placed carefully onto the drop such that the grid<br>
holds its position on the drop. A schematic view of the method of pattern generation is<br>
shown in Figure 2. The drop along with the TEM grid is then left to evaporate at 300°C<br>
for 30 min. The grid is then lifted after 30 min using such that the structures imprinted on<br>
the slide is minimally disturbed. The structure imprinted on the slide is then investigated<br>
using optical microscopy. The details of the micrographs are shown in Figure 8.<br>
When the above evaporation was carried out in the presence of a commercially available<br>
IR lamp (commercial 150 watts IR lamp, Brite Lamps) the patterns are more distinct,<br>
lines are thinner (typical line width of 1 micron instead of 3 micron) and the evaporation<br>
process is completed in 10 min instead of 30 min.<br>
Example 5<br>
The present example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of PVP on a<br>
substrate surface. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is first cleaned by<br>
ethanol solution and then dried. An aqueous solution of PVP is prepared by dissolving<br>
15 mg of PVP in 2 mL of Milli-Q water. A drop (20 uL) of an aqueous solution of PVP is<br>
then placed onto the glass slide. A TEM copper / nickel grid is then placed carefully onto<br>
the drop such that the grid holds its position on the drop. A schematic view of the<br>
method of pattern generation is shown in Figure 2. The drop along with the TEM grid is<br>
then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30 min. The grid is then lifted after 30 min such that<br>
the structures imprinted on the slide is minimally disturbed. The structure imprinted on<br>
the slide is then investigated using optical microscopy. The details of the micrographs<br>
are shown in Figure 9.<br>
When the above evaporation is carried out in the presence of a commercially available<br>
IR lamp (commercial 150 watts IR lamp, Brite Lamps) the patterns are more distinct,<br>
lines are thinner (typical line width of 1 micron instead of 3 micron) and the evaporation<br>
process is completed in 10 min instead of 30 min.<br>

 <br>
The above methods provide two-dimensional micron line patterns, consisting of arrays of<br>
colloidal particles, on glass substrate surfaces. As can be seen from the figures there<br>
are three kinds of deposits as results of evaporation under the above conditions. They<br>
are as follows:<br>
(a)	Single line deposits of materials along the TEM grid lines with thickness on the<br>
order of 6.01 microns. These lines have typical heights on the order of 0.45<br>
microns on the substrate (glass) surface. (Figures 3A and 3B)<br>
(b)	Double line deposits of materials (with a spacing of 20 micron) along the TEM<br>
grid lines with thickness on the order of 2 micron or less. These lines have typical<br>
heights on the order of 1 micron. (Figure 5a)<br>
(c)	Plate -like continuous deposits of materials along the TEM grid lines with<br>
thickness on the order of 4 microns or less. These plates have typical heights on<br>
the order of 1 micron. (Figures8A, 8B.9A, 9B, 6)<br>
Example 6<br>
The, deposition of two layers of patterned materials one on top of the other is<br>
demonstrated as follows.<br>
The first layer of material (Au nanoparticles) is deposited on a glass slide as mentioned<br>
above using a TEM grid on top of a drop of an aqueous solution of AuNPs. When the<br>
deposited material is completely dried in 30 min (after removal of the grid) another drop<br>
of the same solution is again placed at the place where the original drop was there (that<br>
led to the formation of first grid patterns). A TEM grid is likewise placed on top of this<br>
drop followed by evaporation of the same. The process finally led to the formation of<br>
double-layered patterns where one layer of patterned deposits is placed on top of a<br>
previous layer of patterned deposits. The deposition of the first patterned layer is same<br>
(similar) as those described earlier.<br>
The deposition of the second patterned layer is typically thinner than the first layer. In<br>
other words, the lines corresponding to the patterned deposition are comparatively<br>
slimmer and height smaller with typical width of 0.8 micron. However, the patterns of the<br>
lines followed those of the TEM grid metal lines as with the first layer. The relative<br>
orientation and position of the lines of the first and second layers are decided by the<br>
12<br>
 <br>
relative orientation of the TEM grid at the time of the first layer deposition and that during<br>
the second layer. The details of the micrographs are shown in Figure 10.<br>
Example 7<br>
The present example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of CdS quantum<br>
dots on a substrate surface by reaction. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is<br>
first cleaned by ethanol solution and then dried. Aqueous solutions of 1.1 x 10-4 M of<br>
CdCI2 and 0.01 M Na2S is prepared in Milli-Q water. A drop (20 uL) of an aqueous<br>
solution of CdCI2 is then placed onto the glass slide. A TEM copper / nickel grid is then<br>
placed carefully (using a pair of forceps) onto the drop such that the grid stays on the<br>
drop. A schematic view of the method of pattern generation is shown in Figure 2. The<br>
drop along with the TEM grid is then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30 min. The grid is<br>
then lifted after 30 min using a pair of forceps such that the structures imprinted on the<br>
slide is minimally disturbed. Then, a drop (20 uL) of an aqueous solution of Na2S is<br>
placed on the patterned structures of CdCI2. CdS quantum dots are produced at the<br>
overlapping regions where reaction occurs between them. The structure imprinted on the<br>
slide is then investigated using optical microscopy. The details of the micrographs are<br>
shown in Figure 11.<br>
Example 8<br>
This example demonstrates generation of patterned structures using two grids together.<br>
A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is first cleaned by ethanol solution and<br>
then dried. A droplet of an aqueous solution containing the colloidal particles (Au NPs or<br>
and any other solute/dispersed particles) is placed on the glass slide. Two TEM copper /<br>
nickel grids attached to each other such that their grid lines are at an angle, are then<br>
placed carefully onto the drop such that the grids hold their position on the drop. A<br>
schematic view of the method of pattern generation is similar to the one shown in Figure<br>
2. The drop along with the two TEM grids is then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30 min.<br>
The grids are then lifted after 30 min such that the structures imprinted on the slide is<br>
minimally disturbed. The structure imprinted on the slide is then investigated using<br>
optical microscopy. The details of the micrographs are shown in Figure 12.<br>

US 7,018,944 describes a method for generating a mask: having a nanoscale pattern,<br>
the method comprises a suspension liquid (containing periodically arranged objects),<br>
being placed on top of a supporting liquid that is placed on a substrate surface. The<br>
periodic arrangement of the objects in the suspension liquid has to be maintained over a<br>
given area using the apparatus. These ordered objects in the suspension create a mask<br>
and deposit a material through interstices contained in the mask so as to create a<br>
pattern on the substrate. The deposition of the material is carried out by one of the<br>
processes like sputtering, evaporation and spraying of a colloidal solution. It does not<br>
have the rigidity of the grid in depositing patterns.<br>
Further, the primary aim of the above patent is to organize particles on a substrate by<br>
placing the original particles on a liquid, which upon drainage leads to arrangement of<br>
the particles on the substrate surface. In this way layer of particles are arranged on the<br>
substrate surface based on their natural separation depending on the diameters of the<br>
particles. In addition, depositions of materials in the interstices of the particles followed<br>

the assembly of colloidal particles into confined arrangements and patterns on various<br>

 <br>
authors term as"confined dewetting lithography". It teaches use of functionalized<br>
substrate surfaces with positively charge materials so that negatively charge polystyrene<br>
spheres could be better deposited. This art teaches use of polystyrene spheres of<br>
micrometer sizes to deposit the same in patterned formats as per the pattern of the grid<br>
(which is a cell) on ITO/glass and Si/SiO2 surfaces.<br>
The drawbacks of the prior art methods of lithography is one or more of the following: (a)<br>
they are limited by the diffraction wavelength of light (photolithography); (b the pattern<br>
formation could be made on specific substrates and requires high vacuum conditions<br>
(electron and ion beam lithography or X-ray lithography); (c) the speed of writing any<br>
particular high-resolution large scale structure is very low (dip-pen lithography); (d) the<br>
structures obtained by the conventional method (soft lithography) have either low<br>
resolution or are not applicable to a large set of materials constituting the structure; (e)<br>
there is no systematic way of controlling the patterns of structures especially at the large<br>
scale and those that are not formed by reaction diffusion (pattern formation by reaction<br>
diffusion waves); (f) there is limited flexibility in terms of various pattern formation or<br>
systematic pattern generation (nanosphere lithography); (g) organized single-molecule<br>
patterns on substrates are either not possible or difficult to achieve, (h) does not have<br>
rigidity of the grids in depositing patterns.<br>
Thus there is need for a fast, efficient single method where colloidal particles or solute<br>
particles can be systematically patterned on substrate surfaces, and the nature of the<br>
patterns can be controlled by external parameters and also layer-by-layer deposition of<br>
patterned structures could be obtained.<br>
Objects of Invention<br>
Thus the main objective of the present invention is to generate scalable patterned<br>
assembly of colloidal particles and molecular materials deposited on a substrate surface<br>
such as glass slides by evaporating a liquid drop, containing the colloidal particles or<br>
molecular materials, onto which a metallic grid mask (TEM grid) is placed for guided<br>
pattern formation.<br>

Unlike the prior art the present invention does not use any films. The grids used do not<br>
form cells and no charged particles of use of chemical charge for deposition is used. The<br>
rigidity of the grids used is also unlike that of prior art. More particularly the process of<br>
the present invention is entirely evaporation based and the sidewall of the glass slide on<br>
which the process is carried out is not even bounded and no supporting or suspension<br>
liquids are used unlike the prior art. Further the TEM grid is not pretreated before its<br>
usage. Moreover the application of present method for producing patterns of colloidal<br>
particles ranging from nanoparticles, quantum dots, single molecules to polymers in<br>
aqueous and organic solvents. Additionally the formation of patterns by reaction two<br>
species along the TEM grid lines (CdS nanoparticles by reaction between CdCI2 and<br>
Na2S) is demonstrated.<br>
6<br>
 <br>
The method developed by the present inventors has the unique advantage of patterned<br>
deposition of molecular and colloidal particles on the substrate surface by evaporation at<br>
room temperature where the pattern is guided by the structure of the mask -metallic grid<br>
(TEM grid) and the structure is formed by assembly of the materials along the patterned<br>
lines. The mask could also be membrane and the deposition pattern in that case follows<br>
the porous structure of the membrane.<br>
It is a facile, versatile and a general method for the generation of micron and submicron<br>
scale patterns of molecular and nanoscale materials assembled on a substrate surface.<br>
The primary condition for generating patterns of any materials is that the substance,<br>
whose pattern is to be generated, should be soluble or dispersible in a volatile liquid like<br>
water and toluene. The substances, the patterns of which can be generated are<br>
nanoscale particles of metal such as gold (Au), silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) or other<br>
metal nanoparticles that are dispersible in a volatile solvent and semiconductors such as<br>
CdS, Mn2+ doped CdS and ZnS or other semiconductor nanoparticles that are<br>
dispersible in a volatile solvent, solutions of single molecules such as an organic dye<br>
(Rhodamine B, Nile Red), solution of inorganic materials such as<br>
CdCI2, solution/dispersion of polymers like polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), or other polymers<br>
that are soluble or dispersible in a volatile solvent.<br>
The droplets of these solutions / dispersions, upon evaporation in the presence of a<br>
metallic grid mask such as a transmission electron microscope (TEM) grid, lead to<br>
the deposition of patterned assembly of molecular and nanoscale materials on the<br>
surface of glass slides (substrates) where the droplets were placed. The pattern of the<br>
assembly follow that of the TEM grid with dimensions of lines far reduced than those of<br>
the TEM grids.<br>
Smaller lines and arrays may be deposited using membrane as mask for deposition<br>
where the deposited pattern follows the pattern of the porous structure as shown in<br>
Figure 13<br>
According to a preferred aspect the method produces layer-by-layer three-dimensional<br>
deposition of assembled materials on the substrate surface. The patterns of the second<br>
layer of deposition can be made at a chosen angle to that of the first layer patterns.<br>
7<br>
 <br>
The materials of the second layer is same or different from that of the first layer. For<br>
example, when the first layer of patterned deposition is made of assembly of metal<br>
nanoparticles, the second layer is of semiconductor nanoparticles (quantum dots).<br>
If the first patterned layer is made of a reactant the second patterned layer is made of a<br>
second reactant, where the second reactant reacts with the first one at the overlapping<br>
regions and produces the product at the intersections, which constitute the reaction<br>
sites.<br>
Hence, present invention of patterns generation by restricted evaporation using a TEM<br>
grid or any other similar mask opens a new approach to the growth of organized<br>
multidimensional arrays of colloidal particles in general. The present invention reveals<br>
the versatility of the simple evaporation process for aligning nanometer-to-micrometer-<br>
sized objects.<br>
The striking simplicity of the present restricted evaporation process finds use in the<br>
fabrication of biological devices, semiconductors and other electronic devices. This facile<br>
method of arranging particles in two and three - dimensional arrays is considered as a<br>
general method of patterned deposition of particles of various sizes and nature. The<br>
method may be used as basis for higher hierarchical device structures and opens up the<br>
possibility of making large-scale electronic devices with individually addressable<br>
nanoscopic and or molecular components.<br>
The details of the method are mentioned below. The potential applications of this<br>
simple method range from optoelectronic devices to micro and nano arrays of DNA,<br>
proteins etc.<br>
The principle behind this new technique is to evaporate a droplet of the solution<br>
(dispersion) containing the materials, of which pattern is to be generated, placed on a<br>
substrate surface (flat) in the presence of a metallic grid mask placed on top of the<br>
droplet.<br>
The invention is now defined by way of following non-limiting illustrative examples:<br>
8<br>
 <br>
Grids used in the examples<br>
Commercially available TEM grid is used as the metallic grid mask. TEM grids are used<br>
are made of copper or nickel metals. The grids made of copper had regular arrays of<br>
rectangular openings of 45 micron x 45 micron with the metallic arms of the rectangle<br>
having dimensions of 45 microns x 5 microns (Figure 1a). Overall, the grid is circular<br>
with a diameter of about 3 mm.<br>
On the other hand, the grids made of nickel has regular arrays of rectangular openings<br>
of 100 micron x100 micron with the metallic arms of the rectangle having dimensions of<br>
100 microns x 10 microns (Figure 1b). Overall, the grid is circular with a diameter of<br>
about 3 mm.<br>
More than one such grids may be attached and used together.<br>
Example 1<br>
The present example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of AuNPs on a<br>
substrate surface. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is first cleaned by<br>
ethanol solution and then air-dried. A colloidal solution of Au nanoparticles is prepared<br>
by treating 5 mL aqueous HAuCI4 (0.1 mM) with 1 mM of NaBH4. A drop (20 uL) of an<br>
aqueous solution of the colloidal Au nanoparticles is then placed onto the glass slide. A<br>
TEM copper grid is then placed carefully onto the drop such that the grid stays on the<br>
drop. A schematic view of the method of pattern generation is shown in Figure 2. The<br>
drop along with the TEM grid is then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30 min. The grid is<br>
then lifted after 30 min such that the structures imprinted on the slide are minimally<br>
disturbed. The structure imprinted on the slide is then investigated using optical<br>
microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy etc. The details of<br>
the micrographs are shown in Figures 3, 4, 5a and 5b. These two dimensional arrays are<br>
0.4-0.6 micron in height with a width of 4-6 micron. When the above evaporation is<br>
carried out in the presence of a commercially available IR light lamp (commercial 150<br>
watts IR lamp, Brite Lamps) the patterns are more distinct, lines are thinner (typical line<br>
width of 2 micron instead of 4-6 micron) and the evaporation process is completed in 10<br>
min instead of 30 min.<br>
9<br>
 <br>
Example 2<br>
The present example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of Rhodamine B<br>
dye on a substrate surface. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is first cleaned<br>
by ethanol solution and then air-dried. An aqueous solution of Rhodamine B dye was<br>
prepared by dissolving 100 uL of 0.1 M dye in 10 mL of Milli-Q water. A drop (20 uL) of<br>
an aqueous solution of the Rhodamine B dye was then placed onto the glass slide. A<br>
TEM copper / nickel grid was then placed carefully onto the drop such that the grid holds<br>
its position on the drop. A schematic view of the method of pattern generation is shown<br>
in Figure 2. The drop along with the TEM grid is then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30<br>
min. The grid is then lifted after 30 min such that the structures imprinted on the slide is<br>
minimally disturbed. The structure imprinted on the slide is then investigated using<br>
optical microscopy. The details of the micrographs are shown in Figure 6. When the<br>
above evaporation is carried out in the presence of a commercially available IR lamp<br>
(commercial 150 watts IR lamp, Brite Lamps) the patterns are more distinct, lines are<br>
thinner (typical line width of 1 micron instead of 3 micron) and the evaporation process is<br>
completed in 10 min instead of 30 min.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of Nile Red dye on a<br>
substrate surface. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is first cleaned by<br>
ethanol solution and then dried. An aqueous solution of Nile Red dye is prepared by<br>
dissolving 0.1 mg of the dye in 5ml of toluene. A drop (20 uL) of an aqueous solution of<br>
the Nile Red dye is then placed onto the glass slide. A TEM copper / nickel grid is then<br>
placed carefully onto the drop such that the grid holds its position on the drop. A<br>
schematic view of the method of pattern generation is shown in Figure 2. The drop along<br>
with the TEM grid is then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30 min. The grid is then lifted<br>
after 30 min such that the structures imprinted on the slide is minimally disturbed.The<br>
structure imprinted on the slide is then investigated using optical microscopy. The details<br>
of the micrographs are shown in Figure 7.<br>
When the above evaporation is carried out in the presence of a commercially available<br>
IR lamp (commercial 150 watts IR lamp, Brite Lamps) the patterns are more distinct,<br>
lines were thinner (typical line width of 1 micron instead of 3 micron) and the evaporation<br>
process is completed in 10 min instead of 30 min.<br>

Example 4<br>
The present example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of CdCI2 on a<br>
substrate surface. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm was first cleaned by<br>
ethanol solution and then dried. An aqueous solution of 1.1 x 10-4 M of CdCI2 is<br>
prepared. A drop (20 uL) of an aqueous solution of CdCI2 is then placed onto the glass<br>
slide. A TEM copper / nickel grid is then placed carefully onto the drop such that the grid<br>
holds its position on the drop. A schematic view of the method of pattern generation is<br>
shown in Figure 2. The drop along with the TEM grid is then left to evaporate at 300°C<br>
for 30 min. The grid is then lifted after 30 min using such that the structures imprinted on<br>
the slide is minimally disturbed. The structure imprinted on the slide is then investigated<br>
using optical microscopy. The details of the micrographs are shown in Figure 8.<br>

IR lamp (commercial 150 watts IR lamp, Brite Lamps) the patterns are more distinct,<br>
lines are thinner (typical line width of 1 micron instead of 3 micron) and the evaporation<br>
process is completed in 10 min instead of 30 min.<br>
Example 5<br>
The present example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of PVP on a<br>
substrate surface. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is first cleaned by<br>
ethanol solution and then dried. An aqueous solution of PVP is prepared by dissolving<br>
15 mg of PVP in 2 mL of Milli-Q water. A drop (20 uL) of an aqueous solution of PVP is<br>
then placed onto the glass slide. A TEM copper / nickel grid is then placed carefully onto<br>
the drop such that the grid holds its position on the drop. A schematic view of the<br>
method of pattern generation is shown in Figure 2. The drop along with the TEM grid is<br>
then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30 min. The grid is then lifted after 30 min such that<br>
the structures imprinted on the slide is minimally disturbed. The structure imprinted on<br>
the slide is then investigated using optical microscopy. The details of the micrographs<br>
are shown in Figure 9.<br>
When the above evaporation is carried out in the presence of a commercially available<br>
IR lamp (commercial 150 watts IR lamp, Brite Lamps) the patterns are more distinct,<br>

process is completed in 10 min instead of 30 min.<br>

 <br>
The above methods provide two-dimensional micron line patterns, consisting of arrays of<br>
colloidal particles, on glass substrate surfaces. As can be seen from the figures there<br>
are three kinds of deposits as results of evaporation under the above conditions. They<br>
are as follows:<br>
(a)	Single line deposits of materials along the TEM grid lines with thickness on the<br>
order of 6.01 microns. These lines have typical heights on the order of 0.45<br>
microns on the substrate (glass) surface. (Figures 3A and 3B)<br>
(b)	Double line deposits of materials (with a spacing of 20 micron) along the TEM<br>
grid lines with thickness on the order of 2 micron or less. These lines have typical<br>
heights on the order of 1 micron. (Figure 5a)<br>
(c)	Plate -like continuous deposits of materials along the TEM grid lines with<br>
thickness on the order of 4 microns or less. These plates have typical heights on<br>
the order of 1 micron. (Figures8A, 8B.9A, 9B, 6)<br>
Example 6<br>
The, deposition of two layers of patterned materials one on top of the other is<br>
demonstrated as follows.<br>
The first layer of material (Au nanoparticles) is deposited on a glass slide as mentioned<br>
above using a TEM grid on top of a drop of an aqueous solution of AuNPs. When the<br>
deposited material is completely dried in 30 min (after removal of the grid) another drop<br>
of the same solution is again placed at the place where the original drop was there (that<br>
led to the formation of first grid patterns). A TEM grid is likewise placed on top of this<br>
drop followed by evaporation of the same. The process finally led to the formation of<br>
double-layered patterns where one layer of patterned deposits is placed on top of a<br>
previous layer of patterned deposits. The deposition of the first patterned layer is same<br>
(similar) as those described earlier.<br>
The deposition of the second patterned layer is typically thinner than the first layer. In<br>
other words, the lines corresponding to the patterned deposition are comparatively<br>
slimmer and height smaller with typical width of 0.8 micron. However, the patterns of the<br>
lines followed those of the TEM grid metal lines as with the first layer. The relative<br>
orientation and position of the lines of the first and second layers are decided by the<br>
12<br>
 <br>
relative orientation of the TEM grid at the time of the first layer deposition and that during<br>
the second layer. The details of the micrographs are shown in Figure 10.<br>
Example 7<br>
The present example demonstrates generation of patterned structures of CdS quantum<br>
dots on a substrate surface by reaction. A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is<br>
first cleaned by ethanol solution and then dried. Aqueous solutions of 1.1 x 10-4 M of<br>
CdCI2 and 0.01 M Na2S is prepared in Milli-Q water. A drop (20 uL) of an aqueous<br>
solution of CdCI2 is then placed onto the glass slide. A TEM copper / nickel grid is then<br>
placed carefully (using a pair of forceps) onto the drop such that the grid stays on the<br>
drop. A schematic view of the method of pattern generation is shown in Figure 2. The<br>
drop along with the TEM grid is then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30 min. The grid is<br>
then lifted after 30 min using a pair of forceps such that the structures imprinted on the<br>
slide is minimally disturbed. Then, a drop (20 uL) of an aqueous solution of Na2S is<br>
placed on the patterned structures of CdCI2. CdS quantum dots are produced at the<br>
overlapping regions where reaction occurs between them. The structure imprinted on the<br>
slide is then investigated using optical microscopy. The details of the micrographs are<br>
shown in Figure 11.<br>
Example 8<br>
This example demonstrates generation of patterned structures using two grids together.<br>
A glass microscope slide of size 1 cm x 1 cm is first cleaned by ethanol solution and<br>
then dried. A droplet of an aqueous solution containing the colloidal particles (Au NPs or<br>
and any other solute/dispersed particles) is placed on the glass slide. Two TEM copper /<br>
nickel grids attached to each other such that their grid lines are at an angle, are then<br>
placed carefully onto the drop such that the grids hold their position on the drop. A<br>
schematic view of the method of pattern generation is similar to the one shown in Figure<br>
2. The drop along with the two TEM grids is then left to evaporate at 300°C for 30 min.<br>
The grids are then lifted after 30 min such that the structures imprinted on the slide is<br>
minimally disturbed. The structure imprinted on the slide is then investigated using<br>
optical microscopy. The details of the micrographs are shown in Figure 12.<br>

The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	The present invention is simplel in generating highly reproducible predetermined<br>
patterned deposits with the help of natural forces (capillary forces) only. The method<br>
does not require any additional physical force such as light (photolithography), pressure<br>
on the mold (soft lithography), high energy electrons (electron beam lithography), ions<br>
(ion beam lithography) etc.<br>
2.	It provides patterned deposits, of molecular, nanoscale and microscale materials, on a<br>
substrate surface with the resultant assembly of the precursor materials.<br>
3.	The patterns can be controlled by controlling the dimensions of the TEM grid. The<br>
sizes of the grid lines and holes and the nature of the patterns that makes up the grid<br>
guide the pattern that is deposited on the substrate surface.<br>
4.	The dimensions of the deposited patterns are scalable and thus the method has<br>
unique advantage.<br>
5.	The method allows layer-by-layer patterned depositions of materials, where the<br>
resulting depositions could be made of same or two different materials that allow<br>
combination of patterned depositions.<br>
6.	The method offers depositions of two reactive agents one after the other where the<br>
product of the reaction results in the formation of specific depositions at the intersections<br>
of the deposition in the case of two-layer depositions.<br>
