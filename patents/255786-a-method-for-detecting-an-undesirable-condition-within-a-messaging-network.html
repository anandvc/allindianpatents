DUAL USE COUNTERS FOR ROUTING LOOPS<br>
AND SPAM DETECTION<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to detection of suspicious traffic<br>
patterns over a network. More specifically, the present invention relates to such<br>
detection in wireless messaging networks based, for example, on source and<br>
destination addresses and/or timing.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]	Spam is a problem that plagues much of today's communications<br>
networks and, particularly, telecommunications networks. As used herein,<br>
"spam' includes mass messaging from one or a small set of origination numbers<br>
associated with wireless devices, such as mobile telephones, that frequently<br>
contain unwanted or otherwise undesirable content. Spam often takes the form<br>
of an unusually large number of messages, from a single source address to<br>
multiple recipients, and may be caused by applications that send messages to a<br>
wireless network via a telephone handset connected to a computer or wireless<br>
modem. In addition, spam may be defined as a large number of messages sent<br>
from a single source to a single destination address with no corresponding<br>
messages in the reverse direction. While not strictly considered spam in the<br><br>
traditional meaning, this may constitute, for example, a denial-of-service-like<br>
misuse of the messaging network that a carrier may want to be alerted to, or, it<br>
may also indicate an undesirable "routing loop".<br>
0003]	As used herein, the term "routing loop" refers to a situation whereby one<br>
carrier, e.g., a mobile telephone network provider, recognizes a number as being<br>
out of its system and forwards the call or message associated with that number to<br>
another network, or an intermediary that logically bridges different networks.<br>
The intermediary (or other network), however, recognizes the number as<br>
belonging to the original carrier's system and sends the message back. This<br>
routing and re-routing can continue indefinitely.<br>
[0004]	Undesirable looping can often occur in the context of number portability<br>
(NP), whereby two entities, e.g., a wireless carrier and an inter-carrier vendor, in<br><br>
a message exchange environment have, at a given moment in time, different<br>
routing information for a specific telephone number For example, the inter-<br>
carrier vendor may have received and processed a notification of a porting event<br>
for a telephone number via a real-time porting/pooling data feed, but the wireless<br>
carrier has, for any number of reasons, not yet updated its local routing<br>
information to reflect the notification. This conflict can result in the above-<br>
described message or routing loop.<br>
[0005]	In such a circumstance, the carrier will determine (incorrectly) that, for<br>
example, a Short Message Service (SMS) message that is addressed to a<br>
telephone number is outside of its network and will, accordingly, pass the<br>
message to the inter-carrier vendor for delivery. The vendor (or intermediary)<br>
will determine (correctly) that the telephone number has been ported to the<br>
carrier and should thus be serviced by that carrier and will, accordingly, return<br>
the message to the carrier for delivery. The message will then be bounced back<br>
and forth indefinitely without ever being sent to the intended recipient.<br>
[0006]	Both spam and routing loops create problems for carriers and customers<br>
alike. It would be desirable to identify, reduce and possibly even eliminate spam<br>
and routing loops within communication networks. This would be especially<br>
desirable within wireless communication networks that handle data such as SMS<br>
messages.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	The present invention relates, in one exemplary embodiment, to a method<br>
for detecting undesirable conditions within a messaging network. The method<br>
comprises receiving a message and identifying a source of the message. If an<br>
entry in a database for the source has not been created, an entry is created in the<br>
database for the source. A source counter for the source is set to one and a<br>
timestamp is created for the source. If an entry in the database for the source has<br>
been previously created, the source counter is incremented by one and the<br>
timestamp is updated. The source counter is then compared to a source<br>
threshold for a predetermined time period, and if the source counter exceeds the<br>
source threshold, a source alarm is triggered.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014]	In a preferred embodiment, the present invention monitors on-going<br>
message traffic between mobile communication subscribers in an effort to<br>
recognize patterns that may constitute spam, as defined above, or indicate a<br>
routing loop where a message is sent back and forth endlessly between two parts<br>
of a network or between networks. One of ordinary skill in the art will<br><br>
appreciate that the present invention should not be limited only to traffic<br>
between mobile communication subscribers, but could also apply to any network<br>
in which spam or routing loops may occur. By monitoring a network in<br>
accordance with principles consistent with those of nine present invention, the<br>
presence of such undesirable situations may be more quickly identified, and thus<br>
more quickly remedied.<br>
[0015]	At its most basic level, the present invention endeavors to track source<br>
and destination numbers (e.g., telephone numbers or addresses) of all messages<br>
flowing between two networks, or within a single network in an appropriate<br>
manner for a time window of fixed size. In a preferred embodiment, a database<br><br>
or other memory store, stores the number of messages sent by a specific source<br>
address and a timestamp denoting the creation time of a given instance. When a<br>
message passes through the system, an appropriate data structure is created in the<br>
database (if not already present for a particular source address) and a counter is<br><br>
incremented, the counter being indicative of the number of messages sent from<br>
that particular source address.<br>
[0016]	This process is shown in Figure 1. Initially, a new message (e.g., an<br>
SMS from a mobile phone) is created at step 100 and sent from location A to<br>
location B. At step 110, the system checks whether an entry is present in the<br>
database for the originator, A. If an entry is not present then at step 120, a new<br>
entry is created with a counter set at one and a timestamp is created. If an entry<br><br>
is already present, then at step 130 the counter is incremented and the time stamp<br>
is updated. Once the counter and timestamp are updated a check with respect to<br>
a threshold is performed at step 140. If the counter value reaches or exceeds<br>
(depending on the setting) the threshold, then an alarm is sounded at step 150.<br>
If, however, the threshold has not been crossed, the system waits for the next<br>
message to be sent within the network or between networks.<br>
[0017]	With the counter and timestamp information, it is possible in accordance<br>
with the present invention to implement an efficient "jumping window" of fixed<br>
size by using a garbage collection method that removes all entries older than a<br>
fixed window size in regular intervals. For example, if thirty minutes have<br>
passed and the threshold has not been met, then the data collected during that<br>
thirty minute jumping window is discarded and the process starts anew. This<br>
solution has an advantage of being very efficient because the garbage collector<br>
routine needs only to compare one integer value (e.g., number of messages) per<br>
time period to determine whether to remove message history data or not. One<br>
disadvantage of this methodology lies in the nature of the fixed jumping<br>
window. It may be possible that a flurry of messages is sent in its entirety from<br>
a single source address that exceeds the identified spam threshold, but is sent,<br>
temporally, with respect to garbage collection, in such a way that two parts of<br>
the flurry each remain below the threshold or detection level.<br><br>
[0018]	This situation is shown in Figure 2, wherein fifteen messages are<br>
depicted as being sent within, approximately, a seven minute period. Later,<br>
thirty more messages are depicted as being sent over the last fifteen minutes of<br>
the half hour. If the threshold were set to be fifty messages within a half hour, a<br>
typical system would not sound an alarm because garbage collection would be<br>
set to occur every half hour, thus wiping out all counter information during that<br><br>
period. At the beginning of the next half hour, another thirty messages are<br>
depicted as being sent over the first fifteen minutes. Because the garbage<br>
collection occurred at the thirty-minute mark, the system does not detect this as a<br>
spam instance even though, as is shown, sixty messages were sent in a thirty<br>
minute period. In essence, the fixed jumping window split in half what would<br>
otherwise have been detected as a spam instance thereby allowing the event to<br>
go undetected. Table 1 is illustrative of the garbage collection utilizing a fixed<br>
window.	<br><br>
[0020]	As can be seen in Table 1, when the window is fixed, an undesirable<br>
instance of message accumulation, or spam, occurs because the arrival of<br>
messages spans across two windows. To ensure that an alarm is sounded and<br>
such a spam instance is detected, a sliding window is preferably implemented.<br>
This sliding window is implemented with a more elaborate data structure in<br>
which the time stamp is replaced by a sorted array (or comparable data structure)<br>
of timestamps, one for each counter increment. The garbage collector removes<br>
all entries from this array that are older than the fixed window size, and<br>
decrements the counter accordingly. In this manner, only if the counter reaches<br>
zero is the complete data structure removed from the hash table.<br>
. [0021]	A refined solution could therefore implement "rolling" window. This<br>
requires a more elaborate data structure in which the timestamp and counter are<br>
replaced by a container of timestamps - e.g., a First-In First-Out (FIFO) queue or<br><br>
other comparable structure. The garbage collector removes all entries from this<br><br>
container that are older than the fixed window size. Only if the last element is<br>
removed from the container is the container itself removed from the hash table.<br>
This enhanced spam detection using a sliding or rolling window is shown in<br><br>
[0023]	With this sliding method, a slight performance penalty is encountered<br>
due to the relative complexity of an array search and the related counter<br>
decrement versus a simple integer comparison and periodic garbage collection.<br>
A more significant increase in memory space would also occur. The garbage<br>
collection process depicted in Table 2 is shown in Figure 3. As shown, at step<br><br>
300 the next queue is obtained. The 'queue', as used herein, represents the data<br>
structure that contains or houses the dynamically-changing set of individual<br>
entries, each individual entry representing those (SMS) messages that had been<br>
observed as originating from a particular source (A, B, ...). The garbage<br>
collection routine, an exemplary embodiment of which is shown in Figure 3,<br>
would iterate through the entries in the queue to access all of the<br>
counters/timestamps as it completes its work. Next, at step 310 the time stamp<br>
associated with the queue is also obtained. The timestamp is then checked at<br><br>
step 320 to see if it falls within or outside of the predetermined window size. If<br><br>
the timestamp is outside of the window size, then that timestamp is removed at<br>
step 330. Otherwise, the procedure returns to step 300 to get the next queue.<br><br>
Because, however, the array of timestamps is always sorted, very efficient<br>
methods of array manipulation can be applied. In order to achieve this result,<br>
often a significant increase in memory space must be taken into consideration.<br>
[0024]	In a mobile telephone network environment that supports number<br>
portability, a user of one carrier is able to take his/her current phone number and<br>
use it in another carrier's network so as to avoid changing phone numbers in<br>
order to change carriers. Previously, carriers received a dedicated block of<br><br>
phone numbers making it easy for their systems to detect what numbers were<br>
part of their network and what numbers were outside of their network. Now,<br>
however, users have the ability to take their number from one carrier to the next,<br>
thus simplifying, on the user end, a change from one carrier to the other. As<br>
mentioned above, however, this number portability can create numerous<br>
problems for carriers.<br>
[0025]	In a number portability situation, User Y (referring to Figure 4) has taken<br>
its number from its original carrier, Carrier 2, to a new carrier, Carrier 1. As<br>
seen in Figure 4, when User X, who is also with Carrier I, sends a message to<br>
User Y, newly added to Carrier 1, for any of a number of reasons, Carrier 1<br>
recognizes User Y (incorrectly) as being outside of its network. Carrier 1 then<br>
sends the message to an intermediary 1 for translation of the message to ensure<br>
proper transmission between carriers. Intermediary subsequently recognizes<br>
(correctly) that User Y is, in fact, part of Carrier network and sends the<br>
message back to Carrier 1 to send to User Y. This routing and re-routing will<br>
continue indefinitely due to the discrepancy between the information the carriers<br>
and intermediary have regarding User Y. This discrepancy results in a routing<br>
loop. If neither Intermediary I nor Carrier 1 has a mechanism to prevent sending<br>
messages back to the originating network, the message will stay in this routing<br>
loop indefinitely, or until some timer expires, and will never actually reach its<br>
destination.<br>
[0026]	In order to detect routing loops or excessive messaging between a single<br>
source and a destination, additional information needs to be tracked. Instead of<br>
incrementing a single counter per source address, the data structure for each<br>
source address is preferably also configured to contain separate counters for each<br>
destination address. To this end, the previously defined data structure can be<br><br>
modified to contain a hash table, or similarly indexed "container" for holding<br>
data structures of the same type, indexed by destination address. This allows the<br><br>
system to track more than just the total amount of messages from the source<br>
address. The modified tracking method is shown in Figure 5.<br>
[0027]	As seen in Figure 5, a new message is sent from location X to location Y<br>
using a phone number shown at step 200. As with the method of Figure 2, the<br>
system checks to see if an entry has been created for X at step 210. If it has not,<br>
then at step 220, a new entry is created with index X and with the counter set at<br><br>
one. Because this is a new entry for X, it can be assumed that no sub-entry has<br><br>
been created for Y, so at step 240, a new sub-entry is created with index Y. If an<br>
entry is present, however, rather than incrementing the counter at this time, the<br>
system checks if a sub-entry under X's main entry is present for Y at step 230.<br>
If a sub-entry for Y is not present, then at step 240 a new sub-entry for Y is<br>
created with the counter set to one. If a sub-entry fcr Y is present, then the<br>
counter is incremented and the time stamp updated at step 250. At this point, the<br>
counter is compared to a threshold at step 260 and, if the counter is greater than<br><br>
the threshold, an alarm is sounded at step 270. If the threshold is not met, then<br>
the system waits for the next message without sounding an alarm.<br>
[0028]	By adding this additional data, the monitoring mechanism of the present<br>
invention can be refined in several ways. First, different thresholds may be<br>
configured for a total number of messages per window and number of messages<br>
per destination address and window. Second, the alarm based on the total<br>
number of messages may contain a detailed breakdown of the different<br><br>
destination addresses and the associated message counts.<br><br>
[0029]	If the network into which this spam/routing loop detection method is to<br>
be introduced is of a distributed nature, there may be no single point through<br>
which all messages must pass. In such a situation there are at least two<br>
solutions. First, processes on separate hardware throughout the network may use<br>
a shared device, such as a solid-state disk, as the storage medium for all in-<br><br>
memory data structures. While this ensures an accurate count of message traffic<br>
through the network, it may significantly degrade performance compared to<br>
processes operating exclusively within local memory. This approach also may<br><br>
be impractical if the traffic is distributed over geographically separated<br>
networks.	<br>
[0030]	In a second solution to the distributed networks problem, thresholds<br>
defined in respect to the total amount of traffic passing through a network can be<br>
divided by the number of locations where the invention is deployed. For<br><br>
example, if one hundred messages per hour are defined as the threshold per<br>
source address, two processes with a threshold of fifty messages per hour may be<br>
configured. While this approach may lead to a number of false alarms if the<br>
traffic is not load-balanced based on source address, practice has shown that for<br><br>
reasonably high thresholds, the usual approach of round-robin load balancing is<br>
sufficient to ensure a close approximation of the shared memory model.<br>
[0031]	Because it is practically unavoidable that legitimate use of the messaging<br>
network will result in false alarms using the monitoring described above, the<br>
system may be configured to add certain source or destination addresses, or<br>
combinations thereof, to a "white list" that is held lip memory at all times.<br>
Messages that have a matching entry in the white list will not generate an alarm<br>
even if they exceed the configured thresholds. Similarly, source addresses<br>
known to be used for spam messages can be placed in a "black list" that will be<br>
used to discard any messages regardless of threshold from such addresses.<br>
[0032]	Fig 6 shows that the present invention relates to a system for detecting an<br>
undesirable condition within a messaging network, said system comprising of a<br>
receiver for receiving a message; said receiver is coupled to an extractor for<br>
identifying the source of the said message; the extractor being operatively linked<br>
to a memory device via a searching means for creating an entry for the source,<br>
setting a source counter for the source to one and creating a timestamp for the<br>
said source and if an entry for the source has not been created, incrementing the<br>
source counter by one and updating the timestamp; said memory is coupled to a<br>
comparator for comparing the source counter to a source threshold; and said<br>
comparator is coupled to an alarm, said alarm is trjiggered when the source<br>
counter exceeds the source threshold over the course of a predetermined amount<br>
of time indicative of an undesirable condition.	<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
"A METHOD FOR DETECTING AN UNDESIRABSLE CONDITION<br>
WITHIN A MESSAGING NETWORK"<br>
A method for detecting an undesirable condition within a messaging network. A message is<br>
received and a source of the message is identified. If an entry in a database for the source has<br>
not been created, an entry is created. A source counter for the source is then set to one and a<br><br>
timestamp is created for the source. If an entry in the database for the source has been<br>
previously created, the source counter is incremented by one and the timestamp is updated.<br>
The source counter is then compared to a source threshold, and if the source counter exceeds<br><br>
the source threshold over the course of predetermined amount of time, a source alarm is<br>
triggered. A sliding with respect to the predetermined amount of time may also be<br>
implemented to account for total counts that may fall across or be split by set periods of time.<br>
The invention is particularly useful for detecting 'spam' events and Undesirable routing loops.</td>
