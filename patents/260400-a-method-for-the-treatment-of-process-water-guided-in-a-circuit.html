				<td>System and method for the renovation of process water<br>
The present invention relates to a system for the treatment of process<br>
water, in particular for the treatment of process water in the manufacture<br>
of paper, wherein the system includes at least one process water<br>
treatment unit. The present invention furthermore relates to a method for<br>
the treatment of process water, in particular for the treatment of process<br>
water in the manufacture of paper.<br>
A preparation of process water is in particular necessary in a number of<br>
technical fields in cases where the process water is guided in the circuit in<br>
the corresponding system to prevent an enrichment of the process water<br>
with interfering substances. This also in particular applies to the process<br>
water in the manufacture of paper, and indeed both in the manufacture of<br>
paper from fresh fibers and in particular in the manufacture of paper from<br>
recovered paper.<br>
Over the past decades, paper has been increasingly obtained from<br>
recovered paper to lower energy consumption in the manufacture of paper<br>
and in particular to reduce consumption of natural resources. While<br>
around 2.2 metric tons (tonnes) of wood are required for the manufacture<br>
of a tonne of primary fiber paper, the wood requirements in paper<br>
recycling can be dramatically lowered or reduced to zero in dependence on<br>
the proportion of the secondary fibers originating from recovered paper<br>
with respect to the total fiber amount in the recycled paper. In addition,<br>
only half as much energy and only a third of the fresh water is required in<br>
the production of recycled paper in comparison with the manufacture of<br><br>
paper from primary fibers. The quality of recycled paper is today<br>
nevertheless as high as that of primary fiber papers with respect to ink<br>
hold-out, printing behavior, degree of whiteness and aging resistance.<br>
In the manufacture of paper from recovered paper, the recovered paper is<br>
first mixed with water and comminuted in a pulper or pulping engine<br>
while stirring and mixing to dissolve the individual fiber composites.<br>
Subsequently, a cleaning of the fibers takes place to remove non-fibrous<br>
foreign bodies from the fibrous pulp before the fibers are optionally<br>
whitened and are finally processed to paper on a paper making machine,<br>
optionally after addition of a small proportion of primary fibers. A<br>
corresponding system consequently includes an apparatus for the<br>
treatment of recovered paper and a paper making machine, with the<br>
recovered paper treatment apparatus comprising a recovered paper puling<br>
unit, i.e. a pulper, in which process water is supplied to the recovered<br>
paper for the pulping and comminution of the fibers, a sorting apparatus<br>
for the removal of impurities and a deckering unit for the removal of<br>
process water. It is also known to provide two or more recovered paper<br>
treatment apparatus or stages, so-called loops, in the system to increase<br>
the quality of the treated fibers from the recovered paper. Each loop of the<br>
recovered paper treatment apparatus and the paper making machine in<br>
this connection preferably include their own process water treatment unit,<br>
with the individual process water treatment units being able to be<br>
decoupled from one another by a deckering unit provided between the<br>
individual loops.<br>
To be able to guide the process water in every loop in the circuit and thus<br>
to be able to minimize the fresh water addition, the process water has to<br>
be cleaned to a required degree in the individual process water treatment<br>
units. For this purpose, the process water treatment units usually include<br><br>
a material recovery unit and/or a material removal unit in which fibers<br>
contained in the process water are mechanically separated from the<br>
process water to be led back in full or in part to the recovered paper<br>
treatment apparatus. These material recovery units or material removal<br>
units are usually designed as screening systems and/or as pressure relief<br>
flotation (dissolved air flotation) systems.<br>
A system for the manufacture of paper from recovered paper is known<br>
from DE 40 42 224 Al which includes a recovered paper treatment<br>
apparatus comprising a loop as well as a paper making machine. The<br>
recovered paper treatment apparatus includes a pulper into which<br>
recovered paper is introduced and is mixed with process water to repulp<br>
the old paper, a sorting stage which is provided downstream of the pulper<br>
and in which impurities are separated from the suspended pulp<br>
manufactured in the pulper, a thickening unit to remove the process<br>
water as much as possible from the suspended pulp, as well as a process<br>
water treatment unit to clean the process water. The process water<br>
treatment unit in turn substantially comprises a precleaning apparatus,<br>
an anaerobic purifying stage, for example including a UASB reactor, as<br>
well as an aerobic purifying stage. The process water purified in the<br>
process water treatment unit can either be disposed of as waste water or,<br>
in accordance with another embodiment, can be guided back into the<br>
pulper as repulping water in part and into the paper making machine in<br>
part, with in this case a part flow of white water from the paper making<br>
machine being added to the process water guided through the process<br>
water treatment unit of the recovered paper treatment apparatus.<br>
The process water circuits of the paper making machine and of the<br>
process water treatment unit are thus not completely decoupled from one<br>
another in this system so that the quality of the process water in the<br><br>
paper making machine and the quality of the process water in the<br>
recovered paper treatment apparatus cannot be controlled efficiently and<br>
independently of one another. A further disadvantage of the last-named<br>
embodiment is that a high water hardness is adopted in the process water<br>
due to the partial circuit guidance and this water hardness can disturb<br>
the operation of the anaerobic UASB reactor. Microorganisms are namely<br>
used in anaerobic reactors for whose function it is important that they<br>
have a defined specific weight to be able to rise to the top in the reactor to<br>
separate the biogas formed at a gas separator during the degradation of<br>
the organic compounds from the process water due to the biogas which is<br>
formed in this process and which adheres to the microorganism pellets.<br>
After separation of the biogas, the specific weight may in particular not<br>
become so large that the microorganism pellets drop to the bottom of the<br>
reactor since they can otherwise no longer take part in the purification<br>
process. Due to their structure and size, however, microorganisms act as<br>
crystallization nuclei for lime deposits so that lime is deposited onto the<br>
microorganism pellets at a specific water hardness and at corresponding<br>
pH values, with these deposits resulting in an incalculable shift in the<br>
specific weight of the pellets so that they can no longer take over their<br>
function. The metabolic activity of the anaerobic microorganisms also<br>
causes a shift in the lime/carbon dioxide balance due to the generation of<br>
hydrogen carbonate (HCO3-) among other things, which further promotes a<br>
lime precipitation onto the microorganism pellets. In order to ensure the<br>
function of the micropellets despite the lime precipitation thereon, the<br>
recirculation amounts in the anaerobic reactor would have to be increased<br>
to keep the pellets in suspension in the reactor despite their larger specific<br>
weight. However, the recirculation amount is subject to limits by the<br>
hydraulic capacity of the separators, on the one hand, and by the<br>
necessity of keeping the flow in the reactor laminar, on the other hand.<br>
Higher recirculation amounts moreover cause the escape of carbon dioxide<br><br>
and thereby a further shift of the lime/carbon dioxide balance in the<br>
direction of lime precipitation due to the arising of pressure gradients at<br>
the suction and pressure side of the pump in the recirculation line.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a system for<br>
the treatment of process water as well as a corresponding method,<br>
wherein the process water is purified efficiently, wherein in particular the<br>
water hardness and the quality of the process water can be directly<br>
controlled and which is also in particular suitable for the treatment of<br>
process water having a high water hardness such as process water in a<br>
system for the manufacture of paper from recovered paper. The treated<br>
water should in particular be purified such that a disturbance of the<br>
operation of an aerobic reactor due to lime precipitation phenomena can<br>
be reliably avoided.<br>
This object is satisfied in accordance with the invention by a system in<br>
accordance with claim 1 and in particular by a system including at least<br>
one process water treatment unit, with at least one of the process water<br>
treatment units comprising an anaerobic reactor mixed with anaerobic<br>
microorganisms as well as a lime elimination unit.<br>
Since the at least one of the process water treatment units includes an<br>
anaerobic reactor mixed with anaerobic microorganisms, the impurities<br>
contained in the process water, in particular the organic and biological<br>
impurities, can be removed efficiently. Due to the purity thereby achieved,<br>
the process water can be guided completely or at least almost completely<br>
in the circuit without the impurities being enriched by the circuit<br>
guidance. This allows a minimization of the fresh water requirements of<br>
the system. Since the process water treatment unit includes a lime<br>
elimination unit in addition to the anaerobic reactor, the water hardness<br><br>
in the process water guided in the circuit can moreover be controlled such<br>
that no lime depositions which disturb the microorganisms contained in<br>
the anaerobic reactor arise in the anaerobic reactor, whereby the efficiency<br>
of the anaerobic reactor is optimized. Overall, the system in accordance<br>
with the invention thus makes possible an at least almost complete circuit<br>
guidance of the process water and the efficient control of the quality of the<br>
process water. A further advantage of the system in accordance with the<br>
invention can be found in the fact that the anaerobically treated process<br>
water is charged with anaerobic microorganisms which cannot survive, or<br>
which cannot survive in an appreciable amount, in an aerobic<br>
environment such as is present in the process stages and in the<br>
containers of the water treatment, for example, so that a growth of<br>
microorganisms on the corresponding system parts such as occurs in<br>
systems having reactors including aerobic microorganisms can be reliably<br>
prevented.<br>
The process water treatment system in accordance with the present<br>
invention can generally be integrated in any system in which process<br>
water is guided in the circuit. In particular in the manufacture of paper,<br>
the process water is polluted with significant amounts of impurities so<br>
that the system in accordance with the invention is in particular suitable<br>
for the cleaning of process water arising in the manufacture of paper,<br>
independently of whether it is process water of a system for the<br>
manufacture of paper from fresh fibers or process water of a system for<br>
the manufacture of paper from recovered paper.<br>
In this case, the system in accordance with the invention includes, in<br>
addition to at least one process water treatment unit, at least one material<br>
preparation apparatus and/or at least one paper making machine, with at<br>
least one of the process water treatments units comprising an anaerobic<br><br>
reactor mixed with anaerobic microorganisms as well as a lime elimination<br>
unit being associated with the at least one material preparation apparatus<br>
and/or the least one paper making machine.<br>
In particular when the system in accordance with the invention is a<br>
system for the manufacture of paper from recovered paper, it preferably<br>
has a recovered paper treatment apparatus as a material preparation<br>
apparatus for the manufacture of fiber material from the recovered paper<br>
and/or a paper making machine for the manufacture of paper from the<br>
pulp, with the recovered paper apparatus having one or more stages and<br>
at least one of these stages and/or the paper making machine including<br>
their own process water treatment unit, with the at least one of the<br>
process water treatment units including an anaerobic reactor mixed with<br>
anaerobic microorganisms as well as a lime elimination unit. In particular<br>
when the paper making machine and every stage or every loop of the<br>
recovered paper treatment apparatus include a process water treatment<br>
unit comprising an anaerobic reactor as well as a lime elimination unit,<br>
the process water quality, that is the amount of impurities contained in<br>
the process water, can be controlled separately for each loop. An optimum<br>
quality water management is thereby made possible in the manufacture of<br>
paper from recovered paper.<br>
To achieve an efficient use of the recovered paper used in the system as<br>
well as of the fibers included therein, it is proposed in a further<br>
development of the idea of the invention furthermore to provide a material<br>
recovery unit and/or a material removal unit in the at least one process<br>
treatment unit. Good results are in particular achieved when the material<br>
recovery unit or the material removal unit is made as a combination of a<br>
material recovery apparatus (e.g. an apparatus with a screen barrier) and<br>
a microflotation apparatus (or pressure relief flotation apparatus) in series<br><br>
as a cascade. In the first stage, which is preferably made as a spray<br>
filtration, the useful fibers are recovered, whereas in the second stage,<br>
namely the material removal, the fine materials are removed from the<br>
process water.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred embodiment, the at least one<br>
process water treatment unit furthermore includes a filtration unit to<br>
separate the solid particles contained in the process water. This filtration<br>
unit is preferably arranged downstream of the lime elimination unit as<br>
well as downstream of the anaerobic reactor.<br>
The lime elimination unit can generally be arranged in the at least one<br>
process water treatment unit upstream or downstream of the anaerobic<br>
reactor. Since the mass freight, i.e. the concentration of solids in the<br>
process water, is lower downstream of the anaerobic reactor than<br>
upstream of the anaerobic reactor, the arrangement of the lime<br>
elimination unit downstream of the anaerobic reactor is advantageous, in<br>
particular with paper manufacturing systems with which graph papers are<br>
manufactured. The arrangement of the lime elimination unit upstream of<br>
the anaerobic reaction, in contrast, is in particular sensible with<br>
corresponding systems when a high number of fibers are contained in the<br>
process water and the fibers should be returned after the material<br>
separation. In the preferred embodiment, in which the at least one process<br>
water treatment unit includes a material recovery unit made as a<br>
microflotation apparatus or as a pressure relief flotation apparatus and/or<br>
a material removal unit, the lime elimination unit is also preferably<br>
arranged treatment of the anaerobic reactor in the at least one process<br>
water preparation unit since the lime elimination unit can then be<br>
combined in one apparatus with the microflotation apparatus or pressure<br>
relief flotation apparatus.<br><br>
Particularly good results are in particular also achieved with respect to the<br>
removal of impurities from the process water when the lime elimination<br>
unit of the at least one process water treatment unit is a pressure relief<br>
flotation apparatus. With pressure relief flotation, the process water to be<br>
treated is preferably first set to a neutral or alkaline pH suitable for lime<br>
formation by the addition of a pH setting agent, for example sodium lye,<br>
said pH preferably being between 7 and 10, particularly preferably<br>
between 7 and 9, and very particularly preferably between 7.5 and 8.5.<br>
Optionally, precipitant and/or a flocculation aid can be mixed with the<br>
water to promote lime formation. Subsequently, pressure gas, preferably<br>
compressed air, is added to the mixture produced in this manner and this<br>
mixture is pressurized before the pressurized mixture is expanded or<br>
exposed to a reduced pressure in a pressure relief flotation reactor,<br>
whereby the previously added pressure gas fizzes out of the water at least<br>
very largely in the form of gas bubbles and flows upward. In this<br>
connection, the gas bubbles take along the lime floes contained in the<br>
water so that they are separated from the water.<br>
To achieve an efficient lime separation, it is proposed in a further<br>
development of the idea of the invention to configure the pressure relief<br>
flotation apparatus such that the pressure difference between the<br>
pressurization and the expansion amounts to at least 2 bar, preferably at<br>
least 3 bar, particularly preferably at least 4 bar and very particularly<br>
preferably at least 5 bar. The greater the aforesaid pressure difference, the<br>
smaller the gas beads arising during the expansion so that an increased<br>
lime separation is achieved due to the larger surface to volume ratio of the<br>
gas bubbles.<br><br>
The pressure relief flotation apparatus preferably includes a precipitation<br>
device in which lime is precipitated from the process water by addition of a<br>
substance selected from the group including pH setting agents,<br>
precipitants, flocculation aids and any desired combinations thereof and a<br>
lime separation device in which precipitated lime is separated from the<br>
process water. For example, the precipitation device can include a pH<br>
setting device as well as a supply line for precipitant and/o a flocculation<br>
aid, whereas the lime separation device preferably comprises an admixture<br>
unit for pressure gas, a gas solution reactor for the physical solution of<br>
the pressure gas in the process water as well as a pressure relief flotation<br>
reactor.<br>
Alternatively to the aforesaid embodiment, the lime elimination can also<br>
take place after corresponding precipitation by means of centrifugal force,<br>
for example using a centrifuge or using a cyclone.<br>
To achieve a homogenous mixture of the process water with the substance<br>
selected from the group including pH setting agent, precipitants,<br>
flocculation aids and any desired combinations thereof in the aforesaid<br>
embodiment, the system in accordance with the invention preferably has a<br>
mixing unit for the homogeneous admixture of the aforesaid at least one<br>
substance.<br>
In the aforesaid embodiment, both the precipitation device and the lime<br>
separation device can be arranged downstream of the anaerobic reactor. It<br>
is, however, equally possible to provide the precipitation device and the<br>
lime separation device in each case upstream of the anaerobic reactor or<br>
to arrange the precipitation device downstream of the anaerobic reactor<br>
and to provide the lime separation device upstream of the anaerobic<br>
reactor, with in the last-named case a part flow line leading from the<br><br>
anaerobic reactor into the precipitation device from where the process<br>
water leaving the precipitation device is guided via a corresponding line<br>
into the lime separation device and with a bypass line leading from the<br>
anaerobic reactor past the precipitation device into the filtration unit. The<br>
last named embodiment is in particular advantageous with systems for<br>
the manufacture of tissue paper not containing any ash. In the two last-<br>
named embodiments, in which at least the lime separation device is<br>
arranged upstream of the anaerobic reactor, this lime separation device<br>
preferably made as a pressure relief flotation apparatus can be integrated<br>
in the material recovery unit preferably made as a microflotation<br>
apparatus and/or in the material removal unit.<br>
All types of anaerobic reactors known to the skilled person can be used as<br>
the anaerobic reactor mixed with anaerobic microorganisms, for example<br>
contact sludge reactors, UASB reactors, EGSB reactors, fixed bed reactors<br>
and fluidized bed reactors, with good results in particular being achieved<br>
with UASB reactors and ESGB reactors. A pre-acidification reactor can be<br>
connected before the anaerobic reactor and the process water is subjected<br>
to acidogenesis and/or hydrolysis in it before the supply into the<br>
anaerobic reactor. Whereas polymers such as polysaccharides,<br>
polypeptides and fats are degraded to their monomers such as sugar,<br>
amino acids and fatty acids during enzymatic hydrolysis by exoenzymes<br>
originating from microorganisms, these monomers are converted in the<br>
acidogenesis into organic acids, alcohols, aldehydes, hydrogen and carbon<br>
dioxide by acidogenic microorganisms.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the material preparation apparatus of<br>
the system includes one or more stages, with good results in particular<br>
being achieved with 1 to 3 material preparation stages, with the mutually<br>
individual stages preferably being decoupled from one another by a<br><br>
deckering stage. The material preparation apparatus particularly<br>
preferably includes two mutually decoupled stages. In the case of a system<br>
for the manufacture of paper from recovered paper, in which the material<br>
preparation apparatus is designed as a recovered paper treatment<br>
apparatus, the material preparation stage(s) is/are made as recovered<br>
paper treatment stages.<br>
Independently of the number of the stages of the material preparation<br>
apparatus, provision is made in accordance with a further preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention that, in a system for the preparation<br>
of paper, both at least one of the stages of the material preparation<br>
apparatus and the paper making machine each include their own process<br>
water treatment unit, with the individual process water treatment units<br>
each having an anaerobic reactor as well as a lime elimination unit.<br>
It is proposed in a further development of the idea of the invention that all<br>
the stages of the material preparation apparatus and the paper making<br>
machine each include their own process water treatment unit, with the<br>
individual process water treatment units each having an anaerobic reactor<br>
as well as a lime elimination unit. Since the paper making machine and<br>
every stage or every loop of the material preparation apparatus include a<br>
process water treatment unit comprising an anaerobic reactor as well as a<br>
lime elimination unit, the process water quality, that is the amount of<br>
impurities contained in the process water, can be controlled separately for<br>
each loop. An optimum quality water management is thereby made<br>
possible in the manufacture of paper.<br>
The system in accordance with the invention furthermore preferably<br>
includes a waste water purification apparatus via which some of the<br><br>
process water guided in the circuit is purified and is drained out of the<br>
system to replace this portion with fresh water.<br>
In this connection, the waste water purification apparatus can include one<br>
or more devices which are selected from the group including material<br>
removal units, cooling units, biological waste water treatment units and<br>
any desired combinations thereof.<br>
In the aforesaid embodiment, a part flow line is preferably provided in the<br>
system leading back from the waste water purification apparatus into the<br>
material preparation apparatus and/or into the paper making machine.<br>
A further subject of the present invention is a method for the treatment of<br>
process water, in particular for the treatment of process water in the<br>
manufacture of paper, comprising at least one process water treatment<br>
step, with at least some of the process water continuously supplied to the<br>
process water treatment step being subjected to a purifying step in an<br>
anaerobic reactor mixed with anaerobic microorganisms as well as a<br>
deliming step.<br>
The process water continuously supplied to the process water treatment<br>
step preferably comes from a material preparation apparatus, for example<br>
from a recovered paper treatment apparatus and/or from a paper making<br>
machine.<br>
It is proposed in a further development of the idea of the invention to<br>
subject the process water to a pressure relief flotation step in the deliming<br>
step.<br><br>
In the aforesaid embodiment, the pressure difference between the<br>
pressurization and the expansion in the pressure relief flotation step<br>
preferably amounts to at least 2 bar, particularly preferably at least 3 bar,<br>
very particularly preferably at least 4 bar and most preferably at least 5<br>
bar.<br>
The method in accordance with the invention is preferably carried out in<br>
the previously described system in accordance with the invention.<br>
The present invention will be described in the following purely by way of<br>
example with reference to advantageous embodiments and to the enclosed<br>
drawings.<br>

The first stage 101a of the paper treatment apparatus 100 includes a raw<br>
material inlet 102, a pulper or pulping engine 105, a sorting device 110a<br>
as well as a deckering unit 115a which are arranged sequentially and are<br>
each connected to one another. In the sense of the present invention, a<br>
pulper or pulping engine 105 is not only understood as a device, as shown<br>
schematicalry in Fig. 1, consisting of an apparatus part, but rather in<br>
particular also as an apparatus combination which includes a plurality of<br>
individual apparatus parts and which contains all the components or<br>
units required for the pulping. The same also applies to the sorting device<br>
110a , the deckering unit 115a and all the other components shown in<br>
Fig. 1.<br>
The pulping engine 105 and the sorting device 110a are each connected to<br>
a reject treatment unit 118a via a line.<br>
The first stage 101a of the recovered paper treatment apparatus 100<br>
moreover includes a process water treatment unit 116a to which there is<br>
supplied via corresponding lines from the reject treatment unit 118a, from<br>
the sorting apparatus 110a as well as from the deckering unit 115a the<br>
process water arising in these system parts. In this connection, the sorting<br>
apparatus 110a can also include a series of sorting devices (not shown).<br>
The process water treatment unit 116a consists of a material recovery unit<br>
120a, an anaerobic reactor 125a mixed with anaerobic microorganisms, a<br>
lime elimination unit 130a as well as a filtration unit 140a which are<br>
arranged sequentially and are connected to one another. A return line<br><br>
145a leads back from the filtration unit 140a to the pulping engine 105. In<br>
addition to the material recovery unit 120a or instead of the material<br>
recovery unit 120a, a material removal unit (not shown) can be provided<br>
in the recovered paper treatment apparatus 100.<br>
Unlike the first stage 101a, the second stage 101b of the recovered paper<br>
treatment apparatus 100 includes a sorting apparatus 110b connected to<br>
the deckering unit 115a, an oxidation unit or reduction unit 112 as well<br>
as a deckering unit 115b which are arranged sequentially and are<br>
connected to one another. In addition, the second stage 101b has a<br>
process water treatment unit 116b which is made analog to the process<br>
water treatment unit 116a of the first stage 101a, with the filtration unit<br>
140b of the second stage 101b of the recovered paper treatment apparatus<br>
100 being connected via a return line 145b to the sorting apparatus 110b<br>
and via a part flow line 170a to the return line 145a of the first stage 101a<br>
of the recovered paper treatment apparatus 100 coming from the filtration<br>
unit 140a. While the sorting apparatus 110b and the oxidation unit or<br>
reduction unit 112 are connected via corresponding lines to a reject<br>
treatment unit 118b, the deckering unit 115b is connected directly to the<br>
material recovery unit 120b of the process water treatment unit 116b. In<br>
addition, a line leads from the oxidation unit or reduction unit 112 to the<br>
material recovery unit 120b.<br>
The paper making machine 200 includes a centrifugal sorter 202, a fine<br>
sorting apparatus 204, a paper making machine shaping part 206, a<br>
paper making machine pressing part 208 as well as a drying part 210<br>
which are arranged sequentially and are connected to one another. The<br>
centrifugal sorter 202 and the fine sorting apparatus 204 are connected to<br>
a reject treatment unit 212 and the paper making machine shaping part<br>
206 and the paper making machine pressing party 208 are connected to a<br><br>
In the operation of the system, recovered paper is continuously introduced<br>
via the raw material inlet 102 into the pulping engine 105 of the first stage<br>
101a of the recovered paper treatment apparatus 100 in that the<br>
recovered paper is mixed with process water supplied via the return line<br>
145a and is comminuted for the recovery of the fibers. Whereas the fibers<br>
recovered in the pulping engine 105 are continuously moved into the<br>
sorting apparatus 110a as a fiber suspension, the process water which<br>
arises in the pulping engine 105 and can include residues of fibers is first<br>
guided into the reject treatment unit 118a and from there, after separation<br>
of the rejects, into the material recovery unit 120a of the process water<br>
preparation unit 116a of the recovered paper apparatus 100. In the<br>
sorting apparatus 110a, light or heavy non-belonging parts which are<br>
larger than fibers, such as coarse impurities in the form of plastic foils<br>
and plastic pieces are sorted from the fiber suspension, for example by<br>
screen barriers and typically in multiple stages. In addition, a flotation can<br>
also be carried out in the sorting apparatus for the purpose of the<br>
elimination of pigments, ink and dye particles (de-inking). In addition, fine<br>
materials and ash can be separated in the material wash. The fiber<br>
suspension is thickened by the removal of process water in the deckering<br>
unit 115a, which is arranged downstream of the sorting apparatus 110a<br>
and which is preferably made as a deckering filter and/or as a screw<br>
press, to move as a thickened fiber suspension from the deckering unit<br>
115a into the sorting apparatus 110b of the second stage 101b of the<br>
recovered paper treatment apparatus 100. A part flow of the process water<br>
arising in the sorting apparatus 110a is guided into the reject treatment<br>
unit 118a, whereas the other part flow of the process water rising in the<br>
sorting apparatus 110a, together with the process water arising in the<br>
deckering unit 115a of the first stage 101a, is guided directly via<br>
corresponding lines into the material recovery unit 120a of the process<br><br>
water treatment unit 116a of the first stage 101a of the recovered paper<br>
treatment apparatus 100 in which pulp from the process water contained<br>
therein is separated which is again supplied to the treatment process. The<br>
material recovery unit 120a is preferably designed as a pressure relief<br>
flotation apparatus.<br>
Alternatively to this, a part flow of the process water removed from the<br>
deckering unit 115a or the total process water removed from the deckering<br>
unit 115a can be led back directly into the pulping engine 105, i.e. while<br>
bypassing the process water treatment unit 116a. In particular in the<br>
treatment of paper in which the process water has a low solid<br>
concentration, such as in the manufacture of graph paper, the material<br>
recovery unit 120a, 120b or the material removal unit 122, 220 can be<br>
omitted.<br>
In the system shown in Fig. 1, the process water arising in the reject<br>
treatment unit 118a is led into the material recovery unit 120a.<br>
Alternatively to this, however, it is also possible to drain off the process<br>
water arising in the reject treatment unit 118a as waste water from the<br>
recovered paper treatment apparatus 101a and, for example, to guide it<br>
via the waste water line 300 into the mechanical material removal unit<br>
305 and subsequently through the cooling unit 310 and the biological<br>
waste water cleaning unit 315.<br>
Process water liberated of pulp is guided continuously from the material<br>
recovery unit 120a into the anaerobic reactor 125a mixed with anaerobic<br>
microorganisms in which chemical and biological impurities are degraded<br>
by the effect of the anaerobic microorganisms in the process water. In this<br>
connection, a cooling stage (not shown) and a pre-acidification reactor (not<br>
shown), in which the process water is subjected to acidogenesis and/or<br><br>
hydrolysis, can be connected before the anaerobic reactor 125a for the<br>
purpose of setting the process water to an optimum temperature range.<br>
The process water liberated in this manner from the chemical and<br>
biological impurities is led from the anaerobic reactor 125a into the lime<br>
elimination unit 130a which is disposed downstream and which is<br>
preferably made as a pressure relief flotation apparatus. The carbonates<br>
and hydrogen carbonates present in the process water are very largely<br>
precipitated as lime and removed from the process water in this lime<br>
elimination unit 130a. In addition, a so-called "flash oxidation" takes place<br>
in the lime elimination unit 130a in which metabolic end products of the<br>
microorganisms formed in the anaerobic reactor 125a are oxidized by the<br>
supplied dissolved air or by air oversaturation, whereby an additional<br>
oxidative degradation of the impurities and/or disturbing materials<br>
contained in the process water takes place and an odor emission is largely<br>
reduced. The lime precipitation takes place in this connection by shifting<br>
the lime/carbon dioxide balance, said lime precipitation being achieved by<br>
metering in suitable chemicals, in particular a pH setting agent by which<br>
the pH of the process water is set to a neutral or alkaline value which<br>
preferably amounts to between 7 and 10, particularly preferably between 7<br>
and 9 and very particularly preferably between 7.5 and 8.5. In addition,<br>
for this purpose, precipitant and/or flocculation aids can be added to the<br>
process water to facilitate the precipitation of lime and the formation of<br>
lime floes having a size suitable for effective separation. In addition,<br>
pressure gas, for example compressed air, is introduced into the pressure<br>
relief flotation apparatus and the mixture generated in this manner is<br>
pressurized before this mixture is exposed to a reduced pressure. The<br>
pressure gas thereby fizzes out of the mixture and flows upwardly in the<br>
apparatus in the form of small bubbles, whereby solids, in particular the<br>
formed lime floes, are taken along and are separated from the process<br>
water. The purified process water delimed in this manner is supplied from<br><br>
the lime elimination apparatus 130a to a filtration unit 140a which is<br>
made, for example, as a sand filtration unit to remove the remaining<br>
particular material from the process water. In addition, a desalination unit<br>
(not shown) can be connected after the filtration unit 140a.<br>
The process water purified and delimed in the process treatment unit<br>
116a of the first stage 101a of the recovered paper preparation apparatus<br>
100 is led back via the return line 145a into the pulper or pulping engine<br>
105.<br>
The thickened fiber suspension drained off from the deckering unit 115a<br>
of the first stage 101a of the recovered paper treatment apparatus 100<br>
moves into the sorting stage 110b and from there into an oxidation unit or<br>
reduction unit 112 before the fiber suspension is thickened in the<br>
deckering unit 115a of the second stage 101b in order to remove as much<br>
of the process water as possible from the fiber suspension. Analogously to<br>
the first stage 101a of the recovered paper treatment apparatus 100, the<br>
process water arising in the sorting apparatus 110b and a part flow of the<br>
waste water arising in the oxidation unit or reduction unit 112 are guided<br>
into the reject treatment unit 118b and the process water arising there is<br>
led into the material recovery unit 120b. The other part flow of the process<br>
water arising in the oxidation unit or reduction unit 112 as well as the<br>
process water arising in the deckering unit 115a are led directly into the<br>
material recovery unit 120b of the process water treatment unit 116b of<br>
the second stage 101b of the recovered paper treatment apparatus 100<br>
and are purified and delimed in the process water treatment unit 116b.<br>
The process water treated in this manner moves in the larger part from<br>
the filtration unit 140b via the line 170 and the return line 145b back into<br>
the sorting apparatus 110b, whereas any possible excess of process water<br>
is guided back via the part flow line 170a to the first stage 101a of the<br><br>
recovered paper treatment apparatus 100 and is led into the return line<br>
145a leading into the pulping engine 105.<br>
In the paper making machine 200, the thickened pulp suspension<br>
supplied continuously from the deckering unit 115b is processed to paper<br>
by means of the centrifugal sorter 202, in which portions with a higher or<br>
lower specific weight than water is separated, the fine sorting apparatus<br>
204, the paper making machine shaping part 206, the paper making<br>
machine pressing part 208 and the drying part 210. Whereas the process<br>
water arising in the system parts 202 and 204 is guided into the reject<br>
treatment unit 212, the process water arising in the system parts 206 and<br>
208 is led into the fiber recovery unit 214. Whereas the rejects are<br>
deckered in the reject treatment unit 212, the process water originating<br>
from the paper making machine shaping part 206 and the paper making<br>
machine pressing part 208 undergoes preremoval of material in the fiber<br>
recovery unit 214 and fibers are separated from it. Process water arising<br>
in the reject treatment unit 212 and in the fiber recovery unit 214 is led<br>
continuously into the process water treatment unit 216 of the paper<br>
making machine 200 and there sequentially flows through the material<br>
removal unit 220, the anaerobic reactor 225, the lime elimination unit 230<br>
and the filtration unit 240 which work like the previously described<br>
corresponding system parts of the process water treatment units 116a,<br>
116b of the recovered paper treatment apparatus 100. Alternatively to<br>
this, the process water arising in the reject treatment unit 212 can be<br>
drained out of the system as waste water and only the process water<br>
arising in the fiber recovery unit 214 can be led continuously through the<br>
process water treatment unit 216 of the paper making machine 200. The<br>
purified and delimed process water removed from the filtration unit 240 is<br>
largely led back into the centrifugal sorter 202 of the paper making<br>
machine 200 via the return line 270 and the part flow line 270b, whereas<br><br>
any possible excess of process water is led via the part flow line 270a into<br>
the line 170 coming from the filtration unit 140b of the second stage 101b<br>
of the recovered paper treatment apparatus 100.<br>
A completely closed process water circuit would admittedly generally be<br>
possible, but would result in enrichments of disturbing materials in the<br>
long term which would ultimately impair the efficiency of the system. A<br>
relatively small portion of fresh water, relative to the amount of process<br>
water guided in the circuit, is therefore supplied to the process, preferably<br>
to the paper making machine 200, via the fresh water supply line 280. A<br>
corresponding amount of process water is removed from the process via<br>
the waste water line 300 and is further purified via the material removal<br>
unit 305, the cooling unit 310 and the biological waste water purification<br>
unit 315, which can also include a lime elimination unit and/or a<br>
filtration unit, before this flow is drained into public waters 400 as waste<br>
water. In addition, the waste water optionally drained, as mentioned<br>
above, from the reject treatment units 118a, 118b, 212 can also be<br>
removed from the process via the waste water line 300 and can be purified<br>
via the material removal unit 305, the cooling unit 310 and the biological<br>
waste water unit 315.<br>
The arrangement of the lime elimination units 130a, 130b, 230 shown in<br>
Fig. 1 is in particular preferred in the manufacture of graph papers<br>
because the mass freight, i.e. the solid concentration in the process water,<br>
is comparatively small.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, it is a system for the manufacture of<br>
paper from recovered paper. In this connection, the pulping engines 105,<br>
sorting devices 110a, 110b, deckering units 115a, 115b, oxidation unit or<br>
reduction unit 112, centrifugal sorter 202, fine sorting apparatus 204,<br><br>
paper making machine shaping part 206 and paper making machine<br>
pressing part 208 shown in Fig. 1 are only shown schematically and do<br>
not reproduce the paper making system down to the last detail. For<br>
example, one of the two sorting apparatus 110a, 110b or both of the<br>
sorting apparatus 110a, 110b can also be made in multiple stages and<br>
consequently include a sequence of sorting devices.<br>
The system in accordance with the invention can equally be a system for<br>
the manufacture of paper from fresh fibers or any desired other system in<br>
which at least one process water treatment unit is provided, with at least<br>
one of the process water treatment units having an anaerobic reactor<br>
mixed with anaerobic microorganisms as well as a lime elimination unit.<br>
In the last-named case, the pulping engines 105, sorting devices 110a,<br>
110b, deckering units 115a, 115b, oxidation unit or reduction unit 112,<br>
centrifugal sorter 202, fine sorting apparatus 204, paper making machine<br>
shaping part 206 and paper making machine pressing part 208 shown in<br>
Fig. 1 have been replaced by corresponding other apparatus or apparatus<br>
parts.<br>
In Fig. 1, the system includes a two-stage pulp preparation. It is naturally<br>
also possible to provide two or more parallel material preparation stages,<br>
in particular for the manufacture of multilayer paper.<br>
In Fig. 2, a schematic view of a stage 101a of a recovered paper<br>
preparation apparatus having a process water treatment unit 116a in<br>
accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention is shown<br>
which can replace the corresponding process water treatment unit 116a of<br>
the first stage 101 a of the recovered paper treatment apparatus 100 of the<br>
system shown in Fig. 1. Alternatively to this, it is also possible to replace<br>
all the process water treatment units 116a, 116b, 216 of the system<br><br>
shown in Fig. 1 in each case by a process water treatment unit 116a<br>
shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The stage 101a shown in Fig. 2, in contrast to the process water treatment<br>
unit 116a shown in Fig. 1, has, in addition to the material recovery unit<br>
120a a material removal unit 122 which is arranged between the material<br>
recovery unit 120a and the anaerobic reactor 125a. A return line 124<br>
leads from the material recovery unit 120 into the pulping engine 105.<br>
In a further difference to the embodiment shown in fig 1, the stage 101a<br>
shown in Fig. 2 does not include any reject treatment unit 118a.<br>
Alternatively to this, however, a reject treatment unit (not shown) can also<br>
be provided in the embodiment shown in Fig. 2 to which the process water<br>
arising in the pulping engine 105 and a part flow of the process water<br>
arising in the sorting apparatus 110a are supplied via corresponding lines<br>
and from which the process water removed in the reject treatment unit is<br>
led into the material recovery unit 120a or is removed from the system as<br>
waste water.<br>
In addition, a precipitation device 135 is provided in the process water<br>
treatment unit 116a downstream of the anaerobic reactor 125a and has<br>
two supply lines 136, 137 via which pH setting agents such as sodium lye,<br>
precipitants such as polyaluminum chloride and/or flocculation aids such<br>
as polyacrylamide can be supplied. A bypass line 139 leads from the<br>
anaerobic reactor 125a past the precipitation device 135 into the filtration<br>
unit 140a and guides a part flow line 126 to the precipitation device 135.<br>
A part flow return line 138 is provided from the precipitation device 135 to<br>
the material removal unit 122.<br><br>
In operation of the stage 101a shown in Fig. 2, the process water<br>
continuously arising in the pulping engine 105, in the sorting apparatus<br>
110a and in the deckering unit 115a is led into the material recovery unit<br>
120a and from there into the material removal unit 122. Whereas coarser<br>
fibers are retained in the material recovery unit 120a and are led back into<br>
the pulping engine 105 via the return line 124, the process water arising<br>
in the material recovery unit 120a is led into the material removal unit<br>
122 in which fine organic and/or inorganic particular material is<br>
separated from the process water. The process water is led continuously<br>
from the material removal unit 122 into the anaerobic reactor 125a. A<br>
main flow of at least 50% of the process water leaving the anaerobic<br>
reactor 125a is guided back via the bypass line 139 into the filtration unit<br>
140a and from there via the return line 145a into the pulping engine 105.<br>
The other part flow of less than 50% of the process water leaving the<br>
anaerobic reactor 125a is led via the part flow line 126 into the lime<br>
precipitation device 135 to which pH setting agent as well as precipitant<br>
and/or flocculation aid are moreover supplied via the supply lines 136,<br>
137 to precipitate lime in the process water. The part flow of the process<br>
water leaving the lime precipitation device 135 is guided back via the part<br>
flow return line 138 into the material removal unit 122 designed as a<br>
microflotation unit in which the precipitated lime is separated from the<br>
process water.<br>
This embodiment is in particular suitable for the manufacture of tissue<br>
paper from recovered paper.<br>
Even though the embodiment show in Fig. 2 was described with reference<br>
to a recovered paper treatment system, the process water treatment unit<br>
116a shown in Fig. 2 can naturally also be provided in a system for the<br><br>
manufacture of paper from fresh fibers or in any other desired system in<br>
which at least one process water treatment unit is provided.<br>
In Fig. 3, a schematic view of a stage 101a of a recovered paper treatment<br>
apparatus having a process water treatment unit 116a in accordance with<br>
a third embodiment of the present invention is shown which can replace<br>
the corresponding process water treatment unit 116a of the first stage<br>
101a of the recovered paper treatment apparatus 100 of the system shown<br>
in Fig. 1. Alternatively to this, it is also possible to replace all the process<br>
water treatment units 116a, 116b, 216 of the system shown in Fig. 1 in<br>
each case by a process water treatment unit 116a shown in Fig. 3.<br>
In the process water treatment unit 116a shown in Fig. 3, a precipitation<br>
device 135 is provided upstream of the material recovery unit 120a and<br>
has two supply lines 136, 137 via which pH setting agents such as sodium<br>
lye, precipitants, such as polyaluminum chloride, and/or flocculation<br>
aids, such as poly aery lamide, can be supplied to the precipitation device<br>
135. Alternatively to this, a reject treatment unit (not shown) described<br>
with respect to the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 can also be provided in<br>
this embodiment.<br>
In the operation of this process water treatment unit 116a, the process<br>
water arising in the pulping engine 105, in the sorting apparatus 110a<br>
and in the deckering unit 115a is led continuously into the precipitation<br>
device 135 in which the carbonates and hydrogen carbonates contained in<br>
the process water are precipitated as lime from the process water by the<br>
setting of corresponding precipitation conditions by the addition of pH<br>
setting agent, precipitant and/or flocculation aid. The mixture created in<br>
this manner is led into the material recovery unit 120a designed as a<br>
pressure relief flotation apparatus in which the fibers contained in the<br><br>
process water and the lime flocs contained in the process water are<br>
separated. The material recovery unit 120a consequently simultaneously<br>
works as a lime separation unit.<br>
After the separation of the lime and of the fibers, the process water runs<br>
through the anaerobic reactor 125a and the filtration unit 140a before the<br>
process water is guided back via the return line 145a into the material<br>
recovery unit 120a, 120b and/or the material removal unit (not shown).<br>
Advantageously with respect to the system shown in Fig. 1, the lime<br>
elimination unit is thus combined with the pulping engine 105 in the<br>
process water treatment unit 116a shown in Fig. 3.<br><br>
