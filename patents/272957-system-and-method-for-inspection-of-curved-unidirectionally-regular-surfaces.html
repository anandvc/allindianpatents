System and method for inspection of curved unidirectionally<br>
regular surfaces<br>
The present invention relates to inspection of irregularities<br>
curved surfaces that are unidirectionally regular, i.e.<br>
curved surfaces that have a uniform surface profile along one<br>
direction.<br>
Inspection of irregularities, such as embossments, on various<br>
items such as machine parts is a problem of wide interest<br>
since it affects quality control and sorting. The need of the<br>
hour is such a machine vision system that can map, detect and<br>
inspect irregularities such as embossments on not just flat<br>
surfaces, but also unidirectionally regular surfaces e.g. tin<br>
cans, rubber tires, tubes etc. The system should not only<br>
provide accuracy in profiling, but work in cases of low color<br>
or intensity contrast at real time and low cost of materials<br>
and fabrication.<br>
The aforementioned problem may be addressed by a three<br>
dimensional profiling system, for example, as disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5193120. However, such a system is<br>
prohibitively slow for machine vision inspection purposes.<br>
The aforementioned problem can also be solved using high<br>
speed acquisition system and a triangulated laser beam.<br>
Prior-art inspection systems based on laser triangulation<br>
typically require a high speed area-scan camera and a laser.<br>
In such systems, a laser line obtained from a beam shaper or<br>
triangulation using optical assemblies is made incident on<br>
the inspection surface. A camera scans the laser profile as<br>
the object under inspection is made to pass under the<br>
incident laser line. The distortion in the laser pattern<br>
provides depth information which is subsequently compared<br>
with a standard template for inspection purposes.<br><br>
The above solution can be adapted to cases where the object<br>
under inspection moves rapidly. This may be done by using<br>
line-scan cameras or high speed area-scan cameras. High speed<br>
area-scan cameras are expensive and consume huge data<br>
transfer or processing rates. Line-scan cameras overcome this<br>
disadvantage since a lot of unnecessary information is<br>
removed from transfer or processing. However, with line-scan<br>
cameras, the surface needs to be flat so that depth artifacts<br>
can be mapped to ridges that represent embossments. Many<br>
scenarios of inspection of such embossments involve cases<br>
where the surface of the inspected item is unidirectionally<br>
regular but not necessarily flat. Examples of such surfaces<br>
are tin cans, ball shaped and other spherical surfaces.<br>
Alternately, adaptive lens steering, for example, as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5576948, have also been used<br>
where the triangulated laser beam translates adaptively over<br>
a test surface to compensate for angular deflections.<br>
However, such a system is not just complex, slow and<br>
expensive, but cannot be rendered for a machine vision system<br>
where space constraints prohibit such motion.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved<br>
system for inspection of embossments on curved surfaces that<br>
are unidirectionally regular.<br>
The above object is achieved by a system in accordance with<br>
claim 1 and a method in accordance with claim 10.<br>
The underlying idea of the present invention is to leverage<br>
the advantage of line-scan cameras to not just flat surfaces,<br>
but to curved surfaces that are unidirectionally regular,<br>
i.e., having a uniform surface profile along one direction.<br>
The above refers to a surface that posses symmetry such that<br>
the shape of the surface does not change locally as seen from<br>
a certain perspective if the surface is moved in a uniform<br>
motion, which may include, for example, rotational or<br>
translational motion. In accordance with the present<br><br>
invention, by generating a radiation beam having a beam<br>
cross-section in the form of a curved line having an<br>
appropriate curvature, it is possible to obtain a projection<br>
of the beam on the curved surface that appears as a straight<br>
line from the position of the line-scan camera, which would<br>
make it possible for the line-scan camera to accurately<br>
capture complete ridge information from the image of the<br>
projection of the beam on the curved surface.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, said radiation<br>
beam comprises a laser beam. Using a laser beam is useful in<br>
inspection of irregularities dark surfaces having very little<br>
contrast in intensity.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, said<br>
radiation beam comprises a laser beam. An x-ray beam has<br>
lower wavelength and is useful in measuring surface<br>
irregularities of extremely small dimensions.<br>
To generate a radiation beam having a beam cross-section in<br>
the form of a curved line, in a further embodiment of the<br>
present invention, said first means further comprises:<br>
-	a radiation source adapted to emit said radiation beam<br>
having an initial beam profile,<br>
-	a beam shaping aperture having a curvature adapted for re-<br>
shaping said radiation beam by altering said initial beam<br>
profile such that the re-shaped radiation beam has a cross-<br>
section in the form of said curved line.<br>
According to a still further embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the curvature of said beam shaping aperture is<br>
iteratively determined as a function of a curvature of said<br>
curved surface. This would provide an appropriate curvature<br>
to the beam shaping aperture such that the projection of the<br>
radiation beam on the curved surface after passing through<br>
the beam shaping aperture would appear as a straight line<br>
from the position of the line-scan camera.<br><br>
In an alternate embodiment, said radiation beam is a light<br>
beam, wherein first means comprises a video projector adapted<br>
for generating a light beam in the form of a light sheet<br>
having a constant beam cross-section in the form of said<br>
curved line. A video projector can be advantageously-<br>
programmed to generate a light sheet having any desired<br>
cross-sectional shape, which allows the present invention to<br>
be used for any arbitrarily curved surface that has a uniform<br>
surface profile along one direction.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, said irregularity is an<br>
embossment, wherein said second means is adapted for<br>
comparing said reconstructed ridge information to a standard<br>
template to determine a machine identifiable pattern of<br>
embossment on said curved surface. This is useful in machine<br>
vision applications, such as in the' inspection of tires of a<br>
vehicle having alphanumeric characters embossed on the<br>
sidewalls of the tires.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, said curved<br>
surface is a cylindrical surface. In another embodiment, said<br>
curved surface is a sidewall of a tire. Such curved surfaces<br>
having a uniform surface profile along one direction, provide<br>
an appropriate geometry for realizing the present invention.<br>
The present invention is further described hereinafter with<br>
reference to illustrated embodiments shown in the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIG 1 is a schematic diagram of a system for detecting<br>
irregularities such as embossments on a unidirectionally<br>
regular curved surface according one embodiment of the<br>
present invention,<br>
FIG 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating a beam projection<br>
from an arc shaped beam shaping aperture on a flat surface,<br><br>
FIG 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating a beam projection<br>
from an arc shaped beam shaping aperture having an<br>
appropriate curvature on a curved surface,<br>
FIG 4 illustrates an image of a projection of the radiation<br>
beam on a strip of the curved surface as captured by a line-<br>
scan camera,<br>
FIG 5 illustrates a reconstructed image showing embossments<br>
on the curved surface,<br>
FIG 6 illustrates a use of the present invention for<br>
inspecting irregularities on a cylindrical surface along the<br>
longitudinal length of the cylindrical surface, and<br>
FIG 7 illustrates a use of the present invention for<br>
inspecting irregularities on an arbitrarily curved surface.<br>
The present invention provides an efficient system and method<br>
for detection of irregularities (for example, embossments) on<br>
curved unidirectionally regular surfaces. In accordance with<br>
the present invention, by generating a radiation beam having<br>
a beam cross-section in the form of a curved line having an<br>
appropriate curvature, it is possible to obtain a projection<br>
of the beam on the curved surface that appears as a straight<br>
line from the position of a line-scan camera, which would<br>
make it possible for the line-scan camera to accurately<br>
capture complete ridge information from the image of the<br>
projection of the beam on the curved surface. The present<br>
invention would work for arbitrarily curved surfaces that are<br>
unidirectionally regular, i.e., having a uniform surface<br>
profile along at least one direction, such that surface<br>
profiles between successive image frames captured by the<br>
line-scan camera remain the same.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is now<br>
described referring to FIG 1. Herein a system 10 is<br>
illustrated that is used for inspecting embossments<br><br>
(typically alphanumeric, characters) on the sidewall of a<br>
tire, which is a curved surface 20 that has a uniform surface<br>
profile along a circumferential direction, indicated by the<br>
arrow 24. The direction of curvature of the surface 20 is<br>
indicated by the arrow 22. In this example, there is very<br>
little contrast of intensity as both the tire surface and the<br>
embossments are generally black. Hence, the illustrated<br>
embodiment is based on laser triangulation and the use of a<br>
line-scan camera 30 to map the ridges on the curved surface<br>
20 into machine identifiable patterns.<br>
The system 10 comprises first means 11 for generating a<br>
radiation beam 14, which in this case is a laser beam, having<br>
a beam cross-section 13 in the form of a curved line (i.e.,<br>
having a non-zero curvature). To that end, the first means 11<br>
comprises a laser radiation source that emits a laser beam 14<br>
having an initial beam profile that is typically a Gaussian<br>
laser beam profile. The laser beam 14 is diverged using a<br>
concave lens 16 and made to pass through a beam shaping<br>
aperture 16 that re-shapes the laser beam 14 by altering the<br>
initial beam profile, such that laser beam 14 now has a beam<br>
cross-section 13 in the form of a curved line (i.e., having a<br>
non-zero curvature). The laser beam 14 having the above<br>
cross-sectional profile is made incident on the curved<br>
surface 20 at a non-orthogonal angle a (i.e., a does not<br>
equal 90 degrees), wherein a projection 28 of the beam is<br>
obtained on a strip of the curved surface 20.<br>
The shape of the projection 28 of the beam on the curved<br>
surface 20 is a function of the nature of the surface 20<br>
(i.e., the degree of curvature) and the cross-sectional<br>
profile of the laser beam 14 that is incident on the surface<br>
20, which in turn is directly related to the shape of the<br>
beam shaping aperture 18. This idea is further explained with<br>
reference to FIGS 2 and 3. As shown in FIG 2, if a radiation<br>
beam is made to pass through an arc-shaped beam shaping<br>
aperture 50 and made incident on a flat surface 52, the<br>
projection 54 of the beam on a flat surface 52 appears in the<br><br>
shape of a curved line from the position of the line-scan<br>
camera. However, as shown in FIG 3, if the surface 62 is<br>
curved, then the projection 64 of the beam on the surface 62<br>
may be made to appear as a straight line from the position of<br>
the line-scan camera by providing an appropriate curvature to<br>
the arc-shaped beam shaping aperture 60.<br>
Referring back to FIG 1, the above idea can be incorporated<br>
to iteratively determine an appropriate curvature 2 6 for the<br>
beam shaping aperture 18 as a function of the curvature 22 of<br>
the curved surface 20, such that the projection 28 of the<br>
beam on the curved surface 20 appears as a straight line from<br>
the position of the line-scan camera 30. This would make it<br>
possible for the line-scan camera 30 to accurately capture<br>
complete ridge information from the projection 28 of the beam<br>
on the curved surface 20. For the purpose of scanning the<br>
entire surface area, the curved surface 20 is imparted a<br>
motion in the circumferential direction 24 (i.e., about the<br>
central axis 21 of the tire), along which the curved surface<br>
20 has a uniform surface profile. The line-scan camera 30<br>
captures a series of images of the projections 28 of the beam<br>
on successive strips of the moving surface 20 along the<br>
direction 24 of scan. FIG 4 illustrates an image frame 32<br>
captured by the line-scan camera 30 that corresponds to the<br>
projection 28 in FIG 1. Since the laser beam is incident on<br>
the curved surface at a non-orthogonal angle, the image 32 of<br>
the projection of the beam captured by the line scan camera<br>
will contain ridges 42, 44, 46, 48 and 50 corresponding to<br>
depth variations on the curved surface at the location of the<br>
strip on which the beam is projected.<br>
Referring back to FIG 1, the proposed system 10 includes<br>
second means 31 including, for example, software algorithms<br>
running on a computer, for extracting ridge information from<br>
the image frames captured by the line-scan camera 30 that<br>
scans through the entire surface area of the curved surface<br>
20. As shown in FIG 5, the ridge information thus extracted<br>
is then reconstructed to generate an image 34 containing<br><br>
machine identifiable embossment patterns 36, 38 and 48 which<br>
may be arrived at by comparison with standard templates.<br>
The above described idea may be applicable for measuring any<br>
other form of surface irregularities, such as cracks,<br>
distortions (for example, thermal distortions) , surface<br>
corrosion, leaks, deposits, among others. The above idea<br>
would also work any other curved surface which has a uniform<br>
surface profile in a particular direction. FIG 6 illustrates<br>
an arrangement for a system 80. for inspecting irregularities<br>
84 on a cylindrical surface 82, which, being a curved<br>
surface, has a uniform surface profile along a longitudinal<br>
direction 86. Means 88 are provided to generate a radiation<br>
beam 92 having a beam cross-section :94. in the form of an<br>
appropriately curved line, the radiation beam being incident<br>
on the surface 82 at a non-orthogonal angle p with the<br>
central axis 89 of the cylindrical surface 82. The<br>
cylindrical surface is imparted a motion along the direction<br>
86, allowing a line-scan camera 90 to capture a series of<br>
images of the projection 96 of the beam on the cylindrical<br>
surface, the projection 96 appearing as a straight line from<br>
the position of the line-scan camera 90. As explained<br>
earlier, the images captured by the line-scan camera 90 are<br>
analyzed to extract ridge information, which is then<br>
reconstructed to identify the irregularities on the<br>
cylindrical surface 82. In still alternative embodiments, the<br>
curved surface may include torus shaped surfaces, spheres or<br>
even surfaces having complex curved surface profiles (for<br>
example, as described referring to FIG 7), all of these<br>
surfaces having a uniform surface profile along at least one<br>
direction.<br>
The present invention may also be equally extended for any<br>
other form of radiation beam, depending upon the application.<br>
For example, for inspecting surface irregularities of<br>
extremely small dimensions, a radiation beam having a low<br>
wavelength, for example, an x-ray beam, might be used<br>
instead. The above idea also works for regular light beams<br><br>
from an illumination source, such as a video projector.<br>
Advantageously, video projectors can be used in case of any<br>
arbitrarily curved surface having a complex surface profile<br>
that is uniform along one direction. In such cases, the video<br>
projector can be programmed using appropriate software<br>
algorithms to generate a light sheet in the shape of a<br>
complex curve, which when projected on the arbitrarily curved<br>
surface, appears as a straight line to a line-scan camera. An<br>
example of such an application is illustrated in FIG 7.<br>
Referring to FIG 7, a system 100 is used for inspecting an<br>
irregularity 112 on a curved surface 102 having an<br>
arbitrarily curved complex surface profile.108 that is<br>
uniform along the direction 110. Herein radiation beam in the<br>
form of a light sheet 114 is generated by a video projector,<br>
for example, a liquid crystal display projector 104. The<br>
light sheet 114 is incident on the surface 102 at a non-<br>
orthogonal angle y. The video projector can be programmed in<br>
a manner such that the light sheet 112 generated by the video<br>
projector 104 has a cross-section 118 in the form of a curve<br>
such that the projection 116 of the light sheet 114 on the<br>
arbitrarily curved surface appears as a straight line from<br>
the position of the line scan camera 106. For scanning the<br>
surface 102, a motion is imparted to the surface 102 along<br>
the direction 110, for example by placing the surface 102 on<br>
a conveyor belt (not shown), wherein the line-scan camera 10 6<br>
captures a sequence of images of the projection 116 of the<br>
light sheet on successive strips on the moving surface 102<br>
along the direction of scan 110. Extraction of. ridge<br>
information from the images and reconstruction of the ridge<br>
information may be carried out as mentioned above.<br>
The proposed system has several advantages. Firstly, re-<br>
shaping cross-sectional profile of the radiation beam will<br>
remove any referencing issued for depth variation search for<br>
any arbitrarily curved, unidirectionally regular surface.<br>
Secondly, a line-scan camera without such means for beam re-<br>
shaping will not be able to capture such variations and<br><br>
reconstruct the three-dimensional ridge information. Thus,<br>
with the aid of such beam re-shaping means, a. line-scan<br>
camera with very high frame rates and low cost will be able<br>
to capture the profile variations depicted by ridges in order<br>
to reconstruct the surface irregularities such as embossments<br>
in real time. This is particularly useful in industrial<br>
machine vision applications. Such a setup also reduces the<br>
need for very high data transfer rates and preemptively<br>
discards unnecessary information.<br>
Summarizing, the present invention provides a system and<br>
method for detection of irregularities on a curved surface<br>
having a uniform surface profile along a first direction. The<br>
proposed system comprises first means for generating a<br>
radiation beam having a beam cross-section in the form of a<br>
curved line. The radiation beam is projected on a strip said<br>
curved surface. A line-scan camera is used to capture an<br>
image of a projection of the beam on said strip of said<br>
curved surface, the projection of the beam appearing as a<br>
straight line from the position of the line-scan camera. The<br>
curved surface is imparted a motion along said first<br>
direction that allows the line-scan camera to capture a<br>
series of images of the projections of the beam on successive<br>
strips of said curved surface. The proposed system comprises<br>
second means for extracting ridge information from the images<br>
captured by said line-scan camera and reconstructing said<br>
ridge information to identify an irregularity on said curved<br>
surface.<br>

the invention, will become apparent to persons skilled in the<br>

The present invention provides a system (10) and method for<br>
detection of irregularities on a curved surface (20) having a<br>
uniform surface profile along a first direction (24). The<br>
proposed system (10) comprises first means (11) for<br>
generating a radiation beam (14) having a beam cross-section<br>
(13) in the form of a curved line. The radiation beam ( 14) is<br>
projected on a strip said curved surface (20). A line-scan<br>
camera (30) is used to capture an image (32) of a projection<br>
(28) of the beam on said strip of said curved surface (20),<br>
the projection (28) of the beam appearing as a straight line<br>
from the position of the line-scan camera (30). The curved<br>
surface (20) is imparted a motion along said first direction<br>
(24) that allows the line-scan camera (30) to capture a<br>
series of images (32) of the projections (28) of the beam on<br>
successive strips of said curved surface (20). The proposed<br>
system (10) comprises second means (31) for extracting ridge<br>
information from the images (32) captured by said line-scan<br>
camera (30) and reconstructing said ridge information to<br>
identify an irregularity on said curved surface (20).</td>
