CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
 This application claims the benefit of<br>
U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/884,493 filed<br>
January 11, 2007, which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
 This invention relates to the diagnosis<br>
and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. More particularly,<br>
this invention relates to the identification of<br>
arrhythmogenic foci associated with ventricular<br>
tachycardia.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br><br><br>
	Cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular<br>
tachycardia are an important cause of morbidity and<br>
death. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,54 6,951, and<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,690,963, both issued to Ben Haim; and<br>
PCT application WO 96/057 68, all of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference, disclose methods for<br>
sensing an electrical property of heart tissue, for<br>
example, local activation time, as a function of the<br>
precise location within the heart. Data' are acquired with<br>
one or more catheters having electrical and location<br>
sensors in their distal tips, which are advanced into the<br>
heart. Methods of creating a map of the' electrical<br>
activity of the heart based on these data are disclosed<br>
in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,226,542, and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,301,4 96, both issued to Reisfeld, which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. As indicated in these<br>
patents, location and electrical activity is typically<br>
initially measured on about 10 to about 20 points on the<br>
interior surface of the heart. These data points are then<br>
generally sufficient to generate a preliminary<br>
reconstruction or map of the cardiac surface. The<br>
preliminary map is often combined with data taken at<br>
additional points in order to generate a more<br>
comprehensive map of the heart's electrical activity.<br>
Indeed, in clinical settings, it is not uncommon to<br>
accumulate data at 100 or more sites to generate a<br>
detailed, comprehensive map of heart chamber electrical<br>
activity. The generated detailed map may then serve as<br>
the basis for deciding on a therapeutic course of action,<br>
for example, tissue ablation, to alter the propagation of<br><br>
the heart's electrical activity and to restore normal<br>
heart rhythm.<br>
 Catheters containing position sensors may<br>
be used to determine the trajectory of points on the<br>
cardiac surface. These trajectories may be used to infer<br>
motion characteristics such as the contractility of the<br>
tissue. As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,738,096, 'issued<br>
to Ben Haim, and incorporated herein in its entirety by<br>
reference, maps depicting such motion characteristics may<br>
be constructed when the trajectory information is sampled<br>
at a sufficient number of points in the heart.<br>
	U.S. Patent No. 6,847,839, issued to<br>
Ciaccio, et al., describes a method for identifying and<br>
localizing a reentrant circuit isthmus in a heart of a<br>
subject during sinus rhythm, including: a) receiving<br>
electrogram signals from the heart during sinus rhythm<br>
via electrodes; b) storing the electrogram signals; c)<br>
creating a map based on the electrogram signals; d)<br>
finding a center reference activation location on the<br>
map; e) defining measurement vectors originating from the<br>
center reference activation location; f) selecting from<br>
the measurement vectors a primary axis vector indicating<br>
a location of the reentrant circuit isthmus in the heart;<br>
g) finding threshold points of electrogram signals on the<br>
map; h) connecting the threshold points to form a polygon<br>
indicating a shape of the reentrant circuit isthmus in<br>
the heart.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	Electrical activity at a point in the<br>
heart is typically measured by advancing a catheter-<br>
containing an electrical sensor at or near its distal tip<br>
to that point in the heart, contacting the tissue with<br>
the sensor and acquiring data at that point. One drawback<br>
with mappin.g a cardiac chamber using a catheter<br>
containing only a single, distal tip electrode is the<br>
long period of time required to accumulate data on a<br>
point-by-point basis over the requisite number of points<br>
required for a detailed, map of the chamber as a whole.<br>
Hence, patients with unstable ventricular tachycardia<br>
(VT) can not tolerate a mapping procedure that lasts long<br>
enough to produce an accurate activation map. Therefore,<br>
pace mapping, performed by conventional techniques, is the method used in such cases. This involves pacing the<br>
chamber at a relatively fast rate (typically,, but not<br>
necessarily at the cycle length of the arrhythmia), then<br>
comparing a body surface 12-lead ECG during pacing to the<br>
EGG recorded during clinical arrhythmia, either induced<br>
or previously recorded.<br>
 Myocardial scars are known to be<br>
associated with arrhythmic conductive pathways and foci,<br>
e.g., reentrant foci, that are responsible for<br>
ventricular tachycardia. Currently, identification of<br>
such foci using the aforementioned mapping techniques is<br>
a long and tedious procedure, for example, involving<br>
visual comparisons between the complexes associated with<br><br>
clinical ventricular tachycardia and pace-mapped signals.<br>
Such foci have been the subject of some prior research.<br>
 After a patient has recovered from an<br>
episode of ventricular tachycardia, a cardiologist may<br>
perform an electrophysiological study in order to<br>
identify foci of the arrhythmia. During the study, a<br>
pacing catheter is introduced into the heart chamber and<br>
is operated to apply electrical stimulation pulses to the<br>
myocardium at different locations in an attempt to induce<br>
ventricular tachycardia. If pacing at a given site<br>
induces ventricular tachycardia or other arrhythmia, the<br>
arrhythmia is recorded and compared to the pacing from<br>
other sessions.<br>
 The VT-related patterns that are induced<br>
by electrophysiological pacing may be transient and<br>
difficult to identify. As a result, the job of searching<br>
for VT foci can be tedious and inaccurate, and it may be.<br>
too difficult for less experienced cardiologists. In<br>
response to these difficulties, embodiments of the<br>
present invention provide methods that can be used to<br>
automate the detection of VT foci by numerically<br>
comparing the characteristic related ECG patterns, i.e.,<br>
between the clinical arrhythmia and the pace mapping<br>
points.<br>
	According to disclosed embodiments of the<br>
invention, ventricular tachycardia signals are induced in<br>
a living subject. Pace-mapped signals are then obtained<br><br>
from multiple points within the ventricle, and<br>
automatically compared numerically with the induced<br>
signals. Recognition of a high degree of cross<br>
correlation between the induced signals and one or more<br>
of the pace-mapped signals identifies arrhythmogenic foci, which may then be ablated. Several mathematical<br>
techniques are employed to obtain the numerical<br>
comparisons and correlations.<br>
 An embodiment of the invention provides a<br>
computer-implemented method for locating an<br>
arrhythmogenic focus or pathway in a heart of a living<br>
subject, which is carried out by recording a reference<br>
set of electrocardiographic signals from the subject,<br>
stimulating the heart at multiple locations endocardially<br>
or epicardially, and while stimulating at the multiple<br>
locations, recording respective sets of pace-mapped<br>
electrocardiographic signals. The method is further<br>
carried out by correlating the sets of pace-mapped<br>
electrocardiographic signals with the reference set of<br>
electrocardiographic signals. Responsively, to a<br>
determination that a correlation between one of the sets<br>
of pace-mapped electrocardiographic signals and the<br>
reference set of electrocardiographic signals meets a<br>
predefined criterion, the arrhythmogenic focus or pathway<br>
is identified as the respective location corresponding to<br>
the one pace-mapped set of pace-mapped<br>
electrocardiographic signals.<br><br>
 In one aspect of the method, the reference<br>
set of electrocardiographic signals and the sets of pace-<br>
mapped electrocardiographic signals are recorded remotely<br>
from an analysis location where the signals are<br>
correlated. The method includes transmitting at least one<br>
of the reference set of electrocardiographic signals and<br>
the sets of pace-mapped electrocardiographic signals to<br>
the analysis location.<br>
 According to an aspect of the	method, the<br>
reference set of electrocardiographic signals	is recorded<br>
using an implanted intracardiac device and is	transmitted<br>
to the analysis location in realtime.<br>
	Yet another aspect of the method includes<br>
recording a historic set of electrocardiographic signals<br>
remotely from the analysis location, transmitting the<br>
historic set of electrocardiographic signals to the<br>
analysis location, and comparing the historic set of<br>
electrocardiographic signals with the reference set of<br>
electrocardiographic signals at the analysis location.<br>
 According to still another aspect of the<br>
method, the reference set of electrocardiographic signals<br>
is transmitted to the analysis location at least in part<br>
wirelessly.<br>
 In a further aspect of the method,<br>
correlating is performed by calculating respective<br>
numerical comparisons between the sets of pace-mapped<br><br>
electrocardiographic signals and the reference set of<br>
electrocardiographic signals, and calculating a<br>
corre.l ation coefficient.<br>
 According to one aspect of the method, the<br>
criterion is met when the correlation coefficient<br>
exceeds a predefined value.<br>
	According to another aspect of the method,<br>
the sets of pace-mapped electrocardiographic signals and<br>
the reference set of electrocardiographic signals<br>
comprise 12-lead electrocardiograms, and the criterion is<br>
met when the correlation coefficient exceeds a predefined<br>
value in a predefined number of leads of the 12-lead<br>
electrocardiograms.<br>
 A further aspect of the method includes<br>
constructing a functional map of the heart in which a<br>
degree of correlation between the sets of pace-mapped<br>
electrocardiographic signals and the reference set of<br>
electrocardiographic signals are related to the multiple<br>
locations.<br>
 Yet another aspect of the method includes<br>
inducing ventricular tachycardia prior to recording the<br>
reference set of electrocardiographic signals.<br>
 An embodiment of the invention provides a<br>
computer-implemented method for locating an<br>
arrhythmogenic abnormality in a heart of a living<br><br>
subject, which is carried out by stimulating the heart at<br>
multiple locations endocardially or epicardially, and,<br>
recording respective sets of pace-mapped<br>
electrocardiographic signals. The method is further<br>
carried out by detecting an abnormal electrocardiographic<br>
signal pattern in the sets of pace-mapped<br>
electrocardiographic signals indicative of an<br>
arrhythmogenic focus or pathway, memorizing the pattern,<br>
and subseguently automatically identifying a new instance<br>
of the pattern when recording new electrocardiographic<br>
signals.<br>
 One aspect of the method includes adding<br>
the pattern to a library for use in subsequent automatic<br>
identifications of a new instance of the pattern.<br>
 An additional aspect of the method<br>
includes automatically identifying a new instance of the<br>
pattern by selecting a first time interval containing a<br>
pattern of interest in the new electrocardiographic<br>
signals, computing respective values of a characteristic<br>
of the new electrocardiographic signals in a plurality of<br>
time segments within the first time interval,<br>
concatenating the respective values to form a signature<br>
of the pattern of interest, and identifying a further<br>
occurrence of the pattern of interest in the new<br>
electrocardiographic signals during a second time<br>
interval by matching the new electrocardiographic signals<br>
in the second time interval to the signature.<br><br>

System Architecture<br>
 Turning now to the drawings, reference is<br>
initially made to Fig. 1, which is a pictorial<br><br>
illustration of a system 10 that is adapted to detecting<br>
areas in a heart 12 of a living subject that are<br>
associated with an arrhythmia and performing ablative<br>
procedures in accordance with a disclosed embodiment of<br>
the invention. The system comprises a probe, typically a<br>
catheter 14, which is percutaneously inserted by an<br>
operator 16, who is typically a physician, through the<br>
patient's vascular system into a chamber or vascular<br>
structure of the heart. The operator 16 brings the<br>
catheter's distal tip 18 into contact with the heart wall<br>
at a target site that is to be evaluated. Electrical<br>
activation maps are then prepared,' according to the<br>
methods disclosed in the above-noted U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 6,226,542, and 6,301,496, and in commonly assigned<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,892,091, whose disclosure is herein<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
 Areas determined to be abnormal by<br>
evaluation of the electrical maps can be ablated<br>
application of thermal energy, e.g., by passage of<br>
radiof requency electrical current through wires in the<br>
catheter to one or more electrodes at the distal tip 18,<br>
which apply the radiofrequency energy to the myocardium.<br>
The energy is absorbed in the tissue, heating it to a<br>
point (typically about 50°C) at which it permanently loses<br>
its electrical excitability. When successful, this<br>
procedure creates non-conducting lesions in the cardiac<br>
tissue, which disrupt the abnormal electrical pathway<br>
causing the arrhythmia. Alternatively, other known<br>
methods of applying ablative energy can be used, e.g.,<br><br>
ultrasound energy, as disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2004/0102769, whose<br>
disclosure is herein incorporated by reference. The<br>
principles of the invention are disclosed with respect to<br>
atrial complex fractionated electrograms, but can be<br>
applied to all heart chambers, to epicardial as well as<br>
endocardial approaches, and to mapping in sinus rhythm,<br>
and when many different cardiac arrhythmias are present.<br>
 The catheter 14 typically comprises a<br>
handle 20, having suitable controls on the handle to<br>
enable the operator 16 to steer, position and orient the<br>
distal end of the catheter as desired to the ablation. To<br>
aid the operator 16, the distal portion of the<br>
catheter 14 contains position sensors (not shown) that<br>
provide signals to a positioning processor 22, located in<br>
a console 24. The catheter 14, may be adapted, mutatis<br>
mutahdjs, from the ablation catheter described in<br>
commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,669,692, whose<br>
disclosure is herein incorporated by reference. The<br>
console 24 typically contains an ablation power<br>
generator 43, The console 24 also includes a processor 23<br>
that performs signal correlation and analysis functions,<br>
which are described in further detail hereinbelow. In<br>
some embodiments, the processor 22 and processor 23 can<br>
be integrated into a single processor. The processor 23<br>
can be realized as a general purpose computer.<br>
 The positioning processor 22 is an element<br>
of a positioning subsystem that measures location and<br><br>
orientation coordinates of the catheter 14. Throughout<br>
this patent application, the term "location" refers to<br>
the spatial coordinates of the catheter, and the term<br>
"orientation" refers 'to its angular coordinates. The term<br>
"position" refers to the full positional information of<br>
the catheter, comprising both location and orientation<br>
coordinates.<br>
 In one embodiment, the positioning<br>
subsystem 2 6 comprises a magnetic position tracking<br>
system that determines the position and orientation of<br>
the catheter 14. The positioning subsystem 26 generates<br>
magnetic fields in a predefined working volume its<br>
vicinity and senses these fields at the catheter. The<br>
positioning subsystem 2 6 typically comprises a set of<br>
external radiators, such as field generating coils 28,<br>
which are located in fixed, known positions external to<br>
the patient. The coils 28 generate fields, typically<br>
electromagnetic fields, in the vicinity of the heart 12.<br>
 In an alternative embodiment,	a radiator<br>
in the catheter 14, such as a coil,	generates<br>
electromagnetic fields, which are received	by sensors<br>
(not shown) outside the patient's body.<br>
 Some position tracking systems that may be<br>
used for this purpose are described, for example, in the<br>
above-noted U.S. Patents 6,690,963, and in commonly<br>
assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 6,618,612 and 6,332,089, and<br>
U.S. Patent Application Publications 2004/0147920,<br><br>
and 2004/0068178, whose disclosures are all incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Although the positioning<br>
subsystem 2 6 shown in Fig. 1 uses magnetic fields, the<br>
methods described below may be implemented using any<br>
other suitable positioning subsystem, such as systems<br>
based on electromagnetic fields, acoustic or ultrasonic<br>
measurements.<br>
 Reference is now made to Fig. 2, which is<br>
a diagram of an embodiment of the catheter 14 for use in<br>
the system 10 (Fig. 1) . The catheter 14 is a mapping and<br>
therapeutic delivery catheter for insertion into the<br>
human body, and into a chamber of the heart 12 (Fig. 1) .<br>
The catheter shown is exemplary; many other types of<br>
catheters can be used as the catheter 14. The catheter 14<br>
includes a body 30. An electrode 32 is at a distal<br>
portion 34 disposed for measuring the electrical<br>
properties of the heart tissue. The electrode 32 is also<br>
useful for sending electrical signals to the heart for<br>
diagnostic purposes, e.g., for electrical mapping, and/or<br>
for therapeutic purposes, e.g., for ablating defective<br>
cardiac tissue. The distal portion 34 further includes an<br>
array 36 of non-contact electrodes 38 for measuring far<br>
field electrical signals in the heart chamber. The<br>
array 36 is a linear array in that the non-contact<br>
electrodes 38 are linearly arranged along the<br>
longitudinal axis of the distal portion 34. The distal<br>
portion 34 further includes at least one position<br>
sensor 40 that generates signals used to determine the<br>
position and orientation of the distal tip 18 within the<br><br>
body. The position sensor 40 is preferably adjacent to<br>
the distal tip 18. There is a fixed positional and<br>
orientational relationship of the position sensor 40, the<br>
distal tip 18 and the electrode 32.<br>
 The position sensor 4 0 transmits, in<br>
response to the fields produced by the positioning<br>
subsystem 26 (Fig. 1), position-related electrical<br>
signals over a cable 42 running through the catheter 14<br>
to the console 24 .. Alternatively, the position sensor 40<br>
in the catheter 14 may transmit signals to the console 2 4<br>
over a wireless link, as described in U.S. Patent<br>
Application	Publication	Nos. 2003/0120150<br>
and 2005/0099290, the disclosures of which are herein<br>
incorporated by reference. The positioning processor 22<br>
then calculates the location and orientation of the<br>
distal portion 34 of the catheter 14 based on the signals<br>
sent by the position sensor 40. The positioning<br>
processor 22 typically receives, amplifies, filters,<br>
digitizes, and otherwise processes signals from the<br>
catheter 14. The positioning processor 22 also provides a<br>
signal output to a display 44 that provides a visual<br>
indication, of the position of the distal portion 34<br>
and/or the distal tip 18 of the catheter 14 relative to<br>
the site chosen for ablation.<br>
 The handle 2 0 of the catheter 14 includes<br>
controls 4 6 to steer or deflect the distal portion 34, or<br>
to orient it as desired.<br><br>
 The cable 42 comprises a receptacle 48,<br>
which connects to the handle 20. The receptacle 48 is<br>
preferably configured to receive catheters of a specific<br>
model, and preferably includes user-evident<br>
identification of the specific model. One of the<br>
advantages in using the cable 42 is the ability to<br>
connect different models and types of catheters, such as<br>
those catheters having different handle configurations,<br>
to the same console 24 (Fig. 1) . Another advantage in<br>
having a separate cable 42 is in the fact that it does<br>
not come into contact with patients, so that it is<br>
possible to reuse the cable 42 without sterilization. The<br>
cable 42 further contains one or more isolation<br>
transformers (not shown), which electrically isolate the<br>
catheter 14 from the console 24. The isolation<br>
transformers may be contained in the receptacle 48.<br>
Alternatively, isolation transformers may be contained in<br>
the system electronics of the console 24.<br>
	Referring again to Fig. 1, the system 10<br>
can be realized as the above-mentioned CARTO XP FP<br>
Navigation and Ablation System, suitably modified to<br>
execute the procedures described herein.<br>
General Operation<br>
 Reference is now made to Fig. 3, which is<br>
a diagram illustrating phases of a procedure for<br>
detecting arrhythmogenic foci or pathways associated with<br>
ventricular tachycardia in accordance with a disclosed<br><br>
embodiment of the invention. In a first induction<br>
phase 50, ventricular tachycardia is induced (or observed<br>
without induction. Alternatively, traces may be imported<br>
by any suitable means, i.e., scanning, electronic<br>
transmission from other systems, which may be remote.<br>
Conventional 12-lead electrocardiographic signals are<br>
initially recorded and constitute a reference set of<br>
electrocardiographic signals. In a mapping phase 52,<br>
general mapping of the left ventricular anatomy and<br>
electrical characteristics are undertaken. This includes<br>
mapping of the chamber in order to identify possible<br>
locations of channels or focal points that may trigger<br>
the ventricular tachycardia (or other arrhythmia). This<br>
can be done by acquiring voltage maps or recording other<br>
electrical properties of the tissue, e.g., mid-diastolic<br>
potentials. Additionally or alternatively, the mapping<br>
may be carried out by merging or importing images that<br>
were acquired by other modalities.<br>
 In a pace-mapping phase 54, selected<br>
points are stimulated and electrocardiographic signals<br>
obtained to observe the effect of the stimulation. Then,<br>
in a comparison phase 56, some numerical measure of<br>
similarity is automatically determined between the<br>
electrocardiographic signals obtained in the induction<br>
phase 50 and the pace-mapping phase 54. In one<br>
embodiment, the measure of numerical correlation is<br>
derived from the covariance, {cov(X, Y)) of the two ECG<br>
signals (X, Y), as explained in further detail<br>
hereinbelow.<br><br>
In another embodiment, a numerical method<br>
known as "principal component analysis" (PCA) is used to<br>
determine the correlation. This is described in further<br>
detail below. Briefly, the analysis is performed on a 12-<br>
lead body surface ECG recording of an induced signal.<br>
Three or four vectors are obtained, of which a<br>
combination can represent each of the induced signals<br>
recorded on a 12-lead body surface ECG. Similarity of the<br>
combination of the three or four vectors obtained in the<br>
principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the<br>
recorded induced signal can be used as a presentation of<br>
the 12-lead body surface ECG Pace Mapping. The normalized<br>
difference between the pace mapping and the represented<br>
pace mapping (using the vectors received from the<br>
principal component analysis on the induced signals<br>
recorded on the 12-lead body surface ECG) form the<br>
correlation values between corresponding leads.<br>
 Reference is now made to Fig. 4, which is<br>
a flow chart of a method of automatically detecting and<br>
quantifying arrhythmogenic foci associated with<br>
ventricular tachycardia in accordance with a disclosed<br>
embodiment of the invention. The method can be used<br>
similarly in focal and reentry variants that are known to<br>
be associated with ventricular tachycardia.<br>
Alternatively, the method can be applied using<br>
entrainment stimulation. Indeed, the method can be<br>
applied, to any arrhythmia that requires a comparison of<br>
signals for its evaluation. The order of the steps may be<br><br>
varied in practical embodiments. For example, recordings<br>
and correlation computations may be grouped.<br>
 At initial - step 58 an ECG is obtained<br>
while the subject is experiencing ventricular<br>
tachycardia. This may be a clinical episode.<br>
Alternatively, ventricular tachycardia may be induced<br>
conventionally, e.g., pharmacologically or invasively,<br>
using a combination of fast and early stimuli. In order<br>
to obtain induced signals, or subsequent to recording<br>
spontaneous or pharmacologically induced ventricular<br>
tachycardia, a catheter, e.g., the catheter 14 (Fig. 2)<br>
is introduced into the ventricular chamber. An<br>
electrocardiographic tracing showing ventricular<br>
tachycardia is obtained, typically a 12-lead<br>
electrocardiogram. Conventional signal . processing is<br>
applied to the electrocardiogram to obtain a digitized<br>
version. However, it will be apparent that the method is<br>
amenable to analog implementations. The following<br>
procedure is suitable for recording induced signals:<br>
record approximately 2.5 seconds of a 12-lead body<br>
surface ECG, independently of the . status of any mapping<br>
catheters. A beat buffer is used for induced signals,<br>
i.e., the last two to three minutes are loop recorded and<br>
can be stopped at any time in order to catch a transient<br>
arrhythmia. The operator can select relevant ECG<br>
components to save as a template. After saving the chosen<br>
beat, the non-selected beats may be discarded. Template<br>
construction is described in further detail hereinbelow.<br><br>
 At step 60, pace mapping is performed at a<br>
trial location in the ventricle, and a digitized<br>
electrocardiographic record obtained.<br>
 Preprocessing is carried out next at<br>
step 61. First, the pacemaker spike is removed. This can<br>
be done using a median filter. The pacemaker spike, if<br>
left in place, can distort the correlations that are to<br>
be calculated, and thereby produce misleading results.<br>
Next, one of the leads is selected for evaluation. First,<br>
a maximum peak is identified. Then all other peaks having<br>
a magnitude that differs by at least 0.1 mm from that of<br>
the maximum are identified. Subsequent correlation<br>
analysis is carried out to obtain the best correlation in<br>
a window-of-interest (WOI) of the induced signal with a<br>
WOI in the pace-mapped signals around a found peak usi.ng<br>
a shift of +-20ms. The procedure for calculating the<br>
correlation between induced signal (IS), . which defines a<br>
template, and the pace-mapped signal (PM) is as follows:<br>
 1. A user-defined PM correlation<br>
threshold (between 0 and 1) and a user defined<br>
Minimum Number of Leads (Min-PML) are set. By<br>
default the PMCT = 0.8, and Min-PML = 10). 2. Each lead of the PM set is<br>
compared by cross correlation with the<br>
corresponding lead of the region of interest<br>
marked on all templates. All comparisons are<br>
at the same timing within the PM signal. This<br><br>
results in a set of 12 numbers for each PM-Template pair.<br>
3.	The IS has a defined WOI.<br>
4.	Calculate all the peaks in the PM in a selected load.<br>
5.	Calculate the correlation between the IS with WOI and the PM with WOI<br>
defined around each peak with shift of +-20 ms.<br>
6.	Select the WOI with the best average correlation of all 12 leads.<br>
7.	Compare each lead's with the PMCT.<br>
8.	If at least Min-PML lads have correlations greater than PMCT, the average<br>
correlation us displayed, e.g., in a 3-dimensional map.<br>
At step 62 correlation coefficients are automatically determined between the<br>
records obtained in step 58 as explained above. The correlation coefficient is<br>
given by:<br><br>
where<br><br><br>
and<br><br>
Control now proceeds to decision step 64, where it is determined if the<br>
correlation coefficients determined in step 62 satisfy pre-defined criteria. Details<br>
of this determination are presented in further details hereinbelow.<br>
If the determination at decision step 64 is affirmative, then control proceeds to<br>
step 64 is affirmative, then control proceeds to step 66. The current location is<br>
marked as a possible arrhythmia triggering point or a possible point of a reentry<br>
path, and becomes a candidate for ablation. The time internal containing the<br>
correlated pattern is also marked.<br>
After performing step 66, or if the determination at decision step 64 was<br>
negative, control proceeds to decision step 68, where it is determined if more<br>
locations in the ventricle are to be studied. Typically many points, typically about<br>
24 or so are pace-mapped. Usually only a few of these become candidates for<br><br>
ablation. If the determination at decision step 68 is<br>
affirmative, then control returns to step 60.<br>
 If the determination at decision step 68<br>
is affirmative, then control proceeds to final step 70.<br>
The locations identified at step 66 may be ablated if<br>
medically indicated.<br>
 Reference is now made to Fig. 5, which is<br>
a detailed flow chart of a method for correlating pace-<br>
mapped electrocardiographic signals (PM) with induced<br>
electrocardiographic signals (IS), in accordance with a<br>
disclosed embodiment of the invention. The method is<br>
essentially an elaboration of step 62 (Fig. 4). The<br>
description that follows applies to one IS template;<br>
however, the procedure is typically iterated for each IS<br>
template that was generated, i.e., for each existing<br>
clinical arrhythmia.<br>
 The process steps are shown in a<br>
particular linear sequence in Fig. 5 for clarity of<br>
presentation. However, it will be evident that the leads<br>
may be ' efficiently be evaluated in parallel, and the<br>
order of the steps may be varied in practice. At initial<br>
step 72, a digitized 12-lead induced electrocardiographic<br>
signal and a digitized 12-lead pace-mapped<br>
electrocardiographic signal are obtained as described<br>
above.<br><br>
 Each lead of a PM signal taken from a<br>
location is compared by cross correlation with the<br>
corresponding lead of the region of .interest marked on a<br>
template. All comparisons are at the same timing within<br>
the PM signal. This results in a set of 12 numbers for<br>
each PM-Template pair compared.<br>
 Each lead' s correlation	with its<br>
corresponding lead is automatically	evaluated<br>
numerically. At step 74, a lead is	selected.<br>
Corresponding induced and pace-mapped signals	recorded at<br>
this lead are used in step 7 6, where a	correlation<br>
coefficient is computed as described above between the<br>
induced and pace-mapped signals.<br>
 Control now proceeds to decision step 78,<br>
where it is determined if a predefined pace-mapped<br>
correlation threshold (PMCT) was equaled or exceeded in<br>
the computation of step 76. Suitable values for the PMCT<br>
are about 0.9 or higher, and can be user defined.<br>
 If the determination at decision step 78<br>
is affirmative, then control proceeds to step 80. The<br>
number of qualifying leads (QL) is incremented.<br>
 After performing step 80, or if the<br>
determination at decision step 78 is negative, control<br>
proceeds to decision step 82, where it is determined if<br>
more leads are to be evaluated.<br><br>
If the determination at decision step 82<br>
is affirmative, then control returns to step 7 4 for<br>
another iteration.<br>
If the determination at decision step 82<br>
is affirmative, then control proceeds to decision<br>
step 84, where it is determined whether the number of<br>
qualifying leads that have been accumulated in iterations<br>
of step 80 is at least a pre-defined minimum number of<br>
leads (Min-PML). Suitable values for Min-PML<br>
are about 10-11. These values can be modified by the user<br>
if desired.<br>
If the determination at step decision<br>
step 84 is affirmative, then control proceeds to final<br>
step 86. The location associated with the PM signal is<br>
identified as an abnormal focus or pathway (channel)<br>
associated with ventricular tachycardia.<br>
If the determination at decision step 84<br>
is negative, then control proceeds to final step 88. The<br>
procedure has failed to associate the location associated<br>
with the PM signal as an abnormal focus or pathway<br>
associated with ventricular tachycardia.<br>
Correlation Displays<br>
Correlation displays are generated<br>
indicating the correlation of pace-mapped ECG's with the<br>
ECG obtained in initial step 58 (Fig. 4) . Reference is<br><br>
now made to Fig..'6, which illustrates a correlation<br>
display of electrocardiographic signals as a comparison<br>
window 90, in accordance with a disclosed embodiment of<br>
the invention. VT templates as shown on the window 90 are<br>
prepared for each type of VT complex recorded as an<br>
induced signal or spontaneously. In this example, a point<br>
PM.l has been selected. The display provides an option to<br>
scroll through all the PM's (whether their correlation is<br>
above or below the PMCT) . For each lead, the correlation<br>
between the current template and the PM is displayed, as<br>
well as the average correlation for all leads. Colors<br>
differentiate IS from PM signals. By default, both<br>
signals are superimposed so that the portions of the<br>
signals on which the correlation was calculated are on<br>
top of each other. In one embodiment, it is possible to<br>
horizontally scroll the display of the PM signal, while<br>
the iS signal remains static. Thus, the PM to IS<br>
correlations, which appears to "slide" in real time, can<br>
be explored visually as shown in Fig. 9 (described<br>
below) . Additionally any IS may be superimposed over<br>
another IS in order to assist the user in judging their<br>
similarity and validate the automatic assessment of<br>
template identification.<br>
 Once the user has released a scrolling<br>
control, all correlations for the current VT template-PM<br>
pair are recalculated and saved. Furthermore, the<br>
automatic correlation between the IS and PM signal may be<br>
recalculated at any time at the user's option.<br><br>
 Any VT template-PM pair having a negative<br>
correlation is automatically marked "not for display".<br>
This sotting cannot be overridden unless the .user has<br>
manually found a positive correlation. It is possible to<br>
change the time, scale in a window. Any such change<br>
affects all leads at the same time.<br>
	Reference is now made to Fig. 7, which is<br>
a composite graphic display of correlation results in<br>
accordance with a disclosed embodiment of the invention.<br>
This display is typically prepared following performance<br>
of the methods disclosed above. Three ECG vector •<br>
representations 92, 94, 96 are shown. Similarity results<br>
are indicated by asterisks on each vector. Negative<br>
correlations are marked on the negative side of the axis.<br>
Template Construction<br>
 Templates are constructed from induced<br>
signals recording. As noted above, one records<br>
approximately 2.5 seconds of 12-lead body surface ECG<br>
recording during the setup phase, and independent of the<br>
status of any internal catheters to ensure an accurate<br>
visual framework for mapping diagnostic procedures. These<br>
signals are not associated with any catheter location.<br>
	As noted above, it is desirable to have a<br>
beat buffer for IS signals, similar to the current beat<br>
buffer for the points, i.e., 10 beats are frozen with<br>
each signal, the user can select the beat to save. After<br>
saving, the non-selected beats are lost. While typically<br><br>
done by a human operator, in some embodiments the<br>
selection may be done automatically using conventional<br>
morphologic analysis techniques, e.g., pattern<br>
recognition.<br>
 The time of acquisition is recorded with<br>
the IS signal (hh:mm).<br>
 Typically, about five induced signals are<br>
recorded. A maximum of 4 0 IS may normally be recorded.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 8, which is an<br>
exemplary 12-lead tracing showing an induced signal, in accordance with a disclosed embodiment of the invention.<br>
A stimulus is referenced by an arrow 98 and a resulting<br>
ventricular complex indicated by an arrow 100. A window<br>
of interest is framed by vertical lines 102, 104.<br>
 Reference is now made to Fig. 9, which is<br>
a series of tracings similar to Fig. 8, with<br>
superimposition of two series of signals to visually<br>
indicate correlations, in accordance with a disclosed<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
 For the first IS signal, the user marks<br>
the complex of interest with horizontal calipers or a<br>
similar tool. The default is from the first peak of the<br>
lead II (positive or negative) +/- 150 ms. If the first<br>
peak on lead II is less than 150 ms from the beginning of<br>
the data recording, the next peak is used. Alternatively,<br>
the complex of interest can be identified automatically<br><br>
using conventional peak recognition techniques in the<br>
art, after which the operator confirms the result.<br>
 The first IS signal is automatically<br>
marked as a template.<br>
 Each additional IS is automatically<br>
checked for similarity with the window of interest of all<br>
existing templates. Similarity is checked with cross<br>
correlation for each lead separately, and for all leads<br>
on the same section of the signal (from a timing point of<br>
view).<br>
 There is a user defined IS correlation<br>
threshold (between 0 and 1) and a user-defined minimum<br>
number of leads (Min-ISL) . The default I.SCT - 0.9;'<br>
default Min-ISL = 10-11. Each lead's correlation is<br>
tested against the ISCT.<br>
 If at least Min-ISL have correlation<br>
coefficients that are greater than ISCT, the signals are<br>
considered similar and the new IS is not marked as a<br>
template .-<br>
Otherwise, the new IS is marked as a<br>
template. The default area of interest is that found by<br>
the correlation, and it can be changed by the user.<br>
 The average correlation - coefficient is<br>
calculated and presented.<br><br>
 The user may override the automatic<br>
template assignment (i.e., if the SW marked it as a<br>
template, it may be unmarked, and vice versa) .<br>
 Each IS can have a unique label of four or<br>
fewer characters. The label will not be removed if the IS<br>
is selected or deselected as a template. If ISCT or Min-<br>
ISL are changed while acquiring templates, the system<br>
recalculates correlations and marks the IS as templates<br>
accordingly.<br>
 Manual selections (or deselections) by the<br>
user may be saved.<br>
Pace-mapping Procedure<br>
 One records approximately 2.5 seconds<br>
of 12-lead body surface ECG without the need to "freeze"<br>
a point O'f the tracing in time.<br>
 It is desirable to have a beat buffer for<br>
PM signals, similar to the current beat buffer for the<br>
points, i.e., 10 beats are frozen with each signal. The<br>
user can select the beat to save. After saving, the non-<br>
selected beats are normally discarded.<br>
 The time of acquisition is recorded with<br>
the PM signal.<br><br>
 One associates the PM signals with a<br>
point, i.e., a location. If no point is selected, the PM<br>
is associated with the last point acquired.<br>
 A PM tag is added to the point with a PM<br>
associated with it. If CardioLabw integration is<br>
available, this tag is also sent to the CardioLab system.<br>
The above-noted beat buffer from the same or a different<br>
study may be stored on the CardioLab (or similar) system,<br>
and can be imported when required.<br>
 Beside each PM tag a label indicates to<br>
which template it best correlates.<br>
 The PM tag label is shown independently to<br>
the other tag labels. PM signals are numbered<br>
consecutively.<br>
 Only one PM signal may be associated with<br>
each point. A PM signal cannot be associated with more<br>
than one point.<br>
 When a point is copied or moved to another<br>
map, all its links are copied with it.<br>
 When a point is deleted, all the links for<br>
this point are deleted. If the point is restored, the<br>
links need to be re-established automatically.<br><br>
 PM signals are normally saved with the<br>
study.<br>
 PM 12 lead signals may be printed. The<br>
name of the patient, date and time of acquisition are<br>
printed with it.<br>
Functional Maps<br>
	In one aspect of the invention maps are<br>
displayed showing in which correlations of pace-mapped<br>
locations and IS templates are indicated by a color<br>
scale. Construction of functional maps may be<br>
accomplished using known methods; for example, those<br>
taught in the above-noted U.S. Patent Nos. 6,226,542,<br>
and 6,301,496.<br>
 Reference is now made to Fig. 10, which is<br>
a functional map of the left ventricle of a heart,<br>
illustrating cross-correlation between a pace-mapped<br>
signal and an induced signal in accordance with a<br>
disclosed embodiment of the invention. Correlation<br>
parameters and measurements are shown in a dialog box 106<br>
in the upper left portion of the figure. The degree of<br>
cross correlation may be interpreted with reference to a<br>
color scale 108. On the correlation map, a pacing point<br>
is defined as the best average correlation value between<br>
induced signals and a pace-mapped signal.<br><br>
	Superimposition of a correlation map with<br>
a CARTO map	used to define a scarred area assists the<br>
operator in	choosing a site for ablation, and choosing<br>
the order of	points to ablate.<br>
 Reference is now made to Fig. 11, which is<br>
a functional map. of the left ventricle shown in Fig. 10.<br>
Here color-coded balls 118, also known as "point tags",<br>
represent pace-mapped points that exceed the correlation<br>
threshold of significance. Differently color-coded<br>
balls 120 represent points designated for ablation.<br>
Alternatively, other types of markings may be substituted<br>
for the balls 118, 120.<br>
Principal Component Analysis<br>
 In the above-noted PCA correlation method,<br>
the algorithm objective is to locate similarity between a<br>
first set of signals - identified with the relevant<br>
tachycardia (training set) and a second set of body<br>
surface ECG leads signals, while pacing from the heart<br>
(tested set).<br>
The training set is used to generate a set<br>
of signals, that encapsulate most of the information.<br>
Principle component analysis and optionally Independent<br>
Component Analysis (ICA) are used to generate a set of<br>
base functions. Both of these techniques are well-known<br>
computational methods, and are therefore not further<br>
discussed herein. These functions are validated to span<br><br>
the whole instances of the training set where the input<br>
signal is estimated as with good enough accuracy. In<br>
order tor PCA and ICA to operate optimally, preprocessing<br>
is performed that cuts the signals into segments that<br>
represent only one cycle of the ECG. A scaling and offset<br>
removal transfers the sections into a more uniform signal<br>
space, which results in the set. Using the base functions<br>
encapsulates most of the information, while rejecting<br>
sections of sparse morphology.<br>
 To look for correlation between a test set<br>
and the training, the test set passes the through above-<br>
described preprocessing procedure, and sections are<br>
generated. The base functions are then used to estimate<br>
the coefficients that best represent the signal.<br>
 If the representation is not accurate<br>
enough, it is assumed to be non-correlated with the<br>
training set. Otherwise, a correlation is made over all<br>
the leads simultaneously. In this way the regulation of<br>
the base function improves the observability between<br>
signals with different morphology by excluding sections<br>
that are sparse and produce a low correlation for<br>
corresponding signals. On the other hand, it causes a<br>
much smaller correlation in unlike signals due to<br>
amplification of the common dissimilar morphology.<br><br>
Alternate Embodiment 1<br>
	Referring again to Fig. 1, in this<br>
embodiment a cardiologist paces the heart at different<br>
locations in the ventricle while observing a 12-lead<br>
body-surface ECG, as described above. Upon observing a<br>
suspicious pattern in the ECG (containing tachycardia or<br>
other arrhythmic components), the cardiologist signals<br>
the system 10 to mark the time interval containing the<br>
suspicious pattern as well as the pacing location at<br>
which the pattern occurred. Multiple intervals may be<br>
marked in this manner. The system 10 then learns the<br>
characteristics of the suspicious ECG pattern.<br>
 Subsequently, the cardiologist scans the<br>
pacing catheter over the inner wall of the ventricle,<br>
while the system 10 monitors and analyzes the ECG signals<br>
to detect further occurrences of the pattern it has<br>
learned. The system 10 marks any locations at which the<br>
pattern recurs as possible VT foci. The cardiologist may<br>
then ablate these foci or conduct further studies around<br>
the focal locations.<br>
 The system 10 may learn the pattern of the<br>
local electrograms sensed using the catheter 14 at the<br>
suspected VT foci that are marked by the cardiologist.<br>
The catheter signal at different locations in the<br>
ventricle may then be analyzed for recurrence of this<br>
local electrogram pattern, in addition to or instead of<br>
the ECG.<br><br>
 Reference is now made to Fig. 12, which is<br>
a flow chart of a method for identifying abnormal ECG<br>
patterns such as VT patterns in accordance with an<br>
alternate embodiment of the invention. At initial<br>
step 22 9, pacing is performed at trial locations, as<br>
described above.<br>
 Control now proceeds to decision step 231,<br>
where it is determined if a suspicious pattern has been<br>
detected. If the determination at decision step 231 is<br>
negative, then control returns to initial step 229 and<br>
pacing continues at new locations. VT patterns that are<br>
identified or automatically identified and confirmed by<br>
expert cardiologists may be stored in a library of<br>
patterns. This library may then be distributed to other<br>
cardiologists for their use in automatic identification<br>
and treatment of possible VT foci at decision step 231.<br>
 If the determination at decision step 231<br>
is affirmative, then control proceeds to step 233, where<br>
the new pattern is learned automatically.<br>
 Subsequently, at final step 235, which may<br>
be performed, for example, after an attempt at ablation,<br>
pacing is repeated at new locations in the heart, in<br>
order to determine whether the abnormal pattern persists<br>
or has recurred.<br><br>
 In this embodiment, a reference signal is<br>
obtained as described above. Referring again to Fig. 1,<br>
the processor 23 displays the measured ECG signals to a<br>
physician. The physician identifies an exemplary<br>
occurrence of a pattern of interest in the displayed<br>
signals and indicates the time interval containing the<br>
pattern to the system. The methods and systems of this<br>
embodiment relieve the physician of the tedious and time-<br>
consuming task of manually scanning lengthy ECG signal<br>
traces to detect a pattern of interest. Moreover, these<br>
methods and systems are based on automatic analysis of an<br>
exemplary pattern and not on an explicit quantitative<br>
definition of the pattern, which is sometimes difficult<br>
to specify.<br>
 The processor 23 operates as a pattern<br>
processor, which analyzes the time interval and produces<br>
a characteristic signature of the pattern. Typically, the<br>
processor divides the time interval into multiple<br>
segments along the time axis and calculates a signal<br>
characteristic in each of the segments. The processor<br>
uses the sequence of signal characteristics of the<br>
different segments as the pattern signature. For example,<br>
the signal characteristic may comprise an indication<br>
whether the signal increases or decreases in the segment.<br>
 The processor 23 scans the ECG signal and<br>
detects other occurrences of the pattern of interest. The<br>
processor 23 identifies time intervals, in which the<br>
signal matches the pattern signature. The pattern<br><br>
signature may comprise a string, in which the signal<br>
characteristic value of each segment is represented by a<br>
corresponding character. In these embodiments, the<br>
processor detects occurrences of the pattern using a<br>
string matching process. The detected pattern occurrences<br>
are marked and displayed to the physician.<br>
 Additionally or alternatively, the pattern<br>
of: interest may be provided externally, such as from a<br>
library of characteristic ECG patterns. The system 10 can<br>
also be used to define a library of patterns that have<br>
been found to be associated with certain types of<br>
pathologies or events. This library may be distributed to<br>
other cardiologists or systems for use in processing ECG<br>
signals gathered from other patients.<br>
 Reference is now made to Fig. 13, which is<br>
a diagram that schematically illustrates an exemplary<br>
screenshot display of system 10, as displayed to the<br>
physician on display 44, in accordance with an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The figure shows twelve ECG<br>
signals originating from twelve electrodes 32' (Fig. 1).<br>
Two patterns of interest, denoted "new signal 2" and "new<br>
signal 4" have been previously defined by the physician.<br>
Processor 23 simultaneously detects occurrences of the<br>
two patterns in the ECG signals. In the present example,<br>
the detected occurrences are marked using shaded areas on<br>
the displayed ECG signals. Alternatively, the occurrences<br>
can be marked using any other suitable indication, such<br>
as using different color, icons or highlighted areas.<br><br>
 Occurrences of the "new signal 2" pattern<br>
are denoted 50A and marked with a certain shading<br>
pattern, while occurrences of the "new signal 4" pattern<br>
are denoted SOB and marked with a different pattern. The<br>
quality or confidence level of the match is indicated as<br>
a percentage next to each occurrence.<br>
A fitting window 52 shows the matching of<br>
a particular occurrence to the pattern of interest.<br>
Curves 54 and 56 respectively show the pattern and one of<br>
the occurrences, laid one on top of the other. Various<br>
controls 58 enable the physician to freeze the displayed<br>
ECG signals, select a particular occurrence, add another<br>
pattern of interest, etc. In alternative embodiments, any<br>
other suitable man-machine interface features and methods<br>
can be used.<br>
ECG signal analysis method<br>
 Reference is now made to Fig. 14, which is<br>
a flow chart that schematically illustrates a method for<br>
analyzing ECG signals, in accordance with an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The method begins with<br>
system 10 acquiring an ECG signal, at an acquisition<br>
step 60. The acquired signal is displayed to the<br>
operator, either in real time or off-line. The operator<br>
identifies and marks a time interval that contains a<br>
pattern of interest, at a pattern indication step 62.<br><br>
	Processor 23 divides the time interval,<br>
marked by the operator .into multiple segments, at a<br>
segmentation step 64. The pattern processor characterizes<br>
the KCG signal in each of the segments and produces a<br>
pattern signature based on the sequence of signal<br>
characteristics, at a signature generation step 66. For<br>
example, the processor may determine, for each segment,<br>
whether the signal increases or decreases along the<br>
segment. The processor can then generate a sequence of<br>
"ascending" and "descending" indications, which is used<br>
as a characteristic signature of the pattern of interest.<br>
In these embodiments, the number of segments is typically<br>
selected with sufficient resolution, so that the signal.<br>
insi.de each segment is likely to be monotonous.<br>
 Additionally or alternatively, the<br>
processor 23 can use any other suitable parameter in<br>
order to characterize the different segments, such as the<br>
positive' or negative slope of the signal within the<br>
segment. In some embodiments, processor 23 represents the<br>
pattern signature as a string, in which each segment is<br>
represented by a character. For example, a segment in<br>
which the signal increases can be represented by a "U" .<br>
character. A segment in which the signal decreases can be<br>
represented by a "D" character. The characters<br>
representing the segments are then concatenated to form a<br>
string such as "UDDUUDUDU...UUD", which is used as a<br>
signature.<br><br>
	In some embodiments, processor 23 measures<br>
one or more scaling parameters of the ECG signal in the<br>
marked time interval. These scaling parameters are stored<br>
together with the signature and are later used for<br>
matching other occurrences of the pattern. For example,<br>
the mean amplitude of the signal can be used as a scaling<br>
parameter. Additionally or alternatively, the processor<br>
may calculate a spectrum of the pattern of interest and<br>
determine one or more dominant frequencies in the<br>
spectrum. The dominant frequencies can be used as scaling<br>
parameters.<br>
 Having generated the pattern signature,<br>
processor 23 scans the ECG signal and attempts to detect<br>
other occurrences of the pattern of interest, at a<br>
scanning step 68. Depending on the system configuration<br>
used, processor 23 may monitor real time or buffered ECG<br>
measurements as they are acquired, or scan in an off-line<br>
manner through a body of previously measured ECG signals.<br>
 The processor scales a portion of the<br>
scanned ECG signal responsively to the scaling parameters<br>
of the pattern of interest, at a scaling step 70. For<br>
example, the processor may normalize the mean amplitude<br>
of the scanned signal to match the mean amplitude of the<br>
pattern of interest. As another example, the processor<br>
may perform spectral scaling of the scanned signal, so<br>
that its dominant frequencies match the dominant<br>
frequencies of the pattern of interest. Spectral scaling<br>
can be viewed as scaling (i.e., stretching or<br><br>
compressing) the time axis of the scanned signal with<br>
respect to the time axis of the pattern of interest. The<br>
processor may compute a fast Fourier transform (FFT) of<br>
the scanned signal portion for this purpose.<br>
 Processor 23 attempts to find intervals in<br>
the scanned ECG signal that match the pattern signature,<br>
at a matching step 72. For example, when the pattern of<br>
interest is represented using a string, the processor<br>
divides the scanned and scaled signaJ. portion into<br>
segments, characterizes each segment and assigns a<br>
character to each segment. The scanned signal portion is<br>
thus represented by a long string of characters. Then,<br>
the processor attempts to find the sub-string that<br>
represents the pattern signature in the string that<br>
represents the scanned signal portion. Any suitable<br>
string matching process known in the art can be used for<br>
this purpose. Each match is considered to be an<br>
occurrence of the pattern in the scanned signal.<br>
 Processor 23 marks the detected<br>
occurrences on display 44, at an occurrence indication<br>
step 74. Typically, the processor marks the time<br>
intervals that are detected as pattern occurrences. Since<br>
the processor may search for several patterns<br>
simultaneously, the pattern being detected is indicated<br>
next to each occurrence. In some embodiments, each<br>
occurrence is also given a unique name or number that is<br>
displayed. The processor may also display a confidence<br><br>
level or a quality metric of the match next to each<br>
detected occurrence.<br>
 Although the description of this<br>
embodiment mainly addresses identifying patterns in an<br>
ECG signal, the principles of the present invention can<br>
also be used for detecting- patterns in • other<br>
physiological signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG)<br>
and respiratory signals.<br>
Alternate Embodiment 2<br>
 In this embodiment, instead of using a<br>
conventional body surface electrocardiogram,<br>
electrocardiographic signals are captured using remote<br>
interrogation of implanted patient devices, typically<br>
intracardiac devices (ICDs) such as defibrillators,<br>
cardioverters, and pacemakers. Such devices may be<br>
provided with memories for storing signals that reflect<br>
cardiac events. Historic signals are downloaded as<br>
recorded (historic) signals or in realtime to a<br>
processing system and compared with induced signal<br>
patterns (a first type of realtime signal) and with pace<br>
mapped patterns (a second type of realtime signal). The<br>
historic signals may include spontaneous episodes of<br>
ventricular tachycardia. In some embodiments, the signals<br>
may be transmitted to and stored on a server and then<br>
transferred to the processing system. A suitable<br>
intracardiac device for capturing the signals is the<br><br>
Medtronic InSync® ICD. Other suitable devices are<br>
commercially available.<br>
	Reference is now made to Fig. 15, which is<br>
a pictorial diagram of a representative arrangement for<br>
remotely identifying abnormal ECG patterns in. accordance<br>
with an alternate embodiment of the invention. Other<br>
conventional methods of transferring data between an<br>
ICD 250 and processing system 2 60, for example USB<br>
communications or even removable storage media.<br>
Alternatively, the communication may be achieved by a<br>
dedicated device that is adapted to directly interrogate<br>
the ICD 250.<br>
 To capture a realtime electrocardiographic<br>
signal, the ICD 250 band-pass filters (e.g., 2.5 - 100<br>
Hz) and samples the signals at 128 - 256 Hz. A sampling<br>
rate of 256 Hz or higher is preferable. A processing and<br>
programming device 255 is used to receive the sampled<br>
signal, and then upsampled. A first upsampling to 4 00 Hz<br>
and a second to about .7 kHz are suitable. A<br>
Medtronic 2090 programmer may be used as the device 255<br>
for interrogation of the ICD 250 and wired or linked by<br>
wireless telemetry to the processing system 260, which<br>
can be the above-noted CARTO XP EP Navigation and<br>
Ablation System. Different combinations of wired and<br>
wireless links between the ICD 250, the device 255 and<br>
the processing system 260 may be used.<br><br>
 According to one alternative, the<br>
upsampled signal is then converted into an analog<br>
signal 2 62, for example using a model 7 808 digital-to-<br>
analog converter (DAC) (not shown) , which is then<br>
telemetered to the processing system 260.<br>
 In another alternative, the upsampled<br>
signal is converted from serial data 2 65 by a<br>
converter 270 (C-box) to a digital format 275 suitable<br>
for network transmission, for example the Ethernet<br>
protocol. The processing system 260 is provided with a<br>
suitable receiver for accepting the Ethernet signals (or<br>
analog signals) . This method has the advantage of using<br>
an industry standard, but does present time<br>
synchronization issues. In the current embodiment, the<br>
Ethernet protocol can concurrently support up to 10 ECG<br>
channels. Command exchange between the processing<br>
system 260 and the device 255 requires a separate<br>
channel 28 5.<br>
 The signals received by the device 255 are<br>
processed by processing system 260 for comparison with<br>
another set of electrocardiographic signals captured by<br>
the ICD 250 during a current or previous pace mapping<br>
session. The results may be correlated with IS signals<br>
captured by the ICD leads or with VT morphologies in ICD-<br>
stored events, captured from the ICD 250 or from a<br>
different source. Alternatively, the signals can be<br><br>
correlated with a library of patterns, both alternatives<br>
being described above.<br>
	In some embodiments, the location at which<br>
correlation and analysis is done may even be remote from<br>
the site at which pace-mapping is done. In such case, the<br>
pace-mapped signals described above may also be<br>
transmitted to the analysis location using the same or a<br>
different communications protocol.<br>
 It will be appreciated by persons skilled<br>
in the art that the present invention is not limited to<br>
what has been particularly shown and described<br>
hereinabove. Rather, the scope of the present invention<br>
includes both combinations and sub-comb.lnat.ions of the<br>
various features described hereinabove, as well as<br>
variations and modifications thereof that are not in the<br>
prior art, which would occur to persons skilled in the<br>
art upon reading the foregoing description.<br><br>
