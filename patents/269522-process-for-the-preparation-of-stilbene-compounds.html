				<td>Field of the invention:<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel stilbene derivatives and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Furthermore, the purpose of this invention is also to provide a process for the preparation of said novel derivatives.<br><br>
Back ground of the invention<br><br>
Various analogs of stilbene as core moiety are mentioned in WO 01/21165 Al, US 5,525,632 as anti-tumor substances. The substance, the synthesis, the use and the advantages of 3, 5, 3', 4', 5'-substituted and related analogs of the present invention, are not disclosed in the art. The present inventors have already accomplished the 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyl stilbene derivatives and mentioned in their co pending Indian application numbered 1766/CHE/2008.<br><br>
Resveratrol (trans-3, 5, 4'- Trihydroxy stilbene), a compound found largely in the skins of red grapes, has been shown to have chemo preventive activity against cardiovascular disease and a variety of cancers, but it is not clear whether the drug reaches the proposed sites of action in vivo after oral ingestion, especially in humans.<br><br>
Pterostilbene (trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystilbene), is a dimelhylated analogue of resveratrol, a stilbene shown to have anti-cancer activity across many cell lines and it is a naturally occurring stilbene found in deer berry and rabbit eye blueberries, several varieties of grapes, and in the tree species Pterocarpusmarsupium and Guibourtia tessmanii. In addition, pterostilbene has also been demonstrated to have anti-diabetic and anti-oxidant properties. Hypoglycemic activity of a naturally occurring pterostilbene, trans-l-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy phenyl ) -ethylene, isolated from the heartwood of pterocarpus marsupium has been reported by Manickam et al., J. Nat. Prod., 1997,60:609-610.<br><br>
H. Yang et al performed in vitro screens for stilbenes that could modulate human SIRTl and Howitz et al examined structure-activity relationship of SIRTl activation by stilbenes. Resveratrol derivatives such as 4' hydroxyl is replaced with thiomethyl group (3,5-dihydroxy-4'-thiomethyl-/row-stilbene), methyl (3,5-dihydroxy-4'-methyl-/r^w-stilbene) and ethyl (3, 5-dihydroxy-4'-ethyl-fra^-stilbene) have been disclosed by H. Yang 'et al Methoxy group at 4' position (3, 5-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-fraw.y-stilbene) , showing similar resveratrol activity, but the derivative 3, 5-dihydroxy-4'-acetoxy-/rflÂ«i'-stilbene is the least potent due to the presence of an ester group, which is relatively large volume at the 4s- position.<br><br>
It is evident by the art that the resveratrol as well as pterostilbene have less absorption due to low water solubility and bioavailability. Due to less bioavailability and low solubility of the drugs mentioned, the fraction of an administered dose of unchanged drug that reaches the systemic circulation is less. It is particularly due to incomplete absorption and first-pass metabolism.<br><br>
Bioavailability is one of the essential tools in pharmacokinetics, as bioavailability must be considered when calculating dosages for non-intravenous routes of administration. The two major hurdles including low water solubility found with the known compounds need to be resolved. As an alternative, these novel derivatives have been made. The said novel compounds have proven their value as active ingredients since they act as anti-tumor substances and been shown to have advantageous properties such as high water solubility and bioavailability that must be required in order to determine that the compounds are pharmacokinetically acceptable.<br><br>

In the synthesis of stilbene analogs of the present invention, the general method typically involves the condensation of aromatic aldeheyde with phosphonate esters leads to olefins with excellent -selectivity.<br><br>
Using Wittig-Horner reaction, aromatic aldehyde (V) is condensed with phopshonate ester (IV) in a suitable solvent such as terahydrofuran (THF) in presence of suitable bases for forming the ylide. Butyl lithium (BuLi), sodium hydride (NaH) and sodium methoxide (NaOMe) are identified as suitable bases. Out of which, NaH in THF at optimized conditions affords the acceptable yield of single (Â£)-stilbene analog (I) as compared to the other bases.<br><br>
The resulting phosphate byproduct is readily separated by simply washing with water leaving the desired selective trans isomer.<br><br>
Starting from substituted benzoic acid (II), the methyl ester compounds (III) are prepared in good yield using methylating agents such as dimethyl sulphate, dimethyl carbonate and the like. In order to be eco-friendly, or green, DMC is a safe substitute for dimethyl sulfate as it yields by-products that are hard to dispose of. Preparation of methyl ester from substituted carboxylic acids is carried out efficiently with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) which can be accelerated by using sulphuric acid as catalyst.<br><br>
The methyl ester thus obtained now is subjected to reduction in order to obtain corresponding alcohol compound. The reducing agents used for this purpose are sodium borohydride or lithium aluminum hydride or the like, preferably in ether solvents. The primary alcohol can optionally be isolated or it can be used without being isolated for further reaction.<br><br><br>
The substituted benzyl alcohol is now halogenated in a suitable solvents for example toluene or dichloromethane, in presence of halogenating agents such as thionyl chloride or Phosphorus tribromide leads to the formation of substituted benzyl halide. In view of economic aspects and corrosive nature of halide compounds, it is recommended not to isolate these halo compounds.<br><br>
The phosphonate esters (IV), which serve as key precursors for Wittig-Horner reaction, are prepared from the reaction between triethyl phosphite P(OEt&gt;3 and foregoing substituted benzyl halide in presence of suitable solvents for example dioxane, THF or toluene. The total process is depicted in the following scheme:<br><br><br>
Reagents and conditions: (a) dimethyl carbonate, catalytic amount of H2S04l reflux, 6hr. (b) NaBH/THF, McOH, reflux, 3hr.(c) PBr3, toluene, room temperature, 1 hr. (d) triphenyl phosphate, toluene, reflux , 3 hr.(e) NaH, THF<br><br>
The present invention will now be defined in more detail by way of following examples, which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting.<br><br>

An oven-dried RB flask was charged with Pd2(dba)3 (0.58 g, 0.00062 mol, 0.02 eq), xanthphos (0.09 g, 0.00015 mol, 0.005 eq), l-[(Â£)-2-(4-bromophenyl)-l-ethenyl]-3,5-dimethoxybenzene (10 g, 0.031 mol, leq), cesium carbonate (20 g, 0.062 mol, 2 eq), morpholine (2.7 g, 0.031 mol, 1 eq), toluene (\00 mL) was degassed for about 30 min. The mixture refluxed for 8 h, during which time the solution turned from purple to deep brown. The reaction was monitored by removing small aliquots, which were analyzed by TLC. The reaction mass was filtered through a short pad of silica and toluene removed in vacuo, the residue was purified by column chromatography (ethyl acetate-hexane, 1:3, v/v) to give 4-(4-3, 5-dimethoxy styryl phenyl) morpholine as a pale yellow-colored solid. Yield 4.1 g (40%).<br><br>
