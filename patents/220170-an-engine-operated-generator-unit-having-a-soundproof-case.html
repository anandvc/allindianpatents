				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an engine-operited generator covered by a soundproof case in rts.ienti.rety.<br>
The engine-operated generator in which an engine a generator driven by the engine are integrated is used a construction work site generally. And in consideration influences to the surroundings when it is operated in a c area especially at night, an engine-operated generator cove by a soundproof case in its entirety has been used widely order to restrain operation noise as low as possible.<br>
In this kind of engine-operated generator, openi for suctioning or discharging air are made few in number small in size to achieve necessary silence during operati But on the one hand, it is necessary to devote great care cooling interior of the soundproof case because the area the opening i s smal1.<br>
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 64-3777 disclc an engine-operated generator in which an engine and a muff are covered by a duct to be isolated from other instrume and cooling air is forcibly passed through the duct discharged at the side of the muffler out of the soundpr case so that high temperature discharge of the cooling air prevented from recirculating into the soundproof case.<br>
However, as for an generator placed outside of the c in the soundproof case, it is necessary to provide anot cooling air passage than the above duct or an exclusive cool fan for the generator, and therefore the engine-opera generator is caused to be large-sized.<br>
In the engine-operated generator of the Japanese Util Model Publication No. 64-3777, a fan for cooling the genera is provided separately from a cooling fan for passing forcibly through the duct covering the engine and the muffl and air discharged from the fan for cooling the generator joined in the duct after cooling the generator. Therefo<br>
and<br>
there is a problem that the air from the generator cooling is required a certain high discharge pressure to join in duct and it is not necessarily an efficient cooling syst<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been accomplished in view of the foregoing and one object of the invention is to provide a compact engine-operated generator having a high soundproof effect in which a generator can be cooled efficiently as will as an engine and a muffler.<br>
In order to attain the above object, the present invention provides an engine-operated generator having an engine and a generator driven by the engine arranged in a direction of a rotary shaft and accommodated in a soundproof case, wherein the generator, the engine and a muffler are arranged in or|er within the soundproof case and covered by a duct to be isolated from other instruments in the soundproof case; the duct r|as an end on the side of the generator opening to an interior of the soundproof case and another end on the side of the muff'er opening to an exterior of the soundproof case; and a coolipg fan is driven by the engine so that air in the soundproof Ccbe is inhaled into the duct, cools the generator, the engine and the muffler in order and then is discharged through an opening of the duct on the side of the muffler to the exterior.<br>
Since the air inhaled into the duct through the opening on the side of the generator cools the generator of relatively low temperature firstly and then cools in order the engine a|d the muffler of higher temperature to be discharged through tie opening on the side of the muffler to the exterior, the generator is cooled efficiently as well as the engine and the muff lei.<br>
A high soundproof effect can be achieved because tie engine is covered by the duct and the soundproof case doubll. The generator, the engine and the muffler need only to |e arranged in order within the duct and they may be arranged in a L-shape, for example, utilizing space within the soundproof case efficiently to make the apparatus compact.<br>
The generator may be an outer-rotor type generator rikving<br>
an outer-rotor which serves as an flywheel of the engin the cooling fan may be provided in the opening of the du<br><br>
the side of the generator integrally with the outer-rotor.<br>
Since the outer-rotor of the generator serves ais flywheel of the engine, length of the engine-operated genelator in the axial direction can be made short. Since the coc<br>
fan is attached to the outer-rotor integrally, a cooling<br>
of  large capacity can be provided easily and a high  supporting strength for the fan can be obtained.<br>
The engine may have a cylinder inclined sidel/ays obliquely and the muffler may be disposed in a space above the cylinder.<br>
Since a large muffler can be disposed in the space vlnich is formed above the engine by inclining the cylinder, the size in the vertical direction as well as the size in the a|ial direction can be restrained small to attempt miniaturization of the apparatus. Further, a reasonable cooling air stream can be generated for efficient cooling, because the ho|ter portion is positioned at the higher position.<br>
The muffler may be elongated in a direction perpendic to a rotary shaft of the engine.    The muffler of  large capai can be disposed  in the space above the  inclined cylinder fith the vsytical   size of the apparatus  restrained small.<br>
The  generator may  be an  outer-rotor  type multip generator having  a magnet   rotor,   and a control   circuit converting an output of  the generator  into an alternating curi of a predetermined frequency may be provided.<br>
It  is possible to make  the axial   size  of  the generc small   and lower the rotational  speed of the generator when load is not  large  to  reduce operation noise greatly.Accordingly the present invention relates to an Engine-operated generator unit wherein a soundproof case encloses therein a cooling fan, a generator, an engine for driviiig both the generator and the cooling fan, and a muffler, which are disposed in this order, wherein a duct for cooling lair is provided in the soundproof case to extend from a rejion of<br><br>
said cooling fan to a region of said muffler in a mai  <br>
enclose the cooling fan, the generator, the engine  <br>
muffler, and wherein said duct has at an upstream end<br><br>
a suction opening located within the soundproof case a]  <br>
downstream end thereof a discharge hole communicating • exterior of the soundproof case; characterized in that: said  duct  for  cooling  air  extends  horizontall continuously and surrounds outer peripheries of the fan,  the generator,  the engine and the muffler in<br>
manner  as  to  constantly  isolate  the  cooling  faif, generator,  the  engine  and  the  muffler  from  instruments<br>
disposed  in  a  space  defined  between  the  duct  a did  the<br>
I<br>
soundproof case and so as to cause cooling air sucked through said suction opening by the cooling fan to flow into tMe duct through the generator, the engine and the muffler i:fi this<br>
order and then to be discharged through said discharge h<br>

compartment 21 through the upper open hole 5b of the front frpie<br>
member 5. refueling mouth 55b of the fuel tank projected upward through the circular hole lid of the cei cover 11 and a fuel cap 58 is screwed on an upper end of refueling mouth 55b.<br>
The fuel tank 55 is disposed in a space outside of fan cover 16 and the duct 7 within the center compartn together with suction system instruments such as the carburi 52 and the air-cleaner 53, and fuel system parts of the en 30 are concentrated in the lump. Thus, the space is util' efficiently and the apparatus is made compact.<br>
In the flat rectangular space of the front compartn<br>
21	covered by the front cover 13 in front of the front fr<br>
member 5, an inverter device 60 and a battery 61 is dispc<br>
right and left on the under frame member 3 and above then<br>
provided a control panel 62 facing the front rectangular oper<br>
13a of the front cover 13.  Namely, electric instruments<br>
concentrated in the front compartment 21.<br>
The inverter device 60 converts output of the multipc generator 35 into alternating current of a predetermi frequency.  The inverter device 60 is disposed on the ri side of the front compartment 21 near the suction holes 4b to be cooled by sucked outer air at the outset.<br>
As described above, the engine-operated generate having the soundproof case 2 is constructed in such a man that the generator 35, the engine 30 and the muffler 32 arranged in this order and accommodated in the ducts 7, 8 the fan cover 16.<br>
The suction opening 16a of the fan cover 16 opens i the center compartment 22 and the centrifugal fan 40 is provi inside of the suction opening 16a, so that by rotation of centrifugal fan 40, air is introduced into the center <br>
of dotted  line  in Figs.   4 and 7).<br>
the<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, air inhaled in the fan covef) 16 through the suction opening 16a by the fan blade 41 on the f ont face of the centrifugal fan 40 flows along the inner periph ral surface of the fan cover 16 and the outside of the outer-njtor 36 of the generator 35 toward the engine 30 to cool the eng jne. However, a part of the air flowing toward the engine 3C is directed to the inside of the outer-rotor 36 through a sfjace between the generator 35 and the engine 30 by action of fan blade 42 on the rear face of the centrifugal fan 40 to  ool the generating coil and returns to the centrifugal fan 42 thr ugh the ventilating holes 36b in the bottom wall of the outer-r|tor 36 for recirculation.<br>
The air   introduced  in  the  engine 30  including  the  abjfve-mentioned  recirculated  air  cools  the engine  and  then flows  up\ ard<br><br>
ter<br>
guided  by the ducts  7,   8  to cool   the muffler  32   (Fig.   4).     A<br>
cooling the muffler 32,   the air  is discharged to the exterfior through   the   discharge   opening   8a   of   the   soundproof   cas positioned above the muffler facing the exterior.<br>
or<br>
the ng<br>
exterior air which restrains leakage of suction noise occurring in the center compartment 22. The inverter device 60! is positioned in the course of the suction air stream from he suction holes 4a, 4b to be cooled effectively.<br>
The generator 35, the engine 30 and the muffler 32 wtiich<br>
ts ed<br>
Since the center compartment  22 communicates with it he front  compartment  21   through  the communication  open  hole  5c of the front frame member 5,  air  introduced from the exter through  the  suction holes 4a,   4b  into  the  front  compartm 21   is  inhaled  in the center compartment  22.     At  that  time, front compartment  21   acts as a  labyrinth duct  for  introduc<br>
are heat sources are covered by the fan cover 16 and the di 7, 8 to be isolated from other instruments, and the air inh;<br>
in the fan cover 16 by the centrifugal fan 40 through the sue![ion opening 16a opening into the center compartment 22 cools firstly the generator 35 of relatively low temperature and then the engine 30 and the muffler 32 of higher temperature and discharged<br>
to the exterior through the discharge opening 8a. Theref
Since the centrifugal fan 40 is attached to the ou rotor 36 of the generator 30, the cooling fan 40 of lc capacity can be furnished and a high fan supporting strer can be obtained.<br>
Since the muffler 32 is disposed above the engine in such a manner that the hotter instrument is positionec the higher position and the discharge opening 8a is prov above the muffler 32, a reasonable cooling air stream car generated for efficient cooling.<br>
The above-mentioned ventilating construction hav the generator 35, the engine 30 and the muffler 32 arrar in this order and covered by the fan cover 16 and the di 7, 8 is very simple. Since the engine 30 is disposed in r of the generator 35, the muffler 32 is disposed above the en
Further, since the generator 35 is an outer-rotor t generator and the outer-rotor 35 serves as a flywheel of engine 30, there is no need to provide a flywheel otherw and size of the engine-operated generator in the axial direct (front-rear direction) can be made small.  Since output of multipolar generator 35 is converted into alternating curr of a predetermined frequency by the inverter 60, size of generator itself in the axial direction can be made smal<br>
In addition, since the cylinder 30b of the engine is inclined sideways and the muffler 32 is disposed abo vertical size of the engine-operated generator can be restrai small while disposing the muffler 32 of a large capacity<br>
The engine 30 as a noise source is doubly covered a duct composed of the duct 7 and the glass wool duct 8<br><br><br>
high soundproof effect can be obtained.<br><br>
Since the output of the multipolar generator 3! converted into an alternating current of a predeterrrr frequency, there is no need to maintain the rotational sf constant regardless of the load in order to maintain the ou frequency constant as in case of a synchronous generator wf has been used in this kind of engine-operated general therefore the rotational speed can be reduced when the 1 is not large to reduce operation noise greatly.<br><br><br><br><br>
