				<td>A METHOD OF ASSISTING IGNITION OF FUEL WITHIN A COMBUSTION CHAMBER<br>
OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a method and an apparatus for assisting ignition of<br>
fuel within a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Fuel alternatives to diesel, including gaseous fuel such as natural gas, hydrogen,<br>
ethane, and blends of such gaseous fuels, when used to power internal combustion engines, can<br>
significantly reduce emissions of pollutants when compared to the same engines fuelled by diesel.<br>
Emissions of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOk), particulate matter (PM) and carbon dioxide<br>
(CO:) can be reduced when gaseous fuels are used to fuel diesel engines. The amount of such<br>
reductions depends on the fuel chosen amongst other variables. Further, diesel engines can be fuelled<br>
by gaseous fuel and still maintain the performance found when diesel fuel is used. For example,<br>
gaseous fuel directly injected under high pressure into the combustion chamber of a diesel engine can<br>
deliver performance that matches its diesel-fuelled counterpart.<br>
[0003] Many gaseous fuels and some non-diesel liquid fuels are less auto-ignitable than diesel<br>
fuel. As such, conditions within the cylinder may not provide the necessary environment for auto-<br>
ignition<br>
when the same environment can auto-ignite diesel. Therefore, a method<br>
of assisting ignition is needed to ensure the gaseous fuel is ignited.<br>
[0004] Injecting a pilot fuel is one method of initiating ignition of a<br>
directly injected quantity of gaseous fuel such as natural gas. Typically,<br>
a small amount of diesel fuel is added to a compressed intake charge<br>
within the combustion chamber when the piston is near top dead center.<br>
The diesel fuel auto-ignites. A main quantity of gaseous fuel is then<br>
injected. This quantity is ignited by the burning quantity of pilot fuel.<br>
[0005] This method requires a source of a second, more auto-<br>
ignitable fuel. Therefore, such a system requires separate pilot fuel<br>
storage, and specialized fuel injection valve design and piping to manage<br>
pilot diesel fuel flow in addition to main fuel flow. Burning diesel fuel<br>
in the combustion chamber generates diesel emissions resulting in higher<br>
NOx, CO2 and PM levels than would otherwise be present if no pilot<br>
diesel fuel is employed.<br>
[0006] Alternatively, hot surface or glow plug ignition can be<br>
employed to initiate ignition of a gaseous fuel that is directly injected<br>
into a compressed intake charge. Here, in general, a glow plug protrudes<br>
from the fire deck, a small distance into the combustion chamber. One of<br>
several fuel jets injected into the combustion chamber can be directed at<br>
the glow plug to initiate combustion of this fuel jet. In turn, this fuel jet,<br>
once ignited, will propagate a flame through the combustion chamber in<br>
an effort to ignite the other fuel jets.<br>
[0007] One of the problems with this method is that the glow plug<br>
is a point source of heat within the combustion chamber. Therefore, it<br>
takes time for a first ignited fuel jet to propagate a flame throughout the<br>
combustion chamber. Additional turbulence may help but can be imperfect. Gas furthest removed<br>
from the glow plug may not ignite or may not burn incompletely. As such, the engine may run less<br>
efficiently, delivering less power because of incomplete combustion. Also, a higher percentage of<br>
unburned fuel can result in increased hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, see : Mueller, C. J. and Musculus,<br>
M. P., "Glow Plug Assisted Ignition and Combustion of methanol in an Optical DI Diesel Engine",<br>
SAE paper 2001-01-2004.<br>
Spark ignition can also be used, however, like glow plugs, spark ignition ignites a flame at<br>
one point within the combustion chamber that propogates throughout the chamber. Therefore,<br>
combustion can be incomplete with this method too.<br>
There is a need to address the problems noted above to improve engine efficiency and to<br>
reduce engine emissions.<br>
Summary<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of assisting ignition of a fuel within a<br>
combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine, said method comprising :<br>
a. introducing an intake charge into said combustion chamber during an intake stroke of<br>
a piston, said piston partially defining said combustion chamber,<br>
b. compressing said intake charge during a compression stroke of said piston,<br>
c. injecting a plurality of spatially distinct fuel jets of said fuel directly into said<br>
combustion chamber,<br>
d. directing at least two of said plurality of spatially distinct fuel jets proximate to a<br>
glow member, said glow member igniting said fuel at at least two locations within said<br>
combustion chamber, each of said at least two locations corresponding to each of said<br>
at least two of said plurality of spatially distinct fuel jets,<br>
e. igniting and burning said fuel within said combustion chamber.<br>
The invention further provides an apparatus for assisting combustion of a fuel within a<br>
combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine, said apparatus comprising a glow member,<br>
which has a heatable surface that is positionable within said combustion chamber where a plurality of<br>
spatially distinct fuel jets are directly injected, to ignite at least two of said plurality of spatially<br>
distinct fuel jets at at least two locations within said combustion chamber, each of said at least two<br>
locations corresponding to each of said at least two of said plurality of spatially distinct fuel jets.<br>
The invention further provides an internal combustion engine comprising :<br>
a. a combustion chamber defined by :<br>
a cylinder;<br>
a piston disposed in said cylinder, said piston oscillating between top dead<br>
center and bottom dead center within said cylinder during operation of said engine;<br>
a fire deck covering one end of said cylinder opposite to said piston,<br>
b. a fuel injection valve, said fuel injection valve capable of injecting a plurality of<br>
spatially distinct fuel jets of a fuel directly into said combustion chamber,<br>
c. a glow member comprising a hot surface positioned relative to said fuel injection<br>
valve such that said fuel from at least two of said plurality of fuel jets is heatable by said glow<br>
member at at least two locations within said combustion chamber, each of said at least two locations<br>
corresponding to each of said at least two of said plurality of spatially distinct fuel jets.<br>
The present disclosure introduces a glow member within the combustion chamber that assists<br>
in ignition of gaseous fuel and other fuels with a relatively high auto-ignition temperature, compared<br>
to diesel fuel. The glow member either initiates combustion or assists in initiating combustion by<br>
providing an ignition assist for each of the fuel jets rather than one fuel jet or one region of the<br>
chamber. This helps to achieve complete combustion throughout the combustion chamber.<br>
A method is provided for assisting ignition of a fuel within a combustion chamber of an<br>
internal combustion engine. The method comprises introducing an intake charge into the combustion<br>
chamber<br>
during an intake stroke of a piston and compressing the intake charge<br>
during a compression stroke of the piston. A plurality of spatially<br>
distinct fuel jets is introduced directly into the combustion chamber. At<br>
least two distinct fuel jets are directed near or onto a glow member with a<br>
surface that is heatable to assist with ignition of the fuel. That is, the at<br>
least a portion of the fuel introduced by each one of the fuel jets is<br>
directed to respective location within the combustion chamber that is<br>
proximate to the heated surface of the glow member so that the heat<br>
provided by the glow member assists with the ignition of the fuel, which<br>
is burned within the combustion chamber. In a preferred method, the<br>
glow member with the hot surface can be in the shape of a ring.<br>
[0012] The glow member can be heated by the heat of combustion<br>
alone or with additional heat provided by a heating element, powered, for<br>
example, by an electric current. A preferred method comprises heating<br>
the glow member to a temperature of at least 1200°C.<br>
[0013] The method may further comprise stepping down the<br>
voltage of said engine's electrical system so that a lower voltage is<br>
applied to the heating circuit for the glow member. For example, and<br>
engine's electrical system typically operates with a voltage of at least 12<br>
volts, but in a preferred method the voltage applied to the circuit for the<br>
heating element of the glow member can be stepped down to less than or<br>
equal to 2 volts. An advantage of using a lower voltage is that it allows a<br>
material with a lower electrical resistivity to be employed, which can<br>
provide more flexibility in selecting heating element materials or to have<br>
higher thermal mass, which can result in reduced temperature<br>
fluctuations during the course of an engine's operation. A heating<br>
element with a larger mass can also be more robust in the severe<br>
operating conditions that are normally present within an engine's<br>
combustion chamber. In a preferred arrangement, for an engine with a<br>
plurality of combustion chambers and a glow member in each<br>
combustion chamber, a step down transformer is provided for each glow<br>
member and the heating element forms the secondary circuit of the<br>
respective step down transformer.<br>
[0014] A catalytic coating can be put on the glow member to create<br>
conditions where the fuel is ignitable at a lower temperature, compared to<br>
the conditions where there is no catalyst present. An advantage of this<br>
approach is that heating the glow member, which may comprise a ring, to<br>
a lower temperature can improve the durability of the glow member.<br>
[0015] A preferred apparatus comprises a glow member disposed<br>
within a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine for<br>
assisting combustion of a fuel therein. The glow member provides a<br>
beatable surface positioned to assist with the ignition of a plurality of<br>
spatially distinct fuel jets injected directly into the combustion chamber.<br>
A preferred shape for the glow member is a circular ring.<br>
[0016] The glow member can have a surface comprising a catalytic<br>
material. The catalytic material can comprise a precious metal. By way of<br>
preferred example, the precious metal can be platinum.<br>
[0017] The glow member can be connected to a current source for<br>
directing an electric current through the glow member. The electric<br>
current is capable of heating the glow member. The apparatus can<br>
further comprise a transformer for reducing the voltage that is applied to<br>
the heating circuit. Vehicles typically use electrical systems based upon<br>
a voltage of at least 12 volts. The voltage applied to the glow member<br>
heating circuit, could be reduced, for example to less than or equal to 2<br>
volts. By reducing the voltage, the electrical resistance can also be<br>
reduced, allowing thicker, more robust heating elements that have a<br>
larger thermal mass or the selection of a material with a lower resistivity.<br>
The glow member can be subjected to cooling during the engine cycle,<br>
for example, when the relatively cool intake charge is introduced into the<br>
combustion chamber. A larger thermal mass allows the glow member to<br>
retain more heat so there is less variation in the surface temperature of<br>
the glow member. In a preferred arrangement of this embodiment, for<br>
engines with a plurality of combustion chambers with a glow member in<br>
each combustitin chamber, a step down transformer is provided for each<br>
glow member and the heating element for each glow member is the<br>
secondary circuit for the step down transformer.<br>
[0018] In some embodiments, the glow member can be capable of<br>
being heated to a temperature of at least 1200°C.<br>
[0019] A further aspect of the invention provides an internal<br>
combustion engine comprising a combustion chamber defined by a<br>
cylinder, a piston disposed in the cylinder, the piston oscillating between<br>
top dead center and bottom dead center within the cylinder during<br>
operation of the engine and a fire deck covering one end of the cylinder<br>
opposite to the piston. The engine further includes a fuel injection valve,<br>
which is capable of injecting a plurality of spatially distinct fuel jets<br>
directly into the combustion chamber. Also, a glow member provides a<br>
hot surface that is positioned relative to the fuel injection valve such that a<br>
quantity of the fuel from each one of the plurality of fuel jets is heatable by<br>
the glow member.<br>
[0020] The glow member hot surface can be provided in the shape<br>
of a ring.<br>
[0021] The engine can be configured so that each one of the<br>
plurality of fuel jets impact directly on the glow member.<br>
[0022] The glow member can comprise a catalytic material. The<br>
catalytic material can comprise a precious metal and in a preferred<br>
embodiment, that precious metal can be platinum.<br>
[0023] The glow member can comprise an anode and a cathode<br>
capable of providing an electric current for heating the glow member.<br>
The engine can further comprise a transformer for stepping down the<br>
voltage of the electric current from the voltage provided by the engine's<br>
electrical system to a lower voltage that can be applied to the glow<br>
member. As in previously described embodiments, the voltage applied to<br>
the glow member may be less than or equal to 2 volts.<br>
[0024] The glow member can further define an orifice and a<br>
reservoir. The orifice allows a quantity of the intake charge to flow into<br>
and out of the reservoir. When the engine is running, a portion of the<br>
intake charge can flow into the reservoir and accumulating therein during<br>
a compression stroke. The glow member heats the portion of the intake<br>
charge that is held within the reservoir, and during the power stroke the<br>
heated portion of the intake charge can flow from the reservoir through<br>
the orifices and back into the combustion chamber as a heated "charge<br>
jet".<br><br>
[0025] In some embodiments the engine further comprises a barrier<br>
disposed within the combustion chamber between the fuel injection valve<br>
and the glow member. In this embodiment at least a portion of the fuel<br>
that is introduced into the combustion chamber by the plurality of fuel<br>
jets impacts on the barrier to generate fuel eddies and the glow member is<br>
positioned in a space where the fuel eddies are generated when the<br>
engine is operating. The velocity of the fuel in the fuel jets is greater<br>
closer to the fuel injection valve, and if the glow member is positioned<br>
closer to the fuel injection valve it can be desirable to slow down the fuel<br>
that is directed to the glow member so that it has a greater opportunity to<br>
ignite. An advantage of this arrangement is that the barrier acts to slow<br>
down the fuel and the fuel in the eddies can remain proximate to the glow<br>
member for a longer period of time. The barrier is attached to the fire<br>
deck. In one embodiment, the barrier can be a spring clip. The glow<br>
member can be attached to the barrier for structural support.<br>
[0026] The engine can comprise an injection valve sleeve defining<br>
an opening for receiving and supporting the fuel injection valve, which is<br>
mountable therein. The barrier can be a portion of the sleeve that<br>
extends beyond the fire deck so that it protrudes into the combustion<br>
chamber. In another embodiment, the barrier can be attached to the<br>
injection valve sleeve.<br>
[0027] The barrier can comprise a catalytic material that helps to<br>
ignite the fuel at a lower temperature, compared to the temperature that<br>
would be necessary to ignite the fuel without the presence of the catalytic<br>
material. The catalytic material can comprise a precious metal and in a<br>
preferred embodiment, the precious metal is platinum.<br>
[0028] A further aspect of the invention provides an internal<br>
combustion engine comprising a cylinder, a piston disposed within the<br>
cylinder where the piston oscillates between top dead center and bottom<br>
dead center within the cylinder during operation of the engine. A fire<br>
deck covers one end of the cylinder opposite to the piston. The cylinder,<br>
the piston and the fire deck substantially define a combustion chamber.<br>
The engine includes a fuel injection valve and the fuel injection valve<br>
comprises a plurality of orifices, which are provided through a nozzle of<br>
the fuel injection valve. The nozzle projects from the fire deck to allow<br>
each one of the orifices to direct a fuel into the combustion chamber in a<br>
spatially distinct fuel jet. A glow member is positioned suspended from<br>
the fire deck and positioned relative to fuel injection valve such that each<br>
one of the plurality of fuel jets will impact on the glow member when it is<br>
directed into the combustion chamber.<br>
[0029] Yet another embodiment of the invention provides an engine<br>
comprising a cylinder, a piston disposed in the cylinder where the piston<br>
oscillates between top dead center and bottom dead center within the<br>
cylinder during operation of the engine. Also, a fire deck is included.<br>
The cylinder, the piston and the fire deck substantially define a<br>
combustion chamber. Also a fuel injection valve is included where the<br>
fuel injection valve comprises at least two orifices. A valve sleeve is<br>
included defining a support space and a first end, the first end projected<br>
from the fire deck into the combustion chamber. The injection valve is<br>
disposed in the support space wherein each of the orifices is capable of<br>
directing a fuel jet past the sleeve into the combustion chamber. A glow<br>
 member is fixed around a clip. The clip is fixed to the first end and<br>
positioned on the first end such that a portion of the fuel jets will impact<br>
on the clip when injected into the combustion chamber resulting in fuel<br>
eddies. The glow member is positioned on the clip such that the eddies<br>
impact the glow member.<br>
[0030] In preferred embodiments, the fuel that is introduced into<br>
the combustion chamber is a gaseous fuel.<br>
[0031] Further aspects of the invention and features of specific<br>
embodiments of the invention are discussed below.<br><br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0036] A glow member is provided that assists in ignition and<br>
combustion of fuels that are difficult to auto-ignite under the conditions<br>
typically found within a compression ignition diesel-fuelled engine. The<br>
disclosed method and apparatus help to burn more of the fuel within the<br>
combustion chamber.<br>
[0037] In the embodiments discussed herein, the combustion<br>
chamber has accumulated an intake charge through the piston's intake<br>
stroke and has compressed that charge through the piston's compression<br>
stroke. The embodiments are demonstrated when the piston is at or near<br>
top dead center at the commencement of a power stroke. By way of<br>
example, a gaseous fuel is injected into the compressed intake charge<br>
within the combustion chamber at about this point in the cycle of the<br>
engine. Amongst a number of considerations, the injection should be<br>
timed to allow the fuel to ignite and burn to drive the power stroke.<br>
[0038] Referring to FIGS, la and lb, ring-shaped glow member 54<br>
is shown attached to fire deck 63.<br>
[0039] The first embodiment of the subject disclosure is shown<br>
with intake valves 50 and exhaust valves 52 outlined in the top view.<br>
Glow member 54, and the nozzle of fuel injection valve 56 are disposed<br>
within combustion chamber 60. Dashed lines outline the general shape<br>
of fuel jets 58. In FIG. lb, piston 62 is at or near top dead center within<br>
combustion chamber 60. The side view of FIG. lb also shows fire deck<br>
63 along with posts 65, from which glow member 54 is supported.<br>
[0040] Note that fuel jets 58 are shown demonstrating a typical<br>
spray pattern within the combustion chamber. FIGs. la and lb show<br>
how fuel jets 58 can be directed to the proximity of glow member 54 so<br>
that at least a portion of the fuel in fuel jets 58 is heatable by the glow<br>
member to assist with igniting the fuel.<br>
[0041] Referring to FIG. lb, glow member 54 is shown affixed to<br>
fire deck 63. Glow member 54 is provided in this first embodiment at a<br>
distance from fire deck 63 and with a circumference that provides a hot<br>
surface area, which assists with ignition and combustion of each fuel jet<br>
58. That is, preferably each fuel jet 58, shortly after being injected into<br>
the combustion chamber from fuel injection valve 56, will impact on the<br>
upper surface of glow member 54. In turn, glow member 54 imparts heat<br>
to at least some of the fuel provided by fuel jets 58 helping to initiate<br>
ignition of these fuel jets. That is, as glow member 54 is preferably<br>
approximately centered on the fuel injection valve, each fuel jet interacts,<br>
and preferably impacts, glow member 54 allowing it to ignite more<br>
easily. Combustion is less reliant on flame propagation to ignite and burn<br>
all fuel. Therefore, more complete combustion can be achieved.<br>
[0042] The disclosure contemplates a fuel injection valve that<br>
directs at least two spatially distinct fuel jets into a combustion chamber.<br>
That is, the fuel injection valve has a plurality of nozzle orifices, with<br>
each orifice providing a point of origin for a fuel jet to direct fuel into the<br>
combustion chamber. Each nozzle orifice can direct a fuel jet that is<br>
spatially distinct from the fuel jets originating from other respective<br>
nozzle orifices. Typically, fuel jets are dispersed from the injection valve<br>
tip to various different parts of the combustion chamber to provide fuel<br>
to all parts of combustion chamber to help use as much of the intake<br>
charge as possible.<br>
[0043] The preferred glow member arrangement in the shape of a<br>
ring centered on the injection valve allows each fuel jet to impact on the<br>
glow member at approximately the same time assuming the injection<br>
pressure and injection valve nozzle orifice sizes are the same and<br>
symmetry of the fuel jet pattern around the injection valve tip is<br>
approximately equal. However, the dimension of the ring can be varied to<br>
deal with asymmetric jet patterns. That is, it is preferred, more generally,<br>
that the ring be positioned, shaped and dimension such that it would be in<br>
the path of each fuel jet directed from the injection valve.<br>
[0044] By way of example, the range of dimensioning for the<br>
geometry of glow member 54 can be provided by:<br>
D = (0.2-0.35)*B<br>
d = (0.1-0.25)*B<br>
h = (0.01-0.1)*B<br>
where D is the outer diameter of the ring and d the inner diameter of the<br>
ring, h is height of the supporting posts, and B is the diameter of the<br>
cylinder.<br>
[0045] In preferred embodiments, the diameter of the ring and<br>
distance of the ring from the fire deck are selected to help ensure that the<br>
glow member is exposed to the combustion environment to help the glow<br>
member to accumulate heat during combustion events within the<br>
chamber. At the same time, glow member 54 is positioned close enough<br>
to the fuel jet that ignition can be assisted.<br>
[0046] As would be understood by a person skilled in the art, care<br>
should taken to ensure that a glow member with a larger diameter be<br>
clear of intake valves 50 and exhaust valves 52, allowing these valves to<br>
open as required during operation of the engine.<br>
[0047] This first embodiment of the glow member can be<br>
"passively" or "actively" heated. As defined herein, a passively heated<br>
glow member is made of materials that retain heat between engine cycles.<br>
The temperature within the combustion chamber fluctuates during<br>
engine operation. For example the temperature drops when the relatively<br>
cool intake charge is introduced during the intake stroke, and the<br>
temperature increases during the compression stroke and the temperature<br>
rises even more during the power stroke when the fuel is burned. A<br>
passively heated glow member is made from a material that acts as a<br>
"thermal absorber". After being warmed during the first few cycles after<br>
start-up, a passively heated glow member can maintain a temperature<br>
within a desired range between subsequent combustion events as<br>
determined by, amongst other things, the thermal retention and<br>
absorption properties of the material and the combustion environment.<br>
That is, the combustion environment of a particular fuel will warm the<br>
combustion chamber and the passively heated glow member. The heat<br>
retained by the glow member allows it to maintain a surface temperature<br>
that is hot enough to assist with the ignition of at least a portion of fuel<br>
jets 58, which impacts on glow member 54. In this arrangement, the fuel<br>
will either ignite and burn as a result of impacting the glow member or<br>
ignite and burn more easily than would be the case otherwise. In the later<br>
case, another ignition assist strategy can be used in addition to the<br>
disclosed glow member, but with less energy being required to ignite the<br>
fuel.<br>
[0048] A glow member that is only passively heated will be cold if<br>
the engine has been shut down for an extended period of time.<br>
Therefore, a passively heated glow member requires additional ignition<br>
assistance at times when the glow member cannot provide heat to assist<br>
with ignition. Therefore, by way of example, a start-up ignition assist<br>
such as a glow plug, spark plug or pilot fuel can be used to help initiate<br>
ignition of the gaseous fuel until the combustion chamber, and the glow<br>
member, is warmed. However, once the engine is "warm", the glow<br>
member will impart some heat to the fuel jets. Depending upon the<br>
temperature within the combustion chamber and the type of fuel being<br>
burned, the amount of assistance from other ignition assistance devices<br>
can be reduced or eliminated.<br>
[0049] An engine controller may monitor such things as the<br>
hydrocarbon emissions, cycle-to-cycle combustion variability and load to<br>
help ensure ignition of the fuel, complete combustion of the fuel and a<br>
reduction or elimination of a start-up ignition assist such as pilot fuel or a<br>
conventional glow plug.<br>
[0050] The preferred materials to make glow member 54 are<br>
generally high temperature materials of suitable durability to withstand<br>
the environment within the combustion chamber. Glow member 54 is<br>
 made from a material that can withstand the thermal conditions and<br>
tresses within the combustion chamber. By way of example, some<br>
mitable materials include those considered for glow plugs and glow plug<br>
shields. These materials can be coated with catalytic materials such as<br>
platinum or other precious metals. U.S. Patent 6,076,493 teaches use and<br>
preparation of such materials for a glow plug shield for use in a<br>
combustion chamber.<br>
[0051] In the disclosed embodiments, ignition assistance is<br>
preferably provided by a glow member that can, between cycles, retain a<br>
temperature above that found within a given charge at that point near the<br>
completion of the compression stroke or the commencement of the power<br>
stroke at which time fuel is injected into the combustion chamber.<br>
[0052] Note that the shape of the illustrated piston bowl is<br>
demonstrative of typical piston bowl designs. Such a design, developed<br>
for diesel-fueled engines, is directed at promoting turbulence within the<br>
combustion chamber. In the case of glow plug ignition assisted engines,<br>
turbulence helps promote the propagation of combustion throughout the<br>
combustion chamber. As there is less need for flame propagation within<br>
the combustion chamber where the subject teaching is used, such<br>
turbulence enhancement geometry within the combustion chamber may<br>
be less important than would otherwise be the case.<br>
[0053] As already noted, the glow member shown in FIGs. la and<br>
lb can also be actively heated. An actively heated glow member is<br>
defined as a glow member that does not rely entirely on the absorption of<br>
heat from within the combustion chamber for storing heat energy. By<br>
way of example, the glow member can be heated by running an electric<br><br>
current through the glow member itself or through an electric heating<br>
circuit provided within the glow member.<br>
[00541 As an additional feature, any one of the embodiments of the<br>
glow member described herein can further comprise one or a plurality of<br>
reservoirs provided within the body of a passively or actively heated<br>
glow member. Orifices can provide communication between the glow<br>
member reservoir(s) and the combustion chamber. A portion of the<br>
intake charge that is introduced into the combustion chamber during an<br>
intake stroke can accumulate within such, reservoir(s) during the intake<br>
stroke and the subsequent compression stroke. The intake charge that<br>
flows into such reservoir(s) is surrounded by the warmed glow member.<br>
Upon commencement of the power stroke, the warmed charge would be<br>
expelled into the combustion chamber by the expansion of the<br>
combustion chamber, with the warmed charge and the turbulence caused<br>
by its re-introduction into the combustion chamber providing further<br>
ignition assistance to the fuel.<br>
[0055] Known methods can be employed for mounting the glow<br>
member within the combustion chamber. For example, in each<br>
embodiment it would be appropriate to attach the glow member using<br>
appropriate screws, bolts, welding or other known methods, as would be<br>
understood by a person skilled in the art.<br>
[0056] Referring to FIGS. 2a and 2b, a second embodiment is<br>
provided. In this embodiment, passive glow member 92 is affixed to<br>
piston 90 by posts 93. Again fuel jet 94 is outlined being injected into<br>
combustion chamber 96, which is partially defined by piston 90. FIG. 2a<br>
shows the location of intake valves 98 and exhaust valves 100. While<br>
the illustrated embodiment employs a four-valve arrangement (two intake<br>
valves and two exhaust valves), glow member 92 can be employed with a<br>
different number of intake or exhaust valves. Also shown by the<br>
illustrated embodiment is a combustion chamber with centrally<br>
positioned fuel injection valve 102 from which fuel jets 94 originate.<br>
[0057] The second embodiment works in generally the same way as<br>
the first embodiment. However, as this second embodiment shows the<br>
glow member attached to piston 90 instead of fire deck 105, glow<br>
member 92 will only come into direct contact with fuel jets 58 when the<br>
piston is at or near top dead center. Therefore, it is preferred, for this<br>
embodiment, that the fuel be injected near top dead center.<br>
[0058] Further, this embodiment has less flexibility adapting an<br>
actively heated system to the glow member. It is more difficult to provide<br>
the power necessary to an active system because the glow member is<br>
attached to the piston.<br>
[0059] Referring to FIG. 3, a third embodiment is provided wherein<br>
an active glow member is shown. Glow member 200 is attached to<br>
support member 202, which is, in turn, attached to injection valve sleeve<br>
204. Fuel injection valve 206 is shown mounted inside injection valve<br>
sleeve 204. Injection valve nozzle orifices 208 are shown with fuel jets<br>
210. Fuel eddies 212 are shown generated near and beyond support<br>
member 202 which acts as a barrier in the path of at least a portion of the<br>
fuel jet. Positive and negative power leads 214 and 216 are shown as<br>
well. Fire deck 218 defines one boundary of the combustion chamber<br>
from which protrudes injection valve 206.<br>
[0060] In this preferred embodiment of actively heated glow<br>
member 200, support member 202 is attached to an end of injection valve<br>
sleeve 204 that extends below fire deck 218 and that projects into the<br>
combustion chamber. Glow member 200 is attached to support member<br>
202 as shown, and support member 202 also projects into the combustion<br>
chamber. When a controller commands fuel injection valve 206 to open,<br>
a quantity of fuel is injected into the combustion chamber, and at least a<br>
portion of fuel jets 210 impact on support member 202 to generate fuel<br>
eddies 212, which recirculate around support member 202 in the vicinity<br>
of glow member 200. Actively heated glow member 200 is heated by an<br>
electric current through leads 214 and 216. Therefore, shortly after the<br>
fuel eddies are heated by being in the proximity of glow member 200,<br>
ignition results. Due to the ring shape of glow member 200 and support<br>
member 202, each one of jets 210 from each one of nozzle orifices 208<br>
will generate fuel eddies 212 which can bring fuel close to glow member<br>
200 resulting in ignition of each fuel jet from each eddy. Combustion<br>
from the fuel contained in each fuel jet is, likewise, assisted. Further,<br>
glow member 200 is relatively small which results in reduced power<br>
requirements to heat glow member 200 compared to a larger active glow<br>
member.<br>
[0061] While it is possible to remove support member 202 and<br>
position glow member 200 in the path of fuel jets 210, positioning the<br>
glow member directly in the path of fuel jets 210 can inhibit combustion.<br>
As fuel jets 210 are driven from fuel injection valve 206 at very high<br>
velocity, the fuel can be driven past glow member 200 without igniting.<br>
Therefore, support member 202, allows an eddy of fuel to form. It is<br>
directed at a relatively low velocity towards the glow member and is<br>
allowed to ignite and propagate a flame through to each fuel jet 210.<br>
[0062] For this embodiment, the ring should be made of a material<br>
capable of being electrically heated to temperatures within the range of<br>
900°C to 1700°C, with the preferred temperature range between 900°C<br>
and 1200°C. Materials that are able to withstand the conditions found<br>
within the combustion chamber are known. For example, suitable<br>
materials include Si3N4 composites. Likewise, support member 202 can<br>
be used as a thermal catalyst to promote ignition. It could be made of a<br>
thermally absorbing material, such as those discussed above in regards to<br>
the passive glow members of the first and second embodiments. When<br>
support member 202 is employed as a passive glow member, once<br>
heated, it can help reduce the load on active glow member 200.<br>
[0063] The disclosed passively and actively heated glow member<br>
embodiments can be employed with four-stroke and two-stroke engines.<br>
[0064] Conventional glow plugs use a hot surface at a point within<br>
the combustion chamber to assist with ignition of a fuel. The present<br>
apparatus and method employs a glow member that provides a hot<br>
surface that provides ignition and combustion assistance to more than<br>
one area of the combustion chamber in cooperation with the fuel<br>
injection pattern dictated by fuel injection valve design. Therefore, hot<br>
surface geometry that provides ignition and combustion assistance to a<br>
plurality of spatially distinct fuel jets also falls within the disclosure. A<br>
ring-shaped glow member is a convenient embodiment as many fuel<br>
injection valves provide a relatively uniform spray pattern to many<br>
regions of a generally cylindrical combustion chamber. However, where<br>
the fuel injection valve provides a variation on this spray pattern, the hot<br>
surface or "glow element" shape and positioning can be adapted.<br>
Therefore, as would be understood by a person skilled in the art, the glow<br>
member may be "C"-shaped, oval shaped, or may have other shapes to<br>
match the fuel injection valve design.<br>
[0065] For the purposes of this disclosure, gaseous fuels are<br>
contemplated as the fuel used to drive the engine. However, as suggested<br>
above, many fuels that are more difficult to auto-ignite than diesel can, in<br>
general, be adapted and are contemplated within the subject disclosure,<br>
as would be understood by a person skilled in the art. Therefore, where<br>
gaseous fuels are referenced, the disclosure contemplates such fuels as<br>
natural gas, methane, ethane, butane, propane and other gaseous<br>
hydrocarbon fuels as well as hydrogen and other fuels that contain one or<br>
more of these gaseous fuels. Also, some liquid fuels, such as methanol,<br>
that can require ignition assistance, depending on engine design, can also<br>
benefit. Most such fuels will benefit to some extent from the presence of<br>
the disclosed glow member or, more generally, hot surface geometry<br>
found in the combustion chamber.<br>
[0066] Rate shaping can also be used in the context of this<br>
disclosure to help ignite fuel. Greater exposure of a fuel to the glow<br>
member, in essence priming the fuel prior to ignition, can help ignition<br>
when required during or at the commencement of the power stroke.<br>
[0067] While particular elements, embodiments and applications of<br>
the present disclosure have been shown and described, it will be<br>
understood, of course, that the disclosure is not limited thereto since<br>
modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing<br>
from the scope of the present disclosure, particularly in light of the<br>
foregoing teachings.<br>
