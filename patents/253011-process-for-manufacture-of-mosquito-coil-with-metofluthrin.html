COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10: rule 13)<br>
Title:	PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OF<br>
METOFLUTHRIN COIL 0.005%<br><br><br>
APPLICANT: M/S SHOGUN ORGANICS LIMITED 502B, KOTIA NIRMAN, LINK ROAD ANDHERI (WEST) MUMBAI 400 053. MAHARASHATRA, INDIA, AN INDIAN COMPANY<br><br>
The following Specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed .<br><br><br>
Shogun Organics Ltd Manufacture Process of Metofluthrin 0.005% Mosquito Coil<br>
Description<br>
Mosquito coils (Spirals ) have been in use for many years in the filed of mosquito control . The coils are a popular form , because it burns the ingredients , along with the Active Ingredient , and enables delivery through evaporation. No external electricity or power sources are required , thereby enabling uses in many areas indoor and outdoor.<br>
Various forms and types of coils have been produced using different ingredients and different combination and composition of ingredients . Each composition gives a specific result in strength of the coil and burning time of the coil . Additionally many other factors like availability of materials in specific areas and the temperature conditions in place of use of coil , influence the factors of coil composition.<br>
Specific range of Active Ingredient , with good repellent or kill effect have been tried in mosquito coils . Mostly Synthetic Pyrethroids have been found to be most effective for this application. Metofluthrin Technical is a new Pyrethroid for use in mosquito coils. Metofluthrin Technical grade material can be directly used in 0.005% weight of the batch . Alternatively , a 5% emulsified concentrate form Metofluthrin 5% EC can be used in weight 0.1% to give the same 0.005% dosage in the batch .<br>
The two important factors to be considered in coils , is its strength in during transit, storage and use . And the burning time of the coil. Each coil comes in a DC ( Double Coil) punch . Two coils are joined together.<br>
.2<br><br>
s~i<br><br>
...2...<br>
 They have to be separated for use individually . Drop tests , for checking strength and breakage have to be conducted on each batch of coil. Stronger stable coils are better as they can sustain the transit from the place of production to the consumer.<br>
The burning time depends on the weight of the coil and the composition of its ingredients . The combination and mixture of ingredients in the coil can affect its stability , strength and burning time . Burning time decides duration of the release of the Active Ingredient , and hence repels mosquitoes for the specified amount of time . Changing the overall weight per coil , or changing the composition of the coil itself, the ingredients and their specification , can alter burning time .<br>
Brown saw dust is considered as a good filler and burning material, for slow and continuous feed burning. This saw dust when mixed with coconut shell powder , give hardness to the coil , and also makes it easier and stable to burn. Wood flour , finely pulversised wood , is also an alternative used along with starch. Jigget is used for bonding of the various materials. Swellonil is starch powder used as an additive for strength. Sodium benzoate is a preservative which is It is bacteriostatic and fungistatic. Guar gum gives biding and strength to the coil. Potassium nitrate gives easy and safe burning property. Perfume is used for fragrance while burning , thereby giving a scent effect during the burning process. Color dye is used to give color to the mixture and the final coil.<br>
Drying is an important part of the process of manufacture . The drying time and temperature , moisture removal , are all key to the final strength , effective ness and burning time of the coil. Ideal drying conditions can help is lower heating fuel consumption and quicker production. Slower drying is better , but commercial manufacture slower drying would lead to higher costs . Fluctuating the temperature and controlling moisture , helps quicker drying time and lower fuel consumption.<br>
3<br><br>
...3...<br>
Four different combinations of ingredients were used in making mosquito coil with 0.005% Metofluthrin. For each example , the coils produced were tested for strength with drop tests from height of 3 feet . Due to batch drying process , separate coils from the mixture can have varying strength , hence 10 different coils are checked for each example.<br>
Burning time of the coil at room temperature of 30° C was done for all the 4 examples and the average burning time was calculated for each example . The ideal combination ingredients which gives the longest burning duration , with maximum strength , lowest breakage is best for commercial manufacture. All the 4 examples are for manufacture of coil using 0.005% Metofluthrin as active ingredient. The weight of coils from each example have been kept the same . Results of strength and burning time have varied in the 4 examples.<br><br><br>
