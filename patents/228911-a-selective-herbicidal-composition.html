				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present Invention relates to a selective herbicidai  composition  for controlling grasses and weeds in crops of cultivated plants, especially in crops of maize and cereals, which comprise a 3-hydroxy-4-(4-methylphenyl)-5-oxo-pyrazoline herbicides, a synergistically active amount of at least one second herbicide, as well as optionally an oil additive and/or a safener (antidote), and to the use of said compositions for controlling weeds in crops of cultivated plants.<br>
When applying herbicides, the cultivated plants may also suffer severe damage owing to factors that include the concentration of the herbicide and the mode of application, the cultivated plant itself, the nature of the soil, and the climatic conditions such as exposure to light, temperature and rainfall. To counteract this problem and similar ones, the proposal has already been made to use different compounds as safeners which are able to antagonise the harmful action of the herbicide on the cultivated plant, i.e. to protect the cultivated plant while leaving the herbicidai action on the weeds to be controlled virtually unimpaired.<br>
it has, however, been found that the proposed safeners often have a very specific action with respect not only to the cultivated plants but also to the herbicide, and in some cases also subject to the mode of application, i.e. a specific safener will often be suitable only for a specific cultivated plant and a specific class of herbicide or a specific herbicide. For example, it has been found that the safeners cloquintocet or cloquintocet-mexyl and mefenpyr or mefenpyr-diethyl, which are known from EP-A-0 191 736 (comp. 1.3.16) and WO 91/07874 (example 3) as well as from The Pesticide Manual, lied., British Crop Protection Council, Entry Nos. 154 and 462, can indeed protect the cultivated plants from the phytotoxic action of in particular 3-hydroxy-4-(4-methylphenyl)-5-oxo-pyra2oline derivatives, but partly attenuate the herbicidai action on weeds.<br>
It is known from US-A-4,834,908 that certain combinations of oil additives can increase the herbicidai action of compounds from the class of cyclohexanediones, benzothiadiazinone dioxides, diphenylether herbicides and aryloxyphenoxy herbicides.<br><br>
Although the 3-hydroxy-4-(4-methylphenyl)-5-oxo-pyrazoline derivatives are structurally completely different from the compounds disclosed in US-A-4,834,908, the combination of oil additives of this kind with these 3-hydroxy-4-(4-methylphenyl)-5-oxo-pyra2oline derivatives likewise leads to an increase in herbicidal action, but the cultivated plant is also harmed to a considerable extent. Therefore, this herbicide/oil additive mixture is not suitable for the selective control of weeds in crops of cultivated plants.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that, when using these special 3-hydroxy-4-(4-methyl-phenyl)-5-oxo-pyrazoline herbicides, weeds can be selectively controlled with great success without harming the cultivated plant, by applying these compounds in combination with a herbicidally synergistic amount of at least one second herbicide, and optionally also with an additive comprising an oil of vegetable or animal origin or a mineral oil, or the alkylesters thereof or mixtures of these oils and oil derivatives, and/or with the safeners cloquintocet or mefenpyr.<br>
The object of the present invention is thus a selective herbicidal composition comprising, in addition to customary inert formulation assistants such as carriers, solvents and wetting agents, as the active ingredient, a mixture of &gt; a) a herbicidally effective amount of a compound of formula I<br>

In the methods described in this application, if non-chiral educts are used, the unsymmetrically substituted compounds of formula I generally occur as racemales. The stereoisomers may then be separated by known methods, such as fractional crystallisation following salt formation with optically pure bases, acids or metal complexes, or by chromatographic methods, e.g. high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on acetyl cellulose, on the basis of physical-chemical properties. In the present invention, the compounds of formula I are understood to include both the concentrated and optically pure forms of each stereoisomer, and the racemates or diastereoisomers. If there is no specific reference to the individual optical antipodes, the racemic mixtures under the given formula are understood to be those which are obtained in the indicated preparation process. If there is an aliphatic C=C-double bond, then geometric isomerism may also occur.<br><br>
Depending on the type of substituents, the compounds of formula I may also exist as geometric and/or optical isomers and isomer mixtures, and as tautomers and tautomer mixtures. For example, the compounds of formula I, in which the group G signifies hydrogen, may exist in the following tautomeric equilibria.<br>

A solution of 177.6 g of methane sulfochioride in 400 ml of diethylether is added dropwise over the course of one hour to a solution, cooled to -10°C, of 80.6 g (0.76 mols) of diethylene glycol and 159.9 g (1.58 mols) of triethylamine in 1500 ml of diethylether, whereby the temperature is maintained at below 5°C. After stirring for 30 minutes at a temperature of 0°C, the cooling means is removed. After 2 hours, 12 ml of triethylamine and 12 ml of methane sulfochioride are added at a temperature of 20°C, and stirring continues for a further 4 hours. The white suspension obtained is subsequently added to a suction filter and the residue washed twice with 300 ml of diethylether. The filtration material is taken up in 2000 ml of ethyl acetate, the suspension stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and filtration is effected again. The filtrate obtained is concentrated by evaporation and the residue used without further purification for the next reaction. 216.5 g of the desired crude product (1) are obtained in the form of white crystals.<br>

After removing the cooling means and stirring for 3 hours at room temperature, and also for 45 minutes at ca. 40°C, the reaction mixture is added to a mixture of saturated ammonium chloride solution, ice and tert.-butylmethyl ether, the phases are separated and subsequently the organic phase is washed twice with water. After drying the organic phase with sodium sulphate, concentrating by evaporation and further drying at a temperature of 40°C under vacuum, 92.2 g of (3) are obtained in the form of a slightly yellow oil. The crude product is used in the next reaction without further purification.<br>

10.61 ml (76 mmols) of triethylamine are added to a suspension of 4.4 g (16.5 mmols) of (4) in 175 ml of xylene, and degassed (4 x vacuum/argon). The yellow suspension is subsequently heated to a temperature of 60°C and stirred for 3 hours. Then, 5.07 g (16.5 mmols) of (5) are added and heating effected to a bath temperature of 140°C, in order to continuously distill off the excess triethylamine and the resulting ethanol. After 3 hours, the reaction mixture is cooled to a temperature of 40°C and added to 100 ml of an ice/water mixture. The reaction mixture is rendered alkaline with aqueous 1N sodium hydroxide solution and the aqueous phase (contains the product) is washed twice with ethyl acetate. After twice washing back the organic phase with aqueous IN sodium hydroxide solution, the aqueous phases are combined, the remaining xylene distilled off and the combined aqueous phases adjusted to pH 2-3 with 4N HCI whilst cooling. The precipitating product is added to a suction filter, the residue of filtration washed with water and briefly with hexane, and then the residue of filtration is dried in a vacuum at a temperature of 60°C over P2O5. 4.08 g of (6) solid are obtained with a melting point of 189-191 °C (decomp.).<br>

The invention also relates to a method for the selective control of weeds in crops of cultivated plants, which comprises treating the cultivated plants, the seeds or seedlings or the crop area thereof, with a) a herbicidally effective amount of a herbicide of formula I,<br>
b)	a herbicidally synergistic amount of at least one herbicide selected from the classes of phenoxy-phenoxypropionic acids, hydroxylamines, sulfonylureas, imidazolinones, pyrimidines, triazines, ureas, PPO, chloroacetaniiides, phenoxyacetic acids, triazinones, dinitroanilines, azinones, carbamates, oxyacetamides, thiolcarbamates, azole-ureas, benzoic acids, anilides, nitriies, triones and sulfonamides, as well as the herbicides amitrol, benfuresate, bentazone, cinmethylin, clomazone, chlopyraiid, difenzoquat, dithiopyr, ethofumesate, flurochloridone, indanofane, isoxaben, oxaziclomefone, pyridate, pyridafol, quinchlorac, quinmerac, tridiphane, flamprop and glufosinate; and optionally<br>
c)	to antagonise the herbicide, an antidotally effective amount of a safener selected from cloquintocet, an alkali, alkaline earth, sulfonium or ammonium cation of cloqulntocet, cloquintocet-mexyl, mefenpyr, an alkali, alkaline earth, sulfonium or ammonium cation of mefenpyr and mefenpyr-diethyl; and/or<br>
d)	an additive comprising an oil of vegetable or animal origin, a mineral oil, the alkylesters thereof or mixtures of these oils and oil derivatives.<br><br>
The cultivated plants which may be protected against the harmful action of the above-mentioned herbicides by the safeners cloquintocet, an alkali, alkaline earth, sulfonium or ammonium cation of cloquintocet, or cloquintocet-mexyl, mefenpyr, an alkali, alkaline earth, sulfonium or ammonium cation of mefenpyr, or mefenpyr-diethyl, are in particular cereals, cotton, soya, sugar beet, sugar cane, plantations, rape, maize and rice, especially maize and cereals. Crops will also be understood to mean those crops that have been made tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides by conventional breeding or genetic engineering methods. These are e.g. IMI Maize, Poast Protected Maize (sethoxydim tolerance), Liberty Link Maize, B.t./Liberty Link Maize, IMI/Liberty Link Maize, IMI/Liberty Link /B.t. Maize, Roundup Ready Maize and Roundup Ready/B.t. Maize.<br>
The weeds to be controlled may be both dicot weeds, and preferably monocot weeds, for example the monocot weeds Avena, Agrostis, Phalaris, Lolium, Bromus, Alopecurus, Setaria, Digitaria Brachiaria, Echinochloa, Panicum, Sorghum haUbic, Rottboellia, Cyperus, Brachiaria, Echinochloa, Scirpus, Monochoria, and Sagittaria and the dicot weeds Sinapis, Chenopodium, Stellaria, Galium, Viola, Veronica, Matricaria, Papaver, Solanum Abutilon, Sida, Xanthium, Amaranthus, Ipomoea and Chrysanthemum.<br>
Crop areas will be understood as meaning the areas already under cultivation with the cultivated plants or seeds thereof, as well as the areas intended for cropping with said cultivated plants.<br>
Depending on the end use, a safener according to the invention can be used for pretreatlng seeds of the crop plants (dressing of seeds or seedlings) or it can be incorporated in the soil before or after sowing. It can, however, also be applied by itself alone or together with the herbicide and the oil additive postemergence. Treatment of the plant or the seeds with the safener can therefore in principle be carried out irrespective of the time of application of the herbicide. Treatment of the plant can, however, also be carried out by simultaneous application of the herbicide, oil additive and safener (e.g. as tank mixture). The concentration of safener with respect to the herbicide will depend substantially on the mode of application. Where a field treatment is carried out either by using a tank mixture with a combination of safener and herbicide or by separate application of safener and herbicide, the ratio of herbicide to safener will usually be from 100:1 to 1:10, preferably 20:1 to 1:1. In<br><br>
field treatment it is usual to apply 0.001 to 1.0 kg/ha, preferably 0.001 to 0.25 kg/ha, of safener.<br>
The concentration of herbicide is usually in the range from 0.001 to 2 kg/ha, but will preferably be from 0.005 to 1 kg/ha.<br>
In the composition of the invention, the compound of formula I is present in relation to the second herbicide in a weight ratio of 1 : 100 to 1000 : 1.<br>
In the composition according to the invention, the application rates of oil additive are as a rule between 0.01 and 2% based on the spray mixture. For example, the oil additive can be added to the spray tank in the desired concentration after preparation of the spray mixture.<br>
Preferred oil additives contain mineral oils or an oil of vegetable origin, for example rapeseed oil, olive oil or sunflower oil, alkyl esters of oils of vegetable origin, for example the methyl derivatives, or an oil of animal origin, such as fish oil or beef tallow.<br>
Particularly preferred oil additives contain alkylesters of higher fatty acids (C8-C22), especially the methyl derivatives of C12-C18 fatty acids, for example the methylesters of lauric acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid. These esters are known as methyl laurate (CAS-111-82-0), methyl palmitate (CAS-112-39-0) and methyl oleate (CAS-112-62-9).<br>
The application and efficacy of the oil additives can be improved by combining them with<br>
surface-active substances, such as non-ionic, anionic or cationic surfactants. Examples of<br>
suitable anionic, non-ionic, and cationic surfactants are listed in WO 97/34485 on pages 7<br>
and 8.	"'	     ~"" "<br>
Preferred surface-active substances are anionic surfactants of the dodecylbenzene sulfonate type , especially the calcium salts thereof, as well as non-ionic surfactants of the fatty alcohol ethoxylate type. Especially preferred are ethoxylated Ci2-C22-fatty alcohols with a degree of ethoxylation of between 5 and 40. Examples of commercially available, preferred surfactants are the Genapol types (Ciariant AG, Muttenz, Switzerland). The concentration of surface-active substances in relation to the total additive is in general between 1 and 30% by weight.<br><br>
Examples of oil additives, which comprise mixtures of oils or mineral oils, or the derivatives thereof, with surfactants, are Edenor ME SU®, Emery 2231® (Henkel Tochtergesellschaft Cognis GMBH, DE), Turbocharge® (Zeneca Agro, Stoney Creek, Ontario , CA) or, most preferably, Actipron® (BP Oil UK Limited, GB).<br>
Furthermore, the addition of an organic solvent to the oil additive/surfactant mixture can effect a further increase in efficacy. Suitable solvents are for example the Solvesso® (ESSO) or Aromatic Solvent® (Exxon Corporation) types. The concentration of such solvents may be from 10 to 80% by weight of the total weight.<br>
Oil additives of this kind, which are also described for example in US-A-4.834.908, are particularly preferred for the composition according to the invention. A most particularly preferred oil additive is known under the name MERGE® which can be obtained from the BASF Corporation and is basically described for example in US-A-4.834.908 in column 5, as example COC-1. A further preferred oil additive according to the invention is SCORE® (Novartis Crop Protection Canada).<br>
The compositions of this invention are suitable for all methods of application commonly used in agriculture, including preemergence application, postemergence application and seed dressing.<br>
For seed dressing, 0.001 to 10 g of safener/kg of seeds, preferably 0.05 to 6 g of safener/kg of seeds, is usually applied. If the safener is used in liquid form shortly before sowing to effect soaking, then it is preferred to use safener solutions that contain the active ingredient in a concentration of 1 to 10000 ppm, preferably of 10 to 1000 ppm.<br>
For application, it is preferred to process the safeners according to the invention, or mixtures of the safeners and the herbicides and the oil additives, conveniently together with the customary assistants of formulation technology to formulations, typically to emulsifiable concentrates, coatable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granulates or microcapsules.<br><br>
Such formulations are described, for example, in WO 97/34485 on pages 9 to 13. The formulations are prepared in known manner, conveniently by homogeneously mixing and/or grinding the active ingredients with liquid or solid formulation assistants, typically solvents or solid carriers. Surface-active compounds (surfactants) may additionally be used for preparing the formulations. Solvents and solid carriers that are suitable for this purpose are described in WO 97/34485 on page 6.<br>
Depending on the herbicide of formula I to be formulated, suitable surface-active compounds are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants and surfactant mixtures having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. Examples of suitable anionic, non-ionic, and cationic surfactants are listed in WO 97/34485 on pages 7 and 8. Also the surfactants customarily for the art of formulation and described, inter alia, in "Mc Cutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual" MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood New Jersey, 1981, Stache, H., "Tensid-Taschenbuch" (Handbook of Surfactants), Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich/Vienna, 1981, and M. and J. Ash, "Encyclopedia of Surfactants", Vol l-lll, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1980-81 are suitable for manufacture of the herbicides according to the invention.<br>
The herbicidal compositions will usually contain from 0.1 to 99% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 95% by weight, of compound mixture of the compound of formula I, the second synergistically active herbicide and optionally the safeners according to the invention, 0 to 2% by weight of the oil additive according to the invention, from 1 to 99.9% by weight of a solid or liquid formulation assistant, and from 0 to 25% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant. Whereas it is customarily preferred to formulate commercial products as concentrates, the end user will normally use dilute formulations.<br>
The compositions may also contain further ingredients, such as: stabilisers, e.g. where appropriate epoxidised vegetable oils (epoxidised coconut oil, rapeseed oil, or soybean oil); antifoams, typically silicone oil; preservatives; viscosity regulators; binders; tackifiers; as well as fertilisers or other chemical agents. Different methods and techniques may suitably be used for applying the safeners according to the invention or compositions containing them for protecting cultivated plants from the harmful effects of herbicides of formula I, conveniently the following:<br><br>
i) Seed dressing<br>
a)	Dressing the seeds with a wettable powder formulation of the active Ingredient of the safeners according to the invention by shaking in a vessel until uniformly distributed on the surface of the seeds (dry treatment), In this instance, approximately 1 to 500 g of active ingredient of the safeners according to the invention (4 g to 2 kg of wettable powder) is used per 100 kg of seeds.<br>
b)	Dressing seeds with an emulsifiable concentrate of the safeners according to the inventbn by method a) (wet treatment).<br>
c)	Dressing by immersing the seeds in a mixture containing 100-1000 ppm of safeners according to the invention for 1 to 72 hours and where appropriate subsequently drying them (seed soaking).<br>
In keeping with the natural environment, the preferred method of application is either seed dressing or treatment of the germinated seedlings, because the safener treatment is fully concentrated on the target crop. Usually 1 to 1000 g, preferably 5 to 250 g, of safener is used per 100 kg of seeds. However, depending on the method employed, which also permits the use of other chemical agents or micronutrients, the concentrations may deviate above or below the indicated limit values (repeat dressing).<br>
ii) Application as a tank mixture<br>
A liquid formulation of a mixture of safener and herbicide (reciprocal ratio from 20:1 to 1:100) is used, the concentration of herbicide being from 0.005 to 5.0 kg/ha. The oil additive may be added to the tank mixture in an amount of preferably 0.01 to 2% by weight. This tank mixture is applied before or after sowing.<br>
ill) Application in the furrow<br>
The safener formulated as emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder or granulate is applied to the open furrow in which the seeds have been sown. After covering the furrow, the herbicide is applied pre-emergence in conventional manner, optionally In combination with the oil additive.<br>
iv) Controlled release of compound<br><br>
A solution of the safener is applied to a mineral granular carrier or to a polymerised granulate (urea/formaldehyde) and then dried. A coating can then be applied (coated granules) that allows the active Ingredient to be released at a controlled rate over a specific period of time.<br>
Particularly preferred formulations are made up as follows:<br>
% = percent by weight; compound mixture means the mixture of compound of formula I with the synergistically active second herbicide and optionally with the safeners according to the invention and/or the oil additives)<br><br>

It is often expedient to formulate herbicides (optionally in combination with the oil additive) and the safeners separately and not to combine them until shortly before application in the applicator in the desired mixing ratio in the form of a 'lank mix" in water. The herbicides and the safener may also be formulated individually and combined shortly before application in the applicator in the desired mixing ratio in the form of a 'lank mix" in water, and then to add. the oil additive.<br>
The selective herbicidal action of the compositions according to the invention is depicted in the following examples.<br>
Biological Examples<br>
Example B1: Postemergence test:<br>
The test plants are raised in pots under greenhouse conditions until reaching a post-application stage. Standard soil is used as the growing medium. In a post-emergence stage, the herbicides are applied to the test plants both on their own and in a mixture with safeners and/or oil additives, or are applied to crop plants raised from seed previously dressed with safeners. They are applied as an emulsion [prepared from an emulsion concentrate (example F1, c)] of the test substances. The rates of application depend on the optimum dosages determined under field or greenhouse conditions. Evaluation of the tests is made after 2 to 4 weeks (% action = completely dead; 0% action = no phytotoxic action). The oil additive used is ACTIPRON® in a concentration of 0.5% by weight of the spray liquor.<br>

comp. no. 1.007 + Clodinafop-propargyl + Cloquintocet-mexyl + ACTIPRON®	30 + 15 + 7.5	94<br>
comp. no. 1.007 +	30 + 20 + 7.5	96<br><br>
Compound mixture	concentration in g/ha	phytotoxic action on Alopecurus in %<br>
Clodinafop-propargyl + Cloquintocet-mexyl + ACTIPRON®		<br>
comp. no. 1.007 + Clodinafop-propargyl + Cloquintocet-mexyl + ACTIPRON®	45 + 15 + 11.25	92<br>
comp. no. 1.007 + Clodinafop-propargyl + Cloquintocet-mexyl + ACTIPRON®	45 + 20 + 11,25	96<br>
comp. no. 1.007 + Clodinafop-propargyl + Cloquintocet-mexyl + ACTIPRON®	60 + 15 + 15	98<br>
comp. no. 1.007 + Clodinafop-propargyl + Cloquintocet-mexyl + ACTIPRON®	60 + 20 + 15	99<br>
The tests show that the herbicide component Clodinafop-propargyl in combination with the safener Cloquintocet-mexyl and the oil additive ACTIPRON® achieve herbicidal action of only 40% on Alopecurus w\{h a total application rate of herbicide/safener of 40 g/ha. The compound of formula I (no. 1.007) in combination with the safener Cloquintocet-mexyl and the oil additive ACTIPRON® achieve no herbicidal action at all on Alopecurus at 4 tested application rates, and only 40% with the highest application rate (125 + 31.25 g/ha). Surprisingly, the combination according to the invention of the herbicide of formula I (no. 1.007) with Clodinafop-propargyl, the safener Cloquintocet-mexyl and the oil additive ACTIPRON® is, however, in a position to almost totally eradicate Alopecurus at all the tested application rates (92 to 99% action).<br><br>
A similar effect is obsen/ed if the oil additive MERGE® is used instead of ACTIPRON®.<br>
Example B2: Postemergence test:<br>
The test plants are raised in pots under greenhouse conditions until reaching a post-application stage. Standard soil Is used as the growing medium. In a postemergence stage, the herbicides are applied to the test plants both on their own and in a mixture with safeners and/or oil additives, or are applied to crop plants raised from seed previously dressed with safeners. They are applied as an emulsion [prepared from an emulsion concentrate (example F1, c)] of the test substance. The rates of application depend on the optimum dosages determined under field or greenhouse conditions. Evaluation of the tests is made after 2 to 4 weeks (% action = completely dead; 0% action = no phytotoxic action). The oil additive used is MERGE® in a concentration of 0.7% by weight of the spray liquor.<br><br>

From Tables 82.1 to B 2.4, it can be deduced that the addition of the oil additive MERGE® to a mixture of 2 herbicides and one safener leads to a surprising increase in herbicidal action on the weeds without harming the crops.<br><br><br>
