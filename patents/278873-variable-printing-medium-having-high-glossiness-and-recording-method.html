Title of Invention<br>
VARIABLE PRINTING MEDIUM HAVING HIGH GLOSSINESS,<br>
AND RECORDING METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a recording medium which can<br>
achieve a high quality image and a high quality tone as excellent as those<br>
of a silver halide photograph at a low cost by an inkjet method and can be<br>
further used in offset printing and electrophotography, an ink medium set,<br>
and an inkjet recording method using these, as well as to ink recorded<br>
matter.<br>
Background Art<br>
Inkjet (IJ) recording technologies have met with developments of<br>
general technologies, including various peripheral technologies; such as<br>
hardware such as inkjet heads, and printer systems; supplies such as ink<br>
media; and controlling methods for controlling image treatment, and<br>
other systems, and thereby achieve high quality images which may be<br>
superior to those of a silver halide photograph at present, and are<br>
established as IJ printing technologies. The IJ printing technologies<br>
using aqueous inks and porous media are widely used among general<br>
consumers because of their handiness, as disclosed particularly in Patent<br>
Literatures (PTLs) 1 and 2, and are in the recent years used such that the<br>
 <br>
silver halide photographic method may be replaced by the IJ printing<br>
technologies. Accordingly, these IJ technologies are increasingly used in<br>
the field of printing industries. There are generally two applications of<br>
the IJ technologies in the printing industries at present.<br>
One of the applications is in so-called "horizontally developed"<br>
technologies which are widely used among general consumers. This is<br>
an application where a small amount of high quality images is printed on<br>
IJ media, regular paper, and the like, and the application is represented<br>
by use of a proof machine using a wide format printer and use for forming<br>
signs. The IJ printing technologies have met with a great success with<br>
respect to this application and a very large market for this application<br>
has been already established.<br>
The other of the application, which especially attracts attention<br>
recently, is an application in so-called variable printing which is capable<br>
of printing at very high speed, though which does not require a press<br>
plate. So far, the application of the IJ printing technologies in such<br>
variable printing has been studied and put into practical use since a long<br>
time ago as disclosed in, for example, PTLs 3 and 4, and is so far mostly<br>
applications in the field in which relatively high image quality is not<br>
required, such as in the field in which mainly letters and rules are<br>
printed, such as for fee specifications, issued invoices, and address<br>
printing.<br>
That is, for example, PTL 3 discloses an inkjet recording sheet<br>
having an offset printing layer on one side of base paper, and an inkjet<br>
<br>
 <br>
recording coat layer on the other side, wherein the base paper is subjected<br>
to surface coating and size press treatment with a size press liquid<br>
containing, for main components, 0.5 g/m2 to 3.0 g/m2 of an aqueous<br>
polymer resin (a cation resin described below or a normal starch-based<br>
size agent capable of preventing elution of an aqueous polyvalent metal<br>
salt), 0.1 g/m2 to 2.0 g/m2 of a cation resin (for improving water resistance<br>
of a dye ink and print density of a pigment ink), and 0.1 g/m2 to 2.0 g/m2<br>
of an aqueous polyvalent metal salt chelating agent (for improving ink<br>
absorption and preventing neighboring ink spots having different colors<br>
from bleeding and overlapping); and thereby improving ink absorption<br>
and at the same time keeping a sizing degree of the base paper low in<br>
inkjet recording on one side! and thereby preventing degradation of print<br>
resistance with an excessive absorption of dampening water at the time of<br>
offset printing on the reverse side, at the same time preventing exuding<br>
of inks at the time of writing on the reverse side with a fountain pen or an<br>
aqueous ink pen, and preventing degradation of offset printing or print<br>
resistance in printing on the reverse side of the base paper which<br>
degradation is due to elution of a cationic material used for improving<br>
water resistance of a dye ink or improving print density of a pigment ink<br>
in offset printing. However, this base paper does not have an ink<br>
absorption layer produced by a cast coating method, thus, cannot achieve<br>
a glossy inkjet record. In addition, this invention has two types of<br>
printing surface, that is, an offset printing surface and an inkjet<br>
recording surface each on one side of the paper, and this invention does<br>
<br>
 <br>
not described an application in electrophotography.<br>
PTL 4 discloses printing coated paper having on a surface of base<br>
paper a first coat composed of 1.0 g/m2 to 2.0 g/m2 of a cationic material<br>
(an alkylamine/ammonia/epichlorohydrine polycondensate which has a<br>
molecular weight of 20,000 or less and is capable of reacting with an<br>
anionic site of inks of an inkjet aqueous ink which contain a direct dye or<br>
an acid dye), and a second coat produced on the first coat with a coating<br>
liquid containing a SBR latex binder, which does not contain an aqueous<br>
resin but contains 20% by mass or more of an acrylonitrile component<br>
portion, and 30% by mass or more of light calcium carbonate as a pigment,<br>
wherein the coated layers are super-calendered such that an on-demand<br>
inkjet print part can be formed on blank space of an offset print part as<br>
required. However, also this coated paper does not contain an ink<br>
absorbing layer produced by a cast coating method, thus, cannot achieve a<br>
glossy inkjet record. In addition, an application in electrophotography is<br>
not mentioned in this patent application.<br>
PTL 5 discloses an inkjet recording medium having a normal<br>
undercoat layer which is on a substrate, and an ink absorbing layer<br>
produced by a cast coating method (a glazed finish of the coat surface<br>
produced with a heated mirror drum) on the under coat layer, wherein<br>
the ink absorbing layer is formed with a coating liquid, and the coating<br>
liquid contains a precipitated silica, which has a relatively low BET<br>
specific surface area(81 m2/g to 200 m2/g), a relatively low oil absorption<br>
amount (144 ml/100g to 200 ml/100g), and a particle diameter not<br>
<br>
 <br>
WO 2010/107128	PCT/JP2010/055142<br>
excessively small (particle diameter: 1.3 µm to 2.3 µm), and which is<br>
selected from silica pigments that have hiding power stronger than those<br>
of other body pigments, have a transparent appearance, a high BET<br>
specific area, and a large oil absorption amount, thus, have excellent ink<br>
absorption and color developing ability, with the precipitated silica being<br>
added into the coating liquid in an amount of 60% by mass to 80% by<br>
mass of the under coat layer, and contains a binding agent which is<br>
incorporated in the coating liquid in a semi moist state immediately after<br>
production in an amount of 3% by mass to 50% by mass per 100 parts by<br>
mass of the total pigment, thereby the binding agent preventing<br>
secondary aggregation caused by its high activity in the coating liquid<br>
and avoiding excessively high viscosity of the coating liquid, and wherein<br>
the ink absorbing layer is made uniform thereby.<br>
However, this inkjet recording medium has an undercoat layer<br>
and indirectly achieves high ink absorption using the silica body pigment,<br>
making it difficult to produce color images having deeply toned colors that<br>
can be produced by an adequate penetration of the ink in the depth<br>
direction into the ink coated layer.<br>
These originate from weak points intrinsic to the IJ technologies.<br>
In addition to the above Patent Literatures, PTL 6 discloses offset<br>
paper having a coated layer casted according to a casting method using<br>
an aqueous coating liquid containing, at the time of preparing the coating<br>
liquid, 3% by mass to 30% by mass of a body pigment that does not have a<br>
high oil absorption amount measured according to JISK-5101 (oil<br>
<br>
 <br>
absorption amount thereof 70 ml/100g to 280 ml/100g) as a pigment<br>
excellent in dispersibility (such as white carbon, diatomaceous earth,<br>
calcined diatomaceous earth, calcined clay, flux calcined diatomaceous<br>
earth, fine particulate anhydrous aluminum hydroxide, fine particulate<br>
titanium oxide, fine particulate anhydrous silica, magnesium carbonate),<br>
and 3% by mass to 30% by mass of a styrene-butadiene- methyl<br>
methacrylate terpolymer latex which is produced by copolymerizing a<br>
methyl methacrylate component in a mass ratio of the methyl<br>
methacrylate component to a styrene-butadiene copolymer portion of 10%<br>
by mass to 40% by mass in the styrene-butadiene copolymer which is<br>
characterized in its excellent adhesion strength and hardness of a film<br>
thereof. According to this Patent Literature, this technology can prevent<br>
ink piling at the time of offset rotary printing using a polychromatic<br>
printing system (a phenomenon in which ink deposited on a paper surface<br>
with the first trunk of a blanket is reverse transferred onto the second or<br>
later trunk of the blanket, thereby reducing image density of the printed<br>
matter in a corresponding manner, or in the severe case, making the ink<br>
piled up and making the reverse transferred ink retransferred onto<br>
printed matter to produce contamination) because of the existence of a<br>
methyl methacrylate component in the ink absorbing layer. Use of the<br>
inkjet printing method is not considered in this technology, and no<br>
electrophotograqphical application of the invention of this patent<br>
application is described in this patent application.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Most of the present IJ technologies are those in which drops of a<br>
low-solid-content ink are ejected from a head, attached in a liquid state<br>
on a medium, and then dried and solidified according to some method.<br>
IJ technologies for general consumers or wide format IJ technologies<br>
depend on ink absorption of a medium for most part of the ink drying. It<br>
is very difficult to realize both of the ink drying and high speed printing<br>
in a balanced manner, without using IJ media or regular paper.<br>
Especially in the field of variable printing among the fields of<br>
these industries, expensive IJ paper which is preferable for general<br>
consumer's use or for use in some proof machines has not been used very<br>
much because of very hard limitations on the use of this product set by<br>
factors of productivity and printing cost. Therefore, as a result of<br>
making ink drying ability and costs first priority, only regular paper has<br>
been available in the field of variable printing so far. Especially for<br>
printing in which high quality glossy images are desired, such as for<br>
printing high-grade catalogs, fancy boxes, magazine covers, or direct<br>
mails, only realistic measures for using high-speed inkjet printing have<br>
been using very expensive media. On the other hand, when cheap<br>
regular paper is used, it is difficult to produce high quality images<br>
because that ink dots spread on the paper and that the ink penetrates the<br>
paper so severely that high density images are not reproducible. When<br>
so-called "IJ printers for general consumers" are used and images are<br>
printed at high speed, it is impossible to reproduce, at a low cost, high<br>
quality printed matter such as those printed on IJ glossy paper.<br>
<br>
 <br>
While the IJ method and IJ glossy paper begin to be partly used<br>
in minilab for industrial purpose, from the view point of difficulty in use<br>
the practical use of the above medium is for use in DPE where consumers<br>
may purchase the printed matter printed on the above medium in spite of<br>
a relatively high unit cost of printing, at present, because of a still high<br>
price of the above medium. Therefore, at present, in order to practically<br>
use these IJ photoprinting methods in industrial fields, it is necessary to<br>
reduce the cost of the above medium in some way.<br>
IJ media mainly for expected photographical use such as those<br>
mentioned above are, at present, mainly classified into RC glossy paper<br>
produced by laminating absorbing layers on resin coat (RC) paper as base<br>
paper, and IJ cast coated paper which uses, as base paper, high quality<br>
paper or coat paper surface layer of which is mirrored according to a cast<br>
coating method. The IJ cast coated paper, which uses cheaper base<br>
paper and achieves higher production efficiency than the RC glossy paper<br>
than the RC glossy paper, can be produced to some extent at a lower cost<br>
than the RC glossy paper, however, needs to be equipped with an ink<br>
absorbing layer using raw materials for IJ cast coated paper so as to<br>
achieve both excellent ink absorption and high glossiness, and thus is<br>
inadequate for use in usual commercial printing because of a still-high<br>
cost thereof.<br>
In addition, it is known that when offset printing or<br>
electrophotographic printing is performed with respect to these IJ media,<br>
various problems are known to occur. In the case of offset printing, an<br>
<br>
 <br>
acid component contained in the IJ media is well known to<br>
disadvantageously cause contamination of blocks and poor ink fixation.<br>
In the case of electrophotographic printing, the media is well known to<br>
fuse in the heater configured to fix toner and, thereby, cause machine<br>
failure.<br>
Also conventional IJ media themselves may cause, because of the<br>
limitations on materials which can be used in the ink absorbing layer,<br>
powder down at the time of media cut and cracking of a coat film at the<br>
time of paper folding in bookbinding, and thus they can be said to have<br>
been media difficult to use in the industrial fields.<br>
Accordingly, IJ glossy paper is rarely used in large amounts for<br>
industrial purposes at present.<br>
On the other hand, the above-mentioned cast coating paper is<br>
representative glazed paper that is used in large amounts in printing<br>
industries and is used in general offset printing, and the like. However,<br>
the above-mentioned cast coating paper for offset printing is not equipped<br>
with an absorbing layer for absorbing an ink, which is different from the<br>
cast coating paper for IJ printing, and could not be used for IJ printing<br>
application. When images are inkjet printed on normal commercial<br>
printing coat paper, the ink absorption and wettability of the resulting<br>
printed matter are degraded, and the images spread and the printed<br>
matter becomes difficult to dry, making the use of the normal commercial<br>
printing coat paper for inkjet printing impractical.<br>
<br>
 <br>
A printing medium which can be used in every printing method is<br>
desired in the variable printing. When the variable printing is used, it<br>
becomes possible to offset print a basic area in the pages, which is not<br>
required to be offset printed, in large number at a low cost, and to print<br>
other area in the pages according to at least one of an electrophotographic<br>
method or an inkjet method. Also from the viewpoint of reduction of<br>
productive/economical risk of insufficient selection of the similar types of<br>
goods which are produced by a media maker for different printing method<br>
the goods use, a mighty medium which can be used in various printing<br>
methods is desired.<br>
However, there have been no medium that can be used in all of<br>
electrophotography, offset printing, and inkjet printing, except regular<br>
paper.<br>
Particularly, it has been considered technically very difficult to<br>
produce, at a low cost, a medium that can be used in all the printing<br>
methods and can produce glazed surfaces. Because the realization of<br>
such media will dramatically widen the range of applications of the<br>
variable printing, such media has been strongly desired.<br>
The present inventors tested an inkjet recording method that can<br>
reproduce, at a low cost, texture of the recorded matter similar to those of<br>
silver halide photographs, so as to use the inkjet recording method using<br>
an aqueous pigment in commercial printing, particularly, in photographic<br>
image quality printing in which high quality images are desired.<br>
<br>
 <br>
The present invention discloses an example in which a pigment<br>
ink having high penetration ability, such as those described in PTL 7, is<br>
used in combination with a medium having a low ink absorption, which is<br>
in contrast to the conventional media, to realize an image forming method<br>
that can be used at a low cost on commercial printing paper, and the like.<br>
It becomes possible, by this method, to inkjet print even on such<br>
low-ink-absorption paper as commercial printing paper or publication<br>
printing paper which has been considered inappropriate for inkjet<br>
printing.<br>
However, it has been difficult to print a quality photograph<br>
having a glazed surface at a practical speed in variable printing even<br>
when this method is used. The cast coating paper has excessively poor<br>
ink absorption among many types of commercial printing paper, exuding<br>
images when images are printed at a high speed, producing image<br>
degradation that can not be neglected when high quality photographic<br>
images are reproduced, making the use of the cast coating paper<br>
impractical.<br>
Furthermore, regarding coated layers on the base paper, the<br>
present inventors have, so far, proposed an inkjet recording method (PTL<br>
8) including at least printing on a recording medium with an aqueous ink,<br>
wherein the recording medium is composed of a support containing<br>
cellulose pulp as a main component, and one or more of coated layer is<br>
deposited on at least one side of the support, the coated layer contains a<br>
pigment and an adhesive, the amount of cationic additives in the total<br>
<br>
 <br>
amount of materials forming the coated layer is 0.1% by mass or less, the<br>
60° glossiness of the most outer layer of the recording medium as defined<br>
in JIS-ZS-8741 is 13 or less and the cut off value of the most outer layer of<br>
the recording medium is 0.8 um, and wherein the aqueous ink contains at<br>
least particulate color material, resin emulsion, water, and a moistening<br>
agent, and the solid content of the aqueous ink is 3% by mass or more.<br>
However, it is necessary to investigate compatibility of the coated layer<br>
with the base paper supporting the coated layer in addition to the coated<br>
layer.<br>

to regular inkjet paper, and glossiness comparable to silver halide<br>
photograph, easily, and at high speed.<br>
Further, another object is to provide an ideal inkjet media for an<br>

glazed surface and which can be used in various printing methods, the<br>
combined use thereof has been considered difficult to achieve.<br>
Description of Embodiments<br>
(Printing media)<br>
A medium according to the present invention can be used in both<br>
offset printing and electrophotography, in addition to in inkjet printing,<br>
and has a characteristic material composition of the coated layer such<br>
that the production cost can be reduced. Furthermore, the inkjet ink<br>
used in combination with this medium is an ink containing particulate<br>
color material that has high penetration ability suitable for this media.<br>
When not only the medium is optimized, but also the ink used in<br>
combination with this medium is optimized for this medium, it becomes<br>
possible to realize a medium which can be used in almost all the principal<br>
printing methods available at present.<br>
<base paper>
<br>
Base paper used in the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited, as long as it is paper composed of plant fiber, and is preferably<br>
high quality paper in which preferably at least the side of the paper to be<br>
coated with a coating liquid is sized and pressed. This is so, because<br>
that when the base paper has not been sized, a coating liquid tends to<br>
 <br>
penetrate nonuniformly into the paper at the time when a cast coating<br>
layer (a coating layer) is laminated on the base paper, making stable<br>
mirror surface formation difficult.<br>
On the other hand, when electrophotographic printing is carried<br>
out using a medium having low air permeability or no air permeability,<br>
such as RC base paper used in silver halide photography, problems tend<br>
to occur. In the electrophotographic method, most of the methods for<br>
fixing toner are methods of nipping paper with a heated roller to fuse the<br>
toner. In this case, moisture contained in the paper is heated and swells<br>
as water vapor. In the case of the RC paper, this water vapor may not be<br>
smoothly discharged from the paper and may foam in the base paper.<br>
The pulp composition or the beating conditions used in the base<br>
paper is not particularly limited, may be selected from conventional ones,<br>
and examples thereof include virgin chemical pulp (CP) which is obtained<br>
by chemically treating wood and its fibrous material, such as a virgin<br>
chemical pulp, a bleached hardwood kraft pulp, a bleached softwood kraft<br>
pulp, an unbleached hard wood kraft pulp, an unbleached soft wood kraft<br>
pulp, a bleached hard wood sulfite pulp, a bleached softwood sulfite pulp,<br>
an unbleached hardwood sulfite pulp, an unbleached softwood sulfite pulp,<br>
and the like; and virgin mechanical pulp (MP) which is obtained by<br>
mechanically treating wood and its fibrous material, such as a ground<br>
pulp, a chemi-ground pulp, a chemi-mechanical pulp, a semi-chemical<br>
pulp, and the like. The recycle pulp can also be used in the support, and<br>
raw materials of the recycle pulp are, for example, paper defined as terms<br>
 <br>
of "high white", "line white", "cream white card", "special white", "mild<br>
white", "imitation", "pale", "Kent", "white art", "special high cut",<br>
"separate high cut", "news paper", "magazine", and the like in Standard<br>
Chart of Recycled Paper, produced by Paper Recycling Promotion Center<br>
that is Japanese non-profit foundation (the above-mentioned definitions<br>
can be found in the chart).<br>
The internal additives used in the base paper are, for example,<br>
calcium carbonates such as light calcium carbonate and heavy calcium<br>
carbonate. These may be used in combination with a conventionally<br>
known white pigment. Examples of the white pigments include<br>
inorganic white pigments such as kaolin, clay, talc, calcium sulfate,<br>
barium sulfate, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, zinc carbonate,<br>
satin white, aluminum silicate, diatomaceous earth, calcium silicate,<br>
magnesium silicate, synthetic silica, aluminum hydroxide, alumina,<br>
lithopone, zeolite, magnesium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide;<br>
organic pigments such as styrene plastic pigment, acrylic plastic pigment,<br>
polyethylene, microcapsule, urea resin and melamine resin. These may<br>
be used alone or in combination.<br>
The internally adding sizing agent used in the base paper is not<br>
particularly limited and may be suitably selected from conventional<br>
internally adding sizing agents used for high quality paper. Suitable<br>
internally adding sizing agents are, for example, a rosin sizing agent.<br>
The amount of the internally adding sizing agent is 0.1 parts by<br>
mass to 0.7 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of bone-dry pulp,<br>
 <br>
but it is not limited thereto.<br>
Surface sizing agent used in the present invention is not<br>
particularly limited, as long as it can provide an effect of sizing, and may<br>
be suitably selected from those used for regular acid-free high quality<br>
paper, considering the compatibility with the internally adding pigment.<br>
Specific examples thereof include an aqueous solution of a<br>
styrene-acrylate copolymer, a styrene-methacrylate copolymer, a<br>
styrene-maleate copolymer, and an olefin-maleate copolymer.<br>
These surface sizing agents may be used alone for application<br>
onto paper, however, it is desirable to mix these surface sizing agents<br>
with other components such as starch, modified starch, and an inorganic<br>
salt to prepare a coating liquid for application onto paper.<br>
Methods for applying these surface sizing agent are not<br>
particularly limited, and are preferably a method including impregnating<br>
and attaching these surface sizing agents with a size press provided in a<br>
paper machine, such as a conventional size press, a gate roll size press, or<br>
a film transfer size press, and finishing with an oil machine, from the<br>
viewpoint of cost.<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned agents, raw materials<br>
generally used in base paper making, such as paper strength additives,<br>
pH adjusters, and various surfactants may be suitably used depending on<br>
the purpose.<br>
<cast coating layer><br>
 <br>
An ink absorbing layer is not necessarily provided on a printing<br>
medium, which is different from regular inkjet cast coating paper. In<br>
the printing medium, a cast coating layer instead of an IJ absorbing layer<br>
may be formed on a surface of the base paper in the same manner as in<br>
so-called commercial printing cast coating paper.<br>
A coating liquid for forming the above-mentioned cast coating<br>
layer may be different from conventional inkjet cast coating paper or<br>
conventional commercial printing coating paper. Main components of<br>
the coating liquid are a pigment, an adhesive, and a releasing agent.<br>
Specific description of the components contained in the aqueous<br>
coating composition is as follows.<br>
- Pigment -<br>
The pigments essential for the cast coating layer of the medium of<br>
the present invention are kaolin and amorphous silica. When one of the<br>
essential pigment components is absent, it becomes difficult to use the<br>
medium in various printing methods, wherein the capability of using the<br>
medium in various printing methods is a characteristic of the medium of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Kaolin includes first-grade kaolin, second-grade kaolin, and<br>
third-grade kaolin, as well as calcined kaolin.<br>
It is necessary to precisely control the amount of amorphous silica<br>
such that the amount of amorphous silica is 3% by mass to 20% by mass<br>
in the total solid content of the coating layer. When the amount of<br>
amorphous silica is less than 3%, the resulting medium cannot be used in<br>
 <br>
inkjet printing. When the amount of amorphous silica is more than 20%,<br>
resistance to color change (dry down) caused by ink penetration into the<br>
medium at the time of offset printing is degraded, surface glossiness of<br>
the medium is reduced even when the cast coating has been performed in<br>
a production process, and powder down or cracking of the coating layer<br>
may occur at the time of cutting of a medium and folding paper in<br>
processing and book binding.<br>
In addition, amorphous silica used in the present invention<br>
preferably has an average particle diameter of 2 um to 7 um. When the<br>
average particle diameter of amorphous silica is 2 jam or less, ink<br>
absorption is degraded. When the average particle diameter of<br>
amorphous silica is 7 um. or more, glossiness is degraded.<br>
In addition, the amorphous silica used in the present invention<br>
preferably produces a 5%-by-mass dispersion having a pH of 6 or higher.<br>
When the pH of the 5%-by-mass dispersion is less than 6, in<br>
addition to exfoliation of the coating layer due to ink tacking (piling) at<br>
the time of offset printing, and abnormal increase in viscosity of the<br>
coating liquid at the time of preparing coating liquid may occur.<br>
The particle diameter of Kaolin used in the present invention is<br>
not particularly limited, and Kaolin of which 96%, 92%, or 82% of the<br>
particles have a particle diameter of 2 urn or less can be suitably used.<br>
For other pigments, white pigments may be used which can be<br>
used in conventional printing cast coating paper depending on the<br>
purpose. For other pigments, from the viewpoint of whiteness, cost, and<br>
 <br>
usability in offset printing, especially common coated paper pigment,<br>
such as light calcium carbonate, zinc oxide, clay, aluminum hydroxide,<br>
calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide, barium sulfate, satin white, and<br>
plastic pigment may be used for other pigment. These may be used<br>
alone or in combination. Examples of the plastic pigment include an<br>
aqueous dispersion of styrene-acrylate copolymer particles,<br>
styrene-butadiene copolymer particles, polystyrene particles, and<br>
polyethylene particles. Two or more types of these organic pigments<br>
may be mixed for use.<br>
The shapes of the organic pigments may be a compact solid type, a<br>
hollow type, or a doughnut type, however, are preferably particles having<br>
an average particle diameter of 0.2 um to 3.0 um, more preferably a<br>
hollow type having a void ratio of 40% or more, in view of the glossiness,<br>
surface covering ability, and balance of flow ability of the coating liquid.<br>
Furthermore, when pigments satisfy the above conditions, other<br>
inorganic pigments or other organic pigments can be used as required.<br>
Examples of the inorganic pigments include talc, calcium sulfite, titanium<br>
white, magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, aluminum hydroxide,<br>
calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, and chlorite.<br>
• Adhesive -<br>
The adhesive is one or more selected from common coating paper<br>
adhesives such as casein, soy proteins, synthetic proteins; conjugate diene<br>
polymer latex such as styrene-butadiene copolymers and methyl<br>
methacrylate-butadiene copolymers; acrylic polymer latex such as<br>
 <br>
polymers or copolymers of at least one of acrylic acid ester and<br>
methacrylic acid ester; vinyl copolymer latex such as ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate copolymers; or an alkali soluble or alkali insoluble polymer latex<br>
which is produced by modifying the above-mentioned various copolymer<br>
latex with a monomer containing a functional group such as a carboxyl<br>
group; synthetic resin adhesives such as polyvinyl alcohols, olefin/maleic<br>
anhydride resins, and melamine resins; starch such as oxidized starch,<br>
esterified starch, enzyme-modified starch, and cationized starch; cellulose<br>
derivatives such as carboxymethyl cellulose, and hydroxyethyl cellulose.<br>
These adhesives are mixed with a pigment in a mixing ratio of 10 parts<br>
by mass to 70 parts by mass of the adhesive to 100 parts by mass of the<br>
pigment.<br>
The adhesive must be an emulsion of an aqueous resin which has<br>
a strong binding ability to a pigment constituting the cast coating layer<br>
and to base paper, does not cause blocking, and further have an excellent<br>
matching ability to an ink used in a commercial printing paper. In<br>
particular, in order to prevent the piling or tinting which tends to cause<br>
printing problems, it is desirable to incorporate starch used in general<br>
printing paper, or styrene-butadiene (SBR) latex which is seldom used in<br>
inkjet paper in addition to modified starch. When the SBR latex, of<br>
which compatibility with a cationic agent as an inkjet ink fixing agent is<br>
poor, is incorporated into an inkjet medium, usually, the surface of the<br>
inkjet medium becomes hydrophobic, and wettability of the inkjet ink is<br>
degraded, therefore, the SBR latex is seldom used in inkjet paper,<br>
 <br>
however, is required so as to increase the usability of the medium in<br>
offset printing.<br>
The styrene-butadiene latex may be a copolymer latex which<br>
contains styrene and butadiene as monomers, may be copolymerized with<br>
other monomer as required, may be a modified copolymer produced by a<br>
chemical reaction, and may be generally used for paper coating.<br>
Examples of other monomer frequently used include vinyl monomers such<br>
as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, alkyl ester of acrylic acid or methacrylic<br>
acid, acrylonitrile, maleic acid, fumaric acid, and vinyl acetate. Further,<br>
the styrene-butadiene latex may contain a cross-linking agent such as<br>
methylolized melamine, methylolized urea, methylolized hydroxy<br>
propylene urea, and isocyanate, or may be a self-crosslinkable copolymer<br>
containing a unit such as N-methylol acrylamide. These may be used<br>
alone or in combination.<br>
The dried adhesion amount of the cast coating layer (coating<br>
layer) is preferably 6 g/m2 or more, and more preferably 10 g/m2 or more.<br>
When the dried adhesion amount of the cast coating layer is less than 6<br>
g/m2, the glossiness of the coating film is degraded, uneven glossiness<br>
according to the position in the cast coating film caused by unevenness of<br>
the base paper may occur. When the dried adhesion amount of the cast<br>
coating layer is more than 10 g/m2, almost stable glossiness may be<br>
obtained. The larger the dried adhesion amount is, the easier the<br>
glossiness of the cast coating layer and the texture of the surface can be<br>
increased. However, when the dried adhesion amount of the cast coating<br>
 <br>
layer is excessively large, speed of ink absorption into the base paper is<br>
reduced at the time of inkjet printing, and images may spread to some<br>
extent and the drying period may be extended. Accordingly, the dried<br>
adhesion amount of the cast coating layer is preferably 30 g/m2 or less.<br>
When the drying period of the cast coating layer (coating layer) is<br>
long in the production process of the medium, material costs may increase<br>
to lower the productivity of the medium.<br>
The basis weight of the recording medium of the present<br>
invention is preferably 50 g/m2 to 250 g/m2. When it is less than 50 g/m2,<br>
the stiffness is insufficient and conveying defects easily occur, for example,<br>
the conveying path can be clogged with the recording medium. When<br>
the basis weight of recording medium is more than 250 g/m2, the stiffness<br>
is too high and the recording medium is not bent in the curved portions of<br>
the conveying path, thereby causing conveying defects such as clogging of<br>
the conveying path with the recording medium.<br>
(Inkjet recording method)<br>
The inkjet recording method of the present invention is realized<br>
by using the medium of the present invention in combination with the ink.<br>
Although the effect of the invention may be obtained by using one of the<br>
ink and the medium, the highest effect may be obtained by using the ink<br>
in combination with the medium. That is, when the medium is used in<br>
combination with the inkjet ink of the present invention, high image<br>
density and images having no spread may be obtained.<br>
<ink><br>
 <br>
The ink of the present invention has been realized in view of the<br>
applicability to a glossy medium having small ink absorption, and is<br>
characterized by inclusion of a particulate color material, particular<br>
surfactants, aqueous organic solvent, and water. In the present<br>
invention, especially it is undesirable to use, instead of the particulate<br>
color material, aqueous dye which is used in a general aqueous inkjet ink,<br>
from the viewpoint of image density. The ink of the present invention is<br>
characterized by its smaller surface tension than that of a normal inkjet<br>
ink, its excellent wettability, and strong penetration ability into the<br>
medium exhibited by the carrier in the ink, because of the effect of the<br>
surfactant for use in the present invention. According to these<br>
characteristics, it is possible to form relatively stable dots, and avoid<br>
fusion of neighboring dots also on the coating paper which has smaller<br>
ink absorption than the normal inkjet medium because the coating paper<br>
has no ink absorbing layer.<br>
It is necessary to use the particulate color material, because the<br>
particulate color material will not penetrate so deeply into the medium<br>
with a carrier, which has high penetration ability, and will tend to<br>
remain on the surface. Accordingly, it becomes possible to obtain<br>
adequate coloring and image density with a small amount of ink. It is<br>
possible to achieve adequate drying ability and reduced printing cost by<br>
using as small amount of ink as possible when images are formed. In<br>
this case, it is also possible to print an image without causing problems<br>
such as curling and cockling of the media due to moisture in the ink.<br>
 <br>
Especially printing images with as small amount of the ink as<br>
possible may be very effective when the electrophotographic printing is<br>
desired after performing the inkjet printing. When a toner is fixed in an<br>
electrophotograhic method, a medium is usually nipped with a<br>
high-temperature fixing roller for a certain time period. In this situation,<br>
when the water content of the paper is high, a sufficiently high fixing<br>
temperature cannot be obtained, resulting in the formation of a blister of<br>
the coating layer caused by water vapor swollen in the paper.<br>
In addition, the high wettability of ink may effectively prevent<br>
marking of a fingerprint when the media surface is touched with a finger.<br>
When an ink has a high surface tension, because of the repellence of the<br>
ink, a marking of a fingerprint may be produced. However, when an ink<br>
has a low surface tension even in such a situation, a uniform print may be<br>
produced.<br>
Specifically, when the above-mentioned ink is used, the maximum<br>
ink adhesion amount (regulated total ink amount value) at the time of<br>
image formation may be 20 g/m2. The image formation with the ink<br>
adhesion amount of 20 g/m2 or less may produce very high quality images<br>
without causing beading or bleeding.<br>
The penetration amount of carrier may be easily controlled by<br>
controlling the amount of the surfactant which is represented by the<br>
structural formula (1).<br>
- Ink fixing agent -<br>
 <br>
Preferably the ink contains a water dispersible resin component<br>
which promotes fixation of a color material pigment. The resin<br>
component that promotes fixation of the color material pigment is a resin<br>
component that keeps binding ability at a certain level or more between<br>
the color material pigment and the medium surface or between the color<br>
material pigments. Without this resin component, the color material<br>
pigment becomes easily exfoliated after printing. The fixing components<br>
may be contained in an ink as a free component or as a component<br>
adsorbed or chemically bound onto a surface of color material particles.<br>
- Surface Tension of Ink -<br>
As a condition of the ink for the present invention, it has been<br>
found that the ink has very high penetration ability, and a surface tension<br>
of 30 mN/m or less. When the surface tension is more than 30 mN/m,<br>
the penetration of ink is delayed and an image exudation occurs, and it<br>
becomes difficult to obtain high quality images..<br>
The surface tension of the ink at 25°C is preferably 15 mN/m to 40<br>
mN/m, and more preferably 20 mN/m to 25 mN/m. When the surface<br>
tension is less than 15 mN/m, the nozzle plate of the head is excessively<br>
wetted and ink droplets cannot be properly formed, exudation on the<br>
recording medium of the present invention becomes significant and stable<br>
discharge of ink may not be attained. When the surface tension is more<br>
than 40 mN/m, the ink sometimes insufficiently penetrates the recording<br>
medium, thereby causing beading, and the extension of drying time.<br>
The surface tension of an ink is measured, for example, with a<br>
 <br>
surface tensiometer (CBVP-Z manufactured by Kyowa Interface Science<br>
Co., Ltd.) using a platinum plate at a temperature of 25°C.<br>
- Solid Content of Ink -<br>
The solid content of the ink of the present invention is preferably<br>
5% by mass or more. When the concentration is lower than 5% by mass,<br>
the increase in viscosity during drying is slow and the image tends to<br>
spread easily. The higher the solid content, the more preferred.<br>
However, if it is too high, nozzle clogging heavily occurs and loss of image<br>
easily occurs. Therefore, it is desirable that the solid content be 5% by<br>
mass to 15% by mass.<br>
■ Colorant ■<br>
Examples of cyan coloring material used in the present invention<br>
include C. I. Pigment Blue 1, 2, 3, 15 (Copper Phthalocyanine Blue R),<br>
15:1, 15:2, 15:3 (Phthalocyanine Blue G), 15:4, 15=6 (Phthalocyanine Blue<br>
E), 15:34, 16, 17:1, 22, 56, 60, 63, C. I. Vat Blue 4, and Vat Blue 60.<br>
From the standpoint of cost and safety, Phthalocyanine Blue 15:3 is<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
Coloring materials for other colors are not particularly limited, as<br>
long as they are coloring particles.<br>
As the colorant, a colorant selected from at least any one of a<br>
pigment, dye, and colored fine particle is preferably used.<br>
As the colored fine particles, an aqueous dispersion of fine<br>
polymer particles containing a coloring material selected from at least<br>
any one of a pigment and dye can be advantageously used.<br>
 <br>
The expression "containing ... coloring material" herein means<br>
either of a state in which the coloring material is encapsulated inside the<br>
fine polymer particles, and a state in which the coloring material is<br>
adsorbed on the surface of fine polymer particles, or both such states. In<br>
this case, it is not necessary that the all coloring materials contained in<br>
the ink of the present invention be encapsulated in or adsorbed on the<br>
fine polymer particles, and the coloring material may be also dispersed in<br>
the emulsion within a range in which the effect of the present invention is<br>
not lost. The coloring material is not particularly limited, as long as it is<br>
insoluble or has poor solubility in water and can be adsorbed on the<br>
polymer, and the coloring material may be appropriately selected<br>
according to the purpose.<br>
The expression "insoluble or has poor solubility in water" means<br>
that the coloring material is not dissolved in an amount of 10 parts by<br>
mass or more in 100 parts by mass of water at a temperature of 20°C.<br>
"Soluble" means that no separation or precipitation of the coloring<br>
material can be visually observed in the surface layer or lower layer of<br>
aqueous solution.<br>
The volume-average particle size of fine polymer particles (colored<br>
fine particles) containing the coloring material is preferably 0.01 µm to<br>
0.16 µm in the ink. When the particle size is less than 0.01 µm, the fine<br>
particles easily flow, thereby increasing the ink exudation and degrading<br>
light resistance. On the other hand, the particle size is more than 0.16<br>
µm, the nozzle is easily clogged and color development ability is<br>
 <br>
decreased.<br>
Examples of colorants include dyes such as water-soluble dyes,<br>
oil-soluble dyes and dispersed dyes, and pigments. Oil-soluble dyes and<br>
dispersed dyes are preferred from the standpoint of adsorption ability and<br>
sealing ability, but pigments can be advantageously used to ensure light<br>
resistance of the image to be obtained.<br>
From the standpoint of effective impregnation into the fine<br>
polymer particles, it is preferred that the dyes be dissolved to a<br>
concentration of 2 g/L or more, more preferably 20 g/L to 600 g/L, in an<br>
organic solvent such as a ketone solvent.<br>
The water-soluble dyes can be classified into acidic dyes, direct<br>
dyes, basic dyes, reactive dyes, and food dyes, based on the color index<br>
thereof, and it is preferred that dyes excelling in water resistance and<br>
light resistance be used.<br>
The amount of the colorant added to the ink is preferably 2% by<br>
mass to 15% by mass and more preferably 3% by mass to 12% by mass.<br>
When the amount of the colorant is less than 2% by mass, image density<br>
may be decreased due to lowered coloring strength, and feathering or<br>
exudation may be adversely affected due to lowered viscosity. When the<br>
amount of the colorant is more than 15% by mass, a nozzle easily dries up,<br>
for example, when the inkjet recording apparatus is allowed to stand,<br>
resulting in a no-discharge phenomenon. Furthermore, due to the<br>
excessively high viscosity, penetration ability is decreased and dots less<br>
spread. Therefore, image density may be decreased and rough image<br>
 <br>
may be obtained.<br>
• Penetrating agent ■<br>
As the penetrating agent, water-soluble organic solvents such as<br>
polyol compounds and glycol ether compounds are used. Particularly, at<br>
least any one of polyol compounds having 8 or more carbon atoms and<br>
glycol ether compounds is preferably used.<br>
When the number of carbon atoms in the polyol compound is less<br>
than 8, sufficient penetration ability cannot be obtained, recording<br>
medium is contaminated during printing on both sides, spread of ink on<br>
the recording medium is insufficient, and cover ratio of pixel is decreased.<br>
As a result, character quality or image density may be decreased.<br>
Examples of polyol compounds having 8 or more carbon atoms<br>
include 2-ethyl"l,3-hexanediol (solubility 4.2% at 25°C) and<br>
2,2,4-trimethyl-l,3-pentanediol (solubility 2.0% at 25°C).<br>
The glycol ether compounds are not particularly limited and may<br>
be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof<br>
include polyhydric alcohol alkyl ethers such as ethylene glycol monoethyl<br>
ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl<br>
ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl<br>
ether, tetraethylene glycol monomethyl ether, and propylene glycol<br>
monoethyl ether! and polyhydric alcohol aryl ethers such as ethylene<br>
glycol monophenyl ether and ethylene glycol monobenzyl ether.<br>
The amount of the penetrating agent added to the ink is not<br>
particularly limited and may be appropriately selected according to the<br>
 <br>
purpose. It is preferably 0.1% by mass to 20% by mass, and more<br>
preferably 0.5% by % by mass to 10% by mass.<br>
The amount of the aqueous organic solvent added to the ink is<br>
preferably 0.1 % by mass to 20 % by mass, and more preferably 0.5% by<br>
mass to 10% by mass.<br>
- Wetting Agent -<br>
It is necessary to use an aqueous organic solvent in addition to<br>
the coloring materials so as to make physical properties of a recoding<br>
liquid of the present invention a desired state or to prevent nozzle<br>
clogging due to drying on the recording head. The aqueous organic<br>
solvent includes wetting agent, and penetrating agent. The wetting<br>
agent is added so as to prevent nozzle clogging of the recording head due<br>
to drying.<br>
The wetting agent is not particularly limited and may be<br>
appropriately selected according to the purpose. For example, at least<br>
one selected from polyol compounds, lactam compounds, urea compounds,<br>
and saccharides is advantageously used.<br>
Examples of polyol compounds include polyhydric alcohols,<br>
polyhydric alcohol alkyl ethers, polyhydric alcohol aryl ethers,<br>

glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol<br>
monobutyl ether, tetraethylene glycol monomethyl ether, and propylene<br>
glycol monoethyl ether.<br>
Examples of polyhydric alcohol aryl ethers include ethylene glycol<br>
monophenyl ether and ethylene glycol monobenzyl ether.<br>
Examples of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds include<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-hydroxyethyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone,<br>
1,3-dimethylimidazolidinone, and s-caprolactam.<br>
Examples of amides include formamide, N-methylformamide,<br>
formamide, N,N-dimethyl formamide.<br>
Examples of amines include monoethanolamine, diethanolamine,<br>
triethanolamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine, and triethylamine.<br>
Examples of sulfur compounds include dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolan,<br>

1,2,6-hexanetriol, tbiodiglycol, 2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, or<br>

As the lactam compound, at least one selected from 2-pyrrolidone,<br>

s-caprolactam may be used.<br>
As the urea compound, at least one selected from urea, thiourea,<br>
ethyleneurea, and l,3-dimethyl-2"imidazolidinone may be used. The<br>
amount of the urea compound added to the ink is generally preferably<br>
0.5% by mass to 50% by mass and more preferably 1% by mass to 20% by<br>
mass.<br>
Examples of saccharides include monosaccharides, disaccharides,<br>
oligosaccharides (including trisaccharides and tetrasaccharides),<br>
polysaccharides, and derivatives thereof. Of these, glucose, mannose,<br>
fructose, ribose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, maltose, cellobiose, lactose,<br>
sucrose, trehalose, and maltotriose are preferred; maltitose, sorbitose,<br>
gluconolactone, and maltose are particularly preferred.<br>
The polysaccharides mean sugars in a broad sense and may<br>
include substances widely present in nature, such as cc-cyclodextrin and<br>
cellulose.<br>
Examples of the derivatives of the saccharides include reduced<br>
sugar of the saccharides (for example, sugar alcohol, represented by a<br>
 <br>
general formula HOCH2(CHOH)nCH20H (where n represents an integer<br>
of 2 to 5)), oxidized sugar (for example, aldonic acid and uronic acid),<br>
amino acids, and thio acid. Of these, sugar alcohol is preferred.<br>
Examples of sugar alcohols include maltitol and sorbitol.<br>
The amount of the wetting agent contained in the ink is 10% by<br>
mass to 50% by mass and more preferably 20% by mass to 35% by mass.<br>
When the amount of the contained wetting agent is too small, a nozzle<br>
may be easily dried, causing abnormal discharge of ink droplets. When<br>
the amount of the contained wetting agent is too large, viscosity of ink<br>
increases, exceeding the appropriate viscosity range.<br>
■ Surfactant -<br>
According to the present invention, wetting ability and<br>
penetration ability of the ink to recording paper may be improved by<br>
using a surfactant, especially a fluorine surfactant having a particular<br>
structure. A fluorine surfactant is generally known to have a high<br>
foaming ability when used in an ink, and an adverse effect on ink filling<br>
and ink ejection stability. Meanwhile, the fluorine surfactant having a<br>
particular structure used in the present invention has a low foaming<br>
ability, is excellent in ink filling, ink ejection stability, and safety, and, on<br>
the inkjet recording medium of the present invention, has a high color<br>
developing ability and an excellent homogeneity of colorant, and produces<br>
very low beading and excellent images. Although it is not fully<br>
understood, because of its structure, the fluorine surfactant having a<br>
particular structure used in the present invention is excellent in leveling<br>
 <br>
ability, has a strong homogenizing effect on surface tension at the<br>
air liquid interface, is excellent in anti foaming ability, and, on the inkjet<br>
recording medium, has effects of uniformly dispersing the colorant and<br>
spreading wet dots to produce uniform pixels owing to this leveling ability,<br>
and possibly produces very weak beading, resulting, when the fluorine<br>
surfactant is used in combination with the inkjet recording medium and<br>
the inkjet recording pigment ink of the present invention, in production of<br>
an ideal inkjet recording ink which is cheap, is excellent in image quality,<br>
density, glossiness, and image reliability, is capable of providing print<br>
which achieves similar quality to the commercial print, and is excellent in<br>
an ejection stability, and storage stability; an inkjet recording ink set,; an<br>
inkjet recording ink medium set; and an inkjet recording apparatus.<br>
In addition to the fluorine surfactant which is represented by the<br>
above structural formula (l) and used in the present invention, the<br>
following fluorine activation agent may be used: perfluoroalkyl sulfonic<br>
acid salt, perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid salt, perfluoroalkyl phosphate<br>
ester, perfluoroalkyl ethylene oxide adduct, perfluoroalkyl betaine,<br>
perfluoroalkylamineoxide compound; examples of their commercially<br>
available products are SURFLON S-lll, S-112, S-113, S121, S131, S132,<br>
S-141, and S-145 (manufactured by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd); FLUORAD<br>
FC-93, FC-95, FC-98, FC-129, FC-135, FC-170C, FO430, FC-431, and<br>
FC-4430 (manufactured by Sumitomo 3M Limited); MEGAFACE F-470,<br>
F-1405, and F474 (manufactured by DIC Corporation); ZONYL FS-300,<br>
FSN, FSN-100, and FSO (manufactured by DuPont); FTOP EF-351, 352,<br>
 <br>
801, and 802 (manufactured by NEOS Company Limited). These are<br>
easily obtainable and used in the present invention. Among these,<br>
ZONYL FS-300, FSN, FSN-100, and FSO (manufactured by DuPont),<br>
which are excellent in especially reliability and color developing ability,<br>
may be suitably used.<br>
Furthermore the surfactant which can be used in combination<br>
with the above fluorine compound includes, for example, interface<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetic acid salt, dialkyl sulfosuccinic acid<br>
ester, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ether,<br>
polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer, polyoxyethylenealkyl<br>
ester, polyoxyethylenesorbitan fatty acid ester, and acetylene glycol<br>
surfactant. More specifically, when at least one of polyoxyethylene alkyl<br>
ether acetic acid salt and dialkylsulfosuccinic acid with an alkyl chain<br>
having 5 to 7 carbon atoms is used for the anionic surfactant, wetting<br>
ability with regular paper becomes excellent. Note that the surfactant<br>
mentioned above can exist in the ink of the present invention stably<br>
without disturbing a dispersed state of the ink.<br>
A polyol having 7 to 11 carbon atoms which is used for a<br>
penetrating agent in the present invention includes, for example,<br>
2-ethyM,3 hexanediol and 2,2,4"trimethyM,3,-pentanediol. The amount<br>
of polyol added is preferably 0.1% by mass to 20% by mass, and more<br>
preferably 0.5% by mass to 10% by mass. When the amount of polyol<br>
added is less than 0.1% by mass, penetration ability of the ink into paper<br>
may become poor, the ink may produce contamination due to friction<br>
<br>
 <br>
caused by a roller at the time of conveyance, or contamination of a<br>
conveying belt with the ink at the time of flip of a paper sheet for printing<br>
and thus may not be used in high-speed printing and printing on both<br>
sides. When the amount of polyol added is more than 20% by mass or<br>
more, image sharpness may be degraded because the diameter of a<br>
printing dot may become large and the width of lines of a character may<br>
become wide.<br>
■	Pigment fixing agent -<br>
Any rein emulsion may be used for a pigment fixing agent.<br>
■	Resin Emulsion ■<br>
In the resin emulsion, fine resin particles are dispersed in water<br>
as a continuous phase. The resin emulsion may include a dispersant<br>
such as a surfactant, as necessary.<br>
As the dispersed phase, the amount of fine resin particles<br>
(amount of fine resin particles in the resin emulsion) is generally<br>
preferably 10% by mass to 70% by mass. Moreover, with consideration<br>
for the use in an inkjet recording apparatus, the fine resin particles have<br>
an average particle diameter of preferably 10 nm to 1,000 nm and more<br>
preferably 20 nm to 300 nm.<br>
The fine resin particle component of the dispersed phase is not<br>
particularly limited and may be appropriately selected according to the<br>
purpose. Examples thereof include an acrylic resin, vinyl acetate resin,<br>
styrene resin, butadiene resin, styrene-butadiene resin, vinyl chloride<br>
resin, acryl-styrene resin, and aery 1-silicone resin. Of these,<br>
<br>
 <br>
aery 1-silicone resin is particularly preferred.<br>
As the resin emulsion, appropriately synthesized resin emulsions<br>
or commercially available products may be used.<br>
Examples of commercially available products include Microgel<br>
E-1002 and E-5002 (styrene-acrylic resin emulsions manufactured by<br>
Nippon Paint Co., Ltd.), Boncoat 4001 (acrylic resin emulsion<br>
manufactured by DIC Corporation), Boncoat 5454 (styrene-acrylic resin<br>
emulsion manufactured by DIC Corporation), SAE-1014 (styrene-acrylic<br>
resin emulsion manufactured by Zeon Corporation), Saivinol SK-200<br>
(acrylic resin emulsion manufactured by Saiden Chemical Industry Co.,<br>
Ltd.), Primal AC-22 and AC-61 (acrylic resin emulsions manufactured by<br>
Rohm and Haas Co., Ltd.), Nanocryl SBCX 2821 and 3689 (acrylic<br>
silicone resin emulsions manufactured by Tbyo Ink Mfg. Co. Ltd.), and<br>
#3070 (methyl methacrylate copolymer resin emulsion manufactured by<br>
Mikuni Color Ltd.).<br>
It is preferred that the amount of fine resin particles of the resin<br>
emulsion that is added to the ink be 0.1% by mass to 50% by mass, more<br>
preferably 0.5% by mass to 20% by mass, and still more preferably 1% by<br>
mass to 10% by mass. When the amount of fine resin particles is less<br>
than 0.1% by mass, a sufficient effect cannot be obtained in preventing<br>
clogging and improving discharge stability, and when the amount is more<br>
than 50% by mass, it may decrease the storage stability of the ink.<br>
- Other Components -<br>
Other components are not particularly limited and may be<br>
<br>
 <br>
appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof<br>
include pH adjusting agents, antiseptic/antifungal agents, antirust agents,<br>

[Preparation of Ink]<br>
The ink of the present invention contains at least water, a<br>
colorant, a water soluble organic solvent, a wetting agent and a<br>
surfactant, and further contains other components, as necessary. These<br>
components are dispersed or dissolved in an aqueous solvent, and further<br>
stirred and mixed as necessary, so as to produce the ink of the present<br>
invention. The dispersing may be performed with a sand mill, a<br>
 <br>
homogenizer, a ball mill, a paint shaker, or an ultrasonic dispersing<br>
machine, and the stirring and mixing may be performed by using a<br>
stirring machine using a typical blade, a magnetic stirrer, or a high-speed<br>
dispersing machine.<br>
Physical properties of the ink such as viscosity, surface tension,<br>
and pH are preferably within the following ranges.<br>
Viscosity of the ink at a temperature of 25°C is preferably 1 cps to<br>

- Printer -<br>
The ink of the present invention in the ink media set can be<br>
advantageously used in printers using the following inkjet heads: a<br>
so-called piezo-type inkjet head in which a piezoelectric element is used<br>
as a pressure generating unit that pressurizes ink located in an ink<br>
channel to deform an oscillation plate forming a wall surface of the ink<br>
channel, and the internal volume of the ink channel is changed thereby<br>
discharging an ink droplet (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
 <br>
(JP-A) No. 02-51734), a so-called thermal-type inkjet head that uses a<br>
heat-generating resistor to heat the ink in an ink channel and generate<br>
gas bubbles (see JP-ANo. 61-59911), and an electrostatic inkjet head in<br>
which an oscillation plate forming a wall surface of an ink channel is<br>
disposed opposite an electrode and the oscillation plate is deformed by<br>
electrostatic forces generated between the oscillation plate and the<br>
electrode so as to change the internal volume of the ink channel, thereby<br>
discharging an ink droplet (see JP-ANo. 06-71882).<br>
(Image forming method and Image forming apparatus)<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention contains<br>
at least an inkjetting unit, and further includes other units suitably<br>
selected as necessary, such as a stimulus generating unit and a<br>
controlling unit.<br>
The image forming method of the present invention includes at<br>
least an inkjetting step, and further includes other steps suitably selected<br>
as necessary, such as a stimulus generating step and a controlling step.<br>
The inkjet recording method of the present invention can be<br>
suitably performed by the inkjet recording apparatus of the present<br>
invention, and the inkjetting step can be suitably performed by the<br>
inkjetting unit. Also, other steps can be suitably performed by other<br>
units.<br>
- Inkjetting Step and Inkjetting Unit -<br>
The inkjetting step is a step of jetting the ink of the present<br>
invention in the ink media set by applying a stimulus to the ink so as to<br>
 <br>
record an image on a recording medium.<br>
The inkjetting unit is a unit configured to jet the ink in the ink<br>
media set by applying a stimulus to the ink so as to record an image on a<br>
recording medium in the ink media set. The inkjetting unit is not<br>
particularly limited, and examples thereof include various nozzles for<br>
discharging the ink.<br>
The stimulus can be generated, for example, by the stimulus<br>
generating unit, and the stimulus is not particularly limited and may be<br>
suitably selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include<br>
heat, pressure, vibration and light. These may be used alone or in<br>
combination. Of these, heat and pressure are preferable.<br>
Examples of the stimulus generating units include heaters,<br>
pressurizers, piezoelectric elements, vibration generators, ultrasonic<br>
oscillators and lights. Specific examples thereof include a piezoelectric<br>
actuator such as a piezoelectric element, a thermal actuator that utilizes<br>
phase transition caused by film boiling of a liquid by using a<br>
thermoelectric conversion element such as an exothermic resistive<br>
element, a shape-memory-alloy actuator that utilizes, metal phase<br>
transition caused by temperature variations, and an electrostatic<br>
actuator using electrostatic force.<br>
The aspect of the jetting of the inkjet ink in the ink media set is<br>
not particularly limited and varies according to the kinds of the stimulus<br>
or the like. In the case where the stimulus is "heat", there is, for<br>
example, a method in which thermal energy corresponding to a recording<br>
 <br>
signal is applied to the inkjet ink in a recording head, using a thermal<br>
head or the like, bubbles are generated in the ink by the thermal energy,<br>
and the ink is discharged as droplets from nozzle holes of the recording<br>
head by the pressure of the bubbles. Meanwhile, in the case where the<br>
stimulus is "pressure", there is, for example, a method in which by<br>
applying voltage to a piezoelectric element bonded to a site called a<br>
pressure chamber that lies in an ink channel in a recording head, the<br>
piezoelectric element bends, the volume of the pressure chamber<br>
decreases, and thus the inkjet ink is discharged as droplets from nozzle<br>
holes of the recording head.<br>
It is desirable that the ink droplets jetted be, for example, 1 pL to<br>
40 pL in size, 5 m/s to 20 m/s in discharge velocity, 1 kHz or greater in<br>
drive frequency and 300 dpi or greater in resolution.<br>
The controlling unit is not particularly limited and may be<br>
suitably selected according to the purpose, as long as it can control<br>
operations of the aforementioned units. Examples thereof include<br>
apparatuses such as a sequencer and a computer.<br>
In this instance, an explanation is made by referring to an<br>
example applied to a serial type (shuttle-type) inkjet recording apparatus<br>
at which the carriage scans. The inkjet recording apparatus is also<br>
applicable to a line-type inkjet recording apparatus equipped with a<br>
line-type head.<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus and the inkjet recording method of<br>
the present invention are applicable to various types of recording by an<br>
 <br>
inkjet recording method, and in particular advantageously applicable, for<br>
example, to printers, facsimile devices, copiers, and printer/fax/copier<br>
multipurpose machines for inkjet recording.<br>
(Ink Record)<br>
An ink record is recorded by means of the inkjet recording method<br>
of the present invention. The ink record has an image formed on a<br>
recording medium of the ink media set using the ink of the ink media set,<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
The ink records have a high image quality with less ink exudation<br>
and excel in stability over time, and thus the ink records may be suitably<br>
used for various purposes as documents on which various printing and/or<br>
images are recorded.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, examples of the present invention will be described,<br>
however, the examples should not be construed as limiting the present<br>
invention.<br>
<preparation of pigment ink><br>
(Production Example 1: Dispersion containing cyan pigment)<br>
■Preparation of fine polymer particle dispersion containing copper<br>
phthalocyanine pigment-<br>
An inside of a 1-L flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a<br>
thermometer, a nitrogen gas introducing tube, a reflux tube and a drop<br>
funnel was sufficiently replaced with nitrogen gas, then 11.2 g of styrene,<br>
 <br>
2.8 g of acrylic acid, 12.0 g of lauryl methacrylate, 4.0 g of polyethylene<br>
glycol methacrylate, 4.0 g of styrene macromer (product name: AS-6<br>
manufactured by TOAGOSEI CO., LTD.) and 0.4 g of mercaptoethanol<br>
were loaded therein, and the temperature was raised to 65°C.<br>
Subsequently, a mixed solution of 100.8 g of styrene, 25.2 g of acrylic acid,<br>
108.0 g of lauryl methacrylate, 36.0 g of polyethylene glycol methacrylate,<br>
60.0 g of hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 36.0 g of styrene macromer (product<br>
name: AS-6 manufactured by TOAGOSEI CO., LTD.), 3.6 g of<br>
mercaptoethanol, 2.4 g of azobis dismethylvaleronitrile arid 18 g of<br>
methyl ethyl ketone was dripped for 2.5 hours in the flask.<br>
After dripping, a mixed solution of 0.8 g of azobis<br>
dimethylvaleronitrile and 18 g of methyl ethyl ketone was dripped for 0.5<br>
hours in the flask. After maturing at 65°C for one hour, 0.8 g of azobis<br>
dimethylvaleronitrile was added, and the mixture was further matured<br>
for one hour. After the termination of the reaction, 364 g of methyl ethyl<br>
ketone was added in the flask to prepare 800 g of a polymer solution<br>
having a concentration of 50% by mass. A part of the polymer solution<br>
was then dried and measured by gel permeation chromatography<br>
(standard: polystyrene, solvent: tetrahydrofuran). The mass-average<br>
molecular mass was 15,000.<br>
Then, 28 g of the obtained polymer solution, 26 g of copper<br>
phthalocyanine pigment, 13.6 g of an aqueous solution of potassium<br>
hydroxide with a concentration of 1 mol/L, 20 g of methyl ethyl ketone,<br>
and 30 g of ion-exchanged water were thoroughly stirred. A total of 20<br>
 <br>
cycles of kneading were then performed using a three-roll mill (product<br>
name: NR-84A, manufactured by Noritake Company). The obtained<br>
paste was added to 200 g of ion-exchanged water, and the mixture was<br>
sufficiently stirred. Thereafter, the mixture was treated with an<br>
evaporator so as to evaporate methyl ethyl ketone and water, to thereby<br>
obtain 160g of a blue colored fine polymer particle dispersion having solid<br>
content of 20.0 % by mass.<br>
The average particle diameter (D50%) of the obtained fine<br>
polymer particles which was measured by a particle size distribution<br>

The average particle diameter (D50%) of the obtained fine<br>
polymer particles which was measured by a particle size distribution<br>
measurement device (Microtrack UPA, manufactured by Nikkiso Co. Ltd.)<br>
was 76 nm.<br>
(Production Example 4- Dispersion Containing Black Pigment)<br>
-Preparation of carbon black dispersion-<br>
In 1,000 mL of water, 300 g of commercial acidic carbon black<br>
having pH 2.5 (product name: Monarch 1300, manufactured by Cabot<br>
Corporation) was mixed thoroughly. Then, 450 g of sodium hypochlorite<br>
(effective chlorine concentration: 12%) was added dropwise and stirred for<br>
8 hours at 100°C to 105°C. In this liquid, 100 g of sodium hypochlorite<br>
(effective chlorine concentration: 12%) was then added, and dispersed for<br>
3 hours in a horizontal disperser. The obtained slurry was diluted<br>
tenfold with water, and then pH was adjusted with lithium hydroxide,<br>
and the slurry was desalted and concentrated with an ultrafiltration<br>
membrane to an electric conductivity of 0.2 mS/cm to obtain a carbon<br>
black dispersion liquid having a pigment concentration of 15%.<br>
Subsequently, coarse particles were removed by centrifuging, and<br>
filtrated through a 1 urn Nylon filter to obtain a carbon black dispersion<br>
 <br>
liquid.<br>
The average particle diameter (D50%) of the obtained fine<br>
polymer particles which was measured by a particle size distribution<br>
meter (Microtrack UPA, manufactured by Nikkiso Co.) was 95 nm.<br>
Next, ink compositions were prepared by using the fine polymer<br>
particle dispersions obtained by Production Examples 1 to 4 and carbon<br>

■ Cast coating ■<br>
On one side of the above mentioned base paper, cast coating layer<br>
was deposited with cast coater by a rewet method.<br>
The coating method was applied as follows.<br>
The base paper was coated with a cast coating material using an<br>
air knife such that the dry amount of the coating material becomes 18<br>
g/m2. The coated paper was dried by a drier, coated with a rewetting<br>
liquid using a dip roll coater, placed on a cast drum having a surface<br>
temperature in a moistened state of 100° C, and then pressed under a<br>
forming roll, dried, and finally separated from the cast drum using a<br>
return roll after drying to prepare a cast coating paper 1. This process<br>
was performed at a speed of 40 m/min.<br>
Ink set 1 having four colors, that is, black, yellow, magenta, and<br>
cyan was prepared using ink compositions produced in Production<br>
Examples 1 to 8, and images were printed using thus obtained ink set 1<br>
 <br>
and the cast coating paper 1 by means of an inkjet printer (Drop On<br>
Demand Printer having a nozzle resolution of 300 dpi, 384 nozzles per<br>
row, and total 8 rows; GX5000, manufactured by Ricoh Company, Ltd)<br>
with an image resolution of 1,200 dpi (4 pass 1/2 interless), a large<br>
droplet size of 20 pL, a medium droplet size of 10 pL, and a small droplet<br>
size of 2 pL. In this printing operation, adhesion amount was controlled<br>
with a total volume control of secondary color being set at 140%; in the<br>
case of solid image formation, solid images and letters were printed such<br>
that a total ink amount in a 300-dot-square was less than 15 g/m2. A<br>
printing image pattern for this evaluation was constructed using<br>
Word2000 (9.0.6926 SP-3) (manufactured by Microsoft Corporation).<br>
An image for evaluating image densities was constructed using a<br>
graphic drawing tool of Word2000, and was neighboring seven 5-cm<br>
squares (one color for each of seven squares) with colors of lines and solid<br>
images being set as respective colors of YMCKRGB via user setting of<br>
Word2000.<br>
Color conditions for solid images and lines are:<br>
YeUow (Red 0, Green 255, and Blue 255)<br>
Cyan (Red 255, Green 255, and Blue 0)<br>
Magenta (Red 255, Green 0, and Blue 255)<br>
Red (Red 255, Green 0, and Blue 0)<br>
Green (Red 0, Green 255, and Blue 0)<br>
Blue (Red 0, Green 0, and Blue 255)<br>
Black (Red 0, Green 0, and Blue 0)<br>
 <br>
<image density><br>
An image patch for evaluating image density in each color of<br>
YMCK was measured ten times with a reflective type color<br>
spectrophotometric densitometer (manufactured by X-Rite, Incorporated),<br>
and the average often measurements was taken as the image density.<br>
Images having optical densities of less than 1.1 for Y, of less than 1.5 for<br>
M, of less than 1.5 for C, and of less than 1.2 for K were evaluated as B.<br>
<ink absorption><br>
Minute unevenness (beading) of image density, which is caused by<br>
poor ink absorption, in a chart for measuring image density was visually<br>
observed for evaluating ink absorbing ability. Based on a specimen copy<br>
indicating minimum allowable density unevenness of images, images<br>
having obviously poorer evenness than images of the specimen copy were<br>
considered as poor (C).<br>
<glossiness><br>
Glossiness at 60° of the background was measured with<br>
MICRO-GLOSS GLOSSMETER (BYK-GARDENER).<br>
<performance in electrophotography><br>
The image density charts printed by the above-mentioned IJ<br>
method was left at a temperature of 23°C and a relative humidity of 50%<br>
for 12 hr, and the same image as those in the image density charts was<br>
printed on blank space of the chart using an electrophotographic copier<br>
(IMAGIO MP C5000, manufactured by Ricoh Company, Ltd.).<br>
Failure in paper feeding, occurrence of a blister in the blank space<br>
 <br>
or image space, or occurrence of minute fusion onto a fixing roller was<br>
visually observed. Printing completed normally was evaluated as A, and<br>
printing in which some abnormality was seen was evaluated as C.<br>
<performance in printing><br>
By using a RI (Rotay Ink) printability tester (manufactured by<br>
IHI Machinery and Furnace Co., Ltd.), a solid image was formed with 0.8<br>
cc of a cyan ink, HIGH UNITY NEO SOY (manufactured by TOYO INK<br>
MFG. CO., LTD.) on a coated paper. Images produced with some failures<br>
in an ink transfer were evaluated as C. In addition, thus produced<br>
images were left in an atmosphere of 23°C and a relative humidity of 50%<br>
for 12 hr, and then images were evaluated for the fixability by putting the<br>
finger on a 5-cm square in the printed part. Images with no or less ink<br>
having been transferred to the finger were evaluated as A, and images<br>
with more ink having been transferred to the finger were evaluated as C.<br>
<strength of print><br>
By using a RI (Rotay Ink) printability tester (manufactured by<br>
IHI Machinery and Furnace Co., Ltd.), a solid image was formed with 0.8<br>
cc of a cyan ink, HIGH UNITY NEO SOY (manufactured by TOYO INK<br>
MFG. CO., LTD.) on a coated paper. An image having a coated layer a<br>
part of which was exfoliated was evaluated as C.<br>
<thickening of coating liquid><br>
Cast coating liquids that have significantly thickened after<br>
preparation thereof were evaluated as B.<br>
