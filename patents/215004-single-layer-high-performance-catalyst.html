Description<br>
The invention relates to a single layer high performance three-way catalyst (TWC)<br>
containing on an inert carrier body a catalytic coating comprising platinum, rhodium<br>
and various oxide materials.<br>
Three-way catalysts are used to convert the pollutants carbon monoxide (CO), hydro-<br>
carbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) contained in the exhaust gas of internal com-<br>
bustion engines into harmless substances. Known three-way catalysts with good activity<br>
and durability utilise one or more catalytic components from the platinum group metals<br>
such as platinum, palladium, rhodium deposited on a high surface area, refractory oxide<br>
support, e.g., a high surface area alumina. The support is usually carried in the form of a<br>
thin layer or coating on a suitable carrier or substrate such as a monolithic carrier com-<br>
prising a refractory ceramic or metal honeycomb structure.<br>
The ever increasing demand for improved catalyst activity and life has led to complex<br>
catalyst designs comprising multiple catalyst layers on carrier structures, each of the<br>
layers containing selected support materials and catalytic components as well as so<br>
called promoters, stabilisers and oxygen storage compounds.<br>
For applying the different layers onto the carrier structures so-called coating disper-<br>
sions, coating compositions or washcoat compositions are prepared which comprise the<br>
support materials in finely divided form and optionally additional soluble components.<br>
The. liquid phase of the coating composition is preferably water. This coating composi-<br>
tion is used to apply the catalytic coating onto the carrier structures. The techniques for<br>
applying the coating are well known to the expert. The fresh coating is then dried and<br>
calcined to fix the coating and to transform the optional soluble components of the<br>
coating composition into their final insoluble form.<br>
For the production of double or multiple layer catalysts a dedicated coating composition<br>
for each layer has to be provided. This increases the production costs. Therefore, it is<br>
one object of the present invention to design a single layer catalyst which approximates<br>
the catalytic properties of sophisticated multiple layer catalysts.<br>
Modern three-way catalysts make use of the platinum group metals platinum, palladium<br>
and rhodium. Platinum and palladium mainly promote the oxidation of hydrocarbons<br>
(HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) and may be present in the catalyst simultaneously or<br>
alternatively. Rhodium primarily promotes the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx).<br>
While platinum and palladium may replace each other to a certain extent, this is not the<br>
case for rhodium. The exhaust gas cleaning efficiencies promulgated by the most recent<br>
legal exhaust gas standards can only be met at reasonable cost by using rhodium to-<br>
gether with one or both of platinum and palladium.<br>
On the other hand it was observed that rhodium containing three-way catalysts suffer<br>
under the so-called fuel-cut ageing. The termfuel-cut ageing describes catalyst per-<br>
formance degradation due to fuel-cut after high load operation of the internal combus-<br>
tion engine. Such a situation occurs frequently during fast driving phases when abrupt<br>
deceleration is required. During fast driving phases the engine is operated at air/fuel<br>
ratios slightly below the stoichiometric value. The exhaust gases may reach tempera-<br>
tures well above 900°C resulting in even higher catalyst temperatures due to the exo-<br>
thermic conversion reactions at the catalyst. In case of abrupt deceleration modern mo-<br>
tor electronics completely stop fuel supply to the engine with the result that the normal-<br>
ised air/fuel ratio (also called lambda value X) of the exhaust gas jumps from fat to lean<br>
values.<br>
These large excursions of the normalised air/fuel ratio from fat to lean values at high<br>
catalyst temperatures degrade catalytic activity. Catalytic activity can at least partly be<br>
recovered by prolonged operation under stoichiometric or rich exhaust gas conditions.<br>
The faster catalytic activity is regained after fuel-cut ageing the better is the overall<br>
catalyst performance. Speeding up recovery of catalytic activity after fuel-cut ageing is<br>
therefore mandatory for modern three-way catalysts.<br>
Therefore, it is another object of the present invention to provide a catalyst with higher<br>
resistance towards fuel-cut ageing. That is, after high temperature ageing under lean<br>
exhaust gas conditions, the catalyst should recover its full three-way efficiency quickly.<br>
Reduced fuel-cut ageing will also improve the overall dynamic behaviour of the cata-<br>
lyst.<br>
US 4,965,243 discloses a single layer three-way catalyst comprising on activated alu-<br>
mina platinum and rhodium in a weight ratio of 5:1 and further cerium oxide, barium<br>
oxide and zirconium oxide combination of components is said to be very effective<br>
for maintaining an excellent catalyst activity even after the catalyst has been exposed to<br>
high temperatures of 900 to 1100°C.<br>
Patent US 5,200,384 describes a single layer three-way catalyst comprising on activated<br>
alumina platinum and rhodium in a weight ratio of 5:1 and further cerium oxide an a<br>
coprecipitated ceria-stabilized zirconia having a weight ratio of ceria to zirconia be-<br>
tween 1:99 and 25:75. The addition of the coprecipitated ceria-stabilized zirconia to the<br>
three-way catalyst is said to enhance the activity of the catalyst at low temperature after<br>
high temperature ageing.<br>
US 5,254,519 discloses a single layer catalyst comprising a combination of a coformed<br>
rare earth oxide-zirconia having a rhodium component dispersed thereon and a first ac-<br>
tivated alumina having a platinum component dispersed thereon. The catalyst may<br>
comprise a second rhodium component dispersed on the first alumina support. Alterna-<br>
tively, the second rhodium component may be dispersed on a second alumina compo-<br>
nent.<br>
During the last years there could be observed a tendency of replacing platinum in three-<br>
way catalysts completely with palladium because of its lower price and good oxidation<br>
activity. Palladium/rhodium and platinum/palladium/rhodium three-way catalysts had<br>
been developed which exhibited excellent catalytic activities at high palladium loads.<br>
Meanwhile the high demand for palladium has created a world-wide palladium shortage<br>
associated with a large increase of palladium prices. Nowadays palladium is more ex-<br>
pensive than platinum. Therefore it is still another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a catalyst using platinum and rhodium with less precious metal costs but<br>
equivalent catalytic activity compared to palladium and rhodium containing catalysts.<br>
These and further objects of the invention are achieved with a single layer high per-<br>
formance catalyst containing on an inert carrier body a catalytic coating comprising<br>
platinum, rhodium and various oxide materials.<br>
The catalyst is characterised in that the catalytic coating comprises<br>
a) at least one first support material selected from the group comprising a first active<br>
alumina, ceria rich ceria/zirconia mixed oxide and a zirconia component, said at<br>
least one first support material being catalysed with a first part of the total platinum<br>
amount of the catalyst, and<br>
b) a second support material catalysed with the second part of the total platinum<br>
amount and with rhodium said second support material being a second active alu-<br>
mina.<br>
The term "a material is catalysed with" means that said material holds on its surface<br>
catalytically active components in highly dispersed form, such as platinum, rhodium or<br>
palladium.<br>
The present invention is based on a co-pending European patent application of the in-<br>
ventors with publication number EP 1 046 423 A2. This application discloses a double<br>
layer catalyst with an inner and an outer layer on an inert carrier body comprising noble<br>
metals from the platinum group deposited on support materials. In the inner layer plati-<br>
num is deposited on a first support and on a first oxygen storage component and in the<br>
outer layer platinum and rhodium are deposited on a second support and the second<br>
layer further comprises a second oxygen storage component.<br>
The catalyst of the co-pending European patent application exhibits excellent catalytic<br>
properties compared to state of the art palladium and rhodium containing three-way<br>
catalysts. The present invention tries to reach similar catalytic properties with a single<br>
layer catalyst design to cut down production costs.<br>
With the catalyst of the present invention, reduced fuel-cut ageing and improved dy-<br>
namic behaviour and catalytic activities are obtained by placement of platinum and rho-<br>
dium on dedicated support materials. The superior catalytic activity of the catalyst al-<br>
lows to reduce the precious metal loading while still maintaining catalytic activity com-<br>
parable to state of the art three-way palladium/rhodium catalysts. This leads to reduced<br>
precious metal costs compared to conventional catalysts.<br>
It is an essential feature of the present invention that all of the rhodium present in the<br>
catalyst is closely associated with platinum. This is accomplished by depositing the sec-<br>
ond part of the total platinum amount and rhodium onto the same particulate support<br>
material, the second active alumina.<br>
According to the present understanding of the invention the reason for the reduced sen-<br>
sitivity against fuel-cut ageing may be that large excursions of the normalised air/fuel<br>
ratio from fat to lean values at high catalyst temperatures degrades the catalytic activity<br>
especially of rhodium. Under stoichiometric or fat exhaust gas conditions rhodium is<br>
reduced nearly to the oxidation state zero which is the most effective state for three-way<br>
catalysis. Under lean exhaust gases and at high catalyst temperatures rhodium gets oxi-<br>
dised up to oxidation level +3. This oxidation state of rhodium is less active for three-<br>
way conversion of pollutants. Moreover, since Rh2O3 is isomorphic in crystallographic<br>
structure to Al2O3 it can migrate at temperatures above 600°C into the lattice of alumina<br>
or other isomorphic support oxides of the general composition M2O3 (M stands for a<br>
metal atom), resulting in a permanent degradation of catalytic activity.<br>
To regain its catalytic activity and to avoid losses of rhodium into the lattice of alumina<br>
rhodium must therefore be reduced as quickly as possible when the exhaust gas compo-<br>
sition changes back to stoichiometry. According to the present understanding of the<br>
invention reduction of rhodium to oxidation state zero is catalysed by platinum. The<br>
more intimate the contact between platinum and rhodium the better is this reduction<br>
effect.<br>
In addition, the tendency of Rh2O3 to migrate into isomorphic support oxides can be<br>
limited by appropriate doping of these oxides. Beneficial are doping components which<br>
are capable of generating activated hydrogen under reducing conditions. The activated<br>
hydrogen helps to convert rhodium oxide more rapidly into the metallic form under re-<br>
ducing conditions and hence the risk of Rh2O3 migrating into the support oxide is fur-<br>
ther minimised. A suitable doping component for that purpose is cerium oxide (ceria).<br>
But since ceria also exhibits an oxygen storage and release capability the amount of<br>
doping with ceria must be kept low so as to not promote oxidation of rhodium by a too<br>
high level of ceria in the support oxide.<br>
Further improvement of the ageing stability of the catalyst is achieved by proper selec-<br>
tion of an oxygen storage component. Ceria is well-known to exhibit an oxygen storage<br>
capability. Under lean exhaust gas conditions cerium is completely oxidised to the oxi-<br>
dation state Ce4+. Under rich exhaust gas conditions ceria releases oxygen and acquires<br>
the Ce3+ oxidation state. Instead of using pure ceria as an oxygen storage compound the<br>
present invention uses ceria rich ceria/zirconia mixed oxide compounds. The term ceria<br>
rich denotes a material containing more than 50 wt.-% of ceria. Ceria concentrations of<br>
from 60 to 90 wt.-% relative to the total weight of the mixed oxide are preferred. Such<br>
materials are available with specific surface areas of 20 to 200 m2/g and exhibit a good<br>
temperature stability of the surface area. These materials are known to have a cubic<br>
crystalline habit of the type CeO2 as disclosed in US 5,712,218. Further improvements<br>
can be obtained by stabilising this material with praseodymia, yttria, neodymia, lan-<br>
thana, gadolinium oxide or mixtures thereof. Stabilising of oxygen storage materials<br>
based on ceria using praseodymia, neodymia, lanthana or mixtures thereof is described<br>
in German patent application DE 197 14 707 Al. Stabilisation of ceria/zirconia mixed<br>
oxide with praseodymia is much preferred.<br>
As already explained, the second part of the total platinum amount of the catalyst is in<br>
close contact to rhodium. This helps to reduce rhodium: oxide formed during fuel-cut-off<br>
phases back to low oxidation state. For performing this task mass ratios between plati-<br>
num and rhodium of 1:1 are most effective. Nevertheless, deviations from the 1:1 ratio<br>
between 3:1 and 1:5 have proven to still give good catalytic activities. While this mass<br>
ratio is valid for platinum and rhodium deposited together on the second active alumina<br>
the overall platinum/rhodium mass ratio in the catalyst may vary between 10:1 and 1:5.<br>
preferably between 10:1 and 1:1 with 3:1 being most preferred.<br>
The zirconia component of the first support materials may be zirconia, optionally stabi-<br>
lised with 0.5 to 10 wt.-% of yttria, ceria, neodymia, lanthana, praseodymia, gadolinium<br>
oxide or mixtures thereof. Alternatively, the zirconia component may be equipped with<br>
an oxygen storage function by adding ceria in an amount sufficient to provide a sub-<br>
stantial proportion of the total oxygen storage capacity of the catalyst. The ceria content<br>
of this zirconia component may vary from above 1 to below 50 wt.-% relative to the<br>
total weight of the zirconia component. Such materials are commercially available as<br>
so-called zirconia/ceria mixed oxides. "Zirconia" in the first place of "zirconia/ceria"<br>
indicates that zirconia is present in an amount which is at least equivalent but in general<br>
larger than the amount of ceria. Such a zirconia component may further be stabilised<br>
with the stabilisers mentioned above, namely yttria, neodymia, lanthana, praseodymia,<br>
gadolinium oxide or mixtures thereof at the expense of zirconia and ceria. Thus, the<br>
overall composition of the zirconia component may comprise of from 99.5 down to 45<br>
wt.-% of zirconia and of from 0.5 to 55 wt.-% of ceria, yttria, neodymia, lanthana, pra-<br>
seodymia, gadolinium oxide or mixtures thereof, whereby zirconia is present in an<br>
amount which is equal to or larger than the amount of ceria..<br>
The first support materials form the major part of the catalytic coating. The weight<br>
range of the first support materials relative to the second support material ranges be-<br>
tween 1:1 to 20:1. The concentration of the first part of the total platinum amount of<br>
the catalyst on the first support materials (selected from active alumina, ceria/zirconia<br>
mixed oxide and the zirconia component or mixtures thereof) ranges between 0,01 and<br>
5, preferably between 0,05 and 1 wt.-%, relative to the total weight of the catalysed<br>
materials. Contrary to that, the concentration of platinum plus rhodium on the second<br>
support material (second active alumina) is preferably higher and lies between 0,5 and<br>
20 wt.-% relative to the weight of the second support material with concentrations be-<br>
tween 1 and 15 wt.-% being preferred. In total, platinum and rhodium together are pres-<br>
ent in the catalytic coating in concentrations of from 0.02 to 10 wt.-% relative to the<br>
total weight of the coating.<br>
The catalyst carrier body used in the present invention is in the form of a honeycomb<br>
monolith with a plurality of substantially parallel passage ways extending therethrough.<br>
The passage ways are defined by walls onto which the catalytic coating is applied.<br>
The passage ways of the carrier body serve as flow conduits for the exhaust gas of the<br>
internal combustion engine. When flowing through these passages the exhaust gas<br>
comes into close contact with the catalytic coating whereby the pollutants contained in<br>
the exhaust gas are converted into benign products. The carrier bodies may be manu-<br>
factured from any suitable material, such as from metallic or ceramic materials as is<br>
well known in the art. The passage ways are arranged in a regular pattern over the cross<br>
section of the carrier bodies. The so-called cell density (passage ways per cross sec-<br>
tional area) may vary between 10 and 200 cm-2. Other suitable carrier bodies may have<br>
an open cell foam structure. Metallic or ceramic foams may be used.<br>
The catalytic coating is applied to the carrier body in amounts of from about 50 to 250<br>
g/1. Advantageously the catalytic coating comprises of from 0 to 150 g/1, preferably of<br>
from 20 to 150 g/1, of said first active alumina and of from 10 to 100 g/1, preferably of<br>
from 20 to 100 g/1, of said ceria/zirconia mixed oxide component. The zirconia compo-<br>
nent may be present in concentrations of from 0 to 80 g/1, preferably of from 5 to 60 g/1.<br>
For proper functioning of the catalyst it requires a sufficient oxygen storage capacity.<br>
The oxygen storage capacity of the catalyst is primarily supplied by said ceria rich<br>
ceria/zirconia component. In minor amounts also the zirconia component may provide a<br>
certain portion to the overall oxygen storage capacity of the catalyst. But in a preferred<br>
embodiment of the catalyst the oxygen storage capacity of the catalyst is solely based<br>
on ceria rich ceria/zirconia mixed oxide while the zirconia component is a pure zirconia<br>
material or zirconia stabilised with 0,5 to 10 wt.-% of the stabilisers already mentioned<br>
above.<br>
The concentration of said second active alumina is preferably selected between 5 and 50<br>
g/1. In a most preferred embodiment the first and second active alumina are the same<br>
and have a specific surface area between 50 and 200 m2/g and are stabilised with 0,5 to<br>
25 wt.-% of lanthana, ceria, yttria, neodymia, gadolinium oxide or mixtures thereof. The<br>
oxygen storage component is advantageously selected from ceria rich ceria/zirconia<br>
mixed oxides containing 60 to 90 wt.-% of ceria and additionally stabilised with 0,5 to<br>
10 wt.-% of praseodymia (Pr6O11).<br>
For the purpose of suppressing the emission of hydrogen sulphide the catalytic coating<br>
may further comprise from about 1 to 30 g/1 of a nickel, iron or manganese component.<br>
The surface area of the support materials for the noble metal components is important<br>
for the final catalytic activity of the catalyst. Generally the surface area of these materi-<br>
als should lie above 10 m2/g. The surface area of these materials is also called specific<br>
surface area or BET surface area in the art. Preferably the surface area of the materials<br>
should be larger than 50 m2/g, most preferably larger than 100 m2/g. Active aluminas<br>
with a surface area of 140 m2/g are conventional. Oxygen storage components based on<br>
ceria or ceria/zirconia mixed oxides are available with surface areas of 80 m2/g up to<br>
200 m2/g, depending on the state of calcination upon delivery. Besides this, there are<br>
also available so-called low surface area ceria materials with surface areas below<br>
10 m2/g. Zirconia materials with 100 m2/g are also conventional.<br>
The invention is further explained with respect to accompaying Figures 1 to 3.<br><br>
Figure 1: Figure 1 visualises the structure of an embodiment of the single layer cata-<br>
lyst comprising first and second alumina, ceria/zirconia and zirconia as sup-<br>
port materials.<br>
Figure 2: Figure 2 visualises the structure of a second embodiment of the single layer<br>
catalyst comprising only the second alumina, ceria/zirconia and zirconia as<br>
support materials.<br>
Figure 3: Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of the fuel cut-ageing employed in this in-<br>
vention<br>
Figure 1 shows a sectional view of a first embodiment of the catalytic coating, com-<br>
prising both the first and second active alumina. The coating is deposited on an inert<br>
carrier. The different support materials of the catalyst are symbolised by different geo-<br>
metric bodies. Platinum only is deposited on the first alumina (represented by a hexa-<br>
gon), on ceria/zirconia (represented by an ellipse) and on zirconia (represented by an<br>
octagon). The platinum crystallites are symbolised by small circles. Platinum and rho-<br>
dium are deposited on the second alumina. The rhodium crystallites are symbolised by<br>
small diamonds. In the present catalyst platinum and rhodium are in intimate contact<br>
with each other. In order to visualise this fact, platinum and rhodium crystallites are<br>
arranged in Figure 1 in pairs. This arrangement in pairs is only for explanation purposes<br>
and is not intended to restrict the scope of the invention. The actual relationship be-<br>
tween platinum and rhodium is dependent on the manufacturing process and may vary<br>
from isolated platinum and rhodium crystallites on the same alumina particle via closely<br>
neighboured platinum and rhodium crystallites to real platinum/rhodium alloys.<br>
According to the present understanding of the invention it is expected that best results<br>
are achieved with closely neighboured platinum and rhodium crystallites and real plati-<br>
num/rhodium alloys.<br>
While in Figure 1 first and second alumina are employed as supports for platinum and<br>
platinum/rhodium, respectively, it should be understood that the first alumina support-<br>
ing platinum is an optional component which may be omitted since platinum is also<br>
supported by ceria/zirconia and zirconia component. Such an embodiment of the inven-<br>
tive catalyst is shown in Figure 2. In Figure 2 the catalyst layer does not contain the first<br>
alumina component.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention may be manufactured in various wavs. Some of<br>
them will be described below:<br>
For applying the catalytic coating to the passage ways of the catalyst carrier, the catalyst<br>
carrier can be coated with an aqueous coating composition comprising the specified<br>
catalysed particulate support materials. The coating composition will also be called<br>
coating dispersion within the context of this invention. The techniques for coating cata-<br>
lyst carriers with such a coating composition are well known to the expert. The coating<br>
is then dried and calcined in air. Drying is preferably done at elevated temperatures of<br>
up to 150°C. For calcining the coating, temperatures of from 200 to 500°C for a period<br>
from 0,5 to 5 hours should be applied.<br>
Before preparing the coating composition, the support materials have to be catalysed<br>
with the respective noble metals. For catalysing the support materials with platinum<br>
only, conventional techniques such as impregnation with a solution containing a precur-<br>
sor compound of platinum may be employed. Any platinum precursor compound may<br>
be used provided the compound is soluble in the chosen solvent and decomposes to the<br>
metal upon heating in air at elevated temperatures. Illustrative of these platinum com-<br>
pounds are chloroplatinic acid, ammonium chloroplatinate, platinum tetrachloride hy-<br>
drate, platinum dichlorocarbonyl dichloride, dinitrodiamino platinum, platinum nitrate<br>
and amine solubilised platinum hydroxide. Precursor compounds with low or no chlo-<br>
rine content are preferred. Especially preferred are amine solubilised platinum com-<br>
pounds such as methylethanolamine platinum (IV) hexahydroxide (MEA)2Pt(OH)6 and<br>
ethanolamine platinum (IV) hexahydroxide (EA)2Pt(OH)6. These anionic complex com-<br>
pounds of platinum are known to yield platinum metal deposits of high dispersion. After<br>
impregnation the support materials are dried at elevated temperatures and calcined at<br>
temperatures between 200 and 500°C in air to thermally fix platinum thereon. The thus<br>
catalysed materials are then preferably dispersed in water to give a first dispersion.<br>
In a preferred method for catalysing the respective support materials with platinum they<br>
are impregnated by the so-called injection impregnation. The method of impregnation<br>
by injection is described in German patent applications DE 197 14 732 Al and DE 197<br>
14 707 Al. For that purpose the support materials are dispersed in water and then a so-<br>
lution of a basic precursor compound of platinum, preferably (EA)2Pt(OH)6, is injected<br>
slowly into the dispersion. Thereby the pH-value of the dispersion is raised into the ba-<br>
sic region. Platinum is then precipitated onto the particulate materials by properly ad-<br>
justing the pH-value of the dispersion with acetic acid. Precipitation starts when the pH-<br>
value of the dispersion starts to drop. Generally a pH-value below 7 is needed to com-<br>
plete precipitation. During injection and precipitation the dispersion is continuously<br>
agitated to rapidly distribute the injected solution homogeneously over the whole vol-<br>
ume of the dispersion. This procedure ensures firm adhesion of the precipitated plati-<br>
num compound on the support materials so that thermal fixation by drying and calcining<br>
as describe above is no longer necessary. The dispersion resulting from this procedure<br>
may directly be used as the first dispersion mentioned above.<br>
Next, the second active alumina carrying platinum and rhodium is prepared by impreg-<br>
nating this support with an aqueous solution of soluble precursor compounds of plati-<br>
num and rhodium and drying and calcining the impregnated support. Suitable precursor<br>
compounds for platinum are those already mentioned above. As precursor for rhodium<br>
hexaamminerhodium chloride, rhodium trichloride, rhodium carbonylchloride, rhodium<br>
trichloride hydrate, rhodium nitrate and rhodium acetate may be used advantageously,<br>
but rhodium nitrate being preferred.<br>
The second active alumina may be impregnated with platinum and rhodium precursors<br>
sequentially in any order or simultaneously from one common solution. The thus cata-<br>
lysed active alumina is dried and calcined to fix platinum and rhodium thereon. Then<br>
this material is redispersed in water to give a second dispersion. First and second disper-<br>
sions are then combined to yield the final coating composition.<br>
However, as pointed out above, it is highly desirable to obtain a contact between plati-<br>
num and rhodium as intimate as possible. It was found that this is best achieved by first<br>
depositing platinum and subsequently rhodium onto the support material by the above<br>
described injection precipitation. For that purpose a basic precursor compound of plati-<br>
num, preferably an amine solubilised platinum like ethanolamine platinum (IV) hexa-<br>
hydroxide, is precipitated by properly adjusting the pH-value of the dispersion with<br>
acetic acid to a value between 6 and 8. After precipitation of platinum, the support is not<br>
dried and calcined but rhodium is then directly precipitated from a solution of an acidic<br>
precursor compound of rhodium, such as rhodium nitrate.<br>
In detail, the second dispersion with platinum and rhodium deposited on active alumina<br>
is prepared by dispersing the active alumina in water and then injecting an aqueous so-<br>
lution of an famine solubilised precursor compound of platinum into the coating disper-<br>
sion. The amine solubilised precursor compound of platinum is readily adsorbed onto<br>
the active alumina. Thereafter, an aqueous solution of an acidic precursor compound of<br>
rhodium is injected into this dispersion and then the pH-value of the dispersion is prop-<br>
erly adjusted to fix the platinum and rhodium compounds onto the second active alu-<br>
mina. This second dispersion is then combined with the first dispersion to yield the final<br>
coating composition for the catalyst.<br>
The beneficial properties of the catalyst according to the invention will now be ex-<br>
plained further with the help of the following examples. For all catalysts of the follow-<br>
ing examples honeycomb carriers made from cordierit were used (diameter 10,16 cm;<br>
length 15,24 cm; cell density 62 cm-2). The concentration or loading of the various<br>
washcoat components are given relative to the volume of the carriers in grams per litre<br>
(g/1).<br>
Example 1:<br>
A catalyst according to the invention was prepared by coating a honeycomb carrier with<br>
a catalytic coating as described below. The finished coating comprised a platinum to<br>
rhodium weight ratio of 5:1 and a total noble metal loading of 1,41 g/1 (40 g/ft3). The<br>
concentration of the oxidic washcoat components was 160 g/1. This catalyst is desig-<br>
nated as Cl in the following.<br>
Preparation of the first dispersion:<br>
To a solution of praseodymium acetate a cerium rich oxygen storage component (70<br>
wt-% ceria, 30 wt-% zirconia, surface area: 200 m2/g) was added. By controlled injec-<br>
tion of ammonia and stirring for about 30 minutes, praseodymium acetate was precipi-<br>
tated onto ceria/zirconia. Subsequently stabilised alumina (3 wt-% La2O3, 97 wt-%<br>
Al2O3, surface area: 140 m2/g) and bulk zirconia (surface area: 100 m2/g) were added.<br>
After this, a solution of (EA)2Pt(OH)6 was injected into the slurry and platinum was<br>
precipitated onto ceria/zirconia and zirconia by proper adjustment of the pH-value of<br>
the dispersion with acetic acid.<br>
Preparation of the second dispersion:<br>
Stabilised alumina (3 wt-% La2O3, 97 wt-% Al2O3) was dispersed in water. Thereafter a<br>
chloride free platinum salt (EA)2Pt(OH)6 was injected and was readily adsorbed onto<br>
the alumina. Thereafter rhodium nitrate was injected. By adjusting the pH-value with<br>
acetic acid both catalytic components were fixed onto the supporting alumina.<br>
Both dispersions were combined to form a coating composition. The carrier was coated<br>
with this composition by dip coating, dried and calcined at 500°C in air.<br>
The placement of the various components of this catalyst with respect to one another is<br>
visualised below. The numbers give the concentration of the coating components in g/l<br>
of carrier volume. The precipitation of praseodymium onto ceria/zirconia during the<br>
preparation of the first dispersion resulted in a ceria/zireonia stabilised with praseo-<br>
dymium oxide (CeO2/ZrO2/Pr6O11) after calcination of the coating. The ceria/zirconia<br>
concentration of this material was 51,7 g/1 while the praseodymia concentration was<br>
4,3 g/1.<br>
The first three lines give the constituents of the coating resulting from the first coating<br>
dispersion and the fourth line gives the constituents resulting from the second disper-<br>
sion.<br>
Comparison example 1;<br>
The catalyst Cl according to example 1 was compared to a double layer catalyst ac-<br>
cording to example 1 of copending European patent application with publication num-<br>
ber EP 1 046 423 A2. This catalyst has a similar composition to the catalyst of the pres-<br>
ent invention. It differs from the catalyst of the present invention in that the support<br>
materials catalysed with platinum only are arranged in a first layer and alumina cata-<br>
lysed with platinum and rhodium is arranged together with further components in a sec-<br>
ond outer layer.<br>
Preparation of first (inner) layer:<br>
To a solution of praseodymium acetate a cerium rich oxygen storage component (70<br>
wt-% ceria, 30 wt-% zirconia) was added. By controlled injection of ammonia and stir-<br>
ring for about 30 min praseodymium acetate was precipitated onto ceria/zirconia. Sub-<br>
sequently stabilised alumina (3 wt-% La2O3, 97 wt-% Al2O3) and bulk zirconia were<br>
added. After this, a platinum solution (EA)2Pt(OH)6 was injected into the slurry and<br>
platinum was precipitated onto alumina, zirconia and ceria/zirconia by proper adjust-<br>
ment of the pH-value of the dispersion with acetic acid.<br>
After milling the slurry, a monolithic carrier was dipped into the slurry to apply the first<br>
layer. The complete washcoat uptake after drying and calcining in air at 500°C was<br>
Preparation of second (outer) layer:<br>
Stabilised alumina (4 wt-% La2O3, 96 wt-% Al2O3) was dispersed in water. Thereafter a<br>
chloride free platinum salt (EA)2Pt(OH)6 was injected and was readily adsorbed onto<br>
the alumina. Thereafter rhodium nitrate was injected. By adjusting the pH-value both<br>
catalytic components were fixed onto the supporting alumina.<br>
To finish the washcoat, alumina, praseodymium acetate and a ceria rich oxygen storage<br>
component (70 wt-% ceria, 30 wt-% zirconia) were introduced.<br>
Before coating a monolithic substrate, the slurry was adjusted to a pH of approximately<br>
6 and milled. The total washcoat uptake of the second layer was 70 g/1. The catalyst was<br>
dried and calcined at 500°C in air.<br>
Placement and concentration values of the various components of this catalyst with re-<br>
spect to one another is visualised below:<br>
In the first layer the ceria/zirconia stabilised with praseodymia had the same weight<br>
ratio of ceria/zirconia to praseodymia as given in example 1 (51,7/4,3)- In the second<br>
layer praseodymium acetate was impregnated onto all components of this layer.<br>
The mass ratio of platinum to rhodium was 1Pt/1Rh in the top layer. The total platinum<br>
and rhodium content was 1,41 g/1 (1,175 g Pt/1 and 0,235 g Rh/1) at a mass ratio of<br>
5Pt/lRh (combined mass ratio for both layers). This comparison catalyst will be desig-<br>
nated as CC1 in the following.<br>
Evaluation of catalysts;<br>
The light off temperatures of the catalysts according to the invention and the com-<br>
parison catalyst (both will be called "sample catalysts" in the following) were tested at a<br>
vehicle with a V8 internal combustion engine (8 cylinder engine; displacement 5,3 1).<br>
The exhaust gas system of this engine was equipped with two exhaust gas converters in<br>
sequence. The first converter was closely coupled to the engine while the second con-<br>
verter was arranged underfloor.<br>
The close coupled converter was equipped with a palladium only catalyst which had a<br>
volume of 0,431 1 at a diameter of 9,3 cm (3,66 inch) and at a length of 6,35 cm<br>
(2,5 inch). The sample catalysts had a volume of 0,776 1 at the same diameter as the<br>
close coupled catalyst but at a length of 11,43 cm (4,5 inch). The two sample catalysts<br>
were each placed into an individual underfloor converter.<br>
Before measuring the light off temperatures, the underfloor converters with the sample<br>
catalysts were first subjected for 65 hours to an ageing procedure at a motor test stand<br>
certified by the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The maximum converter<br>
inlet temperature was 850°C. This ageing procedure is acknowledged to be equivalent<br>
to a normal driving cycle of 80000 km.<br>
After the ageing procedure, the two underfloor converters were installed one at a time to<br>
the test vehicle. Then the engine was run according to the FTP 75 test cycle. The emis-<br>
sions collected in all three bags are listed in table 3. The emissions of carbon monoxide<br>
are not listed because they remained far below all current and future emission limits.<br>

carbons (NMHC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)<br>
Example 2;<br>
A further catalyst according to example 1 was prepared. Differently from example 1 the<br>
catalyst was prepared with an integral platinum to rhodium weight ratio of 2:1 while the<br>
platinum to rhodium weight ratio on the second alumina was kept at 1:1. The completed<br>
honeycomb catalyst after drying and calcining had a coating concentration of 160 g/1<br>
oxidic components and 1,06 g/1 (30 g/ft3) platinum plus rhodium. This catalyst is desig-<br>
nated as C2 in the following.<br>
Placement and concentration (g/1 of carrier volume) of the various components of cata-<br>
lyst C2 with respect to one another is visualised below:<br>
Comparison Example 2:<br>
The catalyst of the invention uses active alumina stabilised with lanthana, particulate<br>
zirconia and particulate ceria/zirconia as support materials for the noble metals of the<br>
catalyst.<br>
State of the art catalyst designs are frequently based on unstabilised active alumina and<br>
particulate ceria. Additionally cerium acetate and zirconium acetate are added to the<br>
coating dispersion and converted into ceria and zirconia homogeneously dispersed<br>
throughout the catalyst upon calcining the catalytic coating. The coating is then cata-<br>
lysed by impregnation with platinum and rhodium compounds.<br>
In order to compare this older technology with the catalyst according to the invention<br>
comparison catalyst CC2 was manufactured as follows: The active alumina (surface<br>
area 140 m /g) and particulate ceria (low surface area material with 10 m /g) were dis-<br>
persed in water. After addition of cerium acetate and zirconium acetate the resulting<br>
coating dispersion was used to coat a honeycomb carrier. The thus prepared support<br>
layer was dried and calcined and then simultaneously impregnated with platinum and<br>
rhodium using a common solution of platinum tetraammine nitrate and rhodium nitrate.<br>
The impregnated coating was again dried and calcined.<br>
Placement and concentration of the various components of catalyst CC2 with respect to<br>
one another is visualised below:<br>
Comparison Example 3;<br>
A further comparison catalyst designated as CC3 was manufactured as follows: All oxi-<br>
dic components of the catalyst of example 2 were first catalysed with platinum as de-<br>
scribed in example 2 and then dispersed in water and coated onto a honeycomb carrier.<br>
The coating was dried and calcined. The resulting catalytic layer was then further im-<br>
pregnated with rhodium nitrate and dried and calcined. This comparison catalyst had the<br>
same overall concentration of the constituents as catalyst C2. The only difference re-<br>
sided in the placement of platinum and rhodium with respect to the support materials<br>
and with respect to one another.<br>
Placement and concentration of the various components of catalyst CC3 with respect to<br>
one another is visualised below:<br>
Comparison Example 4:<br>
A further comparison catalyst designated as CC4 was manufactured using the processes<br>
as already outlined in example 1 and 2. Comparison catalyst CC4 had the same overall<br>
concentration of the constituents as catalyst C2. Differently from example 2 platinum<br>
and rhodium were placed on different support materials as visualised below:<br>
Evaluation of catalysts C2. CC2. CC3 and CC4:<br>
Fuel-cut ageing procedure:<br>
The four catalysts were first subjected to a so-called fuel-cut ageing on an engine with a<br>
displacement of 2,8 1 for a duration of 76 hours. The exhaust system of this engine was<br>
equipped with a special adapter which allowed to age all four catalysts in parallel.<br>
The fuel cut ageing comprised four cycles of 19 hours length. Each cycle consisted of<br>
two phases as shown in Figure 3. During phase I the catalysts were subjected to 75 sub-<br>
cycles simulating fuel-cut conditions. During each sub-cycle the exhaust gas tempera-<br>
ture in front of the catalyst was adjusted to a value of 850°C by increasing the load of<br>
the engine accordingly. The engine was operated at a lambda value of 1 (stoichiometric<br>
operation). After an initial phase of 360 seconds of stoichiometric operation fuel supply<br>
was interrupted every 60 seconds for 5 seconds so that the lambda value jumped from 1<br>
to 2,5. Fuel cut resulted in an exposure of the catalyst to highly oxidising, lean exhaust<br>
gas conditions at high exhaust gas temperatures. During stoichiometric operation the<br>
temperature at the catalyst increased by 80 to 100°C due to the exothermal reactions at<br>
the catalyst Each of the 75 sub-cycles lasted for 625 seconds.<br>
Phase II consisted of 12 sub-cycles simulating poisoning of the catalysts with sulphur<br>
compounds at moderate exhaust gas temperatures. During each sub-cycle the exhaust<br>
gas temperature was increased in three steps from 490°C to 580°C and then to 680°C.<br>
Each step lasted for 10 minutes.<br>
After fuel-cut ageing, the light off temperatures Tso% for the conversion of HC, CO and<br>
NOx and the CO/NOx dynamic cross-over points were determined at an engine with a<br>
displacement of 2 litres. The term "light off temperature" designates the exhaust gas<br>
temperature at which 50 % of the respective pollutant is converted by the catalyst. The<br>
term "dynamic cross-over point" and its measurement is described in detail in the co-<br>
pending European patent application EP 1 046 423 A2 of the present inventors.<br>
The light-off measurements were done at a space velocity of 65000 h-1 with gradually<br>
increasing the exhaust gas temperature (38 K/min) of the engine. During these meas-<br>
urements the lambda-value was modulated with an amplitude of ± 0,5 A/F (A/F = air to<br>
fuel ratio) and a frequency of 1 Hz. The mean lambda-value was regulated to a value of<br>
0,999.<br>
The conversion value at the cross-over point is the highest conversion which can be<br>
achieved simultaneously for CO and NOx. The higher this cross-over point the better is<br>
the dynamic behaviour of the catalytic activity of the catalyst. The cross-over points<br>
were determined at an exhaust gas temperature of 400°C.<br>
The results of these measurements are listed in Table 4. Each value is the mean value of<br>
several measurements. The cross-over points depend slightly on the direction of chang-<br>
ing the lambda value. The values given in Table 4 are the mean values obtained from<br>
changing the lambda value from rich to lean and from lean to reach. In addition these<br>
measurements were averaged over several lean to reach and reach to lean cycles.<br>
The results of Table 4 demonstrate that the inventive catalyst C2 has a considerably<br>
improved dynamic behaviour of its catalytic activity though its light off temperatures<br>
T5o% do not differ so much from the light off temperatures of the comparison catalysts.<br>
The difference between the cross-over conversion of the inventive catalyst and the<br>
comparison catalysts would have been even more pronounced at higher exhaust gas<br>
temperatures during ageing (e.g. 950°C instead of 850°C in front of the catalysts).<br>
Example 3:<br>
A further catalyst C3 was prepared identically to catalyst C2.<br>
Comparison Example 5;<br>
Frequently barium oxide is added to the coating dispersion in the form of barium hy-<br>
droxide to improve temperature stability of the alumina component of the catalytic<br>
composition and to improve NOx conversion of the catalyst To investigate the influ-<br>
ence of barium oxide on the catalytic activity under the conditions of fuel-cut ageing<br>
comparison catalyst CC5 was prepared. CC5 was a variant of catalyst C3. The 70 g/l of<br>
La/Al2O3 of the first coating dispersion were reduced to 60 g/1 and 10 g/1 of barium ox-<br>
ide were added in the form of barium hydroxide instead.<br>
Comparison Example 6;<br>
Comparison catalyst CC6 was prepared in analogy to example 1 of US 5,200,384. For<br>
the coating dispersion active alumina with a surface area of 140 m2/g, ceria with a sur-<br>
face area of 80 m2/g, zirconium carbonate and zirconia/ceria mixed oxide (weight ratio<br>
80/20) were used. The weight ratio of platinum to rhodium was set to 2:1 and the total<br>
concentration of the oxidic washcoat components in the finished catalyst was increased<br>
to 160 g/1. Preparation of the catalyst followed as closely as possible the procedure as<br>
outlined in example 1 of US 5,200,384. As disclosed mere, all platinum and rhodium<br>
were deposited onto active alumina. For that purpose (EA)2Pt(OH)6 and rhodium nitrate<br>
were used.<br>
The finished catalyst had the following composition: 1,06 g/1 (30 g/ft3) platinum plus<br>
rhodium; weight ratio of platinum to rhodium 2:1; 102,4 g/1 alumina; 38,4 g/l ceria;<br>
6,4 g/1 zirconia (ex zirconium carbonate) and 12,8 g/1 zirconia/ceria. The concentration<br>
of all oxidic components of the catalyst was 160 g/1.<br>
Comparison Example 7:<br>
Comparison catalyst CC7 was prepared in analogy to example 1 of US 4,965,243. For<br>
the coating dispersion active alumina with a surface area of 140 m2/g, ceria with a sur-<br>
face area of 80 m2/g, zirconia with a surface area of 100 m2/g and barium hydroxide<br>
were used. The weight ratio of platinum to rhodium was set to 2:1 and the total concen-<br>
tration of the oxidic washcoat components in the finished catalyst was increased to<br>
160 g/1. Preparation of the catalyst followed as closely as possible the procedure as out-<br>
lined in example 1 of US 4,965,243. As disclosed there, all platinum and rhodium were<br>
deposited onto active alumina. For that purpose (EA)2Pt(OH)6 and rhodium nitrate were<br>
used.<br>
The finished catalyst had the following composition: 1,06 g/1 (30 g/ft3) platinum plus<br>
rhodium; weight ratio of platinum to rhodium 2:1; 85,2 g/1 alumina; 48,7 g/1 ceria;<br>
17 g/1 zirconia and 9,1 g/1 baria (ex barium hydroxide).<br>
Evaluation of catalyst C3, CC5, CC6 and CC7;<br>
The four catalysts were aged as before and then subjected to the same test procedures as<br>
outlined for the results of Table 4. The cross-over conversion values were determined at<br>
400°C at a lambda modulation of lHz ± 0,5 A/F and at 450°C at a lambda modulation<br>
of lHz ±1,0 A/F. The results are listed in Table 5.<br>
For comparison catalyst CC7 no cross-over point at 450°C could be detected.<br>
The cross-over conversions of comparison catalyst CC5 are considerably lower than the<br>
corresponding values of catalyst C3. This is attributed to the detrimental influence of<br>
barium oxide on platinum under the conditions of fuel-cut ageing. Fuel-cut ageing leads<br>
to the formation of platinum platinate and hence to a decrease in catalytic activity. This<br>
also holds for comparison catalyst CC7 for which no cross-over point could be detected<br>
at 450°C after fuel-cut ageing.<br>
