COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
IMPROVED SOLID DETERGENT COMPOSITION <br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical field :<br>
The invention relates to a solid synergistic detergent composition for cleaning hard surfaces. More particularly the compositions of the invention are especially, but not exclusively, in the form of bars/shaped tablets, useful for cleaning hard surfaces and manual dish washing.<br>
Background and Prior art :<br>
Commercial hard surface cleaning compositions typically comprise, one or more surfactants and a plurality of abrasives dispersed therein. Combinations of these together with electrolytes are generally used to form a structuring system as is well known in the art.<br>
The conventional cleaning compositions for hard surface cleaning are formulated in the form of solids such as powders, granules, pastes and bars, and in the form of fluid formulations such as liquids and gels.<br>
Cleaning compositions in the solid form are much cheaper than liquids because of low cost packaging and these are very popular forms for developing countries. Amongst the solid form bars are gaining popularity and growing rapidly in the market of developing countries because of better value delivery. The product dosage in the solid form is easier, it avoids spillage and the product application can be better controlled. Cleaning compositions in the bar form are economically superior to other product forms and the dosage per swipe from the bar is highly<br><br>
controlled. The bars/tablets also do not get easily sogged in the presence of water and the active ingredients are not lost. The bars/tablets require low packaging material and because of the ease of application it is highly preferred over the other forms of the same composition and it is especially important for low cost markets of the developing countries.<br>
US5929008 (P&amp;G) discloses a liquid automatic dishwashing composition, that is free of carbonate and with a reserve alkalinity of 6.2 or greater, that gives a wash pH of 11.5 or greater. This refers to only liquid compositions that is free of carbonates and the high wash pH makes the composition unsuitable for use under manual washing conditions.<br>
The applicants have found that a product form like bars/tablets having a pH not greater than 11.0 and a reserve alkalinity in the range of 5 to 12 units is suitable for manual washing.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to detergent bar compositions of pH not greater than 11.0, for cleaning hard surfaces, comprising a detergent active, abrasive materials and a combination of one or more of sodium carbonate, a phosphate builder and a silicate, to achieve a reserve alkalinity of 5 to 12 units. The detergent bars so prepared have good lathering properties, lather stability to soil and improved economy of use. They are particularly useful for tough soil<br><br>
cleaning and greasy soil removal. There are other user benefits such as improved shine of the cleaned surface and easy rinsability of the product from the surface.<br>
Definition of the Invention:<br>
Thus according to the invention there is provided a detergent bar composition<br>
with a pH not greater than 11.0 essentially comprising:<br>
i.	10 to 18% by wt. of a detergent active;<br>
ii.        10 to 85% by wt. of abrasive materials<br>
iii.       a reserve alkalinity of 5 to 12 units, obtained by using one or more of<br>
sodium carbonate, a phosphate builder and a source of silicate; iv.       not greater than 2% of a sulphate salt of calcium or magnesium or<br>
aluminium or a mixture thereof; v.       and optionally other conventional ingredients.<br>
In particular, there is provided a detergent bar composition with a pH not greater<br>
than 11.0 essentially comprising:<br>
i.	10 to 18% by wt. of a detergent active;<br>
ii.        10 to 85% by wt. of abrasive materials;<br>
iii.       a reserve aikaiinity or 5 to  12 units, which is obtained by using a<br>
combination of 8-16% sodium carbonate, 0-5% sodium tri-polyphosphate<br>
and 0.5-10% a source of silicate;<br><br>
iv.       not greater than 2% of sulphate salt of aluminium and/or magnesium; v.       and optionally other conventional ingredients.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The essential feature of the invention is to maintain a reserve alkalinity level of 5 to 12 units in a detergent bar whose pH is not greater than 11.0. The bars according to the invention are particularly suited for hard surface cleaning.<br>
Reserve alkalinity<br>
The reserve alkalinity is defined as the amount of 0.1 N HCI (in ml) required to<br>
bring the pH of 50 ml of 1% aqueous solution of the product to 8.0.<br>
It is preferred to have a reserve alkalinity of 6 to 10 units (i.e. 6 to 10 ml of 0.1 N HCI) Such range of reserve alkalinity is essential for better cleaning without damage to the surface or the user. It is preferred to obtain such reserve alkalinity by using a combination of sodium carbonate, a phosphate builder selected from sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) or tetrasodium pyrophosphate (TSPP) and a source of silicate.<br>
The sodium carbonate is preferably present in an amount from 8 to 16%, more preferably from 10-14%.<br><br>
The phosphate builder is preferably present in an amount from 0.1 to 5% and more preferably 0.5 to 2%. The phosphate builder may be chosen from STPP, TSPP, SHMP etc. STPP is especially preferred.<br>
The silicate is chosen from sodium silicate, potassium silicate or sodium metasilicate or their mixtures thereof, provided that the amount of the silicate is from 0.5 to 10% and more preferably 0.5 to 4% in the formulation.<br>
It is preferable to incorporate sulphate of calcium, magnesium or aluminium or their mixtures thereof in the detergent bar, provided that the amount of the sulphate is not greater than 2% in the detergent bar. Aluminium and magnesium sulphate are especially preferred.<br>
The detergent active<br>
The composition according to the invention will preferably comprise detergent actives which are generally chosen from anionic, nonionic, cationic, zwitterionic detergent actives or mixtures thereof. It is also possible to include low levels of soap in the formulation.<br>
The detergent active is preferably present in an amount from 10 to 18%, more preferably from 10 to 15%.<br><br>
Suitable anionic detergent active compounds are water soluble salts of organic sulphuric reaction products having in the molecular structure an alkyl radical containing from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, and a radical chosen from sulphonic acid or sulphur acid ester radicals and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of suitable anionic detergents are sodium and potassium alcohol sulphates, especially those obtained by sulphating the higher alcohols produced by reducing the glycerides of tallow or coconut oil ; sodium and potassium alkyl benzene sulphonates such as those in which the alkyl group contains from 9 to 15 carbon atoms ; sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow and coconut oil ; sodium coconut oil fatty acid monoglyceride sulphates ; sodium and potassium salts of sulphuric acid esters of the reaction product of one mole of a higher fatty alcohol and from 1 to 7 moles of ethylene oxide ; sodium and potassium salts of alkyl phenol ethylene oxide ether sulphate with from 1 to 8 units of ethylene oxide molecule and in which the alkyl radicals contain from 4 to 14 carbon atoms; the reaction product of fatty acids esterified with isethionic acid and neutralised with sodium hydroxide where, for example, the fatty acids are derived from coconut oil and mixtures thereof. The preferred water-soluble synthetic anionic detergent active compounds are the alkali metal (such as sodium and potassium) and alkaline earth metal (such as calcium and magnesium) salts of higher alkyl benzene sulphonates and mixtures with olefin sulphonates and higher alkyl sulphates, and the higher fatty acid monoglyceride sulphates.  The most preferred anionic<br><br><br>
detergent active compounds are higher alkyl aromatic sulphonates such as higher alkyl benzene sulphonates containing from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl group in a straight or branched chain, particular examples of which are sodium salts of higher alkyl benzene sulphonates or of higher-alkyl toluene, xylene or phenol sulphonates, alkyl naphthalene sulphonates, ammonium diamyl naphthalene sulphonate, and sodium dinonyl naphthalene sulphonate.<br>
Suitable nonionic detergent active compounds can be broadly described as compounds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxide groups, which are hydrophilic in nature, with an organic hydrophobic compound which may be aliphatic or alkyl aromatic in nature. The length of the hydrophilic or polyoxyalkylene radical which is condensed with any particular hydrophobic group can be readily adjusted to yield a water-soluble compound having the desired degree of balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements.<br>
Particular examples include the condensation product of aliphatic alcohols having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms in either straight or branched chain configuration with ethylene oxide, such as a coconut oil ethylene oxide condensate having from 2 to 15 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of coconut alcohol; condensates of alkylphenols whose alkyl group contains from 6 to 12 carbon atoms with 5 to 25 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alkylphenol; condensates of the reaction product of ethylenediamine and propylene oxide with   ethylene   oxide,   the   condensate   containing   from   40   to   80%   of<br><br>
polyoxyethylene radicals by weight and having a molecular weight of from 5,000 to 11,000; tertiary amine oxides of structure R3NO, where one group R is an alkyl group of 8 to 18 carbon atoms and the others are each methyl, ethyl or hydroxyethyl groups, for instance dimethyldodecylamine oxide; tertiary phosphine oxides of structure R3PO, where one group R is an alkyl group of from 10 to 18 carbon atoms, and the others are each alkyl or hydroxyalkyl groups of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, for instance dimethyldodecylphosphine oxide; and dialkyl sulphoxides of structure R2SO where the group R is an alkyl group of from 10 to 18 carbon atoms and the other is methyl or ethyl, for instance methyltetradecyl sulphoxide; fatty acid alkylolamides; alkylene oxide condensates of fatty acid alkylolamides and alkyl mercaptans.<br>
Suitable amphoteric detergent-active compounds that optionally can be employed are derivatives of aliphatic secondary and tertiary amines containing an alkyl group of 8 to 18 carbon atoms and an aliphatic radical substituted by an anionic water-solubilizing group, for instance sodium 3-dodecylamino-propionate, sodium 3-dodecylaminopropane sulphonate and sodium N-2-hydroxydodecyl-N-methyltaurate. Suitable cationic detergent-active compounds are quaternary ammonium salts having an aliphatic radical of from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, for instance cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide.<br>
Suitable zwitterionic detergent-active compounds that optionally can be employed are derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium, sulphonium and<br><br>
phosphonium compounds having an aliphatic radical of from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and an aliphatic radical substituted by an anionic water-solubilising group, for instance 3-(N-N-dimethyl-N-hexadecylammonium) propane-1-sulphonate betaine, 3-(dodecylmethyl sulphonium) propane-1-sulphonate betaine and 3-(cetylmethylphosphonium) ethane sulphonate betaine.<br>
The term soap denotes salts of carboxylic fatty acids. The soap may be derived from any of the triglycerides conventionally used in soap manufacture consequently the carboxylate anions in the soap may contain from 8 to 22 carbon atoms.<br>
The soap may be obtained by saponifying a triglyceride and/or a fatty acid. The triglyceride may be fats or oils generally used in soap manufacture such as tallow, tallow stearines, palm oil, palm stearines, soya bean oil, fish oil, caster oil, rice bran oil, sunflower oil, coconut oil, babassu oil, palm kernel oil, and others. In the above process the fatty acids are derived from oils/fats selected from coconut, rice bran, groundnut, tallow, palm, palm kernel, cotton seed, soybean, castor etc.<br>
Further examples of suitable detergent-active compounds are compounds commonly used as surface-active agents given in the well-known textbooks "Surface Active Agents", Volume I by Schwartz and Perry and "Surface Active Agents and Detergents", Volume II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br><br>
Abrasives<br>
Abrasives can be water soluble and/or water insoluble. Soluble abrasives are<br>
present in such excess to any water present in the composition that the solubility<br>
of the abrasive in the aqueous phase is exceeded and consequently solid<br>
abrasive exists in the composition.	<br>
Suitable abrasives can be selected from, particulate zeolites, calcites, dolomites, feldspar, silicas, silicates, other carbonates, aluminas, bicarbonates, borates, sulphates, aluminium oxide and polymeric materials such as polyethylene.<br>
Calcite, feldspar and dolomite and mixtures thereof are particularly preferred due to their low cost, suitable hardness and colour.<br>
Preferred abrasives for use in general purpose compositions particularly bars have a Mho hardness 2 - 9. Preferred average particle sizes for the abrasive fall in the range 25-400 microns, with values of 30-200 microns being preferred. Preferred levels of total abrasive soluble and insoluble together range from 10-85 wt % on product, more preferably in the range 20-60 wt%.<br><br>
Other Ingredients<br>
Other optional ingredients may be present in the bar and include zeolites, fillers, solvents, perfumes, colouring agents, flourescers, enzymes can also be used in the formulation. Fillers suitable for use in the formulation include kaolin, calcium carbonate (calcite), talc, sodium sulphate, soapstone, china clay and the like, used singly or in combination.<br>
The compositions according to the invention may optionally contain polymeric structuring agents to aid in providing appropriate rheological properties and in enhancing their distribution and adherence of the composition to the hard surface to be cleaned. Structuring agents which include polysaccharides such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and other chemically modified cellulose materials may also be used in the detergent bar of the invention.<br>
The pH of the detergent bar of the invention should not exceed 11.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with respect to the following non-limiting examples.<br><br>
Examples: Example 1<br>
Process for making the bar according to the invention:<br>
A batch of 20 kg was processed by conventional bar processing technology. The composition of the formulation is as described in Table 1. The ingredients were mixed in a Sigma mixer and plodded into bars using conventional technology. The extruded material was billeted and stamped. The bar 1 and bar 2 refers to a composition which is according to the invention where the reserve alkalinity is 5.0 and 8.5 respectively. In bar 3 where the reserve alkalinity is maintained 3.0, which is much lower than what is claimed in the present invention, by using aluminium sulphate at higher levels and the same is adjusted by reducing the abrasive level correspondingly.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Composition %wt.	Bar 1	Bar 2	Bar 3<br>
LAS	17	17	17<br>
Soda	8	16	8<br>
China clay	8	8	8<br>
Aluminium sulphate	0.75	0.75	2.5<br>
Alkaline silicate	3	3	3<br>
STPP	1	1	1<br>
Dolomite	55	47	53<br>
Water	To 100	To 100	to 100<br>
Reserve alkalinity	5.0	8.5	3.0<br>
The performance of bars 1 to 3 were compared and the results are presented in Table 2. Attributes studied were grease removal, removal of burnt milk, foam volume and foam stability to soil.<br><br><br>
Grease removal refers to cleaning performance of a fixed, equivalent amount of product on steel plates. Higher number of steel plates refers to better cleaning.<br>
For burnt milk removal, soiled plates (containing 5 ml of charred milk) were washed in a scrubbing machine. Rating of 1 to 10 done by a panel of three members (for two plates). A percentage value was assigned based on the result.<br><br>
Attributes	Bar 1	Bar 2	Bar 3<br>
Grease removal (number of plates cleaned)	22	24	16<br>
Removal of burnt milk (% removal)	60	64	55<br>
Foam volume	1650	2000	1000<br>
The date in Table 2 show that the bars of the invention (bar 1 and 2) shows superior cleaning performance as compared to a formulation that is beyond the invention. The bars of the invention also show superior shine as compared to the control bar. Less residue was observed visually after cleaning for the bars of the invention (as determined by an internal panel of three members). The colour of the bars was also seen to be superior to the control bar. The bars of the invention also shows superior economy of use and is longer lasting.<br><br>
