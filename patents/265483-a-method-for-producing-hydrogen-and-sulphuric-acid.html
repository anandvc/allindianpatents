				<td>A METHOD FOR PRODUCING HYDROGEN AND SULPHURIC ACID<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing simultaneously<br>
hydrogen and strong sulphuric acid from a sulphur bearing feedstock.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The growth of global demand of energy, and the necessity to master<br>
greenhouse emissions, may lead to the introduction of a new and universal<br>
energy carrier, hydrogen. Today most of energy production comes from<br>
hydrocarbons: oil (18 %), coal (30 %) and natural gas (48 %), and only about<br>
4 % comes from water by electrolysis. In a long term the prospected lack of<br>
fossil resources leaves only water and maybe renewable biomass as the<br>
sustainable candidate for hydrogen production.<br>
Research on thermochemical water-splitting cycles began about 40 years<br>
ago, and since that time hundreds of technical articles about them have been<br>
published. More than 200 thermochemical cycles have been reported, and a<br>
number of them have been evaluated quantitatively by computer model<br>
simulations. A search program, which uses only the free energies of<br>
formation has been developed to find new thermochemical cycles.<br>
One of the major efforts in the development of these cycles was done at the<br>
Joint Research Centre at Ispra (Varese, Italy). The program was approved<br>
by the Council of Ministers of the European Communities and covered the<br>
period 1973-1983. In another ten-year program in the USA (Gas Research<br>
Institute), a very simplified evaluation of 200 distinct thermochemical cycles<br>
was made, and finally eight cycles were operated successfully with recycled<br>
materials to achieve proof-to-principle.<br><br>
The most promising way to produce hydrogen without producing CO2 is<br>
splitting water by high temperature energy from the sun, nuclear sources, or<br>
waste heat in thermochemical cycles. There water is decomposed into<br>
hydrogen and oxygen via a chemistry using intermediate substances, which<br>
are cycled, and the energy needed is introduced as heat. About 100<br>
thermochemical cycles have been found. Four of them were assessed for<br>
further development: first the hybrid sulphur cycle - the Westinghouse<br>
cycle', and then its three close challengers, the /spra Mark 13 hybrid cycle,<br>
the UT-3 cycle, and the sulphur-iodine (S-/) cycle.<br>
Except for the UT-3 cycle, the main reaction in the most promising<br>
thermochemical processes is the decomposition of sulphuric acid (1), which<br>
is endothermic and takes place at high temperature.<br><br>
This reaction is complemented by other reactions, which then close the<br>
thermochemical cycle in its variants as:<br>
Westinghouse Electric Corporation pursued the development of a closure,<br>
which is called a hybrid sulphur cycle (HyS process) because one of the<br>
reactions (2) is electrochemical.<br><br>
The hybrid sulphur cycle is described for example in US patent 4412895.<br>
Generals Atomics pursued the development of a sulphur-iodine cycle, and<br>
determined the conditions under which the products of the Bunsen reaction<br>
of water, iodine and sulphur dioxide form two phases, one rich in HI and the<br>
other rich in H2SO4. The cycle, consisting of the Bunsen reaction (3) and the<br>
decomposition reaction (4), is also known today as the "GA process". The<br>
process is described for example in US patent 4,089,940.<br><br><br>
The Ispra Mark 13 is a hybrid cycle and a complete bench-scale continuous<br>
process was built and operated at Ispra. The reactions in this closure are:<br><br>
The UT-3 process, being invented at the University of Tokyo in the 1970s,<br>
and selected by JAERI (Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, Ibaraki,<br>
Japan) for a further development, consists of four gas-solid reactions: two<br>
Ca-compounds reactions (7), (8) and two Fe-compounds reactions (9), (10).<br>
This process is operated in a cyclic manner in which the solids remain in<br>
their reaction vessels and the flow of gases is switched when the desired<br>
extent of reaction is reached.<br><br>
From the four thermochemical cycles above, the Ispra Mark 13 cycle has not<br>
been studied anymore in the recent years, and the same concerns the<br>
adiabatic UT-3 cycle, which is no longer the focus of JAERI's investigations<br>
in this area, either. So, recently the S-l and HyS cycles are favoured in the<br>
world in comparison with other known thermochemical cycles studied over<br>
the last 35 years.<br>
The most energy demanding part of the thermochemical cycles is the<br>
splitting of which forms during the cycle. The<br>
original invention, as well as further developments of the S-l cycle, suggest<br><br>
the application of nuclear energy as the primary heat source, and this is the<br>
case concerning the HyS process, too.<br>
Efficiencies (thermal to hydrogen) in the range of η = 47-56 % have been<br>
calculated for the full process of the sulphur-iodine cycle, and it has been<br>
shown that thermochemical cycles have potential to deliver overall system<br>
efficiencies in excess of 40 %. This is much lower than the efficiency an<br>
electrolysis producing hydrogen by water splitting. The efficiency of electric<br>
power conversion (electricity to hydrogen) is currently about 80 %.<br>
The sulphur-iodine (S-l) cycle can be split into the following reactions (11)-<br>
(17), in which the temperatures between brackets are approximate and<br>
depend upon the pressure which is not necessarily uniform in the different<br>
parts of the cycle. The practical stoichiometrics are:<br><br>
Reaction (11), named the Bunsen reaction, forms the first section. It<br>
proceeds exothermically in the liquid phase and produces two immiscible<br><br>
aqueous acid phases whose compositions are indicated between brackets:<br>
L1 phase which is aqueous sulphuric acid and L2 phase, named Hlx, which is<br>
a mixture of hydrogen iodide, iodine and water. The Bunsen reaction, as it<br>
has been written in (11), involves an excess of both water and iodine, with<br>
the reference to stoichiometric amounts. The excess of water is required to<br>
make the reaction spontaneous, and the excess of iodine induces the phase<br>
separation, which is a key point of the process. Such excesses, however, are<br>
quite unfavourable for the following Hlx section as well as for the energy<br>
balance.<br>
Reactions (14)-(17) belong to the second section. Reactions (15)-(17)<br>
proceed in the gas phase and produce H2O, SO2 and O2. These gases are<br>
cooled down prior to being bubbled in the Bunsen reactor for separating<br>
oxygen from SO2 and H2O. Alternatively, oxygen can be separated from the<br>
gas before it enters the Bunsen reactor. HI decomposition according to (13)<br>
must be achieved from the Hlx mixture produced in the previous Bunsen<br>
reaction. This acid section appears to be the best known step of the cycle,<br>
because of the experience gained in the sulphuric acid industry. Sulphuric<br>
acid is concentrated through a series of flashes starting from low pressure. It<br>
is then dehydrated, before SO3 is decomposed into SO2. This decomposition<br>
being only partial, undecomposed SO3 is recombined with water, which<br>
allows to recover its heat content.<br>
The third section is formed by reactions (12) and (13). In reaction (12), HI is<br>
separated from L2. This separation is the most critical stage of the cycle.<br>
Reaction (13) is the thermal decomposition of HI. It has also been proposed<br>
to perform reactions (12) and (13) in the same reactive distillation column.<br>
The hybrid sulphur process (HyS, the Westinghouse process) is an all-fluids,<br>
two-step thermochemical cycle, involving hydrogen production<br><br>
electrolytically, and decomposition of sulphuric acid as another process step.<br>
The net result of the two reactions is the decomposition of water into its<br>
constituents, hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
The system has three main processing units:<br>
-	a SO2 depolarized electrolysis tank for producing gaseous hydrogen and a<br>
water-sulphuric acid mixture,<br>
-	a sulphuric acid concentration and decomposition step, and<br>
-	separation of O2 from SO2 before introducing SO2 back into the electrolysis<br>
tank.<br>
The first step of the HyS process involves hydrogen production in an<br>
electrochemical cell by reaction (18). Sulphur dioxide is oxidized on the<br>
anode of an electrochemical cell, while protons are reduced on the cathode<br>
to produce hydrogen. The electrolyte used in the cell is sulphuric acid, and<br>
sulphur dioxide is used to scavenge the anode.<br><br>
The theoretical equilibrium voltage required to decompose water under<br>
standard conditions (25°C, infinite dilution) is E° H2/H20 = 1.23 V, and the<br>
commercial direct water electrolyzers, which have to deal with system<br>
efficiency and overvoltage, operate with 1.8-2.6 V per cell. The presence of<br>
sulphur dioxide depolarizes the anode and reduces the reversible voltage<br>
relative to that required for the direct dissosiation of water.<br>
The acid decomposition step involves multiple process operations, including<br>
preheating, acid concentration, acid vaporization, acid dissociation, and<br>
sulphur trioxide decomposition as is presented earlier by reactions (15)-(17).<br>
This process step is common to all sulphur-based thermochemical cycles, so<br><br>
the results obtained in the development of this section of the sulphur-iodine<br>
process can be directly applied to the HyS cycle, too.<br>
After the sulphuric acid decomposition unit, the oxygen thermally<br>
decomposed from SO3 is removed from the stream. The separated sulphur<br>
dioxide is recycled to the electrolysis tank, and oxygen is either used in some<br>
other process or vented.<br>
The original thermochemical cycles described above have been developed<br>
with the application of nuclear energy in mind and the application of SO2<br>
without recycling and decomposition of sulphuric acid has not been<br>
discussed in this connection.<br>
In the prior art there is also described in JP 2005219033 a method, which<br>
removes sulphur oxide from a gas and utilizes it for hydrogen and sulphuric<br>
acid production. Sulphur-oxide containing gas is discharged from a furnace<br>
such as a coal/oil burning boiler, metal refining furnace and sulphur furnace.<br>
Sulphur oxide containing gas is contacted with bromine and water, which<br>
results forming of sulphuric acid and a gas containing hydrogen bromide<br>
(HBr) and water. Iron bromide (FeBr2) and water are reacted to form ferric<br>
oxide (Fe3O4) hydrogen bromide and hydrogen. Ferric oxide and hydrogen<br>
bromide are reacted to generate bromine and iron bromide. Bromine is used<br>
to contact sulphur oxide gas and iron bromide to form hydrogen. The method<br>
seems to be a modification of the UT-3 process.<br>
JP 8071365 relates to a method to use an oxidation/reduction system in the<br>
desulphurization of sulphur oxide containing exhaust gas for obtaining<br>
sulphuric acid and hydrogen as byproducts. Exhaust gas is contacted with a<br>
sulphur dioxide absorbing solution containing dissolved iodine in water. The<br>
solution forms two layers the light phase containing sulphuric acid and the<br>
heavy phase hydrogen iodide. Hydrogen iodide is electrolyzed to produce<br>
hydrogen and iodine. Separated iodine is reused for absorbing sulphur<br><br>
dioxide gas. The light phase containing sulphuric acid is concentrated. The<br>
method is a modification of SI process without sulphuric acid decomposition.<br>
Both cited Japanese methods produce sulphuric acid in addition to hydrogen.<br>
However, each mole of sulphuric acid in the light phase  is<br>
initially accompanied with 5 moles of water, which means that the acid is<br>
dilute acid, which is not a commercial product. There is said in JP 8071365<br>
that the sulphuric acid will be concentrated but not said how it takes place.<br>
As is known, concentration by water evaporation does not succeed above 60<br>
mol-% (≈ 90 wt%) and for a commercial product (100 wt%) the acid has to be<br>
concentrated in a sulphuric acid plant. So the sulphuric acid production with<br>
said method is not possible without connection to sulphuric acid plant.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The function of the present invention is to avoid recycling and decomposition<br>
of sulphuric acid in the production of hydrogen. Instead of decomposing<br>
sulphuric acid, the invention relates to a method in which sulphur dioxide gas<br>
is used for producing hydrogen simultaneously with concentrated sulphuric<br>
acid (93 - 100 wt%) or oleum (sulphuric acid with free SO3). Dependency of<br>
any sulphuric acid plant can be avoided by dividing the sulphur dioxide gas<br>
stream to two sub-streams wherein the first sub-stream is routed for the<br>
production of hydrogen and sulphuric acid and the second sub-stream to<br>
produce sulphur trioxide, which is used for concentrating the sulphuric acid to<br>
strong sulphuric acid (preferably 97 -100 wt%).<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The essential features of the invention are characterized in the claims.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing gaseous hydrogen<br>
and strong sulphuric acid simultaneously from sulphur dioxide gas and water.<br>
Sulphur dioxide gas stream is divided into two separate sub-streams, the first<br>
sub-stream is routed for water decomposition in a partial thermochemical<br><br>
cycle of the hydrogen and sulphuric acid production and the second sub-<br>
stream is fed to the oxidation of the sulphur dioxide to sulphur trioxide.<br>
The partial thermochemical cycle here refers to a cycle without its high<br>
temperature step of sulphuric acid decomposition.<br>
The sulphuric acid formed in the partial thermochemical cycle is first<br>
concentrated by evaporation. The final concentration to strong sulphuric acid<br>
(97- 100 wt%) takes place with the Sulphur trioxide formed in the oxidation of<br>
the second sub-stream of the sulphur dioxide. The amount of the sulphur<br>
dioxide routed to the first sub-stream is in at least 40 % of the total amount.<br>
The quantity of the second stream depends on the strength or concentration<br>
degree of the sulphuric acid from the evaporation step.<br>
The source of sulphur dioxide may be any technically feasible feedstock,<br>
such as elementary sulphur or hydrogen sulphide, which are converted to<br>
sulphur dioxide. The oxidant is preferably oxygen. The source may also be<br>
sulphur dioxide, either as a result of sulphur combustion or as a by-product<br>
of a sulphide smelter or roaster, or a SO2-enrichment step of an industrial<br>
process gas cleaning plant. Also any other sulphur source, which can be<br>
converted to SO2, may be used as feedstock of the method. The sulphide is<br>
preferably at least one of the group: copper, nickel, zinc, lead or iron<br>
sulphide.<br>
The partial thermochemical cycle utilized in the present method may be any<br>
of the possible processes using sulphur as a constituent and sulphuric acid<br>
as an intermediate product, such as the sulphur-iodine cycle or hybride<br>
sulphur cycle.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main disadvantage in the prior art methods has been the big energy<br>
requirement of the sulphuric acid decomposition since it consumes roughly<br>
over 60 % of the heat energy of the hydrogen production and only minor than<br>
40% is consumed in the decomposition of water. The methods described in<br>
the cited Japanese patent publications avoid sulphuric acid decomposition<br>
but however the production according to them must take place in connection<br>
of a sulphuric acid plant since the sulphuric acid produced is not commercial<br>
product as such.<br>
The invention according to the present method reveals a new possibility to<br>
produce independently and cost-effectively both hydrogen and strong<br>
sulphuric acid (100%). In practice the acid content of the strong sulphuric<br>
acid is between 97-100 wt% though it is mentioned in the specification to<br>
be 100 wt%. It is also possible to produce oleum with the present method.<br>
Some preferable process alternatives have been described in the light of the<br>
flowsheets. Elementary sulphur has been used as a feedstock of sulphur<br>
dioxide in Figure 1. However, also hydrogen sulphide can be used as a<br>
source of sulphur. Sulphur is converted to sulphur dioxide by combusting it<br>
with oxygen in a sulphur furnace 1. The figures describing the process have<br>
been simplified and they do not reveal all details. It is however preferential<br>
that the formed sulphur dioxide gas is cleaned from solids before dividing to<br>
two separate streams.<br>
The first substream of the created sulphur dioxide and possibly a small<br>
amount of oxygen, which has been used in excess, is routed to a Hydrogen<br><br>
line and there to a combining and mixing reactor 2 where water is fed and a<br>
recycled composition of hydrogen iodide, elementary iodine and water. The<br>
amount of the first sub-stream is at least 40 % of the total sulphur dioxide<br>
stream.<br>
The mixed composition of sulphur dioxide, water and iodine with its<br>
compounds is directed to a so-called Bunsen reactor 3. The Bunsen reaction<br>
(11) operates with excess water and also with excess iodine to allow the<br>
separation of reaction products H2SO4 and HI in the form of two immiscible<br>
liquid phases (H2SO4/H2O and Hl/I2/H2O). The reaction temperature is about<br>
120°C. Separation of the two phases takes place in a settler 4. The heavy<br>
phase containing hydrogen iodide, iodine and water is routed to a separation<br>
and decomposition stage 5. The light phase consisting of dilute sulphuric<br>
acid and water is directed to an evaporation stage 6.<br>
Each mole of sulphuric acid in the light phase (H2SO4/H2O) is initially<br>
accompanied by an excess of water, typically 4-5 moles. The remaining acid<br>
(20 mol% = 57 wt%) is concentrated to commercial grades. The first part of<br>
the concentration takes place in the evaporation stage 6. This is done to at<br>
least 40 mol% (≈78 wt%) and preferably at least 60 mol% (≈ 90 wt%) in a<br>
series of e.g. five flash evaporators (four heated flashes at 7.5 bar and one<br>
adiabatic flash to 3 bar), and then the acid passes through a 1 atm vaporizer<br>
to the absorption towers of the acid plant. Pure water is removed in the<br>
overhead of the flashes and this is returned to the Bunsen reactor 3. Low<br>
pressure steam from acid cooling in the absorption unit is applied in the acid<br>
concentration section (flash evaporators). Higher acid concentrations require<br>
high pressure steam which is gained from the sulphur combustion.<br>
In the combustion of liquid elementary sulphur to generate SO2, pure oxygen<br>
(technical grade oxygen = 90-100% O2) is preferably used. This allows a<br><br>
greater efficiency of the Bunsen reactor, and it also enables the recirculation<br>
of unconverted SO2 and oxygen back into the sulphur combustion furnace.<br>
The second sub-stream of the sulphur dioxide formed in the sulphur furnace<br>
1 is directed to a Sulphuric acid line and further to sulphur trioxide conversion<br>
stage 7. It is advantageous to use pure oxygen under pressure for the SO2 to<br>
SO3 conversion in the sulphuric acid line. The adaption of this kind of an<br>
absorption technology is necessary because the low concentrated acid from<br>
the S-l stage would inevitably lead to strong mist formation.<br>
To avoid the mist formation, the diluted sulphuric acid from the evaporation<br>
(6) can be used as a substitute for the conventional make-up water for the<br>
sulphuric acid which come from the absorption stage (8) of the second sub-<br>
stream. In this case, the SO3 is absorbed in concentrated sulphuric acid as in<br>
conventional plants and this higher concentrated acid is mixed with the<br>
diluted acid from the evaporator to get the desired concentration.<br>
At least half % of the generated SO2 goes into the S-l section to produce<br>
acid at a strength of at least 78 wt%. The remaining part, the second sub-<br>
stream goes directly to the conversion stage, and is converted into SO3. The<br>
created sulphur trioxide is absorbed to the sulphuric acid cycled from the<br>
evaporation stage 6 in an absorption stage 8. In the absorption stage the<br>
content of the sulphuric acid is raised to the level of 97 - 100 wt%. As was<br>
said before, the ratio in which the SO2 is routed to each line depends totally<br>
on the efficiency of the evaporation stage. But it is also possible to control<br>
the concentration of the sulphuric acid by the distribution of the SO2 gas to<br>
the sub-streams or compensate lacking efficiency of the evaporation state<br>
with other distribution of SO2 into the sub-streams.<br><br>
The pressure contact in the conversion stage 7 is planned to use the inline<br>
technology concept, in which the individual process steps are carried out in<br>
tubes and pipes rather than in individual vessels. However, the capital cost<br>
of the modified acid plant corresponds the cost of a conventional acid plant.<br>
The production costs are competitive with the prior art.<br>
Fgure 2 shows a flowsheet, in which the sulphur bearing feedstock is a<br>
copper sulphide concentrate, which is combusted in a flash furnace 9 by<br>
means of oxygen containing gas to copper matte and sulphur dioxide gas. It<br>
is clear that the sulphide can also be another sulphide or roaster can be used<br>
instead of smelter. The created sulphur dioxide gas is divided to two sub-<br>
streams and treated in the same way as described in the connection with<br>
Figure 1.<br>
The sulphur bearing feedstock is also in the flowsheet of Figure 3 a copper<br>
sulphide concentrate, which is combusted in a flash furnace 9 and the<br>
created sulphur dioxide gas is divided to two sub-streams as explained<br>
before but the production of hydrogen from the SO2 includes decomposing of<br>
water electrolytically in an electrolyzer 10. The hydrogen is so produced by<br>
using partial HyS cycle. In addition to hydrogen, sulphuric acid is formed, too,<br>
and it is routed to evaporation stage 6 and treated as described in the<br>
connection of Figure 1.<br>
It is clear that the partial HyS line can also be used when the source of the<br>
sulphur dioxide is elementary sulphur as described in Figure 1 or any other<br>
possible source mentioned before.<br><br>
