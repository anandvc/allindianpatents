The following example describes the present invention in more detail. All parts and percentages are given by weight unless indicated otherwise.<br>
Structural formulae of compounds used in the following examples:<br><br>
Compound (11-1):<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 1;<br>
Powdery propylene-ethylene copolymer (PP raco) with a melt flow index of 12 dg/min (measured at 230°C and 2.16 kg) is mixed with calcium stearate, IRGANOX B 215 (RTM) (=tris[2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl] phosphite and pentaerythrityl tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate] in a weight ratio of 2:1), Compound (I-2), Fischer-Tropsch wax (AdSperse 868 (RTM)) and Compound (11-1) in a Henschel mixer. Then, the formulations are compounded twice on a Berstorff ZE 25x46D (RTM) at 250°C. The granules obtained after compounding are used for injection molding on Arburg 320 S (RTM) at 240°C to produce 1 mm plaques. Haze, clarity and transmittance of the plaques are measured on a Haze-Gard plus (BYK Gardner (RTM)) according ASTM D1003 and the yellowness Index is measured on a datacolor machine according ASTM D1925.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2:<br>
A powdery mixture of 100 parts of compound (I-2), 20 parts of compound (11-1) and 11 parts of compound (IIM) is agitated in a ball mill operated at 180 - 220 rpm under ambient conditions for 3 hours. The appearance of the resulting product as white powder differs from the originating powdery mixture by the significantly increased bulk density, better flow and feeding behavior as well as the reduced extend of dusting, bridging and agglomeration. Furthermore, its microscopic homogeneity becomes apparent in optical micrographs and, particularly, by SEM (scanning electron microscope) investigations clearly illustrating the coating effect of the compound (111-1) used.<br>
After incorporation into polypropylene by the usual means commonly known and practiced in the art (powder blending of the aforementioned composition with polypropylene fluff followed by compounding at 230°C and subsequent injection molding into 1 mm plaques), finished articles are obtained with excellent clarity (i.e. low haze) without any specks or white bits, high gloss and stiffness and free from bubbles and malodorants, which had been associated before with the use of clarifiers of the sorbitol type (compounds of the formula (I)).<br>
Since it is obvious for those skilled in the art to vary the experimental procedure given above, this example exhibits just ONE possibility to practice the inventive compositions; but it is not intended herewith to limit in any way the scope of the invention. For example, alternative methods to apply coatings on the primary or agglomerated particles of sorbitol based clarifiers are well known in principal from the prior art; e.g. from EP-A-522,558 or EP-A-651,007 or EP-A-962,459, where polar or unpolar solvents are used to dissolve or disperse the binding agent therein and to uniformly coat the clarifier particles subsequently. Also the teachings of DE-A-3,219,298 or EP-A-964,029, where high-speed/high-shear mixing and extrusion techniques, respectively, are recommended to produce the desired coated clarifier particles, are suited to practice the current invention. Such methods and further variations thereof can be applied on the scope of the inventive formulations and are incorporated herewith by reference.Claims:<br>
