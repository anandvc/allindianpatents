"COMPOSITION FOR MINERALIZATION OF PURIFIED WATER"<br>
DR. RAJESHKUMAR MOHANLAL PUROHIT<br>
Adult, An Indian National,<br>
having his address at, 4B, Rupal Park Society,<br>
Nr .ESI Hospital, Gotri Road,<br>
Vadodara-390 021, Gujarat State, INDIA<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to mineralization of demineralized or purified water used for drinking and cooking purpose. It particularly relates to a mineral water composition which when added in drinking and cooking water provides essential mineral ions to the body which are lost from water by various water purification techniques. The water on addition of the said mineral powder also serves as a health drink.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Water is the basic essentiality for human life. Water covers about 3/4th part of this planet, however only 2% of total water is available for drinking purpose. Man because of his various activities has deteriorated the quality of water by polluting it. Quantity of water is also reducing day-by-day due of global warming effect. Thus availability of pure water for drinking purpose is very essential.<br>
Various water purification techniques are employed for sterilization and disinfection of water. Demineralization is possible with various water purification processes like Reverse Osmosis (RO) technique, Deionization process and Distillation process. Deionization process removes salts of carbonates, bicarbonates and hydroxides of sodium and potassium responsible to provide alkaline nature to water. Along with removing the dissolved organic and inorganic impurities and pathogenic microorganisms from water these techniques also remove the minerals that are essential for our body. Thus the mineral ion content of the body is reduced. The purified water is slightly bitter in taste and acidic in nature. Moreover purified water is not wholesome and<br><br>
unable to satisfy thirst. Purified water contains very less quantity of total dissolved solids (TDS). Food material losses its natural taste on cooking with purified water and requires more energy in cooking process. Thus purified water alone is not recommended for drinking and cooking purpose.<br>
Loss of bicarbonate ions reduces the natural alkalinity of the water and reduces the pH of water. Thus water becomes acidic and reduces the satisfaction of palate. Loss of sodium and potassium ions affects the blood pressure and cardiovascular system. Loss of calcium and magnesium ions creates osteoporosis problems and affects the brain efficiency. Loss of various metallic ions affects the enzymatic reactions of the body resulting in reduction of the performance of the various organs of the body and gradually reduces the immunity power of the body. Loss of various mineral ions in water due to demineralization affects the health, hygiene, stamina and development of the body. Thus to avoid all these problems water used for drinking and cooking purpose should consist of the essential mineral ions in appropriate proportion. Thus it is essential that the mineral ions are consumed in regulated amount as per the requirements of the human body.<br>
Purified water i.e. water treated by various purification techniques like Reverse Osmosis (RO) technique, Deionization process and Distillation process if used for drinking and cooking purpose has various disadvantages which are as follows:<br>
•	It can cause gastric and digestives troubles.<br>
•	Jt can cause the problem of piles.<br>
•	It is bitter in taste.<br>
•	It causes disorders related to bone density such as osteoporosis due to the loss of calcium and magnesium.<br>
•	It causes disorders related to blood pressure due to the loss of sodium and potassium.<br>
3<br><br>
• It is acidic in nature and makes the gastric environment acidic and causes generation of gases. Thus causing acidity in stomach causing gastric troubles.<br>

ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED INVENTION<br>
The water mineralized with the mineral water powder of the proposed invention has various advantages as follows:<br>
•    It provides all the essential mineral ions and mineral salts to the water in their recommended daily allowance which are removed by various water<br><br>
purification     techniques     like     Reverse     Osmosis     (RO)     technique, Deionization process and Distillation process<br>
•	It gives relief from gastric trouble, indigestion and constipation on long term use.<br>
•	It increases digestion power.<br>
•	It gives relief against problem of piles on long-term use.<br>
•	It helps to maintain the normal blood pressure on long-term use.<br>
•	It protects against cardiac as well as bone density problems.<br>
•	It increases brain efficiency in small babies, children and young people.<br>
•	It is beneficial to athletes on long-term use as it provides the essential KUtt&amp;tals, to ths body,<br>
•	It gives pleasant taste like stream water.<br>
•	The water with the proposed mineral water powder when used for cooking purpose reduces the time and energy utilized for cooking.<br>
•	It is little alkaline in nature thus satisfies thirst. Improved alkalinity of water will react with the acids generated in the stomach, keeping control over the acidic environment and the generation of gases. These way gastric troubles will subside.<br>
•	Addition of mineral ions to the water encourages some enzymatic reactions for better performance of metabolic reactions in the body, giving freshness and energy for better work.<br>
•	The presence of calcium and magnesium ions in the mineral water powder helps prevent against osteoporosis.<br><br>
It restores the pH balance in the body. Alkaline water can neutralize the acidity of the body caused by stress, modern diet, air pollution, and many bottled waters. A higher pH in the body reduces the need for fat and cholesterol to protect the body from damaging acids. The presence of bicarbonates in the mineral powder helps to separate out all the components of the food materials resulting in complete digestion of food.<br>
The presence of magnesium ions in the mineral powder sustains the energy of intentional muscular cells and controls the absorption of water. It further smoothen the motion of stool stop the constipation problems. Moreover smooth stool prevents causing friction to the wall of the anus; this provides relief to people suffering with piles problems.<br>
Magnesium and possibly calcium present in the mineral powder are effective in reducing blood pressure in hypertensive individuals on long-term use.<br>
Mineral ions present in the mineral water powder catalyze various enzymatic reactions that reduce the precipitation of various proteins on the wall of the cardinal veins resulting in relief of some cardinal problems.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to propose a mineral powder composition for mineralization of demineralised water used for drinking and cooking purpose.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mineral water powder that easily dissolves in water. The said mineral powder of the present invention is to be added in water after the process of demineralization<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide drinking and cooking water with essential amount of total dissolved solids (TDS) required for the body.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide drinking and cooking water that is little alkaline in nature having appropriate pH value.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide drinking and cooking water with increased hardness.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a novel composition for mineralization of purified water used for drinking and cooking which has lost the essential mineral ions by various water purification techniques such as Reverse Osmosis (RO) technique, Deionization process, Distillation process and alike. The loss of essential mineral ions from the drinking water causes mineral ions deficiency in the body. Thus a need arises to provide purified water having the essential mineral ions content.<br>
The mineral powder of the proposed invention has the following mineral ions in its composition:<br>
1)	Bicarbonate ions (HCO--)	about (42-50 %)<br>
2)	Gluconate ions (Ghr)	about (15-20 %)<br>
3)	Potassium ions (K+)	about (14-16 %)<br>
4)	Sodium ions (Na+)	about (10-13 %)<br>
5)	Calcium ions (Ca++)	about (0.7-1.2 %)<br><br>
6)	Citrate ions (Citrate-)	about (0.5-1.0 %)<br>
7)	Magnesium ions (Mg++)	about (0.3-0.9 %)<br>
8)	Chloride ions (CI)	about(0.2-0.5 %)<br>
The optimal formulation lies within the mid range of the limits stated above,<br>
The mineral powder of the proposed invention consists of the above mentioned mineral ions in association with its water soluble salts; the composition of the mineral salts in the mineral powder is as follows:<br>
1)	Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCOs)	about (35 - 40%)<br>
2)	Potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3)	about (30 - 35 %)<br>
3)	Calcium Gluconate(Ca-glu2)	about (8 - 12 %)<br>
4)	Magnesium Gluconate (Mg-glu2)	about (2-5%)<br>
5)	Potassium chloride (KC1)	about (2 - 5 %)<br>
6)	Magnesium Chloride (MgCh)	about (0.5 - 0.8 %)<br>
7)	Sodium chloride (NaCl)	about (0.1 - 0.5 %)<br>
8)	Sodium citrate (Na-Citrate)	about (0.1 - 0.3 %)<br>
9)	Citric acid	about(0.1 - 0.3 %)<br>
The optimal formulation lies within the mid range of the limits stated above.<br>
The addition of the mineral powder into purified water increases the pH of water making water little alkaline. The total hardness of water increases after the addition of mineral water powder to purified water. The amount of total dissolved solids (TDS) increases in water when mineral water powder is added to it because the acidity in the water reacts with bicarbonates and hydroxides in the water. The water with the added mineral water powder is able to satisfy<br><br>
the palate and imparts natural taste to purified water. The water after addition of the mineral water powder is found to be fit for potable use.<br>
The mineral salts and mineral ions used in the mineral water powder composition are sieved properly and of high purity pharmaceutical grade. The granule size ranges from 75 nm to 300 nm.<br>
