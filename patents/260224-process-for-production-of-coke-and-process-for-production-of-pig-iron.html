DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to techniques for production of coke using<br>
reformed coking coal, and a technique for production of pig iron using the techniques.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
As coking coal for producing coke for blast furnaces, blended coal of high<br>
quality strongly coking coal and low quality weakly coking coal or noncaking coal<br>
have been used. By blending the high quality strongly coking coal, the strength of the<br>
resulting coke can be improved and gas permeability at the time of operation in a blast<br>
furnace can be secured. However, the high quality strongly coking coal has gradually<br>
been exhausting and a material cost of the coal has been increasing. Thus, techniques<br>
for reforming the low quality weakly coking coal and noncaking coal, which exist in a<br>
large amount, have been studied (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 51-<br>
107301, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 51-107302, Japanese Patent Laid-<br>
open Publication No. 7-53965, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 8-269459,<br>
and Toru Nishi et al., "Use of SRC as Coking Coal," The 72nd Preliminary<br>
Presentation Report of Coke Special Meeting, pp. 46-49 (1982)) (hereinafter, simply<br>
referred to as "The 72nd Preliminary Presentation Report of Coke Special Meeting").<br>
[0003]<br>
For example, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 51-107301 and<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 51-107302 disclose that a caking filler<br><br>
having 60 to 25% of a volatile component and a caking index of 90% or more, which<br>
is obtained by mixing dust coal and a solvent under normal pressure or increased<br>
pressure, or optionally heating the mixture in a hydrogen atmosphere to obtain a coal<br>
reformed product and treating the coal reformed product, is blended with weakly<br>
coking coal or noncaking coal. Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 7-53965<br>
and "The 72nd Preliminary Presentation Report of Coke Special Meeting" disclose a<br>
method in which brown coal and the like is mixed with a hydrogen donor solvent to<br>
obtain a slurry, the slurry is hydrogenated and liquefied at high temperature under high<br>
pressure using a catalyst, then finally purified SRC (solvent refined coal) is separated<br>
and extracted, and the obtained product is used as coking coal for coke.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]<br>
Under these circumstances, the present invention has been made and an<br>
object thereof is to provide techniques of enhancing the strength of resulting coke, and<br>
reducing the use amount of valuable strongly coking coal as the coke producing<br>
material when the coke has the strength of the same level and increasing the use<br>
amount of weakly coking coal or noncaking coal.<br>
[0005]<br>
A gist of the process for production of coke of the present invention lies in<br>
the use of coking coal comprising 100 parts by mass of blended coal containing coal<br>
having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 85% or more and 91% or less and coal having a<br>
carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and less than 85%, and 1 part by mass or less<br>
of substantially ash-free coal. Coal is commonly classified into anthracite, strongly<br>
coking coal, caking coal, weakly coking coal, noncaking coal, brown coal, peat and<br><br>
the like, but the definition is not necessarily clear. A portion of the coking coal may<br>
be sometimes referred to as caking coal. In the present invention, anthracite, strongly<br>
coking coal, caking coal, weakly coking coal, noncaking coal and the like are<br>
classified according to a carbon content (d. a. f.). For example, the anthracite is coal<br>
having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of more than 91%. The strongly coking coal is coal<br>
having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 85% or more and 91% or less. The caking coal is<br>
coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 83% or more and less than 85%. The weakly<br>
coking coal is coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 80% or more and less than<br>
83%. The noncaking coal is coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 78% or more<br>
and less than 80%. The brown coal is coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 70% or<br>
more and less than 78%. The peat is coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of less than<br>
70%. As used herein, the carbon content (d. a. f. = dry ash free) refers to a carbon<br>
content (% by mass) of organic components (C, H, O, S, N) excluding a moisture<br>
content and an ash content of coal, and can be measured in conformity with JIS<br>
M8819. In the following description, coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 85% or<br>
more and 91% or less may be sometimes simply referred to as "strongly coking coal",<br>
and coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and less than 85% may be<br>
sometimes simply referred to as "noncaking coal".<br>
[0006]<br>
In the present invention, when coking coal containing substantially ash-free<br>
coal in an amount within the above predetermined range to the blended coal is used,<br>
the strength of the resulting coke is improved. For example, it is preferred to use, as<br>
the substantially ash-free coal, a soluble component extracted from coal having a<br>
carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and less man 95% with an organic solvent(s).<br>
The organic solvent(s) is, for example, an organic solvent(s) containing a dicyclic<br><br>
aromatic compound(s) as a main component. The present invention includes a<br>
process for production of pig iron using coke obtained by the above process for<br>
production of coke.<br>
[0007]<br>
According to the present invention, coal obtained by reforming weakly<br>
coking coal or noncaking coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and<br>
less than 95% can be used as a substitute of a portion of strongly coking coal as a coke<br>
producing material, and thus the present invention can cope with problems such as<br>
exhaust of strongly coking coal and an increase in a material cost. Further, the<br>
resulting coke has excellent strength, and thus can be preferably used for producing<br>
pig iron in a blast furnace.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
[0008]<br>
Fig. 1 is an explanatory view showing an apparatus and a process for<br>
production of ash-free coal used in the present invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]<br>
The process for production of coke of the present invention comprises<br>
carbonizing coking coal comprising 100 parts by mass of blended coal containing coal<br>
having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 85% or more and 91% or less and coal having a<br>
carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and less than 85%, and 1 part by mass or less<br>
of substantially ash-free coal.<br>
[0010]<br><br>
First, substantially ash-free coal (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as<br>
"ash-free coal") used in the present invention will be described. The ash-free coal<br>
may be any substantially ash-free coal, but may contain a trace amount of ash. In this<br>
case, the ash content is preferably 5,000 ppm or less, and more preferably 2,000 ppm<br>
or less. In addition, the ash is an inorganic substance left when coal is converted into<br>
ash by heating at 815°C. For example, the ash includes silica, alumina, iron oxide,<br>
lime, magnesia and an alkali metal(s).<br>
[0011]<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred to use, as the ash-free coal, a soluble<br>
component(s) extracted from coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more<br>
and less than 95% (more preferably 60% or more and less than 85%) with an organic<br>
solvent(s). This is because the process is not influenced by a problem such as exhaust<br>
of strongly coking coal when noncaking coal and the like is used as a starting material.<br>
In the present invention, it is particularly preferred to use, as the coal to be extracted<br>
with an organic solvent(s), weakly coking coal, noncaking coal, brown coal or a<br>
mixture thereof having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 70% or more and less than 83%.<br>
[0012]<br>
More particularly, the ash-free coal can be obtained by mixing coal having a<br>
carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and less than 95% (more preferably 60% or<br>
more and less than 85%) with an organic solvent(s) to prepare a slurry, heating and<br>
aging the slurry, thereby extracting a soluble component(s) in the organic solvent(s),<br>
separating the resulting slurry into a overflow and a concentrated liquid in which a<br>
solid phase component(s) is concentrated, filtrating the overflow, and evaporating to<br>
remove the organic solvent(s). Fig. 1 is an explanatory view showing an apparatus<br>
and a process for production of ash-free coal. In a tank 1, a slurry is prepared by<br><br>
mixing coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and less than 95% with<br>
an organic solvent(s). The resulting slurry is supplied to an extraction vessel 4 which<br>
performs an extraction treatment using a pump 2. In this case, the slurry is heated to a<br>
predetermined temperature by a pre-heater 3. In the extraction vessel 4, a soluble<br>
component is extracted in the organic solvent(s) while stirring the slurry using a stirrer<br>
10, and the slurry is supplied to a gravity precipitation vessel 5. In the gravity<br>
precipitation vessel 5, gravity precipitation is carried out so as to precipitate (an arrow<br>
11) a solid phase component, and the slurry is separated into an overflow and a<br>
concentrated liquid in which the solid phase component is concentrated. The resulting<br>
overflow is supplied to a filter unit 8, and the solid phase component concentrated<br>
liquid precipitated in the gravity precipitation vessel 5 is recovered by a solid phase<br>
component concentrated liquid receiver 6. The overflow is filtered with a filter<br>
member 7 of the filter unit 8, and the resulting filtrate is recovered by an overflow<br>
receiver 9 for recovering an overflow. Then, ash-free coal can be obtained by<br>
evaporating to remove the organic solvent(s) from the recovered overflow. A method<br>
of evaporating to remove the organic solvent(s) from the overflow is, for example, a<br>
common drying method such as a spray dry method, an evaporating method or a<br>
vacuum drying method.<br>
[0013]<br>
A coal concentration in the slurry is properly 10 to 35% by mass. As for the<br>
conditions to heat and age the slurry so as to extract the soluble component(s) in the<br>
organic solvent(s), for example, the slurry is kept at 300°C to 420°C for 5 to 120<br>
minutes so as to solubilize the soluble component(s) in coal. When the temperature is<br>
lower than 300°C, it is insufficient to weaken the bond between molecules<br>
constituting coal, and the ratio of a soluble component(s) which can be extracted from<br><br>
coal decreases. In contrast, when the temperature is higher than 420°C, a thermal<br>
decomposition reaction of coal becomes active, and the generated thermally<br>
decomposed radical is re-bonded. Thus, the ratio of an extracted soluble component(s)<br>
decreases also in this case. On the other hand, when the temperature is within a range<br>
from 300 to 420°C, the bond between molecules constituting coal is loosened so as to<br>
generate mild thermal decomposition, and thus the ratio of a soluble component(s)<br>
extracted from coal increases. At this time, due to mild thermal decomposition of coal,<br>
a component(s) with abundant aromatic groups having an average boiling point<br>
(Tb50: 50% distillation temperature) of 200 to 300°C is mainly produced and can be<br>
effectively used as a portion of an organic solvent(s).<br>
[0014]<br>
The temperature at which the resulting slurry is separated into the overflow<br>
and the solid phase component(s) concentrated liquid by gravity precipitation is<br>
preferably 300°C or higher to 420°C or lower. When the temperature is lower than<br>
300°C, a portion of a component(s) dissolved in the liquid phase component(s) is<br>
precipitated, and thus the yield of ash-free coal may decrease.<br>
[0015]<br>
The organic solvent(s) is preferably a solvent(s) having a high dissolving<br>
power for coal, and is preferably an organic solvent(s) mainly containing a dicyclic<br>
aromatic compound(s) which is similar to a coal structure unit. Further, the organic<br>
solvent(s) preferably has a boiling point of 180°C to 330°C. When the boiling point is<br>
lower than 180°C, the recovery rate of the organic solvent(s) evaporated to remove<br>
from the overflow may decrease. On the other hand, when the boiling point is higher<br>
than 330°C, it is difficult to separate coal and the organic solvent(s), and thus the<br>
recovery rate of the organic solvent(s) may decrease. Specific examples of the<br><br>
dicyclic aromatic compound(s) include naphthalene (boiling point: 218°C);<br>
naphthalenes having an aliphatic side chain(s), such as methylnaphthalene (boiling<br>
point: 241 to 242°C), dimethylnaphthalene (boiling point: 261 to 272°C) and<br>
trimethylnaphthalene; biphenyl; biphenyls having an aliphatic side chain(s) or an<br>
aromatic substituent(s); or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0016]<br>
As coal (noncaking coal and the like) having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of<br>
60% or more and less than 95%, as a starting material for producing ash-free coal, for<br>
example, coal having the following properties is preferably used. A volatile content of<br>
the noncaking coal and the like is preferably 30% or more, more preferably 32% or<br>
more, and preferably 40% or less, more preferably 36% or less. An average<br>
reflectance of the noncaking coal and the like is preferably 0.6 or more, more<br>
preferably 0.8 or more, and preferably 1.0 or less, more preferably 0.9 or less. A total<br>
inert of the noncaking coal and the like is preferably 5% or more, more preferably<br>
15% or more, and preferably 35% or less, more preferably 20% or less. A Gieseler<br>
maximum fluidity (logMFD) of the noncaking coal and the like is preferably 3.0<br>
(logddpm) or more, more preferably 3.3 (logddpm) or more, and preferably 4.5<br>
(logddpm) or less, more preferably 3.6 (logddpm) or less. The volatile content is<br>
measured by a method defined in JIS M8812, the average reflectance is measured by a<br>
method defined in JIS M8816, and the Gieseler maximum fluidity (logMFD) is<br>
measured by a Gieseler plastometer method defined in JIS M8801. Further, the total<br>
inert (TI) can be calculated using the proportion of a semi-fusinite and the proportion<br>
of a fine composition component group (maceral group) among analyzed values of a<br>
coal fine composition component (maceral) in JIS M8816 by the following equation.<br>
[0017]<br><br><br>
In the equation, "MM" (mineral matter) denotes a mineral component, "A"<br>
denotes an ash content (dry basis, measured in conformity with JIS M8812), and "S"<br>
indicates a total sulfur content (dry basis, measured in conformity with JIS M8813).<br>
[0018]<br>
In a process for production of coke in the present invention, it is preferable to<br>
use coking coal containing 1 part by mass or less, preferably 0.7 parts by mass or less,<br>
and more preferably 0.5 parts by mass or less of ash-free coal based on 100 parts by<br>
mass of blended coal to be described later. The minimum content of the ash-free coal<br>
is not especially limited, but is preferably 0.2 parts by mass or more.<br>
[0019]<br>
By containing 0.2 parts by mass or more of ash-free coal, the strength of the<br>
resulting coke is substantially and significantly improved. Particularly, when the<br>
content of ash-free coal is 0.5 parts by mass, the strength of the resulting coke is the<br>
maximum value. On the other hand, when the content of ash-free coal is more than<br>
0.5 parts by mass and 1 part by mass or less, the coke strength is more excellent than<br>
in the case of not adding ash-free coal. However, when the content of ash-free coal<br>
increases more, the coke strength tends to further decrease. Further, when the content<br>
is more than 1 part by mass, the coke strength rather decreases as compared with the<br><br>
case of adding no ash-free coal.<br>
[0020]<br>
The blended coal used in the present invention, which contains coal having a<br>
carbon content (d. a. f.) of 85% or more and 91% or less and coal having a carbon<br>
content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and less than 85%, will now be described.<br>
[0021]<br>
The blended coal is not especially limited as long as the blended coal<br>
contains coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 85% or more and 91% or less and<br>
coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and less than 85%. The more<br>
preferable coal having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and less than 85% is<br>
weakly coking coal, noncaking coal or a mixture of these having a carbon content (d.<br>
a. f.) of 78% or more and less than 83%. A combination of coal having a carbon<br>
content (d. a. f.) of 85% or more and 91% or less and coal having a carbon content (d.<br>
a. f.) of 60% or more and less than 85% is, for example, a combination of strongly<br>
coking coal and weakly coking coal, a combination of strongly coking coal and<br>
noncaking coal, and a combination of strongly coking coal, weakly coking coal and<br>
noncaking coal.<br>
[0022]<br>
The coal (strongly coking coal) having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 85% or<br>
more and 91% or less in the blended coal is blended for increasing the coke strength to<br>
be obtained, and a blending amount is preferably 10 parts by mass or more, and more<br>
preferably 40 parts by mass or more with respect to 100 parts by mass of the whole<br>
blended coal. When the blending amount of strongly coking coal is less than 10 parts<br>
by mass, a caking component is too insufficient. Thus, even when 1 part by mass or<br>
less of ash-free coal is added to 100 parts by mass of blended coal, desired coke<br><br>
strength may not be obtained. On the other hand, the maximum of the blending<br>
amount of strongly coking coal is not especially limited, but is preferably 100 parts by<br>
mass, more preferably 90 parts by mass, and even more preferably 60 parts by mass.<br>
When the blending amount of strongly coking coal is too large, a raw material cost at<br>
the time of producing coke increases. On the other hand, the coal (noncaking coal and<br>
the like) having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and less than 85% is<br>
preferably blended so as to have a total blending amount of the coal and strongly<br>
coking coal to be 100 parts by mass.<br>
[0023]<br>
In the present invention, blended coal obtained by blending strongly coking<br>
coal and noncaking coal and the like preferably has the following properties. The<br>
volatile components of the blended coal is preferably 15% or more, more preferably<br>
26% or more, and preferably 35% or less, more preferably 29% or less. The average<br>
reflectance of the blended coal is preferably 0.65 or more, more preferably 1.00 or<br>
more, and preferably 1.60 or less, more preferably 1.10 or less. The total inert of the<br>
blended coal is preferably 15% or more, more preferably 20% or more, and preferably<br>
35% or less, more preferably 23% or less. The Gieseler maximum fluidity (logMFD)<br>
of the blended coal is preferably 0.7 (logddpm) or more, more preferably 2.0<br>
(logddpm) or more, and preferably 3.5 (logddpm) or less, more preferably 2.3<br>
(logddpm) or less. As for the particle size constitution of the blended coal, particles of<br>
3 mm or less are preferably 50% or more, more preferably 75% or more, and<br>
preferably 90% or less, more preferably 85% or less. The wide value range of the<br>
above each property is proper to use each coal as a raw material of cake for a blast<br>
furnace. When the value range of each property is narrower, coke substantially having<br>
no problem in strength can be obtained.<br><br>
[0024]<br>
A process for production of coke of the present invention comprises<br>
carbonizing coking coal comprising 100 parts by mass of blended coal containing coal<br>
having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 85% or more and 91% or less and coal having a<br>
carbon content (d. a. f.) of 60% or more and less than 85%, and 1 part by mass or less<br>
of substantially ash-free coal.<br>
[0025]<br>
The condition of carbonizing the coal is not especially limited, and a<br>
common carbonizing condition for producing coke using a coke furnace can be used.<br>
For example, the temperature is preferably 950°C or higher, more preferably 1,000°C<br>
or higher, and preferably 1,200°C or lower, more preferably 1,050°C or lower. The<br>

[0026]<br>
The present invention includes a process for production of pig iron, in which<br>
coke obtained by a process for production of coke of the present invention is used.<br>
Since coke obtained by the production process of the present invention has excellent<br>
strength, the coke can be suitably used for producing pig iron in a blast furnace. That<br>
is, when the coke obtained by the production process of the present invention is used,<br>
gas permeability at the time of producing pig iron in a blast furnace is improved. In<br>
addition, as the process for production of pig iron in a blast furnace, a publicly known<br>
process can be used. For example, the process includes the steps of alternately<br>
stacking iron ore and coke in a blast furnace so as to have a layer state, and blowing<br>
hot blast and dust coal if necessary into the blast furnace from a lower part of the blast<br>
furnace.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0027]<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail by way of examples.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited to these examples, and includes all<br>
modifications and embodiments within the range not separating from the objective of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0028]<br>
As shown in Table 1, coking coal was prepared by adding ash-free coal to<br>
blended coal. The ash-free coal was a soluble component (having an ash content of<br>
600 ppm) extracted from caking coal from Australia (having a carbon content (d. a. f.)<br>
of 84%) by using 1-methylnaphthalene. In addition, the ash-free coal was prepared<br>
using an apparatus of Fig. 1 by the following process. A slurry was prepared by<br>
mixing the caking coal from Australia (having a carbon content (d. a. f.) of 84%) and<br>
1-methylnaphthalene in a tank 1 (caking coal from Australia: 1-methylnaphthalene =<br>
20% by mass: 80% by mass). The resulting slurry was heated with a pre-heater 3 to<br>
370°C and a soluble component was extracted from the caking coal from Australia in<br>
an extraction vessel 4. The slurry subjected to an extraction treatment was supplied to<br>
a gravity precipitation vessel 5 at a flowing rate of 15 kg/h and then the slurry was<br>
separated into an overflow and a solid phase component concentrated liquid by gravity<br>
precipitation. Then, the overflow was supplied to a filter unit 8 at a flowing rate of 3<br>
kg/h, and the solid phase component concentrated liquid was discharged from a<br>
bottom part of the gravity precipitation vessel 5 to a solid phase component<br>
concentrated liquid receiver 6 at a flowing rate of 12 kg/h. The overflow was filtrated<br>
by the filter unit 8, and recovered by an overflow receiver 9. Then, an organic solvent<br><br>
was evaporated and removed from a recovered liquid by a spray drying method so as<br>
to obtain ash-free coal (having an ash content of 600 ppm).<br>
[0029]<br>
The coking coal was put into a can container having a width of 378 mm, a<br>
length of 121mm and a height of 114 mm so as to attain a desired density (720 kg/m3<br>
and 780 kg/m3). The four can containers were taken into a steel retort (size: 380 mm<br>
in width x 430 mm in length x 350 mm in height) while arranging the containers, and<br>
the retort was taken into a both-faces-heating-type electric furnace capable of heating<br>
the can containers in the width direction so as to carbonize the coking coal. The<br>
carbonizing was carried out at conditions of 1,000°C for 10 hours. Then, the retort<br>
was taken out from the electric furnace, and naturally cooled for about 16 hours.<br>
[0030]<br>
The four can containers were taken out from the cooled retort, and a piece of<br>
coke, which is at a portion apart 189 mm from the side edge of the carbonized coking<br>
coal, was cut. This length was equivalent to the half of the width direction. When<br>
both-faces-heating was carried out, a portion at the center of the width direction was<br>
referred to as a center of plastic layer, coke burned from a heated face to the center of<br>
plastic layer was referred to as a head, a body, and a tail from a portion close to the<br>
heated face in order. It is known that a difference of strength of the coal was<br>
generated by a difference of the heating rate at the time of heating the head, the body<br>
and the tail. Therefore, the coke cut at the 189 mm portion equivalent to the half of<br>
the width direction was divided into three portions at about 60 mm. The divided<br>
portions corresponded to the head, body, and tail portions. Then, an approximately<br>
rectangular parallelepiped body (one side: about 20 mm ± 1 mm) was cut out from<br>
each divided portion so as to obtain coke in which a particle size was regulated. The<br><br>
particle size-regulated coke was washed with distilled water so as to remove fine<br>
particles of coke adhered at the time of regulating a particle size (cutting out). Then,<br>
the coke was dried with a dryer at 150°C±2°C. The dried and particle size-regulated<br>
coke pieces were made into samples for measuring strength by selecting 12 pieces<br>
from the head portion, 12 pieces from the body portion, and 11 pieces from the tail<br>
portion when the bulk density of coking coal was 780 kg/m3, or by selecting 12 pieces<br>
from the head portion, 13 pieces from the body portion, and 11 pieces from the tail<br>
portion when the bulk density of coking coal was 720 kg/m3 to make the total amount<br>
200 g.<br>
[0031]<br>
An I-type strength was measured by using the resulting samples for<br>
measuring strength. An apparatus used for the I-type strengdi test was a cylindrical<br>
container made of a SUS material (length: 720 mm, bottom face diameter of the <br>
circle: 132 mm). 200 g of the samples were put in this container, rotated for 30<br>
minutes at the rotating rate of 20 times per one minute, and impact was given to the<br>
samples by 600 times of rotation movements in total. The cylinder was rotated by<br>
providing a rotary shaft at a portion apart 360 mm from the side, which was a center<br>
of the lengdi of the cylinder of 720 mm, and rotating the cylinder centering on the <br>
rotary shaft so mat the bottom face of the cylinder takes a circle movement having a<br>
diameter of 720 mm. After the samples were impacted by the specified rotation of<br>
600 times, the samples were taken out from the cylindrical container, and sieved by a<br>
sieve having openings of 9.5 mm. Then, the mass of the samples left on the sieve was<br>
measured. At this time, the samples caught on the sieve were regarded as the samples<br>
left on the sieve and the mass thereof was also measured. The I-type strengdi index<br>
was calculated by the following equation.The calculated results were shown in Table 1<br><br>
[0032]<br>
I-type strength index I6009.5 = Mass on sieve of 100 x 9.5 mm (unit: g)/200 g<br>
In addition, the rotational strength of coke is generally classified into the<br>
evaluation of volume destruction in which coke blocks are broken as large blocks, and<br>
the evaluation of surface destruction due to abrasion on the surface of coke. The I-<br>
type strength index I6009.5 used in the present invention was considered to be an index<br>
used for evaluating the surface destruction.<br><br><br><br>
As is apparent from the results of Table 1, when coke No. 1 to No.5 are<br>
compared with coke No. 8 to No. 10, the coke strength is improved by adding 1 part<br>
by mass or less of ash-free coal based on 100 parts by mass of blended coal.<br>
Particularly, the coke strength obtained in the case of adding ash-free coal in an<br>
amount of 0.5 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of blended coal showed the<br>
highest value. Further, as is apparent from the results of coke No. 6 and No. 7, the<br>
coke strength decreased on the contrary when the addition amount of ash-free coal<br>
was more than 1 part by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of blended coal.<br>
[0034]<br>
In the case of comparing the case where the bulk density of coking coal is<br>
780 kg/m (coke No. 1 and No. 3) with the case where the bulk density is 720 kg/m<br>
(coke No. 8 and No. 9), the coke strength improving effect in the case where the bulk<br>
density of coking coal is 720 kg/m3 is more improved than the case where the bulk<br>
density is 780 kg/m3.<br>
[0035]<br>
As for the coke No. 12, the ratio of strongly coking coal was lower than that<br>
of the coke No. 8, and the resulting coke strength decreased. However, when 0.5<br>
parts by mass of ash-free coal was added, the coke strength was improved (coke No.<br>
13).<br>
[0036]<br>
Further, when the coke No.9 is compared with the coke No. 11, it is found<br>
out that the strength improving effect by ash-free coal used in the present invention is<br>
higher than the strength improving effect of asphalt based pitch.<br>
