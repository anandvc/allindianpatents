Background of the Invention<br>
In many audio signal processing applications audio signals are<br>
compressed to reduce the processing power requirements when<br>
processing the audio signal. For example, in digital communication<br>
systems audio signal is typically captured as an analogue signal,<br>
digitised in an analogue to digital (A/D) converter and then encoded<br>
before transmission over a wireless air interface between a user<br>
equipment, such as a mobile station, and a base station. The purpose<br>
of the encoding is to compress the digitised signal and transmit it over<br>
the air interface with the minimum amount of data whilst maintaining an<br>
acceptable signal quality level. This is particularly important as radio<br>
channel capacity over the wireless air interface is limited in a cellular<br>
communication network. There are also applications in which digitised<br>
audio signal is stored to a storage medium for later reproduction of the<br>
audio signal.<br>
The compression can be lossy or lossless. In lossy compression some<br>
information is lost during the compression wherein it is not possible to<br>
fully reconstruct the original signal from the compressed signal. In<br>
lossless compression no information is normally lost. Hence, the<br>
original signal can usually be completely reconstructed from the<br>
compressed signal.<br>
The term audio signal is normally understood as a signal containing<br>
speech, music (non-speech) or both. The different nature of speech<br>
and music makes it rather difficult to design one compression algorithm<br>
which works enough well for both speech and music. Therefore, the<br>
problem is often solved by designing different algorithms for both audio<br>
and speech and use some kind of recognition method to recognise<br>
whether the audio signal is speech like or music like and select the<br>
appropriate algorithm according to the recognition.<br>
In overall, classifying purely between speech and music or non-speech<br>
signals is a difficult task. The required accuracy depends heavily on the<br>
application. In some applications the accuracy is more critical like in<br>
speech recognition or in accurate archiving for storage and retrieval<br>
purposes. However, the situation is a bit different if the classification is<br>
used for selecting optimal compression method for the input signal. In<br>
this case, it may happen that there does not exist one compression<br>
method that is always optimal for speech and another method that is<br>
always optimal for music or non-speech signals. In practise, it may be<br>
that a compression method for speech transients is also very efficient<br>
for music transients. It is also possible that a music compression for<br>
strong tonal components may be good for voiced speech segments.<br>
So, in these instances, methods for classifying just purely for speech<br>
and music do not create the most optimal algorithm to select the best<br>
compression method.<br>
Often speech can be considered as bandlimited to between<br>
approximately 200Hz and 3400 Hz. The typical sampling rate used by<br>
an A/D converter to convert an analogue speech signal into a digital<br>
signal is either 8kHz or 16kHz. Music or non-speech signals may<br>
contain frequency components well above the normal speech<br>
bandwidth. In some applications the audio system should be able to<br>
handle a frequency band between about 20 Hz to 20 000 kHz. The<br>
sample rate for that kind of signals should be at least 40 000 kHz to<br>
avoid aliasing. It should be noted here that the above mentioned values<br>
are just non-limiting examples. For example, in some systems the<br>
higher limit for music signals may be about 10 000 kHz or even less<br>
than that.<br>
The sampled digital signal is then encoded, usually on a frame by<br>
frame basis, resulting in a digital data stream with a bit rate that is<br>
determined by a codec used for encoding. The higher the bit rate, the<br>
more data is encoded, which results in a more accurate representation<br>
of the input frame. The encoded audio signal can then be decoded and<br>
passed through a digital to analogue (D/A) converter to reconstruct a<br>
signal which is as near the original signal as possible.<br>
An ideal codec will encode the audio signal with as few bits as possible<br>
thereby optimising channel capacity, while producing decoded audio<br>
signal that sounds as close to the original audio signal as possible. In<br>
practice there is usually a trade-off between the bit rate of the codec<br>
and the quality of the decoded audio.<br>
At present there are numerous different codecs, such as the adaptive<br>
multi-rate (AMR) codec and the adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMRWB)<br>
codec, which are developed for compressing and encoding audio<br>
signals. AMR was developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project<br>
(3GPP) for GSM/EDGE and WCDMA communication networks. In<br>
addition, it has also been envisaged that AMR will be used in packet<br>
switched networks. AMR is based on Algebraic Code Excited Linear<br>
Prediction (ACELP} coding. The AMR and AMR WB codecs consist of<br>
8 and 9 active bit rates respectively and aiso include voice activity<br>
detection (VAD) and discontinuous transmission (DTX) functionality. At<br>
the moment, the sampling rate in the AMR codec is 8 kHz and in the<br>
AMR WB codec the sampling rate is 16kHz. It is obvious that the<br>
codecs and sampling rates mentioned above are just non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>
ACELP coding operates using a model of how the signal source is<br>
generated, and extracts from the signal the parameters of the model<br>
More specifically, ACELP coding is based on a mode! of the human<br>
vocal system, where the throat and mouth are modelled as a linear<br>
filter and speech is generated by a periodic vibration of air exciting the<br>
filter. The speech is analysed on a frame by frame basis by the<br>
encoder and for each frame a set of parameters representing the<br>
modelled speech is generated and output by the encoder. The set of<br>
parameters may include excitation parameters and the coefficients for<br>
the filter as well as other parameters. The output from a speech<br>
encoder is often referred to as a parametric representation of the input<br>
speech signal. The set of parameters is then used by a suitably<br>
configured decoder to regenerate the input speech signal.<br>
For some input signals, the pulse-like ACELP-excitation produces<br>
higher quality and for some input signals transform coded excitation<br>
(TCX) is more optimal. !t is assumed here that ACELP-excitation is<br>
mostly used for typical speech content as an input signal and TCXexcitation<br>
is mostly used for typical music as an input signal. However,<br>
this is not always the case, i.e., sometimes speech signal has parts,<br>
which are music like and music signal has parts, which are speech like.<br>
The definition of speech like signal in this application is that most of the<br>
speech belongs to this category and some of the music may also<br>
belong to this category. For music like signals the definition is other<br>
way around. Additionally, there are some speech signal parts and<br>
music signal parts that are neutral in a sense that they can belong to<br>
the both classes.<br>
The selection of excitation can be done in several ways: the most<br>
complex and quite good method is to encode both ACELP and TCXexcitation<br>
and then select the best excitation based on the synthesised<br>
speech signal. This analysis-by-synthesis type of method will provide<br>
good results but it is in some applications not practical because of its<br>
high complexity. In this method for example SNR-type of algorithm can<br>
be used to measure the quality produced by both excitations. This<br>
method can be called as a "brute-force" method because it tries all the<br>
combinations of different excitations and selects afterwards the best<br>
one. The less complex method would perform the synthesis only once<br>
by analysing the signal properties beforehand and then selecting the<br>
best excitation. The method can also be a combination of pre-selection<br>
and "brute-force" to make compromised between quality and<br>
complexity.<br>
Figure 1 presents a simplified encoder 100 with prior-art high<br>
complexity classification. An audio signal is input to the input signal<br>
block 101 in which the signal is digitised and filtered. The input signal<br>
block 101 also forms frames from the digitised and filtered signal. The<br>
frames are input to a linear prediction coding (LPC) analysis block 102.<br>
It performs a LPC analysis on the digitised input signal on a frame by<br>
frame basis to find such a parameter set which matches best with the<br>
input signal. The determined parameters (LPC parameters) are<br>
quantized and output 109 from the encoder 100. The encoder 100 also<br>
generates two output signals with LPC synthesis blocks 103, 104. The<br>
first LPC synthesis block 103 uses a signal generated by the TCX<br>
excitation block 105 to synthesise the audio signal for finding the code<br>
vector producing the best result for the TCX excitation. The second<br>
LPC synthesis block 104 uses a signal generated by the ACELP<br>
excitation block 106 to synthesise the audio signal for finding the code<br>
vector producing the best result for the ACELP excitation. In the<br>
excitation selection block 107 the signals generated by the LPC<br>
synthesis blocks 103, 104 are compared to determine which one of the<br>
excitation methods gives the best (optimal) excitation. Information<br>
about the selected excitation method and parameters of the selected<br>
excitation signal are, for example, quantized and channel coded 108<br>
before outputting 109 the signals from the encoder 100 for<br>
transmission.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
One aim of the present invention is to provide an improved method for<br>
classifying speech like and music like signals utilising frequency<br>
information of the signal. There are music like speech signal segments<br>
and vice versa and there are signal segments in speech and in music<br>
that can belong to either class. In other words, the invention does not<br>
purely classify between speech and music. However, it defines means<br>
for categorize input signal into music like and speech like components<br>
according to some criteria. The classification information can be used<br>
e.g. in a multimode encoder for selecting an encoding mode.<br>
The invention is based on the idea that input signal is divided into<br>
several frequency bands and the relations between lower and higher<br>
frequency bands are analysed together with the energy level variations<br>
in those bands and the signal is classified into music like or speech like<br>
based on both of the calculated measurements or several different<br>
combinations of those measurements using different analysis windows<br>
and decision threshold values. This information can then be utilised for<br>
example in the selection of the compression method for the analysed<br>
signal.<br>
The encoder according to the present invention is primarily<br>
characterised in that the encoder further comprises a filter for dividing<br>
the frequency band into a plurality of sub bands each having a<br>
narrower bandwidth than said frequency band, and an excitation<br>
selection block for selecting one excitation block among said at least<br>
first excitation block and said second excitation block for performing the<br>
excitation for a frame of the audio signal on the basis of the properties<br>
of the audio signal at least at one of said sub bands.<br>
The device according to the present invention is primarily characterised<br>
in that said encoder comprises a filter for dividing the frequency band<br>
into a plurality of sub bands each having a narrower bandwidth than<br>
said frequency band, that the device also comprises an excitation<br>
selection block for selecting one excitation block among said at least<br>
first excitation block and said second excitation block for performing the<br>
excitation for a frame of the audio signal on the basis of the properties<br>
of the audio signal at least at one of said sub bands.<br>
The system according to the present invention is primarily<br>
characterised in that said encoder further comprises a filter for dividing<br>
the frequency band into a plurality of sub bands each having a<br>

comprises an excitation selection block for selecting one excitation<br>

The method according to the present invention is primarily<br>

band, that one excitation among said at least first excitation and said<br>
second excitation is selected for performing the excitation for a frame<br>
of the audio signal on the basis of the properties of the audio signal at<br>
least at one of said sub bands.<br>
The module according to the present invention is primarily<br>
characterised in that the module further comprises input for inputting<br>
information indicative of the frequency band divided into a plurality of<br>
sub bands each having a narrower bandwidth than said frequency<br>
band, and an excitation selection block for selecting one excitation<br>
block among said at least first excitation block and said second<br>
excitation block for performing the excitation for a frame of the audio<br>
signal on the basis of the properties of the audio signal at least at one<br>
of said sub bands.<br>
The computer program product according to the present invention is<br>
primarily characterised in that the computer program product further<br>
comprises machine executable steps for dividing the frequency band<br>
into a plurality of sub bands each having a narrower bandwidth than<br>
said frequency band, machine executable steps for selecting one<br>
excitation among said at least first excitation and said second<br>
excitation on the basis of the properties of the audio signal at least at<br>
one of said sub bands for performing the excitation for a frame of the<br>
audio signal.<br>
In this application, terms "speech like" and "music like" are defined to<br>
separate the invention from the typical speech and music<br>
classifications. Even if around 90% of the speech were categorized as<br>
speech like in a system according to the present invention, the rest of<br>
the speech signal may be defined as a music like signal, which may<br>
improve audio quality if the selection of the compression algorithm is<br>
based on this classification. Also typical music signals may fall in 80-90<br>
% of the cases into music like signals but classifying part of the music<br>
signal into speech like category will improve the quality of the sound<br>
signal for the compression system. Therefore, the present invention<br>
provides advantages when compared with prior art methods and<br>
systems. By using the classification method according to the present<br>
invention it is possible to improve reproduced sound quality without<br>
greatly affecting the compression efficiency.<br>
Compared to the brute-force approach presented above, the invention<br>
provides a much less complex pre-selection type approach to make<br>
selection between two excitation types. The invention divides input<br>
signal into frequency bands and analyses the relations between lower<br>
and higher frequency bands together and can also use, for example,<br>
the energy level variations in those bands and classifies the signal into<br>
music like or speech like.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In the following an encoder 200 according to an example embodiment<br>
of the present invention will be described in more detail with reference<br>
to Fig. 2. The encoder 200 comprises an input block 201 for digitizing,<br>
filtering and framing the input signal when necessary. It should be<br>
noted here that the input signal may already be in a form suitable for<br>
the encoding process. For example, the input signal may have been<br>
digitised at an earlier stage and stored to a memory medium (not<br>
shown). The input signal frames are input to a voice activity detection<br>
block 202. The voice activity detection block 202 outputs a multiplicity<br>
of narrower band signals which are input to an excitation selection<br>
block 203. The excitation selection block 203 analyses the signals to<br>
determine which excitation method is the most appropriate one for<br>
encoding the input signal. The excitation selection block 203 produces<br>
a control signal 204 for controlling a selection means 205 according to<br>
the determination of the excitation method. If it was determined that the<br>
best excitation method for encoding the current frame of the input<br>
signal is a first excitation method, the selection means 205 are<br>
controlled to select the signal of a first excitation block 206. If it was<br>
determined that the best excitation method for encoding the current<br>
frame of the input signal is a second excitation method, the selection<br>
means 205 are controlled to select the signal of a second excitation<br>
block 207. Although the encoder of Fig. 2 has only the first 206 and the<br>
second excitation block 207 for the encoding process, it is obvious that<br>
there can also be more than two different excitation blocks for different<br>
excitation methods available in the encoder 200 to be used in the<br>
encoding of the input signal.<br>
The first excitation block 206 produces, for example, a TCX excitation<br>
signal and the second excitation block 207 produces, for example, a<br>
ACELP excitation signal.<br>
The LPC analysis block 208 performs a LPC analysis on the digitised<br>
input signal on a frame by frame basis to find such a parameter set<br>
which matches best with the input signal.<br>
LPC parameters 210 and excitation parameters 211 are, for example,<br>
quantised and encoded in a quantisation and encoding block 212<br>
before transmission e.g. to a communication network 704 (Fig. 7).<br>
However, it is not necessary to transmit the parameters but they can,<br>
for example, be stored on a storage medium and at a later stage<br>
retrieved for transmission and/or decoding.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts one example of a filter 300 which can be used in the<br>
encoder 200 for the signal analysis. The filter 300 is, for example, a<br>
filter bank of the voice activity detection block of the AMR-WB codec,<br>
wherein a separate filter is not needed but it is also possible to use<br>
other filters for this purpose. The filter 300 comprises two or more filter<br>
blocks 301 to divide the input signal into two or more subband signals<br>
on different frequencies. In other words, each output signal of the filter<br>
300 represents a certain frequency band of the input signal. The output<br>
signals of the filter 300 can be used in the excitation selection block<br>
203 to determine the frequency content of the input signal.<br>
The excitation selection block 203 evaluates energy levels of each<br>
output of the filter bank 300 and analyses the relations between lower<br>
and higher frequency subbands together with the energy level<br>
variations in those subbands and classifies the signal into music like or<br>
speech like.<br>
The invention is based on examining the frequency content of the input<br>
signal to select the excitation method for frames of the input signal. In<br>
the following, AMR-WB extension (AMR-WB+) is used as a practical<br>
example used to classify input signal into speech like or music like<br>
signals and to select either ACELP- or TCX-excitation for those signal<br>
respectively. However, the invention is not limited to AMR-WB codecs<br>
or ACELP- and TCX- excitation methods.<br>
In the extended AMR-WB (AMR-WB+) codec, there are two types of<br>
excitation for LP-synthesis: ACELP pulse-like excitation and transform<br>
coded excitation (TCX). ACELP excitation is the same than used<br>
already in the original 3GPP AMR-WB standard (3GPP TS 26.190) and<br>
TCX is an improvement implemented in the extended AMR-WB.<br>
AMR-WB extension example is based on the AMR-WB VAD filter<br>
banks, which for each 20 ms input frame, produces signal energy E(n)<br>
in the 12 subbands over the frequency range from 0 to 6400 Hz as<br>
shown in Fig. 3. The bandwidths of the filter banks are normally not<br>
equal but may vary on different bands as can be seen on Fig. 3. Also<br>
the number of subbands may vary and the subbands may be partly<br>
overlapping. Then energy levels of each subband are normalised by<br>
dividing the energy level E(n) from each subband by the width of that<br>
subband (in Hz) producing normalised EN(n) energy levels of each<br>
band where n is the band number from 0 to 11. Index 0 refers to the<br>
lowest subband shown in Fig. 3.<br>
In the excitation selection block 203 the standard deviation of the<br>
energy levels is calculated for each of the 12 subbands using e.g. two<br>
windows: a short window stdshort(n) and a long window stdlong(n). For<br>
AMR-WB+ case, the length of the short window is 4 frames and the<br>
long window is 16 frames. In these calculations, the 12 energy levels<br>
from the current frame together with past 3 or 15 frames are used to<br>
derive these two standard deviation values. The special feature of this<br>
calculation is that it is only performed when voice activity detection<br>
block 202 indicates 213 active speech. This will make the algorithm<br>
react faster especially after long speech pauses.<br>
Then, for each frame, the average standard deviation over all the 12<br>
filter banks are taken for both long and short window and average<br>
standard deviation values stdashort and stdalong are created.<br>
For frames of the audio signal, also a relation between lower frequency<br>
bands and higher frequency bands are calculated. In AMR-WB+<br>
energy of lower frequency subbands LevL from 1 to 7 are taken and<br>
normalised by dividing it by the length (bandwidth) of these subbands<br>
(in Hz). For higher frequency bands from 8 to 11 energy of them are<br>
taken and normalised respectively to create LevH. Note that in this<br>
example embodiment the lowest subband 0 is not used in these<br>
calculations because it usually contains so much energy that it will<br>
distort the calculations and make the contributions from other<br>
subbands too small. From these measurements the relation LPH =<br>
LevL / LevH is defined. In addition, for each frame a moving average<br>
LPHa is calculated using the current and 3 past LPH values. After<br>
these calculations a measurement of the low and high frequency<br>
relation LPHaF for the current frame is calculated by using weighted<br>
sum of the current and 7 past moving average LPHa values by setting<br>
slightly more weighting for the latest values.<br>
It is also possible to implement the present invention so that only one<br>
or few of the available subbands are analysed.<br>
Also average level AVL of the filter blocks 301 for the current frame is<br>
calculated by subtracting the estimated level of background noise from<br>
each filter block output, and summing these levels multiplied by the<br>
highest frequency of the corresponding filter block 301, to balance the<br>
high frequency subbands containing relatively less energy than the<br>
lower frequency subbands.<br>
Also the total energy of the current frame TotEO from all the filter blocks<br>
301 subtracted by background noise estimate of the each filter bank<br>
301 is calculated.<br>
After calculating these measurements, a choice between ACELP and<br>
TCX excitation is made by using, for example, the following method. In<br>
the following it is assumed that when a flag is set, other flags are<br>
cleared to prevent conflicts. First, the average standard deviation value<br>
for the long window stdalong is compared with a first threshold value<br>
TH1, for example 0.4. If the standard deviation value stdalong is<br>
smaller than the first threshold value TH1, a TCX MODE flag is set.<br>
Otherwise, the calculated measurement of the low and high frequency<br>
relation LPHaF is compared with a second threshold value TH2, for<br>
example 280.<br>
If the calculated measurement of the low and high frequency relation<br>
LPHaF is greater than the second threshold value TH2, the TCX<br>
MODE flag is set. Otherwise, an inverse of the standard deviation<br>
value stdalong subtracted by the first threshold value TH1 is calculated<br>
and a first constant C1, for example 5, is summed to the calculated<br>
inverse value. The sum is compared with the calculated measurement<br>
of the low and high frequency relation LPHaF:<br>
C1+(1/( stdalong -TH1))&gt; LPHaF (1)<br>
If the result of the comparison is true, the TCX MODE flag is set. If the<br>
result of the comparison is not true, the standard deviation value<br>
stdalong is multiplied by a first multiplicand M1 (e.g. -90) and a second<br>
constant C2 (e.g. 120) is added to the result of the multiplication. The<br>
sum is compared with the calculated measurement of the low and high<br>
frequency relation LPHaF:<br>
M1* stdalong +C2 
If the sum is smaller than the calculated measurement of the low and<br>
high frequency relation LPHaF, an ACELP MODE flag is set. Otherwise<br>
an UNCERTAIN MODE flag is set indicating that the excitation method<br>
could not yet be selected for the current frame.<br>
A further examination is performed after the above described steps<br>
before the excitation method for the current frame is selected. First, it is<br>
examined whether either the ACELP MODE flag or the UNCERTAIN<br>
MODE flag is set and if the calculated average level AVL of the filter<br>
banks 301 for the current frame is greater than a third threshold value<br>
TH3 (e.g. 2000), therein the TCX MODE flag is set and the ACELP<br>
MODE flag and the UNCERTAIN MODE flag are cleared.<br>
Next, if the UNCERTAIN MODE flag is set, the similar evaluations are<br>
performed for the average standard deviation value stdashort for the<br>
short window than what was performed above for the average standard<br>
deviation value stdalong for the long window but using slightly different<br>
values for the constants and thresholds in the comparisons. If the<br>
average standard deviation value stdashort for the short window is<br>
smaller than a fourth threshold value TH4 (e.g. 0.2), the TCX MODE<br>
flag is set. Otherwise, an inverse of the standard deviation value<br>
stdashort for the short window subtracted by the fourth threshold value<br>
TH4 is calculated and a third constant C3 (e.g. 2.5) is summed to the<br>
calculated inverse value. The sum is compared with the calculated<br>
measurement of the low and high frequency relation LPHaF:<br>
C3+(1 /( stdashort-TH4)) &gt; LPHaF (3)<br>
If the result of the comparison is true, the TCX MODE flag is set. If the<br>
result of the comparison is not true, the standard deviation value<br>
stdashort is multiplied by a second multiplicand M2 (e.g. -90) and a<br>
fourth constant C4 (e.g. 140) is added to the result of the multiplication.<br>
The sum is compared with the calculated measurement of the low and<br>
high frequency relation LPHaF:<br>
M2* stdashort+C4 
If the sum is smaller than the calculated measurement of the low and<br>
high frequency relation LPHaF, the ACELP MODE flag is set.<br>
Otherwise the UNCERTAIN MODE flag is set indicating that the<br>
excitation method could not yet be selected for the current frame.<br>
At the next stage the energy levels of the current frame and the<br>
previous frame are examined. If the rate between the total energy of<br>
the current frame TotEO and the total energy of the previous frame<br>
TotE-1 is greater than a fifth threshold value TH5 (e.g. 25) the ACELP<br>
MODE flag is set and the TCX MODE flag and the UNCERTAIN MODE<br>
flag are cleared.<br>
Finally, if the TCX MODE flag or the UNCERTAIN MODE flag is set<br>
and if the calculated average level AVL of the filter banks 301 for the<br>
current frame is greater than the third threshold value TH3 and the total<br>
energy of the current frame TotEO is less than a sixth threshold value<br>
TH6 (e.g. 60) the ACELP MODE flag is set.<br>
When the above described evaluation method is performed the first<br>
excitation method and the first excitation block 206 is selected if the<br>
TCX MODE flag is set or the second excitation method and the second<br>
excitation block 207 is selected if the ACELP MODE flag is set. If,<br>
however, the UNCERTAIN MODE flag is set, the evaluation method<br>
could not perform the selection. In that case e either ACELP or TCX is<br>
selected or some further analysis have to be performed to make the<br>
differentiation.<br>
The method can also be illustrated as the following pseudo-code:<br>
if (stdalong<th1></th1>
SET TCX_MODE<br>
else if (LPHaF &gt; TH2)<br>
SET TCX_MODE<br>
else if ((C1+(1/( stdalong -TH1))) &gt; LPHaF)<br>
SETTCX MODE<br>
else if ((M1* stdalong +C2) 
SET ACELP_MODE<br>
else<br>
SET UNCERTAIN_MODE<br>
if (ACELP_MODE or UNCERTAIN_MODE) and (AVL &gt; TH3)<br>
SET TCX_MODE<br>
if(UNCERTAIN_MODE)<br>
if (stdashort 
SET TCX_MODE<br>
else if ((C3+(1/( stdashort -TH4))) &gt; LPHaF)<br>
SET TCX_MODE<br>
else if ((M2* stdashort+C4) 
SETACELP_MODE<br>
else<br>
SET UNCERTAIN_MODE<br>

if ((TotEO/TotE-1)&gt;TH5)<br>
SET ACELP_MODE<br>
if (TCX_MODE || UNCERTAIN_MODE))<br>
if (AVL &gt; TH3 and TotEO 
SET ACELP_MODE<br>
The basic idea behind the classification is illustrated in Figures 4, 5 and<br>
6. Fig. 4 shows an example of a plotting of standard deviation of<br>
energy levels in VAD filter banks as a function of the relation between<br>
low and high-energy components in a music signal. Each dot<br>
corresponds to a 20 ms frame taken from the long music signal<br>
containing different variations of music. The line A is fitted to<br>
approximately correspond to the upper border of the music signal area,<br>
i.e., dots to the right side of the line are not considered as music like<br>
signals in the method according to the present invention.<br>
Respectively, Fig. 5 shows an example of a plotting of standard<br>
deviation of energy levels in VAD filter banks as a function of the<br>
relation between low and high-energy components in a speech signal.<br>
Each dot corresponds to a 20 ms frame taken from the long speech<br>
signal containing different variations of speech and different talkers.<br>
The curve B is fitted to indicate approximately the lower border of the<br>
speech signal area, i.e., dots to the left side of the curve B are not<br>
considered as speech like in the method according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
As can be seen in figure 4, most of the music signal has quite small<br>
standard deviation and relatively even frequency distribution over the<br>
analysed frequencies. For the speech signal plotted in figure 5, the<br>
tendency is other way around, higher standard deviations and more<br>
low frequency components. Putting both signals into the same plot in<br>
figure 6 and fitting curves A, B to match the borders of the regions for<br>
both music and speech signals, it is quite easy to divide the most of the<br>
music signals and the most of the speech signals into different<br>
categories. The fitted curves A, B in the figures are the same than<br>
presented also in the attached pseudo-code above. The pictures<br>
demonstrate only a single standard deviation and low per high<br>
frequency values calculated by long windowing. The pseudo code<br>
contains an algorithm, which uses two different windowings, thus<br>
utilising two different versions of the mapping algorithm presented in<br>
Figures 4, 5 and 6.<br>
The area C limited by the curves A, B in Figure 6 indicates the<br>
overlapping area where further means for classifying music like and<br>
speech like signals may normally be needed. The area C can be made<br>
smaller by using different length of the analysis windows for the signal<br>
variation and combining these different measurements as it is done in<br>
our pseudo-code example. Some overlap can be allowed because<br>
some of the music signals can be efficiently coded with the<br>
compression optimised for speech and some speech signals can be<br>
efficiently coded with the compression optimised for music.<br>
In the example presented above the most optimal ACELP excitation is<br>
selected by using analysis-by-synthesis and the selection between the<br>
best ACELP-excitation and TCX-excitation is done by pre-selection.<br>
Although the invention was presented above by using two different<br>
excitation methods it is possible to use more than two different<br>
excitation methods and make the selection among them for<br>
compressing audio signals. It is also obvious that the filter 300 may<br>
divide the input signal into different frequency bands than presented<br>
above and also the number of frequency bands may be different than<br>
12.<br>
Figure 7 depicts an example of a system in which the present invention<br>
can be applied. The system comprises one or more audio sources 701<br>
producing speech and/or non-speech audio signals. The audio signals<br>
are converted into digital signals by an A/D-converter 702 when<br>
necessary. The digitised signals are input to an encoder 200 of a<br>
transmitting device 700 in which the compression is performed<br>
according to the present invention. The compressed signals are also<br>
quantised and encoded for transmission in the encoder 200 when<br>
necessary. A transmitter 703, for example a transmitter of a mobile<br>
communications device 700, transmits the compressed and encoded<br>
signals to a communication network 704. The signals are received from<br>
the communication network 704 by a receiver 705 of a receiving device<br>
706. The received signals are transferred from the receiver 705 to a<br>
decoder 707 for decoding, dequantisation and decompression. The<br>
decoder 707 comprises detection means 708 to determine the<br>
compression method used in the encoder 200 for a current frame. The<br>
decoder 707 selects on the basis of the determination a first<br>
decompression means 709 or a second decompression means 710 for<br>
decompressing the current frame. The decompressed signals are<br>
connected from the decompression means 709, 710 to a filter 711 and<br>
a D/A converter 712 for converting the digital signal into analog signal.<br>
The analog signal can then be transformed to audio, for example, in a<br>
loudspeaker 713.<br>
The present invention can be implemented in different kind of systems,<br>
especially in low-rate transmission for achieving more efficient<br>
compression than in prior art systems. The encoder 200 according to<br>
the present invention can be implemented in different parts of<br>
communication systems. For example, the encoder 200 can be<br>
implemented in a mobile communication device having limited<br>
processing capabilities.<br>
It is obvious that the present invention is not solely limited to the above<br>
described embodiments but it can be modified within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>
