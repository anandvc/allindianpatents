The present invention relates to a refrigerator comprising a compressor and control means for activating and deactivating said compressor in response to the temperature inside the refrigerator, said activation and deactivation of the compressor being carried out at predetermined cut-on and cut-off temperatures respectively.<br>
With the general term "refrigerator" as used in the description and appended claims we mean domestic fridge and freezer, of whatever kind. It is well known in the domestic refrigeration technical field that the user through a user interface provided with knobs or the like can vary the cut-off and cut-on temperature values. When the user wants to select a lower food conservation temperature, he turns the knob accordingly. The control unit detects such change and varies the cut-off temperature accordingly. The cut-on temperature can vary too (therefore maintaining the same interval between cut-off and cut-on temperatures) or can be kept constant (particularly in fridge compartment). In the fridge compartment the activation of the compressor can be conditional upon detection of a proper temperature on the evaporator (for avoiding frost build-up).<br>
in addition to the "manual" setting of the desired degree of refrigeration in the food conservation cavity (or in the electronic models in addition to the setting of the average temperature of the cavity), the control unit senses the actual temperature of the cavity and, if it is equal or above the cut-on temperature, activates the compressor or. if it is equal or below the cut-off temperature, deactivates the compressor. The temperature inside the cavity is therefore oscillating between the cut-on and cut-off temperature, it is also well known that the storage temperature inside the refrigerator cavities (either fridge of freezer) should be kept as constant as possible for the whole period of storage. For some food products even a small variation has serious consequences. Moreover, fluctuations of temperature often cause condensation of moisture on stored products, which is undesirable because it may favour the growth of microorganisms. In tests carried out by the applicant, it became clear that the main cause of fluctuations of temperature was a special event such as the addition of a big load in the storage cavity, a door opening longer than usual or a black out. In such events, even if the temperature of air in the cavity goes back quite shortly to the nominal value,<br>
IT20030063<br><br>
the temperature of food takes a longer time for returning to the same value before such event. Since the recovery of food temperature is more important, in term of food conservation, than the recovery of air temperature in the cavity, it became clear to the applicant that the known control systems could not cope with the temperature oscillation of the food stored in the cavity. An object of the invention is therefore to provide a refrigerator that can solve the above-mentioned problem of food temperature oscillation in a simple and economical way.<br>
The above problem is solved by a refrigerator having the features listed in the appended claims.<br>
Thanks to such features, if the temperature inside the cavity rises to a value higher than normal (for instance due to an exceptionally big piece of food loaded in the cavity, or to a door opening longer than usual or to an electrical black out, the control means recognise this event, for instance via temperature sensor or via door position sensor or both, and automatically change working parameters of the refrigerator leveraging on the different setting and algorithm of the electronic control with the aim of bringing back the food temperature to the correct value faster than known refrigerators usually do. The technical solution according to the invention guarantees a lower fluctuation of the temperature of the stored food.<br>
Preferably the parameter which is changed according to the invention is the cut-off temperature, which is decreased to a value dependent on the rise of temperature inside the refrigerator. According to this feature, the electronic control unit senses how the temperature of the cavity increases due to one of the above "special" events, and adjusts the decrease of the cut-off temperature depending on the above temperature rise. The above mentioned and other features and objects of the present invention, and the manner of attaining them, will become more apparent and the invention itself will be better understood by reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure  1   is  a   schematic view  of a  refrigerator according  to  the<br>
invention;<br>
IT20030068<br><br>
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram showing how the food temperature varies in a conventional refrigerator and in a refrigerator according to the invention;<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram showing how the food temperature and the air temperature changes in a fridge cavity of a conventional refrigerator after the door has been opened for about four minutes; Figure 4 is a diagram showing how the food temperature and the air temperature changes in a fridge cavity of a refrigerator according to the present invention after the door has been opened for about four minutes;<br>
Figure 5 is a block diagram showing the algorithm adopted in the control unit of a fridge compartment of a no-frost refrigerator according to the present invention;<br>
Figure 6 is a block diagram showing the algorithm adopted in the control unit of a freezer compartment of a no-frost refrigerator according to the present invention;<br>
Figure 7 is a block diagram showing the algorithm adopted in the control unit of a fridge compartment of a static refrigerator according to the present invention; and<br>
Figure 8 is a block diagram showing the algorithm adopted in the control unit of a freezer compartment of a static refrigerator according to the present invention. With reference to the drawings, with 10 is shown a refrigerator having two food storage cavities, a first upper cavity 10a used as freezer and a second lower cavity 10b used as fridge or fresh-food compartment. Both cavities 10a and 10b are closed by doors 11a and 11b respectively. The refrigerator has a refrigeration circuit comprising a compressor 12 connected to an electronic control unit 14. To the same control unit 14 a temperature sensor 16 within the freezer cavity 10a and a temperature sensor 18 within the fridge cavity 10b are connected. The temperature sensors 16 and 18 may be NTC sensors detecting the temperature of air inside the cavities.<br>
Referring to the control of the fridge cavity 10b (but the same control method is used for the freezer cavity 10a too), if the door 1 lb of the fridge cavity 10b is  opened  for  a   long   time,   or  if  some  food   is   introduced   inside  the<br>
IT20030068<br><br>
compartment the electronic control unit 14 via NTC sensor 18 will recognise a special event and will measure temperature difference between a predetermined cut-on temperature and actual reading of the NTC sensor. Such difference can be defined as Delta Refrigerator Rising Temperature, or ARRT. The control unit 14 uses such ARRT for modifying the cut-off temperature setting with the aim to recover quickly the previous temperature during the first on-off compressor cycle after the above mentioned event. The new cut-off temperature is lower than the predetermined cut-off temperature, and therefore it is possible to define a difference between such standard cutoff temperature and the new cut-off temperature as ARCT, i.e. Delta Refrigerator Cut-off Temperature (just for the first cut-off), which guarantees the optimal temperature recover during the first cycle after the event The relationship between ARRT and ARCT can be defined from laboratory tests for all conditions (at different ambient temperatures), and it is preferably defined as a head-up table.<br>
For the control of the freezer cavity 10a the control method is substantially identical to the previous one. In addition to the above method, the rise of the freezer temperature can be linked to the quantity of fresh food introduced into the freezer cavity 10a, and the compressor of the refrigeration circuit of the freezer is then activated for a predetermined time linked to the above temperature rise and therefore to the quantity of food introduced into the freezer cavity 10a. Therefore it is no longer necessary, for small or medium amounts of food, to use a special button in the user interface for the known function of "fast-freezing", since the refrigerator senses when fresh food is loaded into the freezer connpartment and adjust the compressor function accordingly.<br>
In figure 2 it is schematically shown a comparison between the behaviour of a known refrigerator and a refrigerator according to the invention when a so-called "special event" occurs. Figure 2 specifically refers to the fridge compartment 10b where in the first portion A of the diagram temperature vs. time we can see how the temperature of the food "cycles" between 4 and 6°C, therefore following the normal variation of air temperature in the cavity. At a cert:ain time B (corresponding to the special event, for instance the opening of the door 11b for a time of about 4 minutes), the temperature of the food rises<br>
IT20030068<br><br>
up to 9°C. Due to the higher inertia of food in changing temperature compared to air, in the known refrigerator the temperature of the food takes a longer time for getting back to the "nominal" range between 4 and 6°C. This is shown in the C portion of the diagram. According to the present invention, in which the cut-off temperature is decreased for the first on/off cycle after the special event, the temperature of the food takes a shorter time for getting back to the desired range (portion D of the diagram). The difference between the two recovery times is shown in figure 2 with the reference E, and can be of several minutes or hours.<br>
In figure 3 it is shown an experimental diagram of the temperature of air within the fridge cavity and of the food temperature in a conventional refrigerator when the door is opened for a time of about 4 minutes. With reference G it is indicated the behaviour of the air temperature, and with F the variation of food temperature. It is clear how. after the special event S, the food temperature follows, with a certain delay due to higher temperature inertia of food, the temperature pattern of the air.<br>
In figure 4 it is clear how, in a refrigerator according to the present invention, the temperature of air G' reaches a lower temperature after the special event S\ and this is due to the decrease of the compressor cut-off temperature. Accordingly, also the temperature F' of the food is decreased accordingly (with a certain delay), and such behaviour allows to get back to the desired food temperature after a shorter time if compared to figure 3. In figure 5 it is shown the control algorithm of a fridge compartment of a no-frost side by side refrigerator according to the invention. The control unit 14 of such   refrigerator  has   inputs  from  the  air temperature  NTC   (Negative Temperature Coefficient) sensor inside the compartment and from a door position on/off sensor (not shown in the drawings), a clock being usually embedded in the control unit. In the first step of the control algorithm, the control unit checks whether the refrigerator has been plugged in recently or there   was   a   recent   blackout.   If  the   refrigerator   was   running   for   a predetermined time (in this  example  10  hours) and there was  no door opening, the control unit assumes that there was no blackout or any other special event (door opening), and therefore the normal control routine of the refrigerator is followed. When a blackout or a door opening is detected, the<br>
(120030068<br><br>
algorithm according to the invention starts by reading the temperature of the NTC sensor within the compartment (step H). In step K a comparison is made between the sensed air temperature and the predetermined cut-on temperature. If the difference Y between such temperature is higher than a predetermined value H1, then this means that the control algorithm has to go on, it is lower this means that there is no need to proceed with the algorithm. The following step L is used to prevent the algorithm from being implemented when the defrost cycle is on. The further step M is used to prevent the algorithm to be further implemented when the user has already activated the known fast cooling function, according to which the compressor is actuated for a predetermined time or until the cut-off temperature is reached. If all the above conditions are met, in the next step P the control unit checks whether the program of the algorithm is already running. If it is not already running, the algorithm sets a cut-off temperature depending on the temperature value set by the user through the user interface. If for instance the temperature set by the user is 6°C (first block Q), the control unit automatically sets the cut-off temperature to the value which would be valid for a selected temperature of 4X. This decrease of the cut-off temperature can be carried out for the first cut-off only (first on/off cycle) or alternatively for a predetermined period of time (in the example 2 hours).<br>
If the temperature set by the user is in the low end of the range (in the example 3X, block R), the algorithm activates the so called super cool function (i.e. the compressor runs for a predetermined period of time or until the cut-off temperature is reached) for a time depending on the sensed temperature. When the above algorithm is running, an icon in the user interface is automatically switched on for informing the user of the working condition of the refrigerator.<br>
In figure 6 it is shown the block diagram of the control algorithm of the freezer compartment of the same no-frost refrigerator of figure 5. The left portion of the diagram of figure 6 is substantially identical to the left portion of figure 5, and therefore the similar blocks of the diagram have been indicated with the same references. Of course in the step identified by block K, the difference between the actual temperature (sensed by NTC sensor) and the cut-on temperature will be different (value X in the example), and also the trigger<br>
IT20030068<br><br>
value L1 will be different. In the right portion of the diagram, if the control algorithm is not already running (step P), the above difference between the actual temperature and the cut-on temperature is compared to temperature range between values LI and L2 (step S) and, in case the actual temperature is outside such range, it is compared to temperature range between values L2 and L3 (step T), assuming that L2 &gt; L1 and L3 &gt; L2. If, according to step S, the above temperature difference is within L1 and L2, the cut-off temperature is decreased of a predetermined value W until the new cut-off temperature is reached or for a predetermined period (3 hours in the example). If the actual air temperature in the freezer compartment is higher than L2, and if such temperature is within L2 and L3, then the compressor is activated for a predetermined time period (3 hours in the example). If the above temperature is above L3, than the compressor is run for a predetermined period longer than the previous period (6 hours in the example).<br>
The algorithms of figures 5 and 6 are used also when there is only one compressor, since the fridge and the freezer have two different control systems.<br>
In figure 7 it is shown the control algorithm of a fridge compartment of a static refrigerator according to the invention. The block diagram of figure 7 is substantially similar to the diagram of figure 5, where the step L (corresponding to check de-frost condition), has been removed and the temperature values are different.<br>
The control algorithm of figure 8 relates to the freezer compartment of the same static refrigerator of figure 7. There are many similarities between the control algorithm of figure 8 and the one of figure 6 (freezer compartment of no-frost refrigerator). The main difference resides in that in Figure 8 there is no check of black-out condition or door opening, rather only a detection of the actual air temperature within the freezer compartment, if such temperature (block K) is higher than a predetermined value X with reference to the cut-on temperature, then the algorithm checks (step U) whether the user has activated manually the known fast freezing function (used when a big piece of food is put in the freezer compartment for freezing). If such function has not been activated, then the control unit waits for a certain period of time (step V) before repeating the same check of previous step K (now step K'). This delay<br>
IT20030068<br><br>
has been introduced in order to give to the temperature sensor a sufficient time for reaching a maximum temperature. The right portion of the diagram of figure 8 is substantially identical to the right portion of the diagram of figure 6. It is important to note that the main difference between the algorithms of figures 5-7 and the one of figure 8 is the presence/absence of the door sensor. In other words it is a difference based on components rather on average temperature (fridge or freezer) or refrigerator construction (direct cool or no-frost). According to the presence of the door sensor, the designer can choose the most appropriate algorithm.<br><br><br><br><br>
