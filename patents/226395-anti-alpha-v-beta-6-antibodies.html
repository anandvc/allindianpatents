FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to the field of molecular biology<br>
and specifically to antibodies to αγβ6 integrins.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Integrins are a superfamily of cell surface receptors that mediate<br>
cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. These proteins are known to provide anchorage<br>
as well as signals for cellular growth, migration and differentiation during<br>
development and tissue repair. Integrins have also been implicated in cell<br>
dedifferentiation and invasion, notably where cells lose their specialized form and<br>
become metastasizing cancer cells.<br>
Integrins are heterodimeric proteins composed of two noncovalently<br>
linked subunits, α and β. The binding specificity of integrins is dictated by the<br>
combination of some 18 different α chains with some 8 different β chains. The<br>
αγβ6 integrin can bind to a number of ligands including fibronectin, tenascin,<br>
vitronectin, and the recently identified latency associated peptide "LAP," a 278<br>
amino acid peptide synthesized as part of the precursor TGF-β protein (Munger et<br>
al., Cell 96(3):319-328 (1999)). LAP is cleaved from the mature form of TGF-β as<br>
an N-terminal peptide during secretion but remains noncovalently associated with<br>
TGF-β to maintain its latent state. This complex cannot bind to the TGF-jS<br>
receptor and hence is not biologically active. The αγβ6 integrin can bind directly to<br>
an RGD motif contained within LAP, resulting in release of LAP and activation of<br><br>
TGF-β. Since αγβ6 binding to LAP may be important in the conversion of TGF-β<br>
to its active state, blocking the binding may result in inhibition of αγβ6-mediated<br>
activation of TGF-β and the associated fibrotic pathology.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is based on the discovery and characterization of<br>
high affinity antibodies against αγβ6, including the identification and analysis of<br>
key amino acid residues in the complementary determining regions (CDRs) of such<br>
antibodies.<br>
This invention embraces a monoclonal antibody that (a) specifically<br>
binds to αγβ6; (b) inhibits the binding of αγβ6 to its ligand such as LAP, fibronectin,<br>
vitronectin, and tenascin with an IC50 value lower than that of 10D5 (International<br>
Patent Application Publication WO 99/07405); (c) blocks activation of TGF-β; (d)<br>
contains certain amino acid sequences in the CDRs (e.g., those shown in Figs. 7A<br>
and 7B) that provide binding specificity to αγβ6; (e) specifically binds to the β6<br>
subunit; and/or (f) recognizes αγβ6 in immunostaining procedures, such as<br>
immunostaining of paraffin-embedded tissues.<br>
It has been discovered that antibodies that bind to αγβ6 can be<br>
grouped into biophysically distinct classes and subclasses. One class of antibodies<br>
exhibits the ability to block binding of a ligand (e.g., LAP) to αγβ6 (blockers). This<br>
class of antibodies can be further divided into subclasses of cation-dependent<br>
blockers and cation-independent blockers. Some of the cation-dependent blockers<br>
contain an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) peptide sequence, whereas the cation-<br>
independent blockers do not contain an RGD sequence. Another class of<br>
antibodies exhibits the ability to bind to αγβ6 and yet does not block binding of<br>
αγβ6 to a ligand (nonblockers).<br>
Accordingly, in some embodiments of this invention, some<br>
antibodies of this invention are divalent cation-dependent for binding to αγβ6, while<br>
others are divalent cation-independent. Exemplary cations are Ca2+, Mg2+ and<br>
Mn2+.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the antibody comprises the same heavy and<br>
light chain polypeptide sequences as an antibody produced by hybridoma 6.1A8,<br>
6.3G9, 6.8G6, 6.2B1, 6.2B10, 6.2A1, 6.2E5, 7.1G10, 7.7G5, or 7.1C5.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibodies comprise a heavy chain whose<br>
complementarity determining regions (CDR) 1, 2 and 3 consist essentially (i.e.,<br>
with the exception of some conservative variations) of the sequences of SEQ ID<br>
Nos:l, 4 and 7, respectively, and/or a light chain whose CDRs 1, 2 and 3 consist<br>
essentially of the sequences of SEQ ID NOs:10,13 and 15, respectively.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibodies comprise a heavy chain whose<br>
CDRs 1, 2 and 3 consist essentially of the sequences of SEQ ID NOs:3, 5 and 8,<br>
respectively, and/or a light chain whose CDRs 1,2 and 3 consist essentially of the<br>
sequences of SEQ ID NOs:l 1, l4 and 17, respectively.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibodies comprise a heavy chain whose<br>
CDRs 1,2 and 3 consist essentially of the sequences of SEQ ID NOs:3, 6 and 9,<br>
respectively, and/or a light chain whose CDRs 1, 2 and 3 consist essentially of the<br>
sequences of SEQ ID NOs:12,14 and 18, respectively.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibodies comprise a heavy chain whose<br>
CDRs 1, 2 and 3 consist essentially of the sequences of SEQ ID NOs:2, 46 and 47,<br>
respectively, and/or a light chain whose CDRs 1, 2 and 3 consist essentially of the<br>
sequences of SEQ ED NOs:48,13 and 16, respectively.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibodies comprise a heavy chain whose<br>
CDRs 1,2 and 3 consist essentially of the sequences of SEQ ID NOs:49,51 and<br>
53,	respectively, and/or a light chain whose CDRs 1, 2 and 3 consist essentially of<br>
the sequences of SEQ ID NOs:55, 57 and 59, respectively.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibodies comprise a heavy chain whose<br>
CDRs 1, 2 and 3 consist essentially of the sequences of SEQ ID NOs:50, 52 and<br>
54,	respectively, and/or a light chain whose CDRs 1, 2 and 3 consist essentially of<br>
the sequences of SEQ ID NOs:56, 58 and 60, respectively.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibodies comprise a heavy chain<br>
variable domain sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 19-36 and 61-62.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibodies comprise heavy and light<br>
chain variable domain sequences of<br><br>
(l)SEQ IDNOs:19and37;<br>
(2) SEQ ID NO:20 or 21, and SEQ ID NO:38;<br>
(3)SEQ ID NOs:22and43;<br>
(4)	SEQ ID NOs:23 and 44;<br>
(5)	SEQ ID NOs:24 and 45;<br>
(6)	SEQ ID NO:25 or 26 and SEQ ID NO:42;<br>
(7)	SEQ ID NO:27,28, or 29, and SEQ ID NO:39;<br>
(8)	SEQ ID NO:34 or 35, and SEQ ID NO:40;<br>
(9)SEQ ID NOs:36and41;<br><br>
(10)	SEQ ID NOs:61 and 63; or<br>
(11)	SEQ ID NOs:62 and 64,<br>
respectively.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibodies specifically binds to αγβ6 but<br>
does not inhibit the binding of αγβ6 to latency associated peptide (LAP). At least<br>
some of these antibodies are capable of binding to αγβ6 in paraffin-embedded tissue<br>
sections and therefore can be used for diagnostic purposes. Exemplary antibodies<br>
include 6.2A1 and 6.2E5.<br>
This invention also embraces antibodies that bind to the same<br>
epitope as any of the above-described antibodies.<br>
This invention also embraces compositions comprising one or more<br>
antibodies of this invention, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some of<br>
these compositions, the antibodies are conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (i.e., an<br>
agent that impairs the viability and/or the functions of a cell) such as a toxin or a<br>
radionuclide. The antibodies in these compositions can be cation-dependent<br>
antibodies. The compositions can be administered to a subject (e.g., a mammal<br>
such as a human) having or at risk of having a disease mediated by αγβ6, so as to<br>
treat (e.g., alleviating, mitigating, reducing, preventing, postponing the onset of)<br>
the disease. Examples of such diseases include, but are not limited to: fibrosis<br>
(e.g., scleroderma, scarring, liver fibrosis, lung fibrosis, and kidney fibrosis);<br>
psoriasis; cancer (e.g., epithelial cancer; oral, skin, cervical, ovarian, pharyngeal,<br>
laryngeal, esophageal, lung, breast, kidney, or colorectal cancer); Alport's<br>
Syndrome; acute and chronic injuries of the lung, liver, kidney and other internal<br><br>
organs; and sclerosis of the lung, liver, kidney and other internal organs. Risks of<br>
having such diseases may result from genetic predisposition; certain lifestyles such<br>
as smoking and alcoholism; exposure to environmental pollutants such as asbestos;<br>
physiological conditions such as diabetes, hepatitis viral infection (e.g., hepatitis C<br>
viral infection), autoimmune diseases; and medical treatments such as radiation<br>
therapy.<br>
This invention also embraces methods of detecting αγβ6 in a tissue<br>
sample from a mammal (e.g., a human), comprising contacting the tissue sample<br>
with the antibody of the invention, such as 6.2A1 and 6.2E5.<br>
This invention also embraces cells of hybridomas 6.1A8, 6.2B10,<br>
6.3G9, 6.8G6, 6.2B1, 6.2A1, 6.2E5,7.1G10, 7.7G5, and 7.1C5; isolated nucleic<br>
acids comprising a coding sequence for any one of SEQ ID NOs: 19-45 and 61-64;<br>
isolated polypeptides comprising an amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID<br>
NOs:19-45 and 61-64.<br>
An antibody of this invention refers to a full antibody, e.g., an<br>
antibody comprising two heavy chains and two light chains, or to an antigen-<br>
binding fragment of a full antibody such as a Fab fragment, a Fab' fragment, a<br>
F(ab')2 fragment or a F(v) fragment. An antibody of this invention can be a murine<br>
antibody or a homolog thereof, or a fully human antibody. An antibody of this<br>
invention can also be a humanized antibody, a chimeric antibody or a single-<br>
chained antibody.1 An antibody of this invention can be of any isotype and<br>
subtype, for example, IgA (e.g., IgAl and IgA2), IgG (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and<br>
IgG4), IgE, IgD, IgM, wherein the light chains of the immunoglobulin may be of<br>
type kappa or lambda.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibody of the invention may comprise<br>
a mutation (e.g., deletion, substitution or addition) at one or more (e.g., 2, 3,4, 5,<br>
or 6) of certain positions in the heavy chain such that the effector function of the<br>
antibody (e.g., the ability of the antibody to bind to a Fc receptor or a complement<br>
factor) is altered without affecting the antibody's antigen-binding ability. In other<br>
embodiments, the antibody of this invention may contain a mutation at an amino<br>
acid residue that is a site for glycosylation such that the glycosylation site is<br>
eliminated. Such an antibody may have clinically beneficial, reduced effector<br><br>
functions or other undesired functions while retaining its antigen-binding affinity.<br>
Mutation of a glycosylation site can also be beneficial for process development (e. g. ,<br>
protein expression and purification). In still other embodiments, the heavy or light chains<br>
can contain mutations that increase affinity or potency.<br>
Several of the Fusion &amp;num;6 and Fusion &amp;num;7 hybridomas were deposited at<br>
the American Type Culture Collection("ATCC" ; P. O. Box 1549, Manassas, VA 20108,<br>
USA) under the Budapest Treaty. Hybridoma clones 6.1A8, 6.2B10, 6.3G9, 6.8G6, and<br>
6.2B1 were deposited on August 16,2001, and have accession numbers ATCCPTA-<br>
3647,-3648,-3649,-3645, and-3646, respectively.<br>
Hybridoma clones 6.2A1, 6.2E5, 7.1CH0, 7.7G5, and 7.1C5 were deposited on December<br>
5,2001, and have accession numbers ATCCPTA-3896,-3897,-3898,- 3899, and-3900,<br>
respectively. See Table 1, infra.<br>
The antibodies of the invention are useful for treating any clinically undesirable<br>
condition or disease (as discussed herein) that is mediated by binding of αγβ6, to its ligand,<br>
such as LAP and fibronectin. These antibodies can be more potent, via higher affinity or<br>
avidity, and cation dependency or independency of binding to ligand, than previously<br>
known αγβ6 antibodies.<br>
In addition to therapeutic applications of the antibodies of the invention,<br>
especially the blockers, the nonblocker class of antibodies can be used for diagnostic<br>
purposes, such as in antigen capture assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays<br>
(ELISAs), immunohistochemistry, and the like<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the<br>
following detailed description, drawings, and claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention features classes and subclasses of antibodies that are<br>
specific for the integrin αγβ6. At least one class of the antibodies (blockers) are<br>
capable of blocking the binding of αγβ6 to LAP or preventing the activation of<br>
TGF-β.<br>
The following describes the various methods of making the<br>
antibodies of this invention. Methods that are known in the art but not specifically<br>
described herein are also within the scope of this invention. For instance,<br>
antibodies of this invention can also be identified using phage-displayed antibody<br>
libraries, such as those described in Smith, Science 228:1315-7 (1985); U.S.<br>
Patents 5,565,332, 5,733,743, 6,291,650, and 6,303,313. Additional antibodies of<br>
this invention can be made by coupling the heavy chains identified herein with a<br>
noncognate light chain, e.g., a light chain identified by phage display technology. .<br>
Non-Human Hvbridoma Antibodies<br>
The monoclonal antibodies of this invention can be generated by<br>
well known hybridoma technology. To do so, β6 -I- animals (e.g., mice, rats or<br>
rabbits) are immunized with purified or crude αγβ6 preparations, cells transfected<br>
with cDNA constructs encoding αγ, β6 or both antigens, cells that constitutively<br>
express αγβ6, and the like. The antigen can be delivered as purified protein, protein<br>
expressed on cells, protein fragment or peptide thereof, or as naked DNA or viral<br>
vectors encoding the protein, protein fragment, or peptide. Sera of the immunized<br>
animals are then tested for the presence of anti-αγβ6 antibodies. B cells are isolated<br>
from animals that test positive, and hybridomas are made with these B cells.<br>
Antibodies secreted by the hybridomas are screened for their ability<br>
to bind specifically to αγβ6 (e.g., binding to β6-transfected cells and not to<br>
untransfected parent cells) and for any other desired features, e.g., having the<br>
desired CDR consensus sequences, inhibiting (or not inhibiting in the case of<br>
nonblockers) the binding between LAP and αγβ6 with an IC50 value lower than that<br>
of known anti-αγβ6 antibody 10D5, or inhibiting TGF-β activation.<br>
Hybridoma cells that test positive in the screening assays are<br>
cultured in a nutrient medium under conditions that allow the cells to secrete the<br><br>
monoclonal antibodies into the culture medium. The conditioned hybridoma<br>
culture supernatant is then collected and antibodies contained in the supernatant are<br>
purified. Alternatively, the desired antibody may be produced by injecting the<br>
hybridoma cells into the peritoneal cavity of an unimmunized animal (e.g., a<br>
mouse). The hybridoma cells proliferate in the peritoneal cavity, secreting the<br>
antibody which accumulates as ascites fluid. The antibody may then be harvested<br>
by withdrawing the ascites fluid from the peritoneal cavity with a syringe.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies can also be generated by isolating the<br>
antibody-coding cDNAs from the desired hybridomas, transfecting mammalian<br>
host cells (e.g., CHO or NSO cells) with the cDNAs, culturing the transfected host<br>
cells, and recovering the antibody from the culture medium.<br>
Chimeric Antibodies<br>
The monoclonal antibodies of this invention can also be generated<br>
by engineering a cognate hybridoma (e.g., murine, rat or rabbit) antibody. For<br>
instance, a cognate antibody can be altered by recombinant DNA technology such<br>
that part or all of the hinge and/or constant regions of the heavy and/or light chains<br>
are replaced with the corresponding components of an antibody from another<br>
species (e.g., human). Generally, the variable domains of the engineered antibody<br>
remain identical or substantially so to the variable domains of the cognate<br>
antibody. Such an engineered antibody is called a chimeric antibody and is less<br>
antigenic than the cognate antibody when administered to an individual of the<br>
species from which the hinge and/or constant region is derived (e.g., a human).<br>
Methods of making chimeric antibodies are well known in the art.<br>
The chimeric antibodies embraced in this invention may contain a<br>
heavy chain variable domain having a sequence identical (or substantially so) to<br>
any one of SEQ ID NOs: 19-36 and/or a light chain variable domain having a<br>
sequence identical (or substantially so) to any one of SEQ ID NOs:37-45.<br>
Preferred human constant regions include those derived from IgGl<br>
and IgG4.<br>
Fully Human Antibodies<br>
The monoclonal antibodies of this invention also include fully<br>
human antibodies. They may be prepared using in vitro-primed human<br><br>
splenocytes, as described by Boeraer et al., J. Immunol. 147:86-95 (1991), or<br>
using phage-displayed antibody libraries, as described in, e.g., U.S. Patent<br>
6,300,064.<br>
Some other methods for producing fully human antibodies involve<br>
the use of non-human animals that have inactivated endogenous Ig loci and are<br>
transgenic for un-rearranged human antibody heavy chain and light chain genes.<br>
Such transgenic animals can be immunized with αγβ6 and hybridomas are then<br>
made from B cells derived therefrom. These methods are described in, e.g., the<br>
various GenPharm/Medarex (Palo Alto, CA) publications/patents concerning<br>
transgenic mice containing human Ig miniloci (e.g., Lonberg U.S. Patent<br>
5,789,650); the various Abgenix (Fremont, CA) publications/patents with respect<br>
to XENOMICE (e.g., Kucherlapati U.S. Patents 6,075,181, 6,150,584 and<br>
6,162,963; Green et al., Nature Genetics 7:13-21 (1994); and Mendez et al.,<br>
15(2):146-56 (1997)); and the various Kirin (Japan) publications/patents<br>
concerning "transomic" mice (e.g., EP 843 961, and Tomizuka et al., Nature<br>
Genetics 16:133-1443 (1997)).<br>
Humanized Antibodies<br>
The monoclonal antibodies of this invention also include humanized<br>
versions of cognate anti-αγβ6 antibodies derived from other species. A humanized<br>
antibody is an antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology, in which some<br>
or all of the amino acids of a human immunoglobulin light or heavy chain that are<br>
not required for antigen binding (e.g., the constant regions and the framework<br>
regions of the variable domains) are used to substitute for the corresponding amino<br>
acids from the light or heavy chain of the cognate, nonhuman antibody. By way of<br>
example, a humanized version of a murine antibody to a given antigen has on both<br>
of its heavy and light chains (1) constant regions of a human antibody; (2)<br>
framework regions from the variable domains of a human antibody; and (3) CDRs<br>
from the murine antibody. When necessary, one or more residues in the human<br>
framework regions can be changed to residues at the corresponding positions in the<br>
murine antibody so as to preserve the binding affinity of the humanized antibody to<br>
the antigen. This change is sometimes called "back mutation." Humanized<br>
antibodies generally are less likely to elicit an immune response in humans as<br><br>
compared to chimeric human antibodies because the former contain considerably<br>
fewer non-human components.<br>
The methods for making humanized antibodies are described in,<br>
e.g., Winter EP 239 400; Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et<br>
al., Nature 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239: 1534-1536 (1988);<br>
Queen et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029 (1989); U.S. Patent 6,180,370;<br>
and Orlandi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:3833 (1989). Generally, the<br>
transplantation of murine (or other non-human) CDRs onto a human antibody is<br>
achieved as follows. The cDNAs encoding heavy and light chain variable domains<br>
are isolated from a hybridoma. The DNA sequences of the variable domains,<br>
including the CDRs, are determined by sequencing. The DNAs encoding the<br>
CDRs are transferred to the corresponding regions of a human antibody heavy or<br>
light chain variable domain coding sequence by site directed mutagenesis. Then<br>
human constant region gene segments of a desired isotype (e.g., γ1 for CH and k<br>
for CL) are added. The humanized heavy and light chain genes are co-expressed in<br>
mammalian host cells (e.g., CHO or NSO cells) to produce soluble humanized<br>
antibody. To facilitate large scale production of antibodies, it is often desirable to<br>
produce such humanized antibodies in bioreactors containing the antibody-,<br>
expressing cells, or to produce transgenic mammals (e.g., goats, cows, or sheep)<br>
that express the antibody in milk (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,827,690).<br>
At times, direct transfer of CDRs to a human framework leads to a<br>
loss of antigen-binding affinity of the resultant antibody. This is because in some<br>
cognate antibodies, certain amino acids within the framework regions interact with<br>
the CDRs and thus influence the overall antigen binding affinity of the antibody.<br>
In such cases, it would be critical to introduce "back mutations" (supra) in the<br>
framework regions of the acceptor antibody in order to retain the antigen-binding<br>
activity of the cognate antibody.<br>
The general approach of making back mutations is known in the art.<br>
For instance, Queen et al. (supra), Co et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 88:2869-<br>
2873 (1991), and WO 90/07861 (Protein Design Labs Inc.) describe an approach<br>
that involves two key steps. First, the human V framework regions are chosen by<br>
computer analysis for optimal protein sequence homology to the V region<br><br>
framework of the cognate murine antibody. Then, the tertiary structure of the<br>
murine V region is modeled by computer in order to visualize framework amino<br>
acid residues that are likely to interact with the murine CDRs, and these murine<br>
amino acid residues are then superimposed on the homologous human framework.<br>
Under this two-step approach, there are several criteria for<br>
designing humanized antibodies. The first criterion is to use as the human acceptor<br>
the framework from a particular human immunoglobulin that is usually<br>
homologous to the non-human donor immunoglobulin, or to use a consensus<br>
framework from many human antibodies. The second criterion is to use the donor<br>
amino acid rather than the acceptor if the human acceptor residue is unusual and<br>
the donor residue is typical for human sequences at a specific residue of the<br>
framework. The third criterion is to use the donor framework amino acid residue<br>
rather than the acceptor at positions immediately adjacent to the CDRs.<br>
One may also use a different approach as described in, e.g.,<br>
Tempest, Biotechnology 9:266-271 (1991). Under this approach, the V region<br>
frameworks derived from NEWM and REI heavy and light chains, respectively,<br>
are used for CDR-grafting without radical introduction of mouse residues. An<br>
advantage of using this approach is that the three-dimensional structures of NEWM<br>
and REI variable regions are known from X-ray crystallography and thus specific<br>
interactions between CDRs and V region framework residues can be readily<br>
modeled.<br>
Other Moieties<br>
The monoclonal antibodies of this invention may further comprise<br>
other moieties to effect the desired functions. For instance, the antibodies may<br>
include a toxin moiety (e.g., tetanus toxoid or ricin) or a radionuclide (e.g.,111In or<br>
90Y) for killing of cells targeted by the antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 6,307,026)<br>
The antibodies may comprise a moiety (e.g., biotin, fluorescent moieties,<br>
radioactive moieties, histidine tag or other peptide tags) for easy isolation or<br>
detection. The antibodies may also comprise a moiety that can prolong their serum<br>
half life, for example, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety.<br><br>
Diseased Conditions And Animal Models<br>
The antibodies of the invention are useful in the treatment,<br>
including prevention, of αγβ6-mediated diseases. For example, these antibodies<br>
can be used to treat fibrosis (e.g., lung fibrosis, acute lung injury, kidney fibrosis,<br>
liver fibrosis, Alport's Syndrome, and scleroderma) by blocking the activation of<br>
TGF-β or blocking the binding of αγβ6 to any other ligands, such as fibronectin,<br>
vitronectin, and tenascin. The novelty of this approach includes: (1) it blocks the<br>
activation of TGF-β rather than the binding of TGF-β to its receptor, (2) it can<br>
inhibit TGF-β locally (i.e., at sites of αγβ6 upregulation) rather than systemically,<br>
and (3) it inhibits binding of αγβ6 to a ligand. Other than fibrotic diseases or<br>
conditions, the antibodies of the invention are useful in treating cancer or cancer<br>
metastasis (including tumor growth and invasion), particularly epithelial cancers.<br>
A subset of epithelial cancers is squamous cell carcinoma, e.g., head and neck,<br>
oral, breast, lung, prostate, cervical, pharyngeal, colon, pancreatic and ovarian<br>
cancers. Our studies using the new αγβ6 monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that<br>
αγβ6 is highly expressed in many epithelial cancers, especially on the leading edge<br>
of the tumors. The new antibodies can also be used to any other diseases mediated<br>
by αγβ6, including psoriasis.<br>
The treatments of this invention are effective on both human and<br>
animal subjects afflicted with these conditions. Animal subjects to which the<br>
invention is applicable extend to both domestic animals and livestock, raised either<br>
as pets or for commercial purposes. Examples are dogs, cats, cattle, horses, sheep,<br>
hogs and goats.<br>
The efficacy of the antibodies of the invention can be tested in<br>
various animal models. Mouse models for lung fibrosis include bleomycin- (Pittet<br>
et al., J. Clin. Invest. 107(12):1537-1544 (2001); and Munger et al., supra) and<br>
irradiation- inducible lung fibrosis (Franko et al., Rod. Res. 140:347-355 (1994)).<br>
In bleomycin-treated mice, the expression of αγβ6 increases in the epithelial<br>
alveolar cells of the lungs. But β6 knockout mice are protected from bleomycin-<br>
induced injury and fibrosis.<br>
Mouse models for kidney fibrosis include COL4A3 -/- mice (see,<br>
e.g., Cosgrove et al., Amer. J. Path. 157:1649-1659 (2000), mice with adriamycin-<br><br>
induced injury (Wang et al., Kidney International 58: 1797-1804 (2000); Deman et<br>
al., Nephrol Dial Transplant 16: 147-150 (2001)), db/db mice (Ziyadeh et al.,<br>
PNAS USA 97:8015-8020 (2000)), and mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction<br>
(Fogo et al., Lab Investigation 81:189A (2001); and Fogo et al., Journal of the<br>
American Society of Nephrology 12:819A (2001)). In all of these models, the mice<br>
develop kidney injury and fibrosis that can progress to renal failure, αγβ6 is<br>
upregulated in the epithelial lining of the ascending and descending tubules of the<br>
kidneys of the COL4A3 -/- mice, adriamycin-treated mice, and mice that undergo<br>
unilateral ureteral obstruction. It is likely that αγβ6 expression also increases in a<br>
variety of kidney injury models.<br>
Anti-αγβ6 monoclonal antibodies can also be tested for their ability<br>
to inhibit tumor growth, progression, and metastasis in such animal models as the<br>
standard in vivo tumor growth and metastasis models. See, e.g., Rockwell et al., J.<br>
Natl. Cancer Inst. 49:735 (1972); Guy et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 12:954(1992);<br>
Wyckoff et al., Cancer Res. 60:2504 (2000); and Oft et al., Curr. Biol. 8:1243<br>
(1998). Important αγβ6 ligands in cancer may include TGF-β, which is involved in<br>
metastasis (for review see Akhurst et al., Trends in Cell Biology 11 :S44-S51<br>
(2001)), fibronectin and vitronectin.<br>
The efficacy of the treatments of this invention may be measured by<br>
a number of available diagnostic tools, including physical examination, blood tests,<br>
proteinuria measurements, creatinine levels and creatinine clearance, pulmonary<br>
function tests, plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, observation and scoring<br>
of scarring or fibrotic lesions, deposition of extracellular matrix such as collagen,<br>
smooth muscle actin and fibronectin, kidney function tests, ultrasound, magnetic<br>
resonance imaging (MRI), and CT scan.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention comprise one or<br>
more antibodies of the present invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives thereof, optionally with any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The<br>
term "carrier" as used herein includes known acceptable adjuvants and vehicles.<br>
According to this invention, the pharmaceutical compositions may<br>
be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example a sterile injectable<br><br>
aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according<br>
to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing, wetting, and suspending<br>
agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be given<br>
orally, topically, intravenously, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly,<br>
intramedullarily, intra-articularly, intra-synovially, intrasternally, intrathecally,<br>
intrahepatically, or intracranially as desired, or just locally at sites of inflammation<br>
or tumor growth. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be<br>
administered by inhalation through the use of, e.g., a nebulizer, a dry powder<br>
inhaler or a metered dose inhaler.<br>
The dosage and dose rate of the antibodies of this invention<br>
effective to produce the desired effects will depend on a variety of factors, such as<br>
the nature of the disease to be treated, the size of the subject, the goal of the<br>
treatment, the specific pharmaceutical composition used, and the judgment of the<br>
treating physician. Dosage levels of between about 0.001 and about 100 mg/kg<br>
body weight per day, for example between about 0.1 and about 50 mg/kg body<br>
weight per day, of the active ingredient compound are useful. For instance, an<br>
antibody of the invention will be administered at a dose ranging between about<br>
0.01 mg/kg body weight/day and about 20 mg/kg body weight/day, e.g., ranging<br>
between about 0.1 mg/kg body weight/day and about 10 mg/kg body weight/day,<br>
and at intervals of every one to fourteen days. In another embodiment, the<br>
antibody is administered at a dose of about 0.3 to 1 mg/kg body weight when<br>
administered intraperitoneally. In yet another embodiment, the antibody is<br>
administered at a dose of about 5 to 12.5 mg/kg body weight when administered<br>
intravenously. In one embodiment, an antibody composition is administered in an<br>
amount effective to provide a plasma level of antibody of at least 1 mg/ml.<br>
Diagnostic Methods<br>
The antibodies of this invention can be used to diagnose diseased<br>
conditions associated with altered αγβ6 expression levels. A tissue sample from a<br>
subject, such as a tissue biopsy, body fluid sample or lavage (e.g., alveolar lavage),<br>
can be tested in an antigen capture assay, ELIS A, immunohistochemistry assay,<br><br>
and the like using the antibodies. A tissue sample from a normal individual is used<br>
as control.<br>
Practice of the present invention will employ, unless indicated<br>
otherwise, conventional techniques of cell biology, cell culture, molecular biology,<br>
microbiology, recombinant DNA, protein chemistry, and immunology, which are<br>
within the skill of the art. Such techniques are described in the literature. See, for<br>

In the following examples, the β6 -I- mice were generated as<br>
described in Huang et al., J. Cell Biol. 133:921 (1996). Recombinant human LAP<br>
was purchased from R &amp; D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibody 10D5 was<br>
purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The L230 hybridoma was purchased<br>
from ATCC and the secreted antibody was purified from the supernatant of<br>
saturated cultures by affinity chromatography on immobilized protein A. Isotyping<br>
of antibodies was carried out using the ISOSTRIP kit (Roche Diagnostics)<br>
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The β6-transfected SW480 cell line<br>
was prepared as described in Weinacker et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:6940-6948<br>
(1994).<br>
Example 1: Generation of β6-transfected stable cell lines<br>
β6-transfected MH 3T3 and FDC-P1 cells were generated by<br>
electroporating parent cell lines with a DNA construct containing full length<br>
murine β6 cDNA and a neomycin selectable marker. Stably transfected cells were<br>
selected by passaging cells in culture medium containing G418 for 14 days<br>
followed by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate cells expressing<br>
the highest level of surface β6. Transfected FDC-Pl cells were cultured in DMEM<br>
supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium<br>
bicarbonate, 4.5 g/1 glucose, and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS, 2.5% mouse<br>
IL-3 culture supplement, and 1.5 mg/ml active G418. Transfected NIH 3T3 cells<br>
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine,<br>
penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml active G418.<br>
Example 2: Purification of human soluble αγβ6<br>
The αγβ6 protein was purified essentially as described in Weinacker,<br>
supra. A CHO cell line expressing hsαγβ6 was cultured, and the resultant<br>
supernatant collected by centrifugation. The integrin was purified by affinity<br><br>
chromatography using anti-αγ antibody L230. Purified L230 was cross-linked to<br>
CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) at a ratio of 4.8 mg antibody/ml resin. The<br>
αγβ6, supernatant was loaded at 0.5 mg antibody/ml resin onto the L230 affinity<br>
column, and the column was washed with 10 column volumes of each of (1) 50<br>
mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5,1 M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2; (2) 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mM<br>
Nad, 1 mM MgCl2; and (3) 10 mM Na3PO4, pH 7.0. Hsαγβ6 was eluted with 100<br>
mM glycine, pH 2.5 into 1:10 volume of 1 M Na3PO4, pH 8.0. The protein was<br>
dialyzed with several changes against phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and stored<br>
at-20°C.<br>
Example 3: Immunization of β6 -/- mice<br>
β6 -/- mice were immunized by intraperitoneal (IP) injection with 25<br>
g of purified recombinant human αγβ6 emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant<br>
(CFA) at a volume ratio of 1:1 in a total volume of 200 μl. Alternatively,β6-/-<br>
mice were immunized via IP injection with 4 X 106 β6-transfected NIH 3T3 cells<br>
resuspended in 100 μl of PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml of CaCl2 and 1 mg/ml<br>
MgCl2, and the same mice were injected at an adjacent site with 100 μl of CFA.<br>
Two weeks and four weeks after the initial immunization, the mice were boosted<br>
similarly with the same reagents with the exception that incomplete Freund's<br>
adjuvant was used in place of CFA. The mice were bled 7 days after the final<br>
boost and anti-β6 titers were determined by binding of the serum to purified<br>
recombinant human αγβ6 or to β6-transfected cells. In the case of mice immunized<br>
with purified recombinant human αγβ6, mice were rested for 3 months and<br>
reimmunized with the same antigen mixed with ImmunEasy (Qiagen). Three days<br>
prior to isolating spleens for hybridoma fusions, the mice were immunized with<br>
12.5 μg of purified recombinant human αγβ6 protein by both IP and intravenous<br>
injection. On day of fusion, the animals were sacrificed, and their spleens were<br>
removed and teased into single cell suspensions. The splenocytes were<br>
immortalized by fusion to a drug-selectable cell fusion partner.<br>
Example 4:- Screening of hvbridomas<br>
Two groups of antibodies were generated through the immunization<br>
of β6 -/- mice. One set of antibodies were generated through immunization with<br>
soluble human truncated αγβ6 (Fusion #6). The other set of antibodies were<br><br>
generated through immunization with murine β6-transfected NIH 3T3 cells (Fusion<br>
#7). Screening for anti-αγβ6 antibodies was carried out using both cell-based and<br>
cell-free binding and functional assays as described below. Initial selection of<br>
positive clones was based on binding to purified hsαγβ6 and β6-transfected human<br>
and murine cells (untransfected cells as control). Selected clones were expanded<br>
and terminal cultures were re-evaluated for binding to both β6-transfected and<br>
untransfected cells in cell capture assays (Example 5b, infra) (representative<br>
examples shown in Figs. 1A and 1B, where the prefixes "6." or "7." of the mAb<br>
names, which denote Fusion 6 and Fusion 7, respectively, are omitted; see also<br>
Table 2 below). Some antibodies bound preferentially to the β6-transfected cells,<br>
while others bound to both transfected and untransfected cells, indicating that only<br>
a subset of the antibodies had a preference for β6 (Figs. 1A and 1B). Further<br>
selection was based on the ability of the antibodies to block binding of both<br>
biotinylated hsαγβ6 and β6-transfected murine cells to LAP. Select clones were<br>
subcloned using FACS and stored frozen until use.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies were screened for specificity of binding to<br>
αγβ6 based on their ability to bind β6-transfected cells and not untransfected parent<br>
cells. Monoclonal antibodies were further confirmed as specific binders of αγβ6<br>
and not of other αγ integrins or non-specific integrins (i.e., non-αγ integrins that<br>
bind to RGD-containing ligands) based on their lack of binding to cell lines<br>
expressing αγβ3, αγβ8, αγβ1, αγβ1 or αγβ1. These included stably transfected cells as<br>
well as untransfected JY, K562, SW480, NIH3T3, and FDCPl cell lines.<br>
Some of the antibodies that have been deposited with the ATCC are<br>
listed below in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Example 5: Assays for screening and characterization<br>
a. αγβ6ELISA<br>
A 96-well microtiter plate (Coming COSTAR EASY-WASH) was<br>
coated with 50 μl/well of 5 μg/ml hsαγβ6 at 4°C overnight. The plate was washed<br>
with wash buffer (0.1% TWEEN-20 in PBS) four times in an automated plate<br>
washer. Then 180 l/well of 3% BSA in TBS was added and incubated for 1 hr at<br>
25°C to block nonspecific binding. The plate was washed as above, and dilutions<br>
of either hybridoma supernatant (for screening assays) or purified antibody (for<br>
characterization) in TBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM CaCh, and 1 mM MgCl2<br>
were added (50 μl/well). The plate was incubated for 1 hr at 25°C, washed, and<br>
then incubated for 1 hr with 50 l/well of peroxide-conjugated goat anti-mouse<br>
IgG+A+M antibody (Cappel). Bound antibody was detected using 3,3',5,5'-<br>
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). Binding was indicated by the absorbency measured at 450 nm.<br>
b. Cell capture assay<br>
A 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 50 μ^well of secondary<br>
antibody (donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch); 5 μg/ml diluted in<br>
50 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.2) at 4°C overnight. Plates were washed twice with 100 μl/well of assay buffer (RPMI + 2% BSA) and then blocked with 100<br>
μl/well of the assay buffer at 37°C for 1 hr. For FDC-Pl cells and β6-transfected<br>
FDC-P1 cells, plates were blocked with anti-mouse Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch;<br><br>
20 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature to decrease non-specific Fc receptor<br>
binding by secondary antibody (omitted for other cell types). While the plates<br>
were being blocked, the cells were labeled with 2 μM fluorescent dye (Calcein-<br>
AM, Molecular Probes) in the assay buffer at 5 X 106 cells/ml. The cells were<br>
incubated with the dye in the assay buffer with gentle shaking in a 37ºC water bath<br>
for 15 min, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in assay buffer to 5 X 106<br>
cells/ml. Following the blocking step, the buffer was discarded by flicking the<br>
plate, and 25 μg/well of supernatant or purified antibody was added to the plate.<br>
Following a 15 min incubation at 37°C, 25 μl/well of labeled cells were added, and<br>
the plate was incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. The plate was washed 3-5 times with the<br>
assay buffer (100 μg/well) and fluorescence emitted by captured cells on the plate<br>
was recorded. Percent binding was determined by comparing the fluorescence<br>
prior to the final wash step (i.e., total cells added) to that after washing (i.e. bound<br>
cells).<br>
c.	FACS<br>
Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed one time in PBS,<br>
and then resuspended in FACS buffer (IX PBS, 2% FBS, 0.1% NaN3, 1 mM<br>
CaCl2, and 1 mM MgC12). 0.2 X lO5 cells were then incubated on ice for 1 hr in<br>
FACS buffer containing hybridoma supernatant in a total volume of 100 μl. After<br>
incubation, the cells were washed two times with ice cold FACS buffer,<br>
resuspended in 100 μl of FACS buffer containing 5 μg/ml donkey anti-mouse IgG<br>
PE (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were<br>
then washed twice with ice cold FACS buffer and resuspended in 200 μl of FACS<br>
buffer. Binding of the PE labeled secondary antibody was monitored by flow<br>
cytometry.<br>
d.	Binding of biotin-hsαγβ6 to LAP<br>
96-well microtiter plates (Corning COSTAR EASY-WASH) were<br>
coated with 0.3 g/ml recombinant human LAP (R&amp;D Systems, Cat. # 246-LP)<br>
diluted in PBS (50 μg/well) at 4°C overnight. After the coating solution was<br>
removed, the plates were blocked with 180 μg/well of 3% BSA/TBS at 25°C for 1<br>
hr. In a separate 96-well round-bottom plate, 60 μl/well of a 2X stock (0.5 g/ml<br>
(1.25 nM) of biotin-αγβ6, 2 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM MgCl2 in TBS containing 1<br><br>
mg/ml BSA) was combined with 60 μ^well of a 2X stock of either a hybridoma<br>
supernatant (for screening) or a purified antibody (also in TBS containing 1 rng/inl<br>
BSA) and incubated at 25°C for 1 hr. After washing the LAP-coated plate with<br>
wash buffer (0.1% TWEEN-20 in PBS) 4 times in an automated plate washer, 100<br>
l of the antibody-αγβ6 mixture was transferred to the plate, and incubated for 1 hr<br>
at 25°C. The plate was washed as above and incubated with 50 μl/well of a 1:1000<br>
dilution of extravidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in TBS (1 mg/ml<br>
BSA) for 1 hr at 25°C. Bound protein was detected using the TMB substrate.<br>
e.	Adhesion of β6-FDC-Pl cells to LAP<br>
A 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 50 μl/well of 0.5 μg/ml<br>
recombinant human LAP (R&amp;D Systems) diluted in 50 mM sodium bicarbonate,<br>
pH 9.2 at 4°C overnight. The plate was washed twice with PBS (100 μl/well) and<br>
blocked with 1% BSA in PBS (100 μg/well) for 1 hr at 25°C. The plate was<br>
washed twice with 100 μg/well of assay buffer (TBS complete plus 1 mM CaCl2<br>
and 1 mM MgCl2). Next, to the individual wells of the plate were added 25 μl of a<br>
hybridoma supernatant (or a purified antibody) and 25 μl of β6-FDC-Pl cells (5X<br>
106 cells/ml, labeled with Calcein AM as described above). The plate was<br>
incubated at 25°C for 1 hr, and then washed 4-6 times with the assay buffer (100<br>
μl/well). The fluorescence emitted from cells captured on the plate was recorded.<br>
Percentage binding was determined by comparing the fluorescence signal prior to<br>
the final wash step (i.e., total cells added) to that after washing (i.e., bound cells).<br>
f.	TGF-β bioassay<br>
The TGF-β bioassay used herein was a variation of the Mink lung<br>
epithelial cell (MLEC) PAI-1 luciferase coculture assay described in Abe et al.,<br>
Anal. Biochem. 216:276-284 (1994), in which β6-transfected cells were cocultured<br>
with the reporter cells to monitor activation of TGF-β by αvβ6 (Munger, supra). It<br>
is a quantitative bioassay for TGF-β based on its ability to induce the expression of<br>
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In this assay, MLEC cells are stably<br>
transfected with an expression construct containing a truncated PAI-1 promoter<br>
fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Exposure of the transfected MLEC<br>
cells to active TGF-β (0.2 to &gt; 30 pM) results in a dose-dependent increase in<br>
luciferase activity in the cell lysates.<br><br>
To conduct this assay, TMLC (mink lung epithelial cell line Mv 1<br>
Lu) cells were transfected with the PAI-1-luciferase construct. The transfected<br>
cells were grown in DMEM + 10% FBS with L-Gln, Pen/Strep and 200 μg/ml<br>
G418. SW480 cells transfected with an integrin &amp; construct ("β6-SW480" or<br>
"SW480 β6" cells) were grown in DMEM + 10% FBS with L-Gln and Pen/Strep.<br>
Cells were lifted from flasks with PBS + 5 mM EDTA, washed in PBS + 0.5%<br>
BSA, counted by hemocytometer and plated in 96-well plates. SW480-β6 cells<br>
were plated at 4 X 104 cells/well in the wash buffer. Monoclonal antibodies were<br>
diluted in DMEM (serum-free), added to the SW480-β6 cells and pre-incubated for<br>
20 min at room temperature. TMLC cells were then added at 2 X 104 cells/well to<br>
a final volume of 100 l. The plates were incubated for 20 hr in a humidified,<br>
CO2-enriched incubator. Supernatant from the plates was discarded and replaced<br>
with 100 μl of PBS + 1 mM Ca2+ and 1 mM Mg2+. Cells in the plates were then<br>
lysed, and the level of luciferase activity was detected with the glow-type reaction<br>
Packard LUCLITE kit (#6016911) and TROPIX microplate luminometer.<br>
Example 6: Antibody purification<br>
Eight hybridoma clones from Fusion #6 (denoted by the prefix "6.")<br>
and fourteen hybridoma clones from Fusion #7 (denoted by the prefix "7.") were<br>
selected for further scale-up and characterization (Table 2).<br>
A small-scale culture (150 ml) of each hybridoma was prepared,<br>
and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation. Antibodies were purified<br>
from these supematants using Protein A affinity chromatography. For the IgG2a<br>
isotype antibodies, the supernatant was directly loaded onto Protein A Sepharose 4<br>
Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, AB, Uppsala, Sweden) (1 ml settled bed<br>
volume). The column was washed with PBS, and the IgG fraction was eluted<br>
using 25 mM phosphoric acid, 100 mM NaCl, pH 2.8 into 1:20 volume of 0.5 M<br>
Na3PO4, pH 8.6. For the murine IgG1 antibodies, the supernatant was adjusted to<br>
1.5 M glycine, 3 M NaCl, pH 8.9 prior to loading, and the column was washed<br>
with 25 mM Na3PO4, 3 M NaCl, pH 8.6 prior to elution. These preparations were<br>
used for the in vitro biochemical characterization described herein.<br><br><br><br>
*: A blocker is defined as an antibody that blocks the binding of αvβ6 to LAP as<br>
determined by blocking of ligand binding either to purified hsαvβ6 or to β6-<br>
expressing cells.<br>
For use in animal models, hybridoma clones were scaled up to 2L of<br>
media and grown for 4 weeks in Lifecell Culture Bags-PL732 (Nexell, Cat. No.<br>
R4R2113). Antibodies from the hybridomas were purified first by Protein A<br>
affinity chromatography as described above, followed by an ion-exchange step on<br>
Q Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia). The eluate from the Protein A<br>
chromatographic step was adjusted to pH 8.6 using 2 M Tris base, diluted 10-fold<br>
with water, and loaded onto a Q Sepharose column (20 mg protein/ml resin) that<br>
had been equilibrated in 10 mM Na3PO4, 25 mM NaCl, pH 8.6. The column was<br>
washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer, and bound protein was<br>
eluted using 25 mM Na3PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2. The eluted proteins were<br>
sterile-filtered (0.45 μm) and stored at -70°C until use.<br>
Example 7: Characterization of purified antibodies<br>
The purified antibodies (Table 2, supra) were characterized<br>
quantitatively with respect to their ability to (1) bind hsαvβ6, (2) bind β6-transfected<br>
SW480 and FDC-Pl cells, (3) inhibit binding of biotin-αvβ6 to LAP, (4) inhibit<br>
binding of β6-transfected FDC-Pl cells to LAP, and (5) block αvβ6-mediated<br>
activation of TGF-β in the MLEC assay (supra). The relative potency in each of<br>
these assays was compared to that of the known αvβ6 antibody 10D5 (Huang et al,<br>
J. Cell Sci. 111:2189 (1998)) and, in some cases, the anti-αv antibody L230. For<br>
the characterization of Fusion #7 antibodies, the Fusion #6 antibody 6.8G6 was<br>
also used as a positive control.<br>
An initial binding experiment (Example 5a, supra), carried out in<br>
the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ and 1 mM Mg2+, indicated that a majority of the<br>
purified antibodies bound to hsαvβ6 (Figs. 2A and 2B). Unexpectedly, however, no<br>
binding was observed for 10D5 and clones 7.2F5 and 7.10D7. A subsequent<br>
experiment established that binding of 10D5 (Fig. 3E), 7.2F5, and 7.10D7 was<br>
supported only weakly by Ca2+/Mg2+, but much more strongly by 1 mM MnCl2.<br>
Among the new clones, three (6.1 A8 (Fig. 3A), 7.7G5, and 6.8G6 (Fig. 3C))<br>
showed a requirement for divalent cations, although no difference between the<br>
Ca2+/Mg2+ state and the Mn2+-bound state was observed.<br><br>
The remaining clones showed no requirement for divalent cations,<br>
i.e. could bind to the antigen in the presence of 10 mM EDTA (Figs. 3B, 3D and<br>
3F). FACS analysis of antibody binding to β6-transfected NIH 3T3 cells or SW480<br>
cells revealed a similar pattern, with the exception that 10D5, in this context,<br>
bound equivalently in the Ca2+/Mg2+ and Mn2+ states. The requirements for<br>
binding to soluble αvβ6 may differ from those for binding to cell surface-expressed<br>
αvβ6 due to a difference in protein conformation or avidity effects.<br>
These results suggest that there are at least 3 different classes of β6-<br>
blocking antibodies in this group. One of the classes (10D5) distinguishes between<br>
the Ca2+/Mg2+ and Mn2+ conditions. Another class (including 6.1 A8, 7.7G5, and<br>
6.8G6) requires cation but does not distinguish between Ca2+/Mg2+ and Mn2+. The<br>
last class (including anti-ct, antibody L230, 6.2B10, 6.3G9 (Fig. 3B), and 6.2B1<br>
(Fig. 3D), 7.1C5, and 7..1G10) is cation-independent.<br>
The purified antibodies were next evaluated for their ability to<br>
inhibit the αvβ6-LAP interaction. In the cell-free assay of Example 5d, supra,<br>
antibodies 6.1A8, 6.2B1, 6.3G9, and 6.8G6 showed IC50 values lower than that of<br>
10D5 (Fig. 4A; Table 3). 6.2B10 showed a higher IC50 but still gave complete<br>
inhibition (Fig. 4A). 6.4B4 showed only partial inhibition, whereas 6.6B5 and<br>
6.8B4 showed no inhibition (Fig. 4A). Using the same assay system, antibodies<br>
7.1C5, 7.1G10, 7.2A1, 7.4A3, 7.7G5, 7.9G8, 7.9H5, and 7.10H2 showed IC50<br>
values lower than that of 10D5 (Fig. 4B; Table 3). Antibodies 7.2F5, 7.2H2 and<br>
7.8H12 displayed nearly identical or higher IC50 values and yet still gave complete<br>
inhibition (Fig. 4B).<br>
In the cellular assay described in Example 5e, supra, a similar trend<br>
was observed, with the exceptions of 6.1 A8,6.2B10 and 7.9D4, which were much<br>
less potent on cells than on purified protein (Figs. 5A-E; Table 3).<br>
Collectively, these results indicate that we have successfully<br>
generated antibodies that specifically inhibit the interaction of both human and<br>
murine αvβ6 with LAP. Some of these antibodies bound to αvβ6 with high affinity<br>
(apparent Kd's ≥0.3 nM, as determined by flow cytometry), inhibited binding of<br>
β6-transfected cells to LAP with an IC50 of ≥0.05 nM (8 ng/mL), and prevented<br>
αvβ6-mediated activation of TGF-β1 with an IC50 of ≥0.58 nM (87 ng/mL).<br><br>
Finally, the purified antibodies were evaluated for their ability to<br>
block αvβ6-mediated activation of TGF-/3 in the PAI-1/luciferase reporter gene<br>
assay (Example 5f, supra). Once again, 6.3G9, 6.8G6,6.2B1,7.1G10, and 7.7G5<br>
were able to inhibit αvβ6-mediated activation of TGF-β with IC50 values lower than<br>
10D5, while the remaining antibodies appeared to be significantly less potent in<br>
this assay (Figs. 6A and 6B; Table 3). Thus, the ability to block αvβ6's interaction<br>
with LAP correlates with the ability to inhibit activation of TGF-β in vitro.<br><br><br><br>
dilutions of the soluble integrin (1 X 10-8 M to 2.4 X 10-12 M) were incubated with<br>
1X 10-10 M of the antibody for 3 h. These samples were then passed through<br>
polymethylmethacrylate beads coated with the integrin using a KinExA instrument<br>
(Sapidynelnstruments, Inc., Boise, Idaho). In the case of 6.8G6, 1mM CaCl2 and<br>
1mM MgCl2 were included in the incubation and assay buffers. The amounts of<br>
bound and free antibody were determined using a Cy5-labeled anti-mouse<br>
secondary antibody. Quadratic curve fitting was performed using the KinExA<br>
software to attain a dissociation constant (Kd) for each interaction. The Kd's<br>
determined using this method were 15.6 pM for 6.3G9 and 22.8 pM for 6.8G6<br>
(Figs. 9 A and 9B). Thus, both of these antibodies had very high affinities for αvβ6-<br>
We further identified classes of anti-αvβ6 antibodies that recognized<br>
"activated" states of the integrin. There are two potential activation states of αvβ6-<br>
In the first state, the activated integrin is defined as having a higher affinity for its<br>
ligand. Antibodies specific for this activated state showed enhanced binding to the<br>
integrin in the presence of activating cations such as 1 mM MnCl2. A comparison<br>
of the extent of binding in 1 mM MnCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2 (non-activating cation)<br>
by flow cytometry indicated that some of the αvβ6 antibodies described here,<br>
including 6.1 A8 and 6.6B5, showed significantly enhanced binding in the presence<br>
of MnCl2.<br><br>
In a second activated state of αvβ6, the integrin can activate latent<br>
TGF-β as described above. A cell line expressing truncated αvβ6 (SW480(β6-<br>
770T)) was prepared. The cell line was able to bind LAP but could not activate<br>
TGF-β in the TMLC luciferase assay (Munger et al., supra). Antibodies which<br>
bind to the full length β6-transfected SW480 cells, but not to the 770T truncated<br>
transfected cells, were thus specific to the form of αvβ6 that is able to activate<br>
TGF-β. Antibodies 7.8B3 and 7.8C9 met this criteria.<br>
Example 8: Epitope mapping by antibody competition<br>
The purified monoclonal antibodies were also tested for their ability<br>
to compete with 6.8G6 for binding to biotinylated αvβ6 in an ELISA format. In this<br>
assay, 6.8G6 was coated on an ELISA plate, and a mixture of the competing<br>
antibody and biotinylated αvβ6 was added in a buffer containing 1 mM each of Ca2+<br>
and Mg2+. Bound integrin was detected using extravidin-HRP conjugate, and<br>
competing antibodies were scored for their ability to block binding. All consensus<br>
blockers (Table 2) except 6.2B10 (a weak blocker) were shown to be able to<br>
compete with 6.8G6 to various degrees (Table 4). These data confirm that these<br>
consensus blockers bind to the same or overlapping epitope as 6.8G6.<br><br><br><br>
The purified monoclonal antibodies were tested for their ability to<br>
compete with biotinylated 6.3G9 or biotinylated 6.8G6 for binding to αvβ6 in<br>
ELISA. In this assay, unlabeled αvβ6 was coated on an ELISA plate, and a mixture<br>
of the competing antibody and the biotinylated antibody was added in a buffer<br>
containing 1 mM each of Ca2+ and Mg2+. Bound biotinylated antibody was<br>
detected by using neutravidin-HRP conjugate. The data showed that the most<br>
potent blocking antibodies (e.g., 6.2B1, 7.1C5, and 7.1G10) competed with both<br>
6.3G9 and 6.8G6 for binding to αvβ6 (Table 4.1, and Figs. 10A and 10B).<br>
Antibodies 6.1A8 and 7.7G5 showed less competition, probably due to their lower<br>
affinity for αvβ6. None of the non-blocking antibodies or the anti-αv antibody<br>
L230 showed any competition with 6.3G9 or 6.8G6 in this assay. These results<br>
indicate that the αvβ6-specific blocking antibodies bind to the same or overlapping<br>
epitopes on αvβ6.<br><br><br><br>
Example 9: CDR sequences<br>
The cDNAs for some of the purified monoclonal antibodies were<br>
isolated and sequenced using standard techniques as described in Coligan et al.<br>
(eds), Current Protocols in Immunology, Wiley, Media, PA (2001). The deduced<br>
amino acid sequences are shown in Figs. 7A and 7B.<br>

As shown in Figs. 7A and 7B, the mAbs that fall into the divalent<br>
cation-dependent class (e.g., 6.1A8 and 6.8G6) seem to contain very similar amino<br>
acid sequences within the CDRs, while the divalent cation-independent mAbs<br>
(e.g., 6.2B1 and 6.3G9) contain another set of motifs in their CDRs.<br><br>
The potency and specificity of ami-αvβ6 monoclonal antibodies may<br>
be governed by subtly different amino acid residues. In the case of 6.1A8 and<br>
6.8G6, the amino acid sequences of the variable domains are very similar,<br>
containing 10 amino acid differences in the heavy chain, three of which are<br>
conservative, and 11 amino acid differences in the light chain. Yet these<br>
antibodies have a roughly 100-fold difference in activity in in vitro assays. The<br>
amino acid differences are dispersed throughout the variable domains of the<br>
polypeptide chains and these residues may function alone or synergistically with<br>
residues on the same chain or the partner chain to affect the potency of the<br>
antibodies. In the heavy chain, seven residues are located such that they are likely<br>
to be in close proximity to, or play an active role in binding to, αvβ6.<br>
An RGD motif is found in a number of integrin-binding proteins<br>
(ligands). This motif has been shown to mediate their interaction with integrins by<br>
directly contacting the binding pocket on the integrin. Because RGD itself is fairly<br>
common among integrin-binding proteins, flanking residues outside the motif must<br>
play a role in conferring binding specificity to the integrin-ligand interaction. In<br>
6.1A8 and 6.8G6, one such flanking residue is at position 101 in the heavy chain,<br>
within CDR3. This amino acid residue flanks the RGD motif and may be located<br>
at the site of antigen recognition, contributing to binding potency and specificity.<br>
Other different residues within the same heavy chain CDRs of<br>
6.1A8 and 6.8G6 include those at positions 33 (CDR1); positions 52, 57, and 65<br>
(CDR2); and position 115 (CDR3). Another difference in the heavy chain lies at<br>
position 4 in framework 1, which is near the N-terminus. This residue is predicted<br>
by crystallographic models to fold close to the CDRs of the antibody and may play<br>
an important role in αvβ6 binding. The three remaining differences between 6.1A8<br>
and 6.8G6 are conservative differences at positions 20 (framework 1), 44<br>
(framework 2) and 82 (framework 3).<br>
The amino acid sequences of the cation-independent antibodies are<br>
also highly homologous. They can be divided into two classes: those that compete<br>
with the RGD-containing antibody 6.8G6 (i.e., 6.2B1, 6.3G9, 7.10H2, 7.9H5,<br>
7.1C5,7.1G10, and 7.4A3); and those that do not (i.e., 6.2A1, 6..2B10 and 6.4B4).<br>
The 6.8G6-competing class contains a FXY motif in CDR3 of the heavy chain,<br><br>
whereas the noncompeting class does not. This difference suggests that the FXY<br>
motif is important for mediating cation-independent binding to αvβ6. Additionally,<br>
this FXY-containing class of antibodies probably bind to an epitope on αvβ6 that is<br>
overlapping with, yet distinct from, the RGD-binding pocket. Antibodies 6.2B10<br>
and 6.4B4 do not contain an FXY motif and are poor αvβ6 blockers. They were<br>
shown to bind to the αvβ6 I-domain-like portion and define yet another epitope to<br>
which anti-αvβ6 antibodies bind. Interestingly, the monoclonal antibody 6.2A1<br>
belongs to the cation-independent class but does not contain the RGD sequence, as<br>
with other cation-independent mAbs.<br>
Monoclonal antibody 7.7G5 belongs to the cation-dependent class.<br>
However, the light chain sequence of 7.7G5 is highly homologous to the cation-<br>
independent, I-domain binding antibody 6.2B10. The heavy chain of 7.7G5 is also<br>
similar to cation-independent antibodies in CDRl. Yet its CDR2 and CDR3 are<br>
more similar to those of the cation-dependent class. This observation suggests that<br>
specific CDRs confer specificity to an antibody. This is particularly true for CDR3<br>
of the heavy chain, presumably due to the high degree of variability within this part<br>
of the antibody. In fact, two out of three cation-dependent and seven out of nine<br>
cation-independent antibodies contain heavy chain CDR3 sequences that are likely<br>
to play an important role in αvβ6 recognition. Of note, 7.7G5 lacks an RGD motif<br>
but contains an XGD motif in its heavy chain CDR2. This XGD motif may<br>
function in a similar fashion to RGD and confer binding affinity/specificity to<br>
7.7G5.<br>
The above sequence observations and inferences made therefrom<br>
provide a basis for rational design of specific variable region amino acid sequences<br>
that confer specific binding properties.<br>

Antibodies that can detect αvβ6 expression in paraffin-embedded<br>
tissue sections or other tissue samples may be useful as diagnostics. These<br>
diagnostic tools can be used to, e.g., detect upregulated αvβ6 in tissue sections for<br>
such indications as cancer or fibrosis.<br>
In order to identify antibodies that detect αvβ6 in paraffin-embedded<br>
tissues, we first screened a panel of antibodies for binding to HPLC-purified β6<br><br>
subunit. Antibodies which bind this subunit are likely recognizing linear peptide<br>
epitopes, and were therefore expected to have a greater likelihood for success in<br>
paraffin-embedded tissues. Binding to purified β6 subunit was carried out using an<br>
ELISA format identical to that described for measuring αv binding (supra),<br>
except with the purified β6 integrin, rather than the αvβ6 protein, immobilized on<br>
the plate. Using this method, a number of Fusion 6 antibodies capable of binding<br>
both the purified αvβ6 protein and the purified β6 subunit were identified. See<br>
Table 5, infra, where the prefix "6." in the clone names is omitted.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As shown above, some antibodies bound to purified β6 subunit.<br>
They will have a high likelihood to bind to denatured αvβ6 and thus can be useful in<br>
detecting αvβ6 in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Other antibodies bound to<br>
soluble αvβ6 but not the β6 subunit. Both types of antibodies were used to stain<br>
denatured paraffin-embedded β6-transfected SW480 cells and untransfected parent<br>
cells, and the data are shown in Table 6.<br>
To stain paraffin-embedded tissues or cells, the sample slides were<br>
first de-paraffinized by incubation in the following solutions: (1) Xylene, 5 min,<br>
twice; (2) 100% ethanol, 2 min, twice; (3) 95% ethanol, 2 min, twice; (4) 50%<br>
ethanol, 2 min, once; and (5) distilled water, 2 min, once. The slides were then<br>
incubated in a solution consisting of 200 ml of methanol and 3 ml of 30% H2O2 for<br>
15 min to block endogenous peroxidase. The slides were rinsed twice in PBS for 2<br>
min each time. The paraffin sections on the slides were then unmasked with<br>
pepsin (Zymed 00-3009) for 5 min at 37°C. The slides were rinsed again twice in<br>
PBS for 2 min each time. Next, the slides were blocked with avidin and then<br>
biotin (Vector SP-2001; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), 10 min each at<br>
room temperature, with washing between each incubation as described above.<br>
After the blocking solution was drained off the slides, the primary antibody<br>
(hybridoma culture supernatant) diluted in PBS/0.1% BSA was applied to the<br>
slides and incubated overnight at 4°C.<br><br>
The next day, the slides were rinsed in PBS as described above.<br>
Meanwhile, the avidin-biotin complex-horseradish peroxidase solution (ABC<br>
reagent) was prepared as follows: 1 ml of PBS was mixed with 20 /l of solution A<br>
(1:50) and 20 l of solution B (1:50) from Vector Kit PK-6102; and the mixture<br>
was incubated for 30 min at room temperature before use. During this time, the<br>
slides were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with anti-mouse-biotinylated<br>
antibody (1:200) from the Vector Kit with 15 μl/ml normal serum. The slides were<br>
then rinsed twice in PBS, 2 min each time. Then the above-described ABC reagent<br>
was applied to the slides and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The slides<br>
were rinsed again as described above. Then the substrate (Vector SK-4100), 100<br>
μl of DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine), were applied to the slides and incubated for 5<br>
min at room temperature. DAB was prepared as follows: to 5 ml of H2O, add 2<br>
drops of Buffer Stock Solution, mix well; then add 4 drops of DAB Stock solution,<br>
mix well; and then add 2 drops of H2O2 Solution, mix well. Then the slides were<br>
rinsed in running water for 2 min. Next, the DAB signal was enhanced for all<br>
slides as follows: rinse the paraffin sections in 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6,<br>
for 10 min; blot excess buffer, apply the DAB Enhancing Solution 15 seconds; and<br>
then quickly rinse with water for 1 min to stop reaction. The slides were then<br>
stained in Mayer's Hematoxylin (a nuclear counterstain) for 1 min. The slides<br>
were rinsed in running water for 1 min, and then submerged in PBS for 1 min so<br>
that the hematoxylin turned blue. The slides were then rinsed again in running<br>
water for 1 min and dehydrated and cleared as follows: submerge in (1) 95%<br>
ethanol for 1 min, twice; (2) 100% ethanol for 1 min, twice; and (3) Xylene for 2<br>
min, twice. Coverslips were then applied to the slides using permount.<br>
The results suggested that Fusion 6 antibodies 1A1, 2C4, 3B2,<br>
3B11, 5D6, 5G9, 5H3, 6D12, 7C7, 9B5, 9B7, 9D11, 9F5, 10E4, 10H11, 6H8, 7A5,<br>
7G9, 9A3, 2A1, 2E5,4E4, 4H4, 8B4, 2G2, and 4E6, all of which could bind to<br>
purified β6 subunit (Table 5), indeed stained paraffin-embedded β6-transfected<br>
SW480 cells strongly, while not staining untransfected parent cells (Table 6).<br><br><br><br><br>
Example 11: Diagnosis of cancer<br>
αvβ6 is normally expressed at negligible to low levels in healthy<br>
adult tissues. However, αvβ6 expression is upregulated in injury, fibrosis, and<br>
cancer (see, e.g., Thomas et al. J. Invest. Dermatology 117:67-73 (2001); Brunton<br>
et al., Neoplasia 3: 215-226 (2001); Agrez et al., Int. J. Cancer 81:90-97 (1999);<br>
Breuss, J. Cell Science 108:2241-2251 (1995)). Thus, antibodies that bind<br>
specifically to αvβ6 expressed on paraffin-embedded tissues can be used in standard<br>
immunohistochemistry techniques to detect αvβ6 expression for diagnosis of<br>
fibrosis, cancer and any other diseases in which αvβ6 is upregulated.<br>
As described above, certain antibodies of the present invention bind<br>
to HPLC-purified β6 integrin and paraffin-embedded and fixed β6-transfected cells.<br>
These antibodies were also shown to bind to representative squamous and breast<br>
cancer tissues in immunostaining. See, e.g., Fig. 8, where monoclonal antibody<br>
6.2A1 was used to show relative staining of paraffin-embedded breast and<br>
squamous carcinomas. Thus, these new antibodies are useful as diagnostic tools.<br>
Example 12: Effects of anti-αvβ6 blocking mAbs in Alport mice<br>
The collagen 4A3 (COL4A3) knockout (Alport) mice have been<br>
established as an in vivo model for kidney fibrosis and used to test the therapeutic<br>
effects of pharmacological agents (supra). We tested mAb 6.8G6 (cation-<br>
dependent) and 6.3G9 (cation-independent) in Alport mice to determine if they<br>
would inhibit the fibrosis normally observed in seven week old Alport mice. As<br>
shown above, these two antibodies were found to inhibit αvβ6 binding to LAP and<br>
to inhibit activation of TGF-β in a bioassay. Antibody 1E6 was used as a negative<br>
control.<br>
Three week old Alport mice were given intraperitoneal injections 3<br>
times a week with one of the following antibodies: (1) 6.8G6,4mg/kg (7 mice); (2)<br><br>
6.3G9,4 mg/kg (4 mice); and (3) 1E6, 1mg/kg (6 mice). The injections were<br>
continued for 4 weeks. The mice were then sacrificed, and their kidneys retrieved.<br>
Paraffin-embedded sections of the kidneys were made as described<br>
above, and then stained to detect smooth muscle actin, a marker for myoblasts and<br>
matrix deposition in kidney fibrosis. We found a significant decrease in smooth<br>
muscle actin staining in both the interstitial and glomerular regions of the kidney<br>
from the Alport mice treated with mAb 6.8G6 or 6.3G9, as compared to mice<br>
treated with 1E6.<br>
Figs. 11A and 11B show a dot plot of smooth muscle actin staining<br>
in the glomerular and interstitial regions of the Alport kidney. There was<br>
significantly reduced smooth muscle actin staining in the kidneys of the Alport<br>
mice treated with 6.8G6 and 6.3G9, as compared to negative control lE6-treated<br>
mice.<br>
Example 13: Effectiveness of anti-αvβ6 mAbs in preventing unilateral ureteral<br>
obstruction-induced nephrosclerosis<br>
We used another mouse model for renal fibrotic progression to test<br>
the antifibrotic efficacy of 6.8G6 and 6.3G9. In this mouse model, a ureter of the<br>
animal is ligated, resulting in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). UUO causes<br>
progressive nephrosclerosis without near-term renal failure in mice because the<br>
unobstructed kidney can maintain relatively normal renal function. While the<br>
obstructed kidney undergoes rapid global fibrosis, the unobstructed kidney<br>
undergoes adaptive hypertrophy.<br>
This study quantitated morphometrically the impact of anti-αvβ6<br>
treatment on UUO-induced renal fibrosis. Male, 8-12 week old, viral antigen-free<br>
C57BL mice of 25.5±0.2 g in weight (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were<br>
used. The mice were allowed to accommodate for seven days prior to beginning<br>
the study. The mice had ad libitum access to irradiated standard mouse chow and<br>
sterile water throughout the accommodation and experimental period. Body<br>
weight was measured at intervals as part of animal health monitoring. The results<br>
showed that age-matched unoperated mice gained about 10% body weight over the<br>
two-week study period. UUO mice lost about 9% body weight by day 2 but<br><br>
gradually regained the lost body weight by day 14. This weight change pattern<br>
occurred irrespective of therapeutic treatment.<br>
To induce renal fibrosis, the left ureter was aseptically isolated via a<br>
left-of-midline laparotomy under ketamine:xylazine (100:10 mg/kg s.c.)<br>
anesthesia. Two tight, occlusive 6-0 silk ligatures were placed on the ureter at the<br>
level of the lower pole of the kidney, and the ureter cut between the ligatures. The<br>
abdominal wall was closed with 4-0 Vicryl suture and the skin closed with 4-0<br>
nylon. The animals were allowed to recover on a heating pad and given 0.05<br>
mg/kg s.c. buprenorphine twice daily on days 0 and 1. The procedure was adapted<br>
from Ma et al., Kidney Int. 53 (4):937-944 (1998).<br>
The mice were then divided into the following study groups:<br><br>
All animals except those in Group 5 were dosed twice weekly beginning on the<br>
day before surgery.<br>
The animals were then euthanized with carbon dioxide at day 10<br>
after ligation and dissected. In UUO mice, the renal pelvis and ureter were<br>
markedly swollen and fluid-filled above the obstructing ligature. The degree of<br>
swelling and extent of remaining renal tissue mass varied among treatment groups.<br>
Group 2 showed about half as much swelling as negative control groups. Ligated<br>
kidneys were pale in color. Contralateral kidneys were bright red and enlarged by<br>
about one third.<br>
Next, both kidneys (left ligated, right unligated) of the animals were<br>
removed and halved transversely through the center of the renal pelvis. One half<br>
of each kidney was placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for fixed-tissue<br><br>
staining. The other half of each kidney was placed in 15% sucrose, followed by<br>
30% sucrose, for immunohistochemical staining.<br>
Formalin-fixed kidney sections were immunostained for<br>
myofibroblasts (smooth muscle actin), a marker of fibrosis. Images were captured<br>
using standardized lighting conditions and digital cameral exposure settings,<br>
corrected for background, and calibrated to distance standards. Images of<br>
contiguous fields covering the entire left kidney section were taken from each<br>
animal for quantitation.<br>
Smooth muscle actin was expressed as a percent of total tissue area<br>
within the measured fields. These included all cortical and medullary tissue from<br>
the section except the renal papilla.<br>
In conclusion, mice treated with 6.3G9 and 6.8G6 show a<br>
significant reduction in fibrosis.<br>
Example 14: Effectiveness of anti-αvβ6 blocking mAbs against bleomycin-induced<br>
lung fibrosis in mice<br>
Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice has been established as an<br>
in vivo model for lung fibrosis and used to test the therapeutic effects of<br>
pharmacological agents. Inflammation is normally evident 5-15 days following<br>
bleomycin treatment. In 129 strain mice, the degree of pulmonary fibrosis<br>
progressively increases for up to 60 days after bleomycin treatment. Matrix<br>
accumulation usually becomes detectable around day 15. In this example, mAb<br>
6.3G9 was injected intraperitoneally at a concentration of 4 mg/kg/dose into mice<br>
with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis starting at day 0 or day 15, three times<br>
weekly. Lung fibrosis was induced at day 0 by administering a single intratracheal<br>
dose of bleomycin at a concentration of 0.03 units/kg in 50 μl of sterile saline. The<br>
animals were sacrificed at day 30 and the extent of lung fibrosis was assessed.<br>
Antibody 1E6 was used as a negative control.<br>
Lungs were harvested from each animal and hydroxyproline content<br>
was measured as an index of lung collagen deposition, as described in Monger et<br>
al., supra. As shown in Fig. 15 A, treatment with 6.3G9 beginning at day 0<br>
significantly inhibited the bleomycin-induced increase in lung hydroxyproline<br>
content. Importantly, the 6.3G9 treatment was at least as effective when it began<br><br>
15 days after bleomycin administration, a time when collagen deposition had<br>
already begun.<br>
We also examined the effects of 6.3G9, cation-dependent 6.8G6,<br>
and the non-blocking antibody 6.4B4 in inhibiting more substantial degrees of lung<br>
fibrosis in an extended bleomycin-induced fibrosis protocol (lasting 60 days). To<br>
do this, we started the antibody treatments 15 days after bleomycin administration<br>
(day 15). Lungs were then harvested at day 60 to determine hydroxyproline<br>
content. As shown by Fig. 15C, treatment with 6.8G6 significantly inhibited<br>
bleomycin-induced fibrosis (a more than 70% reduction in hyrdroxyproline content<br>
compared to animals treated with bleomycin and saline). Treatment with 6.3G9<br>
also showed a trend toward protection, but these results did not reach statistical<br>
significance (Fig. 15C).<br>
In conclusion, both cation-dependent and cation-independent anti-<br>
αvβ6 blocking mAbs reduced lung fibrosis in mice treated with bleomycin.<br>
Furthermore, this intervention was effective even when antibody treatment was not<br>
initiated until after the initial onset of fibrosis.<br>
Example 15: Upregulation of αvβ6 in human psoriasis lesions<br>
In order to determine whether αvβ6 is involved in psoriasis, αvβ6<br>
expression was examined on lesional and nonlesional skin biopsies from five<br>
psoriasis patients and four normal individuals. Using mAb 6.2A1 immunostaining,<br>
we found a significant increase in αvβ6 expression in psoriatic lesions, as compared<br>
to nonlesional skin from psoriatic patients and normal controls. Thus, the<br>
upregulation of αvβ6 in psoriatic lesions suggests both diagnostic and therapeutic<br>
implication for the use of anti-αvβ6 antibodies.<br>
Example 16: Upregulation of αvβ6 in mouse and human liver with biliary duct<br>
disease<br>
As previously discussed, αvβ6 expression has been implicated in<br>
tissue injury. In this study, expression of αvβ6 was investigated in mouse and<br>
human liver injured by biliary duct disease.<br>
Hepatic injury in mice was induced by ligation of the biliary duct.<br>
See, e.g., George et al., PNAS 96:12719-24 (1999); George et al., Am J Pathol<br><br>
156:115-24 (2000). Using xnAb 6.2G2, we found that expression of αvβ6 was<br>
significantly elevated at days 9,14 and 16 following biliary duct ligation.<br>
Similarly, human liver sections from patients with biliary duct<br>
disease displayed upregulated expression of αvβ6, as determined by<br>
immunohistochemistry using the mAb 6.2G2. Elevated expression of αvβ6 was<br>
observed for example, in liver samples from a 44 year old male with acute<br>
cholestasis, a post-transplant 59 year old male with acute bile duct obstruction, a<br>
22 year old male with biliary atresia, and a 24 year old male with chronic bile duct<br>
obstruction.<br>
In sum, the new anti-αvβ6 antibodies are useful diagnostic and<br>
therapeutic tools for liver diseases.<br>
Example 17: Upreeulation of αvβ6 in various human cancers<br>
Integrin αvβ6 is normally expressed at negligible to low levels in<br>
healthy adult tissues. A variety of human tumor tissues was evaluated for αvβ6<br>
expression using the antibody 6.2A1 and methods generally described herein. The<br>
results showed that αvβ6 integrin expression was significantly upregulated in<br>
several human epithelial cancers. Notably, immunohistology showed that αvβ6<br>
was expressed especially prominently on the edges of tumor islands in many of the<br>
epithelial cancers. To further study expression of αvβ6 in epithelial cancer cells,<br>
Detroit 562 cells (pharynx carcinoma) and SCC-14 cells (tongue squamous cell<br>
carcinoma) as well as SW480β6 cells (supra) were stained with 6.3G9 and 6.4B4<br>
and analyzed by flow cytometry.<br>
The right side of Fig. 12 shows αvβ6 expression on the different<br>
tumor cell lines as indicated by 6.3G9 binding in fluorescence activated cell sorting<br>
(FACS). The solid peak represents 6.3G9 binding while the open peak represents<br>
background binding of the secondary mAb alone. The line graph on the left side of<br>
Fig. 12 shows inhibition of the tumor cell lines' binding to the LAP ligand by<br>
increasing concentrations of 6.3G9 or 6.4B4. 6.4B4 was a significantly less potent<br>
inhibitor of αvβ6 binding to LAP, compared to 6.3G9 (&gt; 10-fold IC50 for Detroit<br>
562, &gt; 30-fold IC50 for SW480B6, and &gt; 100-fold IC50 for SCC-14). This is<br>
consistent with previous in vitro results indicating that 6.3G9 is a potent blocking<br>
mAb and 6.4B4 is a weak blocking mAb. This data is also consistent with<br><br>
negligible inhibitory activity of 6.4B4 in the Detroit xenograft model (Fig. 14B).<br>
Fig. 13 further shows the relative inhibition of tumor cell lines' binding to LAP by<br>
various anti-αvβ6 mAbs. Both 6.3G9 and 6.8G6 displayed equivalent inhibiting<br>
activity (consistent with all previous data) while 6.4B4 was a significantly less<br>
potent inhibitor of αvβ6 binding to LAP.<br>
Example 18: Effects of anti-αvβ6 blocking mAbs in a human tumor xenograft<br>
model<br>
Immunodeficient animals (e.g., nude mice and SCID mice)<br>
transplanted with human tumor xenografts have been established as a useful in vivo<br>
model system to test the therapeutic effects of anti-cancer agents (see, e.g., van<br>
Weerden et al., Prostate 43(4):263-71 (2000); Bankert et al., Front Biosci 7x44-62<br>
(2002)). Thus, the blocking anti-αvβ6 monoclonal antibodies of the present<br>
invention can be tested in vivo in a xenograft model for their ability to inhibit<br>
tumor growth. In this experiment, we tested the ability of some of the new αvβ6<br>
antibodies to inhibit tumor growth in athymic nude female mice transplanted with<br>
cancerous human pharyngeal (Detroit 562 cell line) xenograft.<br>
To do this, Detroit 562 cells (ATCC) were passed in vitro in<br>
Minimum essential medium (Eagle) with 2 mM L-glutamine and Earle's BSS<br>
adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids,<br>
and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum, without antibiotics.<br>
About 5X106 cells/0.2 mi media (without serum) were implanted subcutaneously<br>
into nude mice on the right flank. Three to four days later, tumor size<br>
measurements were started and continued until the tumors were about 5 mm<br>
(length) by 5 mm (width). The mice were randomized and injected<br>
intraperitoneally with the test antibodies or control solutions on day 1, followed by<br>
three injections weekly for a period of 33 days. The test antibodies and control<br>
solutions were: (1) 6.3G9,1 mg/kg, 10 mice; (2) 6.3G9, 4 mg/kg, 10 mice; (3)<br>
6.3G9,10 mg/kg, 10 mice; (4) 6.4B4,1 mg/kg, 10 mice; (5) 6.4B4, 4 mg/kg, 10<br>
mice; (6) 6.4B4,10 mg/kg, 10 mice; and (7) vehicle control (PBS), 0.2 ml/per<br>
mouse, 30 mice. In addition, cis-platinum was injected into 10 mice<br>
subcutaneously at 2 mg/kg as a chemotherapeutical control. The cis-platinum<br>
injections were done on day 1 and then every 2 days for a total of six treatments.<br>
At the end of the 33 day period, animal weights and tumor sizes were measured,<br><br>
αvβ6 expression assessed by immunohistology, and serum anti- αvβ6 levels<br>
measured.<br>
Immunohistological staining showed that the implanted tumor cells<br>
strongly expressed αvβ6 in vivo. Tumor weight data further showed that blocking<br>
mAb 6.3G9 effectively inhibited tumor growth at all three concentrations tested<br>
(Fig. 14A). In contrast, weak blocking mAb 6.4B4 did not inhibit tumor growth<br>
(Fig. 14B).<br>
In sum, blocking antibodies inhibited tumor growth by 40-50% in<br>
the treated mice. In contrast, a weak blocking anti-αvβ6 antibody did not inhibit<br>
tumor growth.<br>
Example 19: αvβ6 antibody internalization<br>
Antibodies that are internalized by cells offer an advantage for<br>
certain clinical indications such as cancer, because the antibodies can then be<br>
conjugated with toxins, radioactive compounds or other anti-cancer agents to<br>
selectively target and inhibit growth of cancer cells. The ability of anti-αvβ6<br>
antibodies to be internalized was studied in SW480β6 (supra) and SCC-14 cells.<br>
Cells were split 1:5 and plated onto 4-chambered glass slides for<br>
overnight incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2. The next day, mAbs 6.8G6,6.1 A8,6.3G9,<br>
7.1C5,6.4B4,10D5, and 8B3 were diluted to a final concentration of 20 g/mL.<br>
The mAbs or medium alone were added to appropriate wells. A time course of<br>
internalization was run from 0 h to 48 h. Time points included were 0, 5,10 and<br>
30 min, and 1,4,24 and 48 h. A secondary antibody (anti-murine-Alexa 594) was<br>
added as a negative control. Internalization was stopped at each time point by<br>
removing the antibody and washing the cell layer with buffer. Wheat Germ<br>
Agglutinin-Alexa-488 was added for 20 min at 18°C to stain the outer edge of the<br>
cells with green fluorescence. After the cells were washed, Cytofix/Cytoperm<br>
solution was added for 20 min at 18°C to fix and permeabilize the cells. The cells<br>
were washed again and the secondary anti-mouse-Alexa 594 (red fluorescence)<br>
was added for 20 min at 18°C to label the bound or internalized murine αvβ6<br>
antibody. The cells were then washed and fixed by addition of 2%<br>
paraformaldehyde and examined by confocal microscopy. Images were then taken<br>
with a Leitz Plan-Apochromatic 63x (1.32 numerical aperture, ail immersion)<br><br>
objective (Leica) with a 2x digital zoom. Each frame represented a single optical<br>
section from the middle section of the cells observed for internalization under all<br>
conditions. There was no staining observed in the nucleus.<br>
Internalization was observed for cation-dependent mAbs (RGD-<br>
containing ligand mimetics) such as 6.8G6 and 6.1A8. No internalization was<br>
observed for cation-independent mAbs such as 6.3G9, 7.1C5, and 6.4B4.<br><br>
