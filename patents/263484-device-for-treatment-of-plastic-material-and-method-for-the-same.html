				<td>Method and apparatus for processing of plastic material<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 along<br>
with a method according to claim 17.<br>
Devices for processing and pre-treatment of plastic materials are known, for<br>
example, from EP 390 873. Such devices generally operate in satisfactory fashion, but<br>
it has been shown that in some cases the plastic material carried off via the worm gear<br>
is not sufficiently homogeneous, especially in regard to the obtained extent of drying of<br>
such plastic materials which must already be fully dry before plastification, for example<br>
polyester, to avoid decomposition processes. Thicker foils in addition require expense in<br>
drying that goes up as the thickness increases, owing to which, for such goods,<br>
separate drying processes such as with dehydrated air, are necessary in special dryers.<br>
These dryers operate in a temperature range for which only crystallized goods are<br>
permitted; amorphous goods would become sticky and agglomerate. This means that a<br>
crystallization process must precede the drying process. But if the goods to be<br>
processed are subjected to lengthy treatment in the container by the tool, then with the<br>
device in continuous operation, a danger arises that individual plastic particles are<br>
caught very early by the removing worm gear, while other plastic particles are caught<br>
very late. The plastic particles caught early may still be relatively cold and therefore may<br>
not have been given sufficient pre-treatment, dried, crystallized or softened, possible<br>
resulting in inhomogeneities in the material fed through the worm gear to the attached<br>
tool, such as an extruder.<br>
To solve this problem, mechanisms have been created such as are known from<br>
AT 396 900 B. Through such devices, the homogeneity of the material can be<br>
improved. Two or more containers are situated in a series and the plastic material to be<br>
processed runs through these containers in turn. In the first container, already pre-<br>
comminuted, pre-heated, pre-dried and pre-densified, and thus pre-homogenized<br>
material is generated, which is fed to the following container. By this means it is<br>
ensured that no untreated, i.e. cold, uncompacted, uncomminuted or inhomogeneous<br>
material passes directly to the removal worm gear or to the extruder. It is true that such<br>
devices with multiple containers are bulky and take up much space. Also, the design<br>
expense, especially in the linking of the containers, is considerable.<br>
With all of the treatment procedures, it must always be kept in mind that plastic<br>
amounts either not treated or inadequately treated form inhomogeneous plastic nests in<br>
the worm gear, which is detrimental to the quality of the end product. If therefore one<br>
desires to obtain end products, whether they be granulates or items extruded into<br>
shapes, with the desired quality retained, then the worm gear that transports the<br>
inadequately prepared material out of the receptacle must bring the entirety of the<br>
material fed by it at the worm gear outlet to the desired quality and temperature, to be<br>
able to extrude the material with the desired homogeneity. This initial temperature must<br>
be kept relatively high in order to assure that all the plastic particles are sufficiently<br>
plasticized. This in turn entails high energy expense and in addition that thermal<br>
damage to the plastic material, such as breakdown of the molecular chain length, is to<br>
be feared due to the relatively high initial temperature.<br>
In addition, from prior art from AT 407 970 B, a mechanism is known in which the<br>
material to be processed is processed continuously in the same receptacle by means of<br>
two sets of tools situated one above the other in two successive stages. In the first, by<br>
means of the stage carried out of the upper tool set, the material is pre-comminuted<br>
and/or preheated and/or pre-dried and/or premixed. In the second stage carried out by<br>
means of the lower tool set, the material obtains the same treatment, but less<br>
intensively. Material is exchanged between the first and second stage via a permanently<br>
open annular gap that is formed between the container wall and a carrier disk. It is true<br>
that owing to the friction of the material occurring there between the container wall and<br>
carrier disk, the annular gap is not advantageous and not able to be comminuted at will.<br>
In addition, the size of the annular gap cannot be altered. With larger containers of this<br>
design, the overall open area between the stages is larger than necessary, which leads<br>
to an expanded dwell time spectrum of the material..<br>
Thus the task of the invention is improve devices of the type mentioned initially,<br>
and to create an energy-efficient device that delivers a material with good,<br>
homogeneous quality while not taking up much space. In addition, the task of the<br>
invention is to produce an advantageous procedure by which lumpy plastic material can<br>
be treated efficiently and in a space-saving manner.<br>
These problems are solved by the characterizing features of claims 1 and 17.<br>
In advantageous fashion, claim 1 ensures that freshly inserted,<br>
insufficiently treated or pretreated material is prevented from getting into the removal<br>
worm gear without being sufficiently processed, through which the device and its<br>
operation are considerably simplified. This is insured by intermediate bases inserted<br>
into the container and subdividing it into chambers, whereby means are provided that<br>
cause or permit an exchange of the lumpy softened, unmelted material between the<br>
immediately adjacent stages or planes or chambers. Thus the zone where the material<br>
is predominantly comminuted or dried or preheated, is separated from the zone where<br>
the material is compressed into the worm gear housing. With this, after a brief time of<br>
operation, an equilibrium is created between the zones. This contributes to ensuring a<br>
sufficient dwell time of the material in the receptacle, especially in its area above the<br>
intermediate base. Thus, the temperature of the material inserted into the removal<br>
opening of the receptacle is homogenized, since in essence all of the plastic parts found<br>
in the receptacle are sufficiently preprocessed. The approximately constant<br>
temperature of the material being fed into the worm gear housing brings the result that<br>
the inhomogeneous nests of plastic in the extruder worm year are largely eliminated,<br>
and thereby the worm gear lengths are kept smaller than with the known designs, since<br>
the worm gear needs to apply less work to bring the plastic material with certainty to the<br>
same plastifier temperature. The constant entry temperature of the plastic material into<br>
the worm gear housing also results in a uniform pre-densification of the material in the<br>
worm gear housing, which has a favorable effect on the conditions at the extruder<br>
opening, especially in the form of a uniform extruder throughput and a uniform material<br>
quality at the extruder output. The curtailed worm gear length results in an energy<br>
saving and processing temperature in the extruder than is lower in comparison to the<br>
known designs, since the average entry temperature on the entry end of the worm gear<br>
is more uniform than with the known designs. Thus with the subject of the invention, the<br>
processed plastic material - viewed over the entire processing sequence - can be<br>
processed at a temperature that is lower in comparison to other designs, to have the<br>
security of a sufficient plastification. This reduction in peak temperatures results in the<br>
energy saving mentioned at the outset, and in addition avoids thermal damage to the<br>
processed materials.<br>
In addition, owing to such a device, the processing of the material can be<br>
controlled and adapted in dependence on the type of plastic. Thus it is<br>
advantages with PET to achieve an increase in viscosity (iV). With other plastics, for<br>
example HDPE or polycarbonate, it is also advantageous to detoxify the plastic material<br>
and to free it from volatile components and remove these from the material stream. This<br>
in advantageous fashion can be ensured by the invention-specific device. Owing to the<br>
fact that the individual stages or levels in essence are partitioned off from each other,<br>
movement of volatile components from one level to another cleaner level is minimized.<br>
If the volatile components in each plane are stripped out or removed by suction, in this<br>
way the material can obtain increased purity.<br>
In addition, owing to the intermediate bases used, the material column is<br>
lessened in height over the moved tools or mixing devices. By this means, mechanical<br>
loading on the tools is reduced and the maintenance intervals for the mixing tools along<br>
with their service life are extended. In addition this leads to better control when energy<br>
is put into the material, through which one can more easily get up to the highest<br>
permissible temperature for the material to be processed. With this the highest<br>
permissible temperature is the temperature at which the material is in a softened,<br>
doughy state, but has not yet melted on. Adjustment of this temperature is very<br>
sensitive, because too high a temperature would lead to melting on and baking<br>
together. The temperature is applied through the mixing and stirring tools and is also<br>
especially controlled thereby. In addition the mixing and stirring tools perform a mixing<br>
through that prevents getting stuck together. Thus it is advantageous to regulate the<br>
temperature as quickly and precisely as possible, which can be ensured by subdividing<br>
the entire receptacle into individual smaller mixing spaces that are easy to inspect in<br>
advantageous fashion. By setting a maximum permissible temperature and the certainty<br>
of also being able to maintain this temperature and rapidly adapt it, the diffusion rates of<br>
the volatile components to be removed are improved, and the purity is further improved.<br>
In summary this means that owing to the intermediate bases employed, material<br>
exchange in the flow direction from one level to the next is reduced, by which the<br>
passage of the lumpy material through is decelerated and the dwell spectrum is<br>
narrowed.<br>
The dependent claims relate to advantageous embodiments of the invention.<br>
Thus it is advantageous if the chambers are situated above each other and the<br>
material flows by gravity from top to bottom. In this way, with structurally simple<br>
interchange media or even just with openings, without additional feed devices,<br>
sufficiency can be found.<br>
In addition it can be advantageous if the chambers differ in diameter and/or<br>
height. According to a preferred embodiment form, as seen in the direction of flow of the<br>
lumpy material, the upper chamber into which the material is inserted has the greatest<br>
diameter and if necessary also the smallest height, in comparison to the other chambers<br>
that lie below as seen in the flow direction. In this way, processing of the not completely<br>
molten material can effectively be influenced. In addition, the receiving capacity in the<br>
topmost container is increased. Formation of a topmost chamber with a large diameter<br>
also offers an advantage in that in this way, the plastic material can be processed<br>
effectively and with adaptation to the particular circumstances, especially comminution<br>
and pre-homogenization.<br>
A further advantageous configuration relates to formation of mixing and<br>
comminution tools. In this regard it is advantageous that these be so configured that by<br>
that means the material is moved, placed in rotation, mixed, heated, comminuted and/or<br>
brought into a softened state, without the material melting. Thus the mixing and<br>
comminution tools must receive the material in a lumpy or particle-forming state and dry<br>
and/or precrystallize it if needed.<br>
The mixing and comminution tools can be configured differently in the particular<br>
chambers and/or be controllable and driven independently of each other via one or<br>
more drives, especially at differing r.p.m.s. In this way, by choosing the correct r.p.m.<br>
and the correct tool, for example, a great deal of energy can be put quickly into the fresh<br>
material. By this means the material is quickly heated and any moisture contained can<br>
quickly be removed with the aid of a vacuum or dried inert gas. Thus in the chamber<br>
lying below, considerably less energy needs to be put into the material, by which other<br>
tool configurations can be used in this chamber, which if necessary operate at different<br>
r.p.m. This guarantees the largest possible variability and an optimal procedure in<br>
dependence on the material to be treated, and the material can be best kept in a<br>
softened, lumpy, non-melted state.<br>
In this connection on the one hand it is advantageous to place the mixing and<br>
comminution tools on a common rotating shaft, since in many situations this is efficient<br>
and ensures sufficient processing. On the other hand, it can be advantageous,<br>
especially in view of the variable processing mentioned above, to run the mixing and<br>
comminution tools via separate drives.<br>
The means that allow exchange of material between the chambers penetrate the<br>
particular intermediate bases completely according to one advantageous embodiment<br>
form of the invention. In this way, the material can be directed from the chamber that<br>
lies upstream in the flow direction and be brought into the next chamber situated<br>
downstream. For design reasons it is especially advantageous that material leaving<br>
from the topmost chamber is moved directly through the intermediate base. On the one<br>
hand, thereby the spatial requirement is lessened, and on the other, such openings in<br>
the intermediate bases are completely surrounded by receptacles, ensuring a stable<br>
temperature. If for example the materials are passed via external piping into another<br>
container or another chamber, then under certain circumstances it may be required that<br>
these pipes or feed mechanisms be heated, so as not to impair processing of the<br>
material.<br>
In this connection it is advantageous if, for example when chambers have the<br>
same diameter, the material is brought from the upper chamber through the<br>
intermediate base directly into the lower chamber, and in this way it falls, so to speak,<br>
from above into the lower chamber. In this embodiment form, the intermediate base<br>
represents a horizontal partition between the two chambers that is fully penetrated by<br>
the exchange media. Such a connection of the chambers is structurally very simple,<br>
space-saving and efficient.<br>
Especially with chambers having different diameters in which for example the<br>
upper chamber is of a larger diameter than the chambers situated farther downstream, it<br>
can also be advantageous that the material exiting from the uppermost chamber is<br>
brought not from above but rather laterally while penetrating the side wall of the<br>
chamber lying farther below. In this way, a variation can be made in advantageous<br>
fashion of whether the delivery is made above or below the material level.<br>
The exchange media can in advantageous fashion be configured about the<br>
central rotating shaft and/or in the area close to the side wall of the receptacle or<br>
in the radial end area of the mixing and comminution tools. The positioning of the<br>
means is dependent on the r.p.m. and the intensity of the processing<br>
and can in this way be varied in advantageous fashion. To maximize path length<br>
and dwell time, it is advantageous if the media in the individual intermediate bases are<br>
not placed directly one over the over, but rather on opposite sides at a maximum<br>
distance from each other.<br>
According to one advantageous embodiment, the means are configured either as<br>
openings permitting free passage over their entire width in the clear, which can be<br>
implemented very simply in design terms and are easy to maintain. Also, the media can<br>
be configured as labyrinths, which additionally increase the dwell time of the material.<br>
To make possible control over the dwell time, it is advantageous to provide the means<br>
with covers or slides. In this way, control can be implemented regarding when and to<br>
what degree material passes from one chamber into the next one. Also, it is possible to<br>
configure the means as actual feeding and dosing means, for example, as feeding<br>
screws, which understandably are also suitable for dosing. In this way, it is quick and<br>
easy to react to differing raw materials. If, for example, thick flakes are inserted into the<br>
uppermost chamber, after thin foils have previously been processed, then it may make<br>
sense to increase the dwell time of the now more coarse material in the topmost<br>
chamber through reduction of the exit opening in the intermediate base, to ensure<br>
sufficient handling. Such mechanisms thus permit a more variable carrying out of the<br>
procedure.<br>
As an alternative to that, it is also possible that the exchange media are<br>
configured so that they do not penetrate through the intermediate base, but rather<br>
ensure the flow of materials to a chamber lying below while not penetrating through the<br>
intermediate base but rather while penetrating the side wall of this chamber. Thus the<br>
treated material flows from the topmost chamber through the side wall, and is<br>
conducted into a chamber placed downstream either laterally or from above. The<br>
exchange media can be configured in the same way as below.<br>
In addition, provision can be made in advantageous fashion that preferably in<br>
each chamber a suctioning device is provided to remove volatile components and/or a<br>
device can be placed for rinsing with inert gas or reactive gases. It can also be<br>
advantageous to enable the entire mechanism to be centrally evacuated. Thus for<br>
example during treatment it is advantageous to adjust the pressure in the topmost<br>
chamber with the highest temperature to be as low as possible, to make possible an<br>
optimal increase in viscosity through polycondensation. With this as a rule the topmost<br>
chamber is charged with the most moist material, resulting in a larger pressure drop due<br>
to the large amounts of humidity which accompany<br>
an increase in temperature. If a single vacuum pump is used for the entire receptacle,<br>
the pressure in the lowest intermediate base would likewise fall, through which no<br>
polycondensation would occur, or only to a reduced extent. Among these aspects it is<br>
advantageous if every area or every chamber is able to be evacuated by its own<br>
vacuum pump. In principle instead of suction, inert gas rinsing could be done with<br>
nitrogen or carbon dioxide, through which not just moisture, but also other volatile<br>
components such as smelly substances could be suctioned out.<br>
In addition it is advantageous, preferably in each of the chambers, to provide a<br>
filling level gauge, which ensures that the flow-through of material is better able to be<br>
checked and controlled. Depending on the filling level in the particular chamber, the<br>
r.p.m. or adjustment of covers of the exchange medium can be governed.<br>
An advantageous mechanism according to claim 15 with an upper chamber<br>
having a larger diameter offers an advantage in that in this way, processing of the not<br>
fully melted material can be positively influenced. In addition, by this means, using a<br>
simple measure, the receiving capacity in the topmost container can be increased.<br>
Formation of a topmost chamber with a large or larger diameter also offers an<br>
advantage in that in this way the plastic material can be processed more effectively, and<br>
adapted to the particular circumstances, especially comminution and pre-homogenizing.<br>
The features of claim 16 further amplify these effects.<br>
In essence the invention-specific procedure guarantees the advantages named<br>
above, especially in that by that means it is possible to process or prepare plastic<br>
material effectively.<br>
Further advantages and embodiments of the invention can be gleaned from the<br>
specification and the appended drawings.<br>
The invention is schematically depicted using embodiment examples in the<br>
drawings and is described as follows by way of example while referring to the drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows a first embodiment form of an invention-specific mechanism with<br>
three chambers of equal diameter, placed one above the other.<br>
Figure 2 shows another embodiment with two chambers of differing diameter<br>
placed one above the other.<br>
Figure 3 shows an alternative embodiment form of figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows an embodiment form of an invention-specific mechanism for<br>
treatment of thermoplastic material, especially recycled goods or packaging waste or<br>
the like, which comprises a receptacle or cutter-compactor 1. The material can be<br>
inserted from above via an insertion opening 12 into receptacle 1 and gets into<br>
uppermost chamber 6a. This chamber 6a has a cylindrical shape and is equipped with a<br>
mixing and comminution tool 7a. Mixing and comminution tool 7a is connected via a<br>
rotating shaft with a drive unit and can be put into rotary motions. Mixing and<br>
comminution tool 7a is situated in the base area of topmost chamber 6a and is<br>
governed or configured so that it exerts a mixing, heating, and, if necessary grinding<br>
effect on the plastic material. The material is put into rotation and a mixing funnel is<br>
formed. With this, two arms that are placed normal to the longitudinal axis 14 of the<br>
overall device or to rotating shaft 9 can be configured which are equipped with working<br>
edges 13 that act on the plastic material. These working edges 13 run so that on the<br>
one side they perform a pulling cut on the plastic material situated in the edge area of<br>
receptacle 1, and on the other side they feed the ground material as much as possible<br>
into a removal opening 5'.<br>
Other liquid or solid additional materials or fillers can be added into topmost<br>
chamber 6a. They can be added either via the insertion opening 12 or also in an area<br>
below the material level in chamber 6a.<br>
Directly beneath topmost chamber 6a, another center chamber 6b is placed.<br>
Center chamber 6b has the same diameter as topmost chamber 6a. The two chambers,<br>
6a and 6b, are spatially separated from each other by an intermediate base 2', with the<br>
intermediate base in the same way forming the lower base of topmost chamber 6a, as<br>
well as the upper covering of center chamber 6b. Between chambers 6a and 6b a<br>
means 5' is provided, which makes possible a transfer or transport of the softened,<br>
lumpy, non-melted material from upper chamber 6a into chamber 6b lying beneath it.<br>
The material pretreated in topmost chamber 6a can thus drop by gravity from topmost<br>
chamber 6a into further chamber 6b.<br>
Additionally in topmost chamber 6a a suction device 15 is provided, through<br>
which volatile components such as water vapor or odor-causing compounds that<br>
condense from the material can be withdrawn. It is also<br>
possible to pass an inert gas stream through the suction device 15 or by means of it,<br>
through chamber 6a.<br>
In center chamber 6b that is farther below or which is placed downstream, mixing<br>
tools 7b are also situated. In the present case these are two mixing devices that lie one<br>
atop the other, which are supported on a common rotating shaft 8 and set the material<br>
in chamber 6b in motion and process in the same way as in chamber 6a. True, rotating<br>
shaft 8 is not connecting with the same drive unit as rotating shaft 9 of upper chamber<br>
6a, but rather with a drive unit that is placed at the opposite end of the device. In this<br>
way, the r.p.m. of mixing tool 7b can be set independently of the r.p.m. of mixing tools<br>
7a.<br>
Below or downstream of chamber 6b, another chamber 6c is placed. This lowest<br>
chamber 6c has the same size and same diameter as the two upper chambers 6a and<br>
6b. Also in the bottom chamber 6c, a mixing tool 7c is provided which operates as<br>
described above. Chamber 6b is spatially separated from lowest chamber 6c by<br>
intermediate base 2". To ensure a material flow, a means 5" is placed in intermediate<br>
base 2", which ensures an exchange of the softened, lumpy material exiting from center<br>
chamber 6b into lowest chamber 6c.<br>
Thus, the three chambers 6a, 6b, 6c are of equal size, lie directly one atop the<br>
other, and form cylindrical receptacle 1. Side walls 4', 4" and 4'" of the chambers, lying<br>
one atop the other, form the side wall 4 of receptacle 1. Via the two intermediate bases<br>
2', 2", receptacle 1 is subdivided into the three chambers 6a, 6b, 6c, but nonetheless a<br>
single, unitary, space-saving receptacle 1 exists, not several individual containers<br>
connected with each other.<br>
Through the formation of intermediate bases 2', 2" thus no raw material can flow<br>
unhindered and undefined to the extruder. The two means 5' 5" do not lie in alignment<br>
one over the other, but are placed radially at opposite ends of the intermediate bases 2',<br>
2". In this way the dwell time spectrum can be increased and the path of the material<br>
can be lengthened. The two means 5', 5" lie at the end area of the radii or regions<br>
covered by mixing and stirring tools 7a, 7b.<br>
Also in chambers 6b and 6c, suction devices 15 are provided, to remove volatile<br>
components not yet released in topmost chamber 6a. In this way, the material can be<br>
effectively purified.<br>
In lowest chamber 6c, a removal opening 10 is placed in the side wall 4'". By<br>
means of mixing tool 7c, the<br>
plastic material is inserted in troweled fashion into this removal opening 10, which<br>
essentially lies at the same level as mixing tool 7c. In a further sequence, an extruder<br>
11, in which the material is compacted and melted, is attached to this removal opening<br>
10.<br>
The plastic material thus moves in the following way: the material is inserted via<br>
the insertion opening 12 into topmost chamber 6a, and is there processed by mixing<br>
tools 7a. Especially the material is ground and also heated by the energy transferred via<br>
the mixing tools 7a. Likewise, the material can be dried in topmost chamber 12a, which<br>
is of especially great relevance with PET. The material can also be pre-crystallized.<br>
With this it is essential that the material in topmost chamber 6a is not melted on at any<br>
point, but rather is present in a softened state, especially in the vicinity of the Vicat<br>
softening temperature of the polymer to be treated. In advantageous fashion the<br>
required temperature can be set and regulated by the mixing tools 7a, especially by<br>
their rotational speed and/or the configuring of the cutting edges 13. Due to the<br>
chambers being relatively small, temperatures can be regulated and altered quickly. In<br>
addition, mixing tools 7a prevent the plastic particles from sticking together and allow<br>
the material by that means to flow and be agitated.<br>
Then the material is brought via means 5' through intermediate base 2' from<br>
chamber 6a into chamber 6b. With this, means 5' is configured in the present<br>
embodiment form in the shape of a closable opening or cover. In this way, the material<br>
flow can be regulated and the dwell time of the material adjusted in topmost chamber<br>
6a. As an alternative, a feed screw or dosing screw can be provided. In chamber 6b,<br>
the material also is now subjected to processing by mixing tools 7b, with no melting of<br>
the material occurring here as well.<br>
The material is then transferred by means 5" through intermediate base 2"<br>
further downstream into the lowest chamber 6c, and there is further processed by<br>
mixing tools 7c.<br>
Then the material is withdrawn through removal opening 10 from receptacle 1,<br>
having undergone a three-stage processing and pre-homogenizing, which in<br>
advantageous fashion has prepared the material optimally for the upcoming melting<br>
operation in the extruder.<br>
Another alternative embodiment form is provided in figure 2. The device<br>
comprises a receptacle or cutter-compactor 1, into which material can be brought from<br>
above via the insertion opening 12 and which likewise has a removal opening 10,<br>
through which, after processing, the material can be extracted in the direction of an<br>
extruder 11. In contrast to the device as per figure 1, the device as per figure 2<br>
comprises only two chambers 6a and 6b that lie one above the other. In both chambers<br>
6a and 6b, mixing and comminution tools 7a, 7b are placed. True, the diameter of upper<br>
chamber 6a is greater than the diameter of chamber 6b that is lower, lying downstream.<br>
Thus, the side wall 4' of upper chamber 6a and the side wall 4" of lower chamber 6b do<br>
not form a cylindrical receptacle 1, but rather a receptacle 1 that appropriately is<br>
different in shape. Nonetheless, the result is a single unitary receptacle 1, and not two<br>
containers spatially separated from each other. This is not impaired by the circumstance<br>
that chambers 6a, 6b have differing diameters.<br>
The upper chamber 6a is separated from lower chamber 6b by an intermediate<br>
base 2', with now a circular ring-shaped area provided in the outer radius of this<br>
intermediate base 2', which projects out over the circular surface of the diameter of<br>
lower chamber 6b. In intermediate base 2' in this circular ring-shaped outer area, a<br>
means 5' or a hole is provided which penetrates intermediate base 2' completely, by<br>
which, however, no direct vertical connection is formed between chamber 6a and<br>
chamber 6b, as in figure 1, in which the material drops from above into lower chamber<br>
6b. Deviating from the device as per figure 1, means 5' as per figure 2 is so configured<br>
that the material first drops vertically from above or is inserted, and then is brought<br>
through a turnover section in the form of a tube or a feeding screw through side wall 4"<br>
of lower chamber 6b, into this chamber 6b. In this way, it can be varied whether the<br>
material is inserted above or beneath the material level in chamber 6b, depending at<br>
what level the means 5' empties into chamber 6b. The throughput can also be<br>
controlled.<br>
In figure 2, the means 5' is just outside the radius of the upper mixing and<br>
comminution tool 7a, through which the softened, lumpy, non-molten material simply<br>
and efficiently drops or can be inserted into means 5'.<br>
Understandably, additionally other means 5' can be provided which are<br>
configured to be farther in radially and which, like in the device according to figure 1,<br>
fully penetrate intermediate base 2', through which the material, also like figure 1, is<br>
able to be brought<br>
from upper chamber 6a directly vertically from above into the underlying chamber 6b.<br>
The material flows similar to figure 1 from chamber 6a, in which the material can<br>
be pretreated, but not melted on, via means 5' in chamber 6b, with the material<br>
undergoing a further treatment in chamber 6b. Thus it is not possible for untreated raw<br>
material to directly enter into the extruder worm gear 11.<br>
Also in figure 2, the two mixing tools 7a, 7b of the different chambers 6a, 6b can<br>
be controlled separately from each other via the differing drive units or tube shafts 8, 9,<br>
with the drive units here also situated at opposite positions relative to the mechanism.<br>
Figure 3 shows a further embodiment of the invention. As in figure 1, the<br>
receptacle or cutter-compactor 1 is divided or subdivided into three chambers 6a, 6b, 6c<br>
placed one above the other, with the diameter of the individual chambers being equal<br>
and the side walls 4', 4", 4'" forming a unitary cylindrical receptacle 1. Differing from<br>
figure 1, the mixing devices 7a, 7b, 7c present in each chamber 6a, 6b, 6c are placed<br>
on a common rotating shaft 8 and thus can only rotate with common r.p.m. or with the<br>
same r.p.m.<br>
In a customary manner, chambers 6a, 6b, 6c are separated by intermediate<br>
bases 2', 2" and connected with each other in material-flow terms by means 5', 5". It is<br>
true that the means 5', 5" are differently configured as compared with figure 1. Between<br>
topmost chamber 6a and center chamber 6b, a means 5' is provided, which is placed<br>
centrally radially about rotating shaft 8. Besides that, an additional means 5' is provided,<br>
which in contrast to the previous means does not penetrate through the intermediate<br>
base, but rather only cuts through the side walls 4', 4" of the two chambers 6a, 6b that<br>
lie one atop the other. Thus the material can be brought through sidewall 4' of topmost<br>
chamber 6a from this chamber 6a and is inserted via means 5', in this case a feeding or<br>
dosing screw, while penetrating sidewall 4" of chamber 6b lying below into it. Thus this<br>
means 5' lies outside chambers 6a, 6b or outside sidewalls 4', 4". In this case attention<br>
is to be paid to the temperature in this means 5' or insulating and/or heating devices for<br>
this means 5' may make sense.<br>
Intermediate base 2" between center chamber 6b and lowest chamber 6c also<br>
has a means 5" which is placed centrally about rotating axle 8.<br>
In addition, another means 5" is situated which is configured as an adjustable opening<br>
over a slider 21, and which penetrates intermediate base 2". This means 5" is in the<br>
outer radial area of mixing tool 7b.<br>
Otherwise the device is configured the same as in figure 1.<br>
The material is fed via insertion device 12 in advantageous fashion via a<br>
regulating or controlling device 20, as for example a bucket wheel lock, a slider system<br>
or a screw feed system.<br>
In addition, provision can be made that preferably a fill lever meter 16 be<br>
provided in each chamber 6a, 6b, 6c, to determine the height of the material in each<br>
chamber and the procedure can be adapted at any time to the r.p.m. of mixing tool 7 or<br>
by adjusting the opening width or porthole of means 5.<br>
The cover of receptacle 1 in addition can be designed to be heated or cooled, for<br>
example by heating or cooling hoses or by a dual cover. Thus, each section or each<br>
sidewall 4', 4", 4'" of each chamber 6a, 6b, 6c can be cooled or heated separately from<br>
the others. The mixing tools 7a, 7b, 7c can also be designed so they can be heated or<br>
cooled.<br>
In addition, it would be possible to provide each chamber 6a, 6b, 6c with its own<br>
removal opening 10, via which the material can be passed to an extruder 11.<br>
Figure 4 shows an exemplary mechanism which in essence corresponds to the<br>
embodiment form as per figure 2. True, the mixing and comminution tools 7a, 7b are<br>
situated on a common rotating shaft 8 and moved via a single drive motor, and thus are<br>
coupled or synchronized for identical motion.<br>
