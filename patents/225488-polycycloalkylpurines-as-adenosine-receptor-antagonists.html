CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/165,191, filed on November 12, 1999.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to antagonists of the adenosine receptors and methods of<br>
making and using the same in the treatment of diseases.<br>
Adenosine is an intracellular and extracellular messenger generated by all cells in the<br>
body. It is also generated extracellularly by enzymatic conversion. Adenosine binds to and<br>
activates seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors, eliciting a variety of<br>
physiological responses. Adenosine itself, substances that mimic the actions of adenosine<br>
(agonists), and substances that antagonize its actions have important clinical applications.<br>
Adenosine receptors are divided into four known subtypes (i.e., At, A2, A2b, and A3). These<br>
subtypes elicit unique and sometimes opposing effects. Activation of the adenosine Af<br>
receptor, for example, elicits an increase in renal vascular resistance while activation of the<br>
adenosine A2, receptor elicits a decrease in renal vascular resistance.<br>
In most organ systems, periods of metabolic stress result in significant increases in<br>
the concentration of adenosine in the tissue. The heart, for instance, produces and releases '<br>
adenosine to mediate adaptive responses to stress, such as reductions in heart rate and<br>
coronary vasodilatation. Likewise, adenosine concentrations in kidneys increase in response<br>
to hypoxia, metabolic stress and many nephrotoxic substances. The kidneys also produce<br>
adenosine constitutively. The kidneys adjust the amount of constitutively produced<br>
adenosine in order to regulate, glomerular filtration and electrolyte reabsorption. Regarding<br>
control of glomerular filtration, activation of Ai receptors leads to constriction of afferent<br>
artcrioles while activation of A2a receptors leads to dilatation of efferent arterioles.<br>
Activation of A2a receptors may also exert vasodilatory effects on the afferent arteriole.<br>
Overall, the effect of activation of these glomerular adenosine receptors is to reduce<br>
glomerular filtration rate. In addition, A1 adenosine receptors are located in the proximal<br>
tubule and distal tubular sites. Activation of these receptors stimulates sodium reabsorption<br>
from the tubular lumen. Accordingly, blocking the effects of adenosine on these receptors<br>
will produce a rise in glomerular filtration rate and an increase in sodium excretion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on the discovery that compounds of Formula 1 are<br>
unexpectedly highly potent and selective inhibitors of particular subtypes of adenosine<br>
receptors. Adenosine antagonists can be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of<br>
numerous diseases, including cardiac and circulatory disorders, degenerative disorders of the<br>
central nervous system, respiratory disorders, and many diseases for which diuretic treatment<br>
is suitable.<br>

functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in<br>
the art and include those that increase biological penetration into a given biological system<br>
(e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase<br>
solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism, and/or alter rate of<br>
excretion. Examples of these modifications include, but are not limited to, esterification with<br>
polyethylene glycols, derivatization with pivolates or fatty acid substituents, conveR5ion to<br>
carbamates, hydroxylation of aromatic rings, and heteroatom-substitution in aromatic rings.<br>

compounds, alone or in a combination, together with a suitable excipient<br>
The invention also features a method of treating a subject suffering from a condition<br>
characterized by an elevated adenosine concentration and/or increased sensitivity to<br>
adenosine and/or elevated adenosine receptor number or coupling efficiency. The method<br>
includes the step of administering to the subject an amount of any of the above compounds to<br>
be effective as an adenosine receptor antagonist The condition can be, for example, a<br>
cardiac and circulatory disorder, a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, a<br>
respiratory disorder, a disease for which diuretic treatment is indicated, hypertension,<br>
Parkinson's disease, depression, traumatic brain damage, post-stroke neurological deficit,<br>
respiratory depression, neonatal brain trauma, dyslexia, hyperactivity, cystic fibrosis,<br>
cirrhotic ascites, neonatal apnea, renal failure, diabetes, asthma, an edematous condition,<br>
congestive heart failure, or renal dysfunction (e.g., dysfunction associated with diuretic use in<br>
congestive heart failure, or renal toxicity due to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents).<br>
The invention also features a method of making 8-substituted xanthines. The method<br>
includes the steps of obtaining a N7,C8-dihydroxanthine (e.g., compound 10 in FIG. 1),<br>
protecting the N7 position of the xanthine (e.g., as a THP or BOM ether); deprotonating the<br>
C8 position with strong base (such as lithium diisopropylamide or n-butyl lithium) to<br>
generate an anion; trapping the anion with a carboxyl, carbonyl, aldehyde, or kerone<br>
compound; and deprotecting the protected N7 position to obtain an 8-substituted xanthine.<br>

"arylalkylcarbamoyF' groups include an aryl group in place of one of the hydrogens and, in<br>
the Utter case, an alkyl group in place of the second hydrogen.<br>
A "carboxyl" group is a -COOH group.<br>
An "alkoxy" group is an alkyl-O- group in which "alkyl" is as previously described.<br>
An "alkoxyalkyl" group is an alkyl group as previously described, with a hydrogen<br>
replaced by an alkoxy group, as previously described.<br>
A "halogen" or "halo" group is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
A "heterocyclyl" group is a 5 to about 10 mcmbered ring structure, in which one or<br>
more of the atoms in the ring is an element other than carbon, e.g., N, O, S. A heterocyclyl<br>
group can be aromatic or non-aromatic, i.e., can be saturated, or can be partially or fully<br>
unsaturated. Examples of heterocyclyl groups include pyridyl, imidazolyl, furanyl, thienyl,<br>
thiazolyl, tetrahydroruranyl, tetrahydropyranyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, indolyl,<br>
indolinyl, isoindolinyl, piperidinyl, pyrimidinyl, piperazinyl, isoxazolyl, isoxazolidinyl,<br>
tetrazolyl, and benzimidazolyl.<br>
A "substituted heterocyclyl" group is a heterocyclyl group wherein one or more<br>
hydrogens are replaced by substituents such as alkoxy, alkylamino, dialkylamino,<br>
carbalkoxy, carbamoyl, cyano, halo, trihalomethyl, hydroxy, carbonyl, thiocarbonyl,<br>
hydroxyalkyl or nitro.<br>
A "hydroxyalkyl" means an alkyl group substituted by a hydroxy group.<br>
A "sulfamoyl" group has the structure -S(O)2NH2. "Alkylsulfamoyl" and<br>
"dialkylsiilfamoyl" refer to sulfamoyl groups in which the nitrogen has one or two alkyl<br>
groups attached in place of the hydrogens, respectively. By analogy, "arylsulfamoyr and<br>
"arylalkylsulfamoyl" groups include an aryl group in place of one of the hydrogens and, in<br>
the latter case, an alkyl group in place of the second hydrogen.<br>
An "antagonist" is a molecule that binds to a receptor without activating the receptor.<br>
It competes with the endogenous Iigand for this binding site and, thus, reduces the ability of<br>
the endogenous Iigand to stimulate the receptor.<br>
In the context of the present invention, a "selective antagonist" is an antagonist that<br>
binds to a specific subtype of adenosine receptor with higher affinity than to other subtypes.<br>
The antagonists of the invention can, for example, have high affinity for A2 receptors or for<br>
A2, receptoR5 and are selective, having (a) nanomolar binding affinity for one of these two<br>
subtypes and (b) at least 10 times, more preferably 50 times, and most preferably at least 100<br>
times, greater affinity for one subtype than for the other.<br>
The invention provides numerous advantages. The compounds are easily<br>
manufactured from readily available starting materials, in a relatively small number of steps.<br>
The compounds have a number of variable regions, allowing for systematic optimization. As<br>
specific antagonists, the compounds have broad medicinal utility. Since the compounds are<br>
highly potent and specific antagonists, they can (1) be used in low doses to minimize the<br>
likelihood of side effects and (2)-be incorporated into numerous dosage forms including, but<br>
not limited to, pills, tablets, capsules, aerosols, suppositories, liquid formulations for<br>
ingestion or injection, dietary supplements, or topical preparations. In addition to medical<br>
applications, the antagonist compound can be used in the treatment of livestock and pet<br>
animals.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In general, the invention features highly potent and selective antagonists of the<br>
adenosine A1 receptor. Selective antagonists of the adenosine A2, receptor are also disclosed.<br>
Synthesis of the Adenosine Antagonist Compounds<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared by a number of known methods.<br>
Two general methods are described herein. Each of them employs a common starting<br>
material, 1,3-disubstituted-5,6-diaminouraciI (compound (VI)), as shown in the two schemes<br>
below. 1,3-Disubstituted-5,6-diaminouracils can be prepared by treating the corresponding<br>
symmetrically or unsymmetrically substituted urea with cyanoacetic acid, followed by<br>
nitrosation and reduction (see, e.g., J. Org. Chem. 16,1879, 1951; Can J. Chem. 46, 3413,<br>
1968, incorporated herein by reference). Unsymmetrically substituted xanthines can be<br>
accessed via the method of Mueller (J. Med Chem. 36,3341,1993, incorporated herein by<br>
reference). In this method, 6-aminouracil is monoalkylated specifically at N3 of the uracil<br>
under Vorbruggen conditions. Alternatively, unsubstituted N1 or N3 position can be<br>
functionalized (e.g., alkylation) in the last stage of synthesis.<br>
In the fiR5t general method, a l,3-disubstituted-5,6-diaminouracil (compound (VI))<br>
can fiR5t undergo a ring closure reaction to produce a xanthine intermediate that is<br>
unsubstituted at the 8-position. This intermediate, in turn, can couple with a precuR5or<br>
compound of the Z-R3 moiety to produce the desired 8-substituted xanthines. Referring to<br>
scheme 1 below, the starting material l,3-disubstituted-5,6-diaminouracil (i.e., compound<br>
(VI)) fiR5t reacts with HC(OEt)3 to undergo a ring closure reaction to produce a xanthine<br>
intermediate that is unsubstituted at the 8-position (i.e., compound (A)). This intermediate,<br>
after being protected by an amino protecting group (e.g., with THP or BOM at the N7<br>
position), further undergoes a coupling reaction, in the presence of a strong base (e.g., n-<br>
butyl-lithium (nBuLi) or lithium di-isopropyl-amide (LDA)), with a precuR5or compound of<br>
the Z-R3 moiety (e.g., an aldehyde or a ketone) to produce an alcohol (i.e., compound (C)).<br>
The hydroxyl group of the alcohol can then be reacted to convert the alcohol to an amine, a<br>
mercapun, an ether, a lactone (e.g., compound (E)), or other functionalized compound, by<br>
methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The N7 protection can then be<br>
removed to obtain a deprotected product (i.e., compound (F)), which can be further<br>
funcuonalized to yield compounds of this invention. See, e.g., Examples 1-6, 51, and 52.<br>
compound of the Z-R3 moiety (e.g., aldehydes or carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid<br>
chlorides) to form a 6-amide substituted uracil intermediate, which in turn, can undergo a<br>
ring closure reaction to yield to a desired xanthine compound. Referring to scheme 2 below,<br>
the starting material l,3-disubstiruted-5,6-diaminouracil (i.e., compound (VI)) fiR5t couples<br>
with a di-carboxyl/ester-substirutcd precuR5or compound of the Z-R3 moiety, HOOC-Z-R3-<br>
COOR, (i.e., compound (G); Represents H, C1-5 alkyl, or benzyl, the phenyl ring being<br>
optionally substituted with 1-3 substiruents selected from the group consisting of halo,<br>
hydroxyl, or C1-3 alkoxy) to yield a 6-amide substituted uracil intermediate (i.e., compound<br>
(H)) by reactions which are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., by employing<br>
coupling reagents such as benzotriazol-1 -yloxytris(dimethylamino)-phosphoniura<br>
hexafluorophosphate (BOP), O-ben20-triazoI-l-yl-N',N'.N,N'-tetramethyluronium<br>
hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), or O-(7-azabcnzotria2ol-l-yl)-N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium<br>
hexafluorophosphate (HATU)). Examples of compound (G) include bicydo[3.2.1]octane-<br>
1,5-dicarboxylic acid monomethyl ester and bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-l,4-dicarboxylic acid<br>
monocthyl ester. Sec, e.g., Examples 8 and 13. The uracil intermediate can then undergo a<br>
ring closure reaction in a basic condition (e.g., by employing KOH and isopropyl alcohol) to<br>
yield a xanthine compound (i.e., compound (J)), which can undergo further functionalization<br>
to produce various compounds of the invention.<br>
The desired aidehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid chlorides are<br>
commercially available (e.g., from Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc., Milwaukee, Wisc.) or can be<br>
readily prepared from commercially available materials by well-known synthetic methods.<br>
Such synthetic methods include, but are not limited to, oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis,<br>
alkylation and Wittig homologation reactions. For references regarding the preparation of<br>
bicycloalkane carboxylic acids of the invention (e.g., compound (III), which is an example of<br>
compound (G)), see, e.g., Aust J. Chem. 38, 1705, 1985; AustJ, Chem, 39,2061, 1986; J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. 75, 637, 1953; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 86, 5183,1964; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 102,<br>
6862,1980; J. Org Chem. 46,4795,1981; and./ Org Chem. 60, 6873,1995.<br>
In one instance, when compound (G) is bicyclo [2,2,2]octane-1-4-dicarboxylic acid or<br>
its corresponding esteR5 (wherein Z is a single bond and R3 is bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl), there are a<br>
number of different methods for their preparation. Referring to FIG. 2, the starting material<br>
(i.e., compound (I)) is a l-COOR.-4-COOR5-cycIohexane, wherein each of R4 and R5,<br>
independently, represents H, C1-5 alkyl, or benzyl, the phenyl ring being optionally<br>
substituted with 1-3 substituents selected from the group consisting of halo, hydroxyl, or C1-3<br>
alkoxy. Preferably, R6 and R6 are identical and represent methyl or ethyl. Three different<br>
syntnetic routes are illustrated in Fig. 2 for the tranformation of compound (I) to compound<br>
(III) (an example of compound (G)). Route (1) (i.e., steps (A) and (B)) involves<br>
transforming compound (I) to its corresponding chloroethyl-containing compound (IT), which<br>
in turn, undergoes a ring closure reaction to form the corresponding l,4-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane<br>
acid/ester (HI). See Examples 79 and 80. Route (2) also involves compound (H), which is<br>
transformed to compound (III) via another intermediate, compound (XXV), the iodoethyl-<br>
containing derivative of compound (I). See Examples 101 and 102. Route (3) (i.e., step<br>
(TT)) involves the transformation of compound (I) to the l,4-bicyclof2.2.2]octane acid/ester<br>
(III) without isolating the intermediates, i.e., compound (IT). See Example 110.<br>
To prepare compound (II), the starting material compound (I) is treated with about 1<br>
to about 1.5 equivalents of a strong base. Strong bases that can be employed in this reaction<br>
incJude lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and lithium isopropylcyclohexylamide, with LDA<br>
being the preferred base. Typical solvents for this reaction include tetrahydroruran (THF),<br>
dimethoxyethane, dioxane, and t-buiyl methyl ether, with THF being the preferred solvent<br>
This reaction should be performed in a temperature range of about -100°C to about -60°C.<br>
The reaction mixture is then treated with about-1 to about 1.5 equivalents of<br>
bromochloroethane in the presence of at least four equivalents of a reagent such as 1,1,3,3-<br>
tetrarnethylurea(TMU), l,3-dimethy 3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)-pyrididinone(DMPU), 15-<br>
crown-5, and 12-crown-4, with TMU being preferred. This reaction can be conducted in<br>
solvents such as THF, dimcthoxyethane, dioxane, or t-butyl methyl ether (with THF being<br>
the preferred solvent) and at temperature ranging from about -80°C to about 0°C. Ring<br>
closure reaction can be performed by fiR5t treating compound (II) with about four equivalents<br>
of hexylmethylphosphoramide (HMPA), which is then followed by treatment with a strong<br>
base such as n-butyllithium and diisopropylamine (DIEA).<br>
Turning to route (2), the chloroethyl-containing intermediate (II) can be treated with<br>
iodide to form the desired iodoethyl-containing intermediate (XXV). Examples of iodide<br>
that can be employed in this reaction include sodium iodide, potassium iodide, lithium<br>
iodide, or tetrabutylamrnonium iodide, with Nal being the preferred iodide. Ring closure<br>
reaction is then conducted in the presence of a suitable strong base such as LDA or lithium<br>
isopropylcyclohexylamide (with LDA being the preferred base) and reagents such as TMU or<br>
DMPU. Typical solvents for use in this reaction include THF, dimethoxycthane, dioxane, or<br>
t-butyl methyl ether (with THF being preferred). This reaction should be conducted at a<br>
temperature ranging from about -80°C to about 25°C.<br>
Referring to route (3) in which the starting material compound (I) is converted<br>
directly to compound (III), compound (I) is fiR5t treated with about 1 to about 1.5 equivalents<br>
of a strong base such as LDA or lithium isopropylcyclohexylamide (with LDA being the<br>
preferred base) in a suitable solvent such as THF, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, t-butyl methyl<br>
ether (with THF being the preferred solvent). The temperature of the reaction should range<br>
from about -100°C to about -60°C. The resulting reaction mixture is then treated with less<br>
than one equivalent of bromochloroethane in the presence of at least four equivalents of<br>
HMPA at a temperature ranging from about -80°C to about 25CC. The resulting reaction<br>
mixture is further contacted with about 1 to about 1.5 equivalents of a strong base such as<br>
LDA or lithium isopropylcyclohexylamide (with LDA being the preferred base) and at least<br>
four equivalents of HMPA in a suitable solvent such as THF, dimethcxyethane, dioxane, or t-<br>
butyl methyl ether (with THF being the preferred solvent). This reaction should be<br>
conducted at a temperature ranging from about -100°C to about<br>
-60°C. Note that no isolation of intermediates are needed in route (3).<br>
There are many methods to further functionalize compound (J), which contains a<br>
carboxyiic acid or ester attached to the R3 moiety. For example, compound (J) can be<br>
converted to the corresponding acrylic acid derivative. One way is to fiR5t hydrolyze the<br>
ester group of compound (J) (provided that Ra is not H) to give the corresponding carboxyiic<br>
acid, reduce the carboxyiic acid to the corresponding alcohol, oxidize the alcohol to the<br>
corresponding aldehyde, and then perform a Wadsworth-Horner-Emmons or Witting reaction<br>
to form the corresponding acrylic acid derivative. See, e.g., Examples 5, 6, 15, 16, and 17.<br>
Compound (J) can also be transformed directly to its corresponding alcohol (see, e.g.,<br>
Example 4). A different variation is to transform compound (J) directly to its corresponding<br>
aldehyde. A further variation, is to transform an ester-containing compound (J) to its<br>
corresponding carboxyiic acid, and then directly to the aldehyde. Alternatively, one can<br>
functionalize the precuR5or compound of the Z-R3 moiety before coupling to the or 1,3-<br>
disubstituted-8-uosubstituted xanthine in scheme 1 or the l,3-disubstituted-5,6-diaminouracil<br>
in scheme 2. Further, compounds of this invention can be prepared on solid support (e.g.,<br>
Wang resin). See Example 36.<br>
FIG. 3 discloses an alternative process to prepare compound (XIV) starting with<br>
compound (IV). The process illustrated in FIG. 2 employs similar chemistry as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 2 but fiR5t prepares the propionic acid side chain on the bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl moiety and<br>
then adds on the 1,3-di-substituted uracil moiety followed by cyclization to give the desired<br>
compound (XIV). With regard to compound (XX), R3 and R4 must be chemically different in<br>
their reactivity (e.g., methyl and benzyl).<br>
FIG. 4 discloses an alternative processes for the transformation of compound (VII) to<br>
the corresponding alcohol (X) and the subsequent transformation of the alcohol (X) to the<br>
olefin (XD). Steps (F') thru (H) are ring closure followed by soponification of the ester<br>
(VIII) to the acid (IX) followed by reduction to the alcohol (X), see Examples 84, 85, and 86.<br>
Alternatively, compound (VII) can undergo reduction (step (Y), see Example 103) and<br>
cyclization reactions to produce compound (X) (step (Z), see, e.g., Example 84a). A further<br>
alternative way involves soponification and cyclization of compound (VII) to produce<br>
compound (DC) (steps (V) and (Z')). These reactions are well known to those skilled in the<br>
art See, e.g., Examples 85a and 84a. Steps (I) thru (DD) disclose altemtive processes for<br>
the transformation of the alcohol (X) to the corresponding olefin (XII). Specifically, steps<br>
(J), (AA) and (CC) (see Examples 89,104, and 105) are alternative ways of transforming the<br>
one carbon aldehyde of compound (XI) to the acrylic acid/ester-containing moiety by means<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, compounds (XXIX) and (XXX) have been previously described<br>
in the literature (Grob, C.A., Rich, R. Helv. Chim. Ada. 1979, 62,2802; Ahmed, S.A.,<br>
Hickmott, P.W. I Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. /, 1979,2180) (i.e., Steps (EE) and (FT)).<br>
Compound (XXX) can be converted to compound (XXXI) by well-known methods. For<br>
example, compound (XXX) may be reduced directly by means of a Wolft-Kishner or<br>
Clemmenson reduction. Alternatively, the ketone functionality of compound (XXX) may<br>
fiR5t be converted to a dithiokeial derivative, such as for example, a 1,3-dithiane, 1,3-<br>
dithiolane or 1,3-dialkylthioketal. This intermediate, would, in turn, be desulfurized by<br>
Raney-Ni. Functional group manipulations of this sort are common and are known to one of<br>
average skill in the art. The following two steps, i.e., steps (GG) and (HH), represent<br>
examples of coupling a 1,3-disubstituted-5,6-diaminouracii with a carboxylic acid followed<br>
by base-mediated ring closure. In Step (II), the tertiary hydroxyl is converted to its<br>
corresponding bromide, iodide or trifluorornethanesulfonate by exposure to PBr3, TMSBr,<br>
TMSI, KI and H3PO4, or trifluoromethancsulfonic anhydride in the presence of a non-<br>
nucleophilic base. Compound (XXXV) would then be formed by treatment of (XXXIV)<br>
with a catalyst derived from a palladium salt (Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2, Pd (O2CCF3), etc.) and a<br>
phosphine ligand (PPh3, P(o-tolyl)3, etc.) followed by treatment with an olefin (such as<br>
methyl acrylate, methylpropiolate, etc.). Hydrogenation of compound (XXXV) followed by<br>
conveR5ion of the ester to the corresponding acid would provide compound (XIV).<br>
Alternatively, the ester could first be converted to the acid and the hydrogenation then<br>
performed to also generate (XIV).<br>
FIG. 6 discloses a process to prepare acid (compound (XXI)) which is the starting<br>
material for FIG. 3. In step (LL), treatment of compound (XXXT) with<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride is the presence of a base such as pyridine affords<br>
XXXVI (R, - OTf). The next step, i.e., step (MM), involves treating compound (XXXVI)<br>
(R, = OTf) with a catalyst derived from a palladium salt (Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2, Pd(O2CCF3) 2,<br>
etc.) and a phosphine ligand (PPh3, P(o-tolyl)3, etc.), which is then followed by exposure to<br>
an olefin (methyl acrylate, methyl propiolate, etc.) to afford compound (XXXVII) (wherein<br>
M = -C=C- or -CH=JH-). In step (NN), compound (XXXVII) undergoes hydrogenation<br>
with palladium on carbon under an atmosphere of hydrogen to yield compound (XXI).<br>
Turning to FIG. 7, compound (X) can be convened to compound (XL) containing a<br>
leaving group (LG) such as, e.g., halo (Cl, Br, or I), mesylate, nosylate, tosylate, and<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonate. The leaving group (LG) can then be displaced by a malonic ester,<br>
such as, e.g., dimethyl malonate, in the presence of a base, such as, e.g., methoxide. The<br>
leaving group (LG) might also be displaced by Meldrum's acid, in the presence of a base<br>
such as methoxide. ConveR5ion of the esteR5 or the cyclic anhydride, in the case of<br>
Meldrum's acid, to the corresponding acids followed by decarboxylation provides compound<br>
(XXXV).<br>
FIG. 8 discloses an overview of the synthetic methods that can be employed to<br>
produce various compounds of the invention. In step 1, treatment of compound 7-1 (Z = Br,<br>
I or OTf, and R = H, tetrahydropyran-2-yl- or 1-pyrollidinylmethyl) with a catalyst derived<br>
from a palladium salt (Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2, Pd(O2CCF3)2, etc.) and a phosphine ligand (PPh3,<br>
P(o-tolyl)3, etc.) is followed by exposure to compound 7-2 (X = Li, ZnCl, MgBr, SnBu3,<br>
B(OH) 2 and R1 = CO2H, CO2Me, COjEt, C CCO2Me, C CCO2Et, CH=CHCO2Me,<br>
CH-CHCO2Et, CH2CH2CO2Me, CH2CH2CO2Et) to afford compound 7-3 (R = H,<br>
tetrahydropyran-2-yl- or 1-pyrollidinylmethyl and R' = CO2H, CO2Me, CQ2Et, CsCCO2Me,<br>
C=CCO2Et, CH-CHCO2Me, CH=HCO2Et, CH2CH2CO2Me, CH2CH2CO2Et). When R =<br>
tetrahydropyran-2-yl- or 1-pyrollidinylmethyl treatment with acid (TFA, PPTS, HC1 etc.)<br>
provides compound 7-3 where R = H. In step 2, treatment of compound 7-2 (Z = Br, I, or<br>
OTf, and R' - CO2H, CO2Me, CO2Et, OCCO2Me, C=CCO2Et, CH-CHCO2Me,<br>
CH^CHCC^Et, CH2CH2CO2MC, CH2CH2CO2Et) with a catalyst derived from a palladium<br>
salt (Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2, Pd(O2CCF3)2, etc.) and a phosphine ligand (PPh3, P(O-tolyl)3, etc.) is<br>
followed by exposure to compound 7-1 (X = Li, ZnCl, MgBr, SnBu3, B(OH)2 and R -<br>
tetrahydropyran-2-yi- or 1-pyrollidinylmethyl) to afford compound 7-3 (R = tetrahydropyran-<br>
2-yl- or 1-pyrollidinylmethyl and R' = CO2H, CO2Me, CO2Et, C=CCO2Me, C=CCO2Et,<br>
CH=HCO2Me CH-CHCO2Et, CH2CH2Me, CH2CH2CO2Et). When R -<br>
tetrahydropyran-2-yl- or 1-pyrollidinylmethyl treatment with acid (TFA, PPTS, HC1 etc.)<br>
provides compound 7-3 where R= H. Step 3 discloses a HATU-mcdiated coupling reaction<br>
of diamino uracil moiety with bicyclo[2.2.2]octane acid (which has been described above).<br>
In step 4, treatment of compound 7-4 (X = Cl, Br, I) with a catalyst derived from a palladium<br>
salt (Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2, Pd(O2CCF3)2, etc.) and a phosphine ligand (PPhj, P(o-tolyl)3, etc.) is<br>
followed by exposure to an olefin (methyl acrylate, methyl propiolate, allyl alcohol, etc.) to<br>
afford compound 7-5 (R1 = C=CCO2Me, C=CCO2Et, CH=CHCO2Me, CH=CHCO2Et,<br>
CH2CH2CHO, etc). Step 5 discloses a base-promoted cyclization of uracil 7-5 to a xanthine<br>
of type 7-3 (which has been described above). Similarly, the base-promoted cyclization of<br>
uracil 7-4 to a xanthine of type 7-6 in step 6 has been described above. In step 7, treatment<br>
of compound 7-6 (X - Cl, Br, I, OTf) with a catalyst derived from a palladium salt<br>
(Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2, Pd(O2CCF3h, etc.) and a phosphine Iigand (PPh3, P(o-tolyl)3, etc.) is<br>
followed by exposure to an olefin (methyl acrylate, methyl propiolate, allyl alcohol, etc.) to<br>
afford compound 7-3 (R - H, R' - C=CCO2Me, CHCCO2Et, CH=CHCO2Me,<br>
CH=CHCO2Et, CH2CH2CHO, etc). Step 8 discloses oxidation of the terminal aldehyde<br>
group in compound 7-3 (R = H, R' = CH2CH2CHO) which is accomplished by standard<br>
means (a. NaClO2, NaH2PO4,2-methyl-2-butene; b. NaI04; etc.)<br>

Uses for the Adenosine Antagonist Compounds<br>
Activation of adenosine receptoR5 elicits many physiological responses, including<br>
reductions in renal blood flow, reductions in glomerular filtration rate, and increases in<br>
sodium reabsorption in kidney. Activation of adenosine receptors reducesheart rate, reduces<br>
conduction velocity, and reduces contractility. These, and the other effects of activation of<br>
adenosine receptors in other organs, are normal regulatory processes. However, these effects<br>
become pathological in many disease states. Thus, adenosine antagonists have extensive<br>
application in both prevention and treatment of disease. Diseases that can be prevented<br>
and/or treated with adenosine receptor antagonists include any conditions (a) marked by the<br>
presence of an abnormal level of adenosine and/or (b) requiring for treatment the inhibition<br>
or stimulation of adenosine production and/or release. Such conditions include, but are not<br>
limited to, congestive heart failure, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, hemorrhagic shock, and<br>
other cardiac and circulatory disorders; degenerative disorders of the central nervous system;<br>
respiratory disorders (e.g.. bronchial asthma, allergic lung diseases); and many diseases for<br>
which diuretic treatment is indicated (e.g., acute and chronic renal failure, renal<br>
insufficiency, hypertension). Degenerative illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, depression,<br>
traumatic brain damage, post-stroke neurological deficit, neonatal brain trauma, dyslexia,<br>
hyperactivity, and cystic fibrosis have all been linked to adenosine receptor activity. Other<br>
conditions in which treatment with adenosine receptor antagonists can have therapeutic<br>
utility include cirrhotic ascites, neonatal apnea, renal failure associated with traditional<br>
diuretic therapy, diabetes, and asthma.<br>
Additionally, applicants have discovered that the administration of highly selective<br>
and potent adenosine A
when administered alone and can potentiate the diuretic response to traditional diuretics. In<br>
addition, administration of adenosine receptor antagonists with traditional diuretics attenuate<br>
the reduction of glornerular filtration rate induced by traditional diuretics. The claimed<br>
methods are applicable, for example, in edematous conditions, such as congestive heart<br>
failure and ascites.<br>
Administration of the Adenosine Antagonist Compounds<br>
The compounds can be administered to an animal (e.g., a mammal such as a human,<br>
non-human primate, hoR5e, dog, cow, pig, sheep, goat, cat, mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit,<br>
hamster, gerbil, ferret, lizard, reptile, or bird). The compounds can be administered in any<br>
manner suitable for the administration of pharmaceutical compounds, including, but not<br>
limited to, pills, tablets, capsules, aerosols, suppositories, liquid formulations for ingestion or<br>
injection or for use as eye or ear drops, dietary supplements, and topical preparations. The<br>
compounds can be administered orally, intranasally, transdermally, intradermally, vaginally,<br>
intraaurally, intraocularly, buccally, rectally, transmucosally, or via inhalation, implantation<br>
(e.g., surgically), or intravenous administration.<br>
Optionally, the compounds can be administered in conjunction with a non-adenosine<br>
modifying pharmaceutical composition (e.g., in combination with a non-adenosine modifying<br>
diuretic as described, for example, in co-pending application PCT/US99/08879 filed<br>
April 23. 1999, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>

Ham's F-12 cell culture medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from GIBCO Life<br>
Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD). Antibiotic G-418, Falcon 150 mM culture plates and .<br>
Costar ,12-well culture plates were purchased from Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA). [3H]CPX was<br>
purchased from DuPont-New England Nuclear Research Products (Boston, MA).<br>
Penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic mixture was purchased from Mediatech (Washington, DC).<br>
The composition of HEPES-buffered Hank's solution was: 130 mM NaCl, 5.0 mM Cl, 1.5<br>
mM CaCl2, 0.41 mM MgS04, 0.49 mM Na2HPO4, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 5.6 mM dextrose, and<br>
5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4).<br>
Membrane preparation<br>
Rat Ai Receptor: Membranes were prepared from rat cerebral cortex isolated from<br>
freshly euthanized rats. Tissues were homogenized in buffer A (10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Na-<br>
HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml benzamidine, 100 mM<br>
PMSF, and 2 mg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin and leupeptin), and centrifuged at 20,000 x g<br>
for 20 min. Pellets were resuspended and washed twice with buffer HE (10 mM Na-HEPES,<br>
1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors). Final pellets were resuspended in buffer HE,<br>
supplemented with 10% (w/v) sucrose and protease inhibitors, and frozen in aliquots at -<br>
80°C Protein concentrations were measured using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).<br>
Human A, Receptor: Human Al adenosine receptor cDNA was obtained by RT-<br>
PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(Invitrogen). Stable transfection of CHO-K1 cells was<br>
performed using LIPOFECTAMINE-PLUS (GIBCO-BRL) and colonies were selected in I<br>
mg/ml G418, and screened using radioligand binding assays. For membrane preparations,<br>
CH0-K1 cells growing as monolayers in complete media (Fl2+lO%FCS+lmg/ml G418)<br>

Alternative Assay Methodology<br>
Materials<br>
See Example 111.<br>
Cell Culture<br>
CHO cells stably expressing the recombinam human AiAdoR (CHO.Ai AdoR cells)<br>
were prepared as described (Kollias-Barker et al.,/. Pharma. Exp, Ther. 281(2), 761, 1997)<br>
and cultured as for CHO.Wild cells. CHO cells were cultured as monolayers on plastic<br>
dishes in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U penicillin<br>
G and 100 ng streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37°C. The<br>
density of [3H]CPX binding sites in CHO cells was 26 ± 2 (n=+4) fmol/mg protein. Cells<br>
were subcultured twice weekly after detachment using I mM EDTA in Ca2+-Mg2+-free<br>
HEPES-buffered Hank's solution. Three different clones of CHO:A|AdoR cells were used<br>
for experiments, and all results were confirmed with cells from two or three clones. The<br>
density of At Adors in these cells was 4000-8000 fmol/mg protein, as determined by assay of<br>
[3HCPX specific binding.<br>
Radiolieand Binding<br>
CHO cells grown on 150 mm culture dishes were rinsed with HEPES-buffered<br>
Hank's solution, then removed with a cell scraper and homogenized in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-<br>
HCI, pH 7.4. Cell membranes were pelleted by cemrifuganon of the cell homogenate at<br>
48,000 X g for 15 minutes. The membrane pellet was washed twice by resuspension in fresh'<br>
buffer and centrifugation. The final pellet was resuspended in a small volume of 50 mM<br>
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and stored in atiquots of I ml at -80°C until used for assays.<br>
To determine the density of A» Adors in CHO cell membranes, 100 jd aliquots of<br>
membranes (5 ug protein) were incubated for 2 hours at 25°C with 0.15-20 nM [3H]CPX and<br>
adenosine deaminase (2 U/ml) in 100 ul of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Incubations were<br>
terminated by dilution with 4 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer and immediate<br>
collection of membranes onto glass-fiber filters (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) by<br>
vacuum filtration (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD). Filters were washed quickly three times<br>
with ice-cold buffer to remove unbound radiohgand. Filter discs containing trapped<br>
membranes bound radioligand were placed in 4 ml of Scintiverse BD (Fisher), and the<br>
radioactivity was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter. To determine nonspecific<br>
binding of [3'HICPX, membranes were incubated as described above and 10 mM CPT was<br>
added to the incubation buffer. Nonspecific binding was defined as [JH]CPX bound in the<br>
presence of 10 mM CPT. Specific binding of the radioligand to the Ai AdoR was determined<br>
by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. Nonspecific binding was found to<br>
increase linearly with an increase of [3H]CPX concentration. Triplicate assays were done at<br>
each tested concentration of [3H]CPX.<br>
To determine the affinities of antagonists of AiAdors for the human recombinant<br>
A i AdoR expressed in CHO cells, binding of 2 nM [3H]CPX in the presence of increasing<br>
concentrations of antagonist was measured. Aliquots of CHO cell membranes (100 m1: 5 mg<br>
protein), [3H]CPX, antagonist (0.1 nM - 100 mM), and adenosine deaminase (2 U/ml) were<br>
incubated for 3 hours at 25° C in 200 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Assays were<br>
terminated as described above.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
Binding parameters (i.e., Bmax, Kd, IC5o, Ki and Hill coefficients) were determined<br>
using the radioligand binding analysis program LIGAND 4.0 (Elsevier-Biosoft).<br>
