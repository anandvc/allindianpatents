THIN FILM PHOTOELECTRIC CONVERTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to improvement in<br>
conversion efficiency of a thin film photoelectric converter,<br>
and more particularly to improvement in conversion efficiency<br>
having a large dimension thin film photoelectric converter<br>
including crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion units<br>
formed by a plasma CVD method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Today, thin film photoelectric converters have become in<br>
wider use, and crystalline silicon photoelectric converters<br>
including crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion units<br>
have been developed in addition to amorphous silicon<br>
photoelectric converters including conventional amorphous<br>
silicon photoelectric conversion units. And moreover, hybrid<br>
type thin film photoelectric converters having these units<br>
stacked therein have also been put in practical use. A term<br>
"crystalline" as used herein represents also a state including<br>
polycrystalline state and microcrystalline state. Terms<br>
"crystalline" and "microcrystalline" as used herein represent<br>
a state partially including amorphous regions.<br>
A thin film photoelectric converter generally comprises<br>
a transparent electrode film sequentially stacked on a<br>
transparent substrate, one or more semiconductor thin film<br>
photoelectric conversion units, and a back electrode film.<br>
And the one semiconductor thin film photoelectric conversion<br>
unit includes an i type layer sandwiched by a p type layer and<br>
an n type layer.<br>
[0004]<br>
On one hand, an i type layer occupying a great portion<br>
of a thickness of the photoelectric conversion unit is made of<br>
a substantially intrinsic semiconductor layer, photoelectric<br>
conversion is mainly formed within this i type layer, and<br>
therefore the layer is referred to as a photoelectric conversion<br>
layer. For larger absorption of light and larger generation<br>
of photo current, this i type layer preferably has a greater<br>
thickness, but a greater thickness more than needed will result<br>
in increase in cost and time for the film-formation.<br>
On the other hand, a p type layer and an n type layer are<br>
referred to as a conductive layer, and these layers serve to<br>
produce diffusion potential within the semiconductor thin film<br>
photoelectric conversion unit. A magnitude of this diffusion<br>
potential influences a value of an open-circuit voltage as one<br>
of properties of the thin film photoelectric converter.<br>
However, these conductive layers are inactive layers with no<br>
contribution to photoelectric conversion. That is, light<br>
absorbed by impurities doped in the conductive layers does not<br>
contribute to power generation, resulting in a loss of light.<br>
Consequently, the p-type and n-type conductive layers<br>
preferably have a thickness as small as possible in a range for<br>
providing a sufficient diffusion potential.<br>
For this reason, in a semiconductor thin film photoelectric<br>
conversion unit or a thin film photoelectric converter, when<br>
the material of the i type layer occupying a major portion is<br>
made of amorphous silicon, the device will be referred to as<br>
an amorphous silicon thin film photoelectric converter or an<br>
amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion unit. And when the<br>
material of the i type layer is made of crystalline silicon,<br>
it will be referred to as a crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
converter or a crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion<br>
unit. This expression is not dependent on whether materials<br>
of the conductive layer included are amorphous or crystalline.<br>
[0007]<br>
Known methods of improving conversion efficiency of a thin film<br>
photoelectric converter involve stacking two or more<br>
photoelectric conversion units in tandem. In this method, a<br>
front unit including a photoelectric conversion layer having<br>
a wider energy band gap is disposed closer to a light incident<br>
side of the photoelectric converter, and behind it disposed is<br>
a rear unit including a photoelectric conversion layer (of a<br>
Si-Ge alloy, for example) having a narrower band gap. This<br>
configuration thereby enables photoelectric conversion over a<br>
wide wavelength range of incident light to improve conversion<br>
efficiency of the entire device.<br>
In such tandem type thin film photoelectric converters, a device<br>
including stacked amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion<br>
units and crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion units<br>
are referred to as a hybrid type thin film photoelectric<br>
converter.<br>
For example, wavelengths of light that may be converted into<br>
electricity by an i type amorphous silicon are up to<br>
approximately 800 nm in a longer wavelength side, but an i type<br>
crystalline silicon can convert light with longer wavelengths<br>
of approximately 1100 nm into electricity. Here, on one hand,<br>
in amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion layers<br>
comprising amorphous silicon having a larger light absorption<br>
coefficient, a thickness of not more than 0.3 micrometers is<br>
enough for sufficient light absorption for photoelectric<br>
conversion. On the other hand, however, in a crystalline<br>
silicon photoelectric conversion layer comprising crystalline<br>
silicon having comparatively smaller light absorption<br>
coefficient, it is preferable to have a thickness of not less<br>
than about 2 to 3 micrometers in order to fully absorb light<br>
with longer wavelengths. That is, a crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion layer usually needs approximately 10<br>
times as large thickness as compared with that for an amorphous<br>
silicon photoelectric conversion layer.<br>
In thin film photoelectric converters, needed are devices<br>
having larger dimension for larger electric generating capacity<br>
and improvement in productive sufficiency. There are various<br>
problems in realizing a large sized device, for example,<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-319692 official report<br>
discloses a following technique. When a transparent substrate<br>
having a transparent conducting layer formed, using plasma CVD<br>
device, on one principal surface and having an dimension of not<br>
less than 1200 cm2 is held with a substrate holder, and is made<br>
to face with an electrode to form a crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion layer with a power flux density of not<br>
less than 100 mW/cm2, the substrate holder and the transparent<br>
conducting layer on a front face of the transparent substrate<br>
are electrically insulated to control abnormal discharge<br>
between the substrate holder and the transparent conducting<br>
layer on the front face of the transparent substrate. It is<br>
assumed that this abnormal discharge occurs, when an amount of<br>
electric charge accumulated in the transparent conducting layer<br>
exceeds a considerable quantity in escaping of the electric<br>
charge held in the transparent conducting layer to the substrate<br>
holder. Since a charge quantity escaping at once to the<br>
substrate holder is dependent on "dimension of substrate /<br>
circumference length of substrate", this value is dependent on<br>
a substrate size. The official report describes that when a<br>
substrate size is large, specifically, when the substrate size<br>
is not less than 1200 cm2, a charge quantity escaping at once<br>
exceeds a certain steady value, and then the abnormal discharge<br>
easily breaks out.<br>
Thin film photoelectric converters with a large dimension<br>
are usually formed as integrated thin film photoelectric<br>
converters. Generally an integrated thin film photoelectric<br>
converter is stacked on a transparent substrate, and the<br>
converter has a structure havincr a plurality of photoelectric<br>
conversion cells comprising a transparent electrode film, one<br>
or more semiconductor thin film photoelectric conversion units,<br>
and a back electrode film, each having a belt-shape connected<br>
in series.<br>
Here, description of an integrated thin film<br>
photoelectric converter will be given referring to/drawings.<br>
Identical referential numerals will be provided with an<br>
identical member in each Figure, and overlapping description<br>
will be omitted.<br>
[0013]<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic plan view showing an integrated<br>
thin film photoelectric converter 1. Still more detailed<br>
description about the integrated thin film photoelectric<br>
converter 1 shown in Figure 1 will be given. Figure 2 is a<br>
schematic sectional view showing the integrated thin film<br>
photoelectric converter 1. The integrated thin film<br>
photoelectric converter 1 shown in Figure 2 is a hybrid type<br>
thin film photoelectric converter, and a photoelectric<br>
conversion cell 10 has a structure wherein a transparent<br>
electrode film 3, an amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion<br>
unit 4a provided with an amorphous silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion layer, a crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4b provided with a crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion layer, and a back electrode film 5,<br>
a sealing resin layer 6, and an organic protective layer 7 are<br>
sequentially stacked on a transparent substrate 2. That is,<br>
this integrated thin film photoelectric converter 1 perform<br>
photoelectric conversion of light entered from a transparent<br>
substrate 2 side by semiconductor thin film photoelectric<br>
conversion units 4a and 4b that form a hybrid type structure.<br>
[0014]<br>
As shown in Figure 2, a first,' and a second isolation<br>
grooves 21 and 22 for dividing the thin film, and a connection<br>
groove 23 are provided in the integrated thin film photoelectric<br>
converter 1. These first and second isolation grooves 21 and<br>
22, and the connection groove 23 are mutually parallel, and<br>
extend in a direction perpendicular to a page space. A boundary<br>
between adjacent photoelectric conversion cells 10 are<br>
specified by the second isolation groove 22.<br>
[0015]<br>
The first isolation groove 21 divides the transparent<br>
electrode film 3 corresponding to each photoelectric conversion<br>
cell 10, and has an opening in an interface between the<br>
transparent electrode film 3 and the amorphous silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion unit 4a, and a surface of the<br>
transparent substrate 2 as a bottom. This first isolation<br>
groove 21 is filled with an amorphous material constituting the<br>
amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion unit 4a, and the<br>
material electrically insulates the. adjacent transparent<br>
electrode films 3 from each other.<br>
[0016]<br>
The second isolation groove 22 is provided in a position<br>
distant from the first isolation groove 21. The second<br>
isolation groove 22 divides the semiconductor thin film<br>
photoelectric conversion units 4a and 4b, and the back electrode<br>
film 5 corresponding to each photoelectric conversion cell 10,<br>
and the groove 22 has an opening in an interface between the<br>
back electrode film 5 and the sealing resin layer 6, and it has<br>
a surface of transparent electrode film 3 as a bottom. This<br>
second isolation groove 22 is filled with a sealing resin layer<br>
6, and the resin electrically insulates the back electrode films<br>
6 from each other between the adjacent photoelectric conversion<br>
cells 10.<br>
[0017]<br>
The connection groove 23 is provided between the first<br>
isolation groove 21 and the second isolation groove 22. This<br>
connection groove 23 divides the semiconductor thin film<br>
photoelectric conversion units 4a and 4b, and has an opening<br>
in an interface between the crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4b and the back electrode film 5, and a surface<br>
of the transparent electrode film 3 as a bottom. This<br>
connection groove 23 is filled with a metallic material<br>
constituting the back electrode film 5, and the metallic<br>
material electrically connects one of the back electrode film<br>
5 of the adjacent photoelectric conversion cells 10 with another<br>
transparent electrode film 3. That is, the connection groove<br>
23 and the metallic material charged therein play a role in<br>
connecting in series the photoelectric conversion cells 10<br>
aligned on the substrate 1 with each other.<br>
[0018]<br>
By the way, in such an integrated thin film photoelectric<br>
converter 1, since the photoelectric conversion cells 10 are<br>
connected in series, a current value of whole of the integrated<br>
thin film photoelectric converter 1 during photoelectric<br>
conversion becomes equal to a current value of a photoelectric<br>
conversion cell 10, in a plurality of photoelectric conversion<br>
cells 10, having the minimum photo current generated in<br>
photoelectric conversion. And, as a result, an excessive photo<br>
current in other photoelectric conversion cells 10 makes a loss .<br>
Then, investigations have been made for keeping uniform a<br>
quality of a film in a surface of the crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion unit 4b. That is, in the integrated<br>
thin film photoelectric converter 1 including the crystalline<br>
silicon photoelectric conversion unit 4b, in order to reduce<br>
the electric current loss mentioned above, efforts have been<br>
made to acquire high photoelectric conversion efficiency by<br>
reducing formation of an area generating only a small photo<br>
current due to difference of crystallinity in the crystalline<br>
silicon photoelectric conversion layer, and furthermore by<br>
making in-plane quality of the film uniform.<br>
[0019]<br>
At this time, areas having a smaller photo current<br>
generated in the crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion<br>
layer may be distinguished from normal areas by visual<br>
observation of a side of the film surface after formation of<br>
the crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion unit 4b, and<br>
it may be observed as a whitish discoloring areas. This<br>
phenomenon is attributed to crystallinity difference in the<br>
crystalline silicon as a material of the crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion layer. On one hand, sufficient<br>
crystallization was not achieved in whitish discoloring areas,<br>
and the areas include not only crystalline silicon but much<br>
amount of amorphous silicon to give whitish and cloudy<br>
appearance, resulting in small amount of photo current. On the<br>
other hand, since they are fully crystallized, normal areas are<br>
observed as areas having gray appearance without whitish<br>
cloudiness, giving larger amount of photo current generated as<br>
compared with that from the whitish discoloring areas.<br>
[0020]<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-330520 official report<br>
discloses that in case of comparatively thin film-formation of<br>
an amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion layer, use of a<br>
higher pressure within a reaction chamber not less than 667 Pa<br>
(5 Torr) enables film-formation of a thicker crystalline<br>
silicon photoelectric conversion layer with high quality at a<br>
higher speed, instead of a conventionally used pressure of not<br>
more than 133 Pa (1 Torr) within a plasma reaction chamber, but<br>
the patent fails to provide description about such a whitish<br>
discoloring areas.<br>
[0021]<br>
However, in a hybrid type thin film photoelectric<br>
converter or a crystalline thin film photoelectric converter<br>
having a dimension of not less than 600 cm2, there has been shown<br>
a problem that when the above-mentioned whitish discoloring<br>
areas do not exist in the crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion layer at all, areas giving a smaller photo current<br>
does not exist, and therefore a short circuit current increases<br>
with increase in light sensitivity, but an open-circuit voltage<br>
and fill factor will drop.<br>
[0022]<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In consideration of the above situations, the present<br>
invention aims at providing a thin film photoelectric converter,<br>
in particular, an integrated thin film photoelectric converter<br>

factor is solved and simultaneously photoelectric conversion<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING-OUT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, more detailed description about embodiments<br>
of the present invention will be given. Description will be<br>
given about each structural element of a thin film photoelectric<br>
converter of the present invention. As a transparent substrate<br>
2, for example, a glass plate, a transparent resin film, etc.<br>
may be used. As a glass plate, glass plates having a large<br>
dimension may be obtained at low price, and float sheet glass<br>
having high transparency and insulative property, having SiO2,<br>
Na2O, and CaO as main components, and furthermore having smooth<br>
principal surfaces may be used.<br>
[0032]<br>
A transparent electrode film 3 may be constituted by a<br>
transparent conductive oxide layer such as an ITO film, a SnO2<br>
film, or a ZnO film etc. The transparent electrode film 3 may<br>
have a single layered structure, or may have a multilayer<br>
structure. The transparent electrode film 3 may be formed using<br>
any known gaseous phase depositing methods, such as a vacuum<br>
deposition method, a CVD method, or a sputtering method. A<br>
surface textured structure including fine unevenness is<br>
preferably formed on a surface of the transparent electrode film<br>
3. Formation of such a textured structure on the surface of<br>
the transparent electrode film 3 may raise incidence efficiency<br>
of light to a semiconductor thin film photoelectric conversion<br>
unit 4.<br>
[0033]<br>
A tandem type thin film photoelectric converter has two<br>
or more semiconductor thin film photoelectric conversion units,<br>
and especially a hybrid type thin film photoelectric converter<br>
has an amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion unit 4a and<br>
a crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion unit 4b.<br>
[0034]<br>
On one hand, the amorphous silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4a has an amorphous silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion layer, and the layer has a structure wherein a p type<br>
layer, an amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion layer, and<br>
an n type layer are stacked sequentially from the transparent<br>
electrode film 3 side. Each of these p type layer, amorphous<br>
silicon photoelectric conversion layers, and n type layers may<br>
be formed by a plasma CVD method.<br>
[0035]<br>
On the other hand, the crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4b has a crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion layer, and for example, the layer has a structure<br>
wherein a p type layer, a crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion layer, and an n type layer are stacked sequentially<br>
from the amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion unit 4a<br>
side. Each of these p type layer, crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion layer, and n type layer may be formed<br>
by a plasma CVD method.<br>
[0036]<br>
The p type layer constituting these semiconductor thin<br>
film photoelectric conversion units 4a and 4b may be formed,<br>
for example, by doping an impurity atom for determining a<br>
conductivity type of p type, such as boron and aluminum, into<br>
silicon alloys, such as silicon, silicon carbide, and silicon<br>
germanium. And the amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion<br>
layer and the crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion<br>
layer may be formed with amorphous silicon based semiconductor<br>
materials and crystalline silicon based semiconductor<br>
materials, respectively. As such materials, intrinsic<br>
semiconductor silicon (hydrogenated silicon etc.) , and silicon<br>
alloys, such as silicon carbide and silicon germanium, etc. may<br>
be mentioned. Moreover, silicon based semiconductor materials<br>
of weak p type or weak n type including a small amount of<br>
conductivity type determination impurities may also be used,<br>
if they have sufficient photoelectric conversion function.<br>
Furthermore, the n type layer may be formed by doping an impurity<br>
atom for determining a conductivity type of n type, such as<br>
phosphorus and nitrogen, into silicon or silicon alloys, such<br>
as silicon carbide and silicon germanium.<br>
[0037]<br>
The amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion unit 4a and the<br>
crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion unit 4b that are<br>
constituted as mentioned above have mutually different<br>
absorption wavelength region. Since a photoelectric<br>
conversion layer of the amorphous silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4a is constituted by amorphous silicon, and a<br>
photoelectric conversion layer of the crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion unit 4b is constituted by crystalline<br>
silicon, the former may be expected to absorb an optic element<br>
of approximately 550 nm of wavelength most efficiently, and the<br>
latter may be expected to absorb about an optic element of<br>
approximately 900 nm of wavelength most efficiently.<br>
[0038]<br>
On one hand, a thickness of the amorphous silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion unit 4a is preferably within a range<br>
of 0.01 micrometers to 0.5 micrometers, and more preferably<br>
within a range of 0.1 micrometers to 0.3 micrometers.<br>
[0039]<br>
On the other hand, a thickness of the crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion unit 4b is preferably within a range<br>
of 0 .1 micrometers to 10 micrometers, and more preferably within<br>
a range of 0.1 micrometers to 5 micrometers.<br>
[0040]<br>
The back electrode film 5 not only has a function as an<br>
electrode, but has a function as a reflecting layer for<br>
reflecting light that entered from the transparent substrate<br>
2 into the semiconductor thin film photoelectric conversion<br>
units 4a and 4b, and that is made to reach the back electrode<br>
film 5, the reflecting layer making the reflected light re-enter<br>
into the semiconductor thin film photoelectric conversion units<br>
4a and 4b. The back electrode film 5 may be formed to have a<br>
thickness of approximately 200 nm to 400 nm by a vacuum<br>
deposition method, a sputtering method, etc. using, for example,<br>
silver, aluminum, etc.<br>
[0041]<br>
Between the back electrode film 5 and the semiconductor<br>
thin film photoelectric conversion units 4, or between the back<br>
electrode film 5 and the crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4b in case of a hybrid type thin film<br>
photoelectric converter, maybe formed a transparent conductive<br>
thin film (not shown) comprising nonmetallic substance like ZnO<br>
in order to improve, for example, adhesive property between both<br>
of the films.<br>
[0042]<br>
Each photoelectric conversion cell 10 formed on the<br>
transparent substrate 2 of the integrated thin film<br>
photoelectric converter 1 is sealed with an organic protective<br>
layer 7 via a sealing resin layer 6. As this sealing resin layer<br>
6, resins enabling adhesion of the organic protective layer onto<br>
these cells 10 are used. As such resins, for example, EVA<br>
(ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer), PVB (polyvinyl butyral),<br>
PIB (polyisobutylene), silicone resins, etc. may be used. As<br>
organic protective layer 7, may be used fluororesin films like<br>
polyvinyl fluoride films (for example, Tedlar film (registered<br>
trademark)) or insulative films excellent in moisture<br>
resistance and water resisting property like PET film. The<br>
organic protective layer may have a single layered structure,<br>
and may have a stacked structure having the single layers<br>
stacked therein. Furthermore, the organic protective layer<br>
may have a structure wherein a metallic foil comprising aluminum<br>
etc. is sandwiched with these films. Since metallic foils like<br>
aluminum foil have a function for improving moisture resistance<br>
and water resisting property, the organic protective layer<br>
having such a structure enables more effective protection of<br>
the photoelectric conversion cell 10 from moisture. These<br>
sealing resin layer 6 / organic protective layer 7 may be<br>
simultaneously attached to a back face side of the integrated<br>
thin film photoelectric converter 1 by a vacuum laminating<br>
method.<br>
[0043]<br>
When a substrate holder 31 as shown in Figure 3 is used<br>
at the time of formation of the crystalline silicon thin film<br>
photoelectric conversion unit 4b, as shown in Figure 3, one or<br>
more insulated isolation grooves 14 are formed in parallel with<br>
an integration direction 50 that is a direction of series<br>
connection of the photoelectric conversion cell 10 shown in<br>
Figure 1 on the transparent electrode film 2.<br>
[0044]<br>
By the way, the whitish discoloring area is visually<br>
observable from a film side after formation of the crystalline<br>
silicon thin film photoelectric conversion unit 4b. The<br>
whitish discoloring area has a certain amount of uncertainty<br>
under completely same conditions. Especially in case of a<br>
larger dimension, temperature distribution, plasma density<br>
distribution, spatial relationship with the substrate holder,<br>
etc. make the uncertainty much more remarkable. This<br>
phenomenon increases necessity for control of whitish<br>
discoloring area, but the necessity may not be taken into<br>
consideration in case of a smaller dimension. Suitable amount<br>
of whitish discoloring areas need to exist in suitable areas.<br>
[0045]<br>
A percentage of a dimension to whole of the photoelectric<br>
conversion area of the whitish discoloring area is preferably<br>
not more than 5%. If a percentage of the whitish discoloring<br>
area exists not less than the percentage mentioned above, drop<br>
of short circuit current will exceed improvement in<br>
open-circuit voltage and fill factor. In case of an integrated<br>
thin film photoelectric converter 1 with a structure integrated<br>
in series, the whitish discoloring areas preferably exist on<br>
both ends or one end of a side parallel to the integration<br>
direction 50 with respect to each photoelectric conversion cell<br>
10 of the integrated thin film photoelectric converter 1. In<br>
that case drop of a short circuit current will exceed<br>
improvement in an open-circuit voltage and fill factor, when<br>
the whitish discoloring areas exist within a range of not less<br>
than 2 mm to not more than 10 mm in an inward direction of the<br>
photoelectric conversion cell 10 from boundary of the<br>
photoelectric conversion cell 10 of parallel side with respect<br>
to a direction where photoelectric conversion cell 10 is<br>
connected in series, that is an integration direction. In an<br>
area of the photoelectric conversion area 52 and a circumference<br>
area of the non-photoelectric conversion area on one principal<br>
surface of the transparent substrate 2, when the transparent<br>
electrode film 2 is divided parallel to the integration<br>
direction 50 with borders of the insulated isolation grooves<br>
14, by forming the insulated isolation grooves 14, the whitish<br>
discoloring areas tend to appear in a long and slender shape<br>
along the boundary in the integration direction 50.<br>
[0046]<br>
Conversely, when the whitish discoloring areas exist in<br>
a side perpendicular to the integration direction, and when only<br>
one of a plurality of photoelectric conversion cells 10 is<br>
wholly the whitish discoloring area, light sensitivity of the<br>
photoelectric conversion cell 10 becomes very low, and short<br>
circuit current will become small. Therefore, in this case,<br>
even if a percentage of a dimension of whitish discoloring area<br>
is not more than 5%, a short circuit current of an integrated<br>
thin film photoelectric converter 1 as a whole will become<br>
extremely small, due to serial integration structure thereof,<br>
causing decrease in photoelectric conversion efficiency.<br>
[0047]<br>
The whitish discoloring area does not actually formed<br>
with a same dimension in all of the photoelectric conversion<br>
cells 10, and therefore if they are formed on both ends with<br>
a width of approximately 6 mm on an average, and if the whitish<br>
discoloring areas are not formed in a direction perpendicular<br>
to the integration direction 50, a percentage of the whitish<br>
discoloring areas becomes not more than 5%, when a length of<br>
direction perpendicular to the integration direction 50 of the<br>
photoelectric conversion cell is not less than 240 mm. In fact,<br>
not only on both ends of a direction parallel to the integration<br>
direction of the integrated thin film photoelectric converter<br>
1, but on both ends of a direction perpendicular to the<br>
integration direction, the whitish discoloring areas of an<br>
almost same percentage will be formed. For this reason, when<br>
integration of the converter is to be performed so as to exclude<br>
the cloudy portion in this direction perpendicular to the<br>
integration direction, a size of the integrated thin film<br>
photoelectric converter 1 needs to be not less than 600 cm2,<br>
that is , not less than 240 mm x 250 mm, in order to realize<br>
an integrated thin film photoelectric converter 1 having not<br>
more than 5% of whitish discoloring areas, and having a width<br>
from a boundary parallel to the integration direction of not<br>
less than 2 mm and not more than 10 mm.<br>
[0048]<br>
Although the whitish discoloring areas can be easily<br>
distinguished from a film side also after formation of the back<br>
electrode film 5, the areas may hardly be distinguished by<br>
visual inspection from a surface on which the semiconductor thin<br>
film photoelectric conversion unit 4 of the transparent<br>
substrate 2 is not formed, after sealing by resins etc. However,<br>
these areas may be distinguished from a surface of the<br>
transparent substrate 2 on which the semiconductor thin film<br>
photoelectric conversion unit is not formed by spectral<br>
reflectance measurement using a spectrum reflectometer. In<br>
spectrum reflective measurement, measured is a reflection<br>
including diffusion components with an incident angle of 10<br>
degrees using an integrating sphere, determining a value on the<br>
basis of barium sulfate board. The whitish discoloring area<br>
may be determined by a definition that the whitish discoloring<br>
area has a spectral reflectance in 800 nm in spectral<br>
reflectance measurement on the conditions not less than 5% as<br>
large as a spectral reflectance of areas without whitish<br>
discoloring.<br>
[0049]<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
(Example 1)<br>
A glass substrate 2 having a SnO2 film 3 formed on one principal<br>
surface and having a size measuring 910 mm x 910 mm was prepared.<br>
Isolation grooves 21 and insulated isolation grooves 14 were<br>
formed by a laser scriber in an SnO2 film 3 formed on a surface<br>
of this glass substrate, as shown in Figure 1. As shown in<br>
Figure 3, at the time of installation to a substrate holder 31<br>
of the plasma CVD device, a first insulation isolation groove<br>
14a having a width of approximately 100 micrometers was formed<br>
approximately 1 mm spaced apart from an inner circumference of<br>
the substrate holder 31. Furthermore, a second insulation<br>
isolation groove 14b having a width of approximately 100<br>
micrometers was formed in a position having approximately 0.7<br>
mm apart inside from the first insulation isolation groove 14a.<br>
[0050]<br>
In case of formation of a crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion unit 4b with a high power density of<br>
not less than 100 mW/cm2 by a plasma CVD method on a substrate<br>
having a large dimension of not less than 1200 cm2, these<br>
insulation isolation grooves 14 insulate the substrate holder<br>
31 from a transparent conducting layers 2 on a surface of the<br>
substrate to prevent abnormal discharge.<br>
[0051]<br>
The glass substrate 2 having one sheet of SnO2 film 3 to which<br>
the above-mentioned laser scribe was given was held in the<br>
substrate holder 31. Allowing for a shift of a position of the<br>
glass substrate 2 at this time, a distance from an inner<br>
circumference of the substrate holder 31 to the first insulation<br>
isolation groove 14a would be in a range of 3+2 mm. A substrate<br>
holder 31 holding the glass substrate 2 was carried in within<br>
a CVD system with an electrode (115 cm x 118 cm) installed. A<br>
silane, hydrogen, methane, and diborane were introduced as<br>
reactive gases. After formation of a p type layer, the silane<br>
was introduced as a reactive gas to form an amorphous silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion layer. After that, the silane,<br>
hydrogen, and phosphine were introduced to form an n type layer<br>
as reactive gases. An amorphous silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4a was thus formed.<br>
[0052]<br>
Then, the silane, hydrogen, and diborane were introduced<br>
as reactive gases to form a p type layer, and subsequently<br>
hydrogen and the silane were introduced as reactive gases under<br>
flow rate conditions shown in Example 1 of Table 1 to form a<br>
crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion layer. After<br>
that, the silane, hydrogen, and phosphine were introduced as<br>
reactive gases to form an n type layer. A crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion unit 4b was thus formed.<br>
[0053]<br>
After formation of the crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4b, the amorphous silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4a and the crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4b were laser scribed to form a connection<br>
groove 23. And furthermore, a back electrode film 5 as a double<br>
layer film of a ZnO film and an Ag film as a back electrode film<br>
was formed by a sputtering method. Then, the amorphous silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion unit 4a, the crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion unit 4b, and the back electrode film<br>
5 were laser scribed to form an isolation groove 22.<br>
Furthermore, the circumference insulation grooves 42a and 42b<br>
shown in Fig. 4 were formed by laser scribing of the SnO2 film<br>
3, the amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion unit 4a, the<br>
crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion unit 4b, and the<br>
back face electrode film 5. Before attachment of lead wires<br>
12, as shown in Figure 4, the substrate was divided into a half<br>
size along with a cutting line 41 in a direction parallel to<br>
the integration direction 50. Thus a hybrid type integrated<br>
thin film photoelectric converter 1 with a size of 910 mm x 455<br>
mm wherein 100 of photoelectric conversion cells 10 having a<br>
size of 8. 9 mm x 430 mm were connected in series was produced.<br>
Here, the circumference insulation grooves 42a were formed on<br>
the insulated isolation grooves 14 beforehand formed on the SnO2<br>
film 3.<br>
[0054]<br>
A surface of the crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4b of this hybrid type integrated thin film<br>
photoelectric converter 1 was observed after formation of the<br>
conversion unit 4b, and whitish discoloring areas 51 discolored<br>
in white were observed on both ends of the photoelectric<br>
conversion cell 10, as schematically shown in Figure 4. Figure<br>
5 shows a visual appearance photograph of the whitish<br>
discoloring areas. In case of a hybrid type integrated thin<br>
film photoelectric converter 1 with a size measuring 910 mm x<br>
455 mm, this whitish discoloring area 51 existed within a width<br>
of not less than 5 mm and not more than 10 mm from one of the<br>
circumference insulation isolation grooves 42a parallel to the<br>
integration direction 50. When an area surrounded with the<br>
circumference insulation isolation grooves 42a and 42b is<br>
defined as a photoelectric conversion area 52 here, the whitish<br>
discoloring area 51 occupied an area of approximately 2% to a<br>
gross dimension of the photoelectric conversion area 52.<br>
[0055]<br>
Measured was a sample wherein the hybrid type integrated<br>
thin film photoelectric converter 1 having the whitish<br>
discoloring area 51 for a spectral reflectance using a light<br>
entered from a glass surface 2 side. Measurement of the<br>
spectral reflectance was carried out by measuring a reflection<br>
including diffusion components with an incident angle of 10<br>
degrees using an integrating sphere on the basis of barium<br>
sulfate board. Measured result showed that the whitish<br>
discoloring area 51 had a value not less than 5% larger than<br>
a value in a normal area in spectral reflectance in 800 nm. That<br>
is, a test result of spectral reflectance for 9 points shown<br>
in Figure 6 as shown in Example 1 of Table 2 gave a difference<br>
of the absolute values of 12.1%. Here, points of measurement<br>
of 1, 4, and 7 correspond to the whitish discoloring areas 51,<br>
and points of measurement of 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 correspond<br>
to the normal areas.<br>
[0056]<br>
An initial output as an output before photodegradation<br>
by optical exposure of this hybrid type integrated thin film<br>
photoelectric converter 1 may be obtained from a an electrical<br>
property of a light of a solar simulator of AM 1.5 using a xenon<br>
and a halogen lamp as a light source having an irradiance of<br>
100 mW/cm2 being entered from a glass surface side. A<br>
measurement temperature was set at 25 degrees C. As shown in<br>
Example 1 of Table 3, the initial output gave 42.8 W. At this<br>
time, a short circuit current, an open-circuit voltage, and a<br>
fill factor gave 0.456 A, 135.5 V, and 0.692, respectively.<br>
[0057]<br>
Table 1 shows relationship between film-formation flow<br>
rate conditions of the crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion layers, and the whitish discoloring areas in the<br>
hybrid type integrated thin film photoelectric converters of<br>

Table 2 shows spectral reflectances at 800 nm of the<br>
hybrid type integrated thin film photoelectric converters in<br>

[0059]<br>
Table 3 shows photoelectric transfer characteristics of<br>
the hybrid type integrated thin film photoelectric converter<br>
in each of Examples and Comparative Examples.<br>
[0060]<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
Except for having formed a crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion layer under a flow rate conditions<br>
shown in Comparative Example 1 of Table 1, a hybrid type<br>
integrated thin film photoelectric converter 1 of Comparative<br>
Example 1 was produced in a same manner as in Example 1. In<br>
the hybrid type integrated thin film photoelectric converter<br>
1 of Comparative Example 1, obtained was a hybrid type<br>
integrated thin film photoelectric converter 1 having a size<br>
measuring 910 mm x 455 mm in which whitish discoloring area 51<br>
was not recognized by film side observation before sealing. As<br>
in Example 1, measurement of an initial output and a spectral<br>
reflectance of the hybrid type integrated thin film<br>
photoelectric converter 1 of Comparative Example 1 gave results<br>
of Comparative Example 1 in Table 3, and Comparative Example<br>
1 in Table 2, respectively. A difference of absolute values<br>
of spectral reflectance at 800 nm gave not more than 5%, the<br>
initial output gave 40.1 W, and the short circuit current, the<br>
open-circuit voltage, and the fill factor gave 0.455 A, 129.5<br>
V, and 0.681, respectively. The Comparative Example 1 gave<br>
obviously a lower open-circuit voltage and a fill factor as<br>
compared with those in Example 1, and also gave a low value for<br>
the initial output.<br>
[0061]<br>
[0063]<br>
(Example 2)<br>
Except for having formed a crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion layer under a flow rate condition<br>
shown in Example 2 of Table 1, a hybrid type integrated thin<br>
film photoelectric converter 1 of Example 2 was produced in a<br>
same manner as in Example 1. In the hybrid type integrated thin<br>
film photoelectric converter 1 of Example 2, by a film side<br>
observation before sealing, whitish discoloring areas 51<br>
discolored white were identified on both ends of the<br>
photoelectric conversion cell 10 as shown in Figure 4. In case<br>
of the hybrid type integrated thin film photoelectric converter<br>
1 having a size measuring 910 mm x 455 mm, this whitish<br>
discoloring area 51 existed in a range of not less than 15 mm<br>
and not more than 30 mm from one of the two circumference<br>
insulation isolation grooves 42a parallel to the integration<br>
direction 50. The whitish discoloring areas 51 occupied<br>
approximately 5.5% to a gross dimension of the photoelectric<br>
conversion area 52.<br>
[0064]<br>
The hybrid type integrated thin film photoelectric<br>
converter 1 of Example 2 was measured for spectral reflectances<br>
at 9 points as shown in Figure 6 in a same manner as in Example<br>
1. As shown in Example 2 in Table 2, a difference of absolute<br>
values of spectral reflectances at 800 nm gave 11.7%. Here,<br>
points of measurement 1, 4, and 7 correspond to whitish<br>
discoloring areas 51, and points of measurement 2, 3, 5, 6, 8,<br>
and 9 correspond to normal areas.<br>
[0065]<br>
Measurement in a same manner as in Example 1 of an initial<br>
output of the hybrid type integrated thin film photoelectric<br>
converter 1 of Example 2 gave 41.2 W, as shown in Example 2 in<br>
Table 3. A short circuit current, an open-circuit voltage, and<br>
a fill factor gave 0.441 A, 136.7 V, and 0.683, respectively.<br>
Example 2 gave a higher open-circuit voltage and a higher fill<br>
factor as compared with those in Comparative Example 1, and also<br>
gave a higher initial output. And it gave a little lower value<br>
of a short circuit current and also a little low initial output<br>
as compared with those in Example 1.<br>
[0066]<br>
(Example 3)<br>
A glass substrate 2 having an SnO2 film 3 formed on one<br>
principal surface thereof and having a size measuring 365 mm<br>
x 465 mm was prepared, and isolation grooves 21 were formed on<br>
this substrate, as shown in Figure 7.<br>
[0067]<br>
Without using a substrate holder, the glass substrate 2<br>
was moved in a position having an electrode size measuring 400<br>
mm x 500 mm of a single wafer processing plasma CVD device<br>
enabling conveyance of the glass substrate 2 with a conveying<br>
fork, and an amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion unit<br>
4a and a crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion unit 4b<br>
were formed using a same gas composition as in Example 1. This<br>
time, a crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion layer was<br>
formed under flow rate conditions shown in Example 3 in Table<br>
1. After formation of the crystalline silicon photoelectric<br>
conversion unit 4b, connection grooves 23 were formed by a laser<br>
scribe method, and then a back electrode film 5 as a double layer<br>
film of a ZnO film and an Ag film was formed as a back electrode<br>
film by a sputtering method. Then, isolation grooves 22, and<br>
circumference insulation grooves 42a and 42b as shown in Figure<br>
4 were formed by a laser scribe method. And subsequently, lead<br>
wires 12 was attached to produce a hybrid type integrated thin<br>
film photoelectric converter 1 having a size measuring 300 mm<br>
x 400 mm wherein 28 pieces of photoelectric conversion cells<br>
10 with a size measuring 8. 9 mm x 380 mm were connected in series<br>
together.<br>
[0068]<br>
As schematically shown in Figure 7, whitish discoloring<br>
areas 51 colored white on both ends of the photoelectric<br>
conversion cell 10 were identified by observation from a film<br>
side before sealing of this hybrid type integrated thin film<br>
photoelectric converter 1. The whitish discoloring areas 51<br>
were observed in a range of not less than 2 mm and not more than<br>
6 mm from both of the circumference insulation isolation grooves<br>
42a parallel to the integration direction 50, and a percentage<br>
of the whitish discoloring areas 51 gave approximately 3% to<br>
a gross dimension of the photoelectric conversion area 52.<br>
[0069]<br>
The hybrid type integrated thin film photoelectric converter<br>
1 of Example 3 was measured for a spectral reflectance in 9 points<br>
as shown in Figure 8 in a same manner as in Example 1. As shown<br>
in Example 3 in Table 2, a difference of absolute values of the<br>
spectral reflectance at 800 nm gave 9.9%. Here, points of<br>
measurement 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 correspond to the whitish<br>
discoloring area 51, and points of measurement 2, 5, and 8<br>
correspond to normal areas.<br>
[0070]<br>
The hybrid type integrated thin film photoelectric<br>
converter 1 of this Example 3 was measured for an initial output<br>
in a same manner as in Example 1 to obtain 12.3 W as shown in<br>
Example 3 in Table 3. At this time, a short circuit current,<br>
an open-circuit voltage, and a fill factor gave 0.439 A, 37.8<br>
V, and 0.741, respectively.<br>
[0071]<br>
(Comparative Example 2)<br>
Except for having formed a crystalline silicon<br>
photoelectric conversion layer under flow rate conditions shown<br>
in Comparative Example 2 in Table 1, a hybrid type integrated<br>
thin film photoelectric converter 1 of Comparative Example 2<br>
was produced in a same manner as in Example 3. In the hybrid<br>
type integrated thin film photoelectric converter 1 of<br>
Comparative Example 2, obtained was a hybrid type integrated<br>
thin film photoelectric converter 1 having a size measuring 300<br>
mm x 400 mm wherein whitish discoloring areas 51 were not<br>
recognized by observation from a film side before sealing. The<br>
hybrid type integrated thin film photoelectric converter 1 of<br>
Comparative Example 2 was measured for an initial output and<br>
spectral reflectance in a same manner as in Example 1 to obtain<br>
results for Comparative Example 2 in Table 2, and for<br>
Comparative Example 2 in Table 3, respectively. A difference<br>
of absolute values of the spectral reflectance at 800 nm gave<br>
not more than 5%, and an initial output gave 11.8 W. A short<br>
circuit current, an open-circuit voltage, and a fill factor gave<br>
0.441 A, 37.0 V, and 0.681, respectively. The Comparative<br>
Example 2 showed obviously lower open-circuit voltage and fill<br>
factor as compared with those in Example 3, and also showed a<br>
lower initial output.<br>
[0072]<br>
(Example 4)<br>
A crystalline silicon photoelectric conversion layer formed<br>
under flow rate conditions shown in Example 4 in Table 1 gave<br>
whitish discoloring areas 51 discolored white on both ends of<br>
a photoelectric conversion cell 10, as schematically shown in<br>
Figure 7. In case of the obtained layer used for a hybrid type<br>
integrated thin film photoelectric converter 1 having a size<br>
measuring 300 mm x 400 mm, this whitish discoloring area 51<br>
existed in a range of not less than 5 mm and not more than 16<br>
mm from one of two circumference insulation isolation grooves<br>
42a parallel to the integration direction 50. A percentage of<br>
the whitish discoloring area 51 to a gross dimension of the<br>
photoelectric conversion area 52 gave approximately 5.2%.<br>
Measurement, in a same manner as in Example 1, of spectral<br>
reflectance in 9 points as shown in Figure 8 gave 9.6% of<br>
difference of absolute values of spectral reflectance in 800<br>
nm as shown in Example 4 of Table 2.<br>
[0073]<br>
A same measurement as in Example 1 gave 12.1 W for initial<br>
output, as shown in Example 4 in Table 3. A short circuit<br>
current, an open-circuit voltage, and a fill factor gave 0.435<br>
A, 38.1 V, and 0.728, respectively. Example 4 gave a higher<br>
open-circuit voltage and a higher fill factor, and also a higher<br>
initial output as compared with that in Comparative Example 2.<br>
And it gave a little lower short circuit current and a little<br>
lower initial output as compared with those in Example 2.<br>
