As described above, the protecting member 66, the discharge assisting member 65 including the first discharge assisting member 63 having the dielectric material layer A applied on the both side surfaces thereof and the second discharge member 64, and the discharge cap member 67 having the notch part 67d formed at the apex portion thereof are applied sequentially by passing the pillar part 62d of the dielectric isolated member 62 through the center portion in the top of the discharge member 40 fixed to the coupling projection 22 of the base member 20.   The coupling member 68 is screw-coupled with the<br>
10<br><br>
coupling screw part 62c of the pillar part 62d to press and fix the protecting member 66, the discharge assisting member 65 and the discharge cap member 67. As the protecting member 66, the discharge assisting member 65 and the discharge cap member 67 are pressed and fixed by the coupling member 68, the connecting member 69 is inserted and locked toward the through hole 62d of the pillar part 62d. Then, the upper cap member 61 having the hemisphere section is rested on the upper surface of the isolated member 62 through the screw projection 69b protruded-formed on the top of the connecting member 69, and accordingly the connecting piece 42 of the discharge member 40 is inserted toward the inserting groove 69c formed in the connecting member 69. Then, the fixed screw B is screw-coupled with the screw hole 69d formed in the diameter-expanded part 69a to fix the potential modifying unit 60 and thereby an installation of the lightning air-terminals is completed.<br>
In the case that the thundercloud is approached to the bipolar discharge-dissipation lightning air-terminals 10 of the present invention installed as described above, (+) earth charge is focused on the distance compensating member 70 pressed and fixed on the upper cap member 61 of the potential modifying unit 60, the discharge member 40 and the discharge part 44 of the discharge member 40, and (-) charge opposite to the earth charge is charged on the discharge cap member 67 without contact with the upper cap member 61 and the distance compensating member 70 by the dielectric isolated member 62. The discharging of the earth charge following the thundercloud approach occurs in the space between the discharge cap member 67 and the distance compensating member 70. As a result, the earth potential value is decreased to an electric field below a flashover voltage.<br>
Fig. 9A is a picture in which a discharge phenomenon of a conventional brush type of lightning air-terminal is photographed, wherein this photographing is performed by opening an iris of a camera for 15 seconds after-120 kV of DC voltage is applied to the lightning air-terminal. Fig. 9B is a picture in which a corona discharge phenomenon of the bipolar discharge-dissipation lightning air-terminal according to the present invention is photographed, wherein this photographing is performed by opening an iris of a camera for 15 seconds after-120 kV of DC voltage is applied to the lightning air-terminal in the case that a spaced distance between the potential modifying unit and the discharge member is 20 cm. As shown in the above pictures, the bipolar discharge-dissipation lightning air- terminal according to the present invention is more excellent than the conventional lightning air-terminal in efficiency of dispersing accumulated earth charges to the space.<br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
As apparent from the above description, the bipolar discharge-dissipation lightning air-terminals of the present invention includes the dielectric isolated member on the distance compensating member which is fixed by pressing the upper surface of the discharge part, and the potential modifying unit having different charges by electric dipole, bipolar and electric double layer action. Therefore, a capacitance is increased corresponding to the thundercloud approach by the first discharge assisting member of the potential modifying unit. Also, the discharge beginning voltage of the earth voltage is lowered by the second discharge assisting member and the earth charge following the thundercloud approach is dispersed and discharged in the space separated between the upper surface of the distance compensating member fixed on the discharge part and the potential modifying unit. As a result, the earth potential value is decreased to the electric field below the flashover voltage to prevent the falling of the thunderbolt, thereby allowing it to protect telecommunication systems, low energy power products installed in a protected object, electronics products.<br>
