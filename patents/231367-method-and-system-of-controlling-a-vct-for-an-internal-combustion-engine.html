ELECTRONIC VCT CONTROL by Quinn, Jr., Stanley B et al discloses a Variable Cam<br>
Timing (VCT) control system , there are conditions when the system must operate in an<br>
open-loop mode, and other situations where closed-loop operation is desired. A number of<br>
operating states is provided for VCT control system to switch between the states. A<br>

United States published patent application No. 20040040525A1 entitled Method to<br>
reduce noise of a cam phaser by controlling the position of center mounted spool valve by<br>
Simpson, Roger discloses a method to reduce the noise caused by torsional reversals of a<br>
rotor hitting the phaser housing in a VCT cam timing system. A cam torque actuated<br>
phaser (phaser with check valves) the control loop is opened and rather then moving the<br>
spool valve to one end or the other end, the spool valve is moved just slightly off null. By<br>
doing this the oil ports in the spool passageways that control the motion of the phaser are<br>
restricted and the motion of the phaser is reduced. Therefore the noise of the phaser is<br>
reduced.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
This section includes the descriptions of the present invention including the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention for the understanding of the same. It is<br>
noted that the embodiments are merely describing the invention. The claims section of the<br>
present invention defines the boundaries of the property right conferred by law.<br>
United States Patent 5,289,805, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference,<br>
entitled: Self-Calibrating Variable Camshaft Timing System, discloses a closed-loop<br>
actuator is a variable force solenoid (VFS). The system in 5,289,805 patent may be<br>
depicted as a feedback loop as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a prior art feedback loop 10 is shown. The control objective of<br>
feedback loop 10 is to have a spool valve in a null position. In other words, the objective<br>
is to have no fluid flowing between two fluid holding chambers of a phaser (not shown)<br>
such that the VCT mechanism at the phase angle given by a set point 12 with the spool 14<br>
stationary in its null position. This way, the VCT mechanism is at the correct phase<br>
position and the phase rate of change is zero. A control computer program product which<br>
utilizes the dynamic state of the VCT mechanism is used to accomplish the above state.<br>
The VCT closed-loop control mechanism is achieved by measuring a camshaft<br>
phase shift 0o 16, and comparing the same to the desired set point 12. The VCT<br>
mechanism is in turn adjusted so that the phaser achieves a position which is determined<br>
by the set point 12. A control law 18 compares the set point 12 to the phase shift θ0 16.<br>
The compared result is used as a reference to issue commands to a solenoid 20 to position<br>
the spool 14. This positioning of spool 14 occurs when the phase error (the difference<br>
between set point r 12 and phase shift 16) is non-zero.<br>
The spool 14 is moved toward a first direction (e.g. right) if the phase error is<br>
negative (retard) and to a second direction (e.g.. left) if the phase error is positive<br>
(advance). It is noted that the retarding with current phase measurement scheme gives a<br>
larger value, and advancing yields a small value. When the phase error is zero, the VCT<br>
phase equals the set point 12 so the spool 14 is held in the null position such that no fluid<br><br>
flows within the spool valve. Note the functional relationship 15 of control fluid flow<br>
status versus spool valve 14 positions.<br>
Camshaft and crankshaft measurement pulses in the VCT system are generated by<br>
camshaft and crankshaft pulse wheels 22 and 24, respectively. As the crankshaft (not<br>
shown) and camshaft (also not shown) rotate, wheels 22, 24 rotate along with them. The<br>
wheels 22, 24 possess teeth which can be sensed and measured by sensors according to<br>
measurement pulses generated by the sensors. The measurement pulses are detected by<br>
camshaft and crankshaft measurement pulse sensors 22a and 24a, respectively. The<br>
sensed pulses are used by a phase measurement device 26. A measurement phase<br>
difference is then determined. The phase between a camshaft and a crankshaft is defined<br>
as the time from successive crank-to-cam pulses, divided by the time for an entire<br>
revolution and multiplied by 360 degrees. The measured phase may be expressed as θ0 16.<br>
This phase is then supplied to the control law 18 for reaching the desired spool position.<br>
Solenoid 20 typically is a variable force solenoid (VFS) where the force exerted<br>
upon spool 14 varies thereby causing different displacement of spool 14 along a<br>
predetermined line thereby causing variable amount of control fluid flow. Typically VFS<br>
are bulky in that it has a large footprint, thereby taking valuable space within an engine<br>
head or about an engine cover. Therefore, if small size is desirable, the VFS cannot meet<br>
the designated dimension restriction.<br>
A control law 18 of the closed-loop 10 is described in United Patent No. 5,184,578<br>
and is hereby incorporate herein by reference. A simplified depiction of the control law is<br>
shown in Fig. 1A. Measured phase 26 is subjected to the control law 18 initially at block<br>
30 wherein a Proportional-Integral (PI) process occurs. PI process is the sum of two sub-<br>
processes. The first sub-process includes amplification; and the second sub-process<br>
includes integration. Measured phase is further subjected to phase compensation at block<br>
32, where control signal is adjusted to increase the overall control system stability before it<br>
is sent out to drive the actuator, in the instant case, a variable force solenoid.<br>
In other words, while a VFS provides a good closed-loop control performance, it<br>
also bears several drawbacks such as higher cost, larger package size, and less reliability.<br>
This invention avoids the above drawbacks inherited from the VFS by replacing it with a<br><br>
two-position ON/OFF solenoid. A two-position ON/OFF solenoid is much less expensive,<br>
smaller size, and more reliable than a VFS.<br>
The present invention provides a small sized and fast responsive two-position<br>
ON/OFF solenoid for pushing a spool valve which controls the flow direction within a<br>
VCT phaser, as show in Fig. 2<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, feedback, loop 11 is shown. The control objective of feedback<br>
loop 11 is to have a spool valve in a null position. In other words, the objective is to have<br>
no fluid flowing between two fluid holding chambers of a phaser (not shown) such that the<br>
VCT mechanism at the phase angle given by a set point 12 with the spool 14 stationary in<br>
its null position. This way, the VCT mechanism is at the correct phase position and the<br>
phase rate of change is zero. A control computer program product which utilizes the<br>
dynamic state of the VCT mechanism is used to accomplish the above state.<br>
The VCT closed-loop control mechanism is achieved by measuring a camshaft<br>
phase shift θ0 16, and comparing the same to the desired set point 12. The VCT<br>
mechanism is in turn adjusted so that the phaser achieves a position which is determined<br>
by the set point 12, which is a computed value controller by a controller such as a VCT<br>
controller or built in the engine control unit (ECU). A control law 31 compares the set<br>
point 12 to the phase shift θ0 16 which is associated with at least one measured value such<br>
as a sensed crank pulse or cam pulse. The compared result is used as a reference to issue<br>
commands to an on/off solenoid 30 to position the spool 14. On/off solenoid 30 may be a<br>
two position solenoid. This positioning of spool 14 occurs when the phase error (the<br>
difference between set point 12 and phase shift 16) is non-zero.<br>
Note the functional relationship 17 of fluid flow status versus spool valve 14<br>
position, in that only two valve positions, i.e. first position 17a and second position 17b<br>
exit are used due to the on/off nature of the solenoid. In other words, ideally the control<br>
fluid either fully flows or is totally off.<br>
By way of an example, the spool 14 is moved toward a first direction (e.g. right) if<br>
the phase error is negative (retard) and to a second direction (e.g. left) if the phase error is<br>
positive (advance). It is noted that retarding with the current phase measurement scheme<br><br>
gives a larger value, and advancing yields a small value. When the phase error is zero, the<br>
VCT phase equals the set point 12 so the spool 14 is held in the null position such that no<br>
fluid flows within the spool valve.<br>
Camshaft and crankshaft measurement pulses in the VCT system are generated by<br>
camshaft and crankshaft pulse wheels 22 and 24, respectively. As the crankshaft (not<br>
shown) and camshaft (also not shown) rotate, wheels 22, 24 rotate along with them. The<br>
wheels 22, 24 possess teeth which can be sensed and measured by sensors according to<br>
measurement pulses generated by the sensors. The measurement pulses are detected by<br>
camshaft and crankshaft measurement pulse sensors 22a and 24a, respectively. The<br>
sensed pulses are used by a phase measurement device 26. A measurement phase<br>
difference is then determined. The phase between a camshaft and a crankshaft is defined<br>
as the time from successive crank-to-cam pulses, divided by the time for an entire<br>
revolution and multiplied by 360 degrees. The measured phase may be expressed as θ0 16.<br>
This phase is then supplied to the control law 31 for reaching the desired spool position.<br>
Solenoid 30 of the present invention is a small sized and fast responsive two-<br>
position ON/OFF solenoid for pushing spool valve 14 which controls the flow direction<br>
within a VCT phaser. A switching variable switch is calculated within control law 31.<br>
Based on the value or the sign of the numerical value of switch, the two-position ON/OFF<br>
valve is turned on or off. The following are a logical process suitable for computer the<br>
values of the switch variable.<br>
If sign(switch) &gt; 0<br>
Turn on the two-position ON/OFF solenoid, allow the hydraulic<br>
fluid within a VCT to flow in one direction.<br>
If sign(switch) 
Turn off the two-position ON/OFF solenoid, allow the<br>
hydraulic fluid within a VCT to flow in the opposite direction.<br>
If switch = 0<br><br>
Maintain the original solenoid status<br>
In the present invention, there are various ways of calculating the value of switch.<br>
One preferred way of calculating switch is switch <br>
Another preferred way of calculating switch is<br><br>
where, theta_ setP is VCT position set point;<br>
theta_M is measured VCT position;<br><br>
C1, and C2 are control parameters to be tuned<br>
It is noted that the rate of change may be such that a first order error correction of<br>
C2 * (theta _M Dot) may be insufficient. Thereby, higher order error corrections may<br>
be necessary. There is potentially a multiplicity of ways to calculate the switch<br>
variables. Some variables may perform better than others. The present invention<br>
teaches a control command which is calculated based on the sign or at least some<br>
threshold of the switch variable.<br>
As can be seen, compared to the prior art VFS which may increase control fluid<br>
flow (see 15 of Fig. 1), the on/off solenoid of the present invention maintains only two<br>
positions, i.e. either on or off (see numerals 17, 17a, and 17b of Fig. 2). The control fluid<br>
flow is caused by cam shaft torque pulses associated with either a CTA or a TA system. It<br>
should be noted that the present invention also contemplates its use in an OPA system.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, a flowchart 40 is shown. A switching variable switch is<br>
defined as 42, and a value assigned to the same 44. The switching variable Switch is<br>
calculated for example within control law 31 of Fig. 2. A first determination 46 is<br><br>
performed in that if the value of the switch is greater than a predetermined value Z, the<br>
on/off solenoid is turned on 48. A second determination 50 is in turn performed in that if<br>
the value of the switch is less than the predetermined value Z, the on/off solenoid is turned<br>
on 48. A third determination 54 is in turn performed in that if the value of the switch is<br>
equal to the predetermined value Z, the on/off solenoid maintains its original on/off<br>
solenoid status The predetermined value Z can be of any value including the value zero.<br>
As can be seen, the present invention includes the use of a two-position ON/OFF<br>
solenoid to actuate a spool valve which controls the flow direction with a VCT phaser. A<br>
switch variable is provided and based on the determined value of the switch variable, the<br>
on/off solenoid is either turn on, or switched off, or maintains its current state, which<br>
means either on or off. One way to define the switching variable is let it be a sign<br>
function.<br>
One embodiment of the invention is implemented as a program product for use<br>

In general, the routines executed to implement the embodiments of the invention,<br>
whether implemented as part of an operating system or a specific application, component,<br><br>
program, module, object, or sequence of instructions may be referred to herein as a<br>
"program". The computer program typically is comprised of a multitude of instructions<br>
that will be translated by the native computer into a machine-readable format and hence<br>
executable instructions. Also, programs are comprised of variables and data structures<br>
that either reside locally to the program or are found in memory or on storage devices. In<br>
addition, various programs described hereinafter may be identified based upon the<br>
application for which they are implemented in a specific embodiment of the invention.<br>

in any specific application identified and/or implied by such nomenclature.<br>
The following are terms and concepts relating to the present invention.<br>
It is noted the hydraulic fluid or fluid referred to supra are actuating fluids.<br>
Actuating fluid is the fluid which moves the vanes in a vane phaser. Typically the<br>
actuating fluid includes engine oil, but could be separate hydraulic fluid. The VCT system<br>
of the present invention may be a Cam Torque Actuated (CTA)VCT system in which a<br>
VCT system that uses torque reversals in camshaft caused by the forces of opening and<br>
closing engine valves to move the vane. The control valve in a CTA system allows fluid<br>
flow from advance chamber to retard chamber, allowing vane to move, or stops flow,<br>
locking vane in position. The CTA phaser may also have oil input to make up for losses<br>
due to leakage, but does not use engine oil pressure to move phaser. Vane is a radial<br>
element actuating fluid acts upon, housed in chamber. A vane phaser is a phaser which is<br>
actuated by vanes moving in chambers.<br>
There may be one or more camshaft per engine. The camshaft may be driven by a<br>
belt or chain or gears or another camshaft. Lobes may exist on camshaft to push on<br>
valves. In a multiple camshaft engine, most often has one shaft for exhaust valves, one<br>
shaft for intake valves. A "V" type engine usually has two camshafts (one for each bank)<br>
or four (intake and exhaust for each bank).<br>
Chamber is defined as a space within which vane rotates. Chamber may be<br>
divided into advance chamber (makes valves open sooner relative to crankshaft) and retard<br>
chamber (makes valves open later relative to crankshaft). Check valve is defined as a<br><br>
valve which permits fluid flow in only one direction. A closed loop is defined as a control<br>
system which changes one characteristic in response to another, then checks to see if the<br>
change was made correctly and adjusts the action to achieve the desired result (e.g. moves<br>
a valve to change phaser position in response to a command from the ECU, then checks<br>
the actual phaser position and moves valve again to correct position). Control valve is a<br>
valve which controls flow of fluid to phaser. The control valve may exist within the<br>
phaser in CTA system. Control valve may be actuated by oil pressure or solenoid.<br>
Crankshaft takes power from pistons and drives transmission and camshaft. Spool valve is<br>
defined as the control valve of spool type. Typically the spool rides in bore, connects one<br>
passage to another. Most often the spool is located on center axis of rotor of a phaser.<br>
Differential Pressure Control System (DPCS) is a system for moving a spool valve,<br>
which uses actuating fluid pressure on each end of the spool. One end of the spool is<br>
larger than the other, and fluid on that end is controlled (usually by a Pulse Width<br>
Modulated (PWM) valve on the oil pressure), full supply pressure is supplied to the other<br>
end of the spool (hence differential pressure). Valve Control Unit (VCU) is a control<br>
circuitry for controlling the VCT system. Typically the VCU acts in response to<br>
commands from ECU.<br>
Driven shaft is any shaft which receives power (in VCT, most often camshaft).<br>
Driving shaft is any shaft which supplies power (in VCT, most often crankshaft, but could<br>
drive one camshaft from another camshaft). ECU is Engine Control Unit that is the car's<br>
computer. Engine Oil is the oil used to lubricate engine, pressure can be tapped to actuate<br>
phaser through control valve.<br>
Housing is defined as the outer part of phaser with chambers. The outside of<br>
housing can be pulley (for timing belt), sprocket (for timing chain) or gear (for timing<br>
gear). Hydraulic fluid is any special kind of oil used in hydraulic cylinders, similar to<br>
brake fluid or power steering fluid. Hydraulic fluid is not necessarily the same as engine<br>
oil. Typically the present invention uses "actuating fluid". Lock pin is disposed to lock a<br>
phaser in position. Usually lock pin is used when oil pressure is too low to hold phaser, as<br>
during engine start or shutdown.<br><br>
Oil Pressure Actuated (OPA) VCT system uses a conventional phaser, where<br>
engine oil pressure is applied to one side of the vane or the other to move the vane.<br>
Open loop is used in a control system which changes one characteristic in response<br>
to another (say, moves a valve in response to a command from the ECU) without feedback<br>
to confirm the action.<br>
Phase is defined as the relative angular position of camshaft and crankshaft (or<br>
camshaft and another camshaft, if phaser is driven by another cam). A phaser is defined<br>
as the entire part which mounts to cam. The phaser is typically made up of rotor and<br>
housing and possibly spool valve and check valves. A piston phaser is a phaser actuated<br>
by pistons in cylinders of an internal combustion engine. Rotor is the inner part of the<br>
phaser, which is attached to a cam shaft.<br>
Pulse-width Modulation (PWM) provides a varying force or pressure by changing<br>
the timing of on/off pulses of current or fluid pressure. Solenoid is an electrical actuator<br>
which uses electrical current flowing in coil to move a mechanical arm. Variable force<br>
solenoid (VFS) is a solenoid whose actuating force can be varied, usually by PWM of<br>
supply current. VFS is opposed to an on/off (all or nothing) solenoid.<br>
Sprocket is a member used with chains such as engine timing chains. Timing is<br>
defined as the relationship between the time a piston reaches a defined position (usually<br>
top dead center (TDC)) and the time something else happens. For example, in VCT or<br>
VVT systems, timing usually relates to when a valve opens or closes. Ignition timing<br>
relates to when the spark plug fires.<br>
Torsion Assist (TA)or Torque Assisted phaser is a variation on the OPA phaser,<br>
which adds a check valve in the oil supply line (i.e. a single check valve embodiment) or a<br>
check valve in the supply line to each chamber (i.e. two check valve embodiment). The<br>
check valve blocks oil pressure pulses due to torque reversals from propagating back into<br>
the oil system, and stop the vane from moving backward due to torque reversals. In the<br>
TA system, motion of the vane due to forward torque effects is permitted; hence the<br>
expression "torsion assist" is used. Graph of vane movement is step function.<br><br>
VCT system includes a phaser, control valve(s), control valve actuator(s) and<br>
control circuitry. Variable Cam Timing (VCT) is a process, not a thing, that refers to<br>
controlling and/or varying the angular relationship (phase) between one or more<br>
camshafts, which drive the engine's intake and/or exhaust valves. The angular relationship<br>
also includes phase relationship between cam and the crankshafts, in which the crank shaft<br>
is connected to the pistons.<br>
Variable Valve Timing (VVT) is any process which changes the valve timing.<br>
VVT could be associated with VCT, or could be achieved by varying the shape of the cam<br>
or the relationship of cam lobes to cam or valve actuators to cam or valves, or by<br>
individually controlling the valves themselves using electrical or hydraulic actuators. In<br>
other words, all VCT is VVT, but not all VVT is VCT.<br>
Accordingly, it is to be understood that the embodiments of the invention herein<br>
described are merely illustrative of the application of the principles of the invention.<br>
