Door frame of a shaft door with a control arrangement for a lift shaft and method for access to a control unit<br>
The invention relates to a door frame of a shaft door with a control arrangement for a lift shaft according to the introductory part of claim 1 as well as to a method for access to a control unit according to the introductory part of claim 9.<br>
A control arrangement in the sense of the invention substantially comprises a control unit and means for mounting and protecting the control unit. The control unit in turn substantially comprises subassemblies required for control and/or regulation of the lift installation. Moreover, such a control unit can contain interfaces and input modules necessary for servicing the lift installation and for diagnosis. The control unit accordingly has to be accessible for the purpose of servicing or maintenance of the lift installation.<br>
Previously the control unit of a lift installation was usually accommodated, together with the drive of the lift installation, in a separate space or region, since such a control unit was, depending on the respective form of construction, relatively large.<br>
A separate space is superfluous with present-day lift systems, since the drive is frequently arranged in the lift shaft itself. In the case of lift installations of that kind the control unit is advantageously disposed in a region of a lift shaft closure. EP 0 680 921 discloses a corresponding arrangement of a control unit in the wall of a lift shaft. This arrangement demands a large space, since an own control box is attached to the shaft door frame. Since this control box is usually needed on only one storey, this necessitates special constructional and aesthetic solutions for this storey. This is made possible inter alia by the fact that present-day control users are smaller and power consumption as well as generated heat could be reduced and thus, for example, space-consuming ventilating installations are not required.<br>
The control unit is preferably accommodated in the door frame, in a chamber. Such a chamber is formed by, for example, a door frame element of the shaft door, usually by a vertical door post element. The door post element has walls which bound the chamber. One of these walls has an outside opening which opens outside the lift shaft and thus at the storey. The wall of the door frame element having this outside opening lies substantially parallel to the door leaves of the shaft door.  The same wall generally also<br><br>
has a passage in which a storey panel is arranged, by way of which the users of the lift system can call up the lift cage.<br>
It is disadvantageous that the door frame element with the incorporated control unit visually differs from the door frame elements of the remaining storeys not requiring control units and that different built-in storey panels result. A solution for placement of the control unit which would make it possible at the same time to use the same storey panel on all storeys would be desirable.<br>
WO 03/072478 shows a corresponding incorporation of energy supply units in a door frame. The energy supply units are accessible for maintenance, from the storey, via a pivotable lid. A disadvantage of this arrangement is that the openings, which are to be provided, in the door frame are executed to be large so that all work, such as, for example, replacement of apparatus, can be undertaken via these openings. This again obliges a cover of large size, which is costly and unattractive.<br>
The control unit itself is not visible when the lift installation is in normal operation. It is disposed in its operational position. Access to the control unit is required within the scope of service or maintenance operations. If within the scope of service operations at the lift installation there has to be access to the control of the lift installation, the control unit is brought into a service position. The control unit has to be visible in this state and the actions required for servicing of the lift installation, such as, for example initialisation of travel commands, interrogation of state data or actuation of switches, has to be able to be carried out. If more extensive maintenance operations, such as, for example, replacement of components of the control unit, are required an appropriate degree of access has to be ensured. The difference between service operations and maintenance operations resides in the fact that for the purpose of the service a limited access to the control unit is required and no greater space for that purpose is necessary. Thereagainst, within the scope of maintenance of the control unit in certain circumstances parts have to be replaced, for which purpose a correspondingly large access space is necessary.<br>
The outside opening of the chamber can be closed by a cover. The cover can, for example, be pivotable in the manner of a door leaf. In an operational position the cover closes the outside opening and in a service position the cover frees the outside opening and thus access to the chamber of the control unit for the purpose of service and<br><br>
maintenance. In a known solution the control unit is, for example, connected with the cover of the outside opening and is pivoted in common therewith.<br>
It is disadvantageous with this solution that such a cover is large and correspondingly visible, because the service and maintenance operations have to be carried out through the outside opening.<br>
The following point is to be regarded as a further disadvantage. The control unit of the lift installation is typically supplied with mains voltage or three-phase current. If the control unit is seated in a door frame with a pivotable cover or it is fastened at this cover the risk then exists of the mains cable being crushed and damaged. A danger is thereby created. In the most unfavourable case the door frame or the shaft door can lie at mains voltage.<br>
In addition, the use of special flexible cable and the associated connecting elements for the control unit increases costs.<br>
The objects of the invention are<br>
to propose a door frame with a control arrangement of the kind stated in the introduction,   with   a   control   unit,   which   by   comparison   with   conventional arrangements of the control units is simpler in maintenance and mounting, visually unobtrusive and economic in manufacture, and to indicate a method for access to such a control unit in the door frame.<br>
According to the invention these objects are met, for the door frame with control arrangement, by the features of independent claim 1 and, for the method, by the features of independent claim 9.<br>
Preferred developments of the door frame with control arrangement in accordance with the invention or of the method in accordance with the invention are defined by the respective dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention a control unit is arranged in the door frame or in a chamber of the door frame of shaft door of a lift installation. The chamber has an outside opening by means of which the chamber is accessible from a storey. This outside opening allows access to the chamber and to the control unit arranged therein for the purpose of<br><br>
servicing. The outside opening is provided with a cover which in the closed state prevents access to the control unit or in the open state - the service position of the cover - enables access to the control unit.<br>
Advantageously the outside opening is arranged at a wall, which is arranged transversely to a door leaf of the shaft door, of the door frame. It is advantageous in that case that optimum utilisation can be made of the size of the door frame and the associated cover can be mounted at a visually advantageous location.<br>
The chamber has an inside opening by means of which the control unit is accessible from the interior of the lift shaft. The inside opening is sufficiently large so that individual parts of the control unit or the entire control unit can be demounted and installed. The advantage of this embodiment is to be seen in that the outside opening and the associated cover can be kept small, whereby an advantageous visual form of the cover can be achieved. Moreover, no cable guides via moved parts are necessary, whereby the risk of jamming or cutting through feed lines is eliminated. Access for the purpose of service and maintenance is ensured in optimum manner.<br>
The door frame element in which the chamber for the control unit is disposed is preferably a vertical door element or a door post element. This is advantageous, since access to the door post element is possible in simple manner.<br>
It has also proved to be advantageous to so construct the cover of the chamber that in the mounted state or in its operational position it is integrated in the wall of the door post element at best so that it lies flush with this wall. The cover and the control unit are thus integrated in visually unobtrusive manner.<br>
With advantage, a storey panel is arranged at a wall of the door frame element which lies transversely to the wall in which the outside opening with cover is disposed. The storey panel is preferably disposed at the height region of the control unit.<br>
The invention is described in detail in the following on the basis of an example of embodiment and with reference to the drawing, in which:<br><br>
Fig. 1	shows a lift shaft closure with a control arrangement according to the<br>
invention, in a diagrammatic representation;<br>
Fig. 2	shows a control arrangement according to the invention in a horizontal<br>
section;<br>
Fig. 3	shows a control arrangement according to the invention in a horizontal<br>
section with covered inside opening; and<br>
Fig. 4	shows a front view of an opened shaft door with  lift shaft disposed<br>
therebehind, with a cover which in accordance with an advantageous embodiment of the invention can be used as a safety barrier.<br>
The aspect of a lift installation, as offered to a user thereof located on a storey 9, is illustrated in Fig. 1. A building, which is not further illustrated and in which the lift installation is located, comprises a building wall 10 which bounds a lift shaft 11 indicated in Fig. 1 by dashed lines.<br>
The lift shaft 11 is separated from the floor 9 visible in Fig. 1 by a lift shaft closure. The lift shaft closure comprises a shaft door which substantially consists of two door leaves 12.1, 12,2 and a doorframe 14. The door leaves 12.1.12.2 are horizontally displaceable and, in particular, in the direction of an axis X of an orthogonal three-dimensional co-ordinate system shown in Fig. 1 and with the further axes Y and Z. The doorframe 14 comprises three door frame elements, namely two lateral, vertical door frame elements 14.1, 14.2 which form door posts and are oriented parallel to the axis Z, and an upper, horizontal door frame element 14.3 oriented parallel to the axis X.<br>
An inner chamber 16 is formed by the vertical door frame element 14.1. The vertical door frame element 14.1 has several walls, particularly an outer front wall 16.1, an inner front wall 16.2 and an outer lateral wall 16.3. In the present example of embodiment the outer front wall 16.1 and the inner front wall 16.2 lie parallel to a plane formed by the axes X and Z and the outer lateral wall 16.3 lies parallel to a plane formed by the axes Y and Z. The outer front wall 16.1 and the outer lateral wall 16.3 face the storey 9 and the inner wall 16.2 faces the interior of the lift shaft 11.<br><br>
The outer lateral wall 16.3 has an outside opening enabling access to the chamber 16. This outside opening can have any desired suitable size, in particular it can extend over thegreatest partof the lateral wall 16.3 as indicated in Fig. 1.<br>
The outside opening is closable by a cover 17. If the lift installation is ready for operation or is in operation, then the cover 17 is mounted in its operational position in which it closes the outside opening. If the lift installation is being serviced, then the cover 17 is in its service position, wherein it is completely demounted, i.e. without contact with the door frame element 14.1. Alternatively, the cover can also be fastened by means of a hinge. Accessibility is thereby slightly impaired, but the cover is now fastened to be secure against loss and the risk of damage is thereby reduced.<br>
The cover 17 is preferably arranged to be coplanar or flush with the lateral outer surface 16.3, as shown in Fig. 2, whereby it is attached so as to be virtually vandal-proof and offers an aesthetically pleasing aspect.<br>
A control unit 18 of a control arrangement is arranged in stationary position in the chamber 16. The control unit 18 remains in. its position in the interior of the cage 16 even when the cover 17 is demounted. It is thereby possible to avoid the need to provide movable (cable) connections as would be necessary if the control unit were mounted at the cover 17. As control unit 16 there can be used a conventional control unit which is suitable from the viewpoints of installation size and thermal economy for installation in a door post 14.1.<br>
In an advantageous form of embodiment the control unit comprises one or more of the following elements:<br>
main current apparatus with connection to 400/230 V alternating voltage or another<br>
local voltage mains,<br>
hardware and software of the lift control (for example, the main computer with logic<br>
elements and interfaces),<br>
telephone alarm system and/or intercom (for example, to enable a service call or<br>
emergency call to be placed),<br>
apparatus used for emergency evacuation.<br>
The control arrangement comprises, in addition to the control unit, the following: fastening means for installation of the control unit in the chamber,<br><br>
cable for current supply and for creating the connections to the storey panel and for<br>
connecting with the drive of the lift,<br>
the cover 17,<br>
an optional electrical or electromagnetic monitoring of the cover 17 and<br>
an optional lighting of the chamber.<br>
The front outer wall 16.1 contains a passage in which a storey panel 20 is mounted, wherein preferably the same control panel can be used on all storeys of the lift installation.<br>
The inner front wall 16.2 has an inside opening 16.21 which is larger than the outside opening in the lateral wall 16.1, so that an optimum access to the control unit 18 is possible in order to undertake, for example, more extensive maintenance operations or, in a given case, exchange of the control unit 18. For that purpose the lift cage, which is not illustrated, can be moved to a suitable height between two storeys in such a manner that an operative standing or crouching on the roof of the lift cage or on a work surface of the lift cage can carry out the necessary operations.<br>
In a development, as shown in Fig. 3, the inside opening 16.21 of the inner front wall 16.2 is closable relative to the lift shaft 11 by a cover 19. The cover 19 covers the inside opening 16.21 at least partly and thus protects the control unit 18 against dirt and accidental contact. Advantageously it is constructed to be fire-retardant or fire-proof. If the lift installation is ready for operation or in operation then the cover 19 is in its operational position and closes the inside opening 16.21. If the lift installation is being serviced, then the cover 19 is in its maintenance position and access to the chamber 16 is free.<br>
For maintenance of the control unit a lift cage is moved between the storey 9 and the lower adjoining storey so that the roof of the lift cage or a work surface of the lift cage lies at a suitable working height. The energy feed to the lift installation is then interrupted or the lift installation is switched to a maintenance state and subsequently the door leaves 12.1, 12.2 are mechanically opened. An operative can now walk onto the roof or the work surface of the lift cage in order to remove the cover 19 and carry out the necessary maintenance operations.<br><br><br><br>
In the case of a further form of embodiment of the invention the control unit is divided into several parts which are respectively placed in the door frames of different storeys. The placement of the parts is, however, carried out analogously to the arrangement shown in Figures 1 to 3.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention the cover 17 is constructed as a safety barrier such that it mechanically secures the shaft door opening when the shaft door has to be opened for checking purposes. For this purpose the cover 17 can be so constructed that after opening and removal it can be positioned horizontally or diagonally transversely in front of the opened lift shaft 11, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4. It has the requisite strength for this purpose and is marked with the usual danger colours, wherein these markings are applied in such a manner that they are not visible in the operational position of the cover 17.<br>
In a further form of embodiment the cover 17 is electrically or electromagnetically monitored so that transposition to the service operation takes place automatically when the cover 17 is opened or removed. In addition, the control unit can be automatically lit in this case. The corresponding lighting unit is preferably seated in the door post in the chamber.<br>
In the case of a further form of embodiment of the invention the outside opening is disposed in the outer wall 16.1 of the door 14. This form of arrangement can be used, for example, in situations in which the storey panel is seated in the wall near the doorframe.<br>
Further variations are possible with knowledge of the present description. The lift expert recognises advantageous embodiments. Thus, he or she monitors, for example, the inside opening 16,21 or the cover 19 by means of, for example, switches or the work surface of the cage is formed by the cage itself, wherein access to the inside opening 16.21 takes place by means of a part, which can be pivoted away, of the cage wall.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
