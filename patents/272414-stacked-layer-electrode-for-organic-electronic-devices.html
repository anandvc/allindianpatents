CROSS-REFERENCE OF RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/621,705<br>
filed October 25,2004, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in<br>
limited circumstances  to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as<br>
provided for by the terms of Grant No. F49620-03-1-0101 and N00014-04-1-434,<br>
awarded by AFOSR and ONR, respectively.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to stacked electrodes for electro-optic devices,<br>
devices having such electrodes and methods of manufacture and use.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Further objectives and advantages will become apparent from a consideration<br>
of the description, drawings, and examples.<br>
An electrode for an electro-optic device has a wetting layer of electrically<br>
conductive material formed on a substrate. A second layer of electrically conductive<br>
material is formed on the wetting layer of electrically conductive material. The wetting<br>
layer has a first wetting ability with respect to a surface of the substrate and a second<br>
layer has a second wetting ability with respect to the surface of the substrate. The first<br>
wetting ability is different from the second wetting ability and the wetting layer acts to<br>
alter an optical property of the electrode due to its wetting ability on the surface of the<br>
substrate. Electro-optic devices according to this invention include, but are not limited<br>
to, polymeric light-emitting displays (PLEDs), solar cells, logic and memory devices that<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
have electrodes according to this invention. A method of forming a stacked electrode<br>
includes depositing a first layer of a first electrically conductive material onto a substrate<br>
at a first preselected deposition rate; and depositing a second layer of a second electrically<br>
conductive material onto the first layer at a second preselected deposition rate. The first<br>
and second deposition rates are selected to obtain an optical property of the stacked<br>
electrode in addition to maintaining an electrical conductivity of the stacked electrode.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In describing embodiments of the present invention illustrated in the drawings,<br>
specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is<br>
not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected. It is to be<br>
understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents which operate<br>
in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.<br>
Multilayered stacked electrodes according to embodiments of this invention<br>
have been fabricated for organic and polymeric electronic devices. This layered<br>
electrode structure can be composed of two or more layers of materials. The electrical<br>
conductivity and optical properties, e.g., optical transparency, reflectivity, and<br>
absorption, of the electrode can be precisely controlled by the materials used, the<br>
layering sequence, and/or the deposition rates.<br>
These electrodes can be utilized for applications including but not limited to<br>
polymer and organic light-emitting devices, solar cells, memory devices, transistors,<br>
electrochromic devices, liquid crystal displays, sensors, capacitors, inductors, resistors,<br>
actuators, piezoelectric devices, motors, heaters, coolers, mirrors, organic or inorganic<br>
emissive displays, and combinations of these devices. In addition, these electrodes can<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
also be useful for multi-stacking or tandem polymer and organic light-emitting devices,<br>
solar cells, memory devices, transistors, electrochromic devices, liquid crystal displays,<br>
sensors, capacitors, inductors, resistors, actuators, piezoelectric devices, motors, heaters,<br>
coolers, mirrors, organic or inorganic emissive displays, and combinations of these<br>
devices.<br>
Several deposition methods can be applied to fabricate the electrodes according to<br>
the current invention. These methods include, but are not limited to, thermal evaporation,<br>
e-beam evaporation, sputtering, MBE. CVD, plasma-enhanced deposition, spin-coating.,<br>
dip-coating, electro plating, electroless plating, organic vapor jet printing, and ink-jet<br>
printing.<br>
The materials used in the stacking structure may include metallic materials,<br>
conductive oxides, conductive organic materials, conductive polymers, and conductive<br>
ionic materials. The interfacial layer may include, M(acetylacetonate)x, salts, oxides,<br>
metallic materials, polymers, organic molecules, fibers, and/or ceramics.<br>
The thicknesses of each material layer can be optimized depending on the desired<br>
requirements for the electronic device. In general, if the material is not optically<br>
transparent, the thicknesses of each layer of the multilayer film are constructed to be less<br>
than their individual skin depths.<br>
The term "substrate," as used herein, may include any structure upon which a<br>
stacked electrode is formed. It may refer to a simple substrate such as glass or ITO/glass,<br>
or may refer to complex structures including electrically and/or optically active<br>
components in other cases.<br>
By choosing materials with different wetting abilities (surface energies) to the<br>
substrate and different wetting ability between each layer, the morphology of any given<br>
deposited layer (or layers) will be significantly affected by a previously deposited layer,<br>
or previously deposited layers. Due to the different wetting abilities, the change in<br>
morphology can cause the multilayer film to be a more continuous and smooth film or a<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
more discontinuous and rough film, depending upon the desired application of electrodes<br>
according to the current invention.<br>
Figures la-Id schematically illustrate an embodiment of an electrode according to<br>
the current invention. A two-layer electrode 100 is illustrated in Figure lc and a two-<br>
layer electrode 200 is illustrated in Figure Id. In forming the electrode 100, a first layer<br>
of electrically conductive material 102 (Material A) is formed on substrate 104 (Figure<br>
la). This layer 102 may also be referred to as a "wetting layer." A wetting layer<br>
according to This invention may be selected to be a material having wetting ability with<br>
respect to the particular substrate according to the desired application. For example, one<br>
may select a material that has relatively good wetting ability for some applications, or<br>
relatively poor wetting ability in other applications. This invention is not limited to a<br>
particular wetting ability of the wetting layer 102.<br>
A second layer of electrically conductive material 106 of a Material B, different<br>
from Material A, is formed on the wetting layer 102 (Figure lc). In order to explain some<br>
concepts of the current invention, an electrode 200 is formed of the same materials as<br>
electrode 100 on a substrate of the same or similar material, but in opposite order<br>
(Figures lb and Id). In this case, the wetting layer of Material B is formed on substrate<br>
104(Figure lb). Then a second layer of electrically conductive material 204 is formed on<br>
the wetting layer 202. Each of the layers of electrically conductive materials 102,106,<br>
202 and 204 maybe formed by a deposition method, for example, by one of the methods<br>
specified above. The examples of Figures lc and Id are for two-layer electrodes.<br>
However, the broader aspects of this invention are not limited by the specific number of<br>
layers of the electrode. Additional layers of Material A and/or B and/or other materials<br>
may be formed on top of the two layers illustrated in these examples.<br>
If Material A has better wetting ability than Material B on the substrate 104, given<br>
the same thickness, Material A will form a better film (Figure la) than Material B on the<br>
substrate alone (Figure lb). If the wetting ability of Material B on Material A is good,<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
then when the multilayer structure such as the one 100 shown in Figure lc is formed,<br>
Material B will form a more continuous and smooth film. The continuousness and<br>
smoothness of the film will enhance the optical transparency and the electrical<br>
conductivity of title film 100. If the film has voids and is too rough, these surface<br>
characteristics may result in optical absorption and light scattering which will reduce the<br>
optical transparency of the film. Conversely, an opaque film 200 may be achieved by<br>
depositing a layer 202 which has poor wetting ability on the substrate 104, as in Figure<br>
Id. Note that the thicknesses of these layers under discussion are on the scale of<br>
nanometers, which is well below the scale of visible wave lengths. Nano scale voids or<br>
particles formed during deposition of these films may cause scattering and absorption of<br>
visible light. For example, Copper (Cu) has better wetting ability on glass than Silver<br>
(Ag). A glass/silver (6nm) structure will have lower optical transparency than a<br>
glass/copper (0.5nm)/silver (6nm) structure.<br>
In some cases, a material with lesser wetting ability may also serve as a good<br>
wetting layer. Although a material may have poor wetting ability, if it is thick enough, it<br>
will eventually form a continuous firm. .For example, Aluminum (Al) has lower wetting<br>
ability than Copper (Cu) on a glass substrate. In the case of the glass/aluminum/copper<br>
electrode structure, the optimal thickness of Al is about 2-3nm for an 8nm thick layer of<br>
Cu. As long as the thickness is below its skin depth, it can serve as a good wetting layer<br>
since it is already a more continuous film.<br>
The layered structure of the electrode is not limited to only two layers. Structures<br>
of three or more layers of materials may also be constructed to control and optimize the<br>
electrical conductivity and optical transparency of the multilayer film. For example, a<br>
gold (0.2-0.3 nm)/aluminum (2-4 nm)/gold (9-11 nm) structure has various wetting layers<br>
to achieve optimal transparency.<br>
By controlling the deposition rate of the materials, the roughness of the electrode<br>
film may also be controlled. A smoother film can be achieved with a higher deposition<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
rate and a rougher film may be achieved with a lower deposition rate. This control may<br>
be used in conjunction with the wetting abilities of the materials to achieve the desired<br>
electrical conductivity and optical transparency of the electrode.<br>
With controlling the thickness of this stacked layer, it can also be utilized as<br>
the middle layer for any type of tandem cell structure electronic device. Another<br>
function for this stacked layer structure is to be used as a proper buffer layer for<br>
electronic devices. For example, this buffer layer is sandwiched between the active<br>
layer and a conductive or non conductive capping layer of a light emitting or photo-<br>
voltaic device. The deposition methods of this non-conductive or conductive layer<br>
can include, but are not limited to thermal evaporation, e-beam evaporation,<br>
sputtering, MBE, CVD, plasma-enhanced deposition, spin-coating, dip-coating,<br>
electro plating, electroless plating, organic vapor jet printing, and ink-jet printing.<br>
Example A:<br>
Semi-transparent multilayer stacked metal cathode for polymeric<br>
light-emitting diodes<br>
In an embodiment of this invention, a semi-transparent metallic film made of<br>
gold/aluminum/gold thin multilayers was used as the cathode in polymeric light-emitting<br>
devices. Physical properties of the cathodes were characterized by current-voltage<br>
measurement, ultraviolet-visible transmission spectroscopy, and atomic force<br>
microscopy. The optical transparency of the device reaches as high as about 70% in the<br>
visible region without a capping layer, and the electrical sheet resistance reduces to below<br>
10 ohms/square. For a polymer light-emitting device in an embodiment of this invention,<br>
approximately 47% of light emits through the top cathode surface, and 53% through the<br>
ITO side. Morphology modification at each interface of the cathode appears to play an<br>
important role in fixing the transparency and conductivity. This technique offers precise<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
control of the optical and electrical properties of the cathode without using a sophisticated<br>
evaporation process.<br>
Foremost among the advantages of polymeric light-emitting displays (PLEDs)<br>
over their liquid crystal display counterparts is their emission nature, which makes them<br>
pleasant to the eye and requires no backlight illumination. Traditional PLEDs consist of<br>
one or two thin (typically about 90 nm) polymer layers sandwiched between a conductive<br>
surface electrode and a transparent substrate. The surface electrode is the cathode which<br>
can be specially designed to facilitate the electron injection whilst the substrate is<br>
typically a standard indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated glass, through which the<br>
electrolurninance (EL) from the polymer layer is emitted. See, J. H. Burroughes, D. D. C.<br>
Bradley, A. R. Brown, R. N. Marks, K. Mackay, and R. H. Friend, Nature, 347, 539,<br>
(1990). Surface-emitting PLEDs are important for display and communication<br>
applications (C. N. King, Inorganic and Organic Electroluminescence, edited by R. H.<br>
Mauch and H.-E. Gumlich (Wissenchaft &amp; Technik Verlag, Berlin, 1996), p. 375). It is<br>
often desirable to monolithically integrate PLEDs on a silicon chip and under which the<br>
peripheral electronics, such as transistors, and pixel switching circuits can be placed. A<br>
transparent cathode may also be utilized in transparent displays where light can be<br>
received from both the anode and the cathode (A. Yamamori, S. Hayashi, T. Koyama, and<br>
Y. Taniguchi, Appl. Phys. Letts, 78,3343 (2001)). Despite such importance, there have<br>
been few studies on these surface-emitting devices and they have reported inadequate<br>
cathode transparency with acceptable device performance. (See, V. Bulovic, P. E.<br>
Burrows, S. R. Forrest, andM. E. Thompson, Appl. Phys. Letts, 68, 2606 (1996); L. S.<br>
Hung and C. W. Tang, Appl Phys. Letts, 74, 3209 (1999); G. Pathasarathy, P. E.<br>

Appl. Phys. Lett. 16,259, (2000).)<br>
ln general, there are two methods currently used to fabricate a transparent cathode.<br>
The first method is to sputter transparent conductive oxides such as ITO on the device<br>
with a buffer layer. As an example, the use of a thin bilayer of magnesium/silver<br>
(Mg/Ag) as the buffer layer to protect against sputtering damage and to help electron<br>
injection of the cathode has been reported. V. Bulovic, P. E. Burrows, S. R. Forrest, and<br>
M. E. Thompson, Appl. Phys. Letts, 68,2606 (1996) and M. E. Thompson, S. R. Forrest,<br>
P. Burrows, US Patent No. 5,986, 401. The insertion of a thin organic film as a buffer<br>
layer between an overlying ITO layer and the device has also been reported. L. S. Hung<br>
and C. W. Tang, Appl. Phys. Letts, 74,3209 (1999) and G. Pathasarathy, P. E. Burrows,<br>

However, both techniques require the sputtering of ITO, in which the damage of the light- ■<br>
emitting layer is unavoidable. One of the intrinsic properties of the low-work function<br>
metals is their high susceptibility to atmospheric oxidation. For instance, Mg/Ag always<br>
demonstrates inadequate corrosion resistance in ambient environments. C. W. Tang and<br>
S. A. Vanslyke, Appl. Phys. Lett. 51, 913, (1987). The notion to insert some organic<br>
layers as part of the cathode structure will eventually alter the electronic parameters of the<br>
device due to the presence of new interfacial states and formation of charge-injection<br>
barriers. The second method is to use stacked metal layers with or without a capping<br>
layer. A multilayer stacked cathode structure has been employed consisting of an ultra<br>
thin lithium fluoride/aluminum/silver layer with a capping layer for refractive index<br>
matching to enhance the optical transparency of the overall device. L. S. Hung, C. W.<br>
Tang, M. G. Mason, P. Raychaudhuri, and J. Madathil, Appl. Phys. Letts, 78,544 (2000).<br>
Their results indicate that 30% of the light is able to exit through the top cathode and<br>
70% through the bottom ITO surface. The preferable capping layer also requires a<br>
sputtering process. A double-layer calcium/silver stacked metal cathode has been<br>
constructed on organic light-emitting diodes. R. B. Pode, C. J. Lee, D. G. Moon, and J. I.<br>

Han, Appl. Phys. Lett. 84, 4614, (2004). The authors demonstrated that the optical<br>
transmittance of the cathode reached as high as ~ 70% when it was evaporated on a glass<br>
substrate, but not on the device. Again, the use of reactive metals and an insufficient<br>
capping layer may decrease the device lifetime.<br>
Because the structure, composition, and deposition technique of the cathode<br>
dictates its final physical properties and the device performance, the design and<br>
fabrication of transparent cathodes are important for high-definition organic displays.<br>
However, good electrical conductivity and optical transparency in the visible range are<br>
two conflicting parameters of a particular material. It is well known that bulk metals and<br>
thick metal films are good electrical conductors, but their transmittance decreases as the<br>
thickness increases. P. W. Gilberd, J. Phys. F: Met. Phys., 12, 1845, (1982). In this<br>
example, we demonstrate a unique multilayer cathode structure for PLEDs, with primary<br>
focus being on achieving high optical transparency and electrical conductivity through<br>
control of the evaporation rate (and related morphology) and individual layer thickness.<br>
In this example, the cathode is composed of three metal layers; an ultra thin 0.2-0.5 ran<br>
buffer layer of Au is first evaporated onto the PLEDs which allows the second overlaid 2-<br>
4 nm-thick Al layer to interact with the PLED for efficient electron injection. The third<br>
9-11 nm-thick Au provides the necessary transparency and protects the cathode. The<br>
cathode transparency is mainly determined by the thin Au buffer layer as a result of the<br>
morphology modification at each interface of the successive layers. The PLEDs<br>
integrated with the stacked transparent cathode, even without a capping layer, provides<br>
47% of light through the cathode surface and 53% through the ITO surface. In fact, only<br>
one more type of non-reactive metal is introduced. This technology requires no<br>
modification of the existing evaporation system.<br>
The semi-transparent cathodes were evaporated on polymeric h'ght-emitting<br>
diodes (PLEDs) with structure of glass/ ITO/ poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT))<br>

[Ba(acac)2]/ cathode. The fabrication details of the organic layers were reported<br>
elsewhere in Q. Xu, J. Ouyang, Y. Yang, Appl. Phys. Lett. 83, 4695, (2003); the entire<br>
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Three different types of cathode<br>
structure were fabricated and integrated with PLEDs for comparison. The first one is<br>
only Au, the other is Al/Au, and the remaining is Au/Al/Au. Other metal such as Cu<br>
instead of Au was used for further comparison. The evaporation rates of Au and Al were<br>
0.01-0.06 and 0.05-0.1 nm/s respectively. The devices were evaporated in a chamber<br>
		with base pressure maintained at~1x106Torr,and the chamber was located within a<br>
MBraun nitrogen filled box with oxygen and moisture level maintained at 1 PPM. This<br>
was to insure that the oxygen level during evaporation was romimized. The current-<br>
voltage (I-V) characteristics and electroluminescence (EL) were measured by a Keithley<br>
2400 source measure unit with calibrated silicon photodiode and a Photo Research PR<br>
650 spectrophotometer.   The transparency measurements were measured within the<br>
visible range fiom 350 to 800 nm with a Varian Cary 50 Cone ultraviolet-visible<br>
spectrometer.    Atomic force microscopy was performed by Digital Instruments<br>
Multimode Scanning Probe Microscope. The scan size was 2 μm. and the scan rate was 2<br>
Hz. A four-probe method for resistivity measurements was employed to estimate the<br>
electrical properties.<br>
An important aspect of the semi-transparent cathode of this example is its ability<br>
to conduct electricity. In general, when radiation is shone onto a metal surface, a<br>
significant part of the light will travel a short distance, 8, into the metal surface before it<br>
is reflected. This distance, known as the skin depth, is the distance where the transmitted<br>
light amplitude is reduced to about 36.8% of the incident light amplitude. The metals we<br>
used in this example are mainly composed of Au and Al. The 5 for Au and Al at<br>
wavelength X = 500 nm are 22 and 6 nm, respectively. Therefore, when the Au and Al<br>
layers are thinner than 8 for the corresponding material, sufficient light can penetrate<br>
them. R. A. Chipman, Tlieory and Problems of Transmission Lines (Schaum Outline<br>

Series 1968) p. 78 &amp; 85. In our cathode structure, both Au and Al thicknesses are well<br>
within their δ s.<br>
The transparent cathode PLEDs displayed high transparency when the devices<br>
were turned off. Figure 2a shows the transmission spectra of the green PF device with<br>
and without the cathodes. All the transmission spectra were normalized with respect to<br>
that of HO. The green PF device without the cathode showed nearly 90% transmittance<br>
in the visible range. To illustrate the strong dependence of the transmittance on the<br>
constituency and thickness of  each individual layer of the 	cathode, we evaporated three<br>
devices with different cathode structure; the first one with only Au film, then second with<br>
Al and Au layers, and the third with the whole cathode structure, Au/Al/Au. The device<br>
with only Au as a cathode (labeled as Au) showed a significant reduction of transmittance<br>
~ 20% in the visible spectrum. Both the bilayer and trilayer cathode devices, labeled as<br>
Al/Au and Au/Al/Au, demonstrated an enhancement of transmittance compared with the<br>
Au only device even though the overall thickness of the stacked cathodes are thicker.<br>
The enhancement is more pronounced in the spectrum ranging from 600 to 800 nm. The<br>
underlying physics of using a trilayered structure for a cathode is not be restricted to the<br>
use of Al and Au. Some degree of universality for other electrode materials has also been<br>
exhibited. We have tried other metal combinations, and the effect was similar. For<br>
example, Al, Au; Au, Al, Au; Al, Cu; Cu, Al, Cu; Cu, Ag; Ag, Cu; Au, Ag; Ag, Au; Ca,<br>
Ag; Ag, Ca; and Cr, Au metal combinations were tried. However, this invention is not<br>
limited to only these examples of possible metal combinations. Other combinations may<br>
be used without departing from the teachings of this invention. The combination of<br>
Au/Al/Au metal showed the highest transparency, however, the concepts of the invention<br>
are not limited to only this combination and not limited to only these materials. Figure 2b<br>
shows the device transmittance when using Cu/Al/Cu compared to an 8 nm Cu as<br>
cathode.   Again, the PLEDs showed enhanced transmittance when using a trilayer<br>
cathode according to the current invention. Our data revealed the fact that the skin depth<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
and morphology at different layers significantly influenced the transmittance behavior of<br>
the transparent cathode. From the results presented here, the optimum thicknesses of<br>
individual layers in the cathode stack in this example for the highest transmittance were<br>
found to be from 0.2-0.5,2.0-4.0, and 9.0-11.0 nm for bottom layer Au, second layer Al,<br>
and top Au protective layer. For the case of Cu/Al/Cu structure, the thickness ratio is 0.2-<br>
0.5/2.0-4.0/8.0-11.0 nm, respectively. The overall transmittance of the cathode is<br>
determined by optical interference effects, absorption losses and electrical properties and<br>
can be, in principle, controlled by tailoring each metal thikness in the, cathode., In. these<br>
examples, the bottom layers of Au and Cu are the "wetting layers."<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show the I-V characteristics and EL of the PLED with the triple<br>
Au/Al/Au structured cathode. There was about 10% difference in brightness between the<br>
top and bottom emission when the device was turned on. For example, a luminance of<br>
832 and 789 cd/m2 were achieved, respectively, from the ITO and cathode surfaces at a<br>
current density of 25 mA/cm2. The small reduction in EL through the cathode surface<br>
was an indication of weak optical absorbance of the transparent cathode. The semi-<br>
transparent PLED provided 47% of EL through the surface cathode and 53% through the<br>
bottom ITO. The electrical sheet resistance of the multilayer cathode was below 10<br>
ohms/square. The total efficiency of the device displays in the inset of Figure 4 is about<br>
6.7 cd/A, which is lower than that (~ 8 cd/A) from a control device with Al as the<br>
cathode. This is ascribed to the finite sheet resistance of the Au/Al/Au cathode.<br>
Each interface of the cathode is suggested to be formed as a result of the<br>
subsequent morphology modification involving [Ba(acac)2], Au, and Al which dictates<br>
the optical and electrical property of the cathode. Each modified layer is observed to be<br>
on the order of a nanometer. Figure 5 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images<br>
of (a) the surface of the Au film (9 nm) evaporated on [Ba(acac)2] surface, (b) same as (a)<br>
but with a thin layer of Al (2 nm) sandwiched between the Au and [Ba(acac)2J layer, and<br>
(c) the Au surface of the transparent cathode with structure Au (0.25 nm)/Al (2 mn)/Au (9<br>
-15-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
mn) in the first, second and third rows, respectively. The results of AFM showed that the<br>
surface of Au evaporated on [Ba(acac)2] surface was very rough (surface roughness ~<br>
2.500 nm) compared with the same Au surface (surface roughness -1.159 nm) but with<br>
Al underneath. It is worth noting that the transp arency was higher (data not shown here)<br>
even though the total thickness of the cathode was increased by 2 nm. The role of this Al<br>
layer was (i) to interact with the [Ba(acac)2] layer so as to lower the work function of the<br>
cathode to increase the electron injection property of the cathode, and (ii) to smoothen<br>
the [Ba(acac)2] surface undemeath   By smoothening out the bottom surface, the<br>
overlying Au surface roughness is farther reduced. As shown in Figure 5 (second row),<br>
the reduction in surface roughness is the main cause of the enhancement of the optical<br>
transparency of the cathode. The device stability is relatively low using either Au alone<br>
or a two stacked metal structure as the cathode. In fact, both Au and Al/Au stacked metal<br>
cathodes decay readily as the device is lit up in the glove box. However, a tremendous<br>
improvement in the performance and stability can be achieved by evaporating an ultra-<br>
thin layer of Au before the deposition of Al and the successive Au layer. By virtue of the<br>
higher wetting ability of Au compared to Al, this ultra-thin Au layer acts as a wetting<br>
layer and further smoothens the entire cathode. The thickness of the Au buffer layer is an<br>
important factor according this embodiment of the invention. If the layer is too thick, it<br>
may set back the interaction between Al and [Ba(acac)2], if it is too thin it may not serve<br>
as an efficient wetting layer. It is observed that within a certain range of Au thicknesses,<br>
the overlaid cathode surface roughness (~ 0.941 nm) is reduced as shown in Figure 5<br>
(bottom row) and it is expected that the device performance is improved accordingly with<br>
better interaction between Al and [Ba(acac)2]. However, the overall transparency of the<br>
cathode is reduced when one increases the buffer layer thickness. Good results using a<br>
Au layer of about 0.25 nm was obtained. The overall cathode thickness with structure<br>
Au/Al/Au in this example is 11.25 nm. It has a significant transparency in the visible<br>
region, having in addition a low sheet resistance of about 10 ohms/square. Thus, the<br>
-16-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
results indicate that the skin depth and morphology evolution are two important factors<br>
responsible for the high transmittance in the triple-metal layer structure in this case. The<br>
thickness of each individual layer in the tri-layer structure is dependent on the different<br>
electron injection buffer layers deposited underneath. In our case, Ba(acac)2 may have<br>
different surface roughness due to the preparation method. Details can be seen from Q.<br>
Xu, J. Ouyang, Y. Yang, AppL Phys. Lett. 83,4695, (2003) which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference. Since the thickness of the entire cathode is so thin, the morphology of the<br>
layer underneath the cathode is very important for the performance of the cathode.<br>
Figure 5a schematically illustrates a polymeric light-emitting diode (PLED) 300<br>
according to an embodiment of this invention. The PLED 300 comprises a stacked<br>
electrode 302 and a substrate 304. The term substrate is used very generally herein to<br>
refer to any structure upon which an electrode according to this invention can be formed.<br>
A substrate, as used herein, may be a uniform material or it may itself be a complex<br>
structure of many materials, such as in this example. The substrate 304 comprises an<br>
organic layer structure 306 between an M(acac)2 layer 308 and a glass/ITO layer structure<br>
310. The organic layer 308 is 50 nm of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and 80 nm of<br>
green fluorine-containing co-polymer (5BTF8). The layer 308 is barium acetylacetonate<br>
[Ba (caca)2]. The stacked electrode 302 is the cathode in the PLED 300. The stacked<br>
electrode 302 includes a wetting layer 312, a second layer of electrically conductive<br>
material 314, and a third layer of electrically conductive material 316. In this example,<br>
the wetting layer 312 is a layer of Au. The second layer of electrically conductive<br>
material 314 is an Al layer and the third layer of electrically conductive material is<br>
another layer of Au. These materials were found to work well in this example, but the<br>
invention is not limited to only these materials. Furthermore, the invention is not limited<br>
to a stacked electrode 302 of three layers. Other examples may have stacked electrodes<br>
with only two layers or with more than three layers. In this example, a wetting layer 312<br>
of Au having a thickness in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 nm; a second layer 314 of Al with a<br>
-17-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
thickness in the range of 2.0 to 4.0 nm and a third layer 316 of Au with a thickness in the<br>
range of 9.0 to 11.0 nm were found to work well.<br>
In conclusion, forthis example, nearly transparent cathodes have been integrated<br>
in PLEDs by three successive thermal evaporations of common metals. The semi-<br>
transparent cathode PLEDs demonstrate extremely low optical absorbance and minimum<br>
potential drop across the cathode layers. The best tradeoff obtained between<br>
transmittance and sheet resistance characteristics in this example was achieved using a<br>
Au(0.2-0.5mn) /AI(204mn)/Au(9-11mn) cathode structure; however, the broad concepts<br>
of the invention are not limited to only the optimized values for this example. Through<br>
the demonstration of the semi-transparent cathode PLEDs with superior device<br>
performance, this fabrication technology provides a means to stabilize and standardize the<br>
optical and electrical properties of the electrodes used in organic devices.<br>
Example B:<br>
Stacked metal cathode for high contrast ratio polymeric light-emitting devices<br>
In this example, extremely high optical absorbing films made of alternating<br>
aluminum-silver layers are used as cathodes in polymeric light-emitting devices<br>
(PLEDs). Physical properties of the cathodes may be characterized by current-voltage<br>
(IV) measurement, atomic force microscopy, and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy.<br>
A slow evaporation rate was used. Each pair of aluminum-silver layer was shown to<br>
be in the form of aluminum-aluminum oxide nanoclusters embedded in an amorphous<br>
charge conducting network of silver. The nanoclusters helped to absorb and scatter<br>
the ambient light effectively. The use of a four-altemating-layer structure in PLEDs<br>
demonstrated 126% enhancement of contrast under 1,000 lux ambient illumination.<br>
The I-V characteristics of the black cathode PLEDs remained intact when compared<br>
-18-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
with reference PLEDs. This technology offers precise control of the cathode quality<br>
in terms of its reflectivity and conductivity.<br>
The fabrication of polymeric light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) with high<br>
brightness and efficiency has been shown to be feasible during the last decade and<br>
some device prototypes are being considered for market entry. The immediate<br>
advantages of using PLEDs are the low cost of materials and ease of manufacture<br>
compared to liquid crystal displays (LCDs). An additional and possibly more<br>
important advantage is the availabity of a broad range of substrates and device<br>
structures which can be used to further enhance the device performance. Traditional<br>
PLEDs used an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated substrate onto which ap-type polymer<br>
layer was spin coated. The cathode evaporated onto the device is usually a low work<br>
function metal or metal alloy, such as aluminum (Al), magnesium-silver (Mg-Ag),<br>
lithium-aluminum (Li-AI) and lithium fluoride-aluminum (LiF-Al). The latter three<br>
metal alloys are used to reduce operating voltage and enhance device performance. C.<br>

Lett. 70,152, (1997). The polymer layer is usually very thin (approximately 90 nm)<br>
and experiences little absorption upon illumination by ambient light. The ambient<br>
light, however, after transmitting through the polymer layer, will be reflected by the<br>
metal cathode and coupled out of the device through the ITO coated substrate. As a<br>
result, the contrast ratio of PLEDs will be significantly reduced by reflected ambient<br>
light, thus prohibiting the use of PLEDs for outdoor applications. There have been<br>
many attempts to enhance the contrast ratio by inserting an absorption and conductive<br>
inorganic layer between the polymer layer and the cathode. J. A. Dobrowolski, B. T.<br>

-19-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
about damage on the polymer layer. Recently, a black cathode consisting of a silicon<br>
monoxide doped Al film and an overlaid Al layer has been developed for organic<br>
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) that exhibited superior device performance. F. L.<br>
Wong, M. K. Fung, X. Jiang, C. S. Lee, Thin Solid Films 446,14, (2004). However,<br>
in practice, the proposed technique causes the black conductive films to be porous<br>
even with precise control of the Al-silicon monoxide ratio during co-evaporation. To<br>
reduce the number of pinholes and improve the film uniformity, the thickness of the<br>
cathode must be increased; this in turn increases the resistance	of the layer.<br>
In this example, we demonstrate a novel evaporation technique and cathode<br>
structure, with primary focus being on the physical properties of Al-Al oxide nano-<br>
clusters. Such Al-Al oxide nanoclusters are believed to be an important factor leading<br>
to the unique light absorbing ability of the electrode according to this aspect of the<br>
invention. Since only one more type of metal is introduced in the material system,<br>
this technology does not require modification of the existing evaporation system.<br>
The inset of Figure 8a illustrates the black cathode device with a structure of<br>
glass/ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, (PEDOT))(500 A)/green fluorine-<br>

incorporated herein by reference. It will be shown later that each pair of the Al-Ag<br>
layer is used to provide sufficient absorption of the ambient illumination, whilst<br>
maintaining good electron injection to the polymeric layer. The merit of using black<br>
cathodes for PLEDs was compared with a reference device using Al (60 A ) as a<br>
cathode. The thickness of both the Al and Ag were 40 A. The evaporation rates of<br>
Al and Ag were 0.2 and 0.5 A/s, respectively. Good results were obtained with Al<br>
deposition rates slower than or equal to about 0.5 A /sec. For example, good results<br>
were obtained with Al deposition rates of about 0.2 to 0.5 A /sec. Good results were<br>
-20-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
obtained with Ag deposition rates faster than or equal to about 1.0 A /sec. For<br>
example, good results were obtained with Ag deposition rates of at least 0.5 A/s or<br>
about 1.0 to 2.0 A /sec. The base pressure of the chamber was maintained at 1 x 10"6<br>
Torr. All the PLEDs were encapsulated by a thin glass with sealant in a glove box<br>
purged with nitrogen. The current-voltage characteristics and electroluminescence<br>
were measured by a Keithley 2400 source measure unit with calibrated silicon"<br>
photodiode and a Photo Research PR650 spectrophotometer. The contrast ratio<br>
measurement wasachieved by putting the PLED inside a New Port 6 inch integrating <br>
sphere with a Thermo Oriel 150 W solar simulator as a standard light source. The<br>
contrast ratio C was then calculated as<br>
C = (Ir+Ion)/(Ir + Ioff),	(1)<br>
where Ir is the reflected ambient light from the device, Ion and Ioff are the device<br>
luminance when it is switched on and off, respectively. The background was<br>
calibrated by measuring the luminance from a rough piece of white paper placed in the<br>
integrating sphere. Atomic force microscopy was performed by Digital Instruments<br>
Multimode Scanning Probe Microscope. The scan size was 1 μm and scan rate was 2<br>
Hz. For X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement, the sample was prepared by<br>
evaporating Al at 0.2 A /s on a silicon substrate and subsequently covered by fast<br>
evaporation of Al at 1.0 A /s. 5 keV Ar+ion sputtering was first utilized to remove the<br>
covered Al and then the evolution of the spectrum was recorded. The fresh surface<br>
was analyzed using Omicron Nanotechnology Multiprobe Surface Science System,<br>
with monochromatic Al K radiation.<br>
The black cathode PLEDs displayed black color in the background when the<br>
devices were turned off as compared with the control device. Figure 8a shows the<br>
electroluminescence (EL) of the black cathode PLEDs with four alternating layers of<br>
Al-Ag and Al-copper (Cu) (labeled as 4(A1-Ag) and 4(A1-Cu)) with respected to the<br>
control device. A luminance of 1300 cd/m2 was achieved by the control device at a<br>
-21-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
current density of 15 mA/cm2, while the black cathode PLEDs with the stacked Al-Ag<br>
and Al-Cu had luminance of 640 and 450 cd/m2, respectively. The EL of the Al-Ag<br>
stacked black cathode PLED is about 50% lower than the control device. This one-<br>
half reduction of the EL is an indication of the strong optical absorbance of the black<br>
cathode. The EL from the black cathode PLED could not be reflected by the cathode<br>
layer as in the case of the control device. The Al-Cu cathode data justified the<br>
possibility of using other metals instead of Ag. In our case, the Al-Cu material system<br>
		brings less attention due to the relatively weak optical absorption. In fact, four<br>
alternating Al-Cu stacked cathode PLEDs showed the same luminescence as from the<br>
two alternating Al-Ag stacked cathode PLEDs (data not shown here). We have tried<br>
to use other metal combinations, such as Al-Au, Au-Al, Al-Mg, Mg-Al, Al-Ca, and<br>
Ca-Al. None of them showed optical absorption and electrical conduction as good as<br>
Al-Ag; however, the broader concepts of the invention are not limited to only this<br>
example.<br>
Figure 8b presents the contrast ratios of the black cathode PLEDs and the<br>
control device under different ambient illumination. During the measurements, both<br>
the stacked black cathode PLEDs and the control device were maintained at a<br>
luminance of 300 cd/m22. Again, the contrast ratio of the Al-Cu stacked black cathode<br>
PLED is shown for comparison. The contrast ratio of the Al-Ag stacked PLED is<br>
approx. 5.2 under 1,000 lx ambient illumination, which corresponds to a 126%<br>
increase in contrast higher than the control device. It is worth noting that the<br>
improvement of the contrast is about 25% under 10,000 lx ambient lighting. The<br>
black cathode PLEDs show sufficient brightness levels which are suitable for outdoor<br>
applications. The inset of Figure 8b shows the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of<br>
the PLEDs with different metal combinations. The turn-on voltages (approx. 2 V) and<br>
the I-V characteristics of the black cathode PLEDs are the same as that of the control<br>
device. It is strongly indicative that the integration of the black cathodes with PLEDs<br>
-22-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
only changes their optical absorbance. The technique was proven to be able to form<br>
electrical conducting paths for the electrons migrating to the polymeric layer which<br>
was in principle, a different approach to the black cathode structure proposed by F. L.<br>
Wong, M. K. Fung, X. Jiang, C. S. Lee, Thin Solid Films 446,14, (2004), which<br>
incorporated the doping of silicon monoxide into Al that resulted in a significant<br>
voltage drop across the black cathode.<br>
Figures 9a-9c show the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the<br>
[Ca(acac)2]surface, the Arsurface after the film (40 Ả) was evaporated on the<br>
[Ca(acac)2] layer and the Ag surface after the film (40 A ) was successively<br>
evaporated on the Al surface, respectively. The results of AFM showed that the<br>
evaporated Al formed nanometer-size clusters onto the rough [Ca(acac)2] surface.<br>
The surface roughness of the [Ca(acac)2] and the Al surface were approximately 16.5<br>
and approximately 6.7 A, respectively, indicating that Al.was able to smooth the<br>
[Ca(acac)2] surface underneath. There are two scenarios that appear to explain this,<br>
which are: either the residual oxygen in the chamber acted like surfactant that allowed<br>
the high surface free-energy Al to wet the low surface free-energy organic film J.<br>
Ivanco, B. Winter, F. P. Netzer, and M. G. Ramsey, Appl. Phys. Letts. 85,585,<br>
(2004), or the Al reacted with oxygen and formed other compounds that could wet the<br>
[Ca(acac)2] surface. It will be shown later that the Al is in fact composed of Al and<br>
Al oxides. The density of the Al islands was found to decrease with increasing<br>
evaporation rate. With the evaporation rate higher than 0.2 A/s, we observed that the<br>
color from the film changed from black to shinny when the film thickness increased<br>
above 4 A. The subsequent Ag film, however, provided a relatively smooth surface<br>
as shown in Figure 9c (roughness approximately 5.2 A), due to the fact that the<br>
wetting ability of Ag was lower than that of the material underneath it. We observed<br>
that the evaporation rate of Ag had to be at least about 0.5 A/s or the cathodes were<br>
not conducting.<br>

Lastly, it remains an issue of why the Al-clusters are black in color. In order to<br>
probe the physical properties of the unaltered Al-clusters, the sample was covered by a<br>
thick Al layer before transporting it into the XPS chamber. Figure 10 shows the XPS<br>
data from the Al-clusters covered with Al (labeled as Original). The features at<br>
approximately 73.1 and approximately 75.5 eV Al 2p binding energies belongs<br>
specifically to the metallic Al and the most common Al native oxides J. van den<br>
Brand, P. C. Snijders, W. G. Sloof, H. Terryn, and J. H. E. de Wit, J. Phys. Chem. B,<br>
108, 6017, (2004). It is well known that AI reacts with oxygen and water to form<br>
protective surface oxides under ambient environmental conditions. The Al 2p core<br>
level spectrum confirms that the outermost Al surface is covered by Al native oxides.<br>
Following the Ar+ion sputtering to remove the native oxides, the spectrum showed<br>
only the characteristic peak of metallic Al after 10 mins, indicating that the native<br>
oxides had been removed. With increasing sputtering time, another feature at<br>
approximately 76.0 eV Al 2p binding energy appeared with intensity higher than that<br>
from the metallic Al. The spectrum suggested that a primary element of the Al-<br>
clusters was a mixture of Al and Al oxides which differed from the common native<br>
oxides. It was reported that Al oxides formed from Al under oxygen deficient<br>
ambient condition were: (i) not pure alumina but with chemical formula, Al2Ox
(ii) light-absorption was strongly dependent on the degree of oxygen deficiency. F. L.<br>
Wong, M. K. Fung, X. Jiang, C. S. Lee, Thin Solid Films 446,14, (2004). We<br>
conclude that: (i) the exact chemical constituent of the Al oxides may still be unclear,<br>
but presumably mainly composed of Al2Ox
in Figure 9b can be considered as Al embedded in Al oxides because the Al left the<br>
crucible and likely interacted strongly with the oxygen residue before reaching the<br>
target. As mentioned before, the Al and Ag evaporation rates are important for the<br>
nano-clusters formation, according to this aspect of the invention, which dictate the<br>
cathode color and the overall conductivity. A similar phenomenon was observed by<br>
-24-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
S. Han, D. Grozea, C. Huang, and Z. H. Lu, J. Appl. Phys. 96, 709, (2004). They<br>
report that the size of Al islands increases with increasing Al concentration, which<br>
leads to a dramatic reduction in resistivity and optical transmittance. The material<br>
system used in Han et al is different from that of the current invention. Our results<br>
indicated that the Al-oxides were responsible for the light absorption and further<br>
enhance the scattering of ambient light when they are in the form of nano-clusters.<br>
The evaporation of Ag on the Al-clusters not only made their surface smoother<br>
as shown in figure 9c, but also took the role of charge transporting medium which<br>
enhanced the overall conductivity of the paired Al-Ag layers. It is possible to view<br>
the metallic Al clusters as being separated by nonconducting AhOxo and conducting<br>
Ag. Tunneling conduction between the metallic Al clusters reported by B. Abeles, P.<br>
Sheng, M. D. Courts, and Y. Arie, Adv. Phys. 24, 407, (1975); B. Abeles, RCA Rev.<br>
36,594, (1975) is .assumed to occur. It is considered that with such high conductivity<br>
in Ag, the anomalous skin effect could be present This is the case when the electron<br>
mean free path becomes comparable with the skin depth. The collisions of the<br>
electrons within the Ag surface are the dominating factor that accounts for the optical<br>
properties of the metal. T. Holstein, Phys. Rev. 88,1427, (1952). The electrons are<br>
accelerated and decelerated many times within the skin layer. On average, they absorb<br>
no energy from the field unless they undergo a collision. Since collisions with the<br>
lattice are unlikely in the anomalous regime, surface scattering is significant. This in<br>
turn, contributes to the overall black color of the cathode.<br>
In conclusion with respect to this embodiment of the invention, high optical<br>
contrast black cathodes have been integrated into PLEDs by successive thermal<br>
evaporation of alternating common metals. The primary chemical constituent and<br>
conduction mechanism in the cathodes have been characterized and addressed. The<br>
black cathode PLEDs demonstrate extremely high optical absorbance whilst<br>
maintaining substantially no potential drop across the cathode layers. Illuminating at a<br>
-25-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
brightness of 300 çd/m2, the Al-Ag stacked black cathode PLEDs have contrast<br>
improved by 126% under 1,000 lx ambient illumination. This fabrication technology<br>
not only offers black cathode PLEDs with superior brightness level for out-door<br>
applications according this embodiment of the invention, but also provides a means to<br>
stabilize and standardize the optical and electrical properties of cathodes used in<br>
PLEDs.<br>
	Example C<br>
In this example, a wetting layer may be used to permit decreased working<br>
voltage of a device and improved power efficiency.<br>
By inserting a material with high wetting ability with the substrate and the<br>
electrode, the contact area of the substrate and the electrode will greatly increase. For<br>
example, by inserting a small amount of chromium (Cr) between the active layer and<br>
the metal electrode of a light-emitting or photo-voltaic device, one can increase the<br>
contact area of the active layer and the metal electrode. This increase in contact area<br>
can cause the working voltage of the device to decrease and result in improved total<br>
power efficiency of the device.<br>
Example D<br>
It is generally agreed that fossil fuels cannot last forever. The use of fossil fuels<br>
also causes serious environmental problems, such as the greenhouse effect, air pollution<br>
and acid rain, etc. Thus the search for clean, inexpensive and renewable energy sources<br>
as alternatives to fossil fuels is necessary. One of the options is the solar cell, which<br>
converts sunlight to electricity. It is a renewable energy source and can be used as a<br>
power source at remote locations. Unfortunately, the cost of solar energy is still far above<br>
that of traditional energy. For example, presently energy from solar cells costs 0.2-0.25<br>
dollars per kilowatt-hour, compared to 0.081 dollar per kilowatt-hour for conventional<br>
sources. Therefore, there is a need to improve the cost-effectiveness of photovoltaic<br>
-26-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
systems which may be met by developing organic/polymeric solar cells into practical<br>
energy sources. The advantages of organic materials include their excellent mechanical<br>
properties (flexibility) and the possibility of lightweight, large-area devices having low-<br>
cost fabrication.<br>
Efficient photovoltaic cells are believed to have to meet the following criteria: (a)<br>
strong absorption of photons and creation of free carriers (electrons and holes) by photo<br>
excitation; and (b) a high efficiency of collecting these free carriers. In organic<br>
			sermiconductors, photons are absorbed and tightly bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) are<br>
created instead of the free electrons and holes that are created in inorganic materials. To<br>
collect the charges, exciton dissociation is required. It is known that exciton dissociation<br>
is efficient at interfaces between materials with a sufficient difference of electron<br>
affinities and ionization potentials. Often, the exciton dissociation can be as high as<br>
100% in strong electron donor/acceptor systems. Therefore, the bottleneck of organic<br>
solar cells is the carrier transport from the (p-n) interface to the metal electrodes. Organic<br>
materials suffer from low carrier mobility and short carrier lifetime, which prevent the<br>
carriers (electrons and holes) from traveling a long distance before capture by defects or<br>
traps. Typical carrier diffusion lengths are around a few nanometers for most organics,<br>
well below the typical device thickness of around 100nm. Hence, the device thickness<br>
must be decreased in order to increase the collection efficiency. Unfortunately, the<br>
decrease of device thickness significantly decreases the optical absorption as well as<br>
increases the complexity of device fabrication.<br>
According to this aspect of the invention, we disclose several approaches to<br>
enhance the organic/polymeric solar cell efficiency by (a) increasing the open circuit<br>
voltage (Voc) of a single cell by adopting an interfacial material; (b) by physically<br>
stacking multiple solar cells one on top of another to form tandem solar cells, which<br>
could be with different polymers to cover different absorption spectra; and (c) by<br>
fabricating individual solar cells and stacking those cells vertically. Those cells can be<br>
-27-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
connected in series or in parallel to improve the device efficiency. In addition, those solar<br>
cells can be made of different polymer/organics to provide different bandgaps to increase<br>
the device overall absorption of solar energy.<br>
When combining transparent or semi-transparent metals, one can form transparent<br>
cathodes according to this invention which can be used in the devices discussed in<br>
subsections (b) and (c) below.<br>
A bulk device with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT/Polymer blend/CaX/A, is<br>
shown in Figure 15, where CaX represents a calcium compound (Ca(acac)2) shown in<br>
Figure 11.<br>
Current results from our PLED have shown that CaX has an excellent<br>
performance for electron injection. The I-B-V curves of a green color polyfluorene<br>
(G-PF) from Dow Chemicals are shown in Figure 17. The efficiency of this device is<br>
15 cd/A which is nearly double of that of devices using Ca as the cathode. This<br>
compound is solution processible and can be spin coated onto the polymer thin film.<br>
The Voc data is provided in Figure 13 for various metal(acac) compounds<br>
which suggest that this compound is ideal for high performance solar cells. Of course,<br>
other metal (acac) compounds are also possible. In addition, an inert polymer (a<br>
surfactant) was used in mixing with a Ca(acac)2 compound.<br>
Enhancement of Voc by tandem type multiple polymer solar cells<br>
Though the efficiency of single layer cells may be improved to 5% or greater<br>
as discussed previously, there are several limitations that must be overcome to obtain<br>
solar cells with efficiencies over 10%, which is a common milestone necessary for a<br>
commercially viable device. The second approach to reach high performance (&gt;10%)<br>
solar cells is the enhancement of Voc by stacking multi-cell PV cells. Some<br>
-28-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
successful attempts to increase Voc have been made by using stacked photovoltaic<br>
cells. M. Hiramoto, M. Suezaki, and M. Yokoyama, Chem. Lett. 1990, 327 (1990).<br>
first applied this idea to a small-molecule organic heterojunction similar to that first<br>
described by Tang. The Voc of a cell can be twice that for a single layer device by<br>
stacking two identical PV cells. However, to avoid a reversed p-n junction an Ohmic<br>
contact was formed between the cells by the evaporation of a thin metal layer which<br>
further attenuates light in the back cell, farthest from the side of incident light, and<br>
therefore limits Jsc in the device. The optimized stacked cell device had a lower<br>
efficiency than the single layer device. Later Yakimov and Forrest performed a<br>
similar experiment using an ultrathin metal layer 5 Angstroms thick and increased the<br>
efficiency from 1% for the single layer device to 2.5% for the optimized two-cell<br>
stack. A. Yakimov and S. R. Forrest, Appl. Phys. Lett. 80,1667 (2002). Stacks of<br>
three or more identical cells resulted in lower efficiencies. This is due to the fact that<br>
Jsc of the stack is that of the single cell with the lowest Jsc, which becomes lower in<br>
the back cell as more cells are added due to light absorption.<br>
One way to circumvent this problem is to create a stacked device where the<br>
individual layers have different band gaps. Another new idea we demonstrated is to<br>
use PV cells with different bandgap polymer layers to cover an extended region up to<br>
substantially the whole solar spectrum. A schematic of this device is shown in<br>
Figures 14a-14c. The first PV cell, having the highest band gap, is placed near the<br>
front of the device. Though a large portion of the incident light will be absorbed for<br>
photon energies above the band gap, light that is not collected in the first PV cell may<br>
be collected in the second PV cell. For the devices by Hiramoto and Yakimov, this<br>
would result in a very low Jsc in the back cell and thus the overall device. However,<br>
by employing a lower band gap material for the second PV cell, longer wavelength<br>
light that passes through the front cell can be absorbed, which would greatly enhance<br>
Jsc in the back cell and the entire stack. This method can be repeated for additional<br>
-29-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
layers, each with decreasing band gap to compensate for absorption in the preceding<br>
layers. This technique will allow Voc to be increased significantly while retaining a<br>
large JSC- By incorporating individual PV cells with efficiencies of up to 5% into a<br>
stacked PV device, overall efficiencies of 10% or greater can be obtained.<br>
One of the largest limiting factors for organic solids is that the band gap is<br>
typically around 2 eV, thus sampling only a small part of the solar spectrum. Recently<br>
however, groups have begun to report the use polymers with band gaps of between 1.2<br>
eV and 1.8 eV. A copolymer of altermating electron-rich and electron-deficient<br>
monomer units was also synthesized with a band gap of 1.6 eV. Unfortunately both<br>
types of polymer possessed low molecular weight and formed poor films by spin-<br>
coating. Higher molecular weight species of these polymers are likely to form better<br>
films and may have even smaller band gaps.<br>
One challenge in creating such a device by solution processing is that the<br>
bottom layer may also be soluble in the solvent used for the second layer, which will<br>
degrade the first film upon spin coating of the second. However, laminated<br>
heterojunction polymer PV devices have been fabricated, and we have previously<br>
demonstrated very high-efficiency laminated polymer LEDs using a template activated<br>
surface (TAS) process ideal for reel to reel fabrication. One can use these previously<br>
developed processes to fabricate multi-cell polymer solar cells using low-cost large-<br>
area coating technology. Integration of all aspects of this aspect of the invention can<br>
greatly reduce the cost of solar energy.<br>
Vertical stacking solar cells in parallel or series connections<br>
One of the problems of forming the above tandem solar cell is the upper<br>
polymer may dissolve the bottom polymer during the wet coating process. One<br>
approach to avoid the solvent-dissolving problem is to fabricate individual devices<br>
and stack them together. We have successfully demonstrated this concept.<br>
-30-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
The devices shown in Figure 15 are two or more devices stacked up and<br>
connected in series. Unlike the previous example, each layer of the device has its own<br>
substrate. Such a device has shown very high efficiency. (See Table 1 below). The<br>
devices shown in different layers can be materials with different bandgaps.<br><br>
Device	QE(%)	Voc(V)	Isc(mA/cm2)	Vm(V)	1m(mA/cm2)	FF<br>
PV1	1.07	0.84	2.758	0.58	1.850	0.46<br>
PV2	1.25		37192	0.60	2083	0.46<br>
PV1+PV2(Series)	2.57	1.65	3.400	1.16	2.217	0.46<br>
PV1+PV2(Parallel)	2.78	0.85	6.842	0.62	4.483	0.48<br>
Table 1. The comparison of device parameters of PV1 and PV2 in individual, series and parallel<br>
connection. The devices in series and parallel connection shown much higher efficiency than the individual<br>
photo cells.<br>
This approach opens a whole new direction to future ultra-high performance<br>
polymer solar cells.<br>
Transparent Cathode for solar cells and polymer LEDs<br>
Due to the need in both displays and solar cells, transparent electrodes,<br>
particularly the cathode, are very important. From the metal(acac)x described in (a),<br>
we have developed transparent cathodes that may be used in solar cells and polymer<br>
LEDs according to this embodiment of the invention. Figure 17 shows Au used as a<br>
semitransparent cathode, when combining with Ba(acac)2. A thin layer of Al (5A)<br>
has proven to be useful to improve the device efficiency. ITO or other transparent<br>
metal oxide can be used as the top conductor to replace Au such that a device with<br>
high Voc and truly transparent can be realized. This transparent cathode is well-suited<br>
for use in stacking devices. Figure 18 shows the transparency of the whole device,<br>
-31-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
which demonstrates that the cathode is semitransparent.<br>
In addition, stacked electrodes according to this invention may be used for the<br>
electrodes of the stacked solar cells. For example, Au/Al/Au cathodes as discussed in<br>
previous examples may also be suitable for the stacked laminated, series connected or<br>
parallel connected solar cells according to this invention. However, this aspect of the<br>
invention is not limited to only Au/Al/Au stacked electrodes.<br>
Novel Polymer Devices<br>
In this section, we describe a new concept to form novel organic electronic<br>
devices: the Combinational Devices. This concept is simple and yet very powerful. It<br>
allows one to form multifunctional organic devices by combining existing organic<br>
devices. To illustrate this concept, we demonstrate photo-induced memory devices,<br>
which combine the PV cells with our organic memory device.<br>
We have previously inverted a novel organic bistable device (OBD) and its<br>
electrical switching and memory effect. See, L. P. Ma, J. Liu, and Y. Yang, Appl.<br>
Phys. Lett. 80, 2997 (2002), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The device in this example has five thin fihns: an organic/metal/organic<br>
triple layer sandwiched between two metal electrodes (Figure 19). When the applied<br>
bias on the device is above a critical voltage, the device switches from a high<br>
impedance state (OFF state) to a low impedance state (ON state) and remains in the<br>
ON state. The ON state and OFF state of an OBD can be precisely controlled by the<br>
application of a positive voltage to write or a negative voltage to erase. Recently, we<br>
used a mixed metal and organic layer formed by co-evaporation to replace the middle<br>
metal layer and found that the performance and yield of the devices improved. The<br>
structure of the OBD and its typical I-V curves are shown in Figure 19. During the<br>
first bias scan, the device shows a very low current in the low-voltage range,<br>
indicating the device is in the OFF state. However, when the bias reaches a critical<br>
-32-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
voltage of 2.1 V, the current sharply increases by more than three orders of magnitude,<br>
indicating that the device has been switched from the OFF state to the ON state. The<br>
device shows a very high current while the bias voltage increases. The I-V curve<br>
recorded in the second bias scan is totally different from the first. The device shows<br>
very high current during the second bias, indicating that the device remained in the<br>
ON state. The device remains in the low impendence state even when no bias is<br>
applied until erased by the application of a negative voltage. Moreover, the switching<br>
 and memory effect of  the 0BD is repeatable These unique properties indicate that<br>
the OBD can be used as a nonvolatile memory device.<br>
A photovoltaic cell and OBD can be combined to form a photovoltaic OBD<br>
(PVOBD), which can be used as (a) an optical switch and (b) an optically induced<br>
memory device.<br>
The structure and I-V curves of a PVOBD are shown in Figures 20a and 20b.<br>
The top electrode of the photovoltaic cell is Al. The OBD device was fabricated<br>
layer-by-layer directly on the PV device. From Figure 20b, we can see that the device<br>
does not show switching behavior in the dark and stays in the OFF state. However,<br>
under illumination through the ITO electrode, the device switches from the OFF state<br>
to the ON state when a 2.2 V bias is applied, and then remains in the ON state. From<br>
these I-V curves, one can see that the PVOBD can be used as an optical memory<br>
switch. In the dark, the device will stay in OFF state even while biased over the<br>
critical voltage until a photon triggers switching to the ON state.<br>
One can connect the photovoltaic cell and OBD in parallel (Figure 20c), to<br>
provide a photo-switch. In the dark, both the resistance of the photovoltaic cell and<br>
OBD are large, i.e. the switch is off. Under illumination, the PV cell will switch the<br>
OBD to the low impedance ON state. The parallel resistance of the PV and OBD will<br>
be small and the optical switch will be on. Even after the light is gone, the OBD<br>
remains in the ON state and the switch will be on until a negative voltage is applied<br>
-33-<br><br>
WO 2007/001429	PCT/US2005/038137<br>
and the OBD is switched to the OFF state, turning the optical switch off<br>
simultaneously. Because the Voc of a single PV cell is too small, our stacked polymer<br>
PV cell will be useful to provide large Voc for this application. Alternatively, several<br>
cells in series of a multi-cell PV device could be used.<br>
The photo-induced memory effect of PVOBD has also been demonstrated. As<br>
shown in Figure 21a, three PV cells and one OBD were connected in series. The current<br>
through the circuit with and without light was then measured. The I-V curve of the<br>
device is shown in Figure 21b. Before illumination, the current going through the devices<br>
is very small, which means the devices in series have high impedance. However, after<br>
illumination the current increases about two orders of magnitude and remains even when<br>
the light is gone. The current before and after illumination is shown in Figure 21a as a<br>
function of time. The current is very low before exposure to light, and becomes high<br>
under illumination. After the light is removed, the current is one order of magnitude<br>
higher than before irradiation. (There is a low current without irradiation of light because<br>
there is background light, so the photovoltaic cells generate a voltage and a current<br>
through OBD and PV cells). From Figure 21b, we can see that the PVOBD switches<br>
from the OFF state to the ON state and stays in the ON state. Upon a negative bias, the<br>
OBD canbe switched off. The PVOBD is ideal for light detection and also has amemory<br>
effect. This behavior can be applied in photo-memory devices, such as charge coupling<br>
devices.<br>
Because the turn-on voltage of OBD is about 2.2 V, an additional voltage is<br>
required to turn on the OBD. We connect three P V cells in series to have enough driving<br>
voltage. In the future, a stacked multi-cell PV with higher Voc could be used to decrease<br>
the effective switching voltage of the OBD.<br>
In order to achieve gray-scale, a sufficiently high Voc from a polymer P V cell is<br>
needed, and the dynamic range of such device is also very important. For this project,<br>
we will apply our high Voc device to the OBD.<br>

possible. For example, semi-transparent or non-transparent solar cells according to the<br>
current invention may be used on or as parts of windows and/or window blinds to<br>
