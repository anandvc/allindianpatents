wherein <br>
R' , R' and R' are independenfty from each other hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or halogen;<br>

and to their pbarmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The compounds of formula I are known connpoiinds, described in WO 01/97786.<br>
The object of the present invention is a cyclization process forSJpr^Iration"of      ~^ benzothiazole derivatives of formula I for R = hydrogen (formula lA) and for R = -C(0)R' (formula IB), in good yields and with minimal sideproducts.<br><br>
The compounds of formula lA may be used as intermediates for the preparation of compounds of formula IB, which compounds are pharmaceutically active as adenosine receptor hgands.<br>
They are important in the regulation of many aspects of cellular metabolism and in the modulation of different central nervous system activities. The compounds of formula IB maybe used in the control or prevention of illnesses based on the modulation of the adenosine system, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parldnson's disease, neuroprotection, schizophrenia, anxiety, pain, respiration deficits, depression, asthma, allergic responses, hypoxia, ischaemia, seizure and substance abuse. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention maybe useful as sedatives, muscle relaxants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, anticonvulsants and cardioprotective agents. The most preferred indications in accordance with the present invention are those, which base on the A2A receptor antagonistic activity and which include disorders of the central nervous system, for example the treatment or prevention of certain depressive disorders, neuroprotection and Parldnson's disease. The compounds are further usefiil in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, obesit}' and ADHD (attention deficit h\'peractivity" disorder).<br>

Preferred lower allq'l groups are groups with 1' 4 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "halogen" denotes chlorine, iodine, fluorine and bromine.<br>

In general, the preparation of compounds of formula 1, wherein R is hydrogen, is well Icnown. For example, in WO 01/97786 the following process is described:<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
wherein the numbers 1-4 have the following meaning:<br>
1	HR^ Pd(OAc);, BDCP, K3PO4, DME ( ethylene glycol dimethyl ether),<br>
SO °C/24h/90 %;<br>
2	H2, PQ^C, EtOH/CH^CL, RT/12h/95 %;<br>
3	PhCONCS, acetone, RT/30min/95 % and NaOMe, MeOH, RT/2h/90 %;<br>
4	SOC!2,55'C/10niin/75%;<br><br><br>
It has been shown that the reaction variants, conducted according to literature precedent, such as Bra/CHCl;, or AcOH, hlUeOK or SOCb/CHClj are often not suitable for the preparation of amino-benzothiazoles, especially in large amounts.<br>
Due to the relative high electron density within the amino-substituted phenyl ring in some specific cases required for the present purposes, competing reactions on this ring before or after cyclization always occurred to a certain extents. Other approaches such as the use of<br><br>
aq NH4Br and H3SO4 (EP 529600) or treating the aniline directly with NaSCN/Br2/ AcOH (Synthesis, 970, 31, 2000) failed to offer any impiovement,<br>
A more suitable way of activating the thione sulphur atom was found in the acid catalyzed transfer oxidation of thioureas with DMSO (/. Heterocyclic ChEm., 63, 37, 2000). But in the absence of suitable trapping agents a dimerization reaction took place to give nndesired iminothiadiazoles.<br>
All methods, described m the Hterature, do not give the desired end products of formula lA and IB in good yields without anpredictabie side products.<br>
In order to overcome this problem, it has been found that the treatment of compoiinds of formulas<br><br>
in a good yield of up to 90 % and with minimal or no side reactions.<br>
As a sulphoxide, for example, DMSO is suitable, since it is commercially available, cheap and non-toxic.<br>
HBr may be used in any form, including gaseous, or for example in form of an in situ prepared bromide salt and a strong acid. Suitable is HBr-AcOH, since this represents a convenient form of 'liquid' concentrated HBr.<br>
As a solvent may be used, for example, CH2CI2, CH?CN, THF, AcOH or EtOAc, Preferred solvents are AcOH or EtOAc.<br>
In more detail, the reactions maybe described as follows:<br><br><br>
A thiourea of formula IT or III is suspended with vigorous stirrin.g in ethyl acetate (EtOAc) at 80 '^C. Hydrogen bromide (HBr = 33 %) in acetic acid is added dropwise within 0.2 h, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfoxide in one portion. The suspension is refluxed for 4 h. Then the reaction mixture is cooled to RT and after 0.2 h is filtered. The product is washed portionwise with ethyl acetate. The aminobenzothiazole lA or the corresponding benzamide of formula IB is then purified by Hberating it from the crude HBr-salt. This is dissolved in ethanol, diluted with water and heated to 55 °C. The obtained solution is basified with aqueous ammonia to pH 9-iO, forming a suspension which is stirred and allowed to cool to RT overnight (16 h). The products are filtered and washed portionwise with aqueous ethanol and then dried for 24 h at 45 "C. Yield -90 %.<br>
Furthermore, it has b een shown that the treatment of a thiourea of formulas II or III with DMSO/HBr/AcOH delivered the desired product of formula lA or IB (yield: -60 - SO %), but always accompanied by unpredictable amounts of iminothiazoles (-5 — 25 %). The formation of the side product was attributed to the partial solubility of the protonated thioureas of formula II or III in hot AcOH, Aqueous HBr was also effective, but induced some thiourea-urea transformation. Two equivalents of HBr was necessary for complete conversion in the cases where a basic unit was attached to the aryl-ring. The reaction proceeded best at &gt;70 °C, but was rapid and fairly exothermic at this temperature. The starting material quickly dissolved upon DMSO addition and the product almost completely precipitated immediately thereafter.<br>
It has been found that after cooling and filtration, the benzothiazoles of formulas lA or<br>
IE may be isolated in good purity. By conducting the reaction entirely in EtOAc, the<br><br>
problem of competitive dimerization was finally overcome since the HBr-salts of both reactant and product were barely soluble in this solvent thus averting all further side<br>
reactions.<br>
The compounds of formula lA may then used for the preparation of end-products of formula IB as described in the following scheme:<br>
Scheme 5<br><br>
This reaction is described in more detail in WO 01/97786.<br>
The starting compounds of formulas II and III maybe prepared as described in the above scheme:<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula III may be prepared as follows:<br>
A compound of formula IV is dissolved in sulphuric acid, maintaining a temperature between 0-10 °C. The obtained solution Is cooled to ca. -5 "C. In a separate flask, nitric acid is added to sulphuric acid and precooled to ca. 10 °C. This mixture is then added the above solution witliin 1 h ensuring that the temperature remained

Ammonium thiocyanate is dissolved in acetone at RT and benzoyl chloride is added to create PhCONCS in situ. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux and then treated with a warm solution of a compound of formula \T in acetone over 0.25 h. After 2.5h, the solvent is removed by distillation at ambient pressure with the continuous addition of water. After cooling the suspension to RT, the product of formula III is filtered, washed with water and dried.<br>
The benzoylthiourea of forrnula III is suspended in methanol at RT and sodium methoxide is added over 0-75 h. The suspension is stirred for 2.75 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to ~0 "C and stirred for 1 h before being filtered. The obtained product of formula II is washed with methanol and dried. The further conversion of compounds of formula III to IB and II to lA is described above.<br>
