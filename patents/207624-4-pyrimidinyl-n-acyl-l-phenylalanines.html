4-PYRIMIDINYL-N-ACYL-L-PHENYLALANINES<br>
Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) supergene family, is expressed on activated, but not resting,<br>
endothelium. The integrin VLA-4 (a,pj), which is expressed on many cell types<br>
including circulating lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes, but not neutrophils, is the principal receptor for VCAM-1. Antibodies to VCAM-1 or VLA-4 can block the adhesion of these mononuclear leukocytes, as well as melanoma cells, to activated endothelium in vitro. Antibodies to either protein have been effective at inhibiting leukocyte infiltration and preventing tissue damage in several animal models of inflammation. Anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to block T-cell emigration in adjuvant-induced arthritis, prevent eosinophil accumulation and bronchoconstriction in models of asthma, and reduce paralysis and inhibit monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to prolong the survival time of cardiac allografts. Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-VLA-4 mAbs can prevent insulitis and diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice, and significantly attenuate inflammation in the cotton-top tamarin model of colitis. It has further been shown that VCAM is expressed on endothelial cells of inflamed colonic tissue in a TNB/ethanol rat model of inflammatory bowel disease (Gastroenterology 1999,116,874-883).<br>
Thus, compounds which inhibit the interaction between (^-containing integrins and VCAM-1 will be useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

The compounds of the invention inhibit the binding of VCAM-1 and fibronectin to VLA-4 on circulating lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes ("VLA-4-expressing cells")- The binding of VCAM-1 and fibronectin to VLA-4 on such cells is known to be implicated in certain disease states, such as<br><br>
rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and particularly in the binding of eosinophils to airway endothelium which contributes to the cause of the lung inflammation which occurs in asthma. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of asthma.<br>
On the basis of their capability of inhibiting binding of VCAM-1 and fibronectin to VLA-4 on circulating lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes, the compounds of the invention can be used as a medicament or as a pharmaceutical composition especially for the treatment of disorders which are known to be associated with or mediated by such binding. Examples of such disorders are rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. The compounds of the invention are preferably used in the treatment of diseases which involve pulmonary inflammation, such as asthma. The pulmonary inflammation which occurs in asthma is related to the activation and lung infiltration of eosinophils, monocytes and lymphocytes which have been activated by some asthma-triggering event or substance.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the invention also inhibit the binding of VCAM-1 and MadCAM to the cellular receptor alpha4-beta7, also known as LPAM, which is expressed on lymphocytes, eosinophiles and T-cells. While the precise role of alpha4-beta7 interaction with various ligands in inflammatory conditions such as asthma is not completely understood, compounds of the invention which inhibit both alpha4-betal and alpha4-beta7 receptor binding are particularly effective in animal models of asthma. Furthermore work with monoclonal antibodies to alpha4-beta7 indicate that compounds which inhibit alpha4-beta7 binding to MadCAM or VCAM are useful for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. They would also be useful in the treatment of other diseases in which such binding is implicated as a cause of disease damage or symptoms.<br>

Generally the compounds of the present invention can be prepared from suitable phenylalanine derivatives via a palladium catalyzed reaction with a 5-halo-2,4-dioxopyrimidone.<br>
As shown in Reaction Scheme 1, a 4-iodo- or 4-bromophenylalanine derivative such as 1, is converted into a protected phenylalanine derivative 2 in which R6 is hydrogen, chloro, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy, P1 is a standard nitrogen protecting group such as a Boc, or carbobenzyloxy group and P2 is lower alkyl or substituted lower alkyl selected appropriately to serve as a protecting group or an element of a prodrug. The group P2 can be introduced by conventional means familiar to those who practice peptide chemistry. The order of the addition of Pi and P2 is not critical and will depend on the particular choice of reagents. A discussion of the use and introduction of protecting groups is provided in Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts., Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley Interscience, New York, 1991. Alternatively, a compound of formula 1 maybe converted to a compound of formula 4, in which Ri' represents a component of an acyl group of the invention. A convenient method is to introduce the ester group P2 first, followed by a coupling reaction of the free amine using conventional peptide coupling reagents, for example HBTU in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as diethylisopropylamine. Again, the particular choice of reagents may dictate altering the sequence of the introduction of Rf and P2. Conversion of compounds of formula 2 or 4 to derivatives 3 or 5, in which M represents a substituted tin or boron atom, can be effected by treatment with a suitable species, for example hexamethylditin, hexabutylditin or a tetraalkoxydiboron in the presence of a source of palladium zero. The methodology is outlined and referenced in F. Diederich and P. J. Stang, ed, Metal Catalyzed Cross Coupling Reactions, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 1998.<br><br><br>
Pyrimidine-2,4-diones (uracil derivatives) of formula 6 wherein R4' is hydrogen, lower alkyl or perfluorolower alkyl are well known in the literature or can be made by known methods. 1,3-Disubstituted pyrimidin-2,4-diones of formula 7 wherein R1 and R3 are lower alkyl, aryl lower alkyl or aryl are also known compounds or can be prepared by standard procedures. Papers reporting synthetic methods for their construction include: Shigeo Senda, et al. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1974,22,189-195, Chem Pharm Bull 1972,20,1389-1396, and Yasuo Morita, et al, Chem Comm. 1997 359-360. For the case where R2' and R3' are lower alkyl or aryl lower alkyl, compounds of formula 7 are available by alkylation of compounds of formula 6 by treatment with an alkylating agents such as iodomethane, benzylbromide, allyl bromide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate and optionally, a phase transfer catalyst. For less reactive alkylating agents, it may be necessary to use a stronger base such as an alkali metal hydroxide and to heat the reaction mixture. Compounds of formula 6 or 7 as defined above maybe halogenated in the 5-position by treatment with conventional halogenating reagents such as bromine, N-iodosuccinimide or N-bromosuccinimide in a suitable solvent such as glacial acetic acid or aqueous acetic acid to give halopyrimidines of formula 8, X = Br or I, R2 and R3 are independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl lower alkyl or aryl, R4' = hydrogen, lower alkyl or perfluorolower alkyl.<br><br><br>
As shown in Reaction Scheme 3, the compound of formula 8 can be used in a palladium catalyzed coupling reaction with a phenylalanine derivative of formula 3 or 5. For example, when M is a substituted tin, treatment of a mixture of 8 and the phenylalanine of formula 3 or 5 with a source of palladium zero such as tetraakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium or bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride in the presence of an inert solvent such as DMF at a temperature of between room temperature and 100 °C gives a compound of formula 9 or 10. Compounds of structure 9 may be converted into compounds of structure 10 by removal of the protecting group Pi, which may be accomplished by conventional means depending on the selection of Pi. For example, if Pi is a Boc group, it maybe removed by treatment with a strong acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, optionally in the presence of a solvent such as dichloromethane and a scavenging agent. The resulting free amine may then be acylated with an acid of the formula IVCO2H using conventional peptide coupling techniques. For example, by treatment with HBTU in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as diethylisopropylamine in the presence of an aprotic solvent such as DMF to give the compound of structure 10.<br>
If the free acid 11 is the desired end product, the ester group, P2 may be removed by conventional means. For example, in the case that P2 is lower alkyl, for example methyl, it may be removed by treatment with an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium hydroxide, in a suitable solvent, for example aqueous THF optionally containing methanol to assist with solubility. If P2 were a benzyl or substituted benzyl group, it could also be removed by catalytic hydrogenation over a noble metal catalyst, for example palladium on carbon.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Ct-phosphonoglycine trimethyl ester in the presence of a suitable base for example tetramethylguanidine leads directly to a dehydroamino acid of formula 16, P2 =<br>
methyl and P^ = benzyloxycarbonyl. Enantioselective reduction of 16 to the L-amino acid 18 can be effected by use of a number of reducing agents suitable for the purpose, for example, the recently described ethyl-DuPHOS rhodium reagent (Burk, M. J., Feaster, J. E; Nugent, W. A.; Harlow, R. L. /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993,115,10125) using essentially the literature procedure. Further conversion of 18 to the compounds of the invention can be carried out using the general procedures discussed above.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the N-acyl group, IV of structure 11, is derived from a 2-subsituted benzoic acid. Appropriate 2-substituted benzoic acids are either commercially available or can be prepared by conventional means. For example ortho-substituted aryl iodides or triflates may be carbonylated in the presence of<br><br>
carbon monoxide and a suitable palladium catalyst. The preparation of such iodide or triflate intermediates is dependent on the particular substitution pattern desired and they may be obtained by direct iodination or diazotization of an aniline followed by treatment with a source of iodide for example, potassium iodide. Inflates may be derived from the corresponding phenols by conventional means such as by treatment with trifluoromethane sulfonic anhydride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine in an inert solvent. As shown in Reaction Scheme 6, one other means of obtaining ortho-substituted benzoic acids involves treatment of an 2-methoxyphenyloxazoline derivative such as compound 19, Z\ and Z2 = hydrogen, alkyl, chloro, perfluoroalkyl, lower alkoxy with an alkyl Grignard reagent followed by hydrolysis of the oxazoline ring following the general procedure described by Meyers, A. L, Gabel, R., Mihelick, E. D, /. Org. Chem. 1978,43,1372-1379, to give an acid of formula 20. 2- or 2,6-Disubstituted benzonitriles also serve as convenient precursors to the corresponding benzoic acids. In the case of highly hindered nitriles, for example 2-chloro-6-methylbenzonitrile, conventional hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions is difficult and better results are obtained by DIBAL reduction to the corresponding benzaldehyde followed by oxidation using a chromium based oxidizing reagent. Other methods are exemplified in Chen, et alv, WO 99/10312.<br><br>
Referring now to Reaction Scheme 7, cyclic acids of formula 23 are known compounds or can be prepared using standard methodologies. For the preparation of substituted alkyl- or cycloalkylcarboxylic acids, alkylation reactions can be employed using an alkali metal dianion of the acid or monoanion of the corresponding ester.<br><br>
For example, a cycloalkyl carboxylic acid ester of formula 21 can be treated with a strong base, for example, lithium diisopropylamide in an inert solvent, for example THF followed by addition of group R41-L.V wherein Rn represents a desired side chain, such as a substituted benzyl, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy alkyl, azidolower alkyl and the like and Lv represents a leaving group such as a bromide, iodide, mesylate or similar group known to participate in ester enolate alkylation reactions. The product ester 22 may be hydrolyzed to the acid 23 using alkali metal hydroxide in a suitable solvent, for example aqueous alcohol. Depending on the nature of R41 and the eventual target, the compound 23 may be coupled to an amine such as compound 1 and converted to the target directly or R41 may be subject to further manipulation at a suitable point in the synthesis- For example, if R41 is an azido lower alkyl moiety, the azide may be reduced using for example a trialkyl phosphine reagent followed by functionalization of the product amine by alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation and related procedures well known to those skilled in the art If R41 incorporates a leaving group, for example, a terminal bromine atom, this group may be displaced by an appropriate nucleophile, for example, sodium methyl mercaptide to give in this case, a thioether which may be the desired product or can be itself further manipulated, for example by oxidation to a sulfoxide or sulfone using standard reaction conditions. Other nucleophiles which may be employed to produce intermediates leading to compounds of this invention include: sodium cyanide, sodium methoxide, sodium azide, morpholine and others. When R41 incorporates a ketal group, this group may be hydrolzyed at a convenient point in the synthesis to provide a keto group. This group in turn may be further manipulated, for example by reduction to an alcohol or conversion to derivative such as an oxime.<br>
Examples of the application of these methods to the synthesis of compounds of formula 23 are provided in Chen, et al. WO 99/10313.<br><br><br>
In general, ortho-substituted aromatic acids needed for the preparation of compounds in which R1 = Y-l can be prepared as exemplified in Chen, et al., WO 99/10312.<br>
For the synthesis of 2-chloro-6-alkylbenzoic acids of formula 28, wherein R43 is lower alkyl, the procedure described in Reaction Scheme 8 is particularly suitable. Thus, a commercially available aldehyde of formula 24 is converted to the imine 25 wherein R42 is lower alkyl, preferably butyl, by treatment with butylamine in an inert, hydrophobic organic solvent, for example heptane. The resulting compound of formula 25 is treated with an excess of a Grignard derivative 26 in an inert solvent, for example THF, followed by acid treatment during the workup to give an aldehyde of formula 27. Oxidation of 27 to an acid of formula 28 can be carried out by conventional means, for example by treatment of a solution of 27 in a suitable solvent such as aqueous acetonitrile with sodium chlorite and 30% hydrogen peroxide at or below room temperature.<br><br>
It may be desirable to prepare prodrug esters of the compounds of this invention for which it would be more convenient to introduce the ester moiety at the end of the synthesis. For this purpose, a variety of common techniques for the formation of esters from carboxylic acids maybe employed. Typical methods which maybe useful would include, coupling of an alcohol to the carboxylic acid in the presence of acid, for example hydrochloric acid, a procedure commonly known as a Fisher<br><br>
esterification. Alternatively, a diimide mediated coupling between the carboxylic acid and an alcohol may be employed with the optional use of a promoter such as 4,4-dimethylaminopyridine. A typical diimide is dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Another alternative is to treat the carboxylic acid with a reactive alkyl halide, for example, an alkyl iodide or an acyloxymethyl chloride in the presence of a base, for example sodium bicarbonate and an inert solvent, for example DMF. The particular choice of method will be determined by the nature of the particular combination of carboxylic acid and desired ester moiety and will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Ester groups which may constitute prodrugs may be introduced at any convenient point in the synthesis. For example the group P2 in formula 1 may represent a desirable prodrug ester and be retained in the final product.<br>

Bioassay Examples<br>
Example A.<br>
VLA-4 / VCAM-1 Screening Assay<br>
VLA-4 antagonist activity, defined as ability to compete for binding to immobilized<br>
VCAM-1, was quantitated using a solid-phase, dual antibody ELISA. VLA-4 (a4£l<br>
integrin) bound to VCAM-1 was detected by a complex of anti-integrin |3l antibody: HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG: chromogenic substrate (K-Blue). Initially, this entailed coating 96 well plates (Nunc Maxisorp) with recombinant human VCAM-1 (0.4 \xg in 100 i-il PBS), sealing each plate and then allowing the plates to stand at 4°C for "18 hr. The VCAM-coated plates were subsequently blocked with 250 pi of 1%<br><br>
BSA/0.02% NaN3 to reduce non-specific binding. On the day of assay, all plates were<br>
washed twice with VCAM Assay Buffer (200 ul/well of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MnCl2,0.05% Tween 20; pH 7.4). Test compounds were dissolved in<br>
100% DMSO and then diluted 1:20 in VCAM Assay Buffer supplemented with 1 mg/mL BSA (i.e., final DMSO = 5%). A series of 1:4 dilutions were performed to achieve a concentration range of 0.005 nM - 1.563 yM for each test compound. 100 |il per well of each dilution was added to the VCAM-coated plates, followed by 10 ^1 of Ramos cell-derived VLA-4. These plates were sequentially mixed on a platform shaker for 1 min, incubated for 2 hr at 37°C, and then washed four times with 200<br>
µl/well VCAM Assay Buffer. 100 µl of mouse anti-human integrin pi antibody was added to each well (0.6 µg/mL in VCAM Assay Buffer + 1 mg/mL BSA) and allowed to incubate for 1 hr at 37°C. At the conclusion of this incubation period, all plates were washed four times with VCAM Assay Buffer (200 nl/well). A corresponding second antibody, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (100 |J per well @ 1:800 dilution in VCAM Assay Buffer + 1 mg/mL BSA), was then added to each well, followed by a 1 hr incubation at room temperature and concluded by three washes (200µl/well) with VCAM Assay Buffer. Color development was initiated by addition of 100 µl K-Blue per well (15 min incubation, room temp) and terminated by addition of 100 µl Red Stop Buffer per well. All plates were then read in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer at 650 nM. Results were calculated as % inhibition of total binding (Le., VLA-4 + VCAM-1 in the absence of test compound). The results are provided in the following Table I (A = IC50 
 <br><br>
Example B.<br>
Ramos (VLA-4) / VCAM-1 Cell-Based Screening Assay Protocol<br>
Materials:<br>
Soluble recombinant human VCAM-1 (mixture of 5- and 7-Ig domain) was purified from CHO cell culture media by immunoaffinity chromatography and maintained in a solution containing 0.1 M Tris-glycine (pH 7.5), 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 0.02% 0.02% NaN3 and 10 ^ig/mL leupeptin. Calcein-AM was purchased<br>
from Molecular Probes Inc. Methods:<br>
VLA-4 (cx4|3l integrin) antagonist activity, defined as ability to compete with cell-surface VLA-4 for binding to immobilized VCAM-1, was quantitated using a Ramos-VCAM-1 cell adhesion assay. Ramos cells bearing cell-surface VLA-4, were labeled with a fluorescent dye (Calcein-AM) and allowed to bind VCAM-1 in the presence or absence of test compounds. A reduction in fluorescence intensity associated with adherent cells (% inhibition) reflected competitive inhibition of VLA-4 mediated cell adhesion by the test compound.<br>
Initially, this entailed coating 96 well plates (Nunc Maxisorp) with recombinant human VCAM-1 (100 ng in 100 µ1 PBS), sealing each plate and allowing the plates to stand at 4°C for 18 hr. The VCAM-coated plates were subsequently washed twice with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, and then blocked for lhr (room temperature) with 200 µl of Blocking Buffer (1% BSA/0.02% thimerosal) to reduce non-specific binding. Following the incubation with Blocking Buffer, plates were inverted, blotted and the remaining buffer aspirated. Each plate was then washed with 300 µL PBS, inverted and the remaining PBS aspirated.<br>
Test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO and then diluted 1:25 in VCAM Cell Adhesion Assay Buffer (4 mM CaCl2,4 mM MgCl2 in 50 mM TRIS-HC1, pH 7.5) (final DMSO = 4%). A series of eight 1:4 dilutions were performed for each<br><br>
compound (general concentration range of 1 nM - 12,500 nM). 100 |il/well of each dilution was added to the VCAM-coated plates, followed by 100 |il of Ramos cells (200,000 cells/well in 1% BSA/PBS). Plates containing test compounds and Ramos cells were allowed to incubate for 45 min at room temperature, after which 165 yl/well PBS was added. Plates were inverted to remove non-adherent cells, blotted and 300 (il/well PBS added. Plates were again inverted, blotted and the remaining buffer gently aspirated. 100 \d Lysis Buffer (0.1% SDS in 50 mM TRIS-HC1, pH 8.5) was added to each well and agitated for 2 min on a rotary shaking platform. The plates were then read for fluorescence intensity on a Cytofluor 2300 (Millipore) fluorecence measurement system (excitation = 485 nm, emission = 530 nm). The results are shown in the following Table II, where (A = IC50

Example C<br>
Alpha4-Beta7 Assay Protocol<br>
Two weeks to one day prior to the assay, Nunc high-binding F96 Maxisorp immuno<br>
plates, #442404 or #439454, were coated with 25ng/well (0.25µg/ml) MadCAM in a<br>
volume of 100µl/wdl. The plates were covered with sealer and wrapped in saran wrap followed by incubation in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. The coating buffer employed was: l0mM carbonate/bicarbonate buffer made up from: 0.8 g/L sodium carbonate and 1.55 g/L sodium bicarbonate adjusted to pH 9.6 with 1 N HC1. Assay buffers consisted of the following:<br>
Wash Buffer: 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS<br>
Blocking Buffer:       1% Nonfat Dry Milk in PBS<br>
Labeling Buffer:        PBS<br>
Cell Buffer:   RPMI1640 medium (no additives)<br>
Binding Buffer:	1.5mM CaCh<br>
0.5mM MnCl2<br>
50mM TRIS-HC1; add NaOH dropwise to pH 7.5 Bring to volume in H2O Adjust to pH 7.5<br>
Dilution Buffer    4% DMSO in Binding Buffer Plates were washed 2X with wash buffer and then blocked at room temperature for at least 1 hour with Blocking Buffer. Sealed plates were sometimes blocked overnight in the refrigerator. Plates were then washed with PBS and hand blotted dry. Remaining liquid was aspirated from the wells.<br>
Sufficient RPMI 8866 cells were removed from stock for assay (2 X 106 cells/ml x lOml/plate x number of plates) and placed in a centrifuge tube. The tubes were filled to volume with PBS and were spun at 200 x G for 8 minutes. The buffer was poured off and the cells were resuspended to 10 X 106/ml in PBS and a stock solution of calcein in<br>
DMSO (5mg/mL) was added at 5µl/ml of cell suspension. The suspension was incubated for 30 minutes at 37° C in dark. The cells were then washed with PBS. The PBS was poured off and the cells resuspended in cell buffer at a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/mL for plating in the assay.<br><br>
Stock solution of test compounds at 25 x first dilution desired in 100% DMSO were prepared. First dilutions for the standard, as well as test compounds, were 1:25 into straight Binding Buffer, while the remaining serial dilutions were into Dilution Buffer (Binding Buffer/4% DMSO). Stock concentrations and dilutions of compounds for screening were determined by anticipated activity.<br>
For the assay, 129^1 Binding Buffer was plated into first row of wells and 100^1<br>
Dilution Buffer was plated into remaining wells. A 5.4(Jl aliquot of each compound was , pipetted into appropriate, labeled wells, in triplicate. The compounds were next diluted down the plate (34µl + 100µ1 =&gt; 4-fold dilution). For controls, 100µ1 of Dilution Buffer + 100µ1 Cell Buffer were plated into the nonspecific background wells (no cells,<br>
no compound) and 100µ1 Dilution Buffer + 100µI cells were plated into the total binding wells (no compound = 100% binding). Labeled cells at 2 X106 cells/ml,<br>
100pl/well ( = 2 X 105 cells/well) were added to each well containing compound. The plates were sealed and incubated in the dark for 45 minutes at room temperature.<br>
Following incubation, unbound cells were removed by adding 150µ1 PBS/well. The<br>
plates were inverted, blotted onto paper towels and washed by gently adding 200µl PBS to wells and blotting again. Remaining buffer was carefully aspirated from the wells. A final 100µl PBS was added to each well.<br>
The plates were then read for fluorescence intensity on a Cytofluor 2300 (Millipore) fluorecence measurement system (excitation = 485 nm, emission = 530 nm).  IC50S of each compound were determined by linear regression analysis. The results are shown in the following table III:<br><br><br><br><br>
