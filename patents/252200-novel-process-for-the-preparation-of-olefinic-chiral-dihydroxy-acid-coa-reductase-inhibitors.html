The process disclosed therein involves four distinct chemical steps and the generation of the phosphoranes side chain requires expensive reagents and the process is both uneconomical and time consuming, and statin compounds preparation through wittig reaction leads to formation of ‘Z’ isomer, hence not suitable for commercial production.<br>
It is, therefore, desirable to provide an efficient process for the preparation of statins which improves the economics by employing less expensive reagents and is more productive.<br><br>
The alternate method for the preparation of olefinic compounds is Julia classical olefination, Julia modified olefination, Julia modified olefination process for the preparation of HMG CoA Reductase inhibitors, is disclosed and claimed in US 6875867, in this patent chiral diol sulfone (aliphatic chain of statins) intermediates used for the preparation of HMG CoA Reductase inhibitors, the disclosed chiral diol sulfones are not stable and low yields were observed when using aliphatic chiral diol sulfones when compare to aromatic sulfone derivatives.<br>
Poor solubility of calcium salt of statins has been observed in aqueous methanol with known processes for the preparation of calcium salt of statins. This is a major drawback in the synthesis of calcium salt of statins.<br>
The present invention provides a novel process which solves the above mentioned problems of known processes.<br>
The present invention provides a novel and advantageous process for the preparation of calcium salt of statins which solves solubility problem of the compound in aqueous methanol and gives free flow solid of calcium salt.<br>

Disadvantages of the prior art processes<br>
•	Usage   of hazardous  reagents   like  phosphorous  trihalides   or  phosphorous<br>
oxyhalides.<br>
•	Usage of strong base like LDA / n-BuLi followed by usage of Na/Hg in Julia<br>
classical olefination reactions, which are highly pyrophoric in nature, hence those<br>
are not recommended for commercial scale up.<br>
