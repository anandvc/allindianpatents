ROBERT BOSCH GMBH; D-70442 Stuttgart<br>
Wiping strip for wipers<br>
Prior art<br>
The invention is based on a wiping strip for wipers according to the precharacterizing clause of claim 1,<br>
Known wipers have a wiping arm which is constructed from a fastening part and a hinge part which is articulated thereon via a fold-down hinge and has a wiping rod. As a rule, a hook-shaped end of the wiping rod grips into a fitting box of a wiping blade, said box being formed by two side walls of a central bracket, and comprises a hinge pin. The hinge formed in this manner guides the wiping blade during the swiveling movement over the vehicle window/lens.<br>
The wiping blade comprises a multisectioned supporting bracket system having secondary brackets which are articulated on the central bracket and at least some of which hold a wiping strip by means of claws on their ends. The elongated wiping strip consists of rubber and has a profile with two main sections, a profiled back and a functional part. On the profiled back, the wiping strip is connected to the supporting bracket system, specifically by the claws of the claw-type brackets engaging in mutually opposite longitudinal grooves of the profiled back, In this case, the claws comprise part of the profiled back which has at least one further longitudinal groove in which a spring rail is mounted. If two spring rails are used, they lie arranged symmetrically in mutually opposite longitudinal grooves. Wiping strips are also known in which a spring rail is provided in a centrstl longitudinal  channel  of  the  profiled  back.  During<br><br>
operation, the spring rails are intended to uniformly distribute a bearing force, which is directed onto the wiping blade, over the entire length of the wiping strip and at the same time to stiffen the latter.<br>
The profiled back is connected via a thin web to the functional part of the wiping strip, said part comprising a wiping wedge and a wiping lip. In cross section, the wiping wedge is in the form of an approximate isosceles triangle, the base side of which points towards the connecting web, while the wiping lip is formed integrally on the tip. During wiping, the wiping blade is loaded by the bearing force in the direction of the vehicle window/lens, in which case the wiping lip bears against the vehicle window/lens. In addition, a force produced by the swiveling movement acts laterally on the rubber profile. While the profiled back is moved by the lateral force, the wiping lip initially remains in its position. In this case, the thin web between the profiled back and the functional part acts, on account of its high elastic deformability, as a tilting hinge, with the result that the wiping lip on the functional part approximately assumes a sitting angle of 45o with respect to the glass surface. This dragging position is the working position of the wiping lip, In this position, the wiping wedge is tilted over sufficiently far for it to bear with its outer, upper shoulder against the lower side of the profiled back.<br>
As a consequence of the oscillating wiping movement of the wipers reversing points arise in the end positions of the movement. The wiping wedge flips over here into the opposite direction and subsequently again assumes a dragged working position. In conventional wipers, this flipping over process gives rise to a disturbing noise. In addition, the wiping rubber is very severely elastically deformed in the region of the tilting web.<br><br>
tilting webs can be coordinated . with each other, preferably in such a manner that first of all the first tilting web is increasingly involved in the tilting movement, while the tilting movement of the second tilting web mainly takes place only when the supporting section already bears against the profiled back.<br>
A reduced elastic deformation is advantageous for the service life of the wiping rubber and prevents a permanent deformation of the wiping profile caused by high elastic deformation during the course of the period of use from occurring. The design of the profiled back remains essentially unaffected by the configuration according to the invention of the functional section, and so wiping-rubber profiles of this type can be used in wiping blades having the most varied claw shapes and also in "hingeless" wiping blades.<br>
Drawing<br>
Further advantages emerge from the following description of the drawing. Exemplary embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the drawing. The drawing, the description and the claims contain numerous features in combination. The expert will advantageously also consider the features individually and put them together to form meaningful further combinations.<br>
In the drawing:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a wiper blade having a supporting bracket system in side view,<br>
Fig. 2 shows an enlarged sectional illustration corresponding to the line II-II in fig. 1,<br><br>
Fig. 3    shows  an  enlarged  illustration  of  a<br>
wiping-rubber  profile  in  a  partially<br>
flipped-over position. Fig. 4    shows  an  enlarged  illustration  of  a<br>
wiping-rubber  profile  in  the  working<br>
position, Fig. 5    shows a hingeless wiping blade, and Fig. 6    shows  a  section corresponding  to  the<br>
line VI-VI in fig. 5.<br>
Description of the exemplary embodiments<br>
A wiper blade 10 comprises a central bracket 12 at whose ends secondary claw-type brackets 14 having claws 16 for holding a wiping strip 18 are articulated (fig. 1) . The wiping strip 18 is elongated and is grasped at a plurality of points in a holding region by the claws 16.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a sectional illustration through a claw 16 on an enlarged scale. This claw 16 grasps the holding region of the wiping strip 18, a 'profiled back" 20 which preferably has an overall width of 6 to 10 mm and an overall height of 3.5 to 7 mm. In addition, the profiled back 2 0 is reinforced by two spring rails 24 as stiffening elements. If only one spring rail 24 is used, it is as a rule arranged centrally. Depending on the type of vehicle, the thickness of a spring rail 24 varies between 0.7 and 1.2 mm and the width between 2.5 and 4.5 mm.<br>
The profiled back 20 is connected via a first tilting web 26 to the second part of the wiping strip 18, the functional part 22. According to the invention, the functional part 22 is formed from a supporting section 3 0 and a wiping wedge 32 having an integrally formed wiping lip 34. In this case, the supporting section 30 adjoins the first tilting web 26 and is connected to<br><br>
drawing, the tilting web 26 has an elastic deformation which occurs at the beginning of the flipping-over process at the reversing points of the swiveling movement. In this case, the functional part 22 is inclined to one side by a first partial tilting angle φ1 and a shoulder 50 which is likewise situated on this side, on the upper edge of the trapezoidal supporting section 30 is supported against the covering strip 44, The size of the partial tilting angle φ1 or the deformation of the tilting web 26 is determined by the height of the clearance 46 which, according to the invention, is 0.6 to 1,4 mm. In order, however, to elastically deform the first tilting web 26 as little as possible, the clearances 46 are widened towards the profiled back 20 in the region of the first tilting web 26 by undercuts 48 which have a height of 0.4 to 0.8 mm.<br>
The second tilting web 2 8 is likewise formed by two mutually opposite clearances 52 which extend in the longitudinal direction of the wiping strip 18 and have a height of 0.3 to 0.8 mm and are at a distance of 0,8 to 1.5 mm from the upper edge of the supporting section 30. The second tilting web 28 is situated in the center of the functional part 22 between the clearances 52 and has the same height and a width of 0.4 to 1 mm.<br>
In fig. 4, the functional part 22 is completely tilted over and therefore illustrated in the end position of the flipping-over process. Here, an upper shoulder 54 of the wiping wedge 32 is supported against a lower edge of the supporting section 30, A tilting angle (p which is required for the working position of the wiping lip 34, with respect to the vehicle window/lens 56 is accordingly formed from a first partial tilting angle φ1 and a second partial tilting angle φ2. In order likewise to obtain an elastic deformation of the second<br><br>
tilting web 28 which is the smallest possible, undercuts 58 enlarge the clearances 52 in height in the region of the second tilting web 28 by 0,2 to 0.4 mm.<br>
In the design according to fig. 5 and fig, 6, the profiled back 20 has a covering strip 60 which is fastened to a hingeless support 62, for example by bonding, vulcanizing or by another suitable process, The support 62 consists of an elastic material, for example of metal or a plastic, which can be additionally reinforced by glass fibers or carbon fibers. It has a hinge axis 64 surrounded by a hook-shaped end or by an adapter of a wiping rod 65. The support 62 is curved in the longitudinal direction, with the result that when it is pressed against the vehicle window/lens 56 a contact pressure distributed over the length is produced.<br><br><br><br>
