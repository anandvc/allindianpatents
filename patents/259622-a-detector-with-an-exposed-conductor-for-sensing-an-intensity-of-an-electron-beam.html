EXPOSED CONDUCTOR SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SENSING AN ELECTRON BEAM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electron beams are used in a variety of applications including, but not limited to irradiation of packaging materials for sterilization purposes. For example, packaging materials such as cartons used to hold liquids for human consumption are sterilized using electron beam irradiation. To provide on-line control of the intensity of the electron beam, and to monitor uniformity variations, electron sensors are used for dose irradiation measurement. A signal from the sensor is analyzed and fed back into an electron beam control system as a feedback control signal. In the sterilization of packaging material, such sensor feedback can be used to assure a sufficient level of sterilization. Different levels of sterilization can be chosen depending on how long shelf-life is desired and whether the distribution and storage of the packages is made in chilled or ambient temperature.<br>
One kind of existing sensor for measuring electron beam intensity, based on direct measuring methods, uses a conductor placed within a vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber is used to provide isolation from the surrounding environment. Because vacuum-based sensors can be relatively large, they are located at positions outside the direct electron beam path to avoid shadowing of target objects. Shadowing can, for example, preclude proper irradiation (and thus, proper sterilization) of packaging material. Therefore, these sensors rely on secondary information from a periphery of the beam, or information from secondary in-adiation, to provide a measurement,<br><br>
In operation, electrons from the electron beam which have sufficient energy will penetrate a window, such as a titanium (Ti) window of the vacuum chamber and be absorbed by the conductor. The absorbed electrons establish a cun-ent in the conductor. The magnitude of this current is a measure of the number of electrons penetrating the window of the vacuum chamber. This current provides a measure of the intensity of the electron beam at the sensor position.<br>
A known electron beam sensor having a vacuum chamber with a protective coating, and an electrode representing a signal wire inside the chamber, are described in published U.S. patent application No. US 2004/0119024. The chamber wails are used to maintain a vacuum volume around the electrode. The vacuum chamber has a window accurately aligned with the electrode to sense the electron beam density.   The sensor is configured for placement at a location, relative to a moving article being irradiated, opposite the electron beam generator for sensing secondary irradiation.<br>
A similar electron beam sensor is described in patent publication WO 2004 061890. In one embodiment of this sensor, the vacuum chamber is removed and the electrode is provided with an insulating layer or film. The insulating layer is provided to avoid influence from electrostatic fields and plasma electrons created by the electron beam from substantially influencing the electrode output.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,657,212 describes an electron beam irradiation processing device wherein an insulating film Is provided on a conductor, such as a stainless steel conductor, of a current detection unit placed outside a window of an electron beam tube. A current measuring unit includes a current meter that measures current detected. This patent describes advantages of a ceramic coated detecton<br><br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Other features and embodiments will become apparent to those skilled In the art upon reading the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals have been used to designate like elements, and wherein;<br>
Figure 1 shows an exemplary system for irradiating a target area with an electron beam in accordance with an exemplary embodiment;<br>
Figures 2 and 3A-3B show exemplary embodiments of multi-detector configurations; and<br>
Figures 4A-4K and 5 show alternate embodiments of an electron beam detector.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 shows an apparatus, represented as an exemplary system 100, for irradiating a target area within an electron beam emitted along the • path. The system 100 can include an apparatus, such as a detector 104, for sensing an intensity of an electron beam generated along a path. The detector 104 can include a means, such as an exposed conductor 105, for<br><br>
conducting a current established by electrons of the electron beam. In an exemplary embodiment, the exposed conductor 105 is attached to a support 112 which is configured to locate the conductor within a path of an electron beam 106.<br>
The detector 104 can also include a means, such as a second conductor 107, for shielding the conducting means from plasma, the shielding means having a window located to expose the conducting means to a path of the electron beam. The second conductor 107 can be Isolated from the exposed conductor 105, and can be configured to partly surround the exposed conductor to form a plasma shield. The plasma shield can, for example, include a window by which at least a portion of the exposed conductor is directly exposed to the electron beam, the window being positioned at least in a direction of the electron beam path.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the second conductor 107 Is connected to a voltage potential such as a ground potential of the detector (e.g., a ground potential of the exemplary system 100), or is connected to a voltage potential sufficient to impact a rate at which electrons are drawn from plasma in a vicinity of the detector.<br>
As referenced herein, such a rate can be determined empirically by adjusting the voltage applied to the second conductor until a desired level of consistency and accuracy in the measurement of the electron beam intensity is achieved over a specified period of time. During this specified period of time, the electron beam intensity can be monitored, for example, by connecting the second conductor to a test potential, and by simultaneously using a second independent detector (configured similar to the detector of Figure 1, or other suitable configuration, with its outer layer at ground potential). The second detector can be periodically placed in the electron beam path over the specified period of time to measure the electron beam<br><br>
intensity during a setup phase. The second detector, when periodically inserted into the electron beam path, can be used to obtain a measurement which is compared against the measurement obtained using the Figure 1 detector (which is continuously maintained within the electron beam path). Between measurements, the second detector can be removed from the electron beam path and any plasma buildup can be discharged. The voltage potential on the Figure 1 detector can be adjusted over different setup phase cycles until a voltage potential applied to the second conductor is identified which provides a desired consistency and accuracy of the Figure 1 detector measurements. In an exemplary embodiment, a voltage potential on the order of 0 to 10 volts can be applied to the second conductor.<br>
In the Figure 1 embodiment, the second conductor 107 is positioned below the conductor 105 such that the "window" is formed by an exposed portion of conductor 105 which is not directly facing the second conductor 107. Additional exemplary embodiments of the window will be discussed later with respect to Figure 4, The second conductor 107 is isolated from the exposed conductor and positioned to impact an influence of secondary electrons on the exposed conductor by substantially limiting exposure of the exposed conductor to at least a direction of the electron beam path.<br>
The exemplary detector 104 can be used In combination with other portions of the Figure 1 system 100. In Figure 1, the system 100 includes means for emitting electrons, such as an electron beam generator 102, for emitting the electron beam 106 along a path. A means, such as support 114, is provided for supporting a target material in a target area 108. The detector 104 can be used for sensing an intensity of an electron beam 106 generated by the electron beam generator along a path which irradiates a target area 108.<br><br>
The electron beam generator 102 for emitting an electron beam 106 along a path includes a vacuum chamber 110. The support 112 is provided to hold the electron beam detector at a position along the path between the vacuum chamber and the target area. The detector 104 is Insulated from the support 112 via an insulator 109. The electron beam detector 104 can be formed with an exposed conductor located at a position along the path between the vacuum chamber 110 and the target area 108 to detect and momentarily measure the intensity of the electron beam 106 exiting the vacuum chamber.<br>
The support 114 which is provided for supporting a target material within a vicinity of the target area 108 can be associated with, for example, a packaging material fixing device 116. In an exemplary embodiment, the support 114 for the target material can be a packaging material web transport roller or any other suitable device. The support 114 can be used to hold the target material in the target area at a desired measuring position relative to the exposed conductor of the electron beam detector 104,<br>
The desired measuring position can, for example, be a position which is a stable distance from the exposed conductor. Altematively, it can be a position which is a controlled, repeatable varying distance from the exposed conductor. As such, the desired measuring position can be one of multiple conditions as a target material is moved in and about a vicinity of the electron beam 106.<br>
The support 112 for the electron beam detector 104 can be configured to locate the detector between the electron beam generator and the target area 108, within a direct path of an electron beam to be generated by the electron beam generator 102, As referenced herein, the phrase "within a direct path" refers to a location between an electron beam output of an electron beam exit window and the target area, such that electrons all<br><br>
along a desired width of the beam 106 are sensed, and not just the electrons of a limited area. Electrons from the beam in parallel paths impact any target object placed In the target area 108.<br>
The electron beam generator 102, as shown In the exemplary Figure 1 embodiment. Includes a high voltage power supply 118, suitable for providing sufficient voltage to drive the electrical beam generator for the desired application. The electron beam generator also includes a filament power supply 120 referenced to the high voltage of the high voltage power supply 118 with a suitable output voltage for an electron emitting filament 122 of the electron beam generator In addition, the high voltage power supply includes a grid control 119.<br>
The filament 122 can be housed in a reflector inside the vacuum chamber 110, In an exemplary embodiment, the vacuum chamber 110 can be hermetically sealed. In operation, electrons (e') from the filament 122 are emitted along an electron beam path, such as the path along the electron beam 106, in a direction towards the target area 108.<br>
In the exemplary Figure 1 embodiment, the detector 104 is shown as being independent of the electron beam generator 102. The electron beam 106 generated by the filament 122 can pass through an electron exit window 124 of the electron beam generator.<br>
Electrons which reach the electron beam detector 104 can be detected and measured, For example, a current meter 126 can be provided to measure electrical current in the exposed conductor of the electron beam detector 104, as a measure of electron beam intensity. An output from the current meter can be supplied to a controller 128, which can sen/e as a means for adjusting an intensity of the electron beam in response to an output of the electron beam detector For example, the electron beam intensity can be regulated to a setpoint using feedback from the controller<br><br>
128. In exemplary embodiments, the electron beam can be emitted with an energy of, for example, less than 100 keV or lesser or greater as desired (e.g., 60 to 80 keV).<br>
The current meter 126 can be any device suitable for measuring an intensity of the electron beam either directly or indirectly. For example, the cuo'ent meter can be a voltmeter in combination with a resistor, or an amperemeter, or any other suitable device,<br>
The exemplary electron beam detector 104 includes an exposed conductor which can, for example, be formed as a bare wire probe. In an exemplary embodiment, the exposed conductor of the detector 104 can be a copper or stainless steel wire, or any other suitable conductor. To protect the wire from the environment It can be coated with a conductive coating. For example, the outer conductive coating can be an inert conductive material, such as gold or diamond.<br>
The conductor, when introduced to the electron beam, can capture electrons which can be recorded as an electrical current representing a momentary measure of electron beam intensity. The conductor can be configured of relatively small dimension, to fit into any geometry.<br>
When an electron emitted from the filament 122 of Figure 1 travels toward the target area, it will collide with air molecules along this path. The emitted electrons can have sufficient energy to ionize the gas along this path, thereby creating a plasma which contains ions and electrons. Plasma electrons are secondary electrons, or thermal electrons, with low energy compared to the electrons from the electron beam. The plasma electrons have randomized vector velocity and can only travel a distance which length is a small fraction of the mean free patii for the beam electrons.<br>
In exemplary embodiments, the detector can be formed as a dose mapping unit.   For example, Figure 2 shows an exemplary embodiment<br><br>
wherein two dimensional measurements of electron beam intensity can be provided. Here, an exemplary array of detectors Is formed as a grid to detect intensity of an electron beam at each of plural locations within two dimensions of a cross section of the electron beam path (that is, in a plane transverse to the electron beam path).<br>
In the detector 300 of Figure 2, an array of detectors 302 can be provided in a grid arrangement which can be attached to an electron exit window 306 The detector 300 can thus be considered as a mesh of detectors, or a dose mapping unit. Information from each conductor (e.g,, signal amplitudes, signal differences/ratios, conductor positions and so forth), can be used to produce an emission intensity plot via a processor 304. In addition, the grid arrangement can function as a protection for the exit window 306,<br>
In addition, in the exemplary Figure 2 embodiment, detectors 302 can be arranged at angles to one another, and/or at angles relative to a desired transport direction of a target material In the target area, and in a plane transverse to the electron beam path. Such a configuration can result in minimal shadowing of a target material passing beneath the grid.<br>
For example, where a target object, such as a pacl^aging material, passes from a lower portion of the diagram in for example Figure 2 to a top of the diagram, all portiions of the packaging material will be equally irradiated by the electron beam as the material passes. The angled detectors will sense the electron beam at multiple locations across its two dimensional cross section, thereby providing an accurate plot of electron beam intensity without impacting the sterilization process. However, it should be understood that in an exemplary embodiment (not shown) the angle can as well be 0 or 90 degrees, i,e. the detector can be positioned at right angles to the electron exit window.<br><br>
Figures 3A and 3B show exemplar/ embodiments wherein exit windows 308 and 310, respectively are fomied as structures having honeycomb supports, The exit window can be fonned using a foil supported on the honeycomb structure. The holes of the honeycomb structure allow the electron beam to pass from the vacuum chamber toward a detector 104a in Figure 3A. In Figure 3B, multiple detectors 104b, 104c , 104d and 104e are provided in a symmetrical arrangement. Any number of such detectors can, of course, be used. The detectors in these embodiments can as well function as a window protection.<br>
Figures 4A-4K show yet additional embodiments of exemplary detectors. These detectors can be used In accordance with exemplary embodiments as the detector 104 of Figure 1.<br>
In Figure 4A, a detector is shown comprising an exposed conductor 404 which is used to detect the momentary intensity of the electrons In the electron beam. A second conductor 402 of the detector 104 Is formed as an outer layer which is isolated from the exposed conductor 404 by an insulating layer 406. The second conductor 402 is connected to a voltage potential, such as ground potential or any other desired potential, in a manner as discussed with respect to the second conductor 107 of the Figure 1 embodiment.<br>
The second conductor 402, and the insulating layer 406, only partly surround the conductor 404 so that the conductor 404 is exposed via a window 408 at a desired shielding/exposure angle. In the exemplary embodiment described herein, the exposure angle is an angle that represents the portion of the conductor 404 which is directly exposed to the electron beam 106 (e.g,, the beam emitted via the electron beam window 124).<br><br>
In Figure 4A, an exposed portion of the conductor 404 is approximately 60 degrees such that the shielding/exposure angle would be 300 degrees. Of course any suitable shielding/exposure angle can be used, including, but not limited to angles of 180 degrees or lesser or greater.<br>
In the Figure 4A embodiment, when the target material is positioned a stable distance from the conductor, plasma will not substantially affect the conductor and measurements of the electron beam intensity. The plasma will substantially be attracted to the target material and will not be captured by the conductor 404.<br>
Figures 4A-4K show embodiments of a detector which can be used, for example, in cases where the distance of the detector to the target material fluctuates. These detectors can also be used, for example, for stable distances or distances that vary in a controlled manner.<br>
Figure 4B shows an altemate embodiment that comprises an exposed conductor 404 and a second conductor 402 maintained at a voltage potential such as ground. The second conductor is formed with a U-shaped cross section, and as shown, a shielding/exposure angle of 180 degrees. The second conductor 402 is provided so that changes In the amount of plasma electrons close to the exposed conductor 404 will be superceded by the second conductor 402.<br>
The second conductor 402 can be used to minimize impact of plasma on the current measurement and forms a shielding to the conductor 404, preventing it from being substantially affected by the surrounding plasma electrons. The plasma electrons will instead be attracted by the grounded conductor 402, In the embodiment shown in Figure 4B air between the conductor 404 and the grounded conductor 402 serves as insulation. Alternative configurations to using a cylindrical conductor 404 will<br><br>
be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, rather than a cylinder, a square conductor can be formed.<br>
In Figure 4C, the grounded conductor 402 is formed with a more squared off configuration, with a shielding/exposure angle of 180 degrees.<br>
Figures 4D-4J, like Figure 4A, include an Insulating material between the exposed conductor 404 and the grounded conductor 402 as isolation. Figures 4D-4J show alternate configurations of the detector 104, wherein for illustration purposes, the shielding/exposure angle is 180 degrees.<br>
In Figure 4D, more squared off cross sections are used for the exposed conductor 404 and the grounded conductor 402, and an insulating material 406 is provided between the two conductors.<br>
Figure 4E shows a detector comprising an exposed conductor 404 having a rectangular cross section, and a second conductor formed as a grounded substrate 402, with an insulating member 406 therebetween.<br>
Figure 4F shows a similar configuration, wherein the substrate 402 is formed to match the shape of the insulating layer 406 and the exposed conductor 404,<br>
in Figure 4G, an arrangement of Figure 4F is used with a cylindrical exposed conductor 402. In Figure 4G, note that the second conductor 402 encompasses an upper surface of the insulting layer 406 facing the electron beam generator.<br>
In Figure 4H, a cylindricady shaped exposed conductor and a grounded conductor are used, wherein the second conductor 402 has the window 408 formed as an opening in a direction facing the electron beam generator*<br><br>
In Figure 41 another embodiment is shown wherein the detector is formed as a sandwich with U-shaped cross section comprising an exposed conductor 404 and a second conductor 402 with an insulating layer 406 therebetween.<br>
In Figure 4J, an embodiment somewhat similar to that of Figure I is shown, in which the Insulating layer 406 has a U-shaped cross section. The second conductor 402 is split in two portions, whereby each respective portion is provided on one U-leg end. The exposed conductor 404 is provided on the inner side of the U-shaped insulating layer and isolated from the second conductors 402.<br>
Thus, in these configurations, at least a portion of the conductor 404 is directly exposed to the electron beam from the electron beam generator Of course, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other configurations and shapes and selections of materials for the exposed conductor, second conductor, and insulating layer can be used. For example, the exposed conductor can be formed as a conductive surface of a substrate. In the same way the second conductor can be formed as a conductive surface of a substrate. The substrate can be an insulating layer, or member, to which both conductors are formed.<br>
Figure 4K shows an alternate embodiment wherein the exposed conductor 404 is included within an insulator formed as insulating layer 406 that is in an H-shaped configuration. The second conductor 402 is provided within a portion of the H-shaped insulating member 406, such that it is isolated from the exposed conductor 404, and is not directly exposed to the electron beam 106 emitted from, for example, an electron exit window 104. The conductors 402, 404 can be formed as bare wires.<br>
Each of the exposed conductor 404 and the second conductor 402 can be connected to measuring devices, such as current meters 412 and<br><br>
414 which produce outputs Ai and A2, respectively. The outputs from the current meters 412 and 414 can be supplied to the Figure 1 controller 128. The electron beam intensity can be determined as a measure ArA2, wherein Ai is a current measure proportional to both electrons and plasma, while A2 is a measure of plasma only. These measurements can also be used to determine electron beam intensity.<br>
In Figure 5 an embodiment somewhat similar to that of Figure 4A is shown. An exposed conductor 504 is provided, which is preferably made out of a metal, for example aluminum. Said conductor 504 is partly covered by an insulating layer 506 made out of an oxide, for example aluminium oxide (AI2O3). The insulating layer may alternatively be made out of another insulating material such as for example a polymer, A second conductor 502 is formed on the outside of the insulating layer 506. Said second conductor 502 is preferably made out of gold (Au). The second conductor 502 and the insulating layer 506 only partly suround the conductor 504 in the target area, so that the conductor 504 is exposed via a window 508. However, the window 508 does not extend along the entire length of the detector, only in the target area, Le. in the electron beam path, in the ends of the detector the aluminum wire is exposed to act as connectors for the detector The detector according to this embodiment can be manufactured in that an aluminum wire is covered by a thick layer of the aluminium oxide using for example an anodizing process. The gold layer is deposited using for example plasma vapour deposition technique. AftenA^ards, the window 508 is grinded to expose the wire 504.<br>
The embodiment described in Figure 5 can alternatively comprise an insulating layer 506 made out of a ceramic tube, for example of a tube of aluminium oxide (AI2O3). The exposed conductor 504 may be a stainless steel wire, possibly with a thin coating of gold. The diameter of the wire is preferably slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the tube, so that the wire can be pushed into the tube during manufacturing of the detector. In<br><br>
this way the detector will be insensitive to thermal expansion. The tube is coated with a second conductor in the form of a gold layer 502 on Its outside surface. Afterwards, the window 508 is grinded to expose the wire 504. The window may have any shape such as rectangular, elliptic etc.<br>
