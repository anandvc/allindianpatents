Solenoid Unit and Methods of Manufacturing such<br>
Solenoid Unit and of Manufacturing a Magnet Housing<br>
for such Solenoid Unit<br>
The present invention relates to a solenoid unit for a solenoid valve,<br>
comprising a magnet coil and a ferromagnetic circuit which surrounds the magnet<br>
coil and includes a stationary magnet housing and a movable magnet armature.<br>
The invention further relates to a method of manufacturing such a solenoid unit<br>
and to a method of manufacturing a magnet housing for such a solenoid unit.<br>
Electromagnetically driven valves have a magnet coil, a magnet armature for<br>
opening and closing the valve, and a magnet housing. In the case of simple<br>
designs, the magnet housing is made up of a solid sheet metal part bent into a U-<br>
shape. These designs are preferably suitable for a direct current control. In the<br>
case of an alternating current control, these designs produce heavy eddy current<br>
losses. Bearing in mind the permissible heating, a lower amount of effective<br>
power and, hence, less magnetic force is thus available. In addition, it is known<br>
from the generic document DE 198 60 631 A1, for example, to produce the<br>
magnet housing in one piece from a sheet metal strip which is first punched out<br>
and subsequently rolled or bent. There are, however, only limited possibilities of<br>
shaping here.<br>
Other alternating current operated solenoid valves are provided with magnet<br>
housings made of sintered ferrite material to avoid eddy currents. While these<br>
housings are also suitable for direct voltage operation, two valve configurations<br>
are fabricated for reasons of cost-saving. In contrast to an alternating current<br>
operated valve, no expensive special material such as sintered ferrite is used for<br>
the magnet housing of a direct current operated valve, but reasonably priced<br>
sheet steel.<br>
The invention provides a solenoid unit for a solenoid valve, in which the<br>
magnet housing is assembled of a cover, a shell and a bottom in the form of<br>
multilayer transformer sheet metal parts. One advantage resides in the favorable<br>
shape of the magnet housing, because it encloses the magnet coil. Furthermore,<br>
thin sheet metal layers can be shaped for a precise fit without great effort, and<br><br>
-2-<br>
the electrical resistance at the layer boundaries is already sufficient to reduce<br>
eddy current effects to an acceptable degree. Accordingly, it is no longer<br>
necessary to manufacture two valve types, for direct current and for alternating<br>
current, for cost reasons.<br>
Transformer sheets are especially suitable because, in addition to the<br>
appropriate magnetic properties, they have a low thickness of a few tenths of a<br>
millimeter. Moreover, transformer sheets are mass-produced on an industrial<br>
scale and, hence, are available for use at low cost. In addition, they are also<br>
available with an electrically insulating coating, which is of advantage for an even<br>
greater reduction of the eddy currents.<br>
In one embodiment, the transformer sheet metal parts are punched and, if<br>
required, bent. Since the sheet metal parts used are of a low thickness, these<br>
machining steps can be carried out simply and at low cost.<br>
The transformer sheet metal parts have a plurality of layers, it being possible<br>
that these layers are connected to each other. This increases the stability of the<br>
transformer sheet metal parts and reduces the gap width between the individual<br>
layers. Suitable connecting methods include packing of laminations, gluing or<br>
riveting, for example.<br>
The bottom and/or the cover may have a central opening. This allows a<br>
simple assembly of the solenoid unit, by simply axially inserting the armature, the<br>
armature antipole and/or a core guide tube.<br>
In this embodiment, a radial slot is preferably provided in the cover and/or in<br>
the bottom, the slot being continuous from the central opening up to the outer<br>
periphery. This slot reduces an occurrence of eddy currents in the peripheral<br>
direction of the cover and the bottom.<br>
In the assembled condition, the bottom and/or the cover may be caulked to<br>
the shell. This is a particularly reasonably priced and reliable type of attachment.<br>
Prior to connecting the sheet metal parts, the magnet coil may be introduced into<br>
the shell without problems, so that by the caulking process a preassembled unit<br>
consisting of the bottom, the cover, the shell and the magnet coil is provided in a<br>
very simple manner.<br><br>
-3-<br>
ln a further embodiment, the shell of the magnet housing has at least one<br>
aperture, and the magnet coil is potted or is coated or encased by injection-<br>
molding. A liquid plastic mass is introduced through this aperture into the magnet<br>
housing, so that the magnet coil is embedded in plastic material. After the curing<br>
of the plastic mass, any gaps or cavities are closed off, and the sheet metal parts<br>
of the magnet housing and also the magnet coil are fixed in place such that any<br>
rattling noises in the operation of the valve can no longer occur.<br>
The shell may have a thickness that is lower than that of the bottom, and the<br>
bottom may have a thickness that is greater than that of the cover. This<br>
compensates for increased magnetic reluctances, which appear primarily at the<br>
bottom due to the non-magnetic core guide tube and the air gap to the movable<br>
magnet armature, by greater sheet metal part thicknesses. Owing to the<br>
multilayer structure of the sheet metal parts, the sheet metal part thickness can<br>
be varied very easily by varying the number of layers. The stacked sheet metal<br>
parts of the cover, the shell and the bottom may differ with respect to the<br>
thickness and the characteristics of the individual metal sheets, e.g. they may or<br>
may not be insulated.<br>
In one embodiment, the cover comprises an inner cover part and an outer<br>
cover part, the outer contour of the inner cover part being complementary to the<br>
inner contour of the outer cover part, so that the cover parts can be assembled<br>
with an interlocking fit. In this context, it is not a single transformer sheet of the<br>
cover that is referred to as a cover part, but a sheet stack built up of a plurality of<br>
transformer sheets. This structure made up of two cover parts offers the<br>
advantage that the inner cover part, which is comparatively more complicated to<br>
produce, can be identically constructed and made use of even with covers of<br>
different sizes, and the required adaptation is effected by the outer cover part,<br>
which is less complicated to produce. Because of the interlocking connection, the<br>
cover, which is composed of the inner and outer cover parts, essentially gives the<br>
impression of being a one-piece cover (although built up of a plurality of sheet<br>
metal layers), so that the magnetic flux in the plane of the cover is not impaired.<br>
Preferably, the outer cover part is formed in the shape of a U. In this way, the<br>
protective ground conductor connection of the inner cover part, which is<br><br>
-4-<br>
substantially responsible for the increased manufacturing expense of the inner<br>
cover part, is well accessible, whatever the size of the cover.<br>
Furthermore, the cover may have a covering part which covers the cover<br>
parts in the assembled condition. In the case of larger covers, by means of this<br>
covering part, firstly the sheet metal part thickness of the stack of sheets is<br>
increased and secondly the base area of the cover is not separated across its<br>
entire thickness by a joint between the inner and outer cover parts. Both factors<br>
contribute to a reduction in the magnetic reluctance.<br>
The invention further comprises a method of manufacturing a magnet housing<br>
of a solenoid unit for a solenoid valve, comprising the following steps:<br>
A)	punching of metal sheets of a ferromagnetic material;<br>
B)	stacking the metal sheets to form sheet stacks which are used for<br>
the shell, the bottom or the cover or a cover part of a magnet<br>
housing of the solenoid unit;<br>
C)	assembling the magnet housing by producing an interlocking<br>
connection between the cover and the shell and between the bottom<br>
and the shell.<br>
This method results in a simple and reasonably priced manufacture of a<br>
magnet housing for a solenoid unit which is suitable both for direct current control<br>
and alternating current control.<br>
In some embodiments, the cover is assembled from an inner cover part and<br>
an outer cover part before assembling the magnet housing, the outer contour of<br>
the inner cover part being complementary to the inner contour of the outer cover<br>
part. Preferably, the cover parts are then connected with an interlocking fit and/or<br>
with a frictional fit. The interlocking connection, but also a possible frictional<br>
engagement perpendicular to the plane of the cover provide for an unimpeded<br>
magnetic flux in the cover plane and are simple to produce. The cover parts<br>
having the complementary contours are preferably punched; the frictional<br>
connection may be obtained by means of a press fit between the cover parts, for<br>
example. When the U-shaped cover part is connected to the inner cover part with<br>
an interlocking fit, its legs may be slightly pressed apart and deformed, so that,<br>
when the connecting process is completed, the legs clamp the inner cover part in<br><br>
-5-<br>
place and prevent a relative movement between the cover parts perpendicularly<br>
to the cover plane.<br>
Subsequent to assembling the inner and outer cover parts, a covering part<br>
may additionally be mounted to the inner and/or to the outer cover part. As the<br>
surface area of the cover increases, the thickness of the cover may also be<br>
adjusted, i.e. enlarged, very easily by means of such a covering part which, just<br>
like the inner and outer cover parts, is composed of transformer sheets. The<br>
covering part is caulked to the inner and/or to the outer cover part, for example.<br>
In addition, the invention comprises a method of manufacturing a solenoid<br>
unit for a solenoid valve, which includes the following steps:<br>
A)	punching of metal sheets of a ferromagnetic material;<br>
B)	stacking the metal sheets to form sheet stacks which are used for<br>
the shell, the bottom or the cover or a cover part of a magnet<br>
housing of the solenoid unit;<br>
C)	shaping the shell such that it can at least partially surround a magnet<br>
coil;<br>
D)	inserting the magnet coil into the shell;<br>
E)	assembling the magnet housing by producing an interlocking<br>
connection between the cover and the shell and between the bottom<br>
and the shell.<br>
In one variant of the method, the assembling of the magnet housing starts<br>
already prior to inserting the magnet coil into the shell by already producing an<br>
interlocking connection between the bottom and the shell or between the cover<br>
and the shell. Accordingly, this partial step is omitted in step E.<br>
By means of this method, the magnet housing and the magnet coil are<br>
produced as a preassembled unit right away, with the magnet coil being located<br>
protected in the interior of the preassembled unit. After fitting a fixed armature<br>
antipole and a core guide tube having a movable magnet armature, the solenoid<br>
unit is complete.<br>
Subsequent to assembling the magnet housing, a liquid plastic mass is<br>
preferably introduced into the assembled magnet housing through an aperture<br><br>
-6-<br>
provided in the magnet housing, for embedding the magnet coil. The aperture is<br>
produced e.g. by punching before or after the stacking of the metal sheets. After<br>
the plastic mass has been introduced and has cured, the sheet metal parts of the<br>
magnet housing and the magnet coil are fixed in place, so that no rattling noises<br>
can occur.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the<br>
description below of a preferred embodiment with reference to the drawings, in<br>
which:<br>
-	Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic section through a solenoid unit;<br>
-	Figure 2 shows a perspective view of a cover, a bottom and a shell of a<br>
solenoid unit according to the invention;<br>
-	Figure 3 shows a perspective view of an inner cover part and an outer cover<br>
part;<br>
-	Figure 4 shows a perspective view of a cover for a solenoid unit according to<br>
the invention, the cover being assembled of the inner and outer cover parts<br>
according to Figure 3; and<br>
-	Figure 5 shows a perspective exploded view of a magnet housing for a<br>
solenoid unit according to the invention, including a multipart cover.<br>
Figure 1 shows a solenoid unit for actuating a solenoid valve, including a<br>
magnet coil 10 determining a coil axis A and having a winding that is received by<br>
a bobbin 12. Further illustrated is a ferromagnetic circuit which in Figure 1<br>
comprises a stationary magnet housing, a movable magnet armature 14 and a<br>
stationary armature antipole 16. In the present case, the magnet housing has a<br>
cover 18, a bottom 20 and a shell 22. In addition, a non-magnetic core guide tube<br>
24 is provided which extends inside the magnet coil 10 between the bobbin 12<br>
and the magnet armature 14 and armature antipole 16. The power supply to the<br>
magnet coil 10 is effected via connections 26 led through axially, which are<br>
likewise illustrated diagrammatically.<br>
When the magnet coil 10 is in the de-energized condition, the magnet<br>
armature 14 generally is biased by a spring (not shown) such that the solenoid<br>
valve is in a desired position (opened or closed). When a current is fed to the<br><br>
-7-<br>
magnet coil 10, an axially oriented magnetic field develops inside the magnet coil.<br>
The magnet armature 14, the armature antipole 16 and the magnet housing (to<br>
be more precise, the cover 18, the bottom 20 and the shell 22) form a<br>
ferromagnetic circuit which is decisive for the force exerted on the magnet<br>
armature 14. An axial air gap 28 exists between the magnet armature 14 and the<br>
armature antipole 16, so that the magnet armature 14 is attracted towards the<br>
armature antipole 16. The axial extent of the air gap 28 is equivalent to a driving<br>
lift of the solenoid valve.<br>
Figure 2 shows an especially advantageous embodiment of the magnet<br>
housing, consisting of the cover 18, the bottom 20 and the shell 22. It can be<br>
seen that the sheet metal parts of the magnet housing are built up of multiple<br>
layers of transformer sheet metal, the cover 18 and the bottom 20 having a<br>
plurality of layers in the axial direction and the shell 22 in the radial direction. The<br>
orientation of the sheet stacks, that is, the axial lamination for the cover 18 and<br>
the bottom 20 and the radial lamination of the shell 22, is selected to correspond<br>
to the course of the magnetic flux lines, with the eddy current paths which run<br>
perpendicularly to the magnetic flux lines being however interrupted at the layer<br>
boundaries.<br>
In the present embodiment, the individual layers consist of transformer sheet<br>
metal which has a thickness of about 1 mm and may be coated with an<br>
electrically insulating coating. As a rule, however, a mere lamination of non-<br>
insulated transformer sheets is sufficient to largely eliminate the eddy currents as<br>
a result of the increased electrical resistance at the layer boundaries. Figure 2<br>
shows, by way of example, some layers for the respective housing components,<br>
which are however only symbolic of a multilayer structure. With layer thicknesses<br>
of 1 to 1.2 mm, the individual components preferably comprise 2 to 9 layers. For<br>
the purpose of increasing the stability and reducing the gaps, the layers of the<br>
components may be connected with each other, e.g. by packing of laminations,<br>
gluing or riveting.<br>
The thickness of the sheet metal parts of the magnet housing may be<br>
appropriately selected very easily by varying the number of layers. As a rule, the<br>
bottom 20, for example, includes more layers than the cover 18 or the shell 22, in<br>
order to at least partly compensate for the increased magnetic reluctance in the<br><br>
-8-<br>
region of the bottom 20 caused by the non-magnetic core guide tube 24 and the<br>
air gap between the core guide tube 24 and the movable magnet armature 14.<br>
Tabs 32 on the shell 22 may be inserted into recesses 30 provided in the<br>
cover 18 and the bottom 20. The cover 18 and the bottom 20 are each connected<br>
with the shell 22 by assembling the parts and by caulking the tabs 32. The<br>
magnet coil 10 may be inserted axially without problems prior to the assembly of<br>
the magnet housing and is enclosed inside the magnet housing after caulking of<br>
the tabs 32. According to another embodiment, the cover 18 and/or the bottom 20<br>
are welded or screwed to the shell 22,<br>
Figure 2 shows that the shell 22 is provided with a plurality of apertures 36<br>
through which a liquid plastic mass is introduced after insertion of the magnet coil<br>
10 and assembly of the magnet housing, in order to embed the magnet coil 10<br>
and fix it in place. Commonly used methods of embedding the magnet coil 10<br>
include encasing or coating by injection-molding, or potting. The apertures 36 are<br>
preferably provided at places where the effect of the ferromagnetic circuit is least<br>
impaired. The cover 18 or the bottom 20 may, of course, also have apertures for<br>
this purpose.<br>
The cover 18 and the bottom 20 each have a central opening for insertion of<br>
the core guide tube 24 with the magnet armature 14 or of the armature antipole<br>
16. Furthermore, the cover 18 and the bottom 20 each have a radial slot 34 which<br>
is continuous from the central opening as far as to the outer periphery, the slot<br>
reducing formation of eddy currents in the peripheral direction of the cover 18 and<br>
the bottom 20.<br>
Depending on the respective production series of the solenoid valve, the<br>
individual sheet metal parts of the magnet housing may exhibit special features.<br>
For example, in Figure 2 the substantially circular cover 18 is cut off along a<br>
chord so as to make it easier for the connections 26 of the magnet coil 10 to be<br>
led through axially. The extent of the shell 22 in the peripheral direction is<br>
essentially dependent on the production series of the valve and merely needs to<br>
ensure sufficient magnetic flux. Preferably, however, the multilayer shell 22<br>
surrounds at least half of the magnet coil 10 and, in an extreme case, encloses it<br>
entirely, but in the latter case at least one axially extending slot should be<br>
provided to reduce an occurrence of eddy currents in the peripheral direction.<br><br>
-9-<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show an inner cover part 38 and an outer, U-shaped cover<br>
part 40 and, respectively, a cover 18 assembled of these cover parts 38, 40. For<br>
the sake of simplicity, only a cover 18 or cover parts 38, 40 are mentioned below,<br>
but, of course, the bottom 20 may also be a multi-piece part, assembled of<br>
appropriate bottom parts.<br>
The method of manufacturing the multi-piece cover 18 will now be explained<br>
with reference to Figures 3 and 4. First, the inner and outer cover parts 38,40 are<br>
produced in a similar manner to the bottom 20 and the shell 22 by punching,<br>
stacking and combining ferromagnetic transformer sheets, the outer contour of<br>
the inner cover part 38 being complementary to the inner contour of the outer<br>
cover part 40. To form a protective ground conductor connection 42 on one side<br>
of the inner cover part 38, some of the transformer sheets are provided with<br>
recesses and others with projections across the height of the cover 18, resulting<br>
in a complex contour the manufacturing of which involves increased tool costs.<br>
Because of this higher manufacturing expense, all the embodiments use an<br>
identically constructed inner cover part 38 with the protective ground conductor<br>
connection 42. In the case of small magnet housings, the inner cover part 38<br>
constitutes the whole cover 18, whereas in the case of larger magnet housings,<br>
the U-shaped outer cover part 40, which is simple to produce, is connected with<br>
the inner cover part 38 with an interlocking and/or a frictional fit. In that case, the<br>
recesses 30 of the inner cover part 38 serve for the interlocking connection with<br>
corresponding projections 44 of the outer cover part 40, rather than for a<br>
connection with the shell 22 (cf. Figure 2). For an improved interlocking and/or<br>
frictional connection between the cover parts 38, 40, additional cooperating<br>
grooves and projections may be provided, which are illustrated in dashed lines in<br>
Figure 4.<br>
Figure 5 shows an exploded view of a magnet housing having a cover 18<br>
made up of multiple pieces. In order to be able to also adjust the sheet metal part<br>
thickness of the cover 18 in the case of larger covers 18, a covering part 46 is<br>
provided; this covering part 46 covers the cover parts 38, 40, i.e. the base area of<br>
the covering part 46 is the same as the base area of the inner and outer cover<br>
parts 38, 40 when in the assembled condition. In this case the shell 22, the outer<br>
cover part 40 and the covering part 46 are caulked to each other using the tabs<br>
32 of the shell 22 which, in comparison with those in Figure 2, are somewhat<br><br>
-10-<br>
longer. In addition, the covering part 46 may also be firmly connected with the<br>
inner cover part 38. To reduce eddy currents in the peripheral direction of the<br>
cover 18, the covering part 46 is likewise provided with a radial slot 34.<br><br>
