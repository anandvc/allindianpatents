DIACETAL COMPOSITION, POLYOLEFIN NUCLEATING AGENT<br>
COMPRISING THE DIACETAL COMPOSITION, POLYOLEFIN RESIN<br>
COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE DIACETAL COMPOSITION, METHOD<br>
FOR MANUFACTURING THE RESIN COMPOSITION, AND MOLDINGS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This Invention relates to a diaoetal composition, a polyolefln resin nucleating agent containing this composition, a polyolefln resin composition containing this composition, and moldings thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Diaoetals such as dibenzylidene sorbltols and nuclear-substituted derivatives thereof are useful compounds that are widely used as nucleating agents for polyolefln resins, gelling agents for various fluids, and so on. For taking full advantage of the characteristics of these compounds, the diaoetal must first be dissolved or uniformly dispersed in a molten polyolefln resin or a fluid. However, these diacetals have strong self-agglomeration properties and also have a high melting<br><br>
point, so that uniformly dissolving or dispersing them is not easy in an industrial setting. Accordingly, the solubility and dispersibility of diacetals must be improved by one means or another.<br>
There have been various proposals up to now aimed at ameliorating the above problems. Examples include a method in which a dlacetal is treated at a temperature over its melting point or melting temperature, and a method in which a diacetal is reduced to an ultrafine powder in an effort to increase its dispersibility and make it more readily soluble (Japanese Unexamlned Patent Publication No. H6-145431).<br>
Nevertheless, (1) the first method, in which a dlacetal is treated at a high temperature, causes the diacetal to undergo thermal decomposition, and therefore the nucleating agent does not reach its full performance potential, and there are also problems with coloration, odor, and so forth. (2) The second method (Japanese Unexamlned Patent Publication No. H6-145431) involving reducing a diacetal to an ultrafine powder to improve its dispersibility and solubility leads to serious industrial problems such as dust explosion, an adverse effect on the workplace environment, re-agglomeration during storage, difficulty of transport (in particular, the difficulty of transport when discharged from a stock tank and difficulty<br><br>
of transport through pipes), decreased fluidity and other factors that make the material more difficult to work with. Also, this method requires expensive special pulverization equipment, and these and other problems have yet to be satisfactorily solved.<br>
Another known method Involves uniformly dispersing a substance for depressing the melting point in diacetal particles, thereby lowering the melting point of the diacetal (WO99/18108). This technique does not require that the diacetal be treated at high temperature or reduced to an ultrafine powder, and is an effective way to improve the solubility and dispersibility of a diacetal. However, there is still a need for (a) a further lowering of the diacetal melting point and (b) a lowering of the diacetal melting point to a practical level by using only a small amount of melting point depressant.<br>
It is an object of the present Invention to solve these problems by providing a diacetal composition with markedly improved solubility and dispersibility in various liquids and in various molten resins.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the present Invention to provide a diacetal composition which has Improved solubility, dispersibility and storage stability of the diacetal, which can give a polyolefin resin molding with a less undlspersed substance content and excellent<br><br>
transparency, and which contains a melting point depressing substance only In a small amount.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Inventors carried out Intensive research to achieve the above object. In the above-mentioned publication WO99/18108, various compounds are used In a large quantity (about 10 wt% of the dlacetal composition) for the purpose of depressing the melting point, and the effect of the dlacetal composition of this publication as a nucleating agent may be diminished as compared with the same amount of an untreated dlacetal as a polyolefin resin additive.<br>
Also, In WO99/18108, L-tartarlc acid, succlnic acid, citric acid, DL-malic acid and other such aliphatic dibasic acids or sodium lauryl sulfate are mentioned as melting point depressants that greatly lower the melting point when added In just a small amount. However, research by the Inventors has revealed that a dlacetal composition In which the above-mentioned L-tartarlc acid, succlnic acid, citric acid, DL-malic acid or other such aliphatic dibasic acid is uniformly dispersed in a diacetal does not have sufficient storage stability, and particularly storage stability at high temperature, and<br><br>
therefore cannot be considered wholly satisfactory. Also, when used as a polyolefln resin nucleating agent, a dlacetal composition In which sodium laurylsulfate Is uniformly dispersed In a dlacetal does have good dlsperslblllty If the molding resin temperature Is close to or higher than the melting point of this dlacetal composition, but dlsperslblllty will not necessarily be adequate If the molding resin temperature Is lower than the melting point of this dlacetal composition. Specifically, It was found that such a composition is not necessarily satisfactory for applications that require low temperature processing.<br>
Accordingly, it has been considered impossible to develop a melting point depressant which has an excellent melting point depressing effect when added in a small amount, and which has excellent storage stability and low temperature processing characteristics.<br>
As a result of further investigation, however, it was discovered that when a specific anlonic surfactant and a specific aliphatic monocarboxylic acid are used together in specific amounts as melting point depressants and are uniformly dispersed in a diacetal that is in a swollen or dissolved state, and the composition is then dried, the resulting dlacetal composition exhibits dispersibility/solubility and melting point depression<br><br>
that could not have been expected from the prior art, even though the resulting dlacetal composition contains only a small amount of the melting point depressant.<br>
More specifically. It was discovered that when a specific anlonlc surfactant and a specific aliphatic monocarboxylic acid are used together, (a) the melting point of the dlacetal lowers more than when either one of these compounds Is used alone, (b) the dlsperslblllty In a polyolefin resin of the dlacetal composition In which both compounds are used will be better than that of a diacetal composition that Is obtained using either compound alone and that exhibits about the same melting point depressing effect, (c) the melting point of the dlacetal lowers at a small added amount, and (d) the storage stability Is markedly Improved.<br>
The present Invention was accomplished based on this finding.<br>

Acetal compounds formed by the condensation reaction of a pentahydric or hexahydric alcohol such as D-sorbitol and a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic aldehyde in the synthesis of the diacetal represented by the the formula (1) Include the 1,3:2,4-dlacetals represented by the the formula (1), as well as other acetal compounds (by-products), including monoacetals such as a 1,2-compound, 3,4-compound, 2,4-compound or 1,3-compound, triacetals such as a 1,3:2,4:5,6-compound or 1,2:3,4:5,6-compound, and diacetal isomers such as a l,2:3,4-isomer.<br>
The diacetal composition of the present invention may contain, in addition to the diacetal represented by the formula (1), at least one member of monoacetals, triacetals, or diacetal Isomers, which are Impurities thereof. In this case, there would be no particular problems if the total amount of these impurities is not more than 10 wt%, preferably 0.05 to 10 wt%, and more preferably 0.1 to 5 wt%, and particularly 0.1 to 3 wt% or<br><br>
less, relative to the total amount of the acetals (total amount of l,3:2,4-diacetal represented by the formula (1), monoacetals, trlacetals, and isomers of the dlacetal). The presence of such Impurities Is actually beneficial from the standpoint of lowering the melting point of the dlacetal composition of the present Invention. Still, the nucleating agent characteristics tends to deteriorate If the amount Is 10 wt% or more.<br>

Dlaoetal composition of the present invention<br>
The dlacetal composition of the present Invention Is composed of a dlacetal represented by the above-mentioned formula (1) (component (A)), an anlonlc surfactant (component (B)), and an aliphatic monocarboxyllc acid (component (C)), wherein component (B) and component (C) are uniformly dispersed In the particles of the dlacetal composition.<br>
The term "uniformly dispersed In the particles of the dlacetal composition" as used In this specification refers to a state of being uniformly dispersed In the<br><br>
interior and on the surface of the dlacetal particles, or to a state of being uniformly dispersed between the fibrous dlacetal crystals that make up the dlacetal particles.<br>
In the dlacetal composition, the effect of depressing the melting point Is greatly affected by the anlonlc surfactant (component (B)), but Is affected less by the aliphatic monocarboxyllc acid (component (C)). As Is clear from the results of the comparative examples which will be given below, the melting point depression resulting from the use of component (B) alone or from the use of component (C) alone Is about 15 to 50°C with component (B) and about 2 to 10°C with component (C), relative to the melting point of the dlacetal Itself. Assuming that there Is an addltlvlty In the melting point depression. It Is predicted that the melting point depression resulting from using component (B) In combination with component (C) would be about 17 to 60°C.<br>
Actually, however, the combined use of component (B) and component (C) unexpectedly produces an effect that exceeds the degree of melting point depression predicted based on the addltlvlty In using component (B) and component (C), and the present dlacetal composition generally achieves a melting point depression of at least 20°C, particularly at least 50°C, and sometimes 80°C or<br><br>
more, compared to the melting point of the dlacetal Itself contained In said composition. This was quite surprising.<br>
This effect produced by the combined use cannot be completely explained merely by freezing point depression, and the mechanism thereof remains to be clarified.<br>
The amount of the anionic surfactant (component (B)) used In the present Invention Is 0.1 to 3 wt%, preferably 0.5 to 3 wt%, more preferably 0.5 to 2 wt%, based on the dlacetal composition. If the amount of component (B) Is less than 0.1 wt%, the melting point depression resulting from the use thereof In combination with component (C) tends to be Inadequate, and also the melting point depressing effect of component (A) tends to be Inadequate. On the other hand, use of component (B) In an amount exceeding 3 wt% usually falls to achieve further Improvement In the melting point depressing effect of component (A), and tends to diminish the nucleating agent effect to be exerted on polyolefin resins, and especially tends to diminish clarity.<br>
The amount of the aliphatic monocarboxyllc acid (component (C)) used In the present Invention Is 0.3 to 5 wt%, preferably 0.5 to 4 wt%, based on the dlacetal composition. If the amount of component (C) Is less than 0.3 wt%, the Improvement In dlsperslbllity and the melting point depression resulting from the use thereof In<br><br>
comblnatlon with component (B), anionic surfactant, tend to be Inadequate. On the other hand, the use of component (C) In an amount exceeding 5 wt% usually falls to achieve further Improvement In the effect resulting from the use thereof In combination with component (B) and In the melting point depressing effect of component (A), and tends to diminish the nucleating agent effect to be exerted on polyolefin resins.<br>
The total amount of component (B) + component (C) Is 7 wt% or less, preferably 5 wt% or less. If the total amount exceeds 7 wt%, nucleating agent effect to be exerted on polyolefin resins tends to decrease.<br>
The weight ratio of component (B) : component (C) Is preferably between 1 : 0.3 to 4, more preferably 1 : 0.5 to 3, most preferably 1 : 1 to 3. Within this range, the effect produced by using component (B) together with component (C) Is readily obtained, and superior effect Is obtained by such combined use.<br>
As stated above. In the dlacetal composition of the present Invention, component (B) Is present In a proportion of 0.1 to 3 wt%, preferably 0.5 to 3 wt%, more preferably 0.5 to 2 wt%, and component (C) Is present In a proportion of 0.3 to 5 wt%, preferably 0.5 to 4 wt% (with the total amount of component (B) + component (C) being not more than 7 wt%), based on the dlacetal composition.<br><br>
wlth the balance being component (A).<br>
The dlacetal composition according to the present Invention Is not particularly limited and suitably selected, but examples of typical compositions are those composed of the following dlacetal (component (A)), anlonlc surfactant (component (B)) and aliphatic monocarboxyllc acid (component (C)).<br>

Method for manufacturing the diacetal composition of the<br><br>
present Invention<br>
As long as the desired dlacetal composition can be obtained, there are no particular restrictions on the manufacturing method for obtaining the composition according to the present invention, in which an anlonio surfactant (component (B)) and an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid (component (C)) are uniformly dispersed in diacetal particles.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the form or average particle diameter of the raw material diacetal represented by the formula (1), but it is usually preferable to use the diacetal in the form of a readily available powder.<br>
In the course of manufacturing the diacetal composition of the present Invention, the raw material diacetal is in a swollen or dissolved state by the action of a solvent, and therefore the form and average particle diameter of the raw material diacetal seldom adversely affect the invention of the diacetal composition according to the present invention. Still, a raw material diacetal that is in the form of a powder or has a smaller average particle diameter can be made into a swollen or dissolved state within a shorter time, and thus contributes to productivity Improvement and cost reduction.<br>
According to an example of a method for<br><br>
manufacturing the diacetal composition according to the present Invention, when diacetal crystals are thoroughly swollen with a solvent or dissolved in a solvent, the specified anionlc surfactant and the specified aliphatic monocarboxylic acid (which may be in the form of a melt or a solution) are added, and the resulting mixture is dried (to remove the solvent or water), and the volatile component content of the diacetal composition is adjusted to 1 wt% or less. The resulting dry product is then pulverized or crushed, or is granulated, classified, and so forth.<br>
The important points of this manufacturing method are summarized below. 1) A low-boiling solvent is used.<br>
The boiling point (at normal pressure) of the solvent is 150°C or lower, preferably 120°C or lower, more preferably 100°C or lower. More specifically, this solvent can be methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or like lower alcohols, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or like ether compounds, acetone, MEK or like ketone compounds, or the like. The above solvents can also be used in combination with water, if so desired. A high-boiling solvent, when used, tends to remain in the diacetal composition, and therefore tends to deteriorate storage stability of the diacetal.<br>
2) The volatile component content of the dlacetal composition after drying is adjusted to 1 wt% or less, preferably 0.5 wt% or less, more preferably 0.3 wt% or less.<br>
If the volatile component content is more than 1 wt%, storage stability tends to be inferior, and void formation and so forth sometimes occur when the composition is made into a polyolefln resin composition and molded products, and the appearance and/or transparency may be impaired. As long as the conditions of 2) are satisfied, there are no particular restrictions on the drying conditions, but sometimes the diacetal composition itself undergoes coloration depending on the drying time and drying temperature. It is recommended that the drying be carried out under reduced pressure and at a temperature of, for example, 120°C or lower, preferably 100°C or lower, more preferably 80°C or lower.<br>
The diacetal composition of the present invention may take any form as suitably selected, and may be in the form of a usual powder or grains, or in a granulated form such as granules, cylinders, pellets and the like.<br>
In the case of a powder, the average particle diameter thereof is 3 to 2000 um, preferably 7 to 250 urn. If the average particle diameter is smaller than 3 um, powder characteristics tends to be poor, and a special<br>
pulverizatlon apparatus is necessary.<br>
In the case of granules, a granular diacetal composition of the desired shape and size can be obtained from a powdery diacetal composition obtained by the above method. This granular diacetal composition Is advantageous In that It has reduced dust generation and Improved particle fluidity, as compared with a powdery diacetal composition.<br>
Any of the above forms can be manufactured using a known granulator, pulverizer/crusher, classifier, or the like. Examples of granulators Include dry or wet extrusion granulators, mixing and stirring granulators, tabletlng machines, dry compression roll granulators, and oscillating granulator. Examples of pulverizer/crushers Include pin mills. Jet mills, pulverizers, cutter mills, hammer mills, planar crushers, flake crushers, nlbblers, etc. Examples of classifiers Include vibrating sifters, air classifiers, etc.<br>
The diacetal composition of the present Invention obtained as above produces the effect of having a melting point much depressed relative to the melting point of the diacetal itself, without using a dicarboxylic acid such as L-tartarlc acid, succlnlo acid, citric acid or DL-malic acid disclosed In the examples of WO99/18108, and also has better storage stability than the above-mentioned<br>
dicarboxylic acid-containing dlacetal composition.<br>
The use of the dlacetal composition of the present Invention achieves the following advantages.<br>
(1)	The dlacetal composition. In which the above-<br>
mentioned specific compounds are uniformly dispersed In<br>
dlacetal powder particles, has much more Improved<br>
solubility and dlsperslblllty In molten resin and various<br>
liquids, and much more Improved dissolution rate.<br>
(2)	Said composition, even when provided In a<br>
granulated form such as pellets or granules, has good<br>
solubility and dlsperslblllty In molten resin and various<br>
liquids. Furthermore, the use of such granulated product<br>
results In better powder characteristics, such as better<br>
dust fluidity, reduced dust generation, suppression of<br>
dust explosion, and suppression of adhesion to the walls<br>
Inside feed hoppers.<br>
(3)	Storage stability, particularly storage<br>
stability when the composition Is stored at high<br>
temperature. Is remarkably Improved.<br>
(4)	Because the dlacetal can be dissolved at a<br>
considerably low temperature, the dlacetal does not<br>
decompose or sublime during processing. Furthermore,<br>
processing at a lower temperature results In energy saving.<br>
(5)	A sufficient melting point depression action Is<br>
exhibited even when the melting point depressants. I.e.,<br>
above-mentloned components (B) and (C), are used In a small combined amount, so that the nucleating agent effect of the dlacetal Is unlikely to be relatively reduced when used within a practical range.<br>
Polyolefln resin nucleating agent<br>
The dlacetal composition used for the polyolefln resin nucleating agent of the present Invention Is useful as a polyolefln resin nucleating agent, and has a markedly lower melting point than the dlacetal Itself and excellent dlsperslblllty because an anlonlc surfactant (component (B)) and an aliphatic monocarboxyllc acid (component (C)) are used together and uniformly dispersed In the dlacetal particles.<br>
When the dlacetal composition of the present Invention having these characteristics Is used as a nucleating agent, the rate of dissolution In molten polyolefln resins Increases, and solubility and dlsperslblllty are Improved, and the following advantages are given.<br>
(a) Processing can be carried out at a lower temperature than conventional processing temperature (220 to 260°C in the case of polypropylene resins). In particular, with the present Invention, processing can be carried out at a temperature which is lower than the<br>
meltlng point of the dlacetal composition of the present Invention, and even when such low temperature processing Is performed, the dlsperslblllty of the nucleating agent Is good. Because low temperature processing Is possible, sublimation of the dlacetal Is reduced, and therefore there Is less mold fouling and so forth during molding. Yellowing of the polyolefln resin molding Is also reduced.<br>
(b)	Productivity and product quality are Improved<br>
because of the dramatic reduction In undlspersed matter In<br>
the polyolefln resin composition and moldings thereof.<br>
(c)	It Is much easier to prepare high-concentration<br>
master batch pellets composed of this dlacetal composition<br>
and a polyolefln resin.<br>
(d)	When used at conventional processing<br>
temperatures, the dlacetal composition dissolves and melts faster, so that the heating residence time during kneading is much shortened. As a result, productivity is greatly enhanced, and energy costs and so on can be reduced.<br>
(e)	A polyolefin resin molding with an excellent<br>
appearance and good transparency is obtained.<br>
(f)	Because the specified anlonic surfactant and the<br>
specified aliphatic monocarboxylic acid are contained in<br>
small quantities in the diacetal composition, the amount<br>
of the diacetal composition to be added to a resin can be<br>
substantially the same as the conventional amount of the<br>
diacetals represented by the formula (1) above.<br>
The nucleating agent of the present Invention Is generally composed of only the above-mentioned dlacetal composition of the present Invention, but to the extent that the melting point depression of the present Invention Is not hindered, a conventional polyolefln modifier can be added as needed, as long as the effect of the present Invention Is not compromised.<br>
Examples of such polyolefln modifiers Include the various additives listed In "The Tables of Positive Lists of Additives" edited by the Japan Hygienic Olefln and Styrene Plastic Association (January, 1995). More specific examples Include stabilizers (such as metal compounds, epoxy compounds, nitrogen compounds, phosphorus compounds, and sulfur compounds), UV absorbers (such as benzophenone compounds and benzotrlazole compounds), antloxldants (such as phenol compounds, phosphorous ester compounds, and sulfur compounds), surfactants, lubricants (such as paraffin, wax, and other aliphatic hydrocarbons, C8 to C22 higher fatty acids, C8 to C22 higher fatty acid metal (Al, Ca, Mg, Zn) salts, C8 to C22 higher fatty acid aliphatic alcohols, polyglycols, esters of C4 to C22 higher fatty acids and C4 to GIB aliphatic monohydrlc alcohols, C8 to C22 higher fatty acid amides, slllcone oils, and rosin derivatives), fillers (such as talc, hydrotalcite, mica,<br>
zeollte, perlite, dlatomaceous earth, calcium carbonate, and glass fibers), foaming agents, foaming auxiliaries, polymer additives, plastlclzers (such as dialkyl phthalates and dialkyl hexahydrophthalates), crossllnking agents, crossllnking accelerators, antistatic agents, flame retardants, dlspersants, organic and Inorganic pigments, working auxiliaries, other nucleating agents, and like additives.<br>
When these other components are added, one method that may be employed Is to dry blend the dlacetal composition of the present Invention with these other components to obtain a uniform mixture.<br>
Polyolefln resin composition<br>
The polyolefln resin composition according to the present Invention is obtained by incorporating the polyolefin resin nucleating agent of the present Invention into a polyolefln resin by a standard method.<br>
Compared to a polyolefln resin composition obtained by known techniques, the polyolefin resin composition of the present invention contains far less diacetal that remains undispersed or undissolved during processing, and therefore has excellent performance such that the final product has good transparency and a superior appearance that is free from fisheyes, white spots and the like<br>
attrlbutable to undlspersed dlacetal.<br>
The polyolefin resin composition of the present Invention can be manufactured by any conventional method, with no particular restrictions thereon, as long as the desired resin composition Is obtained.<br>
For example, a polyolefin resin (powder or flakes), the polyolefin resin nucleating agent of the present Invention, and. If needed, a polyolefin modifier discussed below are mixed In a conventional mixer, such as Henschel mixer, V-blender or ribbon blender, to obtain a blend type of polyolefin resin composition. Other examples Include a method In which this blend type of polyolefin resin composition Is melt kneaded at the desired temperature In a conventional kneader, such as a single screw or twin screw extruder, the extruded strands are cooled, and the strands thus obtained are cut Into pellets, as well as a method that Is a variation of this pellet type. In which master batch pellets are made from a polyolefin resin nucleating agent and a polyolefin resin.<br>
However, because a nucleating agent composed of the dlacetal composition of the present Invention has a good melting point depression effect as mentioned above, so that the temperature can be lowered In the manufacture of pellets by Incorporating the dlacetal composition of the present Invention Into a polyolefin resin. For example, a<br><br>
polyolefin resin composition in the form of pellets can be easily manufactured by melting a mixture containing the dlacetal composition (nucleating agent) of the present invention and a polyolefln resin at a temperature which is not lower than the melting point of the polyolefin resin (in particular 160°C or higher, preferably 180°C or higher) and not higher than the melting point of the diacetal composition, and pelletizlng the melt thus obtained.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the amount of the polyolefin resin nucleating agent according to the present invention to be added, as long as the desired dlacetal nucleating agent effect is obtained, and this amount can be suitably selected. Usually, the amount is 0.01 to 5 weight parts, preferably 0.05 to 3 weight parts, per 100 weight parts of the polyolefin resin. Blending within this range produces the desired diacetal nucleating agent effect. When the resin composition is in the form of master batch pellets composed of said nucleating agent and a polyolefin resin, the nucleating agent is blended in an amount of 2 to 20 weight parts, preferably 5 to 15 weight parts, per 100 weight parts of the polyolefin resin, and the nucleating agent can be adjusted to the specified amount by diluting with a polyolefin resin.<br>
The polyolefin resin according to the present<br><br>
invention is a crystalline resin having a orystallinity of 5 to 100%, preferably 15 to 95%. Specific examples include polyethylene-based resins, stereoregular polypropylene-based resins, stereoregular polybutene-based resins, stereoregular ethylene-propylene-butadlene and like terpolymer resins, methylpentene-based resins, and polybutadiene.<br>
Examples of polyethylene-based resins Include high-density polyethylene, medium-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene, and ethylene copolymers with an ethylene content of at least 50 wt%, and especially 70 wt% or higher.<br>

Polyolefin resin moldings<br>
The polyolefln resin moldings of the present Invention are obtained by molding the polyolefin resin composition of the present invention according to a conventional molding method.<br>
In the polyolefin resin moldings of the present Invention, there is a dramatic reduction In undispersed or undissolved diacetal during processing as compared to moldings produced by known techniques, and the final product therefore has a superior appearance that is free from flsheyes or white spots attributable to undispersed diacetal, and the resulting polyolefin resin moldings also have excellent transparency and so on. Furthermore, when the molded product Is produced by a low temperature<br><br>
processing, there Is also a marked improvement in respect of yellowing.<br>
Any known method, such as injection molding, extrusion molding, blow molding, pressure forming, rotational molding, or film forming, can be employed as the method for molding the polyolefln resin composition according to the present invention. The processing conditions can be suitably selected from the wide range of conditions that have been employed in the past.<br>
The polyolefin resin moldings of the present Invention can be put to use in the same fields in which polyolefin resin compositions containing a conventional diacetal as a nucleating agent have been used.<br>

Examples<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to examples and comparative examples, but the present invention is not limited to or by these examples.<br>
The melting point and uniformity of the dlacetal composition of the present Invention, and the transparency (haze) of polyolefin resin moldings, disperslbillty, and storage stability were measured and evaluated by the following methods.<br>
Melting point<br>
This was measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (trade name "DSC-50") made by Shlmadzu Corp. The temperature was raised at a rate of 10°C/minute, and the peak temperature attributable to dlacetal was used as the melting point. The sample was used in an amount of 3 mg, and 3 mg of silica gel was used as a standard sample.<br>
Uniformity (check for uniform dispersion of melting point<br><br>
depressant In particles prepared by pulverization) The powdery diacetal composition obtained by pulverization was visually inspected using a polarizing microscope under a crossed Nlcol polarizer and analyzer at room temperature and elevated temperature. If the melting point depressant was uniformly dispersed in the particles of the powder, this was indicated by "O" while non-unlformly was indicated by "X".<br>
Storage stability of diacetal composition<br>
The diacetal composition was left for two weeks in a 60°C thermostatic tank, and the diacetal content In the composition was analyzed by gas chromatography. Using the diacetal content prior to heating as a reference, the weight ratio of the remaining diacetal was noted. The larger the value, the better the storage stability.<br>
Haze value (improvement in transparency)<br>
The haze value of a polyolefin resin molding with a thickness of 1.0 mm was measured using a haze meter (made by Toyo Seki Seisakusho) according to JIS K 6714 and JIS K 6717. The smaller the measured value, the better the transparency.<br>
Dispersibility (dispersibility of the diacetal composition<br><br>
in polyolefin resin molding)<br>
The number of white spots caused by undispersed nucleating agent in ten polyolefin moldings (5 cm x 5 cm x 1.0 mm) was counted by visual inspection, and the average number per sheet was calculated. The smaller the number, the better the dlsperslbllity.<br>
Yellow Index<br>
The yellow index of a polyolefin resin molding with a thickness of 2.0 mm was measured according to ASTM D1925 using a spectrophotometer (trade name "CM-3500d," made by Minolta). The smaller the measured value, the less the yellowing and the better the appearance.<br>
The following methods were used to prepare the dlacetal composition according to the present invention and to prepare and mold the polyolefin resin composition. Method for preparing diacetal composition<br>
A dlacetal (300g), 500 g of methanol, and the anlonlc surfactant and aliphatic monocarboxylic acid listed for the various examples in Table 1 (used in amounts so as to achieve the weight ratios listed for the various examples in Table 1) were placed in a 5 L universal mixer (made by Dalton) equipped with a stlrrer, a condenser having a decanter, a thermometer, a gas inlet and an oil bath.<br><br>
After the air therein was replaced by nitrogen, the mixture was stirred under a nitrogen gas stream for 3 hours at a speed of 50 to 60 rpm and at an oil bath temperature setting of 70°C (the system became a swelled paste form). Then, 100 g of distilled water was added, and the mixture was stirred for another one hour under the same condition.<br>
The pressure was gradually reduced to remove the methanol and water from the system. After most of the methanol and water was removed, the oil bath temperature setting was raised to 100°C, and once the reduced pressure became 2.0 kPa or less, the system was dried with stirring for 5 hours. The end point of this drying was the point at which the volatile component content of the dlacetal composition reached 1.0 wt% or less.<br>
The volatile component content of the dlacetal compositions In the examples and comparative examples obtained by this preparation method were all 0.3 wt* or less, as confirmed by determining the weight loss on heating.<br>
The dry products thus obtained were pulverized in a small pulverizer to obtain powdery dlacetal compositions. Method for preparing and molding polyolefin resin compositions<br>
To 100 weight parts of an isotactic random<br><br>
polypropylene resin with an ethylene content of 3.0 wt% (MFR = 20 g/10 minutes; hereinafter referred to as "r-PP") were added 0.25 weight part (calculated as pure diacetal) of the diacetal composition prepared above, 0.05 weight part of calcium stearate, and 0.05 weight part of<br>
tetrakls[methylene-3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
© hydroxyphenyl)propio^ato]methane (trade name "Irganox<br>
1010", made by Ciba Specialty Chemicals), and these components were dry blended in a Henschel mixer. Then the mixture was melt kneaded and extruded using a single screw extruder (25 mm diameter, L/D = 380 mm/20 mm, rotation = 40 rpm) at a resin temperature of 220°C. The obtained strands were cooled with water and cut into pellets to obtain a polyolefin resin composition.<br>
The polyolefin resin composition thus obtained was injection molded at a resin temperature of 220°C and a molding temperature of 40°C to prepare a polyolefin resin molding (test piece).<br>

Table 3      Comparative Examples 12-22    (Resin used ;r-PP)<br>
The following points are clear from Tables 1 to 3 above.<br>
1)	Melting point depression effect<br>
As clear from Tables 1 to 3, the combined use of an anlonlc surfactant (component (B)) and an aliphatic monocarboxyllc acid (component (C)) depresses the melting point more than when either of these Is used alone. Even assuming that there Is an addltlvlty In this melting point depression, the resulting melting point depression Is greater than the depression expected from the addltlvlty, and therefore this phenomenon Is considered quite distinctive.<br>
2)	dlspersiblllty promotion effect<br>
Comparison of Example 5 and Comparative Example 6, for Instance, reveals that there Is a significant difference In the dlspersiblllty In the polyolefin resin moldings, despite the fact that they were processed at a resin temperature which was not lower than the melting point. This significant difference Is even more pronounced In low temperature processing and processing on a commercial scale. This phenomenon Indicates that when dlacetal compositions have a similar melting point, the diacetal composition prepared by the combined use of the two components Is more excellent in dlspersibllity than the dlacetal composition prepared by using one of these<br>
components. 3) Proportion of anlonlo surfactant (component (B))<br>
The greater the weight ratio of component (B) Is, the more the melting point tends to decrease. On the other hand, a higher weight ratio of component (B) also tends to diminish the transparency of the polyolefln resin.<br>
Specifically, the lower limit to the amount of component (B) tends to be controlled by the melting point depression effect, while the upper limit tends to be controlled by the polyolefln resin modifying effect.<br>
Examples 15 to 25<br>
The low temperature processing characteristics of the dlacetal compositions of the present Invention were tested. Specifically, polyolefln resin moldings were produced using the dlacetal compositions obtained In Examples 1 to 8 and 10 to 12 and following the procedure of the above method for preparing and molding a polyolefln resin composition, except that the kneaded resin temperature was set at 200°C, and the Injection molding temperature was set at 200°C, which temperatures were not higher than the melting point of the dlacetal composition. The transparency, dlsperslblllty, and yellow Index of the polyolefln resin moldings thus obtained were evaluated, and the evaluation results are shown In Table 4.<br>
Comparative Examples 23 to 29<br>
Comparative polyolefin resin moldings were produced using the comparative dlacetal compositions obtained In Comparative Examples 2, 5 to 8, and 10 and 11 and following the procedure of the above method for preparing and molding a polyolefin resin composition, except that the kneaded resin temperature was set at 200°C, and the Injection molding temperature was set at 200°C, which temperatures were not higher than the melting point of the comparative dlacetal composition. The transparency, dispersibility, and yellow Index of the comparative polyolefin resin moldings thus obtained were evaluated, and the results are given In Table 4.<br>
Table 4     Examples 15-25 and Comparative Examples 23-29 (low temperature processing characteristics)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As is clear from Table 4, the diacetal compositions of the present invention maintained a practical level of dlsperslbllity even at a low processing temperature of 200°C, which is lower than the conventional processing temperature (220 to 260°C), and is also improved in respect of yellowing. On the other hand, with the comparative diacetal compositions, the disperslbllity was not really adequate at the above-mentioned low temperature molding at 200°C.<br>
Example 26<br>
Storage stability was evaluated using the diacetal compositions obtained in Examples 1 to 14 and 31, and the evaluation results are given in Table 5. There was no decrease in diacetal content in any of these diacetal compositions.<br>
For the sake of reference, data for the melting point and uniformity of the diacetal compositions obtained in Examples 1 to 14 and 31 (shown in Table 1) are also shown in Table 5.<br>
Comparative Examples 30 and 31<br>
Comparative diacetal compositions were obtained according to the above method for preparing and molding a<br><br>
polyolefln resin composition, so as to achieve the weight ratios given in Table 5. The melting point, uniformity, and storage stability of the resulting comparative diacetal compositions were evaluated, and the evaluation results are given in Table 5.<br>
Table 5  Example 26 and Comparative Examples 30 and 31 (storage<br>
stability)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As is clear from Table 5, the melting point was lowered considerably with L-tartarlc acid or DL-malic acid, but when the compositions were stored for two weeks at 60°C, the diacetal content decreased approximately 10%.<br>
In contrast, the diacetal compositions of the present invention maintained the same diacetal content they had immediately after being prepared, and therefore had superior storage stability.<br>
Example 27<br>
The procedure of Example 5 was repeated except that an isotactio homopolypropylene resin (MFR = 30 g/10 minutes, hereinafter referred to as "h-PP") was used Instead of the r-PP. The evaluation results are given in Table 6.<br>
Example 28<br>
The procedure of Example 12 was repeated except that a linear low density polyethylene resin (MFR = 20 g/10 minutes, hereinafter referred to as "LLDPE") was used Instead of the r-PP and that the kneaded resin temperature and the injection molding temperature were both changed to 200°C. The evaluation results are given in Table 6.<br>
Comparative Example 32<br>
The procedure of Comparative Example 5 was repeated except that h-PP was used instead of r-PP. The evaluation results are given in Table 6.<br>

As is clear from Table 6, the diacetal compositions of the present invention can be applied to other polyolefin resins besides r-PP, such as h-PP or LLDPE, and the Improvement in dispersibility and so forth when applied to r-PP is achieved in the other resins as well.<br>

Comparative Example 36<br>
A comparative resin molding was produced following the above method for preparing and molding a polyolefin resin composition with the exception of not using the diacetal composition of the present invention and using LLDPE instead of r-PP and changing the kneaded resin temperature and injection molding temperature to 200°C. The evaluation results are given in Table 7.<br>
Comparative Example 37<br>
A comparative resin molding was produced following<br><br>
the above method for preparing and molding a polyolefin resin composition with the exception of not using the diacetal composition of the present invention and changing the kneaded resin temperature and injection molding temperature to 200°C.  The evaluation results are given in Table 7.<br>
Table 7  Comparative Examples 34-37<br>
(evaluation of molding of resin alone)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As is clear from Table 7, when the diacetal composition of the present invention was not used, transparency was extremely low, as seen from the high haze value of the resin moldings prepared at molding temperatures of 220°C and 200°C.  In contrast, as can be seen from Table 1 and the like, there was a marked<br>
Improvement in respect of haze when the dlacetal composition of the present invention was used.<br>
As to yellow index, the diacetal composition, when used as a polyolefln resin nucleating agent, has no adverse effect on the yellowing of the polyolefin resin itself, and therefore the diacetal composition of the present invention can be used in a conventional manner.<br>
Example 29 and Comparative Example 38<br>
A diacetal composition (Example 29) and a comparative diacetal composition (Comparative Example 38) were prepared following the above method for preparing and molding a polyolefln resin composition, so as to achieve the weight ratios shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 also shows the results of the melting point measurement.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the Influence of the weight ratio (X wt%) of sodium lauryl sulfate on the effect of depressing the melting point of the diacetal and on the effect of combined use with stearlc acid, when the amount of stearlc acid is fixed at 2.0 wt%.<br>
Specifically, the composition of Example 29 is such that Me-DBS:sodium lauryl sulfate:stearlc acid = (98.0 -X):X:2.0, and the composition of Comparative Example 38 is such that Me-DBS:sodi\im lauryl sulfate = (100 - X) :X.<br>
Fig. 1 reveals the following:<br>
1)	When sodium lauryl sulfate Is used alone. It Is<br>
difficult to lower the melting point of the dlacetal<br>
composition below 200°C, and the amount thereof to be used<br>
must be Increased to more than 5 wt%. The use of sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate In such a large amount tends to result In a<br>
polyolefln resin having Impaired transparency. When the<br>
amount Is over 3 wt%. It may be Impossible to use the<br>
composition In applications In which conventional<br>
polyolefln resin moldings have been used.<br>
In contrast, when sodium lauryl sulfate Is used together with stearlc acid according to the present Invention, the melting point of the dlacetal composition becomes under 200°C when the amount of sodium lauryl sulfate used Is only about 2 wt%.<br>
2)	By the combined use of sodium lauryl sulfate and<br>
stearlc acid, the melting point of the dlacetal Is lowered<br>
even below the melting point predicted based on the<br>
assumed addltlvlty.<br>
Usually there Is a linear relation over a certain range between melting point depression and the added amount (moles) based on the theory of freezing point depression. Nevertheless, component (B) or component (C), even when used alone, exhibits melting point depression behavior that cannot be explained by the theory of freezing point depression, and when component (B) and<br>
component (C) are used together as in the present invention, the range of processing resin temperatures can be extended downward because of the effect of increasing dispersiblllty and further depressing the melting point of the diacetal.<br>
3) As to the amount of sodium lauryl sulfate In Example 29, the lower limit of the amount to be used is 0.1 wt%, since the melting point depression effect is produced when sodium lauryl sulfate is used in an amount of at least 0.1 wt%. If we take into account the applications in which polyolefin resin moldings have heretofore been used (and particularly the transparency of the polyolefin resin), the upper limit of its amount should be 3 wt%.<br>
As seen from Fig. 1, in order to obtain stable performance and quality when the diacetal composition is commercially manufactured, recommended amount is in the range of 0.5 to 2 wt%, in which the curve in the graph shows a gentle slope.<br>
Example 30<br>
A diacetal composition was prepared following the above method for preparing and molding a polyolefin resin composition, so as to achieve the weight ratios shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 also shows the results of the melting<br>
polnt measurement.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the influence of the weight ratio (Y wt%) of stearlo acid on the melting point depression and on the effect of combined use with sodium lauryl sulfate, when the amount of sodium lauryl sulfate Is fixed at 1.0 wt%. The composition of Example 30 Is such that Me-DBS:sodium lauryl sulfate:stearic acid = (99.0 - Y):1.0:Y.<br>
Fig. 2 reveals the following:<br>
1)	When stearic acid Is used together with sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate, there Is a pronounced decrease In the<br>
melting point of the dlacetal composition.<br>
2)	A melting point depression effect and combined<br>
use effect are produced when stearic acid Is used In<br>
Example 30 In an amount of at least 0.3 wt%. The upper<br>
limit of the amount to be used Is 5 wt% for the sake of<br>
the nucleating agent effect of the polyolefln resin, the<br>
melting point depression effect, and the dlsperslblllty<br>
promotion effect.<br>
In order to obtain stable performance and quality when the dlacetal composition Is commercially manufactured, a range of 1 to 3 wt% Is recommended In which the curve In the graph of Fig. 2 shows a gentle slope.<br>
3)	The combined use effect of stearic acid<br>
(component (C)) and sodium lauryl sulfate (component (B);<br>
1.0 wt%) In Example 30 Is realized at a ratio of component<br><br>
 (B) : component (C) = 1 : 0.3 or higher, and the Improvement in the combined use effect Is saturated when the ratio of component (B) : component (C) Is 1: 4 or higher. Specifically, from the standpoint of the combined use effect, the recommended weight ratio of component (B) : component (C) Is 1 : 0.3 to 4, especially 1 : 0.5 to 3.<br>
Example 31<br>
The powdery dlacetal composition of Example 5 was compressed using a dry compression roll granulator Into a plate with a width of 25 cm at a roll pressure of 5 MPa. Then, using a hammer mill, the compressed sheet was crushed at a speed of 1000 rpm with a screen mesh having an opening dimension of 1 mm.<br>
The dlacetal composition particles thus obtained had an average particle diameter of 200 pm. A dry particle size measurement apparatus (trade name: Mlcrotrao MT3300 (high-speed multi-point processing model. Super Dry X), manufactured by Mlcrotrac) was used to measure the particle size distribution.<br>
Table 1 shows the results of evaluating the melting point and uniformity of the diacetal composition particles thus obtained.<br>
In the above method for producing particles, the<br><br>
particle size distribution can be adjusted as desired by varying the compression pressure, rotation speed during pulverization, screen mesh and so forth. Furthermore, granulation at the above roll pressure causes no dust problems, and solubility In a polyolefin resin Is also good.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The present Invention makes It possible to greatly lower the melting point of a dlacetal and to promote Its dlsperslblllty In polyolefin resins. As a result, the present Invention Increases the rate of dissolution In various liquids and molten polyolefin resins, enables lower temperature dissolution and shorter dissolution time, and also dramatically reduces the amount of undlssolved matter, which greatly Improves product quality and productivity.<br>
Also, when the composition is used as a polyolefin resin nucleating agent, in addition to the effects mentioned above, processing at a lower temperature not only suppresses yellowing and sublimation of the dlacetal composition, but also gives a polyolefin resin molding having good transparency and excellent appearance.<br><br><br><br>
