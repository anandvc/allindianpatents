"COPMPOSITION COMPRISING COMPOUND OF FORMULA (1-1 )"AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF"<br><br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>

Active compound combinations having insecticidal and acaricidal properties<br>
The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations comprising<br>
5	known cyclic ketoenols on the one hand and other known insecticidally active<br>
compounds on the other hand and which are highly suitable for controlling animal pests such as insects and undesired acarids.<br>
It is already known that certain cyclic ketoenols have insecticidal and acaricidal<br>
10	properties (EP-A-528  156). Further ketoenols having insecticidal and acaricidal<br>
properties are described in WO 95/01971, EP-A-647 637, WO 96/16061,<br>
WO 96/20196, WO 96/25395, WO 96/35664, WO 97/02243, WO 97/01535,<br>
WO 97/36868, WO 97/43275, WO 98/05638, WO 98/06721, WO 99/16748,<br>
WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869 and WO 99/55673. The activity of these substances is<br>
15	good; however, at low application rates it is sometimes unsatisfactory.<br>
Furthermore, it is already known that numerous heterocycles, organotin compounds,<br>
benzoylureas and pyrethroids have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (cf. WO 93-<br>
22 297, WO 93-10 083, DE-A 2 641343, EP-A-347 488, EP-A-210487, US-A<br>
20	3 264 177 and EP-A-234 045). However, the activity of these substances is not<br>
always satisfactory.<br>

Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from<br>
the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum<br>
species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as<br>
Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a<br>
20	consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs owing to higher energy<br>
consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling<br>
by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia<br>
25	(cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>

30	All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are-<br>
to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations<br><br>
Le A 34 320 Foreign Countries<br>
such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (inclusive of naturally<br>
occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by<br>
conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and<br>
genetical engineering or by combinations of these methods, inclusive of the<br>
5	transgenic plants and inclusive of the plant varieties protectable or not protectable by<br>
plant breeders" rights, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be<br>
mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds,<br>
roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and<br>
vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers,<br>
10	rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the<br>
surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for<br>
15	example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in<br>
the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seed, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
20	to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant varieties, or<br>
those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast<br>
fusion, and parts thereof, are treated, hi a further preferred embodiment, transgenic<br>
plants and plant varieties obtained by genetical engineering, if appropriate in<br>
combination with conventional methods (Genetic Modified Organisms), and parts<br>
25	thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been<br>
explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably,  plants  of the  plant varieties  which  are  in  each  case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. 30<br><br>
Le A 34 320 Foreign Countries<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant varieties, their location and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the<br>
invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example,<br>
reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
5	increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used<br>
according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low<br>
temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased<br>
flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest<br>
yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products,<br>
10	better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible<br>
which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant varieties (i.e. those obtained by genetical engineering) which are preferred and to be treated according to the invention include all plants<br>
15	which,  in  the  genetic  modification,  received  genetic  material  which  imparts<br>
particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest<br>
20	yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products,<br>
better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain<br>
25	herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be<br>
mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are particularly emphasized are<br>
30	increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in<br>
particular those formed by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for<br><br>
Le A 34 320 Foreign Countries<br>
example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CrymB2,<br>
Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelov/<br>
referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the<br>
increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for<br>
5	example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example<br>
the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD®<br>
10	(for  example  maize,   cotton,   soya  beans),  KnockOut®  (for  example  maize),<br>
StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton,<br>
15	soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape),<br>
IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylurea, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to<br>
20	plant varieties having these or still to be developed genetic traits, which plants will be<br>
developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in  a particularly<br>
advantageous manner with the active compound mixtures according to the invention.<br>
25	The preferred ranges stated above for the mixtures also apply to the treatment of<br>
these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
The good insecticidal and acaricidal action of the active compound combinations<br>
30	according to the invention can be seen from the examples which follow. While the<br><br>
Le A 34 320 Foreign Countries<br>
individual active compounds show weaknesses in their action, the combinations show an action which exceeds a simple sum of actions.<br>
A synergistic effect in insecticides and acaricides is always present when the action<br>
5	of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the actions of the active<br>
compounds when applied individually.<br>
The expected action for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows, using the formula of S.R. Colby, Weeds \5_ (1967), 20-22:<br>
10<br>
If<br>
X        is the kill rate, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing<br>
active compound A at an application rate of m g/ha or in a concentration of m<br>
15	ppm,<br>
Y is the kill rate, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing active compound B at an application rate of n g/ha or in a concentration of n ppm and<br>
20<br>
is the kill rate, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing active compounds A and B at application rates of m and n g/ha or in a concentration of m and n ppm,<br>
25	then<br><br>
If the actual insecticidal kill rate exceeds the calculated value, the action of the<br>
30	combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present. In this case, the<br><br>
Le A 34 320 Foreign Countries<br>
actually observed kill rate must exceed the value calculated using the above formula for the expected kill rate (E).<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill in % is determined. 100% means that all<br>
5	animals have been killed: 0% means that none of the animals have been killed.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a composition comprising compound of formula (I-b-1):<br><br>
and at least one of the compounds selected from the list below:<br>
bifenazate<br>
abamectin<br>

Example<br>
Critical concentration test/soil insects - treatment of transgenic plants<br>
Test insect:     Diabrotica balteata - larvae in soil<br>
Solvent:	7 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier:      1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
The preparation of active compound is poured onto the soil. Here, the concentration of the active compound iii the preparation is virtually irrelevant, only the amount by weight of active compound per volume unit of soil, which is stated in ppm (mg/1), matters. The soil is filled into 0.25 1 pots and these are allowed to stand at 20°C.<br><br>
20<br>
Immediately after preparation, 5 pre-germinated maize corns of the variety YIELD<br>
GUARD (trade mark of Monsanto Comp., USA) are placed into each pot. After 2<br>
days, the test insects in question are placed into the treated soil. After a fiirther 7<br>
days, the efficacy of the active compound is determined by counting the maize plants<br>
25	that have emerged (1 plant = 20% efficacy).<br><br>
