MULTIPHOTON PHOTOSENSITIZATION METHOD<br>
FIELD<br>
This invention relates to multiphoton methods of photo-inducing chemical reactions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Molecular two-photon absorption was predicted by Goppert-Mayer in 1931. Upon the invention of pulsed ruby lasers in 1960, experimental observation of two-photon absorption became a reality. Subsequently, two-photon excitation has found application in biology and optical data storage, as well as in other fields.<br>
There are two key differences between two-photon induced photoprocesses and single-photon induced processes. Whereas single-photon absorption scales linearly with the intensity of the incident radiation, two-photon absorption scales quadratically. Higher-order absorptions scale with a related higher power of incident intensity. As a result, it is possible to perform multiphoton processes with three-dimen.sional spatial resolution. Also, because multiphoton processes involve the simultaneous absorption of two or more photons, the absorbing chromophore is excited with a number of photons whose total energy approximates the energy of an electronic excited state of the multiphoton photosensitizer that is utilized. Because the exciting light is not attenuated by single-photon absorption within a curable matric or material, it is possible to selectively excite molecules at a greater depth within a material than would be possible via single-photon excitation by use of a beam that is focused to that depth in the material. These two phenomena also apply, for example, to excitation within tissue or other biological materials.<br>
Major benefits have been achieved by applying multiphoton absorption to the areas of photocuring and microfabrication. For example, in multiphoton lithography or stereoiithography, the nonlinear scaling of multiphoton absorption with intensity has provided the ability to write features having a size that is less than the diffraction limit of the light utilized, as well as the ability to write features in three dimensions (which is<br><br>
also of interest for holography). Such work has been limited, however, to slow writing speeds and high laser powers, due to the low photosensitivities of current multiphoton-activatable, photoreactive compositions.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Thus, we recognize that there is a need for multiphoton photosensitization methods capable of providing improved photosensitivities. The present invention provides such a method that enables efficient activation of photoreactive compositions by multiphoton absorption. The method of multiphoton photosensitizing a photoreactive composition comprises the steps of<br>
(a)	providing a multiphoton-activatable, photoreactive composition comprising<br>
(1)	at least one reactive species that is capable of undergoing an acid- or radical-initiated chemical reaction, and	<br>
(2)	a multiphoton photoinitiator system comprising photochemically-effective amounts of<br>
(i)	at least one type of semiconductor nanoparticle that has<br>
at least one electronic excited state that is accessible by absorption of two or more photons, and<br>
(ii)	a composition (preferably, a composition different from<br>
said reactive species) that is capable of interacting with the excited state of the semiconductor nanoparticle to form at least one reaction-initiating species; and<br>
(b)	irradiating the multiphoton-activatable, photoreactive composition with light<br>
sufficient to cause absorption (preferably, simultaneous absorption) of at least two<br>
photons, thereby inducing at least one acid- or radical-initiated chemical reaction where<br>
the composition is exposed to the light.<br>
The method of the invention provides enhanced multiphoton photosensitivity by using semiconductor nanoparticies as multiphoton photosensitizers. The semiconductor nanoparticies interact (for example, through fluorescence up-conversion or charge transfer) with conventional photoinitiator system components to induce chemical reaction through formation of reaction-initiating species (radicals, acid, etc.). Unlike the organic dyes commonly used as multiphoton photosensitizers, the electronic<br><br>
structure (for example, oxidation or reduction potentials and absorption or emission energies) of preferred semiconductor nanoparticles (especially, semiconductor nanoparticle quantum dots) can be matched to that of selected conventional photointiator system components by varying the composition and/or the size of the nanoparticies. Furthermore, the semiconductor nanoparticles have large calculated multiphoton absorption cross-sections and thus can be used to address the need that we have recognized for multiphoton photosensitization methods capable of providing improved photosensitivities.<br>
It\ other aspects, ihis invention also provides a composition prepared by the above-described method and an article comprising the composition.<br>

Reactive Species<br>
Reactive species suitable for use in the photoreactive compositions include both curable and non-curable species. Curable species are generally preferred and include, for example, addition-polymerizable monomers and oligomers and addition-crosslinkable polymers (such as free-radically polymerizable or crosslinkable ethylenically-unsaturated species including, for example, acrylates, methacrylates, and certain vinyl compounds such as styrenes), as well as cationically-polymerizable monomers and oligomers and cationically-crosslinkable polymers (which species are most commonly acid-initialed and which include, for example, epoxies, vinyl ethers, cyanate esters, etc.), and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Suitable ethylenically-unsaturaled species are described, for example, by Palazzotto et al. in U.S. Patent No. 5,545,676 at column !, line 65, through column 2, line 26, and include mono-, di-, and poly-acrylates and methacrylates (for example, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, n-hexyl acrylate, stearyl acrylate, allyl acrylate, glycerol diacrylate, glycerol triacrylate, ethyleneglycoi diacrylate, diethyleneglycol diacrylate, triethyieneglycol dimethacryiate,l,3-propanediol diacrylate, 1,3-propanediol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, 1,2,4-butanetriol trimethacrylate. l,4-cyclohex3nediol diacrylate, pentaerythrito! triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylale, pentaerylhritol tetramethacrylate, sorbitol hexacrylate, bis[l-(2-acryioxy)]-p-ethoxyphenyldimethylmethane, bis[ I -{3-acryloxy-2-hydroxy)]-p-propoxyphenyldimethylmethane, trishydroxyethyl-isocyanurate trimethacrylate, the bis-acrylates and bis-methacrylates of polyethylene glycols ef molecular weight about 200-500, copolymerizable mixtures of acrylated monomers such as those of U.S. Patent No. 4.652,274, and acrylated oligomers such as those of U.S. Patent No. 4,642,126); unsaturated amides (for example, methylene bis-acrylamidc, methylene bis-methacrylamide, 1,6-hexamethylene bis-acrylamide, diethylene triamine tris-acrylamide and beta-methacrylaminoethyl methacrylate); vinyl compounds (for example, styrene, dially! phthalate, divinyl succinate, divinyl adipate, and divinyl phthalate); and the like; and mixtures thereof.

Examples of such polymers include aromatic acid (meth)acrylate half ester resins such as SarboxTMresins available from Sartomer (for example, Sarbox™ 400, 401, 402, 404, and 405). Other useful reactive polymers curable by free radical chemistry include those polymers that have a hydrocarbyl backbone and pendant peptide groups with free-radically polymerizable functionality attached thereto, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,235,015 (Ali et al.). Mixtures of two or more monomers, oligomers, and/or reactive polymers can be used if desired. Preferred ethylenically-unsaturated species include acrylates, aromatic acid (melh)acrylate half ester resins, and polymers that have a hydrocarbyl backbone and pendant peptide groups with free-radically polymerizable functionality attached thereto.<br><br>

Such materials, broadly called epoxides, include monomeric epoxy compounds and epoxides of the polymeric type and can be aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, or heterocyclic- These materials generally have, on the average, at least 1 polymerizable epoxy group per molecule (preferably, at least about 1.5 and, more preferably, at least about 2). The polymeric epoxides include linear polymer.'; having terminal epoxy groups (fof example, a diglycidyl ether of a poiyoxyalkylene glycol), polymers having skeletal oxirane units (for example, polybutadiene polyepoxide), and polymers having pendant epoxy groups (for example, a glycidyl methacrylate polymer or copolymer). The epoxides can be pure compounds or can be mixtures of compounds containing one, two, or more epoxy groups per molecule. These epoxy-containing materials can vary greatly in the nature of their backbone and substituent groups. For example, the backbone can be of any type and substituent groups thereon can be any group that does not substantially interfere with cationic cure at room temperature.  Illustrative of permissible substituent groups include halogens, ester groups, ethers, sulfonate groups, siloxane groups, nitro groups, phosphate groups, and the like. The molecular weight of the epoxy-containing materials can vary from about 58 to about 100,000 or more.<br>

Examples of such copolymers are i:! styrene-glycidylmethacrylate. 1:1 methylmethacrylate-glycidylacrylate, and a 62.5:24:13.5 methylmethacrylate-ethyl acrylate-glycidylmethacrylate.

(preferably, epoxy cyclohexylethyl, as described in U.S. Pateni No. &gt;.753,346 {Kessel)).<br>

Non-curab!e species include, for example, reactive polymers whose solubility can be increased upon acid- or radical-induced reaction. Such reactive polymers include, for example, aqueous insoluble polymers bearing ester groups that can be converted by photogenerated acid to aqueous soluble acid groups (for example, poly(4-fer/-butoxycarbonyloxystyrene). Non-curable species also include the chemically-amplified photoresists described by R. D. Allen. G. M. Wallraff. W. D. Hinsberg, and L. L. Simpson in "High Performance Acrylic Polymers for Chemically Amplified<br><br>
Photoresist Applications," J. Vac. Sci. Techno!. B, 9, 3357 (199i). The chemically-amplified photoresist concept is now widely used for microchip manufacturing, especially with sub-0.5 micron (or even sub'0.2 micron) features.  In such photoresist systems, catalytic species (typically hydrogen ions) can be generated by irradiation, which induces a cascade of chemical reactions. This cascade occurs when hydrogen ions initiate reactions that generate more hydrogen ions or other acidic species, thereby amplifying reaction rate. Examples of typical acid-catalyzed chemically-amplified photoresist systems include deprotection (for example, t-butoxycarbonyloxystyrene resists as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,491,62S. tetrahydropyran (THP) methacrylate-based materials, THP-phenolic materials such as those described in L.S- Patent No. 3,779,778, t-butyl melhacrylate-based materials such as those described by R. D Allen el al. in Proc. SPIE2438. 474(1995), and the like); depolymcrization (for example, polyphthalaldehyde-based materials); and rearrangement (for example, materials based -on the pinacol rearrangements).<br>
Useful non-curable species also include leuco dyes, which tend to be colorless until they are oxidized by acid generated by the multiphoton photoinitiator system, and which, once oxidized, exhibit a visible color. (Oxidized dyes are colored by virtue of their absorbance of light in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (approximately 400-700 nm).) Leuco dyes useful in the present invention are those that are reactive or oxidizable under moderate oxidizing conditions and yet thai are not so reactive as to oxidize under common environmental conditions. There are many such chemical classes of leuco dyes known to the imaging chemist.<br>
Leuco dyes useful as reactive species in the present invention include acrylated leuco azine, phenoxazine, and phenothiazine, which can, in part, be represented by the structural formula:<br><br><br>
wherein X is selecied from O, S, and -N-R". with S being preferred: R1 and R2 are independently selected from H and all<y groups of to about carbon atoms r3. r4 r5 and r6 are independently selected from h alky i preferably methyl is alkyl alkoxy aryl up r8 wherein r1 r defined as above r3 r10 fl r14 phenyl the following compounds examples this type leuco dye:></y><br><br><br><br>

Other materials such as binders. pLsticizers. stabilizers, surfactants, antistatic agents, coating aids, lubricants, fillers, and the like can also be present in the light sensitive layer.<br>
If desired, mixtures of different types of reactive species can be utilized in the photoreactive compositions. For example, mixtures of free-radically-reactive species and cationically-reactive species, mixtures of curable species and non-curable species, and so forth, are also useful.<br>
Semiconductor Nanoparticles<br>
Semiconductor nanoparticles that can be used as muitiphoton photosensitizers in the compositions of the invention include those that have at least one electronic excited state that is accessible by absorption (preferably, simultaneous absorption) of two or more photons. Preferably, the nanoparticles are substantially soluble (thus, substantially non-agglomerated) in the reactive species. Preferred nanoparticles generally exhibit soiubiVuy in the reactive species that is greater than about i .0 percent by weight (preferably, greater than about 2.0 percent; more preferably, greater than about 5.0 percent), based upon the total weight of all components of the photoreactive composition. The nanoparticles are preferably sufficiently soluble in the reactive species that the photoreactive composition is optically clear when viewed by the human eye.<br>
Suitable nanoparticles generally range in average diameter between about 1 nm and about 300 nm. Preferably, the nanoparticles have an average diameter of at least about 1.5 nm; more preferably, at least about 2 nm. The nanoparticles are preferably no greater than about 50 nm in average diameter; more preferably, no greater than about 10 nm. Nanoparticles having a fairly narrow size distribution are preferred in order to avoid competitive one-photon absorption.<br>
The nanoparticles can comprise one or more semiconductor materials.  L'seful semiconductor materials include, for example, Group II-VI semiconductors (for example. ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, HgS, HgSe, HgTe, MgTe. and the like). Group III-V<br><br>
semiconductors (for example, GaN. GaP. GaAs, GaSb, InN, InP, InAs, InSb, AIAs, AiP, AlSb. A!S, and the like). Group IV semiconductors (for example, Ge, Si„ and the like). Group I-VII semiconductors (for example. CuCl and the like), alloys thereof, and mixtures thereof (for example, ternary and quaternary mixtures). Preferred semiconductor nanopanicles comprise a Group IV or a Group II-VI semiconductor (more preferably, a Group [I-V[ semiconductor; most preferably, a Group II-VI semiconductor comprising zinc or cadmium).<br>
Useful semiconductor nanoparticles Include preferred nanocrystals called quantum dots, which preferably have radii less than or equal to the bulk exciton Bohr radius of the semiconductor and constitute a class of materials intermediate between molecular and bulk forms of matter. In quantum dots, quantum confinement of both electron and hole in all three dimensions leads to an increase in the effective band gap of the semiconductor with decreasing particle .size. Consequently, both the absorption edge and the emission wavelength of the particles shift to higher energies (with a corresponding decrease in electron affinity and increase in ionization potential) as the particle size gets smaller. This effect can be used to adjust the effective oxidation and reduction potentials of the particle (see, for example, Brus, J. Phys- Chem., 79:5566 (1983)) and to tune the panicle's emission wavelengths to match the absorption bands of other components of the photoinitiator system.<br>
Particularly preferred semiconductor nanoparticles comprise a "core" of one or more first semiconductor materials surrounded by a "shell" of a second semiconductor material (hereinafter, "core/shell" semiconductor nanoparticles). The surrounding shell material can be chosen to have an atomic spacing close to that of the core material. When enhanced luminescence is desired, the band gaps and band offsets of the core/shell pair can be chosen so that it is energetically favorable for both electron and hole to reside in the core. When enhanced probability of charge separation of the electron-hole pair is desired, the band gaps and band offsets of the core/shell pair can be chosen so that it is energetically favorable for the electron to reside in the shell and the hole to reside in the core, or vice versa.<br>
Preferably, at least a portion of the surface o£ the nanoparticles is modified so as to aid in the compatibility and dispersibility or solubility of the nanoparticles in the reactive species. This surface modification can be effected by various different methods that are<br><br>
known in the an. (See. for example, the surface modification techniques described by Bruchezetai. in Science 281, 2013 (1998) and by Weiss et al. in U.S. Patent No. 5.990,479.<br>
In general, suitable surface treatment agents comprise at least one moiety that is selected to provide solubility in the reactive species (a solubilizing or stabilizing moiety) and at least one moiety that has an affinity for the semiconductor surface (a linking moiety). Suitable linking moieties include those that comprise at least one electron pair that is available for interaction with the semiconductor surface (for example, moieties comprising oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, or phosphorus). Examples of surface treatment agents comprising such linking moieties include amines, thiols, phosphines. amine oxides, phosphine oxides, and the like. Such linking moieties attach to the semiconductor surface primarily through coordinate bonding of the lone electron pairs of the nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, or phosphorus atom of the linking group.  However, surface treatment agents comprising linking moieties that can attach to the surface of the nanoparticles through other types of chemical bonding (for example, covalent bonding or ionic bonding) or through physical interaction can also be used, as stated above.<br>
Surface treatment agent(s) are preferably used in an amount such that at least a portion of the surface of the nanoparticles is modified sufficiently to render the nanoparticles substantially soluble in the reactive species. The resulting semiconductor nanoparticles have surface-attached or surface-bonded organic groups.<br>
Surface modification through reaction of surface atoms of the nanoparticles with organic passivating ligands not only enhances the solubility of the nanoparticles in the reactive species but also further serves to eliminate energy levels at the surface of the nanoparticle that lie within the energetically forbidden gap of the core. These surface energy states act as Uaps for electrons and holes that can degrade the luminescence properties of the semiconductor material.<br>
Semiconductor nanoparticles (for example, monoelement semiconductors such as silicon or germanium and compound semiconductors such as GaAs. [nP, CdSe, or ZnS) can be synthesized using a wet chemical process based on standard colloidal chemistry. The general synthesis involves the rapid addition (for example, by injection) of molecular precursors of the semiconductor (for example, Cd(CH.!):) and (TMS)2Se for CdSe) into a hot coordinating solvent (for example, an amine or phosphine) that can serve to control<br><br>
growth and prevent aggregation of the nanoparticles (see, for example, Murray el al., J. Am. Chem. Soc.llS: 8706 (1993)). In view of the highly reactive nature of the precursors and/or to prevent or minimize oxidation of the growing nanoparticles, the synthesis is genevally carried out in an inert atmosphere (for example, a nitrogen atmosphere).<br>
An initially high concentration of precursors in solution generally results in the<br>
formation of monodisperse seed nuclei of the semiconductor. As the precursor<br>
concentration drops below the nucleation threshold, the nanoparticles grow by deposition<br>
of remnant material onto the surface. As the precursors are depleted from solution, further<br>
growth can be achieved by Ostwald ripening (larger nanoparticles grow while the smaller<br>
nanoparticles dissolve; this can be expedited by increasing the temperature) or by further<br>
addition of molecular precursors (see, for example, Peng et al., J. Am Chem. Soc.<br>
120'.5343 (1998)). Nanoparticlesof a particular size can be obtained by stopping the<br>
growth process by discontinuing the addition of heat.	-   ■<br>
The resulting nanoparticles can be isolated and purified by precipitation using a non-solvent. The nanoparticles can then be re-dispersed in a variety of solvents and matrices (for example, polymers), depending upon the type of surface treatment agent (if any) u.sed in the synthesis. When a surface treatment agent has been utilized, the resulting surface-attached or surface-bonded groups can be partially or fully replaced with different groups, if desired, by introducing the semiconductor nanoparticles into a medium containing a different surface treatment agent (for example, a neat liquid surface treatment agent or a concentrated surface treatment agent solution).<br>
Core/shell nanoparticles can be synthesized, for example, by following general methods developed by Hines et al. {/ Phys. Chem. 100:468 (1996)) and Dabbousi et. al. {J. Phys. Chem B 101:9463 (1997)). Growth of core/shell nanoparticles can be accomplished by introducing semiconductor nanoparticle cores (comprising a first semiconductor material) and precursors capable of thermal conversion into a second semiconductor material into a coordinating solvent. The coordinating solvent can be maintained at a temperature sufficient to convert the precursors into the second semiconductor material, yet insufficient to cause significant growth of the semiconductor nanoparticle cores, A shell of the second semiconductor material generally forms on the cores of the first semiconductor material. The thickness of the shell can be controlled by adjusting the quantity of precursors capable of thermal conversion into the second<br><br>
semiconductor material. Particles passivaieJ with such an inorganic shell are generally somewhai more robust than organically-passivatcd particles and generally have somewhat greater tolerance to the processing conditions used for their incorporation into various media (such as the reactive species used in the photoreactive composition).<br>

Other Components of Photoinitiator System<br>
The composition that is capable of interacting with the semiconductor nanoparticles to form at least one reaction-initiating species can be a one-component, a [wo-component, or a three-component system. One suitable one-component system comprises a photochemically effective amount of at least one one-photon photoinitiator that has an electronic absorption band that overlaps with an up-converted electronic emission band of the semiconductor nanoparticle (that is, a compound that is capable of absorbing the light emitted by the semiconductor nanoparticle and generatmg a reaction-initiating species). Exainples of such compounds include free radical phoioinitiators that generate a free radical source and cationic photoinitiators that generate an acid (including either protic or Lewis acids) when exposed to radiation having a wavelength in the ultraviolet or visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
Useful free-radical photoinitiators include acetophenones, benzophenones, ar\l glyoxaknes, acylphosphine oxides, benzoin ethers, benzil ketals. thioxanthone-,.<br><br>
chloraalkyltriazines. bisimidazoles, triacyliciiidazoles. pyryllum cor,\poutids. sulfonium and iodonium salts, mercapto compond-S, qiiinones, azo compounds, organic peroxides, and mixtures thereof. Examples of such photoinitiators are described, for example, in U.S. Pal, Nos, 4,735,632 (see column 3, line 26-47). and 6.054,007 (see column 16. line 58, through column 17, line 7).<br>
Useful cationic photo initiators include mctailoecne .salts hav :ng an onium cation and a halogen-containing complex anion of a metal or metalloid. Other useful cationic photoinitiators include iodonium salts and sulfonium salts, as well as meiallocene salts having an organometallic complex cation and a halogen-containing complex anion of a metal or metalloid fas further described, for example, in U.S. Pal. Nos. 4,751.138 (see, for example, column 6, line 65, through column 9, line 45) and 5,238,744 (see column 10, Ime 12, through column 1!, line 3. Mixtures of photoinitiators are also useful.<br>
Such free-radical photoinitiators and cationic photoinitiators and methods for their preparation are known in the art. Many are commercially available.<br>
Other suitable one-component systems comprise an electron donor compound or, alternatively, an electron acceptor compound. One suitable two-component system comprises both an electron donor compound and an electron acceptor compound.<br>
Other useful two-componenl and three-component systems comprise photochemically effective amounts of (1) at least one one-photon photosensitizer having an electronic absorption band that overlaps with an up-converted electronic emission band of the semiconductor nanoparliclc; and (2) either or both of (i) at least one electron donor compound different from the one-photon photosensitizer and capable of donating an electron to an electronic excited state of the one-photon photosensitizer (preferably, an electron donor compound having an oxidation potemiaS that is greater than zero and less than or equal to that of p-dimethoxybenzene); and (ii) at least one photoinitiator or electron acceptor compound that is capable of being photosensitized by accepting an electron from an electronic excited state of the one-photon photosensitizer, resulting in the formation of at least one free radical and/or acid (preferably, a photoinitiator selected from the group consisting of iodonium salts, sulfonium salts, diazonium salts, azinium salts, chloromethylated triazines, and triarylimidazolyl dimcrs).<br><br>
(It One-Photon Photosensitizers<br>
One-photon photosensitizers suitable for use in the photoiniliator system of the<br>
photoreactive compositions are those having at least one electronic absorption band that<br>
overlaps with at least one up-converted electronic emission band of the semiconductor<br>
nanopanicle. Thus, the selection of a one-photon photosensilizer will depend to some<br>
extent upon the particular type of semiconductor nanoparticle that is utilized. The spectral<br>
overlap of the nanoparticle emission and the photosensitizer absorption can be fine-tuned<br>
by adjusting the size of the nanoparticle,  Mowever, the one-photon photosensitizer is<br>
preferably capable of light absorption somevvhcre within the range of wavelengths<br>
between about 250 and about 800 nanometers (more preferably, between about 350 and<br>
about 700 nanometers; and, most preferably, between about 350 and about 600<br>
nanometers), as preferred semiconductor nanoparticles generally emit light of such<br>
wavelengths.	.   .<br>
Preferably, the one-photon photosensitizer is substantially free of functionalities that would substantially interfere with the reaction of the reactive species, is soluble in the reactive species (if the reactive species is liquid) or is compatible with the reactive species and with any binders (as described below) that are included in the composition, and has a large one-photon absorption coefficient (greater than about 100 M ' cm" ) at the emission maximum of the semiconductor nanoparticle.  It is also preferred that the one-photon photosensitizer have substantially no one-photon absoiption at the wavelength of irradiation. Most preferably, the one-photon photosensitizer is also capable of sensitizing 2-methyl-4,6-bis(trichloromethyl)-s-triazine under continuous irradiation in a wavelength range that overlaps the single photon absorption spectrum of the one-photon photosensitizer (single photon absorption conditions), using the test procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,729.3!3. Using currently available materials, that test can be carried out as follows:<br>
A standard test solution can be prepared having the following composition: 5,0 parts of a 5% (weight by volume) solution in methanol of 45,000-55,000 molecular weight. 9.0-13-0% hydroxy! content polyvinyl butyral (Butvar™ B76, Monsanto); 0.3 parts trimethyloipropane trimethacrylate; and 0,03 parts 2-rncthyl-4,6-bis(trichloromethyb-s-triazine (see Bull, Chem. Soc. Japan, 42, 2924-2930 (1969)).<br><br>
To [his solution can be added 0.01 parts of the compound lo be tested as a photosensitizer. The resulting solution can then be knife-coated onto a 0.05 mm clear polyester film using a knife orifice of 0.05 mm, and the coating can be air dried for about 30 minutes. A 0.05 mm clear polyester cover film can be carefully placed over the dried but soft and tacky coating with minimum entrapment of air. The resulting sandwich construction can then be exposed for three minutes to 161.000 Lu.x of incident light from a tungsten light source providing light in both the visible and ultraviolet range (FCH™ 650 watt quartz-iodine hmp. General Electric}. Exposure can be made ihrough a stencil so as lo provide exposed and unexposed a.reas in Ihe construction. After exposure the cover film can be removed, and the coating can be treated with a finely divided colored powder, such as a color toner powder of the type conventionally used in xerography.  If the tested compound is a photosensitizer, the trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate monomer will be polymerized in the light-exposed areas by the light-generated free radicals from the 2-methyl-4,6-bisitrichloromethy!)-s-triazine. Since the polymerized areas will be essentially tack-free, the colored powder will selectively adhere essentially only to the tacky, unexposed areas of the coating, providing a visual image corresponding to that in the stencil.<br>
Preferably, a one-photon photosensitizer can also be selected based in part upon shelf stability considerations. Accordingly, selection of a particular photosensitizer can depend to some extent upon [he particular reactive species utilized {as well as upon the choices of electron donor compound and/or photoinitiator).<br>
Suitable one-photon photoscnsitizers are believed to include compounds in the followmg categories: ketones, coumarin dyes (for example, ketocoumarins), xanthene dyes, acridine dyes, thiazole dyes, ihiazine dyes, oxazine dyes, azine dyes, aminoketone dyes, porphyrins, aromatic poiycyclic hydrocarbons, p-substituted aminostyryl ketone compounds, aminoiriaryl methanes, merocyanines, squarylium dyes, cyanine dyes, and pyridinium dyes. Xanthene dyes, cyanine dyes, ketones (for example, monoketones or alpha-diketones), ketocoumarins, aminoarylketoncs, and p-subsiituted ammostyryl ketone compounds are preferred one-photon photosensitizers. Mixtures of photosensitizers can also be utilized.- For applications requirmg high sensitivity, it is generally preferred to employ a one-photon photosensitizer containing a julolidinyl moiety.<br><br>
A preferred class of ketone photoscnsitizers comprises those represented by the followine general formula:<br><br>
where X is CO or CR'R", where R' and R"^ can be the same or different and can be hydrogen, alkyl, alkaryl, or aralkyl; b is zero; and A and B can be the: same or different and can be substituted (having one or more non-interfering substicuents) or unsubstimted aryl, alky!, alkaryl, or aralkyl groups, or together A and B can form a cyclic structure that can be a substituted or unsubstituted alicyclic. aromatic, heteroaromatic, or fused aromatic ring.<br>

(2) Electron Donor Compounds<br>
Electron donor compounds useful in the photoinitiator system of the pholoreactive compositions are those compounds (other than the one-photon photosensitizer itself) that are capable of donating an electron to an electronic excited state of the one-photon photosensitizer or to an electronic excited state of the semiconductor nanoparticle. Such compounds may be used, optionally, to provide increased multiphoton photosensitivity, thereby reducing the exposure required to effect photoreaclion of Ihe pholoreactive composition. The electron donor compounds preferably have an oxidation potential that is greater than zero and less than or equal to<br><br>
that of p-dimethoxybenzene. Preferably, the oxidation potential is between about 0.3 and 2 volts vs. a standard saturated calomel electrode ("S.C.E.").<br>
The electron donor compound is also preferably soluble in the reactive species and is selected based in part upon shell stability considerations (as described above). Suitable donors are generally capable of increasing the speed of cure or the image density of a photoreactive composition upon exposure to light of the desired wavelength and preferably do not catalyze undesirable side reactions with the semiconductor particles.<br>
When working with cationically-reactive species, those skilled in the art will recognize that the electron donor compound, ifof significant basicitv, can adversely affect the cationic reaction, (See, for example, the discussion in U.S. Patent No, 6,025,406 (Oxman el al.) at column 7, line 62, through column 8, line 49.) This caveat can also apply to the choice of semiconductor particle and/or surface treatment agent.<br>
In general, electron donor compounds suitable for use with particular one-photon photosensitizers, semiconductor nanoparticles, and photoinitiators can be selected by comparing the oxidation and reduction potentials of the three components (as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,859,572 (Farid et al.)). Such potentials can be measured experimentally (for example, by the methods described by R, J. Cox. Photographic Sensitivitv. Chapter 15, Acadeinic Press (1973)) or can be obtained from references such as N. L. Wemburg, Ed.. Technique of Electroorganic Synthesis Part 11 Techniques of Chemistry. Vol. V (1975), and C. K. Mann and K. K- Barnes, Electrochemical Reactions in Nonaqueous System.s (1970). The potentials reflect relative energy relationships and can be used in the following manner to guide electron donor compound selection;<br>
When the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle is in an electronic excited state, an electron in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle has been lifted to a higher energy level (namely, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle), and a vacancy is leU behind in the molecular orbital it initially occupied. The photoinitiator can accept the electron from the higher energy orbital, and the electron donor compound can donate an<br><br>
electron to fill the vacancy in the originally occupied orbital, provided that certain relative energy relationships are satisfied-<br>
If the reduction potential of the photoinitiator is less negative (or more positive) than that of the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle, an electron in the higher energy orbital of the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle is readily transferred from the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the phoioinitiator, since this represents an exothermic process. Even il the process is instead slightly endothermic {that is. even if the reduction potential of the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle is up to 0.1 volt more negati\e than thai of the photoiniiiator) ambient thermal activation can readily o\ercome such a small barrier.<br>
In an analogous manner, if the oxidation potential of the electron donor compound is less positive (or more negative) than that of the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle, an electron moving from the HOMO of the electron donor compound to the orbital vacancy in the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle is moving from a higher to a lower potential, which again represents an exothermic process. Even if the process is slightly endothermic (that is, even if the oxidation potential of the one-pholon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle is up to 0.1 volt more positive than that of the electron donor compound), ambient thermal activation can readily overcome such a small barrier.<br>
Slightly endothermic reactions in which the reduction potential of the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor t^anoparticle is up to O.l vok more negative than that of the photoiniiiator, or the oxidation potential of the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle is up to 0.1 volt more positive than that of the electron donor compound, occur in every instance, regardless of whether the photoinitiator or the electron donor compound first reacts with the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle in its excited state. When the photoinitiator or the electron donor compound is reacting with the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle in its excited state, it is preferred that the reaction be exothermic or only slightly endothermic. When the photoinitiator or the<br><br>
eleciron donor compound is reacting with the one-photon photoiensitizer ion radical, exothermic reactions are still preferred, but still more endothfermic reactions can be expected in many instances to occur. Thus, the reduction potential of the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle can be up to 0.2 voh (or more) more negative than that of a second-to-rcact photoinitiaior. or the oxidation potential of the one-photon photosensitizer or semiconductor nanoparticle can be up to 0.2 volt (or more) more positive than that of a .second-to-re act electron donor compound.<br>

The phoioinitiator is preferably soluble in the reactive species and is preferably shelf-stable (that is, does not spontaneously promote reaction of the reactive species when dissolved therein in the presence of the photosensitizers and the electron donor compound). Accordingly, selection of a particular photoinitiator can depend to some extent upon the panicular reactive species, semiconductor nanoparticle. photosensilizer, and electron donor compound chosen, as described above. If the reactive species is capable of undergoing an acid-initialed chemical reaction, then the photoinitiator is an onium salt (for example, an iodonium, sulfonium, or diazonium salt).<br>

Useful azinium salts include those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,859,572 (Farid et al.) at column 8, line 51, through column 9, line 46, which include an azinium moiety, such as a pyridinium, diazinium, or ir!a2inium moiety. The azinium moiety can include one or more aromatic rings, typically carbocyclic aromatic rings (for example, quinolinium, isoquinolinium, benzodiazinium, and naphthodiazonium moieties), fused with an azinium ring. A quatemizing substituent of a nitrogen atom m the azinium ring can be released as a free radical upon electron transfer from the electronic excited state of the one-photon photosensitizer to the azinium photoinitiator. In one preferred form, the quaternizing substituent is an oxy substituent. The oxy substituent, -0-T, which quaternizes a ring nitrogen atom of the azinium moiety can be selected from among a variety of synthetically convenient oxy substituents. The moiety T can, for example, be an alkyl radical, such as methyl, ethyl, butyl, and so forth. The alkyl radical can be substituted. For example, aralkyl (for example, benzyl and phenethyl) and sulfoalkyl (for example, sulfomethyl) radicals can be useful-   In another form, T can be an acyl radical, such as an -0C(0)-T' radical, where T' can be any of the various alkyl and aralkyl radicals described above. In addition, T' can be an aryl radical, such as phenyl or naphthyl. The aryl radical can in turn be substituted. For example, T' can be a tolyl or xytyl radical. T typically contains from 1 to about 18 carbon atoms, with alky! moieties in each instance above preferably being lower alkyl moieties and aryl moieties in each instance preferably containing about 6 to about 10 carbon atoms. Highest activity levels have been realized when the oxy substituent, -O-T, contains 1 or 2 carbon atoms. The azinium nuclei need include no substituent other<br><br>

More preferred are aryliodonium salts, chloromethylated iriazines, and the 2,4.5-triphenylimidazolyI dimers (with aryliodonium sails and the triazines being most preferred).<br>
If desired, the photoinitialor, the one-photon photosensitizer, the electron acceptor, and/or the electron donor can be physically or chemically attached (preferably, chemically bonded) to the surface of the semiconductor nanoparticle to enhance the probability of generating a reaction-initiating species. Such attachment can be effected through the use of a tethering agent comprising a linking moiety that does not significantly affect the electronic structure of the photoJnitiator. the one-photon photosensitizer, the electron acceptor, the electron donor, and/or the semiconductor nanoparticle. Preferably, the tethering agent comprises at least one tctracoordinate carbon atom. Examples of useful tethering agents include the above-described surface treatment agents and the like, as well as the tethering agents described in U.S. Patent No. 4,954,416(Wrighte[al.).<br>
Preparation of Photoreactive Composition<br>
The reactive species, semiconductor nanoparticles. one-photon photosensitizers, electron donor compounds, and photoiniliators (or electron acceptor compounds) can be prepared by the methods described above or by other methods known in Ihe art, and many are commercially available. These components can be combined under "safe 1-ight" conditions using any order and manner of combination (optionally, with stirring or agitation), although it is sometimes preferable (from a shelf life and thermal stability standpoint) to add the photoinitiator last (and after any heating step that is optionally<br><br>
used to faciliiate dissolution of other components). It can also be preferable to first add the semiconductor nanoparticles to the highest viscosity components of the photoreactive composition in which the nanoparticles are most soluble, to mix the resulting combination until the nanoparticles arc completely dispersed, and then to add the remaining components. Solvent can be used, if desired, provided that the solvent is chosen so as to not react appreciably with the components of the composition. Suitable soKents include, for example, acetone, dichloromethane, and acetonitrile. The reactive species itself can also sometimes serve as a solvent for the other components.<br>
The components of the photoinitiator system are present in photochemically effective amounts (as defined above). Generally, the photoreactive composition can contain at least about 5% (preferably, at least about 10%; more preferably, at least about 20%) up to about 99.79% by weight of one or more reactive species; at least about 0.01% (preferably, at least about 0.1%; more preferably, at least about 0.2%) up to about 10% (preferably, up to about 5%; more preferably, up to about 2%) by weight of semiconductor nanoparticles; and at least about 0.1% (preferably, at least about 0.2%: more preferably, at least about 0.3%) up to about 15% (preferably, up to about 10%: more preferably, up to about 5%) of the composition that is capable of interacting with the semiconductor nanoparticles to form at least one reaction-initiating species.<br>
When the interacting composition includes a one-photon photosensitizer, the photoreactive composition can generally contain at least about 0.01 % (preferably, at least about 0.1 %; more preferably, at least about 0.2%) up to about 10% (preferably, up to about 5%; more preferably, up to about 2%) by weight of one or more of the one-photon phoiosensiiizers; and either or both of (i) up to about \0% (preferably, up to about 5%) by weight of one or more electron donor compounds (preferably, at least about 0.1%; more preferably, from about 0.1% to about 5%) and (ii) from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight of one or more electron acceptor compounds (preferably, from about 0.1% to about 5%).<br>
When the interacting composition does not include a one-photon photosensitizer, the photoreactive composition can generally contain either or both of (i) from about 0.01% (preferably, at least about 0.1%; more preferabjy..at least about 0.2%) up to about 10% (preferably, up to about 5%) by weight of one or more electron donor compounds and (ii) from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight of ore or more<br><br>
electron acceptor compounds (preferably, from about 0,1 % to about 5%); or, alternatively, the photoreactive composition can contain from about 0.01% {preferably, at least about 0.1%; more preferably, at least about 0.2%) up to about 10% (preferably, up to about 5%) by weight of one or more photoinitiator compounds. When the reactive species is a leuco dye, the composiuon generally can contain from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of one or more reactive species (preferably, from about 0.3% to about 10%; more preferably, from about 1% to about 10%: most preferably, from about 2% to about 10%). The above-cited percentages are based upon the total weight of solids (that is, the total weight of components other than solvent).<br>
A wide variety of adjuvants can be included in the photoreactive compositions, depending upon the desired end use. Suitable adjuvants include solvents, diluents, resins, binders, piasticizers, pigments, dyes, inorganic or organic reinforcing or extending filters (at preferred amounts of about 10% to 90% by weight based on the total weight of the composition), thixotropic agents, indicators, inhibitors, stabilizers, ultraviolet absorbers, medicaments (for example, leachable fluorides), and the like. The amounts and types of such adjuvants and their manner of addition to the compositions will be familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
It is within the scope of this invention to include nonreactive polymeric binders in the compositions in order, for example, to control viscosity and to provide film-forming propenies. Such polymeric binders can generally be chosen to be compatible with the reactive species. For example, polymeric binders that are soluble in the same solvent that is used for the reactive species, and that are free of functional groups that can adversely affect the course of reaction of the reactive species, can be utilized. Binders can be of a molecular weight suitable to achieve desired film-forming properties and solution rheology (for example, molecular weights between about 5,000 and 1,000,000 daltons; preferably between about 10,000 and 500,000 daltons; more preferably, between about 15,000 and 250,000 daltons). Suitable polymeric binders include, for example, polystyrene, poly(methyI methacrylale), poly(styrene)-co-(acrylonitrile), cellulose acetate butyrate, and the like.<br>
Prior Lo exposure, the resulting photoreactive compositions can be coated on a substrate, if desired, by any of a variety of coating methods known to those skilled in the art (including, for example, knife coaling and spin coaling). The substrate can be<br><br>
chosen from a wide variety of films, sheets, and other surfaces, depending upon the particular application and the method of exposure to be utilized. Preferred substrates are generally sufficiently flat to enable the preparation of a layer of photoreactive composition having a uniform thickness. For applications where coating is less desirable, the photoreactive compositions can alternatively be exposed in bulk form.<br>
Exposure System and Its Use<br>
Useful exposure systems include at least one light source and at least one optical element. Any light source that provides sufficient intensity (to effect multiphoton absorption} at a wavelength appropriate for the selected semiconductor nanoparticles (for example, a wavelength that is matched with a long-wave length visible or near-infrared absorption band of the nanoparlicle) can be utilized. Such wavelengths can generally be in the range of about 500 to about 1700 nm; preferably, from about 600 to about 1100 nm; more preferably, from about 750 to about 1000 nm. Illumination can be continuous or pulsed or a combination thereof.<br>
Suitable light sources include, for example, femtosecond near-infrared titanium sapphire oscillators (for example, a Coherent Mira Optima 900-F) pumped by an argon ion laser (for example, a Coherent Innova). This laser, operating at 76 MHz, has a pulse width of less than 200 femtoseconds, is tunable between 700 and 980 nm, and has average power up to 1.4 Watts. Q-switched Nd: YAG lasers (for example, a Spectra-Physics Quanta-Ray PRO), visible wavelength dye lasers (for example, a Spectra-Physics Sirah pumped by a Spectra-Physics Quanta-Ray PRO), and Q-switched diode<br>
pumped la.sers (for example, a Spectra-Physics	) can also be utilized. Peak<br>
intensities generally are at least about 10^ W/cm2 The upper limit of the pulse fluence is generally dictated by the ablation threshold of the photoreactive composition.<br>
Preferred light sources include near-infrared pulsed lasers having a pulse length less than about 106 second (more preferably, less than about 109 second; most preferably, less than about 10"" second). Other pulse lengths can be used provided that the above-detailed peak intensity and pulse fiuence criteria are met.<br>
Optical elements useful in carrying out the method of the invention include refractive optical elements (for example, lenses and prisms), reflective optical elements (for example, reiroreflectors or focusing mirrors), diffractive optical elements (for<br><br>
example, gratings, phase masks, and holograms), polarizing optical elements (for example, linear polarizers and waveplates), diffusers, Pockels cells, waveguides, waveplates, and birefringenl liquid crystals, and the like. Such optical elements are useful for focusing, beam delivery, beam/mode shaping, pulse shaping, and pulse timing. Generally, combinations of optical elements can be utilized, and other appropriate combinations will be recognized by those skilled in the art. It is often desirable to use optics with large numerical aperture to provide highly-focused light. However, any combination of optical elements that provides a desired intensity profile (and spatial placement thereof) can be utilized. For example, the exposure system can include a scanning confocal microscope (BioRad MRC600) equipped with a 0.75 NA objective {Zeiss 20X Fluar).<br>
Generally, exposure of the photoreactive composition can be carried out using a light source (as described above) along with an optical system as a means for controlling the three-dimensional spatial distribution of light intensity within the composition. For example, the light from a continuous wave or pulsed laser can be passed through a focusing lens in a manner such that the focal point is within the volume of the composition. The focal point can be scanned or translated in a three-dimensional pattern that corresponds to a desired shape, thereby creating a three-dimensional image of the desired shape. The exposed or illuaiunated-ypIumer of .the composition can be scanned either by moving the composition itself or by moving the light source (for example, moving a laser beam using gaIvo minors). The resulting ^ exposed composition can be subjected to a post-exposure hie^ifeatirient, if desired.<br>
If the light induces, for example, a reaction of the reactive species that produces<br>
a material having solubility characteristics different from:those bf-the reactive species,<br>
the resulting image can optionally be developed by removing either the exposed or the<br>
unexposed regions through use of an appropriate solvent, for example, or by other art-<br>
known means. Cured, complex, three-dimensional objects can be prepared in this<br>
manner.	;,■   v    ',   .  -,      '    ;  ..   ,<br>
Exposure times generally depend upon the type of exposure system used to cause image formation (and its accompanying variables sucli^aiumerical^perlijre,. geometry of light intensity spatial distribution, the peak light intensity during, for = example, the laser pulse (higher intensity and shorter puI^'jiiljr^9nropgftlycorres|^<br><br>
to peak light intensity)), as well as upon the nature of the composition exposed (and its concentrations of photosensttizer(s), photoinitiator, and electron donor compound). Generally, higher peak light intensity in the regions of focus allows shorter exposure times, everything else being equal. Linear imaging or "writing" speeds generally can be about 5 to 100,000 microns/second using a continuous wave laser or using a pulsed laser with a laser pulse duration of about 10' lo 10"   second (preferably, about 10"' to 1014 second) and about 10" to 109 pulses per second (preferably, about 103 to 108 pulses per second).<br>

Stock Solution A was then used lo prepare three photoreactive compositions as follows:<br>
COMPOSITION B<br>
1.5 mL of a 0.05 M solution of the CdSe nanoparticles in toluene was added to 0.433 g of po!y(vinyl butyrai) in 0.5 mL of toluene and allowed to stir for 20 minutes until the nanoparticles were completed dispersed. 0.461 g of Stock Solution A was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 5 minutes.<br>

The coated slides were exposed using a diod e pumped Tiisapphire laser (Spectra-Physics) operating at a wavelength of 800 nm, pulse width 80 fs, pulse repetition rate of 80 MHz, beam diameter of approximately 2 mm. The optical train consisted of low dispersion turning mirrors, an optical attenuator to vary the optical power, and a 60X microscope objective (N.A. 0.85) to focus the light. Each coated slide was exposed to the light by cominuously moving the slide beneath the microscope objective. The focal point of the light beam was positioned to coincide with the slide/coating interface. The average power delivered to the coated slide {22 mW) was measured where the beam exited the microscope objective using a calibrated photodiode. Each slide was moved underneath the focused beam using a computer controlled, 3-axis stage.<br>
To test the photosensitivity of each photoreactive composition, a series of polymer lines were created by scanning each coated slide under the focused beam at speeds ranging from 77 iim^s to 40 mmls. Following exposure, unreacted resin was removed by solvent development in propylene glycol methyl ether acetate, and the slides were then rinsed with isopropyl alcohol and air dried. Each slide was then examined under an optical microscope, and a threshold writing speed was determined from the number of polymer lines remaining on the slide.   Table 2 summarizes the results.

The hexadecylamine was then heated to 310 °C under 1 atm. of nitrogen. 0.41 mL (4 mmol) of diethyl zinc (Aldrich Chemical Company) was mixed with 20 mL trioctylphosphine (Fluka Chemicals, Steinheim, Germany) and 5 mL of 1 M trioctylphosphine selenide in trioctylphosphine. The resulting solution was then rapidly injected into the vigorously stirred hexadecylamine at 310 °C. The temperature of the resulting solution was reduced to 280 °C. After 2 hours, diethyl zinc (Aldrich, 0.35 mL, 3 mmol) was mixed with 12 mL trioctylphosphine and 5 mL of 1 M trioctylphosphine selenide in trioctylphosphine and added dropwise to the solution over eight minutes.

A stock solution of 1.0 wt % CDi012, 4.3 wt % tetahydrofuran {Burdick &amp; Jackson. Muskegon, MI) 47,3 wt % lauryl acrylate (SR335), 23.7 wt % tris(2-hydroxyethyl) isocyanurate iriacrylate (SR368), and 23.7 wt % alkoxylated trifunctional acrylate ester (SR 9008) (all three acrylates available from Sanomer Co., West Chester, PA) was prepared in an amber vial and allowed to stir for 20 minutes until the CDI012 was completed dissolved.   A 0. i g al iquot of this stock solution was then placed in another amber via!. 0.02 mL of the above-described solution of ZnS-overcoated ZnSe nanoparticles in toluene was added to the stock solution to form an optically clear solution (hereinafter, Composition E).   As a comparative, a 0.5 g aliquot of the stock solution was placed in a separate vial, and 0.1 mL of pure toluene was added to form Composition F (Comparative). Both compositions were allowed to stir overnight in a light-tight container.<br>
One or two drops of each composition were placed in separate regions on a microscope slide, and a cover slip was placed on top. A drop of solution containing a highly fluorescent, multiphoton absorbing dye (bis-[4-diphenylamino)styryl]-!-(2-ethylhexyloxy)- 4-(methoxy)benzene) was placed on the same slide to be used as a reference in determining the correct focal position. Exposure of the compositions was carried out by continuously moving the slide beneath the highly focused light from a 60 X microscope objective (NA 0.85). The focal point of the beam was positioned to coincide with the slide/composition interface. The light source was a diode pumped Tiisapphire laser (Spectra-Physics) operating at a wavelength of 800 nm, pulse width 80 fs, pulse repetition rate of 80 MHz, beam diameter of approximately 2 mm. The optical train consisted of low dispersion turning mirrors and an optical attenuator to vary the optical power. The average power delivered to the slide (45 mW) was measured where the beam exited the microscope objective using a calibrated photodiode. The slide was moved underneath the focused beam using a computer controlled, 3-axis stage.<br>
To test the photosensitivity of each composition, a series of polymer lines was created by scanning the slide under the focused beam at speeds ranging from 77 (im/s to<br><br>
40 mm/s. For each speed test, the stage was scanned back and forth along the X-direction four times with a one micron increment in the Y-direction after each pass so as to form approximately eight micron wide lines. Following exposure, unreacted resin was removed by solvent development in isopropyl alcohol. During the development process, the cover slip was gently floated off the microscope slide, exposing the polymerized lines. The slide was then examined under an optical microscope, and a threshold writing speed was determined from the number of polymer lines remaining on the slide for each composition. For Composition E, the threshold writing speed was approxiraateiy 1.75 mm/s. No image was obtained for the comparative composition, Composition F.<br>
