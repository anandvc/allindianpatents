Biological Data<br>
Isolation of rat DPP-IV<br>
DPP-IV was purified to homogeneity (electrophoretic) from rat kidney as described in Arch, Biochem. Biophy. 1995,323,148-154. Rat kidney (120 g) was homogenized in 4 volumes of water and the homogenate centrifuged for 15 minutes at lOOOg. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 3.9 with 1A/HC1 and the enzyme solubilized by autolysis for 18 hours at 37 Â°C. The pH of the supernatant collected after centrifugation was adjusted to 7.2 with LWTrizma base and the enzyme was precipitated with (NH^SC^ at 90% saturation (662 g solid ammonium sulfate per liter of solution). The solubilized precipitate was chromatographed on Sephadex G-200 (1 m x 5 cm) equilibrated with a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing NaCl at a final concentration of 0.1 .Wand developed from the bottom. Fractions containing enzymatic activity were pooled, chromatographed on DE-52 (16 x 2.5 cm) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and eluted with a 250-mL linear 0-0.4 MNaCl gradient prepared in 10 mM Tris-HCl. DPP-IV was then resolved from other<br>
brush border peptidases by chromatography on a phenyl Sepharose column (12x2 cm) equilibrated with 25% (NHÂ«)2 S04 at saturation (144 g ammonium sulfate per liter of 0.05 M<br>
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The enzyme was eluted in a homogeneous form with a 200-mL linear gradientof 25-0% (NH4)2S04, prepared in 0.05 M Tris HCI buffer.<br>
Human DPP-IV<br>
Caco-2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (P.O. Box 3605, Manassas, VA), cultured and maintained at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2 in low glucose DMEM media supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and antibiotic/antimycotic. In preparation for making an extract, cells were seeded at a density to achieve confluence within 7 days. The cells were cultured for an additional 14 days to allow for maximal DPPIV expression. On the day of harvest, cells were washed once with Dulbecco's PBS and solubilized in a IOTOM NaCl containing 50 mM Tris HCI, 0.5% Nonidet P40 and 0.3 ug/ml aprotinin a pH 8.0. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 g for 30 minutes at 4 Â°C. Inhibition constant determination for DPP-IV<br>
DPP-IV activity was determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of a surrogate substrate Gly-Pro-7-amido-methylcournarin (Gly-Pro-AMC, Catalogue #G-2761, Sigma, St Louis, MO). The assay is carried out at room temperature in black 96 well polypropylene or polyethylene plates in a total volume of 100 uL per well. Appropriate dilutions of the compounds are made in DMSO and then diluted ten fold into water. 10 uL of 5 concentrations of the compound of formula (I) (inhibitor) or 10% DMSO in water are added to individual wells containing 80 uL of DPP-IV diluted in assay buffer containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.12 mg/mL BSA. After 10 minutes at room<br><br>
WO 2004/026S22<br><br>
PCTAJS2003/029018<br><br>
temperature, the reaction is initiated by adding 10 pL of either 280, 700,1750, or 3500 uM    -^ Gly-Pro-AMC in water. The DPP-IV activity results in the formation of the fluorescent product amido-methylcoumarin (AMC) which is continuously monitored by excitation at 350 nm and measurement of fluorescent emission at 460 nm every 112 seconds for 37 minutes using an appropriate plate reader. The fluorescence at 460 nm is converted to nanomoles of AMC using a standard curve and the initial rate of AMC formation is calculated. For each concentration of compound of formula (I) (inhibitor) or DMSO control, the initial rates are used to fit the rectangular hyperbola of Michaelis-Menten by non-linear regression analysis (GraphPad Software Prism 3.0). The ratio of the apparent Km/Vmax vs. inhibitor concentration is plotted and the competitive Ki is calculated by linear regression to be the negative x-intercept The uncompetitve Ki is similarly calculated from the x-intercept of the plot of the reciprocal of the apparent Vmax versus the inhibitor concentration (Cornish-Bowden.,A. 1995. Eundamentalsof Enzyme Kinetics. Revised edition. Portland Press, Ltd., London, U.K.).<br>
The compounds of the present invention were found to inhibit DPP-IV induced fluorescence with inhibitory constants in a range of about 0.014 uM to about 7 uM. In a preferred range, the compounds ofme.present invention inhibited DPP-IV induced fluorescence with inhibitory constants in a range of about of about 0.014 uM to about 1 uM; and in a more preferred range, the compounds of the present invention inhibited DPP-IV induced fluorescence with inhibitory constants in a range of about of about 0.014 uM to about 0.5 uM.<br>
As inhibitors of DPP-IV action, the compounds of the present invention are useful in treating disorders that are mediated by DPP-IV. Disorders that are mediated by DPP-IV include diabetes, type II diabetes, hyperglycemia, Syndrome X, hyperinsulinemia and obesity. Therefore the compounds of the present invention are useful in treating the disorder of diabetes, type II diabetes, hyperglycemia, Syndrome X, hyperinsulinemia and obesity.<br>
Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV, EC 3.4.14.5; CD26) is a post-proline cleaving serine protease with significant homology to other alpha-beta hydroxylases (e.g. prolyl oligopeptidase). DPP-IV is found throughout the body, both circulating in plasma and as a type II membrane protein produced by a variety of tissues, including kidney, liver and intestine. DPP-IV plays a role in the cleavage of specific substrates with accessible amino-terminal Xaa-Pro- or Xaa-Ala- dipeptide-sequences, resulting jn their inactivation or alteration in their biological activities. ImportantTjPP-rV^ubstrates-include growth hormone releasing hormone, glucagon-like peptides or (GLP)-1 and 2, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and certain chemokines likeRANTES.(regulatedonactivation, normal Tcell expressed and secreted), stromal cell-derived factor, eotaxin, and macrophage-derived chemokine (Mentlein, R. Regulatory Peptides, 1999,85,9-24).<br>
The DPP-IV substrate, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, is released from L cells in the<br><br>

distal small intestine and colon after oral ingestion of nutrients. The active GLP-1 (7-36) amide is an incretin that increases glucose stimulated insulin secretion (Drucker, D. J. Diabetes, 1998, 47, 159-169). Other activities attributed to GLP-1 (7-36) amide include stimulation of insulin gene expression, trophic effects on pancreatic beta cells, inhibition of glucagon secretion, promotion of satiety, inhibition of food intake, and slowing of gastric emptying (Drucker, D. J. Diabetes, 1998, 47,159-169). These effects of GLP-1 (7-36) amide contribute to glucose homeostasis and the normalization of blood glucose levels in conditions of impaired glucose tolerance. In this regard, GLP-1 (7-36) amide has been demonstrated to reduce postprandial and fasting glycemia in patients with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Nauck, et al., Hormone Metab. Res. 2002,29, 411-416; Gutniak et al., J. Internal Medicine, 2001,250, 81-87; Rauchman, et al., Diabetologia. 1997, 40,205-11; Ahren, B. BioEssays 1998,20, 642-51). GLP-1 based therapy has therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.  However^ctive GLP-1 (7-36) amide is rapidly converted to GLP-1 (9-36) amide by DPP-IV cleavage of the ammo-terminal His-Ala- dipeptide of GLP-1 (7-36) amide (Mentlein, et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 1993,214, 829-835). The resulting GLP-1 (9-36) amide is inactive and is an antagonist of the GLP-1 receptor (Knudson, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996,318,429-35). The short half-life of GLP-1 (7-36) amide in the circulation (1-1.5 minutes) makes it impractical as a therapeutic agent and has led to the development of alternative strategies to enhance the anti-diabetogenic activity of GLP-1. One strategy is to increase the circulating half-life of GLP-1, by inhibiting DPP-IV activity (Deacon, et al., Diabetes. 1995,44 1126-31). Inhibition of DPP-IV in vivo increases the level of circulating GLP-1 (7-36) amide with a concomitant increase in its insulinotropic effect (Deacon, et al., Diabetes. 1998,47,764-9). A DPP-IV inhibitor has been demonstrated to improve glucose tolerance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Ahren, B., et al., Diabetes Care 2002,25, 869-875). Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples can be used in the treatment of conditions caused by or associated with impaired glucose tolerance including the prevention or treatment of diabetes, especially-non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and metabolic syndrome (Johannsson, et al., J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1999,22(5 Suppl), 41-6).<br>
Striking similarities exist between the metabolic syndrome (Syndrome X) and untreated growth hormone deficiency. Abdominal/visceral obesity and insulin resistance characterize both syndromes (Reaven, GM, Physiol. Rev. 1995, 75,473-86; Johansson, et al., Metabolism. 1995,44,1126-29). Growth hormone favorably effects some of the perturbations associated with abdominal/visceral obesity, including reduction in abdominal/visceral obesity, improved insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein metabolism and reduction in diastolic blood pressure (Barreto-Filho, et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002, 87(5), 2018-23; Colao et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002,87(3), 1088-93; Gotherstrom,<br><br>

For the treatment of diabetes or Syndrome X, compounds of the present invention may be used alone, or in combination with any existing anti-diabetic agent Agents which may be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to insulin, an insulin analog such as mecasermin and the like, an insulin secretagogue such as nateglinide and the like, a biguanide such as metformin and the like, a sulfonylurea such as chlorpropamide, glipizide, glyburide, and the like, an insulin sensitizing agent such as a PPARy agonist such as troglitazone, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, and the like, an a-glucosidase inhibitor such as acarbose, voglibose, miglitol and the like, an aldose reductase inhibitor such as zopolrestat and the like, a metiglinide such as repaglinide and the like, a glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor, GLP-Loi^ajinmetic of GLP-1 such as exendin-4,or other such anti-diabetic agents that are known to one skilled in the art The ability of the compounds of the present invention to treat diabetes, alone or in combination with another agent, can be demonstrated according to the methods described by Zander, M; Mustafa, T.; Toft-Nielsen, M.-B.;Madsbad, S.;Hoist, J. J. mDiabetesCare 2001,24,720-725; or, according to the methods described herein.<br>
DPP-IV-mediated proteolysis has been established as a major route of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) degradation andinactivation (Kubiak, et al., Drug Metab. Dispos. 1989,17,393-7). GHRH-derivatives that are resistant to DPP-IV cleavage are more potent in increasing serum growth hormone levels when administered iv. due to longer stability in vivo. DPP-IV inhibition would be predicted to increase GHRH levels and thus serum growth hormone levels. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples can be used in the treatment of conditions associated with deficiency in growth hormone including metabolic disorders (central obesity, dyslipidemia), osteoporosis and frailty of aging.<br>
Diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by multiple lipoprotein defects including moderately high serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, small LDL particles and low levels of HDL cholesterol. The dyslipidemia associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is improved in conjunctton^with improved diabetic condition following treatment with GLP-1 (Junti-Berggren, et al., Diabetes Care. 1996,19,1200-6). DPP:rV inhibition is predicted to increase the level of circulating GLP-1 (7-36) amide_and-thereby would be effective in the treatment of.diabetic dyslipidemia and associated complications. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples can be used in the treatment hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and associated cardiovascular disease.<br>

with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has been reported to promote satiety and to suppress food intake (Flint, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 1998,101, 515-520; Naslund, et aL,Am. J. Clin. Nutr.   1998, 68, 525-530; Gutzwiller, et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1999,276, R1541-R1544. DPP-IV inhibition is predicted to increase the level of circulating GLP-1 (7-36) amide and thereby increases satiety in obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in_the examples can be used in the treatment of obesity.<br>
For the treatment of obesity, compounds of the present invention may be used alone, or in combination with any existing anti-obesity agent as described by Flint, A.; Raben, A.; Astrup, A.; Hoist, J. J. in J. Clin. Invest. 1998,101, 515-520 or by Toft-Nielsen, M.-B.; Madsbad, S.; Hoist, J. J. in Diabetes Care 1999,22,1137-1143. Agents which may be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to fatty-acidjuptake inhibitors such as orlistatand the like, monoamine reuptake inhibitors such as sibutramine and the like, anorectic agents such as dexfenfluramine, bromocryptine, and the like, sympathomimetics such as phentermine, phendimetrazine, mazindol, and the like, thyromimetic agents, or other such anti-obesity agents that are known to one skilled in the art.<br>
DPP- IV is expressed on a fraction of resting T cells at low density but is strongly upregulated following T-cell activation. DPP-IV may have important functions on T cells and in the immune system. Synthetic inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of CD26 have been shown to suppress certain immune reactions in vitro and in vivo. In vitro recombinant soluble DPP-IV enhances proliferative responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes to stimulation with soluble tetanus toxoid antigen. In addition, the enhancing effect requires DPP-IV enzyme activity (Tanaka, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Set USA, 1994, Pi,3082-86; Tanaka, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1993,90,4583). Soluble DPP-IV up-regulates the expression of the costimulatory molecule CD86 on monocytes through its dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity suggesting that soluble DPP-IV enhances T cell immune response to recall antigen via its direct effect on antigen presenting cells (Ohnuma, et al., J. Immunol. 2001,767(12), 6745-55). Consequently, DPP-IV inhibition would bej)redicted to suppress certain immune responses and thus have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of immunomodulatory diseases. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples can be used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, scleroderma, chronic inflammatory bowel disease or syndrome and allograft rejection in transplantation.<br>
Chemokine receptors, especially CCR5 and CXCR4, act as cofactors for HTV-1 entry. into CD4+ cells and their corresponding iigands can suppress HTV entry and thus replication. The CXC chemokine, stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a chemokine for resting T-lymphocytes and monocytes. SDF-1 exists as two splice variants, SDF-lalpha and SDF-lbeta that differ by four additional C-terminal residues in SDF-1 beta. Truncation of the N-<br><br>
