				<td>Title: Wing mirror unit<br>
The invention relates to a wing mirror unit, in particular for a motor<br>
vehicle, comprising a mirror foot for attachment to the body of a motor<br>
vehicle, and a mirror housing connected with the mirror foot, which mirror<br>
housing is adjustable with respect to the mirror foot between a folded<br>
orientation, in which the mirror housing substantially extends along the<br>
body of the motor vehicle, and an unfolded orientation, in which the mirror<br>
housing is substantially oriented transversely to the body.<br>
Such a wing mirror unit is commonly known. The adjustability serves<br>
to adjust the minor housing of the wing mirror between the unfolded<br>
orientation, in wliich the mirror housing extends relatively far outward with<br>
respect to the body, and a folded orientation, in which the mirror housing<br>
projects less far. In this manner, inter alia the risk of damage to the wing<br>
mirror can be diminished when parking, and the wing mirror can yield<br>
somewhat when colliding with an object. The wing mirror unit often<br>
comprises an electric actuator, with which the mirror housing is adjustable<br>
between the folded orientation and the unfolded orientation.<br>
In the known wing mirror unit, to keep the necessary electric power<br>
of the electric actuator for adjusting the mirror housing as small as possible,<br>
the contact between the mirror housing and the mirror foot is kept as small<br>
as possible. Consequently, a slit is present between the adjacent surfaces of<br>
the mirror housing and the mirror foot. The mirror housing and the mirror<br>
foot are often provided with ring-shaped contact surfaces, for instance ring-<br>
shaped or cone-shaped contact surfaces, which are located coaxially around<br>
a base pivot, around which the mirror housing, under the action of the<br>
actuator, is pivot illy arranged with respect to the mirror foot. Around the<br>
contact surfaces, between the mirror housing and the mirror foot, then extends a<br>
slit, which is often ring-or cone-shaped.<br>
It is a drawback of this structure that through the presence of the slit the outer<br>
contours of the mirror foot and the mirror housing connect discontinuously.<br>
Through this discontinuity, during driving with the vehicle, a substantial amount<br>
of wind noise can be produced, which is unpleasant to the driver and the<br>
passengers of the motor vehicle.<br>
EP 0 931 699 discloses a wing mirror unit according to the preamble of claim l,<br>
in which the wing mirror unit is provided with an hinge actuator, which is<br>
arranged with car path assemblies to move adjacent surfaces of the mirror<br>
housing and the mirror foot transversely to each other between a first position,<br>
in which the adjacent surfaces of the mirror housing and the mirror foot enclose<br>
a slit, and a second position, in which the adjacent surfaces abut each other and<br>
the outer contours of the mirror foot and the mirror housing substantially<br>
connect flowingly.<br>
According to the invention, such a wing mirror unit is characterized by the<br>
features of claim 1. By arranging the actuator to move the adjacent surfaces of<br>
the mirror housing and the mirror foot through translation in transverse direction<br>
to the car body to each other, the slit can be closed and then be opened again<br>
without high friction occurring as a result of tangential movements of the contact<br>
surfaces along each other during the pivoting of the mirror housing.<br>
Consequently, a relatively light motor will suffice for the actuator, even when at<br>
the location of the outer contours of the mirror foot and the mirror housing the<br>
adjacent surfaces are located relatively far from a central axis of rotation<br>
energizer by the actuator.<br>
Preferably, the actuator is arranged to adjust the wing mirror unit in or near the<br>
unfolded orientation between the first position and the second position, so that<br>
during adjustment between the folded and the unfolded orientation the wing<br>
mirror unit is substantially in the first position. This ensures that during<br>
adjustment a slit is present and the contact surface <br>
between adjacent surfaces of the mirror housing and the mirror foot are<br>
minimized, so that when folding and unfolding a lowest possible friction must be<br>
overcome.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the invention are defined in the<br>
subclaims.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail on the basis of a number of<br>
exemplary embodiments, which are shown in a drawing. In the drawing:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic cross-section of a wing mirror unit near the<br>
unfolded oriented in the first position;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the wing mirror unit of Fig. 1 in the unfolded orientation and in the<br>
second position;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a diagrammatic top view of a wing mirror unit according to the<br>
invention in the unfolded orientation in the first position;<br>
Fig. 4 shows the wing mirror unit of Fig. 3 in the unfolded orientation and in the<br>
second position; and<br>
Fig. 5 shows the wings mirror unit of Fig. 3 in the folded orientation and in the<br>
second position.<br>
The figures only relate to diagrammatic representations of preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention and are given by way of non-limiting exemplary<br>
embodiment. In the figures similar or corresponding parts are denoted by the<br>
same reference numerals.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a wing mirror unit 1, comprising a mirror foot 2, which is attached<br>
to the body 3 of the motor vehicle. The wing mirror unit 1 further comprises a<br>
mirror housing 4 connected with the mirror foot 2. In this exemplary<br>
embodiment, the connection is realized in that the mirror foot 2 comprises a<br>
base pivot 5, around which the mirror housing 4, under the action of a hinge<br>
actuator 6, is pivotally arranged with respect to the mirror<br>
foot 2, With the aid of the actuator 6, the mirror housing 4 is adjustable<br>
between a folded orientation, in which the mirror housing 4 substantially<br>
abuts along the body 3 of the motor vehicle, and the unfolded orientation<br>
shown in Fig. 1, ia which the mirror housing 4 is substantially oriented<br>
transversely to the body.<br>
The actuator 6 is arranged to move a<yacent surfaces of></yacent>
respectively the niirror housing 4 and the mirror foot 2 in a direction,<br>
indicated by an arrow P, transversely to each other between the first<br>
position shown in Fig. 1, in which the adjacent surfaces 7a, 7b of the mirror<br>
housing 4 and th
in Fig. 2, in which the adjacent surfaces 7a, 7b abut each other. In the first<br>
position shown in Fig. 1, the outer contours 9, 10 of respectively the mirror<br>
foot 2 and the mirror housing 4 connect discontinuous^'. In the second<br>
position shown ir Fig. 2, the outer contours 9, 10 of respectively the mirror<br>
foot 2 and mirror housing 4 substantially connect flowingly. In the position<br>
shown in Fig. 2, the slit 8 is substantially closed, so that during driving with<br>
the motor vehicle this slit produces considerably less wind noise.<br>
The hinge actuator 6 is arranged to adjust the wing mirror unit 1<br>
near the unfolded orientation between the first position and the second<br>
position. During adjustment between the folded and the unfolded<br>
orientation, the wing mirror unit 1 is then substantially in the first position.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, this is realized in that the adjacent<br>
surfaces 7a, 7b o1'respectively the mirror housing 4 and the mirror foot 2 are<br>
designed as flat, ring-shaped contact surfaces, which are located coajually<br>
around the base pivot 5 at a first distance D1, while the mirror foot 2 and<br>
the mirror housing 4 cooperate via three cam path assemblies 11 curvedly<br>
extending around the base pivot 5 at a second distance D2. The cam path<br>
assemblies 11 each comprise a cam 11a provided on the mirror housing 4,<br>
here integrated with a flange 12, which engages the cam path 11b provided<br>
on the mirror too, 2. The cam path 11b is provided with a flat path part<br>
11b1, which during folding and unfolding guarantees the slit 8 between the<br>
contact surfaces It., 7b, which slit corresponds with the first position, and<br>
with a run-on surf ice 11b2, which in or near the unfolded orientation<br>
guarantees the ad:ustment between the first and the second position of the<br>
contact surfaces 7a, 7b.<br>
When folding from the unfolded orientation, the cams 11a will<br>
cooperate with the run-on surfaces 11b2, so that the adjacent contact<br>
surfaces 7a, 7b move apart transversely to each other from the second<br>
position, in which they abut against each other, to the first position, in<br>
which they enclose the slit 8. In this exemplary embodiment, the movement<br>
of the contact surfaces 7a, 7b transverse to each other corresponds with a<br>
movement in the axial direction along the base pivot 5. As soon as the slit<br>
has opened completely, the cams 11a cooperate with the flut parts llbl of<br>
the cam paths. Directly from the moment that the slit 8 begins to open up to<br>
the moment that the folded orientation is reached, the actuator only needs<br>
to overcome the frictional moment exerted by the frictional forces between<br>
the cams lla and the cam paths 11b. Through the relatively small distance<br>
D2, the frictional moment to be overcome is (substantially smaller than<br>
when the contact surfaces 7a, 7b would reimiin in contact during the<br>
adjustment. Furthermore, the contact surface is smaller.<br>
Referring to Figs. S through 5, a second embodiment of a wing mirror<br>
unit according to the invention is shown therein. In this embodiment, the<br>
mirror foot 2 and the mirror housing 4, under the action of a linear actuator<br>
13, are translatably arranged with respect to each other. In this<br>
embodiment, the adjacent contact surfaces of the mirror housing 4 and the<br>
mirror foot 2 comprise contact surfaces 14a, 14b, which, through translation<br>
in transverse dire ction with respect to the body 3, are adjustable under the<br>
influence of the linear actuator 13 between the first position, in which they<br>
enclose a slit 8, and the second position, in which the contact: surfaces abut<br>
each other in a form-closed manner. When, within the context of this<br>
application reference is made to adjustment transverse to the body, this is<br>
understood to mean that the adjusting direction comprises a component in<br>
the direction tranttverse to the body. The adjusting direction may also<br>
comprise components in other directions, such as, for instance, in a direction<br>
substantially parallel to the body and directed backward. In another<br>
embodiment, the adjusting direction may, foe instance, be directed<br>
diagonally backwird.<br>
The mirror housing 4 is pivotally arranged around a base pivot 5. In<br>
this embodiment, to ensure that in folded orientation the mirror housing 4<br>
can substantially abut along the body of the motor vehicle, the mirror<br>
housing 4, when folding, preferably just before pivoting from the unfolded<br>
orientation to the folded orientation takes piace, is moved outward with<br>
respect to the body, under the influence of the linear actuator 13, so that the<br>
slit 8 is formed, and the form closure is undone. In the unfolded orientation,<br>
for instance when the mirror housing 4 comes into contact with an object,<br>
the mirror housing 4 can pivot around the base pivot 5 under elastic<br>
deformation of the form-closed contact surface 14b of the mirror foot. In this<br>
manner, an emexgency folding orientation can be reached, which is shown in<br>
Fig. 5. When the mirror housing 4 is then manually pivoted back around the<br>
base pivot 5, the anchoring of the pivoting axis 14 will be effected again<br>
through relaxation of the elastically deformed material at the location of the<br>
contact surface 14b. It may be clear that such a manner of form-closed<br>
anchoring of the mirror housing to the mirror foot can per so also be<br>
advantageous in a wing mirror unit of the type mentioned m the opening<br>
paragraph, in which the contact surfaces cooperating in a form-closed<br>
manner permanently abut each other, i.e. when during adjustment of the<br>
mirror housing eo slit is present between the contact surfaces cooperating in<br>
a form-closed menner.<br>
It may be clear that the invention is not limited to the exemplary<br>
embodiments described herein. Thus, the wing mirror unit may be adjusted<br>
by pivoting with re spect to the body between the first and the second<br>
position to close the slit, and the closure of the slit and the pivoting of the<br>
mirror housing may be carried out not only successively, but also at least<br>
partly simultaneously, optionally under the action of the same actuator.<br>
When the wing mirror unit is equipped with a single actuator, which drives<br>
both adjustment between the first and the second position and pivoting<br>
between the folded orientation and the unfolded orientation, the actuator<br>
may be included in the mirror foot.<br>
Such variants will be clear to those skilled in the art and are deemed<br>
to be within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
