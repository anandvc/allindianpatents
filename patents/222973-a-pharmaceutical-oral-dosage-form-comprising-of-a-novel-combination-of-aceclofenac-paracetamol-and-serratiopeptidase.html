Title of the invention: A Pharmaceutical Oral Dosage Form Comprising of A Novel Combination of Aceclofenac , Paracetamol and Serratiopeptidase<br>
2.	M/S. J.B.CHEMICALS &amp; PHARMACEUTICALS LTD., an Indian Company, having its Registered Office at Neelam Centre, "B' Wing, 4th floor, Hind Cycle Road, Worli, Mumbai 400 025, Maharashta, India.<br>
3.	The following specifications particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1324/MUM/2004<br><br>
A Pharmaceutical Oral Dosage Form Comprising of A Novel Combination of Aceclofenac , Paracetamol and Scrratiopeptidasc<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention generally relates to pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration. This invention relates in particular to such compositions comprising of a novel combination of aceclofenac, paracetamol and serratiopeptidase for the treatment of acute, painful and inflammatory conditions.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Various painful inflammatory conditions including those associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, postoperation state, musculoskeletal trauma, sports injuries, sinusitis etc are treated with NSAIDS.<br>
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic multisystem disease of unknown cause. Although there are a variety of systemic manifestations, the characteristic feature of rheumatoid arthritis is persistent inflammatory synovitis, usually involving peripheral joints in a symmetric distribution. The potential of the synovial inflammation to cause cartilage destruction and bone erosions and subsequent changes in joint integrity is the hallmark of the disease. ( Ref: Principals of internal medicines by T.R.Harrison)<br>
Medical management of rheumatoid arthritis involves use of nonsteroidal antiÂ¬inflammatory drugs and analgesics to control the symptoms and signs of the local inflammatory process.<br>
Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease of humans. It is characterized by deep ache in joints. Treatment is aimed at reducing pain, maintaining mobility and minimizing disability. NSAIDs decrease joint pain and improve mobility.<br>
1<br><br>
Aceclofenac is a potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug and has provided relief in various inflammatory and painful conditions. Aceclofenac is highly selective COX-2 inhibitor with COX-1 : COX-2 IC50 ratio of 129.(Henrotin Y, de leval X et al. In vitro effects of aceclofenac and its metabolites on the production by chondrocytes of inflammatory mediators. lnflamm.Res. 2001 Aug.50(8):391-9)<br>
It acts at periphery by decreaseing proinflammatory prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2).<br>
Not only Acelcofenac is potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent but in contrast to some tother NSAIDs (e.g. Diclofenac and naproxen), Aceclofenac has shown stimulatory effects on cartilage matrix synthesis. (Dingle JT. The effect of NSAIDs on human cartilage glucosaminoglycan synthesis.Eur.J. Rheumatol Inflamm ,1996:l6(l):47-52).<br>
Thus it is drug of choice in treatment of degenerative arthritis conditions.4'hydroxyaceclofenac, a major metabolite of Aceclofenac has chondroprotectibe properties attributable to suppression of IL-I-8-mediated promatrix metalloproteinase production.(Dooeley M. Spencer CM et al, Aceclofenac: A repraisal of its use in the management of pain and rheumatic disease.Drugs 2001; 61(9): 1351-1378).<br>
Aceclofenac decreases pain levels, reduces the severity of symptoms and improves the functional capacity of the affected joint in patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It has been found to be effective in post surgical dental pain, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, musculoskeletal trauma, primary dysmenorrhoea, lumbago.<br>
Metanalysis of studies involving more than 3000 patients indicated that a significantly greater proprtion of patients receiving Aceclofenac remained free from Gl symptoms after 3 to 6 months treatment than recipients of Diclofenac , naproxen, Piroxicam, lndomethancin, Tenoxican or Ketoprofen.(Peris F Bird HA et al: Treatmetn compliance and safety of aceclofeanc versus standard NSAIDs in  patients with<br>
2<br><br>
common arthritic disorders: a metaanalysis, F.ur J Rhematol Inflamm lc)96;16(l):37-<br>
45).<br>
Paracetamol is time tested, trusted, cost effective and popular analgesic and acts centrally i.e. it has selective inhibitory action on cyclooxygenase in brain. Paracetamol is administered by mouth in tablets , syrup, suspension, capsules in dose range of 125 mg -500 mg per dose .it is taken with or after food.<br>
Aceclofenac is administered by mouth as tablets in the dose range of 100 mg to 200 mg daily.<br>
Serratiopeptidase is an enzyme derived from bacteria belonging to genus Sen?, ' . A<br>
widely used anti-inflammatory enzyme, it is a stronger casenolytic or fibrinolitic<br>
agent	than	most	other	alkaline	or	neutral	proteases.<br>
The purified enzyme has very good medicinal action in the body after absorption, especially,        anti-inflammatory        and        sputum        liquefying        properties.<br>
It eliminates inflammatory oedema and swelling, accelerates liquefaction of pus and sputum, and enhances the action of antibiotics. In sharp contrast to this, NSAIDs only relieve pain. Serratiopeptidase has wide-ranging applications, which are listed below. The usual dose is 15 mg -30 mg daily.<br>
In case of analgesics, it is advantageous to have two drugs with different mechanism of action, differing or simultaneous onset and differing duration of effect to prolong their therapeutic efficacy.(Analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents.Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 10th Edn, 687 - 729).<br>
3<br><br>
Pharmacokinetics of paracetamol and aceclofcnac:<br>
Paracetamol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The concentration in plasma reaches peak in 30 minutes and half life in plasma is about 2 hours after the therapeutic dose. Aceclofenac has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile, which favors its combination with Paracetamol. The time to peak plasma concentration of aceclofenac is 1.08 -1.37 hrs whereas that with paracetamol is 30 -60 min. The efficacy of the combination will be more since the pharmacokinetic profile of the drugs is similar. Aceclofenac also has half life of 4 hrs which makes its administration twice a day. Lower doses of the combination will be required for the analgesic action.<br>
Pharmacokinetic profile of paracetamol and aceclofenac:<br><br>
Parameters	Aceclofenac	Paracetampl<br>
Tmax	1.08-1.37 hrs	30 -60 minutes<br>
Elimination half life	4 hrs	2 hrs.<br>
Thus taking into consideration the limitations associated with the existing antiÂ¬inflammatory , analgesic pharmaceutical compositions, the inventor has come out with a unique composition comprising of aceclofenac, paracetamol and serratiopeptidase in a dosage form suitable for oral administration having antiÂ¬inflammatory, analgesic and antiedemic , healing property. This combination has been found to be therapeutically better over either aceclofenac, paracetamol ,serratiopeptidase individually.<br>
Accordingly, it is among the objects of the present invention to provide oral dosage formulation containing aceclofenac, paracetamol and serratiopeptidase.<br>
4<br><br>
