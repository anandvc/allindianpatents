				<td>CONTINUOUS CONNECTION PROFILE FOR ATTACHMENT OF SHEET PILES TO SUPPORTING ELEMENTS<br>
The invention relates to a continuous connection profile for attachment of sheet piles to supporting elements, particularly to double-T-beams, where the connection profile has a central rib bar, which separates two opposing attachment profiles, each having a jaw, and is part of both attachment profiles, wherein the one attachment profile is configured as a mounting profile for the supporting element, and the other attachment profile is configured as a receiving profile for a lock of a sheet pile to be attached.<br>
Such connection profiles are used, for example, for the assembly of combination sheet pile walls, i.e., sheet pile walls made up of a series of supporting elements, between which numerous sheet piles, generally always pairs of sheet piles, are inserted. Such connection profiles are known, for example, from DE201 21 712 U1, DE 19711 242 A1, DE 198 22 063 A1, or DE 199 23 492 A1. In some embodiments these connection profiles have a central rib bar which divides two opposing attachment profiles from each other, each having a jaw, and forms part of the interior wall of each attachment profile. In the case of the known connection profile, the one attachment profile is a mounting profile for the supporting element, which, for example, is mounted on a double-T-beam and if necessary is compressed with it. The other attachment profile is a receiving profile for a lock of a sheet pile to be attached, for example a sheet pile with so-called LARSSEN-locks provided on both longitudinal edges.<br>
A widely propagated and frequently used sheet pile is the Z-sheet pile by Hoesch, which has a Z-shaped cross section, having a knob section on one of its longitudinal edges and a claw section on its other longitudinal edge. The claw section has a straight claw flange as well as a claw nose and an opposing claw thumb on the actual lock, both of which act as the ends of a jaw with a jaw opening, into which the knob section (which is about trapezoid-shaped in cross section) of a Z-sheet<br><br>
pile to be attached can be inserted. The claw section and the head section of the Z-sheet pile are bent in the lock area, in order to move the lock from the course of the sheet pile so that the sheet pile-wall flanges that meet each other form a straight line, and the lock connection of the two sheet piles does not project out from the areas of the sheet pile wall flanges.<br>
By stringing such Z-sheet piles together, stable sheet pile walls can be assembled. The geometrical shape of the claw-and-knob section does in fact make possible a relatively small swivelling angle of +/- 7° between adjoining sheet piles, through which, when the sheet piles are rammed down, the locks can jump out of their connections if the ground is uneven.<br>
Adjoining support elements can swivel in deviate fashion, for example, when these support elements are rammed beneath the ground, if the ground is very irregular due to rock formations, erratic blocks or similar phenomena, so that the support elements are twisted about their longitudinal axis when rammed down.<br>
Adjoining support elements may, however, be deliberately subjected to deviate twisting, in order, for example, to form a circle or some other closed formation of combination sheet pile walls or combination sheet pile walls with a projecting corner without additional constructional components.<br>
Such Z-sheet piles have not been able to be used until now to create combination sheet pile walls from support elements and sheet piles, which, for example, are needed to create harbour facilities. Attachment profiles appropriate to the supporting elements, which permit a secure ramming down of the sheet pile wall, do not exist.<br>
The invention has the object of providing a connection profile on whose receiving profile such Z-sheet piles can be hung, to create combination sheet pile walls.<br><br>
According to the invention, the above-mentioned problem is solved by a connection profile with the features according to claim 1. Additionally, the above-mentioned problem is solved by a connection profile with the features according to claim 2 as well as by a connection profile with the features according to claim 3.<br>
The receiving profile which is regarded in particular essential for the invention is common to the connection profiles defined in the three independent claims 1, 2 and 3, and is identically configured with all three connection profiles according to the invention. The three connection profiles defined in the three independent claims differ only in the configuration of the mounting profile with which the connection profile is to be connected on the supporting element-Thus, with the connection profile defined in claim 1, the mounting profile for the support element is bordered by the central rib bar, a first straight jaw bar that comes off one edge of the central rib bar at an angle of 90°, and a second jaw bar, bent in direction of the first jaw bar, that comes off the other edge of the central rib bar. The interior cross section of the mounting profile is somewhat trape-zoid-shaped, with the base of the trapezoid being formed by the central rib bar. The one base angle is preferably 90°, while the other base angle is preferably greater than 45°.<br>
In contrast, with the connection profile defined in claim 2, the mounting profile is formed by the central rib bar, a first straight jaw bar that comes off one edge of the jaw bar at an angle of 90°, and a second jaw bar that likewise comes off the other edge of the central rib bar at an angle of 90°. By means of using a mounting profile thus configured, it is possible to secure the connection profile to supporting elements on which the attachment section for the connection profile is about rectangular in cross section.<br>
The mounting profile of the connection profile according to coordinated claim 3 has an approximately dovetail-shaped interior cross section, which is bordered by<br><br>
the central rib bar and two jaw bars that are mirror-symmetrically bend toward each other and extend from the two edges of the central rib bar. Due to the interior dovetail-shaped cross section, the connection profile can be attached to support elements whose attachment sections have wedge-shaped exterior cross sections, for example Peiner beams. Due to the dovetail-shaped configuration of the interior cross section, it becomes possible that the attachment profile can be secured with the jaw of the receiving profile, either pointing away from the supporting element or turned toward the supporting element on the wedge-shaped attachment section, without having to provide connection profiles with differently configured mounting profiles. The two jaw bars preferably run at an inclination angle in a range between about 30 to 50°, related to the flat side of the central rib bar, with 35° being especially preferred for the inclination angle.<br>
The receiving profile that is common to the three connection profiles according to the invention is identically configured with all three connection profiles, and is bordered by the central rib bar, a straight jaw bar that runs off one edge of the central rib bar at an angle of 90°, and a fourth jaw bar that runs off the other edge of the rib bar initially at an angle of 90°and than bends around in a large arc, with its end pointing to the end of the opposite, third straight jaw bar.<br>
What is attained by the configuration of the receiving profile according to the invention for the claw and knob section of a sheet pile attachment, is that the claw or knob section can be swivelled over a wide range in the receiving profile. Thus with the configuration of the receiving profile for the knob section the swivel angle of a sheet pile inserted ranges from about +23° to -45°, so that the entire swivel angle is about 70°. For the receiving profile for the claw section of a sheet pile to be attached, the swivel angle extends from about +27° to -40°, so that the swivel angle likewise is about 70°.<br>
If two Z-sheet piles with the connection profile according to the invention are used in a combination sheet pile wall between two adjoining double-T-beams, the sup-<br><br>
porting elements, being double-T-beams, for example, can be turned relative to each other at an angle of over 80°, without resulting in stresses within the combination sheet pile wall. If one bears in mind that the swivel angle between two sheet piles connected without an additional connection profile in the middle between two support elements amounts to a few more degrees also, then one sees that an angle of approximately 90° can be attained between two-adjoining support elements. In this way, the combination sheet pile wall can be set at a true angle, or a closed combination sheet pile wall can be erected in a circle or similar closed form.<br>
Due to this large swivel angle, when the supporting elements are rammed down, displacements appearing in the sheet pile can be compensated for in all directions.<br>
The receiving profile of the three embodiments of the connection profiles is configured according to the invention in such a manner that the individual pieces of the sheet pile wall can be securely rammed down so that deviations of the sheet pile wall from the nominal measure can be compensated over wide ranges, and within the combination sheet pile wall, between adjoining supporting elements, especially double-T-beams, high swivel angles are possible.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the connection profile according to the invention, as they are defined in claims 1, 2 and 3, are disclosed in the following description, the drawings and the dependent claims.<br>
Thus, with a particularly preferred embodiment of the connection profile, the interior cross section of the receiving profile of a sheet pile to be attached is substantially a slanting ellipse. What is attained by the at least approximately elliptical-shaped interior cross section of the receiving profile is that the lock can be swivelled back and forth within a predetermined swivelling range in the receiving profile, with the arc-shaped jaw bar preventing the lock from jumping out of the re-<br><br>
ceiving profile. The cross section of the interior space of the receiving profile does not have to have the exact determined elliptical shape. The elliptical shape is merely a guide for the dimensions. The longer axis or principal axis of the ellipse preferably runs at an angle of about 30° to the central rib bar.<br>
If the receiving profile for attachment of a claw section of the sheet pile is to be used, the ratio of the longer axis of the ellipse to the shorter axis or minor axis of the ellipse in this embodiment shape is preferably between 1.1 and 1.2.<br>
If, in contrast, use is made of the receiving profile for hanging a knob section, the receiving profile likewise has a slanting ellipse whose principal axis preferably runs at an angle of about 30° to the central rib bar. The ratio between the longer and the shorter axis preferably is here in a range between 1.2 and 1.6, however.<br>
The jaw of the receiving profile for the claw section of a sheet pile to be attached has its centre about in the extension of the shorter axis of the ellipse. The centre of the jaw opening of the receiving profile for the knob section of a sheet pile to be attached lies on an imaginary line running at about a right angle to the longer axis of the ellipse, with the imaginary line intersecting the longer axis of the ellipse between the centre point of the ellipse and the point of intersection facing the central rib bar between the longer axis with the ellipse. The imaginary line lies about in the middle between these two points.<br>
The width of the jaw opening lies in a range of about a third of the length of the longer axis of the respective ellipse. The placement of the exits from the interior spaces of the two different ellipses is guided by the position of the curved locking connections of the attaching Z-sheet piles.<br>

porting elements and two sheet piles inserted between them, with the two connection profiles shown in Figures 1 and 5 being used.<br>
In Figures 1 and 2, the front side of a first embodiment of a connection profile 10 for a claw section 12 of a Z-sheet pile 14 (see Figure 2) is shown in a plan view.<br>
The connection profile 10 has a central, substantially straight rib bar 16, on one side of which a mounting profile 18 is placed for attachment on a knob bar 20 of a double-T-beam 22, and on the other side, a receiving profile 24 is placed to receive the claw section 12 of the Z-sheet pile 14.<br>
Mounting profile 18 has a first, straight jaw bar 26, which extends out at an angle of 90° from the edge of central rib bar 16 shown above in Figure 1, as well as a second jaw bar 28 that extends out from the edge shown below in Figure 1 and bending around in the direction toward the first jaw bar 26. The two jaw bars 26 and 28 terminate at a plane E running parallel to central rib bar 16, and jointly form with it a jaw 30 with a roughly trapezoidal interior cross section 32. This trapezoidal interior cross section 32 is adapted to the exterior cross section 34 of the knob bar 20 of double-T-beam 22 so that it can be received with little clearance into mounting profile 18.<br>
Receiving profile 24 has a substantially straight third jaw bar 36 joined up with jaw bar 28 and extends out from central rib bar 16 at an angle of about 90°, and a fourth jaw bar 38 joint to with straight jaw bar 26 and bends out in a large arc. Jaw bars 36 and 38, along with central rib bar 16, enclose a jaw 40 with a jaw opening 42 delimited by the ends of jaw bars 36 and 38. The interior cross section of jaw 40 runs approximately along an ellipse 44 depicted by a dash-and-dot line with a<br><br>
longer axis a and a shorter axis b. Larger axis a makes an acute angle of about 30° with a centre axis c, drawn with a dash-and-dot line, of central rib bar 16. The axis ratio between the longer and shorter axis a and b is in the range between 11:9 and 11:10. The extension of shorter axis b runs approximately through the centre of jaw opening 42. Jaw bars 36 and 38 extend in such a manner that a tangential plane T touches the two jaw bars 36 and 38 and runs about parallel to longer axis a of said ellipse 44.<br>
Figure 2 shows the connection of connection profile 10 with the arm of double-T-beam 22 and claw section 12 of Z-sheet pile 14, with Z-sheet pile 14 depicted in its middle setting and its extreme swivel settings. The "upper" swivel setting is here depicted in dotted lines, while the "lower" swivel setting is shown by dashed lines. Between the normal setting and the upper swivel setting, a swivel angle a of about 40° can be achieved, and between the normal setting and the lower swivel setting an angle (3 of about 27° can be attained.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show modifications of the connection profiles shown in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
The modified connection profile 10' shown in Figure 3 differs from connection profile 10 only in regard to the configuration of mounting profile 18'. With this mounting profile 18', the two jaw bars 26' and 28' run at an angle of about 90° relative to the flat side of central rib bar 16', so that an approximately rectangular interior cross section 32' is formed. The mounting profile 18' thus formed can be mounted on a supporting element in which the attachment section is configured to be rectangular in its exterior cross section.<br>
The modified connection profile 10" shown in Figure 4 also differs from connection profile 10 only in the configuration of mounting profile 18". Here the two jaw bars 26" and 28" run toward each other at an angle of about 35°, respectively, so that mounting profile 18" in its interior cross section 32" is about dovetail-shaped. Ow-<br><br>
ing to the dovetail-shaped configuration of mounting profile 18", connection profile 10" can be attached to the knob bar 20 of said double-T-beam 22 with the jaw opening 42 of receiving profile 24 facing either inward, or, as indicated by the dashed depiction, outward.<br>
The second embodiment of a connection profile 50 according to the invention shown in Figures 5 and 6 is substantially designed similar to connection profile 10 and has a central rib bar 52, a mounting profile 54 to receive knob bar 20 of double-T-beam 22, as well as a receiving profile 56 for receiving a knob section 58 of Z-sheet pile 14 (see Figure 6). The dimensions of jaw bars 60 and 62 as well as jaw 64 and jaw opening 66 of mounting profile 54 in connection profile 50 correspond in their configuration to those of connection profile 10.<br>
On the side of central rib bar 52 that faces away from mounting profile 54, receiving profile 56 is configured for knob section 58 of Z-sheet pile 14. Receiving profile 56 is bordered by a straight jaw bar 68 that attaches to jaw bar 60, whose flat side shown at the top in Figure 5 is bent downwards. Opposite-sided jaw bar 70 initially extends out as a continuation of said jaw strip 62 at an angle of about 90° from central rib bar 52 and then makes a rather sharp bow turn, with the end of this jaw bar 70 pointing to the end of straight jaw bar 68.<br>
By this means, a jaw 72 with a jaw opening 74 is delimited by said central rib bar 52 and said jaw bars 68 and 70. Here also the interior area of jaw 72 can be described as an ellipse 76 with a longer axis d and a shorter axis e, wherein, however, the shorter axis e projects into the end area of jaw bar 70 and itself projects slightly into the central rib bar 52. Longer axis d is again inclined relative to central rib bar 52 at an angle between 30° and 40°. Parallel to shorter axis e, there runs a parallel P which extends between the centre point of ellipse 76 and the edge on straight jaw bar 68 through the centre of jaw opening 74. The axis ratio between the longer axis d and the shorter axis e is in the range of about 4 to 3.<br><br>
With this receiving profile 56 also, there runs a tangential plane T, which simultaneously touches the two jaw bars 68 and 70, running substantially parallel to longer axis d of ellipse 76.<br>
Figure 6 depicts a connection of connection profile 50 with the knob bar 20 of double-T-beam 22 and the knob section 58 of Z-sheet pile 14, again depicting the normal setting and the extreme swivel position "upwards" with the swivel angle y shown by dots and the "downwards" swivel position at the swivel angle 5 indicated by dashes. The extreme swivel angle y is about 23° while the extreme swivel angle 5 is about 45°.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show two modifications of connection profile 50. In these two modified connection profiles 50' and 50", the mounting profiles 54' and 54" are configured to match mounting profiles 18' and 18" of the two modified attachment profiles 10' and 10". Said receiving profile 56 of the two modifications 50' and 50" corresponds to receiving profile 56 of connection profile 50.<br>
Figure 9 shows a part of a combination sheet pile wall 80 with two adjoining double-T-beams 22 and two Z-sheet piles 14 situated between them. On one arm with the knob bar 20 of the first double-T-beam 22 shown at left in Figure 9, connection profile 50 is mounted, in which a knob section 58 of the first Z-sheet pile 14 is received. The double-T-beam 22 depicted at right in Figure 9 is turned relative to the first double-T-beam 22 at an angle of about 60°, and on the arm facing the first double-T-beam 22 is provided with connection profile 10, in which claw section 12 of the second Z-sheet pile 14 is received. In the middle between the double-T-beams 22, two Z-sheet piles 14 are hooked together in the known manner, with knob section 58 of the right Z-sheet pile 14 in Figure 9 engaging into claw section 12 of Z-sheet pile 14 depicted at left in Figure 9.<br>
If the above-mentioned extreme swivel angles between the Z-sheet piles 14 and connection profiles 10 and 50 are employed, and likewise the admittedly small<br><br>
swivel angles of about +/- 7" between the knob section 58 and the claw section 12 of Z-sheet pile 14 that engages it, then the angle between the two double-T-beams 22 can be up to 85°.<br>
This can be employed not merely to create closed or curved combination sheet pile walls, or ones provided with an acute angle. Even when, during downward ramming of individual double-T-beams 22, the distances between adjoining double-T-beams 22 vary, or the double-T-beams 22 are twisted relative to each other, such displacements can be compensated for through the configuration of connection profiles 10 and 50.<br><br>
