The present invention relates to a motorcycle in which a case including a voltage controlling regulator and a heat radiation fin, provided on an outer surface thereof, for promoting the radiation of heat from the voltage controlling regulator, and an electrical unit other than the voltage controlling regulator, are mounted to a vehicle body frame, and particularly, to an improvement of an electrical unit layout structure of the motorcycle. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Heretofore, as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 5-9993, there has been known a structure in which an ignition coil, a voltage controlling regulator, and a direction indicating mechanism are mounted concentratively to brackets mounted to a vehicle body frame, thereby improving the working efficiency in an assembling process or in inspection and repair.<br>
Such a conventional structure requires brackets for mounting electrical units to the vehicle body frame; thereby an increase in the number of parts is resulted.<br>
On the other hand, a voltage-controlling regulator is generally accommodated in a case that is provided with fins for enhancing the heat  radiation performance and can be<br><br>
mounted to the vehicle body frame. If other electrical units can be mounted to the vehicle body frame by utilizing such case, it will be possible to make contributions to the reduction in the number of parts used.<br>
The present invention has been accomplished in view of such circumstances and it is an object of the invention to provide an electrical unit layout structure in a motorcycle that permits a plurality of electrical units to be mounted to a vehicle body frame while permitting the reduction in the number of parts used. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
For achieving the above-mentioned object, in a first aspect and feature of the present invention there is provided an electrical unit layout structure in a motorcycle in which a case including a voltage controlling regulator and a heat radiation fin, provided on an outer surface thereof, for promoting the radiation of heat from the voltage controlling regulator, and an electrical unit other than the voltage controlling regulator, are mounted to a vehicle body frame; characterized in that the other electrical unit is mounted to an electrical unit mounting portion integrally formed with the case.<br>
With this arrangement, since an electrical unit mounting portion is integrally formed with a case in which a voltage controlling regulator is originally accommodated and is mounted to a vehicle body frame, and the other electrical unit<br><br>
is mounted to the electrical unit mounting portion, it is not necessary to use any special parts for mounting the electrical units to the vehicle body frame and hence it is possible to reduce the number of parts used. Besides, since not only the portion for accommodating the voltage controlling regulator but also the electrical unit mounting portion for mounting the other electrical unit is integrally formed with the case, it is possible to increase the size of the case and thereby improve the heat radiation performance. Moreover, by assembling not only the voltage-controlling regulator but also the other electrical unit to the case into one unit, it is possible to improve the assembling performance.<br>
In addition to the arrangement of the first feature, the other electrical unit is at least one of an ignition coil and an ignition controller. With this arrangement, by arranging the voltage controlling regulator and the electrical unit associated therewith together in the case, it is possible to facilitate an electrical connection between the electrical units.<br>
Further, in addition to the arrangement of the first or second feature, a luggage box whose upper side is openably and closeably covered with a riding seat is disposed on a rear portion of the vehicle body frame, and the case is disposed at a position ahead of the luggage box and below the riding seat. With this arrangement, a plurality of electrical units, including the voltage controlling regulator, can effectively<br><br>
be disposed within an empty space permitting easy maintenance. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

portion of the box main body 46 from the upper side, and cylindrical metallic collars 72, 72 provided at their upper end with flange portions 72a making contact with the flange portions 48a from the upper side are inserted into the elastic members 48, 48 from the upper side. Bolts 50, 50 inserted through the collars 72, 72 and the support plate 25 from the upper side are mated with and fastened to the weld nuts 49, whereby a front portion of the box main body 46 is elastically supported on the vehicle body frame F through the support plate 25.<br>
At a rear upper portion of the box main body 46, flange portions 51 projected to the upper side of the support blocks 2 8 provided in the vehicle body frame F are provided. The flange portions 51 are elastically supported on the vehicle body frame F through the support blocks 28, by elastic members 52 intermediately disposed between the support blocks 28 and the flange portions 51, weld nuts 53 attached to the lower surfaces of the support blocks 28 at positions corresponding to the elastic members 52, cylindrical metallic collars 73 inserted respectively into the elastic members 52, and bolts 54 inserted through the collars 73 and the support blocks 28 from the upper side and mated with the weld nuts 53, in the same manner as in the elastic support structure of the front portion of the box main body 46 onto the support plate 25.<br>
Further, a seat hinge portion 55 formed to project to the front side is integrally provided at the upper end of a<br><br>
front portion of the box main body 46, and a front end portion of the tandem seat 45 is vertically turnably connected to the seat hinge portion 55.<br>
It should be noted here that a main compartment 56 for containing a helmet not shown or the like, and a battery compartment 57 disposed on the lower side of a rear portion of the main compartment 5 6 are formed in the box main body 4 6, and a cover member 58 partitioning the main compartment 56 and the battery compartment 57 from each other is disposed so as to cover the battery compartment 57.<br>
A pair of positioning grooves 59 for inserting lower portions of the cover member 58 is provided at a bottom portion of the box main body 46 in the luggage box 35, and a lower portion of the cover member 58 is positionedly supported on the bottom portion of the box main body 46 in the luggage box 35. Opposite sides of an upper portion of the cover member 58 are clamped to the box main body 46 with screw members 62, whereby the upper portion of the cover member 58 is removably fixed to the box main body 46.<br>
That is, the lower portion of the cover member 58 covering the battery compartment 57 so as to partition the battery compartment 57 from the main compartment 56 is positionedly supported at the bottom portion of the box main body 46, and the upper portion of the cover member 58 is detachably fixed to the box main body 46, so that the main compartment 56 and the battery compartment 57 can be formed in<br><br>
the box main body 46 of the luggage box 35 with clear distinction therebetween.<br>
The battery compartment 57 is formed between the cover member 58 and a lower portion of the rear wall 46a of the box main body 46, and a battery 63 is contained within the battery compartment 57. Further, a starter relay and a fuse (neither shown) are also contained within the battery compartment 57 so as to be positioned on opposite sides of the battery 63, Thus, not only the battery 63 but also electrical components associated with the battery 63 are also accommodated effectively within the battery compartment 57.<br>
An opening 66 is formed in an upper portion of the rear wall 46a of the box main body 46, and the wall member 47 is fixed to the rear wall 46a at the peripheral edge of the opening 66 by heat-caulking for example. The wall member 47 is formed so as to expand backward from the upper portion of the rear wall 46a and so as to avoid interference with the first cross member 23 of the vehicle body frame F. Consequently, a small article compartment 67 communicating with a rear upper portion of the main compartment 56 can be formed easily within the wall member 47. Since the wall member 47 is formed so as to expand backward from the upper portion of the rear wall 46a of the box main body 46, the small article compartment 67 is also formed so as to expand backward from the upper portion of the rear wall 46a.<br>
Besides, the luggage box 35 comprises the box main body<br><br>
46 having the main compartment 56 and the battery compartment 57, and the wall member 47 which defines the small article compartment 67 communicating with the main compartment 56 and is fixed to the rear wall 46a of the box main body 46, resulting that the main compartment 56, the battery compartment 57 located at a rear lower position with respect to the main compartment 56, and the small article compartment 67 which is expanded backward from the main compartment 56 so as to communicate with the rear upper portion of the main compartment 56, are formed within the luggage box 35.<br>
An opening end of the small article compartment 67 on the s ide of the main compartment 56 is openably covered by a synthetic resin made lid 68, and the lid 68 is formed in connection with the upper portion of the cover member 58. A connecting portion between the cover member 58 and the lid 68 is formed to function as a hinge 59 by reducing its material thickness, and the lid 68 connected to the cover member 58 through the hinge 69 can be turned between a position for closing the opening end of the small article compartment 67 on the side of the main compartment 56 as indicated by solid line in FIG. 2, and a position for opening the opening end of the small article compartment 67 on the side of the main compartment 56 as indicated by chain line in FIG. 2. Thus, the open end on the main compartment 56 side of the small article compartment 67 can be opened and closed easily.<br>
For retaining the position of closing the open end on<br><br>
the main compartment 56 side of the small article compartment 67, for example a pair of engaging claws 70 are integrally provided with an upper portion of the lid 68. The engaging claws 70 are engaged disengageably with the rear wall 46a of the box main body 46 at a position higher than the opening 66.<br>
Thus, with the luggage box 35 including the main compartment 56, the battery compartment 57 located at a rear lower position with respect to the main compartment 56, and the small article compartment 67 which is rearwardly expanded from the main compartment 56 in communication with the rear upper portion of the main storage chamber, the battery compartment 57 which requires a relatively large space is disposed at a rear lower position with respect to the main compartment 56 within the luggage box 35, whereby the capacities of components for the motorcycle such as the fuel tank 29 disposed on the rear side of the luggage box 35 are not required to be set relatively small in relation to the battery compartment 57, but can be set relatively large while ensuring a space for containing the battery 63 therein. Besides, since the small article compartment 67, whose capacity can be set small, is formed in an expanded state to the rear side from the main compartment 56 so as to communicate with the rear upper portion of the main storage chamber, it is possible to ensure the space for the storage compartment 67 while diminishing the influence on setting the capacity of such a component for the motorcycle as the fuel<br><br>
tank 29.<br>
Referring also to Fig. 4, a voltage controlling regulator 75 and at least one (both in this embodiment) of an ignition coil 76 and an ignition controller 77 which are electrical units different from the voltage controlling regulator 75 are disposed at a position ahead of the luggage box 35 and below the tandem seat 45.<br>
The voltage-controlling regulator 75 is accommodated within a regulator storage portion 78a that is formed in a case 78 made of an aluminum alloy for example. The regulator storage portion 78a is formed in the shape of a rectangular box whose lower portion is open. The voltage-controlling regulator 75 is contained within the regulator storage portion 78a so as to be molded with a synthetic resin, and a coupler 75a of the voltage-controlling regulator 75 is projected downwardly from the regulator storage portion 78a. Further, a plurality of heat radiation fins 79 for promoting the radiation of heat from the voltage-controlling regulator 75 are projected from an outer surface of the regulator storage portion 78a.<br>
First, second, and third electrical unit mounting portions 78b, 78c, 78d are integrally with the case 78. The first electrical unit mounting portion 78b is formed in the shape of a rectangular box whose lower portion is open, and is integrally contiguous to a rear portion of the regulator storage portion 78a,  with a rectangular opening 80 being<br><br>
formed in the first electrical unit mounting portion 78b.<br>
The ignition controller 77 is accommodated in the first electrical unit mounting portion 78b in a state where part of the ignition controller 77 is facing the opening 80, and is fixed to the first electrical unit mounting portion 78b with a plurality of, for example three screw members 81. Further, a coupler 77a of the ignition controller 77 is projected downwardly from the first electrical unit mounting portion 78b.<br>
The second and third electrical unit mounting portions 78c and 78d are extended sideways in parallel with each other from the regulator storage portion 78a and the first electrical unit mounting portion 78b. The ignition coil 76 is mounted to the second and third electrical unit mounting portions 78c and 78d. More specifically, the ignition coil 76 is provided with a pair of arm portions 76a, 76a that are mounted on the second and third electrical unit mounting portions 78c and 78d, respectively. The arm portions 76a, 76a are clamped to the second and third electrical unit mounting portions 78c and 78d with bolts 82, 82.<br>
In this way, the ignition coil 76 and the ignition controller 77 are mounted in the case 78 that stores the voltage-controlling regulator 75 therein.<br>
A front support plate 78e projecting forward from the regulator storage portion 78a and a rear support plate 78f projecting backward from a front end portion of the third electrical unit mounting portion 78d are integrally formed<br><br>
with the case 78. On the other hand, a flat plate-shaped bracket 83 which comes into abutment against the front support plate 78e from below is welded to the main frame 13 of the vehicle body frame F, and a bolt 85 is inserted through the front support plate 78e and the bracket 83 and is threadedly engaged with a weld nut 84 which is fixed to an underside of the bracket 83. The rear support plate 78f is put in abutment against an upper surface of the support plate 25 that is mounted bridgewise between both rear frames 14. A bolt 87 is inserted through the rear support plate 78f and the support plate 25 and is threadedly engaged with a weld nut 86 that is fixed to the underside of the support plate 25.<br>
By tightening the bolts 85 and 87 which are threadedly engaged with the weld nuts 84 and 86 respectively, the case 78 is mounted to the vehicle body frame F so that the coupler 75a of the voltage controlling regulator 75 and the coupler 77a of the ignition controller 77 are disposed on the right side of the main frame 13.<br>
The operation of this embodiment will now be described. The case 78, which includes the voltage-controlling regulator 75 and the heat radiating fins 79, provided on the surface thereof, for promoting the radiation of heat from the regulator 75, are mounted to the vehicle body frame F. The ignition coil 76 and the ignition controller 77 which are the electrical units other than the voltage-controlling regulator 75 are mounted to the case 78.  Thus, it is not necessary to<br><br>
use any special parts for mounting such electrical units as the voltage controlling regulator 75, the ignition coil 76 and the ignition controller 77 to the vehicle body frame F, thereby making it possible to reduce the number of parts used.<br>
Besides, in addition to the regulator storage portion 78a for containing the voltage controlling regulator 75 therein, the first electrical unit mounting portion 78b for accommodating and mounting the ignition controller 77 and the second and third electrical unit mounting portions 78c and 78d for mounting the ignition coil 76 are integrally formed with the case 78. Thus, it is possible to increase the size of the case 78 and thereby improve the heat radiation performance.<br>
Moreover, assembling such other electrical units as the ignition coil 76 and the ignition controller 77, in addition to the voltage controlling regulator 75, to the case 78, into one unit, it is possible to improve the assembling performance.<br>
Further, since at least one (both in this embodiment) of the ignition coil 76 and the ignition controller 77 is mounted to the case 78 which accommodates the voltage controlling regulator 75, the regulator 75 and an electrical unit associated therewith can together be disposed within the case 78, whereby it is possible to facilitate an electrical connection among the regulator 75, the ignition coil 76 and -<br><br>
the ignition controller 77.<br>
Further, since the case 78 is disposed at a position ahead of the storage box 35 and below the tandem seat 45, a plurality of electrical units 76 and 77, including the voltage-controlling regulator 75, can be disposed effectively within an empty space in which maintenance is facilitated.<br>
Although an embodiment of the present invention has been described above, the invention is not limited to the above embodiment, but various design modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention defined in the claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
