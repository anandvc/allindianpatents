				<td>OPEN DRIVE SCROLL MACHINE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]The present invention relates to open drive scroll machines. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to scroll compressors which are exteriorly<br>
driven and which incorporate a unique two speed drive system for the open drive<br>
scroll machine.<br>
Background and Summary of the Invention<br>
[0002] Scroll type machines are becoming more and more popular for use as<br>
compressors in both refrigeration as well as air conditioning applications due<br>
primarily to their capability for extremely efficient operation. Generally, these<br>
machines incorporate scroll members having a pair of intermeshed spiral wraps,<br>
one of which is caused to orbit relative to the other so as to define one or more<br>
moving chambers which progressively decrease in size as they travel from an outer<br>
suction port toward a center discharge port. Some type of power unit is provided<br>
which operates to drive the orbiting scroll member via a suitable drive shaft. The<br>
bottom or lower portion of the housing which contains the scroll members normally<br>
contains an oil sump for lubrication of the various components of the compressor.<br>
1<br><br>
[0003] Scroll machines can be separated into two categories based upon the<br>
power unit which drives the scroll member. The first category is scroll machines<br>
which have the power unit located within the housing along with the scroll members.<br>
The housing containing the power unit and the scroll members can be open to the<br>
environment or it can be sealed to provide a hermetic scroll machine wherein the<br>
housing also contains the working fluid of the scroll machine. The second category<br>
of scroll machines is scroll machines which have the power unit separate from the<br>
housing containing the scroll members. These machines are called open drive<br>
scroll machines and the housing which contains the scroll members is normally<br>
sealed from the environment such that the housing also contains the working fluid of<br>
the scroll machine. The power unit for these open drive scroll machines can be<br>
provided by a drive belt and a pulley system, a gear drive system, a direct drive<br>
system or any other type of drive system.<br>
[0004]The above categories of scroll machines can each be further<br>
subdivided into two additional categories of whether the scroll members are<br>
positioned vertically which is most common with the hermetic compressors or<br>
whether the scroll members are positioned horizontally which is most common with<br>
the open drive type of scroll machines.<br>
[0005] Both the vertical and the horizontal positioned scroll machines perform<br>
satisfactorily in their respective market. Typically the power unit for these scroll<br>
machines is a single speed drive or a more expensive variable speed drive system.<br>
2.<br><br>
Various applications for scroll machines would benefit if a scroll machine had a low<br>
speed capability and a high speed capability. These two speed scroll machines<br>
could be produced at a cost significantly lower than the variable speed scroll<br>
machines and thus inexpensively satisfy the market for the applications which would<br>
benefit from a scroll machine having a low capacity capability and a high speed<br>
capability.<br>
[0006]The present invention discloses a unique two speed drive system for<br>
an open drive horizontal scroll machine which functions to operate the scroll<br>
machine at a low speed capability when the scroll machine demand is low and a<br>
high speed capability when the scroll machine demand is high. A unique planetary<br>
gear system is positioned between the power unit and the drive shaft of the scroll<br>
machine to provide the two speed capability.<br>
[0007] Other advantages and objects of the present invention will become<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art from the subsequent detailed description,<br>
appended claims and drawings.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
[0008] In the drawings which illustrate the best mode presently contemplated<br>
for carrying out the present invention:<br>

machine incorporating the unique drive system in accordance with the present<br>
invention; and<br>

[0010]Figure 2 is a vertical cross-section of an open drive horizontal scroll<br>
machine incorporating the unique drive system in accordance with another<br>
embodiment of the present-invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0011 ] Referring now to the drawing, there is shown in Figure 1 an open drive<br>
horizontal scroll compressor which incorporates a unique two speed drive system in<br>
accordance with the present invention which is designated generally by reference<br>
numeral 10. Compressor 10 comprises a compressor body 12, a cap assembly 14,<br>
a main bearing housing 16, an oil pump assembly 18, a lower bearing assembly 20,<br>
an orbiting scroll member 22, a non-orbiting scroll member 24 and a two speed<br>
drive system 26. Compressor body 12 is a generally cup shaped member,<br>
preferably made from aluminum defining an internal cavity 28 within which is located<br>
main bearing housing 16, an internal bore 30 for mating with oil pump assembly 18<br>
and lower bearing assembly 20 and a suction inlet 32 for mating with the<br>
refrigeration circuit associated with compressor 10. Compressor body 12, cap<br>
assembly 14 and lower bearing assembly 20 define a sealed chamber 34 within<br>
which scroll members 22 and 24 are disposed.<br>
[0012]Cap assembly 14 comprises an adapter plate 36, a partition 38, a cap<br>
40, a discharge fitting 42 and a temperature probe 44. Adapter plate 36 is secured<br>
to compressor body 12 using a plurality of bolts 46. Partition 38 is welded about its<br>
4<br><br>
periphery to adapter plate 36 at the same point that cap 40 is welded to partition 38.<br>
Partition 38 separates chamber 34 into a suction chamber 48 and a discharge<br>
chamber 50. Discharge fitting 42 extends through cap 40 and provides a discharge<br>
gas outlet from discharge chamber 50 to the refrigeration circuit associated with<br>
compressor 10. Temperature probe 44 extends through cap 40 and partition 38<br>
such that it is located within a discharge recess 52 located within non-orbiting scroll<br>
member 24. A dynamic discharge valve assembly 54 is located within discharge<br>
recess 52 and is retained within recess 52 by a nut threadingly received within<br>
recess 52.<br>
[0013] Main bearing housing 16 is press fit into cavity 28 of compressor body<br>
12 and rests against a shoulder 56 formed by cavity 28. The surface of main<br>
bearing housing 16 opposite to shoulder 56 is provided with a flat thrust bearing<br>
surface 58 against which is located orbiting scroll member 22 which has a usual<br>
spiral vane or wrap 60. Projecting opposite to wrap 60 is a cylindrical hub 62 having<br>
a journal bearing in which is rotatively disposed a drive bushing 66. An Oldham<br>
coupling 70 is also provided positioned between orbiting scroll member 22 and<br>
bearing housing 16. Oldham coupling 70 is keyed to orbiting scroll member 22 and<br>
non-orbiting scroll member 24 to prevent rotational movement of orbiting scroll<br>
member 22. Oldham coupling 70 is preferably of the type disclosed in assignee's<br>
U.S. Letters Patent 5,320,506, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
5<br><br>
[0014] Non-orbiting scroll member 24 is also provided with a wrap 72<br>
positioned in meshing engagement with wrap 60 of orbiting scroll member 22. Non-<br>
orbiting scroll member 24 has a centrally disposed passage which communicates<br>
with discharge recess 52 through discharge valve assembly 54 which is in turn in<br>
communication with discharge chamber 50 defined by cap 40 and partition 38. An<br>
annular recess 76 is also formed in non-orbiting scroll member 24 within which is<br>
disposed a seal assembly 78. Recesses 52 and 76 and seal assembly 78<br>
cooperate to define axial pressure biasing chambers which receive pressurized fluid<br>
being compressed by wraps 60 and 72 so as to exert an axial biasing force on non-<br>
orbiting scroll member 24 to thereby urge the tips of respective wraps 60 and 72 into<br>
sealing engagement with the opposed end plate surfaces. Seal assembly 78 is<br>
preferably of the type described in greater detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,156,539, the<br>
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Non-orbiting scroll<br>
member 24 is designed to be mounted to bearing housing 16 in a suitable manner<br>
such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,877,382 or U.S. Patent No. 5,102,316both<br>
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0015] A steel drive shaft or crankshaft 80 having an eccentric crank pin at<br>
one end thereof is rotatably journalled in a sleeve bearing 84 in main bearing<br>
housing 16 and a roller bearing 86 in lower bearing assembly 20. The crank pin is<br>
drivingly disposed within the inner bore of drive bushing 66. The crank pin has a flat<br>
on one surface which drivingly engages a fiat surface (not shown) formed in a<br>
6<br><br>
portion of the bore of drive bushing 66 to provide a radially compliant drive<br>
arrangement, such as shown in assignee's aforementioned U.S. Letters Patent<br>
4,877,382. Crankshaft 80 includes an axialiy extending bore which intersects with a<br>
radial inlet bore and a radial outlet bore. The end of crankshaft 80 opposite to the<br>
crank pin extends through lower bearing assembly 20 and is adapted to be<br>
connected to two speed drives system 26 which is being used to power crank shaft<br>
80.<br>
[0016]Oil pump assembly 18 is disposed within chamber 34 in concentric<br>
relationship to drive shaft 80. Oil pump assembly 18 comprises a housing, a pump<br>
body, a drive member and a plurality of vanes. The housing is secured to<br>
compressor body 12 using a plurality of bolts. The housing defines an oil inlet<br>
passage and an oil outlet passage. The pump body is secured to the housing using<br>
a plurality of bolts and thus the pump body is stationary. The pump body defines a<br>
pumping chamber within which the plurality of vanes are located. The drive<br>
member is drivingly secured to the drive shaft 80 such that rotation of drive shaft 80<br>
causes rotation of the drive member. Rotation of drive shaft 80 causes rotation of<br>
the drive member which in turn causes rotation of the plurality or vanes in the<br>
pumping chamber and the pumping of oil between the inlet passage which is in<br>
communication with a supply passage which extends through compressor body 12<br>
and which is in communication with an oil sump 102 located within sealed chamber<br>
34 through a filter. The outlet passage is in communication with a supply passage<br>
7<br><br>
which extends through compressor body 12 and is in communication with a filter<br>
chamber 106 formed by compressor body 12. An oil filter 108 is disposed within<br>
chamber 106 and chamber 106 is closed by a filter cap 110 which is secure to<br>
compressor body 12 using a plurality of bolts. Oil filter 108 is located between the<br>
supply passage and a return passage which leads back to oil sump 102. A spring<br>
112 biases oil filter 108 away from filter cap 110 to ensure oil flows through filter 108<br>
before entering the return passage. The return passage is a stepped diameter<br>
passage which restricts oil flow to increase the oil pressure thereby providing oil to<br>
the moving components of compressor 10.<br>
[0017] Lower bearing assembly 20 comprises roller bearing 86 and a snap<br>
ring 114. Roller bearing 86 is disposed between drive shaft 80 and the housing of<br>
oil pump assembly 18 and snap ring 114 positions bearing 86 against a shoulder on<br>
drive shaft 80. A bearing spacer and a Belville spring are positioned between two<br>
speed drive system 26 and the outer race of bearing 86 to properly locate bearing<br>
86.<br>
[0018]Two speed drive system 26 comprises a planetary gear set 120, a<br>
clutch assembly 122 and an end cap assembly 124. Planetary gear set 120<br>
comprises a sun gear 130, a plurality of planet gears 132 and a ring gear 134. Sun<br>
gear 130 is attached to drive shaft 80. The plurality of planet gears 132 are meshed<br>
with sun gear 130 and are attached to an input shaft 136. Input shaft 136 extends<br>
through end cap assembly 124 and provides for the driving input to power two<br>
8<br><br>
speed drive system 26 and thus drive shaft 80. A one-way clutch 138 is disposed<br>
between input shaft 136 and sun gear 130. One-way clutch 138 allows sun gear<br>
130 to rotate faster than input shaft 136 but will provide driving power from input<br>
shaft 136 to sun gear 130 when necessary as detailed below. Ring gear 134 is in<br>
mesh with the plurality of planet gears 132 and is rotatably disposed within<br>
compressor body 12.<br>
[0019]Clutch assembly 122 comprises a clutch housing 140, a piston 142 a<br>
biasing member on spring 144 and a clutch plate 146. Clutch housing 140 is<br>
attached to compressor body 12 and is thus prohibited from rotation with respect to<br>
compressor body 12. Piston 142 and compressor body 12 define a chamber 148.<br>
An inlet port 150 extends through compressor body 12 to provide communication<br>
with chamber 148. A fluid pressure line 152 extends between inlet port 150 and<br>
discharge chamber 50. A solenoid valve 154 controls the flow of pressurized fluid<br>
through fluid pressure line 152.<br>
[0020]Spring 144 biases piston 142 to the right as shown in Figure 1 to<br>
engage clutch assembly 122. In its engaged position, clutch assembly 122 prohibits<br>
rotation of ring gear 134. With ring gear 134 locked, power from input shaft 136 is<br>
provided to planet gears 132 providing an increase in speed for sun gear 130. The<br>
increase in speed for sun gear 130 is facilitated by the incorporation off one-way<br>
clutch 138 which permits the faster rotation of sun gear 130. Sun gear 130 is<br>
attached to drive shaft 80 for powering compressor 10.    Thus, when clutch<br>
9<br><br>
assembly 122 is engaged, planetary gear set 120 increases the speed between<br>
input shaft 136 and drive shaft 80 to provide a high-speed capability for two speed<br>
drive system 26. The amount of speed increase between input shaft 136 and drive<br>
shaft 80 will be determined by the diameter of ring gear 134 and the diameter of sun<br>
gear 130.<br>
[0021]When low speed operation for two speed drive system 26 of<br>
compressor 10 is desired, solenoid valve 154 is activated to place chamber 148 in<br>
communication with discharge chamber 50 through pressure line 152 and inlet port<br>
150. Pressurize fluid within chamber 148 reacts against piston 142 to move piston<br>
142 to the left as shown in Figure 1 to release ring gear 134 for rotation. Typically,<br>
in a planetary gear train, input power drives one member, the second member is<br>
driven to provide the output and the third member is fixed. If the third member is not<br>
fixed, no power is delivered. One-way clutch 138 is incorporated to provide low<br>
speed operation of two speed drive system 26. When solenoid valve 154 is<br>
energized and chamber 148 is pressurized, clutch assembly 122 releases ring gear<br>
134 for rotation. Sun gear 130 is no longer powered by planet gears 132 and thus<br>
sun gear 130 will begin to slow down. Sun gear 130 wiil slow down until one-way<br>
clutch 138 engages thus equalizing the speed between input shaft 136 and sun<br>
gear 130 resulting in a one-to-one or low speed rotation for two speed drive system<br>
26.<br>
10<br><br>
[0022] When it is desired to return to the high speed operation of two-speed<br>
drive system 26, pressurized fluid within chamber 148 is released into sealed<br>
chamber 34 by solenoid valve 154. The release of pressurized fluid from chamber<br>
148 causes springs 144 to again move piston 142 to the right as shown in Figure 1<br>
engaging clutch assembly 122 to place two-speed drive system 26 in its high-speed<br>
condition.<br>
[0023]SeaIed chamber 34 is closed by an end cover assembly 160 which<br>
comprises a cover plate 162 and a bearing cover 164. Bearing cover 164 defines<br>
an internal chamber 166 having a plurality of circumferentially spaced radially<br>
extending ribs which position a spacer 168 and a plurality of seals 170 between<br>
input shaft 136 and bearing cover 164. Input shaft 136 extends through bearing<br>
cover 164 and is adapted for connection to an external power supply by methods<br>
known well in the art.<br>
[0024] Thus, the incorporation of planetary gear set 120 and clutch assembly<br>
122 provide a simple and relatively inexpensive method for providing a two-speed<br>
capability for compressor 10.<br>
[0025] Referring now to Figure 2, an open drive horizontal scroll compressor<br>
which incorporates a unique two-speed drive system in accordance with another<br>
embodiment of the present invention is illustrated and is designated generally by the<br>
reference numeral 210.<br>
11<br><br>
[0026] Compressor 210 is the same as compressor 10 except that clutch<br>
assembly 122 has been replaced by clutch assembly or solenoid valve assembly<br>
222. Solenoid valve assembly 222 comprises a solenoid core 224, a solenoid coil<br>
226 and clutch plate 146.<br>
[0027]At low input speeds or when high compressor capacity demand<br>
requirements are present, solenoid coil 226 is energized, thus attracting clutch plate<br>
146 and locking it to solenoid core 224. In this locked position, rotation of ring gear<br>
134 is prohibited. With ring gear 134 locked, power from input shaft 136 is provided<br>
to planet gears 132 which results in an increase in speed for sun gear 130. The<br>
increase in speed for sun gear 130 is facilitated by the incorporation of one-way<br>
clutch 138 which permits the faster rotation of sun gear 130. Sun gear 130 is<br>
attached to drive shaft 80 for powering compressor 210. Thus, when solenoid coil<br>
226 is energized, planetary gear set 120 increases the speed between input shaft<br>
136 and drive shaft 80 to provide a high-speed capability for two speed drive system<br>
26. The amount of speed increase between input shaft 136 and drive shaft 80 will<br>
be determined by the diameter of ring gear 134 and the diameter of sun gear 130.<br>
[0028]At higher input speeds or when lower compressor capacity demand<br>
requirements are present, solenoid coil 226 is de-energized which results in<br>
disengaging solenoid core 224 from clutch plate 146 which allows rotation of ring<br>
gear 134. Typically, in a planetary gear train, input power drives one member, the<br>
second member is provided to the output and the third member is fixed. If the third<br>
12.<br><br>
member is not fixed, no power is delivered. One-way clutch 138 is incorporated to<br>
provide low speed operation of two speed drive system 26. When solenoid coil 226<br>
is de-energized, clutch assembly or solenoid valve 222 releases ring gear 134 for<br>
rotation. Sun gear 130 is no longer powered by planet gears 132 and thus, sun<br>
gear 130 will begin to slow down. Sun gear 130 will slow down until one-way clutch<br>
138 engages, thus equalizing the speed between input shaft 136 and sun gear 130<br>
resulting in a one-to-one or low speed rotation for two-speed drive system 26.<br>
[0029]When it is desired to return to the high speed operation of two-speed<br>
drive system 26, solenoid coil 226 can be energized again to engage clutch plate<br>
146 with solenoid core 224 to plate two-speed drive system 26 in its high-speed<br>
condition.<br>
[0030]Thus, the incorporation of planetary gear set 120 and solenoid valve<br>
assembly 222 provide a simple and relatively inexpensive method for providing a<br>
two-speed capability for compressor 210.<br>
[0031]Two-speed drive system 26 with clutch assembly 122 or solenoid<br>
valve assembly 222 can be utilized to drive any other type of open-drive positive<br>
displacement compressor. While two-speed drive system 26 with clutch assembly<br>
122 on solenoid valve assembly 222 have been illustrated as being located within<br>
sealed chamber 34, it is within the scope of the present invention to mount two-<br>
speed drive system 26 external to the compressor or sealed chamber 34. When<br>
13<br><br>
mounted externally to the compressor or sealed chamber 34, two-speed drive<br>
system 26 can be packaged together with a drive pulley and the drive pulley clutch.<br>
[0032] While two-speed drive system 26 is illustrated in use with a horizontal<br>
compressor, it can be integrated into a vertical hermetic compressor, if desired.<br>
Preferably, in the vertical hermetic compressor, two-speed drive system 26 is<br>
positioned between the motor rotor and the lower bearing. The sun gear is attached<br>
to the crankshaft, the rotor of the motor has bearings so it can rotate on the<br>
compressor shaft with the speed differential being between the crankshaft and the<br>
rotor. The rotor would then drive the planetary gear housing assembly. With the<br>
implementation of the above described mechanism, two-speed operation can be<br>
achieved using a single speed motor and because of the increased or high speed<br>
operation, larger compressor capabilities can be achieved in a smaller compressor<br>
frame or shell diameter.<br>
[0033] While the above detailed description describes the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, it should be understood that the present<br>
invention is susceptible to modification, variation and alteration without deviating<br>
from the scope and fair meaning of the subjoined claims.<br>
