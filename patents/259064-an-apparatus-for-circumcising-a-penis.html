Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a type of medical apparatus, especially the<br>
provision of a type of circumcision apparatus.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Redundant prepuce or phimosis is one of the origins of male urinary<br>
system infection and sexually transmitted diseases. Redundant prepuce or<br>
phimosis can cause urinary tract infection that will lead to chronic prostatitis,<br>
which will incur a series of symptoms like back pain, impotence and<br>
prospermia, etc. Therefore, removing redundant foreskin or phimosis is one of<br>
the good measures to prevent these diseases.<br>
Regarding the removal of redundant foreskin or phimosis, there has been<br>
several reforms from the early days of the founding of PRC to the present, but<br>
the operation will inevitably lead to bleeding, pain and hospitalization.<br>
Circumcision is one of the traditional measures to cure phimosis and redundant<br>
prepuce and prevent their complication, which belongs to the basic operation<br>
of male urological department and its technical essential is the three major<br>
steps of redundant foreskin removal, hemostasia, and apposition suture at the<br>
incisal edge. After the operation, the patient can not walk, and he will feel<br>
intolerably painful at each change of dressing and suffer great pain in the end<br>
at removal of stitches. Furthermore, if hemostasis by ligation is done by halves,<br>
it will cause preputial hematoma □ then another surgical treatment is necessary.<br>
Though laser and high-frequency electric-knife technology have been used in<br>
foreskin circumcision, they have only substituted scissors cutting and<br>
solidified the bleeding spot. Such a therapeutic method is likely to subject the<br>
patient to tissular burn and infection, while the expenditure for infection<br>
prevention is very high. Judged from the comparison among various provinces<br>
and cities, whenever laser circumcision is performed, treatment by antibiotics<br><br>
after the operation for 5-7days plus prevention of infection by taking<br>
antibiotics orally for 5-7 days is very common, while the cost generally ranges<br>
from 150 to 360 yuan, and the total cost of treatment is at least 1000-15OOyuan.<br>
The existing technology has produced some solutions of circumcision<br>
apparatus. These circumcision apparatus are simple and easily applicable, and<br>
no surgery and suture is necessary. As a result, the pain is very light, the<br>
patient's work and life will not be affected, and the operation time is short.<br>
Nevertheless, these circumcision apparatus have the following common<br>
defects:<br>
1.	A type of circumcision apparatus, its blade conjoint part of the two<br>
semi-ferrules of the retaining ring is of right-angle structure. When the penis is<br>
clamped with two semi-ferrules, the foreskin will be easily clamped by the<br>
conjoined part of the blade □ which makes the patient very painful.<br>
2.	Since it is inevitable for infection to occur during circumcision,<br>
medicament is needed to cooperate with the treatment so as to eliminate<br>
inflammation and grow the skin, etc. However, the existing circumcision<br>
apparatus itself does not design the corresponding structure, and the<br>
anti-inflammation treatment is carried out by such traditional external<br>
antiphlogistic manner as injection, oral administration, etc.<br>
3.	The locking device of the existing circumcision apparatus generally<br>
adopts screw fixation □ therefore manual manipulation is very inconvenient,<br>
and it is extremely afflictive for the patients who will undergo the surgical<br>
operation, which increases their fear of operation and lengthens the operation<br>
time. Several kinds of connecting structure are introduced as follows.<br>
4.	The balanus ferrule of existing circumcision apparatus is a circular<br>
structure, however, the penis will inevitably erect and enlarge in the entire<br>
course of treatment and such a structure with fixed balanus ferrule diameter<br>
adds to the discomfort of the patients.<br>
5.	A type of circumcision apparatus □ which includes a retaining ring and<br><br>
auxiliary ring. Put the glans penis through the auxiliary ring, and place the<br>
foreskin between the auxiliary ring and the retaining ring, and then tie it to the<br>
auxiliary ring with the binding string. In this way, when the penis is expanding,<br>
because the elasticity of the binding string is weak, and its contact area with<br>
the foreskin is small, the binding string and the foreskin may move relatively,<br>
resulting in incomplete blockage of the blood stream, which will produce<br>
hematoma and affect the surgical effect.<br>
6. Also, as stated in item 5 □during real operation, since the binding string is<br>
bound by hand, it is often operated entirely by right of experience according to<br>
the habit of the operator. As a result, the degrees of tightness are varied,<br>
resulting in non-standardization of the entire process of operation, which in<br>
turn affects the effect of the surgery.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The main purpose of this invention lies in overcoming the deficiency of the<br>
existing technology and providing a kind of novel disposable apparatus for<br>
circumcising a penis that requires no surgery during treatment period with no<br>
leeding, no suture, no medication, no pain, low cost and handy and<br>
comfortable use.<br>
In order to realize the above mentioned purpose, this invention adopts a<br>
technical solution as follows: a type of circumcision apparatus, which includes<br>
a fastening device and a balanus ferrule, of which: the fixture has an opening,<br>
and mutually corresponding upper-blade conjoint part and lower-blade<br>
conjoint part are provided on either end of the opening. Round angles are<br>
provided at the edges of the upper blade conjoined part and the lower blade<br>
conjoined part.<br><br>
Two or more the first grooves are provided at the edges of the balanus<br>
ferrule and the first protuberance is formed among the first grooves;<br>
There are two or more the second protuberances that interact with the first<br>
grooves at the inner edge of the fixture device and the second grooves are<br>
formed among the second protuberances;<br>
The second grooves and the first protuberances interact to form a cavity to<br>
hold medicine solution; and a passage for injection is formed on the fixture<br>
device and inter-connects with the cavity.<br>
The balanus ferrule is composed of right and left semi-ferrules that are<br>
separated from each other; a round angle is provided at the connexion of right<br>
and left semi-ferrules.<br>
The first scalariform detent block is installed at tip of the opening with<br>
Upper blade conjoined part, while the second scalariform detent block is<br>
installed at the tip of the opening with Lower blade conjoined part; and the first<br>
scalariform detent block interacts with the second scalariform detent block.<br>
The first scalariform detent block lies under Upper blade conjoined part,<br>
while the second scalariform detent block lies above Lower blade conjoined<br>
part.<br>
The fixture device is composed of two semi-ferrules and a Connecting buckle.<br>
These two semi-ferrules is inter-connected at one end through the Connecting<br>
buckle, while the other ends of the two semi-ferrules are locked with a screw<br>
rod. One semi-ferrule of the two has an upper blade conjoined part. The other<br>
semi-ferrule has a lower blade conjoined part that corresponds with the upper<br>
blade conjoined part. Round angles are provided at the edges of the upper<br>

The fixture device is composed of two semi-ferrules and a Connecting<br>
buckle. These two semi-ferrules is inter-connected at one end through the<br><br>
Connecting buckle, while the other ends of the two semi-ferrules are provided<br>
with L-shaped parts interacting with each other. Connecting rod shaft is<br>
installed at the top of L-shaped parts. Attachment holes are provided at the<br>
bottom platform of the L-shaped parts. The Connecting rod shaft interacts with<br>
the attachment hole of the other semi-ferrule. Toothlike protuberance or<br>
toothlike groove is provided at the inner side of the upstanding end of<br>
L-shaped part. The toothlike protuberance or toothlike groove interacts with<br>
that of the other semi-ferrule. One semi-ferrule of the two has an upper blade<br>
conjoined part. The other semi-ferrule has a lower blade conjoined part that<br>
corresponds with the upper blade conjoined part. Round angles are provided at<br>
the edges of the upper blade conjoined part and the lower blade conjoined part,<br>
one or more Connecting rod shaft is installed at the top of L-shaped parts,<br>

The fixture device is composed of two semi-ferrules and a Connecting<br>
buckle. These two semi-ferrules is inter-connected at one end through the<br>
Connecting buckle, while the other ends of the two semi-ferrules are provided<br>
with uncinate heave or slotted hole respectively. The uncinate heave or slotted<br>
hole interacts with that of the other semi-ferrule. The uncinate heave consists<br>
of joint plate and Clamping piece which is of D-shaped structure. The joint<br>
plate connects with the tip of semi-ferrule at one end and with the central part<br>
of Clamping piece at the other end. One semi-ferrule of the two has an upper<br>
blade conjoined part. The other semi-ferrule has a lower blade conjoined part<br>
that corresponds with the upper blade conjoined part. Round angles are<br>
provided at the edges of the upper blade conjoined part and the lower blade<br>

of a bow tie. One semi-ferrule of the two has an upper blade conjoined part.<br>
The other semi-ferrule has a lower blade conjoined part that corresponds with<br>
the upper blade conjoined part. Round angles are provided at the edges of the<br>
upper blade conjoined part and the lower blade conjoined part.<br>
The fixture device is composed of two semi-ferrules and a Connecting<br>
buckle. These two semi-ferrules is inter-connected at one end through the<br>
Connecting buckle, while the other ends of the two semi-ferrules are provided<br>
with strip-shaped gear body or strip-shaped sprocket hole respectively. The<br>
strip-shaped gear body or strip-shaped sprocket hole interacts with that of the<br>
other semi-ferrule. One semi-ferrule of the two has an upper blade conjoined<br>
part. The other semi-ferrule has a lower blade conjoined part that corresponds<br>
with the upper blade conjoined part. Round angles are provided at the edges of<br>
the upper blade conjoined part and the lower blade conjoined part.<br>
The highly efficient and hygienic germfree material enables the patient to<br>
keep from infection when in use which will bring about greater pain and<br>
unnecessary trouble. Also, this invention is rendered as disposables which are<br>
more hygienic and safer. .<br>
The apparatus for circumcising a redundancy provided by this invention<br>
retains the characteristics of no surgical operation, no suture and low degree of<br>
pain that are intrinsic of the circumcision apparatus, at the same time a great<br>
deal of improvement has been made addressing the many deficiencies of the<br>
existing circumcision apparatus, which, to be specific, includes:<br>
1. An existing circumcision apparatus, its blade conjoint part of the two<br>
semi-ferrules of the retaining ring is of right-angle structure. When the penis is<br>
clamped with two semi-ferrules, the foreskin will be easily clamped by the<br>
conjoined part of the blade □ which makes the patient very painful. The round<br>
angle structure at the blade conjoint part and ferrule combinative structure of<br>
this invention will avoid the foreskin being clamped during the operation and<br><br>
pain incurred to the patient, making the operation smoother. In addition, the<br>
upper and lower structure at the blade-conjoined part can better facilitate the<br>
clamping.<br>
2. The balanus ferrule of the existing circumcision apparatus is an<br>
integrative circular structure, however, the penis will inevitably erect and<br>
enlarge in the entire process of treatment, as a result, such a structure with<br>
fixed balanus ferrule diameter adds to the discomfort of the patients. This<br>
invention transforms the single integral structure of the balanus ferrule into 2<br>
sections (even more sections) of left and right semi-ferrules, thereby enabling<br>
adaptation to erection and enlargement of the penis.<br>
3.The locking device of the existing circumcision apparatus generally<br>
adopts screw fixation □ therefore manual manipulation is very inconvenient.<br>
This invention, through its flexible and handy 'push-buckle' structure, renders<br>
the operation more flexible and convenient, increases the comfort of the<br>
patient when in use, and is more humanized.<br>
4.	The existing circumcision apparatus itself does not design the<br>
corresponding structure, and the anti-inflammation treatment is carried out by<br>
such traditional external antiphlogistic manners as injection, oral<br>
administration, and so on. The invention enables the device to be more<br>
practical through provision of cavity and injection passage.<br>
5.	The existing circumcision apparatus includes a retaining ring and<br>
auxiliary ring, Put the glans penis through the auxiliary ring, and place the<br>
foreskin between the auxiliary ring and the retaining ring, and then tie it to the<br>
auxiliary ring with the binding string. In this way, because the elasticity of the<br>
binding string is weak, and its contact area with the foreskin is small, when the<br>
penis is expanding, the binding string and the foreskin may move relatively,<br>
resulting in incomplete blockage of the blood stream, which will produce<br>
hematoma and affect the surgical effect. The latex pad of this invention,<br>
because of its relatively strong elasticity, can mitigate in part the binding force<br><br>
when the penis expands. Also, since the contact area between the latex pad and<br>
the foreskin is rather large, no relative move between the latex pad and the<br>
blade fixture will occur when the penis is enlarging, yielding good surgical<br>
result.<br>
6. Also, as stated in item 5□during real operation, since the binding string is<br>
bound by hand □ it is often operated entirely by right of experience according to<br>
the habit of the operator. As a result, the degrees of tightness are varied,<br>
resulting in non-standardization of the entire process of operation, which in<br>
turn affects the effect of the surgery. The invention utilizes the latex padG<br>
enabling standardization in the entire process, avoiding the problem caused by<br>
binding operation using the binding string manually.<br>
This invention is small and exquisite in shape, light in weight, simple in<br>
structure, convenient in use, and low in price, with a total expense of only<br>
160-200 yuan. Moreover, it is painless, has no ill scar after the circular cast of<br>
the foreskin, and the circular-casting position is smoother, cleaner and more<br>
accurate, well received by the great majority of sufferers.<br>

attached figures and concrete implementation manners.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The implementation example of this invention is the disposable apparatus<br>
for circumcising a penis, as shown in Fig 1A and Fig 1B.The circumcision<br>
apparatus includes the balanus ferrule 1 (not divided into sections temporarily),<br>
its exterior being equipped with the fixture device 3Cand the raw material of<br>
the balanus ferrule 1 and fixture device 3 is the high-grade 372-type organic<br>
material without toxic and side effect.<br>
The fixture device 3 is comprised of the left and right semi-ferrules 3A and<br><br>
3B, and connecting buckles 7 are installed at both ends of the semi-ferrules □<br>
with the other end possessing the connecting and fixing parts. Of course, the<br>
fixture device 3 can also be an integral structure, with openings, which is<br>
connected through the fixing part. The fixing part is the fix screw 8 or other<br>
connecting forms, which will be exemplified in the following introduction.<br>
Fig 2 illustrates the section I-I of the fixture device of the apparatus for<br>
circumcising a penis □Fig 3 illustrate the section II-II of the balanus ferrule of<br>
the apparatus for circumcising a penis □ As shown in the figure, one of the key<br>
points of this invention lies in: the balanus ferrule of existing circumcision<br>
apparatus is a circular structure, and such a structure with fixed balanus ferrule<br>
diameter adds to the discomfort of the patients. Shown in Fig 5 is the<br>
breakdown schematic diagram for another implementation example of the<br>
apparatus for circumcising a penis □ which transforms the single integral<br>
structure of the balanus ferrule into 2 sections of left and right half ferrules 11<br>
and 12, thereby enabling adaptation to erection and enlargement of the penis,<br>
and the squeeze can also be alleviated.<br>
Besides, the outer edge 11 of the balanus ferrule 1 is equipped with two or<br>
over two (two for this implementation example) the first grooves 12, between<br>
which the first protuberance 13 is formed; the inner edge 31 of the fixture<br>
device 3 has two or over two (two for this implementation example) second<br>
saliencies 32 that match with the first grooves 12 in question, and the second<br>
grooves 33 is formed between the second saliencies 32□and the second groove<br>
33 coordinates with the first protuberance 13 to form a cavity that is used to<br>
hold liquid drug; the passage 34 for injection of drug liquid is formed on the<br>
fixture device 3, which is connected with the cavity. The quantity of the<br>
passage 34 can be set as several according to the condition of use. During<br>
operation the aforementioned the first groove 12, the second groove 33, first<br>
protuberance 13 and the second protuberance 32 coordinate with each other to<br>
clamp the foreskin to be circumcised, resulting in its necrosis due to unsmooth<br><br>
blood circulation. Since it is inevitable for infection to occur during<br>
circumcision, medicament is needed to cooperate with the treatment so as to<br>
eliminate inflammation and grow the skin, etc. The drug liquid in the above<br>
cavity directly permeates into the infected part to eliminate the inflammation<br>
and grow the skin, enabling a shorter time for postoperative concrescence. The<br>
formula of these liquid drugs is specially prepared for circumcision, and will<br>
not be dealt with again here as it is not related to this patent application.<br>
Since the fastening operation for the connecting part A of the existing<br>
fixture device 3 is very inconvenient, and it is extremely afflictive for the<br>
patients who will undergo the operation, which increases their fear of<br>
operation and lengthens the operation time. Several kinds of connecting<br>
structure are introduced as follows.<br>
Fig 4A is the enlarged schematic diagram which illustrate Part A of the<br>
fixture device of the apparatus for circumcising a penis U The aforesaid fixture<br>
device 3 consists of the two semi-ferrules of 3A &amp; 3B and the Connecting<br>
buckle 7. These two semi-ferrules of 3A &amp; 3B are inter-connected at one end<br>
through connecting buckle 7, while the other ends of the two semi-ferrules are<br>
provided with coordinated L-shaped parts of 411 &amp; 412 respectively.<br>
Connecting rod shaft 413 is installed at the top of L-shaped parts of 411 &amp; 412.<br>
Attachment hole 414 is provided at the bottom platform. Connecting rod shaft<br>
413 interacts with Attachment hole 414 of the other semi-ferrule. Toothlike<br>
protuberance 415 or toothlike groove 416 is provided at the inner side of the<br>
upstanding end of L-shaped part. The toothlike protuberance 415 or toothlike<br>
groove 416 interacts with that of the other semi-ferrule. Thus,when locking<br>
connection of the two semi-ferrules of 3A &amp; 3B is needed, you only need to<br>
plant connecting rod shaft 413 inside attachment hole 414 and make toothlike<br>
protuberance 415 and toothlike groove 416 on the other L-shaped part joggle<br>
to each other at the same time in order to achieve the locking of the whole<br>
fixture device 3. Of course, you can insert a screwdriver or other tools inside<br><br>
Hole 417 on L-shaped part if connection opening is required. And with little<br>
efforts, you will break down the whole structure and open up the<br>
implementation example, which is a disposable circumcision apparatus.<br>
Fig 4B is another enlarged schematic diagram which illustrate Part A of<br>
the fixture device of the apparatus for circumcising a penis □ The aforesaid<br>
fixture device 3 consists of the two semi-ferrules of 3A &amp; 3B and the<br>
connecting buckle 7. These two semi-ferrules of 3A &amp; 3B are inter-connected<br>
at one end through connecting buckle 7, while the other ends of the two<br>
semi-ferrules are provided with uncinate heave 411 or slotted hole 422.<br>
uncinate heave 421 or slotted hole 422 interacts with that of the other<br>
semi-ferrule. Uncinate heave 421 consists of Joint plate 4211 and clamping<br>
piece 4212 which is of □ -shaped structure. Joint plate 4211 connects with the<br>
tip of semi-ferrule 3A at one end and with the central part of clamping piece<br>
4212 at the other end. Clamping piece 4212 is of elastic structure with certain<br>
degree of hardness, e. g. sheet bar. Slotted hole 422 boasts large jaw opening<br>
and large interior cavity. At the tip of Semi-ferrule 3A, there is Hole 423 which<br>
has the same function with Hole 417 in FIG 4A. When locking, insert uncinate<br>
heave 421 into Slotted eye 422. Here,elastic property of clamping piece 4212<br>
works. After Clamping piece 4212 is fixed, its hardness allows it to lean<br>
against the interior cavity wall of Slotted hole 422, thus locking is achieved.<br>
Fig 4C is another kind of structural enlargement schematic diagram for<br>
Part A of the fixture of the circumcision apparatus, the implementation<br>
example of this invention. The aforesaid fixture device 3 consists of the two<br>
semi-ferrules of 3A &amp; 3B and the connecting buckle 7. These two<br>
semi-ferrules of 3A &amp; 3B are inter-connected at one end through connecting<br>
buckle 7, while the other ends of the two semi-ferrules are provided with<br>
saucer shape heave 432. The saucer shape heave 432 contains block 431 in the<br>
form of a bow tie. At the tip of semi-ferrule 3A, there is hole 433 which has the<br>
same function with aforementioned Hole 417 &amp; 423. When locking, you only<br><br>
need to insert both ends of bow-tie shaped block 431 into saucer shape heave<br>
432.<br>
Fig 4D is again another kind of structural enlargement schematic diagram<br>
for Part A of the fixture of the circumcision apparatus, the implementation<br>
example of this invention. The aforesaid fixture device 3 consists of the two<br>
semi-ferrules of 3A &amp; 3B and the Connecting buckle 7. These two<br>
semi-ferrules of 3A &amp; 3B are inter-connected at one end through Connecting<br>
buckle 7, while the other ends of the two semi-ferrules are provided with<br>
strip-shaped gear body 511 or strip-shaped sprocket hole 512. As shown in the<br>
figure for detail enhancement of strip-shaped gear body 511, there are many<br>
horizontal lines of heave to interact with the petty groove arranged<br>
horizontally in strip-shaped gear body 511. When Strip-shaped gear body 511<br>
is inserted inside Strip-shaped sprocket hole 512, it happens that the petty<br>
horizontal lines of heave of the strip-shaped sprocket hole are clamped into the<br>
petty groove of the strip-shaped gear body. It is noteworthy that such inserting<br>
is unidirectional, thus it is necessary to keep an obtuse angle between the tilt<br>
direction of and the inserting direction of the petty horizontal lines of heave of<br>
the strip-shaped sprocket hole and the petty groove of the strip-shaped gear<br>
body. Once they are clamped and fixed, there is normally no way to simply<br>
draw Strip-shaped gear body 511 away from Strip-shaped sprocket hole 512.<br>
So the fastness of the clamping is guaranteed, thus enhancing the fastness,<br>
stability and operability of this present invention. As for its disassembly after<br>
the operation is completed, this implementation example still adopt the hole<br>
structure designed to break the connection as aforementioned. You can insert a<br>
screwdriver or other tools inside Hole 513 if connection breakdown is required.<br>
And with little efforts, you can break down the whole structure and open up the<br>
implementation example.<br>
Fig 8 is the structural diagrammatic sketch for the fastening device of the<br>
circumcision apparatus, another implementation example of this invention.<br><br>
The aforementioned fixture device 3 has an opening. An upper blade conjoined<br>
part 3111A and a lower blade conjoined part 3111B are provided on either end<br>
of the opening. The first scalariform detent block 41 is installed at tip of the<br>
opening with Upper blade conjoined part 3111A, while the second scalariform<br>
detent block 42 is installed at the tip of the opening with Lower blade<br>
conjoined part 3111B. First scalariform detent block 41 and second scalariform<br>
detent block 42 interact with each other. In the profile direction,the first<br>
scalariform detent block 41 lies under Upper blade conjoined part 3111A,<br>
while the second scalariform detent block 42 lies above Lower blade conjoined<br>
part 3111B. When in use, insert Lower blade conjoined part 3111B below<br>
Upper blade conjoined part 3111A as shown in FIG 7 &amp; FIG 9. The detent of<br>
Second scalariform detent block 42 is achieved above the first scalariform<br>
detent block 41, resulting in the tight coupling of first scalariform detent block<br>
4 with second scalariform detent block 42 by spacing of Upper blade<br>
conjoined part 3111A and Lower blade conjoined part 3111B. Thus, tight<br>
locking is achieved for the whole fixture device. There is Hole 423 on either<br>
first scalariform detent block or Second scalariform detent block, you can<br>
insert a screwdriver or other tools inside Hole 423 if connection opening is<br>
required. And with little efforts, you will break down the whole structure and<br>
open up the implementation example, which is a disposable apparatus for<br>
circumcising a penis.<br>
With different linkage structures introduced, we now make the following<br>
explanations on the operation &amp; use procedures of this present invention:<br>
1.	Sterilization treatment of the genitals; fully expose the foreskin by<br>
pushing back the foreskin that covers the balanus.<br>
2.	Adjust the position of the balanus ferrule, and pull out the back-pushed<br>
foreskin until it fully covers the balanus ferrule and the balanus.<br>
3.	Open the fixture and put it in from one side of the patient to let the<br>
fixture envelop and fix the balanus ferrule before the fixture is fixed, thus the<br><br>
foreskin is prevented from blood circulation and its necrosis is caused.<br>
4.	Injecting medicine solution into the cavity through Passage 34. The<br>
medicine solution can directly reach the affected part through the cavity,<br>
thereby diminishing inflammation and killing pain.<br>
5.	After 2-5 days(sometimes longer), take off the necrotic foreskin and<br>
loosen the fixture at the same time or later on.<br>
In another implementation example, Semi-ferrule 3A of Fixture device 3 is<br>
provided with Upper blade conjoined part 3111A as shown in FIG 5 &amp; 7. 3B,<br>
the other semi-ferrule, is provided with Lower blade conjoined part 3111B that<br>
corresponds with Upper blade conjoined part 3111A. The upper and lower<br>
blade conjoined parts can better facilitate the clamping of Fixture device 3.<br>
Round angle 311 is provided at the edges of the upper blade conjoined part and<br>
the lower blade conjoined part. The round angle structure will prevent the<br>
foreskin from being clamped during the operation and avoid the pain incurred<br>
to the patient. If the foreskin is clamped, it will become granulated. The<br>
recovery period will be longer and the patient will suffer more pain. In a<br>
similar way, the connexion of the two semi-ferrules on both right and left sides<br>
of Balanus ferrule 1 may be provided with the same or similar round angles in<br>
order to prevent the foreskin from being clamped.<br>
This present invention is used without any pain. There will be no obvious<br>
scar left following the circular cast of the foreskin with quick recovery and<br>
accurate circular cast position. Children, youngsters and old men all can<br>
receive this treatment with different sizes of the apparatus applied according to<br>
the actual balanus sizes of patients.<br>
In addition, patients' work or study is not affected during the whole process<br>
of the treatment. Being simple and needing no special training, the operation<br>
may be carried out in small clinics. The total period of treatment costs only<br>
160 - 200 Yuan, including that of operation, anti-inflammation, etc. Thus it is<br>
acceptable to the general public.<br><br>
To sum up, the present invention is expounded from the aspects of its<br>
application target, effectivity, evolutionarity and novelty, etc. It has a practical<br>
evolutionarity that has already been in compliance with the requirements for<br>
function improvement and utility highlighted in laws on patented inventions.<br>
The above-mentioned implementation explanation and figures attached to the<br>
present invention are considered as one preferred implementation example of<br>
the invention, which should not be regarded as a limit to it. Therefore, all the<br>
