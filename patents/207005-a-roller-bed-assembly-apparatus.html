ROLLER BED FOR A CONVEYOR BELT SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to conveyor belt system. More particularly, this invention relates to a bed rail assembly apparatus for supporting a conveyor belt. Still more particularly, this invention relates to a bed rail assembly apparatus that is adapted to be inserted between industry standard carry idlers of the conveyor system to support a conveyor belt with reduced drag and friction. This invention further relates to a bed rail assembly apparatus having sides that are adjustable to different widths and different inclinations to accommodate conveyor systems of different configurations.<br>
Problem<br>
It is common to use conveyor belts to move bulk materials from one place to another. For example, power plants transport coal from storage piles out one location to hoppers at a distant processing area using a series of conveyor belts. One problem with the use of conveyor belts is spillage of material. A second problem is air pollution from dust created by the conveyor belts. The generated dust may be volatile and can be ignited by any heat or spark introduced into the environment.<br>
Spillage of material typically occurs at a conveyor transfer point where bulk material is passed from one conveyor belt to a second conveyor belt. The transfer often involves dropping the bulk material from the first conveyor belt to the second belt. As the bulk material hits the second conveyor belt, the bulk material spreads and some falls over the sides of the second conveyor belt. Vibrations caused by nearby machinery may shake the conveyor belt and cause bulk material to spill<br>
over the belt edges.<br>
Air pollution is caused by induced air flow in a conveyor belt system. Bulk material falling or projected from the first conveyor belt to the second conveyor belt forms a material stream. The individual particles in the stream impart a frictional drag on the surrounding air. The surrounding air begins to flow in the direction of the material stream and attains a velocity approaching the velocity of the bulk material stream. This is called an induced air flow. The bulk material is suddenly stopped at the end of its fall and is compacted by the impact onto the second<br><br>
conveyor belt. The velocity pressure of the induced air fldw is converted to static )ressure by the material impact. A region of high air pressure is created by the static pressure. Air in the high air pressure region flows to a region of lower air Dressure. This air flow contains small particles of the bulk material. In an open system, this air movement of the air is evident by a dust cloud billowing from a oading point of the second conveyor belt<br>
It is common to use a housing to enclose the second conveyor belt to arevent the billowing dust and reduce material spillage. A rubber skirting seal hangs on the bottom edge of the housing and drags against the top surface of the inclined sides of the conveyor belt to completely enclose the area. To maintain contact with the rubber skirting seal and the inclined sides of the conveyor belt surface, a support is positioned underneath the conveyor belt. The support often includes bars or beams that run longitudinally beneath the bottom surface of the conveyor belt along each side. This support may also include large rollers spaced apart on 4 foot centers beneath the conveyor belt. The bars or beams can cause excessive drag or friction with the bottom surface of the conveyor belt This can cause an undue load on the motor turning the conveyor belt and/or wear of the side skirting and a wear of the belt. The drag may also generate heat that can melt the belt or the beams. With the use of large rollers having 4 foot centers or greater, the belt can sag between the rollers and cause excessive clearance between the inclined sides of the conveyor belt and rubber skirt seal. This allows material spillage and impingement points where material wedges between the inclined sides of the belt and the weariiner where the belt sags between the rollers. This causes conveyor belt damage.<br>
Solution<br>
The above and other problems are solved and an advance in the arts is achieved by the provision of an insertable bed rail assembly apparatus having an adjustable inclined bed of inclined rollers. A first advantage of the bed rail assembly apparatus is that the bed cradles the inclined sides of the conveyor belt at an adjustable inclination to prevent spillage. A second advantage of the invention is that the bed rail assembly apparatus has a series of inclined rollers that support to the bottom of the inclined sides of the conveyor belt. These rollers reduce friction between the bed rail assembly apparatus and the conveyor belt.<br><br>
The rollers are positioned with reduced spacing between rollers to prevent sag that couid cause a excessive clearance between the flexible rubber skirting seals and the inclined sides of the conveyor belt. A third advantage of this invention is that the angle of Inclination of the sides of the roller bed rail assembly is adjustable to allow the roller plate of the invention to be used with a range of industry standard conveyor troughing angles with infinite angle adjustments being available between those standard conveyor angles. This infinite angle adjustment compensates for small variances in equipment that is common among different manufactures. The bod mil assembly apparatus is also adjustable in its width to accommodate different conveyor systems.<br>
A bed rail assembly apparatus embodying the invention inserted between standard carry idlers in an existing conveyor belt is designed in the following manner. The bed rail assembly apparatus has a center portion oriented substantially parallel to and beneath the horizontal surface of the conveyor belt. A first bed ran assembly on a left side of the belt is inclined to support the inclined surface or the left side of the conveyor belt. This causes the left side of the conveyor beft to he inclined upwards and in-line with respect to a plane of the horizontal carrying surface of the conveyor belt The left bed rail assembly has rollers affixed to Us frame with an adjustable linkage that maintains the inclined side of the conveyor belt in contact with to the rubber skirting seal. This reduces conveyor belt drag while? maintaining the left side of the belt at an inclination that creates an effective seal. A right second bed rail assembly (similar to the left side bod rail assembly) function in the same manner with respect to the inclined right side of the conveyor belt.<br>
A horizontal center portion of the bed rail assembly has horizontal idlers positioned under iho belt to reduce drag on the belt and provide additional support under the horizontal carrying surface of the belt.<br>
In ordor to be inserted under conveyor belts having different designs by manufacturers, Hie first and second bed rail assembly apparatus that includes an adjusting linkage that changes the angle of inclination of rollers to accommodate (lie angle of standard carry idlers in the conveyor belt system. This adjustable linkage may include a base, a support that extends upwards from the base, and a<br><br>
movabto rttachmont member that adjusts the rollers on each side to a desired angle of Inclinalion and to a desired horizontal width.<br><br>
The bed rail assembly apparatus may be affixed to a mounting rail by couplings. The side rollers on the bed rail assemblies have minimal spacing between rollers. The side rollers are advantageously smaller in diameter than the standard carry idlers beneath the belt The minimal space between side rollers and their smaller diameter reduces that amount of unsupported area underneath the inclined sides of the conveyor belt. The side rollers are of a small diameter and have sealed precision bearing to increase speed and reduce friction.<br>

Following this, the bolts and set screws associated with this adjustment are tightened to fix the bed rail assembly I24, the desired width along support rail 123, the desired angle of inclination, and he desired position on element 205.<br>
Support rail 123 supports bed rail assembly apparatus as well as idlers 117 vhich support the horizontal carrying surface of conveyor belt 104 flat. Support rail 123 prevents conveyor belt 104 from buckling under the impact of the material oad. Support rail 123 and idler 117 provide a support surface beneath the carrying surface of conveyor belt 104. Support rail 123 also supports inclined rollers 110 and its associated members.<br>
Conveyor system 200 of FIG. 2 includes side skirt boards 107 and top covering 108. Side skirt boards 107 and covering 108 are positioned over and enclose conveyor belt 104. Supports 109 couple side skirt boards 107 via vertical nembers 121 to the base of conveyor belt system 200 via conveyor stringers 105.<br>
Wear liners 125 depend from the bottom end of skirt boards 107. Wear iners 125 engage the top portions of conveyor belt 104 to prevent material from spilling out of the sides of conveyor belt 104. Skirting seals 118 extend outward ram wear liners 125 and further engage conveyor belt 104.<br><br>
FIG. 4 is a lower side view of the elements of the bed rail assembly 124. It shows the inclined carrier idlers 116 of the existing conveyor system. It further shows the inclined rollers 110 of bed rail assembly 124. It further shows the brackets 207 which are fixed to the ends of the support rail 123 shown on FIGS. 2 and 3. It further shows the upper and lower brackets 128A and 128B mounting rollers 110 to the rest of the bed rail assembly 124. All of this apparatus is mounted to the frame 103 termed the "conveyor stringer" as shown on FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 4 also shows the carrier idlers 117 which as shown on FIG. 1 are horizontally oriented beneath the lower surface of the conveyor belt to provide further support for the horizontal portion of the conveyor belt. The horizontal carrier idler 117 comprises an integral part of each element 119 on FIG. 1 which is termed the "glider bed".   Each bed rail assembly 124 includes two glider bed elements 117 and thus two horizontally oriented carrier idlers 117 in addition to the array of inclined rollers 110.<br>
Rollers 110 are of the smaller diameter than are the inclined idlers 116 of the existing conveyor systems. This allows rollers 110 to be closely spaced to minimize the unsupported belt span of the inclined portion of belt 104 between rollers 110 to minimize sag of the inclined portion of the belt. This provides improved material support for the inclined portion of the belt and, as best shown on FIG. 2, permits the rubber belt seal 118 and wearliner 125 to engage the inclined portion of the belt 104 to minimize the escape of dust and to minimize material spillage over the inclined sides of the conveyor belt 104. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, rollers 110 are of small diameter and have sealed precision bearings. This promotes improved sealing for the conveyor belt 104 to prevent spillage.<br>
