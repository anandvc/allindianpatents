				<td>PAYMENT SERVICE EQUIPMENT DEVICE AND A METHOD FOR<br>
TRANSMITTING INFORMATION SECURELY IN A<br>
TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a payment service equipment device and<br>
in particular, a method for transmitting information securely in a<br>
telecommunication system, and method by means of which the security of use of<br>
a payment card ..especially a credit card.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a traditional payment transaction, the<br>
client visits the offices of a merchant, chooses the<br>
desired products from the shelves and eventually pays<br>
his/her purchases, e.g. in cash or with a bank or<br>
credit card. Besides the traditional commerce there is<br>
the purchasing and paying of trade or different serv-<br>
ices via different telecommunication networks. In a<br>
mobile communication network, e.g. in the GSM system<br>
(GSM, Global System for Mobile communications), it is<br>
possible to make and pay different purchases with the<br>
mobile station. In addition, the mobile station may be<br>
used to digitally sign and/or encrypt outgoing traffic<br>
for different operating applications. This practice<br>
helps to improve the data security in measures requir-<br>
ing it. In encryption and signing, a so-called public<br>
key infrastructure is often used (PKI, Public Key In-<br>
frastructure) .<br>
In the public key infrastructure, the user<br>
has got two keys, a public key and a private key. If<br>
the user wishes to send encrypted information to some-<br>
body, then he or she encrypts the information with the<br>
recipient's public key. The information encrypted with<br>
the public key may be transformed into a readable form<br>
only with a private key associated with the public<br>
key. The digital signature is used to mean a way of<br>
action in which one acts exactly contrary to the en-<br>
cryption of the message. The sender signs the message<br>
with his or her own private signing key and the re-<br>
cipient may in turn decode the message into a readable<br>
form with the sender's public signing key. This is to<br>
make sure that the sender really is the person he or<br>
she claims to be.<br>
The paying via the Internet has been possible<br>
for a long time. The general practice is that the cli-<br>
ent visits the www sites (WWW, World Wide Web) of a<br>
merchant or other service provider, chooses the de-<br>
sired products and effects the payment for the chosen<br>
products. One possibility of effecting the payment is<br>
to transmit the credit card number directly to the<br>
merchant over the Internet without any encryption op-<br>
erations at all. This alternative, does not, however,<br>
take any stand on the security of the effecting of the<br>
payment.<br>
On the whole, there are several electronic<br>
payment modes differing from one another developed in<br>
conjunction with the Internet. Examples of these are,<br>
for instance, Ecash, solo of the Merita Bank, Kulta-<br>
raha of the bank Osuuspankki and the SET (SET, Secure<br>
Electronic Transaction) of credit card companies. SET<br>
is an international payment system developed together<br>
by VISA and MasterCard for secure purchasing on the<br>
Internet. SET is based on certificates issued by a<br>
trusted third party and on encrypted transmission of<br>
information. SET uses a symmetric and asymmetric en-<br>
cryption, digital signature as well as a SRA-1 algo-<br>
rithm (SHA, Secure Hash Algorithm) . The SET standard<br>
aims at the encryption of information, confidential-<br>
ity, checking of the integrity of the information,<br>
authentication of the sender and indisputability.<br>
The symmetric encryption is used to mean an<br>
encryption method in which the encrypted message may<br>
be decoded with the same key as the message was en-<br>
crypted. One example of this kind of method is DES<br>
(DES, Data Encryption Standard). The asymmetric en-<br>
cryption is used to mean that the message is encrypted<br>
and decoded using different keys. One example of this<br>
kind of method is the public key method RSA (RSA,<br>
Rivest, Shamir, Adleman).<br>
In the present practices of purchasing on the<br>
Internet there are several problem points. The systems<br>
supporting the cards are often card-specific. The same<br>
applications cannot be used for paying with a credit<br>
card issued by another company. Therefore, the commer-<br>
cial centres have to support the payment practice of<br>
several different systems.<br>
In order that the security of paying with a<br>
credit card can be improved, all the parties associ-<br>
ated with the payment transaction - both the client<br>
and the merchant - have to often make investments in<br>
reliable software. If the investments required are too<br>
high, then this for its part is an obstacle to the<br>
spreading of commerce in the network.<br>
There are methods in which both of the par-<br>
ties of the commerce, the client and the merchant,<br>
have got their own certificates. The certificate is<br>
used to mean a kind of identification information is-<br>
sued by a trusted third party (TTP, Trusted Third<br>
Party) . In the case of a credit card payment, the<br>
meaning of the certificate is that it indicates that<br>
the user has got a credit card valid for paying. A<br>
certificate issued to the merchant gives in turn proof<br>
of the fact that the merchant is an authorized mer-<br>
chant. By means of certificates, both the client and<br>
the merchant can make sure of the identity of one an-<br>
other. The use of certificates, digital signature and<br>
encryption remarkably adds to the security of paying<br>
with the credit card on the Internet.<br>
The known modes of credit card payments have,<br>
however, weak points. The complexity of the payment<br>
system and the heavy investments were already dis-<br>
cussed above. The biggest problem is, however, the<br>
fact that the credit card number of the client is sent<br>
over the data transmission network. Furthermore, some**<br>
known methods require the use of a so-called digital<br>
wallet (Digital Wallet). The digital wallet includes<br>
client-specific information, e.g. the certificate of<br>
the client, credit card number, the validity of the<br>
card, etc. The requirement for a successful payment<br>
transaction is that the digital wallet is in the ter-<br>
minal device by means of which the client is making<br>
the purchase.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the invention is to elimi-<br>
nate the drawbacks referred to above or at least sig-<br>
nificantly to alleviate them. One specific objective<br>
of the invention is to disclose a new type of payment<br>
service equipment and method which enable one to se-<br>
curely pay with a payment card, especially with a<br>
credit card, in an information network such as the<br>
Internet. The credit card number of the client is not<br>
sent over the data transmission network at all. In ad-<br>
dition, the method in accordance with the invention<br>
does not take any stand on the fact who has issued the<br>
payment card, instead the method functions regardless<br>
of the card.<br>

In an embodiment of the invention, the serv-<br>
ice payment equipment comprises a fourth access inter-<br>
face to the mobile communication network.<br>
The present invention also relates to a<br>
method for secure paying in a telecommunication system<br>
comprising a mobile communication network, a telecom-<br>
munication network, a payment terminal device which<br>
comprises a smart card and which is connected to the<br>
mobile communication network or to the telecommunica-<br>
tion network, a trusted third party, a payment system,<br>
service provider and an authentication system. In the<br>
method, a certificate associated with the client is<br>
generated and issued by the trusted third party, the<br>
product or service to be ordered is chosen via the<br>
service provider by means of a display terminal device<br>
via the telecommunication and/or mobile communication<br>
network and the client's payment card and/or payment<br>
card information is used for the paying of the product<br>
or service ordered.<br>
According to the invention, the payment serv-<br>
ice equipment is used to generate a billing ticket. A<br>
confirmation of order is sent to the payment terminal<br>
device of the client via the mobile communication net-<br>
work. The payment terminal device is advantageously<br>
used to mean a mobile station. The smart card is ad-<br>
vantageously used to mean a subscriber identity module<br>
(SIM, Subscriber Identity Module) inserted into the<br>
mobile station. The aforementioned confirmation of or-<br>
der is signed and/or encrypted in the payment terminal<br>
device. The signature and/or encryption is carried out<br>
by means of a smart card. Stored on the smart card are<br>
the necessary keys for carrying out the signing and/or<br>
encryption. Stored on the smart card is preferably the<br>
electronic identity of the client, the private key as-<br>
sociated with the client and the public key associated<br>
with the payment service equipment.<br>
The signed and/or encrypted confirmation of<br>
order and the electronic identity associated with the<br>
client are sent from the payment terminal device to<br>
the payment service equipment via the mobile communi-<br>
cation network. The client is identified by the pay-<br>
ment service equipment based on the electronic iden-<br>
tity. The client is identified, e.g. based on the in-<br>
formation included in the certificate database. The<br>
payment card number associated with the client is re-<br>
trieved and the use of right of the payment card is<br>
verified. The payment is accepted, if the verification<br>
of the payment card was successful. Prior to accepting<br>
the payment one may check in the verification database<br>
attached to the payment service equipment that the<br>
client's payment card is not among suspicious or for-<br>
bidden payment cards. The request for the debiting of<br>
the payment is sent further to be implemented in the<br>
payment system.<br>
The validity of the payment card is checked,<br>
e.g. in a separate authentication system. The payment<br>
card information associated with the client is re-<br>
trieved, e.g. from the database of the payment service<br>
equipment. In an embodiment of the invention, the pay-<br>
ment card number of the client is retrieved from a<br>
certificate database attached to the payment service<br>
equipment. The payment card is advantageously used to<br>
mean a Visa, MasterCard or Diners Club card or a bank<br>
card.<br>
When the use of the client's payment card has<br>
been accepted, the service provider may be sent a con-<br>
firmation of the fact that the payment associated with<br>
the order has been effected. A similar confirmation<br>
may also be sent to the display terminal device or<br>
payment terminal device of the client.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the pay-<br>
ment terminal device and display terminal device are<br>
used to mean a mobile station which comprises both fa-<br>
cilities .<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the pay-<br>
ment terminal device is used to mean a mobile station<br>
and the display terminal device a computer.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the<br>
trusted third party updates the certificate database.<br>
The trusted third party is used to mean, e.g. a cer-<br>
tificate authority (CA, Certificate Authority) .<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the mobile<br>
communication network is used to mean a mobile commu-<br>
nication network consistent with the GSM system.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the tele-<br>
communication network is used to mean a packet -<br>
switched network, e.g. an Internet network.<br>
The present invention also relates to a<br>
method for secure paying in a telecommunication system<br>
comprising a telecommunication network, a terminal de-<br>
vice into which there is a card reader inserted and<br>
into which card reader it is possible to input a smart<br>
card and which terminal device is connected to the<br>
telecommunication network, a trusted third party, a<br>
payment system, a service provider and an authentica-<br>
tion system. In the method, the trusted third party<br>
generates and issues the certificate associated with<br>
the client, the product or service to be ordered is<br>
chosen from the service provider by means of the ter-<br>
minal device via the telecommunication network, and<br>
the client's payment card and/ or payment card infor-<br>
mation is used for paying the ordered product or serv-<br>
ice.<br>
According to the invention, the payment serv-<br>
ice equipment is used to generate a billing ticket. A<br>
confirmation of the order that was made is sent to the<br>
terminal device of the client via the telecommunica-<br>
tion network. The terminal device is advantageously<br>
used to mean a computer. The confirmation of order is<br>
signed and/or encrypted by means of the terminal de-<br>
vice. The signing and/or encryption is enabled by<br>
means of a card reader attached to the terminal device<br>
and by means of a smart card inserted into it. The<br>
client inputs into the card reader his or her own<br>
smart card on which there are the necessary keys<br>
stored for carrying out the signing and/or encryption.<br>
Stored on the smart card is preferably the electronic<br>
identity of the client, the private key associated<br>
with the client and the public key associated with the<br>
payment service equipment.<br>
The signed and/or encrypted confirmation of<br>
order and the electronic identity associated with the<br>
client are sent from the payment terminal device to<br>
the payment service equipment via the telecommunica-<br>
tion network. The client is identified by the payment<br>
service equipment based on the signature and/or elec-<br>
tronic identity. The client is identified, e.g. based<br>
on the information included in the certificate data-<br>
base. The payment card number associated with the cli-<br>
ent is retrieved and the use of right of the payment<br>
card is verified. The payment is accepted, if the<br>
verification of the payment card was successful. Prior<br>
to accepting the payment one may check in the verifi-<br>
cation database attached to the payment service equip-<br>
ment that the clien'ts payment card is not among sus-<br>
picious or forbidden payment cards. The request for<br>
the debiting of the payment is sent further to be im-<br>
plemented in the payment system.<br>
The validity of the payment card is advanta-<br>
geously checked in a separate authentication system.<br>
The payment card information associated with the cli-<br>
ent is retrieved, e.g. from the database of the pay-<br>
ment service equipment. In an embodiment of the inven-<br>
tion, the payment card number of the client is re-<br>
trieved from the certificate database attached to the<br>
payment service equipment. The payment card is advan-<br>
tageously used to mean a Visa, MasterCard or Diners<br>
Club card or a bank card.<br>
When the use of the client's payment card has<br>
been accepted/ the service provider may be sent a con-<br>
firmation of the fact that the payment associated with<br>
the order has been effected. A similar confirmation<br>
may also be sent to the terminal device of the client.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the<br>
trusted third party updates the certificate database.<br>
The trusted third party is used to mean, e.g. a cer-<br>
tificate authority (CA, Certificate Authority).<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the tele-<br>
communication network is used to mean a packet -<br>
switched network, e.g. an Internet network.<br>
As compared to prior art the present inven-<br>
tion provides several advantages. Thanks to the pres-<br>
ent invention, information proceeding in an open tele-<br>
communication network does not include the actual<br>
piece of information connected with the mode of debit-<br>
ing. This is used to mean that when the client pays<br>
his or her purchases with a credit card, the credit<br>
card number of the client is not sent over the tele-<br>
communication network at all. Due to this, the secu-<br>
rity level of the method presented by the invention is<br>
remarkably high.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is in no<br>
way restricted to a certain payment mode or payment<br>
system. It can be used in all payment modes.<br>
Thanks to the present invention, the parties<br>
of a payment transaction do not need to make big in-<br>
vestments in hardware or software improving the secu-<br>
rity.<br>

ent database DB, a service provider database RET, a<br>
transaction database TRANS, a verification database BL<br>
and a certificate database CERT. The client database<br>
DB comprises information relating to the clients. Cli-<br>
ent information may include, e.g. the name of the cli-<br>
ent, address, identity number, mobile number and the<br>
piece of information connected with the client's pay-<br>
ment cards. The service provider database RET com-<br>
prises information about registered service providers.<br>
The information relating to the service providers may<br>
include, e.g. the IP address of the service provider<br>
(IP, Internet Protocol) . Further, the information re-<br>
lating to service providers may include, e.g. the pay-<br>
ment cards accepted by the service provider and the<br>
bankers of the service provider.<br>
To the transaction database TRANS, vouchers<br>
of the orders of products or services made via the<br>
payment service equipment PS are stored. The responsi-<br>
bility of the transaction database TRANS is to act as<br>
a kind of a voucher storage which enables one to af-<br>
terwards unambiguously verify the purchases made, if<br>
necessary. The responsibility of the verification da-<br>
tabase BL is to save information about suspicious pay-<br>
ment cards, thus acting as a kind of a black list. The<br>
certificate database CERT comprises certificates gen-<br>
erated to the clients that include, e.g. information<br>
relating to the clients and information relating to<br>
the issuer of the certificate. This kind of informa-<br>
tion may include, e.g. the name of the client and<br>
identity number, the address of the client, the public<br>
key of the client and the electronic identity. The<br>
certificate is issued by the trusted third party TTP,<br>
which also updates the certificate database CERT. The<br>
trusted third party TTP is advantageously used to mean<br>
a certificate authority.<br>
The example as shown in Fig 1 comprises four<br>
access interfaces: a first access interface 1 to the<br>
payment system BANK, a second access interface 2 to<br>
the authentication system AUT, a third access inter-<br>
face 3 to the telecommunication network NET and a<br>
fourth access interface to the mobile communication<br>
network PL.MN. The aforementioned systems, the database<br>
and the networks are connected to the payment service<br>
equipment PS via the relevant access interfaces. The<br>
mobile communication network PLMN is advantageously<br>
used to mean a mobile communication network consistent<br>
with the GSM system. The telecommunication network NET<br>
is primarily used to mean a packet-switched data<br>
transmission network, e.g. the Internet. The telecom-<br>
munication network NET may, however, be any other<br>
packet-switched data transmission network.<br>
The payment service equipment PS further com-<br>
prises a generation block PAY for generating the bill-<br>
ing ticket connected with the payment transaction. The<br>
telecommunication block PB is used to send and receive<br>
the confirmation of order connected with the billing<br>
ticket. The identification block ID is used to iden-<br>
tify the client based on the electronic identity<br>
and/or signature. The information retrieval block. IR<br>
is used to find out the payment card information re-<br>
lating to the client.<br>
Connected to the mobile communication network<br>
PLMN is the payment terminal device PTE which is ad-<br>
vantageously used to mean a mobile station. Connected<br>
to the mobile station PTE is the smart card SIM which<br>
is advantageously a subscriber identity module. Stored<br>
on the subscriber identity module SIM are, e.g. the<br>
electronic identity associated with the holder of the<br>
subscriber identity module SIM, the holder's private<br>
key and the public key associated with the payment<br>
service equipment. The private key is advantageously<br>
used to refer to the private key consistent with the<br>
PKI system.<br>
Connected to the network NET are the service<br>
provider SP and the display terminal device DTE. The<br>
service provider SP is used to mean an entity which<br>
offers the clients a possibility of making purchases<br>
via the telecommunication network NET. The purchases<br>
are debited by means of the payment card of the cli-<br>
ent. The display terminal device DTE is advantageously<br>
used to mean an ordinary computer which comprises the<br>
necessary facilities and devices for using the service<br>
offered by the service provider PS.<br>
Connected to the payment service equipment PS<br>
is an authentication system AUT. By means of the<br>
authentication system AUT, the payment service equip-<br>
ment PS may check the validity of the client'ts pay-<br>
ment cards. In this example, the authentication system<br>
AUT consists of relevant data transmission networks.<br>
Via each data transmission network, the payment serv-<br>
ice equipment PS has the access to information systems<br>
of each company offering a payment card.<br>
Connected to the payment service equipment PS<br>
is also a payment system BANK. The payment system BANK<br>
is generally used to mean a system which actually deb-<br>
its the client's payment card and correspondingly<br>
credits the account of the service provider SP with<br>
the same sum.<br>
The payment service equipment PS may, when<br>
required, be separated from the telecommunication net-<br>
work NET by using a firewall. The firewall is used to<br>
mean a software or hardware configuration which is<br>
used to try to prevent the unauthorized access of ex-<br>
traneous entities to the resources of some company or<br>
to the ones of one's own telecommunication network. """""<br>
The system as shown in Fig. 2 comprises pay-<br>
ment service equipment PS. Connected to the payment<br>
service equipment are five different databases: a cli-<br>
ent database DB, a service provider database RET, a<br>
transaction database TRANS, a verification database BL<br>
and a certificate database CERT. The client database<br>
DB comprises information relating to the clients. Cli-<br>
ent information may include, e.g. the name of the cli-<br>
ent, address, identity number, mobile number and the<br>
piece of information connected with the client's pay-<br>
ment cards. The service provider database RET com-<br>
prises information about registered service providers.<br>
The information relating to the service providers may<br>
include, e.g. the IP address of the service provider<br>
(IP, Internet Protocol). Further, the information re-<br>
lating to service providers may include, e.g. the pay-<br>
ment cards accepted by the service provider and the<br>
bankers of the service provider. To the transaction<br>
database TRANS, vouchers of the orders of products or<br>
services made via the payment service equipment PS are<br>
stored. The responsibility of the transaction database<br>
TRANS is to act as a kind of a voucher storage which<br>
enables one to afterwards unambiguously verify the<br>
purchases made, if necessary. The responsibility of<br>
the verification database BL is to save information<br>
about suspicious payment cards, thus acting as a kind<br>
of a black list. The certificate database CERT com-<br>
prises certificates generated to the clients that in-<br>
clude, e.g. information relating to the clients and<br>
information relating to the issuer of the certificate.<br>
This kind of information may include, e.g. the name of<br>
the client and identity number, the address of the<br>
client, the public key of the client and the elec-<br>
tronic identity. The certificate is issued by the<br>
trusted third party TTP, which also updates the cer-<br>
tificate database CERT. The trusted third party TTP is<br>
advantageously used to mean a certificate authority.<br>
In the example as shown in Pig. 2 the payment<br>
service equipment comprises three access interfaces: a<br>
first access interface 1 to the payment system BANK, a<br>
second access interface 2 to the authentication system<br>
AUT and a third access interface 3 to the telecommuni-<br>
cation network NET. The aforementioned systems and the<br>
telecommunication network NET are connected to the<br>
payment service equipment PS via the relevant access<br>
interfaces. The telecommunication network NET is pri-<br>
marily used to mean a packet-switched data transmis-<br>
sion network, e.g. the Internet. The telecommunication<br>
network NET may, however, be any other packet-switched<br>
data transmission network.<br>
The payment service equipment PS further com-<br>
prises a generation block PAY for generating the bill-<br>
ing ticket connected with the payment transaction. The<br>
telecommunication block PB is used to send and receive<br>
the confirmation of order connected with the billing<br>
ticket. The identification block ID is used to iden-<br>
tify the client based on the electronic identity<br>
and/or signature. The information retrieval block IR<br>
is used to find out the payment card information con-<br>
nected with the client.<br>
Connected to the telecommunication network<br>
NET are the service provider SP and the terminal de-<br>
vice TE. The service provider SP is used to mean an<br>
entity which offers the clients a possibility of mak-<br>
ing purchases via the telecommunication network NET .<br>
The purchases are debited from the payment card of the<br>
client. The terminal device TE is advantageously used<br>
to mean an ordinary computer which comprises the nec-<br>
essary facilities and devices for using the service<br>
offered by the service provider SP. Connected to the<br>
terminal device TE is a smart card reader SCR. Into<br>
the card reader SCR, the smart card of the client may<br>
be input. Stored on the smart card SC are, e.g. the<br>
electronic identity associated with the holder of the<br>
smart card SC, the private key of the holder and the<br>
public key connected with the payment service equip-<br>
ment . The private key is preferably used to refer to<br>
the private key consistent with the PKI system. The<br>
card reader SCR may also be used to mean a facility<br>
internally installed in the terminal device TE<br>
Connected to the payment service equipment PS<br>
is an authentication system AUT. By means of the<br>
authentication system AUT, the payment service equip-<br>
ment PS may check the validity of the client's payment<br>
cards. In this example, the authentication system AUT<br>
consists of relevant data transmission networks. Via<br>
each data transmission network, the payment service<br>
equipment PS has the access to the information system<br>
of each company offering a payment card.<br>
Connected to the payment service equipment PS<br>
is also a payment system BANK. The payment system BANK<br>
is generally used to mean a system which actually deb-<br>
its the client's payment card and correspondingly<br>
credits the account of the service provider SP with<br>
the same sum.<br>
The payment service equipment PS may, when<br>
required, be separated from the telecommunication net-<br>
work NET by using a firewall. The firewall is used to<br>
mean a software or hardware configuration which is<br>
used to try to prevent the unauthorized access of ex-<br>
traneous entities to the resources of some company or<br>
system.<br>
Fig. 3 is one advantageous flow chart illus-<br>
tratinq *-&gt;^ fnnrt-inn of the present invention. The ex-<br>
ample as shown in Fig. 3 comprises a display device<br>
DTE, a payment terminal device PTE, a smart card SIM<br>
inserted into the payment terminal device PTE, a serv-<br>
ice provider SP, payment service equipment PS, a cer-<br>
tificate database CERT, an authentication system AUT<br>
and a payment system BANK. The display terminal device<br>
DTE is advantageously used to mean an ordinary com-<br>
puter. The payment terminal device PTE is advanta-<br>
geously used to mean a mobile station and the smart<br>
card SIM the subscriber identity module of the mobile<br>
station.<br>
The rhomb 3 0 is used to describe the actions<br>
the client takes via the computer DTE. The client<br>
chooses the www site connected with the service of-<br>
fered by the service provider SP. The service provided<br>
by the service provider may require a registration. In<br>
conjunction with the registering to the service the<br>
client transmits information about himself/herself to<br>
the service provider SP. The information may include,<br>
e.g. a name, address and mobile number. The access to<br>
the www sites required by the service may require that<br>
the client inputs a client identifier and a password.<br>
In addition, the client has got a certificate issued<br>
by a trusted third party. The certificate has been<br>
saved, e.g. to the certificate database of the payment<br>
service equipment PS. The payment service equipment PS<br>
comprises, for instance, a database which comprises<br>
all the service providers who have made a contract<br>
about the use of the payment service equipment PS. The<br>
service provider database includes, e.g. information<br>
about the payment cards accepted by the service pro-<br>
vider and about the bankers of the service provider.<br>
The information included in the service provider data-<br>
base may be encrypted, e.g. with the public key of the<br>
payment service equipment, if required.<br>
The arrow 31 is used to describe the informa-<br>
tion which the client transmits to the service pro-<br>
vider SP via the www site. This is used to mean that<br>
the client has chosen the desired products and/or<br>
services via the www site of the service provider SP.<br>
In addition, he or she chooses the desired payment<br>
mode, which in this example is a Visa card. The client<br>
may be requested to fill in also his or her mobile<br>
number on the form. When all the necessary information<br>
has been filled in/chosen, the client sends the order,<br>
e.g. by pushing the pay button on the www site. As a<br>
consequence of pushing the pay button, the client may<br>
be displayed the www site produced by the payment<br>
service equipment.<br>
The service provider SP sends the information<br>
received from the client to the payment service equip-<br>
ment PS, arrow 32. The service provider SP may send to<br>
the payment service equipment PS also information<br>
which the user himself/herself has not input into the<br>
www site. This kind of information may be, e.g. the<br>
mobile number included in the registration information<br>
of the client, the name or identifier of the service<br>
provider SP, the total sum of the products or services<br>
ordered and the date. The information sent by the<br>
service provider SP to the payment service equipment<br>
PS may be encrypted, if required, or a check sum may<br>
be computed at it using, e.g. a hash function. The<br>
Hash function is used to mean a function which gener-<br>
ates an individual check sum from a given input. This<br>
enables one to make sure of the integrity of the in-<br>
formation transferred. The generation of an encryption<br>
or check sum is, however, not necessary because the<br>
information sent by the service provider SP is not<br>
sensitive in itself. Let it be mentioned that the<br>
service provider SP does not at any point send to the<br>
payment service equipment PS more detailed information<br>
relating to the payment card of the client, e.g. the<br>
number of the payment card or its validity. As con-<br>
cerns the payment card of the client, the service pro-<br>
vider SP may send to the payment service equipment PS<br>
only the piece of information concerning the payment<br>
card company, i.e. that the payment card is, e.g.<br>
Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club or a bank card.<br>
The payment service equipment PS sends the<br>
confirmation of order to the mobile station PTE of the<br>
client, e.g. as a short message based on the informa-<br>
tion received from the service provider SP, arrow 33a.<br>
The confirmation of order includes information relat-<br>
ing to the order made by the client. This kind of in-<br>
formation is, e.g. the date, the products and services<br>
ordered, the total sum etc. The client checks the in-<br>
formation of the confirmation of order. If the infor-<br>
mation included in the confirmation of order is cor-<br>
rect, the client signs the confirmation of order with<br>
his or her own private signing key. It is possible to<br>
store to the subscriber identity module SIM the elec-<br>
tronic identity associated with the holder and the<br>
private key of the holder. The private key is advanta-<br>
geously used to refer to the private key consistent<br>
with the PKI system. The signing with the mobile sta-<br>
tion may require that the client inputs into his or<br>
her mobile station a predetermined code, e.g. a PIN<br>
code (PIN, Personal Identification Number).<br>
In addition to the confirmation of order, the<br>
client sends to the payment service equipment his or<br>
her own electronic identity from his or her mobile<br>
station PTE, arrow 3 3b. The payment service equipment<br>
PS receives the information sent from the mobile sta-<br>
tion PTE and checks the signature of the client in the<br>
certificate database CERT connected to the payment<br>
service equipment PS, arrows 34a and 34b. The right to<br>
read the certificate database CERT belongs solely to<br>
the payment service equipment PS. The payment service<br>
equipment PS further authenticates the client's signa-<br>
ture and electronic identity, e.g. by utilizing the<br>
client database.<br>
When the clien'ts identity has been verified,<br>
the payment service equipment PS finds out the credit<br>
card number of the client. This functionality is de-<br>
scribed by rhomb 35. The payment card number is<br>
checked, e.g. in the client database attached to the<br>
payment service equipment PS. The information included<br>
in the client database has been encrypted with the<br>
public key of the payment service equipment PS. In<br>
this way, only the payment service equipment PS can<br>
decode the information included in the client database<br>
into a readable form with its own private key. The<br>
client's payment card number may alternatively be<br>
saved to the client-specific certificate of the cer-<br>
tificate database CERT.<br>
When the payment service equipment PS has<br>
found the client's payment card number, it is sent to<br>
the authentication system AUT to be checked, arrow<br>
36a. The authentication system AUT checks that the<br>
card indicated by the payment card number is valid.<br>
The authentication system AUT returns the result of<br>
the validity checking back to the payment service<br>
equipment PS, arrow 3 6b.<br>
The payment connected with the order made by<br>
the client may now be effected. Prior to accepting the<br>
payment, it is possible to check in the verification<br>
database attached to the payment service equipment PS<br>
that the client's payment card is not among suspicious<br>
or forbidden cards. The payment service equipment PS<br>
sends a confirmation of the effecting of the payment<br>
both to the service provider SP and to the client, ar-<br>
rows 3 7a and 3 7b. The command to effect the payment<br>
may now be sent to the payment system BANK, arrow 38.<br>
The payment system BANK debits the client's payment<br>
card with the sum shown by the order and correspond-<br>
ingly credits the account of the service provider SP<br>
with the same sum.<br>
Vouchers of all the orders made may be stored<br>
to the transaction database attached to the payment<br>
service equipment PS. The data record to be stored to<br>
the database includes, e.g. the following information:<br>
the electronic identity information of the cli-<br>
ent, the payment card details, account number,<br>
name and address,<br>
total sum of the order,<br>
recipient,<br>
date<br>
client's signature,<br>
authentication code,<br>
time stamp which has been received from a cer-<br>
tificate authority.<br>
In an embodiment as shown in Fig. 3, the pay-<br>
ment service equipment PS may comprise a functionality<br>
that the use of a certain payment card requires the<br>
use of a certain mobile number. This is used to mean<br>
that if the client wishes to pay his or her purchases,<br>
e.g. with a VISA card, he or she has to have a certain<br>
subscriber identity module SIM inserted into his or<br>
her mobile station.<br>
In an embodiment as shown in Fig. 3, both the<br>
payment terminal device PTE and the display device DTE<br>
are used to mean physically the same device, prefera-<br>
bly a mobile station.<br>
Fig. 4 is one advantageous signaling flow<br>
chart illustrating the function of the present inven-<br>
tion. The example as shown in Fig. 4 comprises a ter-<br>
minal device TE, a card reader SRC attached to the<br>
terminal device and a smart card SC compatible with<br>
it, a service provider SP, payment service equipment<br>
PS, a certificate database CERT, an authentication<br>
system AUT and a payment system BANK. The terminal de-<br>
vice TE is advantageously used to mean a computer.<br>
The rhomb 4 0 is used to describe the actions<br>
the client takes via the computer TE. The client<br>
chooses the www site connected with the service of-<br>
fered by the service provider SP. The service provided<br>
by the service provider may require a registration, in<br>
conjunction with the registering to the service the<br>
client transmits information about himself/herself to<br>
the service provider SP. This kind of information may<br>
include, e.g. a name, address and mobile number. The<br>
access to the www sites required by the service may<br>
require that the client inputs a client identifier and<br>
a password. In addition, the client has got a certifi-<br>
cate issued by a trusted third party. The certificate<br>
has been saved, e.g. to the certificate database of<br>
the payment service equipment PS. The payment service<br>
equipment PS comprises, for instance, a database which<br>
comprises all the service providers who have made a<br>
contract about the use of the payment service equip-<br>
ment PS. The service provider database includes, e.g.<br>
information about the payment cards accepted by the<br>
service provider and about the bankers of the service<br>
provider. The information included in the service pro-<br>
vider database may be encrypted, e.g. with the public<br>
key of the payment service equipment, if required.<br>
The arrow 41 is used to describe the informa-<br>
tion which the client transmits to the service pro-<br>
vider SP via the www site. This is used to mean that<br>
the client has chosen the desired products and/or<br>
services via the www site of the service provider SP.<br>
In addition, he or she chooses the desired payment<br>
mode, which in this example is a Visa card. The client<br>
may be requested to fill in also his or her mobile<br>
number on the form. When all the necessary information<br>
has been filled in/chosen, the client sends the order,<br>
e.g. by pushing the pay button on the www site. As a<br>
consequence of pushing the pay button, the client may<br>
be displayed the www site produced by the payment<br>
service equipment.<br>
The service provider SP sends the information<br>
received from the client to the payment service equip-<br>
ment PS, arrow 42. The service provider SP may send to<br>
the payment service equipment PS also information<br>
which the user himself/herself has not input into the<br>
www site. This kind of information may be, e.g. the<br>
mobile number included in the registration information<br>
of the client, the name or identifier of the service<br>
provider SP, the total sum of the products or services<br>
ordered and the date. The information sent by the<br>
service provider SP to the payment service equipment<br>
PS may be encrypted, if required, or a check sum may<br>
be computed at it using, e.g. a hash function. The<br>
Hash function is used to mean a function which gener-<br>
ates an individual check sum from a given input. This<br>
enables one to make sure of the integrity of the in-<br>
formation transferred. The generation of an encryption<br>
or check sum is, however, not necessary because the<br>
information sent by the service provider SP is not<br>
sensitive in itself. Let it be mentioned that the<br>
service provider SP does not at any point send to the<br>
payment service equipment PS more detailed information<br>
relating to the payment card of the client, e.g. the<br>
number of the payment card or its validity. As con-<br>
cerns the payment card of the client, the service pro-<br>
vider SP may send to the payment service equipment PS<br>
only the piece of information concerning the payment<br>
card company, i.e. that the payment card is, e.g.<br>
Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club or a bank card.<br>
The payment service equipment PS sends the<br>
confirmation of order to the terminal device TE of the<br>
client based on the information received from the<br>
service provider SP, arrow 43a. The confirmation of<br>
order includes information relating to the order made<br>
by the client. This kind of information is, e.g. the<br>
date, the products and services ordered, the total sum<br>
etc. The client checks the information of the confir-<br>
mation of order. If the information included in the<br>
confirmation of order is correct, the client signs the<br>
confirmation of order with his or her own private<br>
signing key. The signature is carried out by means of<br>
a card reader SCR attached to the computer TE and by<br>
means of a client's smart card compatible with it.<br>
Stored on the smart card SC are the electronic iden-<br>
tity associated with the holder of the smart card SC<br>
and the private key of the holder. The private key is<br>
advantageously used to refer to the private key con-<br>
sistent with the PKI system. The signing by means of<br>
the terminal device TE and the card reader SCR may re-<br>
quire that the client inputs into his or her mobile<br>
station a predetermined code, e.g. a PIN code (PIN,<br>
Personal Identification Number).<br>
In addition to the confirmation of order, the<br>
client sends to the payment service equipment PS his<br>
or her own electronic identity from his or her mobile<br>
station PTE, arrow 43b. The payment service equipment<br>
PS receives the information sent by the computer TE<br>
and checks the signature of the client in the certifi-<br>
cate database CERT attached to the payment service<br>
equipment PS, arrows 44a and 4 4b. The right to read<br>
the certificate database CERT belongs solely to the<br>
payment service equipment PS. The payment service<br>
equipment PS further authenticates the client's signa-<br>
ture and electronic identity, e.g. by utilizing the<br>
client database.<br>
When the client's identity has been verified,<br>
the payment service equipment PS finds out the credit<br>
card number of the client. This functionality is de-<br>
scribed by rhomb 45. The payment card number is<br>
checked, e.g. in the client database attached to the<br>
payment service equipment PS. The information included<br>
in the client database has been encrypted with the<br>
public key of the payment service equipment PS. In<br>
this way, only the payment service equipment PS can<br>
decode the information included in the client database<br>
into a readable form with its own private key. The<br>
client's payment card number may alternatively be<br>
saved to the client-specific certificate of the cer-<br>
tificate database CERT.<br>
When the payment service equipment PS has<br>
found the client's payment card number, it is sent to<br>
the authentication system AUT to be checked, arrow<br>
46a. The authentication system AUT checks that the<br>
card indicated by the payment card number is valid.<br>
The authentication system AUT returns the result of<br>
the validity checking back to the payment service<br>
equipment PS, arrow 4 6b.<br>
The payment connected with the order made by<br>
the client may now be effected. Prior to accepting the<br>
payment, it is possible to check in the verification<br>
database attached to the payment service equipment PS<br>
that the client's payment card is not among suspicious<br>
or forbidden cards. The payment service equipment PS<br>
sends a confirmation of the effecting of the payment<br>
both to the service provider SP and to the client, ar-<br>
rows 4 7a and 4 7b. The command to effect the payment<br>
may now be sent to the payment system BANK, arrow 48.<br>
The payment system BANK debits the client's payment<br>
card with the sum shown by the order and correspond-<br>
ingly credits the account of the service provider SP<br>
with the same sum.<br>
Vouchers of all the orders made may be stored<br>
to the transaction database attached to the payment<br>
service equipment PS. The data record to be stored to<br>
the database includes, e.g. the following information:<br>
- the electronic identity information of the cli-<br>

The invention relates to implementing paying with a payment card via an<br>
information network so that the payment is secure and that the number of the<br>
client's payment card needs not to be transmitted over a data transmission<br>
network. The client is requested for a separate confirmation for effecting the<br>
payment. The piece of information to be confirmed is sent to a terminal device<br>
(PTE) of the client by means of which the client confirms the order by digitally<br>
signing the confirmation. The signed confirmation and electronic identity<br>
information associated with the client is sent back to a payment service<br>
equipment (PS). The payment service equipment (PS) verifies the client's<br>
identity, checks the validity of the client's payment card and transmits the<br>
payment information to a payment system (BANK).</td>
