The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br>
20-12-2004<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a linearly reciprocating bottle blowing system and its blowing method in which a single injection-molding mechanism is set at the center, two bottle-blowing mechanisms and two bottle-ejection mechanisms are symmetrically provided at two sides of the injection-molding mechanism, and two slides are driven to carry the respective workpiece to the injection-molding mechanism, the bottle-blowing mechanism and the bottle-ejection mechanisms respectively.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art:<br>
Bottle blowing techniques are well known, and intensively employed to blow   bottles or like containers for beverage, perfume, medicines, etc.<br>
During bottle blowing, high polymer material is injection-molded into a hollow<br>
  bottle blank in a mold through an injection-molding mechanism, and then the bottle<br>
blank is blown with a compressed flow of air in a bottle mold, and then the<br>
shape-formed blown bottle is ejected out of the mold. During blowing action, the<br>
threaded bottle neck is held by holder means or the like for blowing.<br>
The injection-molding, bottle-blowing, and bottle-ejection procedures take much time to complete. Normally, the injection-molding action takes about 16 seconds, and the other two actions require a relatively shorter time to complete. Because the total time required to complete the bottle-blowing action and the bottle-ejection action does not exceed by 16 seconds, the bottle-blowing mechanism and the bottle-ejection mechanism may run idle during the operation of the injection-molding mechanism. Therefore, in a bottle blowing system having one single injection-molding mechanism with one single bottle-blowing mechanism and<br><br><br>
one single bottle-ejection mechanism, the injection-molding mechanism can not be fully utilized.<br>
Further, according to conventional bottle blowing systems, JtottleJ&gt;lank is rested for a certain length of time, and then moved to the bottle-blowing mechanism for blowing. Before blowing, the bottle blank must be pre-heated. This pre-heating process wastes much time.<br>
There are known fully automatic bottle blowing systems. These fully automatic bottle blowing systems are functional; however, these fully automatic bottle blowing     systems are heavy,  bulky,  and  expensive,  because they are commonly of  circulatory design. Further, these fully automatic bottle blowing systems consume much electric energy. <br><br>
SUMMARYOF THE INVENTION <br>
The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances in view. It is the main object of the present invention to provide a bottle blowing system,   which is a Ijnearjy reciprocating design. It is another object of the present invention to provide a linearly reciprocating bottle blowing system, which greatly reduces bottle blowing cost. It is still another object of the present invention to jprqvide^ linearly reciprocating bottle blowing system, which saves electric energy consumption.<br>
To achieve these and other objects of the present invention, the linearly reciprocating bottle blowing system comprises an injection-molding mechanism; a left-hand bottle-blowing mechanism disposed at the left side of the injection-molding mechanism; | right-hand bottle-blowing mechanism disposed at<br>
ihe right side of the injection-molding mechanism; a left-hand bottle-ejection<br>
i	■■■•  ..	)<br>
/mechanism disposed at the left side of the left-hand bottle-blowing mechanism; a<br>
right-hand   bottle-ejection   mechanism   disposed   at   the   right   side   of   the<br>
bottle-blowing mechanism; a left-hand slide controlled by a program-controled<br>
driving rod to move along a rail at a machine base and to the positions in the<br><br><br>
injection-molding mechanism, the left-hand bottle-blowing mechanism, and the<br>
left-hand bottle-ejection mechanism selectively; and a right-hand slide controlled by<br>
a program-controlled driving rod to move along a fail at the machine base on which<br>
the left-hand slide is moved to the positions in the injection molding mechanism,<br>
the right-hand bottle-blowing mechanism, and the right-hand bottle-ejection<br>
mechanism selectively.	<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1-6, a linearly reciprocating bottle blowing system in accordance with  the  present  invention  is  shown  comprised  of a  left-hand<br>
reciprocating slide 1, a right-hand reciprocating slide 2, an injection-molding mechanism 3, a left-hand bottle blowing mechanism 4, a right-hand bottle blowing mechanism 5, a left-hand bottle-ejecting mechanism 6, and a right-hand bottle-ejecting mechanism 7.<br>
The left-hand slide 1 is adapted to hold a mouth mold, which is synchronously moved with the left-hand slide 1 and adapted to mold a bottle neck for blowing a bottle. The left-hand slide 1 is driven by a program-controlled driving rod 11 to move along a rail 12 at the machine base. The driving rod 11 can be driven by a hydraulic cylinder, air cylinder, or server.<br>
The right-hand slide 2 is driven by a program-controlled driving rod 21 to move along a rail 22 at the machine base. The left-hand slide 1 and the right-hand slide 2 are respectively controlled to move along the rails 12 and 22 at two sides of the injection-molding mechanism 3 without passing over the injection-molding mechanism 3.<br>
The injection-molding mechanism 3 is provided on the middle, having a top die 31 and a bottom die 32. During injection molding operation, the top die 31 and the bottom die 32 are clamped on the mouth mold at the left-hand slide 1 and the mouth mold at the right-hand slide 2. This injection molding technique is of the known art and not within the scope of the present invention, no further detailed description in this regard is necessary.<br>
The left-hand bottle blowing mechanism 4 is provided at the left side of the injection-molding mechanism 3 corresponding to the left-hand slide 1 for blowing bottles.<br>
The right-hand bottle blowing mechanism 5 is provided at the right side of the         injection-molding mechanism 3 corresponding to the right-hand slide 2 for blowing bottles.<br>
The left-hand bottle-ejecting mechanism 6 is provided at the outer side, namely,<br><br>
the left side of the left-hand bottle blowing mechanism 4, and adapted to eject the shape-formed bottle out of the mouth mold at the left-hand slide 1.<br>
The right-hand bottle-ejecting mechanism 7 is provided at the outer side, namely, the right side of the right-hand bottle blowing mechanism 5, and adapted to eject the shape-formed bottle out of the mouth mold at the right-hand slide 2.<br>
By means of the control of a software program, the left-hand slide 1 and the respective mouth mold are moved along the left-hand rail 12 and positioned in the injection-molding mechanism 3, and the left-hand bottle blowing mechanism 4 and the left-hand bottle-ejecting mechanism 6 are driven to blow bottle and to eject shape-formed bottle respectively in proper order. The right-hand slide 2 and the right-hand bottle blowing mechanism 5 and the right-hand bottle-ejecting mechanism 7 are controlled by the software program to operate in proper order.<br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the left-hand slide 1 and the respective mouth mold are positioned in the injection-molding mechanism 3, and then the injection-molding mechanism 3 is operated to blow a bottle blank in the mouth mold at the left-hand slide 1. At this time, the right-hand slide 2 is at the position of the right-hand bottle-ejecting mechanism 7.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the left-hand slide 1 is still in the injection action, at this time the right-hand slide 2 is moved to the stand-by position at the right-hand bottle blowing mechanism 5, and the mouth mold at the left-hand slide 1 is empty.<br>
FIG. 5 shows the left-hand slide 1 with the injection-molded bottle blank moved to the left-hand bottle blowing mechanism 4 for blowing, and at the same time the right-hand slide 2 is moved to the position at the injection-molding mechanism 3 for injection-molding a bottle blank.<br>
FIG. 6 shows the right-hand slide 2 in the injection-molding position, the left-hand slide 1 is moved to the left-hand bottle-ejecting mechanism 6 for enabling<br><br>
the blown bottle to be ejected put of the respective mouth mold.<br>
Thereafter, the right-hand slide 2 is moved rightwards from the injection-molding mechanism 3 to the bottle blowing position, and the left-hand slide 1 is moved to the injection-molding position at the injection-molding mechanism 3. The aforesaid procedure is repeated again and again, enabling bottle blank injection action, bottle blowing action, and bottle ejecting action to be fully automatically performed. According to actual practice, the left-hand slide 1 and the right-hand slide 3 are operated as follows:<br>
(1)	the left-hand slide 1 in injection-molding action, the right-hand slide 2 in stand-by position at the right-hand bottle blowing mechanism 5;<br>
(2)	the left-hand slide 1 in bottle-blowing action, the right-hand slide 2 in injection-molding action at the injection-molding mechanism 3;<br>
(3)	the left-hand slide 1 in bottle-ejection action, the right-hand slide 2 in injection-molding action at the injection-molding mechanism 3;<br>
(4)	the left-hand slide 1 in stand-by position, the right-hand slide 2 in injection-molding action at the injection-molding mechanism 3;<br>
(5)	the left-hand slide 1 in injection-molding action, the right-hand slide 2 in bottle-blowing action at the right-hand bottle blowing mechanism 5;<br>
(6)	the left-hand slide 1 in injection-molding action, the right-hand slide 2 in bottle-ejection action at the right-hand bottle-ejecting mechanism 7;<br>
(7)	the left-hand slide 1 in injection-molding action, the right-hand slide 2 in stand-by position at the right-hand bottle-blowing mechanism 5;<br>
(8)	the left-hand slide 1 in bottle-blowing action, the right-hand slide 2 in injection-molding action at the injection-molding mechanism 3.<br>
As indicated above, the left slide 1 and the right slide 2 are respectively<br><br>
reciprocated and alternatively moved in and out of the injection-molding mechanism 3, enabling the injection-molding mechanism 3 to be continuously operated without interruption. Because the invention is a reciprocating design not<br>
like the conventional circulatory design, the longitudinal depth of the machine can    *<br>
be minimized. Further, because linear motion does not cause a centrifugal force,<br>
the machine base is maintained stable without vibration during the operation of the<br>
bottle blowing system.<br>
A prototype of linearly reciprocating bottle blowing system and its blowing method has been constructed with the features of FIGS. 1-6. The linearly reciprocating bottle blowing system and its blowing method functions smoothly to provide all of the features discussed earlier.<br>
Although a particular embodiment of the invention has been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited except as by the appended claims.<br><br>
