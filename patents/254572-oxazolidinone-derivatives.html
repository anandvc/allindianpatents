				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds of the general formula (I), their stereoisomers, their derivatives, and their pharmaceutically acceptable, salts and compositions. The present invention more particularly provides novel Oxazolidinone derivatives of the general formula (I).<br><br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the above said novel Oxazolidinone derivatives of the formula (I), their stereoisomers, their derivatives, their pharmaceutically acceptable, salts and compositions.<br>
The novel Oxazolidinone derivatives of the present invention are expected to be more soluble and can be easily formulated in a appropriate vehicle for the purpose of intravenous delivery. Also the present invention provides methods and exemplary compounds with enhanced solubility, which might be useful for the design of better compounds with improved therapeutic index towards second-generation Oxazolidinone antibacterials.<br>
The novel Oxazolidinone derivatives of the present invention may be useful as antibacterial agents, particularly for intravenous injections, and are also useful in the treatment of conditions such as nosocomial pneumoniae, community acquired pneumoniae, Vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) caused by Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and penicillin resistant Streptococcus Pneumoniae. The compounds of the present invention are effective against a number of human or animal pathogens, clinical isolates, including Vancomycin, and Methicillin resistant organisms.<br><br>
Background of Invention<br>
The Oxazolidinone class of compounds represents totally synthetic antibacterials endowed with a mechanism different from the mode of action of known antibacterial compounds. The Oxazolidinones interact with 50S ribosomal subunit to form an initiation complex and thus prevent the bacterial translation necessary for the replication of the bacteria. These compounds had shown antibacterial activity against gram +ve organisms and a host of opportunistic pathogens such as Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), penicillin resistant Streptococcus Pneumoniae (PRSP), and Vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE), The best-represented compounds are Linezolid and Eperezolid, Linezolid being approved by the US FDA for treatment of severe bacterial infections. A lot of work had been done however; there is still a need for research to extend the activity of Oxazolidinones to act against gram -ve pathogens. Some literature and patents are available where efforts have been made to modify the Oxazolidinone moiety to impart the gram -ve activity. In the literature there are many inventions in this class of compounds but there are problems regarding bioavailability, metabolic stability and in particular solubility. It is also mentioned in the literature that the Oxazolidinone antibacterials developed had severe problems of rapid metabolism or have poor permeability. The present compounds represented by this patent have largely alleviated solubility and represent a novel class of Oxazolidinone compounds with very good water solubility.<br>
Several Oxazolidinone derivatives have been reported in the literature. Few prior art reference which disclose the closest Oxazolidinone derivatives are given here: 1. US 5,547,950 discloses and claims compounds of formula (I),<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The following compound was prepared according to the procedure given in the Example 11<br><br>
Antimicrobial Activity<br>
The compounds of the present invention showed in vitro antibacterial activity when tested by the Agar Dilution Method as specified in documents published by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), USA (now CLSI).<br><br>
Briefly, the compounds of the invention were weighed, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, serially two fold diluted in the same solvent and then incorporated into molten Mueller Hinton Agar in a petridish before solidification, with each petridish containing a different concentration of a compound.<br>
The bacterial inoculum was prepared by picking 3 to 5 well isolated bacterial colonies with the same morphological appearance from an 18-24 hours old culture with an inoculating loop, then transferring the growth to a tube containing 3 ml of normal saline and adjusting the turbidity of the saline suspension to 0.5 Me Farland Turbidity Standard equivalent to a bacterial<br>
Q<br>
population of 1.5 x 10 colony forming units (CFU) per ml of the suspension. The suspension was diluted 1:10 in saline (i.e. 0.5 ml suspension + 4.5 ml saline) to get a bacterial population of 1.5 x 107 cfu/ml as inoculum.<br>
The bacterial inoculum prepared in the above manner was inoculated onto petri dishes containing Mueller Hinton Agar which had earlier been incorporated with different dilutions of the compounds of invention by a Multipoint Inoculator with each inoculum spot containing approximately,1 x 104 colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria.<br>
The inoculated petridishes were incubated at 35°C in an ambient atmosphere for 16-20 hours. Petridishes containing different concentrations of Vancomycin and Oxacillin and inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase Negative Staphylococci and Enterococci were incubated for 24 hours.<br>
The petridishes after incubation were placed on a dark non-reflecting surface and the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was recorded as the concentration, which showed no growth of the inoculated culture.<br>
1)	S.aureus - Staphylococus aureus<br>
2)	S.epidermidis - Staphylococcus epidermidis<br>
3)	E.faecium - Enterococcus faecium<br>
4)	E.faecalis - Enterococcus faecalis<br>
5)	M.catarrhalis - Moraxella catarrhalis</td>
