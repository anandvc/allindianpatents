This invention is also directed to the methods of treating cancer described herein, particulariy those described above, wherein in addition to the administration of the FPT inhibitor and antineoplastic agents radiation therapy is also administered prior to, during, or after the treatment cycle.<br>
it is believed that this invention also provides a method for inhibiting or treating proliferative diseases, both benign and malignant, wherein Ras proteins are abenrantly activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in other genes-i.e.. the Ras gene itself is not activated by mutation to an oncogenic fomi-with said inhibition or treatment being accomplished by the administration of an effective amount (e.g. a therapeutically effective amount) of one or more (e.g., one) compounds of the invention to a mammal (e.g., a human) in need of such treatment. For example, the benign proliferative disorder neurofibromatosis, or tumors in which Ras is activated due to mutation or overexpression of tyrosine kinase oncogenes (e.g., neu, src, abl, Ick, and fyn), may be inhibited or treated by the tricyclic compounds described herein.<br>
The compounds of the invention useful in the methods of this invention inhibit or treat the abnormal growth of cells. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed thai these compounds may function through the inhibition of G-prolein function, such as Ras p21, by blocking G-protein isoprenylatlon, thus making them useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as tumor growth and cancer. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these compounds inhibit ras famesyl protein transferase, and thus show antiproliferative activity against ras transfomied cells.<br>
The method of treating proliferative diseases (cancers, i.e., tumors), according to this invention, includes a method for treating (inhibiting) the abnormal grofwth of celts, including transformed cells, in a, by administering, concun-ently or sequentially, an effective amount of a compound of this invention and an effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the methods of the present invention include methods for treating or inhibiting tumor growth in a patient in need of such treatment by administering, concurrently or sequentially, (1) an effective amount of a compound of this invention and (2) an effective amount of at least one antineoplastic agent, microtubule affecting agent and/or radiation therapy. For example, one embodiment<br><br>
of these methods is directed to a method of treating cancers selected from the group consisting of: lung cancer, prostate cancer and myeloid leukemias.<br>
The methods of treating proliferative diseases, according to this invention, also include a method for treating (inhibiting) proliferative diseases, both benign and malignant, wherein ras proteins are aben"antly activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in other genes - i.e., the ras gene itself is not activated by mutation to an oncogenic form. This method comprises administering, concurrency or sequenlJaHy, an effective amount of a compound of this invention and an effective amount of an antineoplastic agent and/or radiation therapy to a patient in need of such treatment. Examples of such proliferative diseases which may be treated include: the benign proliferative disorder neurofibromatosis, or tumors in which ras Is activated due to mutation or overexpression of tyrosine kinase oncogenes (e.g., neu, src, abl, IcK, !yn, fyn).<br>
For radiation therapy, y-radlation is preferred.<br>
The methods of treating proliferative diseases (cancers, i.e., tumors), according to this invention, also include a method for treating (inhibiting) the abnomial growth of cells, including transfomied cells, in a patient in need of such treatment, by administering, concurrently or sequentially, an effective amount of a compound of this invention and an effective amount of at least one signal transduction Inhibitor.<br>
Typical signal transduction Inhibitors include but are not limited to:<br>
(i) Bcr/abI kinase inhibitors such as, for example. STt 571 (Gleevec);<br>
(ii) Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor inhibitor such as, for example. Kinase inhibitors (Iressa, OSI-774) and antibodies {Imclone: C225 [Goldstein et at. (1995), Clin Cancer Res, 1:1311-1318], and Abgenix: ABX-EGF) and<br>
(iii) HER-2/neu receptor inhibitors such as. for example. Herceptin® (trastuzumab).<br>
Embodiments of the metfiods of treatment of this invention are directed to the use of a combination of dnjgs (compounds) for the treatment of cancer, i.e., this invention is directed to a combination therapy for the treatment of cancer. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the dnjgs are generally administered individually as a phamiaceutical composition. The use of a pharmaceutical composition comprising more than one dnjg is within the scope of this invention.<br><br>
The antineoplastic agents are usually administered in the dosage forms that are readily available to the skilled clinician, and are generally administered in their normally prescribed amounts (as for example, the amounts described in the Physician"s Desk Reference, 56"" Edition, 2002 (published by Medical Economics company, Inc. Montvale, NJ 07645-1742 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto), or the amounts described in the manufacture"s literature for the use of the agent).<br>
For example, the FPT Inhibitor can be administered orally (e.g., as a capsule), and the antineoplastic agents can be administered intravenously, usually as an IV solution. The use of a pharmaceutical composition comprising more than one drug is within the scope of this invention.<br>
The FPT inhibitor and the antineoplastic agents are administered in therapeutically effective dosages to obtain clinically acceptable results, e.g., reduction or elimination of symptoms or of the tumor. Thus, the FPT inhibitor and antineoplastic agents can be administered concurrently or consecutively in a treatment protocol. The administration of the antineoplastic agents can be made according to treatment protocols already known in the art.<br>
The FPT inhibitor and antineoplastic agents are administered in a treatment protocol that usually lasts one to seven weeks, and is repeated typically from 6 to 12 times. Generally the treatment protocol lasts one to four weeks. Treatment protocols of one to three weeks may also be used. A treatment protocol of one to two weeks may also be used. During this treatment protocol or cycle the FPT inhibitor is administered daily while the antineoplastic agents are administered one or more times a week. Generally, the FPT inhibitor can be administered daily (i.e., once per day), preferably twice per day, and the antineoplastic agent is administered once a week or once every three weeks. For example, the taxanes (e.g., Paclitaxel (e.g., Taxol®) or Docetaxel (e.g.,Taxotere®)) can be administered once a week or once every three weeks.<br>
However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that treatment protocols cart be varied according to the needs of the patient. Thus, the combination of compounds (drugs) used in the methods of this invention can be administered in variations of the pnDtocols described above. For example, the FPT inhibitor can be administered discontinuously rather than continuously during the treatment cycle. Thus, for<br><br>
example, during the treatment cycle the FPT inhibitor can be administered dally for a week and then discontinued for a week, with this administration repeating during the treatment cycle. Or the FPT inhibitor can be administered daily for two weeks and discontinued for a week, with this administration repeating during the treatment cycle. Thus, the FPT inhibitor can be administered daily for one or more weeks during the cycle and discontinued for one or more weeks during the cycle, with this pattern of administration repeating during the treatment cycle. This discontinuous treatment can also be based upon numbers of days rather than a full week. For example, daily dosing for 1 to 6 days, no dosing for 1 to 6 days with this pattern repeating during the treatment protocol. The number of days (or weeks) wherein the FPT inhibitor is not dosed does not have to equal the number of days (or weeks) wherein the FPT inhibitor is dosed. Usually, if a discontinuous dosing protocol is used, the number of days or weeks that the FPT inhibitor is dosed is at least equal or greater than the number of days or weeks that the FPT inhibitor is not dosed.<br>
The antineoplastic agent could be given by bolus or continuous infusion. The antineoplastic agent could be given daily to once every week, or once every two weeks, or once every three weeks, or once every four weeks during the treatment cycle. If administered daily during a treatment cycle, this daily dosing can be discontinuous over the number of weeks of the treatment cycle- For example, dosed for a week (or a number of days), no dosing for a week (or a number of days, with the pattern repeating during the treatment cycle.<br>
The FPT inhibitor can be administered orally, preferably as a solid dosage fofm, more preferably a capsule, and while the total therapeutically effective daily dose can be administered in one to four, or one to two divided doses per day, generally, the therapeutically effective dose is given once or twic^a day, preferably twice a day. The FPT Inhibitor can be administered in an amount of about 50 to about 400 mg once per day, and can be administered in an amount of about 50 to about 300 mg once per day. The FPT inhibitor is generally administered in an amount of about 50 to about 350 mg twice a day, usually 50 mg to about 200 mg twice a day. preferably, about 75 mg to about 125 mg administered twice a day, and most preferably about 100 mg administered twice a day.<br>
If the patient is responding, or is stable, after completion of the therapy cycle, the therapy cycle can be repeated according to the judgment of Uie skilled clinician.<br><br>
upon completion of the therapy cycles, the patient can be continued on the FPT inhibitor at the same dose that was administered in the treatment protocol, or, if the dose was less than 200mg twice a day, the dose can be raised to 200 mg twice a day, This maintenance dose can be continued until the patient progresses or can no longer tolerate the dose (in which case the dose can be reduced and the patient can be continued on the reduced dose).<br>
The antineoplastic agents used with the FPT inhibitor are administered in their normally prescribed dosages during the treatment cycle (i.e., the antineoplastic agents are administered acconding to the standard of practice for the administration of these dojgs).

In general when more than one antineoplastic agent is used in the methods of this Invention, the antineoplastic agents are administered on the same day either concurrently or consecutiveiy in their standard dosage form. For example, the antineoplastic agents are usually administered intravenously, preferably by an IV drip using IV solutions well known in the art (e.g., isotonic saline (0.9% NaCI) or dextrose solution (e.g., 5% dextrose)).<br>
When two or more antineoplastic agents are used, the antineoplastic agents are generally administered on the same day; however, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the antineoplastic agents can be administered on different days and in different weeks. The skilled clinician can administer the antineoplastic agents according to their recommended dosage schedule from the manufacturer of the agent and can adjust the schedule according to the needs of the patient, e.g.. based on the patient"s response to the treatment. For example, when gemcitabine is used in combination with a platinum coordinator compound, such as, for example, cisplatin, to treat lung cancer, both the gemcitabine and the cisplatin are given on the same day ■ on day one of the treatment cycle, and then gemcitabine is given alone on day 8 and given alone again on day 15<br>

The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Detemiination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art<br>
The amount and frequency of administration of the FPT inhibitor and the antineoplastic agents will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician (physician) considering such factors as age. condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the cancer being treated.<br>
The antineoplastic agent can be administered according to.lherapeutic protocols well known in the art. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the administration of the antineoplastic agent can be varied depending on the cancer being treated and the known effects of the antineoplastic agent on that disease. Also. in accordance with the knowledge of the skilled clinician, the therapeutic protocols (e.g., dosage amounts and times of administration) can be varied in view of the obsen/ed effects of the administered therapeutic agents on the patient, and in view of the observed responses of the cancer to the administered therapeutic agents.<br><br>
The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician.<br>
The particular choice of antineoplastic agent will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgement of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol.<br>

The attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the patient as well as more definite signs such as relief of cancer-related symptoms (e.g., pain, cough {for lung cancer), and shortness of breath (for lung cancer)), inhibition of tumor grovirth, actual shrinkage of the tumor, or inhibition of metastasis. Size of the tumor can be measured by standard methods such as radiological studies, e.g., CAT or MRI scan, and successive measurements can be used to judge whether or not growth of the tumor has been retarded or even reversed. Relief of disease-related symptoms such as pain, and improvement in overall condition can also be used to help Judge effectiveness of treatment.<br>

MICROTUBULE AFFECTING AGENTS<br>
As used herein, a microtubule affecting agent (e.g., paciitaxel, a paditaxel derivative or a paclitaxel-like compound) is a compound that interferes with cellular mitosis, i.e., having an anti-mitotic effect, by affecting microtubule formation and/or action. Such agents can t&gt;e, for instance, microtubule stabilizing agents or agents which disrupt microtubule formation.<br>
Microtubule affeding agents useful in the invention are well known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to allocolchicine (NSC 406042), Halichondrin B (NSC 609395), colchidne (NSC 757), colchidne derivatives (e.g., NSC 33410), dolastatin 10 (NSC 376128), maytansine (NSC 153858). rhizoxin (NSC 332598), paciitaxel (Taxol®, NSC 125973). paditaxel derivatives (e.g., Taxotere. NSC 608832), thiocolchlcine (NSC 361792). trityl cysteine (NSC 83265), vinblastine sulfate (NSC 49842), vincristine sulfate (NSC 67574), epothilone A, epothilone, and discodemiolide (see Service. (1996) Science, 274:2009) estramustine, nocodazole, MAP4. and the like. Examples of such agents are also described in the sdent/fic and patent literature, see. e.g., Bulinski (1997) J. Ceil Sd. 110:3055-3064; Panda (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:10560-10564; Muhlradt (1997) Cancer Res. 57:3344-3346; Nicolaou (1997) Nature 387:268-272; Vasquez (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:973-985; Panda (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271:29807-29812.<br>
Particulariy preferred agents are compounds with paditaxel-like activity. These indude, but are not limited to paditaxel and paciitaxel derfvaUves^paditaxel-like compounds) and analogues. Paditaxel and its derivatives (e.g. Taxol and Taxotere) are available commercially. In addition, methods of making paciitaxel and paditaxel derivatives and analogues are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos: 5,569,729; 5,565.478; 5,530,020; 5,527.924; 5,508,447; 5.489,589; 5,488.116; 5,484,809; 5,478,854; 5.478.736; 5,475.120; 5,468.769; 5,461.169; 5,440.057: 5.422.364; 5.411.984; 5.405,972; and 5,296,506).<br>
More specifically, the term "paditaxel" as used herein refers to the drug commercially available as Taxol® (NSC number 125973). Taxol® Inhibits eukaryotic<br><br>
cell replication by enhancing polymerization of tubulin moieties into stabilized microtubule bundles that are unable to reorganize into the proper stnjctures for mitosis. Of the many available chemotherapeulic doigs, paditaxel has generated interest because of its efficacy in clinical trials against drug-refractory tumors, including ovarian and mammary gland tumors (Havv"kins (1992) Oncology, 6:17-23, Honwitz (1992) Trends Pharmacol. Sd. 13: 134-146, Rowinsky (1990) J. Natl. Cane. Inst. 62:1247-1259).<br>
Additional micnDtubule affecting agents can be assessed using one of many such assays known in the art, e.g., a semiautomated assay which measures the tubulin-polymerizing activity of paditaxel analogs in combination with a cellular assay to measure the potential of these compounds to block cells in mitosis (see Lopes (1997) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 41:37-47).<br>
Generally, activity of a test compound is determined by contacting a cell with that compound and determining whether or not the cell cycle is disaipted, in particular, through the inhibition of a mitotic event. Such inhibition may be mediated by disruption of the mitotic apparatus, e.g., disnjption of normal spindle formation. Cells in which mitosis is intenupfed may be characterized by altered morphology (e.g., microtubule compaction, increased chromosome number, etc.).<br>
Compounds with possible tubulin polymerization adivity can be screened in vitro. For example, the compounds are screened against cultured WR21 cells (derived from line 69-2 wap-ras mice) for inhibition of proliferation and/or for altered cellular morphology, in particular for microtubule compaction. In vivo screening of positive-testing compounds can then be performed using nude mice bearing the WR21 tumor cells. Detailed protocols for this screening method are described by Porter (1995) Lab. Anim.Sci.,45(2):145-150.<br>
Other methods of screening compounds for desired activity are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically such assays involve assays for inhibition of microtubule assembly and/or disassembly. Assays for microtubule assembly are described, for example, by Gaskin et al. (1974) J. Molec. Biol.. 89: 737-758. U.S. Patent No. 5,569,720 also provides in vitro and in vivo assays for compounds with paclitaxel-like activity.<br>
Methods for the safe and effective administration of the above-mentioned microtubule affecting agents are known to those skilled in the art. In addition, their<br><br>
administration is described in the standard literature. For example, the administration of many of the chemotherapeutic agents is described in the "Physicians" Desk Reference" (cited above).<br>
General Preparative Schemes<br>
The following processes may be employed to produce compounds of the invention.<br>
Pvridvl Tricyclic Compounds -One skilled in the art will appreciate that the compounds of the invention represented by Formula 1, wherein one of a, b. c or d is N or N*-0" can be prepared according to the following schemes:<br><br>
Scheme 1:<br><br>
The synthesis of 5-bromo tricyclic compound lb begins with bridgehead olefin la (J. Med Chem (1998). 41,1561-1567) which is treated with dibromo dimethylhydantoin in triflic acid media. Further treatment of the vinylbromide with potassium t-butoxide in the presence of the appropriate secondary amine gives the 5 and 6-substituted enamine adducts. Y^ represents -CH2-, -O- or -NH-. When Y^ is NH (prperazine case), acylations, sulfonylations and amide formation can be carried out using standard procedures. Treatment of these amine adducts with HCI(aq) at the apprcipriate temperatures results in the fomnation of the 5 and 6 azaketones, If and 1e respectively.<br><br><br><br>
Synthesis of 3-cartion spaced analogs can be prepared as outlined in Scheme 3. Thus, subjecting tricyclic vinyl bromide 1 b to a Heck type reaction using ethyl<br>
acrylate and catalyzed by Pd^ gives the a-p un-saturated ester 3a. Reduction of the conjugated double bond was carried out using copper chloride-sodium borohydride reducing reagent. The ester was further reduced to alcohol using lithium aluminum hydride. Treatment of the alcohol with methanesulfonyJ chloride in an appropriate aprotic solvent, followed by displacement with an appropriate sodium salt resulted in the desired imidazole targets. In most cases, separation of isomers were effected at this point. Where the R^ group of 3e was a BOC group, deprotection using HCI-dioxane gave the hydrochloride salts of amines. Using standard chemistry, these amines were converted to ureas, carbamates, sulfonamides and amides.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that when a metal hydride, such as NaH. is used in the conversion of 3d to 3e in Scheme 3, reduction of the C5-C6 double bond can take place. This is exemplified in Preparative Example 59 Step 8.<br><br>

Preparation of piperazine compounds off the bridgehead starts from mesylate aa which is reacted with CBZ-protected plperazine. The BOC group is then removed and the resulting amine 10c is functionalized appropriately. Removal of CBZ group off the piperazine is effected with TMSI.<br>
Mesylate aa is prepared by first carbonyiating compound H from Scheme 14 using P(i°, triphenyl phosphine, cariDon monoxide, DBU, in methanol to give the cartioethoxy product. The carfaoethoxy product is then reduced with lithium aluminum hydride to give the resulting alcohol.

Compound 12a is reduced with DIBAL In an inert solvent such as toluene or tetrahydrofuran to give 12b after acidic workup. Treatment of 12bjvlth an appropriately substituted and trityiated imidazole iodide in the presence of ethylmagnesium bromide in solvents such as dichloromethane at ambient temperature yields the adduct 12c. Elimination of the hydroxyl group by converting the hydroxy! group to an appropriate leaving group such as a mesylate, tosylate. or halide. using methanesulfonyt chloride, p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, orthionyl chloride, followed by elimination using an appropriate base such as triethylamine gives 12e.

Dibromo compound B is reacted with a base such as DBU in a solvent such as dichloromethane at temperatures from CC to room temperature to give vinylbromides C and D. These vinylbromides are separated by chromatography such as silica gel flash chromatography using solvents mixtures such as ethyl acetate and hexane. Alternatively, vinylbromides C and D can be separated by crystallization from solvents<br>
such as dichloromethane.<br>

The ketone groups of separated vinylbromides C and D are reduced to the con-esponding alcohols E and F with a reducing agent such as NaBH4 in solvents such as methanol or ethanol at temperatures of OX to room temperature.<br>
Br,	.Br<br><br><br>
The resulting alcohols functions of E and F are converted to a leaving group, such as a haltde. with reagents such as SOCIa in solvents such as dichloromethane ointaining a base such as 2.6-lutidine and running the reaction at 0°C to room temperature. The resulting intennediate halides are reacted, without purification, with<br><br>

The ester functions are of I and J are reduced to hydroxymethyl functions of K and L. This can be done directly by first removing the protecting BOC group with TFA or HCI-dioxane and then reducing with a reducing agent such as D(BAL-H, followed by reintroduction of the BOC group with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. Aitemativety, the ester function is hydrolyzed with LiOH and water followed by neutralization with citric acid. The resulting carboxylic acids are then converted into a function that is easily reduced, such as a mixed anhydride oran acyl imidazole. This is done by reacting the resulting carbocylic acids with a chlorofonnate to form the mixed anhydride or with carfaonydilmidazole to form the acyi imidazole (Synlett. (1995). 839). The resulting activated carboxylic acids are reduced with NaBH^ in solvents such as methanol, ethanoi or aqueous THF.<br><br><br><br><br>
The hydroxy functions of K and L are converted into leaving groups such as a methanesulfonate or an ar^sulfonate such as a tosylate. by reacting with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane containing a base such as triethylamrne. The sulfonate leaving groups can be displaced by nucleophtles such amines. The nucloephile (Nuc in structures O and P below) can also be basic heterocydes such as imidazole or a substituted imidazole. In the case of an imidazole, the anion of the imidazole is first formed with NaH in DMF and then reacted with the above sulfonate. Displacement of the sulfonates with a nucleophile gives O and P, which can be converted to the compounds of this invention 1.0, by first removing the BOC protecting group and then forming the desired amide, urea, carbamate or sulfonamide on the resulting amine by methods well known in the art.<br><br><br>

The FPT inhibitor of this invention (i.e., a compound of this invention, e.g., a compound of Formula (1.0)). the chemoiherapeulic agent, signal transduction inhibitor<br><br>
and/or radiation can be administered by different routes. For example, the FPT inhibitor can be administered orally, while the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered intravenously. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician .<br>
The particular choice of the chemotherapeutic agent, signal transduction inhibitor and/or radiation to use with the FPT inhibitor of this invention wili depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgement of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol.<br>
The FPT inhibitor of this invention (i.e.. a compound of this invention, e.g., a compound of Fonnula (1.0)). chemotherapeutic agent, signal transduction inhibitor and/or radiation may be administered concurrently (e.g., simuitaneously. just prior to or after, or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentiallyi. Determination of the sequence of administration can be determined by the skilled clinician. Some factors that the skilled clinician can use to determine the treatment protocol are the nature of the proliferative disease, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of chemotherapeutic agent, signal transduction inhibitor and/or radiation to be administered In conjunction (i.e., within a single treatment protocol) with the FPT inhibitor.<br>
If the FPT inhibitor of this invention (i.e., a compound of this invention, e.g., a compound of Fomiula {1.0)). chemotherapeutic agent, signal transduction inhibitor and/or radiation are not administered simultaneously then the FPT inhibitor may be administered first followed by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent, signal transduction inhibitor and/or radiation, or the chemotherapeutic-agent, signal transduction inhibitor and/or radiation can be administered first followed by the administration of the FPT inhibitor. This alternate administration may be repeated during a single treatment protocol until the treatment protocol is completed. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repititions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.<br><br>
Thus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practising physician can modify each protocol for the administration of a component (therapeutic agent-l.e., FPT inhibitor of this invention (i.e., a compound of this invention, e.g., a compound of Fom^ula (1.0)), chemotherapeutic agent, signal transduction inhibitor or radiation) of the treatment according to the individual patient"s needs, as the treatment proceeds.<br>
The attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the patient as well as more definite signs such as relief of disease-related symptoms, inhibition of tumor growth, actual shrinkage of the tumor, or inhibition of metastasis. Size of the tumor can be measured by standard methods such as radio-logical studies, e.g., CAT or MRI scan, and successive measure-ments can be used to judge whether or not growth of the tumor has been retarded or even reversed. Relief of disease-related symptoms such as pain, and improvement in overall condition can also be used to help judge effectiveness of treatment.<br>
