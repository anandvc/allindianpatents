				<td>Filed of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a poultry feed for use in the production of eggs with optimal concentration of minerals and vitamins More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved poultry feed for production of eggs with a capacity of restoration of mineral composition in mammals with diabetes, hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia and hyperinsulinemia The present invention also relates to a method for the manufacture of such unproved poultry feed The present invention particularly relates to an improved egg with a capacity of restoration of mineral composition in mammals with diabetes, hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia and hyperinsulinemia and a method for the production thereof The present invention also relates the use of minerals and vitamins in poultry eggs, through optimizing the composition of minerals and vitamins mixtures in poultry feed, to ameliorate their deficiencies in diabetics The modified egg contains appropriate concentrations of vitamins and minerals which on consuming helps to restore the depleted minerals almost close to their normal levels in the tissues and reduces the severity of hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and arterial hypertension of diabetic consumers Background of the invention<br>
In diabetics, the body tissues tend to lose their minerals and the severity of the disease increases with further deterioration of mineral homeostatic mechanism notably of copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese and chromium etc with passage of time Some of these minerals are the constituent of either cytosohc or intramitochondrial superoxide dismutases enzyme (SOD), catalases glutathione-s-transferases and glutathione reductases which disarm the free reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protect the cell components from peroxidation Their altered levels in the diabetics lead to the deficiency of either one or more metals resulting in a reduction of antioxidative defense system As a consequence of this, ROS generated get accumulated in the cells leading to the severity of the disease<br>
A number of dietary supplement formulations of vitamins and minerals combinations in the form of tablets/capsules have been developed for human consumption to restore the altered minerals and vitamins status in the body so as to prevent the complications in the disease occurring due to their deficiencies/excess<br>
However, the results of the available dietary supplements are not as satisfactory as are expected particularly in diabetics since they are in synthetic forms whose absorption rate is less than those of natural forms or either their binding legends get depleted during the course of the disease or they are not as complete as they are thought of<br>
The poultry eggs can be conveniently used as a material for introduction of vitamins and minerals to restore their composition in the body since they serve as the natural source of vitamins and minerals which exist in bound forms They are easy to absorb and the concentrations of vitamins and minerals in eggs can be manipulated by incorporating appropriate changes in the birds feed<br>
The prior art methods had considerable disadvantages One of the drawbacks of the conventional eggs for their use as source of vitamins and minerals is that they contain high cholesterol content (&gt;210 mg/50g egg) which is an accepted high risk factor of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and hypertension usually associated with NIDDM The eggs as such, therefore, cannot be used as a source of vitamins and minerals for such patients unless modified<br>
Appropriate modification in dietary feed has led to the development of the eggs which have lower cholesterol (106-160mg/50g egg), less saturated fats (0 8-1 2g) more of omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids (70-400mg), more of vitamin E (0 5-10mg), folate (10-150 mg) and iodine (1-120 meg) than the standard eggs reported in technical publication which include US Patent No, 4128640, 4187294, 4197293, 4197294, 4394376, 4410541, 4739853, 4764531, 501276, 5091195, 5246717, 5415879, 5520938, 5520398, 5665375, 6316041 and 5759567 incorporated herein by reference<br>
No attempts have been made to modify the minerals in the feed of the birds (except copper and iodine as cholesterol lowering agents in eggs) for the production of eggs, which on consuming may rehabilitate the minerals status in diabetics Objects of the invention<br>

Detailed description<br>
Genetically obese (ob/ob) mice, diabetic (db/db) mice and Zuker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF/Drt) and transgenic rodents serve as models of research to understand the etiology of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases One of the important finding on these animals is that they absorb and retain greater amount of zinc in liver, adipose tissue and tnceps muscles than their lean control counter parts They have a greater potential of absorbing orally administered zinc from the lumen of gastrointestinal tract to blood plasma and can absorb 60% of more of glucose than those of their lean counter parts (Collip J A, Pediatrics Ann 13, 465-472, 1984, Begin - Heick, N, Daple - Scott J M, Rowe J and Heick M M Diabetes 34, 179-184,1985, Kennedy M L and Failla M L, J. Nutr 117, 886-893,1987, Lin W H, Chen M D and Lin P Y J. Formoson, Med. Assoc 91, 27-33, 1992]<br>
Supplementation of Zn promotes food intake, linear growth and body wt increase in children suffering from marginal to severe Zn-deficiency (Mc Gain C J, Kasarkis E J Jr Allen EJ, Prog. Food Nutr Sci. 9, 185-226, 1985) Investigatory studies on laboratory animals however provided evidences that anabolic effects of Zn result from elevated food consumption, higher absorption rate of nutrients l e amino acids (Moran J R and Lyerly A, Life Science 36 2551-2556 1985), fatty acids (Koo S I and Turk D E, J. Nutr 107 909-919, 1977) and glucose (Taneja S K and Arya P, Brit. J. Nutr 68 505-514, 1992) in addition to activation of protein and nucleic acids syntheses These anabolic effects of Zn are unlikely to dimmish after cessation of growth The continuous input of excess nutrients in tissues by excessive bioavailability of Zn after adolescence may create environment essential for obesity It has been reported that an increase of zinc to double the amount of recommended dietary allowance (RDA) increases the portion of the body fat during 25 weeks period of dietary treatment in healthy children (Prentice A, Nutr. Rev 51, 268-270, 1993) There exists a positive linear correlation between hair zinc and body wt in adult humans The obese of both the sexes possess higher zinc concentration in their hair than those with normal body wt/ for their height (Taneja SK, Mahajan M and Arya P Expenentia 52, 31-33,1996)<br>
A study on the relation of Zn absorption and deposition of fat in ob/ob mice and high fat diet induced ICR mice showed that the ICR mice fed a high fat diet containing Zn in greater amount resulted in significantly higher gain in body wt and more fat deposition identical to ob/ob mice than did their lean control counter parts fed on a diet containing high fat but low zinc [Chen M D , Lin P Y , Cheng L V and Lin W H Biol. Trace Elem. Res 52 125-132,1996]<br>
The proposed potential mechanism for development of obesity involving Zn based on the observations on the activation of ovine metallothionein - ovine growth hormone transgene (OMT - la - OG) by ZnSO4 is that it activates the genes of growth hormone during early period of growth and induces the relatively undifferentiated preadipacytes to be committed to become adipocytes This may increase their population The enhanced population of adipocytes responds by filling with tnacylglycerol due to increased absorption of nutrients caused by Zn and eventually leading to the observed state of obesity Alternately, the elevated growth hormone level may increase the insulin level which lead to increased glucose transport into adipocytes, thereby enabling them to increase hpogenesis Accordingly, the over supply of zinc during growth phase sets in the conditions for the onset of obesity [Pomp D, Oberbauer A M and Murray J D, Transgenic Res 5, 13-23,1996]<br>
However, the obese subjects possess either lower or normal plasma level of Zn compared to nonobese control (Chen M D , Lin P Y Sheu W W H, Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 60, 123-129, 1997) The lower plasma Zn level in obese individuals can return to normal following dietary therapy (Di-Martino G, Matera M G, Di-Martino B, Vacca C, Di-Martino S and Rossi F , J. Med. 24 177-183, 1993)<br>
In fact the plasma Zn status does not truly reflect the body Zn status as it tends to mamtain Zn homeostasis either by increasing Zn absorption or decreasmg Zn excretion depending upon Zn intake and metabolic requirements Therefore, no significant difference can exist between BMI and serum Zn in healthy subjects Tissue Zn status is thus more reliable to determine the relationship between the two It is evedent from a report that the hair Zn concentration increases with increase in BMI in Indian women (Taneja S K and Mahajan M, J. Punj. Acad. Sci., 1,211-216, 1999)<br>
Thus, there are strong reasons to believe that excessive bioavailability of Zn, either in food chain or due to genetic disorder, to the tissues results in obesity Obesity poses a formidable challenge to the growing population all over the world as it is etiologically linked to insulin resistance accompanying to non-insulin dependent diabetes melhtus, hypertension and coronary artery disease This classical clustering of disease is described as metabolic syndrome - X<br>
Insulin resistance seems to be an essential adaptation to prevent further weight gain in obese subjects (Eckel RH, Lancet 340, 1452-1453, 1992) and is developed through increased secretion of glucocorticoid from zona fasciculate of adrenal cortex Insulin resistance results in hyperglycemia, glucosuna, altered protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolisms and chronical complications resulting from macro and microvascular pathology Associated with it, altered metabolism of Cu, Zn, Mn and Mg are frequently seen in<br>
experimental animals and humans There have been numerous studies evaluating the mineral status of diabetic subjects These studies yield inconsistent results<br>
The most frequently reported features of diabetics in genetic diabetic animal model and humans are that they have higher Cu and Mg concentrations, low Zn concentration in their blood plasma and display high amount of Zn loss in urine The degree of increase in plasma Cu in diabetes melhtus is associated with its complications of hypertension or macrovascular disease The plasma magnesium level has been reported to be less when diabetes melhtus is associated with retinopathy (Walter R M Jr, Unu-Hare J Y, Olin K L, Oster M H, Anawalt B D , Cntch field J W and Keen C L, Diabetes Care 14 1050-1056, 1991)<br>
However, normocupremia, hypocupremia, or hyperzincemia, normozmcemia and hypozincemia have been reported in some studies The concentrations of metals in blood plasma at a given time represent a total of bound, exchangeable and catabolic components of metals They therefore, can lead to conflicting results and predictions, more so in case of chronic diseases where urinary losses are high The metals concentrations in tissues are more dependable indicators for assessing metal deficiencies since their concentrations are maintained through dynamic equilibrium between tissue metals and exchangeable metal components of the blood plasma Some investigators therefore, preferred other tissues such as liver, muscles, hair, nails etc The levels of zinc and copper in hepatic and renal tissues have frequently been seen either higher or comparable to normal in diabetic melhtus complicated with hypertension The Cu in hair and nails in diabetes melhtus, hypertension and coronary artery disease patients have been found to be low (Sukumar A and Subramamam R, Biol. Trace Elem. Res., 34 89-98, 1992, Taneja S K, Mahajan M, Gupta S and Singh K P , Biol. Trace Elem. Res., 62, 255-264,1998) Cu deficiency has been also reported in muscle biopsies of diabetics (Sjogren A, Edvinsson L , Floren C H and Abdulla M, Nutr. Res., 6, 147-154, 1986)<br>
It has been reported that the NIDDM and myocardial infarction susceptible individuals are more prone to obesity as they are genetically predisposed to excess Zn absorption at a younger age, which reduces Cu bioavailability to the tissues over a penod of time The manifestation of clinical symptoms depends upon the degree of ionic imbalance resulting from the degree of stress and the type of food the individual consumes during intervening period Higher stress and zinc rich food aggravate the condition and favour their early onset compared with low stress or low zinc intake in food Because fibers and phytates are known to reduce zinc bioavailability their liberal use delay the onset of obesity and obesity related diseases    (Taneja S K, Mahajan M  Gupta S and Singh K P  Biol Trace<br>
Elem. Res  62, 255-264, 1998, Taneja SK Girhotra S and Singh KP, Biol Trace Elem. Res 75, 177-186,2000)<br>
The reported variations may represent the trace elements concentration in diet, the pattern of progression of disease and degree of depletion of respective mineral binding legends due to excessive loss of albumin protein, increased rate of proteolysis and lipolysis<br>
The mechanistic functional consequences of mineral deficiencies have been discussed differently by different investigators to explain the etiology of diabetes mellitus<br>
Since Zn deficiency adversely affects the glucose disposal as it provides stimulating effect of glucose transfer in muscles and adipocytes, the therapeutics benefit of Zn supplementation has been reported in subjects with diabetes mellitus and obesity which both have insulin resistance (Brun J, Guintrand - Hugret R, Fons C , Carvajal J , Fedou C, Fusselher M, Bradet L and Orsetti A, Biol. Trace Elem. Res., 47 385-391, 1995) However, the reality of zinc deficiency in diabetes mellitus has been criticized, as its supplementation further mcreases serum Hb Aic values in diabetes mellitus (Cunningham J J, Fu A, Mearkle P L and Brown R G, Metabolism, 43  1558-1562, 1994)<br>
The tissue copper deficiency aggravates hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia and reduction in the activity of cytosolic superoxide dismutase resulting in alteration of antioxidant defence system The reduction in sehnogleutathione peroxidase (Se-GSHPX) activity and increased synthesis of cholesterol promotes lipoprotein oxidation under copper deficiency in particular These effects are important given the etiological role of oxidised low density lipoprotein in initiation of atherosclerosis [Kathenne L O Robert M W and Carl L K Am. J. Clin. Nutr 59, 654-658, 1997 Singal P K, Kharpar N Palace V and Kumar D , Cardiovascular Res 40, 426-432, 1998]<br>
Copper deficiency during pregnancy affects the cross linking of connective tissue protein causing abnormal growth and maturation of the foetus [Barone A Ebesh, O Harper R G and Wapmr RA J. Nutr 128   1037-1041, 1998]<br>
The reduction of Mg (Mg ATP 2") occurs due to the presence of Mg binding defect (Mg BD) and accounts for all aspects of type - II diabetes It therefore, has a conservative role in the development of the disease (Ibert C W , Devendra K and J A, Biol. Trace. Elem. Res 98, 97-107, 2004] And most of the complications of type-II diabetes such as arrhythmias, hypertension and sudden cardiac death may be prevented by prophylactic magnesium supplementation (Balon T W, Gu J J, Tokuyama Y , Jasman A P and Nadler J J Am. J. Physiol. 269, 745-752, 1995)<br>
Manganese  is   a  constituent  of mitochondrial  Mn-superoxide  dismutase   Its deficiency results in the generation of free radical of oxygen (ROS) leadmg to the oxidative<br>
stress and supplements to adverse effect of the zinc and copper deficiency leading to the depletion of cellular antioxidants and increased production of peroxidation products which accelerate the complications in diabetics (Cederberg J Galh J Luthman H and Enkson U J Diabetes 49, 101-107, 2000, Cedarberg J, Martin S  and Eriksson UJ, Pediat. Res., 49, 755-762, 2001)<br>
These finds have led to the development of dietary supplements containing minerals and antioxidative vitamins in the form of capsules/tablets to relieve the diabetics from the oxidative stress by ameliorating the relevant minerals deficiency and increasing the cellular antioxidants such as vitamins E, A and C and other vitamins related to general metabolism including Bl, B2, B6, B12, etc However, the results of the available dietary supplements are not as satisfactory as expected particularly in diabetics, since they are in synthetic forms whose absorption rate is less than those of natural forms or their binding legends get depleted during the course of the disease or they are not as complete as they are thought of<br>
The poultry eggs can be conveniently used as a material for introduction of vitamins and minerals to restore their composition in the body since they serve as the natural source of vitamins and minerals which exist in bound forms They are easy to absorb and the concentrations of vitamins and minerals in eggs can be manipulated by incorporating appropriate changes in the birds feed<br>
The draw back of the conventional eggs for their use as source of vitamins and minerals is that they contain high cholesterol content (&gt;210 mg/50g egg) which is an accepted high risk factor of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and hypertension The eggs as such, therefore, cannot be used as a source of vitamins and minerals for such patients unless modified<br>
The modified egg accomplishes by the provision of having low cholesterol, appropriate minerals and vitamins composition to act as their natural source which exist in bound form They are easy to absorb and have the minerals and vitamins composition sufficient enough capable to rehabilitate their status in diabetics and decrease the severity of the disease<br>
A modified egg of the present invention typically has between about 2 5-4mg of copper, 0 5-2 5 mg of zinc, 0 8-4 5 mg of magnesium 50-100 mg of iodine per 50g of liquid<br>
egg<br>
A present invention modified egg has about 10-12mg of vitamin E and about 0 3-0 75 mg of edible carotenoids as antioxidants<br>

Data in tables VII and VIII show that the mineral concentrations of Zn, Cu and Mg<br>
are significantly higher in serum of the group - II and III rats, whereas Zn concentration<br>
remains higher but those of Cu and Mg reduce drastically in other tissues such as liver, hair<br>
and abdominal muscles with their excessive loss in urine in spite of their adequate levels in<br>
their diets The altered mineral status in rats of groups - II and in is consistent with those of<br>
genetic diabetes mice/rats and human diabetic patients where an excessive loss of these<br>
minerals have been seen m urine leading to their deficiencies in the tissues<br>

The data in table IX show reduction in total lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides and glycogen on Db diet -1 and Db diet - II rats which coincide well with their rise in the blood<br>
The data of body wt, blood pressure, blood serum profile and mineral status of rats in group-II and III clearly demonstrate that the diet containing higher Zn (even in pharmacological doses) when fed to rats for a longer duration induces diabetes in them, consistent with those of genetically db/db mice, Zukar diabetic fatty rats (ZDF/Drt) and in some of human diabetic patients The severity of the disease depends upon the amount of Zn m diet and degree of deficiencies of minerals in the tissues Even if the diet contains adequate levels of minerals and vitamins, they are not able to prevent the occurrence of these deficiencies in the tissues when Zn is excess in diet<br>
Example III<br>
This example illustrates that on feeding four fresh modified eggs mixed in diet to diabetic rats improve the metal status in tissues and reduce the severity of diabetes in them<br>
For this, two groups of rats are included in this study These groups are made out of the normal 21 days old (just after weaning period) males and females from a stock bred on the standard rat pellet diet They are fed on Db diet - I (group-II) and Db diet - II (group-Ill) respectively for a period of 120 days Their body wt blood pressure and urine glucose are<br>
monitored to check the onset of diabetes which are seen to manifest on 90th day in group-II<br>
and on 60   day in group-Hi fed diet groups similar to group II and III rats<br>
On the beginning 120th day, the animals of the group -II and III were shifted on the<br>

modified eggs/kg of semi synthetic   diet respectively and continue to feed them on their<br>
respective diets for the period of 60 days prior to the termination of the experiment that lasted<br>
for 180 days Their body wt and blood pressure are monitored (Table X)<br>

It is evident from the data per se that the inclusion of these modified eggs in diet of diabetics helps to restore the altered mineral composition of blood and tissues and   reduce the severity of diabetes and protects them against diabetic induced complications if the individuals are feeding on  diabetogenic diet Example IV<br>
This example illustrates that these modified eggs protect the embryos in womb, help to deliver normal neonates by preventing malformations in them due to diabetes complicated with hypertension and help towards the restoration of mineral composition in the body of the young ones<br>
For this study, three groups of rats are prepared from 21 days old pups just after their<br>
weaning period The males and females rats are separated from the main stock and divided<br>
into 3 groups Group-I is fed on the semi synthetic basal diet (Control) Group-II on Db diet<br>
-I and  group-Ill  on Db diet -II for  a period of two  months   At this stage animals in<br>
group II and III are subdivided into two groups each One subgroup of group II is continued<br>
to feed on Db diet - I and the other on four fresh modified egg mixed Db diet - I/kg diet<br>
(Group - II*) Like wise one subgroup of group - III is continued to feed on Db diet -II<br>
(Group -III) and the other on four fresh modified egg mixed Db diet - II/kg diet (Group -<br>
III*) for a period of two months   After a total of 4 months dietary treatment, the males<br>
and females  in  each    group are mated within the  group and  continue to feed on their<br>
respective diet during their gestation and suckling periods The body wt and health of the<br>
neonates are recorded during their weaning period The result are summarized in tables XVI,<br>

*Egg mixed Db diet-I and II was given for 60 days to male and female rat parents after 60 days of dietary<br>
treatment of Db diet-I and II respectively<br>
The Fl generation obtained after mating shows that the neonates of group -II and group-III have higher birth wt than those of their control, have malformed toes of the forehmb (curled toes), show restricted unbalanced body movements, gain lesser body wt during weaning period They are diabetic when their urine is tested on 10th and 19 day of weaning period by Benedicts test They possess extremely low concentration of Cu, Zn and Mg in their tissues and die after the completion of the weaning period (Table XVIII)<br>
The neonates of group-II* and III* whose parents are fed on egg mixed Db diet- I and egg mixed Db diet -II also have higher body wt than those of control, gain more wt than group -II, and III during weaning period They remain healthy on completion of their weaning period But they are diabetic There is a partial rehabilitation of Cu, Zn and Mg concentrations in their tissues (Table XVIII) as their concentration are significantly higher than the groups II and III but still lower than the control group of rats<br>
The data of this set up experiment illustrate that the diabetes induced by this method in parents is genetically transmitted to the off spring of F1 generation and off springs die after weaning period due to malformations attributed by uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension But the inclusion of these modified eggs in diet of the dams protects the embryos in womb, allow them to deliver normal neonates and help towards restoration of minerals composition in their body Example V<br>
This example illustrates that the modified eggs provide protection against diabetes not only to those feeding on diabetogenic food but also against genetically transmitted diabetes<br>
For this study, the survived neonates of F1 generation of group -IE* are used After<br>
the weaning period of pups in group - IIP, they are subdivided into two subgroups One<br>
subgroup of group - IIP is fed on standard rat pellet diet (Group-EP*) and other on egg<br>
mixed standard rat pellet diet (Group IE***) for a period of 60 days Their body wt and<br>
