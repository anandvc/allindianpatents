				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds and formulations for oral delivery of<br>
peptides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventional means for delivering active agents are often severely limited by '<br>
biological, chemical, and physical barriers. Typically, these barriers are imposed by the<br>
environment through which delivery occurs, the environment of the target for delivery, or<br>
the target itself. Biologically or chemically active agents are particularly vulnerable to<br>
such barriers. In the delivery to animals of biologically active or chemically active<br>
pharmacological and therapeutic agents, physical and chemical barriers are imposed by<br>
the body. Examples of physical barriers are the skin and various organ membranes that<br>
must be traversed before reaching a target, and examples of chemical barriers include, but<br>
are not limited to, variations in pH, lipid bilayers, and degrading enzymes.<br>
These barriers are of particular significance in the design of oral delivery systems.<br>
Oral delivery of many biologically or chemically active agents would be the route of<br>
choice for administration to animals if not for biological, chemical, and physical barriers<br>
such as varying pH in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, powerful digestive enzymes, and<br>
active agent impermeable gastrointestinal membranes. Among the numerous agents<br>
which are not typically amenable to oral administration are biologically or chemically<br>
active peptides, such as calcitonin and insulin; polysaccharides, and in particular<br>
mucopolysaccharides including, but not limited to, heparin; heparinoids; antibiotics; and<br>
other organic substances. These agents are rapidly rendered ineffective or are destroyed<br>
in the gastrointestinal tract by acid hydrolysis, enzymes, or the like.<br>
Earlier methods for orally administering vulnerable pharmacological agents have<br>
relied on the co-administration of excipients or enhancers (e.g., resorcinols and non-ionic<br>
surfactants such as polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecylpolyethylene ether) to<br>
increase artificially the permeability of the intestinal walls, as well as the co-<br>
administration of enzyme inhibitors (e.g., pancreatic trypsin inhibitors,"<br>
diisopropylfluorophosphate) to inhibit enzymatic degradation.<br><br>
Liposomes have also been described as drug delivery systems for insulin and<br>
heparin. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,754; Patel et al (1976), FEBS Letters, Vol<br>
62, pg. 60, and Hashimoto et al. (1970), Endocrinology Japan, Vol, 26, pg. 337.<br>
However, broad spectrum use of such drug delivery systems is precluded because:<br>
(1) the systems require toxic amounts of excipients, enhancers or inhibitors; (2) suitable<br>
low molecular weight cargos, i.e. active agents, are not available; (3) they exhibit poor<br>
stability and inadequate shelf life; (4) the systems are difficult to manufacture; (5) the<br>
systems fail to protect the active agent (cargo); (6) the systems adversely alter the active<br>
agent; or (7) the systems fail to allow or promote absorption of the active agent.<br>
More recently, microspheres of artificial polymers of mixed amino acids<br>
(proteinoids) have been used to deliver pharmaceuticals. For example, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,925,673 describes drug-containing proteinoid microsphere carriers as well as methods<br>
for their preparation and use. These proteinoid microspheres are useful for the delivery of<br>
a number of active agents.<br>
Delivery agent molecules have also been disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,541,155;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference hereafter to "a compound of formula I" or "compound of formula II"<br>
includes the pharmaceutical salts thereof.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, as disclosed and claimed herein, the<br>
following terms are defined below.<br>
The term "halo" refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. The term "C1-C6 alkyl"<br>
represents a straight, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon moiety having from one to six<br>
carbon atoms, e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-<br>
butyl, t-butyl, cyclobutyl, pentyl, cyclopentyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl and the like. Moieties<br>
such as a cyclobutylmethylene are also included within the scope of a C1-C6 alkyl group.<br><br>
The term "C1-C4 alkyl" refers specifically to methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl,<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclopropylmethyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl and cyclobutyl. A<br>
"C1-C6 alkoxy" group is a C1-C6 alkyl moiety connected through an oxy linkage.<br>
The term "pharmaceutical" when used herein as an adjective means substantially<br>
non-deleterious to the recipient patient.<br>
The term "patient" includes humans and non-human animals such as companion<br>
animals (dogs, cats, horses and the like). The preferred patient of treatment is a human.<br>
The term "GLP-1 compound" as used herein refers to one or more naturally<br>
occurring GLP-1 polypeptides (GLP-1 (7-37)OH and GLP-1 (7-36)NH2), GLP-1<br>
fragments, GLP-1 analogs, GLP-1 derivatives of naturally occurring GLP-1 polypeptides,<br>
GLP-1 fragments, or GLP-1 analogs, and Exendin-3 and Exendin-4 that have the ability to<br>
bind to the GLP-1 receptor and initiate a signal transduction pathway resulting in<br>
insulinotropic activity as described in PCT Publication Number WO 03/072195<br>
(Application Number PCT/US03/03111); herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The term "MC4 agonist peptide" as used herein refers to the pharmaceutically<br>
useful peptides disclosed in PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US04/16625, filed June 17,<br>
2004 (peptides of formula I, II and III as disclosed therein).<br>
The compound of formula II is useful for increasing the oral bioavailability of an<br>
active agent, i.e., a GLP-1 compound or an MC4 agonist peptide, when said compound is<br>
mixed with the active agent to form a combination composition. Said combination is one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The compositions of the present invention<br>
comprise a compound of formula II, that is, a delivery agent (a formula II compound),<br>
and a GLP-1 compound or an MC4 agonist peptide.<br>
The present invention is particularly advantageous for delivering a GLP-1<br>
compound or an MC4 agonist peptide (active agent) that would otherwise be destroyed or<br>
rendered less effective by conditions encountered before the active agent reaches its target<br>
zone (i.e. the area in which the active agent of the delivery composition is to be released)<br>
and within the body of the animal to which it is administered. The compositions<br>
comprising one or more compounds of formula II (preferably and most typically one) and<br>
an active agent have utility in the delivery of said active agent to selected biological<br>
systems and in an increased or improved bioavailability of the active agent compared to<br><br>
administration of the active agent without the delivery agent. Delivery can be improved<br>
by delivering more active agent over a period of time, or in delivering active agent in a<br>
particular time period (such as to effect quicker or delayed delivery) or over a period of<br>
time (such as sustained delivery).<br>

All non-aqueous reactions are performed under a dry atmosphere of nitrogen<br>
unless otherwise specified. Commercial grade reagents and anhydrous solvents are used<br>
as received from vendors and no attempts are made to purify or dry these components<br>
further. Removal of solvents under reduced pressure is accomplished with a Buchi rotary<br>
evaporator at approximately 28 mm Hg pressure using a Teflon-lined KNF vacuum<br>
pump. Thin layer chromatography is performed using 1" x 3" Analtech No. 02521,<br>
Whatman No. MK6F or EM Science (Merck) No. 5719-2 silica gel plates with<br>
fluorescent indicator. Visualization of TLC plates is made by observation with either<br>
short wave UV light, 10% phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol or in iodine vapors. Flash<br>
column chromatography is carried out using Kieselgel silica gel 60. Proton NMR spectra<br>
are obtained on a Bruker AC 300 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer and<br>
are reported in ppm δ values, using tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. Melting<br>
points are obtained using an Electrothermal melting point apparatus and are uncorrected.<br>
CI Mass spectroscopic analyses are performed on a Shimadzu QP-5000 GC/Mass<br>
Spectrometer (methane) by direct injection. API Mass spectroscopic analyses are<br>
performed on a Finnegan LCQ Duo Ion Trap or a PESciex API 150EX mass<br>
spectrometer, using electro spray ionization (ESI) or atmospheric pressure chemical<br>
ionization (AFCI). HPLC analyses are conducted using a Waters Symmetry CI8, 5um,<br>

Formulation<br>
Because the compound of formula II may contain a basic and/or acidic moiety<br>
(i.e., amino and/or carboxylic acid), said compound may be formulated as a<br>
pharmaceutical salt, e.g., as the sodium or hydrochloride salt or as a salt described in<br>
"Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use", Weinheim, New<br>
York: VHCA; Wiley-VCH, 2002. The compound of formula II is preferably formulated<br>
in a dosage unit form, i.e., in an individual delivery vehicle, for example, a tablet or<br>
capsule, prior to administration to the recipient patient. Therefore, yet another<br>
embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
compound of formula II, or a pharmaceutical salt thereof, an active agent, and a<br>
pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
The present pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by known procedures<br>
using well-known and readily available ingredients. In making the formulations of the<br>
present invention, the delivery agent (formula II compound) will be mixed with an active<br>
agent and will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a<br>
carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the<br><br>
carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semisolid or liquid material which acts as a<br>
vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient.<br>
Biological Assays<br>
Delivery Agent Formulation Development<br>
For oral dosing of a GLP-1 compound, a pH range of 7.4 to 8.4 for each<br>
formulation is typically employed, whereas for a MC4 agonist peptide, a pH range of 6.8-<br>
7.2 (most typically 7.0) for the formulation of is typically utilized. A target delivery<br>
agent concentration of 150 mg/mL in both cases is also typical. Initial feasibility studies<br>
are conducted to determine final carrier formulations.<br>
Briefly, 200 mg of delivery agent is weighed into a Type I glass vial, to which 1<br>
mL of MilliQ water is added. Each mixture is visually inspected for solubility, followed<br>
by addition of NaOH to increase solubility or HC1 to decrease the pH to the oral dose<br>
range. Formulations are then diluted to 150 mg/mL with MilliQ water. Using this<br>
approach, the formulations generally fell into three categories: aqueous soluble, nearly<br>
completely soluble (e.g., few undissolved particles remaining, very fine aqueous<br>
suspensions or hazy suspensions), and aqueous insoluble (e.g., heavy suspensions).<br>
Delivery agents that exhibited aqueous insolubility are formulated in 4% w/v (aqueous)<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose (Klucel® LF, Hercules, Wilmington, DE) as needed. In these<br>
cases, between 50 and 100 mg of agent is suspended in Klucel® LF in a Type I glass vial,<br>
to yield a concentration of 200 mg/mL. For heavy aqueous and Klucel® LF suspensions,<br>
the preparations are cooled on ice for 3 minutes, followed by probe sonication on ice for<br>
30 minutes using a Misonix Sonicator ® Ultrasonic Processor XL (3/16th inch microtip)<br>
to reduce particle size. Following pH adjustment with NaOH or HC1, the formulations<br>
are then diluted to 150 mg/mL with MilliQ water or Klucel® LF.<br>
Formulation of Stock Active Agent Solution<br>
The GLP-1 compounds (.e.g., Val8-Glu22-GLP-l(7-37)OH and Val8-Glu22-l33-<br>
GLP-l(7-37)OH) and MC4 agonist peptides (e.g., Ac-Arg-cyclo[Cys-Glu-His-D-Phe-<br>
Arg-Trp-Cys]-NH2; Ac-cyclo[hCys-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Cys]-NH2; Ac-cycIo[hCys-His-<br><br>
D-Phe-Arg-Trp-penicillamine]-NH2; and N-cyclohexanecarbonyl-cyclo[hCys-His-<br>
D-Phe-Arg-Trp-penicillamine]-NH2) used herein are described in PCT Publication<br>
Number WO 03/072195 and PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US04/16625, filed June<br>
17, respectively.<br>
A stock solution of GLP-1 compound active agent is prepared as follows. Briefly,<br>
a known quantity of lyophilized active agent is weighed into a Type 1 glass vial. MilliQ<br>
water is then added to yield an initial concentration of about 7-10 mg/mL. Complete<br>
solubility of the peptide is achieved by slowly raising the pH of the medium to 10.5 with<br>
1 N NaOH and 5 N NaOH, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br>
A volume of 1 M Tris buffer, pH 8.0 is added to give a final buffer concentration of 20<br>
mM Tris, and the pH adjusted to pH 7.8 with IN HC1 and 5 N HC1. The solution is then<br>
filtered through a low protein binding 0.22 u.M syringe filter (Millex GV, Millipore).<br>
The concentration of the peptide filtrate is determined by UV spectroscopy (X max = 280<br>
nm). The solution is then diluted to a stock concentration of about 5.0 mg/mL using 20<br>
mM Tris buffer, pH 7.8. The active agent solution is stored in 1.0 mL aliquots at -70°C<br>
until used.<br>
A stock solution of MC4R agonist peptide is prepared as follows. Briefly, a<br>
known quantity of lyophilized MC4R agonist peptide is weighed into a Type I glass vial.<br>
MilliQ water is then added to yield an initial concentration of about 19-21 mg/mL. The<br>
pH is raised to 6.0 with 1 N NaOH and 5 N NaOH, followed by incubation at room<br>
temperature for 30 minutes. The concentration of the peptide solution is determined by<br>
UV spectroscopy ( max = 280 nm; light scatter correction applied between 250 nm and<br>
410 nm). The solution is then stored as a stock, concentration of about 20.0 mg/mL. The<br>
peptide solution is stored, refrigerated 4-8 °C until used.<br>
Rat Oral Delivery Method<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley (femoral artery cannulated, Charles River, Wilmington,<br>
MA) rats weighing 250-300 g are used in these studies. Animals are housed in single<br>
house stainless steel cages and cared for according to Eli Lilly and Company Animal Care<br>
and Use Policies &amp; Procedures. Animals are lasted for at least 12 hours (with free access<br>
to water) before dose administration. Each experiment (delivery agent + active agent) is<br><br>
conducted in a group of four rats. Final formulations for each delivery agent are freshly<br>
prepared approximately 5-10 minutes prior to in vivo dosing.<br>
Specifically, delivery agent formulation (~165 mg/mL stock) and GLP-1<br>
compound active agent solution (~ 5.0 mg/mL stock) are added together to yield an<br>
admixture of delivery agent + active agent. The final concentrations in each such<br>
formulation are 150 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively. Formulations are dosed by oral<br>
gavage (PO) for a final dose of 300 mg/kg delivery agent and 1.0 mg/kg active agent.<br>
One mL of blood samples is collected in EDTA tubes from the systemic (femoral artery)<br>
cannula from each animal (one sample/time point) at 5, 10, and 20 minutes. Tubes are<br>
chilled on ice immediately following collection and centrifuged at approximately<br>
5°C/3,000 rpm/15 minutes. Plasma is removed, transferred into 12 x 75 mm<br>
polypropylene sample tubes with snap caps, and stored immediately at -70°C until<br>
analyzed by a radioimmunoassay.<br>
In the case of an MC4 agonist peptide active agent, delivery agent formulation<br>
(~165 mg/mL stock) and peptide solution (~ 20.0 mg/mL stock) are added together to<br>
yield an admixture of delivery agent + active agent. The final concentrations in each such<br>
formulation are 150 mg/mL and 5.0 mg/mL, respectively. Formulations are dosed by oral<br>
gavage (PO) for a final dose of 300 mg/kg delivery agent and 10.0 mg/kg active agent.<br>
0.40 mL of blood sample is collected in heparin tubes from the systemic (femoral artery)<br>
cannula from each animal (one sample/time point) at ,5, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes.<br>
Tubes are chilled on ice immediately following collection and centrifuged at<br>
approximately 5°C/3,000 rpm/15 minutes. Plasma is removed, transferred into 96 well<br>
plates and stored immediately at -70C until analyzed by a LC/MS/MS.<br>
Radioimmunoassay and Pharmacokinetic analysis<br>
Concentrations of immunoreactive active agent in rat plasma are assayed by a<br>
radioimmunoassay assay that non-specifically detects native peptide and metabolic<br>
products. These concentrations are subsequently used to determine the reported<br>
pharmacokinetic parameters. Plasma samples are mixed with radiolabeled active agent<br>
and rabbit polyclonal antiserum and then incubated overnight at ~4°C. Bound and free<br>
forms of immunoreactive active agent are separated by precipitating the bound fraction by<br><br>
polyethylene glycol-assisted, secondary antibody precipitation. After collecting the<br>
bound fraction by centrifugation, the radioactivity is measured by a gamma counter. Data<br>
is analyzed by a weighted 4/5 parameter logistic algorithm. For GLP-1 compounds, the<br>
standard curve ranges from 9.8 pg/mL to 10000 pg/mL and the upper and lower<br>
quantification limits are 150 pg/mL and 4000 pg/mL, respectively. For MC4 agonist<br>
peptides, the standard curve ranges from 5.0 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL and the upper and<br>
lower quantification limits are 10 ng/mL and 5000 ng/mL, respectively. Pharmacokinetic<br>
analysis is performed using WinNonlin™ Version 3.0 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain<br>
View, CA). Plasma concentration time data are reported as mean ± standard deviation<br>
(SD). Delivery agent efficiency is defined as area under the plasma concentration-time<br>
curve measured from 0 to 20 min (AUC) of active agent in the presence of each delivery<br>
agent. Representative compounds of formula II (delivery agent) are tested with an active<br>
agent in the Rat Oral Delivery assay and the AUC of active agent in the presence of<br>
delivery agent is greater than the AUC of the active agent in the absence of the delivery<br>
agent.<br><br>
