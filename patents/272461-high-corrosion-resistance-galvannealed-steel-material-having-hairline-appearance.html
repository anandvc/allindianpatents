GORReSlON RESISTANCE GALVANNBALED STEEL MATERIAL<br>
HAVING HAIRLINE APPEARANCE"<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a high corrosion<br>
resistance galvannealed steel material having a hairline<br>
appearance used for interior materials or exterior<br>
materials of buildings, cars, etc., surface materials of<br>
electrical equipment, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As conventional steel materials having a hairline<br>
appearance, stainless steel materials are well known.<br>
That is, as a surface finish of stainless steel<br>
materials, a "hairline finish (HL finish)" is defined in<br>
JIS G 4305 and 4307. A "hairline finish", as defined by<br>
"a finish obtained by polishing by a polishing material<br>
of a suitable particle size to give a continuous polished<br>
grain", means a surface finish where the polished surface<br>
continues long like with hairs.<br>
FIG. 1 is a view showing an outline of a hairline<br>
finish. The ordinary hairline finish method, as shown in<br>
FIG. I, comprises rotating at a high speed an endless<br>
paper polishing belt 3 strung between a contact wheel 1<br>
and an idler roll 2 by rotating the contact wheel so as<br>
to polish the surface of a stainless steel material 6<br>
moving from an uncoiler 4 to a coiler 5 by the polishing<br>
belt (for example, see Japanese Patent Publication (A)<br>
No. 1-306162 and Japanese Patent Publication (B) No. 7-<br>
96183). A hairline finished stainless steel material has<br>
corrosion resistance and has a unique surface pattern, so<br>
is being widely used for interior materials or external<br>
materials of buildings where design is stressed, surface<br>
materials of electrical equipment, etc.<br>
However, stainless steel materials are expensive, so<br>
a new inexpensive steel material taking the place of<br>
stainless steel materials, that is, a steel material<br>
having a hairline appearance provided with a high<br>
corrosion resistance similar to a stainless steel<br>
material and suitable for use for building materials or<br>
electrical equipment, is desired.<br>
Therefore, the inventors took note of the<br>
inexpensive galvanized steel materials with their<br>
excellent corrosion resistance similar to stainless steel<br>
materials and studied how to give them a hairline finish.<br>
As conventional art for giving a plating layer a<br>
hairline finish, art has been proposed for solving the<br>
problem of the underlayer of the plating coated layer<br>
being exposed, the corrosion resistance becoming poor,<br>
and stable good quality materials not being able to be<br>
obtained if forming a plating coating layer on the<br>
surface of a thin, light-weight magnesium-based member<br>
and applying a hairline finish to try to form a hairline<br>
pattern on the surface of the plating coated layer.<br>
That is, there is the art of giving a hairline<br>
finish to the surface of an Mg-based part on which the<br>
dry plating method is used to form a plating coated layer<br>
(1) selected from Cu, a Cu alloy, Au, an Au alloy, Al, or<br>
an Al alloy and over said plating coated layer (1) the<br>
wet plating method is used to form a plating coated layer<br>
(2) selected from Cu, Ni, Au, Cr, Zn, Pa, Pt, Rh, Fe, Co,<br>
Sn, Cd, Ru, and their alloys (for example, see Japanese<br>
Patent Publication (A) No. 2000-219977). However, this<br>
art requires that two thick plating coated layers be<br>
provided. Further, the dry plating method and wet plating<br>
method have to be combined, so this art is difficult to<br>
apply as is to a galvanized steel material.<br>
Further, various inventions have been made regarding<br>
high corrosion resistance galvannealed steel sheets. For<br>
example, a Zn-Al-Mg-based alloy plated steel sheet plated<br>
using a plating bath comprised of, by mass%, Al: 3 to<br>
17%, Mg: 1 to 5%, and the balance of Zn and a plated<br>
steel sheet plated using a plating bath of this plus Ti<br>
and B (for example, see Japanese Patent Publication (A)<br>
No. 10-306357) or a Zn-Al-Mg-Si-based alloy plated steel<br>
sheet plated having a plating layer including, by mass%,<br>
Al: 5 to 81, Mq: I to 10%, Si: 0.01 to 2%, and, if<br>
needed, Fe: 1% or less or further Sn: 0.1 to 2% are known<br>
(for example, see Japanese Patent Publication (A) No.<br>
2001-355053).<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has as its object the<br>
provision of a high corrosion resistance galvannealed<br>
steel material having a hairline appearance which can be<br>
used similarly for the same applications as the<br>
applications of a stainless steel material having a<br>
hairline appearance.<br>
The inventors engaged in in-depth research on giving<br>
a hairline finish to a galvanized steel material, which<br>
is a material less expensive than a stainless steel<br>
material but having a similar corrosion resistance, as a<br>
material for taking the place of a stainless steel<br>
material having a hairline appearance. As a result, they<br>
found that if giving a pure galvanized steel material a<br>
hairline finish, since the zinc is soft, the hairlines<br>
formed are easily crushed and, further, the hairline<br>
finish polishing belt easily becomes clogged at the time<br>
of the processing work, so good hairlines could not be<br>
obtained and a hairline finish was difficult. Further,<br>
the hairline finished galvanized steel material had the<br>
problem of formation of white rust on the zinc surface in<br>
the atmosphere. If white rust formed, the hairline<br>
appearance ended up disappearing and the effect of<br>
formation of the hairlines ended up being lost.<br>
Therefore, in the present invention, the inventors<br>
took note of high corrosion resistance galvannealing<br>
process introducing a hard phase in the plating layer and<br>
discovered that if applying a hairline finish to this, a<br>
good high corrosion resistance galvanized steel material<br>
having a hairline appearance can be obtained and thereby<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Below, the present invention will be explained in<br>
detail.<br>
As steel materials having a hairline appearance,<br>
there are hairline finished stainless steel materials,<br>
but stainless steel materials are expensive. Therefore,<br>
the inventors focused on the galvanized/galvannealed<br>
plated steel materials providing a high corrosion<br>
resistance like that of stainless steel materials and<br>
studied giving galvanized/galvannealed steel materials a<br>
hairline finish.<br>
If giving a galvanized steel material a hairline<br>
finish, the ridges of the hairlines become deformed and<br>
the hairlines are crushed, so a good hairline appearance<br>
cannot be obtained. There are also parts where the base<br>
metal is exposed. Further, the problem arises of clogging<br>
of the hairline finishing polishing belt. Further, there<br>
is the problem that if leaving the material in the<br>
atmosphere after giving it the hairline finish, white<br>
rust is formed and the hairline appearance ends up being<br>
lost.<br>
A good hairline appearance cannot be obtained in<br>
this way probably due to the fact that the galvanized<br>
layer has a hardness of about 50 Hv, i.e., is soft.<br>
Therefore, the inventors focused on galvannealed layers<br>
including hard phases and found that if giving these a<br>
hairline finish, a good hairline appearance could be<br>
obtained. As galvannealed layers including hard phases,<br>
they learned that a galvannealed layer containing Al and<br>
Mg which contains Zn and Al binary eutectic and Zn, Al,<br>
and ZnMg alloy ternary eutectic hard layers is suitable.<br>
The plating layer should be one comprising, as<br>
ingredients, by mass%, Al: 1.0 to 60%, Mg: 0.1 to 10%,<br>
and the balance of Zn and unavoidable impurities, further<br>
selectively including, as needed, Si: 0.001 to 3.0% to<br>
improve the corrosion resistance and one or both of Ti:<br>
0.0001 to 0.1% and B: 0.0001 to 0.1% to improve the<br>
appearance.<br>
The reasons for limitation of the ingredients of the<br>
galvannealed layer will be explained next.<br>
Al forms a hard phase Zn/Al binary eutectic and<br>
Zn/Al/Zn2Mg ternary eutectic in the plating layer and acts<br>
to improve the corrosion resistance of the plating layer<br>
and suppress the formation of dross in the plating bath.<br>
If Al is less than 1.0%, the volume fraction of the<br>
binary eutectic and ternary eutectic forming the hard<br>
phase becomes insufficient, a good hairline appearance<br>
cannot be obtained by a hairline finish, and the plated<br>
steel material becomes inferior in corrosion resistance.<br>
On the other hand, if Al is over 60%, the plated surface<br>
is formed with whisker-shaped relief shapes, a plating<br>
layer with a uniform appearance cannot be obtained, the<br>
effect of improvement of the corrosion resistance becomes<br>
saturated, and simultaneously the sacrificial corrosion<br>
action on the base iron is lost so the corrosion<br>
resistance of flawed parts deteriorates. Therefore, the<br>
Al content was made 1.0 to 60%.<br>
Mg is an ingredient required for forming the ternary<br>
eutectic and has the effect of forming corrosion products<br>
on the plated surface to improve the corrosion resistance<br>
of the plated steel material. If Mg is less than 0.1%,<br>
the volume fraction of the ternary eutectic becomes<br>
insufficient, a good hairline appearance cannot be<br>
obtained by a hairline finish, and the corrosion products<br>
required for improving the corrosion resistance cannot be<br>
formed. On the other hand, if Mg exceeds 10%, the plating<br>
bath proceeds to oxidize due to contact with the air,<br>
black oxides (dross) are produced making treatment<br>
difficult, and the effect of improvement of the corrosion<br>
resistance becomes saturated. Therefore, the Mg content<br>
was made 0.1 to 10%.<br>
Si is added as needed to improve the corrosion<br>
resistance and improve the plating adhesion. If the<br>
amount; of addition is less than 0.001%, these effects are<br>
not obtained, while if over 3.0%, these effects become<br>
saturated and conversely the production of dross<br>
increases, so the amount of addition of Si was made 0.001<br>
to 3.0%.<br>
Ti is an ingredient added as needed for forming the<br>
nuclei for precipitation of the primary crystal Al phase,<br>
increasing the fineness of the structure, and improving<br>
the appearance. At least 0.0001% must be added. However,<br>
if adding over 0.1%, the solubility in the plating bath<br>
is exceeded, Ti-Al-based precipitates grow, the plating<br>
layer is formed with relief shapes on its surface, and<br>
the quality of the appearance deteriorates, so Ti was<br>
made 0.0001 to 0.1%.<br>
B, like Ti, has the effect of improving the plating<br>
appearance, but if less than 0.0001%, that effect cannot<br>
be obtained, while if over 0.1%, that effect becomes<br>
saturated, so B was made 0.0001 to 0.1%.<br>
With a plating deposition of less than 10 g/m2, the<br>
corrosion resistance becomes inferior, so this was made<br>
the lower limit, while with one of more than 600 g/m2, the<br>
uniformity of deposition of the plating layer<br>
deteriorates and a dripping appearance results, which is<br>
not preferred, and bending or the like easily results in<br>
cracks in the plating layer. Therefore, 600 g/m2 was made<br>
the upper limit.<br>
FIG. 2(a) is a micrograph of the structure of a Znbased<br>
alloy plating layer of the present invention, while<br>
FIG. 2(b) is a schematic view of the structure.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2(b), for example, the Zn-ll%Al-<br>
3%Mg-0.2%Si high corrosion resistance Zn-based alloy<br>
plating layer has, in its cross-sectional structure, a<br>
structure of a [Zn/Al/Zn2Mg] ternary eutectic phase 7 in<br>
which a [Zn/Al] binary eutectic phase 8 is mixed and in<br>
which a [Zii2Mg single phase] 9 is present in island<br>
shapes.<br>
This ternary eutectic phase is comprised of a<br>
structure of soft Zn and Al phases in which hard Zn2Mg is<br>
dispersed. The structure as a whole features both<br>
consistency and hardness. If giving a hairline finish to<br>
plated steel material in which this type of phase is also<br>
present at the surface, the plated surface is easily<br>
peeled off from the plated surface by the polishing belt,<br>
a beautiful hairline appearance is obtained without<br>
deformation of the ridges of the hairlines, the polishing<br>
belt does not become clogged, and a good hairline<br>
appearance is obtained.<br>
FIG. 3 is a micrograph of the cross-section of the<br>
surface of a hairline finished high corrosion resistance<br>
galvannealed steel material (Zn-ll%Al-3Mg-0.2Si plating,<br>
plating deposition: 90 g/m2) after #80 emery polishing<br>
(magnification: 1000X). As shown in FIG. 3, this has a<br>
good appearance with no deformation of the hairline<br>
grooves.<br>
To give a high corrosion resistance galvannealed<br>
steel material a hairline finish to obtain a good<br>
hairline appearance, the plating layer is preferably<br>
structured with a [Zn/Al] binary eutectic phase in a<br>
volume fraction of 1 to 80 vol%, a [Zn/Al/Zn2Mg] ternary<br>
eutectic phase in a volume fraction of 10 to 90 vol%, and<br>
the balance of Zn, Zn2Mg alloy, Mg2Si, TiAl3, etc. The<br>
[Zn/Al] binary eutectic phase is soft compared with the<br>
ternary eutectic phase, but is hard compared with the Zn<br>
and Al single phases. Therefore, the smaller the volume<br>
fraction, the more improved the hairline finishability.<br>
If over 90 vol%, the plating layer as a whole softens and<br>
the hairline finishability deteriorates. Making it less<br>
than 1 vol% is difficult engineering wise. If the volume<br>
fraction of the ternary eutectic becomes small, the<br>
hardness and consistency characteristics of the plating<br>
layer deteriorate, the appearance at the time of hairline<br>
finishing deteriorates, and the scraps easily clog the<br>
abrasive material. Therefore, the lower limit of the<br>
volume fraction of the ternary eutectic was made 10 vol%.<br>
On the other hand, the upper limit is determined by the<br>
ease of formation of the Al phase and Zn2Mg phase in the<br>
process of solidification of the plating layer. 90 vol%<br>
was the upper limit in engineering production. Further,<br>
if the volume fraction of the two eutectic phases<br>
combined falls, the overall plating layer falls in<br>
hardness and consistency and the hairline appearance<br>
becomes poor, so this fraction was made 50% or more.<br>
The thickness of the plating layer suitable for<br>
application of a hairline finish is, in terms of plating<br>
deposition, 10 to 600 g/m2, preferably 100 to 500 g/m2. If<br>
the plating deposition is less than 10 g/m2, since the<br>
plating layer is thin, the corrosion resistance is<br>
insufficient and the hairline finishing ends up exposing<br>
the underlying steel material. If the plating deposition<br>
is over 600 g/m2, the plating layer is too thick and a<br>
plating layer with a uniform appearance cannot be<br>
obtained. Further, the plating layer easily peels off.<br>
This is also disadvantageous cost wise. Therefore, the<br>
plating deposition was made 10 to 600 g/m2.<br>
As the shape of the superior appearance hairlines<br>
formed on the plated steel material, in the direction<br>
perpendicular to the hairlines (C-direction), the surface<br>
roughness should be a surface roughness Ra of 0.2 to 2.5<br>
HITI, preferably 1.2 to 1.8 ^m, and the peaks per inch PPI<br>
should be 50 to 400; in the hairline direction (Ldirection),<br>
the surface roughness should be Ra: 0.1 to<br>
1.2 [o,m, preferably 0.5 to 1.0 jam, and the peaks per inch<br>
PPI should be I to 100; the Ra in the direction<br>
perpendicular to the hairlines (C-direction) should be<br>
1.2 times or more the Ra in the hairline direction (Ldirection)<br>
(C-direction Ra/L-direction Ra&gt;1.2); and the<br>
PPI in the direction perpendicular to the hairlines (Cdirection)<br>
should be 2 times or more the PPI in the<br>
hairline direction (L-direction) (C-direction PPI/LdirectionPPI<br>
2) .<br>
If less than the limit limits of the C-direction and<br>
L-direction surface roughnesses Ra, peaks per inch PPI,<br>
and ratios prescribed here, the hairlines will no longer<br>
stand out and the hairline finish treatment will become<br>
wasted. Further, conversely, if more than the upper<br>
limits of the C-direction and L-direction surface<br>
roughnesses Ra and peaks per inch PPI, the hairlines will<br>
become too coarse, beautiful hairlines will not be<br>
obtained, the aesthetic design value of the hairlines<br>
will be lost, and the product will lose its value.<br>
Therefore, the present invention defines the shape<br>
of the hairlines as above by the surface roughnesses,<br>
peaks per .inch, and their ratios. Note that the surface<br>
roughness Ra was measured in accordance with the method<br>
of measurement prescribed in JIS B060 (1997) employing a<br>
reference length of 0.8 mm. Further, the peaks per inch<br>
PPI were measured in accordance with SAEJ911-1986 using a<br>
measured length of 1 inch and a width 2H between positive<br>
and negative reference levels of 50 |j.inch.<br>
To form hairlines satisfying the requirements of the<br>
surface roughnesses, peaks per inch, and their ratios<br>
prescribed in the present invention, use of a #60 to #320<br>
or so belt sander (polishing belt) for the hairline<br>
finish is preferable.<br>
After application of the hairline finish, the<br>
plating layer is preferably treated by chromate treatment<br>
or chromate-free treatment for primary rust proofing.<br>
A galvanized steel material is susceptible to white<br>
rust, so to prevent this, after the plating layer is<br>
given the hairline finish, it is treated by chromate<br>
treatment or chromate-free treatment to form a<br>
rustproofing coated layer for primary rust proofing.<br>
In the case of chromate treatment, a known chromate<br>
treatment, for example, chromate treatment by a chromate<br>
treatment solution containing chromic acid and a reaction<br>
accelerator as main ingredients can be applied. The<br>
amount of chromate deposition is made 1 to 200 mg/m2.<br>
If the amount of chromate deposition is less than 1<br>
mg/m"', a sufficient rust proofing effect cannot be<br>
obtained. Further, if over 200 mg/m2, not only does the<br>
hairline finish no longer stand out, but also the rust<br>
proofing effect will end up becoming saturated and,<br>
economically, the cost will rise.<br>
Further, it is also possible to perform primary rust<br>
proofing by a known chromate-free treatment (nonchromate<br>
treatment) in the same way as a chromate treatment.<br>
The cnromate-free treatment (nonchromate treatment)<br>
uses a treatment solution not containing any<br>
environmentally harmful hexavalent chrome in the<br>
solution. For example, there are treatment solutions<br>
containing Zr, Ti salts, treatment solutions containing<br>
silane coupling agents, etc. Known chromate-free<br>
treatment solutions may be used for chromate-free<br>
treatment. In such chromate-free treatment, a chromatefree<br>
treated layer containing Ti, Zr, P, Ce, Si, Al, Li,<br>
and other main ingredients and not containing chromic<br>
acid is formed. The amount of deposition is preferably 1<br>
to 1000 mg/m2.<br>
If the amount of deposition in the chromate-free<br>
treatment is less than 1 mg/m2, a sufficient rust<br>
preventing effect cannot be obtained. Further, if over<br>
1000 mg/m2, not only does the hairline finish no longer<br>
stand out, but also the rust preventing effect ends up<br>
becoming saturated and, economically, the cost rises.<br>
E'urther, if giving a galvanized steel material a<br>
hairline finish and then leaving it in the atmosphere,<br>
the plated surface will oxidize and blacken. If<br>
blackening, the hairline finish will no longer stand out<br>
and the hairline appearance will be lost. Further, the<br>
galvanized layer will be easily damaged upon collision<br>
with a hard object. For this reason, if forming a<br>
transparent resin coated layer to a thickness of 0.5 to<br>
100 |im on the hairline finished plated surface, the<br>
blackening resistance and the defect resistance can be<br>
improved. The transparent resin coated layer may be<br>
formed using a conventional known organic clear coating<br>
and a conventional known coating method. As such organic<br>
clear coatings, specifically an acryl-based baked clear<br>
coating, urethane-based clear coating, epoxy-based clear<br>
coating, polyester-based clear coating, melamine alkydbased<br>
clear coating, etc. may be mentioned. Among these,<br>
polyester-based and acryl-based baked clear coatings are<br>
preferably used.<br>
As the method of coating an organic clear coating,<br>
specifically the roll coater method, curtain coater<br>
method, spray can method, electrostatic method, etc. may<br>
be mentioned. Among these, the roll coater method and the<br>
curtain coater method are preferable.<br>
To impart blackening resistance, it is possible to<br>
give the vicinity of the interface with the chromate and<br>
chromate-free treated layer a layer of a deposit of one<br>
or more of Co, Fe, Ni, Pt, and Mn in a metal state or<br>
hydroxide state of 0.1 to 10 mg/m2. This deposited layer<br>
should have an amount of deposition of 0.1 to 10 mg/m2,<br>
preferably 0.5 to 3.0 mg/m2. This treatment greatly<br>
improves the blackening resistance in a wet environment.<br>
If the amount of deposition is less than 0.1 mg/m2, the<br>
effect of the blackening resistance is not sufficient,<br>
while if over 10 mg/m2, the corrosion resistance<br>
deteriorates, so these are not preferred. The method of<br>
imparting this treated layer is not particularly limited,<br>
but as examples there are the above salt water solution<br>
dipping method or spraying method, the vacuum deposition<br>
method, etc. In the dipping method, the hairline finished<br>
plated steel sheet is dipped in a 0.1 to 10 g/liter metal<br>
salt aqueous solution for 0.5 to 10 seconds, then rinsed.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Below, examples will be used to explain the present<br>
invention in detail.<br>
Low carbon steel sheets of two different types of<br>
thicknesses, that is, sheet thicknesses of 0.8 mm and 1.6<br>
mm, were used as the sheets for plating.<br>
The sheets were plated by heating, annealing, and<br>
plating by a continuous hot dip galvanization line of a<br>
non-oxidizing furnace type. The annealing atmosphere was<br>
made 10% hydrogen and the remaining 90% nitrogen gas. The<br>
dew point was made -30°C. The annealing temperature was<br>
made 730°C and the annealing time 3 minutes. The plating<br>
bath was comprised of, by mass%, Al: 11.0%, Mg: 3.0%, Si:<br>
0.2%, and the balance of Zn and unavoidable impurities,<br>
while the plating bath temperature was 450°C. The plating<br>
deposition was adjusted by the ordinary nitrogen gas<br>
wiping method.<br>
After the plating, different number belt sanders<br>
(size 100 mmx915 mm) were used to give hairline finishes<br>
under condations of a belt speed of about 3.5/seconds and<br>
a polishing time of 3 to 4 seconds. After this, the<br>
surface roughness (Ra) and peaks per inch (PPI) were<br>
investigated.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
As shown in Table 1, Nos. 1, 2, and 5 were the high<br>
corrosion resistance plated steel materials having a<br>
beautiful hairline appearance satisfying the surface<br>
roughnesses (Ra), peaks per inch (PPI), and their ratios<br>
prescribed in the present invention.<br>
As opposed to this, the #80 bead blasted No. 3 was<br>
formed with uniform fine relief over its surface, but the<br>
L-direction surface roughness and peaks per inch were<br>
small, the ratios of the surface roughness and peaks per<br>
inch were also small, and the requirements prescribed in<br>
the present invention were not satisfied. The bead<br>
blasting and hairline finish were clearly difficult.<br>
No. 4 was given a hairline finish, but the belt<br>
sander was a #600 type or too fine and therefore the<br>
requirements for hairlines prescribed in the present<br>
invention were not satisfied. Hairlines could not be<br>
clearly observed in the appearance.<br>
Further, No. 6 and No. 7 are cases with hairline<br>
finish given. In these cases, the C-direction surface<br>
roughness and peaks per inch were small and the ratios<br>
were also small. In these cases as well, naturally no<br>
hairlines were observed.<br>
From the above test results, only the plated steel<br>
sheets with hairline finishes satisfying the requirements<br>
prescribed in the present invention were plated steel<br>
sheets with beautiful hairline appearances.<br>
Next, the inventors prepared plated steel sheets<br>
with different compositions of plating layers then used a<br>
80 belt sander (size 100 mmx915 mm) to give them a<br>
hairline finish at a belt speed of about 3.5/second and a<br>
polishing time of 3 to 4 seconds. The inventors<br>
investigated the hairline appearance and state of<br>
deposition of scraps at that time.<br>
The results are shown in Table 2. Nos. 1 to 17 have<br>
the plating compositions prescribed in the present<br>
invention and were good in terms of hairline appearance,<br>
clogging of sanders by scraps, and corrosion resistance.<br>
On the other hand, Nos. 18 to 20 had platings outside the<br>
composition prescribed by the present invention. While<br>
they had values of surface roughness satisfying the<br>
values prescribed in the present invention, the hairline<br>
appearance could not be clearly observed and the sheets<br>
were poor in terms of scrap production and corrosion<br>
resistance. The reason, why the hairline appearance could<br>
not be clearly observed is believed to be because of the<br>
production of scraps and deformation of the polishing<br>
marks etc.<br>
Further, the inventors performed plating while<br>
changing the volume fractions of the eutectic phases in<br>
the plating layers and investigated the resultant<br>
performances. The results are shown in Table 3. Nos. I to<br>
5 had the phase structures prescribed in the present<br>
invention and were good in all of the hairline<br>
appearance, sander scrap clogging, and corrosion<br>
resistance. On the other hand, Nos. 6 and 7 had platings<br>
outside the phase structure prescribed by the present<br>
invention and were inferior in hairline appearance and<br>
poor in terms of production of scraps.<br>
Further, plated steel sheets having a composition of<br>
Zn-llAl-3Mg-0.2Si were used for chromate treatment,<br>
chromate-free treatment, clear coating treatment, and<br>
blackening resistance treatment. The chromate treatment<br>
comprised coating the sheet with a chromic acid 100<br>
g/liter solution, then drying it in a 60°C hot air furnace<br>
for 30 seconds. The chromate-free treatment comprised<br>
coating the sheet with a chemical comprised of zirconium<br>
aluminum carbonate, cobalt nitrate, silica, and ammonium<br>
phosphate, then drying in a 60°C hot air furnace for 30<br>
seconds. Further, sheets were coated with a melamine<br>
alkyd-based clear coating (solvent-based) and acryl-based<br>
clear coating (aqueous dispersion based) and heated until<br>
sheet temperatures of 220°C (melamine alkyd-based) and<br>
150°C (acryl-based). The blackening resistance treatment<br>
comprised dipping the sheet in a 1 g/liter Ni sulfate<br>
aqueous solution for 3 seconds, then rinsing and drying<br>
it, then treating it by the chromate-free treatment and<br>
coating it by a melamine alkyd-based clear coating. The<br>
corrosion resistance of the flat parts was evaluated by<br>
the amount of formation of white rust after 240 hours of<br>
a JIS Z2331 salt water spray test with "Good" indicating<br>
1% or less formation of white rust and "Poor" indicating<br>
10% or more. The cross-cut parts were evaluated by the<br>
blisters after 1000 hours of a salt water spray test with<br>
"Good" indicating less than 2 mm and "Poor" 2 mm or more.<br>
The blackening resistance was evaluated by allowing a<br>
treated steel material to stand in a high humidity tank<br>
of a temperature of 60°C and a relative humidity of 85%<br>
for seven days and comparing the color difference 8E<br>
values before and after. The color difference 8E was<br>
measured in accordance with JIS Z8722. A 6E of 1 or less<br>
indicated no blackening or a good result (Good), 1 to 2<br>
indicated slight observance or a fair result (Fair), and<br>
larger than 2 indicated blackening observed or a poor<br>
result (Poor).<br>
Nos. 1 to 46 satisfy the requirements of the<br>
blackening resistance treatment, pretreatment, and<br>
coating prescribed by the present invention and were<br>
excellent in corrosion resistance both at the flat parts<br>
and the cross-cut parts. Further, Nos. 23 and 46 treated<br>
for blackening resistance were also excellent in<br>
blackening resistance. On the other hand, Nos. 47 to 49<br>
were outside the requirements of the present invention<br>
and were poor in corrosion resistance.<br>
