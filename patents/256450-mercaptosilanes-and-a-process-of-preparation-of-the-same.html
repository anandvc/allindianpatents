				<td>Mercaptosilanes<br>
The invention relates to mercaptosilanes, a process for<br>
their preparation tend their use.<br>
It is known to employ silanes as adhesion promoters. Thus,<br>
aminoalkyltrialkoxysilanes,<br>
methacryloxyalkyltrialkoxysilanes,<br>
polysulfanalkyItrialkoxysilanes and<br>
mercaptoalkyltrialkoxysilanes are employed as adhesion<br>
promoters between inorganic materials and organic polymers,<br>
as crosslinking agents and as surface-modifying agents<br>
(E.P. Plueddemann, "Silane Coupling Agents", 2nd ed. Plenum<br>
Press 1982).<br>
These adhesion promoters or coupling or bonding agents form<br>
bonds both to the filler and to the elastomer and thus<br>
effect a good interaction between the filler surface and<br>
the elastomer.<br>
It is furthermore known that the use of commercially<br>
available silane adhesion promoters (DE 22 55 577) having<br>
three alkoxy substituents on the silicon atom leads to the<br>
release of considerable amounts of alcohol during and after<br>
the binding to the filler. Since as a rule trimethoxy- and<br>
triethoxy-substituted silanes are employed, the<br>
corresponding alcohols, methanol and ethanol, are released<br>
in considerable amounts.<br>
It is furthermore known from DE 10015,3,0 9. that the use of a<br>
mercaptosilane in combination with a long-chain alkylsilane<br>
leads rubber mixtures of increased amplification ratio<br>
and reduced hysteresis loss. The alkylsilane is necessary<br>
in order to ensure a reliable processability of the rubber<br>
mixture.<br>
It is furthermore known that methoxy- and ethoxy-<br>
substituted silanes are more reactive than the<br><br>
corresponding long-chain alkoxy-substituted silanes and can<br>
thus bind to the filler more rapidly, so that from the<br>
technical and economic aspect it has not hitherto been<br>
possible to dispense with the use of methoxy and ethoxy<br>
substituents.<br>
Silanes, such as are known from DE 10327624, which are<br>
substituted completely by long-chain alkoxy groups only<br>
show a balanced profile of rubber values if an adequate<br>
minimum mixing time is ensured.<br>
DE 10137809 discloses organosilicon compounds of the<br>
general formulae<br>
or <br>
wherein R is a methyl or ethyl group,<br>
R1 is identical or different and is a C9-C30 branched or<br>
unbranched monovalent alkyl or alkenyl group, aryl group,<br>
aralkyl group, branched or unbranched C2-C30 alkyl ether<br>
group, branched or unbranched C2-C30 alkyl polyether group,<br>
X is NH(3-s), O(C=O)-RIXI, SH, S, S(C=O)-RIII or H.<br>
JP 62-18134 6 discloses rubber mixtures which contain carbon<br>
black as a filler and comprise silanes of the formula HS-<br>
(CH2)3-Si-(OR1)n(OCH3)3-n.<br><br>
DE 10223658 discloses organosilicon compounds of the<br>
general formulae<br><br>
wherein RIV is identical or different and is a C9-C30<br>
branched or unbranched monovalent alkyl group,<br>
RIV is a mixture and the content of one component of the<br>
mixture is 10 to 50 mol%,<br>
which, without the addition of alkylsilanes, also lead to<br>
rubber mixtures having an increased amplification ratio and<br>
a reduced hysteresis loss, with at the same time an ensured<br>
processability of the rubber mixture.<br>
DE 3426987 discloses organosilicon compounds of the general<br>
formula<br><br>
where Y = -SH or NHRVIII, Rv = -CH3, -C2H5 or ORVI, RVI = (CH2-<br>
CH2-O)w-RIX, RVI1 = alkyl radical having 1 - 4 C atoms or RVI,<br>
RIX = optionally substituted alkyl or aryl radical having 1<br>
- 10 C atoms,<br>
which are used for the preparation of storage-stable<br>
synthetic resin compositions.<br><br>
EP 0085831 discloses organosilicon compounds of the general<br>
formula<br>
A- (CH2) h-Si (CH3) iBkQ3-(i+k),<br>
in which A represents a radical from the group consisting<br>
of NHRX, -SH, -O-CH(O)CH2 or -NH-(CH2) 2-NH-(CH2) 2-NH2,<br>
B represents a radical from the group consisting of -OCH3,<br>
-OC2H5 and -OC3H7,<br>
Q represents the radical -O- (CH2-CH2-O)1-RXI, wherein one of<br>
the H atoms can be replaced by a methyl group, 1 can assume<br>
the values 2 or 3 and RXI represents an alkyl radical<br>
having 1 to 4 C atoms,<br>
which are employed in polyurethane sealing compositions.<br>
A disadvantage of the known mercaptosilanes having long-<br>
chain alkoxy groups is their low reactivity in respect of<br>
coupling to the silica. The high amplification ratio<br>
achieved in rubber mixtures by the addition of<br>
mercaptosilanes, the low hysteresis loss and the high<br>
abrasion resistance are only achieved if a sufficient<br>
mixing time is ensured. From the economic and technical<br>
aspect, however, a short mixing time is indispensable, so<br>
that it has not hitherto been possible to dispense with the<br>
use of mercaptosilanes substituted completely by methoxy<br>
and/or ethoxy groups.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide<br>
mercaptosilanes which, with economically acceptable, short<br>
mixing times and ensured processing, also lead to a high<br>
amplification ratio, a low hysteresis loss and a high<br>
abrasion resistance, with at the same time a reduced<br>
emission of alcohol compared with trimethoxy- and<br>
triethoxy-substituted mercaptosilanes.<br><br>

wherein R1 is an alkyl polyether group -O-(R5-O)m-R6, where R5 is identical or<br>

hydrocarbon group, m is an average 1 to 30, and R6 comprises at least 11 C<br>
atoms and is an unsubstituted or substituted, branched monovalent alkyl, alkenyl,<br>
aryl or aralkyl group,<br>
R2 is different and is an R1, C1-C12 alkyl or R7O group, or R2 is identical and is<br>
an C1-C12 alkyl or R7O group, where R7 is H, ethyl, propyl, a C9-C30<br>

polysiloxanes, can easily be formed from the silanes of the<br>
formula I according to the invention by addition of water<br>
and optionally addition of additives.<br>
These oligomeric or polymeric siloxanes of the compounds of<br>
the formula I can be used coupling reagents for the same<br>
uses as the monomeric compounds of the formula I.<br>
The mercaptosilane compounds according to the invention can<br>
also be in the form of a mixture of the oligomeric or<br>
polymeric siloxanes of mercaptosilanes of the general<br>
formula I or in the form of mixtures of mercaptosilanes of<br>
the general formula I with mixtures of the oligomeric or<br>
polymeric siloxanes of mercaptosilanes of the general<br>
formula I.<br><br>
The invention also provides a process for the preparation<br>
of the mercaptosilanes according to the invention, which is<br>
characterized in that silanes of the general formula II<br><br>
wherein R10 is an R7O group and R7 has the abovementioned<br>
meaning,<br>
R11 is identical or different and is an R10 or Cl-C12-alkyl<br>
group,<br>
R3 and R4 have the abovementioned meaning,<br>
are subjected to a catalysed reaction with an alkoxylated<br>
alcohol R1-H, wherein R1 has the abovementioned meaning,<br>
R7-OH being split off, and R7-OH is separated off from the<br>
reaction mixture continuously or discontinuously.<br>
The alkoxylated alcohol R1-OH can be an ethoxylated<br>
alcohol.<br>
The molar ratio of the alkoxylated alcohol R1-H to the<br>
silane of the general formula II can be at least 0.5,<br>
preferably at least 1.0.<br>
Condensation products, that is to say oligo- and<br>
polysiloxanes, can easily be formed from the silanes of the<br>
formula I according to the invention by addition of water<br>
and optionally addition of additives. However, the oligo-<br>
and polysiloxanes can also be obtained by oligomerization<br>
or co-oligomerization of the corresponding alkoxysilane<br>
compounds of the general formula II by addition of water,<br>
and by addition of additives and procedures known to the<br>
person skilled in the art in this field.<br><br>
The mercaptosilanes according to the invention can be<br>
analysed by means of high-resolution 1-H, 29-Si or 13-C NMR<br>
or GPC, and the composition of the substance mixtures<br>
formed with respect to the relative distribution of the<br>
alkoxy substituents to one another can also be determined.<br>
The mixture of homologous alkoxysilane compounds which is<br>
formed can be used as such or also after separation into<br>
individual compounds or isolated fractions.<br>
The alkoxylated alcohols R1-H used for the<br>
transesterification can be employed both as mixtures of<br>
various alcohols and as pure substance. Alkoxylated<br>
alcohols R1-H which can be employed are, for example,<br>
branched or linear alcohols which are ethoxylated/<br>
propoxylated or contain ethylene oxide units and propylene<br>
oxide units.<br>
The compounds used as catalysts for the transesterification<br>
can be metal-containing or metal-free.<br>
Metal-free compounds which can be employed are organic <br>
acids, such as, for example, trifluoroacetic acid, <br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
trialkylammonium compounds E3NH+Z- or bases, such as, for<br>
example, trialkylamines NE3, where E = alkyl and Z- = a<br>
counter-ion.	<br>

The metal and transition metal compounds can have a free<br>
coordination site on the metal.<br>
Metal or transition metal compounds which are formed by<br>
addition of water to hydrolysable metal or transition metal<br>
compounds can also be used as catalysts.<br>
In a particular embodiment, titanates, such as, for<br>
example, tetra-n-butyl orthotitanate or tetra-iso-propyl<br>
orthotitanate, can be used as catalysts.<br>
The reaction can be carried out at temperatures of between<br>
20 and 200 °C, preferably between 50 and 170 °C,<br>
particularly preferably between 80 and 150 °C. To avoid<br>
condensation reactions, it may be advantageous to carry out<br>
the reaction in an anhydrous environment, ideally in an<br>
inert gas atmosphere.<br>
The reaction can be carried out under normal pressure or<br>
reduced pressure. The reaction can be carried out<br>
continuously or discontinuously.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention can<br>
be used as adhesion promoters between inorganic materials,<br>
for example glass fibres, metals, oxidic fillers and<br>
silicas, and organic polymers, for example thermosets,<br><br>
thermoplastics or elastomers, or as crosslinking agents and <br>
surface-modifying agents. The organosilicon compounds <br>
according to the invention can be used as coupling reagents <br>
in rubber mixtures comprising fillers, for example tyre <br>
treads.	<br>
The invention also provides rubber mixtures comprising<br>
(A)	a rubber or a mixture of rubbers,<br>
(B)	a filler and<br>
(C)	at least one mercaptosilane of the general formula I.<br>
Natural rubber and/or synthetic rubbers can be used as the<br>
rubber. Preferred synthetic rubbers are described, for<br>
example, in W. Hofmann, Kautschuktechnologie, Genter<br>
Verlag, Stuttgart 1980. They can be, inter alia,<br>
polybutadiene (BR),<br>
polyisoprene (IR),<br>
styrene/butadiene copolymers, for example emulsion SBR<br>
(E-SBR) or solution SBR (S-SBR), preferably having<br>
styrene contents of from 1 to 60 wt.%, particularly<br>
preferably 5 to 50 wt.% (SBR),<br>
chloroprene (CR)<br>
isobutylene/isoprene copolymers (IIR),<br>
butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers having acrylonitrile<br>
contents of from 5 to 60, preferably 10 to 50 wt.%<br>
(NBR),<br>
partly hydrogenated or completely hydrogenated NBR<br>
rubber (HNBR)<br>
ethylene/propylene/diene copolymers (EPDM)<br><br>
the abovementioned rubbers which additionally have<br>
functional groups, such as e.g. carboxyl, silanol or<br>
epoxide groups, for example epoxidized NR, carboxy-<br>
functionalized NBR or silanol- (-SiOH) or siloxy-<br>
functionalized (-Si-OR) SBR,<br>
and mixtures of these rubbers.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the rubbers can be vulcanizable<br>
with sulfur. Anionically polymerized S-SBR rubbers<br>
(solution SBR) having a glass transition temperature above<br>
-50 °C and mixtures thereof with diene rubbers can be<br>
employed in particular for the production of car tyre<br>
treads. S-SBR rubbers in which the butadiene content has a<br>
vinyl content of more than 20 wt.% can particularly<br>
preferably be employed. S-SBR rubbers in which the<br>
butadiene content has a vinyl content of more than 50 wt.%<br>
can very particularly preferably be employed.<br>
Mixtures of the abovementioned rubbers which have an S-SBR<br>
content of more than 50 wt.%, particularly preferably more<br>
than 60 wt.%, can preferably be employed.<br>
The following fillers can be employed as fillers for the<br>
rubber mixtures according to the invention:<br>
Carbon blacks: The carbon blacks to be used here are<br>
prepared by the flame black, furnace, gas black or<br>
thermal process and have BET surface areas of from 20<br>
to 200 m2/g. The carbon blacks can optionally also<br>
contain heteroatoms, such as, for example, Si.<br>
Amorphous silicas, prepared, for example, by<br>
precipitation of solutions of silicates or flame<br>
hydrolysis of silicon halides having specific surface<br>
areas of from 5 to 1,000 m2/g, preferably 20 to<br>
400 m2/g (BET surface area) and having primary particle<br>
sizes of from 10 to 400 nm. The silicas can optionally<br><br>

oxides, such as Al, Mg, Ca, Ba, Zn and titanium oxides.<br>
Synthetic silicates, such as aluminium silicate,<br>
alkaline earth metal silicates, such as magnesium<br>
silicate or calcium silicate, having BET surface areas<br>
of from 20 to 400 m2/g and primary particle diameters<br>
of from 10 to 400 nm.<br>
Synthetic or natural aluminium oxides and hydroxides<br>
Natural silicates, such as kaolin and other naturally<br>

from 20 to 400 m2/g, particularly preferably 100 m2/g to<br>
250 m2/g, are employed in amounts of from 5 to 150 parts by<br>
wt., in each case based on 100 parts of rubber.<br>
The fillers mentioned can be employed by themselves or as a<br>
mixture.<br>
The rubber mixtures can comprise 5 to 150 parts by wt. of<br>
filler (B) and 0.1 to 25 parts by wt., preferably 2 to 20<br>
parts by wt., particularly preferably 5 to 15 parts by wt.<br>
of mercaptosilane of the formula I (C), the parts by wt.<br>
being based on 100 parts by wt. of rubber.<br>
The mercaptosilane of the formula I can be added to the<br>
mixing process either in the pure form or in a form<br>
absorbed on an inert organic or inorganic support, as well<br>
as in a form prereacted with an organic or inorganic<br>
support. Preferred support materials are precipitated or<br>
pyrogenic silicas, waxes, thermoplastics, natural or<br><br>
synthetic silicates, natural or synthetic oxides,<br>
specifically aluminium oxide, or carbon blacks. The<br>
mercaptosilane of the formula I can furthermore also be<br>
added to the mixing process in a form prereacted with the<br>
filler to be employed.<br>
The rubber mixtures can additionally comprise silicone oil<br>
and/or alkylsilane.<br>
The rubber mixtures according to the invention can comprise<br>
further known rubber auxiliaries, such as, for example,<br>
crosslinking agents, vulcanization accelerators, reaction<br>
accelerators or retardants, anti-ageing agents,<br>
stabilizers, processing auxiliaries, plasticizers, waxes or<br>
metal oxides, and optionally activators, such as<br>
triethanolamine, polyethylene glycol or hexanetriol.<br>
The rubber auxiliaries can be employed in conventional<br>
amounts, which depend, inter alia, on the intended use.<br>
Conventional amounts are, for example, amounts of from 0.1<br>
to 50 wt.%, based on the rubber.<br>
Sulfur or organic sulfur donors can be employed as<br>
crosslinking agents.<br>
The rubber mixtures according to the invention can comprise<br>
further vulcanization accelerators. For example,<br>
mercaptobenzothiazoles, sulfenamides, guanidines,<br>
dithiocarbamates, thioureas, thiocarbonates and zinc salts<br>
thereof, such as e.g. zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate, can be<br>
employed as suitable vulcanization accelerators.<br>
The rubber mixtures according to the invention can<br>
preferably additionally comprise<br>
(D)	a thiuram sulfide and/or carbamate accelerator and/or<br>
the corresponding zinc salts,<br>
(E)	a nitrogen-containing co-activator,<br>
(F) optionally further rubber auxiliaries and<br>
(G) optionally further accelerators,<br><br>
the weight ratio of accelerator (D) to nitrogen-containing<br>
co-activator (E) being equal to or greater than 1.<br>
The rubber mixtures according to the invention can comprise<br>
(D) tetrabenzylthiuram disulfide or tetramethylthiuram<br>
disulfide in at least 0.25 part by weight, based on 100<br>
parts by weight of rubber, (E) diphenylguanidine in no more<br>
than 0.25 part by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of<br>
rubber, and (G) cyclohexyl- or dicyclohexylsulfenamide in<br>
more parts by weight than (D).<br>
Preferably, sulfenamides can be employed together with<br>
guanidines and thiurams, particularly preferably<br>
cyclohexylsulfenamide or dicyclohexylsulfenamide together<br>
with diphenylguanidine and tetrabenzylthiuram disulfide or<br>
tetramethylthiuram disulfide.<br>
The vulcanization accelerators and sulfur can be employed<br>
in amounts of from 0.1 to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to<br>
5 wt.%, based on the rubber employed. Particularly<br>
preferably, sulfur and sulfenamides can be employed in<br>
amounts of from 1 to 4 wt.%, thiurams in amounts of from<br>
0.2 to 1 wt.% and guanidines in amounts of from 0 wt.% to<br>
0.5 wt.%.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the preparation<br>
of the rubber mixtures according to the invention, which is<br>
characterized in that the rubber or the mixture of<br>
rubbers (A), the filler (B), at least one mercaptosilane of<br>
the general formula I according to the invention (C) and<br>
optionally further rubber auxiliaries are mixed in a mixing<br>
unit.<br>
The mixing of the rubbers with the filler, optionally<br>
rubber auxiliaries and the mercaptosilanes according to the<br>
invention can be carried out in conventional mixing units,<br>
such as roll mills, internal mixers and mixing extruders.<br><br>
Such rubber mixtures can conventionally be prepared in<br>
internal mixers, the rubbers, the filler, the<br>
mercaptosilanes according to the invention and the rubber<br>
auxiliaries first being mixed in at 100 to 170 °C in one or<br>
several successive thermomechanical mixing stages. The<br>
sequence of addition and the time of addition of the<br>
individual components can have a decisive effect on the<br>
resulting mixture properties here. The crosslinking<br>
chemicals can conventionally be added to the rubber mixture<br>
obtained in this way in an internal mixer or on a roll mill<br>
at 40 to 110 °C and the mixture can be processed to the so-<br>
called crude mixture for the subsequent process steps, such<br>
as, for example, shaping and vulcanization.<br>
The vulcanization of the rubber mixtures according to the<br>
invention can be carried out at temperatures of from 80 to<br>
200 °C, preferably 130 to 180 °C, optionally under a<br>
pressure of from 10 to 200 bar.<br>
The rubber mixtures according to the invention can be used<br>
for the production of shaped articles, for example for the<br>
production of pneumatic tyres, tyre treads, cable<br>
sheathings, hoses, drive belts, conveyor belts, roller<br>
coverings, tyres, shoe soles, sealing elements, such as,<br>
for example, sealing rings, and damping elements.<br>
The invention also provides shaped articles obtainable from<br>
the rubber mixture according to the invention by<br>
vulcanization.<br>
The mercaptosilanes according to the invention have the<br>
advantage that even with short, commercially acceptable<br>
mixing times in rubber, the amplification ratio is high,<br>
the hysteresis loss is low and the abrasion resistance is<br>
high, and at the same time the alcohol emission is reduced<br><br>
compared with trimethoxy- and triethoxy-substituted<br>
mercaptosilanes.<br>

The recipe used for the rubber mixtures is given in the<br>
following Table 1. The unit phr here means parts by weight<br>
per 100 parts of the crude rubber employed.<br><br>
The silane according to the invention used for Example<br>
Mixture I is the mercaptosilane prepared in Example 1. Its<br>
structure corresponds to the general formula I, wherein R1<br>
is an alkyl polyether group -O- (CH2-CH2-O)m-CnH2n+i where m<br>
is on average 5 and n is 13, R2 is a mixture of R1 and<br>
ethoxy groups in the ratio of 1:1, R3 is the trimethylene<br>
group -CH2-CH2-CH2- and R4 is H.<br>
The silane Si 69 used for Reference Mixture I is<br>
commercially obtainable from Degussa AG. The silane used<br>
for Reference Mixture II is the mercaptosilane from<br>
Example 2 of the general formula III<br>
(R12)p(R13)3-pSi-(CH2)3-SH III<br>
where R12 = ethoxy and R13 is a mixture of dodecoxy and<br>
tetradecoxy, p is on average 1 and the ratio of dodecoxy to<br>
tetradecoxy is in the weight ratio of 72:28.<br>
In Reference Mixtures I and II and Example Mixture I, the<br>
base mixtures (1st + 2nd stage) are identical apart from<br>
the silanes used. Reference Mixture I differs from<br>
Reference Mixture II in the amounts of sulfur, accelerator<br>
DPG and ultra-accelerator TBzTD (3rd stage) employed.<br>
Reference Mixture I contains Si 69, a polysulfidic silane.<br>
The accelerator system must be adapted to the silane used.<br>
Since Si 69 is a sulfur donor and the mercaptosilane is not<br>
a sulfur donor, for compensation less sulfur is employed in<br>
Reference Mixture II and in Example Mixture I according to<br>
the invention than in Reference Mixture I with Si 69.<br><br><br>

The rubber mixture is prepared in three stages in an<br>
internal mixer in accordance with Table 2, economically<br>
acceptable mixing times being used.<br><br><br><br><br>
The general process for the preparation of rubber mixtures<br>
and vulcanisates thereof is described in "Rubber Technology<br>
Handbook", W. Hofmann, Hanser Verlag 1994.<br>
The rubber testing is carried out in accordance with the<br>
test methods described in Table 3.<br><br><br>
The rubber data for the crude mixture and vulcanisate are<br>
given in Table 4.<br><br><br>
It can be seen from the results in Table 4 that at the<br>
mixing times used here the mixtures comprising the silane<br>
according to the invention are superior to the reference<br>
mixtures. Reference Mixture I, comprising Si 69, shows the<br>
poorest profile of values. Reference Mixture I has a low<br>
modulus 300 %/100 % value, which is a measure of the<br>
amplification ratio. Reference Mixture I has the lowest<br>
ball rebound and the highest tan 5, 60 °C, which indicates<br>
a high rolling resistance. Furthermore, the abrasion is the<br>
worst.<br>
In Reference Mixture II the abrasion is indeed improved<br>
significantly due to the higher amplification ratio.<br><br>
However, the crude mixture data drop significantly. With a<br>
scorch time t35 of less than 5 min and a tlO % time of 0.5<br>
min, this mixture is not processable.<br>
Only Example Mixture I with the silane according to the<br>
invention shows a high amplification ratio here with<br>
simultaneously ensured processing. The scorch time t35 is<br>
prolonged by approx. 10 min compared with Reference<br>
Mixture II, and the tlO % is more than doubled. In contrast<br>
to Reference Mixture II, Example Mixture I is processable.<br>
At the same time, the ball rebound and tan 5, 60 °C show<br>
the low hysteresis loss. The DIN abrasion is reduced by<br>
13 % compared with Reference Mixture I with the commercial<br>
silane Si 69.<br>
Example 13<br>
In this example, Example Mixture I, comprising the silane<br>
according to the invention from Example 1, is compared with<br>
mixtures comprising mercaptosilanes which are substituted<br>
by alkyl polyether groups in which the substituted or<br>
uhsubstituted alkyl radical is built up from less than 11<br>
carbon units.<br>
The silane used for Reference Mixture III is the<br>
mercaptosilane from Example 3 of the general formula IV<br>
(R12)p(R14)3-PSi-(CH2)3-SH IV<br>
where R12 = ethoxy and R14 = alkyl polyether groups -O-(CH2-<br>
CH2-O)m-CnH2n+i, where m = 2, n = 1 and p is on average 1.<br>
The silane used for Reference Mixture IV is the<br>
mercaptosilane from Example 4 of the general formula IV,<br>
where R12 = ethoxy and R14 = alkyl polyether groups -O-(CH2-<br>
CH2-O)m-CnH2n+1, where m = 1, n = 2 and p is on average 1.<br><br>
The silane used for Reference Mixture V is the<br>
mercaptosilane from Example 5 of the general formula IV,<br>
where R12 = ethoxy and R14 = alkyl polyether groups -O-(CH2-<br>
CH2-O) m-CnH2n+1, where m is on average 5, n = 6 and p is on<br>
average 0.8.<br>
The silane used for Reference Mixture VI is the<br>
mercaptosilane from Example 6 of the general formula IV,<br>
where R12 = ethoxy and R14 = alkyl polyether groups -O-(CH2-<br>
CH2-O)m-CnH2n+1, where m is on average 5, n = 10 and p is on<br>
average 1.1.<br>
The recipe used for the rubber mixtures is given in the<br>
following Table 5. In this context, the unit phr again<br>
means parts by weight per 100 parts of the crude rubber<br>
employed.<br><br><br>
The rubber mixture is prepared in three stages in an<br>
internal mixer in accordance with Table 2.<br>
The rubber testing is carried out in accordance with the<br>
test methods described in Table 3.<br><br>
Under the mixing conditions used, Example Mixture I shows<br>
the best processing properties, as emerges from the rubber<br>
data for the crude mixtures given in Table 6.<br><br>
The results show that when the reference silanes from<br>
Example 3 and 4 with the shortest alkyl polyether groups<br>
are used, mixtures which can neither be processed nor<br>
employed are obtained. They have the shortest t10 % times<br>
and the Mooney viscosity cannot even be determined. From<br>
the small differences in the torques in the MDR it can be<br>
seen that these Reference Mixtures III and IV are not<br>
vulcanizable. Only if longer-chain alkyl polyether groups<br>
are used is an acceptable crosslinking yield obtained,<br>
which is reflected in the significant increase in the<br>
differences in the torques. Needless to say, it is found<br>
that only the example mixture with the mercaptosilane<br>
according to the invention has acceptable processing<br>
properties. It shows the lowest Mooney viscosity, the<br>
longest t10 % and the longest Mooney scorch time. The t10 %<br>
time is prolonged by 20 % compared with Reference<br>
Mixture VI and even by 140 % compared with Reference<br>
Mixture V. The Mooney scorch time t35 is prolonged by 32 %<br><br>
compared with Reference Mixture VI and by 184 % compared<br>
with Reference Mixture V.<br>
Example 14<br>
In this example, a mercaptosilane according to the<br>
invention in which the alkyl part of the alkyl polyether<br>
groups has a certain minimum length of 11 C units is<br>
compared with a mercaptosilane in which the alkyl part of<br>
the alkyl polyether groups does not have this minimum<br>
length, with a simultaneously increased length of the<br>
polyether part.<br>
Example Mixture I comprises the silane according to the<br>
invention from Example 1.<br>
The silane used for Reference Mixture VII is the<br>
mercaptosilane from Example 7 of the general formula IV,<br>
where R12 = ethoxy and R14 = alkyl polyether groups -O-(CH2-<br>
CH2-O)m-CnH2n+1, where m is on average 20, n = 10 and p =<br>
1.1.<br>
The recipe used for the rubber mixtures is given in the<br>
following Table 7. In this context, the unit phr again<br>
means parts by weight per 100 parts of the crude rubber<br>
employed.<br><br><br>
The rubber mixture is prepared in three stages in an<br>
internal mixer in accordance with Table 2.<br>
The rubber testing is carried out in accordance with the<br>
test methods described in Table 3.<br>
The rubber data for the crude mixture and vulcanisate are<br>
given in Table 8.<br><br><br>
It is found again that only Example Mixture I provides a<br>
balanced profile of values. In addition to the high Mooney<br>
viscosity and the high Dmax-Dmin value, Reference<br>
Mixture VII shows a very short t10 % time. Acceptable<br>
processing of this reference mixture cannot be ensured. In<br>
addition, Reference Mixture VII does not achieve the high<br>
level of Example Mixture I in the vulcanisate data. In<br>
addition to the low amplification factor (modulus 300 %/<br>
100 %) and the low ball rebound, the poor DIN abrasion is<br>
striking above all. Compared with the example mixture, this<br>
is increased by 48 %. A lengthening of the polyether part<br>
of the alkyl polyether groups (m = 5 for the silane from<br><br>
Example 1 compared with m = 20 for the silane from<br>
Example 7) thus does not lead to achievement of the object<br>
according to the invention of providing mercaptosilanes<br>
which, with economically acceptable short mixing times and<br>
ensured processing, also lead to a high amplification<br>
ratio, a low hysteresis loss and a high abrasion<br>
resistance, with at the same time a reduced emission of<br>
alcohol compared with trimethoxy- and triethoxy-substituted<br>
mercaptosilanes.<br>
Example 15<br>
Mercaptosilanes of the general formula I according to the<br>
invention with different degrees of transesterification,<br>
i.e. with differences in the substituents R2, are used in<br>
this example.<br>
The silane according to the invention used for Example<br>
Mixture II is the mercaptosilane prepared in Example 8. Its<br>
structure corresponds to the general formula I, wherein R1<br>
is an alkyl polyether group -O-(CH2-CH2-O)m-CnH2n+1, where m<br>
is on average 5 and n is 13, R2 is ethoxy CH3CH2O-, R3 is<br>
the trimethylene group -CH2-CH2-CH2- and R4 is H.<br>
The silane according to the invention used for Example<br>
Mixture III is the mercaptosilane prepared in Example 9.<br>
Its structure corresponds to the general formula I, wherein<br>
R1 is an alkyl polyether group -O- (CH2-CH2-O)m-CnH2n+1, where<br>
m is on average 5 and n is 13, R2 is a mixture of R1 and<br>
ethoxy CH3CH2O- in the ratio of 1:1, R3 is the trimethylene<br>
group -CH2-CH2-CH2- and R4 is H.<br>
The silane according to the invention used for Example<br>
Mixture IV is the mercaptosilane prepared in Example 10.<br>
Its structure corresponds to the general formula I, wherein<br>
R1 is an alkyl polyether group -O-(CH2-CH2-O) m-CnH2n+1, where<br>
m is on average 5 and n is 13, R2 is R1, R3 is the<br>
trimethylene group -CH2-CH2-CH2- and R4 is H.<br><br>
Si 69 is used for Reference Mixture VIII.<br>
The silane used for Reference Mixture IX is again the<br>
silane from Example 2.<br>
The recipe used for the rubber mixtures is given in the<br>
following Table 9. In this context, the unit phr again<br>
means parts by weight per 100 parts of the crude rubber<br>
employed. The mercaptosilanes used are metered into Example<br>
Mixtures II to IV according to the invention and Reference<br>
Mixture IX in isomolar amounts.<br><br><br>
The rubber mixture is prepared in three stages in an<br>
internal mixer in accordance with Table 2.<br>
The rubber testing is carried out in accordance with the<br>
test methods described in Table 3.<br>
The rubber data for the crude mixture and vulcanisate are<br>
given in Table 10.<br><br><br>
Reference mixture VIII is prepared with the commercially<br>
available Si 69. Under the mixing conditions used here,<br>
Reference Mixture IX prepared with the mercaptosilane<br>
according to the prior art, which is not according to the<br>
invention, indeed shows advantages in the vulcanisate data<br>
compared with Reference Mixture VIII, but the poorer values<br>
in the crude mixture data, above all the significantly<br>
increased Mooney viscosity and the extremely short t10 %<br>
time, show that this mixture cannot be processed<br>
commercially. Only the example mixtures prepared with the<br><br>
mercaptosilanes according to the invention are all<br>
commercially processable. The t10 % times are of the order<br>
of Reference Mixture VIII. The Mooney viscosities are even<br>
reduced further, compared with Reference Mixture VIII. All<br>
the example mixtures have advantages in the vulcanisate<br>
properties compared with the two reference mixtures. The<br>
tan 5 value at 60 °C is reduced significantly in all of<br>
them, and the ball rebound is increased significantly in<br>
all of them. The DIN abrasion is also at a low level in all<br>
the three example mixtures. It is therefore to be assumed,<br>
regardless of the degrees of transesterification, that a<br>
tyre with a tread based on rubber mixtures comprising the<br>
mercaptosilanes according to the invention has significant<br>
advantages in rolling resistance and abrasion compared with<br>
the prior art.<br>
Example 16<br>
It is shown in this example that the organosilane can be a<br>
mixture of various silanes corresponding to the formula I<br>
or condensation products thereof and leads to advantageous<br>
rubber values. Example Mixture V comprises the silane<br>
according to the invention from Example 1. Example<br>
Mixture VI comprises the silane according to the invention<br>
from Example 11. The silane according to the invention from<br>
Example 11 corresponds to a mixture of a silane of which<br>
the structure corresponds to the general formula I, wherein<br>
R1 is an alkyl polyether group -O-(CH2-CH2-O) m-CnH2n+1, where<br>
m is on average 5 and n is 13, R2 is a mixture of R1 and<br>
ethoxy groups in the ratio of 1.5:0.5, R3 is the<br>
trimethylene group -CH2-CH2-CH2- and R4 is H, and<br>
condensation products thereof in the ratio of approx.<br>
70:30. The recipe used for the rubber mixtures is shown in<br>
the following Table 11. In this context, the unit phr again<br><br>
means parts by weight per 100 parts of the crude rubber<br>
employed.<br><br>
The rubber mixture is prepared in three stages in an<br>
internal mixer in accordance with Table 2.<br>
The rubber testing is carried out in accordance with the<br>
test methods described in Table 3.<br>
The rubber data for the crude mixture and vulcanisate are<br>
given in Table 12.<br><br><br>
Table 12 shows that the two example mixtures give virtually<br>
identical values. The amplification level and the tan 5 are<br>
also at a high level in Example Mixture VI, as in Example<br>
Mixture V. The only significant difference lies in the<br>
scorch time. Example Mixture VI with the silane according<br>
to the invention from Example 11 even shows a significant<br>
advantage here. The prolonged scorch time shows that the<br>
scorch safety is increased here, which is advantageous for<br>
the processing of rubber mixtures.<br>
A mixture of various silanes corresponding to formula I or<br>
condensation products thereof is therefore a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br><br>

then boiled under reflux for 90 min. The suspension is<br>
cooled and the solid is filtered off. The salt which has<br>
been separated off is washed with 100 ml heptane. The<br>
entire filtrate is freed from the solvent at 65 °C on a<br>
rotary evaporator.<br>
The weight of the product is 211.4 g.<br>
An average degree of transesterification of 2 is determined<br>
for the product by 13C-NMR spectroscopy (67% Si-(OCH2-CH2) 5-<br>
O-C13H27 vs. 33 % Si-OEt functionalities) .<br><br>
Example 22<br>
Silanes of the general formula I according to the invention<br>
having substituted mercapto groups, i.e. where R4 is CN or<br>
(C=O)-R9, which are substituted by an alkyl polyether group<br>
on the silicon, are employed in this example.<br>
Example Mixture VII, comprising the silane according to the<br>
invention from Example 18, and Example Mixture VIII,<br>
comprising the silane according to the invention from<br>
Example 19, are compared with mixtures comprising silanes<br>
which correspond to the prior art.<br>
Si 69 is used for Reference Mixture X. The silane used for<br>
Reference Mixture XI is again the silane from Example 2.<br>
The recipe used for the rubber mixtures is given in the<br>
following Table 13. In this context, the unit phr again<br>
means parts by weight per 100 parts of the crude rubber<br>
employed.<br><br><br>
The rubber mixture is prepared in three stages in an<br>
internal mixer in accordance with Table 2.<br>
The rubber testing is carried out in accordance with the<br>
test methods described in Table 3. The results are shown in<br>
Table 14.<br><br><br>
It is found again that under the mixing conditions used<br>
here, Reference Mixture XI prepared with the mercaptosilane<br>
according to the prior art, which is not according to the<br>
invention, indeed has advantages in the vulcanisate data<br>
compared with Reference Mixture X prepared with the<br>
commercially available Si 69, but, as the extremely short<br>
Mooney scorch time shows, cannot be processed commercially.<br>
Only Example Mixtures VII and VIII prepared with the<br>
silanes according to the invention have a high potential of<br>
the vulcanisate data with simultaneously ensured<br>
processing. The Mooney scorch times are in the range of<br><br>
Reference Mixture X prepared with the commercially<br>
available Si 69. Example Mixture VIII even exceeds these.<br>
The DIN abrasion and modulus 300 % likewise coincide with<br>
those of Reference Mixture X, while the low value for<br>
tan 5, 60 °C shows the reduced hysteresis loss.<br>
Example 23<br>
Silanes of the general formula I according to the invention<br>
having substituted mercapto groups, i.e. where R4 is CN or<br>
(C=O)-R9, which are substituted by two alkyl polyether<br>
groups on the silicon, are employed in this example.<br>
Example Mixture IX, comprising the silane according to the<br>
invention from Example 20, and Example Mixture X,<br>
comprising the silane according to the invention from<br>
Example 21, are compared with mixtures comprising silanes<br>
which correspond to the prior art.<br>
Si 69 is used for Reference Mixture XII. The silane used<br>
for Reference Mixture XIII is again the silane from<br>
Example 2.<br>
The recipe used for the rubber mixtures is given in the<br>
following Table 15. In this context, the unit phr again<br>
means parts by weight per 100 parts of the crude rubber<br>
employed.<br><br><br>
The rubber mixture is prepared in three stages in an<br>
internal mixer in accordance with Table 2.<br>
The rubber testing is carried out in accordance with the<br>
test methods described in Table 3. The results are shown in<br>
Table 16.<br><br><br>
The known pattern emerges again. Under the mixing<br>
conditions used here, Reference Mixture XIII prepared with<br>
the mercaptosilane according to the prior art, which is not<br>
according to the invention, indeed has advantages in the<br>
vulcanisate data compared with Reference Mixture XII<br>
prepared with the commercially available Si 69, but with<br>
the amount employed used in this comparison also cannot be<br>
processed commercially. The high Mooney viscosity and the<br>
extremely short scorch times suggest problems during mixing<br>
and extrusion, while it can be concluded from the short<br>
t10 % times that vulcanization is made difficult. The crude<br><br>
mixture data of Example Mixtures IX and X according to the<br>
invention are at the level of Reference Mixture XII<br>
prepared with the commercially available Si 69, or even<br>
exceed these in Mooney scorch times. Processability on a<br>
large industrial scale is ensured. The vulcanisate data of<br>
Example Mixtures IX and X again have a high potential<br>
compared with Reference Mixture XII, and with the reduced<br>
tan δ, 60 °C values show significant advantages in the<br>
hysteresis loss.<br><br>
