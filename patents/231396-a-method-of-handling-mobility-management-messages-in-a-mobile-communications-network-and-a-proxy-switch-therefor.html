				<td>A METHOD OF HANDLING MOBILITY MANAGEMENT MESSAGES IN A<br>
MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK AND A PROXY SWITCH<br>
THEREFOR<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to mobile communications and, more particularly, to the<br>
use of a proxy switch in a mobile communication network to improve capacity and cost-<br>
effectiveness of the communications network and to offer a platform for new mobile<br>
services.<br>
2.	Discussion of Related Art<br>
All modern mobile communication systems have a hierarchical arrangement, in<br>
which a geographical "coverage area" is partitioned into a number of smaller<br>
geographical areas called "cells." Referring to figure 1, each cell is preferably served by<br>
a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) 102a. Several BTS 102b-n are aggregated via fixed<br>
links 104a-n into a Base Station Controller (BSC) 106a. The BTSs and BSC are<br>
sometimes collectively referred to as the Base Station Subsystem (BS) 107. Several<br>
BSCs 106b-n may be aggregated into a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 110 via fixed<br>
links 108a-n.<br>
The MSC 110 acts as a local switching exchange (with additional features to<br>
handle mobility management requirement, discussed below) and communicates with the<br>
phone network (PSTN) 120 through trunk groups. Under U.S. mobile networks, there is<br>
a concept of a home MSC and a Gateway MSC. The home MSC is the MSC<br>
corresponding to the exchange associated with a Mobile Station (MS); this association is<br>
based on the phone number, e.g., area code, of the MS. (The home MSC is responsible<br>
for the HLR discussed below). The Gateway MSC, on the other hand, is the exchange<br>
used to connect the MS call to the PSTN. Consequently, some times the home MSC and<br>
the Gateway MSC are the same entity, but other times they are not (e.g., when the MS is<br>
roaming). Typically, a Visiting Location Register (VLR) 116 is co-located with the MSC<br>
110 and a logically singular HLR is used in the mobile network. As will be explained<br><br>
below, the HLR and VLR are used for storing many types of subscriber information and<br>
profiles.<br>
Briefly, a number of radio channels 112 are associated with the entire coverage<br>
area. The radio channels are partitioned into groups of channels allocated to individual<br>
cells. The channels are used to carry signaling information to establish call connections<br>
and the like, and to carry voice or data information once a call connection is established.<br>
At a relatively high level of abstraction, mobile network signaling involves at<br>
least two main aspects. One aspect involves the signaling between an MS and the rest of<br>
the network. With 2G ("2G" is the industry term used for "second generation") and later<br>
technology, this signaling concerns access methods used by the MS (e.g., time-division<br>
multiple access, or TDMA; code-division multiple access, or CDMA), assignment of<br>
radio channels, authentication, etc. A second aspect involves the signaling among the<br>
various entities in the mobile network, such as the signaling among MSCs, VLRs, HLRs,<br>
etc. This second part is sometimes referred to as the Mobile Application Part (MAP)<br>
especially when used in the context of Signaling System No. 7 (SS7).<br>
The various forms of signaling (as well as the data and voice communication) are<br>
transmitted and received in accordance with various standards. For example, the<br>
Electronics Industries Association (EIA) and Telecommunications Industry Association<br>
(TIA) help define many U.S. standards, such as IS-41, which is a MAP standard.<br>
Analogously, the CCITT and ITU help define international standards, such as GSM-<br>
MAP, which is an international MAP standard. Information about these standards is well<br>
known and may be found from the relevant organizing bodies as well as in the literature,<br>
see, e.g., Bosse, SIGNALING IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS (Wiley 1998).<br>
To deliver a call from an MS 114, a user dials the number and presses "send" on<br>
a cell phone or other MS. The MS 114 sends the dialed number indicating the service<br>
requested to the MSC 110 via the BS 107. The MSC 110 checks with an associated VLR<br>
116 (more below) to determine if the MS 114 is allowed the requested service. The<br>
Gateway MSC routes the call to the local exchange of the dialed user on the PSTN 120<br>
The local exchange alerts the called user terminal, and an answer back signal is routed<br>
back to the MS 114 through the serving MSC 110 which then completes the speech path,<br>
to the MS. Once the setup is completed the call may proceed.<br><br>
To deliver a call to a MS 114, (assuming that the call originates from the PSTN<br>
120) the PSTN user dials the MS's associated phone number. At least according to U.S.<br>
standards, the PSTN 120 routes the call to the MS's home MSC (which may or may not<br>
be the one serving the MS). The MSC then interrogates the HLR 118 to determine<br>
which MSC is currently serving the MS. This also acts to inform the serving MSC that a<br>
call is forthcoming. The home MSC then routes the call to the serving MSC. The<br>
serving MSC pages the MS via the appropriate BS. The MS responds and the<br>
appropriate signaling links are setup.<br>
During a call, the BS 107 and MS 114 may cooperate to change channels or<br>
BTSs 102, if needed, for example, because of signal conditions. These changes are<br>
known as "handoffs," and they involve their own types of known messages and<br>
signaling.<br>
One aspect of MAP involves "mobility management." Briefly, different BSs and<br>
MSCs may be needed and used to serve an MS, as the MS 114 roams to different<br>
locations. Mobility management ensures that the Gateway MSC has the subscriber<br>
profile and other information the MSC needs to service (and bill) calls correctly. To this<br>
end, MSCs use a Visiting Location Register (VLR) 116 and a Home Location Register<br>
(HLR) 118. The HLR is used to store and retrieve the mobile identification number<br>
(MIN), the electronic serial number (ESN), MS status, and the MS service profile,<br>
among other things. The VLR stores similar information in addition to storing an MSC<br>
identification that identifies the Gateway MSC. In addition, under appropriate MAP<br>
protocols, location update procedures (or registration notifications) are performed so that<br>
the home MSC of a mobile subscriber knows the location of its users. These procedures<br>
are used when a MS roams from one location to another or when a MS is powered on<br>
and registers itself to access the network. For example a location update procedure may<br>
proceed with the MS 114 sending a location update request to the VLR 116 via the BS<br>
107 and MSC 110. The VLR 116 sends a location update message to the HLR 118<br>
serving the MS 114, and the subscriber profile is downloaded from the HLR 118 to the<br>
VLR 116. The MS 114 is sent an acknowledgement of a successful location update. The<br>
HLR 118 requests the VLR (if any) that previously held profile data to delete the data<br>
related to the relocated MS 114.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows in more detail the signaling and user traffic interfaces between a<br>
BS 107 and an MSC 110 in a CDMA mobile network. The BS 107 communicates<br>
signaling information using the Al interface. The A2 interface carries the user traffic<br>
(e.g., voice signals) between the switch component 204 of the MSC and the BS 107. The<br>
A5 interface is used to provide a path for user traffic for circuit-switched data calls (as<br>
opposed to voice calls) between the source BS and the MSC.<br>
As the number of cell sites or the number of subscribers grows, the load on the<br>
MSC 110 increases. This increased load forces the service provider to add more capacity<br>
to the system. Typically, to add more capacity, the service provider adds more switch<br>
modules to the MSC or deploys additional MSCs in the network. Either alternative<br>
involves significant cost.<br>
Moreover, subscribers are demanding newer services, e.g., "data calls" to the<br>
Internet. For some of these services MSCs are not cost effective because they were<br>
primarily designed for voice calls. Integration of new services into the MSC is<br>
complicated or infeasible because of the proprietary and closed designs used by many<br>
MSC software architectures. That is, the software logic necessary to provide the services<br>
is not easy to add to the MSC 110. Often, a switch adjunct is used to provide such<br>
services. For example, an Inter-Working Function (IWF) is an adjunct to route a data<br>
call to the Internet. Either approach - integrating functionality into the MSC or adding a<br>
trunk-side adjunct — involves the MSC in the delivery of service. Since the new service<br>
is expected to spur demand, integrating new services via MSC design changes or through<br>
trunk-side adjuncts is likely to exacerbate network congestion at the MSC and require<br>
costly MSC resources.<br>
Summary<br>
The invention provides systems and methods of mobile communication. In<br>
particular, switching operations are performed between at least one mobile switching<br>
center (MSC) and at least one base station subsystem (BS). The switching, according to<br>
one aspect of the invention, allows communication traffic to be siphoned to or from an<br>
alternative network. In connection with handling calls (voice, data, etc.) in such an<br>
environment, one aspect of the invention entails providing mobility management within<br>
the network.<br><br>
According to one aspect of the invention, a proxy switch includes signaling<br>
message handling logic for receiving signaling messages from the MSC and BS in<br>
accordance with a mobile signaling protocol. The switch also includes state logic for<br>
maintaining state information of call sessions and mobile stations (MSs) used within the<br>
mobile communications network, and message interception logic for detecting whether<br>
the signaling message is a handoff message from a MS. The message interception logic<br>
prevents the handoff messages from being forwarded to the MSC if the MS is involved<br>
in the call, and if the MSC is not involved in the call. The switch further includes<br>
message conversion logic for converting a handoff message to a location update message<br>
for transmission to the MSC if the MS is involved in the call, and if the MSC is not<br>
involved in the call; and message transmission logic for transmitting the handoff<br>
messages to the MSC if the MS is not involved in the call.<br>
Under another aspect of the invention, a mobile communications network having<br>
at least one BS, at least one MS, at least one MSC, and at least one switch in<br>
communication with at least one of the BSs and at least one of the MSCs is provided.<br>
The switch receives a handoff message from a mobile station via a base station<br>
subsystem, and the switch forms a location update message from information in the<br>
handoff message. The location update message is sent to a MSC addressed in the<br>
handoff message.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention provide a proxy switch and a method of<br>
use thereof in a mobile communications network. The proxy switch is preferably<br>
positioned between an MSC and a BS, "transparent" to the other components, meaning<br>
that neither the BS or the MSC needs to know of the proxy switch nor do they need to<br>
alter their behavior or functionality because of the existence of the proxy switch.<br>
Instead, the BS and MSC operate as they do conventionally, ignorant of the existence of<br>
the proxy switch.<br>
Among its many advantages, the proxy switch may help alleviate congestion in a<br>
mobile network. For example, the proxy switch may be used (a) to siphon MS-<br>
originated communication traffic off the network before it gets to an MSC and (b) to<br><br>
send the siphoned traffic to the desired destination via an alternative network, such as a<br>
packet-based network. Similarly, the proxy switch may be used to deliver<br>
communications to an MS from an alternative network. Consequently, costly MSC and<br>
PSTN resources may be avoided, and the proxy switch may be used to increase network<br>
capacity cost effectively.<br>
In addition, the proxy switch defines a set of enabling functions that allow new<br>
communication services to be provided to the network. For example, using the proxy<br>
switch, new call waiting services may be integrated into the mobile network.<br>
Figure 3A shows one preferred deployment of a proxy switch 300, in which the<br>
proxy switch 300 is positioned between the BS 107 and the MSC 110. Only a subset of<br>
trunks 306 carrying user traffic needs to be terminated on the proxy switch; other trunks<br>
308 may directly connect the MSC 110 and BS 107. All control links 312 from BS 107<br>
terminate at proxy switch 300. The proxy switch includes a control plane 302 and a data<br>
plane 304 (also known as a "bearer plane"). The control plane 302 handles all the<br>
signaling traffic, and the data plane 304 handles all the user traffic for the trunks<br>
connected to the proxy switch.<br>
Under the preferred deployments, the proxy switch 300 communicates according<br>
to the same signaling protocol on both sides of the control plane 302. For example, in<br>
embodiments suitable to CDMA technology, the signaling links 312 between the BS 107<br>
and the proxy switch 300 convey information according to the IS-634/IOS Al interface.<br>
Similarly, the signaling links 314 between the MSC 110 and the proxy switch 300<br>
convey information according to the Al interface. This situation contrasts with other<br>
mobile switching complexes such as the MSC or the BS in which different signaling<br>
standards are used for communication on the different sides of the switch. The MSC for<br>
example has Al interface on one side of the complex and communicates according to<br>
SS7/ISUP on the other (i.e., the PSTN side of the switch).<br>
Under other embodiments, the proxy switch terminates newer ingress interfaces<br>
A8, A9, and egress interfaces A10, All for CDMA2000 for carrying packet-based<br>
traffic, both signaling and user traffic. Current MSCs do not support these ingress<br>
interfaces.<br><br>
The proxy switch's data plane 304 uses th me r- indards on each side of the<br>
switch. BS-side trunks 306, in CDMA embodiment, communicate according to the A2<br>
and A5 interfaces, depending on whether voice or data, respectively, is being carried on<br>
the trunks. Likewise, MSC-side trunks 307 use the same interfaces. In contrast, the<br>
MSC has A2/A5 on one side but communicates according to PSTN 64kb/s pulse coded<br>
modulation standards on the other side.<br>
In addition, whereas all of the other entities in a mobile network use their own<br>
point codes within their signaling ("point codes" are used as unique identifiers in the<br>
network), in certain embodiments, the proxy switch 300 does not use its point code and<br>
instead uses the point codes contained in the messages it receives. By using the point<br>
codes of the BS or MSC, instead of the point code for the proxy switch, transparency of<br>
the proxy switch is facilitated.<br>
Under certain embodiments, there is a one to one correspondence between an<br>
MSC and a proxy switch. Several BSs may work with a single proxy switch.<br>
Figure 3B shows another preferred deployment. In the deployment of figure 3B,<br>
the proxy switch 300 may be in communication with more than one MSC 110j-l 10k-<br>
The control plane 302 of the proxy switch 300, like the deployment of figure 3a, may<br>
receive control signals 312a-n from several BSs 107a-n. In addition, the data plane 304<br>
may receive trunks 306a-n from several BSs. Unlike the deployment of figure 3a,<br>
however, the deployment of figure 3b also receives and sends information on signaling<br>
links 314j-k to multiple MSCs llOj-k.<br>
The deployment of figure 3b may be configured to distribute the load on the<br>
system better, to improve reliability (by providing an alternative path to an MS), and to<br>
provide services that consistently match a user's profile. Under one embodiment that<br>
uses the deployment of figure 3B, the system may be configured so that calls from a<br>
given caller are routed to an MSC that handles most of the user's traffic (as opposed to<br>
merely being the geographical location where the user turns on his or her MS 114). This<br>
determination may be based on statistical monitoring or may be configured into a user's<br>
profile. By so configuring the system, the amount of location update messages and the<br>
like may be reduced. Under other embodiments, the proxy switch may be configured so<br>
that calls are directed to MSCs that are relatively underutilized. In this fashion, system<br><br>
administrators may better tailor the load on the entire communication systejfl under<br>
management. In addition, calls may be routed to MSCs that provide services consistent<br>
with a given user's profile.<br>
The proxy switch 300 includes software that accepts all signaling messages and,<br>
depending on the message and the state of the system, performs at least one of the<br>
following:<br>
1.	passes the message unaltered to the MSC or BS addressed in the message;<br>
2.	intercepts messages between the MSC and BS;<br>
3.	for some intercepted messages, converts the intercepted messages to a<br>
different message and sends the converted message in place of the original,<br>
intercepted message to the MSC or BS addressed in the intercepted message;<br>
4.	siphons the message from the mobile- and PSTN-based network to an<br>
alternative network.<br>
The types of actions performed in each case along with the triggering events are<br>
described below.<br>
In many instances, particularly when a message from an MS 114 is siphoned and<br>
the traffic is directed to an alternative network, the proxy switch 300 may act as an MSC<br>
110. In such a role, the proxy switch fulfills the responsibilities and roles that a<br>
traditional MSC would perform. Some of these functions and roles pertain to mobility<br>
management. Consider the case of a roaming MS; as it roams from one cell to another, it<br>
may roam to a cell served by a different MSC, thus necessitating a handoff between the<br>
source and target MSCs. If the proxy switch 300 has siphoned the message and the<br>
call/session has been directed to an alternative network, then the handoff has to be<br>
managed by the proxy switch analogously to the way a handoff would be managed by a<br>
conventional MSC. The proxy switch has to ensure that the appropriate databases are<br>
updated with the new location of the MS. Another function of the proxy switch pertains<br>
to the assignment of resources. In particular, when an MS initiates a message requesting<br>
a new call/session, appropriate circuits (channels) need to be assigned for this session<br>
Depending on the configuration of the system and the system state, the proxy switch<br>
makes such assignments analogously to the way conventional MSC assigns circuits.<br><br>
Figure 4 shows an exemplary deployment in which the proxy switch 300 is<br>
connected to several alternative networks, such as an IP backbone 412 or an alternative<br>
circuit-based network 414, e.g., a different carrier. These alternative networks may be<br>
used to carry voice and/or data traffic to desired destinations while avoiding in whole or<br>
in part the PSTN 120 along with the costly resources of MSC 110. Alternatively, these<br>
arrangements may be used so that circuit traffic could be backhauled to a different<br>
network; for example, circuit traffic from Nashua, NH could be backhauled to an MSC<br>
in Waltham MA. Or, they may be used to connect to other networks. For example, the<br>
IP backbone 412 may communicate with IP voice networks 418 or the Internet 416. As<br>
will be explained below, when siphoning traffic to an alternative network both control<br>
information (e.g., from the signaling messages) and voice or data from the bearer circuits<br>
on links 306 may be sent via an alternative network.<br>
To support these exemplary deployments and to maintain transparency, preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention provide certain core functionality. The core functions<br>
facilitate siphoning of traffic from the trunks 306 before they reach the MSC 110;<br>
facilitate the injection of traffic onto trunks 306 from alternative networks; facilitate<br>
transparent operation; serve as building blocks for higher level applications; and/or<br>
support error recovery procedures.<br>
Procedure for mobility management in the presence of a proxy switch<br>
When a MS 114 roams in a network, standard procedures for mobility<br>
management require the MS to issue location updates or registration notifications as the<br>
MS roams from one cell to another. These updates are received by the MSC 110 (via the<br>
BSC), and eventually, the VLR/HLR complex is updated with the new location of the<br>
MS. However, the standard procedures may not work in certain embodiments and<br>
system states of the invention. For example, the MS may be involved in a call that does<br>
not use the MSC (e.g., one being handled by an alternative network) yet the MS may<br>
need to issue location update or handoff messages. To this end, preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention provide mobility management logic for the proxy switch, described with<br>
reference to figures 3 and 5 conjointly.<br>
If a location update or handoff message is received from the BS 107 by the proxy<br>
switch 300, the proxy switch 300 determines whether the MS is currently involved in a<br><br>
call 505. If the MS is not involved in a call, then the proxy switch 300 allows the<br>
location update message to pass through 510 to the MSC 110. The MSC 110 then<br>
updates 515 the VLR 116 as it does conventionally. The logic flow then ends 599.<br>
If the proxy switch 300 determines that the MS 114 is involved in a call, the<br>
proxy switch checks 520 to see if the MSC 110 is involved in the call. For example, tins<br>
may be done by analyzing state information for the call (also known as a "session")<br>
maintained by the proxy switch. If the MSC is involved in a call with the MS, then the<br>
proxy switch proceeds as described above, except that this time a handoff message is<br>
passed through to the MSC 110.<br>
If the MS is involved in a call and the MSC is not involved with that call, the<br>
proxy switch 300 intercepts the handoff message 525 from the BS 107 and, using the<br>
information in the handoff message, converts the handoff message into a location update<br>
message 530. The location update message is then sent 535 to the MSC 110 and the<br>
proxy switch updates its own local database (not shown) reflecting the change. This local<br>
database serves as a VLR for the proxy switch and holds all of the information that a<br>
VLR does (since the proxy switch at times needs to function akin to an MSC). The<br>
proxy switch 300 then sends an acknowledgment message 540 to the BS 107. The logic<br>
flow then ends 599.<br>
Procedure for managing supplementary features in the presence of a proxy switch<br>
Under preferred embodiments of the invention, an MS may be busy at times<br>
when the MSC believes the MS is idle; for example, the MS may be busy with a data or<br>
voice call that is being handled by an alternative network when the MSC is attempting to<br>
deliver a call to the MS from the PSTN 120. To support such a situation, the proxy<br>
switch 300 provides logic for informing the MS of such a situation. Using this logic,<br>
supplementary services, such as traditional call waiting, may be provided by the proxy<br>
switch. Moreover, new forms of call waiting and other new services may be built on this<br>
core support function.<br>
Referring to figures 3 and 6A conjointly, when a call comes into the proxy switch.<br>
300 from the MSC 110, the proxy switch determines whether or not the MS is involved<br>
in a call at the time the message comes in 602. If the MS is not busy, then the proxy<br><br>
switch 300 allows the MSC-originated message to pass through to the B5/603. The logic<br>
flow then ends 699.<br>
If the MS is busy, the proxy switch then determines 604 if the MS call is being<br>
handled by the proxy switch but not by the MSC; for example, the call may be handled<br>
by an alternative network connected to the proxy switch (see figure 4) in which case the<br>
proxy switch needs to handle the call acting akin to an MSC; the proxy does not simply<br>
let messages pass through. If the call is being handled by the proxy switch but not by the<br>
MSC, the proxy switch intercepts 605 the call from the MSC 110, and converts 606 the<br>
intercepted message into a feature notification message. The proxy switch 300 then<br>
issues 607 the feature notification message to BS 107 for subsequent transmission to the<br>
MS 114, which will be used to notify the user of the incoming call. The proxy switch<br>
intercepts 608 any responses from the BS to the feature notification message and acts<br>
accordingly. How the proxy switch acts depends on the application using this logic.<br>
If the MS is involved in a call handled by the proxy, and also involved with a call<br>
handled by the MSC, then the proxy switch takes an action 609 identified as a response<br>
for such a state. This action will depend on the particular application involved.<br>
Traditional call waiting is but one such service that may be built upon the above core<br>
function.<br>
If at some moment in time, the MS is involved in two calls both involving the<br>
alternative network, and a third call arrives for the MS either from the alternative<br>
network or the MSC, the proxy switch will direct this third call as per the logic of the<br>
application. For example, in call waiting applications, the third call would be routed as<br>
per instructions contained in the subscriber profile; a common option is to direct the call<br>
to the voice mail of the subscriber. A similar logic is used if the MS is involved in two<br>
calls both involving the MSC, and a third call arrives for the MS from the alternative<br>
work; again, the subscriber profile dictates how this third call is to be handled and this<br>
logic is followed by the proxy switch. Finally, it should be noticed that if the MS is<br>
involved in two calls both involving the MSC and a third call arrives for die MS, the<br>
MSC itself, in this case, will determine the logic it follows to handle this third call.<br>
For example, figures 3 and 6B conjointly illustrate an exemplary call waiting<br>
application. The logic acts as described above through the acts labeled 608 or 609<br><br>
(notice that figure 6B starts with blocks 608 or 609, as opposed to 600); that is, though<br>
figure 6B helps describe a particular supplementary feature like traditional call waiting,<br>
the initial acts for this supplementary feature are those described with reference to figure<br>
6A.<br>
If the logic starts at 608, it means that the proxy switch has already detected that<br>
the MS is involved with a call, the proxy switch is handling the call, but the MSC is not.<br>
At this point, the proxy switch has already intercepted call requests from the MSC,<br>
converted them into a feature notification and issues the feature notification to the BS.<br>
The proxy then receives and intercepts responses to such message from the BS.<br>
Under the call waiting application logic of figure 6B, if the user indicated that<br>
they are willing to accept the call, the proxy switch converts 615 the response to a<br>
message indicating that the MS is accepting-the new call from the MSC. The proxy<br>
switch 300 then issues 620 the converted message to the MSC. At this point in this<br>
example, the MSC "thinks" the call is an ordinary call, that is, the MSC state reflects<br>
only one call session to the MS. In fact, with the acceptance of the new call, the user is<br>
receiving two calls in call waiting mode: one call being handled by the MSC and another<br>
by the proxy switch. The proxy switch state reflects the two calls. The proxy switch 300<br>
assists 625 the MSC 110 with setting up a new call. (This last step is only reached if the<br>
user accepted the call; if the user did not accept it, the proxy logic times out and never<br>
gets to act 625.) For example, the proxy switch 300 may need to park calls from an<br>
alternative network so that the accepted call from the MSC can go through to the MS.<br>
The proxy switch 300 then intercepts 630 any subsequent feature notification responses<br>
from the MS and re-directs to MSC or proxy switch as needed. For example, the user<br>
may want to "toggle" between calls being served by the mobile and the alternative<br>
networks. The proxy switch may need to interpret this response to park one call and<br>
connect another to the user as part of the act of intercepting subsequent feature<br>
notifications. In other circumstances, the proxy switch may need to send this type of<br>
response to the MSC if the MSC has multiple calls (some parked) intending to connect to<br>
the MS. When the call ends, the proxy switch 300 sends 640 appropriate billing<br>
information to the system. This is needed so that the user is billed appropriately when<br>
services are rendered not involving the MSC. The manner in which the information is<br>
kept and send to a billing system depends on the implementation and service provider<br><br>
using the system. Most service providers specify the manner in which billing<br>
information is to be collected, formatted and delivered.<br>
If the MS 114 is involved with a call and is also involved with a call handled by<br>
the MSC, and if the MSC indicates a new call is intended for the MS, then the proxy<br>
switch 300 may be configured to intercept 650 the feature notification message from the<br>
MSC that is destined for the BS 107. The feature notification message is blocked 655<br>
from being passed to the BS, and consequently no response is issued 660 to the MSC<br>
from the BS, because the feature notification message was blocked from being sent to the<br>
BS. The logic flow then ends 699. The MSC does not get a response and assumes the<br>
MS does not want to receive the call. The MSC then uses standard procedures to<br>
terminate this call, e.g., voice mail of subscriber or plays a message stating the subscriber<br>
is unavailable.<br>
The call waiting application logic of figure 6B is limited to handling two<br>
concurrent calls. The same general approach may be extended to handling more than<br>
two calls for call waiting, to handling multiple calls from an alternative network, to<br>
handling data calls and voice calls, and the like.<br>
Procedure for fault management in the presence of a proxy switch<br>
Standard procedures exist for fault management of the signaling links between<br>
the BS 107 and the MSC 110. Under these procedures, both the BS and the MSC are<br>
considered as peers, say Peerl and Peer2. Both peers maintain two sets of numbers,<br>
called the Forward Sequence Number (FSN) and the Backward Sequence Number<br>
(BSN). The FSN identifies the last message sent to a peer and the BSN identifies the<br>
last message received from a peer. For example, assume there exist two signaling links<br>
SLC0 and SLCl between Peerl and Peer2. If Peerl has FSN=5 and Peer2 has BSN=3<br>
then Peerl knows that it has sent all messages up to and including message 5 to Peer2;<br>
Peer 2 knows that it has received all messages up to and including message 3. If SLC0<br>
breaks and Peerl detects such a break, Peerl sends a Change Over Order (COO)<br>
message to Peer2 requesting Peer 2 to change over to link SLCl. Peer2 responds with<br>
COA (Change Over Acknowledged). Included in these messages are the BSN numbers<br>
based upon which missing messages can be re-transmitted. For example, in the above<br>
instance, messages 4 and 5 need to be retransmitted to Peer 2.<br><br>
As a further example, consider an instance wherein Peerl has FSN=40 and<br>
BSN=6; Peer2 has FSN=8 and BSN=5. Also assume that there are two signaling links<br>
existing between Peerl and Peer2, denoted as SLCO and SLC1, and that SLCO breaks as<br>
detected by Peerl. Then, Peerl sends a COO message using link SLC1 to Peer2 and<br>
includes its BSN (=6) in the COO message. When Peer2 receives this message, it<br>
compares the received BSN with its internal FSN (=8) and hence determines that the last<br>
2 messages (8-6=2) need to be re-transmitted. Peer2 queues up the last two messages to<br>
be re-transmitted and sends out a COA message containing its BSN (=5). Peerl receives<br>
the COA message and compares the received BSN with its internal FSN (=10) and<br>
determines that the last 5 messages (10-5=5) need to be re-transmitted. These last 5<br>
messages are queued up by Peerl to be re-transmitted to Peer2.<br>
Under preferred embodiments, the standard replay and recovery mechanism<br>
between the BS and MS are not expected to work. In short, the BS 107 may send<br>
messages to the proxy switch that are never received by the MSC, e.g., siphoned<br>
messages, and vice- versa, e.g., MSC messages that are blocked. Consequently, the<br>
basic FSN/BSN state at the BS and the MSC will not accurately reflect the state of the<br>
whole system.<br>
Accordingly, under preferred embodiments of the invention, the proxy switch<br>
provides a new form of fault management. Referring to figures 3 and 7A-B conjointly,<br>
the proxy switch creates 705 one set of FSN and BSN counters for each link to the MSC<br>
110 and one set of FSN and BSN counters for each link to the BS 107. With particular<br>
reference to figure 7B, which shows a single link arrangement to illustrate the concept,<br>
the FSN /BSN pair 787 on the MSC for the link 785 and the FSN/BSN pair 789 for the<br>
link 786 are conventional. Pair 787 tracks the number of messages sent and<br>
acknowledged (or "acked") on link segment 785 out of the MSC; pair 789 tracks the<br>
same but out of the BS. The proxy switch 300 includes FSN /BSN pairs 788 and 790.<br>
Pair 788 tracks the number of messages sent and acked on link segment 786 out of the<br>
proxy switch 300 toward the BS 107; pair 790 tracks the number of messages sent and<br>
acked on link segment 785 out of the proxy switch 300 toward the MSC 110.<br>
As alluded to above, there is no expectation that the values for pair 787 will equal<br>
the values for 788. For example, an MSC message may be blocked from being<br><br>
transmitted to the BS 107 as a part of normal proxy switch logic, as discussed herein. By<br>
so blocking the message, the FSN value of 787 should be one higher than that of 788. In<br>
addition, there is no expectation that the discrepancy between FSN and BSN of 787 and<br>
of the FSN and BSN 788 should be equal. For example, assume the simple case of one<br>
message from MSC 110 that is supposed to be blocked at proxy switch 300 as a part of<br>
normal proxy switch logic, as discussed herein. The discrepancy at 787 will be one until<br>
there is an acknowledgement received at MSC 110, but there will be no discrepancy at<br>
pair 788, because no messages are sent to BS 107.<br>
As messages are received at the proxy switch 300, the proxy switch intercepts<br>
them and updates the FSN/BSN pairs as outlined above.<br>
If the proxy switch 300 detects 715 a COO message from the MSC 110,<br>
indicating that link 785 went down, then the proxy switch 300 intercepts that message<br>
720 and does not allow it to pass to the BS 107. The COO includes the BSN information<br>
of pair 787 and identifies a new link (not shown) that the signaling should changeover to.<br>
The proxy switch then forces a break 725 on a link 786 between the proxy switch and the<br>
BS (link 786 corresponds to the link 785). The break is simulated as follows. Every few<br>
milliseconds conventional BSs and the MSCs send out messages called "fill in signals,"<br>
which are received and the receiver then knows the links are operational. If the receiver<br>
does not get a fill in signal in the specified length of time, it assumes a break and sends a<br>
COO message. So to simulate a break, one embodiment of the invention modifies the<br>
software-based protocol state machine to not send the "fill in signal," and hence signal a<br>
break and cause a COO to be generated at the proxy switch (the modification being<br>
relative to conventional MSC).<br>
The proxy switch generates a COO message to the BS 107 with BSN of pair 788.<br>
as opposed to the BSN information in the original COO message which contained<br>
information for pair 787. This new COO informs the BS of the number of messages it<br>
received on (the emulated-broken) link (i.e., BSN of 788). The generated COO uses a<br>
new link (not shown in figure 7B) which is used to changeover to. This new link<br>
corresponds to the changeover link to between the proxy switch 300 and the MSC 110.<br>
The modified BSN numbers are then sent 735 to the BS 107 with the new COO<br>
message. The COO is sent on an unbroken link. The proxy switch 300 then waits for and<br><br>
receives a COA (acknowledgement) message 740 from the BS 107, and generates 745 a<br>
new COA message. The new COA will contain the BSN information of pah- 790, as<br>
opposed to the information in pair 789. The new COA is sent 750 to the MSC 110.<br>
The proxy switch then awaits for and receives retransmitted information to be<br>
sent on the new link from the MSC and from the BS. Any information received is then<br>
retransmitted 755 to the respective destination or handled as it would be in the ordinary<br>
course of things (including potentially being blocked etc. as described herein). The logic<br>
flow ends 799.<br>
Under the above embodiment, the proxy switch relies on the BS or the MSC to<br>
detect breaks in respective signaling links. The break in the signaling link is forced as a<br>
result of current BS architectures; i,.e., the breaks are needed to create the necessary<br>
events for COOs. Under other embodiments, the proxy switch may detect breaks, and in<br>
response to such, the proxy switch would mimic a MSC in relation to a BS or mimic a<br>
BS in relation to a MSC.<br>
Procedure for Automatic Triggering of Siphoning Based on COO messages<br>
Under certain embodiments of the invention, the proxy switch may dynamically<br>
determine when the system may benefit from redirecting (or siphoning) messages to an<br>
alternative network (see, e.g., 400, figure 4). For example, under one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the proxy switch 300 monitors the signaling bandwidth directly or indirectly<br>
as a measure of system bandwidth (e.g., reduced signaling bandwidth translating to<br>
reduced system bandwidth). In one embodiment, a Change Over Order (COO) from the<br>
MSC may be used as a signal of congestion at the MSC, or at least that the bandwidth<br>
to/from the MSC will be impaired until the effected link is revived and traffic is changed<br>
back to that link. Thus, the proxy switch 300 interprets a COO as a triggering event from<br>
to "slow down" traffic to the MSC, and in response, initiates traffic siphoning to an<br>
alternative network connected to the proxy switch.<br>
One form of exemplary logic in this regard is shown with reference to figure 8<br>
The proxy switch creates 805 one set of FSN and BSN counters for each link to the MSC<br>
110 and to the BS 107. Each message to or from the BS is intercepted and the sequence<br>
numbers are updated 810 accordingly. If the proxy switch 300 detects 815 a COO<br><br>
message from the MSC 110, then the proxy switch 300 intercepts that message 820 and<br>
does not allow it to pass to the BS 107. In this instance, the COO only reflects the<br>
requested changeover and does not indicate that messages need to be replayed. The<br>
proxy switch 300 then generates a COA message 825 with modified BSN numbers for<br>
MSC and sends COA message 830 to the MSC 110. The modified sequence numbers are<br>
the ones created by the proxy switch during the processing of messages, similar to that<br>
described above. Thus, the MSC now believes that its COO has happened.<br>
Communication bandwidth between the MSC and the BS will be lower as a consequence<br>
of the changeover, since one less signaling link is available.<br>
However, though the bandwidth between the proxy switch 300 and the MSC may<br>
be impaired as a result of COO described above, the bandwidth between the BS 107 and<br>
the proxy switch 300 is not impaired. The proxy switch may take advantage of this<br>
context by siphoning traffic to an alternative network. Accordingly, the proxy switch<br>
initiates traffic siphoning 835 for traffic generated from the BS-side of the proxy switch.<br>
There are many types of alternative networks that may be used to carry voice as well as<br>
data traffic from a MS 114 (see, e.g., figure 4). If there are multiple types of alternative<br>
networks connected to the proxy switch, then the proxy switch may select the type of<br>
alternative network based on the type of communication, e.g., data or voice. In<br>
initiating the siphoning, the proxy switch will configure the data plane as needed to route<br>
certain bearer circuit traffic to appropriate alternative networks (as will be explained<br>
below). For example, the VoIP assembly 404 may be configured with information<br>
extracted from the signaling messages.<br>
The siphoning of traffic continues for the given session. The proxy switch 300<br>
thereafter maintains the FSN, BSN numbers as described above. Any COO messages<br>
from BS 107 are then intercepted and a COA is generated and sent to the BS, while<br>
maintaining the FSN and BSN counters.<br>
Any COO messages from the MSC 110 are intercepted 850 and checked to see if<br>
they indicate that the MSC is again ready to receive traffic on the previously down link,<br>
i.e., to see if the COO is a changeback message. If there is such a message, the proxy<br>
switch interprets this to mean that the MSC can again handle a higher level of traffic and<br>
will take actions to "reconnect" the siphoned links and traffic. (If the COO is not a<br><br>
changeback message, it may be yet another changeover message indicatingra context that<br>
may benefit from further siphoning of traffic.)<br>
If there is a changeback message, a new COO is generated 855 with modified<br>
BSNs and sent 860 to the BS 107. The modified BSN are the ones maintained by the<br>
proxy as discussed above. The proxy switch 300 then waits for and receives a CO A<br>
message 865 from the BS 107. A new COA message is then generated 870 with<br>
modified BSN numbers and sent 875 to the MSC 110. The proxy switch then<br>
discontinues the traffic siphoning procedure. The control plane instructs the data plane<br>
accordingly.<br>
Under certain embodiments, the decision to siphon traffic may include the other<br>
considerations. For example, the alternative network may provide QoS guarantees that<br>
may be considered by the proxy switch logic. In one embodiment, siphoning is only at<br>
session boundaries. Accordingly, if a call is to be siphoned, it is siphoned at call<br>
origination.<br>
The description above was premised on the COO being sent as indicative of<br>
network congestion. Under one embodiment of the invention, the logic described above<br>
for automatic siphoning is supplemented with the fault management logic described in<br>
relation to figures 7a-b. In this embodiment, every time that the proxy switch 300 gets a<br>
COO from the MSC it performs the replay logic discussed above. COO messages from<br>
the BS, however, are always treated as a break in the signaling link, and replay logic is<br>
performed but no siphoning.<br>
Procedure for Presenting Point Codes Across BSC and MSC<br>
In SS7 networks, all network components are addressed by unique numbers<br>
called "point codes." Consequently, all the BSCs and MSCs will have unique point<br>
codes. A message from a BSC to an MSC will, in general, contain a destination point<br>
code, e.g., the point code of the intended MSC, and an originating point code, e.g., the<br>
point code of the BSC that sourced the message.<br><br>
Messages from the BSC to the MSC, for calls originating from the MS,<br>
additionally request a bearer circuit to be assigned for the call. Bearer circuits (which<br>
carry voice or data) are identified by Circuit Identification Codes (CIC).<br>
To support transparent operation by the proxy switch, the point codes and CICs<br>
traveling between the BSC and MSC are preserved for all messages. This requirement is<br>
complicated by the fact that while some of the circuits carrying bearer traffic will<br>
transparently traverse from the BSC to the MSC, other circuits emanating from the BSC<br>
will be terminated at the proxy switch, and the MSC will be unaware of such<br>
terminations.<br>
As stated above, some trunks 308 are pre-provisioned for direct connection<br>
between the BS and MSC, whereas other trunks 312 connect to the proxy switch.<br>
Analogously, under preferred embodiments, some bearer circuits are pre-provisioned for<br>
direct connection between the BS and the MSC ("pass through circuits"), and the<br>
remaining circuits are terminated at the proxy switch ("siphonable circuits").<br>
Under one embodiment, under normal operation, the MSC may not assign the<br>
siphonable circuits for any calls. When siphoning traffic (as described above), the proxy<br>
switch may assign a siphonable circuit for a call from the BS (by communicating the<br>
appropriate CIC to the BS), and the BS will respond by sending the voice or data on that<br>
circuit. As will be explained below, the voice or data may then be read from this circuit<br>
and passed on to an alternative network, accordingly via DACS 402.<br>
To ensure the consistency of information at the MSC in the event of a proxy<br>
switch failure, under one embodiment of the invention, a network management system<br>
accesses the CIC database at the MSC and marks the siphonable circuits as available. As<br>
a result of such action, the MSC will think that these circuits are available to be<br>
allocated, and the network will behave like a conventional mobile network (i.e., one<br>
lacking a proxy switch).<br>
When the proxy switch recovers, the network management system again accesses:<br>
the CIC database at the MSC, but this time marks the siphonable circuits as<br>
"unavailable". It also accesses the proxy switch database and marks the siphonable<br>
circuits as "available". These circuits will then be assignable by the proxy switch as<br><br>
described above. Under some embodiments, the siphonable circuits may be-marked<br>
"unavailable" at the MSC and "available" at the proxy switch in a gradual manner so that<br>
the proxy switch gradually gains control over more of the siphonable circuits.<br>
To handle the deployment of figure 3B, the techniques described above need to<br>
be supplemented. In particular, to handle the deployment of figure 3B, the proxy switch<br>
needs to intercept messages from the BS and change point codes to reflect a re-mapped<br>
MSC. Under one embodiment, this is done at a session-level of granularity, meaning<br>
that the re-mapping to a new MSC may be determined at session boundaries.<br>
Alternatively, the re-mapping may be done at other levels of granularity, for example,<br>
when a MS is turned on. Some embodiments perform the mapping by correlating<br>
equipment serial numbers (e.g., included in messages when a MS is turnedon) to MSCs<br>
and their corresponding point codes.<br>
Hardware Architecture<br>
Referring conjointly to figures 3 and 4, preferred embodiments of the proxy<br>
switch 300 include a control plane 302 and a data plane 304. The control plane includes<br>
a combination of processing hardware and associated software. The data plane largely<br>
comprises hardware that is responsive to commands from the control plane.<br>
The control plane includes programmable signaling cards (e.g., PMC 8260<br>
available from Force Systems) to receive the signaling information from the signaling<br>
links 312, 314 and to perform the initial processing thereof. This initial processing<br>
includes sending and terminating information on the signaling links and extracting, under<br>
programmatic control, the message information contained in the signaling messages.<br>
Once the message information is collected, the signaling cards cause the message<br>
information to be passed to a programmable processor card (e.g., RPC 3305 and 3306<br>
available from Radisys) which is then responsible for carrying out the functionality of<br>
the proxy switch in response thereto as described above.<br>
The control plane is constructed with passive fault tolerance mechanisms. Those<br>
mechanisms ensure that on catastrophic failures of the control plane, the signaling links<br>
received by one side of the control plane will bypass to the other side. Thus, if the<br><br>
control plane fails the links are bypassed across the control plane and the RSC and MSC<br>
may communicate as they do conventionally.<br>
The data plane 304 of an exemplary embodiment is shown in figure 4. It includes<br>
a DACS 402, a Voice over IP assembly 404, a Data termination module 406 (e.g., to<br>
terminate A5 data in CDMA networks), a PPP relay assembly 408, and a PPP<br>
termination assembly 410. The various assemblies may be packaged on one or more<br>
modules.<br>
The DACS 402 receives the bearer circuits of trunks 306 and terminates the<br>
information received on the trunks; it also transmits voice and data on those trunks. Pre-<br>
provisioned ports for the DACS 402 are connected to VoIP 404 and the Data termination<br>
assembly 408. The Data termination assembly 408, in turn, is connected to the PPP<br>
Relay 408, which in turn is in communication with the PPP termination assembly 410.<br>
Moreover, the data plane may also be used to connect to alternative circuit-based<br>
networks, e.g., to backhaul traffic to a circuit-MSC in another regional network.<br>
All of the data plane entities receive control commands from the control plane<br>
302 via control channels 401 which is used to carry information according to H.248 or<br>
Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP). The control channel, among other tilings, is<br>
used to inform the DACS 402 how to provision the bearer circuits. For example, a given<br>
input circuit from the BS 107 is mapped to an output port to one of the assemblies. The<br>
control channel is also used to convey control information to the various assemblies.<br>
For example, the signaling information contains control information such as destination<br>
IP addresses that may be used to create destination addresses needed by the VoIP<br>
assembly. This information will then be used by the VoIP assembly to deliver the voice<br>
information received from the DACS by packetizing the information accordingly and<br>
sending it according to the appropriate protocols, e.g. RTP/UDP/IP.<br>
The data plane is constructed with passive fault tolerance mechanisms. These<br>
mechanisms ensure that on failures of the data plane, the trunks received by one side of<br>
the DACS will bypass to output trunks connected to the MSC. Thus, if the data plane<br>
fails the trunks are bypassed across the data plane and the BSC and MSC may<br>
communicate as they do conventionally.<br><br>
Software Architecture<br>
Referring jointly to figures 9-10, under a preferred embodiment, the control plane<br>
software executes session manager processes and communication processes. The session<br>
manager processes include a Proxy Session Manager (PSM) 904 and a Core Session<br>
Manager (CSM) 1002. The communication processes include SS7 Message Handler<br>
(SS7MsgHdlr) 902 a-n and IP Message Handler (IPMsgHdlr) 906 a-n. As the names<br>
suggest, the session managers include logic for managing and handling call sessions,<br>
whereas, the message handlers include logic for handling messages. The message<br>
handlers encapsulate the logic for handling messages so that other software does not<br>
need to know the message handling particulars. Similarly, the session managers<br>
encapsulate the logic for handling sessions, so that other software such as the message<br>
handlers do not need to know session state or the like.<br>
The SS7MsgHdlr and IPMsgHdlr processes are responsible for accepting<br>
incoming messages and sending outgoing messages. The former accepts and sends<br>
signaling messages from and to the MSC 110 and/or the BS 107. The latter SS7MsgHdlr<br>
and IPMsgHdlr accepts and sends control messages to the data plane. The PSM process<br>
904 handles all calls or sessions that are "flow through" calls, or non-siphoned calls. The<br>
CSM process 1002 handles all the calls or sessions that are being siphoned off by the<br>
proxy switch 300. As such, the CSM process 1002 provides much of the same<br>
functionality as the circuit-MSC and a BS in the sense that it responds like an MSC to<br>
messages from the BS, and responds to messages from the MS as if it were a BS. In<br>
general there are multiple PSM and CSM processes running simultaneously on various<br>
processor cards to provide the necessary scalability and performance. Additional<br>
software processes are provided for failover and reliability. These in our diagrams are<br>
referred to as PSM' 904' and CSM' 1002'. The purpose of these "prime" processes is to<br>
provide failover for other PSM and CSM processes. In one embodiment, each PSM and<br>
CSM has a "shadow" PSM7CSM' process providing "shadow" coverage. In case a PSM<br>
or CSM process fails, the corresponding shadow PSM7CSM' process is designed to<br>
takeover from the failed process.<br>
Referring to figure 9, as signaling messages arrive from the BSC and MSC, they<br>
are handled by a SS7MsgHdlr 902a-n, which executes on the SS7 processing card.<br><br>
There is one SS7MsgHdlr associated with each signaling link to or from the proxy<br>
switch. The SS7 processing cards (mentioned above) extract sufficient information from<br>
the signaling message to identify a corresponding SS7MsgHdldlr to which the signaling<br>
message is passed.<br>
The SS7MsgHdlr receives the messages and assigns a (preferably) unique logical<br>
reference number to this message. This reference number is used later to identify<br>
subsequent messages that pertain to the same ongoing call/session. The assigned logical<br>
reference number is communicated back to the software system running in the BS or<br>
MSC (e.g., the SCCP protocol stack) which then uses that reference number in all<br>
subsequent messages pertaining to this call/session.<br>
After the above processing, the SS7MsgHdlr 902 then selects a PSM 904 to<br>
handle the message. In one embodiment, the SS7MsgHdlr examines the point code of<br>
the message originator and selects a PSM that is associated with that code. For example,<br>
a table may be used to store such relationships.<br>
The PSM 904 then determines if this message is for a call/session that is to be<br>
siphoned. In one embodiment, this determination is made by examining the service<br>
option field contained in the message that distinguishes between data sessions and voice<br>
calls. In another embodiment, this determination is made by examining the calling and<br>
called party numbers to ascertain if both are mobile phone numbers. In yet another<br>
embodiment, this determination is made by examining the calling party number to<br>
determine if the calling party has chosen a VoIP service provider. Once the<br>
determination is made to siphon this call/session, the PSM 904 passes the message to the<br>
CSM 1002. If a determination is made not to siphon this call/session, the PSM generates<br>
a message that is used to send back to the MSC or the BS via the SS7MsgHdlr processes.<br>
The PSM processes 904 may also communicate via an internal protocol to the<br>
CSM processes 1002, see, e.g., figure 10. The internal protocol of a preferred<br>
embodiment is stateless and text based. As stated above, the PSM deals with those<br>
sessions/calls that are non-siphonable. Once it encounters a session/call that is<br>
siphonable it passes the context of that session/call to a CSM process. The CSM process<br>
is responsible for handling all calls/sessions that are siphoned. The CSM communicates<br><br>
with the Data Plane via standard control protocols such as H.248 and MGCP (Media<br>
Gateway Control Protocol).<br>
The internal architecture of the PSM and CSM processes is similar. Referring to<br>
figure 11, incoming messages are received by the network interface module 1102. The<br>
network interface module then sends the message to the protocol engine 1104. For<br>
example, this engine 1104, under CDMA embodiments, is responsible for encoding and<br>
decoding messages according to the IS-634 protocol. The state machine module 1106 is<br>
responsible for handling the message and recording the state according to the protocol.<br>
For example, under a given protocol, a given message signifies a known state transition<br>
under that protocol. The state machine module 1106 includes the logic for recording the<br>
state and implementing the state transitions.<br>
The active directory module 1108 interacts with the external mobility<br>
management functions of the MSC and is responsible for obtaining and updating<br>
subscriber profiles and other user/subscriber data. In a traditional MSC, the Visiting<br>
Location Register (VLR) is typically co-located with the MSC; the VLR contains the<br>
subscriber information (profiles) that are currently roaming within the area covered by<br>
the MSC. Additionally, the MSC is connected to another database, called the Home<br>
Location Register (HLR) that contains all the subscribers who are "homed" in the current<br>
network. Typically, as a subscriber roams and enters an area covered by the MSC, the<br>
MSC requests the HLR to send the profile of the subscriber and stores it in the (local)<br>
VLR. When the subscriber roams out of the area covered by the MSC (to an area covered<br>
by another MSC), this subscriber profile is deleted. The active directory module in the<br>
proxy switch acts as a client of the HLR database, requests subscriber profiles from the<br>
HLR for subscribers who roam into the area covered by the proxy switch, and updates<br>
the local database, i.e., the active directory module and its associated database act/behave<br>
as a traditional VLR for roaming subscribers.)<br>
The media gateway controller (MGC) module 1110 interacts with the data plane<br>
304 of the proxy switch via open control protocols, such as H.248 and MGCP. Upon<br>
receiving an action request from the IS-634 state machine module 1106, the MGC 1110<br>
sends a message in H.248 or MGCP protocol to the data plane 304 to carry out the<br>
needed actions. In one embodiment, the so-called TDM-VoIP case, these action<br><br>
messages from the MGC 1110 to the data plane instruct the data plane to receive<br>
incoming circuit (TDM) traffic at an ingress port and to convert it into RTP/UDP/IP<br>
packets and send it out from one of the egress ports. Thus, in this embodiment, incoming<br>
circuit traffic is packetized and sent out as packets. This embodiment could be used for<br>
taking circuit calls, and transporting them as Voice over IP (VoIP) calls. In another<br>
embodiment, the so-called TDM-TDM case, the MGC 1110 instructs the data plane 304<br>
to receive incoming circuit (TDM) traffic at an ingress port and switch as circuit (TDM)<br>
traffic out of an egress port. In this case, incoming circuit traffic is preserved as circuit<br>
and switched to an alternative circuit network.<br>
Figures 12-14 are used to illustrate the above concepts with simplified<br>
architectural diagrams. The figures are used to show the various interactions of the<br>
software processes in response to signaling messages. Bearer circuits are excluded from<br>
some of the figures for the sake of simplicity. Moreover, only single instances of the<br>
PSM and CSM processes are shown for the sake of simplicity.<br>
Figure 12 is used to show the control flow when a new call message is initiated<br>
from the BS 107 to the MSC 110, and to show a "Pass through call." A pass through call<br>
is a call in which the proxy switch 300 is not responsible for managing the call and in<br>
which the call is to be passed through for handling by the MSC 110. The proxy switch<br>
300 is transparent for purposes of this call (though it may alter point codes, for example,<br>
to handle re-mapping of MSCs as explained with reference to figure 3B). The BS 107<br>
sends 1205 a service request (such as a CSR) which is intended for the MSC 110. The<br>
service request contains a service option field that specifies whether this is a request for a<br>
voice call or a data call. The proxy switch receives this message (since it is in the<br>
signaling path between the BSC and the MSC); in particular, the SS7MsgHdlr process<br>
902 receives the call, assigns a unique local reference number to this message (this is the<br>
initial message for a potentially ongoing call request), and routes 1210 it to the PSM<br>
process 904 for further processing. The PSM process 904 decodes the incoming message<br>
and using the IS-634 state machine (for CDMA embodiments) determines whether this<br>
call is to be siphoned (e.g., to an alternative network) or allowed to be handled by the<br>
MSC 110. Since in this example the call is not to be siphoned, the message is encoded<br>
and sent back 1215 to the SS7MsgHdlr process 902. In one embodiment, the<br>
comrninication protocol between the SS7MsgHdlr and PSM processes is a stateless text-<br><br>
based protocol that provides a Level of abstraction (relative to session logic}'of the<br>
underlying signaling protocol. The SS7MsgHdlr process 902 then re-transmits 1220 the<br>
IS-634 message to the MSC 110. The MSC processes this message and responds 1225.<br>
This response is also received by the proxy switch 300 but since this response is related<br>
to an on-going but non-siphonable call (as determined from the local reference number<br>
assigned to the initial CSR request message explained above), the SS7MsgHdlr process<br>
902 does not forward this message to the PSM 904. Instead, the SSlMsgHdk sends<br>
1230 this message transparently onward to the BS 107. All further exchanges relating to<br>
this call are allowed to transparently pass between the BS and the MSC except for a Call<br>
Release message at the conclusion of the call. In response to a Call Release, the proxy<br>
switch 300 ensures that the "tear down" of the call happens including the disposition of<br>
the local reference number. The call release message is also sent to the BS 107 by the<br>
proxy switch so that the BS can proceed with its tear down processes.<br>
Figure 13 is used to show the case of a call message initiated by the BS 107 to the<br>
MSC 110 and also used to show proxy trunks, i.e., trunks that are controlled and<br>
assigned by the MSC 110. The BS 107 sends 1305 a service request intended for the<br>
MSC 110. The proxy switch receives this message and the SS7MsgHdlr process 902<br>
receives the call, assigns a unique local reference number to this message, and routes<br>
1310 it to the PSM process 904 for further processing. The PSM process 904 decodes the<br>
incoming message and determines whether this call is to be siphoned (e.g., to an<br>
alternative network) or allowed to be handled by the MSC 110. Since in this example the<br>
call is not to be siphoned, the message is encoded and sent back 1315 to the SS7MsgHdlr<br>
process 902. The SS7MsgHdlr process 902 then re-transmits 1320 the message to the<br>
MSC 110. The MSC 110 responds 1325 to the call set up request by assigning a channel<br>
to the call (as described above). This channel assignment is received by the proxy switch<br>
300 which passes 1330 the assignment to the PSM 904, which in turn responds 1335 that<br>
is has recorded this assignment 1330. The proxy switch then transmits 1340 the channel<br>
assignment request onwards to the BS 107. All further exchanges relating to this call<br>
between the BSC and the MSC are allowed to transparently pass through the proxy<br>
switch until the cail release message. The call release triggers the tear down processes in<br>
the proxy switch.<br><br>
Figure 14 is used to show the case of a "siphoned call." A siphoned: call is a call<br>
initiated by the BS 107 that is intercepted and re-directed to an alternative network by the<br>
proxy switch. In such an example, all signaling is to be handled by the proxy switch and<br>
the trunks carrying user traffic are to be controlled by the proxy switch. The BS 107<br>
sends 1405 a service request intended for the MSC 110. The proxy switch receives this<br>
message and assigns a unique local reference number to this message, and routes 1410 it<br>
to the PSM process 904 for further processing. The PSM process 904 decodes the<br>
incoming message and using the IS-634 state machine (for CDMA embodiments)<br>
determines that the call is to siphoned. Since in this example the call is to be siphoned to<br>
an alternative network, the PSM transmits 1415 the message to the CSM process 1002.<br>
The CSM process 1002 now starts to behave like a conventional MSC and issues 1420 a<br>
channel assignment for this call, assigning a trunk between the BS and the data plane of<br>
the proxy switch. The channel assignment is then sent 1435 to the SS7MsgHdIr. The<br>
SS7MsgHdlr process transmits 1430 this channel assignment information to the BS so<br>
that the BS may use it for user traffic. The CSM also sends a message to the data plane<br>
of the proxy switch (as described above using H.248 or MGCP protocols) directing it to<br>
receive incoming user traffic on the assigned channel and directing it to an alternative<br>
network. As explained above, in one embodiment the alternative network may be an IP<br>
network. All further exchanges occur between the BSC and CSM process until the call<br>
release command is issued by the MSC causing a release of resources (the tear down<br>
process).<br>
In another embodiment, the software architecture may use only a single process<br>
for carrying out the proxy functions rather than using two different processes (PSM and<br>
CSM)..In such an embodiment, the PSM process alone detennines, as before, if a call is<br>
to be siphoned or not. If it is not a siphonable call, it is allowed to proceed to the MSC. If<br>
it is a siphonable call, the PSM itself handles the call and sends and accepts messages<br>
from the BS 107 and the MSC 110. In other words, the PSM in such an embodiment acts<br>
like an MSC and BS 107 and handles all the signaling messages in this regard. As such,<br>
the PSM process provides much of the same functionality as the circuit-MSC and a BS<br>
107 in the sense that it responds like an MSC to messages from the BS 107, and responds<br>
to messages from the MS as if it were a BS 107. In general there are multiple PSM<br>
processes running simultaneously on various processor cards to provide the necessary<br><br>
scalability and performance. Additional software processes are provided for failover and<br>
reliability. The purpose of these processes is to provide failover for other PSM processes.<br>
In one embodiment, each PSM has a "shadow" process providing "shadow" coverage. In<br>
case a PSM process fails, the corresponding shadow process is designed to takeover from<br>
the failed process.<br>
Variations<br>
The above embodiments ail facilitate the realization of a transparent switch.<br>
Subsets of the functionality, however, still provide advantages over the state of the art.<br>
For example, a switch that is partly visible to the network may still offer many of the<br>
advantages discussed above.<br>
In addition, the embodiments were described in part with relation to CDMA<br>
protocols, but the embodiments may also be modified to work with GSM, IS-136 and/or<br>
other2G and 3G protocols.<br>
The connection of trunks from proxy switch to MSC is optional.<br>
