				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Lubricant and use of the lubricant<br>
The invention concerns a lubricant and a use of the lubricant.<br>
Greases are widely used in lubrication of bearings and other structural components. An effect called false brinelling occurs in the circumstances with relatively small displacements between rolling parts and the raceway of the bearing rings, whereby false brinelling is found in incomplete contacts. Further an effect called fretting is found in complete contacts, e.g. fretting relates to bearing seat interfaces of which the mating surfaces are oscillating at small amplitudes. False brinelling and fretting can result in considerable damage. Up to now commercial available and used lubrication greases particularly in rolling bearings are lacking in protection false brinelling and fretting.<br>
So one problem of the invention is it to create a better lubricant which also offers a good protection concerning false brinelling and fretting.<br>
The problem is solved by the subject of claim 1. Advantageous embodiments are described in the dependent claims.<br>
Thereby the invention is based on the cognition, that grease lubrication functions well at relatively large amplitude oscillations. At smaller displacement amplitudes greases face severe difficulties to provide proper lubrication to the mating surfaces. It has been found that e.g. the phosphate coating is not sufficient for preventing false brinelling. Thereby adhesion of phosphates is insufficient resulting in premature removal from the rolling bearing component. So the phosphate layer will simply be wiped away during the first oscillations and after that there is no lubrication to pre-vent damage to the related parts. The phosphate layer with grease lubrication will not offer<br>
sufficient protection against false brinelling especially not in the so-called partial slip regime.<br>
The subject of the invention provides a lubricant having besides well-performing properties in conventional bearing operation (over rolling) also excellent anti-false brinelling properties and also protects mating components against fretting and fretting corrosion. The lubricant releases very quickly the curing elements against false brinelling and fretting and is providing simultaneously a physical and chemical interaction with the mating surface (s) actually providing proper lubrication against fretting and false brinelling. The lubricant has besides these unique capabilities also a long lasting bearing grease life according to industrial standards. Greases are widely applied to the contact between rolling elements and bearing raceways and bearing cages to provide long lasting lubrication. Up to now commercially available greases have besides long grease life not the capability to lubricate small oscillating contacts.<br>
Because of the excellent lubricating properties of the lubricant according to the invention, the grease functions properly at small and large amplitudes i.e. displacements. According to the invention the grease or paste - a paste comprises a base oil and a thickener like a grease, but has no structure -applied on one of the bearing component surfaces or any other surfaces of structural components like e.g. gears, has excellent lubricating properties even in harsh conditions as found in fretting and false brinelling. In contrast thereto other means of lubrication, coatings, pastes, oils or greases only offer little protection against false brinelling.<br>
The subject of the invention in the form of a paste applied at the bearing seat contacts, ring-on-axle, ring-in-housing, side faces of the bearing rings etc., has excellent lubricating properties in fretting conditions. In contrast thereto other means of lubrication, coatings, pastes, oils or greases only offer little protection against fretting the mating structural surfaces.The lubricant according to claim 1 protects bearing surfaces during the first oscillations and the lubricant in form of a grease for false brinelling and/or in form of a grease or paste for fretting offers continuous low friction.<br>
Further advantages, features and details of the invention are described in the following on the basis of preferred embodiments of the invention in connection with the Figures . Thereby the Figures show:<br>
Figure 1 a diagram of different contact conditions between two mating elements,<br>
Figure 2a a specific shape of a fretting loop for a partial slip regime and a corresponding wear mark concerning a ball-on-flat contact configuration,<br>
Figure 2b a specific shape of a fretting loop for a gross slip regime and a corresponding wear mark concerning a ball-on-flat contact configuration,<br>
Figure 3 fretting loops as function of oscillating cycles,<br>
Figure 4 a fretting loop illustrating a definition of a dimensionless fretting regime parameter,<br>
Figure 5 test results obtained in false brinelling conditions with a commercially available grease,<br>
Figure 6 a produced damaged surface according to Figure 5, Figure 7 a protective layer of a lubricant according to the invention between two structural components,<br>
Figure 8 a result obtained in false brinelling with subject invention grease or paste.Figure 1 shows different contact conditions e.g. between a rolling element and its bearing ring. Thereby the stress distribution for the rolling element on the bearing ring is characterized by a maximum pressure in the center of the contact of the two mating components. The friction will thus be highest in the center of the contact and will decrease towards the outer contact region where the pressure is reduced.<br>
In Figure 1 the horizontal axis indicates a displacement in urn and the vertical axis a wear. A first contact condition is the so-called sticking regime Rl. Thereby at even smaller displacement amplitudes (very small tangential forces relatively to the normal loads) the contact is accommodated fully by elastic deformation over the whole contact area and no slip is occurring.<br>
Next to the regime Rl the so-called partial slip regime or stick-slip regime R2 follows. Introducing a tangential force will show a maximum shear stress at the outer annular region and minimum shear stresses at the center of the contact. Slip will occur when the shear force is able to overcome the frictional force, and obviously this will occur first in the outer region of the contact. The high contact pressure in the center of the contact and consequently the high friction prevents slip when the tangential force is limited. Therefore sticking occurs in the center of the contact and slip occurs in the outer region. In the partial slip regime R2 some of the energy is dissipated through sliding and a part by elastic and plastic deformation of the asperities and the mating materials . Then a so-called gross slip regime R3 follows, which is characterized by slip over the whole contact area. When the tangential force is increased in the partial slip regime R2 (at increasing displacement amplitude) , the stick circle decreases to zero in size and at this point the condition of partial slip transforms into gross slip. Last but not least the gross slip regime R3 passes into the so-called reciprocating sliding regime R4.<br>
A wear mechanism occurring between two mating surfaces at small amplitude oscillating motions is called fretting. Fretting corrosion or damage occurring to the contacting surfaces between the rolling elements and the bearing ring are called false brinelling. Therefore, the terminology false brinelling is only used for rolling elements experiencing small oscillating movements relatively to the bearing rings. The terminology fretting is used for all kinds of contact configurations like those found in false brinelling and flat-on-flat contacts or bearing seats. Common oscillating amplitudes in false brinelling and fretting are less then 100 urn. In false brinelling of such small displacements the rolling motion is not always ensured and displacement can be based on sticking elastic and plastic deformation at the contact with or without slip and/or sliding. Generally three kinds of fretting and false brinelling can be distinguished: Sticking, partial slip and gross slip regime Rl, R2 and R3 as described above.<br>
Further in Figure 1 an arrow RF marks the fretting region that has been the problematic region for commercially available greases and is also the region wherein the grease according to the invention brings great advantages . As Figure 1 is indicating said region covers not only the partial slip regime R2 but also part of the gross slip regime R3. So in view of the Figure 1 said region can be expressed in a maximum wear rate value. There are various other ways possible to describe said region, whereby dimensionless fretting regime parameter, energy parameter, contact area parameter and/or a displacement parameter can be used. In a more general way said region can also be specified in terms of oscillating amplitude.<br>
In another terminology tribological contacts are frequently described by the terminologies "complete and incomplete" contacts. An incomplete contact refers to mating surfaces of which the contact area increases with increasing contact load, i.e. the contact area dimension is dependent on the load level. A false brinelling contact, rolling element on bearing raceway, is an example of an incomplete contact. The contact area is constant in case of complete contacts independent of contact load. A bearing seat contact is an example of a complete contact. Subject invention protects any mating surfaces from fretting and false brinelling in incomplete and complete contacts for relatively partial and gross slip conditions, whereby their appearance is promoted in connection with loose fit or interference fit bearing seats. Anti-fretting pastes are used in various applications as a low cost solution to resist fretting at bearings seats. Some pastes have not satisfying resistance to fretting and the conditions found at bearing seats. The performance of pastes is limited in partial slip conditions at bearing seats.<br>
Figure 2a shows a specific shape of a fretting loop for a partial slip regime R2 and a corresponding wear mark concerning a ball-on-flat contact configuration. In general fretting loops are used to determine the fretting regime for specific contact conditions giving a deep understanding of the failure mode and material response to the applied conditions. Fretting loops are representations of tangential force FT versus displacement amplitude [Delta]a as the case may be as function of time. Thereby in Figure 2a the horizontal axis indicates the displacement amplitude [Deltaja and the vertical axis the tangential force FT, whereby no time dependency is included. The partial slip regime R2 can be identified by a nearly closed loop as shown in the graph of Figure 2a and by the typical contact area having an outer slip circle and an inner sticking area as shown in the picture of Figure 2a.<br>
Figure 2b shows a specific shape of a fretting loop for a gross slip regime R3 and a corresponding wear mark. Otherwise the description concerning Figure 2a applies in a similar way. The gross slip regime R3 is identified by an open loop as shown in the graph of Figure 2b and by slip over the whole contact area as shown in the picture of Figure 2b. Just as a note in the margin the same philosophy can be applied for other contact configurations like ball-on-ring, roller-on-ring, flat on flat, bearing seats etc.<br>
Figure 3 shows fretting loops as function of oscillating cycles OC from left to right for a partial slip regime R2, a mixed slip regime and a gross slip regime R3. So Figure 3 shows a development of a fretting contact as a function of time namely said cycles OC. Figure 4 shows a fretting loop illustrating the definition of said dimensionless fretting regime parameter Z, which is independent of the type of regime and is the quotient (Z=X/Y) of the two displacement ranges X and Y. Thereby a zero value of Z represents a pure elastic sticking regime Rl and a unity value represents full sliding without sticking.<br>
Figure 5 shows test results obtained in false brinelling conditions with a commercially available grease. Thereby a bearing rolling element was oscillated in contact with a fixed flat bearing steel surface. The test has been performed under constant actuating force and constant frequency. Thereby the test results were obtained in false brinelling conditions at 1 GPa, 20 Hz and amplitude of 20 μm. The horizontal axis indicates the number of fretting cycles. Thereby curve 10 indicates the wear, curve 20 the displacement and curve 30 the friction coefficient. The rising of the wear and the friction coefficient curve indicates a bad performance and a quick incidence of a failure. Figure 6 shows a damaged surface according to Figure 5.<br>
Figure 7 shows as one structural component 2 one half of a rolling element and as a second structural component 4 a raceway for said rolling element. Further there is a grease 6 present forming a protective layer 7 during oscillating motions locally between the mating surfaces of the rolling element and the raceway. Thereby the grease 6 modifies the surface of the structural components 2 and 4 comprising a reaction product wherein said product has been provided by chemical reaction between said grease 6 and the structural components 2 and 4, so that said product has lubricating properties from at least -40C to + 200C. Further the grease 6 or more precisely said product forms a lubricating layer 7 producing on top of the mating surface (s) a coating having a thickness of less than 5 urn and in particular less than 2 urn, and more particular about 1 μm. By choosing such thickness the internal bearing clearance is not affected.<br>
Figure 8 shows test results obtained in false brinelling with subject invention grease or paste. Thereby a bearing rolling element was oscillated in contact with a fixed flat bearing steel surface. The test has been performed under constant actuating force and constant frequency. Thereby the test results were obtained in false brinelling conditions at 1 GPa, 20 Hz and amplitude of 20 urn. Similar as in Figure 5 the horizontal axis indicates the number of fretting cycles. Thereby curve 10' indicates the wear, curve 20' the displacement and curve 30' the friction coefficient. In contrast to Figure 5 the constant wear and the friction coefficient indicates an excellent performance. So the rapid increase in friction of Figure 5 in the partial slip regime is prevented.
