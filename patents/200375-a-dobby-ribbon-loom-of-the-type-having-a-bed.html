				<td>The present invention relates to a dobby ribbon loom and, more particularly, to a dobby ribbon loom in which transmission of power to a dobby head is simplified and in which weft feeders can be threaded with weft yams easily. 2. Description of Related Art<br>
Various dobby webbing looms are known, and each of them typically includes an inverted U-shaped top castle for supporting a dobby head thereon. The castle has two spaced legs, between which a weft feeder is arranged horizontally as well as connected to the legs.<br>
The dobby head is on a central top of the castle, and so it is necessary to transmit power to the dobby head from a main motor below along a tortuous path, to be precious, along one of the legs and then a head beam of the top castle. The long, tortuous transmission makes the mechanisms of the whole loom complex, in addition to the increase in consumption of energy on the way to the dobby head.<br>
Furthermore, the weft feeder between the two legs of the top castle is not easy to be threaded with weft yams, for the legs will shut out the feeder partially or wholly from view of the operator(s) who is/are passing the yams through the feeder.<br>
Therefore, it is an objective of the invention to provide a dobby ribbon loom to mitigate and/or obviate the aforementioned problems.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a dobby ribbon loom in which transmission of power to a dobby head is simplified.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a dobby ribbon loom in which weft feeders can be threaded with weft yams easily.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a dobby ribbon loom of the type having a bed, a plurality of heddle frames movable up and down on said bed, and a dobby head situated over said heddle frames, the improvement comprising: a column standing on a top of said bed for supporting said dobby head; a power transfer supported on said column, said power transfer having a main pulley-belt running along a fiiU length of said column; and a pair of weft feeders extending weft wise from said column symmetrically such that power transmission to the dobby head is simplified and the weft yams are threaded to the weft feeders easily.<br>
Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective right view of a preferred embodiment of a dobby ribbon loom in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is an enlarged perspective left view showing a column included in the inventive loom of Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 3 is an enlarged perspective right view showing the column of Fig. 2.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a preferred embodiment of a dobby ribbon loom in accordance with the present invention. The ribbon loom includes a boxlike bed (10), a weft insertion device (12) on a front top of the bed (10), a yam guide (14) on a rear top of the bed (10), and a rack (16) between the device (12) and the yam guide (14). The rack (16) is provided for guiding a plurality of heddle frames (not shown), which are each movable up and down on the bed (10).<br>
In the inventive loom, a column (20) stands on a central top of the bed (10) for<br>
supporting a dobby head (42) and a power transfer (50). The column (20) is preferably<br>
formed with a top deck (40) which supports the dobby head (42) and the power   	<br><br>
transfer (50) in such a manner that the dobby head (42) is situated just over the heddle frames to control their movement correctly. Furthermore, the column (20) is dimensioned to be longer in a warpwise direction than in a weftwise direction, so as to occupy less space in the weftwise direction while having sufficient strength.<br>
The loom fiirther includes a pair of weft feeders (60), each extending weftwise from the column (20) symmetrically. Being supported by the column (20), the feeders (60) are arranged in the open air rather than confined in an outside castle as in the prior art. This arrangement of the feeders (60) in the open air results in an easy operation during its process of being threaded with weft yams in that the operator is able to have easy access to the feeders (60) and thus threading the weft yams on the feeders (60) is easy.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the column (20) is formed with a base plate (22) fastened to the central top of the bed (20), with a plurality of reinforcements (24) arranged at an intersection of the colvimn (20) and the plate (22). Preferably, the column (20) is hollow, i.e. it defines an inside channel (26) therein, thereby allowing a main pulley-belt (30) of the power transfer (50) to run within the channel (26) along a Ml length of the column (20).<br>
As illustrated, the column (20) is preferably made of a channel bar covered with a rear cover (28). The cover (28) is normally shut to protect the main pulley-belt (30) but can be opened when the belt (30) is to be replaced by a new one.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the column (20) additionally has a front connector (200) for securing the rack (16) in its place, as best shown in Fig. 1, and a rear holder (202) for rotatably supporting a horizontal common shaft (62) of the two weft feeders (60). The rear holder (202) may also be used to support a shaft (not numbered) of a ground-yamfeeder (not shown), in order to provide the loom with an improved fimction.<br>
The power transfer (50) includes an angle-drive gearing (52) for transmitting power to the dobby head (42) and a wheel train (54) for transmitting power to the common shaft (62) of the weft feeders (60). For example, the wheel train (54) may be provided with two pulley wheels (542, 544) (one is shown in Fig. 3 but the other in Fig. -<br><br>
2) coupled to a spindle (540) that is rotatably supported on the column (20). It is through these pulley wheels (542, 544) that power can be transmitted to the shaft (62) of the weft feeders (60), as shown both in Fig. 2 and in Fig. 3.<br>
Each of the weft feeders (60) further includes a horizontal bar (640) formed with a plurality of crooked arms (64) extending therefrom. Instead of the two pulley wheels (542, 544), the horizontal bars (640) of the weft feeders (60) can be supported on the column (20) by means of being coupled to the spindle (540) or, alternatively, to another one that is supported on the column (20) in the same manner as the spindle (540) is done.<br>
From the above description, it is apparent that this invention has the following advantages:<br>
1.	simplifying transmission of power to the dobby head (42):<br>
Because the0main pulley-belt (30) runs within the central colunm (20), power can be transmitted directly to the angle-drive gearing (52) without going along a tortuous path and thus transmission of the power is significantly simplified.<br>
2.	enabling the weft feeders (60) to be threaded with weft yams easily:<br>
Because the weft feeders (60) are arranged in the open air on both sides of the<br>
column (20), the feeders (60) can be threaded with weft yams easily.<br>
It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the stmcture and fiinction of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the fiill extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the aooended claims are<br><br>
