Further, the invention is concerned with a process for the manufacture of the above compounds, pharmaceutical preparations which contain such compounds as well as the use of these compounds for the production of pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
High levels of free fatty acids (FFA) lead to an increase of liver mitochondhal p-oxidation, which is crucial to drive efficient gluconeogenesis. The mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain FFA requires the intervention of two membrane-bound carnitine-dependent palmitoyltransferases (CPTs). CPT1, the outer mitochondrial membrane enzyme, catalyzes the formation of long-chain acylcamitines. Liver (L-CPT1) and muscle (M-CPT1) CPT1 isoforms are encoded by two different genes and inhibited by malonyl-CoA. The N-ter domain of L-CPT1 confers its lower sensitivity to malonyl CoA. CPT2, the inner mitochondrial membrane enzyme, reconverts long-chain acylcamitines into long-chain acyl CoA esters. Long-chain acyl-CoAs are then p-oxidized to acetyl-CoA, which activates the pyruvate carboxylase and gluconeogenesis. According to the mechanism of action described above, pharmaceutically active substances which inhibit L-CPT1 reduce liver ^-oxidation, consequently inhibit gluconeogenesis and therefore counteract hyperglycemia.<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds which inhibit liver carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (L-CPT1) activity. The compounds of the present invention can be used as pharmaceutically active agents which are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases which are modulated by L-CPT1 inhibitors, particularly diseases which are related to hyperglycemia and/or glucose tolerance disorders. Such<br><br>
diseases include e.g. diabetes and associated pathologies, non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (also referred to as diabetes type II), obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure and renal failure<br>

2-CWoro-4-{[l-(3-fluoro-benzenesulfonyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-7-carbonyl]-amino}-benzoic acid was prepared as illustrated in schemes 5 and 7.<br>
Step	1:<br>
Lithium hydroxide monohydrate (5.42 g, 141 mmol, 3 equiv.) in water (50 ml) was added to a solution of quinoline-7-carboxylic acid methyl ester (8.8 g, 47 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (200 ml) and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The tetrahydrofuran was evaporated under reduced pressure and the solution adjusted to pH 7 with IN HC1 (aq) (141 ml), forming a white precipitate. The precipitate was filtered and washed with water and heptane. The solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C to give quinoline-7-carboxylic acid, 8.4 g (100% yield) as a<br><br>
white solid. LC @215nm; Rt 0.66: 100%, m/z (ES+): 174 (M+H+); SH (400 MHz; d6-DMSO) 9.02 (1H, dd), 8.58 (1H, s), 8.48 (1H, d), 8.09 (2H, m), 7.66 (1H, dd).<br>
Step	2:<br>
Bromo-tris-pyrrolidmo-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (6.03 g, 12.9 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) and diisopropyl ethyl amine (3.19 g, 12.9 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) were added to a solution of quinoline-7-carboxylic acid (2.03 g, 11.75 mmol) in tetrahydroftiran (100 ml) and the resultant mixture stirred for 10 minutes. 4-Amino-2-chlorobenzoic acid methyl ester (2.40 g, 12.9 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) in tetrahydrofuran (20 ml) was added and the mixture refluxed for 16 hours. Additional Bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (1.10 g, 2.36 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) and diisopropyl ethyl amine (0.61 g, 4.7 mmol, 0.4 equiv.) were added and the mixture refluxed for a further 16 hours. The mixture was evaporated then dissolved in isopropanol (100 ml). Water (5 ml) and 60% aqueous perchloric acid (0.5 ml) were added and the mixture was refluxed for 24 hours. The mixture was filtered while hot then left to cool to room temperature whereupon a crystalline solid was formed. The solid was filtered and washed with cold isopropanol (20 ml) and dichloromethane (20 ml) to give 2-chloro-4-[(quinoline-7-carbonyl)-amino]-benzoic acid methyl ester, 1.42 g (35% yield), as a tan solid. LC @215nm; Rt 1.11: 100%, m/z (ES+): 341 (M+H+); OH (400 MHz; d6-DMSO) 10.96 (1H, br.s), 9.05 (1H, m), 8.73 (1H, s), 8.49 (1H, d), 8.18-8.10 (3H, m), 7.94 (2H, s), 7.68 (1H, dd), 3.86 (3H, s).<br>
Step	3:<br>
Water (1.5 ml), 60% aqueous perchloric acid (0.01 ml) and<br>
pentamethylcycloopentadienyliridium(HI) chloride dimer) (116 mg, 0.145 mmol, 0.05<br>
equiv.) were added to 2-chloro-4-[(quinoline-7-carbonyl)-amino]-benzoic acid methyl<br>
ester (1.42 g, 4.17 mmol) in degassed isopropanol (100 ml) under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere and the mixture was refluxed for 48 hours. The mixture was evaporated to<br>
give a tan solid. The solid was purified by flash chromatography (SiCh, 1:9 terf-butyl-<br>
methyl	ether:dichloromethane	to	1:1:8	terf-butyl-methyl<br>
ether:methanol:dichloromethane). The fractions were combined to afford 2-chloro-4-[(l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-7-carbonyl)-ainino]-benzoic acid methyl ester, 0.434 g (30% yield) as a tan solid. LC @215nm; Rt 1.15: 98%, m/z (ES+): 345 (M+H+); SH (250 MHz; d6-DMSO) 10.39 (1H, br.s), 8.07 (1H, m), 7.91-7.80 (2H, m), 7.05-6.90 (3H, m), 5.95 (1H, br.s), 3.82 (3H, s), 3.19 (2H, m), 2.70 (2H, m), 1.79 (2H, m).<br>
Step	4:<br>
3-Fluorobenzenesulphonyl chloride (0.027 g, 0.137 mmol, 1.05 equiv.) was added to a mixture of 2-chloro-4-[(l,2,3)4-tetrahydro-quinoline-7-carbonyl)-amino]-benzoic<br><br>
acid methyl ester (0.045 g, 0.130 mmol) and pyridine (0.1 ml) in dichloromethane (2 ml) and the mixture shaken for 16 hours. The solution was washed with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate (2 ml) and 1M aqueous HC1 (2 ml) then dried over magnesium sulphate. The solution was evaporated to afford the crude 2-chloro-4-{[l-(3-fluoro-benzenesulfonyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-7-carbonyl]-amino}-benzoic acid methyl ester, 0.097 g, as a red oil. This material was taken onto the next step without further purification. LC @215nm; Rt 1.64: 100%, m/z (ES+): 502 (M+H).<br>
Step	5:<br>
3 M Potassium hydroxide solution (2 ml) was added to a solution of crude 2-chloro-4-{[l-(3-fluoro-benzenesulfonyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-7-carbonyl]-aniino}-benzoic acid methyl ester (0.097 g, 0.13 mmol) in MeOH (2 ml) and tetrahydrofuran (1 ml) and the mixture stirred for 16 hours. The organic solvent was evaporated and the solution neutralised with 3 M HC1 solution (3 ml) forming a white precipitate. The precipitate was filtered and washed with heptane. The solid was then dried under vacuum to give 2-chloro-4-{[l-(3-fluoro-benzenesulfonyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-7-carbonyl]-amino}-benzoic acid, 0.037 g, as a red solid.
