Further, the invention is concerned with a process for the manufacture of the above compounds, pharmaceutical preparations which contain such compounds as well as the use of these compounds for the production of pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
High levels of free fatty acids (FFA) lead to an increase of liver mitochondhal p-oxidation, which is crucial to drive efficient gluconeogenesis. The mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain FFA requires the intervention of two membrane-bound carnitine-dependent palmitoyltransferases (CPTs). CPT1, the outer mitochondrial membrane enzyme, catalyzes the formation of long-chain acylcamitines. Liver (L-CPT1) and muscle (M-CPT1) CPT1 isoforms are encoded by two different genes and inhibited by malonyl-CoA. The N-ter domain of L-CPT1 confers its lower sensitivity to malonyl CoA. CPT2, the inner mitochondrial membrane enzyme, reconverts long-chain acylcamitines into long-chain acyl CoA esters. Long-chain acyl-CoAs are then p-oxidized to acetyl-CoA, which activates the pyruvate carboxylase and gluconeogenesis. According to the mechanism of action described above, pharmaceutically active substances which inhibit L-CPT1 reduce liver ^-oxidation, consequently inhibit gluconeogenesis and therefore counteract hyperglycemia.<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds which inhibit liver carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (L-CPT1) activity. The compounds of the present invention can be used as pharmaceutically active agents which are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases which are modulated by L-CPT1 inhibitors, particularly diseases which are related to hyperglycemia and/or glucose tolerance disorders. Such<br><br>
diseases include e.g. diabetes and associated pathologies, non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (also referred to as diabetes type II), obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure and renal failure<br>

The tetrahydrofuran was evaporated under reduced pressure and the solution adjusted to pH 7 with IN HC1 (aq) (141 ml), forming a white precipitate. The precipitate was filtered and washed with water and heptane. The solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 50Â°C to give quinoline-7-carboxylic acid, 8.4 g (100% yield) as a<br><br>

Additional Bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (1.10 g, 2.36 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) and diisopropyl ethyl amine (0.61 g, 4.7 mmol, 0.4 equiv.) were added and the mixture refluxed for a further 16 hours.

give a tan solid. The solid was purified by flash chromatography (SiCh, 1:9 terf-butyl-<br>
