FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an industrially advantageous and an improved process for the preparation of 4-hydroxybenzylalkyl ethers. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 4-{2-isopropoxyethoxyn]ethyI)-phenol of Formula I<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bisoprolol of Formula II, is a Pi-selective adrenoceptor blocking agent and is chemically known as l-[4-[[2-(l-methylethoxy)ethoxy]methyl]phenoxy]-3-[(l-methylethyl)amino]-2-propanol. Bisoprolol is orally administered and is used in the treatment of angina and hypertension. 4-(2-Isopropoxyethoxymethyl)phenol of Formula I is the key intermediate in the preparation of   Bisoprolol<br><br>
US patent 4,258,062 has described the synthesis of Bisoprolol using 4-(2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)phenot   as   the   starling   material,   in   this   patent   4-(2-<br>
-2-<br><br>
IsopropQxyethoxymethyl)phenol of Formula I    has been prepared by healing    4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol of Formula I!!,<br><br>
However, in this process due to heating at higher temperature impurities are forming which is not desirable for preparing pure bisoprolol.<br>
German patent application DE 44 34 823 discloses a process for the preparation of 4-(2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)phenol by condensing 4-hydroxybenzyi alcohol with ethylene glycol monoisopropyl ether in the presence of ion exchange resins such as IR 120, Amberlyst 15, Dowex 50 etc. But the use of resin involves laborious work such as its activation, requirement of large quantities of resin and specific design of reactors. The process thus have undesirable features for industrial scale manufacture and is not economical.<br>
Chem. Pharm. Bull., 2002, 50(3), 380-382 discloses a method for the preparation of 4-(2-isopropoxyeihoxymethyl)phenol, which comprises the reaction of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol with 2-isopropoxyethanol in the presence of rare earth metal triflates. But in this process polymerization occurs possibly due to heating at higher temperature. Further, expensive rare earth metal triflates are used in this process, which are not commercially available. However, in the exemplified process, column chromatography was used to obtain the pure product. The use of column chromatography is very tedious, cumbersome and generally not a preferred method of choice on a commercial scale. For the above said reasons this method is not viable for commercial purpose.<br>
-3-<br><br>
in view of the above, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient and simple method to prepare 4-(2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)phenol, which should be simple to operate on commercial scale.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a simple, efficient and commercially viable process for the preparation of 4-(2-isopropoxyethoxy methyl)-phenol of Formula !, wherein use of ion exchange resins and other expensive reagents is avoided.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 4-(2-isopropoxyethoxy-methyi)phenol of Formula I,<br><br>
using acid as catalyst either in the presence or absence of solvent, at a temperature 0 to !00X, -    isolating 4-(2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)phenol by conventional methods.<br>
-4-<br><br>
Further the compound of Formula i is converted to Bisoprolol, by reacting it with epichlorohydrin and treating the resulting product with isopropyl amine. It may optionally be  converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 'H2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)phenol of Formula I from 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol of Formula III and isopropoxyalcohol of Formula IV, using acid in catalytic amount In the presence or absence of solvent.<br>
The acid used can be organic acid or inorganic acid such as sulfonic acids for example p-toluenesulfonic acid, melhanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, naphthalanesuIfonic acid; halo acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid; sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like or mixture thereof, preferred being sulfonic acids and most preferred being p-toluenesulfonic acid.<br>
The amount of catalyst plays an important role on the rate of the reaction. If amount of catalyst is increased the reaction is faster. The catalyst can be used in an amount of 2-10 % to the weight of the 4-hydroxyben2yl alcohol, preferably in an amount of 1-5 %.<br>
The solvent used in the present condensation reaction can be selected from hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, ketones, nitriles, amides, sulfoxides and the like or mixtures thereof.<br>
In one of the embodiments of the present invention the reaction is carried out in the absence of solvent.<br>
Usually, condensation reaction is carried out at a temperature between 0 to 100°C and preferably 10 to 40°C and most preferably the reaction is carried out at 15 to 30°C<br>
-5-<br><br>
When the reaction is carried out in the absence of solvent, on completion of reaction, the reaclion mass is diluted with the inert solvent exemplified above and neutralized with a base or washed with water until the pH of the washings is 4.5-7.0 and preferably between 5.0- 5.8.<br>
When the reaction is conducted in the presence of solvent, after completion of reaction, the organic layer is washed with water or base until the pH of the washings is 4.5-7.0 and preferably 5.0- 5.8.<br>
This washing is essential to remove any traces of acid, which if present, leads to degradation during Isolation of product.<br>
The bases, which can be used, are dilute aqueous solutions of alkali metal hydro.xides, bicarbonates, carbonates or aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution.<br>
Thereafter, the organic layer is concentrated and crude product obtained is purified by distillation under reduced pressure to obtain the compound of Formula I in high yield and having purity greater than 98 % by HPLC.<br>
The compound of Formula 1 is isolated and converted to Bisoprolol by the method which comprises,<br>
- reacting compound of Formula I with epichlorohydrin m the presence of a base, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide at a temperature of 30-60°C to prepare epoxy benzyl ether of Formula V,<br><br>
-6-<br><br>
- treating epoxy benzyl ether of Formula V with isopropyi amine in hydroxylated solvents such as by the method reported in the prior art. Specifically the reaction is conducted in alcohols such as ethano), methanol, isopropyi alcohol, and the like, to prepare Bisoproloi of high purity. Bisoprolol thus prepared is further converted to its fumarate salt by treating with fumaric acid.<br>
Major advantages realized in the present invention are the use of catalytic amount of acid under mild conditions, to prepare 4-(2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)phenol of Formula I in high yield and purity without using any ion exchange resin and expensive reagents.<br>
