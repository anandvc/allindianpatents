				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention aims to provide<br>
improvements to grinding rollers for crushers in general,<br>
and for "vertical laxis" crushers in particular.<br>
Technological backlground at the basis of the invention<br>
"Vertical axis" crushers are used for<br>
instance for crushing coal or clinker. They are essentially<br>
made of a rotating track supporting rollers that are driven<br>
by the rotary motion of the track along the vertical axis.<br>
The material to be crushed is fed into a central supply<br>
channel and falls onto the track, where it is crushed and<br>
ground between the track and the rollers. The ground<br>
material is then retrieved from the periphery of the track.<br>
Various types of roller shapes are possible,<br>
such as tapered 0r toric rollers. Document DE 44 00 797 Al<br>
describes rollers of this shape where the wear parts are<br>
mechanically sealed by a mechanical fixation means.<br>
Document JP 2001 129418 describes a<br>
mechanical crusher with wear parts provided at the outer<br>
surfaces of the rollers, that allow their easy replacement<br>
when grooves are showing signs of wear. These wear parts<br>
are inserted into a core in the form of an inverted T so<br>
that they perfectly adhere to the whole surface of the<br>
protrusions.<br>
The techniques used in the German and<br>
Japanese documents! do not use the technology of casting the<br>
protrusions. The techniques used in the German and Japanese<br>
documents do not use the casting technology of pouring a<br>
more ductile material around inserts allowing to fix the<br>
latter in the remaining mass of the roller.<br>
Spec-ific forms of vertical axis crushers are<br>
shown in Figures 1 and 2. This subject is described in more<br>
detail in patent EP 0 476 496 Bl.<br>
This patent describes among other things a<br>
particular configuration of the grinding rollers whose<br>
characteristic feature is that the wear surface is<br>
essentially made up of peripheral inserts in very hard<br>
materials with high wear resistance (such as cast iron with<br>
a high chromium level), mechanically sealed in a matrix of<br>
a ductile material].<br>
In tjhis version, the inserts are produced in<br>
advance with a prdtruding rib on at least one longitudinal<br>
side and are then! placed side by side in a mould, leaving<br>
between them a space defined by the thickness of their<br>
ribs. The roller is produced in the form of a bimetallic<br>
part by a casting technique by pouring a more ductile<br>
material that ensures the mechanical connection of the<br>
inserts in the remaining mass of the roller formed by the<br>
ductile material.<br>
The peripheral inserts thus being spaced by<br>
ribs relative to each other, the ductile material, during<br>
the manufacture of the roller by casting, may infiltrate<br>
between the inserts until the peripheral wear surface<br>
itself, thus ensuring that the inserts are well fixed in<br>
the parts. This arrangement leads to a succession of hard<br>
inserts that are essentially separated by a gap in a more<br>
ductile material (with the exception being the spacing<br>
ribs) .<br>
In ojrder for the ductile metal to be able to<br>
continuously infiltrate between the inserts, the gap<br>
created between the inserts when they are positioned in the<br>
mould should progressively increase from the periphery<br>
towards the middle! in such a way that the molten metal does<br>
not coagulate upon contact with the cold inserts, thereby<br>
preventing the complete filling of this gap with the<br>
ductile metal. However, due to the wear of the part in use,<br>
this arrangement changes, creating at the periphery a wider<br>
and wider ductile gap, resulting of the slope of the sides<br>
of this gap. This nevertheless causes the unfortunate<br>
effect of reducing the hard peripheral surface of the<br>
inserts and, as a result, of accelerating the wear of the<br>
part.<br>
Moreover, in the case of grinding rollers,<br>
localised preferertial wear is observed, generally on the<br>
outer edges of the roller. This wear affects the useful<br>
life of the rollers but also the quality of the ground<br>
product as well as the grinding yield since the support<br>
surface of the roller on the track is reduced and this is<br>
even more so since! the track itself is subjected to wear in<br>
operation.<br>
In the case where, according to a recent<br>
technical development, the inserts contain internal<br>
reinforcement of ceramic materials in order to reduce wear,<br>
the presence of an unprotected gap between the inserts<br>
means that in operation, a groove is created between the<br>
inserts, thereby detaching the ceramic reinforcement and<br>
chipping its edgejs. This phenomenon greatly reduces the<br>
efficiency of the ceramic reinforcement since it then<br>
produces very abrasive materials in addition to the fact<br>
that its potential wear resistance diminishes with its<br>
size.<br>
In the above-mentioned patent, there is also<br>
a description (in relation to Figures 5 to 9) of an<br>
embodiment of a collar that compensates for the wear<br>
profile according to the generatrix.<br>
To do this, the inserts do not extend in<br>
their longitudinal direction along the entire length of the<br>
generatrix so that they leave, on the outer edge of the<br>
rollers, a peripheral lug belonging to the support of<br>
ductile cast iron, making up the rest of the roller.<br>
More rapid wear is thereby deliberately<br>
caused in this area of the roller in order to compensate<br>
for the fact that this area normally wears less rapidly.<br>
However, this method has the drawback that the wear on the<br>
lug of ductile cast iron exposes the end of the insert to<br>
chipping similar to that described above regarding the<br>
longitudinal edges! of the insert, with the same detrimental<br>
consequences.<br>
Aim of the invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to<br>
provide a new form of insert so as to avoid the drawbacks<br>
of the solutions o!f the state of the art.<br>
Characteristic elements of the invention<br>
The present invention discloses a composite<br>
grinding roller, produced by casting, having peripheral<br>
inserts in a material with high wear resistance and great<br>
hardness, sealed during said casting in a ductile matrix,<br>
said ductile matrix infiltrating around or in the<br>
peripheral insert :during this casting in such a way as to<br>
form a close contact at the interface between said<br>
peripheral inserts and said ductile matrix, said roller<br>
having both first zones subjected to heavy wear and second<br>
zones subjected io light wear wherein said first zone<br>
comprises on its peripheral face inserts with an abutted<br>
part and said second zone has a part that is not abutted,<br>
the gap in said part that is not abutted being filled with<br>
said ductile material during casting, allowing sufficient<br>
mechanical fixation of the inserts.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the abutted faces jcoming into contact with their neighbours<br>
in successive insesrts have a contact line corresponding to<br>
the radii of the circle formed by the roller.<br>
According to the present invention, the ratio<br>
of the lengths of the abutted faces to the lengths of the<br>
zones where the fajces do not abut is greater than or equal<br>
to 0.2.<br>
In general, the invention specifies that the<br>
ratio between the lengths of the zones where the faces abut<br>
to the lengths of the zones where the faces do not abut is<br>
between 0.2 and 20.<br>
In ap especially preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the Wear resistance of the inserts, in<br>
particular in the iabutting parts, is increased by a ceramic<br>
reinforcement selected from the group of oxides, carbides,<br>
nitrides or borideis.<br>
StilJL according to the invention, said insert<br>
comprises at least one undercut allowing its sealing into<br>
said matrix cast in ductile material.<br>
Brief description of the figures<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows a "vertical<br>
axis" crusher.<br>
Figure 2 shows the grinding mechanism acting<br>
between the track and the roller I with zones of heavier<br>
wear 2 and 4 and zones of lighter wear 3. The wear that may<br>
occur on the track! is also shown.<br>
Figure 3 schematically shows in perspective a<br>
roller as in the state of the art for which are shown a<br>
certain number of spaced inserts extending longitudinally<br>
over the whole length of the roller's generatrix.<br>
Figure 4 shows the insert as in the state of<br>
the art, showing the spacing ribs 20 that were not shown in<br>
Figure 3.<br>
5 shows an example of wear profiles<br>
observed on two types of rollers a and b as in the state of<br>
the art.<br>
Figure 6 shows the formation of wear grooves<br>
16 in the inserts (as in the state of the art.<br>
Figure 7 shows the flaking-off of the edges<br>
of the ceramic reinforcements 17 and 18 of the inserts<br>
resulting from the formation of grooves shown in Figure 6.<br>
Figure 8 is a view of a set of inserts<br>
juxtaposed as in the invention.<br>
Figure 9 is a sectional view of an insert in<br>
zone 14, as in Figure 8.<br>
Figute 10 is a plan view of the partially<br>
abutted arrangement of three inserts as in the invention.<br>
Figure 11 is a sectional view of an insert as<br>
in Figure 10.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 correspond to Figures 8 and<br>
9 respectively in the case where the inserts comprise<br>
ceramic reinforcements (shown by dots).<br>
Identical reference numbers are used in the<br>
various figures for identical or essentially similar<br>
constituent elements, both for the description of the state<br>
of the art and for the embodiment as in the invention.<br>
In Figures 3 and 4 that show embodiments as<br>
in the state of the art, the common reference number 1<br>
indicates a roller having inserts 5 which, as a result of<br>
the presence of the ribs 20 during the formation of the<br>
roller by casting, are longitudinally spaced, the ribs 20<br>
serving as spacers.<br>
As indicated above, in order to allow the<br>
passage of the ductile metal 19 intended to globally form<br>
the remaining part of the roller 1 between the inserts<br>
through to the we4r surfaces themselves during the casting<br>
of the roller, progressive spacing is provided between the<br>
inserts at an angle a from the periphery towards the axis<br>
of the roller (see Figure 3).<br>
It can oe seen in operation that, as a result<br>
of differential war, the gap between the roller and the<br>
table in the longitudinal direction is no longer constant,<br>
which greatly reduces the grinding efficiency, especially<br>
as the table itself may be subjected to wear. This is shown<br>
in Figure 2. Moreover, the wear on the rollers becomes<br>
heavier as the peripheral surface of the insert is reduced<br>
by the existence of grooves of increasing width that are<br>
created in operation between the hard inserts.<br>
Depending on the shape of the roller, whether<br>
tapered or toric and on the type of crusher, a wear<br>
profile 4 can be seen as shown in. Figure 5, varying for<br>
instance between one or two zones with heavy wear 2 and 4<br>
and a zone with lighter wear 3.<br>
In order to increase the wear resistance of<br>
the inserts 5, in particular on their outer parts 14,<br>
reinforcement may be provided there by infiltrating a<br>
porous ceramic core: oxides, carbides, nitrides, borides or<br>
other substances as described for example in patent EP 0<br>
930 948 Bl or by dreating a ceramic structure in situ.<br>
In the case of the use of a composite with a<br>
ceramic reinforcement, the formation of grooves of<br>
increasing size resulting from wear 16 in operation would<br>
present an important drawback because these grooves detach<br>
the ceramic contained in the insert {Figure 6) which, under<br>
the effect of impacts and pressure, chips at the edges<br>
(Figure 7). This considerably increases wear and destroys<br>
to a great extent the point of this ceramic reinforcement.<br>
Figure 6 shows the formation of grooves 16<br>
according to the former design, with inserts 5 without<br>
ceramic reinforcement.<br>
Figure 7 shows what happens in operation when<br>
a ceramic reinforcement 18 is incorporated into the inserts<br>
5. It is observed that after the formation of grooves 16 in<br>
the ductile metal, the ridges 17 of the infiltrated ceramic<br>
mass 18 break, (releasing very abrasive materials and<br>
accelerating the formation of the irregular wear profile.<br>
Given these experimental data, the inserts<br>
are designed as in! the invention in such a way as to create<br>
a differential wear resistance between the parts subjected<br>
to heavy wear 2 ajnd 4 and the parts subjected to lighter<br>
wear 3.<br>
According to the invention, this effect is<br>
obtained by using inserts 5 (see Figures 8 and following)<br>
that abut in the above-mentioned part subjected to heavy<br>
wear 2 and that maintain the gaps 12 in the part subjected<br>
to lighter wear 3 that are filled by a cast ductile metal<br>
1 9 . A zone with high wear resistance 1 4 a n d a zone w i t lower wear resistajnce 13 are thus obtained. The faces 6 and<br>
7 that come into contact with their neighbours in the<br>
successive insert (see Figures 8 and 10) are aligned on<br>
the centre of the roller, i.e. their line of contact in<br>
section corresponds to the radii of the circle formed by<br>
the roller. This ensures perfect contact between the<br>
inserts 5 when they are placed next to each other, whereas<br>
the recessed surfaces 10 and 11 define the spacing between<br>
the inserts, thus creating a zone that is less resistant to<br>
wear 13 on the inner part of the roller, whilst the most<br>
exposed surface 14 will be continuous, without the risk of<br>
grooves occurring and, as a result, without the risk of a<br>
reduction in wear resistance.<br>
The relative position of the zone(s)<br>
subjected to heavy wear compared to the position of one of<br>
the zones subjectd to light wear will depend on the type<br>
of crusher and on the type of roller and, more<br>
particularly, on its geometrical form.<br>
The tatio of the width of the zone(s) heavily<br>
exposed to wear to the width of the zone(s) lightly exposed<br>
to wear is usually greater than or equal to one. Ratios<br>
between the respective widths of these same zones of 1 to<br>
1.5 allow both the provision for a sufficient grinding area<br>
and suitable fixation of the inserts in the matrix.<br>
The fact that the inner part 3 of the insert<br>
retains the ability to form grooves is beneficial in itself<br>
in the sense that it thus ensures better drive of the<br>
roller by reducing the sliding or skidding effect over the<br>
material to be ground.<br>
The fixation of the inserts in the matrix is<br>
mechanically ensured and this essentially by means of the<br>
shape of the lower part 15 of the insert, as shown in<br>
Figure 9.<br>
This shape is selected so as to allow a<br>
strong undercut of a dovetail type, a hole or another<br>
fixation means.<br>
Figujres 10 and 11 show the continuity<br>
according to the invention of the ceramic reinforcements 18<br>
in the outer part 14 of the wear surface of the inserts<br>
made up of the two parts 13 and 14, which eliminates the<br>
fragile ridges and, as a result, the loss of material<br>
intended to resist wear.<br>
