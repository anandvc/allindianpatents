				<td>This invention relates to a process for preparation of polymeric adsorbents.<br>
Phenolics are many times present in aromatic compounds as trace impurities e.g. phenol in anisole or nitrophenols in nitrobenzene, o,p -Bisphenol in bisphenol-A, p-tertiary butyl catechol in styrene). These impurities lead to problems in down stream processing of these chemicals. Aromatics containing phenolic impurities when undergo catalytic oxidation / reduction reactions phenols in them can form tarry products which poison / deactivate the catalyst. Hence for enhancing the catalyst life as well as for better economics of the process it is necessary to remove phenolic impurities from aromatics. Another necessity for removal of phenols arises from the improvement in quality which is desirable for any product.<br>
Phenolic impurities can be removed from aqueous streams using a variety of methods such as adsorption, distillation, and solvent extraction. These methods are commonly used on industrial scale as well.<br>
Various kinds of adsorbents are used to achieve the same goal. The adsorbents used for removal of phenolic compounds can be either inorganic or organic in nature. The inorganic adsorbents used for such applications are silica and zeolites where as commonly used organic adsorbents are polymeric in nature.<br>
There are two kinds of polymeric adsorbents in common use for removal of phenolic compounds. These are crosslinked styrene - divinylbenzene resins (Amberlite XAD - 2, 4) marketed by Rohm and Haas or their equivalems and crosslinked acrylate /<br><br>
methacrylate resins ( Amberlite XAD - 7, 8 ) or their equivalents. These are suitable for removal of phenolic compounds from aqueous phase.<br>
Though these adsorbents are suitable for removal of phenolic compounds from aqueous phase, they do not have any structural feature which can distinguish between various phenols and hence they are not selective for a particular phenol. These adsorbents are able to remove phenolic compounds from aqueous streams as well as non polar organic streams mainly based on the polarity difference between the solute and the solvent.<br>
In literature there are references for preparation of polymers which are selective to a particular substrate such as drug molecules (theophyllin, phenobarbital, creatanine), sterols (cholesterol, corticosteroids), nucleic acid bases, carbohydrates etc. The technique of preparation of such polymers is known as molecular imprinting ( Wnlff, G., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed, Eng., 34 (1995 ), 1812 -1832, Mosbach, K. mid Ramstrom, 0., Biotechnology, 14 (1996), 163 - 173, Steinke, J., Sherringtw, D. C. and Dunkin, I. R., Advances in polymer science Vol. 123 (1995 ), 81 -125). The polymers prepared by this technique are known as molecularly imprinted polymers or more commonly and herein after referred as MIPs. (MIPs)<br>
The MIPs are prepared by polymerization of monomers around a template molecule in the presence of a large excess of crosslinks. The template is either covalently or non covalently linked to the monomers. After the polymerization the template is removed from the polymer leaving behind a cavity in the polymer. These cavities have shape and size similar to the template molecule used during polymerization and hence are selective to those particular substrates.<br><br>
There are no reports in the literature for the preparatic       polymeric adsorbents selective for phenolic compounds using molecular imprinting teacque.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of polymeric adsorbents.<br>
