				<td>Use of Amino-Oxy Functional Groups in the Preparation of Vaccines<br>
This application claims benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
Nos. 60/539,573 filed January 29, 2004, and 60/589,019, filed July 20, 2004.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process of covalently linking proteins and<br>
polysaccharides to form conjugate vaccines comprising a reaction between<br>
carbonyl-containing groups and amino-oxy functional groups.<br>
In the process of vaccination, medical science uses the body's innate ability<br>
to protect itself against invading agents by immunizing the body with antigens that<br>
will not cause the disease but will stimulate the formation of antibodies that will<br>
protect against the disease. For example, dead organisms are injected to protect<br>
against bacterial diseases such as typhoid fever and whooping cough, toxoids are<br>
injected to protect against tetanus and diptheria, and attenuated organisms are<br>
injected to protect against viral diseases such as poliomyelitis and measles.<br>
It is not always possible, however, to stimulate antibody formation merely<br>
by injecting the foreign agent. The vaccine preparation must be immunogenic,<br>
that is, it must be able to induce an immune response. Certain agents such as<br>
tetanus toxoid can innately trigger the immune response, and may be<br>
administered in vaccines without modification. Other important agents are not<br>
immunogenic, however, and must be converted into immunogenic molecules or<br>
constructs before they can induce the immune response.<br>
The immune response is a complex series of reactions that can generally<br>
be described as follows: (1) the antigen enters the body and encounters antigen-<br>
presenting cells that process the antigen and retain fragments of the antigen on<br>
their surfaces; (2) the antigen fragments retained on the antigen-presenting cells<br>
are recognized by T cells that provide help to B cells; and (3) the B cells are<br><br>
stimulated to proliferate and divide into antibody forming cells that secrete<br>
antibody against the antigen.<br>
Most antigens only elicit antibodies with assistance from the T cells and,<br>
hence, are known as T-dependent (TD). Examples of such T-dependent antigens<br>
are tetanus and diphtheria toxoids.<br>
Some antigens, such as polysaccharides, cannot be properly processed by<br>
antigen presenting cells and are not recognized by T cells. These antigens do not<br>
require T cell assistance to elicit antibody formation but can activate B cells<br>
directly and, hence, are known as T-independent antigens (Tl). Such T-<br>
independent antigens include H. influenzae type b polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate<br>
(PRP) and pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides.<br>
There are other differences between T-independent and T-dependent<br>
antigens.<br>
A)	T-dependent antigens, but not T-independent antigens, can prime an<br>
immune response so that a memory response results on secondary challenge<br>
with the same antigen.<br>
B)	The affinity of the antibody for antigen increases with time after<br>
immunization with T-dependent, but not T-independent antigens.<br>
C)	T-dependent antigens stimulate an immature or neonatal immune<br>
system more effectively than T-independent antigens.<br>
D)	T-dependent antigens usually stimulate IgM, lgG1, lgG2a, and IgE<br>
antibodies, while T-independent antigens stimulate IgM, lgG1, lgG2b, and lgG3<br>
antibodies.<br>
T-dependent antigens can stimulate primary and secondary responses,<br>
which are long-lived in both adult and in neonatal immune systems, but must<br>
frequently be administered with adjuvants (substances that enhance the immune<br><br>
response). Very small proteins, such as peptides, are rarely immunogenic, even<br>
when administered with adjuvants.<br>
T-independent antigens, such as polysaccharides, are able to stimulate<br>
immune responses in the absence of adjuvants, but cannot stimulate high level or<br>
prolonged antibody responses. They are also unable to stimulate an immature or<br>
B cell defective immune system (Mond, J. J., Immunological Reviews, 64:99<br>
(1982); Mosier, D. E. et al., J. Immunol., 119:1874 (1977)).<br>
For T-independent antigens, it is desirable to provide protective immunity<br>
against such antigens to children, especially against capsular polysaccharides<br>
found on organisms such as H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and Neisseria<br>
meningiditis.<br>
One approach to enhance the immune response to T-independent antigens<br>
involves conjugating polysaccharides such as H. influenzae PRP (Cruse, J. M.,<br>
Lewis, R. E. Jr., eds., Conjugate Vaccines in Contributions to Microbiology and<br>
Immunology, Vol. 10, (1989)), or oligosaccharide antigens (Anderson, P. W. et al.,<br>
J. Immunol., 142:2464, (1989)) to a T-dependent antigen such as tetanus or<br>
diphtheria toxoid. Recruitment of T cell help in this way has been shown to<br>
provide enhanced immunity to many infants that have been immunized.<br>
Protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines stimulate an anti-<br>
polysaccharide antibody response in infants who are otherwise unable to respond<br>
to the polysaccharide alone.<br>
Conjugation of a protein and a polysaccharide may provide other<br>
advantageous results. For example, Applicant has found that a<br>
protein/polysaccharide conjugate may enhance the antibody response not only to<br>
the polysaccharide component, but also to the protein component. This effect is<br>
described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,955,079. This effect also is<br>
described in A. Lees, et al., Vaccine, 12(13): 1160 (1994).<br><br>
Techniques have been developed to facilitate coupling of proteins and<br>
polysaccharides. See, for example, Dick, W. E. et al., "Glyconjugates of Bacterial<br>
Carbohydrate Antigens: A Survey and Consideration of Design and Preparation<br>
Factors," Conjugate Vaccines (Eds. Cruse, et al.), p. 48 (1989). Many techniques<br>
for activation of carbohydrates, however, are not suitable for use in aqueous<br>
media because the activating or functional reagents are not stable in water. For<br>
example, N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, as described in Marburg et al., U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,695,624, must be used in organic media.<br>
Homofunctional and heterofunctional vinylsulfone reagents have been used<br>
to activate polysaccharides. The activated polysaccharides are reacted with a<br>
protein, peptide, or hapten, under appropriate reaction conditions, to produce the<br>
conjugate. This is described in more detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,309,646. Another<br>
method for producing conjugate vaccines comprises mixing a uronium salt<br>
reagent with a soluble first moiety, such as a polysaccharide or carbohydrate, and<br>
combining therewith a second moiety, such as a protein, peptide, or carbohydrate,<br>
to form the conjugate vaccine. This method is described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,299,881.<br>
Most carbohydrates must be activated before conjugation, and cyanogen<br>
bromide (CNBr) is frequently the activating agent of choice. See, e.g., Chu et al.,<br>
Inf. &amp; Imm., 40:245 (1983). The first licensed conjugate vaccine was prepared<br>
with CNBr to activate HIB PRP, which was then derivatized with adipic<br>
dihydrazide and coupled to tetanus toxoid using a water-soluble carbodiimide.<br>
The use of 1-cyano-4-(dimethylamino)-pyridinium tetrafluoroborate, also<br>
called "CDAP," has been described for use in aqueous media to activate<br>
polysaccharides. These activated polysaccharides may be directly or indirectly<br>
coupled to proteins. The use of CDAP is described in, for example, U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,849,301 and in Lees, et al., "Activation of Soluble Polysaccharides with 1-<br><br>
Cyano-4-Dimethylamino Pyridinium Tetrafluoroborate For Use in Protein-<br>
Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccines and Immunological Reagents," Vaccine,<br>
14(3):190(1996).<br>
To briefly summarize the CNBr-activation method, CNBr is reacted with the<br>
carbohydrate at a high pH, typically a pH of 10 to 12. At this high pH, cyanate<br>
esters are formed with the hydroxyl groups of the carbohydrate. These, in turn,<br>
are reacted with a bifunctional reagent, commonly a diamine or a dihydrazide.<br>
These derivatized carbohydrates may then be conjugated via the bifunctional<br>
group. In certain limited cases, the cyanate esters may also be directly reacted to<br>
protein.<br>
The high pH is necessary to ionize the hydroxyl group because the reaction<br>
requires the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl ion on the cyanate ion (CN~). As a<br>
result, CNBr produces many side reactions, some of which add neo-antigens to<br>
the polysaccharides. Wilcheck, M. et al., Affinity Chromatography. Meth.<br>
Enzymol., 104:3-55 (1984). More importantly, many carbohydrates or moieties<br>
such as Hib, PRP, and capsular polysaccharides from and pneumococcal type 6<br>
and Neisseria meningitis A can be hydrolyzed or damaged by the high pH<br>
necessary to perform the cyanogen bromide activation.<br>
Another problem with the CNBr activation method is that the cyanate ester<br>
formed is unstable at high pH and rapidly hydrolyzes, reducing the yield of<br>
derivatized carbohydrate and, hence, the overall yield of carbohydrate conjugated<br>
to protein. Many other nonproductive side reactions, such as those producing<br>
carbamates and linear imidocarbonates, are promoted by the high pH. This effect<br>
is described in Kohn et al., Anal. Biochem, 115:375 (1981). Moreover, CNBr itself<br>
is highly unstable and spontaneously hydrolyzes at high pH, further reducing the<br>
overall yield.<br><br>
Protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines may also be formed via<br>
reductive amination. In this method, aldehydes on the polysaccharide are reacted<br>
with amines on the protein to form a reversible Schiff base. The Schiff base is<br>
subsequently reduced to form a stable linkage between the amine and the<br>
aldehyde. This process is beset by a number of problems. The formation of the<br>
Schiff base is slow and inefficient, and the overall reaction is further impeded by<br>
the large size of the two components (i.e., the polysaccharide and protein), which<br>
need to be in close proximity with each other in order to react. In order to<br>
overcome this problem, the polysaccharide is often broken down into<br>
oligosaccharides prior to coupling.<br>
The use of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) promotes the formation of the Schiff<br>
base, but this organic solvent can harm the protein. Sometimes a multistep<br>
protocol is used, in which a spacer group (e.g., hexane diamine or adipic<br>
dihydrazide) is added to the polysaccharide via reductive amination, and this<br>
spacer is subsequently ligated to the protein. Using a high concentration of the<br>
spacer helps to force the reaction and increase the yield. Elevated temperatures<br>
and prolonged reaction times are also used to promote the reaction. However,<br>
these can also be detrimental to the protein and the polysaccharide. Furthermore,<br>
as amines must be deprotonated to react with aldehydes, the Schiff base<br>
formation usually requires the use of alkaline solutions, i.e., solutions at a pH &gt;. 8.<br>
Prolonged reactions at elevated temperature and pH can be detrimental to both<br>
the protein and the polysaccharide. Furthermore, the reductive step, which<br>
usually involves the use of cyanoborohydride or pyridine-boranes, can be<br>
inefficient and deleterious to the protein. Also, these reagents can be hazardous<br>
to work with in large quantities. A further limitation of the reductive amination<br>
method is the highly random nature of the linkage sites between the protein and<br>
the polysaccharide.<br><br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for an efficient and effective<br>
process for preparing conjugate vaccines.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A. Strategy for Conjugation<br>
The present invention provides an alternative to prior art processes for<br>
preparing conjugate vaccines. Specifically, the invention provides for new<br>
methods of conjugating a first moiety to a second moiety, where the first moiety is<br>
chosen from polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, carbohydrates, and<br>
carbohydrate-containing molecules and the second moiety is chosen from<br>
proteins, peptides, and haptens, and the conjugation proceeds using at least one<br>
amino-oxy functional group.<br>
There are a number of ways of reacting the first and second moiety within<br>
the scope of the invention and each of these methods rely on using at least one<br>
amino-oxy group in the process.<br>
At least one amino-oxy reagent with one amino-oxy group may be reacted<br>
with the first moiety to form a composition with at least one non-amino-oxy<br>
pendent functional group.<br><br>
At least one amino-oxy reagent with more than one amino-oxy group may<br>
be reacted with the first moiety to form a composition with at least one amino-oxy<br>
pendent functional group. In this embodiment, there may optionally additionally<br>
be present at least one non-amino-oxy pendent functional group.<br>
At least one amino-oxy reagent with one amino-oxy group may be reacted<br>
with the second moiety to form a composition with at least one non-amino-oxy<br>
pendent functional group.<br>
At least one amino-oxy reagent with more than one amino-oxy group may<br>
be reacted with the second moiety to form a composition with at least one amino-<br>
oxy pendent functional group. In this embodiment, there may optionally<br>
additionally be present at least one non-amino-oxy pendent functional group.<br>
Thus, in this invention, at least one of the first moiety and the second<br>
moiety will be reacted with an amino-oxy reagent, and will result in a composition<br>
with at least one pendent functional group (at least one of an amino-oxy or non-<br>
amino-oxy pendent functional group). It is possible to functionalize both the first<br>
moiety and the second moiety according to any combination of strategies 1 or 2<br>
(first moiety) and 3 or 4 (second moiety), as set forth immediately above. In<br>
another embodiment, either the first moiety or the second moiety may be<br>
functionalized.<br>
The first moiety and the second moiety may then be conjugated together.<br>
This conjugation may proceed directly, by linking the pendent functional group on<br>
the first moiety directly to the second moiety. Alternatively, this conjugation may<br>
proceed indirectly, by linking the pendent functional group on the first moiety to an<br>
additional agent called a spacer, which is then linked to the second moiety.<br>
Certainly, a similar strategy may be followed with a pendent functional group on<br>
the second moiety, simply by reversing the positions of the first and second<br>
moiety.<br><br>
B. The First Moiety: Polysaccharide, Oligosaccharide, Carbohydrate,<br>
and Carbohydrate-Containing Molecules<br>
As used herein, "carbohydrate" means any soluble monosaccharide,<br>
disaccharide, oligosaccharide, or polysaccharide. Examples of suitable<br>
polysaccharides for use in the process of the invention include bacterial, fungal,<br>
and viral polysaccharides. Soluble polysaccharides (i.e., polysaccharides present<br>
in solution), such as water-soluble polysaccharides, are suitable for use in<br>
accordance with the present invention. Specific examples of suitable<br>
polysaccharides include Salmonella typhi V\ antigen; Neisseria meningiditis<br>
polysaccharide C; and Pneumococcal polysaccharides, such as Pneumococcal<br>
polysaccharide type 14<br>
According to certain embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
carbohydrate is naturally occurring, a semisynthetic, or a totally synthetic large<br>
molecular weight molecule. According to one embodiment, at least one<br>
carbohydrate-containing moiety is selected from E. coli polysaccharides, S.<br>
aureus polysaccharides, dextran, carboxymethyl cellulose, agarose,<br>
Pneumococcal polysaccharides (Pn), Ficoll, Cryptococcus neoformans,<br>
Haemophilus influenzae PRP, P. aeroginosa, S. pneumoniae, Group A and B<br>
streptococcus, N. meningitidis, and combinations thereof.<br>
According to one embodiment, the carbohydrate-containing moiety is a<br>
dextran. As used herein, "dextran" (dex) refers to a polysaccharide composed of<br>
a single sugar, which may be obtained from any number of sources (e.g.,<br>
Pharmacia). Another preferred carbohydrate-containing moiety is Ficoll, which is<br>
an inert, semisynthetic, non-ionized, high molecular weight polymer. Additional<br>
non-limiting examples of moieties that may be used in accordance with the<br>
present invention include lipopolysaccharides ("LPS"), lipooligopolysaccharides<br>
("LOS"), lipotechoic acid ("LTA"), deaceylated LPS, deaceylated LTA, delipidated<br><br>
LPS, delipidated LTA, and related molecules. Generally, a carbohydrate-<br>
containing molecule that has been coupled using reductive amination requires the<br>
formation of an aldehyde moiety. In those instances, for example, these<br>
aldehydes may also be coupled using amino-oxy chemistry described herein.<br>
Reductive amination has been used to couple LPS and LOS, both of which<br>
can be coupled using amino-oxy chemistry. Examples of coupling of LPS and<br>
LOS using reductive amination chemistry may be found in Mieszala et al.,<br>
Carbohydrate Research, 338:167 (2003); Jennings et al., Inf. &amp; Immun., 43:407<br>
(1984); and U.S. Patent No. 4,663,160.<br>
C. The Second Moiety: Proteins, Peptides and Haptens<br>
In accordance with the present invention, various different proteins can be<br>
coupled to various different polysaccharides. The following list includes examples<br>
of suitable proteins that may be used in accordance with the invention: viral<br>
proteins, bacterial proteins, fungal proteins, parasitic proteins, animal proteins.<br>
Glycoproteins from any of the above sources may also be used to form a<br>
conjugate with the first moiety. Lipids, glycolipids, peptides, and haptens are also<br>
suitable for use as a second moiety in this invention. Haptenated proteins, i.e.,<br>
proteins derivatized with haptens, are also suitable for use as a second moiety in<br>
this invention.<br>
Specific proteins include tetanus toxoid (TT), pertussis toxoid (PT), bovine<br>
serum albumin (BSA), lipoproteins, diptheria toxoid (DT), heat shock protein, T-<br>
cell superantigens, protein D, CRM197, and bacterial outer-membrane protein. All<br>
of these protein starting materials may be obtained commercially from biochemical<br>
or pharmaceutical supply companies (e.g., American Tissue Type Collection in<br>
Rockville, MD or Berna Laboratories of Florida) or may be prepared by standard<br>
methodologies, such as those described in J. M. Cruse and R. E. Lewis (Eds.),<br><br>
"Conjugate Vaccines in Contributions to Microbiology and Immunology", Vol. 10<br>
(1989).<br>
D. Methods for Functionalizing the First or Second Moiety with an<br>
Amino-Oxy Group<br>
The amino-oxy (also referred to as oxy-amine, amino-oxy, aminooxy, and<br>
amino-oxy) functional group, NH2-0-R, has a lower pKa than the amines found on<br>
proteins, and is nucleophilic at much lower pH. Amino-oxy groups react well with<br>
carbonyl-containing groups, e.g., aldehydes and ketones, to form highly stable<br>
oximes. The optimum pH for the reaction can range from 4 to 8, for example from<br>
5 to 7. According to one aspect of the invention, the optimum pH is around 5.<br>
Since oximes are stable, the reductive step in the reductive amination process,<br>
discussed above, is optional. The high efficiency of the reaction may result in<br>
shorter reaction times. Furthermore, it is possible to exert some control over the<br>
reaction sites between the complementary reagents. By contrast, the reaction of<br>
hydrazides and amines with groups such as, for example, ketones, is slower and<br>
far less efficient.<br>
The protein and polysaccharide are functionalized with complementary<br>
oxime-forming groups, and reacted to form oxime-linked protein-polysaccharide<br>
conjugate vaccines. According to one aspect of the invention, the protein is<br>
directly linked to the polysaccharide.<br>
According to one embodiment, there is provided a process comprising<br>
combining an amino-oxy homofunctional or heterofunctional reagent with an entity<br>
chosen from polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, carbohydrates, and<br>
carbohydrate-containing molecules containing at least one carbonyl group, to form<br>
a polysaccharide, oligosaccharide, carbohydrate, or carbohydrate-containing<br>
molecule functionalized via at least one oxime linkage. Functionalized means to<br>
add a group which facilitates further reaction, for example, thiol, carboxy, amino-<br><br>
oxy, halogen, aldehydes, and the like. This embodiment may be illustrated by the<br>
following non-limiting illustration ("Ps" denotes a polysaccharide):<br><br>
R is a functional group, e.g., an amino-oxy, amine, thiol, or other chemical group,<br>
such as those listed below, for facilitating coupling to the protein:<br><br>
The at least one pendent functional group is then reacted directly or<br>
indirectly with the protein moiety to yield a protein-polysaccharide conjugate.<br>
According to another embodiment, the protein is functionalized with at least<br>
one pendent amino-oxy group, which is subsequently reacted with a carbonyl<br>
group on a polysaccharide, oligosaccharide, carbohydrate, or carbohydrate-<br>
containing moiety. The carbonyl group is formed with, for example, sodium<br>
periodate. For example, in the case of a polysaccharide, the functionalized<br>
protein is reacted with the polysaccharide to form a protein-polysaccharide<br>
conjugate. The following scheme illustrates a non-limiting aspect of this process:<br><br><br>
Methods for functionalizing a protein with an amino-oxy group are known to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art. The protein can be functionalized with amino-oxy<br>
groups chemically, enzymatically or by genetic engineering. Described herein are<br>
methods for functionalizing the protein on either amines or carboxyl groups, and<br>
for controlling the number of amino-oxy groups on the protein.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the polysaccharide is functionalized with<br>
pendent amino-oxy groups and subsequently reacted with a glycoprotein<br>
containing carbonyl groups. These may be present, for example, by oxidizing the<br>
carbohydrate on the glycoprotein. Aldehydes may be created by selective<br>
oxidation of N-terminal serine or threonine.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, for example when the<br>
polysaccharide, oligosaccharide, carbohydrate, or carbohydrate-containing moiety<br>
is functionalized with an amino-oxy group, the protein advantageously contains at<br>
least one carbonyl group in the form of, e.g., a ketone or aldehyde moiety.<br>
Aldehydes may be created on proteins containing an N-terminal serine or<br>
threonine, and the resulting protein can be reacted with an amino-oxy reagent,<br><br>
thus uniquely functionalizing the N-terminal. This monovalently-functionalized<br>
protein can then be reacted directly, for example, with a carbonyl-containing<br>
polysaccharide, if the amino-oxy reagent is homofunctional or indirectly, using<br>
spacers. N-terminal serine or threonine can occur naturally, or be engineered into<br>
a protein.<br>
In the instances where the protein is functionalized with at least one amino-<br>
oxy group, the polysaccharide, oligosaccharide, or carbohydrate contains at least<br>
one carbonyl group. The carbonyl groups may be a natural part of the<br>
polysaccharide structure, e.g., the reducing end of the polymer, or created, for<br>
example, by oxidation. Reductive amination has been widely used to produce<br>
protein-polysaccharide conjugates. As a result, means to produce carbonyl-<br>
containing polysaccharides are well-known to those versed in the art.<br>
Some polysaccharides contain a reducing sugar on their end, e.g., Hib<br>
PRP and Neisseria PsC. These contain aldehydes as hemiacetals and can be<br>
reacted with amino-oxy reagents. Additional aldehydes may be created by<br>
specific degradation of the polysaccharide. General procedures are described in,<br>
for example, Lindberg et al. "Specific Degradation of Polysaccharides - Adv in<br>
Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry," Tipson et al., eds. Vol 31, pp. 185-<br>
240 (Academic Press, 1975). For example, when PRP is oxidized with sodium<br>
periodate, the polysaccharide chain is cleaved so as to produce oligosaccharides<br>
with an aldehyde on each end.<br>
Many other methods for creating aldehydes are known to those versed in<br>
the art. For example Jennings et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,356,170 entitled<br>
"Immunogenic Polysaccharide-Protein Conjugates"; Tai et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,425,946 entitled "Vaccines against Group C Neisseria Meningitidis"; Porro, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,306,492 entitled "Oligosaccharide Conjugate Vaccines"; Yang et al.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,681,570 entitled "Immunogenic conjugate molecules";<br><br>
Constantino et al., "Development and phase 1 clinical testing of a conjugate<br>
vaccine against meningococcus A and C," Vaccine 10:691 (1992); Laferriere et<br>
al., "The synthesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid<br>
conjugates and the effect of chain length on immunogenicity," Vaccine, 15:179<br>
(1997).<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it may be desirable to add<br>
aldehyde moieties to proteins and/or polysaccharides. Those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will appreciate that there are many acceptable methods for doing so.<br>
Suitable non-limiting examples of methods to add aldehydes to proteins and<br>
polysaccharides include the following:<br>
1.	Hydroxyl groups are reacted with chlorohexanol dimethyl acetal in a<br>
base, and the masked aldehyde is subsequently revealed by mild acid hydrolysis.<br>
Dick et al., Conjugate Vaccines (Eds. Cruse, et al.), pp. 91-93 (1989).<br>
Scheme A<br><br>
2.	Glucouronic lactone and sodium cyanoborohydride are used to<br>
reductively aminate protein amines. Saponification is used to open the lactone.<br>
The sugar is then oxidized to an aldehydes using sodium periodate.<br>
Scheme B<br><br><br>
3.	A carboxylated carbohydrate, for example, glucuronic acid, galactaric<br>
acid, glyceric acid, or tartaric acid is added to protein amines using a carbodiimide<br>
reagent. The glycosylated protein is then oxidized to create aldehyde moieties<br>
using sodium periodate.<br><br>
Galactaric acid	Glucuronic acid<br>
4.	Aldehydes can also be created via enzymatic oxidation, using suitable<br>
oxidizing enzymes such as, for example, glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and<br>
neuraminidase. For example, neuraminidase may be used to remove terminal<br>
sialic acid, followed by galactose oxidase. (Hermanson, Bioconjugation<br>
Techniques, p. 116-117).<br>
5.	Chemical addition of aldehydes to amines on proteins or<br>
polysaccharides can be effected using succinimidyl-p-formyl benzoate or<br>
succinimidyl-p-formylphenoxyacetate. These NHS esters of aldehydes react with<br>
amines and result in the addition of an aldehyde.<br><br><br>
6.	Still another method uses the reaction of a bis-aldehyde (e.g.,<br>
gluteraldehyde) with an amine. (Hermanson, Bioconjugation Techniques, p. 119-<br>
120).<br>
Scheme C<br><br>
7.	Another suitable process is the addition of glyceraldehydes to protein<br>
amines using reductive amination, followed by oxidation with sodium periodate to<br>
create aldehydes.<br>
Optionally, if the conjugate contains residual free amino-oxy groups or<br>
aldehydes, and if it is desired to quench these groups, an additional step may be<br>
taken. One of the methods for quenching a conjugate having an aldehyde is by<br>
reduction, e.g., using sodium borohydride. Alternatively, residual carbonyls may<br>
be quenched with a mono amino-oxy reagent, e.g., amino-oxy-acetate. Residual<br>
amino-oxy groups can be quenched with a monofunctionalcarbonyl, e.g.,<br>
glyceraldehyde, acetone or succinic semialdehyde.<br>
E. Amino-Oxy Reagents<br>
The preparation of conjugate vaccines may be accomplished by the use of<br>
various amino-oxy reagents. A variety of useful homofunctional and<br>
heterofunctional amino-oxy reagents may be prepared by one skilled in the art,<br>
and may also be obtained from Solulink, Inc.™, 9853 Pacific Heights Blvd., Suite<br>
H, San Diego, California 92121, and still others are described in the literature.<br>
Many more can be conceived of and easily synthesized. Toyokuni et al.,<br>
"Synthesis of a new heterofunctional linker, N-[4-(amino-oxy)butyl]maleimide for<br><br>
facile access to a thiol-reactive 18F-labeling agent." Bioconjugate Chem. 14:1253<br>
(2003).<br>
Suitable non-limiting examples of reagents that may be used in accordance<br>
with the present invention include those prepared by Solulink™ (San Diego,<br>
California). For example, bis(amino-oxy)cystamine is a homofunctional amino-<br>
oxy-reagent that can be converted to a heterofunctional thiol-amino-oxy reagent.<br>
"Boc" is the art-recognized acronym for the t-butoxy carbonyl protecting group.<br>
Boc-amino-oxy acetate can be used to synthesize a number of suitable amino-oxy<br>
reagents according to, for example, the following scheme:<br><br>
The ligands identified by R" are suitable, non-limiting examples of<br>
nucleophilic ligands that may be used in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The above reagents are based on 2-(Boc-amino-oxy) acetic acid, available<br>
from Bachem (Prod. No. A4605.005). Other useful starting reagents for making<br>
amino-oxy reagents include N-Boc-hydroxylamine and N-Fmoc-hydroxylamine.<br>
These reagents are available from Aldrich Chemical. N-Boc-Hydroxylamine can<br>
be used to prepare a useful amino-oxy reagent as follows:<br><br><br>
Homofunctional amino-oxy reagents may be used in accordance with the<br>
present invention. Suitable homofunctional amino-oxy reagents that may be used<br>
include, for example, bis(amino-oxy)ethylene diamine, bis(amino-oxy) butane, and<br>
bis(amino-oxy)tetraethylene glycol, all of which are known and can be prepared by<br>
art-recognized methods. For example, bis(amino-oxy)butane may be prepared as<br>
follows:<br><br>
Synthesis of various useful heterofunctional amino-oxy reagents have been<br>
described in the literature, for example Mikolajczyk et al., Bioconjugate Chem.<br>
5:636 (1994) (a maleimide-amino-oxy reagent); Mikola &amp; Hanninen Bioconjugate<br>
Chem. 3:182 (1992) (amino-oxy alklyamines); Webb &amp; Kaneko Bioconjugate<br>
Chem. 1:96 (1990) (amino-oxy- dithionitropyridyl reagents). Jones et al. describe<br>
the synthesis of amino-oxy ethers from N-Boc hydroxylamine and alkyl iodides<br>
and bromides, which provide another route to useful amino-oxy reagents. Dixon &amp;<br>
Weiss, J. Org Chem. 49:4487 (1984), describe bis-amino-oxy reagents that may<br>
be used in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Ketones may be added to amines using, for example, reagents like NHS<br>
levulate (from Solulink™). Carbohydrate groups on a protein, e.g., glycoproteins,<br>
can be oxidized to carbonyls with, for example, sodium periodate. In addition,<br>
reverse proteolysis may be used to add carbonyls or amino-oxy groups as<br>
described in Rose et al., "Preparation of well-defined protein conjugates using<br>
enzyme-assisted reverse proteolysis," Bioconjugate Chem. 2:154 (1991). N-<br><br>
terminal threonines or serines on proteins may be selectively oxidized to<br>
aldehydes.<br>
Small linker molecules may also be used to functionalize proteins and<br>
polysaccharides with amino-oxy groups. See, for example, Vilaseca et al.,<br>
"Protein conjugates of defined structure: synthesis and use of a new carrier<br>
molecule," Bioconj. Chem. 4:515 (1993); and Jones et al., "Synthesis of UP 993,<br>
a multivalent conjugate of the N-terminal domain of b2GPI and suppression of an<br>
anti-b2GPI immune response," Bioconj. Chem. 12:1012 (2001).<br>
As is known to those of ordinary skill in the art, amino-oxy, aminooxy,<br>
aminoxy, and oxy-amine are all synonymous terms.<br>
F. Indirect Conjugation<br>
As stated above, the conjugation between the first moiety and the second<br>
moiety may proceed either indirectly or directly. In certain instances, the process<br>
of combining a protein and a polysaccharide may lead to undesirable side effects.<br>
In some cases, direct coupling can place the protein and the polysaccharide in<br>
very close proximity to one another and encourage the formation of excessive<br>
crosslinks between the protein and the polysaccharide. Under the extreme of<br>
such conditions, the resultant material can become very thick (e.g., in a gelled<br>
state).<br>
Over-crosslinking also can result in decreased immunogenicity of the<br>
protein and polysaccharide components. In addition, the crosslinking process can<br>
result in the introduction of foreign epitopes into the conjugate or can otherwise be<br>
detrimental to production of a useful vaccine. The introduction of excessive<br>
crosslinks exacerbates this problem.<br>
Control of crosslinking between the protein and the polysaccharide can be<br>
controlled by the number of active groups on each, concentration, pH, buffer<br><br>
composition, temperature, the use of spacers and/or charge, and other means<br>
well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For example, a spacer may be provided between the protein and<br>
polysaccharide in order to control the degree of crosslinking. The spacer helps<br>
maintain physical separation between the protein and polysaccharide molecules,<br>
and it can be used to limit the number of crosslinks between the protein and<br>
polysaccharide. As an additional advantage, spacers also can be used to control<br>
the structure of the resultant conjugate. If a conjugate does not have the correct<br>
structure, problems can result that can adversely affect the immunogenicity of the<br>
conjugate material. The speed of coupling, either too fast or too slow, also can<br>
affect the overall yield, structure, and immunogenicity of the resulting conjugate<br>
product. Schneerson etal., Journal of Experimental Medicine, 152:361 (1980).<br>
G. Vaccine Compositions<br>
This invention further relates to vaccines and other immunological reagents<br>
that can be prepared from the conjugates produced by the method in accordance<br>
with the invention. For example, to produce a vaccine or other immunological<br>
reagent, the conjugates produced by the method according to the invention may<br>
be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable medium or delivery vehicle by<br>
conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art. Such vaccines or<br>
immunological reagents will contain an effective therapeutic amount of the<br>
conjugate according to the invention, together with a suitable amount of vehicle so<br>
as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. These vaccines<br>
may include alum or other adjuvants.<br>
Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable media or vehicles include, for<br>
example, sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum,<br>
animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil,<br>
sesame oil, and the like. Saline is a preferred vehicle when the pharmaceutical<br><br>
composition is administered intravenously. Aqueous dextrose and glycerol<br>
solutions can be employed as liquid vehicles, particularly for injectable solutions.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical vehicles are well known in the art, such as those<br>
described in E. W. Martin, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences.<br>
The vaccines that may be prepared in accordance with the invention<br>
include, but are not limited, to Diphtheria vaccine; Pertussis (subunit) vaccine;<br>
Tetanus vaccine; H. influenzae type b (polyribose phosphate); S. pneumoniae, all<br>
serotypes; E. coli, endotoxin or J5 antigen (LPS, Lipid A, and Gentabiose); E. coli,<br>
O polysaccharides (serotype specific); Klebsiella, polysaccharides (serotype<br>
specific); S. aureus, types 5 and 8 (serotype specific and common protective<br>
antigens); S. epidermidis, serotype polysaccharide I, II, and III (and common<br>
protective antigens); N. meningitidis, serotype specific or protein antigens; Polio<br>
vaccine; Mumps, measles, rubella vaccine; Respiratory syncytial virus; Rabies;<br>
Hepatitis A, B, C, and others; Human immunodeficiency virus I and II (GP120,<br>

Group B streptococcus, serotypes, la, lb, II, and III; Pseudomonas aeroginosa<br>
(serotype specific); Rhinovirus; Parainfluenzae (types 1, 2, and 3); Coronaviruses;<br>
Salmonella; Shigella; Rotavirus; Enteroviruses; Chlamydia trachomatis and<br>
pneumoniae (TWAR); and Cryptococcus neoformans.<br>
The invention also relates to the treatment of a patient by administering an<br>
immunostimulatory amount of the vaccine. The term "patient" refers to any<br>
subject for whom the treatment may be beneficial and includes mammals,<br>
especially humans, horses, cows, pigs, sheep, deer, dogs, and cats, as well as<br>
other animals, such as chickens. An "immunostimulatory amount" refers to that<br><br>
amount of vaccine that is able to stimulate the immune response of the patient for<br>
prevention, amelioration, or treatment of diseases. The vaccines of the invention<br>
may be administered by any suitable route, but they preferably are administered<br>
by intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal, or subcutaneous injection. For<br>
example, carbohydrate-based vaccines can be used in cancer therapy.<br>
In addition, the vaccines and immunological reagents according to the<br>
invention can be administered for any suitable purpose, such as for therapeutic,<br>
prophylactic, or diagnostic purposes.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of preparing an immunotherapeutic<br>
agent against infections caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, or chemicals<br>
by immunizing a patient with the vaccine described above so that the donor<br>
produces antibodies directed against the vaccine. Antibodies may be isolated or<br>
B cells may be obtained to later fuse with myeloma cells to make monoclonal<br>
antibodies. The making of monoclonal antibodies is generally known in the art<br>
(see Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975)). As used herein, "immunotherapeutic<br>
agent" refers to a composition of antibodies that are directed against specific<br>
immunogens for use in passive treatment of patients. A plasma donor is any<br>
subject that is injected with a vaccine for the production of antibodies against the<br>
immunogens contained in the vaccine.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Preparation of an Amino-Oxy Functionalized Protein<br>
The following example illustrates the preparation of an amino-oxy<br>
functionalized protein that can be conjugated to a polysaccharide. Bovine serum<br>
albumin (BSA) was used as a model protein.<br>
Bis(amino-oxy)tetraethylene glycol was linked to carboxyl groups on bovine<br>
serum albumin (BSA) with carbodiimide. Monomer BSA was prepared as<br>
described in (Lees et al., Vaccine 14:190, 1996). Bis(amino-oxy)tetraethylene<br><br>
glycol (85 mg) (prepared by Solulink™, MW 361) was made up in 850 ul of 0.5 M<br>
HCI. 5 N NaOH was added to adjust to a pH -4.5. 1 ml of BSA mono (42.2<br>
mg/ml in saline) was added. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 25 ul of<br>
freshly prepared EDC (1-(3-dimethylamino)propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride, 100 mg/ml in water). After approximately 3 hours, the solution was<br>
dialyzed overnight against saline at 4°C. The solution was then made up to 4 ml<br>
with saline and concentrated with an Amicon Ultra 4™ centrifugal device (30 kDa<br>
cutoff) to -0.5 ml, and was further desalted on a 1x15 cm G-10 column<br>
(Pharmacia) equilibrated with saline. The void volume fraction was then<br>
concentrated to - 1ml using the Amicon Ultra 4™ device. Using the BCA assay<br>
(Pierce Chemical Co), the protein concentration was estimated to be 34 mg/ml<br>
BSA. Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid assay gave an intense red/orange, indicating<br>
the presence of amino-oxy group.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of an Amino-Oxy Derivatized Polysaccharide<br>
The following example illustrates the preparation of any amino-oxy<br>
functionalized polysaccharide that can be conjugated to a protein, peptide, or<br>
hapten.<br>
Pn14 (10 ml at 5 mg/ml in water) was activated by the addition of 40 mg of<br>
CDAP (100 mg/ml stock in acetonitrile), followed by triethylamine to raise the pH<br>
to 9.4. After approximately 2.5 minutes, 4 ml of 0.5 M hexanediamine (pH 9.4)<br>
was added. The reaction was permitted to proceed for about 2 hours. Excess<br>
reagent was then removed by dialysis against saline to yield amino-Pn14.<br>
Amino-Pn14 was then reacted with excess NHS bromoacetate at pH 8 and<br>
dialyzed against saline in the dark at 4°C. The bromoacetylated Pn14 was<br>
concentrated by pressure filtration and then dialyzed against water.<br>
Amino-oxy cysteamine was prepared from bis amino-oxy cystamine by<br>
TCEP reduction followed by ion exchange on a Dowex 1X-8 column as follows:<br><br>
Bis(amino-oxy)cystamine (obtained from Solulink)was made up in 50%<br>
NMP/water at 0.1 M. TCEP was made up in water at 0.5 M and 3x molar<br>
equivalents of 1 M sodium bicarbonate was added. A 1.5 molar excess of TCEP<br>
was combined with Bis(AO)cystamine, and adjusted to pH ~7 with sodium<br>
carbonate. After 10 minutes, the mixture was diluted 5-fold into 10 mM bistris at<br>
pH 5. The reaction mixture was applied to a 1x3 cm Dowex 1-x8 column that had<br>
been washed with 1 M NaCI and equilibrated with 10 mM bistris, pH 5. The<br>
reduced amino-oxy cysteamine is found in the flow through of the column.<br>
Amino-oxy cysteamine was added to the bromoacetylated Pn14 and<br>
reacted at pH 8 in the dark. The reaction mixture was then concentrated,<br>
diafiltered, and then dialyzed against water.<br>
Pn14 concentration was determined to be 9.1 mg/ml by the<br>
resorcinol/sulfuric acid method. Using the TNBS assay and amino-oxy acetate as<br>
the standard, the amino-oxy concentration was estimated at 0.74 mM, resulting in<br>
about 8 amino-oxy groups per 100 kDa of polysaccharide.<br>
Example 3: Preparation of a BSA-Dextran Conjugate<br>
The following example illustrates the preparation of a conjugate vaccine<br>
using an amino-oxy functionalized protein and an oxidized polysaccharide.<br>
Specifically, the amino-oxy functionalized BSA prepared in Example 2 was linked<br>
to oxidized dextran.<br>
Dextran was oxidized using sodium periodate as follows: A 10 mg/ml<br>
solution of T2000 dextran (Pharmacia) was made to 10 mM in sodium acetate, pH<br>
5 and then 10 mM sodium periodate (from a 0.5 M stock in water), and incubated<br>
at room temperature in the dark. At 1, 5, 10 and 15 min, an aliquot was removed,<br>
quenched by the addition of glycerol, and dialyzed against water in the dark. The<br>
final concentration of dextran was determined to be about 4.5 mg/ml.<br><br>
The protein was conjugated to the polysaccharide as follows: 110 µl of<br>
each oxidized dextran preparation (1-15 min oxidation) was combined with 15 µl<br>
BSA- amino-oxy (0.5 mg each). After an overnight reaction in the dark at room<br>
temperature, the samples were analyzed by SDS PAGE (4-12% gradient gel,<br>
NuPAGE, Invitrogen). With reference to Figure 1, lanes are conjugates prepared<br>
with (A) dex ox 1 min; (B) dex ox 5 min; (C) dex ox 10 min; (D) dex ox 15 min;<br>
BSA- amino-oxy only. It is evident that each of the conjugation reactions resulted<br>
in high molecular weight material that did not enter the gel. Essentially no<br>
unconjugated protein is evident, indicating a high degree of conjugation.<br>
The four conjugates were pooled &amp; fractionated on a S-400HR™ gel<br>
filtration column (1x60 cm), equilibrated with saline. The void volume fractions<br>
were pooled and assayed for protein and polysaccharide. It was determined that<br>
the pool contained 0.21 mg/ml BSA and 0.27 mg/ml dextran. At least 50% of the<br>
initial protein and polysaccharide were recovered. Thus, the amino-oxy-protein<br>
with oxidized polysaccharide yielded soluble conjugate in excellent yield.<br>
Example 4: Preparation of AO-Functionalized TT.<br>
The following hypothetical example illustrates the preparation of Tetanus<br>
toxoid derivatized with amino-oxy groups using a two-step method.<br>
1 ml tetanus toxoid (10 mg/ml) in 2 M NaCI is made to pH 8 by the addition<br>
of 50 µl 1 M HEPES, pH 8. The protein is bromoacetylated by the addition of 7 µl<br>
of 0.1 M NHS bromoacetate. After a 1 hour incubation, 2 µmoles of<br>
aminocysteamine is added. After an overnight reaction, excess reagent is<br>
removed by dialysis against 2 M NaCI.<br>
The protein concentration is determined using the BCA assay (Pierce<br>
Chemical) and the presence of the amino-oxy group confirmed using TNBS.<br><br>
Example 5: Preparation of amino-oxy-derivatized BSA using a two-step<br>
method<br>
Bromoacetylation of BSA:<br>
4.1 ml of monomeric BSA (48.5 mg/ml) was made to pH 8 by the addition<br>
of 400 µl 1 M HEPES, pH 8 and 5.5 ml water. 1 ml of 0.2 M NHS bromoacetate<br>
(ProChem) in NMP was slowly added while vortexing. After an overnight reaction<br>
at room temperature in the dark, the solution was dialyzed against saline for 2<br>
days, centrifuged and filtered. 10.6 ml of BSA at 15.3 mg/ml was obtained.<br>
Preparation of Amino-oxy cysteamine:<br>
51.5 mg of Bisaminoxocystamine was added to a solution of 56 mg TCEP<br>
made up in 1.1 ml 1 M sodium carbonate, 586 µl DMSO, and 586 µl water. After<br>
15 minutes, the TCEP was removed on a 1x5 cm Dowex 1x-8 column,<br>
equilibrated with 10 mM Bistris, pH 6. The DTNB positive flow thru was pooled<br>
and found to be 22.6 mM thiol.<br>
6 ml was added to the bromoacetylated BSA and the pH adjusted to 8. The<br>
reaction was allowed to proceed overnight in the dark, and was then dialyzed for 2<br>
days at 4° C against multiple changes of saline. The amino-oxy BSA was<br>
determined to be about 8.6 mg/ml. Reaction of an aliquot with TNBS at pH 8 gave<br>
an orangish color, indicating the presence of the amino-oxy group.<br>
Example 6: Use of CDAP to Prepare Amino-Oxy Derivatized<br>
Polysaccharide and Amino-oxy Conjugates<br>
This experiment illustrates the use of CDAP to prepare amino-oxy<br>
derivatized polysaccharide and amino-oxy conjugates. It illustrates how chemistry<br>
other than oxidation can be used to functionalize a polysaccharide with amino-oxy<br>
groups.<br><br>
I.	Preparation of an amino-oxy derivatized polysaccharide using CDAP<br>
chemistry<br>
A solution of bifunctional amino-oxy reagent was prepared by solubilizing<br>
29 mg of bis-amino-oxy acetate (ethylene diamine) (prepared by Solulink™) in<br>
200 µl 1 M NaAc, pH 5. Dextran was activated using CDAP chemistry as follows.<br>
To a solution of 0.5 ml T2000 dextran at 10 mg/ml in water, 25 ul of CDAP<br>
(100mg/ml acetonitrile) was added and 30 seconds later the pH was raised by the<br>
addition of 25 pi 0.2 M triethylamine (TEA) and three 5 µl of TEA neat.<br>
At 2.5 minutes, the pH was reduced by the addition of 100 µl 1 M NaAc, pH<br>
5. 200 µl of the BisAO solution was then added. After ~30 minutes reaction, the<br>
solution was desalted on a 1 x 15 cm P6DG column (BioRad) equilibrated with<br>
NaAc buffer (10 mM NaAc, 150 mM NaCI, 5 mM EDTA, pH 5). The desalted<br>
polysaccharide was estimated at 1.7 mg/ml dextran, using the resorcinol assay,<br>
and about 11 amino-oxy groups/100 kDa dex using a TNBS assay.<br>
II.	Preparation of oxidized ovalbumin<br>
To a 0.4 ml solution of ovalbumin (14.4 mg) (OVA), 10 µl of 1 M sodium<br>
acetate, pH 5 was added, followed by the addition of 10 µl 0.5 M sodium periodate<br>
(in water). After a 15 minutes incubation at room temperature in the dark, the<br>
reaction was quenched with the addition of a few drops of 50% glycerol. The<br>
reaction mixture was then dialyzed in the dark against NaAc buffer. By adsorption<br>
at 280 nm, the concentration of oxidized ovalbumin ("OVA(ox)") was 6.6 mg/ml.<br>
III.	Preparation of conjugates and controls<br>
The following solutions were prepared and each was incubated overnight at<br>
room temperature in the dark:<br>
A.	500 µl Dex AO (0.85 mg) + 75 µl OVA(ox) + 100 µl 1 M NaAc pH 5.<br>
B.	250 µl Dex AO (0.0.43 mg) + 37.5 µl NaAc buffer + 50 µl 1 M NaAc<br>
C.	250 µl NaAc buffer + 37.5 µl OVA(ox) + 50 µl 1 M NaAc.<br><br>
Each was then assayed by SDS PAGE and SEC HPLC. Only sample A<br>
contained high molecular weight (HMW) material, with ~ 20% of protein<br>
conjugated, as estimated by SEC HPLC. Neither B nor C indicated any HMW<br>
material by SEC HPLC or SDS PAGE.<br>
Example 7: Use of Cyanogen Bromide to Label Polysaccharide with a Bis-<br>
Amino-Oxy Reagent.<br>
This prophetic example demonstrates the derivatization of a polysaccharide<br>
with an amino-oxy reagent using cyanogen bromide (CNBr).<br>
Polysaccharide (e.g., Pn-14) is made up at 10 mg/ml in water, and is<br>
treated with CNBr at 1 mg per mg of polysaccharide at pH 10.5 for 6 minutes in a<br>
pH-stat. The reaction mixture is then reduced to ~pH 7 by the addition of 0.5 M<br>
bis-amino-oxy reagent (e.g., bis-AO(EDA). After an overnight reaction, the<br>
solution is dialyzed into water and assayed for amino-oxy groups with TNBS, and<br>
for carbohydrates with the resorcinol assay. This amino-oxy derivatized<br>
polysaccharide is used for conjugation with a carbonyl-containing protein.<br>
According to another embodiment, the CNBr-activated polysaccharide can<br>
be reacted with amino-oxy acetate. This will result in a polysaccharide<br>
functionalized with carboxyl groups. The carboxyl groups can then be further<br>
functionalized and indirectly or directly linked to proteins (with, for example,<br>
carbodiimide).<br>
Example 8: Conjugation of Amino-Oxy Derivatized Protein with<br>
Oxidized Polysaccharide<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of amino-oxy derivatized protein<br>
with the functionalization occuring on the amines. This amino-oxy derivatized<br>
protein is then covalently linked to the clinically relevant polysaccharides Neisseria<br>
meningididis A and C.<br><br>
I. Functionalization of protein with amino-oxy groups of a protein on its<br>
amines (protein with pendent amino-oxy groups on amines)<br>
Amines on the protein are bromoacetylated and then reacted with a thiol-<br>
amino-oxy reagent to produce a protein with pendent amino-oxy groups.<br>
Bis(amino-oxy acetate)cystamine 2HCI was prepared by Solulink.™ Monomeric<br>
BSA was at 42.2 mg/ml. NHS bromoacetate was obtained from Prochem and<br>
made up at 0.1 M in NMP (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone). The amino-oxy protein was<br>
prepared as follows. In each of 2 tubes, a solution of 0.5 ml of BSA (21.1 mg) and<br>
250 ul H2O + 100 µl 1 M HEPES, pH 8 was prepared. One tube was reacted with<br>
a 30 fold molar excess of NHS bromoacetate (93 pi) and the other at a 10 fold<br>
molar excess (31 µl).<br>
After about 1 hr, each was made up to 15 ml with sodium acetate buffer (10<br>
mM NaAc, 0.15 M NaCI, 5 mM EDTA, pH 5) and concentrated to about 200 pi<br>
using an Amicon Ultra 15™ device (30 kDa cutoff).<br>
Amino-oxy acetate cysteamine was prepared as follows:<br>
To a solution of 9.8 mg of Bis(AOAc)cystamine (prepared by Solulink™) in<br>
114 Ml 1 M sodium acetate + 114 µl NMP, 22.8 µl of 0.25 M TCEP in 1 M HEPES,<br>
pH 8 was added as a reducing agent. After 1 hour, the partially reduced amino-<br>
oxy thiol reagent was added to each of the bromoacetylated BSA preparations,<br>
the pH was adjusted to about pH 8 and the reaction allowed to proceed overnight<br>
in the dark at 4°C.<br>
Each was desalted using the Amicon Ultra 15™ device by making volume<br>
up to 15 ml with NaAc buffer and centrifuging. The desalting process was<br>
repeated four times. The final volume was about 200 pi and was then made up to<br>
about 1 ml with NaAc buffer. This product was termed BSA-S-AO. By<br>
adsorbance at 280 nm, the 30x prep was determined to be 29.8 mg/ml and the<br>
10x prep 24.8 mg/ml.<br><br>
II.	Preparation of oxidized Neisseria meninqiditis polysaccharide A and C<br>
(Neiss PsA and Neiss PsC)<br>
Neiss PsA and PsC were solubilized overnight at room temperature at 10<br>
mg/ml in water and then stored at 4°C. 50 ul of 1 M sodium acetate, pH 5, was<br>
added to 1 ml of each polysaccharide solution, followed by the addition of 25 pi<br>
0.5 M sodium periodate (0.5 M in water). After 10 minutes in the dark at room<br>
temperature, each was dialyzed 4 hours against 4 I water. Each was then made<br>
up to 4 ml with water and further desalted using an Amicon Ultra 4™ device (30<br>
kDa cutoff). Using the resorcinol assay, the oxidized Neiss PsA was determined<br>
to be 12.1 mg/ml and the oxidized Neiss PsC was 17.8 mg/ml.<br>
III.	Conjugation of BSA-S-AQ with oxidized Neiss PsA and PsC<br>
The following mixtures of BSA-S-AO and oxidized PsA and PsC were<br>
prepared.<br><br>
After an overnight reaction at room temperature in the dark, conjugates<br>
were assayed by SDS PAGE using a Phast gel (8-25%)(Pharmacia) under<br>
reducing conditions. With reference to Figure 2, from left to right the lanes are<br>
BSA30x-PsA, BSA30x-PsC, BSA30x, BSA10x-PsA, BSA10x-PsC, BSA10x. It is<br>
seen that there is a significant amount of high molecular weight materials that did<br>
not enter the gel, indicating that conjugation of the protein to the polysaccharide<br>
occurred.<br><br>
The PsA conjugates were pooled and fractionated by gel filtration on a S-<br>
400HR column (1x60 cm, Pharmacia), equilibrated with saline. Similarly, the PsC<br>
conjugates were pooled and fractionated. Approximately 1 ml fractions were<br>
collected and assayed for protein (by absorbance) and for carbohydrate using the<br>
resorcinol assay. The results are provided in Figure 3.<br>
For the PsC conjugate, tubes 18-22 were pooled and for the PsA<br>
conjugate, tubes 19-23 were pooled and examined by SDS PAGE using reducing<br>
conditions.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, the BSA-Neiss PsC conjugate is on the left and<br>
the PsA conjugate is next to it. On the right is the molecular weight standard. A<br>
small amount of free BSA is observed in each, indicating incomplete separation of<br>
the conjugated and free protein. Each contains a significant amount of conjugated<br>
high molecular weight material that did enter the gel.<br>
Example 9: Preparation of (BSA-Levulate)-Amino-Oxy-Pn14 Conjugate<br>
This example illustrates the reaction of an amino-oxy group with a ketone<br>
and shows that this can be used for the formation of conjugates and, more<br>
specifically, the preparation of (BSA-Levulate)-Amino-oxy Pn14.<br>
NHS Levulate was obtained from Solulink and made up by solubilizing 5.1<br>
mg in 100 µl NMP. This was slowly added to a vortexed solution of 200 pi BSA at<br>
48.5 mg/ml, 200 µl water, and 100 µl 1 M HEPES, pH 8. After an overnight<br>
reaction, the mixture was diafiltered using an Amicon Ultra 15 device, (30 kDa<br>
cutoff). The final volume was 0.5 ml. This product is BSA-LEV<br>
100 µl of BSA-LEV was combined with 300 µl of amino-oxy Pn14 (4.5<br>
mg/ml Pn14) and incubated for several days in the dark. The conjugate and the<br>
individual components were assayed by SEC HPLC using a Superose 6 column<br>
(Pharmacia). The conjugate was then fractionated on an S400HR column.<br>
Protein was assayed using the Bradford dye method, and polysaccharide with the<br><br>
resorcinol method. The high molecular weight fraction was found to contain 0.6<br>
mg BSA/mg Pn14.<br>
Example 10: Preparation of Amino-oxy-BSA- Neisseria PsC Conjugate<br>
Neiss PsC was oxidized to create terminal aldehyde as generally<br>
described in Jennings &amp; Lugowski J. Imm. 127:1011 (1981). SEC HPLC indicated<br>
the molecular weight of the PsC was significantly reduced.<br>
After overnight conjugation of PsC and BSA-AO, analysis was conducted<br>
via SEC HPLC Superose 6 0.5 ml/min. The conjugate was fractionated on a<br>
1x60cm S200HR column, equilibrated 10 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM NaCI, 2<br>
mM EDTA, pH 5. It was determined by both SEC analysis and gel filtration that<br>
most of BSA was conjugated. The high molecular weight peak was analyzed for<br>
protein and carbohydrate and determined to contain 0.2 mg BSA/mg PsC.<br>
Example 11: Preparation of amino-oxy-BSA - Neisseria PsA conjugate<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of a Neisseria PsA-BSA conjugate<br>
by way of functionalizing the protein with an amino-oxy group.<br>
Neiss PsA was terminally reduced to an alditol with NaBH4 and then<br>
oxidized to create terminal aldehyde as generally described in Jennings &amp;<br>
Lugowski J. Imm. 127:1011 (1981).<br>
Neisseria PsA was solubilized in water at 20 mg/ml for 15 min. To 1 ml of<br>
the solubilized polysaccharide, 10 mg of sodium borohydride was added. The pH<br>
was maintained to about 8-9. After 1 hour, 100 µl of 1 M NaAc was added, and<br>
the pH was adjusted to 5. The reduced PsA was desalted on a 1x15 cm G10<br>
column, equilibrated with saline, and the void volume fraction concentrated with<br>
an Amicon Ultra 4(10 kDa cutoff device) to about 1 ml. 20 mg of solid sodium<br>
periodate was added, along with 100 µl 1 M sodium acetate at pH 5. After a 15<br>
minute oxidation in the dark at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by<br>
the addition of a drop of glycerol and then desalted on 1x15cm G10 column<br><br>
equilibrated with 10 mM NaAC, 150 mM NaCI and 2 mM EDTA, pH 5 (acetate<br>
buffer). The void volume was pooled and found to be positive in the BCA assay,<br>
indicating the presence of reducing sugar. The material was diafiltered and<br>
concentrated with an Ultra 4 device into acetate buffer.<br>
Both the amino-oxy BSA and the PsA(red/ox) were examined by SEC<br>
HPLC. The molecular weight of the PsA was markedly reduced by the<br>
reduction/oxidation process.<br>
Conjugation<br>
In the conjugation step, 150 µl amino-oxy-BSA at 6 mg/ml was combined<br>
with 50 ul PsA (red/ox) and 25 µl 1 M NaAc at pH 5.<br>
After an overnight incubation in the dark at 4°C, the conjugate was<br>
analyzed by SEC HPLC (Superose6, saline, 0.5 ml/min). It was seen that the PsA<br>
contributed very little absorbance and the AO-BSA increased in molecular weight<br>
on conjugation.<br>
The conjugate was fractionated on a 1x60cm S200HR gel filtration column<br>
and the high molecular weight fraction assayed for protein and PsA and was<br>
found to contain 0.4 mg BSA/mg PsA.<br>
Conclusion: The reduction/oxidation method works well to create<br>
aldehydes that can be linked to amino-oxy-protein. PsA was probably hydrolyzed<br>
during the NaBH4 step, which is at elevated pH.<br>
Example 12: Preparation of PRP(ox)-BSA-AO Conjugate<br>
1. Oxidation of PRP Hib<br>
22.7 mg PRP Hib was made up at 10 mg/ml in water, and combined with<br>
100 µl 1 M NaAc and 46 µl 0.5 M sodium periodate. The reaction proceeded in<br>
the dark and on ice for 15 minutes, and was then quenched with 50% glycerol.<br>
The reaction mixture was diafiltered into water with an Amicon Ultra 4 (10 kDa<br>
cutoff) device, 4 x 4ml, final volume was approximately 1 ml. A resorcinol assay<br><br>
was conducted at 10 mg/ml. The sample was positive in the BCA assay,<br>
indicating the presence of aldehyde.<br>
2.	Conjugation amino-oxy BSA<br>
AO-S-BSA was provided at 15 mg/ml. 667 µl BSA-S-AO 10 mg was<br>
combined with 100 µl 1 M sodium acetate, at pH 5, and approximately 1 ml<br>
PRP(ox), and the reaction was permitted to proceed overnight in the dark. It was<br>
then quenched by the addition of 50 µl 0.25 M amino-oxy acetate.<br>
3.	Assay by SEC Superose6 prep grade HR10/30, equilibrated PBS 0.5<br>
ml/min, OP 220.<br>
Here, 0.5 ml conjugate was fractionated on 1x60 cm S200HR, and<br>
equilibrated PBS. All fractions eluted before BSA, indicating higher MW.<br><br>
Example 13: Preparation of BSA-Pn14 Conjugate via Oxidation of<br>
Glycidic Acid<br>
This example illustrates a protocol whereby glycidic acid was added to<br>
amines on BSA using carbodiimide. The glycidic acid on the protein was then<br>
oxidized and reacted with amino-oxy-Pn14.<br>
I. BSA-Glycidic acid<br>
Monomeric BSA and glycidic acid (obtained from Fluka Chemical) were<br>
combined to a final concentration in water of 12.5 mg/ml and 28 mg/ml,<br>
respectively. The pH was adjusted to about 5 and 220 µl of 100 mg/ml EDC in<br>
water was added. The pH is kept at about 5 for approximately 1.5 hours, and the<br><br>
reaction was quenched by the addition of .025 ml 1 M sodium acetate at pH 5.<br>
The reaction mixture is then dialyzed against saline at 4°C overnight.<br>
II. Oxidation of BSA-glycidic acid<br>
100 µl of 1 M sodium acetate at pH 5 was added to 1 ml of BSA-glycidic<br>
acid (7.8 mg/ml), followed by 25 µl of 0.5 M sodium periodate in water. After 10<br>
minutes in the dark, glycerol was added to quench the reaction and excess<br>
reagent removed using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal device with a 30 kDa cutoff.<br>
The final volume was about 400 µl.<br>
100 µl of the oxidized BSA-glycidic acid was combined with 250 ul of<br>
amino-oxy Pn 14 at 9.3 mg/ml along with 50 µl 1 M sodium acetate at pH 5. An<br>
aliquot was evaluated by SEC HPLC (Superose 6 0.5 ml/min, PBS). After an<br>
overnight reaction, another aliquot was assayed in the same way. It was seen<br>
that a significant portion of the absorbance eluted at the void volume (-15<br>
minutes), indicating that the protein was linked to the high molecular weight Pn14.<br>
Following gel filtration on an S400HR column (Pharmacia), the high<br>
molecular weight fraction was determined to contain 0.3 mg BSA/mg Pn14. This<br>
ratio is similar to that determined from the percentage of conjugated high<br>
molecular weight protein in the above chromatogram.<br>
Thus, the method of linking glycidic acid to protein using carbodiimide<br>
provides a way to create aldehydes on proteins that can be subsequently linked to<br>
amino-oxy groups.<br>
Example 14: Use of Amino-Oxy Chemistry to link BSA to Dextran<br>
This example illustrates the coupling of an oligosaccharide via its reducing<br>
end to amino-oxy derivatized protein.<br>
T40 dextran was made up at 100 mg/ml in water. The number of reducing<br>
ends was estimated using the BCA assay with glucose as the standard. It was<br><br>
found that there were 3.5 mM reducing ends/100 mg/ml T40 dextran, so the<br>
average molecular weight was taken to be approximately 28,000 kDa<br>
5 mg amino-oxy BSA containing ~8 amino-oxy/BSA was combined with 2<br>
ratios of T40 dextran at pH 5.<br>
(A)	830 µl BSA-AO 15.3 mg/ml was combined with 620 ul T40 dextran at<br>
100 mg/ml and 100 µl 1 M NaAc at pH 5.<br>
(B)	830 µl BSA-AO 15.3 mg/ml was combined with 3.1 ml T40 dextran at<br>
100 mg/ml and 500 µl 1 M NaAc at pH 5.<br>
Solutions were reacted at room temperature in the dark for 1 week, and<br>
then assayed by SEC HPLC.<br>
. Both conjugates eluted much earlier than BSA-AO, indicating that their<br>
molecular weight has increased. Conjugates were then fractionated by anion ion<br>
exchange (IEX). Consistent with the SEC profile, the higher the molecular weight,<br>
the lower ionic strength the conjugate eluted. IEX elution fractions were analyzed<br>
for the ratio of carbohydrate to protein and plotted on both a weight and mole ratio<br>
(using 28 kDa MW for the T40 dextran)<br>
The peak fraction from each IEX elution was analyzed by SEC HPLC<br>
(Superose 6 1 ml/min). The absence of monomeric BSA and the increasing MW<br>
for high vs. low ratio T40dex/BSA conjugates. SDS PAGE confirmed the high<br>
molecular weight nature of the conjugate IEX eluants.<br>
Example 15: Use of Amino-Oxy Chemistry to Link Oligosaccharide<br>
and Protein<br>
This example demonstrates the use of amino-oxy chemistry to link an<br>
oligosaccharide indirectly via its reducing end to a protein. A general description<br>
of the protocol is as follows. The reducing end of T40 dextran (-40 kDa MW) was<br>
reacted with the amino-oxy group of amino-oxy acetate to create a dextran with a<br>
single carboxyl group on one end. This carboxy group was then converted to an<br><br>
amine by reaction with ethylenediamine and carbodiimide. The amine-tipped<br>
dextran was then thiolated and reacted with maleimide-derivatized BSA, to create<br>
a conjugate consisting of a protein with "threads" of carbohydrate extending from<br>
it.<br>
I. Addition of amino-oxy acetate to the reducing end of dextran<br>
850 mg of T40 dextran (Pharmacia) was solubilized in 850 µl of water<br>
overnight at room temperature.<br>
235 mg of amino-oxy acetate was solubilized in a mixture of 850 µl DMSO<br>
and 500 µl 1 M sodium acetate, pH 5 and combined with the T40 dextran solution.<br>
An additional 500 µl of DMSO was added to make the solution approximately 50%<br>
DMSO. After an incubation at about 68°C for about 6 hours, the solution was<br>
extensively dialyzed against water. The product was dextran containing a single<br>
carboxyl group on its reducing end.<br>
1.8 g of ethylenediamine 2HCI was added to the solution (approximately 22<br>
ml) and the pH adjusted to approximately 5 with 1 N NaOH. 220 mg of EDC (1-(3-<br>
dimethylamino)propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride) was added and the pH<br>
maintained at about 5 for 3 hours. The reaction was then quenched by the<br>
addition of 1 M sodium acetate, pH 5, dialyzed against saline, and concentrated<br>
using an Amicon Ultra 15™ (10 kDa cutoff). It was then further dialyzed against<br>
saline and then against water.<br>
The product was assayed for amines using TNBS and for carbohydrate<br>
using the resorcinol assay. It was determined that there were approximately 0.45<br>
amines per 40,000 kDa of dextran. This product was dextran containing a single<br>
amine group on its reducing end and was termed NH2-AOAc-T40 dextran. Using<br>
the resorcinol assay, the solution was determined to have a concentration of<br>
about 119 mg/ml dextran. T40 dextran consists of a distribution of molecular<br><br>
weights, which makes it difficult to determine the actual degree of substitution of<br>
the reducing ends of the polymers.<br>
II. Thiolated dextran and maleimide- BSA<br>
Maleimide-derivatized BSA was prepared as follows: GMBS (40 µl of a 0.1<br>
M stock in NMP) was added to a solution of 200 ul of monomeric BSA (42.2<br>
mg/ml), 50 µl 0.75 M HEPES, 5 mM EDTA at pH 7.3, and 100 µl water. After a 2<br>
hour reaction, the pH was reduced by the addition of 100 µl 1 M sodium acetate,<br>
at pH 5. The solution was desalted using an Amicon Ultra 4™ (30 kDa cutoff)<br>
ultrafiltration device and 10 mM NaAc, 0.15 M NaCI, 5 mM EDTA, pH 5.<br>
The NH2-AOAc-T40 dextran was thiolated using SPDP as follows: 0.5 ml<br>
of the NH2-AOAc-T40 dextran was combined with 100 µl of 1 M HEPES, pH 8 and<br>
100 µl of 0.1 M SPDP were added. After approximately 2 hours, 50 µl of 0.1 M<br>
EDTA pH 5 was added, followed by 100 µl of 1 M sodium acetate, pH 5 and 50 µl<br>
of 0.5 M dithiothreitol in water. After a 1 hour incubation, the solution was<br>
dialyzed into sodium acetate buffer overnight at 4°C.<br>
The thiol tipped T40 dextran and the maleimide derivatized BSA were<br>
combined (a small aliquot of the BSA-maleimide was saved for analysis). After an<br>
overnight reaction, one half the mixture (about 1 ml) was fractionated by gel<br>
filtration using a 1x60 cm S-400HR column, equilibrated with saline. For<br>
comparison, a mixture of 100 µl BSA monomer (42.2 mg/ml), 300 µl T40 dextran<br>
AOAc, and 0.5 ml saline was similarly fractionated on the same gel filtration<br>
column. Fractions (about 1 ml) were analyzed for protein by absorbance at 280<br>
nm and for dextran using the resorcinol assay.<br>
With reference to Figures 5A-D, it is evident that the protein and dextran<br>
are eluting earlier from the column when in the T40 dextran AOAc-thiol-maleimide<br>
BSA conjugate than when the components are mixed. This indicates that a<br><br>
conjugate of higher molecular weight has been formed. Furthermore, the ratio of<br>
dextran to protein increased.<br>
The column fractions were further analyzed by SDS PAGE, with the results<br>
provided in Figure 6. From left to right, MW marker, conjugate fractions 18,<br>
20,22,24,26, mixture fractions # 24,26,28, 30, unfractionated conjugate, starting<br>
BSA-maleimide.<br>
It is evident that the unfractionated conjugate contains only a small<br>
proportion of free protein, indicating that the conjugate was formed in high yield.<br>
No high molecular weight protein is evident in the mixture fractions. Only<br>
conjugate and essentially no free protein is evident in the conjugate fractions.<br>
This confirms that a conjugate formed in high yield.<br>
Example 16: Preparation of BSA-Pn14 Conjugates via Glycidic Acid and<br>
Amino-Oxy Derivatized Pn-14.<br>
The following example is illustrative of the preparation of a conjugate using<br>
an aldehyde-substituted protein.<br>
I. In situ synthesis of NHS ester of glycidic acid using TSTU and addition to<br>
BSA<br>
In this step, 7.9 mg of glycidic acid hemi-calcium salt monohydrate (MW<br>
143) was solubilized in 110 µl NMP. This was combined with 200 µl of 0.5 M<br>
TSTU (Novachem) in NMP, and 100 µl of triethylamine, and was added to 1 ml of<br>
24 mg/ml BSA. The pH was adjusted to pH 8. After approximately 2 hours, the<br>
mixture was dialyzed on 2 x 1 liter saline. The number of free amines on BSA<br>
was determined using TNBS. For the control, the number was 33.2 NH2/BSA.<br>
For glycidic acid/TSTU/BSA, the number was 25 NH2/BSA. These results lead to<br>
the conclusion that BSA was labeled with about 8 glycidic acid units /BSA<br><br>
II.	Oxidation of Functionalized BSA<br>
A 5 mg aliquot was made up with 25 mM NaAc at pH 5, and 25 mM sodium<br>
periodate. The reaction was allowed to proceed in the dark at room temperature<br>
for 15 minutes, after which a drop of glycerol was added to quench the reaction.<br>
The mixture was fractionated S200HR, pool main peak &amp; concentrate.<br>
III.	Preparation of BSA(ox)-AO-Pn14 Conjugate<br>
In this step, 444 µl of amino-oxy functionalized Pn14 was combined with<br>
0.4 ml BSA(ox) made up at 10.1 mg/ml, and 100 µl 1 M NaAc at pH 5, and<br>
reacted overnight at room temperature. The Fractionate by gel filtration S400HR<br>
1x60 cm saline + 0.02% azide SEC HPLC indicated that oxidation of the Glycdic<br>
acid/TSTU/BSA caused polymerization of the BSA.<br>
Also observed was the progressive increase in the high molecular weight<br>
peak, indicating that conjugation was increasing with time. The AO-Pn14 alone<br>
had minimal absorbance.<br>
Example 17: Preparation of Mercaptoglycerol-Bromoacetate BSA<br>
This example illustrates a process for preparing a<br>
BSA(mercaptoglycerol(ox))-AO-dextran conjugate.<br>
Preparation of bromoacetylated BSA<br>
500pl monomeric BSA (48mg/ml) was combined with 500ul 1 M HEPES, at<br>
pH 8, and 25 µl 0.1 M NHS bromoacetate in NMP. For the control, 250 µl BSA<br>
was combined with 250 µl HEPES and 12 µl NMP<br>
After approximately 1 hour, each was desalted into saline using an Amican<br>
Ultra 4 (30 kDa cutoff) device. The final volume was 450 µl BSA-bromoAc, and<br>
300pl BSA control<br>
Next, 50 mM mercaptoethanol and 50 mM mercaptoglycerol were prepared<br>
in water.<br><br>
Preparation E: 225 µl BSA-BromoAc was combined with 100 µl 1 M<br>
HEPES at pH 8 and 50 µl of 50 mM mercaptoglycerol.<br>
Preparation F: The BSA control was combined with 100 µl 1 M HEPES to<br>
pH 8 and 50 µl 50 mM mercaptoglycerol<br>
Preparation G: 225 µl BSA- BromoAc was combined with 100 µl 1 M<br>
HEPES at pH 8, and 50 µl 50 mM mercaptoethanol.<br>
After 30 minutes, each was desalted with Amicon Ultra using NaAc buffer<br>
(10 mM NaAcetate, 150 mM NaCI, 5 mM EDTA, pH 5). Final volume was 0.5 ml<br>
Each was then made up in 10 mM sodium periodate from a freshly<br>
prepared 0.5 M stock and incubated for 10 minutes at 4°C in the dark, and then<br>
quenched by the addition of glycerol and desalted using the Amicon Ultra device<br>
and washed into NaAc buffer. By OD 280, each was determined to be about 20<br>
mg/ml BSA.<br>
Preparation E should contain BSA-aldehyde; Preparation F was not labeled<br>
with the bromoacetate, and so it could not react with the mercaptoglycerol. Thus,<br>
it should not contain aldehydes. Preparation G would have pendent<br>
mercaptoethanol, which does not oxidize, so it should not contain aldehdydes.<br>
315 µl of Amino-oxy dextran, at 15.9 mg/ml, was combined with 250 pi of<br>
each BSA preparation, and incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark.<br>
Each was then fractionated by gel filtration on a S400HR 1x60cm<br>
equilibrated with saline. The high molecular weight fraction was analyzed for<br>
protein and dextran.<br>
The results indicated that only BSA containing the oxidized<br>
mercaptoglycerol formed a conjugate, and this was confirmed by the<br>
protein/dextran ratio of the high molecular weight fraction.<br>
E BSA-mercaptoglycerol(ox) + AO-dex	0.97 mg BSA/mg dex.<br>
F BSA control (ox)	+ AO-dex	0.1 mg BSA/mg dex.<br><br>
G BSA-mercaptoethanol(ox) +AO-dex	0.1 mg BSA/mg dex.<br>
Example 18: Linking of a Protein to a Polysaccharide via Oxime Formation<br>
The following example illustrates the linking of a protein via its N-terminal<br>
group to a polysaccharide via oxime formation.<br>
N-terminal threonine of lysostaphin was oxidized and derivatized with a bis-<br>
amino-oxy reagent. Oxidation of the protein was performed as generally<br>
described in Gaertner &amp; Offord, "Site-specific attachment of functionalized<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) to the amino terminus of proteins," Bioconjugate Chem. 7:38<br>
(1996). Lysostaphin a 27 kDa protein was produced in lactococcus.<br>
Trial No. 1<br>
The lysostaphin used contained only about 30% free N-terminal threonine.<br>
Conditions of Gaertner &amp; Offord were used for oxidation of the N-terminal<br>
threonine. In more detail, a 50 molar excess of methionine (17.5 µl from a 1M<br>
stock in water) was added to 1 ml of a 10 mg/ml solution of lysostaphin. Sodium<br>
bicarbonate (1M) was added to adjust the pH to 8.3. Oxidation was commenced<br>
by the addition of sodium periodate (7 µl from a 0.5 M stock in water). The<br>
reaction mixture was kept in the dark at room temperature for 10 minutes, at<br>
which time 7.1 mg Bis(amino-oxy)tetraethylene glycol (obtained from Solulink™)<br>
prepared as a 50 mg/ml solution in DMSO was added. After 1 hour in the dark,<br>
the solution was dialyzed against saline in the dark at room temperature. The<br>
product is termed lysotaphin AO. The lysostaphin concentration was determined<br>
at OD 280 using 0.49 mg/ml/Absorbance unit.<br>
An aliquot was tested with TNBS at pH 5. It has previously been found that<br>
amino-oxy but not amines reacted with TNBS under these conditions. The assay<br>
was performed as follows: 50 µl of lysostaphin or lysostaphin AO was added to<br>
440 µl of 0.1 M NaAc, pH 5 and then 10 µl of 10 mg/ml TNBS in water added. 5 pi<br>
of 1 mM Amino-oxy acetic acid was used as a standard in the above solution.<br><br>
Samples were read at 500 nm after a 6 hour incubation in the dark. The sample<br>
solution was orange, indicating presence of amino-oxy groups. Using the<br>
standard, it was estimated about 30% of lysostaphin was derivatized with the AO<br>
group. This lysostaphin AO was then reacted with excess oxidized T2000 dextran<br>
in the dark at room temperature to allow conjugation via oxime formation. The<br>
reaction was assayed by SEC HPLC to determine the shift of mass from low<br>
molecular weight (unconjugated protein) to high molecular weight (lysostaphin-<br>
dextran conjugate). A Phenomenex Biosep SEC2000 (300x4.6) equilibrated with<br>
PBS and run at 0.5 ml/min with monitoring at 280 nm was used for SEC HPLC<br>
With reference to Figure 6, the upper chromatogram is the reaction mixture<br>
at about 1 minute, the middle chromatogram is after an overnight reaction and the<br>
lower figure is the lysostaphin AO alone. Note the shift to high molecular weight<br>
material after the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight. This figure suggests<br>
that the AO group on the lysostaphin linked to the high molecular weight, oxidized<br>
dextran. About 27% was coupled, based on the percentage of the area of the<br>
high molecular weight peak. This is in the expected percentage since only about<br>
a third of the lysostaphin contained a free threonine and was derivatized with AO,<br>
as indicated by TNBS assay.<br>
Example 19: Preparation of DT(ox)-AO-Pn14 Conjugate<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of the DT(ox)-AO-Pn14 conjugate,<br>
and it also demonstrates how reagents can be prepared in as "single pot"<br>
reactions (which may simplify preparation).<br>
I. Mercaptoglvcerol-Diptheria toxoid<br>
0.5 ml diphtheria toxoid (~13 mg/ml) was combined with 100 µl 1 M<br>
HEPES, pH 8 and 10 µl 0.1 M NHS bromoacetate in NMP. It was incubated in the<br>
dark for about 30 minutes, and then 10 µl of 12.3 µl mercaptoglycerol was added.<br><br>
Following an overnight reaction, the solution was desalted with an Amicon Ultra 4<br>
(30kDa cutoff) to a final volume of about 400 ul.<br>
Next, 50 µl of 1 M sodium acetate at pH 5 was added, followed by 9 µl of<br>
0.5 M sodium periodate. Oxidation was allowed to proceed for 10 minutes in the<br>
dark at room temperature. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of<br>
50% glycerol. The low molecular weight components were removed on the same<br>
Amicon Ultra 4 device and diafiltered into saline. The final volume was about 200<br>
µl.<br>
The above protocol eliminated one of the desalting steps by adding excess<br>
mercaptoglycerol to the solution containing bromoacetylated-DT and<br>
bromoacetate.<br>
II. Conjugation<br>
1 ml of amino-oxy Pn14 (~9 mg/ml) was added to the oxidized DT and 100<br>
µl of 1 M sodium acetate at pH 5 added. The reaction was allowed to proceed<br>
overnight at room temperature in the dark, and then fractionated on an S400HR<br>
column (1x60 cm, equilibrated with saline).<br>
The high molecular weight fraction was pooled. Protein was estimated<br>
using 1 mg/ml= 1 OD and the Pn14 concentration determined using the resorcinol<br>
assay. The fraction was found to contain about 1.3 mg DT/mg Pn14.<br>
Example 20: Preparation of a qp350(ox)-AO-S-Pn14 conjugate.<br>
gp350 is a glycoprotein from Epstein Barr virus that binds to human<br>
complement receptor. It was produced recombinantly in yeast cells by Dr.<br>
Goutam Sen (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethsda,<br>
MD) and purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography.<br>
The pH of 0.5 ml of gp350 at 8 mg/ml in PBS was reduced by the addition<br>
of 50 µl 1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.7, and 11 µl of 0.5 M sodium periodate (in<br>
water) was added. After an 8 minute incubation in the dark, on ice, the reaction<br><br>
was quenched by the addition of 100 µl 50% glycerol. Excess reagent was<br>
removed by diafiltration using an Amicon Ultra 4 (30 kDa cutoff) device. A total of<br>
four, 4 ml exchanges with PBS were used. The final volume was about 300 µl.<br>
To this solution, 100 µl of 1 M NaAc, pH 5 was added, followed by 400 µl of AO-S-<br>
Pn14(9.1 mg/ml).<br>
After an overnight reaction at 4° C in the dark, the reaction was quenched<br>
by the addition of 100 µl of 0.25 M amino-oxy acetate, pH 5. The resulting<br>
conjugate was fractionated by gel filtration on a 1 x 60 cm S400HR column,<br>
equilibrated with saline. The void volume fractions were pooled. The Pn14<br>
concentration was determined by the resorcinol/sulfuric acid method and the<br>
protein from the absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 1 mg/ml<br>
= 1 absorbance unit. The conjugate contained 0.9 mg gp350/mg Pn14.<br>
Control gp350 was oxidized and prepared as above but amino-oxy acetate<br>
was added instead of amino-oxy Pn14.<br>
In competition assays with fluorescently labeled gp350, both the control<br>
and the conjugated gp350 were capable of binding to the complement receptor of<br>
human B cells. (Performed by Goutam Sen USUHS).<br>
Mice were immunized on with the gp350-Pn14 conjugate on days 0 and 10,<br>
and bled on days 10 and 23<br><br>
The increase in anti-Pn14 IgG on boosting is an indication that the protein<br>
and polysaccharide are covalently linked and acting as a T cell dependent<br>
antigen. As a T cell independent antigen, Pn14 alone does not show an increase<br><br>
in titer.<br>
Example 21: Preparation of a [DeAcLTA(ox)-AO-SH]-GMBS-BSA Conjugate<br>
LTA was deacylated by incubation for 1 hour in pH 10 sodium bicarbonate<br>
at approximately 75°C. Sample is then dialyzed against water. This is deacylated<br>
LTA (DeAcLTA).<br>
The sample was then oxidized in 10 mM sodium periodate at pH 5<br>
overnight in the dark at room temperature, dialyzed against water again, and<br>
lyophilized. The sample was taken up in a small volume of water, incubated<br>
overnight with reduced amino-oxy cysteamine and lyophilized. The sample was<br>
taken up in about 1 ml of water and fractionated on an S200HR column,<br>
equilibrated with 10 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM NaCI, and 5 mM EDTA, pH 5.<br>
The low molecular weight fraction containing both Pi and thiol was pooled and<br>
lyophilized and taken up in about 0.75 ml water. This fraction was found to<br>
contain about 1 mM thiol and 350 micromolar phosphate. This material is thiol-<br>
labeled DeAcLTA.<br>
BSA was labeled with a 50 fold molar excess of GMBS (Prochem) at pH<br>
7.2 and desalted in sodium acetate buffer and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra<br>
4 (30kDa cutoff) device to a final concentration of about 55 mg/ml.<br>
60 µl of the BSA-GMBS was added to the thiol labeled DeAcLTA. As the<br>
reaction proceeded, the concentration of thiols decreased at least 10 fold, as<br>
determined by the DTNB assay.<br>
Conjugation was monitored by SEC HPLC on a Superose 6 column,<br>
(equilibrated with PBS,1 ml min, OD 280). The lower trace indicated the<br>
chromatogram for the GMBS labeled BSA alone and the upper trace indicated the<br>
conjugate, which elutes earlier, indicating an increased molecular weight. By SDS<br>
PAGE, the MW of the conjugate had clearly increased in a manner consistent with<br>
the SEC chromatogram. No monomeric BSA is evident in the conjugate.<br><br>
A western blot was performed to demonstrate the presence of LTA on the<br>
high molecular weight protein. It is seen that the conjugate was reactive for LTA.<br>
Neither BSA nor LTA alone or the combination indicate any high molecular weight<br>
LTA.<br>
To further demonstrate the covalent linkage between LTA and BSA, a<br>
double ELISA was performed. The ELISA plate was coated with anti-BSA<br>
followed by conjugate or LTA, BSA or the combination. Anti-LTA is then applied<br>
and the amount bound determined. Thus, only material containing both BSA and<br>
LTA would be detected. Only the conjugate was positive in this assay.<br>
Thus by reaction monitoring, molecular weight, western blotting and double<br>
ELISA all indicated the formation of a covalent link between the protein and LTA.<br>
Example 22: Preparation of a LTA-TT Conjugate<br>
Reagents were obtained from Aldrich. Aminooxyacetylcystamine was<br>
prepared by Dr. David Schwartz of Solulink Inc. (San Diego, CA). TCEP was<br>
purchased from Pierce.<br>
S. Aureus serotype 5 lab strain (MSSA) was grown by Kemp Biotech<br>
(Frederick, MD) in a 100 liter fermenter. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended and<br>
centrifuged into aliquots approximating 10 liters of cells. The cell paste was<br>
stored at -70°C. An aliquot was thawed and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium citrate,<br>
pH 4.7 and disrupted with a Bead Beater (Biospec Products) using 0.1 m<br>
zirconium beads. The device was ice cooled and run 1 min on and 1 min off for 4<br>
cycles. The liquid was removed and the beads washed with citrate buffer.<br>
Alternatively, cells were treated with 1 mg/ml lysostaphin at pH 5 overnight at 4°C<br>
and then disrupted using a Microfluidizer Model 110Y (Microfluidizer, Newton, MA)<br>
with 3 passes at 23,000 psi.<br><br>
I. LTA extraction<br>
LTA was extracted and purified from cell pellets using either the phenol<br>
extraction method of Fischer et al., Improved preparation of lipoteichoic acids. Eur<br>
J Biochem, 1983.133(3): p. 523-30, with minor modifications or using the butanol<br>
method of Morath et al., Structure-function relationship of cytokine induction by<br>
lipoteichoic acid from Staphylococcus aureus. J Exp Med, 2001. 193(3): p. 393-7.<br>
In brief, the disrupted cell suspension was vigorously mixed for 30 min<br>
with an equal volume of n-butanol. The solution was then centrifuged for 20 min<br>
at 13,000 x g. The upper phase (butanol) was removed and the lower, aqueous<br>
phase was lyophilized. Initially the butanol phase was re-extracted and the new<br>
aqueous phase tested for LTA by ELISA, however an insignificant amount of LTA<br>
was recovered. Pellets were resuspended in 25 ml of citrate buffer and frozen.<br>
Pellets from several extraction runs were combined, and the disruption/extraction<br>
process repeated.<br>
The solubilized extract was filtered using a Whatman 0.45pm syringe filter<br>
(#6894-2504) and loaded onto a 2.6 x 20 cm Octyl Sepharose column<br>
(Pharmacia), equilibrated with 0.1M ammonium acetate in 15% n-propanol, pH<br>
4.7, at a flow rate of .5ml/min. The column was then washed with 0.1 M sodium<br>
acetate in 15% n-propanol until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to baseline.<br>
The column was then eluted with 25mM sodium acetate in 40% n-propanol at 4<br>
ml/min and fractions of 8 ml collected. The phosphate containing fractions were<br>
pooled and loaded onto a 5 ml Sepharose Q FF column, equilibrated with the<br>
same buffer. When the absorbance returned to baseline, the column was eluted<br>
with buffer + 0.5 M KCI. Phospate containing tubes were pooled, partially<br>
lyophilized to reduce the volume and dialyzed against water to remove salts and<br>
lyophilized again.<br><br>
II. Conjugation of LTA to tetanus toxoid<br>
LTA was deacylated by incubating 1 ml (10 mg/ml) in 0.1 M sodium<br>
carbonate + 0.1 M hydroxylamine for 2 hr at 75° C, followed by dialysis against<br>
water using a 3.5 kDa cutoff membrane (Pierce). The solution was then<br>
lyophilized and taken up in 0.5 ml water. The deacylated LTA was oxidized by the<br>
addition of 100 µI 1 M sodium acetate, pH 5 and 125 µl 0.5 M sodium<br>
meta period ate. After 2 hrs the reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 µl<br>
50% glycerol and dialyzed overnight in the dark against water. This material<br>
tested positive for aldehydes in the purpald assay (Lee, C.H. and C.E. Frasch,<br>
Quantification of bacterial polysaccharides by the purpald assay: measurement of<br>
periodate-generated formaldehyde from glycol in the repeating unit. Anal<br>
Biochem, 2001. 296(1): p. 73-82).<br>
(Amino-oxyacetate)cysteamine was prepared by solubilizing 11 mg<br>
Bis(amino-oxyacetate)cystamine in an aqueous solution of 25% NMP. TCEP (17<br>
mg) in 1 M sodium carbonate was added and the solution incubated for 10 min<br>
and then passed over a Dowex 1x-8 column (1x3 cm), equilibrated with 10 mM<br>
Bistris, pH 6. The DTNB positive fractions in the flow through were pooled. The<br>
pooled (amino-oxyacetate)cysteamine was assayed for thiols and determined to<br>
contain 5.2 µmole SH. The reagent was combined with the oxidized deacylated<br>
LTA and incubated overnight in the dark at 4°C and then dialyzed against 10 mM<br>
sodium acetate, 0.15 M sodium chloride, 5 mM EDTA, pH 5 to remove excess<br>
reagent. The final solution was 2 ml at 2.5 mM thiol and 25 mM phosphate.<br>
Tetanus toxoid (TT) (obtained from GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium)<br>
was labeled with maleimide by adding a 50-fold molar excess of GMBS (0.1 M<br>
stock in NMP) to a 14.6 mg/ml solution of TT buffered in15 M HEPES, 5 mM<br>
EDTA, pH 7.3. After a 1 hr reaction, the solution was desalted by diafilitration into<br><br>
2 M NaCI using an Amicon Ultra 4 (30kDa cutoff) device, concentrating to a final<br>
volume of 0.4 ml. The retained material was DTNB positive.<br>
The thiolated, deacylated LTA was combined with the maleimide-TT under<br>
a stream of nitrogen and the pH adjusted to 6.5 by the addition of 0.75 M HEPES,<br>
pH 7.3. After sealing and incubating overnight at 4°C, the solution was assayed<br>
and determined to still be 2 mM thiol. An additional 7 mg of TT was labeled with<br>
maleimide as above, diafiltered and concentrated to 0.5 ml and added to the<br>
reaction mixture. Over 30 min the thiol content steadily decreased and at that<br>
time the reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 ju.1 of 0.5 M iodoacetamide<br>
+100 µl of 1 M sodium carbonate.<br>
The conjugate was purified using size exclusion chromatography on a<br>
Superose 6 (Prep grade) column (1 x 30 cm), equilibrated with saline.<br>
III. Immunization of mice<br>
Groups of 20 Balb/c mice were immunized on days 0, 14 and 28 with 5 ug<br>
of LTA as described above, either mixed with TT or conjugated to TT and with Ribi<br>
MPL adjuvant and bled 14 days later. Individual sera were assayed for anti-IgG<br>
by ELISA. The results are provided in Fig. 7. M110 (a mouse monoclonal<br>
antibody that binds to LTA) was used as a standard. Anti-LTA levels were<br>
assayed in the sera. Results are shown in Fig. 8. The conjugate induced high<br>
levels, and the mixture induced only very low levels of antibody. To evaluate the<br>
biological activity of the anti-sera, an opsonophagocytic was performed. Sera<br>
were diluted at 1:25.<br>
IV. Phosphate analysis<br>
Phosphate was determined as described by Chen, P.S., T.Y. Toribara, and<br>
H. Warner, Microdetermination of Phosphorous. Anal Biochem, (1956) 28: p.<br>
1756-1758, with some modifications. In brief, a 100 µl sample + 30 µI magnesium<br><br>
nitrate solution in a 13 x 100 mm borosilicate tube were vortexed, dried in a<br>
heating block and flamed with a propane torch until a brown gas was emitted. 300<br>
µl of 0.5 M HCI was added, the tubes capped with glass marbles and heated in a<br>
boiling water bath for 15 min. The tubes were allowed to cool and 700 µl of an<br>
ascorbic acid/ammonium molybdate mix added, incubated for 20 min at 45°C and<br>
samples read at 820 nm. The mix was prepared by combining 6 parts of a<br>
solution of ammonium molybdate (0.42 g + 2.86 ml sulfuric acid made up to 100<br>
ml with water) and 1 part of 10% ascorbic acid in water. Phosphate standard was<br>
obtained from Sigma.<br>
