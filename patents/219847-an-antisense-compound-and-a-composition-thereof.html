FIELD OP THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compositions and methods for modulating the expression of apolipoprotein B. In particular, this invention relates to compounds, particularly oligonucleotides, specifically hybridizable with nucleic acids encoding apolipoprotein B. * Such compounds have been shown to modulate the expression of apolipoprotein B.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Lipoproteins are globular, micelle-like particles that consist of a non-polar core of acylglycerols and cholesteryl esters surrounded by an amphiphilic coating of protein, phospholipid and cholesterol. Lipoproteins have been classified into five broad categories on the basis of their functional and physical properties: chylomicrons, which transport dietary lipids from intestine to tissues; very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)? intermediate density<br><br>
lipoproteins (IDL); low density lipoproteins (LDL); all of which transport triacylglycerols and cholesterol from the liver to tissues; and high density lipoproteins (HDL), which transport endogenous cholesterol from tissues to the<br>
liver.<br>
Lipoprotein particles undergo continuous metabolic processing and have variable properties and compositions. Lipoprotein densities increase without decreasing particle diameter because the density of their outer coatings is less than that of the inner core. The protein components of lipoproteins are known as apoliproteins, At least nine apoiipoproteins are distributed in significant amounts among the various human lipoproteins-<br>
Apolipoprotein B (also known as ApoB, apolipoprotein B-100; ApoB-100, apolipoprotein B-48; Apc3-43 and Ag(x) antigen), is a large glycoprotein that serves an indispensable role in the assembly and secretion of -lipids and in the transport and receptor-mediated uptake and delivery of distinct classes of lipoproteins. The importance of apolipoprotein 3 spans a variety of functions, from the absorption and processing of dietary lipids to the regulation of circulating lipoprotein levels (Davidson and Shelness, Annu. Rev. Nutr., 2000, 20, 169-193). This latter property underlies its relevance in terms of atherosclerosis susceptibility, which is highly correlated with the ambient concentration of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (Davidson and Shelness, Annu. Rev. Ntitr., 2000, 20, 169-193).<br>
Two forms of apolipoprotein B exist ir_ mammals. ApoB-100 represents the full-length protein containing 453 6 amino acid residues synthesized exclusively in the human liver (Davidson and Shelness, Annu. Rev. Nutr., 2000, 20,<br><br>
169-193). A truncated .form known as ApoB-48 is colinear with che amino terminal 2152 residues and is synthesized in the small intestine of all mammals (Davidson and Shelness, Annu. Rev. Nutr., 2000, 20, 169-193).<br>
ApoB-100 is the major protein component of LDL and contains the domain required for interaction of this lipoprotein species with the LDL receptor. In addition/ ApoB-100 contains an unpaired cysteine residue which mediates an interaction with apolipoprotein(a) and generates another distinct atherogenic lipoprotein called Lp(a) ,'Davidson and Shelness, Annu. Rev. Nutr., 2000, 20, 169-193) .<br>
In humans, ApoB-48 circulates in association with chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants and these particles are cleared by a distinct receptor known as the LDL-receptor-related protein (Davidson and Shelness, Annu. Rev] Nutr., 2000, 20, 169-193). ApoB-48 can be viewed as a crucial adaptation-by which dietary lipid is delivered from the small intestine to the liver, while ApoB-100 participates in the transport and delivery of endogenous plasma cholesterol (Davidson and Shelness, Annu. Rev. Nutr., 2000, 20, 169-193).<br>
The basis by which the common structural gene for apolipoprotein B produces two distinct protein isoforms is a process known as RJSTA editing. A site specific cytosine-to-uracil editing reaction produces a UAA stop codon and translational termination of apolipoprotein B to produce ApoB-48 (Davidson and Shelness, Annu. Rev. Nutr., 2000, 20,<br>
169-193) .<br>
Apolipoprotein B was cloned in 1985 (Law et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.f 1985, 82, 8340-8344) and mapped<br><br>
to chromosome 2p23-2p24 in 1386 (Deeb et al, . Proc. Natl. Acad. 3ci. U. S. A., 1986, 83, 419-422).<br>
Disclosed and claimed in US patent 5,78Â£,206 are methods and compositions for determining the level of low density lipoprotains (LDL) in plasma which include isolated DNA sequences encoding epitope regions of apolipoprotein 3-100 (Smith et al., 1998).<br>
Transgenic mice expressing human apclipcprotein B and fed a high-fat diet were found to develop high plasma cholesterol levels and displayed an 11-fold increase in atherosclerotic lesions over non-transgenic littermates (Kim and Young, J. Livid Res., 1998, 39, "03-723; Nishina et al., J. LipidRes., 1990, 31, 859-869).<br>
In addition, transgenic mice expressing truncated forms of human apolipoprotein B have been employed to identify the carboxyl-terminal structural features of ApoB-100 that are required for interactions with apolipoprotein(a) to generate the Lp(a) lipoprotein particle and to investigate structural features of the LDL receptor-binding region of ApoB-100 (Kim and Young, J. LipidRes., 1998, 39, 703-723; McCormick e: al. , J". Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 23616-23622).<br>
Apolipoprotein B knockout mice (bearing disruptions of both ApoB-100 and ApoB-48) have been generated which are protected from developing hypercholesterolemia when fed a high-fat diet (Farese et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 1995, 92, 1774-1778; Kim and Young, J. Lipid Res., 1998, 39, 703-723). The incidence of atherosclerosis has been investigated in mice expressing exclusively ApoB-100 or ApoB-48 and susceptibility to atherosclerosis was found to be dependent on total cholesterol levels. Whether the mice synthesized ApoB-100 or ApoB-48 did not affect the<br><br>
extent of the atherosclerosis, indicating that there is probably no major difference in the intrinsic atherogenicity of ApoB-100 versus ApoB-48 (Kim and Young, J. Lipid Res., 1998, 39, 703-723; Veniant et al., j. din. Invest., 1997, 100, 180-188}.<br>
Elevated plasma levels of the ApoB-100-containing lipoprc-ein Lp(a) are associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis and its manifestations, which may include hypercholesterolemia (Seed et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 1990, 322, 1434-1499), myocardial infarction (Sandkamp et al., Clin. Chem., 1990, 36, 20-23), and thrombosis (Nowak-Gottl et al., Pediatrics, 1997, 99, Ell).<br>
The plasma concentration of Lp(a) is strongly influenced by heritable factors and is refractory to most drug and dietary manipulation (Katan and Beynen, Am. J. Epidemiol., 1987, 125, 387-399; Vessby et al., Atherosclerosis, 1982, 44, 61-71). Pharmacologic therapy of elevated Lp(a) levels has been only modestly successful and apheresis remains the most effective therapeutic modality (Hajjar and Nachman, Annu. Rev. Med,, 1996, 47, 423-442).<br>
Disclosed and claimed in US patent 6,156,315 and the corresponding PCT publication WO 99/18986 is a method for inhibiting the binding of LDL to blood vessel matrix in a subject, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an antibody or a fragment thereof, which is capable of binding to the amino-terminal region of apolipoprotein B, thereby inhibiting the binding of low density lipoprotein to blood vessel matrix (Goldberg and Pillarisetti, 2000; Goldberg and Pillarisetti, 1999).<br>
Disclosed and claimed in US patent 6,096,516 are vectors containing cDNA encoding murine recombinant antibodies which bind to human ApoB-100 for the purpose of<br><br>
tor diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (Kwak et al. , 2000) .<br>
Disclosed and. claimed in European patent application E? 911344 published April 23, 1999 (and corresponding to U.S. Parent 6,309,844) is a monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to ApoB-43 and does not specifically bind to ApoB-100, which is useful for diagnosis and therapy of hyperlipidemia and arterial sclerosis (Uchida and Kuranc, 1998) .<br>
Disclosed and claimed in PCT publication WO 01/3 0354 are mechods of treating a patient with a cardiovascular disorder, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound to said patient, wherein said compound acts for a period of time to lower plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein B or apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins by stimulating a pathway for apolipcprotein B degradation (Fisher and Williams, 2001).<br>
Disclosed and claimed in US patent 5,22 0,006 is a cloned cis-acting DNA sequence that mediates the suppression of atherogenic apolipoprotein 3 (Ross et al., 1993) .<br>
Disclosed and claimed in PCT publication WO 01/12789 is a ribozyme which cleaves ApoB-100 mRMA specifically at position 6679 (Chan et al., 2001).<br>
To date, strategies aimed at inhibiting apolipoprotein B function have been limited to Lp(a) apheresis, antibodies, antibody fragments and ribozymes. However, with the exception of Lp(a) apheresis, these investigative strategies are untested as therapeutic protocols. Consequently, there remains a long felt need for additional agents capable of effectively inhibiting apolipoprotein B function.<br><br>
Antisense technology is emerging as an effective means of reducing the expression cf specific gene products and may therefore prove to be uniquely useful in a number of therapeutic, diagnostic and research applications involving modulation of apolipoprotein 3 expression.<br>
The present invention provides compositions and methods for modulating apolipoprotein B expression, including inhibition of the alternative isoform of apolipcprotein 3, ApoB-48.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention employs oligomeric compounds, particularly antisense oligonucleotides, for use in modulating the function pf nucleic acid molecules encoding apolipoprotein B, ultimately modulating the amount of apolipoprotein B produced.  This is accomplished by providing antisense compounds which specifically hybridize with one or more nucleic acids encoding apolipoprotein B. As used herein, the terms "target nucleic acid" and "nucleic acid encoding apolipoprotein B" encompass DNA encoding apolipoprotein B, RNA (including pre-mRNA and mRMA) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA derived from such RNA.  The specific hybridization of an oligomeric compound with its target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the nucleic acid.  This modulation of function of a target nucleic acid by compounds which specifically hybridize to it is generally referred to as "antisense" .  The functions of DNA to be interfered with<br><br>
include replication and transcription.  The functions of RNA to be interfered with include all vital functions such as, for example, translocation of the RMA to the site of protein translation, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or more mRNA species, and catalytic activity which may be engaged in or facilitated by the RNA.  The overall effect of such interference with target nucleic acid function is modulation of the expression of apolipoprotein. 3.  In the context of the present: invention, "modulation" means either an increase (stimulation) or a decrease (inhibition) in the expression of a gene.  In the context cf the present invention, inhibition is the preferred form of modulation of gene expression and mRNA is a preferred target.<br>
It is preferred to target specific nucleic acids for antisense.  "Targeting" an antisense compound to a particular nucleic acid, in the context of this- invention, is a multistep process.  The process usually begins--with the identification of a nucleic acid sequence whose function is to be modulated.  This may be, for example, a cellular gene (or mRNA transcribed from the gene) whose expression is associated with a particular disorder or disease state, or a nucleic acid molecule from an infectious agent.  In the present invention, the target is a nucleic acid molecule encoding apolipoprotein B.  The targeting process also includes determination of a site or sites within this gene for the antisense interaction to occur such that the desired effect, e.g., detection or modulation of expression of the protein, will result. Within the context of the present invention, a preferred intragenic site is the -region encompassing the translation initiation or termination codon of the open reading frame<br><br>
(ORF) of the gene.  Since, as is known in the art, the translation initiation codon is typically 5'-AUG (in transcribed mRNA molecules; 5' -ATG in the corresponding DNA molecule), the translation initiation codon is also referred to as the "AUG codon," the "start codon" or the "AUG start codon".  A minority of genes have a translation initiation codon having the RNA sequence 5'-GUG, 5'-UUG or 5'-CUG, and 5'-AUA, 5'-ACG and 5'-CUG have been shown to function in vivo.  Thus, the terms "translation initiation codon" and "start codon" can encompass many codon sequences, even though the initiator amino acid in each instance is typically methionine (in eukaryotes) or formylmethionine (in prokaryotes).  It is also known in the art that eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes may have two or more alternative scart codons, any one of which may be preferentially utilized for translation initiation in-a particular cell type or tissue, or under a particular set of conditions.  In the context of the invention, "start codon" and "translation initiation codon'1 refer to the codon or codons that are used in vivo to initiate translation of an-mRNA molecule transcribed from a gene encoding apolipoprotein B, regardless of the sequence(s) of such codons.<br>
It is also known in the art that a translation termination codon (or "stop codon") of a gene may have one of three sequences, i.e., 5'-UAA, 5'-UAG and 5'-UGA (the corresponding DNA sequences.are 5'-TAA, 5'-TAG and 5'-TGA, respectively) .  The terms- "start codon region" and "translation initiation codon region" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation initiation codon.  Similarly,<br><br>
the cerms "stop codon region" and "translation termination codon region" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nuclectides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation termination codon.<br>
The open reading frame (ORF) or "coding region, " which is known in the art to refer to the region between the translation initiation codon. and the translation termination codon, is also a region which may be targeted effectively.  Other target regions include the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), known in the arc to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the '5' direction from the translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5' cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene, and the 3? untranslated region (3'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3' direction from the  translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the translation termination codon and 3 ' end of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene.  The 5' cap of an mRNA comprises an N7-methylated guanosine residue joined to the 5'-most residue of the mRNA via a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage.  The 5' cap region of an mRNA is considered to include the 5' cap structure itself as well as the first 50 nucleotides adjacent to the cap. The 51 cap region may also be a preferred target region.<br>
Although some eukaryotic mRNA transcripts are directly translated, many contain one or more regions, known as "introns," which are excised from a transcript before it is translated.  The remaining (and therefore translated) regions are known as "exons" and are spliced together to form a continuous mRNA sequence.  mRNA splice sites, i.e.,<br><br>
intron-exon junctions, may also be preferred target regions, and are particularly useful in situations where aberrant splicing is implicated in disease, or where an overproduction of a particular mRNA splice product is implicated in disease.  Aberrant fusion junctions due to rearrangements or deletions are also preferred targets.  It has also been found that introns can also be effective, and therefore preferred, target regions for antisense compounds targeted, for example, to DNA or pre-mRNA.<br>
Once one or more target sites have been identified, oligonucleotides are chosen which are sufficiently complementary to the target, i.e., hybridize sufficiently well and with sufficient specificity, to give the desired effect.<br>
In the context of this invention, "hybridization" means hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases.  For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. "Complementary," as used herein, refers to the capacity for precise pairing between two nucleotides.  For example, if a nucleotide at a certain position of an oligonucleotide is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleotide at the same position of a DNA or RNA molecule, then the oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA are considered to be complementary to each other at that position.  The oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of corresponding positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleotides which can hydrogen bond with-each other.  Thus, "specifically hybridizable" and "complementary" are terms which are used to indicate a<br><br>
or<br>
sufficient degree of complementarity or precise pairing such that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA target.  It is understood in the art that the sequence of an antisense compound need not be 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be specifically hybridizable.  An antisense compound is specifically hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target DNA or RNA molecule interferes with the normal function of the target DNA or RNA to cause a loss of utility, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding the antisense compound to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the-assays are performed.<br>
Antisense and other compounds of the invention which hybridize to the target and inhibit expression of the target are identified through experimentation, and the sequences of these compounds are hereinbelow identified as preferred embodiments of the invention. The target sites to which these preferred sequences are complementary are hereinbelow referred to as "active sites" and are therefore preferred sites for targeting. Therefore another embodiment of the invention encompasses compour.ds which hybridize to these active sites.<br>
Antisense compounds are commonly used as research reagents and diagnostics.  For example, antisense oligonucleotides, which are able to inhibit gene expression with exquisite specificity, are often used by those of ordinary skill to elucidate the function of particular<br><br>
genes.  Antisense compounds are also used, for example, to distinguish between functions of various members of a biological pathway.  Antisense modulation has, therefore, been harnessed for research use.<br>
For use in kits and diagnostics, the antisense compounds of the present invention, either alone or in combination with other antisense compounds or therapeutics, can be used as tools in differential* and/or combinatorial analyses to elucidate expression patterns of a portion or the entire complement of genes expressed within cells and tissues.<br>
Expression patterns within cells or tissues created with one or more antisense compounds are compared to control cells or tissues not treated with antisense compounds and the patterns produced are analyzed for differential levels of gene expression as they pertain, for example, to disease association, signaling pathway, cellular localization, expression level, size, structure or function of the genes examined.  These analyses can be performed on stimulated or unstimulated cells and in the presence or absence of other compounds which affect expression patterns.<br>
Examples of methods of gene expression analysis known in the art include DNA arrays or microarrays (Brazma and Vilo, FEBS Lett., 2000, 480, 17-24; Celis, et al. , FEBS Lett., 2000, 480, 2-16), SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) (Madden, et al., Drug Discov. Today, 2000, 5, 415-425), READS (restriction enzyme amplification of digested cDNAs) (Prashar and Weissman, Methods Enzymol., 1999, 303, 258-72), TOGA (total gene expression analysis) (Sutcliffe, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. 3ci. U. S. A., 2000, 97, 1976-81), protein arrays and proteomics (Celis, et al.,<br><br>

Biotechnol., 2000, 30, 143-57), subcractive RNA fingerprinting (SuRF) (Fuchs, et al., Anal. Biochem., 2000, 235, 91-98; Larson, et al., Cytometry, 2000, 41, 203-208), subtraccive cloning, differential display (DD) (Jurecic and Beimont, Curr. Opin. Microblol., 2000,. 3, 316-21), comparative genomic hybridization (Caruili, et al. , J. Cell Biochem. Suppl., 1998, 31, 286-96), FISH (fluorescent in sitzu hybridization) techniques (Going and Gusterson, Eur. J. Cancer, 1999, 35, 1895-904) and mass spectrometry methods (reviewed in (To, Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen, 2000, 3, 235-41).<br>
The specificity and sensitivity of antisense is also harnessed by those of skill in the art for therapeutic uses.  Antisense oligonucleotides have been employed as therapeutic moieties in the treatment of disease states in animals and man.  Antisense oligonucleotide drugs, including ribozymes, have been safely and effectively administered to humans and numerous clinical trials are presently underway.  It is thus established that oligonucleotides can be useful therapeutic modalities that can be configured to be useful in treatment regimes for treatment of cells, tissues and animals, especially humans.<br>
In the context of this invention, the term "oligonucleotide" refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or mimetics thereof.  Thus, this term includes oligonucleotides composed of naturally-occurring nucleobases, sugars and covalent internucleoside (backbone) linkages (RNA and DNA) as well as oligonucleotides having<br><br>
non-naturally-occurring portions which function similarly (oligonucleotide mimetics) .  Oligonucleotide mimetics are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.<br>
While antisense oligonucleotides are a preferred form of ar.cisen.se compound, the present: invention comprehends other oligomeric antisense compounds, including but not limited to oligonucleotide mimetics such as are described below.  The antisense compounds in accordance with- this invention, preferably comprise from about 8 to about 50 nuclecbases (i.e. from about 8 to about 50 linked nuciecsides).  Particularly preferred antisense compounds are antisense oligonucleotides, even more preferably those comprising from about 12, about 1-4, about 20 to about 3 0 nucleobases. Antisense compounds include ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides (oligozymes), and other short catalytic RNAs or catalytic oligonucleotides which hybridize to the target nucleic acid and modulate its expression.  In preferred embodiments, the antisense compound is non-catalytic oligonucleotide, i.e., is not dependent on a catalytic property of the oligonucleotide for its modulating activity-  Antisense compounds of the invention can include double-stranded molecules wherein a first strand is stably hybridized to a second strand.<br>
As is known in the art, a nucleoside is a base-sugar combination.  The base portion of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base.  The two most common classes of such heterocyclic bases are the purines and the pyrimidines.  Nucleotides are nucleosides that further<br><br>
include a phosphate group ccvalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside.  For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to either zne 2', 3' :r 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar.  in forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound.  In turn the respective ends of this linear polymeric structure can be further joined to form a circular structure, however, open linear structures are generally preferred,  "Within the oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the interr.ucleoside backbone of the oligonucleotide.  The normal linkage or backbone of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiescer linkage.<br>
Specific examples of preferred antisense compounds useful in this invention include oligonucleotides containing modified backbones or non-natural internucleoside linkages.  As defined in this specification, oligonucleotides having modified backbones ; include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone.  For the purposes of this specification, and as sometimes referenced in the art, modified oligonucleotides that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides.<br>
Preferred modified oligcnucleotide backbones include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkyl-phosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3'-alkylene phosphcnates, 5'-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3 '-amino phosphoramidate and<br><br>
amincalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoraiuidates, thiono-alkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, selenophosphates and boranophosphaces having normal 3'-5' linkages, 2'-5' linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein one or more internucleotide linkages is a 3' to 3', 5' to 5' or 2' to 2' linkage. Preferred oligonucleotides having inverted polarity comprise a single 3' to 3f linkage at the 3'-most internucleotide linkage i.e. a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic (the nucleobase is missing cr has a hydroxyl group in place thereof).  Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included.<br>

It is not necessary for all positions in a given compound to be uniformly modified, and in fact more than<br><br>
one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single compound or ever, at a single nucleoside within an oligonucleotide.  The present invention also includes antisense compounds which are chimeric compounds. "Chirr.eric" antisense compounds or "chimeras," in the context of this invention, are antisense compounds, particularly oligcnucleotides, which contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleccide in the case of an oligonucleotide compound.  These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one region wherein the oligonucleotide is modified so as to confer upon the oligonucleotide increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, and/or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid.  An additional region of the oligonucleotide may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RMArDNA or RNA,RNA hybrids.  By way of example, RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the KNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex.  Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of oligonucleotide inhibition of gene expression.  Consequently, comparable results can often be obtained with shorter oligonucleotides when chimeric oligonucleotides are used, compared to phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides hybridizing to the same target region.  Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known in the art.<br>
Chimeric antisense compounds of the invention may be formed as composite structures of two or more oligonucleotides, modified oligonucleotides,<br><br>
oligonucleosides and/or oligonucieotide mimetics as described above.  Such compounds have also been referred to in the art as hybrids or gapmers.  Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such hybrid structures include, but are not limited to, U.S.: 5,C13,830; 5,149,797; 5,220,007; 5,256,775; 5,366,878; 5,403,711; 5,491,133; 5,565,350; 5,623,065; 5,652,355; 5,552,356; and 5,700,922, certain of which are commonly owned with the instant application, and each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The antisense compounds used in accordance with this invention may be conveniently and routinely made through the well-known technique of solid phase synthesis. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including, for example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA; .  Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. It is well known to use similar techniques to prepare oligonucleotides such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.<br>
The antisense compounds of the invention are synthesized in vitro and do not include antisense compositions of biological origin, or genetic vector constructs designed to direct the in vivo synthesis of antisense molecules.<br>

Accordingly, for example, the disclosure is also drawn to prodrugs and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such prodrugs, and other bioequivalents.<br>
The term "prodrug" indicates a therapeutic agent that is prepared in an inactive form that is converted to an active form (i.e., drug) within the body or cells thereof by the action of endogenous enzymes or other chemicals and/or conditions.  In particular, prodrug versions of the oligonucleotides of the invention are prepared as SATE [(S-acetyl-2-thioethyl) phosphate] derivatives according to the methods disclosed in WO 93/24510 to Gosselin et al., published December 9, 1993 or in WO 94/26764 and U.S. 5,770,713 to Imbach et al.<br>

Examples of suitable amines are N,N' -dibenzylethylenediamime, chlcrcprocaine, choline, diechanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, and procaine (see, for example, Berge ec al., "Pharmaceutical Salts," J. of Pharma Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19) .  The base addition salts of said acidic compounds are prepared by contacting the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in the conventional manner.  The free acid form may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with an acid and isolating the free acid in the conventional manner.  The free acid forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their respective free acid for purposes of the present invention.  As used herein, a "pharmaceutical addition salt" includes a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an acid form of one of the components of the compositions of the invention.  These include organic or inorganic acid salts of the amines.  Preferred acid salts are the hydrochlorides, acetates, salicylates, nitrates and phosphates.

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds may also be prepared with a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable cations are well known to those skilled in the art and include alkaline, alkaline earth, ammonium and quaternary ammonium cations. Carbonates or hydrogen carbonates are also possible.<br>

The compounds of the invention can be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions by adding an effective amount of an antisense compound to a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.  Use of the antisense compounds and methods of the invention may also be useful prophylactically, e.g., to prevent or delay infection, inflammation or tumor formation, for example.<br>
The antisense compounds of the invention are useful for research and diagnostics, because these compounds hybridize to nucleic acids encoding apolipoprotein B, enabling sandwich and other assays to easily be constructed to exploit this fact.  Hybridization of the antisense oligonucleotides of the invention with a nucleic acid encoding apolipoprotein B can be detected by means, known in<br><br>
the art.  Such means may include conjugation of an enzyme to the oligonucleotide, radiolabelling of the oligcnucleotide or any other suitable detection means. Kits using such detection means for detecting the level of apolipoprotein B in a sample may also be prepared.<br>

Pharmaceutical compositions cf the present invention include, but are not limited to, solutions, emulsions, and liposome-containing formulations.  These compositions may be generated from a variety of components that include, but are not limited to, preformed liquids, self-emulsifying solids and self-emulsifying semisolids.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention, which may conveniently be presented in unit<br><br>
dosage form, may be prepared according to conventional techniques well known in the pharmaceutical industry.  Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredients with the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient (s) .  In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be formulated into any of many possible dosage forms such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gel capsules, liquid syrups, soft gels, suppositories, and enemas.  The compositions of the present invention may also be formulated as suspensions in aqueous, non-aqueous or mixed media.  Aqueous suspensions may further contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran.  The suspension may also contain stabilizers.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated and used as foams. Pharmaceutical foams include formulations such as, but not limited to, emulsions, microemulsions, creams, jellies and liposomes .  While basically similar in nature these formulations vary in the components and the consistency of the final product.  The preparation of such compositions and formulations is generally known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical and formulation arts and may be applied to the formulation of the compositions of the present invention.<br>
Emulsions<br><br>
The compositions of the-present invention may be prepared and formulated as emulsions.  Emulsions are typically heterogenous systems of one liquid dispersed in another in the form of droplets usually exceeding 0.1 jum in diameter (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199; Roscff, ir. Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger ar.d Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., Volume 1, p. 245; Block in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y. , volume 2, p. 335; Higuchi et al., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Saston, PA, 1985, p. 301)â¢  Emulsions are often biphasic systems comprising of two immiscible liquid phases intimately mixed and dispersed with each ather.  In general, emulsions may be either water-in-oil (w/o) or of the oil-in-water (o/w) variety.  When an aqueous phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk oily phase the resulting composition is called a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion.  Alternatively, when an oily phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minuce droplets into a bulk aqueous phase the resulting composition is called an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion.  Emulsions may contain additional components in addition to the dispersed phases and the active drug which may be present as a solution in either the aqueous phase, oily phase or itself as a separate phase. Pharmaceutical excipients such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, dyes, and anti-oxidants may also be present in emulsions as needed. Pharmaceutical emulsions may also be multiple emulsions that are comprised of more than two phases such as, for example, in the case of oil-in-water-<br><br>
in-oll (o/w/o) and water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsions. Such complex formulations often provide certain advantages thac simple binary emulsions do not. Multiple emulsions in which individual oil droplecs of an o/w emulsion enclose small water droplets constitute a w/o/w emulsion. Likewise a system of oil droplets enclosed in globules of water stabilized in an oily continuous provides an o/w/o emulsion.<br>
Emulsions are characterized by little or no thermodynamic stability. Often, the dispersed or discontinuous phase of the emulsion is well dispersed into the external or continuous phase and maintained in this form through the means of emulsifiers or the viscosity of the formulation.  Either of the phases of the emulsion may be a semisolid or a solid, as is the case of emulsion-style ointment bases and creams.  Other means of stabilizing emulsions entail the use of emulsifiers that may be incorporated into either phase of the emulsion. Emulsifiers may broadly be classified into four categories: synthetic surfactants, naturally occurring emulsifiers, absorption bases, and finely dispersed solids (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume<br>
1, p. 199).<br>
Synthetic surfactants, also known as surface active agents, have found wide applicability in the formulation of emulsions and have been reviewed in the literature (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 285;  Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y,, 1988, volume 1, p. 199).  Surfactants are<br><br>
typically amphiphilic and comprise a hydrcphilic and a hydrophobic portion.  The ratio of the hydrophilic to the hydrophobic nature of ths surfactant has been termed the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB) and is a valuable tool in categorizing and selecting surfactants in the preparation of formulations.  Surfactants may be classified into different classes based on the nature of the hydrophilic group: nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric (Rieger, in Pharxaceuzical Dcsage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y. ,  volume 1, p. 2 85}.<br>
Naturally occurring emulsifiers used in emulsion formulations include lanolin, beeswax, phosphatides, lecithin and acacia.  Absorption bases possess hydrophilic properties such that they can soak up water to form w/o emulsions yet retain their semisolid consistencies, -such as anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum.  Finely divided solids have also been used as good emulsifiers especially in combination with surfactants and in viscous preparations.  These include polar inorganic solids, such as heavy metal hydroxides, nonswelling clays such as bentonite, attapulgite, hectorite, kaolin, montmorillonite, colloidal aluminum silicate and colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate, pigments and nonpolar solids such as carbon or glyceryl tristearate.<br>
A large variety of non-emulsifying materials are also included in emulsion formulations and contribute to the properties of emulsions.  These include fats, oils, waxes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty esters, humectants, hydrophilic colloids, preservatives and antioxidants (Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York,<br><br>
N.Y., volume 1, p. 335; idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, IM.Y. , volume 1, p. 199).<br>
Hydrophilic colloids or hydrocolloids include naturally occurring gums and synthetic polymers such as pclysaccharides (for example, acacia, agar, alginic acid, carrageenan, guar gum, karaya gum, and rragacan-h) , cellulose derivatives (for example, carboxymethy1cellulose ar.d carboxypropylcellulcse), and synthetic polymers (for example, carbomers, cellulose ethers, and carbcxyvinyl polymers) .  These disperse or swell in water tc form colloidal solutions that stabilize emulsions by forming strong interfacial films around the dispersed-phase droplets and by increasing the viscosity of the external phase.<br>
Since emulsions often contain a number of ingredients such as carbohydrates, proteins, sterols and phosphatides that may readily support; the growth of microbes, these formulations often incorporate preservatives.  Commonly used preservatives included in emulsion formulations include methyl paraben, propyl paraben, quaternary ammonium salts, benzalkonium chloride, esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and boric acid.  Antioxidants are also commonly added to emulsion formulations to prevent deterioration of the formulation.  Antioxidants used may be free radical scavengers such as tocopherols, alkyl gallates, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, or reducing agents such as ascorbic acid and sodium metabisulfite, and antioxidant synergists such as citric acid, tartaric acid, and lecithin.<br>
The application of emulsion formulations via dermatological, oral and parenteral routes and methods for<br><br>
their manufacture have been, reviewed in the literature (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, M.Y.,  volume 1, p. 199).  Emulsion formulations for oral delivery have been very widely used because of reasons of ease of formulation, efficacy from an absorption and bioavailability standpoint. (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199).  Mineral-oil base laxatives, oil-soluble vitamins and high fat nutritive preparations are among the materials that have commonly been administered orally as o/w emulsions.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the compositions of oligonucleotides and nucleic acids are formulated as microemulsions .  A microemulsion may be defined as a system of water, oil and amphiphile which is a single optically isotropic and thermodynamically stable liquid solution (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.,  volume 1, p. 245).  Typically microemulsions are systems that are prepared by first dispersing an oil in an aqueous surfactant solution and then adding a sufficient amount of a fourth component, generally an intermediate chain-length alcohol to form a transparent system.  Therefore, microemulsions have also been described as thermodynamically stable, isotropically clear dispersions of two immiscible liquids that are stabilised by interfacial films of surface-active molecules (Leung and Shah, in: Controlled Release of Drugs: Polymers<br><br>
and Aggregate Systems, Rosoff, M. , Ed., 1989, VCH Publishers, New York, pages 185-215).  Microemulsions commonly are prepared via a combination cf three to five components that include oil, water, surfactant, cosurfactant and electrolyte.  Whether the microemulsion is of the water-in-oil (w/o) or an oil-in-water (o/w) type is dependent on the properties of the oil and surfactant used and en the structure and geometric packing of the polar heads and hydrocarbon tails of the surfactant molecules<br>
{Schctt, in -Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, ?A, 1985, p. 271) .<br>
The phenomenological approach utilising phase diagrams has ceen extensively studied and has yielded a comprehensive knowledge, to one skilled in the art, of how to formulate microemulsions (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman,' Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245; Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 335).  Compared to conventional emulsions, microemulsions offer the advantage of solubilizing water-insoluble drugs in a formulation of thermodynamically stable droplets that are formed spontaneously.<br>
Surfactants used in the preparation of microemulsions include, but are not limited to, ionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, Brij 96, polyoxyethylene oleyl ethers, polyglycerol fatty acid esters, tetraglycerol monolaurate<br>
(ML310), tetraglycerol monooleate (MO310), hexaglycerol monooleate (PO310), hexaglycerol pentaoleate (PO500), decaglycerol monocaprate (MCA750), decaglycerol monooleate<br>
(MO750), decaglycerol sequioleate (SO750), decaglycerol<br><br>
decaoleate (DAO750), alone or in combination with cosurfactants.  The cosurfac-ant, usually a short-chain alcohol such as ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol, serves to increase the interfaciai fluidiry by penetrating into the surfactant film and consequently creating a disordered film because of the void space generated among surfactant molecules.  Microemuisions may, however, be prepared without the use of cosurfactants a~d alcohol-free self-emulsifying microemulsion systems are known in the art. The aqueous phase may typically be, but is not limited to, water, an aqueous solution of the drug, giycerol, PEG3 00, PEG400, polyglycerols, propylene glycols, and derivatives of ethylene glycol.  The oil phase may include, but is not limited to, materials such as Captex 3 00, Captex 3 55, Capmul MCM, fatty acid esters, medium chain (C8-C12) mono, di, and tri-glycerides, polycxyethylated glyceryl fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, polyglycolized glycerides, saturated polyglycolized C8-C10 glycerides, vegetable oils and silicone oil.<br>
Microemuisions are particularly of interest from the standpoint of drug solubilization and the enhanced absorption of drugs.  Lipid based r.icroemulsions (both o/w and w/o) have been proposed to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs, including peptides (Constantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994, 11, 13 85-1390; Ritschel, Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol., 1993, 13, 205).  Microemuisions afford advantages of improved drug solubilization, protection of drug from enzymatic hydrolysis, possible enhancement of drug absorption due to surfactant-induced alterations in membrane fluidity and permeability, ease of preparation, ease of oral administration over solid dosage forms,<br><br>
improved clinical potency, and decreased toxicity (Cor.stantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994, 11, 1335; 'do et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1996, 85, 138-143).  Often microemulsions may form spontaneously when their components are brought together at ambient temperature.  This may be particularly advantageous when formulating thermolabile drugs, peptides or oligonucleotides.  Microemulsions have alsc been effective in the transdermal delivery of active components in both cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications.  It is expected that the microexnulsion compositions and formulations of the present invention will facilitate the increased systemic absorption of oligonucleotides and nucleic acids from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as improve the local cellular uptake of oligonucleotides and nucleic acids within the gastrointestinal tract, vagina, buccal cavity and other areas of administration.<br>
Microemulsions of the present invention may also contain additional components and additives such as sorbitan monostearate (Grill 3), Labrasol, and penetration enhancers to improve the properties of the formulation and to enhance the absorption of the oligonucleotides and nucleic acids of the present invention.  Penetration enhancers used in the microemulsions of the present invention may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories - surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92)â¢  Each of these classes has been discussed above.<br>
Liposomes<br><br>
There are many organized surfactant structures besides microemulsions that have been studied and used for the formulation of drugs.  These include monolayers, micelles, bilayers and vesicles.  Vesicles, such as liposomes, have attracted great interest because of their specificity and the duration of action they offer from the standpoint of drug delivery.  As used in the present invention, the term "liposome" means a vesicle composed of amphiphilic lipids arranged in a spherical bilayer or bilayers.<br>
Liposomes are unilamellar or raultilamellar vesicles which have a membrane formed from a lipophilic material and an aqueous interior.  The aqueous portion contains the composition to be delivered.  Cationic liposomes possess the advantage of being able to fuse to the cell wall.  Non-cationic liposomes, although not able to fuse as-efficiently with the cell wall, are taken up by macrophages in vivo.<br>
In order to cross intact mammalian skin, lipid vesicles must pass through a series of fine pores, each with a diameter less than 50 nm, under the influence of a suitable transdermal gradient.  Therefore, it is desirable to use a liposome which is highly deformable and able to pass through such fine pores.<br>
Further advantages of liposomes include; liposomes obtained from natural phospholipids are biocompatible and biodegradable; liposomes can incorporate a wide range of water and lipid soluble drugs; liposomes can protect encapsulated drugs in their internal compartments from metabolism and degradation (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds,), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.,  volume 1, p. 245). Important considerations in the preparation of liposome<br><br>
formulations are the lipid surface charge, vesicle size and the aqueous volume of the liposomes.<br>
Liposomes are useful for the transfer and delivery of active ingredients to the site of action.  Because the liposomal membrane is structurally similar to biological membranes, when liposcrr.es are applied to a tissue, the lipcsomes start to merge with the cellular membranes.  As the merging of the liposone and cell progresses, the liposomal contents are emptied inzo the cell where the active agent may act.<br>
Liposomal formulations have been the focus of extensive investigation as the mode of delivery for many drugs.  There is growing evidence that for topical administration, liposomes present several advantages over other formulations.  Such advantages include reduced side-effects related to high systemic absorption of the administered drug, increased accumulation of the administered drug at the desired target, and the ability to administer a wide variety of drugs, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic, into the skin.<br>
Several reports have detailed the ability of liposomes to deliver agents including high-molecular weight DNA into the skin.  Compounds including analgesics, antibodies, hormones and high-molecular weight DNAs have been administered to the skin.  The majority of applications resulted in the targeting of the upper epidermis.<br>
Liposomes fall into two broad classes.  Cationic liposomes are positively charged liposomes which interact with the negatively charged DNA molecules to form a stable complex.  The positively charged DNA/liposome complex binds to the negatively charged cell surface and is internalized in an endosome.  Due to the acidic pH within the endosome,<br><br>
the liposomes are ruptured, releasing their contents into the cell cytoplasm (Wang et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comxnun., 1987, 147, 980-985).<br>
Liposomes which are pH-sensitive or<br>
negatively-charged, entrap DNA rather than complex with it. Since both the DNA and the lipid are similarly charged, repulsion rather than complex formation occurs. Nevertheless, some DNA is entrapped within the aqueous interior of these liposomes. pH-sensitive liposomes have been used to deliver DNA encoding the thymidine kinase gene to cell monolayers in culture. Expression of the exogenous gene was detected in the target cells (Zhou et al., Journal of Controlled Release, 1992, 19, 269-274) .<br>
One major type of liposomal composition includes phospholipids other than naturally-derived phosphatidylcholine.  Neutral liposome compositions, for example, can be formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC).  Anionic liposome compositions generally are formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, while anionic fusogenic liposomes are formed primarily from dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) .  Another type of liposomal composition is formed from phosphatidylcholine (PC) such as, for example, soybean PC, and egg PC.  Another type is formed from mixtures of phospholipid and/or phosphatidylcholine and/or cholesterol.<br>
Several studies have assessed the topical delivery of liposomal drug formulations to the skin.  Application of liposomes containing interferon to guinea pig skin resulted in a reduction of skin herpes sores while delivery of interferon via other means (e.g. as a solution or as an emulsion) were ineffective (Weiner et al., Journal of Drug Targeting, 1992, 2, 405-410) .  Further, an additional study<br><br>
tested the efficacy of interferon administered as part of a liposomal formulation to the administration of interferon using an aqueous system, and concluded that the iiposomal formulation was superior to aqueous administration (du Plessis et al., Antiviral Research, 1992, 18, 259-265),<br>
Non-ionic iiposorr.al systems have also been examined to determine cheir utility in the delivery of drugs to the skin, in particular systems comprising non-ionic surfactant and cholesterol.  Non-ionic liposomal formulations<br>
comprising Novasomeâ¢ I (glyceryl<br>
dilaurate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) and Novasomeâ¢ II (glyceryl distearate/<br>
cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) were used to deliver cyclosporin-A into the dermis of mouse skin. Results indicated that such non-ionic liposomai systems were effective in facilitating the deposition of cyclosporin-A into different layers of the skin (Hu et al. S.T.P.Pharma. Sci., 1994, 4, 6, 466) .<br>
Liposomes also include "sterically stabilized" liposomes, a term which, as used herein, refers to liposomes comprising one or more specialized lipids that, when incorporated into liposomes, result in enhanced circulation lifetimes relative to liposomes lacking such specialized lipids.  Examples of sterically stabilized liposomes are those in which part of the vesicle-forming lipid portion of the liposome (A) comprises one or more glycolipids, such as monosialoganglioside GMI/ or (B) is derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety.  While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought in the art that, at least for sterically stabilized liposomes containing gangliosides, sphingomyelin, or PEG-derivatized<br><br>
lipids, the enhanced circulation half-life of these sterically stabilised iiposomes derives from a reduced uptake into cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (Allen et al. , FEBS Letters, 1987, 223, 42; Wu et al., Cancer Research, 1993, 53,- 37 65) .<br>
Various Iiposomes comprising one or more glycolipids are known in the art.  Papahadjopoulos et al. (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1987,  507, 64) reported the ability of mcnosialoganglioside GMI, galactocerebroside sulfate and phosphatidylinositol to improve blood half-lives of Iiposomes.  These findings were expounded upon by Gabizon et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1988, 85, 6949). U.S. Patent No. 4,337,028 and WO 88/04924, both to Allen et al. , disclose liposcmes comprising (1) sphingomyelin and (2) the ganglioside GMI or a galactocerebroside sulfate ester.  U.S. Patent No. 5,543,152 (Webb et al.) discloses Iiposomes comprising sphingomyelin.  Liposomes comprising 1,2-sn-dimyristoyiphosphatidylcholine are disclosed in WO 97/13499 (Lira et al.) .<br>
Many liposomes comprising lipids derivatized with one. or more hydrophilic polymers, and methods of preparation thereof, are known in the art.  Sunamoto et al. (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn:, 1980, 53, 2118) described liposomes comprising a nonionic detergent, 2C12l5G, that contains a PEG moiety.  Ilium et al. (FEBS Lett., 1984, 167, 79) noted that hydrophilic coating of polystyrene particles with polymeric glycols results in significantly enhanced blood half-lives.  Synthetic phospholipids modified by the attachment of carboxylic groups of polyalkylene glycols {e.g., PEG) are described by Sears (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,426,330 and 4,5-34,399).  Klibanov et al. (FEBS Lett., 1990, 268, 235) described experiments demonstrating that<br><br>
liposomes comprising phosphatidylefchanolairiine (PE) derivatized with PEG or PEG stearate have significant increases in blood circulation half-lives.  Blume et al. {Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1990, 1029, 91) extended such observations to orher PEG-derivatized phospholipids, e.g., DSPE-PEG, formed from the combination of distearoylphosphatidylethanolamins (DSPS) and PEG. Liposomes having covalently bound PEG moieties on their external surface are described in European Patent No. E? C 445 131 Bl and WO 90/04384 to Fisher.  Liposome compositions containing 1-20 mole percent of PE derivatized with PEG, and methods of use thereof, are described by Woodle et al. (U.S. Patent Nos. 5/013,556 and 5,356,633) and Martin et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,213,804 and European Patent No. EP 0 496 813 Bl) .  Liposomes comprising a number of other lipid-polymer conjugates are disclosed in. WO 91/05545 and U.S. Patent No. 5,225,212 (both to Martin et al.) and in WO 94/20073 (Zalipsky et al.)  Liposomes comprising PEG-modified ceramide lipids are described in WO 96/10391 (Choi et al.).  U.S. Patent Nos- 5,540,935 (Miyazaki et al.) and 5,556,948 (Tagawa et al.) describe PEG-containing liposomes that can be further derivatized with functional moieties on their surfaces.<br>
A limited number of liposomes comprising nucleic acids are known in the art.  WO 96/40062 to Thierry et al. discloses methods for encapsulating high molecular weight nucleic acids in liposomes.  U.S. Patent No. 5,264,221 to Tagawa et al. discloses protein-bonded liposomes and asserts that the contents of such liposomes may include an antisense RNA. U.S. Patent No. 5,665,710 to Rahman et al. "describes certain methods of encapsulating oligodeoxynucleotides in liposomes.  WO 97/04787 to Love et<br><br>
 discloses liposomes comprising antisense oiigonucleotides targeted to the raf gene.<br>
Transfersomes are yet another type of liposomes, and are highly deformable lipid aggregates which are attractive candidates for drug delivery vehicles.  Transfersomes may be described as lipid droplets which are so highly defcrmable that they are easily able to penetrate through pores which are smaller than the droplet.  Transfersomes are adaptable to the environment in which they are used, e.g. they are self-optimizing (adaptive to the shape of pores in the skin), self-repairing/ frequently reach their targets without fragmenting, and often self-loading.  To make transfersomes it is possible to add surface edge-activators, usually surfactants, to a standard liposomal composition.  Transfersomes have been used to deliver serum albumin to the skin.  The transfersome-mediated delivery of serum albumin has been shown to be as effective as subcutaneous injection of a solution containing serum albumin.<br>
Surfactants find wide application in formulations such as emulsions (including microemulsions) and liposomes.  The most common way of classifying and ranking the properties of the many different types of surfactants, both natural and synthetic, is by the use of the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB).  The nature of the hydrophilic group (also known as the "head") provides the most useful means for categorizing the different surfactants used in formulations (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY, 1988, p. 285).<br>
If the surfactant molecule is not ionized, it is classified as a nonionic surfactant.  Nonionic-surfactants find wide application in pharmaceutical and cosmetic<br><br>
products and are usable over a wide range of pH values.  In general their HLB values range from 2 to about 18 depending on their structure.  Nonionic surfactants include nonionic esters such as ethylene glycol es-ers, propylene glycol esters, glyceryl esters, polyglyceryl esters, sorbitan esters, sucrose esters, and ethoxylated esters.  Nonionic alkanolamid.es and ethers such as fatty alcohol ethoxylates, prcpcxylated alcohols, and ethoxylated/propoxylated block polymers are also included in this class.  The polyoxyethylene surfactants are the most popular members of the nonionic surfactant class.<br>
If the surfactant molecule carries a negative charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as anionic.  Anionic surfactants include carboxylates such as soaps, acyl lactylates, acyl amides of amino acids, esters of gulfuric acid such as alkyl sulfates and ethoxylated alkyl sulfates, sulfonates such as alkyl benzene sulfonates, acyl! isethionates,. acyl taurates and sulfosuccinates, and phosphates.  The most important members of the anionic surfactant class are the alkyl sulfates and the soaps.<br>
If the surfactant molecule carries a positive charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as cationic.  Cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts and ethcxylated amines.  The quaternary ammonium salts are the most used members of this class.<br>
If the surfactant molecule has the ability to carry either a positive or negative charge, the surfactant is classified as amphoteric.  Amphoteric surfactants include acrylic acid derivatives, substituted alkylamides, N-alkylbetaines and phosphatides.<br><br>
The use of surfactants in drug products, formulations and in emulsions has been reviewed (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY, 1988, p. 285).<br>
Penetration Enhancers<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention employs various penetration enhancers to effect the efficient delivery of nucleic acids, particularly oligonucleotides/ to "he skin of animals.  Most drugs are present in solution in both ionized and nonionized forms.  However, usually only lipid soluble or lipophilic drugs readily cross cell membranes.  It has been discovered that even non-lipophilic drugs may cross cell membranes if the membrane to be crossed is treated with a penetration enhancer.  In addition to aiding the diffusion of non-lipophilic drugs across cell membranes, penetration enhancers also enhance the permeability of lipophilic drugs.<br>
Penetration enhancers may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories, i.e., surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p.92).  Each of the above mentioned classes of penetration enhancers are described below in greater detail.<br>
Surfactants: In connection with the present invention, surfactants (or "surface-active agents") are chemical entities which, when dissolved in an aqueous solution, reduce the surface tension of the solution or the interfacial tension between the aqueous solution and another liquid, with the result that absorption of oligonucleotides through the mucosa is enhanced.  In<br><br>
addition to bile salts and fatty acids, these penetration enhancers include, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, poiyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether) (Lee at al. , Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug-Carrier Systems, 1991, p.92); and perfluorochemical emulsions, such as FC-43. Takahashi et al., j. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1988, 40, 252).<br>
Fatty acids: Various fatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers include, for example, oleic acid, lauric acid, capric acid (n-decanoic acid), myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein (1-moncoleoyl-rac-glycerol)_,1 dilaurir., caprylic acid, arachidonic acid, glycerol 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, acylcarnitines, acylcholines, C1-10 alkyl esters thereof (e.g., methyl, isopropyl and t-butyl), and mono- and di-glycerides thereof (i.e., oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, linoleate, etc.) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p.92; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; El Hariri et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1992, 44, 651-654).<br>
Bile salts: The physiological role of bile includes the facilitation of dispersion and absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins (Brunton, Chapter 38 in: Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed., Hardman et al. Eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, pp. 934-935). Various natural bile sal-s, and their synthetic derivatives, act as penetration enhancers.  Thus the term "bile salts" includes any of the naturally occurring<br><br>
components of bile as well as any of their synthetic derivatives.   The bile salts of the invention include, for example, cholic acid (or its pharmaceutically acceptable sodium salt, sodium cholate), dehydrocholic acid (sodium dehydrocholate), deoxycholic acid (sodium deoxycholate), glucholic acid (sodium, giucholate) , glycholic acid (sodium glycocholate), glycodeoxycholic acid (sodium giycodeoxycholate), taurocholic acid (sodium taurocholate), taurodeoxycholic acid (sodium taurodeoxycholate) , chenodeoxycholic acid (sodium chenodeoxycholate), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), sodium tauro-24,25-dihydro-fusidate (STDHF), sodium glycodihydrofusidate and polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (POE) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Sv/inyard, Chapter 39 In: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Hack Publishing Co., Saston, PA, 1990, pages 782-783; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33;<br>
..V"<br>
Yamamoto et al,, J. Pharm. Exp. Ther., 1992, 263, 25; Yamashita et al.t J. Pharm. Sci., 1990, 79, 579-583). Chelating Agents:  Chelating agents, as used in connection with the present invention, can be defined as compounds that remove metallic ions from solution by forming complexes therewith, with the result that absorption of oligonucleotides through the mucosa is enhanced.  With regards to their use as penetration enhancers in the present invention, chelating agents have the added advantage of also serving as DNase inhibitors, as most characterized DNA nucleases require a divalent metal ion for catalysis and are thus inhibited by chelating agents (Jarrett, J. Chromatogr. , 1993, 618, 315-339). Chelating agents of the invention include but are not<br><br>
limited to disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (2DTA) , citric acid, salicylates (e.g., sodium salicylate, 5-rnethoxysalicylate and homovanilate) , N-acyl derivatives of collagen, laureth-9 and N-amino acyl derivatives of beta-diketones (enamines)(Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Muranishi, Cridcal Reviews in Therapeutic Drug- Carrier Systems, 1990,, 7, 1-33; Buur et al., J. Control Rel. , 1990, 14f 43-51).<br>
Non-chelating non-surfactants:  As used herein, non-chelating non-surfactant penetration enhancing compounds can be defined as compounds that demonstrate insignificant activity as chelating agents or as surfactants but that nonetheless enhance absorption of oligonucleotides through the alimentary mucosa (Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug- Carrier Systems, 1990, 7 f 1-33) .  This class of penetration enhancers .include, for example, unsaturated cyclic ureas, 1-alkyl- and 1-alkenylazacyclo-alkanone derivatives (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug- Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as diclofenac sodium, indomethacin and phenylbuta2one (Yamashita et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1987, 39, 621-626).<br>
Agents that enhance uptake of oligonucleotides at the cellular level may also be added to the pharmaceutical and other compositions of the present invention-  For example, cationic lipids, such as lipofectin (Junichi et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,705,188), cationic glycerol derivatives, and polycationic molecules, such as polylysine (Lollo et al.t PCT Application WO 97/30731), are also known to enhance the cellular uptake of oligonucleotides.<br>
Other agents may be utilized to enhance the penetration of the administered nucleic acids, including<br><br>
glycols such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, pyrrols such as 2-pyrrol, azones," and terpenes such as limonene and menthone.<br>
Carriers<br>
Certain compositions of the present invention also incorporate carrier compounds in -he formulation.  As used herein, "carrier compound1' or "carrier" can refer to a nucleic acid, or analog thereof, which is inert (i.e., does not possess biological activity per se) but is recognized as a nucleic acid by in vivo processes that reduce the bioavailability of a nucleic acid having biological activity by, for example, degrading the biologically active nucleic acid or promoting its removal from circulation. The coadministration of a nucleic acid and a carrier compound, typically with an excess of the latter substance, can result in a substantial reduction of the amount of nucleic acid recovered in the liver, kidney or other extracirculatory reservoirs, presumably due to competition between the carrier compound and the nucleic acid for a common receptor.  For example, the recovery of a partially phosphorothioate oligonucleotide in hepatic tissue can be reduced when it is coadministered with polyinosinic acid, dextran sulfate, polycytidic acid or 4-acetamido-4 ' isothiocyano-stilbene-2, 2 ' -disulfonic acid (Miyao et al. , Antisense Res. Dev., 1995, 5, 115-121; Takakura et al., Antisense &amp; Nucl. Acid Drug Dev., 1996, 6, 177-183) .<br>
Excipients<br>
In contrast to a carrier compound, a "pharmaceutical carrier" or "excipient" is a pharmaceutically acceptable<br><br>
solvent, suspending agent or any other pharmacologically inert vehicle for delivering one or more nucleic acids to an animal.  The excipient may be liquid or solid and is selected, with the planned manner of administration in mind, so as to provide for the desired bulk, consistency, etc., when combined with a nucleic acid and the other components of a given pharmaceutical composition.  Typical pharmaceutical carriers include, but are not limited to, binding agents {e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, etc.); fillers {e.g., lactose and other sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, pectin, gelatin, calcium sulfate, ethyl cellulose, polyacrylates or calcium hydrogen phosphate, etc.); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, silica, colloidal silicon dioxide, stearic acid, metallic stearates, hydrogenated vegetable oils, corn starch, polyethylene glycols, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, etc.); disintegrants (e.g., starch, sodium starch glycolate, etc.); and wetting agents {e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, etc.).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic excipient suitable for non-parenteral administration which do not deleteriously react with nucleic acids can also be used to formulate the compositions of the present invention.  Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohols, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like.<br>
Formulations for topical administration of nucleic acids may include sterile and non-sterile aqueous solutions, non-aqueous solutions in common solvents such as<br><br>
alcohols, or solutions of the nucleic acids in liquid or solid oil bases.  The solutions may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives,  Pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic excipients suitable for non-parentsral administration which do not deleteriously react with nucleic acids can be used.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohol, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinyipyrrolidone and the like.<br>
Pulsatile Delivery<br>
-a.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered by pulsatile delivery.  "Pulsatile delivery" refers to a pharmaceutical formulations that delivers a first pulse of drug combined with a penetration enhancer and a second pulse of penetration enhancer to promote absorption of drug which" is not absorbed upon release with the first pulse of penetration enhancer.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is a delayed release oral formulation for enhanced intestinal drug absorption, comprising:<br>
(a)	a first populatio.n of carrier particles comprising<br>
said drug and a penetration enhancer, wherein said drug and<br>
said penetration enhancer are released at a first location<br>
in the intestine; and<br>
(b)	a second population of carrier particles<br>
comprising a penetration enhancer and a delayed release<br>
coating or matrix, wherein the penetration enhancer is<br>
released at a second location in the intestine downstream<br><br>
from the first location, whereby absorption of the drug is enhanced when the drug reaches the second location.<br>
Alternatively, the penetration enhancer in (a) and (b) is different.<br>
This enhancement is obtained by encapsulating at least two populations of carrier particles. The first population of carrier particles comprises a biologically active substance and a penetration enhancer, and the second (and optionally additional) population of carrier particles cor.prises a penetration enhancer and a delayed release coating or matrix.<br>
A "first pass effect" that applies to orally administered drugs is degradation due to the action of gastric acid and various digestive enzymes.  One means of ameliorating first pass clearance effects is to increase the dose of administered drug, thereby compensating for proportion of drug lost to first pass clearance.  Although this may be readily achieved with i.v. administration by, for example, simply providing more of the drug to an animal, other factors influence the bioavailability of drugs administered via non-parenteral means.  For example, a drug may be enzymaticaily or chemically degraded in the alimentary canal or blood stream and/or may be impermeable or semipermeable to various mucosal membranes.<br>
It is also contemplated that these pharmacutical compositons are capable of enhancing absorption of biologically active substances when administered via the rectal, vaginal, nasal or pulmonary routes.  It is also contemplated that release of the biologically active substance can be achieved in any part of the gastrointestinal- tract.<br><br>
Liquid pharmaceutical compositions of oligonucleotide car. be prepared by combining the oligonucleotide with a suitable vehicle, for example sterile pyrogen free water, or saline solution.  Other therapeutic compounds may optionally be included.<br>
The present invention also contemplates the use of solid particulate compositions.  Such compositions preferably comprise particles of oligonucleotide that are of respirable size.  Such particles can be prepared by, for example, grinding dry oligonucleotide by conventional means, fore example with a mortar and pestle, and then passing the resulting powder composition through a 400 mesh screen to segregate large particles and agglomerates.  A solid particulate composition comprised of an active oligonucleotide can optionally contain a dispersant which serves to facilitate the formaticr. of an aerosol,, for example lactose.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, oligonucleotide compositions can be aerosolized. Aerosolization of liquid particles can be produced by any suitable means, such as with a nebulizer.  See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,501,729. Nebulizers are commercially available devices which transform solutions or suspensions into a therapeutic aerosol mist either by means of acceleration of a compressed gas, typically air or oxygen, through a narrow venturi orifice or by means of ultrasonic agitation.  Suitable nebulizers include those sold by BlairexÂ® under the name PARI LC PLUS, PARI DURA-NEB 2000, PARI-BABY Size, PARI PR0NE3 Compressor with LC PLUS, PARI WALKHALER Compressor/Nebulizer System, PARI LC PLUS 'Reusable Nebulizer, and PARI LC Jet+ Nebulizer.<br><br>
 rormulations for use in nebulizers consist of an oligonucleotide in a liquid, such as sterile, pyragen free water, or saline solution, wherein the oligonucleotide comprises up to about 40% w/w of the forrr.ulation. Preferably, the oligonucleotide comprises less than 20% w/w.  If desired, further additives such as preservatives (for example, methyl hydrcxybenzoate) antioxidants, and flavoring agents can be added to the composition.<br>
Solid particles comprising an oligonucleotide can also be aerosolized using any solid particular medicament aerosol generator known in the art.  Such aerosol generators produce respirable particles, as described above, and further produce reproducible metered dose per unit volume of aerosol. . Suitable solid particulate aerosol generators include insufflators and metered dose inhalers. Metered dose inhalers are used in the art and are useful in the present invention.<br>
Preferably, liquid for solid aerosols are produced at a<br>
rate of from about 10 td 150 liters per minute, more<br>
preferably from about 30 to 150 liters per minute, and most preferably about 60 liters per minute.<br>
Enhanced bioavailability of biologically active substances is also achieved via the oral administration of the compositions and methods of the present invention.  The term "bioavailability" refers to a measurement of what portion of an adininistered drug reaches the circulatory system when a non-parenteral mode of administration is used to introduce the drug into an animal.<br>
Penetration enhancers include, but are not limited to, members of molecular classes such as surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactant molecules. (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in<br><br>
Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92) . Carriers are inert molecules that may be included in the compositions of the present invention to interfere with processes that lead to reduction in the levels of bicavailable drug.<br>
Other Components<br>
The compositions of the present invention may additionally contain other adjunct components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage levels.  Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional, compatible, pharmaceutically-active materials such as, for example, antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the compositions of the present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antiqxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers.  However, such materials, when added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the components of the compositions of the present invention.  The formulations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously interact with the nucleic acid(s) of the formulation.<br>
Aqueous suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example-, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran.  The suspension may also contain stabilizers.<br><br>
Certain embodiments of the invention provide pharmaceutical compositions containing (a) one or more antisense compounds and (b) one or more other chemotherapeutic agents which function by a non-antisense mechanism. Examples of such chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited tc daunorubicin, daunomycin, dactinomycin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, esorubicin, bleomycin, mafosfamide, ifosfamide, cytosine arabinoside, bis-chloroethylnitrosurea, busulfan, mitomycin C, actinomycin D, mithramycin, prednisone,<br>

See, generally, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 15th Ed. 1987, pp. 1206-1228, Berkow et al., eds., Rahway, N.J. When used with the compounds of the invention, such chemotherapeutic agents may be used individually (e.g., 5-FU and oligonucleotide) , sequentially {e.g., 5-FU and oligonucleotide for a period of time followed by MTX and oligonucleotide) , or in combination with one or more other such chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., 5-FU, MTX and oligonucleotide, or 5-FU, radiotherapy and oligonucleotide).  Anti-inflammatory drugs, including but not limited to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and<br><br>
corcicosteroids, and antiviral drugs, including but not limited to ribivirin, vidarabine, acyclovir and ganciclcvir, may also be combined in compositions of the invention. See, generally, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 15th Ed., Berkow et al. , eds. , 1987, Rahway, N.J., pages 2499-2506 and 46-49, respectively).  Ocher non-antisense chemotherapeutic agents are also within the scope of this invention.  Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially.<br>
In another related embodiment, compositions of the invention may contain one or more antisense compounds, particularly oligonucleotides, targeted to a first nucleic acid and one or more additional antisense compounds targeted to a second nucleic acid target. Numerous examples of and sense compounds are known in the art. Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially.<br>
The formulation of therapeutic compositions and their subsequent administration is believed to be within the skill of those in the art.  Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease state to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved.  Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient.  Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates-  Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual oligonucleotides, and can generally be estimated based on EC50S found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models,  in general, dosage is from 0.01 ug to 100 g per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly,<br><br>
monthly or yearly, or even once every 2 to 20 years. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can easily estimate repetition rates for dosing based on measured residence times and concentrations of the drug in bodily fluids or tissues.  Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the oligonucieotide is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.01 ug to 100 g per kg of body weight, once or more daily, to once every 20 years.<br>

i<br>
the invention and the thetapeutic/prophylactic compound(s) are co-administered as a mixture or administered individually.  In one aspect, the route of administration is the same for the compound(s) of the invention and the therapeutic/prophylactic compound(s), while in other aspects, the compound(s) of the invention and the therapeutic/prophylactic compound(s) are administered by a different routes.  In one embodiment, the dosages of the compound<s of the invention and></s>
therapeutic/prophylactic compound(s) are amounts that are therapeutically or prophylactically effective for each compound when administered individually. Alternatively, the combined administration permits use of lower dosages than would be required to achieve a therapeutic" or prophylactic effect if administered individually, and such methods are<br><br>
useful in decreasing one or more side effects of the reduced-dose, compound.<br>
In one aspect, a compound of the present invention and one cr more other therapeutic/prophylactic compound(s) effective at treating a condition are administered wherein both compounds act through the same or different mechanisms .

In another aspect, methods are provided to target a compound of the invention to a specific tissue, organ or location in the body.  Exemplary targets include liver, lung,- kidney, heart, and atherosclerotic plaques within a<br><br>
blood vessel.  Methods of targeting compounds are well known in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, the compound is targeted by direct or local administration,  For example, when targeting a blood vessel, the compound is administered directly to the relevant portion of the vessel from inside the lumen of the vessel, e.g., single balloon or double balloon catheter, or through the adventitia with material aiding slow release of the compound, e.g., a pluronic gel system as described by Simons et al. , Nature 359: 67-70 (1992).  Other slow release techniques for local delivery of the compound to a vessel include coating a scent with the compound.  Methods of delivery of antisense compounds to a blood vessel are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,159,946, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
When targeting a particular tissue or organ, the compound may be administered in or around that tissue or organ. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,547,787, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses methods and devices for targeting therapeutic agents to the heart.  In one aspect, administration occurs by direct injection or by injection into a blood vessel associated with the tissue or organ.  For example, when targeting the liver, the compound may be administered by injection or infusion through the portal vein.<br>
In another aspect, methods of targeting a compound are provided which include associating the compound with an agent that directs uptake of the compound by one or more cell types.  Exemplary agents include lipids and lipid-based structures such as liposomes generally in combination with an organ- or tissue-specific targeting moiety such as, for example, an antibody, a cell surface receptor, a ligand<br><br>
for a cell surface receptor, a polysaccharide, a drug, a hormone, a hapten, a special lipid and a nucleic acid as described in U. S. Patent No. 6,495,532, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,331, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes the coupling of proteins to liposomes through use of a crosslinking agent having at least one maleimido group and an amine reactive function; U.S. Pat.

The 2'-O-aminooxyethyl guanosine analog may be obtained by selective 2'-O-alkylation of diaminopurine riboside. Multigram quantities of diaminopurine riboside may be purchased from Schering AG (Berlin) to provide 2'-O-(2-ethylacetyl) diaminopurine riboside along with a minor amount of the 3'-O-isomer; 2'-O-(2-ethylacetyl) diaminopurine riboside may be resolved and converted to 2'-0-(2-ethylacetyl)guanosine by treatment with adenosine deaminase. (McGee, D. P. C., Cook, P. D., Guinosso, C. J., WO 94/02501 Al  940203.)  Standard protection procedures should afford 2'-O-(2-ethylacetyl)-5'-O-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)guanosine and 2-N-isobutyryl-6-O-diphenylcarbamoyl-2'-O-(2-ethylacetyl)-5'-O-(4,4 ?-dimethoxytrityl)guanosine which may be reduced to provide 2-N-isobutyryl-6-O-diphenylcarbamoyl-2'-O- (2-hydroxyethyl) -5'-O-(4,4?-dimethoxytrityl)guanosine.

repeated four times for RNA and twice for 2'-O-methyl.  The fully protected oligonucleotide is cleaved from the support and the phosphate group is deprotected in 3:1 airrr.onia/ethanol at room temperature overnight then lycphilized to dryness.  Treatment in methanolic ammonia for 24 hrs at room temperature is then dene to deprotect all bases and sample was again lyophilized to dryness.  The pellet is resuspended in 1M TBAF in THF for 24 hrs at room temperature to deprotect the 2' positions.  The reaction is then quenched with 1M TEAA and -the sample is then reduced to 1/2 volume by rotovac before being desalted on a G2 5 size exclusion column.  The oligo recovered is then analyzed spectrophotometrically for yield and for purity by capillary electrcphoresis and by mass spectrometry.<br>

ammonium hydroxide at 55Â°C for 18 hours, the oligonucleotides or oligonucleosides are purified by precipitation twice out of 0.5 M NaCl with 2.5 volumes ethanol.  Synthesized oligonucleotides were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on denaturing gels and judged to be at least 85% full length material.  The relative amounts of phosphorothioate and phosphodiester linkages obtained in synthesis were periodically checked by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and for some studies oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC, as described by Chiang et al., J. Bid. Chem. 1991, 266, 18162-18171.  Results obtained with HPLC-purified material were similar to those obtained with non-HPLC purified material.<br><br>

Oligonucleotide Synthesis - 96 Well Plate Format<br>
Oligonucleotides were synthesized via solid phase P(III) phosphoramidite chemistry on an automated synthesizer capable of assembling 96 sequences simultaneously in a standard 96 well format. Phosphodiester internucleotide linkages were afforded by oxidation with aqueous iodine.  Phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages were generated by sulfurization utilizing 3,H-1,2 benzodithiole-3-one 1,1 dioxide (Beaucage Reagent) in anhydrous acetonitrile.  Standard base-protected beta-cyanoethyldiisopropyl phosphoramid.ites were purchased from commercial vendors (e.g. PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, or Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). Non-standard nucleosides are synthesized as per known literature or patented methods.  They are utilized as base protected beta-cyanoethyldiisopropyl phosphoramidites.<br>
Oligonucleotides were cleaved from support and deprotected with concentrated NH4OH at elevated temperature (55-60Â°C) for 12-16 hours and the released product then dried in vacuo.  The dried product was then re-suspended in sterile water to afford a master plate from which all analytical and test plate samples are then diluted utilizing robotic pipettors.<br>
Example 8<br>
Oligonucleotide Analysis - 96 Well Plate Format<br>
The concentration of oligonucleotide in each well was assessed by dilution of samples and UV absorption spectroscopy.  The full-length integrity of the individual products was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (CE) in<br>
either the 96 well format (Beckman P/ACEâ¢ MDQ) or, for<br><br>
individually prepared samples, on a commercial CE apparatus (e.g., Beckman P/ACEâ¢ 5000, ABI 270).  Base and backbone composition was confirmed by mass analysis of the compounds utilizing eiectrospray-mass spectroscopy.  All assay test plates were diluted from the master plate using single and muiti-channel robotic pipe-tors.  Plates were judged to be acceptable if at least 85% of the compounds, on the plate were at least 85% full length.<br>

The concentration of positive control oligonucleotide that results in 8C% inhibition of c-Ha-ras-(for ISIS 13920) or c-raf (for ISIS 15770) mRMA is then utilized as the screening concentration for new oligonucleotides in subsequent experiments for that cell line.  If 80% inhibition is not achieved, the lowest concentration of positive control oligonucleotide that results in 60% inhibition of H-ras or c-raf mRNA is then utilized as the oligonucleotide screening concentration in subsequent experiments for that cell line.  If 60% inhibition is not achieved, that particular cell line is deemed as unsuitable for oligonucleotide transfection experiments-  The concentrations of antisense oligonucleotides used herein are from 5 nil to 300 nM.<br>

Irvine CA) .  Plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, washed 3 times with 200 |HL of wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7,6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 M NaCl) .  After the final wash, the plate was blotted on paper towels to remove excess wash buffer and then air-dried for 5 minutes. 60 Î¼L of elutior. buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6), preheated to 70Â°C<br>
was added to each well, the plate was incubated on a 90Â°C hot plate for 5 minutes, and the eluate was then transferred to a fresh 96-well plate.<br>
Cells grown on 100 mm or other standard plates may be treated similarly, using appropriate volumes of all solutions.<br>

Total RNA Isolation<br>
Total RNA was isolated using an RNEASY 96â¢ kit and buffers purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia CA) following the manufacturer's recommended procedures.  Briefly, for cells grown on 96-well plates, growth medium was removed<br>
from the cells and each well was washed with 200 Î¼L cold PBS. 100 jiL Buffer RLT was added to each well and the plate<br>
vigorously agitated for 20 seconds.  100 |IL of 70% ethanol was then added to each well and the contents mixed by pipetting three times up and down.  The samples were then<br>
transferred to the RNEASY-96â¢ well plate attached to a<br>
QIAVACâ¢ manifold fitted with a waste collection tray and attached to a vacuum source.  Vacuum was applied for 15 seconds.  1 mL of Buffer RWl was added to each well of the<br>
RNEASY 96â¢ plate and the vacuum again applied for 15 seconds.  1 mL of Buffer RPE was then added to each well of the RNEASY 96â¢ plate and the vacuum applied for a period of<br><br>
15 seconds.  The Buffer RPE wash was then repeated and the vacuum was applied for an additional 10 minutes.  The plate was then removed from the QIAVACâ¢ manifold and blotted dry on paper towels.  The plate was then re-attached to the QIAVACâ¢ manifold fitted with a collection tube rack containing 1.2 mL collection tubes.  RNA was then eluted by pipetting 60 ÎL water into each well, incubating 1 minute, and then applying the vacuum for 3 0 seconds.  The elution<br>
step was repeated with an additional 60 JIL water.<br>
The repetitive pipetting and elution steps may be automated using a QIAGEN Bio-Robot 9604 (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia CA).  Essentially, after lysing of the cells on the culture plate, the plate is transferred to the robot deck where the pipetting, DNase treatment and elution steps are carried out.<br>

Real-time Quantitative PCR Analysis of apolipoprotein B<br>
mRNA Levels<br>
Quantitation of apolipoprotein B mRNA levels was determined by real-time quantitative PCR using the ABI<br>
PRISMâ¢ 7700  Sequence Detection System   (PE-Applied Biosystems,   Foster City,   CA)   according to manufacturer's instructions.     This  is a closed-tube,   non-gel-based, fluorescence detection system which allows high-throughput quantitation of polymerase chain reaction   (PCR)   products  in real-time.     As  opposed to standard PCR,   in which amplification products  are quantitated after the PCR is completed,   products  in real-time quantitative PCR are quantitated as  they accumulate.    This is accomplished by including in the PCR reaction an oligonucleotide probe  that anneals specifically between the forward and reverse PCR<br><br>
primers, and contains two fluorescent dyes.  A reporter dye (e.g., JOE, FAM, or VIC, obtained from either Operon Technologies Inc., Alameda, CA or PE-Applied Biosysterns, Fester City, CA) is attached to the 5' end of the probe and a quencher dye (e.g., TAMRA, obtained from either Operon Technologies Inc., Aiameda, CA or PE-Applied 3iosysterns, Fester City, CA) is attached to the 3' end of the probe. When the probe and dyes are intact, reporter dye emission is quenched by the proximity of the 3f quencher dye. During amplification, annealing of the probe to the target sequence creates a substrate that can be cleaved by the 5'-exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase.  During the extension phase of the PCR amplification cycle, cleavage of the probe by Taq polymerase releases the reporter dye from the remainder of the probe (and hence from the quencher moiety) and a sequence-specific fluorescent signal is generated.  With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, and the fluorescence intensity is monitored at regular intervals by<br>
laser optics built into the ABI PRISMâ¢ 7700 Sequence Detection System.  In each assay, a series of parallel reactions containing serial dilutions of mRNA from untreated control samples generates a standard curve that is used to quantitate the percent inhibition after antisense oligonucleotide treatment of test samples.<br>
Prior to quantitative PCR analysis, primer-probe sets specific to the target gene being measured are evaluated for their ability to be "multiplexed" with a GAPDH amplification reaction.  In multiplexing, both the target gene and the internal standard gene GAPDH are amplified concurrently in a single sample.  In this analysis", mRNA isolated from untreated cells is serially diluted.  Each<br><br>
dilution is amplified in -he presence of primer-probe sets specific for GAPDH only, -arget gene only ("single-plexing"), or both (multiplexing).  Following PCR amplification, standard curves of GAPDH and target mRNA signal as a function of dilution are generated from both the singie-plexed and multiplexed samples.  If both the slope and correlation coefficient of the GAPDH and target signals generated from the multiplexed samples fall within 1C% of their corresponding values generated from the singie-plexed samples, the primer-probe set specific for that target is deemed multiplexable.  Other methods of PCR are also known in the arc,<br>
PCR reagents were obtained from PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA.  RT-PCR reactions were carried out by<br>
adding 25 Î¼L PCR cocktail (lx TAQMMfâ¢ buffer A, 5.5 mM<br>
MgCl2, 300 Î¼M each of dAT?, dCTP and dGTP, 600 Î¼m of dUTP, 100 nM each of forward primer, reverse primer, and probe,<br>
20 Units RNAse inhibitor,; 1.25 Units AMPLITAQ GOLDâ¢, and 12.5 Units MuLV reverse transcriptase) to 96 well plates<br>
containing 25 Î¼L total RNA solution.  The RT reaction was carried out by incubation for 3 0 minutes at 48Â°C.  Following a 10 minute incubation at 95Â°C to activate the AMPLITAQ GOLDâ¢, 40 cycles of a two-step PCR protocol were carried<br>
out: 95Â°C for 15 seconds (denaturation) followed by 60Â°C for 1.5 minutes (annealing/extension).<br>
Gene target quantities obtained by real time RT-PCR are normalized using either the expression level of GAPDH, a gene whose expression is constant, or by quantifying total RNA using RiboGreenâ¢ (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR) . GAPDH expression is quantified by real time RT-PCR, by being run simultaneously with the target, multiplexing, or<br><br>
separately. Total RNA is quantified using RiboGreenâ¢ RNA quantification reagent from Molecular Probes.  Methods of R-MA quantification by RiboGreenâ¢ are taught in Jones, L.J., et al, Analytical Biochemistry, 1998, 255, 3 68-374.<br>
In this assay, 175 ÎL of RiboGreenâ¢ working reagent RiboGreenâ¢ reagent diluted 1:2865 in lOmM Tris-HCl, 1 mM ZDTA, pH 7.5) is pipetted into a 96-well plate containing 2 3uL purified, cellular RNA.  The plate is read in a CvtoFluor 4000 (PE Applied Biosystems) with excitation at 430nm and emission at 520nm.<br>

animals.<br>
i C57BL/6 mice, a strain reported to be susceptible to<br>
hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerotic plaque formation<br>
i were used in the following studies to evaluate antisense<br>
oligonucleotides as potential lipid lowering compounds in lean versus high fat fed mice.<br>
Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into two matched groups; (1) wild-type control animals (lean animals) and (2) animals receiving a high fat diet (60% kcal fat) . Control animals received saline treatment and were maintained on a normal rodent diet. After overnight fasting, mice from each group were dosed intraperitoneally every three days with saline or 50 mg/kg ISIS 147764 (SEQ ID No: 109) for six weeks.  At study termination and forty eight hours after the final injections, animals were sacrificed and evaluated for target mRNA levels in liver, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, liver enzyme levels and serum glucose levels.<br><br>
The results of the comparative studies are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
It is evident from these data that treatment with ISIS 147764 lowered cholesterol as well as LDL and HDL lipoproteins and serum glucose in both lean and high fat mice and that the effects; demonstrated are, in fact, due to the inhibition of apolipoprotein B expression as supported by the decrease in mRNA levels.  No significant changes in liver enzyme levels were observed, indicating that the antisense oligonucleotide was not toxic to either treatment group.<br>

Control animals received saline treatment (50 mg/kg) . Mice were dosed intraperitoneally every three days (twice a week), after fasting overnight, with 5, 25, 50 mg/kg ISIS 147764 (SEQ ID No: 109) or saline (50 mg/kg) for six weeks. At study termination, animals were sacrificed 48 hours after the final injections and evaluated for levels of target mRNA levels in liver. ISIS 147764 showed a dose-response effect, reducing mRNA levels by 15, 75 and 88% at doses cf 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg, respectively.<br>
Liver protein samples collected at the end of the treatment period were subjected to immunoblot analysis<br><br>
using an antibody directed to mouse apolipoprotein B protein (Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, CA).  These data demonstrate that treatment with ISIS 147764 decreases apolipoprotein B protein expression in liver in a dose-dependent manner, in addition to reducing mRNA levels.<br>

Mice were dosed intraperitoneally every three days (twice a week), -after fasting overnight, with 5, 25, 50 mg/kg ISIS 147764 (SEQ ID No: 109) or saline (50 rag/kg) for six weeks.<br>
At study termination, animals were sacrificed 48 hours after the final injections and evaluated for serum glucose levels. ISIS 147764 showed a dose-response effect, reducing serum glucose levels to 225, 190 and 180 mg/dL at doses of 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg, respectively compared to the saline control of 300 mg/dL. Mice treated with atorvastatin at a daily oral dose of 20 mg/kg had serum glucose levels of 215 mg/dL.  These data demonstrate that ISIS 147764 is capable of reducing serum glucose levels in high fat fed mice.<br>

At study termination, animals were sacrificed 43 hours after the final injections and body, spleen, liver and fat pad weights were measured.  These data are shown in Table 8 . Values are expressed as percent change in body weight or ogan weight compared to the saline-treated control animals. Data from mice treated with atorvastatin at a daily dose of 2 0 ing/kg are also shown in the table. Negative values indicated a decrease in weight.<br><br>
These data show a decrease in fat over the dosage range of ISIS 147764 counterbalanced by an increase in both spleen and liver weight with increased dose to give an overall decrease in total body weigh-.<br><br>

Effects of antisense inhibition of apolipoprotein B (ISIS 147764) in B6,129P-ApoetmlUnc knockout mice: Lean animals vs. High Fat Fed animals.<br>
B6.129P-ApoEtmlUnc knockout mice (herein referred to as ApoE knockout mice) obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), are hcmozygous for the ApoetmlUnc mutation and show a marked increase in total plasma cholesterol levels that are unaffected by age or sex. These animals present with fatty streaks in the proximal aorta at 3 months of age. These lesions increase with age and progress to lesions with less lipid but more elongated cells, typical of a more advanced stage of pre-atherosclerotic lesion.<br>
The mutation in these mice resides in the<br>
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene.  The primary role of the ApoE protein is to transport cholesterol and triglycerides throughout the body. It stabilizes lipoprotein structure, binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor.. (LDLR) and related proteins, and is present in a subclass of HDLs, providing them the ability to bind to LDLR. ApoE is expressed most abundantly in the liver and brain.  Female B6.129P-ApoetmlUnc knockout mice (ApoE knockout mice) were used in the following studies to evaluate antisense oligonucleotides as potential lipid lowering compounds.<br>
Female ApoE knockout mice ranged in age from 5 to 7 weeks and were placed on a normal diet for 2 weeks before study initiation.  ApoE knockout mice were then fed ad libitum a 60% fat diet, with 0.15% added cholesterol to induce dyslipidemia and obesity. Control animals were maintained on a high-fat diet with no added cholesterol. After overnight fasting, mice from each group were dosed<br><br>
intraperitoneally every three days with saline, 50 mg/kg of a control antisense oligonucleotide (ISIS 29837; TCGATCTCCTTTTATGCCCG; SEQ ID NO. 124) or 5, 25 or 50 mg/kg ISIS 147764 (SEQ ID No: 109) for six weeks.<br>
The control oligonucleotide is a chiraeric oligonucleotides ("gapmers") 20 nucleotides in length, composed of a central "gap" region consisting of ten 21-decxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (51 and 3' directions) by five-nucleotide "wings".  The wings are composed of 2'-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE)nucleotides.  The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P=S) throughout the oligonucleotide.  All cytidine residues are 5-methylcytidines .<br>
At study termination and forty eight hours after the final injections, animals were sacrificed and evaluated for target mRNA levels in liver by RT-PCR methods verified by Northern Blot analysis, glucose levels, cholesterol and lipid levels by HPLC separation methods and triglyceride and liver enzyme levels (perfomed by LabCorp Preclinical Services; San Diego, CA) . Data from ApoE knockout mice treated with atorvastatin at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg are also shown in the table for comparison.<br>
The results of the comparative studies are shown in Table 9.  Data are normalized to saline controls.<br>
Table 9<br>
Effects of ISIS 147764 treatment on apolipoprotein B mRNA, cholesterol/ glucose, lipid, triglyceride and liver enzyme<br><br><br><br>
It is evident from these data that treatment with ISIS 147764 lowered glucose and cholesterol as well as all lipoproteins investigated (HDL, LDL and VLDL) in ApoE lockout mice. Further, these decreases correlated with a decrease in both protein aqd RNA levels of apolipoprotein 3, demonstrating an antisense mechanism of action. No significant changes in liver enzyme levels were observed, indicating that the antisense oligonucleotide was not toxic to either treatment group.<br>

Example 39 RNA Synthesis<br>
In general, RNA synthesis chemistry is based on the selective incorporation of various protecting groups at strategic intermediary reactions. Although one of ordinary skill in the art will understand the use of protecting groups in organic synthesis, a useful class of protecting groups includes silyl ethers.  In particular bulky silyl ethers are used to protect the 5'-hydroxyl in combination with an acid-labile orthoester protecting group on the 2'-hydroxyl. This set of protecting groups is then used with standard solid-phase synthesis technology.  It is important to lastly remove the acid labile orthoester protecting group after all other synthetic steps.  Moreover, the early use of the silyl protecting groups during synthesis ensures<br><br>
facile removal when desired, without undesired deprotection of 2' hydroxyl.<br>
Following this procedure for the sequential protection of the 5'-hydroxyl in combination with protection of the 2'-hydroxyl by protecting groups that are differentially removed and are differentially chemically labile, RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized.<br>
RNA oligonucleotides are synthesized in a stepwise fashion. Each nucleotide is added sequentially (3'- to 5'-direction) to a solid support-bound oligonucleotide. The first nucleoside at the 3'-end of the chain is covalently attached to a solid support. The nucleotide precursor, a ribonucleoside phosphoramidite, and activator are added, coupling the second base onto the 5'-end of the first nucleoside. The support is washed and any unreacted 5'-hydroxyl groups are capped with acetic anhydride to yield-5'-acetyl moieties. The linkage is then oxidized to the more stable and ultimately desired P(V) linkage.  At the end of the nucleotide addition cycle, the 5'-silyl group is cleaved with fluoride.  The cycle is repeated for each subsequent nucleotide.<br>
Following synthesis, the methyl protecting groups on the phosphates are cleaved in 3 0 minutes utilizing 1M disodium-2-carbamoyl-2-cyanoethylene-l, 1-dithiolate trihydrate (S2Na2) in DMF. The deprotection solution is washed from the solid support-bound oligonucleotide using water. The support is then treated with 40% methylamine in water for 10 minutes at 55 Â°C. This releases the RNA oligonucleotides into solution, deprotects the exocyclic amines, and modifies the 2'- groups. The oligonucleotides can be analyzed by anion exchange HPLC at this stage.<br><br>
The 2'-orthoester groups are the last protecting groups to be removed. The ethylene glycol monoacetate orthoester protecting group developed by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO), is one example of a useful crthoester protecting group which, has the following important properties. It is stable to the conditions of r.ucleoside phosphoramidite synthesis and oligonucleotide synthesis. However, af~er oligonucieotide synthesis the oligonucleotide is treated with methylamine which not only cleaves the oligonucleotide from the solid support but also removes the acetyl groups from the orthoesters. The resulting 2-ethyl-hydroxyl substituents on the orthoester are less electron withdrawing than the acetylated precursor. As a result, the modified orthoester becomes more labile to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.  Specifically, the rate of cleavage is approximately 10 times faster after the acetyl groups are removed. Therefore, this orthoester possesses sufficient stability in order to be compatible with oligonucleotide synthesis and yet, when subsequently modified, permits deprotection to be carried out under relatively mild aqueous conditions compatible with the final RNA oligonucleotide product.<br>

RNA ant is ens e ccmpounds (RNA oligonucleotides) of the present invention car. be synthesized by the methods herein cr purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc (Lafayette, CO) . Once synthesized, complementary RNA ant is ens e compounds can then be stably annealed by methods known in the art to form double stranded (duplexed) antisense compounds.  For example, duplexes can be formed by combining 3 0 Î¼l of each cf the complementary strands of SNA oligonucleotides (50 Î¼M RNA oligonucleotide solution) and 15 Î¼l of 5X annealing buffer (100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 2 mM magnesium acetate) followed by heating for 1 minute at 90Â°C, then 1 hour at 37Â°C- The resulting duplexed antisense compounds can be used in kits, assays, screens, or other methods to investigate the role of a target nucleic acid.	â Example 40<br>
Design and screening of duplexed antisense compounds<br>
targeting apolipoprotein B<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a series of nucleic acid duplexes comprising the antisense compounds of the present invention and their complements are designed to target apolipoprotein B. The nucleobase sequence of the antisense strand of the duplex comprises at least a portion of an oligonucleotide described herein.  The ends of the strands may be modified by the addition of one or more natural or modified nucleobases to form an overhang. The sense strand of the dsRNA is then designed and synthesized as the complement of the antisense strand and may also contain modifications or additions to either terminus. For<br><br>
example, in one embodiment, both strands of the dsRNA duplex would be complementary over the central nucleobases, each having overhangs at one or both termini.  The antisense and sense strands of the duplex comprise from about 17 to 25 nucleotides, or from about 19 to 23 nucleotides.  Alternatively, the antisense and sense strands comprise 20, 21 or 22 nucleotides.<br>
For example, a duplex comprising an antisense strand having the sequence CGAGAGGCGGACGGGACCG and having a two-nucleobase overhang of deoxythymidine (dT) would have the following structure:<br><br>
In another embodiment, a duplex comprising an antisense strand having the same sequence CGAGAGGCGGACGGGACCG may be prepared with blunt ends (no single stranded overhang) as shown:<br><br>
RNA strands of the duplex can be synthesized by methods disclosed herein or purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc., (Lafayette, CO). Once synthesized, the complementary strands are stably annealed.  The single strands are aliquoted and diluted to a concentration of 50 uM.  Once diluted, 3 0 uL of each strand is combined with 15uL of a 5X solution of annealing buffer.  The final concentration of said buffer is 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, and 2mM magnesium acetate.  The final volume is 75 uL.  This solution is incubated for 1 minute at 90Â°C and then centrifuged for 15 seconds.  The tube is allowed to sit for 1 hour at 37Â°C at which time the<br><br>
dsRNA duplexes are used in experimentation.  The final concentration of the dsRNA duplex is 2 0 uM.  This solution can be stored frozen (-20Â°C) and freeze-thawed up to 5 times.<br>
Once prepared, the duplexed antisense compounds are evaluated for their ability to modulate apolipoprotein B expression.<br>
When cells reached 80% confluency, they are treated with duplexed antisense compounds of the invention.  For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells are washed once with 200 Î¼L OPTI-MEM-1 reduced-serum medium (Gibco BRL) and then treated with 13 0 Î¼l of OPTI-MEM-1 containing 12 Î¼g/mL LIPOFECTIN (Gibco BRL) and the desired duplex antisense compound at a final concentration of 200 nM.  After 5 hours of treatment, the medium is replaced with fresh medium. Cells are harvested 16 hours after treatment, at which time RNA is isolated and target reduction measured by RT-PCR.<br>
Example 41<br>
Design of phenotypic assays and in vivo studies for the use<br>
of apolipoprotein B inhibitors<br>
Phenotypic assays<br>
Once apolipoprotein B inhibitors have been identified by the methods disclosed herein, the compounds are further investigated in one or more phenotypic assays, each having measurable endpoints predictive of efficacy in the treatment of a particular disease state or condition. Phenotypic assays, kits and reagents for their use are well known to those skilled in the art and are herein used to investigate the role and/or association of apolipoprotein B in health and disease. Representative phenotypic assays, which can be purchased from any one of several commercial<br><br>
vendors, include those for determining cell viability, cytotoxicity, proliferation or cell survival (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; PerkinSlmer, Boston, MA) , protein-based assays including enzymatic assays (Panvera, LLC, Madison, NI; BD 3ioscisnces, Franklin Lakes, NJ; Oncogene Research Produces, San Diego, CA) , cell regulation, signal cransduction, inflammation, oxidative processes and apoptosis (Assay Designs Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), triglyceride accumulation (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) , angiogenesis assays, tube formation assays, cytokine and hormone assays and metabolic assays (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).<br>
In one non-limiting example, cells determined to be appropriate for a particular phenocypic assay (i.e., MCF-7 cells selected for breast cancer studies; adipocytes for obesity studies) are treated with apolipoprotein B inhibitors identified from the in vitro studies as well as control compounds at optimal concentrations which are determined by the methods described above.  At the end of the treatment period, treated and untreated cells are analyzed by one or more methods specific for the assay to determine phenotypic outcomes and endpoints.<br>
Phenotypic endpoints include changes in cell morphology over time or treatment dose as well as changes in levels of cellular components such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, hormones, saccharides or metals. Measurements of cellular status which include pH, stage of the cell cycle, intake or excretion of biological indicators by the cell, are also endpoints of interest.<br>
Analysis of the genotype of the cell (measurement of the expression of one or more of the genes of the cell) after treatment is also used as an indicator of the<br><br>
efficacy or potency of the apolipoprotein B inhibitors. Hallmark genes, or those genes suspected to be associated with a specific disease state, condition, or phenotype, are measured in both treated and untreated cells.<br>
In vivo studies<br>
The individual subjects of the in vivo studies described herein are warm-blooded vertebrate animals, which includes humans.<br>
The clinical trial is subjected to rigorous controls to ensure that individuals are not unnecessarily put at risk and that they are fully informed about their role in the study.<br>
To account for the psychological, effects of receiving treatments, volunteers are randomly given placebo or apolipoprotein B inhibitor.  Furthermore, to prevent the doctors from being biased; in treatments, they are not informed as to whether the medication they are administering is a apolipoprotein B inhibitor or a placebo. Using this randomization approach, each volunteer has the same chance of being given either the new treatment or the placebo.<br>
Volunteers receive either the apolipoprotein B inhibitor or placebo for eight week period with biological parameters associated with the indicated disease state or condition being measured at the beginning (baseline measurements before any treatment) , end (after the final treatment), and at regular intervals during the study period.  Such measurements include the levels of nucleic acid molecules encoding apolipoprotein B or apolipoprotein B protein levels in body fluids, tissues or organs compared to pre-treatment levels.  Other measurements include, but<br><br>
or<br>
are not limited to, indices of the disease, state condition being treated, body weight, blood pressure, serum ticers of pharmacologic indicators of disease or toxicity as well as ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) measurements.<br>
Information recorded for each patient includes age (years), gender, height (cm), family history of disease state or condition (yes/no), motivation racing (some/moderate/great) and number ar.d type of previous treatment regimens for the indicated disease or condition.<br>
Volunteers taking part in this study are healthy adults (age 18 to 65 years) and roughly ar. equal number of males and females participate in the study. Volunteers with certain characteristics are equally distributed for placebo and apolipoprotein B inhibitor treatment.  In general, the volunteers treated with placebo have little or no response to treatment, whereas the volunteers treated with the apolipoprotein B inhibitor show positive trends in their disease state or condition index at the conclusion of the study.<br>

Antisense inhibition of rabbit apolipoprotein B expression by chimeric phosphorothioate oligonucleotides having 2'-MOE wings and a deoxy gap<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a series of oligonucleotides was designed to target different regions of rabbit apolipoprotein B, using published sequences (GenBank accession nuinber X0743Q.1, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 808, GenBank accession number M17780.1, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: "3 09, and a sequence was derived using previously described primers (Tanaka, Journ.<br><br>
3iol. Chem., 1993,268, 12713-12718) representing an mRNA of the rabbit apolipoprotein B, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 810).  The oligonucleotides are shown in Table 21. "Target site" indicates the first (5'-most) nucleotide number on the particular target sequence to which the oligonucleotide binds.  All compounds in Table 21 are chimeric oligonucleotides ("gapmers") 2 0 nucleotides in length/ composed of a central "gap" region consisting of ten 2'-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (5' and 3' directions) by five-nucleotide "wings".  The wings are composed of 2 -methcxyethyl (2'-MCE)nucleotides .  The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P=S) throughout the oligonucleotide.  All cytidine residues are 5-methylcytidines.  The compounds were analysed for their effect on rabbit apolipoprotein B mRNA levels in primary rabbit hepatocytes by quantitative realtime PCR as described in other examples herein.  Primary rabbit hepatocytes were treated with 150 nM of the compounds in Table 21.  For rabbit apolipoprotein B the PCR primers were:<br>
forward primer; AAGCACCCCCAATGTCACC (SEQ ID NO: 811) reverse primer: GGGATGGCAGAGCCAATGTA (SEQ ID NO: 812) and the PCR probe was: FAM- TCCTGGATTCAAGCTTCTATGTGCCTTCA -TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 813) where FAM (PE-Applied Biosysterns, Foster City, CA) is the fluorescent reporter dye) and TAMRA (PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) is the quencher dye.  Data are averages from two experiments.  If present, "N.D." indicates "no data".<br>

Effects of antisense inhibition of apolipoprotein B in<br>
LDLr-/- mice - Dose Response<br>
LDL receptor-deficient mice (LDLr(-/-)mice), a strain that cannot edit the apolipoprotein B mRNA and therefore synthesize exclusively apolipoprotein B-100, have markedly elevated LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B-100 levels and develop extensive atherosclerosis.<br><br>
LDLr(-/-) mice, purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY) were used to evaluate antisense oligonucleotides for their potential to lower apolipoprotein B mRNA or protein levels, as well as phenotypic endpoints associated with apolipoprotein B.  LDLr(-/-) mice were separated into groups of males and females.  LDLr{-/-) mice were dosed intraperitoneally twice a week for six weeks with either 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg of ISIS 147764 (SEQ ID NO: 109) or ISIS 270906 (SSQ ID NO: 856) which is a 4 base mismatch of ISIS 147764, or with saline, or 20 mg/kg of Atorvastatin.  At study termination animals were sacrificed and evaluated for several phenotypic markers.<br>
ISIS 147764 was able to lower cholesterol, triglycerides, and mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner in both male and female mice while the 4-base mismatch ISIS 270906 was not able to do this.  The results of the study are summarized in Table 23.<br>

Effects of antisense inhibition of apolipoprotein B in Cynoznolgus monkeys<br>
Cynomolgus monkeys fed an atherogenic diet develop atherosclerosis with many similarities to atherosclerosis of human beings. Female Cynomclgus macaques share several similarities in lipoproteins and the cardiovascular system with humans. In addition to these characteristics, there are similarities in reproductive biology. The Cynomolgus. female has a 28-day menstrual cycle like that of women. Plasma hormone concentrations have been measured throughout the Cynomolgus menstrual cycle, "and the duration of the follicular and luteal phases, as well as plasma estradiol and progesterone concentrations across the cycle, are also remarkably similar to those in women.<br>
Cynomolgus monkeys (male or female) can be used to evaluate antisense oligonucleotides for their potential to lower apolipoprotein B mRNA or protein levels, as well as phenotypic endpoints associated with apolipoprotein 3 including, but not limited to cardiovascular indicators, atherosclerosis, lipid diseases, obesity, and plaque formation.  One study could include normal and induced hypercholesterolemic monkeys fed diets that are normal or high in lipid and cholesterol.  Cynomolgus monkeys can be dosed in a variety of regimens, one being subcutaneously with 10-20 mg/kg of the oligomeric compound for 1-2 months. Parameters that may observed during the test period could include: total plasma cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, arterial wall cholesterol , content, and coronary intimal thickening.<br><br>
Example 46<br>
Sequencing of Cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis)<br>
apolipoprotein B preferred target segment<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a portion of the cynomolgus monkey apolipoprotein 3 mRNA not available in the art, was amplified.  Positions 2920 to 3420 of the human apolipoprotein 3 mRNA sequence (GenBank accession number NMJ3003-84.1, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 3) contain the preferred target segmenr to which ISIS 3 01012 hybridizes and the corresponding segment of cynomolgus monkey apolipoprotein B mRNA was amplified and sequenced. The site to which ISIS 3 01012 hybridizes in the human apolipoprotein B was amplified by placing primers at 5' position 2920 and 3' position 3420.  The cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes were purchased from In Vitro Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD) .  The 500 bp fragments were produced using human and cynomolgus monkey 1Â° hepatpcyte cDNA and were produced by reverse transcription of purified total RNA followed by 40 rounds of PCR amplification.  Following gel purification of the human and cynomolgus amplicons, the forward and reverse sequencing reactions of each product were performed by Retrogen (Invitrogen kit was used to create the single-stranded cDNA and provided reagents for Amplitaq PCR reaction).  This cynomolgus monkey sequence is incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 855 and is 96% identical to positions 2920 to 3420 of the human apolipoprotein B mRNA.<br>

Effects of antisense inhibition of human apolipoprotein B gene (ISIS 281625 and 301012) in C57BL/6NTac-TgN(APOBl00) transgenic mice<br><br>
C57BL/6NTac-TgN(APOBl00) transgenic mice have the human apolipoprotein B gene "knocked-in".  These mice express high levels of human apolipoprotein BiOQ resulting in mice with elevated serum levels of LDL cholesterol. These mice are useful in identifying and evaluating compounds to reduce elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and the risk of atherosclerosis.  When fed a high fat cholesterol diet, these mice develop significant foam cell accumulation underlying the endothelium and within the media, and have significantly more complex atherosclerotic lesions than control animals.<br>
C57BL/6NTac-TgN(APOB100) mice were divided into two groups - one group receiving oligonucleotide treatment and control animals receiving saline treatment. After overnight fasting, mice were dosed intraperitoneally twice a week with saline or 25 mg/kg ISIS 281625 (SEQ ID No: -224) or ISIS 301012 (SEQ ID No: 247) for eight weeks.  At study termination and forty eight hours after the final injections, animals were sacrificed and evaluated for target mRNA levels in liver, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and liver enzyme levels.  In addition, the endogenous mouse apolipoprotein B levels in liver were measured to evaluate any effects of these antisense oligonucletides targeted to the human apolipoprotein B.<br>
Upon treatment with either ISIS 281625 or ISIS 301012, the AST and ALT levels were increased, yet did not exceed normal levels (-3 00 IU/L).  Cholesterol levels were slightly increased relative to saline treatment, while triglyceride levels were slightly decreased.  Treatment with either of these oligonucleotides targeted to the human apolipoprotein B which is expressed in these mice markedly decreased the mRNA levels of the human apolipoprotein,<br><br>
while the levels of the endogenous mouse apolipoprotein 3 were unaffected, indicating that these oligonucleotides exhibit specificity for the human apolipoprotein B.  The resulcs of the comparative studies are shown in Table 24.<br><br>
Following 2 and 4 weeks of ISIS 301012 treatment, LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly reduced to 22 mg/dL and 17 mg/dL, respectively.<br>
Apolipoprotein B protein levels in liver were also evaluated at the end of the 8 week treatment period.  Liver protein was isolated and subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for human or mouse apolipoprotein B protein (US Biologicals, Swampscott, MA and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, respectively). Immunoblot analysis of liver protein samples reveals a reduction in the expression of both forms of human apolipopro.tein B , apolipoprotein B-10G and apolipoprotein<br><br>
B-48.  House apolipoprotein B levels in liver were not significantly changed, as judged by immunobiot analysis.<br>
Serum samples were also collected at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks and were evaluated for human apclipoprotein B expression by using a human apolipoprotein B specific ELISA kit (ALerCHEK Inc., Portland, ME).  Quantitation of serum human apolipoprotein B protein by ELISA revealed that treatment with ISIS 281625 reduced serum human apolipoprotein B protein by 31, 26, 11 and 2 6% at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks, respectively, relative to saline-treated animals.  Treatment with ISIS 301012 reduced serum human apolipoprotein B protein by 70, 87, SI and 41% at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks, respectively, relative to saline-treated control animals.  Serum from transgenic mice was also subjected to immunobiot analysis using both human and mouse specific apolipoprotein B antibodies (US Biologicals,<br>
Swampscott, MA and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA7 respectively) .  Immunobiot analysis of serum samples taken from animals shows a similar pattern of human apolipoprotein B expression, with a significant reduction in serum apolipoprotein B protein after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment and a slight reduction at 8 weeks.  Mouse apolipoprotein B in serum was not significantly changed, as judged by immunobiot analysis.<br>

Effects of antisense inhibition of apolipoprotein B (ISIS<br>
233172, 233175, 281625, 301012, and 301027) in C57BL/6 mice<br>
C57BL/6 mice, a strain reported to be susceptible to hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerotic plaque formation were used in the following studies to evaluate the toxicity in mice of several antisense oligonucleotides targeted to human or rabbit apolipoprotein B.<br>
C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups - one group receiving oligonucleotide treatment and control animals<br><br>
receiving saline treatment. After overnight fasting, mice were dosed intraperitoneally twice a week with saline or 25 mg/kg of one of several oligonuclGOtides for two weeks. The antisense oligonuclaotides used in the present study-were ISIS 233172 (SEQ ID NO: 835) and ISIS 233175 (SEQ ID NO: 838), both targeted to rabbit apolipoprotein B, and ISIS 281625 (SEQ ID NO: 224), ISIS 301012 (SEQ ID NO: 247), and ISIS 301027 (SEQ ID NO: 262), targeted to human apolipoprotein B.  At study termination and forty eight hours after the final injections, animals were sacrificed and evaluated for liver enzyme levels, body weight, liver weight, and spleen weight.<br>
The levels of liver enzymes in mice were decreased relative to saline treatment for three of the antisense oligonucleotide.  However, the x-abbit oligonucleotide ISIS 233175 and the human oligonucleotide ISIS 301027 both elicited drastically increased levels of these liver enzymes, indicating toxicity.  For all of the oligonucleotides tested, the change in weight of body, liver, and spleen were minor.  The results of the comparative studies are shown in Table 25.<br>

C57BL/5 mice, a strain reported to be susceptible to hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerotic plaque formation were used in the following studies to evaluate the toxicity in mice of several antisense oligonucleotides targeted to human apolipoprotein B.<br>
 Female C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups - one group receiving oligonucleotide treatment and control animals receiving saline treatment. After overnight fasting, mice were dosed intraperitoneally twice a week with saline or 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg of ISIS 281625 (SEQ ID NO: 224), ISIS 301012 (SEQ ID NO: 247), or ISIS 301027 (SEQ ID MO: 262) .  After 2 weeks, a blood sample was taken from the tail of the mice and evaluated for liver enzyme.  After 4 weeks, and study termination, animals were sacrificed and evaluated for liver enzyme levels-<br>
For ISIS 281625 and ISIS 3 01012, AST and ALT levels remained close to those of saline at either dose after 2 weeks.  After 4 weeks, AST and ALT levels showed a moderate increase over saline treated animals for the lower dose, but a large increase at the higher dose.  ISIS 3 01027, administered at either dose, showed a small increase in AST and ALT levels after 2 weeks and a huge increase in AST and ALT levels after 4 weeks.  The results of the studies are summarized in Table 26.<br><br><br>
Example 50<br>
Effects of antisense inhibition of apolipdprotein B (ISIS<br>
147483 and 147764) in ob/ob mice<br>
Leptin is a hormone produced by fat that regulates appetite.  Deficiencies in this hormone in both humans and non-human animals leads to obesity.  ob/ob mice have a mutation in the leptin gene which results in obesity and hyperglycemia.  As such, these mice are a useful model for the investigation of obesity and diabetes and treatments designed to treat these conditions.<br>
Ob/ob mice receiving a high fat, high cholesterol diet (60% kcal fat supplemented with 0.15% cholesterol) were treated with one of several oligonucleotides to evaluate their effect on apolipoprotein B-related phenotypic endpoints in ob/ob mice.  After overnight fasting, mice from each group were dosed intraperitoneally twice a week with 50 mg/kg of ISIS 147483 (SEQ ID NO: 79), or 147764 (SEQ ID NO: 109), or the controls ISIS 116847 (SEQ ID NO: 857), or 141923 (SEQ ID NO: 858), or saline for six weeks. At study termination and forty eight hours after the final injections, animals were sacrificed and evaluated for<br><br>
target mRNA levels in liver, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, liver enzyme levels, serum glucose levels, and PTEN levels.<br>
ISIS 147483 and 147764 were both able to lower apolipoprotein B mRNA levels, as well as glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.  The results of the comparative studies are shown in Table 27.<br><br>
Example 51<br>
Antisense inhibition of apolipoprotein B in high fat fed<br>
mice: time-dependent effects<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the inhibition of apolipoprotein B mRNA in mice was compared to liver oligonucleotide concentration, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol.  Male C57B1/6 mice receiving a high fat diet (60% fat) were evaluated over the course of 6 weeks for the effects of treatment with twice weekly intraperitoneal injections of 50 mg/kg ISIS 147764<br><br>
(SEQ-ID NO: 109) or 50 mg/kg of the control oligonucleotide ISIS 141923 (SEQ ID NO: 858).  Control animals received saline treatment.  Animals were sacrificed after 2 days, 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment.  Each treatment group at each time point consisted of 8 mice.<br>
Target expression in liver was measured by real-time  CR as described by other examples herein and is expressed as percent inhibition relative to saline treated mice. Total, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels were measured by routine clinical analysis using an Olympus Clinical Analyzer (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) and' are presented in mg/dL.  Results from saline-treated animals are shown for comparison.  Intact oligonucleotide in liver tissue was measured by capillary gel electrophoresis and is presented as micrograms of oligonucleotide per gram of tissue. All results are the average of 8 animals and are shown in Table 28.<br>
Table 28<br>
Correlation between liver drug concentration, apolipoprotein B mRNA expression and serum lipids during<br>
ISIS 147764 treatment<br><br><br><br>
These results illustrate that inhibition of apolipoprotein B mRNA by ISIS 147764 occurred within 2 days of treatment, increased with successive treatments and persisted for 6 weeks of treatment.  Quantitation of liver oligonucleotide levels reveals a strong correlation between the extent of target inhibition and liver drug concentration.  Furthermore, at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks of treatment, a inverse correlation between inhibition of target mRNA and cholesterol levels (total, HDL and LDL) is observed, with cholesterol levels lowering as percent inhibition of apolipoprotein 3 mRNA becomes greater.  Serum samples were subjected- to immunoblct analysis using an antibody to detect mouse apolipoprotein B protein (Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, CA).  The expression of protein follows the same pattern as that of the mRNA, with apolipoprotein B protein in serum markedly reduced within 48 hours and lowered throughout the 6 week treatment period.<br>
The oligonucleotide treatments described in this<br>
example were duplicated to investigate the extent to which<br>
effects of ISIS 147764 persist following cessation of<br>
treatment.  Mice were treated as described, and sacrificed<br>
1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks following the cessation of<br>
oligonucleotide treatment.  The same parameters were<br>
analyzed and the results are shown in Table 29.	.<br>
Table 29<br><br>
Correlation between liver drug concentration, apolipoprotein 3 mRNA expression, and serum lipids after<br>
cessation of dosing<br><br>
These data demonstrate that after termination of oligonucleotide treatment/ the effects of ISIS 147764, including apolipoprotein B mRNA inhibition, and cholesterol lowering, persist for up to 8 weeks.  Immunoblot analysis demonstrates that apolipoprotein B protein levels follow a pattern similar that observed for mRNA expression levels.<br>

Effects of antisense inhibition of human apolipoprotein B gene by 301012 in C57BL/6NTac-TgN(APOBl00) transgenic mice: dosing study<br>
C57BL/6NTac-TgN(APOBl00) transgenic mice have the human apolipoprotein B gene "knocked-in".  These mice express high levels of human apolipoprotein B resulting in mice with elevated serum levels of LDL cholesterol. These mice are useful in identifying and evaluating compounds to<br><br>

When fed a high fat cholesterol diet, these mice develop significant foam cell accumulation underlying the endothelium and within the media, and have significantly more complex atherosclerotic plaque lesions than control animals.<br>
A long-term study of inhibition of human<br>
apolipoprotein B by ISIS 301012 in C57BL/SNTac-TgN(APQBl00) mice (Taccnic, Germantown, NY) was conducted for a 3 month period.  Mice were dosed intraperitoneally twice a week with 10 or 25 mg/kg ISIS 301012 (SEQ ID No: 247) for 12 weeks.  Saline-injected animals served as controls.  Each treatment group comprised 4 animals.<br>
After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment, serum samples were collected for the purpose of measuring human apolipoprotein B protein.  Serum protein was quanti_tated using an ELISA kit specific for human apolipoprotein B (ALerCHEK Inc., Portland, ME).  The data are shown in Table 30 and each result represents the average of 4 animals. Data are normalized to saline-treated control animals.<br>
Table 30<br>
Reduction of human apolipoprotein B protein in transgenic mouse serum following ISIS 301012   treatment<br><br>
These data  illustrate that  following 2,   4,   6  or 12 weeks  of  treatment with ISIS 301012,   the  level  of human<br><br>
apolipoprotein B protein in serum from transgenic mice is<br>
lowered by approximately 80%, demonstrating that in<br>
addition to inhibiting mRNA expression, ISIS 301012<br>
effectively inhibits human apolipoprotein B protein<br>
expression in mice carrying the human apolipoprotein B<br>
transgene.  Apolipoprotein B protein in serum was also<br>
assessed by immunoblot analysis using an antibody directed<br>
to human apolipopronein B protein (US Biologicals,<br>
Swampscott, MA) .  This analysis shows that the levels human<br>
apolipoprotein B procein, both the apolipoprotein B-100 and<br>
apolipoprotein B-48 forms, are lowered at 2, 4, 6 and 12<br>
weeks of treatment.  Immunoblot analysis using a mouse<br>
apolipoprotein B specific antibody (Santa Cruz<br>
Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) reveals no significant     i<br>
change in the expression of the mouse protein in serum.        i<br>
At the beginning of the treatment (start) and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of treatment, serum samples were collected and total, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels were measured -by routine clinical analysis using an Olympus Clinical Analyzer (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY), and these data are presented in Table 31.  Results are presented as mg/dL in serum and represent the average of 4 animals. Results from the saline control animals are also shown.<br>
Table 31<br>
Effects of ISIS 301012 on serum lipids in human apolipoprotein B transgenic mice<br><br><br><br>
These data demonstrate that LDL-cholesterol is lowered by treatment with 10 or 25 mg/kg of ISIS 147764 during the first 4 weeks of treatment.<br>
The study was terminated forty eight hours after the final injections in the eighth week of treatment, when animals were sacrificed and evaluated for target mRNA levels in liver, apolipoprotein. B protein levels in liver and serum cholesterol and liver enzyme levels.  In addition, the expression of endogenous mouse apolipoprotein B levels in liver was measured to evaluate any effects of ISIS 3 01012 on mouse apolipoprotein B mRNA expression.<br>
Human and mouse apolipoprotein B mRNA levels in livers of animals treated for 12 weeks were measured by real-time PCR as described herein.  Each result represents the average of data from 4 animals.  The data were normalized to saline controls and are shown in Table 32.<br>
Table 32<br>
Effects of ISIS 3 01012 on human and mouse apolipoprotein B<br>
mRNA levels in transgenid mice<br><br>
These data demonstrate that following 12 weeks of treatment with ISIS 301012, human apolipoprotein B mRNA is reduced by as much as 75% in the livers of transgenic mice,<br><br>
whereas mouse liver apolipoprotein B mRRA was unaffected. Furthermore, ELISA analysis of apolipoprotein B protein in livers of transgenic mice reveals an 80% and 82% reduction in the human protein following 10 and 20 mg/kg ISIS 301012, respectively.  Immuncblot analysis using an antibody directed to human apclipcprocein B also demonstrates a reduction in the expression of human apolipoprotein B, both the apolipoprotein 3-100 and apolipoprotein 3-48 forms, in the livers of transgenic mice.  Immunoblot analysis using an antibody directed to mouse apolipoprotein B protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, inc., Santa Cruz, CA) reveals that expression of the mouse protein in liver does not change significantly.<br>
ALT and AST levels in serum were also measured using the Olympus Clinical Analyzer (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) and showed that following treatment with ISIS 301012, the AST and ALT levels were increased, yet did not exceed normal levels (-300 IU/L), indicating a lack of toxicity due to ISIS 3 01012 treatment.<br>
Example 53<br>
Assessment of in vitro immunostimulatory effects of  ISIS<br>
301012<br>
Immunostimulatory activity is defined by the production of cytokines upon exposure to a proinflammatory agent.  In a further embodiment of the invention, ISIS 301012 was tested for immunostimulatory, or proinflammatory, activity.  These studies were performed by MDS Pharma Services (Saint Germain sur l'Arbresle, France). Whole blood was collected from naive B6C3F1 mice, which had not been knowingly exposed to viral, chemical or radiation treatment.  Cultured blood cells were exposed-to 0.5, 5 or<br><br>
50 Î¼M of ISIS 301012 for a period of 14 to 15 hours. Antisense oligonucleotides known to possess proinflammatory activity served as positive controls.  Each treatment was performed in triplicate.  At the end of the treatment period, supernatants were collected and cytokine analysis was performed using a flow cytometry method with the mouse Inflammation C3A kit (Hector. Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, No ) .  The results revealed that ISTS 3 01012 does not stimulate the release of any of the tested cytokines, which were interleukin-12p7 0 (IL-12p70) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) , interferon-gamma (IFN-gaircna) , interleukin-6 (IL-6), macropnage chemoattrac-ant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) .  Thus, ISIS 301012 does not possess immunostimulatory activity, as determined by the in vitro immunostimulatory assay.<br>
Example 54<br>
Comparative genomic analysis of apolipoprotein B<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a comparative genomic analysis of apolipoprotein B sequences from human, mouse and monkey was performed and illustrated that apolipoprotein B sequences are conserved across species.  The organization of human and mouse apolipoprotein B genes is also highly conserved.  The. human and mouse genes are comprised of 29 and 2 6 exons, respectively.  The mouse mRNA is approximately 81% homologous to the human sequence. The complete sequence and gene structure of the apolipoprotein B gene in non-human primates have not been identified.  However, as illustrated in Example 46, a 500 base pair fragment which contains the ISIS 3 01012 target sequence exhibits approximately 96% identity to the human sequence.<br><br>
The binding site for ISIS 3 01012 lies within the coding region, within exon 22 of the human apolipoprotein B mRNA.  When the ISIS 301012 binding sites from human, mouse and monkey were compared, significant sequence diversity was observed.  Although the overall sequence conservation between human and monkey over a 500 nucleotide region was approximately 9 6%, "he ISIS 3 01012 binding site of the . monkey sequence contains 2 mismatches relative to the human sequence.  Likewise; though the mouse apolipoprotein B mRNA sequence is approximately 81% homologous to human, within the ISIS 301012 binding site, 5 nucleotides are divergent. The sequence comparisons for the ISIS 3 01012 binding site for human, mouse and monkey apolipoprotein B sequences are shown in Table 33.  Mismatched nucleotides relative to the ISIS 3 01012 target sequence are underlined.<br>

The target sequence to which the mouse antisense oligonucleotide ISIS 147764 hybridizes lies within exon 24 of the mouse apolipoprotein B gene.  The sequence comparisons for the ISIS 147764 binding site in mouse and human apolipoprotein B sequences are shown in Table 34. Mismatched nucleotides relative to the ISIS 147764 target sequence are underlined-<br><br>

BLAST analysis of ISIS 301012<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the number of regions in the human genome to which ISIS 301012 will hybridize with perfect complementarity was determined. Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a region of a target nucleic acid was determined using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol.t 1990, 215, 403-410; Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649-656).  This analysis assessed sequence complementarity in genomic or pre-mRNA regions and in coding sequences.<br>
In genomic regions, ISIS 301012 shows perfect sequence complementarity to the apoiipoprotein B gene only.  No target sequences with one mismatch relative to ISIS 301012 were found.  Two mismatches are found between the ISIS 3 01012 target sequence and the heparanase gene, and 3 mismatches are found between the ISIS 301012 target sequence and 28 unique genomic sites.<br>
In RNA sequences, perfect sequence complementarity is found between ISIS 301012 and the apoiipoprotein B mRNA and<br><br>
three expressed sequence tags that bear moderate similarity to a human apolipoprotein B precursor.  A single mismatch is found between ISIS 301012 and an expressed sequence tag similar to the smooth muscle form of myosin light chain.<br>
Example 56<br>
Antisense inhibition of apolipoprotein B in primary human<br>
hepatocytes: dose response studies<br>
In accordance with the present invention, antisense oligonucleotides targeted to human apolipoprotein B were tested in dose response studies in primary human hepatocytes.  Pre-plated primary human hepatocytes were purchased from InVitro Technologies (Baltimore, MD).  Cells were cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA), 100 units/mL and 100 jjg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) .<br>
Human primary hepatocytes were treated with ISIS 301012 (SEQ ID NO: 247) at 10, 50, 150 or 300 nM. Untreated cells and cells treated with the scrambled control oligonucleotide ISIS 113529 (CTCTTACTGTGCTGTGGACA, SEQ ID NO: 859) served as two groups of control cells. ISIS 113529 is a chimeric oligonucleotide ("gapmer") 20 nucleotides in length, composed of a central "gap" region consisting of ten 2'-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (5' and 3' directions) by five-nucleotide "wings".  The wings are composed of 2'-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE)nucleotides.  The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P=S) throughout the oligonucleotide. All cytidines are 5-methylcy-tidines.<br><br>
Oligonucleotid.es were introduced into cells through LIPOFECTIN-mediated transfection as described by other examples herein.  Cells were harvested both 24 and 48 hours after treatment with oligonucieotide, and both RNA and protein were isolated.  Additionally, the culture media from treated cells was collected for ELISA analysis of apolipoprotein B protein secretion.<br>
Apolipoprotein B mRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR of RNA samples as described by other examples herein.  Each result represen-s 6 experiments.  The data are normalized to untreated control cells and are shown in Table 35.<br>

Apolipoprotein B protein secreted from into the cultured cell media was measured in the samples  treated with 50 and 150 nM of oligonucieotide,   using a  target protein specific ELISA kit   (ALerCHEK Inc.,   Portland,   ME).<br><br>
Each result represents 3 experiments.  The data are normalized to untreated control cells and are shown in Table 36.<br>

primary hepatocytes by ISIS 3 01012<br><br>
Protein samples from 50, 150 and 300 nM doses after 24 hours and 150 and 3 00 nM doses after 48 hours were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described by other examples herein, using a human apolipoprotein B protein specific antibody purchased from US Biological (Swampscott, MA).  Immunoblot analysis further demonstrates that apolipoprotein B protein in human hepatocytes is reduced in a dose-dependent manner following antisense oligonucleotide treatment with ISIS 301012.<br>
An additional experiment was performed to test the effects of ISIS 271009 (SEQ ID NO: 319), ISIS 281625 (SEQ ID NO: 224) and ISIS 301027 (SEQ ID NO: 262) on human apolipoprotein B mRNA in human primary hepatocytes.  Cells were cultured as described herein and treated with 5, 10, 50 or 150 nM of ISIS 271009, ISIS 281625 or ISIS 301027 for a period of 24 hours.  The control oligonucleotides ISIS- -13650 (SEQ ID NO: 806) and ISIS 113529 (SEQ ID NO: 859) were used at 50 or 150 nM.  Human apolipoprotein B mRNA<br><br>
expression was evaluated by real-time PCR as described by other examples herein.  Apolipoprotein B protein secreted into the cultured cell media was measured in the samples treated with 50 and 150 nM of oligonucleotide, using a target protein specific ELISA kit (ALerCHEK Inc., Portland, ME) .<br>
The data, shown in Table 37, represent the average 2 experiments and are normalised to untreated control cells. Where present, a "+" indicates that gene expression was increased.<br>

These data demonstrate that ISIS 271009, ISIS 281625 and ISIS 301027 inhibit apolipoprotein B mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in human primary hepatocytes.  ISIS 271009 and ISIS 301027 inhibit the secretion of apolipoprotein B protein from cells in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
Example 57<br>
Effects of apolipoproteinB-100 antisense pligonucleotides<br>
on apolipoprotein(a) expression<br>
Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] contains two disulfide-linked<br><br>
distinct proteins, apolipoprotein (a)- and apolipoprotein B (Rainwater and Kaminerer, J. Exp. Zool., 1998, 282, 54-61). In accordance with the present invention, antisense oligonucleotides targeted to apolipoprotein 3 were tested for effects on the expression of the apolipoprotein (a) component of the lipoprotein(a) particle in primary human hepatocytes.<br>
Primary human hepatocytes (inVitro Technologies, Baltimore, MD), cultured and transfected as described herein, were treated with 5, 10, 50 or 150 nM of ISIS 271009 (SEQ ID NO: 319), 281625 (SEQ ID NO: 224), 301012 (SEQ ID NO: 247) or 301027 (SEQ ID NO: 262).  Cells were also treated with 50 or 150 nM of the control oligonucleotides ISIS 113529 (SEQ ID NO: 859) or ISIS 13650 (SEQ ID NO: 806).  Untreated cells served as a control. Following 24 hours of oligonucleotide treatment, apolipoprotein(a) mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR as described in other examples herein.<br>
Probes and primers to human apolipoprotein(a) were designed to hybridize to a human apolipoprotein(a) sequence, using published sequence information (GenBank accession number NML005577.1, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 860) .  For human apolipoprotein (a) the PCR primers were :<br>
forward primer: CAGCTCCTTATTGTTATACGAGGGA (SEQ ID NO: 8 61) reverse primer: TGCGTCTGAGCATTGCGT (SEQ ID NO: 862) and the PCR probe was: FAM-CCCGGTGTCAGGTGGGAGTACTGC-TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 863) where FAM is the fluorescent dye and TAMRA is the quencher dye.<br>
' Data are the average of three experiments and are expressed as percent inhibition relative to untreated<br><br>
controls.  The results are shown in Table 38.  A "+" or "-"<br>
preceding the number indicates that apolipoprotein(a) expression was increased or decreased, respectively, following treatment with antisense oligonucleotides.<br>
Table 3 8<br>
Effects of apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotides on<br>
apolipoprotein(a) expression<br><br>
These results illustrate that ISIS 3 01012 did not inhibit the expression of apolipoprotein(a) in human primary hepatocytes.  ISIS 271009 inhibited apolipoprotein (a) expression at the highest dose.  ISIS 281625 and ISIS 301027 decreased the levels of apolipoprotein(a) mRNA.<br>
Example 58<br>
Inhibition of lipoprotein(a) particle secretion with<br>
antisense oligonucleotides targeted to apolipoproteinB-100<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the secretion of lipoprotein(a) particles, which are comprised of one apolipoprotein(a) molecule covalently linked to one apolipoprotein B molecule, was evaluated in primary human hepatocytes treated with antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the apolipoprotein B component of lipoprotein(a).<br><br>
Primary human hepatocytes. (InVitro Technologies, Baltimore, MD) , cultured and transfected as described herein, were treated for 24 hours with 50 or 150 nM of ISIS 271009 (SEQ ID NO: 319), 281625 (SEQ ID NO: 224), 301012 (SSQ ID NO: 247) cr 301027 (SEQ ID NO: 262).  Cells were also treated with 150 nm of the control oligonucleotides ISIS 113529 (SEQ ID NO: 859) or ISIS 13650 (SEQ ID NO: 806).  Untreated cells served as a control.  Following 24 hours of oligonucleotide treatment, the amount of lipoprotein(a) in the culture medium collected from the treated cells was measured using a commercially available ELISA kit (ALerCKEK Inc., Portland, ME).  The results are the average of three experiments and are expressed as percent change in lipoprotein(a) secretion relative to untreated controls.  The data are shown in Table 39.  A " + " or tt-u preceding the number indicates that lipoprotein(a) particle secretion was increased or decreased, respectively, following treatment with antisense oligonucleotides targeted to apolipoprotein B.<br>
Table 39<br>
Inhibition of lipoprotein(a) particle secretion with antisense oligonucleotides targeted to apolipoprotein B<br><br>
These data demonstrate that antisense inhibition of apolipoprotein B, a component of the lipoprotein(a) particle, can reduce the secretion of lipoprotein(a) from human primary hepatocytes.  In addition, this reduction in<br><br>
lipoprotein(a) secretion is not necessarily concomitant with a decrease in apolipoprotein(a) mRNA expression, as shown in Example 57.<br>
Example 59<br>
Mismatched and trunctated derivatives of ISIS 301012<br>
As demonstrated herein, ISIS 301012 (SEQ ID NO: 247) reduces apolipoprotein B mRNA levels in cultured human ceil lines as well as in human primary hepatocytes. In a further embodiment of the invention, a study was performed using nucleotide sequence derivatives of ISIS 301012.  A series of oligonucleotides containing from 1 to 7 base mismatches, starting in the center of the ISIS 3 01012 sequence, was designed.  This series was designed to introduce the consecutive loss of Watson-Crick base pairing between ISIS 301012 and its target mRNA sequence.  These .compounds are shown in Table 40.  The antisense compounds with mismatched nucleotides relative to ISIS 3 01012 are chimeric oligonucleotides ("gapmers") 20 nucleotides in length, composed of a central "gap" region consisting of ten 2'-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (5' and 3' directions) by five-nucleotide "wings".  The wings are composed of 2'-methoxyethyl (2 '-MOE)nucleotides.  The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P=S) throughout the oligonucleotide.<br>
An additional derivative of ISIS 3 01012 was designed, comprising the ISIS 301012 sequence with 2'MOE nucleotides throughout the oligonucleotide (uniform 2'-MOE).  This compound is 20 nucleotides in length, with phosphorothioate linkages throughout the oligonucleotide.  This compound is also shown in Table 40.<br><br>
HepG2 cells were treated with 50 or 150 nM of the compounds in Table 40 for a 24 hour period, after which RNA was isolated and target expression was measured by realtime ?CR as described herein.  Untreated cells served as controls.  The results are shown in Tables 40 and are normalized to untreated control samples.<br>
Table 40<br>
Effects of ISIS 301012 mismatched oligonucleotides and a uniform 2'MOE oligonucleotide on apolipoprocein 3<br>
expression ir. HepG2 cells .<br><br>
The results of treatment of HepG2 cells with the compounds in Table 40 reveals that none of the compounds displays the dose-dependent inhibition observed following treatment with the parent ISIS 3 01012 sequence,  ISIS 332770, which has only a single thymidine to cytosine substitution in the center of the oligonucleotide, was 3-<br><br>
fold less potent than ISIS 3 01012.  Further nucleotide substitutions abrogated antisense inhibition of apolipoprotein B expression.<br>
Phosphorochioate chimeric oligcnucleotides are metabolized in vivo predominantly by endonucleolytic cleavage.  In accordance with the present invention, a series of oligonucleotides was designed by truncating the ISIS 3 01012 sequence in 1 or 2 base increments from the 5' and/or 3' end.  The truncated oligonucleotides represent the possible products that result from endonucleotlytic cleavage.  These compounds are shown in Table 41.  The compounds in Table 41 are chimeric oligonucleotides ("gapmers") of varying lengths, composed of a central "gap" region consisting of 2' -deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both ends by 2 '-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE)nucleotides .  The exact structure of each chimeric oligonucleotide is designated in Table 41 as the "chimera structure".  For example, a designation of 4-10-4-indicates that the first 4 (5' most) and last 4 (3' most) nucleotides are 2'-MOE nucleotides, and the 10 nucleotides in the gap are 2'-deoxynucleotides .  2'-MOE nucleotides are indicated by bold type.  The intemucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphodiester (P=O) between underscored nucleotides; all other intemucleoside linkages are phosphorothioate (P=S).<br>
These compounds were tested for their ability to reduce the expression of apolipoprotein B mRNA.  HepG2 cells were treated with 10, 50 or 150 xM of each antisense compound in Table 41 for a 24 hour period, after which RNA was isolated and target expression was measured by realtime PCR as described herein. Untreated cells served as controls.  The results are shown in Tables 41 and are normalized to untreated control samples.<br><br>
Table 41<br>
Effect of ISIS 3 01012 truncation mutants on apolipoprotein<br>

The results in Table 41 illustrate that inhibition of apolipoprotein B is dependent upon sequence length, as well as upon sequence complementarity and dose, as demonstrated in Table 41, but truncated versions of ISIS 301012 are to a certain degree capable of inhibiting apolipoprotein B mRNA expression.<br>

Design and screening of dsRNAs targeting human<br>
apolipoprotein B<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a series of nucleic acid duplexes comprising the antisense compounds of the present invention and their complements were designed to target apolipoprotein B and are shown in Table 42 .  All compounds in Table 42 are oligoribonucleotides 20<br><br>
nucleotides in length with phosphodiester internucleoside linkages (backbones) throughout the compound.  The compounds were prepared with blunt ends.  Table 41 shows the antisense strand of the dsRNA, ar,d the sense strand is synthesized as the complement of the antisense strand. These sequences are shown to contain uracil (U) but one of skill in the art will appreciate that: uracil (U) is generally replaced by thymine (T) in DNA sequences. "Target site" indicates the first: (5'-most) nucleotide number on the particular target sequence to which the compound binds.  A subset of the compounds in Table 42 are the RNA equivalents of DNA antisense oligonucleotides described herein, and, where applicable, this is noted by the ISIS # of the DNA oligonucleotide in the column "RNA equivalent of ISIS #".<br>
Table 42 dsRNAs targeted to human apolipoprotein B<br><br><br><br>
The dsRNA compounds in Table 42 were tested for their effects on human apolipoprotein nmRNA in HepG2 cells.  HepG2 cells were treated with 100 nM of dsRNA compounds mixed with 5 Î¼g/mL LIPOFECTIN (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) for a period of 15 hours.  In the same experiment, HepG2 cells were also treated with 150 nM of subset of the antisense oligonucleotides described herein mixed with 3.75 ug/mL LIPOFECTIN; these compounds are listed in Table 43. Control oligonucleotides included ISIS 18 078 (GTGCGCGCGAGCCCGAAATC, SEQ ID NO: 838).  ISIS 13078 is a chimeric oligonucleotide ("gapmer") 2 0 nucleotides in length, composed of a central "gap" region consisting of 9 2'-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on the 5' and 3' ends by a five-nucleotide "wing" and a six-nucleotide "wing", respectively.  The wings are composed of 2'-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE)nucleotides.  The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P=S) throughout the oligonucleotide.  All cytidines are 5-methylcytidines. The duplex of ISIS 263188 (CUUCUGGCAUCCGGUUUAGTT, SEQ ID NO: 889) and its complement was also used as a control. ISIS 263188 is an oligoribonucleotide 21 nucleotides in length with the 2 nucleotides on the 3' end being oligodeoxyribonucleotides (TT) and with phosphodiester internucleoside linkages (backbones) throughout the compound.<br>
Cells were treated for 4 hours, after which human apolipoprotein B mRNA expression was measured as described by examples herein.  Results were normalized to untreated control cells, which were not treated with LIPOFECTIN or oligonucleotide.  Data are the average of 4 experiments and are presented in Table 43.<br><br>

Antisense inhibition of apolipoprotein B in Cynomolgous<br>
monkey primary hepatocytes<br><br>
As demonstrated in Example 46, the region containing the target site to which ISIS 301012 hybridizes shares 96% identity with the corresponding region of Cynomolgus monkey apolipoprotein B mRNA sequence.  ISIS 3 01012 contains two mismatched nucleotides relative to the Cynomolgous monkey apolipoprotein B mRNA sequence to which it hybridizes.  In a further embodiment cf the invention, oligonucleotides were designed to target regions of the monkey apolipoprotein B mRNA, using the partial Cynomologous monkey apolipoprotein 3 sequence described herein (SEQ ID NO: 855) and an additional portion of Cynomolgous monkey apolipoprotein B RNA sequence, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 890.  The target site indicates the first (5'-most) nucleotide number on the particular target sequence to which the oligonucleotide binds.  For ISIS 326358 (GCCTCAGTCTGCTTTACACC, SEQ ID NO: 891) the target site is nucleotide 168 of SEQ ID NO: 855 and for ISIS 315089' (AGATTACCAGCCATATGCAG, SEQ ID NO: 892) the target site is nucleotide 19 of SEQ ID NO: 890.  ISIS 326358 and ISIS 315089 are chimeric oligonucleotides ("gapmers") 20 nucleotides in length, composed of a central "gap" region consisting of ten 2'-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (51 and 3' directions) by five-nucleotide "wings".  The wings are composed of 2'-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE)nucleotides.  The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P=S) throughout the oligonucleotide. All cytidine residues are 5-methyloytidines.  ISIS 326358 and ISIS 315089 are the Cynomolgous monkey equivalents of the human apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotides ISIS 301012 (SEQ ID NO: 247) and ISIS 281625 (SEQ ID NO: 224), respectively       <br><br>

Methods  for evaluating hepatic  steatosis<br>
Hepatic steatosis refers  to the accumulation of lipids in the liver,   or  "fatty liver",   which is  frequently caused<br><br>
by alcohol consumption, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Livers of animals treated with antisense cligonucleotides targeted to apolipoprotein 3- were evaluated for the presence of steatosis.  Steatosis is assessed by histological analysis of liver tissue and measurement of liver triglyceride levels.<br>
Tissue resected from liver is immediately immersed in Tissue Tek OCT embedding compound (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) and frozen in a 2-methyl-butane dry ice slurry.  Tissue sections are cut at a thickness of 4-5 Î¼m and then fixed in 5% neutral-buffered formalin.  Tissue sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin following standard histological procedures to visualise, nuclei and cytoplasm, respectively, and oil red 0 according to the manufacturer' s instructions (Newcomers Supply, Middleton, WI) to visualize lipids.<br>
Alternatively, tissues are fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at a thickness of 4-5 Î¼m, deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, all according to standard histological procedures.<br>
Quantitation of liver triglyceride content is also used to assess steatosis.  Tissue triglyceride levels are measured using a Triglyceride GPO Assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).<br>

Effects of antisense inhibition by ISIS 301012 in lean<br>
mice:  long-term study<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the toxicity of ISIS 301012 (SEQ ID NO: 247) is investigated in a long-term, 3 month study in mice.  Two-month old male and<br><br>
female CD-I mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) are dosed with 2, 5, 12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg of ISIS 3 01012 twice per week for first week, and every 4 days thereafter.  The mice are maintained on a standard rodent diet.  Saline and control oligonucleotide animals serve as controls and are injected on the same schedule.  Each treatment group contains 6 to 10 mice of each sex, and each treatment group is duplicated, one group for a 1 month study termination, the other for a 3 month study termination.  After the 1 or 3 month treatment periods, the mice are sacrificed and evaluated for target expression in liver, lipid levels in serum and indicators of toxicity. Liver samples are procured, RNA is isolated and apolipoprotein B mRNA expression is measured by real-time PCR as described in other examples herein.  Serum lipids, including total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, are evaluated by routine clinical analysis using an Olympus Clinical Analyzer (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY),  Ratios of LDL-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol are also calculated. Analyses of serum ALT and AST, inflammatory infiltrates in tissue* and basophilic granules in tissue provide an assessment of toxicities related to the treatment.  Hepatic steatosis, or accumulation of lipids in the liver, is assessed by routine histological analysis with oil red 0 stain and measurement of liver tissue triglycerides using a Triglyceride GPO Assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) .<br>
The toxicity study also includes groups of animals<br>
allowed to recover following cessation of oligonucleotide<br>
Â»treatment.  Both male and female CD-I mice (Charles River<br>
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) are treated with 5, 10, 50<br><br>
mg/kg of ISIS 301012 twice per week for the first week and every 4 days thereafter.  Saline and control oligonucleotide injected animals serve as controls.  Each treatment group includes 6 animals per sex.  After 3 months of treatment, animals remain untreated for an additional 3 months, after which they are sacrificed-  The same parameters are evaluated as in the mice sacrificed immediately after 3 months of treatment.<br>
After one month of treatment, real-time PCR quantitation reveals that mouse apolipoprotein B mRNA levels in liver are reduced by 53%.  Additionally, the expected dose-response toxicities were observed.  ALT and AST levels, measured by routine clinical procedures on an Olympus Clinical Analyzer (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY), are increased in mice treated with 25 or 50 mg/kg of ISIS 301012.  Tissues were prepared for analysis by routine histological procedures.  Bascphilic granules in liver and kidney tissue were observed at doses of ISIS 3 01012 above 12.5 mg/kg.' Mild lymphohisticcytic infiltrates were, observed in various tissues at doses greater than 12.5 mg/kg of ISIS 301012.  Staining of tissue sections with oil red 0 reveals no steatosis present following the oligonucleotide treatments.<br>

Effects of antisense inhibition by ISIS 301012 in lean<br>
Cynomolgous monkeys:  long-term study<br>
As discussed in Example 45, Cynomolgus monkeys (male or female) are used to evaluate antisense oligonucleotides for their potential to lower apolipoprotein B mRNA or protein levels, as well as phenotypic endpoints associated with apolipoprotein B including, but not limited to<br><br>
â¢diovascular indicators, atherosclerosis, lipid diseases, obesity, and plaque formation.  Accordingly, in a further embodiment of the invention, ISIS 3 01012 (SEQ ID NO: 247) is investigated in a long-term study for its effects on apclipoprotein B expression and serum lipids in Cynomolgous monkeys.  Such a long-term study is also used to evaluate the toxicity of antisense compounds.<br>
Male and female Cynomologous monkeys are treated with 2., 4 or 12 mg/kg of .ISIS 3 01012 intravenously or 2 or 20 mg/kg subcutaneously at a frequency of every two days for the first week, and every 4 days thereafter, for 1 and 3 month treatment periods.  Saline-treated animals serve as controls.  Each treatment group includes 2 to 3 animals of each sex.<br>
At &amp; one month interval and at the 3 month study termination, the animals are sacrificed and evaluated for target expression in liver, lipid levels in serum and indicators of toxicity.  Liver samples are procured, RMA is -isolated and apolipoprotein B mRNA expression is measured by real-time PCR as described in other examples herein. Serum lipids, including total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, are evaluated by routine clinical analysis using an Olympus Clinical Analyzer (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY).  Ratios of LDL-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol are also calculated.  Analyses of serum ALT and AST, inflammatory infiltrates in tissue and basophilic granules in tissue provide an assessment of toxicities related to the treatment.  Hepatic steatosis, or accumulation of lipids in the liver, is assessed by routine histological analysis with oil- red 0 stain and measurement<br><br>
of liver tissue triglycerides using a Triglyceride GPO Assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis; MO).<br>
Additional -reatment groups consisting of 2 animals per sex are treated with saline (0 mg/kg) , 12 or 2 0 mg/kg ISIS 3 01012 at a frequency of every two days for the first week, and every 4 days thereafter, for a 3 month period. Following the treatment period, the animals receive no treatment for an additional three months.  These treatment: groups are for the purpose of studying the effects of apolipoprotein B inhibition 3 months after cessation of treatment.  At the end of the 3 month recovery period, animals are sacrificed and evaluated for the same parameters as the animals sacrificed immediately after 1 and 3 months of treatment.<br>
The results from the one month interval of the long term treatment are shown in Table 50 and are normalized to saline-treated animals for mRNA and to untreated baseline values for lipid levels.  Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL particle concentration and triglyceride levels in serum were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy by Liposcience (Raleigh, NC).  Additionally, the concentration of intact oligonucleotide in liver was measured by capillary gel electrophoresis and is presented as micrograms of oligonucleotide per gram of liver tissue.  Each result represents the average of data from 4 animals (2 males and 2 females).<br>
Table 50<br>
Effects of antisense inhibition by ISIS 3 01012 in lean<br>
Cynomolgous monkeys<br><br><br>
These data show that ISIS 3 01012 inhibits<br>
apolipoprotein B expression in a dose-dependent manner in a primate species and concomitantiy lowers lipid levels at higher doses of ISIS 301012.  Furthermore, these results demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotide accumulates in the liver in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
Hepatic steatosis, or accumulation of lipids in the liver, was not observed following 4 weeks of treatment with the doses indicated.  Expected dose-related toxicities were observed at the higher doses of 12 and 20 mg/kg, including a transient 1.2-1.3 fold increase in activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) during the first 4 hours and basophilic granules in the liver and kidney (as assessed by routine histological examination of tissue samples) .  No functional changes in kidney were observed.<br>
In a similar experiment, male and female Cynomolgous monkeys received an intravenous dose of ISIS 301012 at 4 ing/kg, every two days for the first week and every 4 days thereafter.  Groups of animals were sacrificed after the<br><br>
first dose and the fourth dose, as well as 11, 15 and 23 days following the fourth and final dose.  Liver RNA was isolated and apolipoprotein B mRNA levels were evaluated by real-time PCR as described herein.  The results of this experiment demonstrate a 40% reduction in apolipoprotein B mRNA expression after a single intravenous dose of 4 mg/kg ISIS 301012.  Furthermore, after 4 doses of ISIS 301012 at 4 mg/kg, target mRNA was reduced by approximately 85% and a 50% reduction in target mRNA was sustained for up to 16 days following the cessation of antisense oligonucleotide treatment.<br>

Microarray analysis: gene expression patterns in lean<br>
versus high-fat fed mice<br>
Male C57B1/6 mice were divided into the following groups, consisting of 5 animals each: (1) mice-on a lean diet, injected with saline (lean control); (2) mice., on a high fat diet; (3) mice on a high fat diet injected with 50 mg/kg of the control oligonucleotide 141923 (SEQ ID NO: 858); (4) mice on a high fat diet given 20 mg/kg atorvastatin calcium (LipitorÂ®, Pfizer Inc.); (5) mice on a high fat diet injected with 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg ISIS 147764 (SEQ ID NO: 109).  Saline and oligonucleotide treatments were administered intraperitoneally twice weekly for 6 weeks.  Atorvastatin was administered daily for 6 weeks. At study termination, liver samples were isolated from each animal and RNA was isolated for Northern blot qualitative assessment, DNA microarray and quantitative real-time PCR. Northern blot assessment and quantitative real-time PCR were performed as described by other examples herein.<br>
For DNA microarray analysis, hybridization samples<br><br>
were prepared from 10 Î¼g of total RNA isolated from each mouse liver according to the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Samples were hybridized to a mouse gene chip containing approximately 22,000 genes, which was subsequently washed and double-stained using the Fluidics Station 400 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) as defined by the manufacturer's protocol.  Stained gene chips were scanned for probe cell intensity with the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Signal values for each probe set were calculated using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite v 5.0 software (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Each condition was profiled from 5 biological samples per group, one chip per sample.  Fold change in expression was computed using the geometric mean of signal values as generated by Microarray Suite v5.0.  Statistical analysis, utilized one-way AWOVA followed by 9 pair-wise comparisons.  All groups were compared to the high fat group to determine gene expression changes resulting from ISIS 147764 treatment. Microarray data was interpreted using hierarchical clustering to visualize global gene expression patterns.<br>
The results of the microarray analysis reveal that treatment with ISIS 147764 drives the gene expression profile in high fat fed mice to the profile observed in lean mice.  Real-time PCR analysis confirmed the reduction in mRNA expression for the following genes involved in the lipid metabolism:  hepatic lipase, fatty acid synthase ATP-binding cassette, sub-family D (ALD) member 2, intestinal fatty acid binding protein 2, stearol CoA desaturase-1 and HMG CoA reductase.<br><br>
Mouse apolipoprotein B mRNA and serum cholesterol levels, measured as described herein, were evaluated to confirm antisense inhibition by ISIS 147764 and ISIS 147483.  Both mRNA and cholesterol levels were lowered in a dose-dependent manner following treatment with ISIS 147754 or ISIS 147483, as demonstrated in other examples herein. The 50 mg/kg dose of ISIS 147483 increased ALT and AST levels.  The 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg doses of ISIS 147764 and the 10 and 25mg/kg doses of ISIS 147483 did not significantly elevate ALT or AST levels.<br>

Evaluation of hepatic steatosis in animals treated with<br>
apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotides<br>
Livers of animals treated with antisense oligonucleotides, targeted to apolipoprotein 3 were evaluated for the presence of steatosis.  Steatosis is assessed by histological analysis of liver tissue and measurement of liver triglyceride levels.<br>
Evaluation of steatosis in high fat fed animals treated with ISIS 147764 for 6 weeks<br>
Liver tissue from ISIS 147764 (SEQ ID NO: 109) and control-treated animals described in Example 21 was evaluated for steatosis at study termination following 6 weeks of treatment.  Tissue sections were stained with oil red 0 and hematoxylin to visualize lipids and nuclei, respectively.  Tissue sections were also stained with hematoxylin and eosin to visualize nuclei and cytoplasm, respectively.  Histological analysis of tissue sections stained by either method reveal no difference in steatosis between saline treated and ISIS 1477 64 treated animals,<br><br>
demonstrating that a 6 week treatment with ISIS 147764 does not lead to accumulation of lipids in the liver.<br>
Evaluation of steatosis following long-term treatment with apolipoprotein B inhibitor in high-fat fed animals<br>
Male C57B1/6 mice were treated with twice weekly intraperitoneal injections of 25 mg/kg ISIS 147764 (SEQ ID NO: 109)lor 25 mg/kg ISIS 141923 (SEQ ID NO: 858) for 6, 12 and 20 weeks.  Saline treated animals served as controls. Each treatment group contained 4 animals.  Animals were sacrificed at 6, 12 and 2 0 weeks and liver tissue was procured for histological analysis and measurement of tissue triglyeride content.  The results reveal no significant differences in liver tissue triglyceride content when ISIS 147764 treated animals are compared to saline treated animals.  Furthermore, histological analysis of liver tissue section demonstrates -that steatosis is reduced at 12 and 20 weeks following treatment of high fat fed mice with ISIS 147764, in comparison to saline control animals that received a high fat diet.<br>
Evaluation of steatosis in lean mice<br>
The accumulation of lipids in liver tissue was also evaluated in lean mice. Male C67B1/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) at 6 to 7 weeks of age were maintained on a standard rodent diet and were treated twice weekly with intraperitoneal injections of 25 or 50 mg/kg 147764 (SEQ ID NO: 109) or 147483 (SEQ ID NO: 79) for 6 weeks.  Saline treated animals served as controls.  Each treatment group was comprised of 4 animals.  Animals were sacrificed after the 6 week treatment period, at which point liver tissue and serum were collected.<br><br>
Apolipoprotein 3 mRNA levels were measured by realtime PCR as described by other examples herein.  The data, shown in Table 51, represent the average of 4 animals and are presented as inhibition relative to saline treated controls.  The results demonstrate that both ISIS 147483 and ISIS 147764 inhibit apolipoprotein B mRNA expression in lean mice in a dose-dependent manner.<br><br>
Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides in serum were measured by routine clinical analysis using an Olympus Clinical Analyzer (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY).  The liver enzymes ALT and ALT in serum were also measured using the Olympus Clinical Analyzer.  These results demonstrate that ISIS 147764 lowers serum lipids relative to saline-treated control animals.  ALT and AST levels do not exceed the normal range for mice (300 IU/L) , indicating a lack of treatment-associated toxicity.  The results are the average of data from 4 animals and are shown in Table 52.<br>

Liver tissue was prepared by routine iiistological methods to evaluate steatosis, as described herein. Examination of tissue samples stained with oil red 0 or hematoxylin and eosin reveals that treatment of lean mice with apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotides does not result in steatosis.<br>
Six month study to further evaluate steatosis in mice treated with apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotides<br>
A long-term treatment of mice with antisense oligonucleotides targeted to apolipoprotein B is used to evaluate the toxicological and pharmacological effects of extended treatment with antisense compounds.  Both male and female C57B1/6 mice at 2 months of age are treated with 2, 5, 25 or 50 mg/kg of apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotide.  Treatments are administered intraperitoneally every 2 days for the first week and every 4 days thereafter-  Mice treated with saline alone or control oligonucleotide serve as control groups.  Each<br><br>
treatment group contains 25 to 3 0 mice.  After 6 months of treatment, a subset of the mice in each treatment group is sacrificed.  The remaining mice are allowed a 3 month recovery period without treatment, after which they are sacrificed.  Apoiipoprotein B mRNA expression in liver is measured by real-time PCR as described by other methods herein.  Liver tissue is also prepared for measurement of criglyceride content using a Triglyceride GPO Assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).  Serum is collected and evaluated for lipid content, including total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride,. using an Olympus Clinical Analyzer (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) .  The liver enzymes ALT and AST are also measured in serum, also using the clinical analyzer.  Serum samples are subjected to immunoblot analysis using an antibody directed to apolipoprotein B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) .  Liver, kidney and other tissues are prepared by routine procedures for histological analyses.  Tissues are evaluated for the presence of basophilic granules and inflammatory infiltrates.  Steatosis is evaluated by oil red 0 stain of liver tissue sections.<br>
Example 67<br>
A mouse model for atherosclerotic plague formation:  human<br>
apolipoprotein B transgenic mice lacking the LDL receptor<br>
gene<br>
The LDL receptor is responsible for clearing apolipoprotein B-containing LDL particles.  Without the LDL receptor, animals cannot effectively clear apolipoprotein<br>
B-containing LDL particles from the plasma. Thus the serum<br>
&gt;<br>
*<br>
levels of apolipoprotein B and LDL cholesterol are markedly elevated.  Mice expressing the human apolipoprotein B<br><br>
transgene (TgN-hApoB +/+) and mice deficient for the LDL receptor (LDLr -/-) are both used as animal models of atherosclerotic plaque development.  When the LDL receptor deficiency genotype is combined with a human apolipoprotein B transgenic genotype (TgN-hApoB +,' + ; LDLr -/-) , atherosclerotic plaques develop rapidly.  In accordance with the present invention, mice of this genetic background are used to investigate the ability of compounds to prevent atherosclerosis and plaque formation.<br>
Male TgN-hApoB +/+;LDLr -/- mice are created twice weekly with 10 or 2 0 mg/kg of human apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotides for 12 weeks.  Control groups are treated with saline or control oligonucleotide.  Serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides are measured at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks by routine clinical analysis using an- Olympus Clinical Analyzer (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY).  Serum human apolipoprotein B protein is measured at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks using an ELISA kit (ALerCHEK Inc., Portland, ME). Human and mouse apolipoprotein ruRWA in liver is measured at 12 weeks.  The results of the 12 week study serve to evaluate the pharmacological behavior of ISIS 3 01012 in a doubly transgenic model.<br>
Additionally, a four month study is performed in TgN-hApoB +/+;LDLr -/- mice, with treatment conditions used in the 12 week study.  Mice are treated for 4 months with antisense oligonucleotides targeted to human apolipoprotein B to evaluate the ability of such compounds to prevent atherosclerotic plaque formation.  At the end of the 4 month treatment period, mice are anesthetized and perfused with 10% formalin.  The perfused arterial tree is isolated and examined for the presence of atherosclerotic plaques.<br><br>
Sections of the arterial tree are embedded in paraffin and prepared for histological analysis using routine methods. Serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides are measured at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 weeks by routine clinical analysis using an Olympus Clinical Analyzer (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY). Serum human apolipoprotein B protein is measured at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 weeks using'an ELISA kit (ALerCHEK Inc., Portland, ME) .  Human and mouse apolipoprotein mRNA in liver at 16 weeks is measured by real-time PCR.<br>
Example 68<br>
Rabbit models for study of atherosclerotic plaque formation<br>
The Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) strain of rabbit is used as a model for atherosclerotic plaque formation.  New Zealand white rabbits on a high-fat diet are also used as a model of atherosclerotic plaque     formation. Treatment of WHHL or high fat fed New Zealand white rabbits with apolipoprotein B antisense compounds is used to test their potential as therapeutic or prophylactic treatraents for atherosclerotic plaque disease.  Rabbits are injected with 5, 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg of antisense oligonucleotides targeted to apolipoprotein B, Animals treated with saline alone or a control oligonucleotide serve as controls.  Throughout the treatment, serum samples are collected and evaluated for apolipoprotein B protein levels by ELISA (kit from ALerCHEK Inc., Portland, ME) and serum lipids (cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-        cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides) by routine  clinical analysis.  Liver tissue triglyceride content is measured using a Triglyceride 320 Assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).  Liver, kidney, heart, aorta and other tissues<br><br>
are procured and processed for histological analysis using routine procedures.  Liver and kidney tissues are examined for evidence of basophilic granules and inflammatory infiltrates.  Liver tissue is evaluated for steatosis using oil red 0 stain.  Additionally, aortic sections stained with oil red 0 stain and hematoxylin are examined to evaluate the formation of atherosclerotic lesions.<br>

A suitable animal subject may be an experimental animal, such as a mouse, rat, mouse, a rat, a dog, a monkey, a non-human primate, a cat or a pig.<br>
In some embodiments, the subject may be a human.  In certain embodiments, the subject may be a human patient in<br><br>
need of therapeutic treatment as discussed in more detail herein.  In certain embodiments, the subject may be in need of modulation of expression of one or more genes as discussed in more detail herein.  In some particular embodiments, the subject may be in need of inhibition of expression of one or more genes as discussed in more detail herein.  In particular embodiments, the subject: may be in need of modulation, i.e. inhibition or enhancement, of apolipoprotein B in order to obtain therapeutic indications discussed in more detail herein.<br>
In some embodiments, non-parenteral (e.g. oral) oligonucleotide formulations according to the present invention result in enhanced bioavailability of the oligonucleotide. In this context, the term "bioavailability" refers to a measurement of that portion of an administered drug which reaches the circulatory system (e.g. blood, especially blood plasma) when a particular mode of administration is used to deliver the drug.  Enhanced bioavailability refers to a particular mode of administration's ability to deliver oligonucleotide to the peripheral blood plasma of a subject relative to another mode of administration.  For example, when a non-parenteral mode of administration (e.g. an oral mode) is used to introduce the drug into a subject, the bioavailability for that mode of administration may be compared to a different mode of administration, e.g. an IV mode of administration.  In some embodiments, the area<br>
under a compound's blood plasma concentration curve (AUC0)<br>
after non-parenteral (e.g. oral, rectal, intrajejunal) administrckion may be divided by the area under the drug's plasma concentration curve after intravenous (i.v.)<br>
administration (AUCiv) to provide a dimensionless quotient (relative bioavailability, RB) that represents fraction of compound absorbed via the non-parenteral route as compared to the IV route.  A composition's bioavailability is said to be enhanced in comparison to another composition's<br><br>
bioavailability when the first composition's relative bioavailability (RB2) is greater than the second composition's relative bioavailability (RB,) .<br>
In general, bioavailability correlates with<br>
therapeutic efficacy when a compound's therapeutic efficacy is related to the blood concentration achieved, even if the drug's ultimate site of action is intraceilular (van Berge-Henegouwen ec al., Gastroenterol. , 1977, 73, 300). Bioavailability studies have been used to determine the degree of intestinal absorption of a drug by measuring the change in peripheral blood levels of the drug after an oral dose (DiSanto, Chapter 7 6 In: Remington=s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed. , Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990, pages 1451-1458) .<br>
In general, an oral composition's bioavailability is said to be "enhanced" when its relative bioavailability is greater than the bioavailability of a composition substantially consisting of pure oligonucleotide, i.e. oligonucleotide in the absence of a penetration enhancer.<br>
Organ bioavailability refers to the concentration of compound in an organ.  Organ bioavailability may be measured in test subjects by a number of means, such as by whole-body radiography.  Organ bioavailability may be modified, e.g. enhanced, by one or more modifications to the oligonucleotide, by use of one or more carrier compounds or excipients, etc. as discussed in more detail herein.  In general, an increase in bioavailability will result in an increase in organ bioavailability.<br>
Oral oligonucleotide compositions according to the present invention may comprise one or more "mucosal penetration enhancers," also known as "absorption enhancers" or simply as "penetration enhancers." Accordingly, some embodiments of the invention comprise at least one oligonucleotide in combination with at least one penetration enhancer.- In general, a penetration enhancer is a substance that facilitates the transport of a drug across mucous membrane(s) associated with the desired mode<br><br>
of administration, e.g. intestinal epithelial membranes. Accordingly it is desirable to select one or more penetration enhancers that facilitate the uptake of an oligcnucleotide, without interfering with the activity of the oligonucleotide, and in a such a manner the oligonucleotide can be introduced into the body of an animal without unacceptable side-effects such as toxicity, irritation or allergic response.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provide compositions comprising one or more pharmaceuticaliy acceptable penetration enhancers, and methods of using such compositions, which result in the improved bioavailability of oligonucleotides administered via non-parenteral modes of administration.  Heretofore, certain penetration enhancers have been used to improve the bioavailability of certain drugs.  See Muranishi, Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1 and Lee et al. , Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, 8, 91.  It has been found that the uptake and delivery of oligonucleotides, relatively complex molecules which are known to be difficult to administer to animals and man, can be greatly improved even when administered by non-parenteral means through the use of a number of different classes of penetration enhancers.<br>
In some embodiments, compositions for non-parenteral administration include one or more modifications from naturally-occurring oligonucleotides (i.e. full-phosphodiester deoxyribosyl or full-phosphodiester ribosyl oligonucleotides).  Such modifications may increase binding affinity, nuclease stability, cell or tissue permeability, tissue distribution, or other biological or pharmacokinetic property.  Modifications may be made to the base, the linker, or the sugar, in general, as discussed in more detail herein with regards to oligonucleotide chemistry. In some embodiments of the invention, compositions for administration to a subject, and in particular oral compositions for administration to an animal or human<br><br>
subject, will comprise modified oligonucleotides having one or more modifications for enhancing affinity, stability, tissue distribution, or other biological property.<br>
Suitable modified linkers include phosphorothioate linkers.  In some embodiments according to the invention, che oligonucleotide has at least one phosphorothioate linker.  Phosphorothioate linkers provide nuciease stability as well as plasma protein binding characteristics to che oligonucleotide.  Nuciease stability is useful for increasing the in vivo lifetime of oligonucleotides, while plasma protein binding decreases the rate of first pass clearance of oligonucleotide via renal excretion.  In some embodiments according to the present invention, the oligonucleotide has at least two phosphorothioate linkers. In some embodiments, wherein the oligonucleotide has exactly n nucleosides, the oligonucleotide has from one to n-1 phosphorothioate linkages.  In some embodiments, wherein the oligonucleotide has exactly n nucleosides, the oiigonucleotide has n-1 phosphorothioate linkages.  In other embodiments wherein the oligonucleotide has exactly n nucleoside, and n is even, the oligonucleotide has from 1 to n/2 phosphorothioate linkages, or, when n is odd, from 1 to (n-l)/2 phosphorothioate linkages.  In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide has alternating phosphodiester (PO) and phosphorothioate (PS) linkages.  In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide has at least one stretch of two or more consecutive PO linkages and at least one stretch of two or more PS linkages.  In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide has at least two stretches of PO linkages interrupted by at least on PS linkage.<br>
In some embodiments, at least one of the nucleosides is modified on the ribosyl sugar unit by a modification that imparts nuciease stability, binding affinity or some other beneficial biological property to the sugar.  In some cases, the sugar modification includes a 2' -modification, e.g. the 2'-OH of the ribosyl sugar is replaced or substituted.  Suitable replacements for 2'-OH include 2'-F<br><br>
and 2'-arabino-F.  Suitable substitutions for OH include 2'-O-alkyl, e.g. 2-O-methyl, and 2'-O-substituted alkyl, e.g. 2'-O-methoxyethyl, 2'-Oaminopropyl, etc.  In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide contains at least one 2'-modification.  In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide contains at least 2 2'-modifications.  In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide has ~z least one 2' -modification at each of the termini (i.e. the 3'- and 5'-terminal nucieosides each have the same or different 2'-incdifications).  In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide has at least two sequential 2'-modifications at each end of the oligonucleotide.  In some embodiments, oligonucleotides further comprise at least one deoxynucleoside.  In particular embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise a stretch of deoxynucleosides such that the stretch is capable of activating RNase (e.g. RNase H) cleavage of an RNA to which the oligonucleotide is capable of hybridizing.  In some embodiments, a stretch of deoxynucleosides capable of activating KNase-mediated cleavage of RNA comprises about 5 to about 16, e.g. about 8 to about 16 consecutive deoxynucleosides.<br>
Oral compositions for administration of non-parenteral oligonucleotide compositions of the present invention may be formulated in various dosage forms such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, liquid syrups, soft gels, suppositories, and enemas.  The term "alimentary delivery" encompasses e.g. oral, rectal, endoscopic and sublingual/buccal administration. A common requirement for these modes of administration is absorption over some portion or all of the alimentary tract and a need for efficient mucosal penetration of the nucleic acid(s) SQ administered.<br>
Delivery of a drug via the oral mucosa, as in the. case of buccal and sublingual administration, has several desirable -features, including, in many instances, a more rapid rise in plasma concentration of the drug than via oral delivery (Harvey, Chapter 35 In: Remington~s<br><br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton,PA, 1990, page 711).<br>
Endoscopy may be used for drug delivery directly to an interior portion of the alimentary tract.  For example, endoscopic retrograde cystopancreatography (ERCP) takes advantage of extended gastroscopy and permits selective access to the biliary tract and the pancreatic duct (Hirahata et al., Gan To Kagaku Ryoho, 1992, 19(10 Suppl.), 1591).  Pharmaceutical compositions, including liposomal formulations, can be delivered directly into portions of the alimentary canal, such as, e.g., the duodenum (Somogyi err al.r Pharm. Res., 1995, 12, 149) or the gastric submucosa (Akamo et al.t Japanese J. Cancer Res., 1994, 85, 652) via endoscopic means.  Gastric lavage devices (Inoue et al., Artif. Organs, 1997, 21, 28) and percutaneous.<br>
endoscopic feeding devices (Pennington et al., Ailment Pharmacol. Ther., 1995, 9, 471) can also be used for direct alimentary delivery of pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
In some embodiments, oligonucleotide formulations may be administered through the anus into the rectum or lower intestine.  Rectal suppositories, retention enemas or rectal catheters can be used for this purpose and may be preferred when patient compliance might otherwise be difficult to achieve (e.g., in pediatric and geriatric applications, or when the patient is vomiting or unconscious).  Rectal administration can result in more prompt and higher blood levels than the oral route. (Harvey, Chapter 35 In: Remington=s Pharmaceutical Sciences{ 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990, page 711).  Because about 50% of the drug that is absorbed from the rectum will bypass the liver, administration by this route significantly reduces the potential for first-pass metabolism (Benet et al., Chapter 1 In: Goodman &amp; Gilman=s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed., Hardman et al., eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, 1996).<br><br><br><br><br>
One advantageous method of non-parenteral administration oligonucleotide compositions is oral delivery.  Some embodiments employ various penetration enhancers in order to effect transport of oligonucleotides and other nucleic acids across mucosal and epithelial membranes.  Penetration enhancers may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories - surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chela-ing agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (Lee et al. , Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug- Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92) . Accordingly, some embodiments comprise oral oligonucleotide compositions comprising at least one member of the group consisting of surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating surfactants.  Further embodiments comprise oral oligonucleotide comprising at least one fatty acid, e.g. capric or lauric acid, or combinations or salts thereof.  Other embodiments comprise methods of enhancing the oral bioavailability of an oligonucleotide, the method comprising co-administering the oligonucleotide and at least one penetration enhancer.<br>
Other excipients that may be added to oral oligonucleotide compositions Include surfactants (or "surface-active agents"), which are chemical entities which, when dissolved in an aqueous solution, reduce the surface tension of the solution or the interfacial tension between the aqueous solution and another liquid, with the result that absorption of oligcnucleotides through the alimentary mucosa and other epithelial membranes is enhanced.  In addition to bile salts and fatty acids, surfactants include, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page.92); and perfluorohemical emulsions, such as FC-43 (Takahashi et al., J. Pharm. Phamacol.r 1988, 40, 252).<br>
Fatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers and may be used in compositions of<br><br>
the present invention include, for example, oleic acid, lauric acid, capric acid (n-decanoic acid), myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monociein (1-monooleoyl-rac-glycerol) , dilaurin, caprylic acid, arachidonic acid, giyceryl 1-monocaprate, l-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, acylcarnitines, acylcholines and monoâ¢ and di-glycerides thereof and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof (i.e., oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, linoleace, etc.) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1; El-Hariri et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1992, 44, 651) .<br>
In some embodiments, oligonucleotide compositions for oral delivery comprise at least two discrete phases, which phases may comprise particles, capsules, gel-capsules, microspheres, etc.  Each phase may contain one or more oligonucleotides, penetration enhancers, surfactants, bioadhesives, effervescent agents, or other adjuvant, excipient or diluent.  In some embodiments, one phase comprises at least one oligonucleotide and at lease one penetration enhancer.   In some embodiments, a first phase comprises at least one oligonucleotide and at least one penetration enhancer, while a second phase comprises at least one penetration enhancer.  In some embodiments, a first phase comprises at least one oligonucleotide and at least one penetration enhancer, while a second phase comprises at least one penetration enhancer and substantially no oligonucleotide.  In some embodiments, at least one phase is compounded with at least one degradation retardant, such as a coating or a matrix, which delays release of the contents of that phase.  In some embodiments, at least one phase In some embodiments, a -first phase comprises at least one oligonucleotide, at least one penetration enhancer, while a second phase comprises at least one penetration enhancer and a release-<br><br>
retardant;..  In particular embodiments, an oral oligonucleotide comprises a first phase comprising particles containing an oligonucleotide and a penetration enhancer, and a second phase comprising particles coated with a release-retarding agent and containing penetration enhancer.<br>
A variety of bile salts also function as penetration enhancers to facilitate the uptake and bioavailabilicy of drugs.  The physiological roles of bile include the facilitation of dispersion and absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins {3runton, Chapter 3 8 in: Goodman &amp; Gilman=s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed./ Hardman et al., eds. , McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, 1995, pages 934-935).  Various natural bile salts, and their synthetic derivatives, act as penetration enhancers.  Thus, the term "bile salt" includes any of the naturally occurring components of bile as well as any of their synthetic derivatives.  The bile salts of the invention include, for example, cholic acid (or its pharmaceutically acceptable sodium salt, sodium cholate), dehydrocholic acid (sodium dehydrocholate), deoxycholic acid (sodium deoxycholate), glucholic acid (sodium glucholate), glycholic acid (sodium glycocholate), glycodeoxycholic acid (sodium glycodeoxycholate) , taurocholic acid (sodium taurocholate), taurodeoxycholic acid (sodium taurodeoxycholate), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, sodium chenodeoxycholate), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), sodium tauro-24,25-dihydro-fusidate (STDHF), sodium glycodihydrofusidate and polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (POE) (Lee et al.f Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Swinyard, Chapter 39 In: Remington-s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990, pages 782-783; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1; Yamamoto et al., J. Pharm. Exp. Ther., 1992, 263, 25; Yamashica et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1990, 79, 579) .<br><br>
In some embodiments, penetration enhancers useful in some embodiments of present invention are mixtures of penetration enhancing compounds.  One such penetration enhancer is a mixture of UDCA (and/or CDCA) with capric and/or lauric acids or salts thereof e.g. sodium.  Such mixtures are useful for enhancing the delivery of biologically active substances across muccsal membranes, in particular intestinal mucosa.  Other penetration enhancer mixtures comprise about 5-95% of bile acid or salt(s) UDCA and/or CDCA with 5-95% capric and/or lauric acid. Particular penetration anhancers are mixtures of the sodium salts of UDCA, capric acid and lauric acid in a ratio of about 1:2:2 respectively.   Anther such penetration enhancer is a mixture of capric and lauric acid (or salts thereof) in a 0.01:1 to 1:0.Gl ratio (mole basis).  In particular embodiments capric acid and lauric acid are present in molar ratios of e.g. about 0.1:1 to about 1:0-1, in particular about 0.5:1 to about 1:0.5.<br>
Other excipients include chelating agents, i.e. compounds that remove metallic: ions from solution by forming complexes therewith, with the result that absorption of oligonucleotides through the alimentary and other mucosa is enhanced.  With regards to their use as penetration enhancers in the present invention, chelating agents have the added advantage of also serving as DNase inhibitors, as most characterized DNA nucleases require a divalent metal ion for catalysis and are thus inhibited by chelating agents (Jarrett, J. Chromatogr., 1993, 618, 315). Chelating agents of the invention include, but are not limited to, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) , citric acid, salicylates (e.g., sodium salicylate, 5-methoxysalicylate and homovanilate) , N-acyl derivatives of collagen, laureth-9 and N-amir.0 acyl derivatives of beta-diketones (enamines)(Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1; Buur et al. , J. Control F.el. , 1990, 14, 43).<br><br>
 t<br>
As used herein, non-chelating non-surfactant: penetration enhancers may be defined as compounds tha demonstrate insignificant activity as chelacing agents or as surfactants but that nonetheless enhance absorption of oligonucleotides through the alimentary and other mucosal membranes (Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 199 0, 7, 1) .  This class of penetration enhancers includes, but is not limited to, unsaturated cyclic ureas, 1-alkyl- and l-alkenylazacycio-alkanone derivatives (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug- Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92); and non-steroidai anti-inflammatory agents such as diclofenac sodium, indomethacin and phenylbutazone (Yamashita et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1987, 39, 621).<br>
Agents that enhance uptake of oligonucleotides at the cellular level may also be added to the pharmaceutical and other compositions of the present invention.  For example, cationic lipids, such as lipofectin (Junichi et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,705,188), cationic glycerol derivatives, and polycationic molecules, such as polylysine (Lollo et al., PCT Application WO 97/30731), can be used.<br>
Some oral oligonucleotide compositions also incorporate carrier compounds in the formulation.  As used herein, "carrier compound" or "carrier" can refer to a nucleic acid, or analog thereof, which may be inert (i.e., does not possess biological activity per se) or may be necessary for transport, recognition or pathway activation or mediation, or is recognized as a nucleic acid by in vivo processes that reduce the bioavailability of a nucleic acid having biological activity by, for example, degrading the biologically active nucleic acid or promoting its removal from circulation.  The coadministration of a nucleic acid and a carrier compound, typically with an excess of the latter substance, can result in a substantial reduction of the amount of nucleic acid recovered in the liver, kidney or other extracirculatory reservoirs, presumably due to competition between the carrier compound and the nucleic<br><br>
 acid for a common receptor.  For example, the recovery of a partially phosphorothioate oligonucleotide in hepatic tissue can be reduced when it is coadministered with polyinosinic acid, dextran sulfare, polycytidic acid or 4-acetamido-4  isothiocyano-stilbene-2,2 -disulfonic acid (Miyao et al., Aztisense Res. Dev., 1995, 5, 115; Takakura en al., Ant is ens 3 &amp; Nucl, Acid Drug Dev. , 1996, 5, 177).<br>
A "pharmaceutical carrier" or "excipient" may be a pharmaceuticaiiy acceptable solvent, suspending agent or any other pharmacologically ir.ert vehicle for delivering one or more nucleic acids to an animal.  The excipient may be liquid or solid and is selected, with the planned manner of administration in mind, so as to provide for the desired bulk, consistency, etc., when combined with a nucleic acid and the other components of a given, pharmaceutical composition.  Typical pharmaceutical carriers include, but are not limited to, binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, etc.); fillers (e.g. , lactose and other sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, pectin, gelatin, calcium sulfate, ethyl cellulcse, polyacrylates or calcium hydrogen phosphate, etc.); lubricants {e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, silica, colloidal silicon dioxide, stearic acid, metallic stearates, hydrogenated vegetable oils, corn starch, polyethylene glycols, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, etc.); disintegrants (e.g. , starch, sodium starch glycolate, EXPLOTAB); and wetcing agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, etc.).<br>
Oral oligonucleotide compositions may additionally contain other adjunct componets conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage levels.  Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional, compatible, pharmaceutically-active materials such as, for example, antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the exposition of present<br><br>
invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers.  However, such materials, when added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the components of the compositions of the present invention.<br><br>
