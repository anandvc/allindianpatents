				<td>A PORTABLE DEVICE FOR ENHANCING BLOOD AND LYMPH FLOW IN A LIMB<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to enhancement of blood and<br>
lymph flow in a limb and the prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a portable, self contained,<br>
mechanical device for enhancing the blood in a limb, enhancing the lymph and<br>
venous return from a limb, specifically a lower limb, towards the heart, aiming<br>
at reducing the risk of DVT formation, edema formation and improving the<br>
general circulation in a limb during periods of immobility.<br>
DISCUSSION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
The development of a "blood clot" or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)<br>
in a limb, specifically in the lower limbs, is a major health hazard. It may lead to<br>
local symptoms and signs such as redness, pain and swelling of the affected<br>
limb. It may also be a life hazard by sending small parts of a blood clot towards<br>
the lungs corking the circulation through the lungs (called Pulmonary<br>
Embolism), leading to reduced ability of the lungs and sometimes of the heart to<br>
function. This is accompanied by pain, shortness of breath, increased heart rate<br>
and other clinical signs and symptoms.<br>
The development of DVT is believed to be related pathologically to<br>
Virchow's triad. More specifically, a DVT has increased incidence if three<br>
conditions are met in the vasculature; Stasis (reduced blood flow),<br>
Hypercouagulability (increased tendency of clotting in a blood vessel during<br>
normal conditions) and Endothelial damage (damage to the internal layer of the<br>
blood vessel promotes clot formation).<br>
In the ambulatory person the muscles of the leg compress the deep<br>
venous system of the leg pushing the blood towards the heart. This phenomena<br>
is called the "muscle pump". The muscles of the calf are traditionally implicated<br>
in the mechanism of the "muscle pump".<br>
During period of immobilization, stasis is believed to be the major<br>
risk factor for the formation of DVT. Immobilization includes any period of<br>
lack of physical activity whether in the supine or sitting position e.g. bed or<br>
chair ridden persons, during long automobile trips, long flights, long working<br>
hours in the sitting position etc.<br>
Recently the medical community named the formation of DVT<br>
during long journeys, the "travelers thrombosis". It is believed that around 5%<br>
of manifested DVT originate during traveling. This is believed to occur due to<br>
the prolonged immobilization, especially while in the sitting position. This<br>
position further compromises blood flow due to kinking of veins in the limb<br>
during the sitting position. It was further shown that enhancing the venous blood<br>
flow (via a compressing device) during flight, reduced discomfort, limb<br>
swelling, fatigue and aching when used on flight attendants.<br>
Limb swelling and discomfort may be present also in states of lymph<br>
stasis such as after a mastectomy and in other conditions in which lymphatic<br>
return to the heart is impaired.<br>
Increasing the flow of blood in the limb during periods of immobility<br>
is already a proven method to prevent the formation of DVT in the limb. It<br>
secondarily prevents the formation of pulmonary embolism (PE) that commonly<br>
originates from a DVT. Increasing the venous return from the lower limb can<br>
also prevent formation of edema, pain and discomfort in the limb during periods<br>
of immobilization.<br>
Prevention of DVT related to stasis is commonly achieved via large<br>
and cumbersome devices. Most of these devices can be used only by trained<br>
medical staff. Such devices operate by either of two methods:<br>
Pneumatic/Hydraulic intermittent compressions or by direct intermittent<br>
electrical stimulation of the "muscle pump". The Pneumatic/hydraulic devices<br>
use a sleeve or cuff with a bladder that is inflated and deflated by air or fluid<br>
compressor thus causing stimulation of the physiological "muscle pump". The<br>
pneumatic/hydraulic devices usually require a sophisticated set of tubes and<br>
valves, a compressor, a source of fluid and a sophisticated computer control.<br>
Moreover such devices emit substantial noise while operating. The electrical<br>
stimulators work by delivering electrical impulses to the calf muscles. These<br>
devices require a sophisticated electronic apparatus and may be painful or<br>
irritating to patient.<br>
Most existing devices aimed at preventing DVT are designed for use<br>
in the medical setting, by trained personal. Such devices are generally non-<br>
portable.<br>
Accordingly it is the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
device for the enhancement of blood and lymph flow in a limb and the<br>
prevention of DVT development during periods of immobility which simulate<br>
intermittent muscle compression of a limb and is portable, self-contained, does<br>
not relay on, but is compatible with, external power source, and is easily carried,<br>
small, and lightweight.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a device<br>
which is simple to operate by a lay person without any special training in the<br>
field of medicine, is easily strapped over or attached to a limb and can be easily<br>
be adjusted to fit persons of any size.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide such a device<br>
for the prevention of DVT which does not involve air compression and which<br>
operates silently, thus allows its operation in a populated closed space, such as<br>
during a flight, without causing any environmental noise annoyance.<br>
Yet it is another object of the present invention is to provide the<br>
intermittent muscle compression by mechanical means, more specifically by<br>
transforming energy, electrical or magnetic, into mechanical activity via a<br>
system of rods and wheels.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide such a device<br>
for the prevention of DVT that is easy to manufacture and is low cost<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the above objects, the present invention provides<br>
a portable device and method for enhancing blood and lymph flow in a limb and<br>
for reducing the risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis formation by applying periodic<br>
squeezing forces on a limb, in particular a lower limb.<br>
The device of the present invention is a small, portable, simple,<br>
mechanical device that produces intermittent mechanical compression of the<br>
deep venous system in a limb, more specifically the lower limb, by converting<br>
energy, more specifically electrical or magnetic energy into mechanical<br>
compressions, more specifically via strap compression or plate compression by<br>
the use of rods and wheel mechanical apparatus.<br>
The present device comprises a casing box, preferably a flask-like<br>
curved box for fitting the curvature of the limb, and a strap connected by its two<br>
ends to opposite sides of said casing box such as to form a closed loop around<br>
the limb, The casing box contains a power source means, a motor powered by<br>
said power source means and a mechanical means coupled to said motor for<br>
actuating periodical charige in the circumference of said closed loop between a<br>
contracted and a relaxed positions. Said periodical change in the circumference<br>
of said closed loop is obtained either by intermittently pulling and releasing at<br>
least one end of the strap toward the casing or by intermittently extending and<br>
retracting a compressive plate positioned between the casing and the limb.<br>
Preferably, the periodical transition between the contracted and relaxed<br>
positions are controlled such as to allow different time periods in each position.<br>
Preferably, a cycle comprises a fast contraction, followed by much longer<br>
period of relaxation. The device further comprises adjustments means for<br>
adjusting the ciroumferenoe of the bop to the circumference of said limb.<br><br>
Preferably the device further comprises regulation means for<br>
regulating the frequency of said periodical change and for regulating the length<br>
interval between said contracted and relaxed positions of said loop.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A device for the intermittent compression of the extremities muscles<br>
for the enhancement of blood and lymph flow in a limb and the prevention of<br>
Deep Vein Thrombosis is disclosed.<br>
The portable device of the present invention, generally designated<br>
100, is shown in Fig. 1, worn on the calf of a sitting person, Device 100 can be<br>
worn directly on the bare limb, or on a garment, such as trousers, worn by the<br>
person using the device.<br>
Device 100 comprises two main components, an assembly box 2<br>
which contains all the machinery parts responsible for the device operation, and<br>
a strap 1 connected to said assembly box such as to form a closed loop<br>
(designated 50, see Figs.2) for encircling a person limb. The power supply for<br>
the device may be of the' internal power supply type such as a rechargeable or<br>
non rechargeable low voltage DC batteries or an external power supply type<br>
such as an external power outlet connected via an AC/DC transformer such as a<br>
3-12V 1Amp transformer, fed through electrical wires to a receptacle socket in<br>
the device (not shown).<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, strap 1 is preferably wide in the middle and<br>
narrow at the ends where it connects to assembly box 2. Strap 1 however may<br>
assume any other shape and form such as a constant width belt. The strap can be<br>
fabricated from any flexible material that is non-irritating to the skin, such as<br>
thin plastic, woven fabric and the like. Strap 1 can be fabricated from one<br>
material or alternatively can combine more than one material. For example,<br>
strap 1 can be made of both non stretchable material and stretchable material<br>
wherein such an arrangement may be dispose of a stretchable material for<br>
example rubber fabric in the center of the strap 1 and a non stretchable material<br>
such as plastic flanking the stretchable material and comprising the rest of the<br>
strap. Such an arrangement facilitates a more uniform stretch forces on the strap<br>
as well as preventing the slippage of the strap from the limb.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment shown in Fig.l, hereinafter<br>
called the anterior box embodiment, strap 1 is placed against the muscles while<br>
assembly box 2 is placed against the calf bone. However, according to another<br>
embodiment, of the present invention, hereinafter called the posterior box<br>
embodiment, assembly box 2 can be placed against the muscles.<br>
Figs. 2 illustrate two possible embodiments of the device of the<br>
present invention. Fig. 2A represents a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
device, in which squeezing the limb muscles for promoting the increase of<br>
blood and lymph flow in the limb, is performed by pulling and releasing strap 1,<br>
thus, intermittently shortening the effective length of loop 50 encircling the<br>
limb. This embodiment is preferably used as an anterior box embodiment of the<br>
present invention. However, it will be easily appreciated that the device of Fig<br>
2A can be used as a posterior box embodiment as well.<br>
Fig. 2B presents another embodiment of the present device in which<br>
assembly box 2 is the active intermittent compressing part by means of mobile<br>
plate 3 attached to the box. This embodiment, which can be used only as a<br>
posterior box embodiment, will be explained in conjunction with Fig. 6.<br>
Turning back to Fig. 2A, assembly box 2 comprises a thin, curved<br>
flask-shaped casing 25 which contains all the parts of internal machinery<br>
responsible for intermittent pulling and releasing strap 1. Casing 25 is preferably<br>
fabricated from, but not limited to, a plastic molding, a light metal, or any other<br>
material which is light, non irritating to the skin, and cheep to produce.<br>
Strap 1 is connected at both its ends to assembly box 2 by means of<br>
two buckles 4 and 42 at the sides of casing 25 (buckle 42 not shown). At least<br>
one of said buckles (here buckle 4) is a mobile buckle, which can move in and<br>
out of casing 25 through slit (opening) 61, thus pulling and relaxing strap 1<br>
between a retracted and a relaxed positions. The retraction protraction motion<br>
shortens and lengthens the effective length of strap 1, thus causing intermittent<br>
compression of the underlying muscle and increasing the blood and lymph flow<br>
in the underlying vessels. Possible inner machinery responsible for activating<br>
the intermittent pulling of strap 1 is described in the following in conjunction<br>
with Figs. 3 to 6.<br>
Strap 1 can be adjusted to fit the size of the limb, on which device<br>
100 is to be operated, by having at least one of its ends free to move through its<br>
corresponding buckle, such that the strap can be pulled by said end for<br>
tightening the strap around said limb. Said end is then anchored in the<br>
appropriate position. In the example shown here, the strap is folded back on<br>
itself and the overlapping areas are fastened to each other by fastening means<br>
65, such as Velcro™ strips, snap fasteners or any other fastening or securing<br>
means. Alternatively, said strap end can be secured to casing 25 by fastening<br>
means such as Velcro strips, opposite teeth-like protrusions both on casing 25<br>
and on strap 1, and the like.<br>
The second end of strap 1 can be connected to its corresponding<br>
buckle either in a permanent manner by attaching means such as knots or bolts,<br>
or can be adjustable in a similar manner to what had been described above,<br>
allowing both ends to be pulled and anchored simultaneously for better fitting.<br>
Yet, in accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the<br>
strap can be wound around a retracting mechanism positioned at one side of<br>
casing 25. The free end of the strap can be provided with a buckle for allowing<br>
connection into the opposite side of casing 25 either by one of the<br>
aforementioned means described or by means of a quick connector.<br>
Outer casing box 25 also includes an on/off switch 6, a force<br>
regulator 5 for regulating the force exerted on the calf muscle by strap 1 and a<br>
rate regulator 7 for regulating the frequency of intermittent compressions.<br>
Alternatively, force regulator 5 and on/off switch 6 can be combined into one<br>
button. Force regulation can be obtained for example by way of controlling the<br>
length of the strap interval between retracted and protracted positions. The<br>
length interval between contracted and relaxed positions is preferably, but not<br>
limited to, 1 -50 millimeters._Frequency regulation can be obtained by way of<br>
regulating, but not limited to, the speed of the inner machinery.<br>
A person skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the present<br>
invention can be used for the enhancement of both arterial and venous blood<br>
and lymph flow in a limb (upper and lower). The examples provided in the<br>
following discussion serve as an example and should not be construed as a<br>
limitation to the application of the preset invention.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 3A and 3B, there is shown a side view and a<br>
top view respectively of first inner machinery for the device of Fig. 2A. The<br>
numerical are corresponding in both drawings. According to this embodiment,<br>
one end of strap 1 is connected to assembly box 2 via a fixed fitting 42 by<br>
means such as bolts, knots glue, etc. The second end is connected via a<br>
movable buckle 4, which traverses slit 61 located at the side of casing 25.<br>
Buckle 4 can retract and protract through opening 61, as described above.<br>
Movable buckle 4 is connected to the inner machinery by means of attachment<br>
to a rigid push/pull rod 24<br>
The inner machinery responsible for the motion of movable buckle 4<br>
is herein described.<br>
An energy source 20 such as low voltage DC batteries, supplies<br>
electrical energy to an electrical motor 21 such as, but not limited to, a 3-12 V<br>
DC motor, via electrical contacts such as wires.<br>
Electric motor 21 converts electric energy into kinetic energy,<br>
spinning a spirally grooved (worm) central shaft 22. Shaft 22 is coupled to a<br>
(speed reduction) wheel 23, having complementary anti-spiral circumferential<br>
grooves or teeth, causing wheel 23 to revolve around its center which is fixed by<br>
axis 18 perpendicular to its surface. An elongated connector plate 26 is<br>
pivotally jointed at one end to off-center point 53 on wheel 23 and at its second<br>
end to rod 24 at point 54, such that the rotation of wheel 23 actuates plate 26 to<br>
intermittently push and pull rod 24, in a crankshaft manner. Consequently,<br>
mobile buckle 4 is intermittently pulled inward and outward casing 25 through<br>
slit 61, thus intermittently shortening the circumference of loop 50.<br>
A modified machinery, represented in Fig 3C, includes the following<br>
changes with reference to Fig. 3A and 3B. The electric motor 21 and spinning<br>
worm shaft 22 are replaced with an electromagnetic motor 21' (such as a push-<br>
pull solenoid 191C distributed by Shindengen electric Ltd.) having a<br>
reciprocating central rod 22' with an upwardly inclined spike-tooth projection<br>
50 at its end. Rod 22', via projection 50 is coupled to wheel 23, having<br>
complementary teeth. As reciprocating rod 22' slightly protrudes from, and<br>
retracts into the motor body, projection 50 latches sequential teeth of wheel 23<br>
as it protrudes and pulls wheel 23 as it retracts, causing wheel 23 to revolve<br>
around its axis. The mechanism of Fig. 3C generates a large force output while<br>
minimizing the power input. Such a machinery is very cost effective.<br>
The above description clearly shows how the internal mechanical<br>
machinery of the proposed device acts to intermittently shorten loop 50,<br>
culminating in intermittent compression of the leg or hand muscle and leading<br>
to increase of venous return and helping in the prevention of the formation of<br>
deep vein thrombosis.<br>
An alternative machinery embodiment for the device embodiment of<br>
Fig. 2A is shown in Fig. 4A, 4B and 4C. Fig. 4A is a perspective drawing view<br>
showing the internal parts of assembly box 2 with the frontal part of casing 25<br>
removed. Fig. 4B and 4C side and top view, respectively of the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 4A. According to this embodiment, both ends of strap 1 are<br>
connected to the inner machinery of assembly box 2 by means of two movable<br>
buckles 4 and 34, which can move inwardly and outwardly casing 25 through<br>
slits 61 and 61', respectively.<br>
This alternative embodiment combines the following elements:<br>
A rectangular plate 33 positioned close to one side wall of casing 25,<br>
adjacent to slit 61. Plate 33 having two parallel rectangular surfaces, two narrow<br>
vertical edges, designated 45 and 46, and two narrow horizontal edges. Plate 33<br>
is pivotally mounted at its narrow horizontal edges to the top and bottom walls<br>
of casing 25, by pivoting means 39, such as to allow rotational movement of the<br>
plate around the vertical axis connecting between pivoting means 39;<br>
A push-pull electromagnetic motor 31 (such as pull tubular solenoid<br>
190 distributed by Shindengen electric Ltd.) connected via its reciprocating<br>
central rod 32 to one vertical edge (45) of the centrally hinged rectangular plate<br>
33, at about mid point of said edge;<br>
A longitudinal rod 35 spans the length of casing 25. Said longitudinal<br>
rod 35 is connected at one end to the opposite vertical edge (46) of plate 33 and<br>
at its second end to movable buckle 34 positioned at the other side of casing 25.<br>
Centrally hinged rectangular plate 33 is thus connected on one side to<br>
the electromagnetic motor 31 via central rod 32, and on the other side to<br>
longitudinal rod 35 (as best seen in Fig. 4C). Movable buckle 4 is also<br>
connected to narrow edge 45 of plate 33 but extends outwardly, through slit 61,<br>
in the opposite direction to rods 32 and 35.<br>
As can be best seen in Fig. 4C, the reciprocating movement of rod 32<br>
causes plate 33 to turn back and forth around its central axis, preferably the<br>
angular displacement is in the range of 20 to 60 degrees. Consequently, buckles<br>
4 (coupled directly to plate 33) and 34 (by means of connecting rod 35) are<br>
synchronously pulled and pushed inward and outward of casing 25, resulting in<br>
intermittent shortening of the limb encircling loop.<br>
This embodiment is advantageous because the longitudinal rod 35<br>
allows both buckles 34 and 4 to approximate each other at the same time, thus<br>
enhancing the efficiency of the device (by enhancing the reciprocating<br>
displacement of electromagnetic motor 31) and requiring less energy.<br>
Figs. 5A and 5B illustrate yet another alternative machinery for the<br>
device embodiment of Fig. 2A. The embodiment of Figs. 5 also uses a pull-push<br>
electromagnetic motor as the driving force but allows force enhancement by the<br>
addition of an "L" shaped lever bar 40 to the said centrally displaced rod 32 of<br>
the embodiment shown in Figs. 4. According to this embodiment, one edge of<br>
strap 1 is connected to fixed buckle 42 while the second end is connected to<br>
movable buckle 4 which transverse casing 25 through side slit 61. The movable<br>
buckle 4 is connected to centrally hinged rectangular plate 33 in a similar<br>
manner to what have been described in conjunction with Figs. 4.<br>
In accordance with the present embodiment, electromagnetic motor<br>
32 is pivotally mounted at its rear end to the base by pivoting means 99. The<br>
"L" shaped lever bar 40 pivotally mounted at its longer arm end to reciprocating<br>
rod 32 by pivoting means 39, and at its shorter arm end is attached to narrow<br>
edge 46 of plate 33, by attaching means 42, in a manner which allows it to slide<br>
up and down said edge. Such attaching means can be obtained, for example, by<br>
railing means such as a groove engraved along the edge of the short arm of lever<br>
40 and a matching protruding railing extending from narrow edge 46 of plate<br>
33. The right-angled corner of "L" shaped bar 40 is pivotally anchored to casing<br>
25 by means of axis 41 perpendicular to the bar surface.<br>
Fig 5A represents the "relaxed" mode (i.e., buckle 4 in protracted<br>
position), while Fig. 5B is in a "contracted" mode (buckle 4 in retracted<br>
position). To understand the action of this embodiment a static description of<br>
the "relaxed" mode followed by the "contracted" mode description is herein<br>
given.<br>
The "relaxed" mode in Fig. 5A, illustrates the electromagnetic motor<br>
32 at a perpendicular position to the base of casing 25, and "L" shaped lever 41<br>
in a perpendicularly positioned to reciprocating rod 32.<br>
The "contracted" mode is shown in Fig. 5B. When reciprocating rod<br>
32 retracts into electromagnetic motor 31, it causes the "L" shaped to rotate<br>
around axis 41, such that connection 69 moves toward electromagnetic motor 31<br>
as well as toward the rectangular plate 33. This rotation is allowed due to pivot<br>
attachment 99 of electromagnetic motor 31 and pivot attachment 41 of "L"<br>
shaped lever bar 40. The other end of the "L" shaped lever bar 41 slides in the<br>
upward direction on edge 46 of rectangular plate 33 and at the same time it<br>
pushes plate 33 causing it to rotate counterclockwise such that edge 45 and<br>
consequently buckle 4 are drawn deeper into casing 25.<br>
When reciprocating rod 32 reciprocates its motion, "L" shaped bar 41<br>
returns to its "relaxed" perpendicular position (Fig. 5A) and consequently edge<br>
45, along with buckle 4 are pushed outwardly.<br>
Thus, this chain of events leads to an effective intermittent shortening<br>
of the limb encircling loop (50) and to an intermittent compression of the<br>
underlying muscle enhancing the blood flow.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates yet another preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, including means for allowing asymmetrical contraction-relaxation<br>
cycle and in particular for allowing fast contractions, followed by much longer<br>
periods of relaxation. Such a cyclic pattern is found to have the most beneficial<br>
effect for enhancing blood and lymph flow. In accordance with this<br>
embodiment, the machinery components responsible for intermittent pulling and<br>
releasing strap 1 comprises a motor 121 having a worm shaft 122, a speed<br>
reducing gear comprising wheels 124 and 126, coupled to shaft 122, and a disk<br>
128 of irregular perimeter, concentrically mounted on wheel 126. Double-tooth<br>
disk 128 is shaped as two identical halves of varying curvature radius, each<br>
having a gradual slope at one end and a cusp 129 where the radius changes<br>
abruptly from maximum to minimum at its second end, wherein between two<br>
ends the radius of curvature is almost constant. The machinery components,<br>
including motor and wheels, are accommodated in a central compartment 120 of<br>
casing 25.<br>
Two side compartments, 110 and 140, accommodate laterally<br>
movable strap connectors 105 and 145, respectively. Compartments 110 and<br>
140 are provided with side slits 114 and 141, through which strap 1 can slide in<br>
and out. In accordance with the embodiment shown here, strap 1 is retractably<br>
mounted at one side of casing 25 (compartment 110) and having its free end<br>
provided with a quick male connector for connecting into complementary<br>
female connector in compartment 140. This strap fastening arrangement allows<br>
for quick and simple adjustment of the strap to the size of the limb and for<br>
exerting primary pressure on the muscles. Accordingly, connector 105 includes<br>
a vertical rod 102 rotatably mounted between two horizontal beams 116 and<br>
117, allowing rod 102 to revolve around its axis for rolling/unrolling strap 1.<br>
Strap 1 is affixed to rod 102 at one end and is wound around the rod. Rod 102,<br>
acting as a spool for strap 1, is provided with a retraction mechanism (not<br>
shown). The retraction mechanism can be any spring loaded retracting<br>
mechanism or any other retraction mechanism known in the art, such as are used<br>
with seat belts, measuring tapes and the like. For example, the retraction<br>
mechanism can comprise a spiral leaf spring having one end secured to rod 102<br>
so as to present torque on the rod when strap 1 is withdrawn and to cause the<br>
strap to roll back once its free end is released. The upper end of rod 102<br>
terminates with head 115 and a cap 116 of a larger diameter mounted on springs<br>
118. The inner surface of cap 116 fits onto outer surface of head 115, such that<br>
when cap 115 is pressed downward, it locks head 115, preventing free rotation<br>
of rod 102 and consequently preventing strap 1 from being rolled or unrolled.<br>
The second free end of strap 1 terminates with buckle 111 which fits into a<br>
complementary accepting recess 142 of connector 145 for allowing quick<br>
connection into the second side of casing 25. In the example illustrated here,<br>
buckle 111 has an arrow shape while connector 145 has a complementary arrow<br>
shape recess 142 provided with slanted protrusions 144 mounted on springs<br>
146. When buckle 111 (duplicated on the right side of Fig. 6 for description<br>
sake only) is pushed toward recess 142, protrusions 144 are pressed aside, then<br>
fall behind the arrow head of buckle 111, locking the buckle.<br>
Movable connectors 105 and 145 are coupled to the machinery<br>
components by means of horizontal rods 106, which extend through openings<br>
103 into central compartment 120 and are in contact with disk 128 perimeter.<br>
Horizontal rods 106 terminate with bearings 109 which allow the rods to<br>
smoothly slide along disk 128 perimeter as the disk revolves around its axis.<br>
Thus, the distance between rods 106, and consequently the periodical change of<br>
the circumference of the loop encircling the limb, mimics the outline shape of<br>
disk 128. In order to maintain constant contact between bearings 109 and disk<br>
128 and to facilitate fast transition between strap relaxed to contracted position,<br>
rods 106 are mounted on biasing springs 108 positioned between walls 105 and<br>
are provided with plates 107 perpendicular to the rod axis and pressed against<br>
springs 108. Thus, springs 108 bias connectors 105 and 145 in the inward<br>
direction toward each other. As disk 128 revolves around its axis, springs 108<br>
are compressed by plates 107 in accordance with disk 128 varying radius. When<br>
disk 128 rotates to the point where cusps 129 simultaneously face bearing 109,<br>
rods 106 momentarily lose contact with disk 128 and the potential energy stored<br>
in springs 105 is released, pushing rods 106 inwardly. This causes a sudden<br>
inward pulling of strap 1 by both rods 106, leading to sharp squeezing of the<br>
limb muscles. It will be easily realized that the length interval between<br>
contracted and released states of the limb encircling loop, and hence the<br>
squeezing force exerted on the muscles, is directly proportional to the radius<br>
change at cusp 129. Following the sudden strap contraction, the rods are<br>
gradually pushed outwardly leading to strap relaxed mode which lasts for<br>
substantially half a cycle. Hence, one revolution of disk 128 around its axis<br>
results in two fast strap contractions. Typically, the transition from relaxed to<br>
contacted position takes about 0.5 seconds, the transition from contracted to<br>
relaxed position takes about 5 seconds and the relaxed position is maintained for<br>
about 50 seconds. However, it will be easily realized that the perimeter of disk<br>
128 can be shaped such as to obtain any desired contraction-relaxation cyclic<br>
pattern.<br>
The device is further provided with an on/off switch 130 comprising<br>
button head 132, electrical connector 134 made of electric conductive material,<br>
and a bottom protrusion 136. When switch 130 is pushed to the left by means of<br>
head 132, connector 134 closes the electric circuit (shown in broken line),<br>
setting the machinery into action. Simultaneously, protrusion 136 presses cap<br>
116 downward, locking head 115 and preventing rod 102 from turning around<br>
its axis, for fixing the available length of strap 1. Button 132 can be further<br>
provided with a force regulator for regulating the frequency.<br>
A different embodiment of the present invention in which box<br>
assembly 2 is the active intermittent compressing part is depicted in Fig. 2B.<br>
According to this embodiment, assembly box 2 further comprises a compressing<br>
plate 3 lying substantially parallel to casing 25 at a predetermined distance from<br>
its surface. According to this embodiment, the assembly 2, more specifically<br>
said compressing plate 3 is pressed against the muscle and intermittently extend<br>
and retracts from casing 25 thus producing intermittent compression of the calf<br>
muscle.<br>
According to this embodiment strap 1 is connected to casing 2 by<br>
two fixed slited latches, such that at least one end of strap 1 is threaded through<br>
one of latches 68 and is folded onto itself to allow comfortable fitting, as<br>
described in conjunction to Fig. 2B. An on/off switch 6, a power regulator 5<br>
and a rate regulator 7 are located at the top of the device in the same fashion as<br>
in Fig 2B.<br>
A top view of a machinery embodiment in accordance with the<br>
device embodiment of Fig. 2B is shown in Fig. 7. A power source 20 powers an<br>
electrical motor 10 that has a centrally located shaft 11. Said centrally located<br>
shaft 11 is coupled to a velocity reduction gear 12 which reduces the spinning<br>
velocity of the rod 11 and increases the power output. Reduction gear 12 has a<br>
centrally located rod 13 that is connected to drum 14 that has an eccentric<br>
located rod 15. The eccentric located rod 15 is connected perpendicularly to the<br>
longer arm of a motion transfer L-shaped bar 16, wherein the shorter arm of said<br>
L-shaped bar 16 is connected to compressing plate 3 by connection means 17.<br>
Connection means 17 may be for example bolts, pins, screws etc.<br>
Electrical motor 10 converts electrical energy into kinetic energy<br>
stored in the spinning of the centrally located rod 11. The kinetic energy stored<br>
in the spinning of the said centrally located rod 11 is converted into power by<br>
the said velocity reduction gear 12. The power stored in the said centrally<br>
located rod 13 connected to the said velocity reduction gear 12 is converted to<br>
the rotation of the said drum 14 which has the said fitted eccentrically located<br>
rod 15. The circular motion of the said eccentrically located rod 15 is transferred<br>
to the extension and retraction of the said compressing plate 3 via the said<br>
motion transfer rod 16 and connection means 17.<br>
According to this arrangement, the circular motion of the<br>
eccentrically located rod 15 is transferred into periodical motion of plate 3. Said<br>
periodical motion of plate 3 is a combination of a first periodic motion in the<br>
extension-retraction direction (i.e., increasing and decreasing the distance<br>
between plate 3 and casing 25) as well as a second periodic motion which is<br>
perpendicular to said first periodic motion. (In accordance with Fig. 6, this<br>
second periodic motion is in a direction perpendicular to the drawing surface).<br>
Thus, further to the obvious effect of applying intermittent<br>
compression on the limb by the extension-retraction motion of plate 3, the<br>
present embodiment also imparts the device a "massage-like" effect, thus<br>
enhancing the squeezing efficacy.<br>
It will be easily realized by persons skilled in the art that the<br>
embodiments described in Figs. 3 - 7 are only examples and that different<br>
features described separately in conjunction with a particular embodiment, can<br>
be combined in the design of a device of the present invention. For example, a<br>
retractable strap feature as illustrated in Fig. 6 can be combined with any of the<br>
other embodiments. Much the same, an asymmetrical component such as disk<br>
128 of Fig. 6 can be added to any of the other embodiments for allowing a<br>
particular pattern of a contraction-relaxation cycle.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an exemplary Doppler ultrasound test results obtained<br>
by the application of the present invention. The results shown here were<br>
obtained by applying a device in accordance with the embodiment of Fig. 6 on a<br>
49 years old healthy woman in the supine position. The device was applied to<br>
the right thigh close to the groin. The right side of Fig. 8 is a Doppler ultrasound<br>
measurement of the patient just before the activation of the said device. The<br>
white areas represent the blood flow in the deep veins of the thigh. These white<br>
areas are taken here as baseline for this subject. The blood flow in the deep<br>
veins of the same subject is illustrated in the left picture of Fig. 8 immediately<br>
after the said device was put to action. Fig. 8 clearly shows the immediate<br>
enhancement in the venous blood flow above the said baseline upon operation<br>
of the device as depicted by higher peaks of white areas. The above Doppler<br>
Ultrasound example displays the efficacy of the present device.<br>
In-addition to the examples shown above, it will be apparent to the<br>
person skilled in the art that the device of the present invention can be readily<br>
used for the enhancement of blood flow in many situations. Such include<br>
persons sitting or laying for long periods of time (for example, during long air<br>
flights or car travels or long hours working at the sitting position or<br>
immobilization at the hospital or rehabilitation center and the like.) It will be<br>
apparent that it may also be used for the enhancement of blood flow of a patient<br>
with diseases such as Diabetes Mellitus and Burger's disease. Also, for the<br>
enhancement of lymph flow in the hand of a patient post mastectomy. Other<br>
uses not described here above will be apparent to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Providing said examples is made for the purpose of clarity and not limitation.<br>
