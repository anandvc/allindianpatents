whereby a coloured synthetic textile material is obtained.<br><br>
Different compounds of Formula (1) may be mixed or the compounds of Formula (1) may be mixed with dyes which do not contain an —SO2F group. The mixtures may be simple physical mixtures or may be mixed crystals formed for example by co-crystallisation. Such mixtures generally show improvement in dyeing properties. Crystalline modifications of compounds of Formula (1) exist and it is intended that the present definition includes such crystalline modifications which may be formed by heat treatment.<br><br>
The presence of one or more -SO2F groups in a dye molecule generally improves the properties of that dye and confers surprisingly good wet-fastness and light-fastness properties.<br><br>

The dye compounds of Formula (1). preferably have low solubility in water, typically less than 1% preferably less than 0.5% and especially less than 0.2% solubility in water. The dyes of Formula (1) are thus free from water solubilising groups such as —SO3H, -CO2H, —PO3H and quaternary amino.<br><br>

Compositions comprising dispersions of the compounds of Formula (1) in aqueous media are used in a process of the present invention. The compositions typically comprise from 1% to 30% of a compound of Formulae (1) in an aqueous medium. The compositions are preferably buffered at pH 2 to 7 more preferably at pH 4 to 6. For use, they may be diluted to provide a dye concentration therein of from 0.001% to 4%.<br><br>
These dispersions may further comprise ingredients conventionally used in dyeing applications such as dispersing agents for example lignosulphonates, naphthalene sulphonic acid/formaldehyde condensates or phenol/cresol/sulphanilic acid/formaldehyde condensates, surfactants, wetting agents such as alkyl aryl ethoxylates which may be sulphonated or phosphated, inorganic salts, de—foamers such as mineral oil or nonanol, organic liquids and buffers. Dispersing agents may be present at from 10% to 200% on the weight of the compound of Formulae (1) . Wetting agents may be used at from 0% to 20% on the weight of the compound (1) . The dispersions may •be prepared by bead milling the compound of Formula (1) with glass beads or sand in an aqueous medium.<br><br>
The compounds of Formula (1) may be obtained by usual methods for the preparation of azo compounds such as by diazotisation of an amine of Formula A—NH2 and coupling onto a component D-X in which A and D are as hereinbefore defined and X is a group displaceable by a<br><br>
diazotised amine. Typically the amine, A-NH2 may be diazotised in an acidic medium, such as acetic, propionic or hydrochloric acid using a nitrosating agent such as nitrosylsulphuric acid, sodium nitrite or methylnitrite at a temperature from —100C to 100C. Coupling onto the component D—X may be achieved by adding the diazotised amine to a mixture of D-X in an alkanol such as methanol at a temperature from 0CC to 100C. After coupling the compound of Formula (1) may be recovered from the reaction mixture by any convenient means such as by filtration.<br><br>
Fluorosulphonyl groups.may be introduced into the compounds of Formula (1) or into the A and D components prior to coupling by methods generally available in the literature. For example reaction of the compound of Formula (1), A-NH2, the NH2 being protectedas necessary, or D-X, in which A, and D are as hereinbefore defined, with chlorosulphonic acid optionally in the presence of dimethylformamide and thionylchloride at a temperature of from 300C to 1400C gives the chlorosulphonyl derivative. The chlorosulphonyl derivative may be reacted in boiling aqueous media with potassium fluoride to give the fluorosulphonyl derivative.<br><br>
Alternatively the compound of Formula (1), A-NH2 or D—X may be sulphonated with sulphuric acid or oleum to give the suiphonic acid derivative which may be converted to the chlorosuiphonyl derivative by reaction, either of the free acid or an inorganic salt thereof, with thionylchloride optionally in the presence of a chlorophosphorus compound such as phosphorus oxychioride or phosphorus pentachloride in an organic liquid such as an aromatic hydrocarbon at a temperature of from 200C to<br><br><br>
1100C. Similarly a sulphonate ester may be converted to the corresponding chlorosulphcnyl derivative. The chlorosulphonyl derivative may then be converted to the fluorosulphonyl derivative as described above.<br><br>
The compounds of Formulae (1) are useful for the coloration of synthetic textile materials particularly polyester textile materials and fibre blends thereof to which they impart colours which have excellent wet and light fastness properties.<br><br><br>
Therefore, the present invention provides for a process<br><br>
for the manufacture of a coloured synthetic textile material or fibre blend thereof which comprises applying to the synthetic textile material a dispersion comprising an aqueous medium and, dispersed therein, from 0.001% to 4% of a dye compound or mixture thereof, which is free from water solubilising groups, comprising:<br><br>
exhaust dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5 at a temperature of from 1250C to 1400C for from 10 to 120 minutes and under a pressure of from 1 to 2 bar, in which process a sequestrant of the kind such as herein described may be optionally added;<br><br>
