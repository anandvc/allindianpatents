FIRE PROOF DOOR WITH A SURROUNDING DOOR FRAME<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a fire proof door comprising a surrounding door frame. In this application two glass panes are proposed for a fire proof door including a frame spacing apart the glass panes.<br>
Today, fire proof doors are frequently executed as metal doors, the reason for said execution type are cost reduction effects.<br>
Such fire proof door is for example disclosed by EP 0 401 555 A2, where a glass pane is mounted within a metal frame equipped with a circumferential groove. In this case, the glass pane ends before the frame and is connected with the metal frame by means of additional metal edge strips serving as compensating adapters. In this case, the metal strips are connected with traditional fire proof glue for example made on water-glass base.<br>
A door frame profile for the fire proof doors is disclosed by EP 0 444 393 A2, where a glass pane is retained in a strong door frame profile. The door frame profile is executed as hollow section and it presents, inserted into its chambers, fire proof plates that guarantee the fire resistance of such a door.<br>
A fire-resistance glazing is described in DE 296 45 259 A1. In this case, silicate glass panes made from teMperated glass are used on the one side, and, on the other side of an intermediate air gap, a reinforced silicate glass pane is used.<br><br>
2 The construction of such fire-resistance glazing is realised, by means of a metal frame embracing and overlapping the border edge.<br>
DE 297 42 665 A1 reveals a fire retarding swing door or center pivoted door, where the door frame and the borders of the door leaves present a thermal insulative material, extending over the entire length and the entire width. This thermal insulative material will expand when heat develops, such that in the event of a fire, the door component has a secure fire barrier. This door is composed of plane material which is not transparent and, in a partial region, is . interrupted by a window to be mounted.<br>
Indian Patent Application IN/PCT/2001/00019 describes a fire proof door or fire proof window which allows for a variety of executions and arrangements resulting in a multitude of advantageous variants of adaptation and modification for creating a visually appealing fire proof door, or fire proof window, which simultaneously can be realized and adapted at little expense. Particularly with the modular use of the closing profiles, the frame structure offers the possibility of using the fire proof door or window for a variety of application purposes.<br>
As the above state-of-the-art shows, such technical designs today no longer match contemporary architecture. Today's goal is to give the impression that de-materialised transparent structures are used, which can no longer be achieved with the constructions known from the state-of-the-art. It is therefore the object<br><br>
3 of the invention to propose a solution realising the conception under economical aspects likewise of the region of the required fire protection partitions with its passageways, such that the observer does not notice that the present zone is actually a fire protection partition including a fire proof door. Simultaneously the solution of this task should include at the same time an increased safety feature aspect.<br>
The present invention solves the problem by providing a fire proof door with a surrounding door frame, consisting of a glass pane, which is embedded within its circumferential metal frame wherein the fire proof door consists of at least one door leaf built from two glass panes spaced apart by means of profiles, said glass panes almost extend as far as to the border of the door leaf, with a transparent fire protection material which is provided between the spaced glass panes and the fire proof door's fire protection efficacy is achieved by means of a fire   protection   laminate   introduced   into  the   profiles   respectively   between additional profiles, characterised in that the fire protection material is a fire proof glass pane inserted into the deepenings and said glass pane is supported by spacers with respect to the lateral glass panes.<br>
The profile preferably has a rounded exterior edge continuing on either side respectively in a profile projection, which are respectively executed such that just the glass pane edges (thickness of the glass panes) of the glass panes are covered.<br><br>
4 The profile may be arranged in the horizontal lower part of the door leaf, and respectively presents two recesses having almost the dimension measure of the thickness of the glass panes, into which recesses the glass panes are embedded, and deflecting legs with intermediate deepening are provided underside.<br>
The profiles may present a deepening oriented towards an air gap between the glass panes.<br>
A circumferential spacer section preferably engages into the deepening, leaning at the same time on the glass panes and a space created by means of the spacer section is filled in with a fire protection material. The fire protection material may be a fire proof gel.<br>
The spacer section can be installed at a distance with respect to the profiles. Preferably, the spacer section is executed as double wall with intermediate air gap.<br>
A circumferential frame may be formed between the glass panes by means of the profiles, which frame is covered through an enamelling on the glass panes in the region of the profiles. The profiles may be made from plastic, metal, steel or wood.<br><br>
5 Fittings are preferably incorporated within the profiles. A fire protection laminate may be installed into the exterior edge of the profiles, which laminate will intumesce when heat develops.<br>
The door frame may consist of a divided additional profile with intermediate fire protection laminate. The door frame is preferably mounted over an existing jamb.<br>
The door frame can be built by gypsum plasterboards. The door leaf may be a single leaf or a double leaf swing door. The door leaf can be a single leaf or a double lead center pivoted door. The glass panes preferably consist of safety glass. The plastic may be a glass fiber reinforced plastic.<br>
It is proposed to conceive a fire proof door according to the principle of "structural glazing" such that the door leaf consists of spaced plane glass panes. The glass panes are spaced apart by means of an intermediate frame made from profiles.<br>
In this case, the glass panes extend as far as almost to the border of the door leaf, only the proper edges are protected from damage by a small overhang of the intermediate profiles. As this protection applies just to this case, a transparent fire protection medium is included between the spaced glass panes.<br><br>
6 For example a fire proof gel or any other suitable transparent fire protection medium can be used as fire protection medium.   Depending on the fire rating class, it is however also possible to abandon the fire protection medium.<br>
Furthermore according to the inventive idea, it is possible to include, between both spaced exterior glass panes by means of corresponding spacers, a fire protection glass pane of the known type. To make the frame profiles, which are placed between the glass panes, invisible, the glass panes are provided with an enamelling on the interior side in the region where the profiles are placed. By doing so, the aspect of increased safety is respected, and the complete fire proof door is realised as transparent construction unit.<br>
Simultaneously,  due to the fact that no profiles are visible,  the complete appearance of said architectural structures as "structural glazing" is realised.<br>
The profiles are preferably executed as solid profiles and can be manufactured from metal, plastic, steel or wood. In case of fire proof door in plastic execution, a glass fiber reinforced plastic is preferably used. The plastic is composed such that endless glass fiber rovings oriented in axial direction are used in the plastic profiles. Simultaneously in radial direction, the profiles are reinforced with a glass fiber complex. These glass fibers are impregnated with a resin matrix and hardened within a heated mould. The resin matrix moreover includes fireretarding fillers. Simultaneously appropriate fittings are incorporated within the<br><br>
7 profiles, likewise at the same time invisible for the observer.   In order that such door  corresponds  to  fire  protection   requirements,   so-called  fire  protection laminates in the form of tapes are either incorporated into the profiles or they are also included within the door frame surrounding the fire proof door. Therefore, in the event of a fire,  under the effect of heat development, the tapes will intumesce, which action simultaneously guarantees a tight barrier with regard to the source of the fire. According to the invention, such fire proof door is suitable for  retrofitting.     For this  purpose,   an  existing jamb will  be  capped  with corresponding fire resisting material, for example with gypsum plasterboards or likewise with corresponding additional profiles, which are executed such that two identical profiles are placed against each other over an existing jamb, and they are interconnected by means of an appropriate element, which may act at the same time as a fire protection laminate.<br>
Such designed fire proof dbors can also be executed as skylight above the door frame, and likewise as fixed side panels. Such execution of complete fire proof walls addresses the idea to create a de-materialised fire proof wall.<br>
The proposed fire proof door can be manufactured as single action door (swing door) with a rebate, or as center-pivoted door. Besides the execution with a single leaf, or a double leaf execution with an inactive and an active leaf is possible.<br><br>
8 In case of an execution as single action door, one of the two spaced glass panes is larger than the other one, and a connection between them is guaranteed by means of a gradual profile.<br>
Hereinafter, the invention is explained on the basis of different diagrammatically represented embodiment examples. In the accompanying drawings :<br>
Figure 1 shows a view of a single leaf fire proof door;<br>
Figure 2 shows a vertical section through a fire proof door according to Figure 1 ;<br>
Figure 3 shows a fire proof door in a vertical section according to Figure 1 ;<br>
Figure 4 shows a fire proof door according to Figure 1 represented as horizontal<br>
section with capped jamb ;<br>
Figure 5 shows like Figure 1, a horizontal section with an existing door frame ;<br>
Figure 6 shows a horizontal section through a double leaf center pivoted door<br>
system where the door frame is executed with fire proof plates ; and<br>
Figure 7 shows a horizontal' section through a double leaf center pivoted door<br>
with capped frame.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates in a front view afire proof door with a door leaf 2 and with a door frame 31 surrounding the door leaf. Reference numeral 3 identifies an enamelling on the glass panes 4 and 5 stretching alongside the edges of the door leaf 2.   A vertical section of a single leaf door according to Figure 1 is<br><br>
9<br>
represented in Figure 2.   As here it is only question of the fire proof door's technical structure, all non-relevant parts have been omitted.<br>
The door leaf 2 is composed as structural glazing, that means the door leaf 2 includes two glass panes 4 and 5, they are building quasi the entire door leaf.  In the upper part, the glass panes 4 and 5 are spaced apart by means of a profile 6 and in the lower part, close to a floor 24, they are spaced apart by means of a profile 7. As it is evident from the illustration in Figure 2, the glass panes 4 and 5 extend with their glass pane edges 10 over the entire height and thus over the entire width of the door leaf 2, and they are simultaneously secured by means of profile  projections  11   provided  at the profile 6,  and  by means of profile projections 28 provided at the profile 7. Therefore, in this embodiment example, the glass pane edges 10 are provided with a small chamfer, which is covered at the same time by profile lips. These provide an optimum protection, especially in the region of the edges, for the glass panes 4 and 5, which are preferably manufactured from safety glass (single layer safety glass, ESG). The profile 6 is executed as solid profile and is, likewise the profile 7, preferably manufactured from light metal, plastic or wood or from any other appropriate material. In this case, the profile 6 presents in its exterior closing region an exterior edge 14 with a rounded (ball-shaped) form.  On the air gap 30 side, between the glass panes<br>
4	and 5, the profile 6 is executed with a deepening 12 arranged between<br>
projections 13 on either side, which provide a locating for the glass panes 4 and<br>
5	and thus for the connection of the glass panes 4 and 5 with the profile 6.<br><br>
10<br>
Oriented towards the space between the glass pianes 4 and 5, the profile 7 has got the same cross section as the profile 6. However, in the exterior region of the door lea-2 in further continuation of the profile projection 26, legs 15 are conformed pointing towards the floor 24. In their center, the legs 15 include a deepening 16. The deepening 16 is provided to mount for example door rails to connect a door closer or to connect other fittings. The legs 15 are provided to adapt the prefabricated fire proof door on site to the required dimension. By correspondingly cutting the legs 15, the optimum length will be achieved for such fire proof door type without dismounting the door leaf on site.<br>
An enamelling 3 is provided on the glass panes 4 and 5, in the connection region between the profiles 7 and 6, whereby said profiles 6 also run vertically. By doing so, it is guaranteed that the profiles 6 and 7, installed within the air gap 30, are not visible to the exterior side. As only the exterior edge zone is concerned, despite the enamelling 3, the entire door leafs 2 appearance is not damaged in a completely de-materialised wall manufactured only from glass, as frame parts and moreover fittings are invisible. Simultaneously it is guaranteed that the glass panes 4 and 5 are not executed with boreholes, to ensure an increased fire protection.<br>
The air gap 30 is partially filled by a fire proof glass pane 9. The fire proof glass pane 9 is supported by means of spacers 8, leaning on the glass panes 4 and 5. The ends of the fire proof glass pane 9 engage in this case into the deepenings<br><br>
11<br>
12, such that if the fire proof glass pane and the profiles 6 and 7 expand, a destruction of the fire proof glass pane 9 will not occur.<br>
The upper part of Figure 2 illustrates a door frame 31, which is mounted on an existing jamb identified by numeral 18 and which is installed within the mortar 23 over masonry 17. In this case, the door frame 31 is realised from two almost L-shaped additional profiles 19.   On the one end, at the mortar 23, a sealing 21 seals the profile 19, whereby in the center region of the door leaf 2, a gap remains between the additional profiles 19. This gap is closed by means of a fire protection laminate in the form of a sealing profile 22. The additional profile 19 is simultaneously sealed and fastened in this zone with regard to the existing jamb 18 by means of a sealing 20.   In the event of a fire, an automatic sealing of the door frame 31 with respect to the door leaf 2 would be achieved thanks to the intumescence of the fire protection laminate 22.<br>
In another embodiment example, in Figure 3, the fire protection effect of the door leaf 2 is realised in another way. Instead of proceeding like in Figure 2 and using a fire proof glass pane 9, in this case a fire protection material 26 is employed, which is preferably transparent and liquid. To introduce the fire protection material 26 into the door leaf, spacer sections 25 are incorporated with a certain distance 29 into the air gap 30, whereby they immerse simultaneously into the deepenings 12. As shown in Figure 3, the spacer section 25 is executed as double-wall spacer section in order to compensate corresponding expansion<br><br>
12 coefficients of the fire protection material 26. The structure of this door, and likewise of the one displayed in Figure 2, clearly reveals that the observer does not recognise this door-type, constructed according to the principle of de-materialised door leafs, from the outside as a fire proof door and that nevertheless, in the event of a fire this door type guarantees sufficient and corresponding protection within a fire protection partition.<br>
Due to the fact, that the deepening 12 situated within the frame is provided in the profiles 6 and 7, an increased safety potential is given, as in the event of a fire, for example the fire protection material represented in Figure 3 will stiffen and will persist as plane material, thanks to the profiles 6, 7 blocked on the exterior side in the door frame 31, even if one of the two glass panes 4, 5 should burst. This is likewise applicable to the fire protection glass pane 9 of Figure 2.<br>
A center-pivoted door, which can be realised without any problem for example from profiles 6 in conjunction with a fire proof glass pane 9, is illustrated in Figure 4. In a horizontal section, the center-pivoted door 32 is arranged inside the additional profiles 19 of the door frame 31. Here again, it is evident that in the event of an outbreak of fire and an increase in temperature, the sealing profile 22 seals the center-pivoted door 32 with respect to the door frame 31.<br>
In an application where the center pivoted door 32  is installed  inside an appropriate fire resistant jamb 18, sealing profiles 1, in the form of fire protection<br><br>
13<br>
laminates, are incorporated into the exterior edges 14 of the profiles 6 oriented towards the jamb 18.<br>
Figure 6 represents a double leaf center-pivoted door 32 including two leaves, located between a door frame made from gypsum plasterboards 27 mounted on a sub-structure 33. in this case again, the center-pivoted doors 32 are executed with sealing profiles 1 in the zone of the door frame as well as in the central region. Figure 7 illustrates an example analogous to Figure 6, whereby in this case fire protection laminates are only included in the central region in the profiles 6 and in the region of the capped jamb 18 between the additional profiles 19, the sealing profile 22 provides proper sealing in the event of a fire.<br>
The description clearly reveals that said designed fire proof door absolutely conforms to its final purpose and simultaneously provides a free view which is usually not the case with a fire proof door made from steel or sheet metal. References<br>
