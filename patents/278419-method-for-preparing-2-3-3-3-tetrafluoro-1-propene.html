PROCESS FOR PREPARING 2,3,3,3-TETRAFLUORO-1-PROPENE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing fluorine compounds, namely the<br>
fluorine compound 1234yf.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) and in particular hydrofluoroolefins such as 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-<br>
1-propene (HFO 1234yf) are compounds that are known for their properties as refrigerants and<br>
heat exchangers, extinguishers, propellants, foaming agents, swelling agents, dielectric gases,<br>
polymerization or monomer medium, support fluids, abrasive agents, drying agents and fluids for<br>
power production units. Unlike CSCs and HCFCs, which are potentially hazardous to the ozone<br>
layer, HFOs do not contain chlorine and therefore pose no problem to the ozone layer.<br>
Several processes for manufacturing 1234yf are known.<br>
WO 2008/002 499 describes a process for producing a mixture of 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-<br>
propene (HFO 1234yf) and 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene (HFO 1234ze) by pyrolysis of 1,1,1,2,3-<br>
pentafluoropropane (HFC 245eb).<br>
WO 2008/002 500 describes a process for producing a mixture of 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-<br>
propene (HFO 1234yf) and 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene (HFO 1234ze) via catalytic conversion<br>
of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC 245eb) on a dehydrofluorination catalyst.<br>
These two abovementioned patent applications are thus directed toward the production of a<br>
mixture containing a substantial portion of the the product 1234ze.<br>
WO 2007/056 194 describes the preparation of 1234yf by dehydrofluorination of 245eb,<br>
especially on a catalyst based on nickel, carbon or a combination of the two.<br>
The document Knunyants et al., Journal of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Chemistry<br>
Department, "Reactions of fluoro-olefins", report 13., "Catalytic hydrogenation of perfluoro-<br>
oiefins", I960, distinctly describes various chemical reactions on fluorine compounds. Said<br>
document describes the substantially quantitative hydrogenation of HFP on a platinum-<br>
supported palladium-based catalyst, the temperature rising from 20°C to 50°C, and then being<br>
maintained at this value. Said document describes the dehydrofluorination of 1.1,1,2,3,3-<br>
hexafluoropropane (236ea) via passage through a suspension of KOH, to produce 1,2,3,3,3-<br>
pentafluoro-1-propene (1225ye). Said document describes the hydrogenation of 1,2,3,3,3-<br>
pentafluoro-1-propene (1225ye) to 1,1,1,2,3-pentafIuoropropane (245eb) on an alumina-<br>
supported palladium catalyst. During this hydrogenation, a hydrogenolysis reaction also takes<br>
place, a significant amount of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane being produced. Said document<br>
describes the dehydrofluorination of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafIuoropropane (245eb) to 2,3,3,3-<br>
tetrafluoro-1-propene (HFO 1234yf) via passage through a suspension of KOH. These<br>
 <br>
reactions are described independently of each other, although it is indicated that it is possible<br>
to combine them to synthesize a range of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene derivatives<br>
containing variable amounts of fluorine.<br>
Document US-P-5 396 000 describes the preparation of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane by<br>
catalytic dehydrofluorination of 1,1.1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane (236ea) to 1,2,3,3,3-<br>
pentafluoro-1-propene (1225ye), followed by hydrogenation to produce the desired<br>
compound. The dehydrohalogenation of 236ea to 1225ye is performed in the gas phase, the<br>
reaction product being, in one example, sent directly to the next reactor in which the<br>
hydrogenation of the compound 1225ye to the compound 245eb takes place. It is also<br>
indicated in that document that the compound 236ea may be obtained by hydrogenation of<br>
hexafluoropropylene (HFP), making reference to the abovementioned Knunyants et al.<br>
document.<br>
Document US-P-5 679 875 describes the preparation of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane by<br>
catalytic dehydrofluorination of 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane (236ea) to 1,2,3,3,3-<br>
pentafluoro-1-propene (1225ye), followed by a hydrogenation to produce the desired<br>
compound. The reactions are performed in the gas phase. It is also indicated in that document<br>
that the compound 236ea may be obtained by hydrogenation of hexafluoropropylene (HFP),<br>
making reference, inter alia, to the abovementioned Knunyants et al. document.<br>
There is a need for a process for preparing 1234yf from a readily accessible starting<br>
material, and which leads to the desired product in high selectivity, and, advantageously, in<br>
high yield.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention thus provides a continuous gas-phase process for preparing 2,3,3,3-<br>
tetrafluoro-1-propene, comprising the following steps:<br>
(i)	hydrogenation of hexafluoropropylene to 1,1,1,2,3,3-<br>
hexafluoropropane;<br>
(ii)	dehydrofluorination of the 1,1,1,2,3.3-hexafluoropropane obtained<br>
in the preceding step to 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-propene;<br>
(iii)	hydrogenation of the 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-propene obtained in<br>
the preceding step to 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane;<br>
(iv)	dehydrofluorination of the 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane obtained in<br>
the preceding step to 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene.<br>
According to certain embodiments:<br>
the hydrogen is introduced during step (i) and/or step (iii) in a stoichiometric<br>
mole ratio.<br>
step (ii) is performed in the presence of hydrogen, preferably with an<br>
HVproduct to be reacted mole ratio of between 0.3 and 30, especially between 0.5 and 20 and<br>
advantageously between 1 and 10, and step (iv) is performed in the absence of hydrogen.<br>
step (ii) is performed in the presence of hydrogen, preferably with an<br>
 <br>
H2/product to be reacted mole ratio of between 0.3 and 30, especially between 0.5 and 20<br>
and advantageously between 1 and 10, and step (iv) is performed in the presence of<br>
hydrogen, preferably with an H2/product to be reacted mole ratio of between 0.3 and 30,<br>
especially between 0.5 and 20 and advantageously between 1 and 10.<br>
the total amount of hydrogen is introduced during step (i).<br>
the H2/hexafluoropropylene mole ratio is between 2.3 and 30 and<br>
advantageously between 3 and 20.<br>
the H2/hexafluoropropylene mole ratio is about 2.<br>
the 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane that has not reacted during step (ii) is<br>
separated out after step (ii) or after step (iii), but before step (iv), and is optionally<br>
recycled into step (ii) and/or into step (i).<br>
the 1,1,1.2,3,3-hexafluoropropane that has not reacted during step (ii) is not<br>
separated out before steps (iii) and (iv), additional 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1 -propene is obtained<br>
during step (iv) from the unreacted 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane and this additional 1,2,3,3,3-<br>
pentafluoro-1-propene is then separated out and optionally recycled into step (iii) and/or<br>
optionally step (ii).<br>
the hydrogenation steps (i) and (iii) are performed in the same reactor,<br>
preferably with the same catalyst, a separation step optionally being present.<br>
the dehydrofluorination steps (ii) and (iv) are performed in the same<br>
reactor, preferably with the same catalyst, and in which the process also comprises a<br>
separation step for separating the products obtained from said reactor, especially as a<br>
fraction containing the 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene.<br>
the stream from step (ii) containing the 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-propene<br>
is sent directly without separation into step (iii) during which the hydrogenation is<br>
performed.<br>
steps (i). (ii) and (iii) are performed in the same reactor, on different catalyst<br>
beds.<br>
steps (i), (ii) and (iii) are performed in three reactors immediately in<br>
series without intermediate separation.<br>
after this step (iii), a separation is performed, and a stream of<br>
1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane and optionally of HF is recovered, and is recycled into the<br>
start of the process, and a stream of 1,1,1,2.3-pentafluoropropane and optionally of<br>
hydrogen, which are sent into step (iv), is recovered.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention uses four reactions in series, employed continuously, in the gas phase, the<br>
reaction products being sent into the next step, optionally after having undergone a treatment,<br>
for example of separation, if necessary.<br>
In the process, the reaction steps are performed continuously on streams in the gas<br>
phase. An economical process for preparing the compound 1234yf is thus obtained, the<br>
 <br>
starting material, HFP, being readily commercially available, at low cost.<br>
The hydrogenation steps are performed in a conventional manner for a person skilled in<br>
the art. A person skilled in the art may select the operating conditions so that the reactions are<br>
substantially quantitative.<br>
The catalysts that may be used in these reactions are those that are known for this<br>
purpose. Mention may be made especially of catalysts based on a group VIII metal or<br>
rhenium. This catalyst may be supported, for example on charcoal, alumina, aluminum<br>
fluoride, etc., or may not be supported, for instance Raney nickel. As metal, it is possible to<br>
use platinum or palladium, in particular palladium, advantageously supported on charcoal or<br>
alumina. This metal may also be combined with another metal, for instance silver, copper,<br>
gold, tellurium, zinc, chromium, molybdenum or thallium. These hydrogenation catalysts are<br>
known.<br>
The catalyst may be present in any suitable form, for example in the form of a fixed or<br>
fluidized bed, preferably as a fixed bed. The direction of flow may be downward or upward.<br>
The catalyst bed may also comprise a particular distribution of the catalyst so as to control the<br>
flows of heat generated by the exothermic reaction. Thus, it is possible to contemplate the use<br>
of among other charge density gradients, porosity gradients of the catalyst so as to control the<br>
exothermicity of the reaction. For example, it may be envisaged for the first part of the bed to<br>
comprise less catalyst, whereas the second part comprises more.<br>
Steps for regenerating the catalyst, in a known manner, may also be envisioned.<br>
It may also be envisioned to use a dilution gas such as nitrogen.<br>
The hydrogenation steps are exothermic. The reaction temperature may be controlled<br>
with the aid of means provided for this purpose in the reactor, if necessary. The temperature<br>
may vary by a few tens of degrees during the reaction, reaction (i) being more exothermic<br>
than reaction (iii). For example, the entry temperature may range from 20°C to 150°C, and the<br>
gain in temperature may range from 5°C to 100°C.<br>
The contact time (ratio between the volume of catalyst and the total charge flow) is<br>
generally between 0.1 and 100 seconds, preferably between 1 and 50 seconds and<br>
advantageously between 2 and 10 seconds.<br>
The amount of hydrogen injected may vary within a wide range. The Hi/charge ratio<br>
may vary within a wide range, especially between 1 (the stoichiometric amount) and 30,<br>
especially between 1.5 and 20 and advantageously between 3 and 10. A high ratio will lead to<br>
dilution, and thus to better management of the reaction exothermicity.<br>
The dehydrofluorination reactions are also performed in a conventional manner for a<br>
person skilled in the art.<br>
The dehydrofluorination reaction may be performed by passage through a basic<br>
solution, especially of KOH.<br>
The dehydrofluorination reaction is preferably performed with a dehydrofluorination<br>
catalyst. This catalyst is, for example, a catalyst based on a metal, especially a transition metal<br>
 <br>
or an oxide, halide or oxyhalide derivative of such a metal. Catalysts are, for example, FeCl3.<br>
chromium oxyfluoride, Ni (including Ni mesh lattices). NiCl2, CrF3, and mixtures thereof. Other<br>
possible catalysts are catalysts supported on charcoal, antimony-based catalysts, aluminum-based<br>
catalysts (such as A1F3 and Al2O3 and aluminum oxyfluoride and fluorinated alumina), palladium,<br>
platinum, rhodium and ruthenium. Reference may be made to the list given in document US-P-<br>
5 396 000, column 1, line 50 to column 2, line 2 or to the list given in WO 2007/056 194, page 16.<br>
lines 13-23.<br>
According to one variant, a mixed catalyst is used.<br>
This catalyst contains both chromium and nickel. The Cr:Ni mole ratio, relative to the<br>
metallic element, is generally between 0.5 and 5, for example between 0.7 and 2, and especially in<br>
the region of 1. The catalyst may contain, on a weight basis, from 0.5% to 20% of chromium and<br>
from 0.5% to 20% of nickel, and preferably between 2% and 10% of each of the metals.<br>
The metal may be present in metallic form or in the form of derivatives, especially oxide,<br>
halide or oxyhalide, these derivatives, especially halide and oxyhalide, being obtained via<br>
activation of the catalytic metal. Although activation of the metal is not necessary, it is preferred.<br>
The support is based on aluminum. Several possible supports may be mentioned, for<br>
instance alumina, activated alumina or aluminum derivatives. These aluminum derivatives are<br>
especially aluminum halides or oxyhalides, described, for example, in US-P-4 902 838, or<br>
obtained via the activation process described below.<br>
The catalyst may comprise the chromium and nickel in unactivated form or in activated<br>
form, on a support that has also undergone the activation of the metal, or otherwise.<br>
The catalyst may be prepared from alumina (in general an "activated" alumina; this<br>
activated alumina is an alumina of high porosity, and is different than the alumina that has<br>
undergone the metal activation treatment). In a first step, the alumina is transformed into<br>
aluminum fluoride or into a mixture of aluminum fluoride and alumina, by fluorination using air<br>
and hydrofluoric acid, the degree of conversion of the alumina into aluminum fluoride depending<br>
essentially on the temperature at which the fluorination of the alumina is performed (in general<br>
between 200°C and 450°C and preferably between 250°C and 400°C). The support is then<br>
impregnated using aqueous solutions of chromium and nickel salts or using aqueous solutions of<br>
chromic acid, nickel salt and methanol (serving as chromium-reducing agent). The chromium and<br>
nickel salts that may be used include the chlorides, or other salts, for instance the oxalates,<br>
formates, acetates, nitrates and sulfates or nickel dichromate, provided that these salts are soluble<br>
in the amount of water that may be absorbed by the support. The catalyst may also be prepared via<br>
direct impregnation of alumina (which in general is activated) with the aid of solutions of the<br>
chromium and nickel compounds mentioned above. In this case, the conversion of at least part<br>
(for example 70% or more) of the alumina into aluminum fluoride or aluminum oxyfluoride is<br>
performed during the step of activation of the metal of the catalyst.<br>
The activated aluminas that may be used for the preparation of the catalyst are well-known<br>
commercially available products. They are generally prepared by calcination of alumina hydrates<br>
 <br>
(aluminum hydroxides) at a temperature of between 300°C and 800°C. The aluminas (activated or<br>
unactivated) may contain large amounts (up to 1000 ppm) of sodium, without this harming the<br>
catalytic performance.<br>
Preferably, but without this being necessary, the catalyst is conditioned or activated, i.e.<br>
converted into constituents that are active and stable (under the reaction conditions), via a<br>
preliminary "activation" operation. This treatment may be performed either "in situ" (in the<br>
dehydrofluorination reactor) or in suitable apparatus designed to withstand the activation<br>
conditions.<br>
This activation step generally comprises the following steps:<br>
A drying step. This drying step is performed at high temperature (250°C to 450°C<br>
and preferably 300°C to 350°C) in general under a stream of nitrogen or air. This step may be<br>
optionally preceded in a first stage by a first step of drying at low temperature (100°C to<br>
150°C and preferably 110°C to 120°C) in the presence of air or nitrogen. The duration of the<br>
drying step may be between 10 and 50 hours.<br>
A fluorination step. This fluorination step is performed at low temperature (180°C to<br>
350°C) using a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and nitrogen, while controlling the HF content so that<br>
the temperature does not exceed 350°C. The duration of the fluorination step may be between 10<br>
and 50 hours.<br>
Optionally, a finishing step under a stream of pure hydrofluoric acid or<br>
hydrofluoric acid diluted with nitrogen, at a temperature that may be up to 450°C. The<br>
duration of the finishing step may be between 2 and 15 hours.<br>
During this operation, the catalytic precursors (for example nickel and chromium<br>
halides, nickel chromate or dichromate, chromium oxide) are converted into the<br>
corresponding fluorides and/or oxyfluorides, which results in a release of water and/or of<br>
hydrochloric acid. Chemical analysis of the elements (chromium, nickel, fluorine, aluminum,<br>
oxygen), after this activation, makes it possible to confirm the mineral composition of the<br>
catalyst.<br>
Such a catalyst is described in EP-A-486 333, in particular on page 3, lines 11-48.<br>
Examples 1A, 2A and 4A, to which passages reference is made.<br>
The dehydrofluorination steps are performed at temperatures that may be between<br>
150°C and 600°C, preferably between 300 and 500°C and advantageously between 300 and<br>
450°C, especially between 300 and 400°C.<br>
The contact time (ratio between the volume of catalyst and the total charge flow) is<br>
generally between 0.1 and 100 seconds, preferably between 1 and 50 seconds and<br>
advantageously between 2 and 20 seconds in the case of the reaction leading to 1234yf, and<br>
between 5 and 40 seconds in the case of the reaction leading to 1225ye.<br>
A diluent gas (nitrogen, helium or argon) may be used in the reaction. The pressure in<br>
the various reactions may be atmospheric, or lower or higher than this atmospheric pressure.<br>
The pressure may vary from one reaction to another, where appropriate.<br>
 <br>
The reactions are performed in one or more reactors devoted to reactions involving<br>
halogens. Such reactors are known to those skilled in the art, and may comprise linings based,<br>
for example, on Hastelloy®, Inconel®, Monel® or fluoropolymers. The reactor may also<br>
comprise heat-exchange means, if necessary.<br>
In the case where hydrogen is used in excess in the hydrogenation step prior to the<br>
dehydrofluorination step, hydrogen will be present during the dehydrofluorination. It may also<br>
be envisioned to inject hydrogen into this step (ii), without, however, this hydrogen<br>
originating from step (i). The HVdehydrofluorination charge ratio may vary within a wide<br>
range, especially between 0.3 and 30, especially between 0.5 and 20 and advantageously<br>
between 1 and 10.<br>
This presence of hydrogen makes it possible to obtain greater selectivity toward the<br>
desired product; preferably more stable selectivity over time. Similarly, the formation of<br>
heavy fractions is preferably reduced. In the presence of hydrogen, the selectivity is very high<br>
toward the desired product. 1225ye or 1234yf, this selectivity preferably being stable over<br>
time.<br>
Specifically, for the two dehydrofluorination reactions, the starting material may be<br>
represented by formula (I). CF3-CHF-CHFX, in which X is hydrogen or fluorine. Thus, the<br>
starting material may correspond to formula (Ia) CF3-CHF-CHF2 (F236ea) or to formula (Ib)<br>
CF3-CHF-CH2F (F245eb). In these two cases, the removal of HF in formula I may lead to two<br>
products, the first of formula (II) CF3-CF=CHX and the second of formula (III) CF3-CH=CFX.<br>
depending on the fluorine that is removed. There is thus a selectivity problem during the<br>
removal of HF from the molecule of the product of formula (I). Such a selectivity problem does<br>
not arise if the starting material does not contain fluorine on the terminal carbon intended to<br>
bear the double bond, as, for example, F245cb, which can lead only to 1234yf by removal of<br>
HF.<br>
When the starting material is the product of formula (Ia) (236ea), the desired product<br>
corresponds to formula (IIa), i.e. CF3-CF=CHF (1225ye). whereas the undesired product<br>
corresponds to formula (IIIa), the i.e. CF3-CH=CF2 (1225zc).<br>
When the starting material is the product of formula (Ib) (245eb), the desired product<br>
corresponds to formula (IIb), i.e. CF3-CF=CH2 (1234yf), whereas the undesired product<br>
corresponds to formula (IIIb), i.e. CF3-CH=CHF (1234ze).<br>
The selectivity toward product of formula (II), whether it is (IIa) or (IIb), is very high,<br>
greater than 90%, preferably greater than 95% and even advantageously greater than or equal<br>
to 98%.<br>
The conversion is also very high. Advantageously, the conversion is stable over time.<br>
The reagents are generally fed in continuously, or may be fed in stages, where<br>
appropriate. The points for the possible separation and/or recycling operations are variable, at<br>
the start of the process or at intermediate levels.<br>
According to one embodiment, hydrogen is present during the dehydrofluorination step (ii).<br>
 <br>
This hydrogen may be injected during this step, or may originate from an excess of hydrogen<br>
used in the first step, which is not separated out before step (ii). According to one<br>
embodiment, hydrogen is introduced in excess into the first reaction, and it is kept during the<br>
first dehydrohalogenation step (ii) and optionally up to the final step (iv) which corresponds to<br>
the second dehydrofluorination; this step (iv) may also be performed in the absence of<br>
hydrogen. For example, the total amount of hydrogen used in the process is introduced during<br>
step (i), the H2/hexafluoropropylene mole ratio being between 2.3 and 30 and advantageously<br>
between 3 and 20. In such a case, and on the basis of the low value of the mole ratio of 2.3<br>
mol of hydrogen per one mole of HFP, 1.3 mol of hydrogen remains during the first<br>
dehydrofluorination step (which promotes the selectivity, advantageously stably over time)<br>
and the H2/pentafluoropropylene ratio is then 1.3 (accepting that the conversion and the<br>
selectivity of the first dehydrofluorination step is quantitative). One mole of hydrogen is<br>
consumed during the hydrogenation reaction toward 245eb, and 0.3 mol of hydrogen thus<br>
remains for the second dehydrofluorination step (which again promotes the selectivity). It is<br>
also possible for the amount of hydrogen to be such that it is in a mole ratio of about 2, such<br>
that all the hydrogen is consumed and that the last reaction (iv) is performed in the absence of<br>
hydrogen (if step (ii) is quantitative).<br>
The hydrogen mole ratios are expressed on the basis of quantitative reactions (especially for<br>
the dehydrohalogenation reactions and in particular reaction (ii); the hydrogen mole ratios are<br>
recalculated as a function of the conversion and the selectivity toward the desired product).<br>
The hydrogen may also be introduced in stages, additional hydrogen being introduced<br>
before the second hydrogenation or before each dehydrofluorination step if it is desired for these<br>
steps to be performed in the presence of hydrogen. Thus, the first hydrogenation step may be<br>
performed with an H2/hexafluoropropylene mole ratio of 1.5, and the remaining excess hydrogen<br>
(about 0.5 mol of hydrogen per one mole of HFP) is kept in step (ii) of the first<br>
dehydrofluorination. Before this step or immediately after this step, it is possible to add hydrogen<br>
in order for the ratio H2:1225ye to be at least equal to 1 and advantageously greater than 1 (in<br>
order for the final dehydrofluorination step (iv) to be performed in the presence of hydrogen to<br>
improve the selectivity). Hydrogen may also be added to the reaction medium before each step, if<br>
desired. It is possible for the dehydrofluorination step (ii) to be performed in the presence of<br>
hydrogen, whereas the final step (iv) is not performed in the presence of hydrogen.<br>
The hydrogen that has not been consumed in one or more steps is advantageously<br>
separated out and recycled into the process, advantageously into the start of the process.<br>
The hydrogenation reactions are preferably substantially quantitative. The dehydro-<br>
fluorination reactions are not necessarily always quantitative; in particular, reaction (ii) for formation<br>
of 1225ye is not necessarily quantitative, and unreacted 236ea may remain.<br>
Thus the unreacted compound 236ea may be separated out, either after step (ii) or after<br>
step (iii) (but before step (iv)). Advantageously, the separation takes place after step (iii). the<br>
boiling points of 236ea and of 245eb being, respectively, 6°C and 22.7°C. and thus having a<br>
 <br>
difference of more than 15°C. The separation may take place at these two moments since the<br>
hydrogenation reaction (iii) does not substantially affect 236ea. This 236ea separated out may-<br>
be recycled into the process. It may be recycled into step (ii) during which it reacts. It may also<br>
be recycled into the start of the process, in step (i), and serve as diluent during this step. The<br>
diluent action of 236ea makes it possible to control the exothermicity of the first hydrogenation<br>
reaction.<br>
This unreacted compound 236ea may also not be separated out and may remain in the<br>
process, especially up to step (iv). During this dehydrofluorination step (iv), additional 1,2,3,3,3-<br>
pentafluoro-1-propene (1225ye) will then be formed from the unreacted 236ea. The two<br>
compounds 1225ye and 1234yf may then be separated and 1225ye recycled. The boiling points of<br>
the two fluoroolefins are, admittedly, similar, but it is possible to achieve separation of these two<br>
compounds. The recycling may be performed into step (ii) and/or into step (iii). This 1225ye will<br>
be quantitatively converted during the hydrogenation reaction of step (iii), which is substantially<br>
quantitative.<br>
It is thus possible to control the product flows in the process according to the invention<br>
as a function of the possible separation needs. The HF that is formed may be separated out<br>
after each dehydrofluorination reaction, either between these two reactions, or only at the end<br>
of the process. The HF may be separated out by washing or by distillation. The azeotropes<br>
that may be formed with HF may also be separated out after the step during which they are<br>
formed, or after a subsequent step or at the end of the process. These separation steps are thus<br>
placed in the process as a function of the various needs. It is also possible to envision<br>
recycling of only certain separated compounds (for example the unreacted 236ea), whereas<br>
the other separated components are sent toward other processes.<br>
Advantageously, the 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-propene (1225ye) is not separated out,<br>
which avoids the handling of this toxic product. It is possible to send the stream from step (ii)<br>
directly into the following step.<br>
For example, the process may be one in which steps (i), (ii) and (iii) are performed in<br>
the same reactor, on different catalyst beds. Advantageously, in this case, after step (iii). a<br>
separation and optional removal of HF is performed, a stream of 1,1,1,2,3,3-<br>
hexafluoropropane is recovered, which is recycled into the start of the process, and a stream<br>
of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane and optionally (but preferably) of hydrogen is recovered and<br>
sent into step (iv). The 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-propene (1225ye) is not separated out since it<br>
is converted in the reactor into 245eb, which avoids the handling of this toxic product 1225ye.<br>
Three reactors directly in series may also be envisioned, the stream leaving one reactor being<br>
sent directly into the next reactor without separation.<br>
In the case targeted above of a single reactor, the reactor may contain three different<br>
catalytic species, with different functions. The hydrogenation of the HFP is performed on a<br>
first catalytic bed (total conversion and virtually 100% selectivity). The 236ea and the excess<br>
hydrogen then pass through a second catalytic bed, at a suitable temperature (the heating may<br>
 <br>
be electric, for example). The reaction products are then 1225ye, HF, excess hydrogen and<br>
possibly unreacted 236ea. These are then sent through a third catalytic bed in which a<br>
hydrogenation takes place (total conversion and virtually 100% selectivity).<br>
In the above cases of a single reactor or of three reactors immediately in series, an outlet<br>
stream is then obtained containing 245eb, possibly excess hydrogen, HF possibly with azeotropes,<br>
and possibly the unreacted 236ea present before the hydrogenation step. The hydrogen is<br>
separated out, and is recycled into the top of the reactor (or into another level in the process) and<br>
the 236ea is separated from the 245eb. The 236ea may also be recycled into the reactor inlet. The<br>
HF and optionally the azeotropes are also separated out (optionally partly by washing).<br>
It is also possible in the process to envisage that the hydrogenation steps (i) and (iii) be<br>
performed in the same reactor, preferably with the same catalyst, and/or that the<br>
dehydrofluorination steps (ii) and (iv) be performed in the same reactor, preferably with the same<br>
catalyst. WO 2007/117 391 describes the co-dehydrofluorination of 236ea and of 245eb to<br>
produce a mixture of I225ze and 1234yf. These 2 compounds are not separated after that process.<br>
The co-hydrogenation is performed in a first reactor, the outlet stream of which contains<br>
236ea and 245eb. The outlet stream may be separated, and the 236ea is sent into a first<br>
dehydrofiuorination reactor, whereas the 245eb is sent into a second dehydrofiuorination<br>
reactor. The outlet stream from the first dehydrofiuorination reactor predominantly contains<br>
1225ye and possibly unreacted 236ea. The outlet stream from the first dehydrofiuorination<br>
reactor may be sent to the hydrogenation reactor, thus producing compound 245eb from this<br>
1225ye. The 236ea optionally separated out may be recycled into the top of this<br>
dehydrofiuorination reactor.<br>
The process may also be performed by sending the outlet stream from the hydrogenation<br>
reactor (containing 245eb and 236ea) or the combination of the two streams from the two<br>
hydrogenation reactors may be sent directly into a single dehydrofiuorination reactor. The stream<br>
from this dehydrofiuorination reactor contains 1234yf, but also unreacted 236ea and 1225ye<br>
resulting from the dehydrofiuorination of 236ea. This stream is separated and the 1234yf, 1225ye<br>
and 236ea are recovered. As indicated above, the two fluoroolefins may be separated. It is<br>
possible for the 236ea to be recycled into the top of the dehydrofiuorination reactor, whereas the<br>
stream of 1225ye is recycled into the top of the hydrogenation reactor. It is also possible to<br>
recycle these two compounds into the top of the hydrogenation reactor(s).<br>
It will be recalled that:<br>
the degree of conversion is the percentage of starting material that has reacted<br>
(number of moles of reacted starting material/number of moles of starting material<br>
introduced);<br>
the selectivity toward the desired product is the ratio of the number of moles of<br>
desired product formed/number of moles of starting material that has reacted;<br>
the yield of desired product is the ratio of the number of moles of desired product<br>
formed/number of moles of starting material introduced, the yield of desired product also<br>
 <br>
possibly being defined as the product of the conversion and of the selectivity.<br>
the contact time is the inverse of the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV)<br>
the space velocity is the ratio between the total volume throughput of the gaseous<br>
stream to the volume of the catalytic bed. under normal temperature and pressure<br>
conditions.<br>
the productivity is expressed as mass of desired product obtained per unit time and<br>
per unit of catalyst (mass or volume); this productivity is linked to the contact time.<br>

 <br>
These two solutions are introduced simultaneously at a temperature of 40°C at<br>
 <br>
atmospheric pressure and over about 2 hours onto the support with stirring. After a maturation<br>
step under nitrogen, the catalyst is dried under nitrogen, and then under vacuum at 65°C, and<br>
then at about 90°C for 6 hours.<br>
500 g of impregnated solid are placed in an Inconel tubular reactor. The catalyst is first<br>
dried under a stream of nitrogen at low temperature and then up to 320°C, at atmospheric<br>
pressure. It is then fluorinated in the presence of a hydrofluoric acid/nitrogen mixture (volume<br>
concentration of 5% to 10% of this acid in nitrogen) at 320°C and then up to 390°C. The HF<br>
feed is then stopped. Flushing with nitrogen is continued for 15 minutes at 390°C and the<br>
catalyst is then cooled to 60°C under a stream of nitrogen.<br>
The characteristics of the catalyst after activation are as follows:<br>
BET surface area	: 40 m2/g<br>
pore volume	: 0.4 cm3/g<br>
