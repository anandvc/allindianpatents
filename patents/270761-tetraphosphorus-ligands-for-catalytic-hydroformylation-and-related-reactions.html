				<td>TETRAPHOSPHORUS LIGANDS FOR CATALYTIC HYDROFORMYLATION<br>
AND RELATED REACTIONS<br>
Cross Reference to Related Application<br>
[001] This application claims the benefit of priority of Provisional Application No.<br>
60/750,733 filed December 15, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[002] The present invention relates to new phosphorous ligands and their<br>
applications in hydroformylation and related reactions. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to transition metal complexes having chelating tetraphosphorus ligands with<br>
multichelating modes. Tetraphosphorus ligands with multichelating modes can enhance<br>
coordinating abilities for transition metals such as Rh and Ni, and thus enhance selectivities<br>
of catalytic reactions. The transition metal-tetraphosphorus complexes according to the<br>
present invention are useful as catalysts in hydroformylation, isomerization-<br>
hydroformylation, hydrocarboxylation, hydrocyanation, tandem reactions such as<br>
isomerization-formylation, and hydroaminomethylation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[003] Hydroformylation, discovered by Roelen in 1938, has been the largest<br>
homogeneous catalytic process in industry. More than 15 billion pounds of aldehydes and<br>
alcohols per year have been produced based on Fe, Zn, Mn, Co, Cu, Ag, Ni, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru<br>
and Ir based catalysts. In these processes, achieving high selectivity to linear products is<br>
extremely important for commercial application. Despite the extensive investigation by both<br>
academic and industrial groups such as BASF, Dow, Shell and Eastman, among others, there<br>
still remain fundamental and practical problems regarding selectivity. New concepts for<br>
controlling selectivities are very important in catalytic reactions. Highly efficient selective<br>
catalysts will allow some bulky chemicals to be produced in an environmentally sound<br>
manner under milder conditions.<br>
[004] Cobalt catalysts (e.g., HCo(CO)4) dominated industrial hydroformylation until<br>
rhodium catalysts (e.g., HRh(CO)2(PPh3)3 ) were introduced in earlier 1970's. In 2004, it is<br><br>
estimated that approximately 75% of all hydroformylation processes were based on rhodium<br>
triarylphosphine catalysts. Achieving high regioselectivity to linear aldehydes is critical for<br>
hydroformylation and related reactions. The resulting aldehydes are converted to alcohols,<br>
carboxylic acids or other derivatives, which are used as plasticizers, detergents, surfactants,<br>
solvents, lubricants and chemical intermediates.<br>
[005] Scheme 1 below shows the dissociation of a Rh catalyzed hydroformylation<br>
catalyst.<br><br>
[006] The successful commercialization of HRh(CO)(PPh3)2 technology has been<br>
based on the key discovery of Pruett at Union Carbide and Booth at Union oil that the use of<br>
rhodium with excess phosphine ligand can lead to forming active, selective hydroformylation<br>
catalysts. The need for excess phosphines is due to the facile Rh-PPh3 dissociation in the<br>
catalytic system as illustrated by Scheme 1. Loss of PPh3 from HRh(CO)(PPh3)2 results in<br>
more active, but less regioselective hydroformylation catalysts B and C. In the commercial<br>
process, up to an 820 fold excess of PPh3 to Rh is used to assure high lineanbranch selectivity<br>
ratio, i.e., up to 17:1, for the hydroformylation of 1-hexene. Commercial hydroformylation<br>
of propylene has been run with a 400 fold excess of PPh3 to Rh with a lineanbranch<br>
selectivity ratio of 8-9:1 being achieved.<br>
[007] Rh/PPh3 catalyzed hydroformylation is the key for making all oxo alcohols.<br>
Propylene is the largest single alkene hydroformylated to produce butylaldehyde, which can<br>
be hydrogenated to produce butanol, or dimerized by an aldol condensation and then<br>
hydrogenated to form 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, the largest single product produced by<br>
hydroformylation (over 5 billion lbs a year). 2-ethyl-1-hexanol is usually reacted with<br><br>
phthalic anhydride to produce dialkyl phthalic esters that are used as plasticizers to keep<br>
polyvinyl chloride plastics soft and flexible.<br>
[008] In the hydroformylation process, it is critical to get cheaper feed stocks for<br>
starting materials. For example, internal higher alkenes (SHOP alkenes) such as 3-octenes<br>
are desirable for converting the alkenes to linear aldehydes. Direct use of raffinate II (a<br>
mixture of n-butenes/butanes) and 1-butene and 2-butene mixtures are useful for<br>
hydroformylation. For hydroformylation of n-alkenes, it is important to obtain high linear<br>
selectivity. Hydroformylation of allylic alcohol and subsequent reduction can lead to 1, 4<br>
butenol. Functionalized internal alkenes can be used as alternative routes to bifunctional<br>
building blocks for polymers. Hydroformylation of methyl-3-pentenoate leads to making<br>
starting materials for polyamides and polyesters. In the tandem-isomerization and -<br>
hydroformylation processes, high isomerization rates combined with high selectivity towards<br>
terminal aldehydes are desirable with minimized undesirable hydrogenation reactions and<br>
minimiun isomerization towards conjugated compounds.<br>
[009] To overcome the need of using large excess of phosphines in the<br>
hydroformylation processes and achieve high regioselectivity, a new generation of transition<br>
metal catalysts were developed using bisphosphine ligands. -For example: Bisbi by Eastman<br>
Chemical; Xantphos by Prof. Leeuwen (University of Amsterdam), Bernhard Breit, Ace.<br>
Chem. Res. 2003, 36, 264-275, Bernhard Breit,'~WoIfgang Seiche, Synthesis 2001, 1, 1-36);<br>
and UC-44 by Union Carbide. These ligands are illustrated below.<br><br>
By using these ligands, a typical 400 fold excess of PPh3 has been reduced to a 5 fold excess<br>
of chelating phosphines. This new generation of chelating phosphines has led to high<br>
linear branched ratios as well as to higher catalytic activities. For example, a linear to branch<br><br>
ratio of 70-120:1 for hydroformylation of 1-hexene has been observed. Casey and van<br>
Leeuwen proposed that part of regioselectivity in the Rh-catalyzed hydroformylation is due to<br>
metal bisphosphine bite angle around 120 degree is formed, i.e., "the Bite angle hypothesis"<br>
as illustrated below.<br><br>
[0010] Despite that a number of chiral bisphosphorus ligands being-used as catalysts<br>
for hydroformylation and related reactions, the highly selective, active phosphorus ligands for .<br>
hydroformylation still remain an area of strong research interest. However, because of the<br>
dissociation of phosphines from the Rh-CO coordination, is a problem for achieving high<br>
regioselectivity, that is high linear to branch ratios of the products produced. Developing<br>
families of phosphorus ligands with multi-chelating coordination modes is attractive. The<br>
tetraphosphorous ligands of the present invention, because of their coordinating abilities<br>
through multi-chelating coordination modes, lead to highly regioselective transition in metal-<br>
ligand catalyzed hydroformylation and related reactions to provide high linear to branch<br>
ratios than those previously obtained. Also, the symmetric nature of these ligands allows<br>
these ligands to be prepared easily.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0011] In the present invention, we introduce a variety of tetraphosphorus ligands<br>
(Type A) with multi-chelating coordination modes as illustrated. below to enhance<br>
coordination abilities:<br><br><br>
where M is a metal selected from the group consisting of Fe, Zn, Mn, Co, Cu, Ag, Ni, Pt, Pd,<br>
Rh, Ru and Ir; X is selected from the group consisting of O, NH, NR and CH2; Y is selected<br>
from the group consisting of Ar, OAr and pyrrole; R is an organic group and Ar is an aryl<br>
group. Type A ligand is a tetraphosphorous ligand of the present invention. Type B ligand is<br>
a bisphosphorous ligand. As illustrated below, the tetraphosphorus ligand (Type A) has at<br>
least four chelating coordination modes to enhance coordination abilities whereas the<br>
bisphosphorus ligand (Type B) has a single mode, namely, P1-M-P2.<br><br>
Compared with normal bisphosphorus ligands (Type B), the multi-chelating tetraphosphorus<br>
ligands (Type A) of the present invention enhance the coordinating abilities of ligands<br>
without major change of electronic properties of ligands.<br>

Synthesis of the Tetraphosphate.Ligand <br>
[0021] All reactions and manipulations in the example set forth below were<br>
performed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox or using standard Schlenk techniques. THF and<br>
toluene were dried and distilled from sodium-benzophenone ketyl under nitrogen. Methylene<br>
"chloride was distilled from CaH2. Methanol was distilled from Mg under nitrogen. Column<br>
chromatography was performed using EM silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh). 1H, 13C and 31P<br>
 NMR were recorded on Bruker WP-200, AM-300, and AMX-360 spectrometers. Chemical<br>
shifts were reported in ppm down field from tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as<br>
the internal standard. MS spectra were recorded on a KRATOS mass spectrometer MS 9/50<br>
for LR-EI and HR-EI. GC analysis was carried on Helwett-Packard 6890 gas<br>
chromatography using chiral capillary columns. HPLC analysis was carried on WatersTM<br>
600 chromatography.<br>
[0022] The following procedure was used to synthesize ligand having the structure<br>
L1. To a solution of chlorodipyrrolyphosphine (4.4 mmol, 0.87g) in THF (10 mL) was added<br>
dropwise triethylamine 1mL and a solution of tetraol (1 mmol, 0.218 g) in THF (5 mL) at<br>
room temperature. Tetraol was synthesized according to Lindsten, G.; Wennerstroem, O.;<br>
Isaksson, R., J. Org. Chetn. 1987, 52, 547-54, and chlorodipyrrolyphosphine was prepared<br>
according van der Slot, S. C; Duran, J.; Luten, J.; Kamer, P. C. J.; van Leeuwen, P. W. N. M.<br>
Organometallics 2002, 21, 3873-3883. TriethyIamine-HCl salts were formed immediately<br>
after the addition. The reaction mixture was stirred for 6h at room temperature. The<br><br>
triethylamine-HCl salts were then filtered off and the solvent was removed under vacuum.<br>
The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on basic aluminum oxide eluted<br>
with hexane/EtOAc/NEt3 (6:1:0.01) to produce ligand L1 (0.31 g, 36%) as a air-stable<br>
colorless solid. 1H NMR (300 Hz, CDCl2) δ 7.23 (t, 2H, J= 8.3 Hz), 6.68 (m, 20H), 6.21 (m,<br>

Typical Hydroformylation Process<br>
[0023] To a 2 mL vial with a magnetic stirring bar was charged the tetraphosphprus<br>
ligand L1 prepared in the previous example (3 µmol, 2.6 mg) and Rh(acac)(CO)2 (1 µmol,<br>
0.1 mL of 10 mM solution in toluene). The mixture was stirred for 5 min. Then 2-octene (10<br>
mmol, 1.56 mL) was added followed by decane (0.01 mL) as internal standard. The reaction<br>
mixture was transferred to an autoclave. The autoclave was purged with nitrogen for three<br>
times and subsequently charged with CO (5 bar) and H2 (5 bar). The autoclave was then<br>
heated to 100°C (oil bath). After 12h, the autoclave was cooled in icy water and the pressure<br>
was carefully released in a well ventilated hood. The reaction mixture was immediately<br>
analyzed by GC.<br>
[0024] The remarkable regioselectivities using a multi-chelating tetraphosphorus<br>
ligand LI for hydroformylation of styrene, 1-octene and 1-hexene are demonstrated in Table<br>
1. Normally, styrene is a difficult substrate for achieving more than 2:1 ratio of linear to<br>
branched products when compared to bisphosphorous ligands of the prior art such as<br>
xantphos and UC-44. As shown in Table 1, the new tetraphosphorus ligands (Type A) such<br>
as LI is more selective hydroformylation ligand than the prior art bisphosphorous ligand<br>
(Type B). The reaction conditions included 0.1 mol%- Rh(CO)2(acac) and ligand, reaction<br>
temperature 80° C for 1 hour at 20 atm of CO and H2. These results indicate that<br>
tetraphosphorus ligands with multi-chelating coordination can be used to increase<br>
coordinating abilities of bisphosphine ligands. The regioselectivity with Type A is the<br>
highest reported to date.<br><br><br>
The results of hydroformylation of 2-hexene and 2-octene using the tetraphosphorus iigand<br>
(Type A) vs bisphosphorus Iigand (Type B) to produce an aldehyde are summarized below in<br>
Table 2. In Tables 2 to 11 which follow, "n:i" is the ratio of linear aldehyde to branched<br>
aldehyde and "TOF" is turnover frequency (turnover per catalyst per hour). The<br>
tetraphosphorus ligands of the present invention produce higher "n:i" ratios than<br>
bisphosphorus ligands.<br><br><br>
The hydroformylation conditions were S/C = 10000, [Rh] is 0.69 mM (for 2-hexene) and<br>
0.57 mM (for 2-octene), Ligand/Rh ratio is 3:1, reaction temperature is 100°C, CO/H2 is 5/5<br>
atm, toluene is the solvent, and decane is the internal standard.<br>
[0025] Table 3 below shows the results of hydroformylation of 1-hexene and 1-octene<br>
using the tetraphosphorus ligand (Type A) vs bisphosphorus ligand (Type B) to produce an<br>
aldehyde by a hydroformylation reaction:<br><br>
The reaction conditions: S/C = 10000, Rh concentation is 0.2mM, Ligand/Rh ratio is 3:1,<br>
temperature is 80°C, CO/H2 is 10/10 atm, toluene is the solvent, and decane is the internal<br>
standard.<br>
[0026] The hydroformylation reaction is highly dependent on the reaction conditions.<br>
Typical reaction conditions are S/C=10000, ligand metal ratio of about 3, transition metal.<br>
concentration of about 0.2 to 0.7mM, reaction temperature is 100°C,and the reaction time is<br>
12h. To optimize the reaction conditions, the following experiments have been carried out<br>
with tetraphosphorus ligand (LI). As evidenced by the "n:i" ratios in Tables 2 and 3, there a<br>
substantial and significant improvement in the amount of linear aldehyde produced using a<br>
tetraphosphorus ligand of the present invention as opposed to using a bisphosphorus ligand.<br>
Ligand to Metal Ratio<br>
[0027] The hydroformylation was first carried out with different ligand to metal<br>
ratios. As shown in Table 4, increasing the ligand metal ratio slightly decreased the reaction<br>
rate. On the other hand, the ligand to metal ratio significantly affects the regioselectivity. At<br><br>
lower ratios, low regioselectivity were observed. A minimum ligand to metal ratio of 2 is<br>
essential to achieve high regioselectivity, which allows the tetraphosphorus ligand to be<br>
coordinated in a multi-coordination mode. Further increasing the ligand to metal ratio did not<br>
significantly improve the regioselectivity.<br><br>
The reaction conditions: substrate is 2-octene, S/C=10000, Rh concentation is 0.57 mM,<br>
temperature is 100°C, CO/H2 is 10/10 atm, reaction time is 1h, toluene is the solvent, and.<br>
decane is the internal standard. The results in Table 4 show that presence of two of free<br>
phosphorus ligands with the tetraphosphorus ligand is important for achieving high<br>
regioselectivity (n:i goes from 2.92 to 17.7). Table 5 below shows similar results with 2-<br>
hexene as the substrate. .<br><br>
Reaction conditions: substrate is 2-hexene, S/C= 10000, Rh concentation is 0.69mM, reaction<br>
temperature is 100°C, CO/H2 is10/10 atm, reaction time is lh, toluene is the solvent, and<br>
decane is the internal standard. The results in Table 5 show that presence of two of free<br>
phosphorus ligands with the tetraphosphorus ligand is important for achieving high<br>
regioselectivity (n:i goes from 12.7 to 42).<br>
Temperature<br><br>
[0028] The reaction temperature also plays a key role in hydroformylation. As shown<br>
in Tables 6 and 7 below, at low temperature, though high regioselectivity was observed, the<br>
reaction rate was low. To facilitate the olefin isomerization and hydroformylation, high<br>
temperature (100°C) is preferred to achieve high reaction rate as well as acceptable<br>
regioselectivity.<br><br>
Reaction conditions: substrate is 2-octene, S/C=10000, Rh concentation is 0.57mM,<br>
Ligand/Rh ratio is 3:1, CO/H2 is 10/10 atm, reaction time is 1h, toluene is the solvent, and<br>
decane is the internal standard.<br><br>
Reaction conditions: substrate is 2-hexene, S/C=10000, Rh concentation is 0.69mM,<br>
Ligand/Rh ratio is 3:1, CO/H2 is 10/10 atm, reaction time is lh, toluene is the solvent, and<br>
decane is the internal standard.<br>
Pressure<br>
[0029] The CO/H2 total pressure also influences the reaction. At high pressure, both<br>
reaction rate and regioselectivity were low. Lowering the pressure generally results in higher<br>
reaction rate and regioselectivity. Decreasing the CO/H2 pressure from 10/10 atm to 5/5 atm<br><br>
did not change the reaction rate very much, but the regioselectivity improved further. The<br>
results from the hydroformylation of 2-octene and 2-hexene are shown in Tables 8 and 9.<br><br>
Reaction. conditions: substrate is 2-octene, S/C= 10000, Rh concentation is 0.57mM,<br>
Ligand/Rh ratio is 3:1, reaction temperature is 100°C, reaction time is lh, toluene is the<br>
solvent, and decane is the internal standard.<br><br>
Reaction conditions: substrate is 2-hexene, S/C=10000, Rh concentation is 0.69mM,<br>
Ligand/Rh ratio is 3:1, reaction temperature is 100°C, reaction time is lh, toluene is the<br>
solvent, and decane is the internal standard.<br>
Reaction time<br>
[0030] The reaction time also affects the hydroformylation selectivity. As shown in .<br>
Tables 10 and 11 below, the longer the reaction time, the lower the regioselectivity. Further<br>
an increase in the reaction time from 12h to 18h only slightly improved the turnover number<br>
(TON), i.e. turnover per catalyst, at the expense of decreased regioselectivity.<br><br><br>
