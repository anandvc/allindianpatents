I<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing an aromatic carboxylic acid. In detail, the<br>
invention relates to a process for producing an aromatic "<br>
carboxylic acid using acetic acid as a solvent or the like<br>
at the time of production.<br><background art><br>
In general, as a process for industrially producing<br>
an aromatic carboxylic acid such as terephthalic acid,<br>
there is known a process in which an alkyl aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon such as p-xylene is subjected to oxidation<br>
reaction in a liquid phase with molecular oxygen in an<br>
acetic acid solvent in the presence of a catalyst<br>
containing cobalt, manganese and bromine, slurry<br>
containing a crystal of generated terephthalic acid or<br>
other aromatic carboxylic acid is subjected to a solidliquid<br>
separation treatment and a subsequent drying step<br>
to form a crude aromatic carboxylic acid, the resulting<br>
crude aromatic carboxylic acid is then dissolved into<br>
water, and this aqueous solution is subjected to a<br>
purification treatment by hydrogenation to produce a highpurity<br>
aromatic carboxylic acid.<br>
Such a process for producing an aromatic carboxylic<br>
acid involves such a problem that the acetic acid which is<br>
a solvent is consumed during the oxidation reaction, that<br>
is, a loss of acetic acid occurs during the production<br>
step. One of causes thereof is the formation of methyl<br>
acetate as a by-product due to heterogeneous reaction of<br>
acetic acid.<br>
In order to inhibit the formation of methyl acetate<br>
as a by-product, there is known a technology in which a<br>
condensing component which is contained in an oxidation<br>
exhaust gas as generated from a reactor is condensed by a<br>
condenser, methyl acetate which is contained in an<br>
uncondensed gas is recovered by bringing into contact with<br>
and absorbing on acetic acid, and the recovered material<br>
is circulated into the reactor, thereby increasing a<br>
concentration of methyl acetate in a reaction mother<br>
liquid and inhibiting the reaction for forming a byproduct<br>
from acetic acid to methyl acetate (see Patent<br>
Document 1).<br>
Furthermore, there is known a technology in which an<br>
oxidation exhaust gas is directly introduced into a<br>
distillation tower to achieve distillation, an aliphatic<br>
carboxylic acid ester such as methyl acetate, which is<br>
contained in an exhaust gas of the distillation tower, is<br>
then brought into contact with and absorbed on an<br>
aliphatic carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, and the<br>
treated gas is brought into contact with washing water,<br>
thereby absorbing the aliphatic carboxylic acid (see<br>
Patent Document 2) .<br>
There is also known a method in which methyl acetate<br>
which is contained in distilled water as obtained in a<br>
solvent recovery step for dehydrating water as formed by<br>
oxidation from an acetic acid solvent is recovered by a<br>
distillation treatment and returned to an oxidation<br>
reactor (see Patent Document 3).<br>
As a method for recovering methyl acetate, there is<br>
also known a method in which in a solvent recovery method<br>
employing azeotropic distillation, a vapor as distilled by<br>
distillation is subjected to partial condensation, thereby<br>
recovering methyl acetate from a methyl acetate-entrained<br>
vapor (see Patent Document 4).<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION&gt;<br>
However, as described previously, in order to inhibit<br>
the formation of methyl acetate as a by-product, mere<br>
recovery of methyl acetate which is contained in the<br>
oxidation exhaust gas as generated from the reactor or<br>
distilled water in the solvent recovery step is<br>
insufficient for reducing the amount of consumption of<br>
acetic acid, and it is further necessary to reduce a loss<br>
of acetic acid, thereby efficiently producing an aromatic<br>
carboxylic acid.<br>
Furthermore, an exhaust gas composed mainly of an<br>
inert gas after partially condensing a distilled vapor by<br>
distillation in the solvent recovery step and recovering<br>
methyl acetate from the methyl acetate-entrained vapor is<br>
still entrained with methyl acetate, and a point for<br>
effectively utilizing this has not been solved yet.<br>
These problems are problems common in the production<br>
of terephthalic acid and other aromatic carboxylic acids<br>
using acetic acid as a solvent.<br>
Then, a problem of the invention is to solve the<br>
foregoing problems and to advantageously produce an<br>
aromatic carboxylic acid such as terephthalic acid by<br>
making the amount of consumption of an acetic acid solvent<br>
in the production step of an aromatic carboxylic acid<br>
small as far as possible and industrially enhancing<br>
production efficiency.<br>
In order to solve the foregoing problems, the<br>
invention is concerned with a process for producing an<br>
aromatic carboxylic acid by subjecting an alkyl aromatic<br>
compound to oxidation reaction in a liquid phase using<br>
- K -<br>
5<br>
acetic acid as a solvent to form aromatic carboxylic acidcontaining<br>
slurry, characterized by separating and<br>
recovering methyl acetate which is contained in an exhaust<br>
gas as generated in a step after the foregoing oxidation<br>
reaction step and returning the recovered methyl acetate<br>
to the foregoing oxidation reaction step.<br>
According to the thus constructed process for<br>
producing an aromatic carboxylic acid according to the<br>
invention, since not only methyl acetate which is<br>
contained in an oxidation exhaust gas as generated from a<br>
reactor is recovered, but also methyl acetate which is<br>
contained in an exhaust gas as generated in a step after<br>
the oxidation reaction, for example, one step or plural<br>
steps selected from a crystallization step, a solid-liquid<br>
separation step, a drying step, and a solvent recovery<br>
step is returned to the oxidation reaction step, the<br>
formation of methyl acetate as a by-product is inhibited,<br>
a loss of acetic acid as a solvent during the reaction is<br>
reduced, and a production efficiency is enhanced.<br>
The invention is also concerned with a process for<br>
producing an aromatic carboxylic acid by subjecting an<br>
alkyl aromatic compound to oxidation reaction in a liquid<br>
phase using acetic acid as a solvent to form aromatic<br>
carboxylic acid-containing slurry and subjecting this<br>
slurry to at least a solid-liquid separation step,<br>
characterized by recovering acetic acid which is contained<br>
- 6 -<br>
in a liquid or vapor as generated in the oxidation<br>
reaction step, solid-liquid separation step or the both<br>
steps by a distillation operation and recovering methyl<br>
acetate in an exhaust gas as generated in this<br>
distillation operation and returning it to the oxidation<br>
reaction step.<br>
According to the foregoing process for producing an<br>
aromatic carboxylic acid, in the solvent recovery step,<br>
since not only methyl acetate in distilled water as<br>
obtained by the distillation operation but also a<br>
condensing component in the distilled gas are condensed as<br>
far as possible and methyl acetate in an exhaust gas<br>
composed mainly of a generated inert gas is also recovered<br>
and returned to the oxidation reaction step, recovery<br>
efficiency of methyl acetate is further increased so that<br>
a loss of acetic acid which is a solvent during the<br>
reaction can be extremely efficiently lowered.<br>
As a method for recovering methyl acetate in the<br>
foregoing exhaust gas, a method for absorbing methyl<br>
acetate in an acetic acid liquid and recovering it is<br>
efficient and preferable. Also, as the acetic acid which<br>
is used for recovering methyl acetate, it is preferred to<br>
use one as obtained by a separation treatment of acetic<br>
acid and water in the solvent recovery step.<br>
Furthermore, in addition to the dissolution of the<br>
foregoing problems, for the purpose of solving a problem<br>
that the treated gas after absorbing methyl acetate into<br>
acetic acid is entrained with a part of acetic acid, in<br>
the foregoing process for producing an aromatic carboxylic'<br>
t<br>
acid which is characterized by recovering methyl acetate<br>
in the exhaust gas and returning it to the oxidation<br>
reaction step, methyl acetate is absorbed into acetic acid<br>
and recovered; the acetic acid component which is<br>
contained in the treated gas is then absorbed into water;<br>
and the acetic acid component which has been recovered as<br>
an acetic acid aqueous solution is used as a part of the<br>
solvent. Also, this acetic acid aqueous solution may be<br>
used in a washing step of a cake in the solid-liquid<br>
separation step or may be fed into the solvent recovery<br>
step to reduce the water content and then reused together<br>
with other recovered acetic acid.<br>
As the foregoing water for absorbing acetic acid,<br>
water resulting from fractional distillation by a<br>
separation treatment of acetic acid and water in the<br>
solvent recovery step can be used.<br>
Furthermore, in the foregoing step, p-xylene can be<br>
employed as the alkyl aromatic compound, and terephthalic<br>
acid can be employed as the aromatic carboxylic acid.<br>
8<br><statement of the invention><br>
An embodiment of the present invention relates to a<br>
process for producing an aromatic carboxylic acid by<br>
subjecting an alkyl aromatic compound such as herein describe<br>
to oxidation reaction in liquid phase using acetic acid as a<br>
solvent in a manner as herein described to form aromatic<br>
carboxylic acid containing slurry, characterized in that the<br>
step after the oxidation reaction step is one or more steps<br>
selected from a crystallization step, a solid-liquid<br>
separation step and a drying step.<br><brief description of the accompanying drawings><br>

The invention will be hereunder described in detail.<br>
Examples of the alkyl aromatic compound to be used in<br>
the invention include alkylbenzenes and alkylnaphthalenes<br>
which are converted into an aromatic carboxylic acid such<br>
as aromatic monocarboxylic acids, aromatic dicarboxylic<br>
acids, and aromatic tricarboxylic acids by liquid phase<br>
oxidation, for example, mono-, di-, or trialkylbenzenes,<br>
inclusive of those in which a part of the alkyl groups<br>
thereof is oxidized.<br>
Furthermore, the process for producing an aromatic<br>
carboxylic acid which is used in the invention typically<br>
includes the respective steps of:<br>
(i) an oxidation reaction step for subjecting an alkyl<br>
aromatic compound to liquid phase oxidation in acetic acid<br>
as a solvent in the presence of a catalyst containing<br>
• ,o<br>
cobalt, manganese and bromine to form aromatic carboxylic<br>
acid-containing slurry,<br>
(ii) a step for crystallizing the aromatic carboxylic<br>
acid as dissolved in a mother liquor of the formed slurry,<br>
(iii) a step for subjecting the aromatic carboxylic<br>
acid slurry as obtained in the crystallization step to<br>
solid-liquid separation into a mother liquor and a cake<br>
containing an aromatic carboxylic acid,<br>
(iv) a drying step for removing a liquid adhered onto<br>
the separated cake, and<br>
(v) a solvent recovery step for recovering acetic<br>
acid from a vapor or liquid containing acetic acid as<br>
generated from at least one of the step (i) to the step<br>
(iv) .<br>
Especially, the invention is applied to the<br>
production of terephthalic acid, and the alkyl aromatic<br>
compound as a preferred starting material is p-xylene.<br>
An embodiment regarding the case of producing terephthalic<br>
acid by oxidation of p-xylene will be hereunder<br>
described below.<br>
An amount of acetic acid as a solvent which is used<br>
in the invention is usually from 2 to 6 times by weight<br>
based on p-xylene as the starting material. As the acetic<br>
acid solvent, one containing a slight amount of water,<br>
specifically one containing not more than 15 % by weight<br>
of water can also be used.<br>
In order to subject p-xylene to oxidation reaction in<br>
a liquid phase, a molecular oxygen-containing gas is used.<br>
Air is usually used because it can be used by simple<br>
equipment and at low costs, and diluted air, oxygen-rich<br>
air, and the like can also be used.<br>
In order to oxidize p-xylene, a catalyst containing<br>
cobalt (Co) , manganese (Mn) and bromine (Br) as<br>
constituent elements is usually used as the catalyst.<br>
The reaction for oxidizing p-xylene in a liquid phase<br>
is carried out by oxidizing p-xylene while continuously<br>
feeding a molecular oxygen-containing gas in an acetic<br>
acid solvent in the presence of a catalyst at a<br>
temperature of from 140 to 230°C, and preferably from 150<br>
to 210°C. A pressure in the oxidation reaction step is a<br>
pressure under which the mixture can at least keep the<br>
liquid phase at the reaction temperature or a higher<br>
pressure than that pressure and is usually from 0.2 to 5<br>
MPa, and preferably from 1 to 2 MPa.<br>
While a reactor is usually a stirrer-equipped tank,<br>
the stirrer is not always necessary, and it may be a<br>
bubble tower type. The reactor is provided with a<br>
condenser in the upper portion thereof and a molecular<br>
oxygen gas-containing gas feed port in the lower portion<br>
thereof.<br>
And, the molecular oxygen-containing gas as fed from<br>
the lower portion is utilized for the oxidation reaction<br>
-hand<br>
then discharged out as an exhaust gas entraining a<br>
large amount of a solvent vapor from the reactor;<br>
subsequently, after condensing and separating a condensing<br>
component from the exhaust gas by a reflux condenser, the<br>
resulting gas is discharged out as an oxidation exhaust<br>
gas. The condensed liquid, after purging a part thereof<br>
out the system for the purpose of regulating the water<br>
content of the reaction mother liquor, is refluxed into<br>
the reactor.<br>
Furthermore, the oxidation exhaust gas is introduced<br>
into a high-pressure absorption tower, and methyl acetate<br>
in the exhaust gas is subjected to gas-liquid contact with<br>
acetic acid or an acetic acid-containing liquid and<br>
absorbed therein. As the acetic acid, it is preferred to<br>
use acetic acid as recovered from the solvent recovery<br>
step.<br>
The thus methyl acetate-absorbed acetic acid is<br>
returned to the oxidation reactor, provided for oxidation<br>
reaction, and then used for formation reaction of<br>
terephthalic acid.<br>
And, in the crystallization step regarding slurry of<br>
a reaction product as obtained in the oxidation reaction<br>
step, the reaction slurry is dropped to proper temperature<br>
and pressure to obtain terephthalic acid slurry. With<br>
respect to the crystallization condition, the number of<br>
stage of the crystallization is from I to 6 stages, and<br>
- VS. -<br>
13<br>
preferably from 2 to 4 stages. For a series of<br>
crystallization steps, flash cooling is employed, and it<br>
is preferable that a final step is carried out in a<br>
boiling state under a reduced pressure.<br>
Terephthalic acid is usually recovered through a<br>
solid-liquid separation step and a drying step of the<br>
slurry having been subjected to a crystallization<br>
treatment and sent to a hydrogenation purification step.<br>
By omitting this drying step, the acetic acid solvent may<br>
be displaced by a water solvent through a solvent<br>
displacement step, which is then sent directly to the<br>
hydrogenation purification step.<br>
As a device for carrying out the solid-liquid<br>
separation, a device such as a centrifuge, a horizontal<br>
belt filter, and a rotary vacuum filter is usually used,<br>
but it should not be construed that the invention is<br>
limited thereto.<br>
Furthermore, the solvent recovery step is a step for<br>
recovering acetic acid by purifying an oxidation exhaust<br>
gas condensed liquid or a mother liquor as aliquoted<br>
during the solid-liquid separation. The solvent recovery<br>
step is also called as an acetic acid dehydration step<br>
because water as formed by the oxidation is removed.<br>
In order to recover methyl acetate and acetic acid<br>
from exhaust gases as generated from the foregoing<br>
crystallization step, solid-liquid separation step, drying<br>
step and solvent recovery step, the recovery can be<br>
carried out by gathering one or more exhaust gases<br>
containing methyl acetate and acetic acid as generated in<br>
the respective steps to form a gathered gas, introducing<br>
this gathered gas into an absorption tower and bringing it<br>
into contact with acetic acid as adjusted in a droplet<br>
form or the like to absorb it therein. With respect to<br>
the absorption condition, it is preferable that the<br>
temperature is as low as possible in view of absorption<br>
efficiency, and the recovery is usually carried out at not<br>
higher than 50°C.<br>
The hydrogenation purification step is a method in<br>
which a water-containing liquid is added to crude<br>
terephthalic acid to form slurry, hydrogenation treatment<br>
is carried out in the presence of a catalyst in the state<br>
that this slurry is dissolved by heating, and the<br>
resulting treated material is subjected to crystallization<br>
and solid-liquid separation to produce high-purity<br>
terephthalic acid. On this occasion, the crude<br>
terephthalic acid is fed as slurry of usually from 20 to<br>
35 % by weight based on the water-containing liquid into a<br>
hydrogenation reaction system.<br>
As the hydrogenation catalyst, arbitrary catalysts<br>
which have hitherto been known can be used. Examples<br>
thereof include palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, osmium,<br>
iridium, and platinum, each of which is supported on<br>
if<br>
active carbon. These catalysts may be used jointly.<br>
With respect to the condition of the hydrogenation<br>
purification reaction, usually, it is general to carry out<br>
the hydrogenation purification reaction at a reaction<br>
temperature of from 255 to 300°C under a reaction pressure<br>
of from 1 to 12 MPa and a hydrogen partial pressure of<br>
from 0.05 to 3 MPa. However, it should not be construed<br>
that the invention is limited thereto.<br>
It is general to separate terephthalic acid as<br>
purified by the hydrogenation reaction as a solid by<br>
crystallization and solid-liquid separation. The<br>
condition of the crystallization is chosen while taking<br>
into account a yield of the solid as deposited, a purity<br>
of the same solid, and so -on. Usually, the<br>
crystallization is carried out in plural stages, and the<br>
crystallization condition in the final stage is at from<br>
140 to 180°C under from 0.3 to 1.0 MPa. On this occasion,<br>
a residence time in each crystallization tank is fixed at<br>
from about 5 to 200 minutes. When the temperature of the<br>
crystallization tank in the final stage is lower than the<br>
foregoing range, since the amount of deposition of<br>
impurities such as p-TA rapidly increases, the purity of<br>
terephthalic acid as separated as a solid becomes low, and<br>
therefore, such is not preferable.<br>
In general, by achieving solid-liquid separation<br>
after carrying out the crystallization, terephthalic acid<br>
as deposited in the crystallization step is separated from<br>
a liquid containing water as the major component. As the<br>
temperature and pressure condition for achieving the<br>
solid-liquid separation, there is chosen a condition<br>
substantially the same as the condition in the<br>
crystallization tank and when the crystallization step is<br>
of multiple stages, the condition in the final<br>
crystallization tank. As a device for carrying out the<br>
solid-liquid separation, a device such as a centrifuge, a<br>
horizontal belt filter, and a rotary vacuum filter is<br>
usually used, but it should not be construed that the<br>
invention is limited thereto. It is also possible to use<br>
a combination of two or more of these devices.<br>
Terephthalic acid as obtained by solid-liquid<br>
separation of the solid which has been deposited after the<br>
purification step may be dried as it is and then provided<br>
as a product. Alternatively, after forming terephthalic<br>
acid together with fresh water into slurry and washing in<br>
a suspension and washing tank, a solid as separated by<br>
solid-liquid separation may be dried and then provided as<br>
a product.<br>
Next, one examples of representative embodiments<br>
regarding the process for producing terephthalic acid<br>
according to the invention will be described with<br>
reference to a flow chart of an apparatus of Fig. 1.<br>
First of all, a mixture of a catalyst containing<br>
Co/Mn/Br, an acetic acid solvent and starting p-xylene and<br>
a molecular oxygen-containing gas are fed into a reactor<br>
(also called as "an oxidation reactor") 1. A gas<br>
component as discharged from this reactor 1, after<br>
condensing and separating a condensing component such as<br>
acetic acid by a condenser (gas-liquid separator) 2, is<br>
discharged as an oxidation exhaust gas from the heat<br>
exchanger . A condensed liquid 4, after discharging a<br>
part thereof as a purging fraction out the system for the<br>
purpose of regulating the water content thereof, is<br>
refluxed into the reactor 1.<br>
Slurry as obtained by an oxidation treatment in the<br>
reactor 1 is transferred into a low-temperature additional<br>
oxidation tank (not illustrated) and subjected to an<br>
oxidation treatment with a small amount of a molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas at a temperature lower than .the<br>
reactor 1. The slurry having been subjected to an<br>
oxidation treatment is further crystallized in a<br>
crystallization tank 5. The number of stage of the<br>
crystallization is usually from 1 to 6 stages. This<br>
slurry having been subjected to a crystallization<br>
treatment is separated into a mother liquor component and<br>
a crude terephthalic acid cake in a solid-liquid separator<br>
6, and crude terephthalic acid is obtained through a dryer<br>
9.<br>
Furthermore, the crude terephthalic acid is formed<br>
18<br>
into slurry with a water-containing liquid in a nonillustrated<br>
mixing tank, and after dissolution, the<br>
solution is transferred into a hydrogenation purification<br>
reactor and subjected to a purification treatment into<br>
high-purity terephthalic acid.<br>
On the other hand, the oxidation exhaust gas<br>
condensed liquid and the mother liquor component as<br>
separated in the solid-liquid separator 6 are transferred<br>
into a solvent recovery step having a solvent recovery<br>
tower 7 and a dehydration tower 8, whereby acetic acid is<br>
recovered.<br>
An exhaust gas 3 is discharged from not only the<br>
reactor 1 but also the crystallization tank 5, the solidliquid<br>
separator 6, the dryer 9, and the dehydration tower<br>
8. Such an exhaust gas composed of a gathering of exhaust<br>
gases from one or more locals is introduced into a highpressure<br>
absorption tower 10 or a low-pressure absorption<br>
tower 11, and methyl acetate as entrained in the exhaust<br>
gas is absorbed by using acetic acid for an absorbing<br>
liquid and recovered in the reactor 1.<br>
In the case where a solid-liquid separator of a<br>
filtration type such as a horizontal belt filter and a<br>
rotary vacuum filter is used as the solid-liquid separator,<br>
a filtrate and a gas are discharged from a vacuum device<br>
and subjected to suction filtration while feeding a gas in<br>
the upstream side of a filtration section within the<br>
separator. At this time, the discharged filtrate and gas<br>
are subjected to gas-liquid separation, and at least a<br>
part of the resulting gas is discharged out the step.<br>
However, since methyl acetate is contained in this gas, it<br>
is preferred to apply the recovery measure of methyl<br>
acetate according to the invention.<br>
Furthermore, in the case of using a measure in which<br>
in a rotary dryer or a fluidized bed dry as the dryer, the<br>
solvent component as vaporized within the dryer is<br>
entrained in the foregoing gas by circulating an inert gas<br>
such as a process gas within the dryer and discharged out<br>
the dryer, since methyl acetate is contained in the gas,<br>
it is preferred to apply the recovery measure of methyl<br>
acetate according to the invention.<br>
As the acetic acid to be used for the purpose of<br>
recovering methyl acetate in the absorption tower 10 or 11,<br>
acetic acid as obtained by the separation treatment of<br>
acetic acid and water in the solvent recovery step (7 and<br>
8) is preferable. Furthermore, it is preferred to provide<br>
a device for absorbing acetic acid by using water and<br>
recovering it in the downstream side of the high-pressure<br>
absorption tower 10 or the low-pressure absorption tower<br>
11. An absorption device of methyl acetate and an<br>
absorption device of acetic acid may be a tower as<br>
separately provided or may be provided integrally in the<br>
same tower. At this time, the water to be used for the<br>
absorption of acetic acid is preferably water as obtained<br>
by the separation treatment of acetic acid and water in<br>
the solvent recovery step (7 and 8) or a separated mother<br>
liquor containing, as the major component, water as<br>
obtained by solid-liquid separation in the hydrogenation<br>
purification step.<br>
In this way, methyl acetate is recovered from the<br>
exhaust gas composed of a gathering of methyl acetatecontaining<br>
exhaust gases as generated in one or plural<br>
steps selected from the crystallization step, the solidliquid<br>
separation step, the drying step, and the solvent<br>
recovery step and returned to the oxidation reaction step,<br>
whereby formation reaction of methyl acetate as a byproduct<br>
is inhibited, a loss of acetic acid as a solvent<br>
during the reaction is reduced, and production efficiency<br>
is enhanced.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and<br>
with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be<br>
apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes<br>
and modifications can be made therein without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope thereof.<br>
This application is based on a Japanese patent<br>
application filed February 21, 2003 (Patent Application No.<br>
2003-044121), the entire contents thereof being hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br><industrial applicability><br>
According to the invention, since not only methyl<br>
acetate which is contained in an oxidation exhaust gas as<br>
generated from a reactor is recovered, but also methyl<br>
acetate obtainable from exhaust gases as generated in a<br>
step after an oxidation reaction step, namely one or<br>
plural steps selected from a crystallization step, a<br>
solid-liquid separation step, a drying step, and a solvent<br>
recovery step is returned to the oxidation reaction step,<br>
there are given such advantages that a recovery efficiency<br>
of methyl acetate is increased, a loss of acetic acid as a<br>
solvent during the reaction is reduced, and production<br>
efficiency is enhanced.<br>
Furthermore, in an invention in which in absorbing<br>
methyl acetate into acetic acid and recovering it, the<br>
absorption treated gas-entrained acetic acid is returned<br>
to a prescribed step, since a loss of acetic acid is<br>
reduced, there is given such an advantage that an aromatic<br>
carboxylic acid such as terephthalic acid can be extremely<br>
advantageously produced with industrially enhanced<br>
production efficient.<br><br>
