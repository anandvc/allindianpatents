				<td>METHOD AND APPRATUS FOR SORTING GRANULAR OBJECTS<br>
WITH<br>
AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT THRESHOLD LEVELS<br>
BACKGROUNF OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a sorting apparatus for<br>
granular objects, and more particularly to a sorting<br>
method and apparatus for granular objects in which image<br>
signals obtained by a solid-state image device, for exam-<br>
ple, a CCD sensor from each material to be sorted are im-<br>
age-processed, and the sorting is conducted by specifying<br>
the objects to be sorted among a number of objects.<br>
(2)	Description of the Related Art<br>
The technique has been known for sorting defective<br>
granular objects with which the defective portion is de-<br>
tected by image-taking the moving granular objects by a<br>
camera equipped with a CCD sensor, and the quantity of<br>
light for each image element of the image-taken granular<br>
object is binarized at a predetermined threshold. This<br>
technique is applied not limited to the sorting of the<br>
granular objects, and is applied to the sorting of wood-<br>
related materials as disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai<br>
Publication No. Hei 8-35940, and to the sorting of bottles<br><br>
as disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. Hei<br>
9-203614.<br>
In recent years, the resolution power (number of im-<br>
age elements or pixels) of the CCD sensor has improved<br>
thus enabling to detect differences in fine colors and in<br>
degrees of the quantity of light and, in addition to the<br>
precision, has remarkably improved processing speeds. Es-<br>
pecially, for granular objects, such as rice grains and<br>
pellets of plastic materials each of which is small in<br>
size, the improved CCD sensor is effective. In the rice<br>
grain, a color may be caused to occur due to damage during<br>
the growth and, in the pellets, a color may be present due<br>
to the mixing-in of impurity or foreign objects. The col-<br>
ored portion of such nature may have a width or a diameter<br>
of from several mm to l/10mm or less. There are also dif-<br>
ferences in the heaviness of colors at the colored por-<br>
tions, and the heaviness of the colors varies from one<br>
which has influence to the value of the product and to one<br>
which has no influence to the value itself of the product.<br>
The improvement in the resolution power has contrib-<br>
uted to enable the discrimination of granular objects<br>
which could not have been discriminated readily by the<br>
human eyes. Especially, it has become possible to sort out<br>
a small but a heavy color which was difficult to sort con-<br>
ventionally. On the other hand, a rice grain or a pellet<br><br>
having not too heavy color and a size thereof which do not<br>
have direct or substantial influence to the quality is<br>
sensed and is sorted out, resulting in lowering of the<br>
sorting yield, or unfavorably in mixing a large number of<br>
acceptable objects into unacceptable objects. Under the<br>
circumstance, one solution is to change the threshold val-<br>
ue but, when such change is made simply to the level of<br>
the heavier side of color, the sorting standard is changed<br>
based on the heaviness without regard to the size (area)<br>
of the colored portion, so that the color which is light<br>
in the heaviness but which extends wide in the size is<br>
outside the subject of sorting. However, here a problem<br>
arises that, even when the color is light in the heaviness,<br>
if the size thereof is large, the product value is af-<br>
fected so that it is desired to sort out the grain having<br>
such color.<br>
The above results from the improvement in the resolu-<br>
tion power of the image-taking device, and the problem is<br>
eased if the resolution power is lowered as in the conven-<br>
tional technique. However, in such a case, the detection<br>
of a small size color becomes difficult so that the desire<br>
that the color which is small size but is heavy must be<br>
subject of the sorting out is not satisfied.<br>
Further, in the conventional sorting, the sorting<br>
action aims at the colored portion itself so that, when<br><br>
the colored portion present at an end or peripheral por-<br>
tion of the granular object, the sorting action aiming at<br>
the colored portion results in not only being unable to<br>
perform precise ejection of the subject granular object<br>
but also in unfavorably ejecting other granular objects<br>
which are moving continuously together with the subject<br>
granular objects. This not only causes the sorting yield<br>
to be lowered but also becomes a cause for increasing the<br>
rate of acceptable products mixed into the unacceptable<br>
products.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a method and<br>
apparatus for sorting granular objects which enhances the<br>
sorting yield and in which, in order to enhance the sort-<br>
ing precision, the resolution power is elevated so as to<br>
be able to sort out the defective granular objects having<br>
a heavily colored portion which, even small in size, has<br>
influence to the product value, and the sorting yield is<br>
improved by not sorting out the granular objects having a<br>
defective portion which is small and only lightly colored<br>
thus having no influence to the product value. Further,<br>
the sorting process is such that only those defective<br>
granular objects which have influence to the lowering of<br>
the product value are sorted out and that the acceptable<br><br>
granular objects are not involved in the mix-up thus re-<br>
sulting in being sorted out into the unacceptable granular<br>
objects by the mix-up.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a method for sorting granular objects,<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
image-taking, by a solid-state image device, while<br>
granular objects flowing in a continuous form are being<br>
irradiated by light;<br>
binarizing image element signals from the solid-state<br>
image device by a threshold value of a predetermined lumi-<br>
nance brightness determined for detecting a defective por-<br>
tion of a granular object of a first level;<br>
detecting a defective image element signal from the<br>
binarized image element signals; determining as defective<br>
when continuous defective image element signals exceed a<br>
predetermined number, and canceling defective image sig-<br>
nals when such signals do not exceed the predetermined<br>
number;<br>
and advancing a granular object sorting process with<br>
those granular objects that have been determined as defec-<br>
tive in the above step.<br>
According to the invention, the picture of the granu-<br>
lar object image-taken of the granular object is binarized<br>
by a threshold value of a first level for detecting a de-<br><br>
fective portion of a relatively light tone of color. When<br>
the defective portion of the first level is detected from<br>
the picture, for example, when a plurality of image ele-<br>
ments each having a colored portion of a relatively light<br>
tone of color are continuously detected, and the number<br>
thereof exceeds a predetermined number, the sorting proc-<br>
ess is advanced with such portion as the defective portion,<br>
that is, the colored portion. On the other hand, when the<br>
defective portion of the first level is detected but the<br>
number thereof does not exceed the predetermined number,<br>
such portion is not treated as a defective portion and is<br>
canceled. That is, when a defective portion which does not<br>
have influence to the product value is detected, the sort-<br>
ing process is not advanced. Therefore, when a defective<br>
portion of a light tone of color is present, the judgment<br>
as to whether it is to be excluded or not depends on the<br>
size of such portion.<br>
The judgment process is performed through the image<br>
processing and, when the image element signals are obtained<br>
during the scanning, if the scanning is made in the direc-<br>
tion perpendicular to the moving direction of the granular<br>
objects, not only the number of the continuous image ele-<br>
ments as defective portions along the scanning direction<br>
(horizontal direction) is detected but also the number of<br>
the continuous image elements as defective portions along<br><br>
the object flowing direction (vertical direction) is ef-<br>
fectively detected. If the predetermined value for the<br>
horizontal direction is set, for example, to when the num-<br>
ber exceeds the continuous 3 image elements, and the same<br>
for the vertical direction is set, for example, to when<br>
the number exceeds the continuous 2 image elements (2 col-<br>
umns) and, by setting not only the size in the horizontal<br>
direction of the defective portion but also the size in<br>
the vertical direction thereof, it is possible to make the<br>
judgment of the defective portion of the first level. In<br>
accordance with the elevation of the resolution power, not<br>
only the detecting precision of the defective portion of a<br>
light tone color is enhanced, but also enabled the judg-<br>
ment of the size thereof by the counting of the number of<br>
image elements, thus showing the effects resulting from<br>
the elevation of the resolution power. Also, irrespective<br>
of whether the arrangement is one in which the image ele-<br>
ment signals are inputted in a serial mode or one in which<br>
the signals are inputted in a parallel mode, it is possi-<br>
ble in the image processing technique to conduct a batch<br>
process by a predetermined memory capacity by accumulating<br>
each scanning signal with the positions of the horizontal<br>
and vertical directions of the image elements of the<br>
granular object being respectively coincided with one an-<br>
other.<br><br><br>
The defective portion which does not have influence<br>
to the product validity in this specification refers to<br>
such a defective portion that is not easily or readily<br>
recognized by human eye's observation and the presence of<br>
such portion does not have influence to the product valid-<br>
ity and, despite the presence of such portion, the quality<br>
and the safety of the product can be maintained substan-<br>
tially and sufficiently.<br>
The sorting process according to the invention may<br>
further include the binarizing of the image element sig-<br>
nals from the solid-state image device by a threshold val-<br>
ue of a predetermined luminance brightness determined for<br>
detecting a defective portion of a granular object of a<br>
second level heavier than the first level, and the ad-<br>
vancing of a granular object sorting process with the im-<br>
age element that has been determined as defective one<br>
among the binarized image element signals. The first level<br>
is the threshold value for a defective portion of a light<br>
tone color and the second level is the threshold value for<br>
a defective portion of a heavy tone color. When the image<br>
element signal for the defective portion of a heavy tone<br>
color is detected, the sorting process for the related<br>
granular object is advanced irrespective of the continuing<br>
or non-continuing of the image elements. Thus, when the<br>
image element having a defective portion of a heavy tone<br><br>
color is detected, the related granular object is always<br>
ejected as the defective granular object.<br>
The binarizing process using the second threshold<br>
value is carried out in parallel with the binarizing proc-<br>
ess which uses the first threshold value. The image ele-<br>
ment rendered defective by the second threshold value is<br>
also rendered defective by the first threshold value. How-<br>
ever, in the binarization by the first threshold value, if<br>
the defective portion of a heavy tone color does not ex-<br>
ceed the predetermined number of continuous image elements,<br>
such portion is canceled and is not rendered defective.<br>
However, by providing the second threshold value, even<br>
when the image element is non-continuous, that is, even<br>
when the image element has an extremely small defective<br>
portion which becomes detectable only by elevating the<br>
resolution power, if such defective portion is of a heavy<br>
tone color, the related image element becomes one which is<br>
judged as defective through the binarization by the second<br>
threshold value, and the related granular object is judged<br>
as defective and is ejected. Thus, the effects of the ele-<br>
vation of the resolution power are demonstrated.<br>
Also, the above described method for sorting granular<br>
objects includes the steps of:<br>
specifying granular object image elements by binariz-<br>
ing image element signals from the solid-state image de-<br><br>
vice by a threshold value of a predetermined luminance<br>
brightness determined for detecting an outward form of a<br>
granular object;<br>
specifying defective granular object image elements<br>
based on a defective image detected at the first level or<br>
the second level;<br>
specifying an image element in a center location of<br>
the defective image elements based on the specified defec-<br>
tive granular object image elements;<br>
and outputting a sorting signal to act on the center<br>
location of the defective granular object, corresponding<br>
to the image element at the specified center location.<br>
An outward form of a granular object is detected by a<br>
predetermined luminance brightness threshold value deter-<br>
mined for detecting the outward form of the granular ob-<br>
ject, the luminance brightness threshold value being set<br>
separately from the above-explained first and second level<br>
threshold values. Based on the defective image elements<br>
detected by the first level and second level threshold<br>
values, more specifically, by laying the image elements at<br>
the defective portion over an aggregate of the image ele-<br>
ments forming the outward form of the granular object, the<br>
granular object having the defective image elements is<br>
caused to be recognized as the defective granular object,<br>
and the image element at the center location of the defec-<br><br>
tive granular object is specified irrespective of the im-<br>
age element location of the defective portion at the image<br>
element aggregation of the defective granular object. In<br>
this way, the sorting signal is outputted so as to act<br>
with respect to the center location of the defective<br>
granular object corresponding to the image element at the<br>
center location of the specified defective granular object<br>
unlike in the conventional technique in which the sorting<br>
action has been pointed to the defective portion itself of<br>
image element. Thus, wherever in the granular object the<br>
defective portion of the defective granular object may be<br>
present, it is ensured to eliminate a single defective<br>
granular object concerned.<br>
For the step of specifying the image element at the<br>
center location of the defective granular object described<br>
above, the method includes the steps of:<br>
providing a contracting process in vertical and hori-<br>
zontal directions of the image elements of the defective<br>
granular object;<br>
dividing continuous image elements into a plurality<br>
of blocks with a predetermined number of continuous image<br>
elements as one block and enlarging the image elements<br>
that have undergone the contracting process into a plural-<br>
ity of block units;<br>
specifying a center block in a horizontal direction<br><br>
in the plurality of blocks obtained by the enlarging proc-<br>
ess;<br>
specifying a center block in a vertical direction in<br>
the plurality of blocks obtained by the enlarging process;<br>
and<br>
determining a center location block of the granular<br>
object by the overlapping between the center block in the<br>
horizontal direction and the center block in the vertical<br>
direction.<br>
 With respect to the image elements of a defective<br>
granular object, the contracting process which is a method<br>
of processing of images is carried out. Since the granular<br>
objects are moving in a continuous form, the overlapping<br>
thereof at their peripheral portions are expected so that<br>
 there are cases wherein one image element aggregation of<br>
each granular object cannot be specified. Thus, by the<br>
contracting process for a predetermined number of image<br>
elements, the image element aggregation is made in both<br>
the vertical and horizontal directions and, in this way,<br>
 the overlapping of the granular objects is solved and it<br>
is possible to specify one granular object image element.<br>
After the granular objects are made, by the contracting<br>
process, image element aggregations individually independ-<br>
ent from each other, a predetermined number of image ele-<br>
 ments, for example, continuous image elements are divided<br><br>
into 1 block each and, within 1 division, even if 1 image<br>
element of the granular object is present, 1 block in its<br>
entirety is enlarged as the granular object image element.<br>
That is, the image element aggregation of the granular<br>
objects becomes an image element block aggregation<br>
By the aggregation of a plurality of blocks of the<br>
enlarged image elements as above, the center block in the<br>
vertical direction and the center block in the horizontal<br>
direction are specified. When there are blocks of even<br>
number in the horizontal direction, 2 blocks are selected<br>
as the center blocks, and when there are blocks of odd<br>
number in the horizontal direction, 1 block is selected as<br>
the center block. By overlapping the center blocks in the<br>
vertical and horizontal directions selected as above, it<br>
is possible to specify the center blocks of the granular<br>
objects. Since the location of the center block becomes<br>
the center location of the given granular object, and it<br>
is possible to specify on the image elements the center<br>
location in the flow direction of the granular object, the<br>
sorting signal is outputted such that the sorting action<br>
is directed to the center location of the related image<br>
element.<br>
In the above, a predetermined continuous plurality of<br>
blocks constitute 1 division and, when any one of the<br>
blocks within the division comes to the center location,<br><br>
the sorting signal is outputted to the sorting location<br>
corresponding to such division. Normally, the sorting<br>
means for granular objects is configured such that, for<br>
example, a plurality of ejectors are provided substan-<br>
tially in one line. The divisions each constituting a plu-<br>
rality of blocks are assigned sequentially to the individ-<br>
ual jet air ejecting means from one end to the other end<br>
thereof. When the center location of the defective granu-<br>
lar object exists in any of the plurality of blocks, the<br>
sorting signal is outputted to the jet air ejecting means<br>
corresponding to such division and the jet air ejecting<br>
means is activated accordingly.<br>

The outline of the granular object sorting apparatus<br>
according to the invention is explained with reference to<br>
Figs. 1 and 2. The sorting apparatus explained herein is<br>
one in which, for grains among granular objects, espe-<br>
cially rice grains as materials to be sorted, the sorting<br><br>
or ejection is made for rice grains having colored por-<br>
tions or foreign objects mixed in rice grains. Fig. 1 is a<br>
sectional view diagrammatically showing main elements and<br>
their internal structural arrangement of the granular ob-<br>
ject sorting apparatus. The apparatus is equipped, at its<br>
upper portion thereof, with a rice grain supplying section<br>
4	which has a vibration feeder means 2 and a tank section<br>
3, and a chute 5 which is in an inclined plate-like form<br>
and transfers in a predetermined locus the rice grains<br>
supplied from the vibration feeder means 2. By this chute<br>
5	the rice grains are supplied and released to an optical<br>
detecting section 6 to follow.<br>
The optical detecting section 6 is substantially sym-<br>
metrical with respect to the locus of the rice grains re-<br>
leased from the chute 5, and constitutes a front optical<br>
detection section 6a and a rear optical detection section<br>
6b. Each of the front and the rear optical detection sec-<br>

rice grains, with a visual ray receiving section 7a, 7b<br>
equipped with a CCD sensor having as an image element, for<br>
example, a silicon sensor, and a near infrared ray receiv-<br>
ing section 8a, 8b equipped with an analog sensor consti-<br>
tuted by an InGaAs element. The visual ray receiving sec-<br>
tion 7a, 7b and the near infrared ray receiving section 8a,<br><br>
8b are provided correspondingly to the width direction of<br>
the chute 5. There are also provided illuminating fluores-<br>
cent lamps 9a, 9b and 10a, 10b, illuminating halogen lamps<br>
11a, 11b, and background plates 12a, 12b corresponding to<br>
the respective optical detection sections 6a and 6b. In<br>
the background plates 12a, 12b, there are provided open-<br>
ings 13a, 13b so as not to interrupt the viewing line be-<br>
tween the light receiving sections 8a, 8b and the viewing<br>
point 0. The visual ray receiving section 7 may be config-<br>
ured advantageously by a wide angle camera equipped with a<br>
converging lens.<br>
The sorting section 15 is disposed under the optical<br>
detecting section 6 along the direction in which the rice<br>
grains fall down, and a plurality of nozzles 16 for emit-<br>
ting high speed jet air against the rice grains are pro-<br>
vided in the width direction of the chute 5. To each of<br>
the nozzles 16 is connected a valve 18 which allows the<br>
compressed air to be supplied to the nozzles 16 through<br>
air pipes 17, and the valve 18 is connected to the com-<br>
pressed air supplying means (not illustrated).<br>
The light receiving sections 7 and 8 are connected to<br>
the valve 18 through a control unit 20 explained later,<br>
and the signals received from the rice grains or foreign<br>
objects through the light receiving sections 7, 8 are<br>
processed by the control unit 20. When the defective rice<br><br>
grains having colored portions or the foreign objects are<br>
detected, the signals to activate the related valves 18<br>
are outputted. When the valve 18 is activated accordingly,<br>
the defective rice grains or the foreign objects are<br>
ejected from the grain falling locus by the air jetted<br>
from the nozzle 16 and are discharged from the unaccept-<br>
able object outlet 22. The acceptable grains, that is, the<br>
grains that have not been ejected, are discharged to the<br>
outside from the acceptable object outlet 23 along the<br>
rice grain falling locus.<br>
Fig. 2 is an enlarged view which is seen from the<br>
front side of the chute 5 and which diagrammatically shows<br>
the positions and arrangements of the chute 5, the light<br>
receiving section 7 and the nozzles 16 arranged in the<br>
width direction. The chute 5 is divided into a plurality<br>
of divisions each having, for example, a predetermined<br>
width, and a nozzle 16 is assigned to each division of the<br>
chute 5. The width of the nozzle 16 is preferably 1.5 -<br>
2mm in the case of the rice grains. In this example, in<br>
the light receiving section 7, six light receiving sensor<br>
elements constitute one block, and 4 blocks are assigned<br>
to 1 nozzle. That is, in this example, with the 24 ele-<br>
ments, the quantity of light of the rice grains flowing in<br>
1 division of the chute 5 is received. That is, as to the<br>
image elements, there are 24 image elements in the hori-<br><br>
zontal direction for each nozzle. When the images of the<br>
rice grains are taken, the images are obtained by conduct-<br>
ing the scanning in the perpendicular direction with re-<br>
spect to the flow of the rice grains.<br>
Next, with reference to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the con-<br>
trol unit 20 which processes the signals outputted from<br>
the light receiving sections 7, 8 is explained. The con-<br>
trol unit 20 is equipped with a comparator 25 to which a<br>
threshold value corresponding to the outward form of the<br>
object is inputted, a comparator 26 to which a threshold<br>
value corresponding to a comparatively light tone color (a<br>
first level) is inputted, a comparator 27 to which a<br>
threshold value corresponding to a comparatively heavy<br>
tone color (a second level) is inputted, an image process-<br>
ing board 28 which image-processes the signals from the<br>
above comparators, and a delay circuit 29 in which are<br>
inputted the sorting signals outputted based on the output<br>
signals from the image processing board 28. Other elements<br>
such as an image memory 30 which is necessary for image<br>
processing and a memory circuit 31 which stores the proc-<br>
essing program are of course included in the control unit<br>
20, but they are not described in detail as they may ap-<br>
propriately be designed and provided. Also, as to the CPU<br>
32 and the input/output circuit 33, they may be variously<br>
 designed such as one with which the control is made indi-<br><br>
vidually at the processing stage or one in which the con-<br>
trol is made totally by one CPU, so that only one example<br>
is shown here and no details are illustrated. The valve<br>
circuit 34 is operated by the signals outputted from the<br>
delay circuit 29.<br>
The control unit 20 receives a plurality of image<br>
element signals outputted from the CCD sensor of the light<br>
receiving section 7. The image element signals are respec-<br>
tively forwarded to the comparators 25, 26, 27 and are<br>
binarized by the respective threshold values. Of the bi-<br>
narized signals, the signals from the comparators 26 and<br>
27 are subjected to the defect detection by a defect de-<br>
tecting circuit 40 in the image processing board 28, and<br>
the presence or non-presence of the defect signal is con-<br>
firmed thereat. If any defect signal is detected, the cen-<br>
ter detection by the center detecting circuit 41 is con-<br>
ducted. Fig. 4 (a) shows an example of a digital signal in<br>
which a part thereof is omitted and which is outputted<br>
from the CCD sensor with respect to 1 rice grain. In this<br>
illustrated example, in one rice grain, there is a colored<br>
portion which is of a comparatively light tone color and<br>
is of a wide range color, and also there is a colored por-<br>
tion which is of a comparatively heavy tone color but is<br>
of a small range color. In Fig. 4(a), there are also shown<br>
three levels of the threshold values of the three differ-<br><br>
ent comparators 25, 26 and 27. When the signals as in Fig.<br>
4(a) are inputted to each of the comparators 25, 26, 27,<br>
the signal outputted from each of the comparators 25, 26,<br>
27 becomes the binarized signal as shown in examples of<br>
Figs. 4 (b) , (c) and (d) . The binarized signals thus pro-<br>
duced are sequentially stored in the image memory 30 of<br>
the image processing board 28. The comparators 25, 26, 27<br>
have been shown as separate circuits, but the related<br>
processes may be incorporated into a part of the program<br>
so that they may be conducted at the image processing<br>
board 28.<br>
When the output is an analog signal as in an ordinary<br>
InGaAs sensor, by providing an analog/digital converter<br>
circuit 50 as shown in Fig. 5, the signal processing can<br>
be carried out similarly as in the above control unit 20.<br>
However, the comparator 51 is one in which the fourth<br>
threshold value for sorting out the foreign objects (glass<br>
resin and pebble) is established. It is advantageous if<br>
the comparator 52 is provided with the threshold value set<br>
in advance for detecting the outward form level for the<br>
foreign objects and, by the binarized signal thereof, the<br>
signal is made a signal for specifying the outward form as<br>
in the above.<br>
Now, the image processing by the control unit 20 is<br>
explained with reference to Fig. 6 to Fig. 8. The data<br><br>
outputted from the CCD sensor 7, for example, 12 bits out-<br>
putted in parallel, may be converted to serial data of 8<br>
bits. The data from the CCD sensor 7 thus converted are<br>
subjected to the binarization process by the threshold<br>
values (the first level, the second level) for the colored<br>
portions set in advance at the comparators 26, 27 (Steps<br>
601a, 601b) and to the binarization process by the outward<br>
form threshold value set in advance at the comparator 25<br>
(Step 701). Fig. 6(a) shows only a part of the data ob-<br>
tained by a plurality of scannings and only one example of<br>
the data binarized by the first level. Similarly the data<br>
binarized by the second level are obtained.<br>
Next, the signal processing at the image processing<br>
board 28 (see Fig. 3) is explained. This processing is<br>
performed in accordance with the program stored in advance<br>
in the memory circuit 31 of the image processing board 28.<br>
In the initial setting at the image processing of the data<br>
binarized by the comparator 26 of the first level, the<br>
conditions or ranges of the unacceptable rice grain are<br>
set as follows. That is, the number of continuous image<br>
elements in the scanning direction (horizontal direction)<br>
is 3, and the number of continuous image elements in the<br>
flowing direction (vertical direction) is 2. When this is<br>
applied to Fig. 6(a), the number of continuous image ele-<br>
ments in the horizontal direction at the n'th scanning is<br><br>
5, the same at the n+1 scanning is 7, and the same at the<br>
n+2 is 4 and, at any of these scannings, the number ex-<br>
ceeds the initially set number 3 of the continuous image<br>
elements in the horizontal direction and thus the grain<br>
concerned falls under the unacceptable grains. Also, the<br>
initially set number 2 of the continuous image elements in<br>
the vertical direction is also exceeded so that the aggre-<br>
gation of the image elements detected here are judged as<br>
image elements of the unacceptable grain (Step 602). Fur-<br>
ther, in the example of Fig. 6(b), the number of image<br>
elements continuous in the horizontal direction at the<br>
m'th scanning is 3 so that the initially set number 3 of<br>
the continuous image elements in the horizontal direction<br>
is not exceeded, and no continuous image elements in the<br>
vertical direction are present. Thus the image elements in<br>
aggregation are not judged as those of the unacceptable<br>
grain, and are canceled. In the defective grain image ele-<br>
ment detected in the data binarized by the comparator 27<br>
of the second level, the threshold value is different from<br>
that of the first level and, since the defective image<br>
element represents a heavier tone of color, it is judged<br>
as it is as defective.<br>
Simultaneously with the processing of the binarized<br>
data for the colored portion, the outward form processing<br>
of the rice grain as shown in Fig. 7(a) to Fig. 7(b) is<br><br>
conducted. Fig. 7 (a) shows a signal obtained by the com-<br>
parator 25 of the outward form level. The signal is one in<br>
which the outward form signal of the rice grain has been<br>
subjected to a simple binarizing process (Step 701). The<br>
contracting process of the form is followed. In the con-<br>
tracting process, as shown in Fig. 7(b), the peripheral<br>
image elements in the vertical direction are canceled uni-<br>
formly one by one (Step 702). Then, as shown in Fig. 7(c),<br>
the peripheral image elements in the horizontal direction<br>
are canceled uniformly by 3 image elements at a time (Step<br>
703) . The number of image elements canceled here is not<br>
limited to the examples and may be set optionally. This<br>
process enables the solving of connection with other rice<br>
grain image elements and it is possible to confirm the<br>
outward form of an individual rice grain.<br>
The colored image elements (Fig.6(a)) detected at the<br>
Steps 601a and 601b and the outward image elements (Fig.<br>
7(c)) of the rice grain obtained up to the Step 703 are<br>
completely overlapped with each other (Fig. 7(d)) and, in<br>
this way, the outward form of the colored grain in its<br>
entirety can be confirmed (Step 704).<br>
Next, in the same way of dividing of the sensor ele-<br>
ments of the light receiving section 7 already explained<br>
with reference to Fig. 2 in which the sensor elements are<br>
divided such that, along the width extent of the nozzles<br><br>
16 in the horizontal direction, 6 elements are in 1 block<br>
and 4 blocks are in 1 division, the image processing may<br>
be carried out such that, along the width of the nozzle 16<br>
the entire elements are converted into block units with 6<br>
image elements being treated as 1 block. Even if, within 1<br>
block consisting 6 image elements, 1 defective grain image<br>
element is present, the block concerned in its entirety<br>
becomes the defective block and is subjected to an enlarg-<br>
ing process (Step 705, Fig. 7(e)).<br>
The detection of the center location of the object is<br>
performed in the following ways. First, the detection of<br>
the center location in the horizontal direction is per-<br>
formed such that, based on the data of Fig. 7(e), each<br>
block data is enlarged by being subjected to the OR logic<br>
calculation with the block data of above and below, and<br>
the center in the horizontal direction is obtained by the<br>
pattern matching. When there are even number data in the<br>
horizontal direction, 2 blocks in the center constitute<br>
the center location, and when there are odd number data, 1<br>
block in the center constitutes the center location (Step<br>
706, Fig. 7(f)). Further, the detection of the center lo-<br>
cation in the vertical direction is performed such that,<br>
based on the data of Fig. 7(e), each block data is en-<br>
larged by being subjected to the OR logic calculation with<br>
the block data of right and left, and the center in the<br><br><br>
the vertical direction is obtained by the pattern matching<br>
When there are even number data in the vertical direction,<br>
2 blocks in the center constitute the center location, and<br>
when there are odd number data, 1 block in the center con-<br>
stitutes the center location (Step 707, Fig. 7(g)). In<br>
this way, when the center locations respectively in the<br>
horizontal direction and the vertical direction are calcu-<br>
lated by the logical AND, the 4 blocks (checked pattern<br>
blocks) in the center as shown in Fig. 7(g) are obtained<br>
(Step 708). When the blocks in the center are obtained,<br>
the division in which these blocks exist is determined<br>
(Fig. 7(h)), and the nozzle 16 corresponding to this divi-<br>
sion is determined. The operating signal is sent to the<br>
valve 18 to which the nozzle 16 is connected (Step 709).<br>
The operating signal is outputted such that the jet<br>
air from the nozzle 16 corresponding to the division in<br>
which the block of the calculated center location exists<br>
so that, as in Fig. 7(g), the center block exists in 1<br>
division, the center location is determined as existing in<br>
such division. However, when the center block extends into<br>
2 divisions in the horizontal direction, the operating<br>
signal is sent to the valve 18 so that the air is jetted<br>
out from the two nozzles corresponding to the 2 divisions.<br>
The operation signals for the electromagnetic valve<br>
are sent to the valve 18 after the jet timing is adjusted<br><br><br>
based on the center location of the defective image ele-<br>
ments in the entire image, after the set jet time is added,<br>
after jet timing of the nozzle 16 is set, and after a pre-<br>
determined delay time is adjusted by the delay circuit 29<br>
based on the distance between the light receiving section<br>
7 and the nozzle 16.<br>
The above has explained mainly the processing of the<br>
signals received from the CCD sensor at the light receiv-<br>
ing section 7, but the processing of the signals received<br>
from the InGaAs sensor at the light receiving section 8 is<br>
similarly conducted provided that the sensor has the sat-<br>
isfactory resolution power. As to the detection of foreign<br>
objects, the presence of the foreign object is confirmed<br>
through the binarization by the comparator 51 to which a<br>
fourth level of threshold value is set in advance, and the<br>
outward form of the foreign object is confirmed through<br>
the binarization by the comparator 52 to which the outward<br>
from level is set in advance. Depending on the kinds of<br>
foreign objects, the data binarized by the comparator 51<br>
of the fourth level can be used as it is as the outward<br>
form data. This is because there are no plurality of lev-<br>
els in the tone of color unlike in the colored portions<br>
detected by the CCD sensor.<br>
As above, since the resolution power of the sensor<br>
has been elevated thus enabling to detect colored portions<br><br><br>
of various sizes, and since the size of the colored por-<br>
tion can be specified by the number of image elements, it<br>
is made possible by the elevated resolution power not only<br>
to enhance the precision in the detection of a defective<br>
portion in the form of light tone of color but also to<br>
enable the judging of the size thereof by being able to<br>
count the image elements. Thus, the elevated resolution<br>
power has demonstrated the effects and advantages.<br>
Since the second threshold value has been set for the<br>
judgment of the colored portion in a heavy tone of color,<br>
even such a small defective portion that can be detected<br>
only by the elevation of the resolution power can be<br>
judged as defective by the binarization through the second<br>
threshold value if such defective portion is of a heavy<br>
tone of color, and the granular object concerned is judged<br>
as defective and ejected. Thus, the elevated resolution<br>
power has demonstrated the effects.<br>
After an outward form of a granular object is de-<br>
tected and by laying the image element at the defective<br>
portion over an aggregate of the image elements forming<br>
the outward form of the granular objects, the granular<br>
object having the defective image element is caused to be<br>
recognized as the defective granular object, and the image<br>
element at the center location of the defective granular<br>
object is specified irrespective of the image element lo-<br><br><br>
cation of the defective portion at the image element ag-<br>
gregation of the defective granular objects. In this way,<br>
the sorting signal is outputted so as to act with respect<br>
to the center location of the defective granular object,<br>
corresponding to the image element at the center location<br>
of the specified defective granular object unlike in the<br>
conventional technique in which the sorting action has<br>
been pointed to the defective portion itself of image ele-<br>
ment. Thus, wherever in the granular object the defective<br>
portion of the defective granular object may be present,<br>
it is ensured to ejected a single defective granular ob-<br>
ject concerned.<br>
Only those defective granular objects that will have<br>
substantial influence to the product value are effectively<br>
eliminated. This has been made possible by using a sensor<br>
having a high resolution power so as to detect a defective<br>
portion of a small size, by being able to determine the<br>
presence of defects by counting the number of image ele-<br>
ments of the defective portions which are obtained by es-<br>
tablishing threshold values for defective portions of<br>
light tone of colors, and further by establishing thresh-<br>
old values for defective portions of heavy tone of colors<br>
so that the judgement for defective portions can be made<br>
irrespective of sizes of the defective portions.<br>
Also, in addition to the judgment of defective granu-<br><br><br>
lar objects, it has been made possible to obtain the pre-<br>
cise center location of the defective granular object so<br>
that, irrespective of where the defective portion may be<br>
present in the granular object, the sorting action can be<br>
directed substantially to the center portion of the granu-<br>
lar object so that the chances of involving other granular<br>
objects to be subjected to the sorting action have become<br>
small. Thus, in order to enhance the sorting precision,<br>
the resolution power is elevated so as to be able to sort<br>
out the defective granular objects having a heavily col-<br>
ored portion which, even small in size, has influence to<br>
the product value, and the sorting yield is improved by<br>
not sorting out the granular objects having a defective<br>
portion which is small and only lightly colored thus hav-<br>
ing no influence to the product value.<br>
While the invention has been described in its pre-<br>
ferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the words<br>
which have been used are words of description rather than<br>
limitation and that changes within the purview of the ap-<br>
pended claims may be made without departing from the true<br>
scope of the invention as defined by the claims.<br><br>

than that of the first level. When a defective image ele-<br>
ment signal is detected from the binarized image elements,<br>

of the granular object and the specified defective granu-<br>
lar object image element, and the sorting signal is out-<br>
putted to act on the center location of the defective<br>
granular object corresponding to the image element at the<br>
specified center location. A granular object having a<br>
heavily colored portion which, even small in size, has<br>
influence to the product value can be effectively ejected.<br>
Sorting yield is improved by not sorting out the granular<br>
objects having a defective portion which is small and only<br>
lightly colored thus having no influence to the product<br>
value.</td>
