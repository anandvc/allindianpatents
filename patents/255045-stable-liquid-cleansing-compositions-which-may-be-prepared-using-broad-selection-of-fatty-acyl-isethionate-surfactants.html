STABLE LIQUID CLEANSING COMPOSITIONS WHICH MAYBE PREPARED USING BROAD SELECTION OF FATTY ACYL ISETHIONATE SURFACTANTS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2008/074617	PCT/EP2007/063128<br>
1<br>
STABLE LIQUID CLEANSING COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING FATTY ACYL<br>
ISETHIONATE SURFACTANTS<br>
  FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to personal care skin or hair liquid cleansing compositions. In particular, it relates to such personal care skin or hair cleansing compositions<br>
  comprising fatty acyl isethionate surfactants.  Such commercially available surfactant products comprise a mixture of fatty acyl isethionates and free fatty acid, although no free fatty acid may be present.  The compositions of the invention are stable regardless of what<br>
  type of fatty acyl isethionates is used.  The invention is<br>
further directed to a method of providing stability for such compositions comprising a broad array of acyl isethionate surfactant.<br>
       In  another  embodiment of  the invention, the invention is directed to where fatty acyl isethionates must have at least 10% fatty acid in the surfactant product, regardless of how much additional fatty acid is added as modifier.  In this embodiment, total fatty acid is at least 10%,<br>
preferably at least 15% by wt. (10 to 55% by wt. contributed from fatty acyl isethionate surfactant product plus 0 to 14% by wt. fatty acid added as modifier).<br><br>
WO 2008/074617	PCTYEP2007/063128<br>
2<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fatty acyl isethionates (e.g., cocoyl isethionates) are anionic surfactants highly desirable in personal care skin 5  or hair cleansing products, particularly in personal care<br>
products, because they lather well, are mild to the skin and have good emollient properties.  Typically, fatty acid isethionates are produced by esterification of fatty acids or by reaction of fatty acid chloride having carbon chain<br>
  	length of CB to C20 with isethionate.  A typical surfactant product containing fatty acyl isethionate may contain about 30 to 95 wt.%, preferably 45 to 90% by wt. fatty acyl isethionates and 0 to 40 wt.% free fatty acid, in addition to isethionates salts, typically at less than 5%, and trace<br>
  (less than 2 wt.%) of other impurities.<br>
A persistent problem with the ready use of fatty acyl isethionates in liquid compositions, however, has been the low solubility of these compounds in water.  This is<br>
especially true for fatty acyl isethionate surfactant<br>
products containing high level of free fatty acid (10% by wt. or higher) and/or long chain fatty acyl isethionates (e.g., C14 and higher).  The fatty acyl isethionate component tends to form insoluble surfactant crystals with the amount<br>
of crystals depending strongly on the storage temperature due to the wide range of dissolution temperatures of these crystals.  This in turn may result in unstable liquid cleansers which exhibit very thick or very thin consistency at low and elevated temperatures.<br><br>
3<br>
It would therefore be of tremendous advantage to have compositions having consistent viscosity; as well as a way of manipulating compositional ingredients to ensure such consistent viscosity is obtained and that fatty acyl 5  isethionate product, no matter what their free fatty acid content or their chain lengths, can be readily used.  The present invention provides precisely such compositions and processes for making such compositions.<br>
       Specifically, the invention recognizes that the problem of  inconsistent viscosity can be resolved by  converting part or all of the fatty acyl isethionate surfactant crystals to surfactant liquid crystals wherein the liquid crystals occupy sufficient phase volume to ensure stability, said<br>
  stability being defined by the absence of visible physical separation after two weeks of storage at 40CC.  This is accomplished by using a specific combination of liquid crystal modifiers (e.g., fatty acids, fatty alcohols); and sufficiently high levels of a surfactant liquid crystal<br>
  inducer (e.g., alkanoiamide, alkylamineoxide) as a percent of total fatty acyl isethionate plus synthetic surfactant. The specific combination of liquid crystal inducer and liquid crystal modifier creates a consistent viscosity which allows fatty acyl isethionates product, regardless of free<br>
fatty acid content or chain length of isethionates, to be storage stable.<br>
Acyl isethionate liquids do exist in the art.  U.S. Patent No. 5,415,810 to Lee et al., for example, discloses 30  compositions comprising fatty acyl isethionates and<br>
zwitterionic surfactant (e.g., cocoamidopropyl betaines),<br><br>
4<br>
presumably to help solubilize the isethionate and make an isotropic liquid.  The reference separately teaches away from use of both alkanolamides (column 1, lines 27-30), and use of free fatty acids, especially longer chain fatty acids 5  (column 2, lines 34-39), let alone the use of both specifically in combination.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,739,365 to Brody et al. and U.S. Publication U.S. 2004/0224863 both disclose use of ammonium 10  counterion to help solubilize fatty acid isethionate.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,132,037 to Greene et al. (and related U.S. Patent No. 5,234,619 and U.S. Patent No. 5,290,471) disclose compositions with C3 to C22 acyl isethionates,<br>
synthetics, and free fatty acid, preferably C16 or higher. The liquid crystal inducers (e.g., alkanolamide) of the subject invention are not disclosed, nor is a process to use both liquid crystal modifiers and liquid crystal inducers specifically together to provide long term stability of acyl<br>
isethionates.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,952,286 and U.S. Patent No. 6,077,816, both to Puvvada, disclose liquid cleansing compositions which may contain acyl isethionates and which<br>
comprise soluble, lamellar phase inducing strueturant (e.g., branched fatty acid).  While amides may be optionally used in a long recitation of optional ingredients, there is no teaching or disclosure that they need be used; that they must be used in combination with liquid crystal modifier to<br>
  	consistently enhance stability of acyl isethionate; let<br>
alone that they must be used in certain minimal amounts.  It<br><br>
5<br>
is noted that the lamellar inducing structurants claimed in the Puvvada patents are branched fatty acids or branched fatty alcohols such as isostearic acid or isostearic alcohol.  According to the subject invention straight chain 5  fatty acids and/or straight chain fatty alcohols must form the predominant amount of fatty acid and/or alcohol (e.g., modifier) which are used in combination with alkanolamide. In fact, branched liquid fatty acid and/or branched fatty alcohol are not required at all in the subject invention. 10  If used, however, the amount should be limited to no more than 30 wt%, preferably no more than 20 wt%, even more preferably 10% or less of total fatty acids and/or fatty alcohols in the liquid composition of the invention.<br>
       None of the references, alone or together, teach or<br>
suggest compositions comprising acyl isethionate where acyl isethionate/fatty acid crystals are converted in part, or completely, to a surfactant liquid crystal using specific combinations of high levels of liquid crystal inducer (e.g.,<br>
  alkanolamide) and liquid crystal modifier (e.g.,<br>
predominantly straight chain fatty acid) in order to provide acyl isethionate containing liquids, regardless of the fatty acid content or fatty acid chain length of the acyl isethionates surfactant; which compositions have a product<br>
  viscosity less sensitive to temperature, and which<br>
compositions are stable at both low and elevated temperature storage conditions.<br><br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to 5  novel liquid cleansing compositions which are formed by<br>
combination of (a) surfactant liquid Crystal inducers, which helps formation of liquid crystals rather than solid crystals; and (b) liquid crystal modifier.<br>
       More specifically, in one embodiment the invention comprises liquid cleansing composition^ comprising:<br>
(a)	1 to 30%, preferably 3 to 25% by wt. fatty acyl<br>
isethionates (fatty acid salts and free fatty<br>
	acids are not counted here but as part of<br>
component (d) below);<br>
(b)	1 to 30%, preferably 3% to 2$% by wt. of a co-<br>
surfactant selected fr om the group consisting of<br>
	anionic surfactants, nonioni^ surfactants,<br>
amphoteric surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof;<br>
(c)	0.5 to 10%, preferably 1.0 tO 8% by wt. of a<br>
            surfactant liquid crystal inducer which, when<br>
added in liquid crystal inducing amount, ensures that a liquid cleanser composition comprising (a) and (b) forms a liquid crystal phase at typical storage conditions; 30<br><br><br>
said liquid crystal inducer used at a level of &gt;10%, preferably &gt;15%, more preferably &gt;20% by wt. of the total amount of fatty isethionate (a) and co-surfactant (b) combined;<br>
(d)  0.5 to 14% of a liquid crystal modifier selected from the group consisting of straight chain fatty acids; or a mixture of straight chain fatty acids with straight chain fatty alcohols and/or<br>
		aliphatic hydrocarbon oils (i.e., straight chain<br>
acids must be used and they may be used alone or in combination with the alcohols and/or hydrocarbon oils);  The liquid crystal modifier is used at a level of at least 10%, preferably 20 wt%<br>
		of fatty acyl isethionates (a) (i.e., of the<br>
molecule, not the product) and synthetic co-surfactants (b) combined; the modifier is believed needed to ensure proper surfactant liquid crystal size (e.g., if domain size is  too large,<br>
		stability may be compromised);<br>
wherein said liquid cleansing composition includes<br>
some portion in a surfactant liquid crystalline<br>
phase, as recognized by characteristic patterns<br>
		observed via optical microscopy, or other<br>
established physical tests (e.g., x-ray diffraction);<br>
wherein the shape of the thermal trace in a<br>
		differential scanning colourimetry (DSC)<br>
experiment, by the method described below, is such<br><br><br>
that more than 50% of the transition enthalpy<br>
between 5° and 60°C occurs in the window between 5°<br>
to 35°C, preferably between 5° to 30°C (a<br>
reflection of the fact that sufficient surfactant<br>
5	is in liquid crystalline phase);<br>
wherein said composition is stable (i.e., is physically stable and will not partition as can be visually observed) at 40°C for at least 2 weeks. 10<br>
It should be noted that the acyl isethionate surfactant of (a) and possibly (although not necessarily) some amount of fatty acid are brought into the final composition depending on what is the starting acyl isethionates 15  "product".  Thus, the starting "product" may be pure<br>
surfactant and contain no fatty acid, or it may comprise a mixture of acyl isethionates surfactant and fatty acids.<br>
It should be further noted that if a product comprising 20  surfactant and fatty acids is used, th§ amount of surfactant or fatty acids in the final composition is less than the amount of these ingredients in the starting product.  For example, without intending to limit th§ invention, if 10% surfactant in the final composition is desired, this might 25  come from a starting product which is I)ove© cleansing bar noodles, a mixture of DEFI flakes, fatty acids and fatty soaps as described in more detail below.  Typically, such noodles comprise about 50% acyl isethionates surfactant along with fatty  acid soap.  Thus, to obtain 10% 30  surfactant, about 20% noodles would be used.  Therefore, if the surfactant has 35% fatty acid content, this results in<br><br>
9<br>
about 7% (20% of 35%) fatty acid in final composition (counted as part of item (d)).  As note^, at 50% surfactant content, this results in about 10% (20% of 50%) fatty acyl isethionates (counted as part of item (^)).  As indicated, 5  these examples are merely illustrative.<br>
In a second embodiment, the invention relates to a process for making such compositions using acyl isethionate, co-surfactant, liquid crystal inducer and liquid crystal 10  modifier as noted above.<br>
The invention further relates to a method of ensuring liquid compositions comprising 1% to 30%fatty acyl isethionate surfactant can be formed regardless of the 15  source of the fatty isethionates, that is to say, regardless of the fatty acid content of the fatty acid isethionates surfactant starting product and/or of the chain length of the fatty acyl group.<br>
20       In another embodiment, the invention comprises liquid compositions comprising:<br>
(a)  1 to 50%, preferably 4 to 40% by wt. fatty acyl<br>
isethionates surfactant product,<br>
		wherein said product contains io to 55, preferably<br>
15 to 40% free fatty acid and/0r fatty acid salt; such product will also contain, about 30 to 90% fatty acyl isethionates;<br>
       (b)  1 to 30%, preferably 3% to 25% by wt. of a co-surfactant selected from the group consisting of<br><br><br>
anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof;<br>
5       (c)  0.5 to 10%, preferably 1.0 to 8% by wt. of a<br>
surfactant liquid crystal inducer which, when<br>
added in liquid crystal inducinq amount, ensures<br>
that a liquid cleanser composition comprisinq (a)<br>
and (b) forms a liquid crystal phase at typical<br>
		storaqe conditions;<br>
said liquid crystal inducer used at a level of<br>
&gt;10%, preferably &gt;15%, more preferably ^20% by wt.<br>
of the total amount of fatty isethionate (a) and<br>
		co-surfactant (b) combined;<br>
(d)  0 to 10%, preferably 1 to 10% of a liquid crystal modifier selected from the group consisting of straight chain fatty acid, straight chain fatty<br>
		alcohols, aliphatic hydrocarbon oils and mixtures<br>
thereof of above.  The liquid crystal modifier, i.e. aliphatic hydrocarbon oil, straight chain fatty alcohol and straight fatty acid/fatty soap of item a and item d, is used at a level of at<br>
		least 15%, preferably 20 wt% of the fatty acyl<br>
isethionates (the molecule, not the product) and synthetic co-surfactants (b) combined; the modifier is believed needed to ensure proper surfactant liquid crystal size (e.g., if domain<br>
		size is  too large, stability may be compromised),<br><br>
WO 2008/074617<br><br>
11<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063128<br><br>
wherein said liquid cleansing composition includes<br>
some portion in a surfactant liquid crystalline<br>
phase, as recognized by characteristic patters<br>
observed via optical microscopy, or other<br>
		established physical tests (e.g., x-ray<br>
diffraction);<br>
wherein the shape of the thermal trace in a differential scanning colourimetry (DSC)<br>
		experiment, by the method described below, is such<br>
that more than 50% of the transition enthalpy between 5° and 60°C occurs in the window between 5° to 35°C, preferably between 5° to 30°C (a reflection of the fact that sufficient surfactant<br>
			is in liquid crystal phase);<br>
wherein said composition is stable (i.e., is physically stable and will not partition as can be visually observed) at A0°C  for  at least 2 weeks. 20<br>
It should be noted for component (d) above that the amount can be 0% because at least some amount of fatty acid (i.e., modifier) will be brought in with component (a), an acyl isethionate containing at least 10%, as high as 55%, 25  fatty acid.<br>
It should also be noted that the fatty acid which is part of the surfactant product (a) typically is present in the final composition in an amount less than the amount of 30  such fatty acid in the starting product.  For example,<br>
without intending to limit in any way, if 10% surfactant in<br><br>
12<br>
the final composition is desired, this might come from starting product which is Dove© cleansing bar noodles, a mixture of DEFI flakes, fatty acid and fatty soaps described in more detail below. 5<br>
Typically such noodles comprise about 50% acyl isethionate surfactant, along with fatty acids and soap. Thus, to obtain the 10% surfactant, about 20% noodles would be used.  Therefore, if the surfactant has 35% fatty acid 10  content, this results in about 7% (20% of 35%) fatty acid in final composition.  As indicated this is merely an illustrative example.<br>
These and other aspects, features and advantages will<br>
15  become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a reading of the following detailed description and the appended claims.  For the avoidance of doubt, any feature of one aspect of the present invention may be utilized in any other aspect of the invention.  It is noted that the<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 is a differential scanning colourimetry (DSC) 15  curve of a fatty acid isethionate solution typically used in preparing liquid DEFI compositions compared to Example 2 of the invention.  The figure shows DEFI solution has a crystal transition peak around 38°C compared to lower crystal transition peak of inventive example. 20<br>
Figure 2 is DSC method measured using the first defined protocol and showing how the peak may be masked by the water melting (e.g., for example 27).  In such case, a second protocol must be used. 25<br>
Figure 3 is a second DSC protocol used so that the peak can be seen (e.g., again for example 27).<br>
Figure 4b is an optical micrograph of surfactant liquid 30  crystal composition where sufficient liquid crystal modifier has been added to have a sufficiently large phase volume of<br><br>
14<br>
liquid crystal phase to provide good phase stability. Figure 4a shows the liquid crystal domain without sufficient surfactant liquid crystal modifier and which is therefore subject to visible phase separation.<br>

(d)	0.5 to 14% by wt. liquid crystal modifier which is<br>
straight chain fatty acids  alone or is straight<br>
chain fatty acid in combination with straight<br>
chain alcohol and/or aliphatic hydrocarbon oil,<br>

of isethionates (a) (the molecule, not the surfactant product) and synthetic (b) combined;<br>
wherein said liquid cleansing composition includes<br>
20	some portion in a surfactant liquid crystalline<br>
phase, as  recognized by characteristic patterns observed via optical microscopy, or other established tests such as x-ray diffraction;<br>

30	window between 5° to 35°C, preferably between 5 to<br>
30°C;<br><br><br>
16<br>
wherein said composition is stable (i.e., is physically stable and will not partition as can be observed visually) at &gt;40°C for at least 2 weeks. 5<br>
The invention further relates to method of providing stability by mixing said components.<br>
In another embodiment,   the invention comprises liquid 10  cleansing compositions comprising:<br>
(a)	1 to 50% by wt. fatty acyl isethionates surfactant<br>
product, wherein said  surfactant product<br>
comprises about 30-90% alkali metal fatty acid<br>
15	isethionate and about 10% to 55% free fatty acid<br>
and/or fatty acid salt;<br>
(b)	1 to 30% by wt. co-surfactant;<br>
(c)	0.5 to 10% by wt. surfactant liquid crystal<br>

Definitions<br>
For purposes of this invention, a fatty acyl 5  isethionate "product" comprises (in addition to other<br>
components) both pure acyl isethionates surfactant as well as free fatty acid and/or fatty acid salt.<br>
10  Fatty Acyl Isethionate Surfactant<br>
In one embodiment compositions of the invention comprise 1 to 30% by wt., preferably 3 to 25% by wt. fatty acyl isethionate. 15<br>
In a second embodiment, the compositions comprise 1 to 50% by wt., preferably 4 to 40% by wt. fatty acyl isethionate product.<br>
20       Fatty acyl isethionates surfactant are typically<br>
prepared by the reaction of an isethionates salt such as alkali metal isethionates and an aliphatic fatty acid having 8 to 20 carbon atoms and Iodine Value (measuring degree of unsaturation) of less than 20 g, for example:<br>
25<br>
HOR'SO3M + RCOOH -RCOOR1So3H<br>
where R1 is an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing 2 to 4 carbons;<br>
30<br><br>
19<br>
M is alkali metal cation or metal ion (e.g., sodium, magnesium, potassium, lithium), ammonium or substituted ammonium cation or other counterion; and<br>
5       R is an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 7 to 24, preferably 8 to 22 carbons.<br>
Depending on the processing conditions used, the resulting fatty acyl isethionate product can be a mixture of<br>
10  45 to 95% by weight of fatty acyl isethionates (as noted<br>
above,   this is  what provides  the 1-30% recited as  component (a) for the first embodiment, for example) and 40 to about 0 wt% of free fatty acids, in addition to isethionates salts, typically less than 5 wt.%, and trace (less than 2 wt.%) of<br>
15  other impurities.  Generally a mixture of aliphatic fatty acids is used for the preparation of commercial fatty acyl isethionates surfactants.  In the subject invention, it is preferred that the resulting fatty acyl isethionate surfactants (e.g., resulting from reaction of alkali metal<br>
20  isethionate and aliphatic fatty acid) have at least 20 wt% (on basis of fatty acyl isethionates reaction product) of fatty acyl group with 14 or more carbon atoms so that they form insoluble surfactant crystals in vater at ambient temperature, and at least 16 wt.% of f&amp;tty acids with 14 or<br>
25  greater carbon atoms so that they also form insoluble surfactant crystals in water at ambient temperature. Formation of insoluble surfactant crystals can be determined using an optical microscope, or by measuring the crystal transition temperature of a 15 wt% fatty acyl isethionate<br>
30  aqueous solution with a pH in the rang^ of 6.5 to 7.5 using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method described<br><br>
20<br>
below.  A fatty acyl isethionate surfactant solution formed by the above reaction typically has a thermal transition above 30°C and below 60°C.   A typical DSC thermal trace of fatty acyl isethionate solution is shown in Figure 1.   (top 5  graph designated "DEFI Solution").  A key aspect of the<br>
present invention is that specific liquid inducers can shift the position of the thermal transition in the thermal trace to below 35°C, preferably below 30°C where a surfactant liquid crystal phase can be formed, as shown in Figure 1 for 10  Example 2 of this invention (Composition of Example 2 is given in Table 1)-<br>
More specifically, the shape of the thermal trace by the DSC experiment is such that 50% of the transition<br>
15  enthalpy between 5 and 60°C occurs in the window between 5 and 35°C, preferably between 5° and 30°C.  We refer to this requirement of the transition enthalpy curve or trace in the DSC experiment as criteria for thermally trace.  The resulting fatty acyl isethionate containing liquid cleansing<br>
20  composition is far more stable. ■ In other words, without wishing to be bound by theory, by shifting the thermal transition of the acyl isethionate surfactant (actually of acyl isethionate and co-surfactant as described below), liquid crystals are far more readily formed and this enables<br>
25  the consistent use of material in a liquid composition which previously could not be readily used.  This is particularly unexpected in compositions, such as those of the second embodiment of the invention, where starting isethionate product has 15 to 55% fatty acid associated with it.<br><br>
21<br>
Particularly preferred fatty acyl isethionate products (including phase with 10% or more fatty acid) which may be consistently used include DEFI (Direct Esterification of Fatty Isethionate) flakes and synthetic detergent noodles 5  produced from DEFI for personal cleanser application.  DEFI flakes typically contain about 65 to 80 wt% of sodium fatty acyl isethionate and 15 to 30 wt% free fatty acids.  More than 65 wt% of fatty acyl group of the resulting fatty acyl isethionates have 12 to 18 carbon atoms.  Dove® cleansing<br>
10  bar noodles are mixtures of DEFI flakes described above and long chain (mainly C16 and CIS) fatty acids and fatty soaps which contain about 40 to 60 wt% of fatty acyl isethionates and 25 to 40 wt% of fatty acids and fatty soaps.  Examples of other commercial fatty acyl isethionates that may be used<br>
15  in this invention are Hostapon© surfactants from Clariant such as Hostapon® SCI85, Hostapon© SCI-78C, or Hostapon© 3CI65C; Jordapon® surfactants from 3ASF such as Jordapon© CI prill or Jordapon® CI65; and sodium cocoyl isethionate from Yongan Daily Chemical Co. such as YA-SCI-85® or YA-SCI-65®.<br>
20<br>
As indicated, these fatty acyl isethionate products have not typically been used in preparation of personal liquid compositions because they readily form solid crystals (when used alone and/or with co-surfactant) and consequently<br>
25  make it very difficult to form stable liquids.<br>
The amount of fatty acyl isethionates surfactants used in the liquid cleanser compositions of the present invention can be in the range of 1 up to 30 wt%, preferably 3  to 25 30  wt% of the liquid composition.  The preferred level depends on the total amount of fatty acyl isethionates surfactants<br><br>
22<br>
and other synthetic co-surfactants in the liquid cleanser of the present invention.  The amount used should comprise of 20 to 90 wt%, preferably 40 to 80 wt% of this total amount of combined fatty acyl isethionates surfactant, and the 5  synthetic co-surfactants described below.<br>
Synthetic co-surfactants<br>
10       A second component of the subject invention are<br>
surfactants selected from the groups consisting of anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants as described below.  Such synthetic co-surfactants are believed to solubilize or partially<br>
15  solubilize fatty acyl isethionate surfactant described<br>
above.  The amount of synthetic co-surfactant used in the present invention can be in the range of 1 to 30, preferably 3 to 2 5 wt% depending on the level of fatty acyl isethionate surfactant in the liquid composition. The amount of co-<br>
20  surfactant in the liquid composition should also be 10 to 80 wt% preferably 20 to 60 wt% of total weight of fatty acyl isethionates and synthetic co-surfactants of the liquid cleanser composition combined.<br>
25       The anionic surfactant may be, for example, an<br>
aliphatic sulfonate, such as a primary alkane (e.g., C8-C22) sulfonate, primary alkane (e.g., C8-C22)   disulfonate, C8-C22 alkene sulfonate, C8-C22 hydroxyalkane sulfonate or alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonate (AGS); or an aromatic sulfonate<br>
30  such as alkyl benzene sulfonate.<br><br>
WO 2008/074617	PC T/EP200 7/063128<br>
23<br>
The anionic may also be an alkyl sulfate (e.g., C12-C-13 alkyl sulfate) or alkyl ether sulfate (including alkyl glyceryl ether sulfates).  Among the alkyl ether sulfates are those having the formula: 5<br>
RO(CH2CH20)nS03M<br>
wherein R is an alkyl or alkenyl having 8 to 18 carbons, preferably 12 to 18 carbons, n has an average 10       value of greater than at least 0.5; preferably between 2 and 3; and M is a solubilizing cation such as sodium, potassium, ammonium or substituted ammonium.  Ammonium and sodium lauryl ether sulfates are preferred.<br>
15       The anionic may also be alkyl sulfosuccinates<br>
(including mono- and dialkyl, e.g., C6-C22 sulfosuccinates); alkyl and acyl taurates, alkyl and acyl sarcosinates, alkyl and acyl glycinates, alkyl sulfoacetate£/ C3-C22 alkyl phosphates, alkyl phosphate esters and ^lkoxyl alkyl<br>
20  phosphate esters, acyl lactates, C3-C22 rnonoalkyl succinates and maleates, and branched acyl isethionates.<br>
If starting with acyl isethionate product having more than 10% fatty acid (as in second embodiment), additional 25  fatty acyl isethionate with less than 10% fatty acid (e.g., Jordapon CI® with less than 8 wt. % fatty" acid) may be used.<br>
Another class of anionics are carboxylates such as follows: 30<br>
R- (CH2CH20)nC02M<br><br>
24<br>
wherein R is C3 to C2o alkyl; n is 1 to 20; and M is as defined above.<br>
5       Another carboxylate which can be used is amido alkyl polypeptide carboxylates such as, for example, Monteine LCQ(R&gt; by Seppic.<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants are exemplified by those which 10  can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic<br>
quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, and sulfonium compounds, in which the aliphatic radicals can be straight or branched chain, and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms and one 15  contains an  anionic group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate,<br>
sulfate, phosphate, or phosphonate.  A general formula for these compounds is:<br>
(R-)x<br>
20	1<br>
R2-Y,+ )-CH2-R-Z(-)<br>
wherein R2 contains an alkyl, alkenyl, or hydroxy alkyl 25       radical of from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, from 0 to about 10 ethylene oxide moieties and from 0 to about 1 glyceryl moiety; Y is selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms; R3 is an alkyl or mononydroxyalkyl group containing about 30       1 to about 3 carbon atoms; X is 1 when Y is a sulfur<br>
atom, and 2 when Y is a nitrogen or phosphorus atom; R^ is an alkylene or hydroxyalkylene of from about 1 to<br><br>
?s<br>
about 4 carbon atoms and Z is a radical selected from the group consisting of carboxylate, sulfonate/ sulfate, phosphonate, and phosphate groups.<br>
Amphoteric detergents which may be used in this invention include at least one acid group.  This may be a 10  carboxylic or a sulphonic acid group.  They include<br>
quaternary nitrogen and therefore are quaternary amido acids.  They should generally include an alkyl or alkenyl group of 7 to 18 carbon atoms.  They will usually comply with an overall structural formula:<br>
15<br>
0	R2<br>
R1 - [-C-NH(CH2)n-]m-N+-X-Y<br>
20	R3<br>
where R" is alkyl or alkenyl of 7 to 18 carbon atoms;<br>
25       R2 and R3 are each independently alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or carboxyaikyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms;<br>
n is 2 to 4;<br>
30       m is 0 to 1;<br><br>
26<br>
X is alkylene of 1 to 3 carbon atoms optionally substituted with hydroxyl, and<br>
Y is -CO2- or -SO3-5<br>
Amphoacetates and diamphoacetates are also intended to be covered in possible zwitterionic and/or amphoteric compounds which may be used.<br>
10       The nonionic which may be used includes in particular the reaction products of  compounds having a hydrophobic group and a reactive hydrogen atom, for example aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols with alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide either alone or with<br>
15  propylene oxide.  Specific nonionic detergent compounds are alkyi (C6-C22) phenols-ethylene oxide condensates, the condensation products of aliphatic (Cs-Cis) primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, and products made by condensation of ethylene oxide with the<br>
20  reaction products of propylene oxide and ethylenediamine. Other so-called nonionic detergent compounds include long chain tertiary amine oxides, long chain tertiary phosphine oxides and dialkyl sulphoxides.<br>
25       The nonionic may also be a sugar amide, such as a<br>
polysaccharide amide.  Specifically, the surfactant may be one of the lactobionamides described in U.S. Patent No. 5,389,279 to Au et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference or it may be one of the sugar amides described in<br>
30  Patent No. 5,009,814 to Kelkenberg, hereby incorporated into the subject application by reference.<br><br>
27<br>
Other surfactants which may be used are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,723,325 to Parran Jr. and alkyl polysaccharide nonionic surfactants as disclosed in U.S. 5  Patent No. 4,565,647 to Llenado, both of which are also incorporated into the subject application by reference.<br>
Preferred alkyl polysaccharides are alkylpolygiycosides of the formula<br>
10<br>
R20(C-,H2..0)c (glycosyl)<br>
wherein R2 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkylphenyl, hydroxyalkyl, hydroxyalkylphenyl,<br>
15       and mixtures thereof in which alkyl groups contain from about 10 to about 18, preferably from about 12 to about 14, carbon atoms; n is 0 to 3, preferably 2; t is from 0 to about 10, preferably 0; and x is from 1.3 to about 10, preferably from 1.3 to about 2.7.  The glycosyl is<br>
20       preferably derived from glucose.  To prepare these<br>
compounds, the alcohol or alkylpolyethoxy alcohol is formed first and then reacted with glucose, or a source of glucose, to form the glucoside (attachment at the 1-position).  The additional glycosyl units can then be<br>
25       attached between their 1-position and the preceding<br>
glycosyl units 2-, 3-, 4- and/or 6-position, preferably predominantly the 2-position.<br>
Other surfactants which may be used are described in 30  U.S. Pat. No. 3, 723,325 to Parran Jr. and "Surface Active Agents and Detergents" (Vol. I &amp; II) by Schwartz, Perry &amp;<br><br>
28<br>
Berch, both of which are also incorporated into the subject application by reference.<br>
Surfactant Liquid Crystal Inducers 5<br>
Another essential ingredient of  the present invention are the alkanoamides, alkylamineoxides or mixture of the above which function as surfactant liquid crystal inducer. The surfactant liquid crystal inducer is believed to be<br>
10  solubilized in the mixture of fatty acyl isethionates and<br>
synthetic cosurfactants as  described above and  to  change  the packing of surfactant micelles.  Specifically, the inducer is believed to convert all or part of the fatty acyl isethionates and synthetic co-surfactants mixture to<br>
15  lamellar liquid crystals in the liquid cleanser composition of the invention.  The fact that surfactant liquid crystals are induced in the cleanser composition of this invention can be confirmed by formation of thermal transition peak at a temperature between 5° to 35CC, preferably between 5° to<br>
20  30°C, measured using the DSC method described below (compared to peaks typically formed at higher temperatures when inducer  is not used, as seen in Figure 1).  A peak in the thermal trace at the relatively lower temperature is believed due to the formation of a  surfactant liquid<br>
25  crystal phase when sufficient amount of surfactant liquid crystal inducer is added.  The amount of liquid crystal inducer in the present invention can be 0.5 to 10 wt% of the liquid composition depending on total amount of fatty acyl isethionates and synthetic co-surfactants in the liquid<br>
30  composition. Specifically it should be at least 10 wt%,<br><br>
29<br>
preferably 15 wt%, most preferably 20 wt% of the total fatty acyl isethionates and synthetic co-surfactants.<br>
Both the level and the composition of the liquid 5  crystal inducers required in the liquid composition of this invention can be determined by measuring the said cleanser composition of this invention containing various amount of liquid crystal inducer using the DSC method described below. It should be noted that a composition may have transition<br>
10  enthalpy peaks at temperatures both below and above 35°C.  As noted, the  cleanser composition of this invention (aqueous solution (e.g., isethionate plus co-surfactant plus inducer)) should meet the criteria for the thermal trace, i.e., have a thermal trace in the DSC experiment such that<br>
15  more than 50% of the transition enthalpy between 5° and 60°C occurs in the window between 5° and 35°C, preferably between 5° and 30°C.  More preferably, more than 50% of the transition enthalpy between 5° and 60°C should occur in the window between 5° and 35°C.  Even more preferably, more than<br>
2 0  60% (theoretically, there is no upper limit) of the<br>
transition enthalpy between 5° and 60°C occurs in the window between 5° and 30°C.<br>
When such conditions are met, this indicates that the 25  type and amount of inducer and amount of modifier, as discussed below, have been correctly selected and the cleansing composition will be stable, i.e., not show visible signs of physical separation for at least two weeks, preferably at least 4 weeks when stored at 40°C.  The DSC 30  curves of a cleanser composition without inducer compared to<br><br>
30<br>
a composition of the invention with inducer (Example 2) are both shown in Figure i.<br>
Examples of liquid crystal inducing compounds which may 5  be used include but are not limited to alkanolamides such as mono- and di-ethanolamides, N-methyl-monoethanolamide, isopropanolamides of fatty acids having about 10 to 20 carbon atoms, and PPG-hydroxyethyl cocamides ; and alkylamineoxide with carbon chain length in the range of 10<br>
10  to 20. Specific examples of suitable compounds include<br>
cocomonoethanolamide, cocodiethanolamide, lauryl mono/or di ethanol amide, coco mono/or di isopropanolamide, lauryl mono/or di ethanolamide, myristyl mono/or di ethanolamide, cocoyl N-methyl-monoethanolamide, cocoylamineoxide,<br>
15  laurylamineoxide, myristylamineoxide, and polypropylene glycol-2-hydroxyethyl cocoamide.  Particularly useful ingredients for this invention are cocomono or diethanol amide, lauryl mono/or di ethanol amide, lauryl amine oxide and coco amine oxide.<br>
20<br>
Liquid Crystal Modifier<br>
A fourth critical ingredient of the liquid cleanser composition of this invention is surfactant liquid crystal<br>
25  modifier.  These modifiers include straight chain fatty<br>
acids alone; or mixture of straight chain fatty acids, with either straight chain fatty alcohols and/or aliphatic hydrocarbons.  These ingredients are believed critical to increase the liquid viscosity and to achieve its storage<br>
30  stability at both ambient and elevated temperatures due to<br><br>
31<br>
the formation of more surfactant liquid crystal phase than if these modifiers were not present.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed 5  that the liquid crystal phase present is lamellar phase and the lamellar phase is present at least in part in the form of vesicles, wherein the liquid crystal modifier is believed to alter the size of the vesicles such that at least some portion of the vesicles are smaller than 5 microns.  It is 10  believed that vesicles smaller than 5 microns, preferably<br>
smaller than 2 microns impart greater physical stability to the cleansing composition.<br>
It is known that surfactant liquid crystals generally 15  {such as the ones induced by mixture of fatty acyl<br>
isethionate, synthetic co-surfactant and alkanolamide/or alkylamineoxide according to the subject invention) can have various size and shapes.  However, to achieve combination of high viscosity and simultaneously good product stability at 20  various storage conditions, an adequate phase volume of<br>
surfactant liquid crystal lamellar vesicles are believed to be needed.  Optical microscopy cannot determine the phase volume of the surfactant liquid crystal phase; however, this technique can be used to determine whether lamellar liquid 25  crystals have been formed by observation using a high<br>
magnification optical microscope with cross-polarized light setting.<br>
Under the cross polarized light optical microscope, 30  these liquid crystals appear as shiny domains.  There are<br>
regular patterns that define lamellar liquid crystal phase,<br><br>
32<br>
as noted in the literature by Rosevear, Journal of the Oil Chemists' Society (1954), Vol. 31, page 628 (which reference is hereby incorporated by reference into the subject application}.  Examples of a typical surfactant liquid 5  crystal optical micrograph are shown in Figures 4a and 4b<br>
without or with sufficient amount of liquid crystal modifier respectively.  Figure 4a, without the liquid crystal modifier , represents comparative example D of Table 2 and shows large irregular liquid crystal domains.  The<br>
10  composition is not stable at ambient temperature, since it is believed that stability requires the presence of some portion  of the liquid crystals to be vesicles 5 microns or less, preferably 2 microns or less in diameter.   It is not possible to define exactly how large the portion is but, if<br>
15  a sufficiently large portion is obtained, this is confirmed by DSC test of the invention.<br>
Thus, the composition which does have a sufficient amount of liquid crystal modifier (Example 2 of Table 1)<br>
2 0  displays a considerable amount of lamellar liquid crystal<br>
phase with size less than 2 micron in diameter when observed via optical microscopy.  As indicated, the fact that it has "sufficient" modifier is confirmed because the composition, meets the criteria for the DSC thermal trace, and is stable<br>
25  at ambient and at 40°C for over one month.<br>
Liquid cleanser compositions which do not contain sufficient amount of liquid crystal modifier show phase separation and contain lamellar liquid crystal with size of 30  10 microns or larger in diameter.  Specifically, without<br>
sufficient modifier, the compositions separate after storage<br><br>
33<br><br>
at ambient temperature in less than 2 weeks.  As noted, it was found that this phase separation problem can be overcome in the subject invention by adding sufficient level of the liquid crystal modifiers to reduce the size of the lamellar 5  liquid crystal and also possibly to increase the phase volume of the liquid crystal phase {which in turn is reflected by observation using the optical microscope or by the defined DSC enthalpy characterization).<br>
It should be noted that, other than the desired surfactant liquid crystal phase described above, the liguid compositions of the subject invention might also contain other surfactant phases such as surfactant micelles and insoluble surfactant crystals.<br>
15<br>
20<br>
If the fraction of surfactant liquid crystal phase in the resulting liquid composition of th§ invention is not visible using optical microscopy, the presence in the liquid composition of this invention can also be confirmed by an alternate method like small-angle X ray scattering.  In an x-ray scattering experiment, the presence of lamellar phase is indicated by diffraction lines at positions d, d/2, d/3, wherein d is the Bragg spacing.   P. Linder, T. Zemb, "Neutrons, X-rays and Light:  Scattering Methods Applied to Condensed Matter", Elsevier (Boston, 2Q04).<br>
Thus, as seen, for the invention it is critical that two things occur simultaneously: (1) the liquid crystal inducer is required to ensure at least some portion 30  surfactant phase is in lamellar liquid crystal phase; and (2) the modifier is required to ensure the composition is<br><br>
34<br>
physically stable.  It is believed that physical stability occurs because a portion of the lamellar phase is in the form of small vesicles of 5 microns or less, preferably 2 microns or less in diameter.  However, whatever the reason, 5  when the composition of the invention is prepared as noted (proper selection of ingredients), this is reflected in the DSC trace and stability as defined.<br>
The liquid crystal modifiers suitable for the present<br>
10  invention are straight chain fatty acids, straight chain fatty alcohols and hydrocarbon oils with molecular weight less than 600, preferably less than 400 g per mole, and the total level can be in the range of 0.5 to 14 wt%, according to one embodiment, or 0 to 10% of the liquid cleanser<br>
15  composition according to a second embodiment (where there is already 10% fatty acid in starting product) depending on total amount of fatty acyl isethionates and synthetic cosurfactants described above. It should be noted that, for the first embodiment, fatty acids and fatty soaps contained<br>
20  in the fatty acyl isethionate surfactant composition are considered to be part of the liquid crystal modifier. The total level of liquid crystal modifier should be at least 15 wt%, preferably 20 wt%  of total amount of fatty acyl isethionate surfactant (not the product) and synthetic co-<br>
25  surfactants in the liquid cleanser composition of this<br>
invention.  Examples of useful ingredients which form small surfactant liquid crystals from the mixture of fatty acyl isethionate, synthetic co-surfactants and crystal inducer (alkanolamide/or alkylamine oxide) include straight chain<br>
30  fatty acids of Cs to C20 hydrocarbons such as capric acid,<br>
1auric acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid; fatty alcohols<br><br>
35<br>
of CB to C20 straight chain; and hydrocarbon oils of 9 to 40 hydrocarbons, preferably 9 to 30 linear hydrocarbon oil, even more preferably 10-24 linear hydrocarbon oil.  Branched fatty acids or branched fatty alcohols such as isostearic 5  acid and isostearic alcohol are optional ingredients. If used, these are preferably limited to no more than 30 wt%, most preferably no more than 20 wt% of total liquid crystal modifiers (i.e. fatty acids, fatty alcohols and hydrocarbon oils) . 10<br>
Water soluble/dispersible polymers<br>
Water soluble/dispersible polymers are an optional ingredient that is highly preferred to be included in the<br>
15  liquid composition of the invention. The water soluble/or<br>
dispersible polymer can be cationic, anionic, amphoteric or nonionic polymer with molecular weight higher than 100,000 Dalton.  These polymers are known to enhance in-use and after-use skin sensory feels, to enhance lather creaminess<br>
20  and lather stability, and to increase the viscosity of liquid cleanser compositions. In this invention, these polymers, particularly gel forming polymers such as starch granule, xanthan gum, Carbopol®, cross-linked alkaline soluble emulsion polymers and cationic guar gums such as<br>
25  Jaguar® C13S, are found to be useful for some fatty acyl isethionate and co surfactant composition (e.g., compositions having combination of fatty acyl isethionate and cocoamidopropyl betaine) to form the desired surfactant liquid crystals in the liquid composition of this invention.<br>
30  This is believed due to the increase of effective surfactant<br><br>
36<br>
concentration in the aqueous phase of the liquid cleansing composition in the presence of these gel forming polymers.<br>
Examples of water soluble/ or dispersable polymers 5  useful in the present invention include the carbohydrate gums such as cellulose gum, microcrystalline cellulose, cellulose gel, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxymethyl or carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose,<br>
10  guar gum, gum karaya, gum tragacanth, gum arabic, gum acacia, gum agar, xanthan gum and mixtures thereof ; modified and nonmodified starch granules with gelatinization temperature between 30 to 85°C and pregelatinized cold water soluble starch;  polyacrylate; Carbopols; alkaline soluble<br>

Examples &amp; Protocol<br>
Methodology of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) 5<br>
Samples were weighed into an aluminum pan, hermetically sealed, and loaded into a 2920 MDSC machine from TA Instruments at 25°C. Depending on the interference of water melting peak (normally this peak varies from -10 to 25 C)<br>
10  with the surfactant liquid crystal transition temperature, two protocols were used for the DSC measurement. All the liquid compositions were first measured using the first protocol described as following. The sample was equilibrated to a temperature of -35CC, Iso-Track for 2 minutes followed<br>
15  by heating at 10CC/ min to 60°C. Transition enthalpies were<br>
evaluated using the standard software from TA Instruments. A typical resulting DSC curve measured using Example 2 of this invention in Table 1 is shown in Figure 1. If the water melting peak interfered with the transition temperature of<br>
20  liquid composition between 5 to 35 C as shown in Figure 2<br>
for Example 27 of Table 3, then the second DSC method should be used for the measurement.  In the second DSC protocol, liquid composition was equilibrated to a temperature of 1.5°C, Iso-Track for 2 minutes followed by heating at<br>
25  5°C/minute to 60°C.  DSC curve of Example 27 measured using the second DSC protocol was shown in Figure 3.<br><br>

Examples 1 to 12 were prepared by mixing all the ingredients except perfume and glydant plus at 70 to 75°C for 15 to 30 minutes until all the solid ingredients such as 5  DEFI, lauric acid, ASAD (mixture of fatty acids) and cocomonoethanolamide, CMEA (liquid crystal inducer) dissolved to form an uniform mixture. 0.2 to 0.4 wt% of NaOH was added to the liquid during the heating of the liquid to neutralize some of the fatty acid in the liquid<br>
10  composition.  Perfume and glydant plus (a hydantoin<br>
preservative) were added after the liquid was cooled below 40°C.  The pH of these liquids was adjusted to 6.7 to 7.1 using either 30% citric acid or 25% NaOH solution. Samples were stored at room temperature and 40CC for over 4 weeks.<br>
15  All the samples were stable after storage for over 4 weeks, without visible physical separation.<br>
Both DEFI and Dove® are fatty acyl isethionate products manufactured by Unilever.   DEFI has 65-80 wt% of C8 to C18<br>
20  fatty acyl isethionates and 15-30 wt% free fatty acids of 8 to 18 carbons.  Dove© is prepared by mixing 65-75 wt% of DEFI with 15-25wt% of long chain (C16 to C18) fatty acid and fatty soap. Cocolse 75% (ex. Huanggang Yongan Daily Chemical Co. ) is mixture of 70 to 76 wt% of sodium cocoyl<br>
25  isethionate and 13 to 20 wt% of free cocoyl fatty acid.<br>
Jordapon® CI from BASF contains more than 84 wt% of sodium cocoyl isethionate and less than 8 wt% of free cocoyl fatty acid. These examples indicate that this invention are robust to stabilize fatty acyl isethionates of different<br>
30  compositions (i.e., when used with liquid crystal inducer and liquid crystal modifier, compositions are consistently<br><br><br>
48<br>
stable at both high and low temperature for at least 4 weeks regardless of fatty acid content and/or chain length of fatty acyl group) and are useful for a variety of co-surfactants (e.g./ amphoacetate, sulfosuccinates). 5<br>
Eight comparative examples using cocoamidopropyl betaine as the co-surfactant with composition shown in Table 2 were prepared for comparison. All the comparative examples were prepared the same way as Examples 1 to 12. None of<br>
10  these samples were stable at both 40°C and at room<br>
temperature storage condition due to the lack of one of the required ingredients needed to stabilize the liquid composition.  Specifically, Comparative Examples A, B and C had no CMEA (liquid crystal inducers; these are believed<br>
15  needed since the modifier works only when surfactant phase of composition is in sufficiently liquid crystal form), for example.   Comparative example D did not have sufficient free fatty acid or other modifier required to form a stable, surfactant liquid phase, perhaps because the liquid crystals<br>
20  have unstably large domain size.   Comparative example E had no co-surfactant (believed necessary to help form liquid crystals).  Comparative F had no hydrocarbon oil, e.g., petrolatum.  Again, without wishing to be bound by theory, this may have hindered formation of small particle domains<br>
25  and affected stability.  Comparative examples G and H<br>
contain all the required ingredients in the composition. However, the amount of CMEA or lauric acid used in the liquid is not sufficient to maintain its physical stability (once more, without wishing to be bound by theory, because<br>
30  not sufficient to induce liquid crystal phase and/or, if<br>
sufficient to induce liquid crystal phase, not sufficient to<br><br>
49<br>
form proper domain size).  The stability of Comparative examples G and H can be achieved by increasing the level of CMEA and/or lauric acid as shown in Example 1, 2 and 3 of Table 1. 5<br>
It should be noted in general that the level of alkanoamide such as CMEA, or of hydrocarbon oils, to form' the stable liquid composition of this invention also depends on the combination of fatty acyl isethionate and synthetic 10  cosurfactant. This is exemplified in Examples 22 to 31 of Table 4.<br><br>

Examples 13 to 21 of present invention except example 18 were prepared using the method same as the one described in 5  example 1. Examples 18 was prepared by adding petrolatum to the liquid composition after the liquid was cooled below 30°C and mixed at low speed to form large petrolatum droplet in the liquid (more than 500 um). The sample was then passed through 60-mesh screen once to make petrolatum droplet with size in the<br>
10  range of 20 to 800 um. All the samples are stable at both 40°C<br>
and room temperature for over 4 weeks except comparative example I and J which did not contain hydrocarbon oils such as mineral oil or petrolatum. Stability of these 2 examples can be achieved by adding low level of hydrocarbon oil into the liquid<br>
15  composition as shown in Examples 20 and 21 (the sensitivity of stability can be noted by the fact that adding just 1% more liquid  crystal modifier, which we believe affects domain size of liquid crystal phase, permits composition to go from instability to stability); or by increasing the amount of water<br>
20  soluble/dispersible polymer in the liquid composition.<br>
Various type of water soluble or water swellable polymers were used to make  Examples 13 to 16.  Jaguar C13S is cationic cellulose ex. Rhodia,  Methocel 40-101 is hydroxymethylcellulose 25  from Dow, Water Lock A18 is modified starch super absorbent<br>
polymer available from Grain Processing, and ETD 2020 is cross linked polyacrylic acid from Moveon. All these water soluble/dispersible polymers are very compatible with the liquid compositions of this invention. Examples 17 and 18 show that the<br>

liquid composition of this invention can have	high level of<br>
humectants such as 30% glycerin or high level	of emollient oils<br>
