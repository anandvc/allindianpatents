				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an optical authenticity feature for application onto any<br>
carriers, for example onto documents, I.D. cards, bank notes or plastic cards, and to a<br>
method for reading out the authenticity feature in accordance with the invention.<br>
Documents, deeds, bank notes, I.D. cards, plastic cards, etc. can be reproduced in<br>
exact detail and true to colour with the aid of modern high-resolution colour scanners<br>
and with the aid of colour laser printers or thermo-sublimation printers. The general<br>
availability of colour photocopiers means that it has also become substantially easier<br>
to manufacture high-quality forgeries.<br>
A need therefore exists to make documents, I.D. cards, bank notes, securities, plastic<br>
cards, etc. secure against forgery by means of additionally applied safety features. By<br>
means of such security features, an effect can at least be achieved whereby the<br>
manufacture of a high-quality forgery is made much more expensive. Watermarks,<br>
silk threads, twisting line structures (Guilloche structures) and the use of special-paper<br>
are known as such security features. The application of metallised embossed<br>
holograms onto bank notes, credit cards and Eurocheque cards has also become<br>
generally widespread.<br>
However, it would be desirable to be able to apply a security feature to the respective<br>
carrier which cannot at first be recognised as a security feature. Such a security<br>
feature, which is generally only recognisable with the use of complex technologies,<br>
would have the advantage of not being perceived as a security feature by the general<br>
public. Such a hidden security feature would not be taken into account in a number of<br>
forgeries.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a security feature which can be<br>
applied to any carriers such as documents, bank notes, I.D. cards, plastic cards, etc.,<br>
with the information contained in the security feature not being directly recognisable<br>
when looked at.<br>
This object of the invention is solved by a security feature in accordance with claim 1<br>
or 14 by a method for reading out the security feature in accordance with the invention<br>
/according to claims 10 and/or 15 and by a method for the manufacture of the security<br>
 feature in accordance with the invention according to claim 18.<br>
The security feature in accordance with the invention can be applied to any carriers,<br>
for example to a document, an I.D. card, a bank note, a plastic card, etc. By means of<br>
the security feature, a phase profile is modulated on a light ray incident to the security<br>
feature.<br>
Phase shifts are generated between the individual spatial regions of an incident wave-<br>
front by the security feature, with a phase profile being modulated on the wave-front.<br>
Whereas the eye can directly recognise an amplitude profile modulated on a wave-<br>
front as a brightness profile, a wave-front on which a phase profile has been<br>
modulated appears as a uniformly bright area. Whereas, therefore, an amplitude<br>
profile is directly recognisable, a phase profile is hidden information which can only<br>
be made visible by means of technical aids. A security feature which modulates a<br>
phase profile on a light ray therefore represents a hidden security feature, as the<br>
modulated phase profile is initially invisible. The security feature in accordance with<br>
the invention therefore remains unrecognised in many cases and can by just this<br>
feature meet its purpose of ensuring the authenticity of a document, an I.D. card, a<br>
bank note, a plastic card, etc. so much better.<br>
With another advantageous aspect of the invention, a film is applied to the respective<br>
carrier, with the film having a varying film thickness and with a phase profile<br>
corresponding to the film thickness variation being able to be modulated on an<br>
incident light ray by the film.<br>
If a wave-front passes through a transparent film having a film thickness variation,<br>
then the film thickness variation causes different optical path lengths through the film<br>
and thus phase modulation. After passing through the transparent film, a ray which<br>
has penetrated a region of high film thickness is dephased over a ray which has<br>
penetrated a region of lower film thickness.<br>
Such transparent films can additionally be provided with a reflecting film so that the<br>
incident light ray first penetrates the transparent film, is subsequently reflected at the<br>
reflecting film and then passes through the transparent film a second time. The phase<br>
modulation is modulated on here by the two-fold passage through the film thickness<br>
profile.<br>
In accordance with another advantageous aspect of the invention, the security feature<br>
comprises a film applied to the respective carrier, with the film having a varying<br>
refractive index.<br>
A wave-front which passes through a transparent film having a varying refractive<br>
index is thereby subjected to phase modulation. A ray which has passed through a<br>
region having a high refractive index is dephased over a ray which was directed<br>
through a region having a low refractive index.<br>
Phase modulation is respectively generated by parts of a wave-front passing through<br>
different optical path lengths when passing through a film, with this occurring<br>
independently of whether the different optical path lengths are generated by a<br>
variation in refractive index or a variation in film thickness. However, a variation in<br>
refractive index has the advantage over a variation in film thickness that it is less easy<br>
to see on the film.<br>
In accordance with another advantageous aspect of the invention, the security feature<br>
comprises a hologram applied to the respective carrier, with an object ray having a<br>
phase profile modulated thereon being able to be restored by a light ray incident to the<br>
hologram.<br>
This solution has the advantage that the modulated information cannot be recognised<br>
without aids either on the hologram or on the object ray exiting the hologram. The<br>
hologram per se already represents a security feature difficult to copy. However, it<br>
would not be suspected that the hologram itself contains additional hidden<br>
information. But a security feature which is not actually recognised a such represents<br>
the best protection against forgery.<br>
It is advantageous if the light ray incident to the hologram generates an image of a<br>
phase object. This is the case if the hologram contains the holographic record of a<br>
phase object which is restored by the incident light ray. A phase object is not<br>
recognisable as such so that the image of the phase object is also only recognisable<br>
with aids.<br>
The hologram is preferably manufactured by recording the interference image which<br>
is created by the interference of a reference ray and an object ray directed through a<br>
phase object. If the hologram manufactured in this way is subjected to the reference<br>
ray, the object ray can be restored. The object ray restored by the interference image<br>
again has the same phase modulation as the object ray used for the recording, as the<br>
complete information on the object ray recorded is contained in the interference<br>
image.<br>
To read out the security feature in accordance with the invention, it is exposed to a<br>
light ray, with a phase profile being modulated on the light ray by the security feature.<br>
Subsequently, the modulated phase profile is transformed into an amplitude<br>
modulation. This is necessary to make visible the phase information which is invisible<br>
per se.<br>
One method to generate amplitude modulation from phase modulation is the phase<br>
contrast method. In this method, a so-called phase-shifting annulus is introduced into a<br>
Fourier plane of the ray path. This phase-shifting annulus generates a phase shift<br>
between the light penetrating the annular region of the phase annulus and the<br>
remaining light. This leads to the phase information becoming visible as an amplitude<br>
image.<br>
Another common method of making phase modulations visible is the so-called<br>
schlieren method. In this method, the zeroth order is filtered in a Fourier plane of the<br>
ray path. The lack of the zeroth order then leads to the creation of an amplitude image<br>
which reflects the phase information.<br>
Another advantageous possibility of making the modulated phase profile visible is the<br>
use of an interferometer. Here, the phase-modulated ray is brought into interference<br>
with a non-modulated plane wave . Depending on the phase position of the two<br>
superimposed waves, constructive or destructive interference is created, which means<br>
that the phase modulation is transformed into a brightness distribution.<br>
In accordance with another advantageous embodiment of the invention, the security<br>
feature comprises a hologram having the following properties being applied to a<br>
carrier, for example a document, an I.D. card, a bank note or a plastic card: a first<br>
object ray having a modulated phase profile can be restored by a first light ray<br>
incident to the hologram at a first incidence angle. A second object ray having no<br>
phase modulation can be restored by a second light ray incident to the hologram at a<br>
second incidence angle. Amplitude modulation corresponding to the modulated phase<br>
profile of the first object ray is created from the interference between the first and the<br>
second object rays.<br>
Such a hologram can be manufactured by the recording of two interference images.<br>
The first interference image which has to be recorded is created by the interference of<br>
a first reference ray incident at a first incidence angle and a first object ray, with a<br>
phase profile being modulated on the first object ray. The second interference image is<br>
created by the interference of a second reference ray incident at a second incidence<br>
angle and a second object ray, with no phase profile being modulated on the second<br>
object ray.<br>
The double-exposed hologram presented here provides a very reliable proof of<br>
authenticity. To make the stored information visible, the hologram must be exposed to<br>
two reference rays of the right wavelength under exactly the pre-defined incidence<br>
angles. Only then can the two object waves be restored and only with in-phase<br>
restoration of the two object waves does that interference arise which allows the<br>
modulated information to become visible. If only one of the two reference rays is<br>
incident, the interference image is not created.<br>
The solution in accordance with the invention having two object rays is more or less<br>
an "integrated holographic interferometer". Here, a second, unmodulated ray<br>
interfering with the first object ray is also generated out of the hologram (which is the<br>
reason for the expression "integrated interferometer"). The first and the second object<br>
rays can both be stored in the hologram by the hologram being subjected to double<br>
exposure. If the hologram is exposed to a second reference ray incident at a second<br>
incidence angle, the second object ray is restored. By means of this solution,<br>
complicated optical reading apparatuses can therefore be dispensed with.<br>
The double-exposed hologram can be read out by it being exposed to a first light ray<br>
at a first incidence angle and to a second light ray at a second incidence angle. In this<br>
way, the two object rays are restored and their interference can now be detected.<br>
The interference image created is preferably captured on a screen. This is the simplest<br>
and cheapest solution.<br>
As an alternative to this, the interference of the two object rays can also be captured<br>
by a camera. This has the advantage that the interference image can be evaluated<br>
better. It is in particular possible to evaluate the interference image further by means<br>
of an image processing system.<br>

Fig. 1 shows how a plane wave 1 penetrates a transparent phase object 2, with<br>
information being modulated on the light wave 1 as phase modulation by the phase<br>
object 2.<br>
Fig. 1 shows how phase modulation can be modulated on an incident wave front 1 by<br>
means of a transparent foil 2. For this purpose, the transparent foil 2 has regions of<br>
different film thickness. A light ray 3, which has penetrated a region of low film<br>
thickness, appears dephased over a light ray 4 which has penetrated a region of high<br>
film thickness. The phase shift here is proportional to the difference of the optical<br>
path:<br><br>
In this way, information can be modulated on an incident ray as phase modulation by<br>
means of a foil 2.<br>
In Fig. 1, the transparent foil 2 is penetrated in transmission by the wave front 1.<br>
However, it is equally possible to provide the foil 2 additionally with a reflecting film<br>
and to expose it to a plane wave front so that the wave front passes through the film<br>
thickness profile twice. Accordingly, the double phase shift is produced with this<br>
reflection geometry.<br>
In Fig. 2, a foil 6 is shown having regions of different refractive indices. When the<br>
transparent foil 6 is penetrated by a wave front 5, then the refractive index profile is<br>
modulated on this wave front as a phase profile. A light ray 7, which has passed<br>
through a region of high refractive index, appears dephased over a light ray 8 which<br>
has gone through a region of low refractive index. With a constant film thickness of<br>
the transmitting film, that phase shift is produced which is proportional to the<br>
difference in refractive indices:<br><br>
Such a foil 6, whose refractive index varies, can also be provided with a reflecting<br>
film and be used in reflection geometry.<br>
A phase profile can also be modulated on an incident light ray by means of a<br>
hologram. The arrangement for the exposure of such a hologram suitable as a security<br>
feature is shown in Fig. 3. First, an object wave is generated having the desired phase<br>
profile. To do this, a light wave 10 penetrates a phase object 11 which modulates the<br>
desired phase modulation on the wave. The phase-modulated object wave 12 is<br>
applied to the holographic film 9 from one side and the reference ray 13 is incident to<br>
the holographic film from the other side. The interference image created is recorded as<br>
a hologram. As the object and reference rays are incident to the holographic film from<br>
opposite sides, a reflection hologram is generated. A transmission hologram could be<br>
generated by the object and reference rays being incident to the holographic film from<br>
the same side.<br>
In Fig. 4, it is shown how the original phase-modulated object wave can be restored<br>
by means of the hologram 9. To do this, the reflection hologram 9 is exposed to a<br>
reference ray 13 which restores the object ray 14. The restored object ray 14 has the<br>
same phase modulation as the object ray 12 used for the recording.<br>
As the phase information modulated on an incident light ray by the security feature is<br>
not visible as such, this phase information has to be transformed into an amplitude<br>
image when the security feature is read out. Various techniques known, for instance,<br>
from microscopy exist for this purpose such as the dark-field method, the phase-<br>
contrast method or the schlieren method. The basic principle of the three techniques is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5. Here, an incident, phase-modulated wave 15 is imaged on a<br>
screen 17 by means of a lens or a lens element 16. If no manipulation were to be<br>
performed in the ray path, the screen 17 would appear to be illuminated uniformly<br>
brightly. To make the phase differences visible, a diaphragm is introduced into the ray<br>
path, namely at the Fourier plane.<br>
In the dark-field method, a diaphragm 18 is used at whose centre a blackening 19 is<br>
present which filters the zeroth order of diffraction. The schlieren method, in which<br>
the zeroth order of diffraction is blocked out with the aid of a sharp tip extending into<br>
the ray path, functions in a similar way. In both cases, an amplitude image 20 of the<br>
modulated phase information can be seen on the screen 17.<br>
In the phase-contrast method, a diaphragm 20 is introduced into the ray path, which<br>
diaphragm 20 contains a so-called phase-shifting annulus 21. Light transmitted<br>
through the phase-shifting annulus 21 is dephased over the other light. By means of<br>
the phase-shifting annulus, phase shift is introduced between the different orders of<br>
diffraction. The result is that the phase modulation of the incident light 15 is<br>
transformed into amplitude modulation which becomes visible on the screen 17.<br>
In Fig. 6, an Michelson interferometer is shown with the aid of which phase<br>
modulation can also be made visible. With an interferometer, the transformation of<br>
phase modulation into amplitude modulation is performed by the object wave<br>
interfering with a reference wave. Depending on the relative phase position between<br>
the two waves, constructive or destructive interference is created.<br>
With the interferometer shown in Fig. 6, the phase-modulated object ray 21 is applied<br>
to the semi-transparent mirror 22 which deflects part of the incident light downwards.<br>
The non-deflected part of the object ray 21 is reflected by the stationary mirror 23 and<br>
again impacts the semi-transparent mirror 22. Again, a part of the object ray is<br>
reflected (ray 24) and projected onto the screen 26 by the lens or the lens element 25.<br>
The semi-transparent mirror 22 is moreover exposed to the reference wave 27. One<br>
part of the reference wave is reflected, the other part is transmitted, and this<br>
transmitted part of the reference wave is also imaged through the lens or the lens<br>
element 25 on the screen 26. Due to the superimposition of the two waves, an<br>
interference pattern is created on the screen 26. Depending on whether the screen 26 is<br>
tilted or not with respect to the mirrors 22 and 23, either the interference image 28 (for<br>
the case of a tilted screen) or the interference image 29 (for an optimum adjustment of<br>
the screen) is created. Instead of showing the interference image on a screen, it is also<br>
possible to record the interference image with a camera. This has the advantage that<br>
the interference image is then available in digital form and can be supplied to an<br>
image processing system.<br>
In Figures 7A and 7B, a special kind of double exposure of a holograph is shown.<br>
Figure 7A represents the first exposure of the holographic film 33. The first reference<br>
ray 34 is incident to the holographic film 33 at a first incidence angle. From the other<br>
side, the object ray 35 is applied to the holographic film 33 and interferes with the<br>
reference ray 34. The interference image is recorded as the first exposure on the<br>
holographic film 33.<br>
With the selected taking geometry, the reference ray and the object ray are incident to<br>
the holographic film from opposite sides. A hologram taken in this way can be<br>
restored after its development by a light ray incident from the observer side; it is<br>
therefore a reflection hologram.<br>
After the holographic film 33 has been exposed in accordance with Figure 7A, it is<br>
exposed to another, second exposure in accordance with Figure 7B. The second<br>
exposure is performed using a reference ray at a second incidence angle differing from<br>
the first incidence angle. To obtain the object ray, a wave-front 37 passes through a<br>
phase object 38 and the object ray 39 having phase modulation is created. In this way,<br>
information, for example a text, an emblem or a logo, can be modulated on the object<br>
ray. The object wave 39 and the second reference ray 36 generate an interference<br>
image which is recorded on the holographic film 33 during the second exposure.<br>
Figure 8 shows how the double-exposed hologram can be restored. If the developed<br>
hologram 33 is exposed to the second reference ray 36 at the second incidence angle,<br>
then the phase-modulated wave is restored. Phase modulations are, however, invisible<br>
to the eye.<br>
To make the phase information visible, the hologram 33 has to be exposed at the same<br>
time to the first reference ray 34 at the first incidence angle and to the second<br>
reference ray 36 at the second incidence angle. The first reference ray 34 restores a<br>
light wave without phase modulation. The second reference ray 36 restores an object<br>
wave on which information has been modulated as phase modulation. Interference<br>
arises between these two restored wave-fronts and by means of this interference, the<br>
invisible phase modulation is transformed into a visible amplitude modulation. This<br>
amplitude modulation becomes visible on the screen 40. Depending on whether the<br>
screen has a certain tilt relative to the interfering wave-fronts or not, either the screen<br>
image shown in Figure 9A or that shown in Figure 9B is created.<br>
A visible screen image is only created if the phase-modulated object wave restored by<br>
the second reference ray has the non-interfered wave restored by the first reference ray<br>
superimposed on it. To this extent, the double-exposed hologram 33 acts as an<br>
"integrated holographic interferometer"; as with an interferometer, the interference<br>
between an interfered wave and a plane wave-front is made visible.<br>
It is important for the use of the double-exposure method described as a security<br>
feature that the information can be obtained neither by the first reference ray 34 alone<br>
nor by the second reference ray 36 alone. Only when both reference rays are applied<br>
to the holographic film at the respectively proper incidence angles can the stored<br>
information be obtained.<br>
