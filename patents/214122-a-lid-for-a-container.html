Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring firstly to Figures 1 to 3., there is shown a lid 30 according to a first embodiment of the invention. The lid 30 is for use with a disposable beverage container, in the form of polystyrene cup 32, as are commonly used in the sale of coffee. The cap 32 includes an open end surrounded by a circular rim 34 and a closed end defined by a<br><br>
circular flat base 36. The lid 30 includes a peripheral skirt 38 adapted to substantially sealingly engage with the rim 34 of the cup 32, as is well known in the art.<br>
The construction and external shape ojf the lid 30 is substantially identical to known commercially available high impact polystyrene (HIPS) lids, except the lid 30 also includes therein a material having thermochromic properties, preferably thermochromic pigment, as will be explained in more detail below. Materials having thermochromic properties, including but not limited to tbermochromic pigments, are also known. Briefly, materials having thermochromic properties change colour (hereinafter referred to as a thermochromic activation colour) upon reaching a predetermined temperature (hereinafter referred to as a thermochromic activation temperature). The colour is usually gradual from near the activation temperature and complete by the activation temperature, For example a thermochromic pigment with an activation temperature of 45 Degrees 'Celcius would begin changing to the mermochromic activation colour at about 45 Degrees Celcius, with the colour charge being complete by 45 Degrees Celcius.<br>
In use, the cup 32 is filled with contents 40 which, hi the present embodiment, would be hot coffee. After the cup 32 has been filled with the hot contents 40, the lid 30 is applied in the known manner to seal me open end of the cup 32 about the rim 34. Heat transfer men occurs between the heated contents 40 and the (ambient temperature) lid 30, as generally indicated by arrows 42. When the heat transfer is sufficient to heat the lid 30 from ambient temperature to a predetermined thermochromic activation temperature of mo thenoaochromic pigment within the lid 30, the mermochromic properties of the pigment cause the lid 30 to change colour, as indicated by the shaded portions of the lid shown in Figure 3. As an example, when the lid 30 is used with cups of hot coffee, a thennochromic pigment is chosen with a thermochromic activation temperature of 45 Degrees Celsius and an thermochromic activation colour of bright red. The<br>
When used with heated beverages, as described in relation to Figs. 1 to 3, the lid 30 preferably presents a violet or similar colour when at ambient temperature and a bright red colour when heated to the thennochromic activation temperature, which provides an intuitive indication that the contents of the cup 32 are hot<br>
When the contents 40, and thus the lid 30, have cooled to below the therraochromic activation temperature, the lid 30 returns to its original colour to indicate that the contents 40 have cooled.<br>
When the cup 32 is to be used with chilled beverages, a thermochromic pigment is selected with a thermochromic activation temperature of, for example, 5 Degrees Celsius and an activation colour of blue. When the lid 30 has<br><br>
Celsius due to heat transfer from the (ambient temperature) lid 30 to the chilled contents 40, the lid 30 turns a blue colour to indicate that the contents are at the predetermined chilled temperature. Again, when the contents 40, and thus the lid 30, warm to above the thermochromio activation temperature, five lid 30 returns to its original violet colour to indicate the contents 40 are no longer chilled.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a lid 44 according to the second embodiment of the invention and like reference numerals to those used in describing the first embodiment will be used to denote like features. The lid 44 is similar to the lid 32 according to the first embodiment except it includes an opening 45a to allow a user to consume the contents 40 without removiAg the lid 44 from the cup 32 and an axea 45b without thermochromic properties to allow advertising, consumer or other information or indicia to be applied to the lid 44.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a lid 46 according to a third embodiment of the invention and like reference numerals to those used in describing the first and second embodiments will be used to denote like features. The lid 46 is also similar to the lid 30 according to the first embodiment of the invention except different regions of the lid have been produced using thermocbromic pigments of differing activating temperatures so. that different parts of the lid, for example rim 48, lid side wall 50 and top 52 can each be configured to change colour at differing temperatures (eg. 40, 45 and 50 Degrees Celsius respectively), to provide a progressive indication of temperature.<br>
Figs. 6 to 9 show a lid 54 according to a fourth embodiment of the invention and like reference numerals to those used to. describing the previous embodiments will be used to denote like features. The lid 54 is similar to the lid 30 according to the first embodiment of the invention except it has a slightly more raised, top surface 56. Importantly, the lid 54 includes the skirt 38 which is adapted to substantially sealingly eagage with the rim 34 of the cup 32.<br>
As with earlier embodiments, the shaded portion of the lid 54 shown in Fig. 7 demonstrates that the thermochroznic pigment in the lid 54 causes it to change colour when heat transfer from the contents 40 of the cup 32 cause the lid 54 to reach, a predetermined thermochromic activation temperature.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the lid 54 and the cup 32 when the lid 54 has been correctly applied to the cup 32 and the skirt 38 covers, and is engaged with, the rim 34 of the c\jj&gt; 32 about its entire periphery. In this position, the rim 34 effectively insulates the skirt 38 from heat transfer with the contents 40 of the cup 32. Accordingly, as shown, only parts 58 of the lid 54 other than the skirt 38 change colour upon reaching the predptermined thermochromic activation temperature. However, as shown in Fig. 9, if the skirt 18 
 <br>
completely sealed with respect to the rim 34 then hot vapours or similar can pass through the gap between the unsealed portion of the skirt 38 and the rim 34, causing heat transfer and an associated colour change in the unsealed portion 38a of the skirt 38. Accordingly, applying thermochromic material to all of the lid 54 including the skirt 38, or only the skirt 38S can be used to provide a visual indication as to whether or not the lid 54 is properly sealed with respect to the cup 32, as can occur due to operator error, for avoidance of spillage and the like.<br>
The lid embodiments described above are preferably all moulded, particularly vacuum moulded, with thermochromic pigments introduced to the molten plastics material (HIPS) before moulding. The preferred method of producing the thennochromic regions of the lids involve co-extruding two layers of HIPS. The inner layer (ie. mat adjacent the contents of the cup in. use) of HIPS is produced conventionally and with a base pigment of either white or a grey tone to add a depth of colour to the lid. The outer layer (ie. that remote the contents of the cup m use) is produced from a dear HEPS to which has been added approximately 7 to 20, preferably 10, percent by weight of a thennochromic pigment and 2 to 3 percent of a standard pigment of a similar colour to the activated colour of the thermochromic pigment The thennochromic pigments themselves are commercially available from several sources including, for example, those denoted F4, G7 or JS and sold under the trademark: CHROMICOLOR by Matsui International Co. Inc. of Gardeaa, CA, United States of America.<br>
The advantages of the lids according to the embodiments described above are many. For example, the lids can be used in the case of hot beverages to include a warning to the individual with the container, and those they may be approaching, that there are hot and potentially hazardous contents contained therein, In the case of chilled contents, the previously described embodiments of lids provide an indication that the contents have been dulled to a temperature expected by the consumer.<br>
The lids also provide an improved indication of temperature to individuals with, reduced eyesight, numbness of the fingers or those who handle containers in darkened environments.<br>
Figs. 10 and 11 show a lid 60 according to a fifth embodiment of the invention. The lid 60 includes a recess 61 having a substantially cylindrical slightwardly outwardly conical internal side wall 63 around a flat surface 64. The lid 60 also includes a vent hole 65, as is well known in the art.<br>
As best shown in Fig. 11, the internal aide wall 63 substantially corresponds in size and shape to the external side wall 66 that define the closed end of «<br><br>
container, such as cup 68. Accordingly, when the closed end of the container 68 is positioned within the recess 61 of the lid 60, the lid internal side wall 63 securely frictionally engages, over substantially its entire surface area, the external side wall 66 of the container 68. More particularly, in relation to a standard volume 8 Ounce (237mls) coffee cup, the side walls 64 and 66 engage ovei approximately 10 mm (10 percent) of the height of the container.<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 show a lid 70 according to a sixth embodiment of the invention and like reference numerals to those used in describing the fifth embodiment will be used to denote like features. The lid 70 is similar to the lid 60 according to the fifth embodiment except the internal side wall 63 does not extend around the entire lid periphery and instead has a portion removed to allow room for provision of a drinking spout 72.<br>
Fig, 14 shows a lid 74 according to a seventh embodiment of the invention and like reference numerals to those used in describing the fifth and sixth embodiments will be used to denote like features. The lid 74 is substantially identical to the lid 60 according to the fifth embodiment except the recess 61 is deeper and provides a side wall<br>
*<br>
76 that engages with the external side walls of a corresponding container (not shown) over approximately 20 mm (10 percent) of the height of the container,<br>
Fig. 15 and 17 show a lid 78 according to an eighth embodiment of the invention and like reference numerals to those used in describing the fifth to seventh embodiments will be used to denote like features. The lid 78 is substantially identical to the lid 74 of fbs seventh embodiment except it includes two recess 61a and 61b surrounded by respective side walls 63a and 63b. The recess 61a is, in use, adjacent the associated cup's open end and adapted to engage a smaller container compared to the recess 61b, which is remote the cup's open end and adapted to engage a relatively larger container. This allows the lid 78 to seal one of either a larger or smaller size cup and have another of the larger or smaller size cup engaged therewith by stacking (larger 32 cup shown).<br>
Fig. 16 shows a lid 82 according to a ninth embodiment of the invention and like reference numerals to those used in describing the fifth to eighth embodiments will be used to denote like features. The lid 82 is substantially identical to the lid 78 of me eighth embodiment except it includes a drinking spout 84 and external depressions 84, which serve to increase the structural rigidity of the lid 82.<br>
Fig. 18 shows a lid 90 according to an tenth embodiment of the invention and like reference numerals to those used in describing the fifth to ninth embodiments will be used to denote like features. The lid 90 is for use with a paper cup 94 is substantially<br><br>
identical to the lid 86 of the ninth embodiment except the lower edges of the recesses 61a and 61b continue as grooves 92a and 92b respectively, which serve to receive and engage a peripheral edge 96 on the underside of the paper cup 94. The lid 90 is shown engaged with a smaller cup.<br>
The main advantage of the lids according to the fifth to twelth embodiments of the invention is they provide a secure gripping engagement with the underside of a correspondingly sized container, such that when the lids are secured to a primary container they can be engaged with a secondary stacked container in a secure fashion to provide for ease of carrying multiple stacked containers.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples, it will be appreciated to those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms. Particularly, the thennochromic features of the first five embodiments can be incorporated with the stacking features of me sixth to twelth embodiments and vice versa.<br><br>
