				<td>DUAL FUEL INJECTION VALVE AND METHOD OF OPERATING A<br>
DUAL FUEL INJECTION VALVE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a hydraulically actuable dual fuel injection<br>
valve and a dual needle assembly, for injecting two different fuels into the<br>
combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Because of its ready availability, low cost and potential for reducing<br>
particulate emissions, natural gas is a promising substitute for diesel fuel for fuelling<br>
compression ignition engines, commonly known as "diesel-cycle" engines. Persons<br>
skilled in the technology involved here will understand that natural gas is just one<br>
example of a preferred fuel, and that other fuels are also suitable, such as hydrogen,<br>
propane and other fuels that are cleaner burning substitutes for diesel fuel. A<br>
cleaner burning substitute fuel for diesel is defined as a fuel that can be used in an<br>
engine to substantially match the performance of a diesel-fuelled engine with lower<br>
particulate matter and/or nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.<br>
Conventional methods of introducing a gaseous fuel into an engine premix all<br>
of the gaseous fuel with the intake air, which is a method known as "fumigation".<br>
Engines using such an approach have been unable to match the power, performance,<br>
and efficiency of diesel-fuelled engines. The applicant has found that the inherent<br>
favorable operating characteristics and high efficiency of conventional diesel-fuelled<br>
engines can be preserved when at least some of the gaseous fuel is introduced<br>
directly into the engine's combustion chamber, late in the compression stroke.<br>
A problem with gaseous fuels such as natural gas is that, compared to diesel<br>
fuel, much higher temperatures and pressures are typically needed to auto-ignite the<br>
fuel. A solution to this problem, which allows the preservation of the major<br>
components of diesel-cycle engines is to inject a small amount of more auto-<br><br>
ignitable fuel such as diesel fuel, to initiate the ignition and combustion of the<br>
cleaner burning gaseous fuel.<br>
Using a pilot fuel in addition to a main charge of gaseous fuel requires the<br>
installation of at least two independently operable injection valves, one for the pilot<br>
fuel and one for the gaseous main fuel. To avoid having to redesign and replace the<br>
cylinder head, it is preferable to employ a gaseous and liquid fuel injection valve<br>
that fits into the same opening as a conventional diesel fuel injection valve.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a gaseous and liquid fuel injection valve<br>
arrangement that allows independent introduction of liquid pilot fuel and gaseous<br>
main fuel directly into the combustion chamber, and that has the same exterior<br>
dimensions as a conventional diesel injection valve.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A dual fuel injection valve separately injects a main fuel and a pilot fuel into<br>
a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. The injection valve<br>
comprises:<br>
(a) a hollow injection valve body comprising:<br>
a hydraulic fluid inlet port through which pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid can be introduced into fluid passages and a control<br>
chamber disposed within the interior of the valve body;<br>
a hydraulic fluid drain port through which hydraulic fluid can<br>
be drained from the control chamber;<br>
at least one control valve that is operable to selectively direct<br>
the flow of the hydraulic fluid and control hydraulic fluid pressure<br>
within the control chamber to influence movement of at least one of<br>
an outer needle and an inner needle between respective open and<br>
closed positions;<br>
a first-fuel inlet port through which a first fuel can be<br>
introduced at injection pressure into the valve body;<br><br>
a first-fuel passage provided within the valve body and<br>
extending between the first-fuel inlet port and a first-fuel cavity<br>
associated with the outer needle;<br>
a second-fuel inlet port through which a second fuel can be<br>
introduced into the valve body;<br>
a second-fuel passage connecting the second-fuel inlet port to<br>
a second-fuel cavity associated with the inner needle; and<br>
(b) a dual needle assembly comprising:<br>
the outer needle, which is hollow and disposed within the<br>
injection valve body, wherein the outer needle is movable between a<br>
closed position in which a first sealing surface associated with the<br>
outer needle contacts a first seat associated with the body and an open<br>
position in which the first sealing surface is spaced apart from the<br>
first seat, allowing the first fuel to flow from within the first-fuel<br>
cavity into the combustion chamber through at least one first-fuel<br>
ejection port; and<br>
the inner needle, which is disposed within the hollow outer<br>
needle, wherein the inner needle is movable between a closed position<br>
in which a second sealing surface associated with the inner needle<br>
contacts a second seat associated with the outer needle and an open<br>
position in which the second sealing surface is spaced apart from the<br>
second seat, allowing the second fuel to flow from within the second-<br>
fuel cavity into the combustion chamber through at least one second-<br>
fuel ejection port.<br>
In one embodiment, the first fuel is a main fuel and the second fuel is a pilot<br>
fuel that is more auto-ignitable than the main fuel. The hollow outer needle<br>
preferably serves as an inner valve body and the second-fuel cavity is preferably an<br>
annular cavity disposed between the inner needle and the outer needle.<br>
The control chamber is preferably employed to influence the position of the<br>
outer needle and an inlet fluid passage connects the control chamber to the hydraulic<br><br>
fluid inlet port, a drain fluid passage connects the control chamber to the drain port,<br>
and the control valve is operable to selectively control the flow of hydraulic fluid<br>
between the control chamber and the drain port or the hydraulic fluid inlet port to<br>
modulate pressure within the control chamber between drain pressure, when<br>
pressure within the control chamber is associated with pressure at the drain port,<br>
and rail pressure, when pressure within the control chamber is associated with<br>
pressure at the hydraulic fluid inlet port.<br>
The dual needle assembly is preferably dynamically disposed within the<br>
control chamber and the volume of the control chamber is preferably variable in<br>
response to movement of the dual needle assembly. Pressure within the control<br>
chamber is preferably held at rail pressure to generate a hydraulic force that<br>
contributes to maintaining the outer needle in the closed position. A spring<br>
preferably provides an additional closing force that cooperates with the hydraulic<br>
force to maintain the outer needle in the closed position. Fuel pressure within the<br>
first-fuel cavity preferably generates an opening force acting on the outer needle<br>
whereby the outer needle is movable to the open position under the influence of the<br>
opening force when pressure within the control chamber is reduced to close to drain<br>
pressure.<br>
The outer needle is preferably biased in the closed position when pressure<br>
within the control chamber is at drain pressure or close to drain pressure (that is, the<br>
control chamber pressure has a value sufficiently near drain pressure such that the<br>
outer needle is nevertheless biased in the closed position) and the outer needle is<br>
movable to the open position when hydraulic fluid pressure within the control<br>
chamber is at rail pressure. Preferably, a spring biases the outer needle in the<br>
closed position. The outer needle preferably comprises a shoulder disposed within<br>
the first control chamber and when pressure within the first control chamber is<br>
raised to rail pressure the hydraulic force is applied to the shoulder.<br>
In another embodiment of the present injection valve, the body preferably<br>
further comprises a second control chamber employed to influence the position of<br>
the inner needle and a second control valve is preferably operable to selectively<br><br>
control pressure of hydraulic fluid within the second control chamber to generate a<br>
hydraulic force that contributes to positioning the inner needle in one of the closed<br>
or open positions. The inner needle preferably comprises a shoulder that is<br>
dynamically disposed within the second-fuel cavity and the shoulder provides an<br>
area for receiving an opening force generated by fuel pressure within the second-<br>
fuel cavity. The injection valve preferably further comprises an inner spring<br>
disposed within the dual needle assembly that biases the inner needle in the closed<br>
position. The hydraulic force generated within the second control chamber<br>
preferably provides a force that acts on a movable intensifier piston that is operable<br>
to pressurize the second fuel. The second fuel can thereby be pressurized to an<br>
intensified pressure to generate an opening force acting on the inner needle that<br>
compresses the inner spring to move the inner needle to the open position.<br>
The hydraulic fluid pressure within the second control chamber preferably<br>
generates a hydraulic force that acts directly upon the dual needle assembly to<br>
influence positioning of the inner needle in one of the closed or open positions. The<br>
rail pressure within the second control chamber is preferably employed to generate a<br>
hydraulic force that contributes to maintaining the inner needle in the closed<br>
position.<br>
The second control chamber is preferably disposed within the dual needle<br>
assembly and a member associated with the inner needle is preferably dynamically<br>
disposed within the second control chamber such that the volume of the second<br>
control chamber is variable in response to movement of the member which causes a<br>
corresponding movement of the inner needle.<br>
An inner spring preferably provides an additional closing force that<br>
cooperates with the hydraulic force to maintain the inner needle in the closed<br>
position.<br>
The inner needle is preferably movable to the open position under the<br>
influence of an opening force generated by hydraulic fluid at rail pressure within the<br>
second control chamber. The inner needle is preferably biased in the closed position<br>
by an inner spring and the second control chamber is the second-fuel cavity. The<br><br>
inner needle is thereby movable to the open position when pressure within the<br>
second-fuel cavity is at rail pressure.<br>
In another embodiment of the present injection valve, the dual needle<br>
assembly preferably further comprises a cap dynamically disposed within the control<br>
chamber between the outer needle and the valve body such that, when the control<br>
chamber associated with the outer needle is filled with hydraulic fluid at rail<br>
pressure, the hydraulic force urges the cap towards the outer needle and a closing<br>
force is transmitted through the cap to the outer needle. The outer needle is<br>
preferably movable to the open position under the influence of fuel pressure within<br>
the first-fuel cavity acting on the outer needle when pressure within the control<br>
chamber is reduced to drain pressure. The injection valve preferably further<br>
comprises an inner spring disposed within the hollow outer needle between the cap<br>
and the inner needle for biasing the inner needle in the closed position. The cap<br>
preferably comprises an open-ended bore facing the inner needle and the assembly<br>
preferably further comprises an inner spring disposed within the bore between the<br>
cap and the inner needle. The inner spring preferably biases the inner needle in the<br>
closed position. The cap is preferably detached from the outer needle such that the<br>
inner spring can expand to contribute to holding the outer needle in the closed<br>
position by spacing the cap from the outer needle. The cap is preferably joinable in<br>
fixed relationship to the outer needle. The cap is preferably releasably joined to the<br>
outer needle by a threaded connection or by interlocking features.<br>
In another embodiment of the present injection valve, the dual needle<br>
assembly preferably further comprises an inner valve body comprising:<br>
the outer needle;<br>
a hollow inner valve housing joined to the outer needle; and<br>
a cap joined to the hollow inner valve housing.<br>
The inner needle is preferably disposed within the outer needle and the<br>
second-fuel cavity is an annular space between the inner needle and the outer needle.<br>
At least one of an inner spring and the second control chamber is preferably<br>
disposed within the hollow inner valve housing for biasing the inner needle in the<br><br>
closed position. The cap is preferably dynamically disposed within the control<br>
chamber associated with the outer needle. The present injection valve preferably<br>
further comprises an outer spring disposed between the cap and the valve body. The<br>
outer spring thereby contributes to biasing the outer needle in the closed position.<br>
In another embodiment of the present injection valve, the dual needle<br>
assembly further comprises:<br>
a cap dynamically disposed within the control chamber associated<br>
with the outer needle whereby a closing force can be transmitted through the<br>
cap to the outer needle; and<br>
an inner spring disposed between the cap and a member associated<br>
with the inner needle.<br>
The inner spring contributes to biasing the inner needle in the closed position by<br>
imparting a closing force through the member to the inner needle. The inner spring<br>
can also contribute to biasing the outer needle in the closed position by expanding to<br>
space the cap from the outer needle.<br>
In another embodiment of the present injection valve, the outer needle<br>
preferably further comprises a shoulder disposed within the control chamber<br>
associated with the outer needle. The outer needle is thereby movable to the open<br>
position when the control chamber is filled with hydraulic fluid at rail pressure. The<br>
present injection valve preferably further comprises a spring disposed between the<br>
dual needle assembly and the injection valve body for biasing the outer needle in the<br>
closed position.<br>

and the inner needle which contributes to biasing the inner needle in the<br>
closed position; and<br>

fuel to be ejected from an inner fuel cavity within the inner valve body when<br>
the inner needle is in the open position.<br>
In one embodiment of the present dual needle assembly, the inner fuel cavity<br>
is preferably an annular volume disposed between the inner needle and the outer<br>
needle. The inner needle preferably has an outer diameter less than the inside<br>
diameter of the hollow outer needle. The inner valve body preferably further<br>
comprises a hollow inner valve housing disposed between and joined to the outer<br>
needle and the cap. The inner valve housing preferably comprises a bore for<br>
housing the inner spring and the space defined by the bore is sealed from the inner<br>

when the first scaling surface is urged against a first seat associated with the<br>
injection valve body, and an open position when the first sealing surface is<br>
spaced apart from the first seat;<br>
a cap associated with and detached from the open end of the outer<br>
needle, wherein the cap can be dynamically disposed within a control<br>
chamber of the injection valve body such that hydraulic fluid pressure within<br>
the control chamber can apply a force that is transmitted through the cap to<br>
the outer needle to influence the position of the cap and outer needle;<br>
an inner needle dynamically disposed within the outer needle, the<br>
inner needle comprising a supported end opposite to a sealing end, which<br>
comprises a second sealing surface, wherein the inner needle is movable<br>
within the outer needle between a closed position when the second sealing<br>
surface is urged against a second seat associated with the outer needle, and<br>

cap away from the outer needle; and<br><br>
at least one fuel ejection port that allows fuel to be ejected from an<br>
inner fuel cavity within the hollow outer needle when the inner needle is in<br>
the open position.<br>
In one embodiment of the present dual needle assembly, the supported end of<br>

A method of operating a dual fuel injection valve independently and<br>
separately injects two different fuels into a combustion chamber of an internal<br>
combustion engine. The method comprises:<br>

hydraulically actuated by selectively supplying or draining a pressurized hydraulic<br>
fluid from a piston chamber within which an intensifier piston is dynamically<br><br>
disposed. The present method preferably further comprises selectively operating an<br>
electronically controlled valve to control the flow of the hydraulic fluid to and from<br>
the piston chamber.<br>
In another embodiment of the present method, a compressed spring<br>
preferably contributes to the second closing force. The present method preferably<br>
further comprises utilizing hydraulic fluid pressure in a second control chamber to<br>
contribute to the second closing force applied to the second needle.<br>
Another method of operating a dual fuel injection valve independently and<br>
separately injects two different fuels into a combustion chamber of an internal<br>
combustion engine. The method comprises:<br>

the first fuel from being injected into the combustion chamber by<br>
holding the first needle in a closed position against a first seat;<br>
(c)	selectively injecting the first fuel into the combustion chamber from<br>
the first-fuel cavity by at least one of applying a first opening force to<br>
the first needle that is greater than the first closing force and reducing<br>
the first closing force such that the first needle is spaced apart from<br>
the first seat;<br>

pressure where the respective injection valves are each independently actuable for<br>
separately injecting pilot fuel and main fuel.<br>
Figures 13 through 15 depict a preferred arrangement for a dual needle assembly<br>
for an injection valve. This embodiment of a dual needle assembly can be employed, for<br>
example, in an injection valve of the type depicted in Figures 3 through 5. Figure 13 is a<br>
side elevation view, Figure 14 is a section view, and Figure 15 is an exploded view.<br>
Figures 16 through 18 depict another preferred arrangement for a dual<br>
needle assembly for an injection valve. This embodiment of a dual needle<br>
assembly can also be employed, for example, in an injection valve of the type depicted in<br><br>
Figures 3 through 5. Figure 16 is a side elevation view, Figure 17 is a section<br>
view, and Figure 18 is an exploded view.<br>
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiment(s)<br>
A dual fuel injection valve is capable of independently and separately<br>
injecting a pilot fuel and a main fuel into a combustion chamber of an internal<br>
combustion engine. That is, the injection valve provides independent control of the<br>
injection timing and the fuel quantity for the pilot fuel and main fuel. In addition,<br>
the pilot fuel and main fuel are injected into the combustion chamber separately,<br>
through different ejection ports.<br>
The main fuel is a fuel that is cleaner burning than conventional diesel fuel<br>
such mat substitution of the main fuel for diesel fuel results in lower emissions of<br>
particulate matter and/or nitrogen oxides (NOx) compared to an equivalent<br>
conventional engine that burns only diesel fuel. Preferably, on average, the main<br>
fuel comprises more than 90% of the fuel consumed by the engine measured on an<br>
energy basis.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the main fuel is a gaseous fuel such as natural<br>
gas, propane or hydrogen, and the pilot fuel is a liquid fuel such as diesel or<br>
dimethylether. The injection of the main fuel is independent from the injection of<br>
the pilot fuel so that, for example, at least some of the gaseous fuel is injectable<br>
sequentially after the liquid fuel. The selected liquid fuel auto-ignites to promote<br>
combustion of the main fuel.<br>
In the illustrated embodiments, the dual fuel injection valve is operated using<br>
a constant high-pressure source of hydraulic fluid and at least one electrically-<br>
operated electronically-controlled hydraulic fluid control valves. The control<br>
valve(s) control the flow of hydraulic fluid to manipulate at least one of two valve<br>
needles. A first valve needle moves between an open and closed position for<br>
controlling the injection of the main fuel into the combustion chamber. A second<br>
valve needle moves between an open and closed position for controlling the injection<br>
of the pilot fuel into the combustion chamber.<br><br>
Referring to the drawings, Figures 1 and 2 show front and side elevation<br>
views of an embodiment of a dual fuel injection valve. The exterior of the valve<br>
body can be shaped to fit the opening in the cylinder head in which it is to be<br>
installed. In this embodiment, two electrically-operated electronically-controlled<br>
hydraulic fluid control valves are used, one to control the injection of the main fuel<br>
and one to control the injection of the pilot fuel. Specifically, Figure 1 shows a<br>
front view of the exterior of dual fuel injection valve 1, with dual solenoids 2 and 3<br>
at one end and main fuel ejection ports 4 and pilot fuel ejection ports 5 at the<br>
opposite end. Solenoids 2 and 3 electrically operate the hydraulic fluid control<br>
valves. Conventional electronic controls can be used to control the activation of<br>
solenoids 2 and 3 to thereby control the timing and quantity of the injection events<br>
whereby the two different fuels are separately introduced into the combustion<br>
chamber.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a side view of dual fuel injection valve 1. In Figure 2,<br>
solenoid 3 is hidden behind solenoid 2.<br>
Since the exterior of injection valve 1 as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2<br>
remains generally the same for the different internal embodiments, for purposes of<br>
brevity, and to eliminate redundancy, Figures 1 and 2 are not repeated.<br>
With reference now to Figures 3 through 5, these Figures show respective<br>
detail, side, and front section views of a first embodiment of dual fuel injection<br>
valve 1 taken along respective sections lines C-C, A-A, and B-B shown externally in<br>
Figures 1 and 2. This embodiment uses high-pressure hydraulic fluid to bias main<br>
fuel valve needle 17 in the closed position.<br>
Injection valve 1 can comprise the following features for controlling the flow<br>
of hydraulic fluid:<br>
(a)	three fluid inlets 6, 7, and 8;<br>
(b)	two drain ports 9 and 10;<br>
(c)	main fuel control solenoid 2;<br>
(d)	pilot fuel control solenoid 3;<br>
(e)	main fuel control valve 11;<br><br>
(f) main fuel control valve spring 12;<br>
(g) pilot fuel control valve 13; and<br>
(h) pilot fuel control valve spring 14.<br>
Preferably the hydraulic fluid and the pilot fuel are the same fluid and fluid<br>
inlets 6, 7 and 8 are all connected to a high pressure manifold, known as a<br>
"common rail" when the same manifold serves a plurality of injection valves in a<br>
multi-cylinder engine. Persons skilled in the technology involved here will<br>
understand that interior fluid passages can be employed to reduce the number of<br>
fluid inlets and drain ports in a substantially equivalent structure.<br>
A control valve for injection valve 1 controls the flow of hydraulic fluid into<br>
and out of the body of injection valve 1 by controlling whether or not hydraulic fluid<br>
passages are fluidly connected to at least one of inlets 7 and 8, or at least one of<br>
respective drain ports 9 and 10. In the illustrated embodiment, valves 11 and 13 are<br>
two-way valves and are mechanically biased (by springs 12 and 14) in respective<br>
positions such that the hydraulic fluid passages that lead to respective drain ports 9<br>
and 10 are blocked (as shown in Figure 4). In this embodiment, inlets 7 and 8 are<br>
always open, but flow is restricted by respective orifices 7a and 8a. Other valve<br>
arrangements can be employed for controlling the flow of hydraulic fluid. For<br>
example, instead of orifice 7a or 8a, injection valve 1 can employ a three-way<br>
control valve such as, for example, a spool valve or a rotary valve, that alternately<br>
closes the respective inlet or outlet.<br>
Injection valve 1 also preferably includes integral pilot fuel intensifier 15,<br>
which is illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. Intensifier 15 is fluidly linked to pilot fuel<br>
control valve 13.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, check valve 30 is associated with intensifier 15.<br>
Fluid passage 19, as seen in Figures 3 and 5, connects pilot fuel inlet 6 to intensifier<br>
15 through check valve 30. That is, check valve 30 permits the one-way flow of<br>
pilot fuel from fluid passage 19 into space 27 below intensifier 15.<br>
Injection valve 1 has a dual fuel needle assembly that comprises two<br>
concentric needle valves. Outer needle 17 is a hollow body disposed around inner<br><br>
needle 16. In preferred embodiments, outer needle 17 controls the injection of one<br>
fuel into the combustion chamber and inner needle 16 controls the injection of a<br>
second fuel into the combustion chamber.<br>
The hollow body that is outer needle 17 also serves as the body for the inner<br>
needle valve assembly. The inner needle valve is in the closed position when a<br>
sealing surface of inner needle 16 is urged against a seat that is provided by a<br>
sealing surface of outer needle 17. In the illustrated embodiment of Figures 3<br>
through 5, inner needle 16 is biased in the closed position by inner spring 18 in<br>
combination with the pressure of the hydraulic fluid within hydraulic fluid chamber<br>
20.<br>
A series of fuel ejection ports 4 are formed in the injection valve body at the<br>
tip of injection valve 1. A second series of fuel ejection ports 5 are formed in the<br>
tip of outer needle 17. Ejection ports 4 and 5 and the associated sealing surfaces of<br>
needles 16 and 17 are located at the tip of injection valve 1 to provide immediate<br>
injection of the main fuel and pilot fuel into the engine combustion chamber (not<br>
shown).<br>
Outer needle 17 preferably controls the injection of gaseous main fuel since<br>
larger ejection ports are generally required for injecting larger quantities of main<br>
fuel compared to pilot fuel, and larger fuel ejection ports are more easily<br>
accommodated in the valve body rather than in the tip of outer needle 17. The<br>
smaller pilot fuel ejection ports can be can be easily accommodated in tip of outer<br>
needle 17.<br>
Main fuel control valve 11 controls the flow of hydraulic fluid from chamber<br>
20 to drain 10. When main fuel control valve 11 is in a closed position, high<br>
pressure hydraulic fluid flows through inlet 8 and orifice 8a and fills chamber 20.<br>
When main fuel control valve 11 is switched to an open position, hydraulic fluid<br>
drains from chamber 20 faster than it can be replenished through orifice 8a.<br>
Consequently, when main fuel control valve is open, the pressure within chamber 20<br>
drops from the high pressure that is in the supply manifold ("rail pressure"), to close<br>
to drain pressure and the pressure of the main fuel in chamber 22 applies an opening<br><br>
force to a shoulder area of outer needle 17, causing outer needle 17 to retract within<br>
the injection valve body so that fuel within chamber 22 flows into the combustion<br>
chamber through ejection ports 4.<br>
Main fuel cavity 22 is located in the bottom region of injection valve 1 and<br>
surrounds the lower portion of main fuel needle 17. The main fuel, which in<br>
preferred embodiments is gaseous fuel such as natural gas, is supplied to cavity 22<br>
through inlet 23.<br>
Differential pressures within injection valve 1 and particularly between main<br>
fuel cavity 22 and the other cavities within the main body of injection valve 1 are<br>
preferably sealed by a fluid seal comprising hydraulic fluid disposed within fluid<br>
seal cavity 24, as best seen in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
Hydraulic fluid is supplied to the injection valve through a supply manifold<br>
or common rail at a substantially constant pressure. For example, in vehicular<br>
applications, an engine driven pump can be employed to pressurize the hydraulic<br>
fluid that is directed to the common rail. When the hydraulic fluid is different from<br>
the pilot fuel, the hydraulic fluid is introduced through ports 7 and 8 and the pilot<br>
fuel is introduced through inlet port 6. More preferably, the pilot fuel is a liquid<br>
fuel such as diesel, which can also be employed as the hydraulic fluid, and pilot fuel<br>
is supplied to ports 6, 7 and 8 from a common pressurized system or common rail.<br>
The rail pressure is the pressure of the fluid in the common rail.<br>
The operation of the injection valve illustrated in Figures 3 through 5 is<br>
described herein for an embodiment that employs a gaseous fuel as the main fuel<br>
and a liquid fuel as the pilot fuel.<br>
Inlet ports 7 and 8 are in constant fluid communication with respective<br>
chambers 25 and 20. Between injection events, main fuel needle 17 and inner<br>
needle 16 are in the closed position where they prevent fluid flow through respective<br>
ejection ports 4 and 5. Main fuel control valve 11 and pilot fuel control valve 13<br>
are both in the closed position and the fluid pressure within chambers 25 and 20 is<br>
substantially equal to the rail pressure of the hydraulic fluid that is introduced<br>
through respective ports 7 and 8. Pressurized pilot fuel flows through inlet port 6 to<br><br>
fill space 27 below intensifier 15 via fluid passage 19 (see Figure 3). However,<br>
because the intensifier piston surface area facing chamber 25 is larger than the<br>
intensifier surface area facing space 27 and the space between them is vented to<br>
drain, when second control valve 13 is closed, intensifier 15 assumes a position that<br>
maximizes the volume of chamber 25 and minimizes the volume of space 27 (as<br>
shown in Figures 3 and 4).<br>
Inlet port 6 also supplies pressurized fluid to fluid seal cavity 24, where the<br>
pilot fuel provides a fluid seal around moveable outer needle 17. When pilot fuel is<br>
used for sealing, the pilot fuel is pressurized to a pressure equal to or slightly higher<br>
than that of the main gaseous fuel pressure within fuel cavity 22 to prevent the<br>
gaseous fuel from leaking past fluid seal cavity 24 (see Figures 4 and 5). However,<br>
sealing fluid pressure is preferably controlled so that it is equal to or not too much<br>
greater than gaseous fuel pressure, since it is also undesirable for excessive amounts<br>
of sealing fluid to leak into fuel cavity 22.<br>
Between injection events, when injection valve 1 is not injecting fuel, main<br>
fuel control solenoid 2 and pilot fuel control solenoid 3 (see Figure 4) are de-<br>
energized and control valves 11 and 13 are both biased in the closed position by<br>
respective control valve springs 12 and 14. The pressurized hydraulic fluid in<br>
chamber 20 that has been delivered through port 8 maintains outer needle 17 in a<br>
closed position and can also help to maintain inner needle 16 in a closed position.<br>
The compartment that houses inner spring 18 can be fluidly connected or sealed<br>
from chamber 20. When the spring compartment is fluidly connected to chamber<br>
20, the pressure within the compartment is about equal to the pressure in chamber<br>
20. When the spring compartment is sealed from chamber 20, the pressure within<br>
the compartment can be the same as the hydraulic fluid pressure at inlet 7 or at drain<br>
9. Depending upon the fluid pressure within the spring compartment, some or all of<br>
the closing force applied to inner needle 16 is provided by inner spring 18.<br>
In the embodiments of Figures 3 through 6, the metering of pilot fuel by<br>
injection valve 1 is accomplished by intensifier 15 that also serves to elevate the<br>
pressure of the pilot fuel to thereby open the inner needle valve. When pilot fuel<br><br>
control valve 13 is opened, hydraulic fluid pressure within chamber 25 is reduced to<br>
drain pressure and the pressure of the pilot fuel in space 27 is sufficient to lift the<br>
intensifier plunger. When the desired amount of pilot fuel has been drawn into<br>
space 27, pilot fuel control valve 13 is closed and hydraulic fluid pressure within<br>
chamber 25 is again elevated to a pressure close to rail pressure. Under the<br>
influence of the high pressure hydraulic fluid in chamber 25, the intensifier plunger<br>
moves downward to compress and pressurize the pilot fuel in space 27. The<br>
elevated pressure of the pilot fuel ensures mat check valve 30 remains closed and the<br>
pressurized pilot fuel is directed into the inner needle valve assembly through fluid<br>
passage 26; the pressurized pilot fuel causes inner needle 16 to move to an open<br>
position against the bias imposed by inner spring 18 and the fluid pressure within the<br>
spring compartment, if any. Inner needle 16 returns to the closed position under the <br>
influence of inner spring 18 when after the injection of pilot fuel into me combustion<br>
chamber relieves the pressure of me pilot fuel widiin me inner needle assembly.<br>
Inner spring 18 is disposed around inner needle stop 21, which is located<br>
above inner needle 16. In me illustrated embodiments, inner needle stop 21 includes<br>
a stem mat limits the travel of inner needle 16. While inner needle stop 21 is<br>
depicted as a separate piece from inner needle 16, inner needle stop 21 and inner<br>
needle 16 can also be integrated into a single piece which would be functionally<br>
equivalent in limiting me travel of inner needle 16. However, an additional<br>
advantage of employing two separate pieces is mat it is easier to fabricate two pieces<br>
because portions of inner needle 16 are match-fit with outer needle 17. As two<br>
separate pieces, inner needle stop 21 can function without being perfectly aligned<br>
with inner needle 16 and dimensional irregularities in the associated manufactured<br>
components can be accommodated.<br>
The injection of me main gaseous fuel takes place when me main fuel control<br>
valve 11 opens to fluidly connect chamber 20 with drain port 10. The hydraulic<br>
fluid in chamber 20 drains through drain port 10 faster man it can be replenished<br>
from inlet port 8 mrough orifice 8a. Consequently, me pressure in chamber 20 is<br>
reduced allowing the high pressure of the gaseous fuel in cavity 22 to lift main fuel<br><br>
needle 17 into the open position to thereby inject the gaseous fuel within cavity 22<br>
into the engine combustion chamber through ejection ports 4. The injection of<br>
gaseous fuel stops when main fuel control valve 11 is closed so that the pressure of<br>
the hydraulic fluid within chamber 20 is restored to rail pressure, causing gaseous-<br>
fuel needle 17 to move to a closed position, closing ejection ports 4.<br>
Figures 6, 7, and 8 show respective detail, side, and front section views of a<br>
second embodiment of the double solenoid dual fuel injection valve shown externally<br>
in Figures 1 and 2, with the respective sections taken along section lines C-C, A-A<br>
and B-B. This second embodiment has many components that are equivalent to like<br>
components of the embodiment presented in Figures 3, 4 and 5, and like<br>
components are identified by like reference numbers. The main difference between<br>
the first and second embodiments is that in the second embodiment outer spring 28<br>
biases outer needle 17 in the closed position and high pressure hydraulic fluid is<br>
used to move outer needle 17 to the open position opposed to the arrangement of the<br>
first embodiment which employs hydraulic fluid pressure to hold outer needle 17 in<br>
the closed position.<br>
With reference to Figure 7, high-pressure hydraulic fluid enters injection<br>
valve 1 through fluid inlet 8. Main fuel control valve 11 is a two-way valve that<br>
controls the hydraulic fluid pressure within fluid passage 29 by controlling the flow<br>
of hydraulic fluid through drain port 10. When two-way main fuel control valve 11<br>
moves to its closed position, the fluid connection to drain port 10 is closed, causing<br>
the pressure in cavity 29b to increase. Rail pressure in cavity 29b and the gaseous<br>
fuel pressure in cavity 22 combine to generate opening forces acting on outer needle<br>
17 that are sufficient to overcome the closing force of outer spring 28, thereby<br>
moving main fuel needle 17 to the open position. The main fuel within cavity 22 is<br>
then injected mrough ejection ports 4, which are provided in the hollow tip of<br>
injection valve 1. An outer needle stop, similar to inner needle stop 21, limits the<br>
travel of outer needle 17 by limiting the compression of outer spring 28. The<br>
injection of gaseous fuel stops when main fuel control valve is opened and the<br>
hydraulic fluid pressure within cavity 29b is reduced from rail pressure to drain<br><br>
pressure. Under the influence of outer spring 28 outer needle 17 returns to the<br>
closed position with the sealing surface of needle 17 seated against a corresponding<br>
sealing surface of the valve body.<br>
The remaining features of the injection valve depicted in the second<br>
embodiment function substantially the same as those described with reference to the<br>
first embodiment.<br>
Figures 9 through 12 shows four different embodiments of another<br>
embodiment of a hydraulically actuated dual fuel injection valve for independently<br>
and separately injecting a main fuel and a pilot fuel into a combustion chamber.<br>
Each needle is associated with a respective control chamber in which the hydraulic<br>
fluid pressure can be independently controlled to influence the movement of the<br>
respective needle.<br>
In the embodiments of Figures 9 and 10, high-pressure hydraulic fluid biases<br>
both the outer needle and the inner needle in the closed position. When hydraulic<br>
fluid pressure in a first control chamber is equal to rail pressure, the outer needle is<br>
held in the closed position, and when the pressure in the first control chamber is<br>
reduced to drain pressure, the outer needle moves to the open position under the<br>
influence of the fuel pressure acting on the outer needle. The hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure in a second control chamber is similarly controlled to influence the<br>
movement of the inner needle.<br>
In the embodiments of Figures 11 and 12, the inner and outer needles are<br>
spring biased in the closed position and hydraulic fluid at rail pressure directed to<br>
respective control chambers for the inner and outer valve needles to move them to<br>
the open position.<br>
The pressure in the first and second control chambers is independently<br>
controlled so that the movements of the outer needle and the inner needle can be<br>
independent from one another.<br>
With reference to all of the embodiments of Figures 9 through 12, like<br>
components are identified by like reference numbers. In these embodiments,<br><br>
injection valve 501 generally comprises the following features for controlling the<br>
flow of hydraulic fluid:<br>
(a)	at least one hydraulic fluid inlet such as 507 and/or 508;<br>
(b)	at least one drain port such as 509 and/or 510;<br>
(c)	main fuel hydraulic fluid control valve 511;<br>
(d)	pilot fuel hydraulic fluid control valve 513;<br>
(e)	main fuel control chamber 542; and<br>
(f)	pilot fuel control chamber 540.<br>
Some of the features common to more than one embodiment will be<br>
described in overview prior to describing the operation of each embodiment.<br>
In me embodiments illustrated in Figures 9 and 10, me pilot fuel and the<br>
hydraulic fluid can be different fluids and a separate pilot fuel inlet port 506 is<br>
provided. However, if the pilot fuel and the hydraulic fluid are the same fluid a<br>
single common rail can be employed to supply fluid to the hydraulic fluid passages<br>
and to me fuel cavities within the pilot fuel valve assembly.<br>
In the embodiments illustrated in Figures 11 and 12, the hydraulic actuation<br>
fluid for inner needle 516 and the pilot fuel are the same fluid, which avoids<br>
separate inlet ports for the pilot fuel and the hydraulic fluid for actuating the inner<br>
needle.<br>
Main fuel hydraulic fluid control valves 511 and pilot fuel hydraulic fluid<br>
control valve 513 are generally the same as the hydraulic fluid control valves<br>
described with reference to previously described embodiments. That is, hydraulic<br>
fluid control valves 511 and 513 employ a solenoid that is energized to move and<br>
hold the valve in one position. When the solenoid is de-energized, a spring moves<br>
and holds the valve in an opposite position. The operation of the injection valves<br>
will be described in more detail below, but generally, different valve types can be<br>
employed to control the flow of high pressure hydraulic fluid to and from control<br>
chambers 540 and 542. For example, Figures 9 and 11 show two-way valves for<br>
controlling hydraulic fluid flow and Figures 10 and 12 show three way valves.<br><br>
Like the embodiments of injection valve 1 shown in Figures 3 through 8,<br>
injection valve 501 has a dual fuel needle assembly that comprises two concentric<br>
needle valves. Outer needle 517 is a hollow body disposed around inner needle<br>
516. In preferred embodiments, outer needle 517 controls the injection of a gaseous<br>
main fuel into the combustion chamber and inner needle 516 controls the injection of<br>
a liquid pilot fuel into the combustion chamber.<br>
Inner needle stop 521 limits the travel of inner needle 516 and outer needle<br>
stop 531 limits the travel of outer needle 517.<br>
The hollow body that is outer needle 517 also serves as the body tor the<br>
inner needle valve assembly. The inner needle valve is in the closed position when<br>
a sealing surface of inner needle 516 is urged against a seat that is a sealing surface<br>
of outer needle 517.<br>
A series of fuel ejection ports 504 are formed in the injection valve body at<br>
the tip of injection valve 501. A second series of fuel ejection ports 505 are formed<br>
in the tip of outer needle 517, which provide an opening for ejecting the pilot fuel<br>
into the engine combustion chamber when the inner needle valve is in an open<br>
position. Ejection ports 504 and 505 and the associated tips of needles 516 and 517<br>
are located proximate to each other at the tip of injection valve 501 to provide<br>
immediate injection of the main fuel and pilot fuel into the engine combustion<br>
chamber (not shown).<br>
Differential pressures within injection valve 501 and particularly between<br>
main fuel cavity 522 and the other cavities within the main body of injection valve<br>
501 are preferably sealed by a fluid seal comprising hydraulic fluid disposed within<br>
fluid seal cavity 524. In the embodiments of Figures 15 and 16, instead of a<br>
separate fluid seal cavity, the cavity employed for supplying liquid pilot fuel to the<br>
inner needle assembly can also serve as a fluid seal. This is conveniently<br>
accomplished when the pilot fuel supplied from the common rail to the pilot fuel<br>
cavity is already at injection pressure since this pressure can be set to substantially<br>
match or slightly exceed the pressure of the gaseous fuel directed to main fuel cavity<br><br>
522 through inlet 523. In the embodiments of Figures 11 and 12 a separate fluid<br>
seal cavity is employed because pilot fuel pressure is not always at rail pressure.<br>
The operation of the different embodiments of injection valve 501 illustrated<br>
in Figures 9 through 12 will be described below in relation to an injection valve that<br>
employs a gaseous fuel as the main fuel and a liquid pilot fuel as the pilot fuel.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 9, when hydraulic fluid control valves 511 and<br>
513 are de-energized, these control valves are both spring-biased in the seated<br>
position to prevent hydraulic fluid from being drained from respective control<br>
chambers 542 and 540. Hydraulic fluid at rail pressure is supplied to control<br>
chambers 542 and 540 through inlets 507 and 508. The hydraulic fluid pressure<br>
within chambers 542 and 540 is thus normally maintained at rail pressure to apply a<br>
closing force to respective needles 517 and 516, in conjunction with the closing<br>
forces applied by springs 528 and 518.<br>
When the solenoid for main fuel hydraulic fluid control valve 511 is<br>
energized, this control valve opens and hydraulic fluid from main fuel control<br>
chamber 542 drains through drain port 510 faster than it can be replenished through<br>
inlet 508 because flow through inlet 508 is restricted by orifice 508a. Consequently,<br>
when main fuel hydraulic fluid control valve 511 is energized, the main fuel within<br>
main fuel cavity 522 is ejected from injection valve 501 through ejection ports 504<br>
because outer needle 517 moves to the open position under the influence of gaseous<br>
fuel pressure acting on shoulder 517a which overcomes the closing force of outer<br>
spring 528 and the drain pressure within control chamber 542. The main fuel<br>
injection event ends when the solenoid is again de-energized and control chamber<br>
542 is again filled with hydraulic fluid at rail pressure.<br>
In this embodiment, because the pilot fuel is supplied to injection valve 501<br>
at injection pressure, there is no internal intensifier and inner needle 516 is operated<br>
in a manner very similar to outer needle 517. When the solenoid for pilot fuel<br>
hydraulic fluid control valve 513 is energized, this control valve opens and hydraulic<br>
fluid from pilot fuel control chamber 540 drains through drain port 509 faster than it<br>
can be replenished through inlet 507 because flow through inlet 507 is restricted by<br><br>
orifice 507a. Consequently, when the solenoid for pilot fuel hydraulic fluid control<br>
valve 513 is energized, the pilot fuel within the inner needle assembly is ejected<br>
from injection valve 501 through ejection ports 505 because inner needle 516 moves<br>
to the open position under the influence of pilot fuel pressure acting on shoulder<br>
516a which overcomes the closing force of inner spring 518 and the drain pressure<br>
within control chamber 540. The pilot fuel injection event ends when the solenoid is<br>
again de-energized and control chamber 540 is again filled with hydraulic fluid at<br>
rail pressure.<br>
The embodiment of Figure 10 operates in substantially the same way as the<br>
embodiment of Figure 9 except that instead of employing two-way control valves<br>
with orifices to restrict flow through hydraulic fluid inlets 507 and 508, the<br>
embodiment of Figure 10 employs three-way control valves employing a spool-style<br>
valve to alternate between connecting control chambers 540 and 542 with respective<br>
inlets 507 and 508 or drain ports 509 and 510. In the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
spool valves are spring biased to connect control chambers 540 and 542 with<br>
respective inlets 507 and 508. The needles 516 and 517 are thus normally in the<br>
closed position because respective control chambers 540 and 542 are normally filled<br>
with hydraulic fluid at rail pressure. A main fuel or pilot fuel injection event is<br>
initiated by energizing the solenoid for the respective hydraulic fluid control valve<br>
(513 for pilot fuel and 511 for main fuel). Energizing the solenoid moves the spool<br>
valve to a position that connects the respective control chamber with the drain port<br>
instead of the inlet.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 11, hydraulic fluid control valves 511 and 513<br>
are both spring- biased in the open position so that when their respective solenoids<br>
are de-energized, these control valves connect the hydraulic fluid passages and<br>
control chambers within injection valve 501 with drain ports 509 and 510. That is,<br>
when the control valve solenoids are de-energized, hydraulic fluid pressure within<br>
injection valve 501 is at drain pressure and inner spring 518 and outer spring 528<br>
provide the forces needed to maintain inner needle 516 and outer needle 517 in their<br>
respective closed positions.<br><br>
In the embodiment of Figure 11, the pilot and the hydraulic fluid are the<br>
same fluid and a pilot fuel injection event is initiated by energizing the solenoid of<br>
pilot fuel hydraulic fluid control valve 513 to close drain port 509 so that pilot fuel<br>
at rail pressure fills the fuel cavity of the inner needle assembly. The pilot fuel<br>
pressure exerts an opening force on shoulder 516a of inner needle 516 that<br>
overcomes the closing force of inner spring 518, and pilot fuel is ejected from<br>
injection valve 501 through pilot fuel ejection ports 503. The pilot fuel injection<br>
event is terminated de-energizing the solenoid to re-open pilot fuel hydraulic fluid<br>
control valve 513 so that pilot fuel pressure within the inner needle assembly is<br>
reduced to drain pressure, and inner spring 518 causes inner needle 516 to move to<br>
the closed position. In the illustrated embodiment, inner spring chamber 550 is not<br>
pressurized and pilot fuel that migrates from the inner needle assembly to inner<br>
spring chamber 550 is recovered by being sent to the drain system.<br>
A main fuel injection event in the embodiment of Figure 11 is controlled in a<br>
similar manner to a pilot fuel injection event of the same embodiment. By<br>
energizing the solenoid of main fuel hydraulic fluid control valve 511 to close drain<br>
port 510, hydraulic fluid at rail pressure fills control chamber 542 to exert an<br>
opening force on should 517b of outer needle 517 which combines with the opening<br>
force exerted by the pressure of the gaseous fuel on shoulder 517a to overcome the<br>
closing force of outer spring 528. These opening forces cause outer needle 517 to<br>
move to the open position to allow main fuel to be ejected from injection valve 501<br>
through main fuel ejection ports 504. The main fuel injection event is terminated by<br>
re-opening main fuel hydraulic fluid control valve 511 so that hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure within control chamber 542 is reduced to drain pressure, and outer spring<br>
528 causes outer needle 517 to move to the closed position. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, outer spring chamber 552 is not pressurized and hydraulic fluid that<br>
migrates from control chamber 542 to outer spring chamber 552 is recovered by<br>
being sent to the drain system.<br>
The embodiment of Figure 12 operates in substantially the same way as the<br>
embodiment of Figure 11 except that instead of employing two-way control valves<br><br>
with orifices to restrict flow through hydraulic fluid inlets 507 and 508, the<br>
embodiment of Figure 12 employs three-way control valves employing a spool-style<br>
valve to alternate between connecting needle valve assemblies with respective inlets<br>
507 and 508 or drain ports 509 and 510. In the illustrated embodiment, the spool<br>
valves are spring biased to connect the pilot fuel and main fuel needle valve<br>
assemblies with respective drain ports 509 and 510. The needles 516 and 517 are<br>
thus normally in the closed position because hydraulic fluid at rail pressure is<br>
employed to open the needle valves. A main fuel or pilot fuel injection event is<br>
initiated by energizing the solenoid for the respective hydraulic fluid control valve<br>
(513 for pilot fuel and 511 for main fuel). Energizing the solenoid moves the spool<br>
valve to a position that connects the respective needle valve assembly with an inlet<br>
instead of a drain port.<br>
Figures 13 through 18 depict two different embodiments of a dual needle<br>
assembly that can be employed by an injection valve for independently injecting two<br>
different fuels through separate ejection ports. With reference to both embodiments<br>
illustrated in Figures 13 through 18, an inner spring provides the closing force that<br>
biases the inner needle in the closed position, and hydraulic fluid pressure applied to<br>
the top of the dual needle assembly provides the closing force that biases the outer<br>
needle in the closed position.<br>
With reference to Figures 13 through 15, dual needle valve assembly 600<br>
comprises outer needle 617 and cap 620. Tip 607 is the portion of the assembly that<br>
protrudes through an opening in the valve body as shown, for example, in Figure 4.<br>
Pilot fuel ejection ports 605 are positioned on the end of tip 607, as shown in Figure<br>
9.<br>
Outer needle 617 features shoulder 610 that is disposable in a main fuel<br>
cavity such as main fuel cavity 22 shown in Figure 4. The fuel pressure in the main<br>
fuel cavity applies a hydraulic force to the shoulder area that causes outer needle<br>
617 to move to the open position when the pressure above cap 620 is reduced to<br>
drain pressure.<br><br>
Because cap 620 is not attached to outer needle 617, inner spring 618 can<br>
expand to space cap 620 away from outer needle 617. For example, when rail<br>
pressure is reduced but still higher than drain pressure, inner spring 618 can<br>
contribute to the closing force that keeps outer needle 617 in the closed position. In<br>
this capacity inner spring 618 advantageously provides additional benefits in addition<br>
to its primary function of biasing inner needle 616 in the closed position.<br>
Needle stop 621 comprises stem 621b that limits the compression of inner<br>
spring 618 when the end of stem 621b is pressed against cap 620. Needle stop 621<br>
further comprises flange 621a which provides a seat for inner spring 618 so that the<br>
closing force applied by inner spring 618 is transferred through needle stop 621 to<br>
inner needle 616 and the end of outer needle 617 when cap 620 is spaced apart from<br>
outer needle 617.<br>
To reduce leakage, the portion of outer needle 617 between shoulder 610 and<br>
the end facing cap 620 is match-fit with the valve body, as is the outer diameter of<br>
cap 620.<br>
Pilot fuel port 615 provides a passage for supplying pilot fuel to the inner<br>
needle valve assembly. For example, with reference to Figure 4, port 615 would be<br>
aligned with the annular cavity that is supplied with fuel from intensifier 15 via fluid<br>
passage 26.<br>
Those skilled in the technology involved here will understand that an outer<br>
spring and an outer needle stop can be added to the top of the dual needle assembly<br>
illustrated in Figures 13 through 15, for an embodiment suitable for use in an<br>
injection valve of the type illustrated in Figures 6 through 8. In such an<br>
embodiment, outer needle 617 further comprises an additional shoulder, located, for<br>
example, between pilot fuel port 615 and the end facing cap 620, which is associated<br>
with a control chamber. Hydraulic fluid at rail pressure is directable to the control<br>
chamber to cause outer needle 617 to move to the open position. When hydraulic<br>
fluid pressure in the control chamber is reduced to drain pressure, the outer spring<br>
exerts a closing force on outer needle 617 that moves it to the closed position. In<br>
this embodiment, cap 620 can be attached to outer needle 617, for example, by a<br><br>
threaded connection, since in such an embodiment inner spring 618 does not add to<br>
the closing force of the outer spring.<br>
Another embodiment of the dual needle assembly is depicted in Figures 16<br>
through 18. Dual needle assembly 700 comprises an inner needle assembly that is<br>
similar to that of the previously described embodiments. That is, inner needle 716<br>
is biased in the closed position by inner spring 718 that transmits a closing force<br>
through the flange of inner needle stop 721. Inner needle 716 is disposed within<br>
hollow outer needle 717 and a sealing surface near the tip of inner needle 716 seats<br>
against a sealing surface of outer needle 717 when in the closed position. High<br>
pressure pilot fuel is directed to pilot fuel port 715 to move inner needle 716 to an<br>
open position.<br>
The inner needle assembly is housed within the hollow body of outer needle<br>
717, inner valve housing 730, and inner valve cap 722, which are all releasably<br>
joined to each other in a fixed relationship, for example, by threaded connections.<br>
Inner valve cap 722 and inner valve housing 730 could also be integrated as a single<br>
component if the arrangement is modified to allow inner spring 718 and inner needle<br>
stop 721 to be inserted from the bottom. The inner spring chamber, which houses<br>
inner spring 718 can be connected by port 732 to the hydraulic fluid system at rail<br>
pressure or drain pressure, or to the pressurized pilot fuel supply system. That is,<br>
the inner spring chamber need not be pressurized, but an advantage of filling this<br>
chamber with pressurized fluid is that the fluid pressure acts upon the flange of<br>
inner needle stop 721 to contribute to the closing forces applied to inner needle 716<br>
so that a smaller inner spring can be employed.<br>
Plunger 720 is match fit with the valve body with the top of plunger 720<br>
forming one of the boundaries for a hydraulic fluid chamber such as chamber 20<br>
shown in Figures 4 and 5. When the hydraulic fluid chamber is filled with<br>
hydraulic fluid at rail pressure, outer needle 717 is held in the closed position by a<br>
closing force mat is transmitted to it through plunger 720, inner valve cap 722, and<br>
inner valve housing 730. When the hydraulic fluid chamber is connected to a drain<br><br>
port and the pressure is reduced to drain pressure, the high pressure fuel acts on<br>
shoulder 710 to move outer needle 717 to the open position.<br>
Outer spring 724 is disposed between inner valve cap 722 and seating ring<br>
726 that is itself seated against a fixed annular ledge of the valve body. Outer<br>
spring 724 contributes to the closing force for outer needle 717 to keep it in the<br>
closed position when rail pressure is reduced but still higher than drain pressure.<br>
Outer spring 724 also helps to shape the injection pulse by slowing the outer needle<br>
rise time and accelerating the outer needle closing.<br>
Tip 707 is the portion of the assembly which passes through an opening in<br>
the valve body as shown, for example in Figure 4. Pilot fuel ejection ports 705 are<br>
positioned on the end of tip 707, as shown in Figure 12.<br>
To reduce leakage, the portion of outer needle 717 between shoulder 710 and<br>
the end joined to inner valve housing 730 is match-fit with the valve body.<br>
As will be apparent to those skilled on the art in the light of the foregoing<br>
disclosure, many alterations and modifications are possible in the practice of mis<br>
invention without departing from the scope thereof. Accordingly, the scope of the<br>

second fuel. The outer needle closes against a seal associated with the injection valve body and the inner needle closes against a seat<br>
associated with the outer needle.</td>
