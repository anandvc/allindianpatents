CERTIFICATE<br>
We, GUNTHER ENGINEERING GMBH, do hereby certify to the best of my knowledge, information and belief that the annexed specification is a true and complete translation in English of the specification as filed in connection with the International application No. PCT/EP00/03356 Dated 13/04/2000.<br>

Refrigerating system for domestic refrigerating appliances<br>
The invention concerns a hermetic motor compressor, a compressor piston, a „fluxo-mizer", and the use of the motor compressor, and the use of the motor compressor with piston and the "fluxomizer" in a refrigeration device in domestic cooling appliances.<br>
V The refrigeration cycles commonly used in domestic cooling appliances are commonly<br>
based on a compression machine. As a consequence, the cooling cycle consists of a compressor with a suction- and/or pressure damper, a condenser or an evaporator. As an expansion nozzle that is located between the condenser and the evaporator in domestic cooling applicances, a capillary tube is preferably used. The described components of the cooling cycle are used in multiple configurations, as they are used in refrigeration devices. The cooling aggregate is usually located at the bottom of the appliance, except the*|vaporator, which is integrated into the rear of the appliance or represents it. The disadvantage of commonly used refrigeration appliances is that every separate compo¬nent is mounted at the desired location. The cooling cycle is completed by connecting all components through tubes, which increases the technological complexity of the manufacturing process and the manufacturing costs.<br>
One solution is to pre-assemble the refrigeration unit, as it is known from the German registered design 92 06 167. Commonly used is a refrigerator of freezer with the con¬denser and compressor arranged in the base and cooled with a fan. Condenser, compres¬sor, and fan are located in a clossed cooling channel, where porous panels are positioned at the inflow and outflow sides. Both inflow and outflow sections are loated at one side of the base and are covered by design elements, such as doors or flaps. The side walls of the channel are covered with sound-absorbing material. The channel consists of an U-shaped ducl, it is connected to the base through elastic or elastomer elements. Further¬more, the compressor and/or the condenser are connected to the duct walls with elastic or clastomere elements, 01' they are supported by the bottom of the duct.<br>
The disadvantage of this COthmonly used configuration of positioning the described<br><br><br><br><br>
I<br><br>
components in the base is that they require the entire inner volume, implying difficulties for the acoustic insulation. Furthermore, the common configuration is designed for the base element of one particular domestic cooling appliance. Its use in a different model requires therefore design modifications.<br>
Regarding the desired performance of domestic cooling appliances, the storage condi-tiones of the cooled goods are essential. The temperature of the goods is commonly regulated by frequently switching the compressor on and off, referred to as an intermit¬tent operation of me refrigeration unit.<br>
As a result, the temperature in the cooling chamber fluctuates significantly, in particular after goods are put irito the refrigerator. A temperature difference between the cooling chamber and the surface of the evaporator is the consequence and dries out the goods. Turning away from the intermittent operation can be achieved by an evaporator with an latent heat exchanger, as described in the German description of invention 39 26 250 Al. The evaporator is surrounded by a storage volume filled with a medium for cold storage, which is characterized by a phase-change at the particular temperature and by a heat capacity that corresponds to the heat input through the cooling goods for a given time of several hours. The compressor can therefore be operated close to the seeding temperature of the working fluid, where a fan improves the heat transfer be¬tween the evaporator surface and the cooling compartment through forced convection. A constant temperature in the storage compartment, a shorter time required to reach the desired temperature, and a less evident influence of the drying of the cooling goods is achieved.<br>
However, neither a more compact design of the components of the refrigeration unit nor the use of an evaporator with latent heat storage allow to reduce the production costs for domestic refrigeration appliances find to apply the thermodynamic clycle to technical refrigeration appliances such that with a reduced process energy a high specific cooling capacity becomes available. More recently, a reduction of environmentally compatible substances is required/desired.<br><br><br>
From these considerations results the motivation of this invention, a refrigeration unit for domestic applications, which reduces the complexity of its production and is appli¬cable in different situations without major modifications and, at the same time, uses the thermodynamic cycle in an efficient way.<br>
The task is solved with a cooling cycle of a refrigeration unit for domestic appliancers with a refrigerant as the working fluid. The refrigeration unit consists of a hermetic motor compressor, an condenser that is connected to the pressure-side of the motor compressor, and a capillary tube that is connected to the outflow side of the condenser that is in thermal contact with the inlet of the motor compressor, an evaporator con¬nected to the capillary tube and thermally coupled with the latent heat storage and con¬nected to the inlet side of the motor compressor, and a fan for enhancing free convection in the cooling compartment. The evaporator outlet is connected to a Fluxomizer at the inlet side of the motor compressor. The motor compressor and the Fluxomizer are elas-tically mounted on a chassis, where the maximum height of the chassis including the mounted components and the acoustic insulation is equal to the height of the socket height of the refrigeration appliance. One configuration of the refrigeration unit that is subject to this invention is characterized by a maximum building height of the chassis including ail mounted components and the acoustic insulation of 100 mm.<br>
The problem of the invention is also the realization of the design of the components of the refrigeratin plant, acc. to the invention.<br>
this concerns a hermetic motor compressor with a base and a cover of the case, which are hermetically interconnected. Inside of the case, an electric motor is with a located, where the electric connections, are hermetically done through the cover. With the cover of the case, the cylinder unit is hermetically connected, where a suction valve is located in the cylinder head. The stator packet of the motor is preferably pressed into the cover. A pressure pipe is hermetically lead through the den base of the case to the outside. Between the base and the cover, a tube is positioned, where its inner volume is con-<br>
4<br><br>
nectcd to the inner volume of the case and the pressure pipe with at least one hole at the circumference. The tube is used as a bearing shaft for the rotor packet of the electric motor. The upper bearing-housing of the rotor is made as an cylindrical slice, located in an excentric position with regard to the tube axis, and used as a stroke slice in such a way that the bearing of the connecting rod surrounded the surface of the cylindrical slice. The connecting rod which is swivel-mounted connected with the hearing of the connecting rod is connected with the oszillating piston at the cylinder. The piston is equipped with a pressure valve. The rotor packet can, in an appropriate form, provide an Schwungmassenausgleich. In a further development of the erfindungsgemaBen motor compressor, the cylinder unit is thermal coupled with a straight-line of liquid refriger¬ant. This straight-line is connected with the piston displacement by a hole at the cylinder wall insignificant above the lower dead-centre.. The connection between the straight-line and the piston displacement of the piston is preferably positioned at approximately 20° crank-angle above the dead-centre of the piston. The entrance of the straight-line is connected to the connection of the condenser with the capillary tube and the outlet of the straight-line at entrance of the condenser or at the pressure pipe.<br>
For the motor compressor ace. to the invention, a the invention characterizing compres¬sor piston used, which is with a to and fro going connecting rod inflexible connected. At the inner wall of the cylinder is a labiate gasket and a channel for the refrigerant with a valve which the channel opens during the compression-stroke and during the suction-stroke closes. At the to and fro going connecting rod a bell-shaped conducting part is inflexible connected which is built as a cylindrical and axial area. At the site of the compression area the a/m conducting part is placed radial overlooking and a plain pis¬ton-base is mounted. The edge of the other site of the piston-base from the cylindrical area of the conducting part is around angular to the inner wall of the cylinder.The con¬ducting part is at the cylindrical area surrounded by a sliding gasket which has an edge around at the cylinder wall. The conducting part has some ducts with openings at the compression side which during the compression-stroke the holes from the gasket set free and during the suciion-stroke are sealed. The connecting rod has a length of at least 8-times of the crankradius.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, the goal of the invention is solved through the design nof fluxomizer, which consists of a gas-liquid separator, in which the suction line is connected at the outlet of the evaporator ends.The gas-liquid separator consists of a liquid-collecting container and a suction-damper. The suction-damper is connected with the suction-socket of the compressor.The suction-damper is designed as an inner crossflow-heat exchanger. At the liquid-collecting container a standpipe is mounted Which ends as an injection-tube at the suction-socket of the compressor. The advantage of the fluxomizer is that the outlet is direct coupled with the suction-socket of the compressor. The inner crossllow-heat exchanger consists of the capillary tube that connects the condenser with a evaporator of the refrigeration unit, and the suction line. The capillary is two times winded around the suction line. Advantageous is that the fluxomizer ace. to the inven¬tion is one single unit being thermally independent from the environment. This is in particular the case since a cylindric mantle not only provides the thermal de-coupling, but also provides the mechanical support and the acoustic insulation, preferably for both, the fluxomizer and the hermetic compressor.<br>
"Restricting the total height of the refrigeration unit ace. to the invention to the socket height of domestic appliances and the compact design and position of the components hermetic compressor, condenser, and fluxomizer is a precondition for its application in differently designed refrigeration appliances. The assembly of the components as well as the refrigeration unit is performed, with the exception of the condenser assembly, independently of the manufacturing of the refrigeration aplliances. The components, and in particular the hermetic compressor, consist of only few components which can be easily assambled. Because of the fluid reservoir contained in the fluxomizer, optimizing the amount of refrigerant in the circuit is unnecessary. Rather it comes to a self-regulating process because the compressor sucks the optimum quantity of refrigerant. Comply with the demand of the friendly environment the oil quantity will be reduced drastically because it is used only for lubrication and not to dissipate heat-losses of the compressor. On the other side for the design of the hermetic-compressor it is not neces¬sary to dissipate heat through the cover of the compressor-case and the noise-level can be minimised by secondary noise-protection measures. The secondary noise-protection<br><br><br>
measures around the hermetic-compressor are simultaneously the elastic fixation of the compressor and the fluxomizer at the cooling-plant..<br>
The process of the refrigeration unit acc. to the invention will be most favourable by using a latent heat-exchanger the generation of high specific refrigeration-capacity and to prevent a indefinable liquid-collection of the compressor. This is realized in such a way that the refrigerant will be overheated up to the ambient-temperature. The overheat will not withdraw from the environment but from the. supercooling of the refrigerant by using the erossilow-heatexchanger. The energetic procedure shows that the compression starts at ambient-temperature and goes in principle isentrop but underadiabate with in¬jection of liquid refrigerant. The losses of the compressor will be minimised and after compression leads to the refrigerant. The suction-gas will be compressed at the piston-displacement and goes acc. to the directcurrent-principle through the pressure-valve which is placed at the piston into the inner volume of the case.With the inflexible fixa¬tion of the pislon-base at the crankshaft the piston-force is equal to the shaft-force in order to prevent abrasion. The shaft-force is less than at traditional machinery. This case will have a lower demand of moments of the driving-motor.The losses by friction be¬tween piston and cylinder are minimum because the circular gasket is extreme gliding and its surface which contacts the inner wall of the cylinder is low for the reason of a small lip.The friction is enough to prevent the axial oszillation of the circular gasket.The function of the circular gasket as pressure-valve will be fulfilled without using a valve-spring. The mass of the circular gasket grants the force of closing the valve.The surface of the gap of the stroke which is realized with the circular gasket as pressure-valve can choosen so big that the flow-losses will be minimum because it is outside the compres-sionvolumes. By the reduction of the oscillating masses in comparison to tradtional ma¬chinery to 1/15 up to 1/35 the expenses of production and the acoustic load at the op¬eration of piston-compressores goes down.. The direct-current compressor avoids com¬plete the max. healing of the suction-gas on the way to the cylinder by realization the suction-valve at the cylinder-head and the pressure-valve at the piston.. The total plane front-surface of the piston grants a minimum clearence space during compression.A spczial pressure-damper to reduce the pressure-pulsation is not necessary with regard to<br>
7<br><br>
the pressure-gas atmosphere at the inner case and the pressure-gas direction.. The pres¬sure-gas flows through the stator-package, the annular passage between stator and rotor, the rotor-bearing and the annular space at the rotor.From there it goes through the hole into the inner volume of the shaft tube and from there to the pressure pipe.. On the way it takes up the heat-loss of the motor.Than the pressure-gas flows through the condenser the cupillary-tube the evaporator and following it will be sucked to the fluxo-mizer.During the entrance of the surge drum of the fiuxomizer the liquid components, like oil or liquid refrigerant will be separated.The gas flows through the inner suction-line of the fiuxomizer takes up the heat from the liquid which goes through the capil¬lary-tube and arrives at the suction-socket of the compressor.During the way through the capillary-tube the liquid will be supercooled.A liquid-moisture of oil/refrigerant comes within the suctionprocess through an injection-tube which ends into the suction-socket.A subadiabalic compression is realized. With additional cooling of the cylinder with liquid refrigerant the adiabatic compression reduces the compressor-losses in such a manner that the liquid refrigerant flows through the straight-line -thermic coupled    with the cylinder or sometimes sucked with an injection-hole into the piston displace¬ment. When the piston comes to the lowest dead-centre the injection-hole is opened and evaporating at the piston displacement.. At the same time a spray-lubrication similar to the 2-stroke- engines but without burning of oil will supply sufficient oil to all bearings. The design of the compressor with eccentric stroke-slice, crank-bearing, crankshaft and in particular inflexible fixed piston with the crankshaft and the position of the piston realizes applicationes with extreme high process-forces and -pressures acc. to the use of carbon dioxide as refrigerant..<br>
In the following, a preferred design example of the refrigeration unit acc. to the inven¬tion is given, where a hermetic compressor acc. to the invention, and a fiuxomizer acc. to the invention are explained in schematic drawings. The drawings show:<br>

The refrigeration unit (Fig 1) acc. to the invention consists of a hermetic compressor 10 with motor 101 and compressor 102, the suction-socket 44(acc.Fig3) and Fluxomizer 40. The Fluxomizer consists of an inner heat-exchanger(suction-damper 43) and surge drum 41. An injection-tube 45 enters in the middle of the suction-socket 44 of the com-<br>
it<br>
pressor 102 and plunges in the liquid-reservoir of the surge drum 41. A suction-pipe 6 goes tangential to the surge drum 41 which is connected with the outlet of the evapora¬tor 3. The evaporator 3 has a latent heat-accumulator for lowering the difference be¬tween the temperature of the surface of the evaporator and the storage-temperature. Heat will be taken when the plant is not in operation. It is also possible to use a fan (not shown) for forced convection. The entrance of refrigerant at the evaporator 3 is con¬nected withithe condenser 2 through a capillary tube 42. The capillary tube 42 has ther¬mal contact with the suction-damper 43. A pressure-pipe 5 ends at the condenser 2 which comes out of the case of the compressor 10 hermetically. The refrigeration unit acc.to the invention is designed as a compact plant. The hermetically compressor 10 , Fluxmizer 40, condenser 2 are mounted on a chassis in such a way that the total height including noise level-protection 100 mm not exceeded. The secondary noise level- pro¬tection has also the function of elastic fixation of the compressor 10 and the Fluxomizer 40 at the chassis.The connection of the suction-pipe 6 with the Fluxomizer 40 is realized free of vibration to prevent vibration of the evaporator 3..<br>
Fig. 2 shows a hermetically compressor 10 as sectional drawing. The case of the com¬pressor 10 consists of a base 11 and cover 12 which are connected hermetically.The complete cylinder group is hermetically connected with the cover 12. A stator- package 14' of the motor 101 with electr. winding 14 is pressed into the cover 12. Between the base 11 and the cover 12 an axle-tube 15 is placed centrical. Preverebly the cover 12 has a pill 12' ( on which the axle-tube 15 is pressed ) and the base 11 has a cylindrical box<br><br><br>
11' advantageously to take up a bearing.(the axle-tube is put in the cylindrical box 11') The axle-tube 15 has at least one radial borehole 16 about half of the length.Close by the cylindrical box 11' of the base 11 the pressure-pipe 5 goes in the inner volume of the axle-tubel5. The pressure-pipe 5 comes out of the base 11 hermetically. At the axle-tube 15 a rotor 18 of the motor 101 is mounted on bearings with a upper bearing-plate 19 and a under bearing-plate 20. The under one is realized advantageously as a sliding bearing 20' which will be taken up from the box 11' at the frontside. The upper bearing 19' which is placed near the pin 12' could be realized as gas- or sliding bearing. The upper bearing-plate 19 of the rotor 18 is a circular washer which is eccentric mounted from the shaft-tube and surrounded from the crank-bearing 21. The piston 23 is inflexi¬ble mounted at the crankshaft 22 which is swivel-mounted connected at the crank-bearing 21. The piston 23 is oscillating at the cylinder-group 13 and through the crank¬shaft 22 transmitted stroke. The piston 23 is shown at the under dead centre. The result of the inflexible connection of the piston 23 with the crankshaft 22 is that the piston 23 has a tilted oszillation against the cylinder-axle. The piston-force will be transmitted direct to the crankshaft. Therefore the piston-force is equal to the shaft-force and there is no resolution of forces in proportionate shaft-force and normal-force. Logical the ad¬vantage is the reduction of abrasion against the traditional kind of construction. The traditional version has a swivel-mounted crankshaft at the piston-pin. The piston 23 has moreover a pressurevalve(Fig4) which exist from a circular gasket 236.This gasket is only a little movable in axial direction. In thi case the direct-current principle of the refrigerantflow  and the spraylubrication of all bearings will be realized. The suction-gas including liquid refigerant- and oil- components flows through a suction-valve(not shown) placed at the cylinderhead after compression tthrough the pressur-valve which is placed at the piston 23 into the inner volume of the case. The gas flows through the an¬nular passage between the stator 14 and rotor 18 and the upper rotorbearing 19'. After that it flows to the annular space 24 the radial borehole 16 into the inner volume of the axle-tube 15 and from there lo the pressure-pipe 5. The forced way of the pressure-gas at the inner case realizes the lubrication of all bearings and taking up of the heat trans¬mission of the motor. The case itself has no function in compensating the heatlosses. Therefore it is possible to compensate the oscillation with an elastical covering outside<br><br><br>
the case.<br><br>

A Fluxomizer 40 is shown at Fig 3. It consists of the cylindrical surge drum 41 t le si]<br><br>
lion-pipe 6 and the Suction -damper 43 wlugh built as an internal heat-exchamer<br>
J 1<br>
.The<br>
internal heat-exchanger 43 has a Special stream-piece(spiral designed) through/ which the suction-gas flows and additional it will be subdued during the way through the surge drum 41.Moreover a doutil&amp;iturnedse(fiPon^/(pressed into the a/m stream-piece) which is the capillary tube 42-connecting the condenser 2 with the evaporator 3 as throttling valve advantageously before the entrance into the Fluxomizer 40and couldbe rolled up the suction-pipe 6.At the lower part of the surge drum 41 a liquid-reservoir 46 is exist¬ing in which a slandpipe touches. This standpipe enters in the middle of the outlet of the Fluxomizer 40 as injectiontube 45. In this outlet also goes hermetically sealed the suc¬tion-socket of the compressor 102. Not shown is an elastic covering of the Fluxomizer 40 which realizes not only the vibration damping of the Fluxomizer 40 at the chassis but also the calorific packing from the environment. This covering is advantageous a unity with the covering of the compressor 10. The Fluxomizer 40 is responsible that the real refrigeration-cycle comes maximum near the theoretical refrigeration cyde.Because of the liqud-reservoir 46 a optimum of the quantity of refrigerant is not necessary since the liquid-reservoir is receiver for refrigerant and depot for lubricant.. Therefore the re¬frigeration unit ace. to the invention is very simple to erect.<br>
At Fig 4 is shown the invention of the piston. The drawing shows the walls of cylinder 237 of a reciprocating compressor 102(acc.Fig 1), In between the walls a invention pis¬ton is oscillating. The movement of the piston are shown as striped arrows. Accordingly the left side of the drawing shows symbolical the piston during the compressionstroke and the right side the piston during the suction-stroke.The cylinder has a cylinder head with suction-valve and which is connected with the suction-line 6 (Fig 1). The piston consists of a conducting-piece 232 which is built bellshaped and inflexible mounted with the crankshaft 22 at the other side of the crank and a pistonbase 233 which is als'6 fix connected with the conducting-piece 232. According the technology it is possible to produce the crankshaft 22 and the conducting-piece 232 as one part.The crankshaft 22 is driven by a crank from the electrical motor.The conducting-piece 232 has an annuldi<br><br><br>
frontside on which the pistonbase 233 is faced mounted. For the reason that the piston docs'nt press at the inner wall of the cylinder 237 the diameter of the pistonbase 233 must be smaller than the diameter of the cylinderborehole while the piston which is in¬flexible connected with the crankshaft 22 acc. to the crank-revolution is oscillating.The diameter of the conducting-piece 232 is also smaller than the diameter of the pistonbase 233. The conducting-piece 232 has at the periphery co-axial and cylindrical in direction of the crankshaft a gliding surface 234 which is faced to the cylinderwall 237.The cy¬lindrical designed gliding surface 234 of the conducting-piece 232 is executed with symmetrical ( same angle) holes 238 over the complete surface.The gliding surface 234 is limited on the one side by the backwall of the pistonbase 233 and on the other side by an annular edge 235 which has the function of a valve guard. The cylindrical part 234 of the conducting-piece 232 has an annular gasket 236 made from Polytetrafluorethylen .This gasket is equipped with one gliding surface 234 and another one at the inner wall of the cylinder 237.The backside of the piston base is flat designed...<br>
In dependence of the direction of the pistonstroke the annular gasket will change its position ace. to the friction at the inner wall of the cylinder 237 than at the gliding sur¬face 234. At the end of the compressionstroke the annular gasket 236 is choked with the valve guard 235 and gives free a stroke gap 239V. This position is shown at the left side of the drawing.The variation of the time of opening is possible through the selection of annular gaskets 236 acc. to the capability of gliding or the quality of the surface of the gliding surface 234. When the stroke gap 239V is open than the comprimised refrigerant can flow from the compressionvolume 2310 through the stroke gap 239V and the holes 238 into the crankvolume 2311. The crankvolume 2311 is connected with the outlet of the pressure gas 5 (acc.Fig. 2) of the compressor through the motorvolume.The right side of the drawing shows the.position of the annular gasket 236 during the suction-stroke of the piston.The annular gasket 236 lies with its complete surface on the back¬side ef the pistonbase 233. By this solution there is no stroke gap 239V and the holes 238 are closed. There is no possibility of flowing the refrigerant into the compression-volume 2310..<br>
The design of the annular gasket 236 with two seal-lips (at cylinder wall 237* and at gliding surface 234) realizes a capability of gliding which grants a maximum of caulking of tllS compression volume 2310 against the crankcase between piston and the inner wall of the cylinder. This function of the annular gasket 236 as pressure VP!VG is granted also with a maximum inclination of the crankshaft against the cylindershaft ?«id<br><br><br>
maximum inclination of the piston.<br>
In contrast to the designs that are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the design of the refrigeration unit acc to the invention after Figs. 5 and 6 consits of the additional cylinder cooling 51. Since the remaining design is identical, we refer to the descriptions Figs. 1 and 2. The additional cylinder cooling of compressor 102 consits of straight-line 51 which is passed by liquid iciVigerant. The liquid refrigerant is drawn from the connection be¬tween condenser 2 and the capillary tube 42 and, after passing of the straight-line 51 fed into the pressure lube 5 between the compressor outlet and the condenser entrance. The branch duct and the connection for return can be placed at a suitable position. Figure 6 shows next to straight-line 51 its connection with the cylinder compression volume 2310 (see Fig. 4) in the form of at least one injection-hole 25. The injectionholes 25 are located at 20 ° crank-angle above the lower dead centre of piston 23. They are uni¬formly distributed over the circumference of the cylinder wall 237 (see Fig. 4). The transition from the inner cylinder wall surface to the bore-hole should be free of burr.<br><br><br>
