				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL USE OF SECRETED<br>
BACTERIAL EFFECTOR PROTEINS<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical use of secreted, injected<br>
bacterial effector proteins. In particular, the present invention relates to<br>
manufacture and use of such proteins and combination and conjugation of the<br>
proteins with carriers.<br>
A number of deficiencies exist in the availability and suitability of neuronal<br>
therapies. At the present time, a large number of neuronal disorders have<br>
inadequate provisions for therapeutic intervention. For example there is<br>
currently no effective treatment for neuronal damage caused by ischemia or<br>
trauma. Other neurodegenerative disorders such as Motor neurone disease,<br>
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and prion disorders such as CJD are<br>
all poorly addressed by current therapies. This reflects in part the complexity<br>
of the nervous system and the difficulties in targeting suitable therapies to the<br>
specific cells affected. Neuronal repair after damage is another disorder for<br>
which there is no effective treatment.<br>
A number of neurological disorders are known that arise from neuronal trauma<br>
that stimulates nerve damage due to internal processes such as apoptosis. It<br>
is known to treat such disorders using a superoxide dismutase in combination<br>
with a components that targets the enzyme to neurons. However, further active<br>
compounds for treatment of neuronal disease are desired.<br>
It is known to use type ill effectors in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
US 5972899 describes a composition comprising Shigella IpaB, an IpaB fusion<br>
protein or a functional derivative or antagonist, or IpaB DNA for delivery to a<br>
eukaryotic cell to induce or to inhibit apoptosis. Site-specific delivery may be<br>
achieved within a targeted immunoliposome. Cell-type specificity is achieved<br>
by the incorporation of a cell-type selective monoclonal antibody into the lipid<br>
bilayer. Disadvantages associated with this delivery method include the very<br>
large size, low stability and poor tissue penetration of immunoliposomes, and<br>
difficulties associated with consistent immunoliposome manufacture for<br>
therapeutic use. There is also the likelihood of a high background effect due<br>
to fusion of immunoliposomes with non-target cell types, caused by the<br>
inherent properties of the liposome membrane.<br>
WO 01/19393 describes Type III effector proteins linked to a protein<br>
transduction domain of the HIV TAT protein. DNA constructs encoding the<br>
effector-transducer fusion protein are targeted to host cells comprising a Type<br>
III secretion system using a tissue-specific viral or plasmid vector. Upon<br>
expression in the transformed host cells, the effector-transducer conjugate is<br>
secreted and undergoes secondary redistribution and uptake by neighbouring<br>
cells.<br>
The HIV TAT transduction domain is not specific to any cell type, hence,<br>
targeting of effector is carried out solely at the DNA level. Disadvantages of<br>
targeting effector DNA (rather than targeting effector protein) include the time<br>
lag for processing of effector DNA to effector protein. Where viral vectors are<br>
used, there are the risks of immunogenic effects and of the vector integrating<br>
into the genome.<br>
WO 00/37493 describes Bordetella pertussis effector virulence genes<br>
associated with a Type III secretion system. The pathogenicity genes or<br>
encoded polypeptides are used in vaccine compositions and may be<br>
conjugated to another molecule or provided with a carrier for delivery.<br>
Pathogenicity polypeptide may be delivered via a vector directing expression<br>
of Bordetella pathogenicity polynucleotide in vivo.<br>
WO 98/56817 describes pharmaceutical compositions comprising a non-<br>
 pathogenic organism expressing the YopJ protein, and YopJ protein combined<br>
with a carrier, for delivery of YopJ to gastrointestinal cells from the gut. The<br>
delivery mechanism disclosed in this document is via the normal bacterial Type<br>
III secretion system - that is, one step from bacterium to target cell.<br>
WO 99/52563 describes targeting of proteins produced by recombinant<br>
Yersinia to the cytosol of eukaryotic cells for diagnostic/ therapeutic purposes.<br>
Fusion proteins with the YopE targeting signal are expressed in Yersinia cells<br>
and delivered directly to eukaryotic cells via the Type III secretion system in the<br>
presence of the SycE chaperone.<br>
US 5965381 describes the in vitro use of recombinant Yersinia to deliver<br>
proteins to eukaryotic cells for immune diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.<br>
The proteins are fused to a delivery sequence, recognised by the Yersinia Type<br>
III secretion system.<br>
It is not advantageous to make use of bacteria for delivering therapeutic<br>
proteins due to the risk of iliciting an unwanted immune response.<br>
The present invention has as an object the provision of new pharmaceutical<br>
compositions for a variety of uses. A further object is to provide new<br>
pharmaceutical compositions for treatment of neuronal cells.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides new therapies based upon a new<br>
class of bacterial-derived proteins, though the scope of the invention is<br>
intended to embrace also fragments and derivatives and modifications thereof<br>
that retain the properties of the native proteins.<br>
A first aspect of the invention thus lies in a pharmaceutical composition,<br>
comprising a bacterial injected effector secreted by the type III or IV secretion<br>
pathway.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition can be used for treatment of a subpopulation<br>
of cells in a patient, especially for a treatment selected from promoting survival<br>
of cells, preventing damage to cells, reversing damage to cells, promoting<br>
growth of cells, inhibiting apoptosis, inhibiting release of an inflammatory<br>
mediator from cells and promoting division of cells, or for a treatment selected<br>
from inhibiting survival of cells, inhibiting growth of cells, inhibiting division of<br>
cells, promoting apoptosis, killing cells, promoting release of an inflammatory<br>
mediator from cells and regulating nitric oxide release from cells.<br>
A carrier can be provided to target the effector protein to a target cell, optionally<br>
targeting the effector to a cell selected from an epithelial cell a neuronal cell,<br>
a secretory cell, an immunological cell, an endocrine cell, an inflammatory cell,<br>
an exocrine cell, a bone cell and a cell of the cardiovascular system.<br>
Another means of delivery of the effector is via a conjugate of the effector,<br>
protein and the carrier, the two suitably linked by a linker. One particularly<br>
preferred linker is cleavable, in that it can be cleaved after entry into the target<br>
cell so as to release the effector from the carrier. This linker can be a di-<br>
sulphide bridge or a peptide sequence including a site for a protease found in<br>
the target cell. In another embodiment of the invention, the linker is composed<br>
of two cooperating proteins, a first cooperating protein associated with the<br>
effector and the second associated with the cell targetting component. These<br>
respective parts can be administered separately and combine in vivo to link the<br>
effector to the cell targetting component. An example of such a two-part linker<br>
is botulinum toxin C21 in cooperation with C22.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, described in more detail below, a<br>
composition comprises a neuronal cell targeting component, linked by a<br>
cleavable linker to the effector protein. Preferably, the neuronal cell targeting<br>
component comprises a first domain targeting the effector to a neuronal cell<br>
and a second domain that translocates the effector into the cytosol of the<br>
neuronal cell.<br>
Preparation of the compositions of the invention can be by combining a type<br>
III effector protein with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In such<br>
compositions, the effector protein may be on its own or may be chemically<br>
linked with a (targetting) carrier. Another preparation method is to express a<br>
DNA that encodes a polypeptide having a first region that corresponds to the<br>
effector protein and a second region that codes for the carrier. A third region,<br>
between the first and second regions, which is cleaved by a proteolytic enzyme<br>
present in the target cell is optionally included.<br>
A specific composition of the invention, for delivery of a bacterial type III<br>
effector protein to neuronal cells, comprises:-<br>
the effector protein; linked by a cleavable linker to<br>
a neuronal cell targeting component, comprising a first domain that binds<br>
to a neuronal cell and a second domain that translocates the effector protein<br>
of the composition into the neuronal cell. It is preferred that the first domain is<br>
selected from (a) neuronal cell binding domains of clostridial toxins; and (b)<br>
fragments, variants and derivatives of the domains in (a) that substantially<br>
retain the neuronal cell binding activity of the domains of (a).<br>
It is further preferred that the second domain is selected from (a) domains of<br>
clostridial neurotoxins that translocate polypeptide sequences into cells, and<br>
(b) fragments, variants and derivatives of the domains of (a) that substantially<br>
retain the translocating activity of the domains of (a).<br>
In use of a composition of the invention for treatment of a neuronal condition,<br>
the linker is cleaved in the neuronal cell so as to release the effector protein<br>
from the targeting component, thus enabling the effector to have effect in the<br>
cell without being hindered by attachment to the targeting component.<br>
Hence, also, the invention provides a method of delivering a bacterial type III<br>
effector protein to a neuronal cell comprising administering a composition of<br>
the invention.<br>
The first domain may suitably be selected from (a) neuronal cell binding<br>
domains of clostridial toxins; and (b) fragments, variants and derivatives of the<br>
domains in (a) that substantially retain the neuronal cell binding activity of the<br>
domains of (a). The second domain is suitably selected from (a) domains of<br>
clostridial neurotoxins that translocate polypeptide sequences into cells, and<br>
(b) fragments, variants and derivatives of the domains of (a) that substantially<br>
retain the translocating activity of the domains of (a). The second domain is<br>
further suitably selected from:-<br>
(a) a translocation domain that is not a HN domain of a clostridial toxin<br>
and is not a fragment or derivative of a HN domain of a clostridial toxin;<br>
(b) a non-aggregating translocation domain as measured by size in<br>
physiological buffers;<br>
(c) a HN domain of a diphtheria toxin,<br>
(d) a fragment or derivative of (c) that substantially retains the<br>
translocating activity of the HN domain of a diphtheria toxin,<br>
(e) a fusogenic peptide,<br>
(f) a membrane disrupting peptide, and<br>
(g) translocating fragments and derivatives of (e) and (f).<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a construct comprises effector protein linked<br>
by a disulphide bridge to a neuronal cell targeting component comprising a first<br>
domain that binds to a neuronal cell and a second domain that translocates the<br>
effector protein into the neuronal cell. This construct is made recombinantly as<br>
a single polypeptide having a cysteine residue on the effector protein which<br>
forms a disulphide bridge with a cysteine residue on the second domain. The<br>
effector protein is covalently linked, initially, to the second domain. Following<br>
expression of this single polypeptide, effector protein is cleaved from the<br>
second domain leaving the effector protein linked only by the disulphide bridge<br>
to the rest of the construct.<br>
Particular aspects of the invention reside in further choices for the binding and<br>
translocation domains, and one such aspect provides a non-toxic polypeptide,<br>
for delivery of the effector protein to a neuronal cell, comprising:-<br>
a binding domain that binds to the neuronal cell, and<br>
a translocation domain that translocates the effector protein into the<br>
neuronal cell,<br>
wherein the translocation domain is not a HN domain of a clostridial neurotoxin<br>
and is not a fragment or derivative of a HN domain of a clostridial toxin.<br>
The binding domain is suitably comprised of or derived from clostridial heavy<br>
chain fragments or modified clostridial heavy chain fragments. As used herein,<br>
the term "modified clostridial heavy chain fragment" means a polypeptide<br>
fragment that retains similar biological functions to the corresponding heavy<br>
chain of a botufinum. or tetanus neurotoxin but differs in its amino acid<br>
sequence and other properties compared to the corresponding heavy chain.<br>
The invention more specifically provides such constructs that are based on<br>
fragments derived from botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention also provides a polypeptide, for delivery of a<br>
effector protein to a neuronal cell, comprising:-<br>
a binding domain that binds to the neuronal cell, and<br>
a translocation domain that translocates the effector protein into the<br>
neuronal cell,<br>
wherein the resulting construct is non-aggregating.<br>
Whether the construct is an aggregating one is usually apparent from a lack of<br>
solubility of the construct, and this may be seen upon simple visual inspection<br>
of the construct in aqueous media: non-aggregating domains result in<br>
constructs of the invention that are partially or preferably totally soluble<br>
whereas aggregating domains result in non-soluble aggregates of polypeptides<br>
having apparent sizes of many tens or even hundreds the size of a single<br>
polypeptide. Generally, the construct should be non-aggregating as measured<br>
by its size on gel electrophoresis, and domain sizes or apparent domain sizes<br>
thus measured should preferably be less than 1.0 x 106 daltons, more<br>
preferably less than 3.0 x 105 daltons, with the measuring being suitably carried<br>
out on native PAGE using physiological conditions.<br>
A still further aspect of the invention provides a polypeptide, for delivery of a<br>
effector protein to a neuronal cell, comprising:-<br>
a binding domain that binds to the neuronal cell, and<br>
a translocation domain that translocates the effector protein into the<br>
neuronal cell,<br>
wherein the translocation domain is selected from (1) a HN domain of a<br>
diphtheria toxin, (2) a fragment or derivative of (1) that substantially retains the<br>
translocating activity of the HN domain of a diphtheria toxin, (3) a fusogenic<br>
peptide, (4) a membrane disrupting peptide, (5) a HN from botulinum toxin C2<br>
and (6) translocating fragments and derivatives of (3), (4) and (5).<br>
It is to be noted that botulinum toxin C2 is not a neurotoxin as it has no neuronal<br>
specificity, instead it is an enterotoxin and suitable for use in the invention to<br>
provide a non-aggregating translocation domain.<br>
A yet further aspect of the invention provides a polypeptide, for delivery of a<br>
effector protein to a neuronal cell, comprising:-<br>
a binding domain that binds to the neuronal cell, and<br>
a translocation domain that translocates the effector protein into the<br>
neuronal cell,<br>
wherein the polypeptide has reduced affinity to neutralising antibodies to<br>
tetanus toxin compared with the affinity to such antibodies of native tetanus<br>
toxin heavy chain.<br>
The above aspects may singly or in any combination be exhibited by<br>
polypeptides of the invention and thus a typical preferred polypeptide of the<br>
invention (i) lacks the neurotoxic activities of botulinum and tetanus toxins, (ii)<br>
displays high affinity to neuronal cells corresponding to the affinity of a<br>
clostridial neurotoxin for those cells, (iii) contains a domain which can effect<br>
translocation across cell membranes, and (iv) occurs in a less aggregated state<br>
than the corresponding heavy chain from botulinum or tetanus toxin in<br>
physiological buffers.<br>
A significant advantage of the polypeptides of particular aspects of the<br>
invention is their non-aggregated state, thus rendering them more usable as<br>
soluble polypeptides. The polypeptides according to the invention generally<br>
include sequences from the Hc domains of the botulinum and tetanus<br>
neurotoxins and these are combined with functional domains from other<br>
proteins, such that the essential functions of the native heavy chains are<br>
retained. Thus, for example, the Hc domain of botulinum type F neurotoxin is<br>
fused to the translocation domain derived from diphtheria toxin to give modified<br>
clostridial heavy chain fragment. Surprisingly, such polypeptides are more<br>
useful as constructs for delivering substances to neuronal cells than are the<br>
native clostridial heavy chains.<br>
The current invention provides constructs containing type III secreted effector<br>
proteins and optionally other functional domains that effect the specific delivery<br>
of the type III effector moiety to neuronal cells These constructs have a variety<br>
of clinical uses for the treatment of neuronal diseases.<br>
The type III secretion mechanism of Gram negative bacterial pathogens is a<br>
complex system used to deliver proteins to eukaryotic cells. The secretion<br>
mechanism utilises at least 10-15 essential proteins to form an injection needle<br>
that extends from the surface of the bacteria and penetrates into the host cell.<br>
The effector proteins are then trafficked across the bacterial and host<br>
membranes through the lumen of the needle and injected directly into the cell<br>
cytosol. This process involves a still undefined secretion signal and involves<br>
specific chaperone proteins that deliver the effector to the secretion machinery.<br>
The system delivers a wide range of protein effectors capable of modulating<br>
host cell function in such a way as to allow the persistence or spread of the<br>
pathoge in the host. These effectors modulate a number of signalling<br>
pathways and one pathogen may export several effectors that regulate different<br>
pathways either concurrently or during different phases of its life cycle. Type<br>
III secretion systems have been described in a wide range of pathogenic<br>
bacteria including but not restricted to :<br>
Mammalian pathogens; Yersinia species (including pestis, pseudotuberculosis,<br>
enterocolitica), Salmonella species (including typhimurium, enterica, dublin,<br>
typhi ) Escherichia coli, Shigella species (e.g flexneri), Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa, Chlamydia species (e.g.pneumoniae, trachomatis), and Bordetella<br>
species, and Burkholderia species<br>
Plant pathogens; Pseudomonas syringae, Erwinia species, Xanthomonas<br>
species, Ralstonia solanacearum, and Rhizobium species<br>
Insect pathogens; Sodalis glossinidius, Edwardsiella ictaluri, and Plesiomonas<br>
species<br>
Effector proteins from any of these species, whether mammalian pathogens or<br>
not, have therapeutic potential for treating human or animal disease.<br>
Table 1 lists a number of type III effectors that have been identified to date.<br>
The type IV secretion system shows a remarkable degree of similarity to the<br>
type III system in that it forms a needle-like structure through which effector<br>
proteins are injected into the host cell cytoplasm. However, the proteins<br>
involved in the structure of the needle are different for the two systems and the<br>
effectors are also divergent. The effectors function to modulate cellular<br>
signalling to establish and maintain the intracellular niche and/or promote<br>
invasion and proliferation. The system is described as essential in a number<br>
of important bacterial pathogens including Legionella pneumophila, Bordetella<br>
pertussis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bartonella henselae,<br>
Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Coxiella burnetii, Brucella abortus,<br>
Neisseria species and Rickettsia species (e.g. prowazekii). Similar type IV<br>
secretion systems exist in plant or invertebrate pathogens and are also a<br>
source of therapeutic agents. A number of described type IV effectors are also<br>
listed in table 1 with proposed functions.<br>
The function of a variety of type III effectors has been described in recent<br>
years. Interestingly a number of effectors from different organisms have<br>
evolved to target particular signalling pathways suggesting some similarities in<br>
the mechanism of pathogenicity. The precise specificity of particular effectors<br>
may vary according to pathogen and cell type and this range of activities make<br>
them attractive candidates for therapeutic applications. Examples of some of<br>
the families of effectors useful in the present invention are described below:<br>
GTPase activating proteins. YopE from Yersiniapseudotuberculosis, SptP from<br>
Salmonella typhimuhum and ExoS and ExoT from Pseudomonas aeruginosa<br>
are all GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) for Rho family GTPases and are<br>
characterised by a conserved "arginine finger" domain (Black and Bliska,<br>
(2000) Molecular Microbiology 37:515-527; Fu and Galan (1999) Nature<br>
401:293-297; Goehring et al (1999) Journal of Biological Chemistry 274:36369-<br>
36372). By increasing the hydrolysis of bound GTP they promote the formation<br>
of the inactive GDP-bound of the GTPase. This acts to down-regulate the<br>
function of a range of GTPases in cells. YopE is a 23kDa effector which is<br>
translocated into the cytosol of cells during infection by Y.pseudotuberculosis<br>
and other strains. Studies in vitro have shown that it acts as a GAP for RhoA,<br>
Cdc42 and Rac1, but not for Ras (Black and Bliska, (2000) Molecular<br>
Microbiology 37:515-527). A point mutation within the arginine finger motif<br>
causes a loss of GAP activity and this correlates directly with its biological<br>
activity in cells. In in vivo studies carried out using a cell model that mimics the<br>
normal site of Yersinia infection YopE appears to have a greater specificity for<br>
Cdc42 (Andor et al (2001) Cellular Microbiology 3:301 -310). The GAP activity<br>
of SptP shows greater specificity for Cdc42 and Rad compared to RhoA. The<br>
GAP activity of particular proteins is likely to vary for different cell types and<br>
delivery routes. SptP, ExoS and ExoT are bifunctional enzymes with additional<br>
enzymatic domains (SptP, tyrosine phosphatase; ExoS, ExoT, ADP-<br>
ribosyltransferase). In the case of ExoS this activity blocks the activation of Ras<br>
GTPase allowing a co-ordinated modulation of different signalling pathways<br>
(Henriksson et al (2000) Biochemical Journal 347:217-222).<br>
Guanine nucleotide exchange factor. SopE and SopE2 from Salmonella<br>
typhimurium and related proteins act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors<br>
(GEFs) for a range of GTPases (Hardt et al (1998) Cell 93:815). GEFs function<br>
by enhancing the rate of replacement of bound GDP by GTP causing the<br>
activation of the GTPase. This effectively upregulates the activity of specific<br>
GTPases in the cell. Native SopE is a 240 amino acid protein which is injected<br>
into the host cell cytosol by S.typhimurium. The N-terminal 77 amino acids of<br>
the protein act as a secretion signal and are dispensable for the biological<br>
activity of the protein (Hardt et al (1998) Cell 93:815). In in vitro studies SopE<br>
acts as a GEF for CDc42, Rac1, Rac2, RhoA, and RhoG. Cellular GEFs show<br>
a high degree of specificity for particular GTPases and it is likely that SopE will<br>
show greater specificity in vivo. This specificity is likely to vary according to cell<br>
type and delivery route. The type IV effector, RalF, from Legionella<br>
pneumophila is a further exchange factor affecting the function of small<br>
GTPases. In this case the target is the ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) family and<br>
this is the first example of a bacterial effector that targets this family (Nagai et<br>
al (2002) Science 295;679-682).<br>
Covalent modification of GTPase. The type III effector YopT from Y.pestis and<br>
certain other Yersinia strains has similar effects in vivo to YopE (Iriarte and<br>
Cornelis (1998) Molecular Microbiology 29:915-929). In HeLa cells YopT<br>
causes a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of RhoA but not Cdc-42 or Rac<br>
(Zumbihl et al (1999) Journal of Biological Chemistry 274:29289-29293). It is<br>
still not known whether this represents a direct modification of RhoA by YopT<br>
or whether other cellular factors are involved. The specificity of YopT for RhoA<br>
offers significant therapeutic possibilities.<br>
Regulation of cell signalling via protein kinase and phosphatase. YopO/YpkA<br>
from Yersinia spp are protein kinase related to eukaryotic serine/threonine<br>
kinases (Galyov et a/(1993) Nature 361:730-732). YopO/YpkA causes a similar<br>
cell rounding to that observed for other effectors such as YopE suggesting a<br>
role in modulating GTPase function. The small GTPases RhoA and Racl have<br>
been shown to bind to YopO and YpkA suggesting that these are the<br>
intracellular targets for the kinase (Barz C et al (2000) FEBS Letters 482:139-<br>
143). The type IV effector CagA from Helicobacter pylori also affects the<br>
cytoskeleton of infected cells and its activity is dependent on its<br>
phosphorylation by intracellular kinases. CagA functions via the SHP-2 tyrosine<br>
phosphatase to modulate downstream signalling.<br>
Inositol phosphatases. SigD from Salmonella typhimurium, SopB from S.dublin<br>
and IpgD from Shigella flexneri are all putative inositol phosphatases. In<br>
intestinal cells SopB causes an accumulation of inositol 1,4,5,6,<br>
tetrakisphosphate. Mutations in active site of SopB abolishes both its<br>
phopshatase activity and the accumulation of inositol tetrakisphosphate (Norris<br>
et al (1998) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science U. S.A 95:14057-<br>
14059). SopB appears to hydrolyse a wide range of inositol and<br>
phosphatidylinositol phosphates in vitro although its precise intracellular target<br>
remains to be defined (Eckmann et al (1997) Proceedings of the National<br>
Academy of Science U.S.A 94:14456-14460). SigD appears to have a different<br>
specificity in vivo as it does not lead to an increase in the levels of inositol<br>
1,4,5,6, tetrakisphosphate (Eckmann et al (1997)). Although again the precise<br>
intracellular target has not been defined, SigD has been shown to lead to the<br>
activation of Akt /Protein kinase B in epithelial cells (Steele-Mortimer (2000)<br>
Journal of Biological Chemistry 275:37718-37724). The activity has been<br>
shown to be dependent on the presence of a synaptojanin-homologous region<br>
close to the C-terminus of the protein (Marcus et al (2001) FEBS letters<br>
494:201-207). The homologous protein IpgD also stimulates the activation of<br>
Akt in these cells (Marcus et al (2001)). The potential to activate Akt offers a<br>
number of therapeutic opportunities as it is a key regulator of cellular survival<br>
(reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck and Alessi (2000) Biochemical Journal 346:561-<br>
576).<br>
Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. YopJ from Yersinia pestis<br>
is another translocated effector with a wide range of homologs including AvrA<br>
from Salmonella spp. and a variety of effectors from plant pathogens. YopJ has<br>
been shown to inactivate a broad range of mitogen-activated protein kinase<br>
kinases (MKKs) (Orth et al (1999) Science 285:1920-1923) causing apoptosis<br>
in macrophages. YopJ is suggested to act as a ubiquitin-like protein protease<br>
causing increased turnover of signalling molecules via removal of a Sumo-1 tag<br>
from the MKK (Orth et al (2000) Science 290:1594-1597). Interestingly in cell<br>
models of cytokine production and macrophage killing AvrA shows no activity<br>
despite its homology to YopJ suggesting that the specificity of the proteins may<br>
be different (Schesser K et al (2000) Microbial Pathogenesis 28:59-70). In<br>
neuronal cells these different specificities may offer potential therapeutic<br>
applications for modulating MKKs involved in apoptosis or inflammatory<br>
responses.<br>
Modulators of cellular trafficking. SpiC from Salmonella enterica inhibits the<br>
fusion of endosomal vesicles to prevent the exposure of Salmonella to<br>
lyosomal degradation (Uchiya et al (1999) EMBO Journal 18:3924-3933). The<br>
ability to modulate intracellular trafficking pathways offers a number of<br>
therapeutic opportunities for modulating cycling of receptors or release of<br>
material from membrane bound vesicles.<br>
A number of additional effector proteins are implicated in regulating and<br>
maintaining the intracellular compartments occupied by bacterial pathogens.<br>
Salmonella, in common with many other pathogens, establishes a specialised<br>
intracellular compartments. Salmonella has a dedicated type III secretion<br>
system that secretes proteins into the host cell cytosol from within this<br>
compartment and the effectors secreted by this system (including SpiC,<br>
SopE/E2, SseE.F.G.J, PipA.B, SifA,B)maintain the integrity of this<br>
compartment. A recent paper described the synergistic effects of SseJ and<br>
SifA in regulating processes from the vacuolar membrane (Ruiz-Albert et al<br>
(2002) Molecular microbiology 44;p645-661). These proteins and their<br>
counterparts from other intracellular pathogens have significant potential for<br>
treating disorders affecting intracellular trafficking pathways. RalF and a<br>
number of the other effectors described previously may also have significant<br>
therapeutic potential for such disorders.<br>
The botulinum neurotoxins are a family of seven structurally similar, yet<br>
antigenically different, protein toxins whose primary site of action is the<br>
neuromuscular junction where they block the release of the transmitter<br>
acetylcholine. The action of these toxins on the peripheral nervous system of<br>
man and animals results in the syndrome botulism, which is characterised by<br>
widespread flaccid muscular paralysis (Shone (1986) in 'Natural Toxicants in<br>
Foods', Editor D. Watson, Ellis Harwood, UK). Each of the botulinum<br>
neurotoxins consist of two disulphide-linked subunits; a 100 kDa heavy subunit<br>
which plays a role in the initial binding and internalisation of the neurotoxin into<br>
the nerve ending (Dolly et. al. (1984) Nature, 307,457-460) and a 50 kDa light<br>
subunit which acts intracellularly to block the exocytosis process (Mclnnes and<br>
Dolly (1990) Febs Lett., 261, 323-326; de Paiva and Dolly (1990) Febs Lett.,<br>
277, 171-174). Thus it is the heavy chains of the botulinum neurotoxins that<br>
impart their remarkable neuronal specificity.<br>
Tetanus toxin is structurally very similar to botulinum neurotoxins but its primary<br>
site of action is the central nervous system where it blocks the release of<br>
inhibitory neurotransmitters from central synapses (Renshaw cells). As<br>
described for the botulinum toxins above, it is domains within the heavy chain<br>
of tetanus toxin that bind to receptors on neuronal cells.<br>
The binding and internalisation (translocation) functions of the clostridial<br>
neurotoxin (tetanus and botulinum) heavy chains can be assigned to at least<br>
two domains within their structures. The initial binding step is energy-<br>
independent and appears to be mediated by one or more domains within the<br>
Hc fragment of the neurotoxin (C-terminal fragment of approximately 50kDa)<br>
(Shone et al. (1985), Eur. J. Biochem., 151,75-82) while the translocation step<br>
is energy-dependent and appears to be mediated by one or more domains<br>
within the HN fragment of the neurotoxin (N-terminal fragment of approximately<br>
50kDa).<br>
Isolated heavy chains are non-toxic compared to the native neurotoxins and yet<br>
retain the high affinity binding for neuronal cells. Tetanus and the botulinum<br>
neurotoxins from most of the seven serotypes, together with their derived<br>
heavy chains, have been shown to bind a wide variety of neuronal cell types<br>
with high affinities in the nM range (e.g botulinum type B neurotoxin; Evans et<br>
al. (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 154, 409-416). Another key characteristic of the<br>
binding of the tetanus and botulinum heavy chains to neuronal cells is that the<br>
receptor ligand recognised by the various toxin serotypes differ. Thus for<br>
example, botulinum type A heavy chain binds to a different receptor to<br>
botulinum type F heavy chain and these two ligands are non-competitive with<br>
respect to their binding to neuronal cells (Wadsworth et al. (1990), Biochem J.<br>
268, 123-128). Of the clostridial neurotoxin serotypes so far characterised<br>
(tetanus, botulinum A, B, C,, D, E and F), all appear to recognise distinct<br>
receptor populations on neuronal cells. Collectively, the clostridial.neurotoxin<br>
heavy chains provide high affinity binding ligands that recognise a whole family<br>
of receptors that are specific to neuronal cells.<br>
The present invention also provides constructs for the delivery of type III<br>
effector proteins specifically to neuronal cells. The mechanism by which the<br>
type III effector protein is delivered to the cell by these constructs is completely<br>
different to that used by the host bacteria. Instead of being injected directly into<br>
the cellular cytosol, specific constructs of the invention deliver the type III<br>
effector protein to cells via a number of sequentially acting biologically active<br>
domains and by a process resembling receptor-mediated endocytosis.<br>
Surprisingly, when delivered by this completely different mechanism, the type<br>
III effector proteins are biologically active within the cellular cytosol.<br>
Particular constructs of the invention comprise three functional domains<br>
defined by their biological activities. These are:<br>
the type III effector moiety (for examples see Tablei);<br>
a targeting domain that binds the construct to receptors and that<br>
provides a high degree of specificity to neuronal cells; and<br>
a translocation domain that after internalisation of the construct, effects<br>
the translocation of the type III effector moiety through the endosomal<br>
membrane into the cell cytosol.<br>
The type III effector-containing construct may also contain 'linker proteins' by<br>
which these domains are interconnected. In one embodiment of the invention<br>
the type III effector moiety is linked to the translocation domain via a disulphide<br>
bridge.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the targeting domain is derived<br>
from a clostridial neurotoxin binding fragment (Hc domain). This may be derived<br>
from tetanus toxin or any one of the eight botulinum toxin serotypes (A-G).<br>
Delivery via the clostridial neurotoxin receptors differs significantly to the normal<br>
delivery route of the type III effectors and offers a number of advantages:<br>
The clostridial Hc fragments bind with high affinity to receptors on the cell<br>
surface and provide high specificity to neuronal cells. The clostridial<br>
neurotoxins are internalised via an acidic endosome which triggers the<br>
translocation of the type III effector moiety across the membrane and into the<br>
cytosol.<br>
For non-neuronal cells a wide range of high affinity binding domains have been<br>
defined for specific cell types. Examples are described for a number of cellular<br>
targets.<br>
The agent can comprise a ligand or targeting domain, which binds to an<br>
endocrine cell and is thus rendered specific for these cell types. Examples of<br>
suitable ligands include iodine; thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH); TSH<br>
receptor antibodies; antibodies to the islet-specific monosialo-ganglioside GM2-<br>
1; insulin, insulin-like growth factor and antibodies to the receptors of both; TSH<br>
releasing hormone (protirelin) and antibodies to its receptor; FSH/LH releasing<br>
hormone (gonadorelin) and antibodies to its receptor; corticotrophin releasing<br>
hormone (CRH) and antibodies to its receptor; and ACTH and antibodies to its<br>
receptor.<br>
Ligands suitable to target an agent to inflammatory cells include (i) for mast<br>
cells, complement receptors in general, including C4 domain of the Fc IgE, and<br>
antibodies/ligands to the C3a/C4a-R complement receptor; (ii) foreosinophils,<br>
antibodies/ligands to the C3a/C4a-R complement receptor, anti VLA-4<br>
monoclonal antibody, anti-IL5 receptor, antigens or antibodies reactive toward<br>
CR4 complement receptor; (iii) for macrophages and monocytes, macrophage<br>
stimulating factor, (iv) for macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils, bacterial<br>
LPS and yeast B-glucans which bind to CR3, (v) for neutrophils, antibody to<br>
0X42, an antigen associated with the iC3b complement receptor, or IL8; (vi)<br>
for fibroblasts, mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-beta (M6P/ IGF-<br>
II) receptorand PA2.26, antibody to a cell-surface receptor for active fibroblasts<br>
in mice.<br>
Ligands suitable to target an agent to exocrine cells include pituitary adenyl<br>
cyclase activating peptide (PACAP-38) or an antibody to its receptor.<br>
Ligands suitable to target an agent to immunological cells include Epstein Barr<br>
virus fragment/surface feature or idiotypic antibody (binds to CR2 receptor on<br>
B-lymphocytes and lymph node follicular dendritic cells).<br>
Suitable ligands for targeting platelets for the treatment of disease states<br>
involving inappropriate platelet activation and thrombus formation include<br>
thrombin and TRAP (thrombin receptor agonist peptide) or antibodies to<br>
CD31/PECAM-1, CD24 or CD106/VCAM-1, and ligands for targeting<br>
cardiovascular endothelial cells for the treatment of hypertension include GP1 b<br>
surface antigen recognising antibodies.<br>
Suitable ligands for targeting osteoblasts for the treatment of a disease<br>
selected from osteopetrosis and osteoporosis include calcitonin, and for<br>
targeting an agent to osteoclasts include osteoclast differentiation factors (eg.<br>
TRANCE, or RANKL or OPGL), and an antibody to the receptor RANK.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the translocation domain is derived from<br>
a bacterial toxin. Examples of suitable translocation domains are those derived<br>
from the clostridial neurotoxins or diphtheria toxin.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the translocation domain is a<br>
membrane disrupting or 'fusogenic' peptide, which functions as a translocation<br>
domain. An example of such a peptide is that derived from influenza virus<br>
haemagglutinin HA2 (residues 1-23).<br>
In one example of the construct of the invention, the type III effector protein is<br>
SigD from Salmonella spp. In another example of the construct of the<br>
invention, the type III effector protein is YopE from Yersinia spp.<br>
In an example of the construct of the invention in which the type III effector<br>
moiety is SigD from Salmonella spp, the construct may consist of the following:-<br>
the SigD type III effector moiety;<br>
the translocation domain from diphtheria toxin;<br>
the binding domain (Hc domain) from botulinum type A neurotoxin; and<br>
a linker peptide to enable attachment of the SigD effector to the<br>
translocation domain via a disulphide bridge.<br>
In an another example of the construct of the invention in which the type III<br>
effector moiety is SigD from Salmonella spp, the construct consists of the<br>
following:-<br>
the SigD type III effector moiety;<br>
the translocation domain in the form of a fusogenic peptide;<br>
the binding domain (Hc domain) from botulinum type F neurotoxin; and<br>
a linker peptide to enable attachment of the SigD effector to the<br>
translocation domain via a disulphide bridge.<br>
In an example of the construct of the invention in which the type III effector<br>
moiety is YopE from Yersinia spp, the construct may consist of the following:-<br>
the YopE type III effector moiety;<br>
the translocation domain from diphtheria toxin;<br>
the binding domain (Hc domain) from botulinum type F neurotoxin; and<br>
a linker peptide to enable attachment of the YopE effector to the<br>
translocation domain via a disulphide bridge.<br>
The invention enables manipulation of cell signalling, and in a specific example<br>
SigD is incorporated into a construct of the invention and can be used to<br>
promote neuronal cell survival under stress. By targeting the appropriate<br>
intracellular signalling pathway, it is possible to simultaneously regulate a<br>
number of pathways to improve the prospects for neuronal survival. SigD (also<br>
known as SopB) activates the protein kinase Akt, which is a key intermediate<br>
in the pro-survival signalling pathways mediated by various growth factors.<br>
Not only does Akt up-regulate pro-survival transcription factors such as NF-kB,<br>
but it also down-regulates several pro-apoptotic factors such as Bad and<br>
Forkhead.<br>
A number of type III and IV effectors function to maintain the intracellular niche<br>
of the bacteria within the host cell. Whilst some bacterial pathogens are<br>
released into the cell cytosol, many form and maintain a specialised<br>
intracellular compartment sometimes termed a vacuole. One of the principle<br>
functions of many effector protein is to regulate the fusion of the compartment<br>
with other intracellular compartments such as potentially damaging<br>
phagolysosomal. At the same time the pathogen may need to promote fusion<br>
with other membrane bound compartments, including recycling endosomes, to<br>
either provide nutrients to the encapsulated pathogen or allow the<br>
dissemination of the pathogen to other locations. Intracellular pathogens offer<br>
a wide range of effector molecules for regulating intracellular trafficking and<br>
membrane fusion.<br>
The mechanism underlying the fusion of membrane bound vesicles is<br>
conserved in a number of cellular processes. Broadly speaking, membrane<br>
fusion events are classified either as secretory processes for the release of<br>
material from the plasma membrane, or as endocytic processes that move<br>
material from the plasma membrane to the lysosomal system. This simplified<br>
classification does not take into account retrograde and anterograde<br>
processes, which occur within these pathways, or multiple points of<br>
communication between the two pathways. The underlying mechanism in all<br>
membrane fusion events can be broken down into 4 component phases:<br>
The transported material is concentrated at a specific site on the donor<br>
membrane and is "pinched off in a vesicle that becomes separated from this<br>
membrane.<br>
The vesicle is transported to the acceptor membrane along cytoskeletal fibres<br>
(e.g. microtubules).<br>
The vesicle then attaches to the acceptor membrane via a "docking/tethering"<br>
mechanism mediated by SNARE complex proteins.<br>
The vesicle and the acceptor membrane fuse to release the contents of the<br>
vesicle through the acceptor membrane.<br>
Thus similar SNARE proteins and regulatory proteins underpin the fusion of<br>
endosomal vesicles with the lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum with the Golgi<br>
and trans-Golgi network, and secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane.<br>
The functional conservation of the membrane fusion mechanism means that<br>
a bacterial effector protein that would normally regulate the fusion of a specific<br>
event can be directed to modulate other fusion events. For example, an<br>
effector that blocks endosomal fusion with the lysosome can be redirected to<br>
block the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, or ER<br>
vesicles with the Golgi network.<br>
One of the key classes of regulatory proteins that have been defined in vesicle<br>
trafficking are small GTPases of the Ras superfamily termed Rab proteins (or<br>
Ypt proteins in yeast). Rabproteins are implicated in every stage of memb' *ne<br>
fusion. For example Rab 1,2,5 and 9 are involved in sorting material for<br>
transport (stage 1 above), Rab5,6,27 and Sec4 mediate transport (stage 2),<br>
Rab1,5, Ypt1,7 Sec4 influence docking to the acceptor membrane (stage 3)<br>
and other Rab proteins implicated in promoting membrane fusion. The list<br>
above shows that certain Rab proteins, such as Rab1 and Rab5, are involved<br>
in more than 1 stage of the fusion process. Similarly some Rab proteins are<br>
present on all membrane vesicles whilst others have more specialised roles in<br>
specific fusion events.<br>
Rab proteins are key potential targets for modification by either bacterial<br>
pathogens intent on blocking or promoting membrane fusion events or by<br>
therapeutic agents designed to regulate intracellular trafficking. One of the first<br>
effector proteins to be described as having an effect on Rab function was the<br>
secreted effector protein SopE2 from Salmonella species. SopE2 acts as a<br>
guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5a resulting in increased activation<br>
of the protein on the cell membrane. This activity has been correlated with<br>
increased survival of Salmonella in infected HeLa cells and macrophages (Cell<br>
Micobiol. 3 p473). SpiC is another Salmonella effector that blocks endosome<br>
fusion (EMBO J. 18p3924-3933). Unlike SopE, which shows some<br>
conservation with normal cellular regulators of GTPase, SpiC shows no clear<br>
homology to other proteins. Its ability to block one of the four stages of vesicle<br>
fusion is known. It could exert its activity at the level of the SNARE proteins,<br>
modulate Rab function directly or operate at the level of one of the regulators<br>
of Rab function. Membrane insertion is essential for Rab activity. Rab proteins<br>
form a stable complex with Rab escort protein (REP) in the cytosol and this is<br>
a substrate for a geranyl geranyl transferase (RabGGT) which adds a C-<br>
terminal isoprenoid moiety. In the absence of REP or RabGGT the Rab protein<br>
would remain in an inactive form in the cytosol. REP also mediates the<br>
membrane insertion of the modified Rab into the donor membrane. Rab<br>
proteins can also be retrieved from the membrane via the action of Rab GDP<br>
dissociation inhibitor (RabGDI). All of these proteins are potential targets for<br>
bacterial pathogens to alter membrane fusion events. The precise effect would<br>
depend on whether alterations cause an increase or decrease in the levels of<br>
active Rab in the donor membrane, and the specificity for particular Rab<br>
proteins.<br>
A number of human diseases have now been identified in which mutations<br>
affect either Rab proteins or their regulators. These human diseases serve to<br>
illustrate the cellular effects of alterations in Rab control in cells. Thus<br>
mutations in Rab27 (Griscelli syndrome), REP1 (choroiderma), RabGDIa (X-<br>
linked mental retardation) and RabGGT a subunit (Hermansky-Pudlack<br>
syndrome) are all implicated in human disease (as reviewed in Seabra et al<br>
Trends in Molecular Medicine (2002) 8;23-26, Olkkonen and Ikonen New<br>
England Journal of Medicine (2000) 343; 1104)). A wide range of human<br>
diseases involve defects in intracellular trafficking (as reviewed in Aridor and<br>
Hannan Traffic (2000) 1;836-851). Modulation of membrane fusion via the<br>
specialised properties of bacterial effector proteins directed at one of the 4<br>
mechanisms described above offers therapeutic opportunities for these<br>
diseases and others where transport properties are affected.<br>
The targeting of the membrane fusion event between secretory vesicles and<br>
the plasma membrane allow the control of secretion from cells. Effectors that<br>
alter regulation of specific Rab proteins, either directly or via one of the<br>
mechanisms described above, including Rab3a,b,c and d, Rab8a and b,<br>
Rab26, Rab27a Rab37, or affect any of the other molecular events of<br>
membrane fusion (1-4 described above) can regulate secretion. Effector<br>
proteins can be applied to either increase or decrease secretion from a specific<br>
cell type. In a therapeutic context this is valuable for the treatment of a wide<br>
range of disorders including muscle spasms (blephorospasm, torticolis etc)<br>
hypersecretion disorders (COPD, bronchitis, asthma).<br>
By modulating the fusion of recycling endosomes with either the lysosome or<br>
the plasma membrane it also possible to modulate the presentation of specific<br>
families of cell surface marker. Again effectors directed to alter regulation of<br>
specific Rab proteins, such as Rab4a and b, Rab11a and b, Rab15, Rab17,<br>
Rab18 or affect other molecular events in the fusion mechanism, can either up<br>
or down regulate presentation of cell surface marker. Therapeutically this has<br>
enormous potential for altering the response of cells to external stimuli (e.g.<br>
modulating response to growth factors, hormones, cytokines, chemokines or<br>
other signalling molecules), modifying the recognition of cells by external<br>
factors (e.g. immune surveillance) or for switching cell signalling pathways on<br>
or off.<br>
Using constructs of the invention, therapeutic intervention can be provided in<br>
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Prion diseases<br>
(vCJD). Both diseases are characterised by the accumulation of insoluble<br>
protein plaques due to misfolding of cellular proteins. In both cases an<br>
intracellular amplification of misfolded protein, via passage through endosomal-<br>
lysosomal compartments, is implicated in the progression of the disease.<br>
Neuronally targeted bacterial effectors as described herein, which modulate the<br>
fusion of endosomal and lysosomal compartments, allow control of the<br>
accumulation of insoluble protein. As this is one of the key survival strategies<br>
of many intracelullar bacterial pathogens, a number of therapeutic molecules<br>
are available, for example Salmonella effectors such as SpiC, SptP and<br>
SopE2.<br>
In still further embodiments of the invention, constructs are provided for<br>
inhibition or promotion of secretion, containing a type III effector and a<br>
targeting moiety. Specific effectors for this purpose are selected from SpiC,<br>
SopE, RalF, Sse E, F, 6 and J, PipA, PipB, SifA and SifB. These constructs<br>
target the membrane fusion event between secretory vesicles and the plasma<br>
membrane to allow the control of secretion from cells. Effectors that alter<br>
regulation of specific Rab proteins, either directly or via one of the mechanisms<br>
described above, including Rab3a,b,c and d, Rab8a and b, Rab26, Rab27a<br>
Rab37, or affect any of the other molecular events of membrane fusion, can<br>
regulate secretion. Effector proteins can be applied to either increase or<br>
decrease secretion from a specific cell type. In a therapeutic context this is<br>
valuable for the treatment of a wide range of disorders including muscle<br>
spasms (blephorospasm, torticolis etc) hypersecretion disorders (COPD,<br>
bronchitis, asthma).<br>
The pathogenic strategy to establish a specialised intracellular niche and to<br>
modulate fusion of that compartment with other vesicles is conserved for a vast<br>
range of pathogens. Not only does this provide a vast range of molecules<br>
capable of modulating the cellular events as described above, but it also<br>
provides an array of potential therapeutic targets for such molecules. Although<br>
many of the intracellular pathogens described in table 2 establish membrane<br>
bound compartments, the precise biochemistry and the signalling events and<br>
effectors needed to maintain these compartments are very different. A few<br>
intracellular pathogens escape from the phagosomal or endosomal<br>
compartment in which they enter the cell. The effector proteins involved in this<br>
process are incompatible with the life cycle of pathogens that remain in<br>
membrane compartments. The effector proteins of two intracellular pathogens<br>
existing in membrane bound vesicles are also not necessarily compatible. For<br>
example, enhancement of Rab5a activity by Salmonella in macrophages is<br>
correlated with enhanced survival (Cell Microbiology 3;473-). However,<br>
increases in Rab5a expression/activity accelerates intracellular destruction of<br>
Listeria monocytogenes in macrophages (J. Biological Chemistry 274;11459).<br>
The Salmonella effector proteins that are likely to be involved in Rab5a<br>
recruitment (e.g. SopE2, SpiC or other SPI-2 secreted effectors) are therefore<br>
potential therapeutic agents for treating intracellular Listeria.<br>
In its crudest form anti-microbial therapy could involve treating one intracellular<br>
pathogen with a second pathogen on the basis that the two intracellular<br>
compartments and requirements of the organisms would not be compatible.<br>
For example treatment of TB infected macrophages with Salmonella might be<br>
expected to result in provoked "vacuole" lysosome fusion within the<br>
macrophage leading to the eradication of the TB. The type and fate of the<br>
super-infecting pathogen would have to be carefully chosen so as not to<br>
exacerbate the infectivity or spread of the original organism.<br>
A refinement of the superinfection strategy would therefore focus on the<br>
targeted delivery of effector molecules to specific target cells as described by<br>
this invention. This could either utilise a highly attenuated pathogen (e.g.<br>
Salmonella that only secretes SopE2 or SptP) or targeted protein delivery (e.g.<br>
using a toxin delivery domain, antibody or similar cell targeting ligands).<br>
Protective antigen from Bacillus anthracis would be capable of targeting<br>
effectors to macrophages for the treatment of a wide range of bacterial<br>
pathogens. The specific addition of carbohydrate moieties will enable specific<br>
targeting of pools of macrophages via the mannose receptor (e.g Vyas et al,<br>
InternationalJournal of Pharmaceutics (2000) 210p1 -14). A cell surface marker<br>
specific for infected cells (as distinct from uninfected cells) would offer an ideal<br>
target for delivery systems. The cell type infected by the pathogen would<br>
determine the choice of delivery ligand whilst the precise fate of the cell<br>
compartment would determine the choice of effector (e.g. cell apoptosis, lysis,<br>
endosome-lysosome fusion, endosome acidification etc).<br>
A key benefit of this type of therapy is that the effector proteins are not<br>
intrinsically toxic to the cell and therefore delivery of the protein to uninfected<br>
target cells is unlikely to have any deleterious effects. In this case, whilst<br>
desirable, the precise specificity of the targeting ligand is not essential for<br>
successful therapy.<br>
The wide range of intracellular pathogens and the difficulty in<br>
treating/immunising against these organisms make this approach a valuable<br>
alternative to antibiotic therapy. The method is also attractive as avoidance of<br>
the antimicrobial agent either means that the pathogen must produce a<br>
molecule capable of overriding the effector-induced cell stimulus or must<br>
significantly modify its lifestyle. For obligate intracellular pathogens or where<br>
the intracellular stage is essential for propagation, this may offer greater hopes<br>
for extended antimicrobial use than current antibiotic strategies targeted at<br>
specific biochemical interactions.<br>
In another example of the invention in which the effector protein is SpiC from<br>
Salmonella spp, the construct may consist of the following:-<br>
the SpiC effector moiety fused to a domain capable of interacting with<br>
protective antigen;<br>
the protective antigen from Bacillus anthracis;<br>
where the construct is either co-administered or where the SpiC moiety<br>
is administered after the protective antigen.<br>
The constructs of the invention are preferably produced either wholly or<br>
partially by recombinant technology. In an embodiment of the invention where<br>
a construct of the invention is produced by recombinant technology, the<br>
construct of the invention will be produced as a single multi-domain polypeptide<br>
comprising from the N-terminus:-<br>
the type III effector moiety;<br>
a linker peptide;<br>
the translocation domain; and<br>
the binding domain.<br>
In such a construct, the C-terminus of the type III effector protein is fused to the<br>
N-terminus of the translocation domain via the linker peptide. An example of<br>
such a linker peptide is the sequence CGLVPAGSGP which contains the<br>
thrombin protease cleavage site and a cysteine residue for disulphide bridge<br>
formation. The latter single chain fusion protein may then be treated with<br>
thrombin to give a dichain protein in which the type III effector is linked to the<br>
translocation domain by a disulphide link. In another example of a linker<br>
peptide in which the translocation domain does not contain a free cysteine<br>
residue near its C-terminus, such as is the case when the translocation domain<br>
is a fusogenic peptide, the linker peptide contains both cysteine residues<br>
required for the disulphide bridge. An example of the latter linker peptide is the<br>
amino acid sequence: CGLVPAGSGPSAGSSAC.<br>
In an example of the construct of the invention in which the type 111 effector<br>
moiety is SigD from Salmonella spp produced by recombinant technology, the<br>
construct may consist of polypeptide containing (from the N-terminus) the<br>
following domains:-<br>
the SigD type III effector moiety;<br>
linker peptide (sequence CGLVPAGSGP) to enable attachment of the<br>
SigD effector to the translocation domain via a disulphide bridge;<br>
the translocation domain from diphtheria toxin (residues 194-386); and<br>
the binding domain (Hc domain) from botulinum type A neurotoxin<br>
(residues 872-1296).<br>
The constructs of the invention may also be produced using chemical cross-<br>
linking methods. Various strategies are known by which type III effector<br>
proteins can be linked to a polypeptide consisting of the translocation domain<br>
and binding domain using a variety of established chemical cross-linking<br>
techniques. Using these techniques a variety of type III effector constructs can<br>
be produced. The type III effector protein is, for example, derivatised with the<br>
cross-linking reagent N-succinimidyl 3-[2-pyridyldithio] propionate. The<br>
derivatised type III effector is then linked to a peptide containing a translocation<br>
domain and binding domain via a free cysteine residue present on the<br>
translocation domain.<br>
Protein effectors can be altered to allow their delivery to intracellular<br>
compartments other than their usual site of action. For example, mitochondrial<br>
or nuclear targeting signals could be added to direct the effector to these<br>
compartments. By covalently linking the effector to the targeting domain the<br>
effector can be retained in the endosome/lysosome compartment, which would<br>
not normally be accessible by bacterial delivery. Effectors can be targeted to<br>
specific membrane locations via lipid modifications including myristoylation,<br>
palmitoylation, orthe addition of short proteins domains that might include SH2,<br>
SH3, WW domains, fragments of Rab proteins or synaptojanin-like domains.<br>
Those practised in the art would recognise that these targeting strategies offer<br>
an advantage for certain therapeutic strategies.<br>
Constructs of the invention may be introduced into either neuronal or non-<br>
neuronal tissue using methods known in the art. By subsequent specific binding<br>
to neuronal cell tissue, the targeted construct exerts its therapeutic effects.<br>
Ideally, the construct is injected near a site requiring therapeutic intervention.<br>
The construct of the invention may be produced as a suspension, emulsion,<br>
solution or as a freeze dried powder depending on the application and<br>
properties of the therapeutic substance. The construct of the invention may be<br>
resuspended or diluted in a variety of pharmaceutically acceptable liquids<br>
depending on the application.<br>
"Clostridial neurotoxin" means either tetanus neurotoxin or one of the seven<br>
botulinum neurotoxins, the latter being designated as serotypes A, B C,, D, E,<br>
F or G, and reference to the domain of a toxin is intended as a reference to the<br>
intact domain or to a fragment or derivative thereof which retains the essential<br>
function of the domain.<br>
"Conjugate" means, in relation to two polypeptides, that the polypeptides are<br>
linked by a covalent bond, typically forming a single polypeptide as a result, or<br>
by a di-sulphide bond.<br>
"Binding domain" means a polypeptide which displays high affinity binding<br>
specific to a target cell, e.g. neuronal cell binding corresponding to that of a<br>
clostridial neurotoxin. Examples of binding domains derived from clostridial<br>
neurotoxins are as follows:-<br>
Botulinum type A neurotoxin - amino acid residues (872 -1296)<br>
Botulinum type B neurotoxin - amino acid residues (859 - 1291)<br>
Botulinum type C neurotoxin - amino acid residues (867 - 1291)<br>
Botulinum type D neurotoxin - amino acid residues (863 -1276)<br>
Botulinum type E neurotoxin - amino acid residues (846 -1252)<br>
Botulinum type F neurotoxin - amino acid residues (865 -1278)<br>
Botulinum type G neurotoxin - amino acid residues (864 - 1297)<br>
Tetanus neurotoxin - amino acid residues (880 -1315)<br>
"High affinity binding specific to neuronal cell corresponding to that of a<br>
clostridial neurotoxin" refers to the ability of a ligand to bind strongly to cell<br>
surface receptors of neuronal cells that are involved in specific binding of a<br>
given neurotoxin. The capacity of a given ligand to bind strongly to these cell<br>
surface receptors may be assessed using conventional competitive binding<br>
assays. In such assays radiolabelled clostridial neurotoxin is contacted with<br>
neuronal cells in the presence of various concentrations of non-radiolabelled<br>
ligands. The ligand mixture is incubated with the cells, at low temperature (0-<br>
3°C) to prevent ligand internalization, during which competition between the<br>
radiolabelled clostridial neurotoxin and non-labelled ligand may occur. In such<br>
assays when the unlabelled ligand used is the same as that of the labelled<br>
neurotoxin, the radiolabelled clostridial neurotoxin will be displaced from the<br>
neuronal cell receptors as the concentration of non-labelled neurotoxin is<br>
increased. The competition curve obtained in this case will therefore be<br>
representative of the behaviour of a ligand which shows "high affinity binding<br>
specificity to neuronal cells corresponding to that of a clostridial neurotoxin", as<br>
used herein.<br>
A carrier that "targets" a particular cell generally does so due to binding of the<br>
carrier, or a portion thereof, to that cell and, by way of example, many different<br>
ligands with given cell type specificity are described herein.<br>
"Translocation domain" means a domain or fragment of a protein which effects<br>
transport of itself and/or other proteins and substances across a membrane or<br>
lipid bilayer. The latter membrane may be that of an endosome where<br>
translocation will occur during the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis.<br>
Translocation domains can frequently be identified by the property of being<br>
able to form measurable pores in lipid membranes at low pH (Shone et al. Eur<br>
J. Biochem. 167, 175-180). Examples of translocation domains are set out in<br>
more detail below:<br>
Diphtheria toxin - amino acid residues (194 - 386)<br>
Botulinum type A neurotoxin - amino acid residues (449 - 871)<br>
Botulinum type B neurotoxin - amino acid residues (441 - 858)<br>
Botulinum type C neurotoxin - amino acid residues (442 - 866)<br>
Botulinum type D neurotoxin - amino acid residues (446 - 862)<br>
Botulinum type E neurotoxin - amino acid residues (423 - 845)<br>
Botulinum type F neurotoxin - amino acid residues (440 - 864)<br>
Botulinum type G neurotoxin - amino acid residues (442 - 863)<br>
Tetanus neurotoxin - amino acid residues (458 - 879)<br>
Translocation domains are frequently referred to herein as "HN domains".<br>
"Translocation" in relation to translocation domain, means the intemalization<br>
events that occur after binding to the cell surface. These events lead to the<br>
transport of substances into the cytosol of target cells.<br>
"Injected effector secreted by type III or type IV secretion system" means<br>
bacterial proteins that are injected into host cells (mammalian, plant, insect, fish<br>
or other) via a modified pilus or "needle-like" injection system frequently<br>
referred to as type III or type IV secretion systems" and the term embraces<br>
fragments, modifications and variations thereof that retain the essential effector<br>
activity.<br>
The invention thus uses modification of intracellular signalling for promoting<br>
neuronal growth. Many of the effectors and inhibitors that control the<br>
development of the growth cone act through common intracellular signalling<br>
pathways that modulate the phosphorylation state of cytoskeletal components<br>
and that ultimately determine whether the axon grows or collapses. The<br>
appropriate manipulation of intracellular signalling is therefore a powerful<br>
approach for eliminating the need for multiple inhibitors of the many factors<br>
shown to induce apoptosis and growth cone collapse. The up-regulation of<br>
transcription factors that inhibit apoptosis is an example of manipulation of<br>
intracellular signalling to promote neural regeneration.<br>
Strategies for therapeutic intervention using the effectors and compositions of<br>
the invention include the delivery of agents to eliminate stress-inducing factors<br>
and the modification of intracellular signalling to promote cell survival. The<br>
latter approach is particularly powerful and the present invention describes<br>
conjugates with type III effector moieties which allow such strategies to be<br>
pursued.<br>
The constructs of this invention use a specific targeting system to ensure<br>
delivery of the therapeutic agent to the desired cells and uses bacterial toxins<br>
that have evolved to regulate key stages in the cell signalling machinery of the<br>
cells. This strategy offers a number of advantages over other drug platforms.<br>
The cell specificity ensures that any alterations in cell signalling occur only in<br>
the cells where this modification is desirable and not in other adjacent cells. For<br>
example, in neuronal cell-targeted constructs, changes in signalling would only<br>
take place in neurones and not in adjacent glial cells where such changes<br>
might not be desirable. By targeting key intermediates in the signalling<br>
pathway it is possible to co-ordinately regulate a number of overlapping cellular<br>
events to promote the desired effect. For example, the activation of Akt by SigD<br>
causes an effect on cells by co-ordinating a number of signalling pathways to<br>
actively promote cell survival and block the induction of apoptosis in response<br>
to stress factors. This is also a good example of an effector that activates a<br>
component of a cell-signalling pathway. Most drug discovery approaches tend<br>
to identify inhibitors of specific components.<br>
The invention is now illustrated in the following specific examples.<br>
Examples:<br>
Example 1. Cloning and expression of type III effector genes.<br>
Standard molecular biology protocols were used for all genetic manipulations<br>
(Sambrookef a/1989, Molecular cloning; A laboratory manual. Second Edition,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York.). Genes encoding Type III<br>
effectors, truncated versions removing the N-terminal hydrophobic domain (e.g<br>
removal of amino acids 1-28 for SigD, 1-69 for SptP, 1-76 for SopE), or<br>
individual sub-domains (e.g. ExoS GAP domain amino acids 96-234 and ADP-<br>
ribosyltransferase domain amino acids 232-453), were amplified from genomic<br>
DNA by PCR to generate suitable restriction sites for cloning. In some cases<br>
synthetic genes were prepared with codon usage, optimised for expression in<br>
E.coli. Restriction enzymes such as BamHI (5') and Bg/Ii (3') were used for<br>
cloning with reading frames maintained. Constructs were sequenced to<br>
confirm the presence of the correct sequence. Constructs for expression were<br>
subcloned, as a suitable fragment, into an expression vector carrying a T7<br>
polymerase promoter site (e.g. pET28, pET30 or derivatives (Novagen Inc,<br>
Madison, Wl)), to generate a fusion with maltose binding protein (e.g. pMALc2x<br>
(NEB)) or into other expression vectors known to those familiar with the art.<br>
Clones with confirmed sequences were used to transform expression hosts:<br>
For T7 polymerase vectors E.coli BL21 (DE3) (Studier and Moffatt 1986<br>
Journal of Molecular Biology 189:113-130) JM109 (DE3) or equivalent strains<br>
with a DE3 lysogen. For pMalc2x JM109, BL21, TG1, TB1 or other suitable<br>
expression strains.<br>
In addition to the expression of type III effectors as standard fusion proteins an<br>
additional approach was used to generate fusion proteins. The type III effector<br>
or truncated effector generated as above were cloned into the 51 end of a gene<br>
encoding a cell targeting ligand, which include toxin fragments, antibodies,<br>
growth factors, lectins, interleukins, peptides. These fusion proteins were<br>
cloned and expressed as either 6-His tagged, MBP tagged or other fusions as<br>
described above.<br>
Expression cultures were grown in Terrific Broth containing 30ug/ml kanamycin<br>
and 0.5% (w/v) glucose to an OD600 of 2.0 and protein expression was induced<br>
with 500uM IPTG for 2 hours. Cells were lysed by either sonication or suitable<br>
detergent treatment (e.g. Bugbuster reagent; Novagen), cell debris pelleted by<br>
centrifugation and the supernatant loaded onto a metal chelate column charged<br>
with Cu2+ (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).<br>
The recombinant proteins expressed from pET vectors contain amino-terminal<br>
histidine (6-His) and T7 peptide tags allowing proteins to be purified by affinity<br>
chromatography on either a Cu2+ charged metal chelate column. After loading<br>
proteins on the column and washing, proteins were eluted using imidazole. All<br>
buffers were used as specified by manufacturers. Where appropriate removal<br>
of the purification tag was carried out according to manufacturers instructions.<br>
MBP fusions were purified on amylose resin columns as described by the<br>
manufacturer (NEB) following growth in Terrific Broth containing 100 ug/ml<br>
ampicillin and lysis as described above.<br>
Other fusion systems were used according to manufacturer's instructions and<br>
purification carried out on suitable columns using defined methods.<br>
Example 2. Production of recombinant targeting vectors consisting of<br>
translocation and binding domains<br>
Standard molecular biology protocols were used for ail genetic manipulations<br>
(Sambrook et al 1989, Molecular cloning; A laboratory manual. Second Edition,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York.) Clostridial neurotoxin binding<br>
domains (BoNT/Hc or TeNT/Hc) derived from either their native genes or<br>
synthetic genes with codon usage optimised for expression in E.coli were<br>
amplified by PCR. Introduced BamHI (5') restriction sites and Hindlll, Sa/I or<br>
EcoRI (3') sites were used for most cloning operations with reading frames<br>
designed to start with the first base of the restriction site. Constructs were<br>
sequenced to confirm the presence of the correct sequence. The translocation<br>
domain of diphtheria toxin (DipT) was amplified from its native gene to<br>
introduce BamHI and Bgl\\ sites at the 5' and 3' ends respectively. This BamHI<br>
and Bg/ll fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site at the 5' end of the Hc<br>
fragment to generate an in-frame fusion. The entire heavy chain fragment<br>
(DipT-Hc) was excised as a BamHl-Hind\\\ or BamHI-Sa/l or BamHI-EcoRI<br>
fragment and subcloned into a suitable expression vector.<br>
Constructs for expression were subcloned into either an expression vector<br>
carrying a T7 polymerase promoter site (e.g. pET28, pET30 or derivatives<br>
(Novagen Inc, Madison, Wl)) or to generate a fusion with maltose binding<br>
protein (e.g. pMALc2x (NEB)) as a suitable fragment. Clones with confirmed<br>
sequences were used to transform expression hosts: For T7 polymerase<br>
vectors E.coli BL21 (DE3) (Studier and Moffatt 1986 Journal of Molecular<br>
Biology 189:113-130) JM109 (DE3) or equivalent strains with a DE3 lysogen.<br>
For pMalc2x JM109, BL21, TG1, TB1 or other suitable expression strains.<br>
The recombinant proteins expressed from pET vectors contain amino-terminal<br>
histidine (6-His) and T7 peptide tags allowing proteins to be purified by affinity<br>
chromatography on either a Cu2+ charged metal chelate column. Expression<br>
cultures were grown in Terrific Broth containing 30microg/ml kanamycin and<br>
0.5% (w/v) glucose to an OD600 of 2.0 and protein expression was induced with<br>
500microM IPTG for 2 hours. Cells were lysed by either sonication or suitable<br>
detergent treatment (e.g. Bugbuster reagent; Novagen), cell debris pelleted by<br>
centrifugation and the supernatant loaded onto a metal chelate column charged<br>
with Cu2+ (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). After loading<br>
proteins on the column and washing, proteins were eluted using imidazole. All<br>
buffers were used as specified by manufacturers. Where appropriate removal<br>
of the purification tag was carried out according to manufacturers instructions.<br>
MBP fusions were purified on amylose resin columns as described by the<br>
manufacturer (NEB) following growth in Terrific Broth containing 100 microg/ml<br>
ampicillin and lysis as described above.<br>
Thrombin or factor Xa protease sites were included within the protein for<br>
subsequent removal of these purification tags.<br>
Additional sequences for adding affinity purification tags and one or more<br>
specific protease sites for the subsequent removal of these affinity tags may<br>
also be included in the reading frame of the gene products.<br>
Other coding sequences that enable expression of the desired protein would<br>
also be acceptable. Other tags or linking sites may also be incorporated into<br>
the sequence.<br>
Using the techniques described above, targeting vector fragments were<br>
constructed by fusing domains of the Hc fragments of either botulinum type A,<br>
type F or tetanus neurotoxins with the translocation domain of diphtheria toxin.<br>
Example 3. Preparation of botulinum heavy chains by chemical methods.<br>
The various serotypes of the clostridial neurotoxins may be prepared and<br>
purified from various toxigenic strains of Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium<br>
tetani by methods employing standard protein purification techniques as<br>
described previously (Shone and Tranter 1995, Current Topics in Microbiology,<br>
194, 143-160; Springer). Samples of botulinum neurotoxin (1mg/ml) are<br>
dialysed against a buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0,1M NaCI and 2.5M<br>
urea for at least 4 hours at 4°C and then made 100mM with dithiothreitol and<br>
incubated for 16h at 22°C. The cloudy solution, which contains precipitated light<br>
chain, is then centrifuged at 15000 x g for 2 minutes and the supernatant fluid<br>
containing the heavy chain retained and dialysed against 50mM HEPES pH 7.5<br>
containing 0.2M NaCI and 5mM dithiothreitol for at least 4 hours at 4°C. The<br>
dialysed heavy chain is centrifuged at 15000 x g for 2 minutes and the<br>
supernatant retained and dialysed thoroughly against 50mM HEPES pH 7.5<br>
buffer containing 0.2M NaCI and stored at -70°C. The latter procedure yields<br>
heavy chain &gt;95% pure with a free cysteine residue which can be used for<br>
chemical coupling purposes. Biological (binding) activity of the heavy chain<br>
may be assayed as described in Example 5.<br>
The heavy chains of the botulinum neurotoxins may also be produced by<br>
chromatography on QAE Sephadex as described by the methods in Shone and<br>
Tranter (1995) (Current Topics in Microbiology, 194, 143-160; Springer).<br>
Example 4. Chemical conjugation of proteins<br>
Recombinant SigD type III effector from Salmonella spp. was cloned and<br>
purified as described in Example 1. The SigD type III effector was chemically<br>
modified by treatment with a 3-5 molar excess of N-succinimidyl 3-[2-<br>
pyridyldithio] propionate (SPDP) in 0.05M Hepes buffer pH 7.0 containing 0.1M<br>
NaCI for 60 min at 22°C. The excess SPDP was removed by dialysis against<br>
the same buffer at 4°C for 16h. The substituted SigD effector was then mixed<br>
in a 1:1 ratio and incubated at 4°C for 16h with a targeting vector comprising<br>
a translocation domain (with an available free cysteine residue) and a neuronal<br>
targeting domain (see Example 2). The latter may also be native heavy chain<br>
purified from Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin purified as described in<br>
Example 3. During the incubation period the SigD effector was conjugated to<br>
the targeting vector fragment by a free sulphydryl group. After incubation, the<br>
SigD-construct was purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex<br>
G200.<br>
Example 5. Assay of the biological activity of constructs -<br>
demonstration of high affinity binding to neuronal cells.<br>
Clostridial neurotoxins may be labelled with 125-iodine using chloramine-T and<br>
its binding to various cells assessed by standard methods such as described<br>
in Evans et al. 1986, Eur J. Biochem., 154, 409 or Wadsworth et al. 1990,<br>
Biochem. J. 268, 123), In these experiments the ability of Type III constructs<br>
to compete with native clostridial neurotoxins for receptors present on neuronal<br>
cells or brain synaptosomes was assessed. All binding experiments were<br>
carried out in binding buffers. For the botulinum neurotoxins this buffer<br>
consisted of: 50mM HEPES pH 7.0,30mM NaCI, 0.25% sucrose, 0.25% bovine<br>
serum albumin. For tetanus toxin, the binding buffer was: 0.05M tris-acetate<br>
pH 6.0 containing 0.6% bovine serum albumin. In a typical binding experiment<br>
the radidlabelled clostridial neurotoxin was held at a fixed concentration of<br>
between 1-20nM. Reaction mixtures were prepared by mixing the radiolabelled<br>
toxin with various concentrations of unlabelled neurotoxin or construct. The<br>
reaction mixtures were then added to neuronal cells or rat brain synaptosomes<br>
and then incubated at 0-3°C for 2hr. After this period the neuronal cells of<br>
synaptosomes were washed twice with binding ice-cold binding buffer and the<br>
amount of labelled clostridial neurotoxin bound to cells or synaptosomes was<br>
assessed by S-counting. In an experiment using an Type III effector construct<br>
what contained the binding domain from botulinum type A neurotoxin, the<br>
construct was found to compete with 125l-labelled botulinum type A neurotoxin<br>
for neuronal cell receptors in a similar manner to unlabelled native botulinum<br>
type A neurotoxin. These data showed that the construct had retained binding<br>
properties of the native neurotoxin.<br>
Example 6. Recombinant Type III effector constructs<br>
Recombinant Type III effector-targeting vector constructs were prepared<br>
comprising a combination of the following elements:-<br>
- a type III effector (e.g. SigD from Salmonella spp.)<br>
- a linker region, which allows the formation of a disulphide bond between the<br>
type III effectors and the translocation domain and which also contains a<br>
unique protease cleavage site for cleavage by factor Xa or thrombin to allow<br>
the formation of a dichain molecule;<br>
- a translocation domain from diphtheria toxin or a endosomolytic (fusogenic)<br>
peptide from influenza virus haemagglutinin); and<br>
- a neuronal cell-specific binding domain (e.g. from tetanus or botulinum<br>
neurotoxin type A or botulinum neurotoxin type F).<br>
The protein sequences of these various domains form specific embodiments<br>
of the invention and are shown below the examples.<br>
To confirm the nature of their structure, the recombinant Type III effector-<br>
targeting vector constructs were converted to the dichain form by treatment with<br>
a unique protease corresponding to the cleavage site sequences within the<br>
linker region. Conjugates containing the thrombin cleavage site were treated<br>
with thrombin (20microg per mg of conjugate) for 20h at 37°C; conjugates<br>
containing the factor Xa cleavage site were treated with factor Xa (20microg per<br>
mg of conjugate) for 20 min at 22°C.<br>
On SDS-PAGE gels, under non-reducing conditions, the majority of Type III<br>
effector-targeting vector construct appeared as single band. In the presence<br>
of reducing agent (dithiothreitol) two bands were observed corresponding to the<br>
type III effector and targeting vector (translocation and binding domains). These<br>
data illustrate that, after treatment with the unique protease, the conjugates<br>
consist of the latter two components which are linked by a disulphide bridge.<br>
Example 7. Formation of Type III effector constructs from Type III<br>
effector-diphtheria toxin A (CRM197) fusion proteins.<br>
Type III effector-targeting vector constructs may also formed in vitro by<br>
reconstitution from two recombinant fragments. These are:-<br>
A Type III effector fused to inactive diphtheria fragment A (CRM197) as<br>
described in Example 1.<br>
A recombinant targeting vector in which the translocation domain of diphtheria<br>
toxin is fused to a neuronal targeting domain such as that from a clostridial<br>
neurotoxin. Production of these is described in Example 2.<br>
Type III effector constructs may be formed by mixing fragments 1 and 2 in<br>
equimolar proportions in the presence of 10mM dithiothreitol and them<br>
completely removing the reducing agent by dialysis against phosphate buffered<br>
saline at pH 7.4 followed by dialysis against HEPES (0.05M, pH 7.4)<br>
containing 0.15 M NaCI. As described above in Example 6, these constructs<br>
appear as a single band in SDS gels under non-reducing conditions and two<br>
bands in the presence of a reducing agent.<br>
Example 8. Formulation of the Type III effector construct for clinical use.<br>
In a formulation of the Type III effector construct for clinical use, recombinant<br>
Type III effector construct would be prepared under current Good<br>
Manufacturing Procedures. The construct would be transferred, by dilution, to<br>
a solution to give the product stability during freeze-drying. Such a formulation<br>
may contain Type III effector construct (concentration between 0.1-10 mg/ml)<br>
in 5mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.2), 50mM NaCI, 1% lactose. The solution, after<br>
sterile filtration, would be aliquotted, freeze-dried and stored under nitrogen at<br>
-20°C.<br>
Example 9. Production of constructs with neuroprotective properties.<br>
SigD was cloned (without the first 29 condons) using the methods outlined in<br>
Example 1. The protein was expressed and purified either as a fusion with<br>
maltose binding protein (e.g. using pMALc2x) or with a Histidine6 (e.g. using<br>
pET28a). Purification tags were then removed by standard procedures after<br>
affinity purication of the fusion protein. Chemical constructs of SigD were<br>
prepared as outlined in Example 4.<br>
A recombinant construct of the invention containing SigD linked to the<br>
translocation domain and binding domain of botulinum type A neurotoxin was<br>
prepared as outlined in Example 6 using the standard molecular biology<br>
procedures outlined in Example 1.<br>
Application of the above constructs to neuronal cells leads to the receptor-<br>
mediated intemalisation of SigD and subsequent activation of Akt Kinase.<br>
Such cells have an enhanced ability to withstand stress such as growth factor<br>
removal.<br>
Example 10. Constructs for the treatment of neurodenerative disease<br>
Constructs for treatment of neurodegenerative disease and containing the<br>
effectors SpiC, SptP or SopE2 were prepared as outlined in Example 9.<br>
Example 11. Constructs for regulating cellular secretion and expression<br>
of cell surface receptors<br>
For neuronal cells, constructs containing the effectors SpiC, SopE, RalF,<br>
SseE.F.G and J, PipA and B, SifA and B were prepared as outlined in<br>
Example 9.<br>
For non-neuronal cells, the targeting domain may be replaced by a ligand with<br>
specificity for the target cell type. Such ligands may be selected from a list<br>
including: antibodies, carbohydrates, vitamins, hormones, cytokines, lectins,<br>
interleukins, peptides, growth factors, cell attachment proteins, toxin fragments,<br>
viral coat proteins.<br>
Example 12 Constructs for the treatment of intracellular pathogens<br>
Constructs containing the effectors SopE/SopE2, RalF, SpiC, SseE.F.G or J,<br>
PipA or B, SifA or B, or other effectors, for example those described in table<br>
1, are useful therapeutic agents for treatment of disease.<br>
Constructs were prepared essentially as described in example 9 but with a<br>
suitable binding domain selected from a list including; antibodies,<br>
