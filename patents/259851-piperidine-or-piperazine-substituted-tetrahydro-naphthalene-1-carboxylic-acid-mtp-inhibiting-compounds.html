PIPERJDINE OR PIPERAZINE SUBSTITUTED TETRAHYDRO-NAPHTHALENE-1-CARBOXYLIC ACID MTP INHIBITING COMPOUNDS<br>
5      The present invention is concerned with novel piperidine or piperazine substituted tetrahydro-naphthalene-I-carboxylic acid derivatives having apoB secretion/MTP inhibiting activity and concomitant lipid lowering activity. The invention further relates to methods for preparing such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds as well as the use of said compounds as a medicine for the treatment of 10      atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and type II diabetes.<br>
Obesity is the cause of a myriad of serious health problems like the adult onset of diabetes and heart disease. In addition, losing weight is getting an obsession among an 15      increasing proportion of the human population.<br>
The causal relationship between hypercholesterolemia, particularly that associated with increased plasma concentrations of low density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as VLDL), and premature 20      atherosclerosis and/or cardiovascular disease is now widely recognized. However, a limited number of drugs are presently available for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.<br>
Drugs primarily used for the management of hyperlipidemia include bile acid sequestrant resins such as cholestyramine and colestipol, fibric acid derivatives such as 25      bezafibrate, clofibrate, fenofibrate, ciprofibrate and gemfibrozil, nicotinic acid and cholesterol synthesis inhibitors such as HMG Co-enzyme-A reductase inhibitors. There still remains a need for new lipid lowering agents with improved efficiency and/or acting via other mechanisms than the above mentioned drugs.<br>
30      Plasma lipoproteins are water-soluble complexes of high molecular weight formed from lipids (cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipids) and apolipoproteins. Five major classes of lipoproteins that differ in the proportion of lipids and the type of apolipoprotein, all having their origin in the liver and/or the intestine, have been defined according to their density (as measured by ultracentrifugation). They include<br>
35      LDL, VLDL, intermediate density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as IDL), high<br>
density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as HDL) and chylomicrons. Ten major human plasma apolipoproteins have been identified. VLDL, which is secreted by the liver and contains apolipoprotein B (hereinafter referred as Apo-B), undergoes degradation to<br>
2 2 APR 2009<br><br>
WO 2008/049806	PCT/EP2007/061286<br>
LDL which transports 60 to 70% of the total serum cholesterol. Apo-B is also the main protein component of LDL. Increased LDL-cholesterol in serum, due to oversynthesis or decreased metabolism, is causally related to atherosclerosis. In contrast high density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as HDL), which contain apolipoprotein Al, have a 5      protective effect and are inversely correlated with the risk of coronary heart disease. The HDL/LDL ratio is thus a convenient method of assessing the atherogenic potential of an individual's plasma lipid profile.<br>
The two isoforms of apolipoprotein (apo) B, apo B-48 and apo B-100, are important 10      proteins in human lipoprotein metabolism. Apo B-48, is about 48% the size of apo B-100 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, is synthesized by the intestine in humans. Apo B-48 is necessary for the assembly of chylomicrons and therefore has an obligatory role in the intestinal absorption of dietary fats. Apo B-100, which is produced in the liver in humans, is required for the synthesis and secretion of 15      VLDL. LDL, which contain about 2/3 of the cholesterol in human plasma, are<br>
metabolic products of VLDL. Apo B-100 is virtually the only protein component of LDL. Elevated concentrations of apo B-100 and LDL cholesterol in plasma are recognized risk factors for developing atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.<br>
20      A large number of genetic and acquired diseases can result in hyperlipidemia. They can be classified into primary and secondary hyperlipidemic states. The most common causes of the secondary hyperlipidemias are diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, drugs, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, cholestasis and bulimia. Primary hyperlipidemias have also been classified into common hypercholesterolaemia,<br>
25      familial combined hyperlipidaemia, familial hypercholesterolaemia, remnant<br>
hyperlipidaemia, chylomicronaemia syndrome and familial hypertriglyceridaemia.<br>
Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (hereinafter referred as MTP) is known to<br>
catalyze the transport of triglyceride, cholesteryl ester and phospholipids such as 30      phosphatidylcholine. This indicates that MTP is required for the synthesis of Apo B-<br>
containing lipoproteins such as chylomicrons and VLDL, the precursor to LDL.<br>
It therefore follows that an MTP inhibitor would inhibit the synthesis of VLDL and<br>
LDL, thereby lowering levels of VLDL, LDL, cholesterol and triglyceride in humans.<br>
Compounds capable of inhibiting MTP are believed to be useful in the treatment of 35      disorders such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia,<br>
class II diabetes, atherosclerosis and for the reduction of postprandial serum<br>
triglyceride plasma levels.<br>

The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are 25      meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. These pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and 30      the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic (i.e. ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butanedioic acid), maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, /Moluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and<br>

The compounds of formula (I) may exist in both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term 'solvate' is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising a compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, e.g.<br>
ethanol. The term 'hydrate' is used when said solvent is water. 5<br>
The N-oxide form of the compound according to formula (I) is meant to comprise a compound of formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to so-called N-oxides, particularly those Af-oxides wherein one or more tertiary nitrogens, (e.g. of the piperazinyl or piperidinyl radical) are W-oxidized. Such AT-oxides can easily<br>
10      be obtained by a skilled person without any inventive skills and they are obvious alternatives for a compound according to formula (I) since these compounds are metabolites, which are formed by oxidation in the human body upon uptake . As is generally known, oxidation is normally the first step involved in drug metabolism (Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, 1977, pages 70 - 75).<br>
15      As is also generally known, the metabolite form of a compound can also be<br>
administered to a human instead of the compound per se, with much the same effects.<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be converted to the corresponding N-oxide form following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide<br>
20      form. Said iV-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the compound of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid<br>
25      or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic<br>
acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. rm-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydro¬carbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
30<br>
The term "stereochemicaly isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the possible isomeric forms which the compounds of formula (I) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereo chemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all 35      diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. More in particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; subsrituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E or Z-stcreochemistry at said<br>

double bond. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
The absolute stereochemical configuration of the compounds of formula (I) and of the 5      intermediates used in their preparation may easily be determined by those skilled in the art using well-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.<br><br>
10<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) have at least two asymmetric carbon atoms as illustrated below wherein the asymmetric carbon atoms are identified by a *.<br><br><br><br><br>
15<br><br>
Due to the the presence of at least two asymmetric carbon atoms, generally the term "a compound of formula (I)" encompasses a mixture of four stereoisomers. Most compounds of the present invention have been prepared either with the trans¬configuration or the cis-configuration:<br><br><br>

10<br><br>
Each of the above depicted "cis"- or "trans" compounds consists of a racemic mixture of two enantiomers and bold bonds or hashed bonds have been used to indicate this relative stereochemical configuration.<br>
In case a "cis"- or "trans,,-compound was separated into its two individual enantiomers, the bold and hashed bonds were replaced by wedged bonds to indicate the compound is a single enantiomer. If the absolute stereochemistry of a specific chiral carbon atom in a single enantiomer was not determined, its stereochemical configuration was than designated as R*, or S* indicating a relative stereochemistry.<br><br><br><br>
15<br><br>
Furthermore, some compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates used in their preparation may exhibit polymorphism. It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses any polymorphic forms possessing properties useful in the treatment of the conditions noted hereinabove.<br><br><br><br>
20<br><br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. For instance, when an aromatic heterocyclic ring is substituted with hydroxy the keto-form may be the mainly populated tautomer.<br><br>

Also within the scope of the invention are so-called "pro-drugs" of the compounds of formula (I). Pro-drugs are certain derivatives of pharmaceutically active compounds which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves which can, when 5      administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired pharmaceutical activity, e.g. by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as "pro-drugs".<br>
In the framework of this application, a compound according to the invention is 10      inherently intended to comprise all isotopic combinations of its chemical elements. In the framework of this application, a chemical element, in particular when mentioned in relation to a compound according to formula (I), comprises all isotopes and isotopic mixtures of this element, either naturally occuring or synthetically produced, either with natural abundance or in an isotopically enriched form. In particular, when 15      hydrogen is mentioned, it is understood to refer to lH, 2H, 3H and mixtures thereof; when carbon is mentioned, it is understood to refer to nC, 12C, 13C, 14C and mixtures thereof; when nitrogen is mentioned, it is understood to refer to 13N, l4N, 15N and mixtures thereof; when oxygen is mentioned, it is understood to refer to 140, I50,160, 170,180 and mixtures thereof; and when fluor is mentioned, it is understood to refer to 20      18F, i9F and mixtures thereof.<br>
A compound according to the invention therefore inherently comprises a compound with one or more isotopes of one or more element, and mixtures thereof, including a radioactive compound, also called radiolabeled compound, wherein one or more non-25      radioactive atoms has been replaced by one of its radioactive isotopes. By the term "radiolabeled compound" is meant any compound according to formula (I), a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salt thereof, an N-oxide form thereof, or a quaternary ammonium salt thereof, which contains at least one radioactive atom. For example, a compound can be labelled with positron or with gamma emitting 30      radioactive isotopes. For radioligand-binding techniques (membrane receptor assay), the 3H-atom or the l25I-atom is the atom of choice to be replaced.   For imaging, the most commonly used positron emitting (PET) radioactive isotopes are 11C, 18F, 150 and ,3N, all of which are accelerator produced and have half-lives of 20, 100, 2 and 10 minutes respectively. Since the half-lives of these radioactive isotopes are so short, it is 35      only feasible to use them at institutions which have an accelerator on site for then-production, thus limiting their use. The most widely used of these are ,aF, 99mTc, 20,T1 and 123I. The handling of these radioactive isotopes, their production, isolation and incorporation in a molecule are known to the skilled person.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated 5      from one another following art-known resolution procedures. Those compounds of formula (I) that are obtained in racemic form may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystalli- .tion and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative<br>
10      manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will<br>
15      be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), the N-oxide forms, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and stereoisomeric forms thereof possess favourable apoB secretion and MTP<br>
20      inhibiting activity and concomitant lipid lowering activity. Therefore the present<br>
compounds of formula (I) are useful as a medicine especially in a method of treating patients suffering from hyperlipidemia, obesity, atherosclerosis or type II diabetes. Subsequently the present compounds may be used for the manufacture of a medicine for treating disorders caused by an excess of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) or<br>
25      low density lipoproteins (LDL), and especially disorders caused by the cholesterol<br>
associated with said VLDL and LDL. In particular the present compounds may be used for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, obesity, atherosclerosis or type JI diabetes.<br>
30      The principal mechanism of action of the compounds of formula (I) appears to involve inhibition of MTP (microsomial triglyceride transfer protein) activity in hepatocytes and intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in decreased VLDL and chylomicron<br>

production, respectively. This is a novel and innovative approach to hyperiipidemia, and is expected to lower LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides through reduced hepatic production of VLDL and intestinal production of chylomicrons.<br>
5      A large number of genetic and acquired diseases can result in hyperiipidemia. They can be classified into primary and secondary hyperlipidemic states. The most common causes of the secondary hyperlipidemias are diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, drugs, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, cholestasis and bulimia. Primary hyperlipidemias are common hypercholesterolaemia, familial combined<br>
10      hyperlipidaemia, familial hypercholesterolaemia, remnant hyperlipidaemia, chylo-micronaemia syndrome, familial hypertriglyceridaemia. The present compounds may also be used to prevent or treat patients suffering from obesitas or from atherosclerosis, especially coronary atherosclerosis and more in general disorders which are related to atherosclerosis, such as ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral<br>
15      vascular disease. The present compounds may cause regression of atherosclerosis and inhibit the clinical consequences of atherosclerosis, particularly morbidity and mortality.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (I), it follows that the present 20      invention also provides a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, (generally called herein patients) suffering from disorders caused by an excess of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) or low density lipoproteins (LDL), and especially disorders caused by the cholesterol associated with said VLDL and LDL. Consequently a method of treatment is provided for relieving patients suffering from 25      conditions, such as, for example, hyperiipidemia, obesity, atherosclerosis or type II diabetes.<br>
Apo B-48, synthetized by the intestine, is necessary for the assembly of chylomicrons and therefore has an obligatory role in the intestinal absorption of dietary fats. The 30      present invention provides compounds which arc acting as selective MTP inhibitors at the level of the gut wall.<br>

These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for oral administration, rectal 5      administration, percutaneous administration or parenteral injection.<br>
For example in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual liquid pharmaceutical carriers may be employed, such as for instance water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups,<br>
10      elixirs and solutions; or solid pharmaceutical carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their easy administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral injection compositions,<br>
15      the pharmaceutical carrier will mainly comprise sterile water, although other<br>
ingredients may be included in order to improve solubility of the active ingredient. Injectable solutions may be prepared for instance by using a pharmaceutical carrier comprising a saline solution, a glucose solution or a mixture of both. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared by using appropriate liquid carriers, suspending<br>
20      agents and the like. In compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the<br>
pharmaceutical carrier may optionally comprise a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with minor proportions of suitable additives which do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may be selected in order to facilitate administration of the active ingredient to the skin<br>
25      and/or be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These topical compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, a spot-on or an ointment. Addition salts of the compounds of formula (I), due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>

It is especially advantageous to formulate the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. "Dosage unit form" as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient calculated to<br>
35      produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof<br>

SFC-MS:<br>
For some compounds SFC-MS (Supercritical fluid chromatography-mass spectrometry) was<br>
measured with an analytical SFC system from Berger Instruments (Newark, DE, USA)<br>
5      comprising a dual pump control module (FCM-1200) for delivery of carbon dioxide (C02)<br>
and modifier, a thermal control module for column heating (TCM2100) with temperature<br>
control in the range of 1-150 °C and column selection valves (Valco, VICI, Houston, TX,<br>
USA) for six different columns. The photodiode array detector (Agilent 1100, Waldbronn,<br>
Germany) is equipped with a high-pressure flow cell (up to 400 bar) and configured with a<br>
10      CTC LC Mini PAL auto sampler (Leap Technologies, Carrboro, NC, USA). A ZQ mass<br>
spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with an orthogonal Z-electrospray interface is<br>
coupled with, the SFC-system. Instrument control, data collection and processing were<br>
performed with an integrated platform consisting of the SFC ProNTo software and Masslynx<br>
software. 15<br>

C. Pharmacological examples C.l. Quantification of the secretion of ApoB<br>
HepG2 cells were cultured in 24-well plates in MEM Rega 3 containing 10 % fetal calf serum. At 70 % confluency, the medium was changed and the test compound or carrier (DMSO, 0.4 % final concentration) was added. After 24 hours of incubation, the medium was transferred to Eppendorf tubes and cleared by centrifugation. A sheep antibody directed against either apoB was added to the supernatant and the mixture was kept at 8°C for 24 hours. Then, rabbit anti-sheep antibody was added and the immune complex was allowed to precipitate for 24 hours at 8°C- The immunoprecipitate was pelleted by centrifugation for 25 minutes at 1320 g and washed twice with a buffer containing 40 mM Mops, 40 mM NaH2P04,100 mM NaF, 0.2 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 % Triton-X-100, 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate (DOC), 0.1 % SDS, 0.2 uM leupeptin and 0.2 uM PMSF. Radioactivity in the pellet was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The IC50 values are usually converted to pIC50 values (= -log IC50 value) for ease of use.<br>

Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 40 mM NaCl, 0.02 % NaN3 (assay buffer) was added to the dried lipid. The mixture was vortexed briefly and the lipids were then allowed to hydrate for 20 minutes on ice. Vesicles were then prepared by bath sonication (Branson 2200) at room temperature for maximum 15 minutes. Butylated hydroxytoluene was included in all vesicle preparations at a concentration of 0.1%. The lipid transfer assay mixture contained donor vesicles (40 nmol phosphatidylcholine, 7.5 mol % of cardiolipin and 0.25 mol % glycerol tri [l-l4C]-oleate), acceptor vesicles (240 nmol phosphatidylcholine) and 5 mg BSA in a total volume of 675 u.1 in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Test compounds were added dissolved in DMSO (0.13 % final concentration). After 5 minutes of pre-incubation at 37°C, the reaction was started by the addition of MTP in 100 ul dialysis buffer. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 ul DEAE-52 cellulose pre-equilibrated in 15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02 % NaN3 (1:1, vol/vol). The mixture was agitated for 4 minutes and centrifuged for 2 minutes at maximum speed in an Eppecdorf centrifuge (4°C) to pellet the DEAE-52-bound donor vesicles. An aliquot of the supernatant containing the acceptor liposomes was counted and the [14C]-counts were used to calculate the percent triglyceride transfer from donor to acceptor vesicles.<br><br><br><br><br>
