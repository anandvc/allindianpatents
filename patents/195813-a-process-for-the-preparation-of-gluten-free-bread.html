				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of gluten free com bread.<br>
Bakery products are quite popular in India and rest of the world because of their ready to eat nature, availability of varieties to suit the palate of different cross-section of population; better nutritional quality and availability at comparatively low cost. Bread is an important bakery product that contribute to the maximum sales in the market. In India out of the total turn over of Rs. 5,000 crore in a bakery industry, bread industry alone is valued at Rs 1500 crores (Vikas Singhal, 1999 Indian Agriculture, Indian economic data research centre, pp 72-83). Recently bakery products are being used as a vehicle for incorporating various nutrients or substances that would improve the nutritional quality of product or health of the consumer. Hence various health products like high fibre bread, low sodium bread and sugar free bread have been produced on commercial scale to persons suffering from diabetes and hypertension patients.<br>
Bread is produced from wheat flour which contains gluten. Gluten is the unique protein present in the flour which impart elastic and viscous properties to the dough and contributes to gas retention property. Small segment of the population suffers from wheat intolerance disease known as coeliac disease and allergies. The symptoms may include cramps, diarrhoea, and pale, bulky stools. This is attributed to gliadin fraction of gluten (Kasarda, DD, Bakers digest, 1972, 46(6), 25).<br>
Therefore, there is a need for bread without using wheat flour as it contains gluten.<br>
Reference may be made to D Appolonia, 1977 Rheology and baking studies of legume - wheat flour blends. Cereal chemistry 54:53 wherein graded levels of wheat flour were substituted with non wheat flours to achieve degree of success in composite flour bread making. The drawback is that the breads contain gluten<br>
Reference may be made to Okaka 3.C and Potter, N.N 1977. Journal of Food Science wherein legume flour is utilised in replacing portions of wheat flour in bread making. The drawback is that the breads contain gluten.<br>
Reference may be made to Rotsh, A. 1954 Dro and Gebeck 8,129 wherein loose structured bread are prepared from starches that do not contain gluten -forming proteins, provided that a swelling agent is added when the dough is prepared. The drawback is that the final product had poor loaf volume and crumb structure.<br>
Reference may be made to Bowman F, Dilsaver, Ward Loreny, K, 1973 Bakers Digest 47, 15 wherein egg is used to improve the quality characteristics of breads obtained from gluten free flours, since these flour fail to form a continuos phase and thus lacking the necessary dough structure for the production of good quality bread. The drawback is that the use of egg in bread is not liked as it contributes to typical colour and flavour.<br>
Reference also may be made to Woestelandt Y, 1995 French-Patent-Application, FR 2 709 924 Al, FR 93-10948 (19930914) wherein gluten free bread is made with egg. The drawback is that the breads contain egg and the flavour is not liked.<br>
Reference may be made to Kinn Jinc and Ruiter, D D, 1968 Food Technology 22, 867 - wherein gluten free bread was prepared from flour containing cassava flour and soy flour. The drawback is that the breads had poor loaf volume.<br>
Reference may be made to Kulp K, Hepbur F. N and Lehmann T.A, 1974 Bakers Digest 48, 34 - wherein various emulsifiers were tried for preparing bread from wheat starch and different starch binding agents. The drawback is that no crumb softening effect was detected with xanthan gum and CMC in such breads.<br>
References may be made to Jongh.G. 1961 Cereal chemistry 9,165-where in glycerol monostearate (GMS) was used to produce bread from starch based material and concluded that a substance for binding starch granules is necessary. The drawback of such breads had poor grain structure.<br>
Reference may be made to Akobundu ENT, Ubbaonu C. N and Nduibh C I 1988 Journal of Food Science and technology 25, 211 wherein breads were prepared using non wheat flours. Such breads showed poor loaf volume, dense structure. The drawback is that there was little improvement where breads were prepared by making batters instead of dough.<br>
Reference may be made to Neumann H and Bruemer J M, 1997 Getcide - Meh and Brot. 51, 50 where in maize, millet and buck wheat flour had negative effect on bread quality. The drawback is that such breads had inferior quality.<br>
Reference may be made to Chatelard P, 1998 French-Patent-Application FR 2 765 0760 Al (FR 276507625) wherein gluten free bread based on potato and rice starch, a thickener and an emulsifier have been used. The drawback of such bread will have very low protein.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for gluten free bread.<br>
Yet another objective is to provide a formulation to prepare a uniform quality product having characteristics of normal bread.<br>
Gluten free breads are prepared with com starch as base material. Gaur gum provided the required structure and moisture retention in the final product. Toasted defatted soy flour and skim milk powder improved the taste and crumb characteristics of the final product.<br>

Yeast	3.0<br>
Guargum	2.25<br>
Water	80-120<br>
All the ingredients are mixed and the resultant batter is fermented, remixed, proved and baked. The results indicated that the breads prepared had hard texture and poor grain with lower (80%) water in the formulation and with higher amount of water (120%) the product had medium coarse texture , wet and sticky mouthfeel. Breads prepared with 100% water had good loaf volume, medium fine grain and soft texture.<br>

Salt	1.8<br>
Fat	5.0<br>
Yeast	3.0<br>
Guargum	2.25<br>
Water	100.0<br>
Gluten free breads are prepared as in example 1 except sugar content in the formulation is varied from 10 to 20%. With 5% sugar, breads are pale brown crust color and bland taste, where as with 20% sugar in the formulation produced gluten free breads with dark brown color. Breads prepared with 15% sugar had good loaf volume and sweet taste.<br>

Yeast	3.0<br>
Guargum	2.25<br>
Water	100.0<br>
All the ingredients are mixed and the resultant batter is fermented, remixed,<br>
proved and baked. The results indicated that the breads prepared with 2.5% fat in<br>
formulation had too fine grain, and very crumbly mouth feel. Breads prepared with 5%<br>
fat had good loaf volume, texture and mouth feel. Higher fat (10%) level produced breads<br>
with poor loaf volume.<br>
