				<td>This application is an improvement of the invention claimed in Indian Patent Application No. 1796/DEL/2006 filed on August 8, 2006.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention, in general relates to an improved process for producing S-omeprazole magnesium. More particularly, but without restriction to the particular embodiments hereinafter described in accordance with the best mode of practice, the present invention is directed to improved process for the preparation of S-omeprazole magnesium in amorphous form.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Different solid forms of the same drug may exhibit different properties, including characteristics that have functional implications with respect to their use as active ingredients of pharmaceutical products. For example, polymorphs of the same drug may have substantial differences in such pharmaceutically important properties such as dissolution rates and bioavailability. Likewise, different polymorphs may have different processing properties, such as hydroscopicity, flowability, and the like, which could affect their suitability as active pharmaceuticals for commercial production.<br>
Differently substituted 2-(2-pyridinylmethyl sulphinyl)-lH-benzimidazoles such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole are known as gastric acid secretion inhibitors. Omeprazole, chemically known as 5-methoxy-2-[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methylsulphinyl-lH-benzimidazole) is useful as an antiulcer agent.<br>
These structurally related sulphoxide compounds have a stereogenic center at the sulphur atom and thus exist as enantiomers. Certain salts of single enantiomers of omeprazole and their preparation are disclosed in DE4035455 and W097/27988.<br>
There are several methods known in the prior art, which discloses the asymmetric oxidation of prochiral sulfide.<br>
 <br>
US 5,948,789 and Eur. J. Biochem., 166 (1987), 453, describes enantioselective synthesis of substituted sulphoxide. In this process, a prochiral sulphide is oxidized into the corresponding sulphoxide either as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched form using oxidizing agent in the presence of chiral titanium complex and in presence of base and organic solvent.<br>
Similarly, WO2003089408 describes an enantioselective catalytic oxidation of sulfide with an oxidizing agent in an organic solvent and base and in the presence of titanium or vanadium complex with a chiral monodentate ligand.<br>
WO2005054228 describes an enantioselective process for the preparation of substituted benzimidazole by asymmetrically oxidizing substituted prochiral sulphide preferably halo or nitro substituted, in an organic solvent and base with an oxidizing agent and a chiral titanium complex into the corresponding sulphoxide.<br>
WO2005080374 describes enantioselective synthesis of sulphoxide compound either as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched form by oxidizing prochiral sulphoxide, with an oxidizing agent in an organic solvent at a temperature between 20-40°C and in the presence of chiral titanium complex.<br>
WO2006040635 describes synthesis of substituted sulphoxide by oxidizing prochiral sulphoxide in presence of chiral titanium metal complex and a base in the absence of an organic solvent.<br>
WO96/02535 discloses a process for the preparation of the single enantiomers of omeprazole and salts thereof, including a sodium salt.<br>
W097/41114 discloses an improved process for the preparation of omeprazole magnesium and S-omeprazole magnesium with a low content of inorganic impurities.<br>
WO2004/20436 discloses amorphous S-omeprazole magnesium in the form of hydrate and their process of preparation.<br>
 <br>
WO2004/046134 describes an amorphous S-omeprazole magnesium salt in the form of a trihydrate wherein the term trihydrate is used to define a crystalline material in which water molecules are bound in the crystalline lattice.<br>
WO2004/037253 discloses amorphous form of the salts of S-omeprazole, their process for preparing the same and their pharmaceutical composition.<br>
WO2006/096709 discloses amorphous solid omeprazole magnesium and S-omeprazole magnesium by subjecting a solution of omeprazole magnesium or S-omeprazole magnesium to agitated thin film drier vertical.<br>
WO2006/134605 discloses amorphous form of S-omeprazole hydrate, their process of preparation and pharmaceutical composition.<br>
WO2007/031845 discloses novel polymorphic forms of S-omeprazole trihydate and their process of preparation. The application also discloses process for the preparation of amorphous form of S-omepraole magnesium and their pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The above mentioned prior art references disclose the process of oxidation which is costly and not an environment friendly. The other disadvantage is requirement of strict reaction conditions during the oxidation and formation of sulphone by-product, which makes the process industrially uneconomical.<br>
These problems have been addressed in the parent application no. 1796/DEL/2005. The invention claimed therein is economically viable and eco-friendly process for the preparation of sulphoxide either as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched form, which avoids the use of organic solvent and base, the product is free from sulfone by-product and the process of preparation is cost effective and high yielding.<br>
Despite the foregoing, there still exists a need for a cost effective and industrially efficient process for making magnesium salt of S-omeprazole in amorphous form, which requires shorter manufacturing time, is easy to prepare on industrial scale with high chemical and optical purity and can be effectively used for different pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
 <br>
Further and other object of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art when considering the following summary of the invention and more detailed description of the preferred embodiments and examples contained herein.<br>

The prochiral sulfide of the Formula II is prepared by various methods known in the art. The prochiral sulfide of the Formula II is obtained as a solution, for example from a reaction mixture resulting directly from a reaction in which it is formed.<br>
The process claimed in the parent application further includes the optional step of converting the resulting alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of the optically active sulphoxide compound of Formula I to another alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of these compounds. For example,<br>
 <br>
S-omeprazole potassium is converted into S-omeprazole magnesium, wherein the alkali or alkaline earth metal source may be selected from Na+, Li+, K+, Mg+2, Ca+2 and Ba+2 salts such as bicarbonates, carbonates, hydrides, hydroxides, halides, sulphates, oxides and the like, preferably sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium halide, magnesium halide and barium halide may be used.<br>
The present improvement invention provides an improved process for producing magnesium salt of S-omeprazole.<br>
According to the present invention the resultant S-omeprazole magnesium in amorphous form having moisture content between 7 to 11% by weight as measured by the karl fischer method is easy to prepare and convenient to operate on commercial scale.<br>
The process for the preparation of S-omeprazole magnesium in amorphous form according to the present invention comprises of providing alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of S-omeprazole in water, adjusting pH of the reaction mixture to alkaline, contacting the resulting alkali or alkaline earth metal salt solution of S-omeprazole with an organic solvent selected from alkyl alcohol, adding a source of magnesium and isolating the precipitated solid.<br>
The alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of S-omeprazole is prepared by treating neutral form of S-omeprazole with alkali and/or alkaline earth metal source. The alkali or alkaline earth metal source may be selected from Na+, K+, Li+, Mg+2, Ca+2 and Ba+2 salts such as bicarbonates, carbonates, hydrides, hydroxides, halides, sulphates, and oxides, preferably sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium halide, calcium halide, barium halide and the like.<br>
The pH of the resulting mixture containing alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of S-omeprazole is adjusted between 10-11 using organic acid or weak base. The organic acid is selected from formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butanoic acid and the like. The weak base is selected from ammonium salt such as ammonium chloride, ammonium acetate and the like.<br>
According to the present invention, the organic solvent used during the process of the invention is selected from alkyl alcohol preferably selected from C1-C4 alkyl alcohol including but are not limited to straight or branched chain alcohols.    Most preferably the<br>
 <br>
solvent is selected from methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol and the like.<br>
The magnesium source used herein is selected from organic magnesium salt such as magnesium acetate, magnesium methoxide, and the like and mixture thereof. Preferably the magnesium source is magnesium acetate and/or magnesium methoxide. The molar ratio of the magnesium source to the alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of S-omeprazole ordinarily ranges from about 0.3 to about 0.8 and preferably from about 0.4 to 0.6.<br>
The process is not temperature sensitive and is carried out at ambient temperature. Suitable temperatures for preparing the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole in the amorphous form range from about 20-40°C preferably of about 20-30°C.<br>
The resulting solid is separated from the mother liquor (filtrate) by conventional methods such as by filtration or centrifugation. Other suitable procedure may be used to separate the product. The amorphous product is washed with water, and dried under vacuum at a temperature of about 40°C-60°C, preferably of about 40°C to 50°C to a constant weight.<br>
The S-omeprazole magnesium in amorphous form obtained as per the above process is stable and is well suited for pharmaceutical applications. The process of the present invention is simple, non-hazardous and well suited for commercial production. The process provides better yield, better purity and avoids the byproduct generation and multiple steps purification.<br>
The main advantage of the use of magnesium acetate as a source of magnesium in comparison to magnesium halides, is that during the conversion of S-omeprazole potassium to S-omeprazole magnesium, inorganic salts like potassium halide is generated as a by product. Removal of the said by product for example potassium halide from the final product require multiple purification steps as compared to the potassium acetate. This is due to reason that potassium halide has low solubility in water as compared to the potassium acetate. This enhanced the purity and yield of the final product.<br>
The examples that follow are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined herein above or as claimed below.<br>
