				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The invention relates to improved and economical process for recycling a mixture containing (R)-(-)-enriched clopidogrel and/or (R)-(-)-clopidogrel to obtain wanted (S)-(+) clopidogrel, by racemization followed by conventional method of resolution.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is known that methyl 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5-yl) acetate and their salts can be used in therapy due to their platelet-aggregation-inhibitory and antithrombotic effects. The compound is represented under general formula (1), wherein it is the dextrorotatory (S)-(+)-methyl 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5-yl) acetate hydrogen sulfate, with the international nonproprietary name (INN) clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate, which is the most preferred one.<br>
The optically active compound of formula (2), is prepared either from optically active intermediates obtained by resolving the intermediates, or by resolving the racemic mixture of the final product (1).<br>
Bakonyi, M. et. al (W09851689,1998) have reported the preparation of intermediates with formula (3), (4), and (5) and by resolving each using a suitable resolving agent, they obtained the respective intermediate in the chiral form. These they used for preparing the optically active end product.<br>
Aubert, D. et al (Sanofi-Synthelabo) (EP 009902,1999), have reported the synthesis of the (+)-clopidogrel by giving a resolution option of all their key intermediates. They prepared (+)-2-amino-2-(2-chlorophenyl)acetic acid (6), (+)-methyl 2-amino-2-(2-chlorophenyl)acetate (7) and (+)-methyl[2-(2-thienyl)ethylamino](2-chlorophenyl)acetate (8).<br>
In another approach, A. Bousquet et al in their patent WO 99/18110 have reported the synthesis of (R)-sulfonyloxyacetic ester derivatives of general formula (9) as possible<br><br>
chiral intenriediates for the synthesis of (S)-(+)-clopidogrel. The reaction conditions called for here are quite stringent and reagents used are expensive.<br>
Using chiral intermediates necessitates that the reaction conditions are mild so that no racemization occurs during the subsequent reactions. This warrants the use of anhydrous conditions, low temperatures and special reagents.<br>
Another option, which is cheaper, is to resolve the racemic clopidogrel and to recycle the enriched mother liquor containing unwanted (-) isomer by racemization followed by resolution of the racemic mixture. This has not so far been reported as prior art in the synthesis of clopidogrel<br>
Badorc, A. and Frehel, D. (EP 01281459, 1989) have reported a process for preparing (+)-clopidogrel by resolving the racemic hiixture with the (-) camphor - 10- sulphonic acid. They obtained at best 55 % of dextro- isomer based on its content in the starting racemic mixture. Further they treated the levo-enriched mixture with (+) camphor 10-sulphonic acid to remove the unwanted levo-isomer. In this process the unwanted levo-isomer was not recycled in the recovery process to obtain the wanted dextro- isomer.<br>
Large scale preparation of clopidogrel necessitates the development of an efficient, cost effective procedure, which will racemize the (-) enriched clopidogrel mixture and/or (-)-clopidogrel, followed by resolution using an appropriate resolving agent to obtain (S)-(+)-clopidogrel. In other words, a need is felt to have a practical process, whereby adopting racemization-resolution process, high yields of (+)-clopidogrel is obtained starting from a racemic mixture. This method should also ensure that no significant hydrolysis of the methyl ester function present in the clopidogrel takes place during the process of racemization. The present invention provides an optimum process condition achieving all these objectives.<br>
Some a-amino acid esters having primary amino group have been racemized in prior art by heating them in presence of ketones (i.e. through their Schiff base) alone (JP 79109912) or<br><br>
along with carboxylic acid (hit. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993, 41, 323-5) or along with tertiary amine (SU 929,629). But this methodology is not applicable to clopidogrel which has tertiary amino group.<br>
Generally, bases are used for the process of racemization; strong bases like sodium hydride, sodium methoxide etc. can cause significant hydrolysis to the ester group (Topics in Sterochemistry by C.J. Shah and S.H. Wu, 1989, 19, 63-125). If strong bases are used, then special care needs to be taken to prevent hydrolysis and transesterification. Thus, Takahashi et al report the use of sodium methoxide in anhydrous methyl acetate to racemize D-phenylalanine methyl ether at 20 °C (JP 79,84,522)<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention it to convert clopidogrel mixture having enriched unwanted (-)-isomer and/or (-)-clopidogrel to its racemate, without causing significant hydrolysis of the ester group, so that more of the wanted (S)-(+)-clopidogrel can be obtained by resolution.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process without using hazardous and expensive chemicals.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to avoid use of anhydrous solvents and to use common solvents like dichloromethane, acetone, toluene, etc.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to use cheap bases like alkali and alkaline earth metal carbonates, hydroxides and oxides.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to keep the work up process very simple.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to reduce time cycle as far as possible by using common phase transfer catalysts in the process.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an easy method to recover the hydrolysed acid, even if formed in small quantities, from the aqueous wash.<br>
Summary of the mvention<br>
The present invention provides a efficient and economical process for recycling a mixture containing enriched unwanted (-)-clopidogrel and/or (-)-clopidogrel by a process of racemization, followed by resolution of the mixture thus obtained by using a conventional process to yield wanted (S)-(+)-clopidogrel.<br>

Repeating the procedure in example 1 using K2CO3 (22.14g, 0.196 mole) and KOH (5.50g, 0.098 mole) i.e. in the ratio of (3:1) gave a yield of 95 %.<br>
EXAMPLE - 4<br>
Repeating the procedure in example 1 using K2CO3 (45.93 g, 0.33 mole) and KOH (6.21 g, 0.105 mole) gave a yield of 94 %.<br>
EXAMPLE -5<br>
In a three neck round bottom flask, equipped with mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser, dichloromethane (750 ml) was taken along with K2CO3 (32.14 g, 0.23 mole) and KOH (2.02g, 0.036 mole) and 2 g of triethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (2 gm) and stirred. To this was added (lOOg, 0.31 mole) levo (-) enriched clopidogrel and/or levo (-) clopidogrel. The reaction contents were refluxed for 5 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered through celite bed in a Buchner funnel to remove the solid bases. The solid was washed with dichloromethane (50 ml). The total filtrate was washed with saturated bicarbonate solution (2 X 150 ml), followed by 20 % brine (400 ml). The solvent was evaporated to obtain racemic clopidogrel (94g; 94 %) ([a]20 = 0, c=l in methanol).<br>
HPLC (BDS, C-18, 5 µm) RT = 18.4 min. 99.6 %.<br>
Example -6<br>
To the pooled aqueous washes of example 5, was added cone, hydrochloric acid 700 ml drop wise with stirring till the pH was about 4.2. The turbid solution was chilled to 0° C<br>
