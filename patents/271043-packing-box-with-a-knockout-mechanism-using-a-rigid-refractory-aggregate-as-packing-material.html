the<br><br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Field of invention: The present invention is related to the field of foundries used for producing metallic castings by shell molding process. More particularly, the present invention is related to the packing boxes and related knock out mechanism together with the packing material used in the said packing boxes.<br>
Prior art: Foundries are set up for manufacturing metallic castings. In present day foundries shell molding method is used for manufacturing the castings required for critical applications like castings required for the automobile industry. First the shell molds are prepared from refractory sand using a permanent pattern. These shells are then placed in the packing box or the molding box. Single or multiple number of shell moldings are placed in the referred packing box. Green sand of particular mesh size is then stuffed in the empty space between the shell molds and the packing box so as to support the shell molds during metal pouring operation. This sand is compacted either by ramming or vibrating the packing box to avoid cavities in the sand which could give rise to a partial unsupported portion of the shell mold causing its breakage during metal pouring and hence the rejection of the final casting. Even after this ramming or imparting vibration the cavities cannot be completely removed causing defects in the final castings. After the metal is poured for casting, some of the sand in the packing box is likely to burn, forming lumps of the sand which cause wastage of the sand as the recycling process involves pulverizing and hence prohibitively expensive. Further, automation of the process requires elaborate arrangements like pneumatic handling of the sand, vibration of the packing box in line. While in case of manually operated foundries material charging for the melting furnace, mold packing, ladle handling, and knockout is done manually causing reduced productivity. Due to attrition of the sand dust is generated and while handling. This dust spreads on the floor and also causes dusty atmosphere in the foundry. This necessitates additional equipment for removing the dust from atmosphere as well as from floor. The prior art packing boxes are made of one single box or two boxes placed one over the other called<br>
2<br><br>
the cope and drag. The cope and drag construction causes horizontal parting line and thus they are separated by lifting the drag box and then ejecting the molds from the boxes after pouring operation. Such type of packing boxes are either knocked out manually or if mechanized they need complex machinery to handle the operation.<br>
Object of present invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a packing box, which is opened<br>
from the bottom side with swiveling covers at the bottom facilitating a simple<br>
and efficient knock out operation.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to use rigid refractory aggregate (e.<br>
g. gravel) as a packing media facilitating the ejection during the knock out<br>
operation utilizing gravitational force and avoiding any punching or forcing out<br>
of the hot castings to avoid the damage.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple knock out<br>
mechanism cooperating with the referred packing box of the present invention.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is reducing the attrition of the<br>
packing material to a negligible level reducing dust level on the foundry floor as<br>
well as in the atmosphere effecting in a clean foundry.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to eliminate the vibration and<br>
ramming operation at the packing station.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to eliminate cavities in the<br>
packing box, which could occur and cause rejection due to breakage'of the molds<br>
in metal pouring process.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to allow easy escape of the gases<br>
formed in the mold during the casting process, which is not possible with the<br>
green sand.<br><br><br>
Summery of invention: The present invention endeavors to eliminate the drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
The present invention "Packing box together with knockout mechanism with rigid refractory aggregate as packing material" comprises of a packing box having rectangular cross section as viewed from top. Out of the four side walls two walls parallel to each other are provided with a convex curved profile at the bottom side in the plane of these walls. Two covers each covering approximately half of the bottom opening of the packing box are provided, both the covers having convex curved shape cooperating with that of the convex curved profile at the bottom side of the said walls. These covers are provided with support plates, which are pivotally mounted on the said side walls in such a way, that, the covers can be swiveled to open and closed position. Two gears are fixed to the said support plates one on each support plate, concentric with the pivots, so as to mesh each other. With this construction, when one cover is swiveled out or in, its swiveling motion is transferred to the other cover and the other cover also simultaneously swivels out or in with the movement of the first cover. An elongate member is fixed to one of the support plates with a circular member fixed to its end, so that the covers can be swiveled to open in knock out mechanism by applying turning moment by pushing this circular member downwards. Rigid refractory aggregate is used as the packing material in the present invention. This obviates the ramming operation while filling the packing box at the same time the punching out of the solidified castings at the knock out station is also not required. This is particularly due to free flowing nature of the said aggregate. The packing box filled with solidified castings and the packing material, moving on the ground track conveyor reaches the knock out mechanism for the knock out operation. The knock out mechanism comprises a frame structure with a raised horizontal frame. On the top of this frame a second frame is movably mounted in the horizontal plane. An actuating means is provided for moving the said second frame to forward end position and<br>
4<br><br>
backward end position. A third frame is mounted on the said second frame and is made to move in vertical direction by means of guides on the said second frame and an actuating means provided for the movement from top end position to bottom end position. Lifting means are provided at the bottom side of the third frame.<br>
As the packing box filled with solidified castings and packing material reaches the knock out mechanism the packing box is lifted by engaging the lifting means with the lifting supports on the packing box and moving the third frame to top end position. At this point the said second frame, which is in its backward end position, is moved to its forward end position. A vibratory hopper is provided underneath this position. An actuating means pivotally mounted on the third frame is extended, thus engaging with the circular member attached at the end of the said elongate member fixed to the support plate, and pushes the same further to swivel open the covers, provided at the bottom side of the packing box. The bottom of the packing box is thus fully opened and the solidified castings and the packing material fall down on the vibratory hopper positioned underneath. The castings are further moved for fettling while the packing material is recycled. It is possible in the case of the present invention to easily recycle the packing material as, there are no burnt lumps formed as they are formed in case when the green sand is used as a packing material as in the case of prior art. The ejection of castings and the packing material occurs by the gravitational force only and there is no need to punch out the castings embedded in the rammed green sand. After knocking out the castings and packing material the said second frame is moved to backward end position. The said third frame is then lowered to replace the packing box in the pallet on the ground track conveyor. The empty packing box is then moved to next position and a fresh packing box filled with the solidified castings and the packing material comes to the knock out mechanism for the knock out operation. The cycle is repeated for the next incoming packing boxes.<br>
5<br><br>
Position sensors are provided to sense the position of the pallet together with the packing box on the conveyor track, and end positions of all the actuating means. A sequence controller is provided to sense the positions of above elements and control the sequence of operation.<br>
It is seen here that, the use of the rigid refractory aggregate as packing material<br>
and the bottom swivel opening packing box has resulted in a simple reliable and<br>
practically maintenance free knock out mechanism.<br>

Description:<br>
The foregoing objects of the invention are accomplished and the problems and<br>
shortcomings associated with prior art techniques and approaches are overcome<br>
by the present invention as described bellow in the preferred embodiment.<br>
With reference to the above figures, the present invention "Packing box together<br>
with knockout mechanism with rigid refractory aggregate as packing material"<br>
comprises in combination thereof, a packing box (1) having rectangular cross<br>
section in its top view comprising four vertical walls. The walls  (1.1) form two<br>
opposite walls while the walls (1.2) form the remaining two walls of the said<br>
6<br><br>
rectangular shape. The said vertical walls (1.1) are stiffened by the stiffening means (1.3), and the said walls (1.2) are stiffened by the stiffening means (1.4). The said two opposite walls (1.2) are provided with a convex curved shape at the bottom side in the plane of the walls and two curved shaped covers (1.5) are provided cooperating with the convex curved shape at the bottom side of the said walls (1.2) so as to close the bottom side opening of the packing box (1). An overlapping plate (1.6) is fixed on one of the covers on its inner end so as to cover the gap between the said covers (1.5) in their closed position. Two support plates (1.7) are fixed to each of the two covers (1.5), both the support plates (1.7) have cooperating curvature with that of the covers (1.5) at the bottom end and fixed to the part of the covers (1.5) extending beyond the length of two parallel walls (1.1). The support plates are supported rotatably by two pivot means (1.8) near the top center on the walls (1.2) while two gears (1.9) are fixed on the support plates, concentric to the pivot means (1.8) so as to be in meshing contact with each other. This arrangement thus facilitating simultaneous opening of both the covers (1.5) as, when one of the cover (1.5) is swiveled about the pivot means (1.8), the swiveling motion of the first cover is transferred to other cover through the meshing gears (1.9). An elongate member (1.10) is fixed to one of the support plates (1.7) with a circular member (1.11) attached to its free end so that the actuator can engage with the same for opening the bottom of the said packing box (1) for ejection of the packing material and the castings. The inner edges of the support plates (1.7) are so shaped that they do not touch each other while the cover is in the closed position so as to ensure complete closure of the covers. The outer edges of the said support plates (1.7) are provided with a relief so as to avoid fouling with the top edge of the packing box (1) while in fully open position of the covers. Four support members (1.12) are provided on the bottom covers so that the packing box can rest in the pallet (4.1) and it can be moved along the tracks (4.2) through the foundry plant for other operations. Four lifting supports (1.13) are provided on said walls (1.1). The said lifting supports (1.13)<br>
7<br><br>
are provided with cooperating profiles on their lower ends to engage with the projections (4.4) provided on the lifting means (4.3) so as to facilitate lifting of the packing box by lifting means (4.3). A cover (1.14) is provided so as to protect the gears (1.9) from dust.<br>
A knock out mechanism comprises a structural frame (6.1) having a horizontal frame (6.2) raised from ground to maintain the lifting level for knock out. A second frame (6.3) is movably mounted on the top frame (6.2). An actuating means of which the stationary member (6.41) is fixed to the top frame (6.2) while the moving/actuating member (6.42) is fixed to the movable frame (6.3) so that the movable frame (6.3) can be moved forward and backward on the support frame (6.2) in the horizontal plane. The movable frame (6.3) has two end positions, the forward end position, and the backward end position. A third frame (6.5) is mounted on the second frame (6.3); the third frame (6.5) being enabled to move in vertical direction by means of the guides in the second frame (6.5) and an actuating means (6.6) provided for its movement. The stationary member (6.61) of the actuating means (6.6) is fixed to the second frame (6.3) while the movable/actuating member (6.62) is fixed to the third frame (6.5). The actuating means (6.6) thus moves the third frame to two end positions, the top end position, and the bottom end position. The said lifting means (4.3) is fixed at the bottom of the third frame (6.5). The lifting means (4.3) is provided with the projections (4.4) so as to engage with the lifting supports (1.13) on the packing box (1) to facilitate lifting of the same. An actuating means (6.7) is pivotally attached to the third frame (6.5). The movable member of the actuating means (6.7) is provided at its end a cooperating profile (6.8) to engage with the circular member (1.11) during the knock out operation. A vibratory hopper (6.8) is positioned underneath the forward end position of the second frame (6.3) so that the castings and the packing material ejected during knock out operation fall on it. Position sensors (not shown in the drawings) are provided to sense the position of the pallet (4.1) together with the packing box (1) on the conveyor<br><br><br>
track, and end positions of the actuating means (6.4), (6.6) and (6.7). A sequence controller (not shown in the drawings) is provided to sense.the positions of above elements and control the sequence of operation.<br>
The packing box (1) as it comes to the said knock out mechanism is filled with solidified castings in the molds (5.1) and the packing material (5.2). The packing material used is rigid refractory aggregate (e. g. gravel, ceramic aggregate or the like). The preferred size of the packing material is 5 to 25 mm. The operation of the knock out mechanism is as given bellow.<br>
a.	At the start of the operating cycle, the actuating means (6.4) is in retracted<br>
position and the actuating means (6.6) is in extended position. Thus the<br>
second frame (6.3) is in its backward end position and the third frame (6.5)<br>
is in its bottom end position. In this position the lower end of the lifting<br>
means (4.4) is aligned with the tracks (4.2). As the pallet together with the<br>
packing box (1) resting on it, is moved along the track; the pallet is<br>
stopped in such a position so as to align the projections (4.4) of the lifting<br>
means (4.3) with the lifting supports (1.13) provided on the packing box<br>
(1). The projections (4.4) are positioned underneath the lifting supports<br>
(1.13) so as to allow horizontal movement of the packing box without<br>
hindrance.<br>
b.	The actuating means (6.6) is then retracted so that the projections (4.4) on<br>
the lifting means engage with the lifting supports (1.13) and then whole<br>
packing box (1) together with the solidified castings (5.1) and the packing<br>
material (5.2) filled in it is lifted to the top end position.<br>
c.	The actuating means (6.4) is then extended and the second frame (6.3)<br>
together with the third frame (6.5) in its top end position is moved to the<br>
forward end position of the second frame (6.3). The packing box (1) in this<br>
position is aligned with the vibratory hopper underneath.<br><br><br>
d.	At this position the actuating means for knock out (6.7) extends. Bottom<br>
end of the movable member of the actuating means having cooperating<br>
profile (6.8) with that of the-circular member (1.11) on the packing box<br>
engages with the circular member (1.11) and pushes it downwards, thus<br>
applying opening force (turning moment) on the bottom cover (1.5)<br>
through the elongate member (1.10) and the support plates (1.7).<br>
e.	As one of the covers (1.5) is applied with the opening force (turning<br>
moment), it is transferred to the second cover (1.5) through the pair of<br>
meshing gears (1.9) causing both the covers to swivel away from the<br>
bottom of the packing box (1) thus opening the bottom completely.<br>
f.	As rigid refractory aggregate is used as packing material, the solidified<br>
castings and the packing material fall down by gravity, without any need<br>
of application of force, on the vibratory hopper (6.8), which is positioned<br>
underneath this position of the mechanism. The packing material and the<br>
castings are then separated and moved for further process of fettling of<br>
the castings and recycling of the packing material.<br>
g.	The actuating means (6.7) is then retracted thus releasing the covers (1.5),<br>
which swivel down to the closed position by gravity on account of their<br>
own weight. The actuating means (6.4) is retracted pulling the frame (6.3)<br>
to its backward end position. The actuating means (6.6) is then extended<br>
and the lifting means lowered, so as to restore the closed empty packing<br>
box (1) on the pallet from which it was lifted and releasing the packing<br>
box (1) completely as the lifting means is further lowered to its bottom<br>
end position creating a gap between the lifting supports (1.13) and the<br>
projections (4.4).<br>
h. The empty packing box (1) is then moved away on. the track conveyor (4.2) and replaced by next packing box filled with solidified castings (5.1)<br><br><br>
and packing material (5.2), aligned with the lifting means (4.3), ready for knock out operation to repeat the sequence.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the actuating means (6.4), (6.6) and (6.7) are pneumatic cylinders operated by compressed air.<br>
In alternative embodiment, the actuating means (6.4), (6.6) and (6.7) is hydraulic cylinders operated by hydraulic power pack.<br>
In another alternative embodiment, the actuating means (6.4), (6.6) and (6.7) is electro mechanical actuators.<br>

member of the actuating means (6.7) being provided at its end a cooperating profile (6.8) to engage with the circular member (1.11) during the knock out operation; a vibratory hopper (6.8) being positioned underneath theforward end position of the second frame (6.3) so that the castings and the packing material ejected during knock out operation fall on it; position sensors being provided to sense the position of the pallet (4.1) together with the packing box (1) on the conveyor track, and end positions of the actuating means (6.4), (6.6) and (6.7); a sequence controller (not shown in the drawings) being provided to sense the positions of above elements and control the sequence of operation;<br>
C. the packing box (1) as it comes to the said knock out mechanism being filled with solidified castings in the molds (5.1) and the packing material (5.2); the packing material used being rigid refractory aggregate (e. g. gravel, ceramic aggregate or the like); the operation of the knock out mechanism being as given bellow;<br>
a.	at the start of the operating cycle, the actuating means (6.4) being in<br>
retracted position and the actuating means (6.6) being in extended<br>
position; thus the second frame (6.3) being in its backward end position<br>
and the third frame (6.5) being in its bottom end position; in this position<br>
the lower end of the lifting means (4.4) being aligned with the tracks (4.2);<br>
as the pallet together with the packing box (1) resting on it, is being<br>
moved along the track, the pallet being stopped in such a position so as to<br>
align the projections (4.4) of the lifting means (4.3) with the lifting<br>
supports (1.13) provided on the packing box (1) but, the projections (4.4)<br>
positioned underneath them allowing horizontal movement of the<br>
packing box without hindrance;<br>
b.	the actuating means (6.6) is then being retracted so that the projections<br>
(4.4) on the lifting means engage with the lifting supports (1.13) and then<br><br><br>
whole packing box (1) together with the solidified castings (5.1) and the packing material (5.2) filled in it is being lifted to the top end position;<br>
c.	the actuating means (6.4) then being extended and the second frame (6.3)<br>
together with the third frame (6.5) in its top end position, is being moved<br>
to the forward end position of the second frame (6.3); the packing box (1)<br>
in this position being aligned with the vibratory hopper underneath;<br>
d.	at this position the actuating means for knock out (6.7) being extended,<br>
bottom end of the movable member of the actuating means having<br>
cooperating profile (6.8) with that of the circular member (1.11) on the<br>
packing box engaging with the circular member (1.11) and pushing it<br>
downwards, thus applying opening force (turning moment) on the bottom<br>
cover (1.5) through the elongate member (1.10) and the support plates<br>
(1-7);<br>
e.	as one of the covers (1.5) is being applied with the opening force (turning<br>
moment), it is being transferred to the second cover (1.5) through the pair<br>
of meshing gears (1.9) causing both the covers to swivel away from the<br>
bottom of the packing box (1) thus opening the bottom completely;<br>
f.	as rigid refractory aggregate is being used as packing material, the<br>
solidified castings and the packing material fall down by gravity, without<br>
any need of application of force, on the vibratory hopper (6.8) which is<br>
being positioned underneath this position of the mechanism; the packing<br>
material and the castings then being separated and moved for further<br>
process of fettling of the castings and recycling of the packing material;<br>
g.	the actuating means (6.7) then being retracted thus releasing the covers<br>
(1.5) which swivel down to the closed position by gravity on account of<br>
their own weight; the actuating means (6.4) being retracted pulling the<br>
frame (6.3) to its backward end position; the actuating means (6.6) then<br><br><br>
being extended so as to restore the closed empty packing box (1) on the pallet from which it was lifted and releasing the packing box (1) completely as the lifting means is further lowered to its bottom end position creating a gap between the lifting supports (1.13) and the projections (4.4);<br>
h. in this condition the empty packing box (1) is being moved away on the track conveyor (4.2) and being replaced by next packing box filled with solidified castings (5.1) and packing material (5.2), aligned with the lifting means (4.3), ready for knock out operation to repeat the sequence.<br>
