				<td>Heterocyclylamide-substituted imidazoles<br>
The invention relates to heterocyclylamide-substituted imidazoles and methods for<br>
their preparation, their use for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases as well as<br>
their use for the production of medicaments for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of<br>
diseases, in particular for use as antiviral agents, especially against cytomegaloviruses.<br>
WO 99/23091 describes aromatic heterocyclic compounds as antiinflammatory<br>
agents which, inter alia, may also be suitable for the treatment of viral infections. .<br>
Structurally different" agents having antiviral activity are available on the market;<br>
however, the therapies currently available with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet<br>
and cidofovir are associated with severe side effects, for example nephrotoxicity,<br>
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. In addition, it is always possible for resistance to<br>
develop. Novel agents for an effective therapy are therefore desirable.<br><br>
One object of the present invention is therefore to provide novel compounds having<br>
the same or improved antiviral activity for the treatment of viral infectious diseases<br>
in humans and animals.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the substituted imidazoles described in the<br>
present invention have high antiviral activity.<br>

Synthesis scheme 2:<br><br>
The compounds of general formula (I) of the invention show an unforeseeable,<br>
surprising spectrum of activity. They have antiviral activity on representatives of the<br>
group of Herpes viridae (herpes viruses), especially on cytomegaloviruses (CMV), in<br>
particular on the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). They are thus suitable for the<br>
treatment and prophylaxis of diseases, especially infections with viruses, in particular<br>
the viruses mentioned above, and the infectious diseases caused thereby. Hereinafter,<br>
a viral infection is to be understood as meaning both an infection with a virus and a<br>
disease caused by an infection with a virus.<br>
Due to their particular properties, the compounds of general formula (I) can be used<br>
for the production of medicaments suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of<br>
diseases, in particular viral infections.<br>
Areas of indication which may be mentioned by way of example are:<br><br>
1)	Treatment and prophylaxis of HCMV infections in AIDS patients (retinitis,<br>
pneumonitis, gastrointestinal infections).<br>
2)	Treatment and prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus infections in bone-marrow and<br>
organ transplant patients who develop often life-threatening HCMV pneu-<br>
monitis or encephalitis, and gastrointestinal and systemic HCMV infections.<br>
3)	Treatment and prophylaxis of HCMV infections in neonates and infants.<br>
4)	Treatment of an acute HCMV infection in pregnant women.<br>
5)	Treatment of an HCMV infection in immunosuppressed patients associated<br>
with cancer and cancer therapy.<br>
6)	Treatment of HCMV-positive cancer patients with the aim of reducing HCMV-<br>
mediated tumor progression (cf. J. Cinatl, et al., FEMS Microbiology Reviews<br>
2004, 28, 59-77).<br>
The compounds of the invention are preferably used for the production of medica-<br>
ments suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of infections with a representa-<br>
tive of the group of Herpes viridae, in particular a cytomegalovirus, especially the<br>
human cytomegalovirus.<br>
Due to their pharmacological properties, the compounds of the invention can be<br>
used alone and, if required, also in combination with other active compounds, in<br>
particular antiviral active compounds, such as, for example, gancyclovir or acyclovir,<br>
for the treatment and/or prevention of viral infections, in particular HCMV infec-<br>
tions.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to the use of the compounds of the inven-<br>
tion for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases, preferably of viral infections, in<br><br>
particular of infections with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) or another repre-<br>
sentative of the group of Herpes viridae.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to the use of the compounds of the inven-<br>
tion for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases, in particular the diseases<br>
mentioned above.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to the use of the compounds of the inven-<br>
tion for the production of a medicament for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of<br>
diseases, in particular the diseases mentioned above.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to a method for the treatment and/or<br>
prophylaxis of diseases, in particular the diseases mentioned above, using an antivi-<br>
rally effective amount of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention can act systemically and/or locally. For this pur-<br>
pose, they can be administered in a suitable way, such as, for example, orally, par-<br>
enterally, pulmonarily, nasally, sublingually, lingually, buccally, rectally, dermally,<br>
transdermally, conjunctivally or otically, or as an implant or stent.<br>
For these administration routes, it is possible to administer the compounds of the<br>
invention in suitable administration forms.<br>
Suitable for oral administration are administration forms which function according<br>
to the prior art and release the compounds of the invention rapidly and/or in modi-<br>
fied form, and which comprise the compounds of the invention in crystalline and/or<br>
amorphicized and/or dissolved form, such as, for example, tablets (uncoated and<br>
coated tablets, for example having enteric coatings or coatings which dissolve with a<br>
delay or which are insoluble and which control the release of the compound of the<br>
invention), tablets or films/wafers, which disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity,<br><br>
films/lyophilisates, capsules (for example hard or soft gelatin capsules), sugar-coated<br>
tablets, granules, pellets, powders, emulsions, suspensions, aerosols or solutions.<br>
Parenteral administration can take place with avoidance of an absorption step (for<br>
example intravenously, intraarterially, intracardially, intraspinally or intralumbally)<br>
or with inclusion of an absorption (for example intramuscularly, subcutaneously,<br>
intracutaneously, percutaneously or intraperitonealy). Administration forms suitable<br>
for parenteral administration are, inter alia, preparations for injection and infusion in<br>
the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lyophilisates or sterile powders.<br>
Examples suitable for the other administration routes are pharmaceutical forms for<br>
inhalation (inter alia powder inhalers, nebulizers), nasal drops, solutions, sprays;<br>
tablets, films/wafers or capsules, to be administered lingually, sublingually or buc-<br>
cally, suppositories, preparations for ears or eyes, vaginal capsules, aqueous suspen-<br>
sions (lotions, shaking, mixtures), lipophilic suspensions, ointments, creams, trans-<br>
dermal therapeutic systems, milk, pastes, foams, dusting powders, implants or stents.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be converted into the stated administration<br>
forms. This can take place in a manner known per se by mixing with inert nontoxic,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. These excipients include, inter alia, carriers<br>
(for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, mannitol), solvents (for example<br>
liquid polyethylene glycols), emulsifiers and dispersants or wetting agents (for<br>
example sodium dodecyl sulfate, polyoxysorbitan oleate), binders (for example<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone), synthetic and natural polymers (for example albumin),<br>
stabilizers (for example antioxidants, such as, for example, ascorbic acid), colors (for<br>
example inorganic pigments, such as, for example, iron oxides) and taste- and/or<br>
odor-corrigents.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to medicaments comprising at least one<br>
compound of the invention, usually together with one or more inert nontoxic,<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and their use for the purposes mentioned<br>
above.<br>
In general, it has proved advantageous to administer on intravenous administration<br>
amounts of about 0.001 to 10 mg/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, of body<br>
weight to achieve effective results, and the dosage on oral administration is about<br>
.0.01 to 25 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, of body weight.<br>
It may nevertheless be necessary, where appropriate, to deviate from the amounts<br>
mentioned, specifically depending on body weight, administration route, individual<br>
response to the active compound, type of preparation and time or interval over<br>
which the administration takes place. Thus, in some cases it may be sufficient to<br>
make do with less than the aforementioned minimum amount, whereas in other<br>
cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the event of an administration<br>
of larger amounts, it may be advisable to divide these into a plurality of individual<br>
doses over the day.<br>
The percentage data in the following tests and examples are percentages by weight<br>
unless otherwise indicated; parts are parts by weight. Solvent ratios, dilution ratios<br>
and concentration data of liquid/liquid solutions are in each case based on volume.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

B. Assessment of the physiological activity	<br>
The in vitro activity of the compounds of the invention can be shown in the following assays:<br>
Anti-HCMV (anti-human cytomegalovirus) cytopathogenicity tests<br>
The test compounds are employed as 50 millimolar (mM) solutions in dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide (DMSO). Ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir are used as reference compounds. After the addition of in each case 2 µl of the 50, 5, 0.5 and 0.05 mM !<br>
DMSO stock solutions to 98 µl portions of cell culture medium in row 2 A-H for duplicate determinations, 1:2 dilutions are carried out with 50 µl portions of medium<br>
UP to row 11 of the 96-well plate. The wells in rows 1 and 12 each contain 50 µl of<br>
medium. Then 150 µl of a suspension of 1 X 104 cells (human prepuce fibroblasts<br>
[NHDF]) are pipetted into each of the wells (row 1 = cell control) and, in rows 2-12, a<br>
mixture of HCMV-infected and uninfected NHDF cells (M.O.I. = 0.001 - 0.002), i.e. 1-<br>
2 infected cells per 1000 uninfected cells. Row 12 (without substance) serves as virus<br>
control. The final test concentrations are 250-0.0005 µM. The plates are incubated at<br>
37°C/5% CO2 for 6 days, i.e. until all the cells in the virus controls are infected (100%<br>
cytopathogenic effect [CPE]). The wells are then fixed and stained by adding a<br>
mixture of formalin and Giemsa's dye (30 minutes), washed with double-distilled<br>
water and dried in a drying oven at 500C. The plates are then assessed visually using<br>
an overhead microscope (Plaque Multiplier from Technomara).<br>
The following data can be acquired from the test plates:<br>
CC50(NHDF) = maximum substance concentration in µM at which no visible cytostatic<br>
effects on the cells are evident by comparison with the untreated cell control;<br>
EC50 (HCMV) = substance concentration in nM which inhibits the CPE (cytopathic<br>
effect) by 50% compared with the untreated virus control;<br><br>
SI (selectivity index) = CC50 (NHDF) / EC50(HCMV).<br>
Representative in vitro activity data of the compounds of the invention are shown in<br>
Table A:	<br>

  I<br>
The suitability of the compounds of the invention for the treatment of HCMV infections<br>
can be shown in the following animal model:<br>
HCMV Xenograft Gelfoam® model<br>
Animals:<br>
3-4 week old female immunodeficient mice (16-18 g), Fox Chase SCID or Fox Chase<br>
SCID-NOD or SCID beige, are purchased from commercial breeders (bomholtgaard,<br>
Jackson). The animals are kept under sterile conditions (including bedding and feed)<br>
in isolators.<br><br>
Virus growing:<br>
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Davis strain, is grown in vitro on human embry-<br>
onic prepuce fibroblasts (NHDF cells). After the NHDF cells have been infected with a<br>
multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) of 0.01, the virus-infected cells are harvested 5-7<br>
days later and stored in the presence of minimal essential medium (MEM), 10%<br>
foetal calf serum (FCS) with 10% DMSO at -40°C. After serial ten-fold dilutions of the<br>
virus-infected cells, the titre is determined on 24-well plates of confluent NHDF cells<br>
after vital staining with Neutral Red, or fixing and staining with a formalin/Giemsa<br>
mixture (as described above).<br>
Preparation of the sponges, transplantation, treatment and evaluation:<br>
Collagen sponges l x l x l cm in size (Gelfoam®; Peasel &amp; Lorey, order No. 407534;<br>
K.T. Chong et al., Abstracts of 39th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents<br>
and Chemotherapy, 1999, p. 439; P.M. Kraemer et al., Cancer Research 1983, (43):<br>
4822-4827) are initially wetted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the trapped air<br>
bubbles are removed by degassing, and then stored in MEM + 10% FCS. 1 x 106 virus-<br>
infected NHDF cells (infection with HCMV Davis M.O.I. = 0.01) are detached 3 hours<br>
after the infection and added dropwise in 20 µl of MEM, 10% of FCS, onto a moist<br>
sponge. After 12-13 hours 5 ng/µl basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in 25 µl of<br>
PBS /0.1% BSA/1 mM DTT are optionally added to the sponges and the sponges are<br>
incubated for 1 hour. For the transplantation, the immunodeficient mice are anaes-<br>
thetized with avertin or a mixture of azepromazine-xylazine and ketamine, the fur on<br>
the back is removed using a dry shaver, the epidermis is opened 1-2 cm, unstressed<br>
and the moist sponges are transplanted under the dorsal skin. The surgical wound is<br>
closed with tissue glue. 24 hours after the transplantation, the mice are treated with<br>
substance perorally three times a day (7.00 h and 14.00 h and 19.00 h), two times a<br>
day (8.00 h and 17.00 h) or once a day (14.00 h) over a period of 8 days. The dose is<br>
3 or 10 or 30 or 100 mg/kg of body weight, the volume administered is 1.0 ml/kg of<br>
body weight. The substances are formulated in the form of a 0.5% Tylose suspension,<br><br>
optionally containing 2% DMSO. 9 days after the transplantation and 16 hours after<br>
the last administration of substance, the animals are painlessly sacrificed and the<br>
sponge is removed. The virus-infected cells are released from the sponge by colla-<br>
genase digestion (330 U/1.5 ml) and stored in the presence of MEM, 10% foetal calf<br>
serum, 10% DMSO at -140°C. Evaluation takes place after serial ten-fold dilutions of<br>
the virus-infected cells by determining the titre on 24-well plates of confluent NHDF<br>
cells after vital staining with Neutral Red or after fixing and staining with a forma-<br>
lin/Giemsa mixture (as described above). The number of infectious virus particles<br>
after the substance treatment compared with the placebo-treated control group is<br>
determined.<br><br>
