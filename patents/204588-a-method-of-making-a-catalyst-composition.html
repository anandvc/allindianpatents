The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
WO 00/02931	PCT/US99/14214<br>

A CATALYST COMPOSITION AND METHODS FOR ITS PREPARATION AND USE IN A POLYMERIZATION PROCESS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
5	The present invention relates to a catalyst composition and methods for<br>
preparing the catalyst composition and for its use in a process for polymerizing olefins. In particular, the invention is directed to a method for preparing a catalyst composition of a bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system and/or a conventional-type transition metal catalyst system, and a carboxylate metal<br>
10     salt.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Advances in polymerization and catalysis have resulted in the capability to produce many new polymers having improved physical and chemical properties useful in a wide variety of superior products and<br>
15      applications. With the development of new catalysts the choice of polymerization-type (solution, slurry, high pressure or gas phase) for producing a particular polymer has been greatly expanded. Also, advances in polymerization technology have provided more efficient, highly productive and economically enhanced processes. Especially illustrative of these<br>
20      advances is the development of technology utilizing bulky ligand metalloceue-type catalyst systems. Regardless of these technological advances in the polyolefin industry, common problems, as well as new challenges associated with process operability still exist. For example, the tendency for a gas phase or slurry phase process to foul and/or sheet remains a challenge.<br>
25	For example, in a continuous slurry process fouling on the walls of the<br>
reactor, which act as a heat transfer surface, can result in many operability problems. Poor heat transfer during polymenzation can result in polymer particles adhering to the walls of the reactor. These polymer particles can continue to polymerize on the walls and can result in a premature reactor<br>
30      shutdown. Also, depending on the reactor conditions, some of the polymer<br>
may dissolve in the reactor diluent and redeposit on for example the metal heat exchanger surfaces.<br>
In a typical continuous gas phase process, a recycle system is employed for many reasons including the removal of heat generated in the process by the<br>
35      polymerization. Fouling, sheeting and/or static generation in a continuous gas phase process can lead to the ineffective operation of various reactor systems.<br><br>
WO 00/02931	PCT/US99/14214<br>
-2 -<br>
For example, the cooling mechanism of the recycle system, the temperature probes utilized for process control and the distributor plate, if affected, can lead to an early reactor shutdown.<br>
Evidence of, and solutions to, various process operability problems 5      have been addressed by many in the art. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,792,592, 4,803,251, 4,855,370 and 5,391,657 all discuss techniques for reducing static generation in a polymerization process by introducing to the process for example, water, alcohols, ketones, and/or inorganic chemical additives; PCT publication WO 97/14721 published April 24, 1997 discusses<br>
10     the suppression of fines that can cause sheeting by adding an inert hydrocarbon to the reactor; U.S. Patent No. 5,627,243 discusses a new type of distributor plate for use in fluidized bed gas phase reactors; PCT publication WO 96/08520 discusses avoiding the introduction of a scavenger into the reactor; U.S. Patent No. 5,461,123 discusses using sound waves to reduce sheeting;<br>

30      conventional Ziegler-Natta titanium catalyst with an antistat to produce ultrahigh molecular weight ethylene polymers; U.S. Patent No. 3,082,198 discusses introducing an amount of a carboxylic acid dependent on the quantity of water in a process for polymerizing ethylene using a titanium/aluminum organometallic catalysts in a hydrocarbon liquid medium;<br>
35      and U.S. Patent No. 3,919,185 describes a slurry process using a nonpolar hydrocarbon diluent using a conventional Ziegler-Natta-type or Phillips-type<br><br>

catalyst and a polyvalent metal salt of an organic acid having a molecular weight of at least 300.<br>
There are various other known methods for improving operability including coating the polymerization equipment, for example, treating the 5      walls of a reactor using chromium compounds as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,532,311 and 4,876,320; injecting various agents into the process, for example PCX Publication WO 97/46599 published December 11, 1997 discusses feeding into a lean zone in a polymerization reactor an unsupported, soluble metallocene-type catalyst system and injecting antifoulants or<br>
10     antistatic agents into the reactor; controlling the polymerization rate, particularly on start-up; and reconfiguring the reactor design.<br>
Others in the art to improve process operability have discussed modifying the catalyst system by preparing the catalyst system in different ways. For example, methods in the art include combining the catalyst system<br>
15     components in a particular order; manipulating the ratio of the various catalyst system components; varying the contact time and/or temperature when combining the components of a catalyst system; or simply adding various compounds to the catalyst system. These techniques or combinations thereof are discussed in the literature. Especially illustrative in the art is the<br>
20     preparation procedures and methods for producing bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst systems, more particularly supported bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst systems with reduced tendencies for fouling and better operability. Examples of these include: WO 96/11961 published April 26, 1996 discusses as a component of a supported catalyst system an antistatic<br>
25      agent for reducing fouling and sheeting in a gas, slurry or liquid pool<br>

While all these possible solutions might reduce the level of fouling or sheeting somewhat, some are expensive to employ and/or may not reduce<br>
10     fouling and sheeting to a level sufficient to successfully operate a continuous process, particularly a commercial or large-scale process.<br>
Thus, it would be advantageous to have a polymerization process capable of operating continuously with enhanced reactor operability and at the same time produce new and improved polymers. It would also be highly<br>
15     beneficial to have a continuously operating polymerization process having more stable catalyst productivities, reduced fouling/sheeting tendencies and increased duration of operation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Introduction<br>
The invention is directed toward a method for making a catalyst composition and to the catalyst composition itself. The invention also relates 5      to a polymerization process having improved operability and product<br>
capabilities using the catalyst composition. It has been suprisingly discovered that using a carboxylate metal salt in combination with a catalyst system results in a substantially improved polymerization process. Particularly surprising is where the catalyst system is supported on carrier, more so where<br>
10 the catalyst system includes a bulky Iigand metallocene-type catalyst system, and even more so where the bulky Iigand metallocene-type catalysts are very active and/or are highly incorporating of comonomer.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that these bulky Iigand metallocene-type catalysts are more prone to sheeting and/or<br>
15      fouling. It is believed that the very high activity catalysts can result in the generation of extreme heat local to the growing polymer particle. It is theorized that these extreme conditions lead to increased levels of sheeting and/or fouling. Also hypothesized is that the polymers produced by bulky Iigand metallocene-type catalysts form very tough polymer sheets. Thus, it is<br>
20      difficult to break up and remove any of these sheets thai may form in the reactor.<br>
Furthermore, it was very unexpected that fractional melt index and higher density polymers could be produced in a polymerization process using the polymerization catalyst and carboxylate metal salt combination with<br>
25      improved operability. This discovery was especially important in that it is<br>
well known in the polymer industry that, from a process operability standpoint, these types of polymers are difficult to produce.<br>
Utilizing the polymerization catalysts described below in combination with a carboxylate metal salt results in a substantial improvement in process<br>
30     operability, a significant reduction in sheeting and fouling, improved catalyst performance, better polymer particle morphology with no adverse effect on the physical polymer properties, and the capability to produce a broader range of polymers<br><br>

10     combination thereof.<br>
There are various other methods in the art for supporting a polymerization catalyst compound or catalyst system of the invention. For example, the bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst compound of the invention may contain a polymer bound ligand as described in U.S. Patent<br>
15     Nos. 5,473,202 and 5,770,755, which is herein fully incorporated by reference; the bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system of the invention may be spray dried as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,648,310, which is herein fully incorporated by reference; the support used with the bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system of the invention is functionalized as described in<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides for a supported bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system that includes a surface modifier<br>
25      that is used in the preparation of the supported catalyst system, as described in PCT publication WO 96/11960 which is herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>

In this preferred method, the bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst compound is slurried in a liquid to form a<br>
35      metallocene solution and a separate solution is formed containing an activator and a liquid. The liquid may be any compatible solvent or other liquid capable<br><br>
WO 00/02931	PCT7US9n42t4<br>
-24-<br>
of forming a solution or the like with the bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst compounds and/or activator of the invention. In the most preferred embodiment the liquid is a cyclic aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, most preferably toluene. The bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst compound and 5      activator solutions are mixed together and added to a porous support or the porous support is added to the solutions such that the total volume of the bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst compound solution and the activator solution or the bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst compound and activator solution is less than five times the pore volume of the porous support, more preferably<br>

Procedures for measuring the total pore volume of a porous support are well known in the art. Details of one of these procedures is discussed in<br>
15      Volume 1, Experimental Methods in Catalytic Research (Academic Press, 1968) (specifically see pages 67-96). This preferred procedure involves the use of a classical BET apparatus for nitrogen absorption. Another method well known in the art is described in mnes, Total Porosity and Particle Density of Fluid Catalysts By Liquid Titration, Vol. 28, No. 3, Analytical Chemistry 332-<br>
20      334 (March, 1956).<br>
The mole ratio of the metal of the activator component to the metal of the bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst compounds are in the range of between 0.3:1 to 2000:1, preferably 20:1 to 800:1, and most preferably 50:1 to 500:1. Where the activator is an ionizing activator such as those based on the<br>
25      anion tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boron, the mole ratio of the metal of the<br>
activator component to the metal component of the catalyst is preferably in the range of between 0.3:1 to 31.<br>

A prepolymerized catalyst system for purposes of this patent 5      specification and appended claim is a supported catalyst system. Carboxvlate Metal Salt<br>
Carboxylate metal salts are well known in the art as additives for use with polyolefins, for example as a film processing aid. These types of post reactor processing additives are commonly used as emulsifying agents, antistat<br>
10     and antifogging agents, stabilizers, foaming aids, lubrication aids, mold release agents, nucleating agents, and slip and antiblock agents and the like. Thus, it was truly unexpected that these post reactor agents or aids would be useful with a polymerization catalyst to improve the operability of a polymerization process.<br>
15	For the purposes of this patent specification and appended claims the<br>
term "carboxylate metal salt" is any mono- or di- or tri-carboxylic acid salt with a metal portion from the Periodic Table of Elements. Non-limiting examples include saturated, unsaturated, aliphatic, aromatic or saturated cyclic carboxylic acid salts where the carboxylate ligand has preferably from 2 to 24<br>
10     carbon atoms, such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, pivalate,<br>
caproate, isobuytlacetate, t-butyl-acetate, caprylate, heptanate, pelargonate, undecanoate, oleate, octoate, palmitate, myristate, margarate, stearate, arachate and tercosanoate.

25      Sr, Sn, Ti, V, Ba, Zn, Cd, Hg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, Li and Na.<br>
In one embodiment, the carboxylate metal salt is represented by the following general formula:<br>

WO 00/02931	PCT7US99/I42I4<br>
-26-<br>
above formula y is an integer from 1 to 3, preferably 1 to 2, especially where M is a Group 13 metal.<br>
Non-limiting examples of R in the above formula include hydrocarbyl radicals having 2 to 100 carbon atoms that include alkyl, aryl, aromatic, 5      aliphatic, cyclic, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbyl radicals. In an<br>
embodiment of the invention, R is a hydrocarbyl radical having greater than or equal to 8 carbon atoms, preferably greater than or equal to 12 carbon atoms and more preferably greater than or equal to 17 carbon atoms. In another embodiment R is a hydrocarbyl radical having from 17 to 90 carbon atoms,<br>
10     preferably 17 to 72, and most preferably from 17 to 54 carbon atoms.<br>

15      atoms. The hydrocarbon containing group may be linear, branched, or even substituted. Also, Q in one embodiment is an inorganic group such as a halide, sulfate or phosphate.<br>
In one embodiment, the more preferred carboxylate metal salts are those aluminum carboxylates such as aluminum mono, di- and tri- stearates,<br>
20     aluminum octnaies, oleates and cyciohexylbutyrates. In yet a more preferred embodiment, the carboxylate metal salt is (CH3(CH2),6COO),AI, a aluminum tri-stearate (preferred melting point 115 °C), (CH^CH^^COOJ^-AI-OH, a aluminum di-stearate (preferred melting point 145 °C), and a CH3(CH,)16COO-Al(OH)2, an aluminum mono-stearate (preferred melting point 155 °C).<br>
25	Non-limiting commercially ayailable carboxylate metal salts for<br>
example include Witco Aluminum Stearate # 18, Witco Aluminum Stearate U 22, Witco Aluminum Stearate U 132 and Witco Aluminum Stearate EA Food Grade, all of which are available from Witco Corporation, Memphis, Tennessee.<br>

The carboxylate metal salt in one embodiment may be combined with antistatic agents such as fatty amines, for example, Kemamine AS 990/2 zinc additive, a blend of ethoxylated stearyl amine and zinc stearate, or Kemamine AS 990/3, a blend of ethoxylated stearyl amine, zinc stearate and octadecyl-10     3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate. Both these blends are available from Witco Corporation, Memphis, Tennessee. Method of Preparing the Catalyst Composition<br>
The method for making the catalyst composition generally involves the combining, contacting, blending, and/or mixing of a catalyst system or 15     polymerization catalyst with a carboxylate metal salt.<br>
In one embodiment of the method of the invention, a conventional-type transition metal catalyst and/or a bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst is combined, contacted, blended, and/or mixed with at least one carboxylate metal salt. In a most preferred embodiment, the conventional-type transition 20      metal catalyst and/oi the bulky ligand nietallocene-type catalyst are supported on a carrier.<br>
In another embodiment, the steps of the method of the invention include forming a polymerization catalyst, preferably forming a supported polymerization catalyst, and contacting the polymerization catalyst with at 25      least one carboxylate metal salt. In a preferred method, the polymerization catalyst comprises a catalyst compound, an activator or cocatalyst and a carrier, preferably the polymerization catalyst is a supported bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst.<br>
One in the art recognizes that depending on the catalyst system and the 30      carboxylate metal salt used certain conditions of temperature and pressure<br>
would be required to prevent, for example, a loss in the activity of the catalyst system.<br>
In one embodiment of the method of the invention the carboxylate metal salt is contacted with the catalyst system, preferably a supported catalyst 35      system, most preferably a supported bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system under ambient temperatures and pressures. Preferably the contact<br><br>
WO 00/02931	PCT/US99/14214<br>
-28-<br>
temperature for combining the polymerization catalyst and the carboxylate<br>
metal salt is in the range of from 0 °C to about 100 °C, more preferably from<br>
15 °C to about 75 °C, most preferably at about ambient temperature and<br>
pressure.<br>
5	In a preferred embodiment, the contacting of the polymerization<br>
catalyst and the carboxylate metal salt is performed under an inert gaseous atmosphere, such as nitrogen. However, it is contemplated that the combination of the polymerization catalyst and the carboxylate metal salt may be performed in the presence of olefin(s), solvents, hydrogen and the like.<br>
10	In one embodiment, the carboxylate metal salt may be added at any<br>
stage during the preparation of the polymerization catalyst.<br>
In one embodiment of the method of the invention, the polymerization catalyst and the carboxylate metal salt are combined in the presence of a liquid, for example the liquid may be a mineral oil, toluene, hexane, isobutane<br>
15      or a mixture thereof. In a more preferred method the carboxylate metal salt is combined with a polymerization catalyst that has been formed in a liquid, preferably in a slurry, or combined with a substantially dry or dried, polymerization catalyst that has been placed in a liquid and reslurried.<br>
In an embodiment, the contact time for the carboxylate metal salt and<br>
20      the polymerization catalyst may vary depending on one or more of the conditions, temperature and pressure, the type of mixing apparatus, the quantities of the components to be combined, and even the mechanism for introducing the polymerization catalyst/carboxylate metal salt combination into the reactor.<br>
25	Preferably, the polymerization catalyst, preferably a bulky ligand<br>
metallocene-type catalyst compound and a carrier, is contacted with a carboxylate metal salt for a period of time from about a second to about 24 hours, preferably from about 1 minute to about 12 hours, more preferably from about 10 minutes to about 10 hours, and most preferably from about 30<br>
30      minutes to about 8 hours.<br>
In an embodiment, the ratio of the weight of the carboxylate metal salt to the weight of the transition metal of the catalyst compound is in the range of from about 0.01 to about 1000, preferably in the range of from 1 to about 100, more preferably in the range of from about 2 to about 50, and most preferably<br>
35      in the range of from 4 to about 20.  In one embodiment, the ratio of the weight of the carboxylate metal salt to the weight of the transition metal of the catalyst<br><br>
WO 00/0293 J	PCTAJS99/14214<br>
-29-<br>
compound is in the range of from about 2 to about 20, more preferably in the range of from about 2 to about 12, and most preferably in the range of from 4 to about 10.<br>
In another embodiment of the method of the invention, the weight 5      percent of the carboxylate metal salt based on the total weight of the<br>
polymerization catalyst is in the range of from about 0.5 weight percent to about 500 weight percent, preferably in the range of from 1 weight percent to about 25 weight percent, more preferably in the range of from about 2 weight percent to about 12 weight percent, and most preferably in the range of from<br>
10     about 2 weight percent to about 10 weight percent. In another embodiment, the weight percent of the carboxylate metal salt based on the total weight of the polymerization catalyst is in the range of from 1 to about 50 weight percent, preferably in the range of from 2 weight percent to about 30 weight percent, and most preferably in the range of from about 2 weight percent to<br>
15     about 20 weight percent.<br>
In one embodiment, where the process of the invention is producing a polymer product having a density greater than 0.910 g/cc, the total weight percent of the carboxylate metal salt based on the total weight of the polymerization catalyst is greater than 1 weight percent. In yet another<br>
20      embodiment, where the process of the invention is producing a polymer<br>
product having a density less than 0.910 g/cc, the total weight percent of the carboxylate metal salt based on the total weight of the polymerization catalyst is greater than 3 weight percent. If the polymerization catalyst includes a carrier, the total weight of the polymerization catalyst includes the weight of<br>
25      the carrier.<br>
It is believed that the more metal of the activator, for example total aluminum content or free aluminum content (the alkyi aluminum content in alumoxane), present in the polymerization catalyst, the more carboxylate metal salt is required. Manipulating the amounts or loadings of the polymerization<br>
30      catalyst components, i.e the free aluminum may provide a means for adjusting the level of carboxylate metal salt.<br>
Mixing techniques and equipment contemplated for use in the method of the invention are well known. Mixing techniques may involve any mechanical mixing means, for example shaking, stirring, tumbling, and<br>
35      rolling. Another technique contemplated involves the use of fluidization, for example in a fluid bed reactor vessel where circulated gases provide the<br><br>

mixing. Non-limiting examples of mixing equipment for combining, in the most preferred embodiment a solid polymerization catalyst and a solid carboxylate metal salt, include a ribbon blender, a static mixer, a double cone blender, a drum tumbler, a drum roller, a dehydrator, a fluidized bed, a helical 5     mixer and a conical screw mixer.<br>
In an embodiment of the method of the invention, a supported conventional-type transition metal catalyst, preferably a supported bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst, is tumbled with a carboxylate metal salt for a period of time such that a substantial portion of the supported catalyst is<br>
10     intimately mixed and/or substantially contacted with the carboxylate metal salt.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the catalyst system of the invention is supported on a carrier, preferably the supported catalyst system is substantially dried, preformed, substantially dry and/or free flowing. In an<br>
15     especially preferred method of the invention, the preformed supported catalyst system is contacted with at least one carboxylate metal salt. The carboxylate metal salt may be in solution or slurry or in a dry state, preferably the carboxylate metal salt is in a substantially dry or dried state. In the most preferred embodiment, the carboxylate metal salt is contacted with a supported<br>
20     catalyst system, preferably a supported bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system in a rotary mixer under a nitrogen atmosphere, most preferably the mixer is a tumble mixer, or in a fluidized bed mixing process, in which the polymerization catalyst and the carboxylate metal salt are in a solid state, that is they are both substantially in a dry state or in a dried state.<br>
25	In an embodiment of the method of the invention a conventional-type<br>
transition metal catalyst compound, preferably a bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst compound, is contacted with a carrier to form a supported catalyst compound. In this method, an activator or a cocatalyst for the catalyst compound is contacted with a separate carrier to form a supported activator or<br>
30     supported cocatalyst. It is contemplated in this particular embodiment of the invention, that a carboxylate metal salt is then mixed with the supported catalyst compound or the supported activator or cocatalyst, in any order, separately mixed, simultaneously mixed, or mixed with only one of the supported catalyst, or preferably the supported activator prior to mixing the<br>
35      separately supported catalyst and activator or cocatalyst.<br><br>

As a result of using the combination of polymerization catalyst/ carboxylate metal salt of the invention it may be necessary to improve the overall catalyst flow into the reactor. Despite the fact that the catalyst flow is not as good as a catalyst without the carboxylate metal salt, the flowability of 5     the catalyst/carboxylate combination of the invention was not a problem. If catalyst flow needs improvement, it is well known in the art to use bin vibrators, or catalyst feeder brushes and feeder pressure purges and the like.<br>
In another embodiment, the polymerization catalyst/carboxylate metal salt may be contacted with a liquid, such as mineral oil and introduced to a<br>
10     polymerization process in a slurry state. In this particular embodiment, it is preferred that the polymerization catalyst is a supported polymerization catalyst.<br>
In some polymerization processes smaller particle size support materials are preferred. However, the operability of these processes is more<br>
15     challenging. It has been discovered that utilizing the polymerization catalyst and carboxylate metal salt combination of the invention, smaller particle size support materials may be used successfully. For example, silica having an average particle size from about 10 microns to 80 microns. Silica materials of this size are available from Crosfield Limited, Warrington, England, for<br>
20     example Crosfield ES-70 having an average particle size of 35 to 40 microns Not wishing to bound by any theory, it is traditionally believed that using smaller average particle size supports produces more fines and results in a more sheeting prone supported catalyst. It is also believed that the use of a carboxylate metal salt with the polymerization catalyst provides for better<br>
25      particle growth during polymerization. This better particle morphology is believed to result in fewer fines and a reduced tendency for sheeting to occur. Thus, the use of a carboxylate metal salt allows for the use of a smaller support material.<br>
In an embodiment, the method of the invention provides for co-<br>
30      injecting an unsupported polymerization catalyst and a carboxylate metal salt into the reactor. In one embodiment the polymerization catalyst is used in an unsupported form, preferably in a liquid form such as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,317,036 and 5,693,727 and European publication EP-A-0 593 083, all of which are herein incorporated by reference. The polymerization catalyst in<br>
35      liquid form can be fed with a carboxylate metal salt to a reactor using the<br><br>

injection methods described in PCT publication WO 97/46599, which is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Where a carboxylate metal salt and an unsupported bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system combination is utilized, the mole ratio of the 5     metal of the activator component to the metal of the bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst compound is in the range of between 0.3:1 to 10,000:1, preferably 100:1 to 5000:1, and most preferably 500:1 to 2000:1. Polymerization Process<br>
The catalysts and catalyst systems of the invention described above are<br>
10 suitable for use in any polymerization process. Polymerization processes include solution, gas phase, slurry phase and a high pressure process or a combination thereof. Particularly preferred is a gas phase or slurry phase polymerization of one or more olefins at least one of which is ethylene or propylene.<br>
15	In one embodiment, the process of this invention is directed toward a<br>
solution, slurry or gas phase polymerization process of one or more olefin monomers having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 2 tol2 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The invention is particularly well suited to the polymerization of two or more olefin monomers of ethylene,<br>
20     propylene, butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, hexene-1, octene-1 and decene-1.<br>
Other monomers useful in the process of the invention include ethylenically unsaturated monomers, diolefins having 4 to 18 carbon atoms, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, vinyl monomers and cyclic<br>
25     olefins. Non-limiting monomers useful in the invention may include<br>
norbornene, norbomadiene, isobutylene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, styrenes, alkyl substituted styrene, ethylidene norbornene, isoprene, dicyciopentadiene and cyclopentene.<br>
In the most preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, a<br>
30     copolymer of ethylene is produced, where with ethylene, a comonomer having at least one alpha-olefin having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, and most preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, is polymerized in a gas phase process.<br>
In another embodiment of the process of the invention, ethylene or<br>
35      propylene is polymerized with at least two different comonomers, optionally one of which may be a diene, to form a terpolymer.<br><br>
WO 00/02931	PCT/US99/142I4<br>
-33-<br>
In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a process, particularly a gas phase or slurry phase process, for polymerizing propylene alone or with one or more other monomers including ethylene, and olefins having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms. Polypropylene polymers may be produced using particularly 5     bridged bulky ligand metallocene-type catalysts as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,296,434 and 5,278,264, both of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas<br>
10     stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat is removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously<br>
15     cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670,<br>
20     5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304, 5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661 and 5,668,228 all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.)<br>
The reactor pressure in a gas phase process may vary from about 100 psig (690 kPa) to about 500 psig (3448 kPa), preferably in the range of from about 200 psig (1379 kPa) to about 400 psig (2759 kPa), more preferably in<br>
25     the range of from about 250 psig (1724 kPa) to about 350 psig (2414 kPa).<br>
The reactor temperature in the gas phase process may vary from about 30°C to about 120°C, preferably from about 60°C to about 115°C, more preferably in the range of from about 70°C to 110°C, and most preferably in the range of from about 70°C to about 95°C.<br>
30	Other gas phase processes contemplated by the process of the invention<br>
include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,627,242, 5,665,818 and 5,677,375, and European publications EP-A- 0 794 200, EP-A- 0 802 202, EP-A2 0 891 990 and EP-B- 634 421 all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
35	In a preferred embodiment, the reactor utilized in the present invention<br>
is capable and the process of the invention is producing greater than 500 lbs of<br><br>
WO 00/02931	PCT/US99/I4214<br>
-34-<br>
polymer per hour (227 Kg/hr) to about 200,000 lbs/hr (90,900 Kg/hr) or higher of polymer, preferably greater than 1000 lbs/hr (455 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 10,000 lbs/hr (4540 Kg/hr), even more preferably greater than 25,000 lbs/hr (11,300 Kg/hr), still more preferably greater than 35,000 lbs/hr 5      (15,900 Kg/hr), still even more preferably greater than 50,000 lbs/hr (22,700 Kg/hr) and most preferably greater than 65,000 lbs/hr (29,000 Kg/hr) to greater than 100,000 lbs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from about 1 to about 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in<br>
10     the range of 0°C to about 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from<br>
15     the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical<br>
20      temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.<br>
A preferred polymerization technique of the invention is referred to as a particle form polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution. Such<br>
25      technique is well known in the art, and described in for instance U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179 which is fully incorporated herein by reference. Other slurry processes include those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes.<br>
30      Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,613,484, which is herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
In an embodiment the reactor used in the slurry process of the invention is capable of and the process of the invention is producing greater than 2000 lbs of polymer per hour (907 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than<br>
35      5000 lbs/hr (2268 Kg/hr), and most preferably greater than 10,000 lbs/hr (4540 Kg/hr). In another embodiment the slurry reactor used in the process of the<br><br>
WO 00/02931	PCT/US99/142I4<br>
-35-<br>
invention is producing greater than 15,000 lbs of polymer per hour (6804 Kg/hr), preferably greater than 25,000 Ibs/hr (11,340 Kg/hr) to about 100,000 lbs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
Examples of solution processes are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5     4,271,060, 5,001,205, 5,236,998 and 5,589,555, which are fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A preferred process of the invention is where the process, preferably a slurry or gas phase process is operated in the presence of a bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system and in the absence of or essentially free of<br>
10     any scavengers, such as triethylaluminum, trimethylaluminum, tri-<br>
isobutylaluminum and tri-n-hexylaluminum and diethyl aluminum chloride, dibutyl zinc and the like. This preferred process is described in PCT publication WO 96/08520 and U.S. Patent No. 5,712,352 and 5,763,543 which are herein fully incorporated by reference. However, it has been discovered<br>
15     that a polymerization process utihzing the catalyst system/carboxylate metal salt combination of the invention may be operated with a small amount of scavenger with reduced or no effect on process operability and catalyst performance. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides a process for polymerizing olefin(s) in a reactor in the presence of a bulky ligand<br>
20     metallocene-type catalyst system, a carboxylate metal salt and a scavenger. In one embodiment, the polymerization catalyst and/or catalyst composition, the polymerization catalyst and the carboxylate metal salt have a productivity greater than 1500 grams of polymer per gram of catalyst, preferably greater than 2000 grams of polymer per gram of catalyst, more<br>
25     preferably greater than 2500 grams of polymer per gram of catalyst and most preferably greater than 3000 grams of polymer per gram of catalyst.<br>
In another embodiment, the polymerization catalyst and/or catalyst composition, the polymerization catalyst and the carboxylate metal salt, have a productivity greater than 2000 grams of polymer per gram of catalyst,<br>
30     preferably greater than 3000 grams of polymer per gram of catalyst, more preferably greater than 4000 grams of polymer per gram of catalyst and most preferably greater than 5000 grams of polymer per gram of catalyst.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymerization catalyst and/or the catalyst composition has a reactivity ratio generally less than 2, more typically less<br>
35      than 1. Reactivity ratio is defined to be the mole ratio of comonomer to<br>
monomer entering the reactor, for example as measured in the gas composition<br><br>
WO 00/02931	PCT/US99/1421
-36-<br>
in a gas phase process, divided by the mole ratio of the comonomer to monomer in the polymer product being produced. In a preferred embodiment, the reactivity ratio is less than 0.6, more preferably less than 0.4, and most preferably less than 0.3. In the most preferred embodiment, the monomer is 5     ethylene and the comonomer is an olefin having 3 or more carbon atoms, more preferably an alpha-olefin having 4 or more carbon atoms, and most preferably an alpha-olefin selected from the group consisting of butene-1,4-methyl-pentene-1, pentene-1, hexene-1 and octene-1.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, when transitioning from a first<br>
10     polymerization catalyst to a second polymerization catalyst, preferably where the first and second polymerization catalysts are bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst compound, more preferably where the second polymerization catalyst is a bridged, bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst compound, it would be preferable during the transition to use a catalyst composition of a carboxylate<br>
15     metal salt combined with a bridged, bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst. When starting up a polymerization process, especially a gas phase process, there is a higher tendency for operability problems to occur. Thus, it is contemplated in the present invention that a polymerization catalyst and carboxylate metal salt mixture is used on start-up to reduce or eliminate start-<br>
20     up problems. Furthermore, it also contemplated that once the reactor is<br>
operating in a stable state, a transition to the same or a different polymerization catalyst without the carboxylate metal salt can be made.<br>
In another embodiment, during a polymerization process that is or is about to be disrupted, a polymerization catalyst/carboxylate metal salt mixture<br>
25     of the invention could be transitioned to. This switching of polymerization catalysts is contemplated to occur when operability problems arise. Indications of operability problems are well known in the art. Some of which in a gas phase process include temperature excursions in the reactor, unexpected pressure changes, excessive static generation or unusually high<br>
30     static spikes, chunking, sheeting and the like. In an embodiment, the<br>
carboxylate metal salt may be added directly to the reactor, particularly when operability problems arise.<br>
It has also been discovered that using the polymerization catalyst combined with a carboxylate metal salt of the invention it is easier to produce<br>
35      fractional melt index and higher density polymers. In one embodiment, the invention provides for a process for polymerizing olefin(s) in a reactor in the<br><br>

presence of a polymerization catalyst in combination with a carboxylate metal salt to produce a polymer product having a melt index less than about 1 dg/min and a density greater than 0.920 g/cc, more preferably the polymer product has a melt index less than about 0.75 dg/min and a density greater than 0.925 g/cc. 5     Preferably the polymerization catalyst is a bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst, more preferably the process is a gas phase process and the polymerization catalyst includes a carrier.<br>
It is contemplated that using the combination polymerization catalyst/ carboxylate metal salt of the invention, transitioning to one of the more<br>
10     difficult grades of polymers would be simpler. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention is directed to a process for polymerizing olefin(s) in the presence of a first catalyst composition, under steady "state conditions, preferably gas phase process conditions, to produce a first polymer product. The first polymer product having a density greater than 0.87 g/cc, preferably greater than 0.900<br>
15     g/cc, more preferably greater than 0.910 g/cc, and a melt index in the range of from 1 dg/min to about 200 dg/min, preferably in the range of greater than 1 dg/min to about 100 dg/min, more preferably from greater than \ dg/min to about 50 dg/min, most preferably from greater than 1 dg/min to about 20 dg/min. This process further comprises the step of transitioning to a second<br>
20     catalyst composition to produce second polymer product having a density greater than 0.920 g/cc, preferably greater than 0.925 g/cc, and a melt index less than I dg/min, preferably less than 0.75 dg/min. The second catalyst composition comprising, in combination, a conventional-type transition metal catalyst and/or a bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst, and a carboxylate<br>
25     metal salt. It is also within the scope of this particular embodiment to<br>
transition from a first polymer product having an I21/I2 (described below) of less than 25 to a second polymer product having an I2I/I2 greater than 25, preferably greater than 30, and even more preferably greater than 35.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the process of the invention involves<br>
30     alternating between a first catalyst composition comprising a first polymerization catalyst/carboxylate metal salt mixture and a catalyst composition of a second polymerization catalyst without a carboxylate metal salt to improve the overall process operability. In a further embodiment, the first and second catalyst compositions described above can be used<br>
35      simultaneously, for example as a mixture or injected into a reactor separately.<br><br>

In order to provide a better understanding of the present invention including representative advantages thereof, the following examples are offered.<br><br>

The properties of the polymer were determined by the following test methods:<br>
Density is measured in accordance with ASTM-D-1238. The Fouling Index in the Tables below illustrates operability of the 5     catalyst. The higher the value the greater the fouling observed. A Fouling Index of zero means substantially no or no visible fouling. A Fouling Index of 1 is indicative of light fouling, where a very light partial coating of polymer on the stirrer blades of a 2 liter slurry isobutane polymerization reactor and/or no reactor body sheeting. A Fouling Index of 2 is indicative of more than light<br>
10     fouling, where the stirrer blades have a heavier, painted-like, coating of polymer and/or the reactor body wall has some sheeting in a band of 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 cm) wide on the reactor wall. A Fouling Index of 3 is considered medium fouling, where the stirrer blade has a thicker, latex-like, coating of polymer on the stirrer blade, some soft chunks in the reactor, and/or<br>
15      some reactor body sheeting with a band of 2 to 3 inch (5.08 to 7.62 cm) wide on the reactor wall. A Fouling Index of 4 is evidence of more than medium fouling, where the stirrer has a thick, latex-like, coating, some harder chunks/balls of polymer, and/or the reactor body wall sheeting band is from 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.2 cm) wide.<br>

lbs (209 kg) of sparged and dried toluene is added to an agitated reactor after which 1060 lbs (482 kg) of a 30 weight percent methylaluminoxane (MAO) in toluene (available from Albemarle, Baton Rouge, Louisiana) is added. 947 lbs (430 kg) of a 2 weight percent toluene solution of a dimethylsilyl-5     bis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium dichloride catalyst compound and 600 lbs (272 kg) of additional toluene are introduced into the reactor.

available from W.R. Grace, Davison Chemical Division, Baltimore, Maryland) was added to the liquid with slow agitation. Stirring speed was increased for approximately 10 minutes to insure dispersion of the silica into the liquid and then appropriate amount of toluene was added to make up a slurry of liquid to<br>
15     solid having a consistency of 4 cc/g of silica. Mixing was continued for 15 minutes at 120 rpm after which 6 g of Kemamine AS-990 (available Witco Corporation, Memphis, Tennessee) was dissolved in 100 cc of toluene and was added and stirred for 15 minutes. Drying was then initiated by vacuum and some nitrogen purge at \15bV (79.4°C). When the polymerization catalyst<br>
20     comprising the carrier, silica, appeared to be free flowing, it was cooled down<br>
and discharged into a nitrogen purged vessel. An approximate yield of 1 Kg of<br>
dry polymerization catalyst was obtained due to some loses due to drying.<br>

The catalyst solution contained in the flask was then added slowly to<br>

Examples 7 and 8 illustrate the use of different carboxylate metal salts. Specifically in Examples 7 and 8, the metal of the stearate, Ca and Zn, are shown to be effective in reducing fouling. Examples 9,10 and 11 illustrate<br>
10     several types of carboxylate aluminum salts, specifically that different forms of aluminum stearate are effective. From the data in Table 4 it can be seen that mono-stearates and di-stearates are most effective. Examples 12 through 15<br>

The results are given in Table 5 below. Of particular interest, these<br>

Examples 16, 17 and 18 and Comparative Example 4 illustrate the effectiveness of the use of a carboxyiate metal salt, particularly aluminum stearate, in a fluid bed gas phase process in combination with a bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system to produce grades of polymer that are<br>
20     typically more difficult to produce especially in terms of operability.<br>
Traditionally, fractional melt index and higher density grades are difficult to make from a reactor operability standpoint. The polymerization catalyst used in the polymerizations of Examples 16, 17 and 18 and Comparative Example 4 were run in the process described below and the results of which are indicated<br>
25      in Table 6 below.<br>
Polymerization Process<br>
The Catalysts A, B and F described above were then separately tested 30      in a continuous gas phase fluidized bed reactor which comprised a nominal 18 inch, schedule 60 reactor having an internal diameter of 16.5 inches. (41.9 cm)<br><br>

The fluidized bed is made up of polymer granules. The gaseous feed streams of ethylene and hydrogen together with liquid comonomer were mixed together in a mixing tee arrangement and introduced below the reactor bed into the recycle gas line. Hexene-1 was used as the comonomer. The individual 5      flow rates of ethylene, hydrogen and comonomer were controlled to maintain fixed composition targets. The ethylene concentration was controlled to maintain a constant ethylene partial pressure. The hydrogen was controlled to maintain constant hydrogen to ethylene mole ratio. The concentration of all the gases were measured by an on-line gas chromatograph to ensure relatively<br>
10     constant composition in the recycle gas stream. The solid supported bulky<br>
ligand metallocene-type catalyst system listed in Table 6, was injected directly into the fluidized bed using purified nitrogen at 1.5 Ibs/hr (0.68 kg/hr). The reacting bed of growing polymer particles was maintained in a fluidized state by the continuous flow of the make up feed and recycle gas through the<br>
15     reaction zone. A superficial gas velocity of 1 to 3 ft/sec (30.5 cm/sec to 91.4 cm/sec) was used to achieve this. The reactor was operated at a total pressure of 300 psig (2069 kPa), a reactor temperature of 85 °C and a superficial gas velocity of 2.25 ft/sec (68.6 cm/sec) was used to achieve fluidization of the granules. To maintain a constant reactor temperature, the temperature of the<br>
20     recycle gas is continuously adjusted up or down to accommodate any changes in the rate of heat generation due to the polymerization. The fluidized bed was maintained at a constant height by withdrawing a portion of the bed at a rate equal to the rate of formation of particulate product. The product is removed semi-continuously via a series of valves into a fixed volume chamber, which is<br>
25     simultaneously vented back to the reactor. This allows for highly efficient removal of the product, while at the same time recycling a large portion of the unreacted gases back to the reactor. This product is purged to remove entrained hydrocarbons and treated with a small stream of humidified nitrogen to deactivate any trace quantities of residual catalyst.<br><br>

By using carboxylate metal salts in combination with the 5     polymerization catalysts, reactor operability improves tremendously. Table 6 illustrates a gas phase reactor operating without any problems in producing fractional melt index polymers for many bed turnovers (BTO). Specifically shown is that using a polymerization catalyst without the carboxylate metal salt, as in Comparative Example 4 (without aluminum stearate), the reactor<br>
10     was shut down due to fouling and sheeting in less than 3 bed turnovers at around a melt index of 1.5 dg/min and a density of 0.9188 g/cc In an embodiment of the invention the process is operating for a period greater than 4 bed turnovers, more preferably greater than 5 bed turnovers and most preferably greater than 6 bed turnovers. A bed turnover is when the total<br>
15     weight of the polymer discharged from the reactor is approximately equal or equal to the bed weight in the reactor.<br>
It is known in the art that reducing resin bulk density can improve operability of a polymerization process, particularly a gas phase fluidized bed polymerization process. Note from Table 6 that the resin bulky density did not<br>
20     change much, however, the operability of the process of the invention was surprisingly, substantially improved, when a carboxylate metal salt is combined with the polymerization catalyst. Example 19<br>
Preparation of a Conventional-Type Transition Metal Catalyst<br>
25	A conventional-type transition metal catalyst was prepared from a<br>
mixture of generally a magnesium compound, for example MgCI2, a titanium compound, for example TiC^l/SAlCl, and an electron donor, for example tetrahydrofuran (THF), and was supported on silica that was dehydrated at<br><br>
WO 00/02931	PCT/US99/142I4<br>
-50-<br>
600°C. A detailed description of the preparation procedure can be found in U.S. Patent No. 4,710,538, which is herein incorporated by reference. The specific catalyst formulation used had a TNHAL/THF mole ratio of 29 and a DEAC/THF mole ratio of 26 where TNHAL is tri-n-hexyl aluminum and 5      DEAC is diethyl aluminum chloride.<br>
Polymerization Process using the Conventional-Type Transition Metal Catalyst<br>
The dry, free flowing catalyst, described above, was injected into a continuous gas phase fluid bed reactor which comprised a nominal 18-inch<br>
10     (45.7cm), schedule 60 reactor, having an internal diameter of 16.5 inches (41.9cm), as described previously in this patent specification. The same process and conditions as previously described were used. However, in this process, a 5 weight percent triethylaluminum (TEAL), a conventional-type cocatalyst, solution in hexane was continuously added to the reactor to<br>
15      maintain a TEAL concentration in the fluid bed of approximately 300 ppm. Also, the solid conventional-type transition metal catalyst prepared as described directly above was injected directly into the fluidized bed, see Table 7, Run A.<br>
A solution of a carboxylate metal salt, Witco Aluminum Stearate #22<br>
20     (AlSt #22) in hexane (2000 ppm) was prepared. During the polymerization process, see Table 7, Run A, the solution was pumped into the gas phase reactor, see the results in Table 7, Run B. The catalyst productivity by material balance remained virtually the same even after the addition of aluminum stearate. Moreover, in this example, operability of the reactor<br>
25     remained stable and continued for more than 4 bed turnovers before the run was voluntarily terminated.<br><br>

5     The above example illustrates that the using a carboxylate metal salt in conjunction with a conventional-type transition metal catalyst system the operability in a continuous gas phase polymerization process does not deteriorate, particularly where the carboxylate metal salt is introduced separately from the conventional-type catalyst system. However, in some<br>
10     batch polymerization slurry runs it was found that using Witco Aluminum Stearate EA grade dry blended with a conventional-type titanium metal catalyst resulted in a reduction in productivity. Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the reduction in productivity may be partly due to the aluminum stearate reacting with the conventional-type cocatalyst,<br>
15     triethylaluminum for example, resulting in less active cocatalyst in the batch reactor.<br>
Examples 20 and 21 below illustrate the use of a conventional-type chromium metal catalyst dry blended with a carboxylate metal salt.<br>
20     Example 20<br>
Preparation of a Conventional-Type Chromium Metal Catalyst<br>
A conventional-type chromium metal catalyst, also known as a Phillips-Type catalyst, was prepared using Crosfiefd EP510 catalyst (I wt% Titanium and 0.5 wt% Chromium- from chromium acetylacetonate) available 25      from Crosfield Limited, Warrington, England. The EP 510 catalyst was<br>
activated at 800°C with 70% oxygen/30% nitrogen in a fluidized bed column as is known in the art and was used in the following polymerization process.<br><br>

Comparative Example 20A Homopolvmerization Process of Ethylene<br>
lOOu mole of triethylaluminum (25 weight percent TEAL solution in heptane) was added to a 2.2 liter autoclave reactor as a scavenger to remove 5     trace impurities in the vessel. Polymerization grade isobutane 800 ml<br>
available from Phillips Petroleum, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, was added to the reactor. The contents were stirred at 1000 rpm and the reactor temperature was raised from ambient to 93°C and then ethylene was introduced to the reactor until the total reactor pressure was 375 psig (2586 kPag).<br>
10	300 mg of the activated chromium catalyst prepared above in Example<br>
20 was then charged to the reactor and ethylene polymerization proceeded for about 60 minutes at which point the reaction was terminated by venting hydrocarbons from the reactor. In this Comparative Example 20A the chromium catalyst as described above was used neat (without aluminum<br>
15     stearate) and resulted in a highly charged, staticky, polymer. A hexane<br>
solution of antistatic agent Kemamine AS-990 had to be used to remove the staticky polymer from reactor walls. The total resin collected was about 245 grams. Example 20B<br>
20	In this example, the polymerization catalyst included 300 mg of<br>
activated chromium catalyst (prepared as described above in Example 20) dry-blended with 15 mg of aluminum stearate, Witco Aluminum Stearate EA grade, prior to the polymerization. The polymerization catalyst was then charged to the reactor under the same polymerization conditions as described<br>
25     above in Comparative Example 20A. After about 60 minutes, the<br>
polymerization was stopped and the reactor was inspected. The resin produced was not staticky and the polymer was easily removed from the reactor. The resin yield was 133 grams. This run demonstrated that a carboxylate metal salt, an aluminum stearate compound, either prevents or neutralizing the<br>
30     charges on the resin made with a conventional-type chromium metal catalyst system. It is a general belief that the reactor-sheeting phenomenon in gas phase ethylene polymerization using chromium catalyst is related to the static charge in the system.<br><br>

50 u mole of triethylaluminum was added to the reactor as a scavenger to remove trace impurities in the vessel. Thereafter, 50 ml of purified hexene-5      I comonomer and 800 ml of isobutane were added to the reactor. After raising the reactor temperature to 85°C under 1000 rpm stirring, ethylene was introduced into the vessel until the pressure reached 325 psig (2586 kPag). Then, 300 mg of a polymerization catalyst was charged into the reactor and the polymerization process proceeded for a period of time. The reaction was then<br>

20     clumped in the bottom of the reactor. The total amount of the sticky resin collected was 53 grams. Example 21B<br>
In this example, 300 mg of the activated chromium catalyst prepared above in Example 20 was dry-mixed with 15 mg of aluminum stearate, Witco<br>
25     Aluminum Stearate EA grade. The polymerization process used was as described above in Example 21. After 50 minutes the run was stopped by venting-off the hydrocarbons. It was found that the reactor fouling was much lighter than in Comparative Example 21 A. Only a light polymer coating was visible on the stirrer, thermal couple and reactor wall. The total amount of<br>
30     resin collected was about 110 grams. Comparative Example 21C<br>
This Comparative Example 21C followed the same polymerization process described in Example 21 except 35 ml hexene-1 was used. 300 mg of the activated chromium catalyst as described above in Example 21 was used<br>
35      neat, without any aluminum stearate. The polymerization proceeded for 50<br>
minutes, and the reactor was then vented and inspected. Severe reactor fouling<br><br>

was observed. A ring of polymer about 3 inches (7.62 cm) wide was formed on the top of the reactor with a thickness ranging from 1/4 to 3/4 of an inch (0.64 to 1.91 of a cm). At the bottom of the reactor wall a polymer sheet was found. The total amount of resin collected was about 139 grams. The polymer 5      was too clumped to determine the polymer density. Example 21D<br>
This Example 21D followed the same polymerization process described in Example 21 except 35 ml hexene-1 was used. 300mg of the same activated chromium catalyst used in Comparative Example 21C was dry mixed<br>
10     with 15 mg aluminum stearate, Witco Aluminum Stearate EA grade. The<br>
polymerization proceeded for 50 minutes, and the reactor was then vented and inspected. A very minor polymer coating was found on the stirrer, thermal couple and reactor wall. The polymer yield was 139 gram and had a density of 0.9282 g/cc.<br>
15	In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a continuous process<br>
for polymerizing ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms in the presence of a polymerization catalyst comprising a conventional-type chromium metal catalyst and a carboxylate metal salt to produce a polymer product having a density less than 0.945 g/cc down to about<br>
20     0.910 g/cc, preferably less than 0.940 g/cc, more preferably less than 0.93 g/cc, even more preferably less than 0.928 g/cc, and most preferably less than 0.92 g/cc. In a preferred embodiment the continuous process is a gas phase process operating at a pressure of from 200 psig (1379Kpa) to about 400 psig (2759 kPa) and at a temperature above 60°C, preferably 70°C, to about I20°C,<br>
25      preferably the gas phase process is also operating in a condensed mode where a liquid and a gas are introduced to a fluidized bed reactor having a fluidizing medium and where the level of condensed is greater than 8 weight percent, preferably greater than 10 weight percent and most preferably greater than 12 weight percent up to 50 weight percent based on the total weight of the<br>
30      fluidizing medium entering the reactor. For further details of a condensed<br>
mode process see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,342,749 and 5,436,304 both of which are herein fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
While the present invention has been described and illustrated by reference to particular embodiments, those of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
35      appreciate that the invention lends itself to variations not necessarily illustrated herein. For example, it is contemplated that a carboxylate metal salt can be<br><br>
WO 00/02931<br><br>
PCT/US99/I42I4<br><br>
-55-<br>
added to reactor in addition to being contacted with the catalyst system of the invention. It is also contemplated that the process of the invention may be used in a series reactor polymerization process. For example, a supported bulky ligand metal locene-type catalyst system free of a carboxylate metal salt 5      is used in one reactor and a supported, bridged, bulky ligand metal locene-type catalyst system having been contacted with a carboxylate metal salt being used in another or vice-versa. It is even further contemplated that the components of a carboxylate metal salt, a carboxylic acid and metal compound, for example a metal hydroxy compound, may be added to the reactor or the<br>
10     polymerization catalyst to form in situ the reactor or with the catalyst. It is<br>
also contemplated that a carboxylate metal salt may be separately supported on a carrier different from the polymerization catalyst, preferably a supported polymerization catalyst. For this reason, then, reference should be made solely to the appended claims for purposes of determining the true scope of the<br>
