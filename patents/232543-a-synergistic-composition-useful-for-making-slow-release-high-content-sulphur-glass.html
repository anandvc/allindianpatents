				<td>The present invention relates to a synergistic composition useful for making slow release high content sulphur glass The process of the present invention provides a high content sulphur glass capable of slow release of sulphur which particularly relates to the application of the £lass as fertiliser for agricultural applications and for any other plant which requires sulphur as one of the constituents of their elemental combinations. The material may have applications in such other fields where controlled release of sulphur is required such as fungicide, pesticide, weedicide and for purposes other than agriculture.<br>
The present day method of making sulphate glasses essentially consists of fusing KHSO4 or the mixtures of K2SO4 and ZnSO4, K2SO4 , ZnSO4 and NaPO3; ZnSO4 , KPO,, and NaPO3; K2SO4, Na2SO4, K2SO4 and NaPO3; Na2SO4, ZnSO4 and NaPO3 The reference for which may be made to, T. Portland and W. A. Weyl, "Formation of Sulfate Glass" J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 33 186-187 (1950); P. S. L. Narasimham and K. J. Rao, "Phase Diagram and Glass Formation in the K2SO4-ZnSO4 System", J. Non-Cryst. Solids, 27, 225-246 (1978); V. L. Mamoshin, V. G. Arkhipov, P. I. Bular, L. V. Ivanova and O. J. Pupkova, "Glass Formation in the System R2SO4(RHSO4)-ZnSp4-NaPO3(P2O5), R=Li, Na, K, Fiz.

The main drawbacks of the above processes are:<br>
1.	Release of sulphur in the leached solution is high.<br>
2.	The glass contains alkali like Na-O, Li2O which are harmful to the plants and increases<br>
alkalinity of the soil which hinders absorption of other nutrients by the plants.<br><br>
3. The glass contains high percentage of ZnO which is toxic to the plants<br>
The main object of the present invention is to formulate a synergistic composition useful<br>
for making slow release high content sulphur glass which does not contain alkali like<br>
Na2O, Li2O and ZnO.<br>
Another object is to provide a process of making slow release high content sulphate glass<br>
which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to increase the sulphur content of the<br>
prepared glass.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to reduce the sulphur releasing rate when<br>
leached.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to reduce calcium oxide content in the glass to<br>
reduce calcium load on the soil.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a sulphur releasing glass which<br>
minimizes pollution to underground water by reducing leaching rate of the constituent<br>
elements.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a slow release sulphur source to<br>
the plant all through the farming period to enhance nitrogen assimilation.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to reduce loss of sulphate radicals to the<br>
environment   so   that   toxic   sulphur   compounds   do   not   form   through   microbial<br>
transformation and do not cause environmental pollution.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to maintain acidity of the soil.<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide essential nutrients like potassium and phosphorous with low release rate in the leached solution.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides A synergistic composition useful<br>
for making slow release high content sulphur glass consisting of<br>
P2O5 in the range of	7 to 40 wt%<br>
SO3      "	16to57wt%<br>
K20        "	15to30wt%<br>
CaO        "	5 to 20 wt%<br>
AI2O3       "	0 to 2 wt%<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the source of P2O5 is obtained from orthophosphoric acid, ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate, diammonium hydrogen orthophosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, tri-calcium phosphate, aluminium phosphate or the mixtures thereof. In another embodiment of the present invention the S03 is obtained from potassium sulphate, potassium disulphate, potassium persulphate, potassium bisulphate, calcium sulphate, ammonium sulphate, aluminium sulphate or the mixtures thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the source of K2O in the composition may be provided as chemical compounds such as potassium sulphate, potassium disulphate, potassium persulphate, potassium bisulphate, potassium carbonate or the mixtures thereof.<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the CaO<br>
is obtained from tri-calcium phosphate, calcium sulphate,<br>
calcium carbonate, gypsum or the mixtures thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the  Al2O3 <br>
is obtained from aluminum  surphate,   aluminum<br>
orthophosphate, alumina or the mixtures thereof.<br>
In a embodiment of the present invention the melting may be effected for a time period in the range of 20 to 120 minutes .<br>
The composition of the present invention is not a mere admixture but a synergistic mixture having properties which are distinct from the mere aggregation of the properties of the  individual constituents.and is not  a product of chemical reaction. . Accordingly the present invention provides a process of making glass from the synergistic composition as detailed above which comprises proportioning and thorough mixing of the above composition, melting the composition at a temperature in the range of 750-1050 °C for a time 20 to 120 minutes or till the melt becomes free from the mixed components to<br>
«<br>
obtain homogenized glass melt, followed by quenching the melt by "known methods. The details of the process of the present invention are given below:<br>
1.	Chemical compounds providing P2O5 7 to 40 wt. %, SO3 16 to 57 wt. %, K2O 15 to 30<br>
wt. %, CaO 5 to 20 wt. %, A12O3 0 to 2 wt. % are mixed thoroughly.<br>
2.	The mixed materials are melted at 750-1050 °C for 20 to 120 minutes or till the melt<br>
becomes free from the mixed components to obtain homogenized glass melt.<br><br>
3. The homogenous melt was quenched by pouring to obtain slow release high content sulphur glass.<br>
Sulphur is one of the major nutrient required for healthy plant growth and crop yield and because of strong metabolic coupling between S and N assimilation deficiency of sulphur limits nitrogen utilization efficiency of the plant and thus affecting- plant growth, development and yield. Sulphur performs many important functions in the plant including synthesis of proteins, oils and vitamins. Gypsum , single- super phosphate and iron pyrites are the conventional sources of sulphur fertiliser of which gypsum is widely used to provide necessary sulphur to the plant but due to its high solubility large part of sulphate radicals derived from it percolates in the underground water damaging its quality, also repeated application of gypsum to the soil enhances calcium load on the soil. A much more successful technique resides in preparing sulphur containing glass which is added directly to the soil. Under wet or damp growing conditions small amount of sulphate radicals are made available in the intermediate vicinity of the seeds and plant roots. For this the solubility of the glass in water should be relatively small in order to prevent a quick release of nutrient elements and also to prevent them from being rendered unsuitable to the plants through chemical reaction in the soil. Yet the solubility should not be so small that the rate of release of nutrients from the glass is inadequate for plant growth. Further, the glass must not contain any such element which is harmful to the plant and its growth. Further by proper selection of the glass composition soil condition can be altered locally, in particular in an alkaline soil, which is generally regarded as being<br><br>
difficult from which to supply essential nutrients, to less alkaline or even acidic micro-environment around the roots of plants or around seeds.<br>
(S ''O42-) 2- is the main glass building unit in the sulphate glasses  In phosphate -sulphate glass SO4 2- enters the glass matrix of phosphate glass forming P-O-S bonds. Ca2+and K+ ion bridges the glass network. Higher field strength of Ca;i ions reduces the number of non-bridging oxygen and thus reduces its solubility.<br>
Thus the novelty of the process of the present invention lies in the fact that sulphur will be released slowly into the soil in presence of water as and when required at the same time maintaining the acidity of the soil as the alkali metals are not available to the reacting system in the present material. Additionally the glass do not contain harmful elements to the plants like Na2O, Li2O and ZnO. The inventive step lies in the incorporation of P2O5, SO3, K2O2, CaO and Al2O3 in a novel glass composition having high weight percent of SO,<br>
