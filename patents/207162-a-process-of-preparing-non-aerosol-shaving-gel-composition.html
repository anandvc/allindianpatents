Complete Specification<br>
(Section 10; Rule 31)<br><br>
Title<br>
A	process of preparing a anw non aerosol shaving gel composition<br>
Godrej Soaps Limited, Eastern Express Highway, Vikhroli, Mumbai 400 079, Maharashtra, India, an Indian Company.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a non aerosol shaving gel composition and composition obtained there from, in particular it relates to cosmetic compositions intended for shaving of the skin, which are.similar to shaving cream preparations.<br>
Non-aerosol shaving cream preparations have been available for decades in a variety of forms including bars, sticks, creams and lotions, generally lathering type which are most popular, \ typically applied with a brush. These compositions usually include a surfactant material, emollients to make the skin feel better, slip agents for the tool to slide over the skin in an easier manner, lubricity enhancing agents to bring about a better skin feel during and after the hair removal process as well as a carrier.<br>
Shaving compositions are present in many delivery forms. They can be present as a cream or stick. Customarily these types of formulations are based on Na+/K+/TEA+ soap systems. They may also be present as a post foaming gel, that is gel is expressed from the container and then forms foam as it is rubbed into the portion of the skin from which the hair is to be removed. Such types of gels are usually expressed from the container by an aerosol delivery system. However, these forms are expensive. Other forms of gel are like thickened shampoos packed in a tube without having cream strength.<br>
Shaving preparations are present in the form of post foaming gel, shaving cream, aerosol gel, traditional soap bars.<br>
Shaving products are normally based on soaps and can form of sticks, creams or aerosols. These may be composed of short chain fatty acids (typically lauric acid, myristic acid) which provide the rapidly forming copious lather, essential in an effective shaving product. Most of the shaving creams are opaque in nature.<br>
Shaving product function by surrounding each hair with an array of very small air bubbles which separate and present the hfcir in erect form, ready for blade cutting. Shaving products must therefore produce copious quantities of foam in a short duration of time. The foam produced should also be durable and lubricous, so that the cutting blade slides easily over the face throughout the shaving process.<br>
Therefore, there exists a need for a non-aerosol shave gel, like any shavmg oream, which has abilities of skin cleansing conditioning slip and lubricity  while being essentially non-<br>
irritating. Addjtiona^nrcan be made in normaTequlpment. It has a further benefit of being able to be packed in_co¥apsible tubes, which allows for thedelivery to the skin of a predetermined specific amount of material<br>
The present invention is particularly a transparent emulsion, foaming like a shaving cream and can be filled in a shaving container, which allows for the delivery to the skin of a predetermined specific amotmt of material, unlike conventional aerosol gel. In aerosol shaving gels the gel is generally maintained in a package system or a diaphragm inside the package driven by a propellant or a mechanical force, such as a spring.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a non-aerosolshaving composition, which is transparent or clear gel and can be filled in shaving cream tubes  and also it provideslather by applicationi witTTa brush or by application with fingers. It is further object of the present Invention to provide a non-aerosol shaving gel composition with advantageous lathering properties, beard conditioning properties, resulting in superior shave attributes compared to otther non-aerosol shaving products.<br>
Thus therefore according to the present invention a process of preparing a non aerosol shaving gel composition comprises mixing of<br>
a)	15 to 40% of a mixture of potassium palmitate, laurate and myristate wherein the weight<br>
ratio of the palmitic acid to  lauric acuTand  myristic acid is respectively about 0.7 to ,<br>
about 13   0 5   1 hrating the minture to about 800 C and  then adding<br>
b)	0.1 to 2.5 % hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose<br>
c)	5-15 % of mixture of humactants preferably 1:1 mixture of glycerol and propylene glycol<br>
d)	0.1 to 2.5 %PEG-20oleyl alcohol  J<br>
Q) £0.2-3% of potassium stearatefes a gelling agent to about 650-900c ,<br>
The essential components of the composition according to the invention will be described in further detail below.<br>
The water in the composition of the present invention may be tap water, distilled water or deionised water. The composition should comprise from 40-90% by weight of water, more preferably from 50-70 % by weight of water. The upper limit of water will affect the consistency of the Gel.<br>
The soap used in the composition according to the invention may be any soap. It has however been found that the type of soap used in the composition may alter the characteristics of the gel or foam produced. Preferred soaps include the water-soluble palmitate, laurate and myristate soaps, such as potassium, sodium and the water-soluble amine soaps of commercial palmitic acid, lauric acid and myristic acid. Such soaps may typically be made by neutralization of the appropriate fatty acids with suitable alkali, either in situ or separately.<br>
In the present invention preferably potassium soap of palmitic acid, lauric acid and myristic acid respectively in a ratio of about 0-7 to about 1-3 : 0-5 : 1;<br>
15 to 40 % of a mixture of potassium palmitate, laurate and myristate wherein the weight ratio of the palmitic acid to lauric acid and myristic acid is respectively about 0.7 to about  1.3:0.5: 1. .<br>
About 0.1-2% of an ethoxylated emollient as slip agent is an ethoxylated lanolin with about 40 -75 ethoxy group.<br>
About 0.1-2.5% of cellulosic gellation agent<br><br>
About 0.1-2.5% of Ethoxylated Oleyl Alcohol<br>
About 0.1 to 2% salt of a-hydroxy acids<br>
About 5-15% of mixture of humactants like glycerol, propylene glycol or sorbitol<br>
About 0.25-2% of Polysorbate-20 or 60<br>
about 0.2-3% of Potassium Stearate<br>
Above proportion will give good and dense foam. The composition is in accordance with above claim is gel and clear and also packed in a deformable tube. When squeezed from the tube the gel will attain the ribbon form like any shaving cream or tooth gel.<br>
The invention concerns a composition comprising about potassium salts of a mixture of \ palmitic acid, lauric acid and myristic acid in a ratio of about 0.7 to about 1.3 : 0.5 : 1, \ respectively. The preferred alkali is used was potassium hydroxide to neutralize the long ' chain alkyl carboxylic acids.<br>
Optionally small amount of ethanolamine like monoethanolamine or triethanolamine about 0.1 to 1.5 % is preferred to maintain the clarity.<br>
The major essential component of the composition is water about 40-75% preferably about 45-60 by weight of composition which is preferably deionized or distilled water, free of dissolved electrolytes such as salts and acids. The water component is essential to provide adequate solubility for the soap component and compatibility with the other essential ingredients and to provide a stable composition having the desired foaming properties and capable of being readily rinsed from the skin and razor.<br>
The composition according to the invention can contain moisturizing agents selected from sorbitol, glycerol or propylene glycol. Combination of glycerol and propylene glycol preferably 1:1 acts as moisturizing agent, film forming and also plays as solvent to give transparency to the gel. Preferable range between 5-15 % by weight relative to the total weight of composition. With above percentage both the moisturizers also impart emmolliency, providing slip and lubricity.<br>
The composition according to the invention also comprises various emollients such as oleyl ethanolamine, ethoxylated oleyl alcohol. The preferred emollient in this case is lanolin with about 40 to 75 ethoxy groupings, PEG-60 lanolin being preferred.<br>
Polysorbates like Tween 20 or Tween 60 are also help in maintaining transparency, preferably Tween-60.<br>
The composition according to the invention can contain, in addition to the humactants, such as moisturizing agents selected from salt of a-hydroxy acids like potassium lactate, ammonium lactate and sodium lactate. Preferably sodium lactate , which not only acts as a moisturizer also film forming agent, preferably between 0.1 to 2% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition.<br><br>
The composition is in gel _form and therefore requires gelling agents to be present. Combination of cellulosic agent and salt of stearate_ is used as gelling agents. The cellulose derivative which can be employed is a hydroxy alkylated material up to 4 carbon atoms in length preferably hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose. Potassium stearate is used as gelling agent. Together these two gelling agents provide the appropriate gellation characteristics to the composition and also provide the type of lubricity and slip. It is important to maintain a balance between the gellation properties and the skin feel or slip. When using hydroxy, propyl methyl cellulose as a gellation agent, it is important to maintain the concentration in the composition for the hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose below 1.0 % preferably below 0.5 %. Above this, quality of the gel tends to become stringy in nature. Additionally the content of potassium stearate should be maintained below 3 % by weight in the composition. If it is above about 3% by weight of the composition the viscosity of the gel can be adversely affected. Other additives like preservatives, stabilizers and appropriate colourants can be present in the composition.<br>
The viscosity is generally from about 50,000 to about 150,000 cps, preferably from 50,000 to about 1,00,000 cps. The gel is clear as measured by clarity to the eye.<br>
