				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a radio communication network<br>
for detecting the presence of fraudulent Subscriber Identity Modules.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In modern mobile communications networks, such as second generation<br>
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks or third generation<br>
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks, mobile<br>
subscribers are univocally identified by an International Mobile Subscriber Identity<br>
(IMSI).<br>
With reference to GSM networks, it is known that the IMSI is made up of<br>
three groups of codes, namely a three-digit Mobile Country Code (MCC) which<br>
identifies the country, a two-digit Mobile Network Code (MNC) which identifies the<br>
GSM network within that country, and a Mobile Station Identification Number<br>
(MSIN) of up to ten digits. The MSIN univocally identifies the subscriber within a<br>
network, while the group consisting of the MNC and the MSIN, which group is<br>
conventionally called National Mobile Subscriber Identity or NMSI, identifies the<br>
subscriber within a country.<br>
The subscriber's identification codes, such as the IMSI, are usually stored in<br>
a smart card called Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), which is accommodated in the<br>
user equipment through which a subscriber benefits of various services provided by<br>
the network operator, first of all phone calls.<br>
The ever increasing demand for mobile Internet and multimedia services has<br>
brought to the implementation of third generation (3G) networks such as the UMTS.<br>
UMTS networks are technically more advanced and allow for better performance,<br>
but the basic concepts and needs have remained the same, including the need of<br>
univocally identifying a subscriber in the network. In the case of UMTS networks, a<br>
Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USM) is used, which is equivalent to the<br>
SIM card but suitably designed for third generation telephony.<br>
The disclosure refers indifferently to 2G and 3G networks so that, from now<br>
on, the term SIM will indicate either a SIM or a USIM.<br><br>
Notwithstanding more and more complex algorithms have been developed<br>
and used for encrypting data stored in or exchanged by the SIMs and the network,<br>
piracy continues to jeopardise secrecy of such data. In particular, a diffused piracy<br>
technique consists in fully cloning a SIM card, creating SIM cards which behave as<br>
the original card and are indistinguishable from the original card.<br>
A user equipment on which a cloned SIM card is installed can access all the<br>
services that are accessible by the user equipment provided with the "original" SIM<br>
card, whereas the corresponding bills are charged to the legitimate subscriber.<br>
The legitimate subscriber is usually not aware of fraudulent uses of his<br>
subscription, such as fraudulent mobile calls charged on his account. Even if he<br>
suspects that there may be an illegitimate beneficiary of his subscription, the<br>
GSM/UMTS network operator is nowadays unable to efficiently detect such<br>
fraudulent behaviour.<br>
A possible solution to this problem is to examine the subscriber's phone call<br>
list attempting to spot fraudulent use, for example by noticing calls very close from a<br>
temporal point of view but originating and/or directed to Service Areas far away<br>
from each other or unusual for the subscriber.<br>
This inspection would be a cumbersome one and would be unsuccessful in<br>
many cases, for instance when the cloned SIM is used in the same town as the<br>
legitimate one.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to overcome the above mentioned<br>
problems, by providing an automatic mechanism which can determine whether a<br>
legitimate and an illegitimate Subscriber Identity Modules are used at the same time.<br>
Within this aim, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
detecting the presence of fraudulent Subscriber Identity Modules which is<br>
independent of their location with respect to the Service Area serving the legitimate<br>
Subscriber Identity Module.<br><br>
Another important object of the invention is to provide a method for<br>
detecting a fraudulent use of a subscription which does not make undue or<br>
unnecessary use of network resources.<br>
Another object of the invention is to allow the network operator to quickly<br>
intervene in a compromised subscription as soon as an illegitimate SIM is detected.<br>
A further object is to preserve the standard architecture of the radio<br>
communication networks without affecting the communications standards among the<br>
various entities interacting over the network.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to meet the needs of both the<br>
legitimate subscriber and the operator, by assuring the former that his subscription is<br>
always under surveillance and by satisfying the profit of the latter, the subscribers<br>
being encouraged in taking advantage of the operator's services if privacy and<br>
surveillance are guaranteed.<br>
This aim, these objects and other which will become better apparent<br>
hereinafter are achieved by a method for detecting the presence of fraudulent<br>
Subscriber Identity Modules in a network for cellular communications comprising<br>
the steps of: at a first Service Node, receiving a registration request by a first User<br>
Equipment comprising a Subscriber Identity Module for defining an identity of a<br>
subscriber; initiating a checking to establish whether the subscriber is already<br>
registered with the same identity in at least one Service Node over the network,<br>
including the first Service Node; if the subscriber results to be already registered with<br>
the same identity in at least a second Service Node over the network, retrieving status<br>
information on at least a second User Equipment associated with the already<br>
registered subscription for checking whether the second User Equipment is not the<br>
first User Equipment; and disabling any subscription of the subscriber associated<br>
with the identity if the second User Equipment results not to be the first User<br>
Equipment.<br>
The aim and the objects of the invention are also achieved by a radio<br>
communication network for detecting the presence of fraudulent Subscriber Identity<br>
Modules comprising Service Nodes having mobility management capabilities,<br><br>
characterised in that it comprises: at a first Service Node, means for receiving a<br>
registration request by a first User Equipment comprising a Subscriber Identity<br>
Module for defining an identity of a subscriber; means for initiating a checking to<br>
establish whether the subscriber is already registered with the same identity in at<br>
least one Service Node over the network, including the first Service Node; retrieving<br>
means for retrieving status information on at least a second User Equipment<br>
associated with the already registered subscription, the retrieving means being set so<br>
as to be activated if the subscriber results to be already registered with the same<br>
identity in at least a second Service Node over the network; checking means for<br>
checking whether the at least a second User Equipment is not the first User<br>
Equipment; and means for disabling any subscription of the subscriber associated<br>
with the identity, the means for disabling being set so as to be activated if the<br>
outcome of the checking means is that the at least a second User Equipment is not<br>
the first User Equipment.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the second Service Node is<br>
different from the first Service Node, whether in the same network or in a different<br>
network or country. In this case, the means for initiating a checking to establish<br>
whether the subscriber is already registered with the same identity in at least one<br>
Service Node over the network are located at the Home Location Register of the<br>
subscriber. Said means are preferably programmed so that the initiating step<br>
comprises the step of performing a Location Update towards the Home Location<br>
Register associated with the subscriber in response to the registration request by the<br>
first User Equipment. The retrieving step comprises the steps of asking the second<br>
Service Node for Current Location information and of rejecting the registration<br>
request by the first User Equipment if the Current Location information is returned to<br>
the Home Location Register.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the second Service<br>
Node is the first Service Node. In this case, the means for initiating a checking to<br>
establish whether the subscriber is already registered with the same identity in at<br>
least one Service Node over the network are located at the first Service Node and the<br><br>
retrieving step preferably comprises the steps of checking whether the already<br>
registered subscriber is in idle mode; issuing a Global Paging from the first Service<br>
Node directed to the User Equipments served by the first Service Node, if the already<br>
registered subscriber is in idle mode, and then checking whether at least two Paging<br>
Responses are received by the first Service Node in response to the Global Paging,<br>
the second User Equipment resulting not to be the first User Equipment should at<br>
least two Paging Responses be received.<br>
Advantageously, the method according to the invention may additionally<br>
comprise the step of checking whether the already registered subscriber is in busy<br>
mode. In this case, the second User Equipment results not to be the first User<br>
Equipment if the already registered subscriber is in busy mode. In this case, the<br>
registration request is rejected by the first User Equipment and the ongoing call is<br>
dropped.<br>
According to further details of the present invention, the Home Location<br>
Register associated with the subscriber is provided with an indicator stored therein<br>
and associated with the subscriber, the indicator being set by the subscriber for<br>
activating or deactivating the detecting method. The indicator is preferably uploaded<br>
to any Visitor Location Register where the Subscriber Identity Module registers.<br>
Preferably, when the disabling step is performed, the subscriber is de-<br>
registered, a Mobile Application Part (MAP) "Purge" Message is sent to the Home<br>
Location Register for purging the first User Equipment and an alarm report is issued<br>
at the Home Location Register to alert operator personnel. The Purge MAP Message<br>
preferably comprises an additional parameter indicating that a cloned Subscriber<br>
Identity Module has been detected, the Serving Node being the Mobile Switching<br>
Center.<br>
Service Nodes may be any one of a Mobile Service Switching Center, a<br>
Visitor Location Register and a Home Location Register, and the radio<br>
communication network may be any one of a 2G or 3G mobile communication<br>
network.<br><br>
A user equipment in the context of the invention may be a mobile station, a<br>
computing device comprising or connected to means for wireless<br>
telecommunications, or a handset adapted to provide mobile telecommunications, in<br>
which an identification module comparable to a SIM or USIM is particularly<br>
installed.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A typical and conventional mobile cellular network 10 is shown in Figure 1.<br>
The network 10 is for instance a second generation Global System for Mobile<br>
Communications (GSM) Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) or a third generation<br>
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network. However, the same<br>
inventive concept may apply to any existing or forthcoming new generation networks,<br>
as long as the general architecture remains substantially the same.<br><br>
Network 10 comprises a plurality of cells 12a, 12b, 12c, which are associated<br>
with at least one Base Station Subsystem 13a, 13b, 13c, schematically represented by<br>
a tower antenna, and grouped so as to form MSC Service Areas 11a, 11b and 11C<br>
associated with a geographical zone. The cells are depicted as being ideally<br>
complementary to each other, but in practice they may partially overlap to each other<br>
and be of any shape.<br>
The MSC Service Areas are served by Visitor Location Registers (VLRs), for<br>
instance VLRs 15a, 15b, 15c, which are preferably comprised or connected to at least<br>
one service node, in particular at least to a Mobile Services Switching Center (MSC)<br>
14a, 14b and 14c.<br>
The basic function of an MSC/VLR is to switch speech and data connections<br>
between Base Station Controllers (BSCs), other MSCs, other networks and external<br>
non-mobile networks. The MSC/VLR also handles a number of functions associated<br>
with mobile subscribers, among others registration, location updating and handover<br>
between a user equipment and the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN).<br>
The VLR stores data about all the users that are roaming within the MSC<br>
Service Area of the corresponding MSC. This data is updated through a location<br>
update procedure initiated from the user equipment of each customers via the MSC, or<br>
directly from the subscriber's home service node, such as Home Location Register<br>
(HLR) or Home Subscriber Server (HSS) 16.<br>
The HLR/HSS is the home register of the subscriber, which particularly stores<br>
information about the subscription, the subscriber's identification data and profile, the<br>
services which are allowed to the subscriber and the subscriber's location. When the<br>
subscriber roams into the MSC Service Area of an MSC different from the home<br>
MSC, the HLR/HSS is updated accordingly.<br>
The skilled in the art easily appreciates that the HLR/HSS 16, which is shown<br>
in Figure 1 as a separate entity, may be also positioned within any MSC/VLR and<br>
may serve several service nodes.<br>
In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the subscriber's profile stored<br>
in the HLR 16 comprises a particular indicator which can be set by the legitimate<br><br>
subscriber who suspects that his SIM has been cloned or cracked. This indicator is<br>
hereinafter referred to as "Suspected Cloned SIM".<br>
The Suspected Cloned SIM indicator is uploaded to the VLRs where the<br>
subscriber is currently registered by means of the known Mobile Application Part<br>
(MAP) operation called INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA. In particular, with<br>
reference to the MAP Technical Specification no. 29.002 of the 3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project, release 6 (TS 3GPP 29.002 v6.5.0), the subscriber management<br>
type insertSubscriberDataArg is modified by adding the parameter<br>
suspectedClonedSIM as indicated in the following Table 1.<br><br>
In the following it is assumed that a Suspected Cloned SIM indicator exists<br>
and is set in the HLR 16. Obviously, the invention can operate even without a<br>
Suspected Cloned SIM indicator, should the fraud detection features be set by default.<br>
The fraud detection procedure and network according to the invention refers to<br>
two main cases. The first case relates to an arrangement in which two user equipments<br>
having respectively a legitimate SIM and a corresponding illegitimate SIM are<br>
displaced in the same MSC service area served by the same MSC.<br>
The second case relates instead to the situation in which the two SIMs are<br>
located in different MSC Service Areas.<br><br>
An exemplification of these two cases is illustrated in Figure 1. A legitimate<br>
user equipment 17c, i.e. a user equipment supplied with the legitimate or original<br>
SIM/USIM card, is located in the MSC Service Area 11C. A first illegitimate user<br>
equipment 18c, i.e. a user equipment having an illegitimate or cloned SIM/USIM card<br>
installed, is located in the same MSC Service Area 11C, so that both the legitimate and<br>
the illegitimate user equipments are to be served by the same MSC 14c.<br>
A second illegitimate user equipment 19a is instead depicted as located in<br>
Service Area 11a, so that the Service Nodes serving the legitimate and the illegitimate<br>
user equipments are different.<br>
Even though they are not depicted in the figures, various arrangements of the<br>
user equipments may be provided, provided that a checking for possible identical<br>
registrations in the network is performed as soon as a registration request from a first<br>
user equipment is received at any Service Node. For instance, two user equipments<br>
may be located in different core networks or in different countries.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention and with reference to Figure<br>
2, a procedure for initiating a checking on whether a first user equipment 18c trying to<br>
register with the MSC/VLR 14c is already registered with the same identity in another<br>
MSC is started at step 200, supposing that such first user equipment is user equipment<br>
18c.<br>
As soon as the user equipment 18c enters or is switched on in Service Area<br>
11c, a conventional Location Update procedure 205 is performed. In this procedure,<br>
the user equipment 18c communicates, by means of the Base Station Subsystem<br>
responsible for the cell visited by the user equipment, its location and identification<br>
data to the MSC 14c, in order to update the database stored in the VLR 15c.<br>
At step 210, it is checked whether the IMSI associated with user equipment<br>
18c is already present in the VLR 15c, thus verifying whether the subscriber<br>
associated with such IMSI is currently already registered with a same identity.<br>
If no identical IMSI is found, the Location Update procedure carries on in a<br>
conventional manner at step 220, the VLR 15c is updated by registering the<br>
subscriber's IMSI and the procedure is then terminated at step 225.<br><br>
On the contrary, if an identical IMSI is found in the VLR 15c, at step 215 the<br>
system checks whether the Suspected Cloned SIM indicator is set for the subscriber.<br>
If so, a fraud detection procedure 300 is started, otherwise the Location Update<br>
procedure is again completed at steps 220 and 225.<br>
The fraud detection procedure 300, as detailed in Figure 3, comprises the step<br>
of retrieving status information on a possible second user equipment 17c, i.e. a second<br>
SIM/USIM, which may be present in the Service Area visited by the first user<br>
equipment 18c.<br>
In certain circumstances, even though an identical IMSI is present in the VLR<br>
15c, this may be caused by an improper or late updating of the VLR itself, a situation<br>
which has to be handled to avoid raising of false alarms and undue service<br>
interruptions.<br>
Upon starting of the retrieving procedure at step 300, a check is performed at<br>
step 305 to detect whether the second user equipment 17c is idle or busy, e.g. in<br>
conversation.<br>
If the second user equipment 17c is busy, a cloning has certainly occurred, in<br>
that two cards identified by the same IMSI are reported to be in a different status.<br>
Therefore, at step 310 the location update of the first user equipment 18c is rejected<br>
and, at step 335 the subscriber's 17c ongoing call is dropped and the procedures<br>
jumps to step 340. Preferably, before dropping the ongoing call, a further check is<br>
carried out at step 335 for verifying that such ongoing call is an Emergency call. If so,<br>
the procedure is suspended until the Emergency call is closed by the user.<br>
Then, at step 340, the user is de-registered and a MAP operation Purge-MS<br>
message is sent to the HLR 16 with an additional "Cloned SIM Detected" parameter<br>
at step 345, so that the HLR 16 may take any appropriate action to disable the cards.<br>
In particular, with reference to the Technical Specification TS 3GPP 29.002 v6.5.0,<br>
the location registration data type PurgeMS-Arg is modified as shown in the following<br>
Table 2.<br><br><br>
In the case that an identical IMSI is found in the VLR 15c and that, at step<br>
305, the user equipment 17c of a second user is found to be idle, it must be ensured<br>
that two identical SIMs are actually being detected before any further action is taken<br>
to prevent fraudulent use.<br>
In this regard, the location update procedure is carried out at step 315 and the<br>
requested registration is allowed and performed.<br>
However, at step 320 the user equipment 18c is put in a barred state, and the<br>
user is not allowed to make any mobile generating calls with the exception, for safety<br>
reasons, of emergency calls.<br>
At step 325, a Global Paging is issued by the MSC/VLR 14c and, at step 330,<br>
the number of responses received in reply to the Global Paging request is checked by<br>
the MSC/VLR 14c.<br>
If only one response is received, then the presence in the VLR 15c of two<br>
identical IMSI codes is to be ascribed to normal delays in operation, and the system<br>
understands that no SIM has been cloned, thus ending the anti-fraud procedure at step<br>
350 and reinstating the user 18c to his normal state.<br>
Should two or more paging responses be returned to the MSC/VLR 14c, any<br>
call request is torn down and the procedure continues from step 335 as already<br>
described.<br>
With reference now to Figure 4, when the legitimate SIM and the cloned one<br>
are active in different MSC Service Areas 11a-11c, the procedure for detecting a<br>
cloned SIM can not be performed inside an MSC/VLR 14c but must be carried out by<br>
the HLR 16, which is always contacted by the MSC when registering a subscriber,<br>
regardless of the country or network from which the subscriber is trying to register.<br>
As soon as user equipment 19a enters or is switched on in a Service Area 11a,<br>
a conventional Location Update procedure 405 is started.<br><br>
In this procedure, the user equipment 19a communicates, by means of the<br>
Base Station Subsystem responsible for the cell visited by the user equipment 19a, its<br>
location and identification data to the MSC 14a in order to update the database stored<br>
in the VLR 15a. The MSC 14a performs in turn an Update Location procedure<br>
towards the HLR 16, which checks if the indicator "Suspected Cloned SIM" is set for<br>
the subscriber corresponding to the received data.<br>
If so, at step 410, it is checked whether the IMSI associated with user<br>
equipment 19a is already present in one of the VLRs reachable by the HLR 16, in<br>
which case the fraud detection procedure associated with a status information<br>
retrieving procedure 500 is started, otherwise the Location Update procedure is<br>
completed at steps 415 and 420.<br>
With reference to Figure 5, at step 505 the HLR 16 sends a MAP operation<br>
"Provide Subscriber Info" asking the MSC/VLR 14c inside which an IMSI identical<br>
to the caller's IMSI was found for Current Location information of the user<br>
equipment 17c.<br>
On response to such message, the MSC/VLR checks whether the user<br>
equipment corresponding to the IMSI is idle, by issuing a Paging request to the user<br>
equipment 17c. If the user equipment 17c answers the Paging request, the MSC/VLR<br>
14c sends a "Provide Subscriber Info response" to the HLR 16, including the "Current<br>
Location Retrieved" parameter, at step 510.<br>
Instead, should the user equipment 17c be busy, the same message is<br>
immediately returned from the MSC/VLR 14c to the HLR 16, the Paging request to<br>
the user equipment 17c being unnecessary in this case.<br>
At step 515, the HLR 16 checks whether a Current Location has been returned<br>
by the MSC/VLR 14c for user equipment corresponding to the suspected cloned SIM,<br>
in which case the Location Update procedure of user equipment 19a is rejected at step<br>
525, the user is de-registered at step 530 and an alarm is raised at step 535 by the<br>
HLR 16 so as to alert operator personnel that a cloned SIM has been detected.<br><br>
On the other hand, should the outcome at step 515 be negative, no SIM cloned<br>
has occurred and the Location Update procedure is completed conventionally at step<br>
520 and is terminated at step 540.<br>
The skilled in the art easily understands that the above described steps may be<br>
performed by any computer hardware and/or software and telecommunication means<br>
programmed through conventional techniques in order to take into account the<br>
additional information data needed by the present invention.<br>
A combination of CPU, memory and communications means, well in the<br>
reach of the skilled in the art, is required in order to perform the steps according to<br>
the invention. The invention is therefore preferably implemented by introducing new<br>
functionality in existing systems, which enhancements are clearly in the reach of the<br>
average technician and are not hereby discussed in detail. Therefore, the average<br>
technician will have no difficulty in modifying and programming the functionality of<br>
an existing system so that the system comprises means for receiving a registration<br>
request by a first User Equipment, means for initiating a checking to establish<br>
whether the subscriber is already registered with the same identity in at least one<br>
Service Node over the network, retrieving means for retrieving status information on<br>
at least a second User Equipment associated with the already registered subscription,<br>
checking means for checking whether the at least a second User Equipment is not the<br>
first User Equipment, and means for disabling any subscription of the subscriber<br>
associated with the identity, to be activated if the outcome of the checking means is<br>
that the at least a second User Equipment is not the first User Equipment.<br>
It has thus been shown that the present invention fulfils the proposed aim and<br>
objects. Clearly, several modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by<br>
the skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, the scope of the claims shall not be limited by the illustrations or the<br>
preferred embodiments given in the description in the form of examples, but rather the<br>
claims shall encompass all of the features of patentable novelty that reside in the<br>
present invention, including all the features that would be treated as equivalents by the<br>
skilled in the art.<br><br>
