BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Fig. 1 is a cutaway front elevation of a part including a timing chain of an OHC internal combustion engine 1 provided with a timing chain tensioning device in a preferred embodiment of the present invention for a motorcycle. The internal combustion engine 1 is assembled by placing a crankcase 2, a cylinder block 3 and a cylinder head 4 in that order one upon another. A chain chamber 5 is extended along the crankcase 2, the cylinder block 3 and the cylinder head 4. The internal combustion engine 1 shown in Fig. 1 is not provided with any cylinder head cover because the cylinder head 4 is divided longitudinally into two parts.<br><br>
An end part of a crankshaft 6 projects into a section corresponding to the crankcase 2 of the chain chamber 5, and a drive sprocket 7 is mounted on the end part of the crankshaft 6. An end part of camshaft 8 projects into a section corresponding to the cylinder head 4 of the chain chamber 5. A driven sprocket 9 is mounted on the end part of the camshaft 8. A timing chain 10 is extended between the drive sprocket 7 and the driven sprocket 9. The drive sprocket 7 drives the driven sprocket 9 for rotation in the direction of the arrow through the timing chain 10 to rotate cams, not shown, formed on the camshaft 8.<br>
A timing chain guide 11 of a resin is extended along the tight side pulled by the drive sprocket 7 of the timing chain 10. The timing chain guide 11 has one end part extending from a bend lla is inserted in a recess formed in a support 2a formed on a part in the chain chamber 5 of the crankcase 2, and the other end part lib is free. The timing chain guide 11 has an attaching part lie in a part near the other end part lib. The timing chain guide 11 is supported on the cylinder block 3 by a pin lid. The timing chain guide 11 has a substantially straight guide part having a bottom wall and low side walls on the opposite sides of the bottom wall. The bottom wall and the side walls define a groove. The timing chain 10 slides along the surface of the bottom wall. The side walls prevent the timing chain 10 from running off the chain guide 11.<br><br>
A timing chain tensioning device 12 in a preferred embodiment according to the present invention is pressed against the slack side extending between the push side of the drive sprocket 7 and the driven sprocket of the timing chain 10 by a hydraulic tensioner lifter 16 to take up a slack in the slack side of the timing chain 10. The tensioner lifter 16 is paced in the chain chamber 5 and is fastened to the outer surface of the cylinder block 3 with bolts 17. The tensioner lifter 16 is provided with a rod 16a pushed by hydraulic pressure so as to project into the chain chamber 5.<br>
The timing chain tensioning device 12 includes an arm 13 formed of a highly elastic steel, and a resin shoe 14 attached to a surface facing the timing chain 10 of the arm 13. A base end part of the arm 13, and a side lug 14c of a base end part of the shoe 14 of the timing chain tensioning device 12 on the side of the drive sprocket 7 are fastened together to the crankcase 2 with a bolt 15.<br>
Fig. 2A is a plan view of the arm 13 of the timing chain tensioning device 12, and Fig. 2B is a side elevation of the arm 13. The arm 13 is formed by curving a strip of a highly elastic steel, such as a spring steel. The base end part 13a of the arm 13 extends from a bend 13b and is curled in a ring 13c. The bolt 15 is passed through the ring 13c.<br>
Fig. 3 is a side elevation f the shoe 14 of the timing chain tensioning device 12, Figs. 4 and 5 are enlarged views<br><br>
of parts of the shoe 14 taken in the directions of the arrows IV and V, respectively, in Fig. 3, and Figs. 6,7,8 and 9 are enlarged sectional views taken on lines VI-VI, VII-VII, VI11-VI11 and IX-IX, respectively, in Fig. 3. The shoe 14 is a monolithic structure formed of a hard synthetic rubber in a shape conforming to the arm 13.<br>
As obvious from Figs. 4 and 5, a groove 14a of a width approximately equal to the width of the timing chain 10 is formed in a working side of the shoe 14. The shoe 14 has a bottom wall and low side walls 14b on the opposite sides of the bottom wall. The bottom wall and the side walls 14b define the groove 14a. The timing chain 10 slides along the surface of the bottom wall. The side walls 14b prevent the timing chain 10 from running off the chain guide 11. As shown in Fig. 6, a side lug 14c provided with an opening 14d extends from one side of the base end part of the shoe 14 so as to extend along and correspond to the ring 13a of the arm 13. As shown in Fig. 7, the shoe 14 is provided in a part on the side of the base end part with respect to a middle part thereof with a positioning leg 14e. The positioning leg 14e is formed integrally with the shoe 14. The positioning leg 14e comes into contact with one of the sides of the arm 13 to determine the lateral position of the shoe 14 relative to the arm 13. As shown in Fig. 8, the shoe 14 is provided in a part on the side of the free end with respect to the middle part thereof<br><br>
with a U-shaped arm 14f extending along the other side of the shoe 14 to a part serving as a contact pad 14g on the back side of the shoe 14 corresponding to the tensioner lifter 16. The arm 14f is formed integrally with the shoe 14. A positioning projection 14h is formed on the inner surface of a side part of the U-shaped arm 14f. As shown in Fig. 3, a free end part of the arm 13 is bent in a U-shape to form a hook 14i. The hook 14i has a side part 14 j on the same side as the positioning leg 14e. Thus, the free end part of the shoe 14 has a U-shaped cross section. A positioning projection 14k is formed on the inner surface of the side part 14j.<br>
Fig. 10 shows the base end part of the timing chain tensioning device 12 formed by assembling the arm 13 and the shoe 14. When the timing chain tensioning device 12 is incorporated into the internal combustion engine, the free end part of the arm 13 is inserted laterally in a groove formed in the U-shaped arm 14f of the shoe 14. Then, the free end part of the arm 13 is pressed in the hook 14i of the show 14. Then, the corresponding surfaces of the arm 13 and the shoe 14 come into contact with each other. The lateral position of the shoe 14 relative to the arm 13 is determined by the positioning lug 14e and the positioning projections 14h and 14k.  In this state, the respective side surfaces of the ring 13c of the arm 13, and the side lug 14c of the base end part of the shoe 14 are contiguous with each other, and an opening<br><br>
defined by the ring 13c and the opening 14d of the side lug 14c of the. shoe 14 coincide with each other as shown in Fig. 10. The bolt 15 is passed through the opening of the ring 13c and the opening 14d of the side lug 14c to fasten the arm 13 and the shoe 14 together to the crankcase 2.<br>
As apparent from the foregoing description, the arm 13 can be easily formed by bending a metal strip in a short processing time. The lateral position of the show 14 relative to the arm 13 is determined by the positioning lug 14e and the positioning projections 14h and 14k, and the shoe 14 is held on the arm 13 without using any adhesive by engaging the hook 14i with the free end of the arm 13 and fastening the side lug 14c to the ring 13c of the arm 13 with the bolt 15. Thus, the timing chain tensioning device requires reduced man-hours for assembling. Since the side lug 14c extends only on one side of the shoe 14, the shoe 14, as compared with a shoe provided with side lugs on the opposite sides thereof, can be easily manufactured and combined with the arm 13. Since the cushioning pad 14g serving as a cushioning member is formed integrally with the shoe 14, the number of parts is reduced and additional man-hours for manufacturing, attaching and baking a separate cushioning member are unnecessary.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
