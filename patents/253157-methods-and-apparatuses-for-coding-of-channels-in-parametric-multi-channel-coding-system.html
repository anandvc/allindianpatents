FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the encoding of audio signals and the<br>
subsequent synthesis of auditory scenes from the encoded audio data.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Multi-channel surround audio systems have been standard in movie theaters for<br>
years. As technology has advanced, it has become affordable to produce multi-<br>
channel surround systems for home use. Today, such systems are mostly sold as<br>
"home theater systems." Conforming to an ITU-R recommendation, the vast<br>
majority of these systems provide five regular audio channels and one low-<br>
frequency sub-woofer channel (denoted the low-frequency effects or LFE<br>
channel). Such multi-channel system is denoted a 5.1 surround system. There<br>
are other surround systems, such as 7.1 (seven regular channels and one LFE <br>
channel) and 10.2 (ten regular channels and two LFE channels).<br>
C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, "Efficient representation of spatial audio coding using<br>
perceptual parametrization," IEEE Workshop on Application of Sig. Proc. to Audio<br>
and Acoust., October 2001, and C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, "Binaural Cue<br>
Coding Applied to Stereo and Multi-Channel Audio Compression, "Preprint 112th<br>
Conv. Aud. Eng. Soc, May 2002, (collectively, "the BCC papers") the teaching of<br>
both of which are incorporated herein by reference, describe a parametric multi-<br>
channel audio coding technique (referred to as BCC coding).<br>

invention have (1) reduced processing loads at both the encoder and decoder<br>
and (2) smaller BCC code bitstreams than corresponding BCC-based systems that<br>
process all six channels at all frequencies.<br>
More generally, the present invention involves the application of parametric<br>
audio coding techniques, such as BCC coding, but not necessarily limited to BCC<br>
coding, where two or more different subsets of input channels are processed for<br>
two or more different frequency ranges. As used in this specification, the term<br>
"subset" may refer to the set containing all of the input channels as well as to<br>
those proper subsets that include fewer than all of the input channels. The<br>
application of the present invention to BCC coding of 5.1 and other surround<br>
signals is just one particular example of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided A method in parametric multi-channel Coding<br>
system for encoding a multi-channel audio signal having a plurality of audio input<br>
channels, characterized by comprising applying a parametric audio encoding<br>
technique to generate parametric audio codes for a first subset of the audio<br>
input channels for a first frequency region; and applying the parametric audio<br>
encoding technique to generate parametric audio for a second subset of the<br>
audio input channels for a second frequency region, wherein the second<br>
frequency region is different from the first frequency region; and the second<br>
subset is different from the subset.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Other aspects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more fully apparent from the following detailed description, the appended claims,<br>
and the accompanying drawings in which :<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of an audio processing system that performs<br>
binaural cue coding (BCC); and<br>
Figure 2 shows a block diagram of an audio processing system that performs<br>
BCC coding according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Figure 2 shows a block diagram of an audio processing system 200 that performs<br>
binaural cue coding (BCC) for 5.1 surround audio, according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention. BCC system 200 has a BCC encoder 202, which receives<br>
six audio input channels 208 (i.e. five regular channels and one LFE channel).<br>
BCC encoder 202 has a downmixer 210, which converts (e.g., averages) the<br>
audio input channels (including the LEF channel) into one or more, but fewer<br>
than six, combined channels 212.<br>
In addition, BCC encoder 202 has a BCC analyzer 214, which generates BCC cue<br>
code data stream 216 for the input channels. As indicated in Figure 2, for<br>
frequency sub-bands at or below a specified cut-off frequency fc- BCC analyzer<br>
214 uses all six 5.1 surround sound input channels (including the LEF channel)<br>
when generating the BCC cue code data. For all other (i.e., high-frequency) sub-<br><br>
bands, BCC analyzer 214 uses only the five regular channels (and not the LFE<br>
channel) to generate the BCC cue code data. As a result, the LFE channel<br>
contributes BCC codes for only BCC sub-bands at or below the cut-off frequency<br>
rather than for the full BCC frequency range, thereby reducing the overall size of<br>
the side-information bitstream.<br>
The cut-off frequency is preferably chosen such that the effective audio<br>
bandwidth of the LFE channel is smaller than or equal to fC' (that is, the LFE<br>
channel has substantially zero energy or insubstantial audio content beyond the<br>
cut-off frequency). Unless the frequency sub-bands are aligned with the cut-off<br>
frequency, the cut-off frequency falls within a particular frequency sub-band. In<br>
that.<br><br><br>
case, part of that sub-band will exceeds the cut-off frequency. For purposes of this specification, such a<br>
sub-band is referred to as being "at" the cut-off frequency. In preferred embodiments, that entire sub-<br>
band of the LFE channel is BCC coded, arid the next higher frequency sub-band is the first high-<br>
frequency sub-band that is not BCC coded.<br>
In one possible implementation, the BCC cue codes include inter-channel level difference<br>
(ICLD), inter-channel time difference (ICTD), and inter-channel correlation (ICC) data for the input<br>
channels. BCC analyzer 214 preferably performs band-based processing analogous to that described in<br>
the '877 and '458 applications to generate ICLD and ICTD data for different frequency sub-bands of the<br>
audio input channels. In addition, BCC analyzer 214 preferably generates coherence measures as the<br>
ICC data for the different frequency sub-bands. These coherence measures are described in greater<br>
detail in the '437 and '591 applications.<br>
BCC encoder 202 transmits the one or more combined channels 212 and the BCC cue code data<br>
stream 216 (e.g., as either in-band or out-of-band side information with respect to the combined<br>
channels) to a BCC decoder 204 of BCC system 200. BCC decoder 204 has a side-information<br>
processor 218, which processes data stream 216 to recover the BCC cue codes 220 (e.g., ICLD, ICTD,<br>
and ICC data). BCC decoder 204 also has a BCC synthesizer 222, which uses the recovered BCC cue<br>
codes 220 to synthesize six audio output channels 224 from the one or more combined channels 212 for<br>
rendering by six surround-sound loudspeakers 226, respectively.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 2, BCC synthesizer 222 performs six-channel BCC synthesis for sub-bands<br>
at or below the cut-off frequency fc to generate frequency content for all six 5.1 surround channels (i.e.,<br>
including the LFE channel), while performing five-channel BCC synthesis for sub-bands above the cut-<br>
off frequency to generate frequency content for only the five regular channels of 5.1 surround sound. In<br>
particular, BCC synthesizer 222 decomposes the received combined channel(s) 212 into a number of<br>
frequency sub-bands,(e.g., critical bands). In these sub-bands, different processing is applied to obtain<br>
the corresponding sub-bands of the output audio channels. The result is that, for the LFE channel, only<br>
sub-bands with frequencies at or below the cut-off frequency are obtained. In other words, the LFE<br>
channel has frequency content only for sub-bands at or below the cut-off frequency. The upper sub-<br>
bands of the LFE channel (i.e., those above the cut-off frequency) may be filled with zero signals (if<br>
necessary).<br>
Depending on the particular implementation, a BCC encoder could be designed to generate BCC<br>
cue codes for all frequencies and simply not transmit those codes for particular sub-bands (e.g., sub-<br>
bands above the cut-off frequency and/or sub-bands having substantially zero energy). Similarly, the<br>
corresponding BCC decoder could designed to perform conventional BCC synthesis for all frequencies,<br>
where the BCC decoder applies appropriate BCC cue code values for those sub-bands having no<br>
explicitly transmitted codes.<br><br>
Although the present invention has been described in the context of BCC decoders that apply the<br>
techniques of the '877 and '458 applications to synthesize auditory scenes, the present invention can also<br>
be implemented in the context of BCC decoders that apply other techniques for synthesizing auditory<br>
scenes that do not necessarily rely on the techniques of the '877 and '458 applications. For example, the<br>
BCC processing of the present invention can be implemented without ICTD, ICLD, and/or ICC data,<br>
with or without other suitable cue codes, such as, for example, those associated with head-related<br>
transfer functions.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 2, 5.1 surround sound is encoded by applying six-channel BCC<br>
analysis to sub-bands at or below the cut-off frequency and five-channel BCC analysis to sub-bands<br>
above the cut-off frequency. In another embodiment, the present invention can be applied to 7.1<br>
surround sound in which eight-channel BCC analysis is applied to sub-bands at or below a specified cut-<br>
off frequency and seven-channel BCC analysis (excluding the single LFE channel) is applied to sub-<br>
bands above the cut-off frequency.<br>
The present invention can also be applied to surround audio having more than one LFE channel.<br>
For example, for 10.2 surround sound, twelve-channel BCC analysis could be applied to sub-bands at or<br>
below a specified cut-off frequency, while ten-channel BCC analysis (excluding the two LFE channels)<br>
could be applied to sub-bands above the cut-off frequency. Alternatively, there could be two different<br>
cut-off frequencies specified: a first cut-off frequency for a first LFE channel of the 10.2 surround<br>
sound and second cut-off frequency for the second LFE channel. In this case and assuming that the first<br>
cut-off frequency is lower than the second cut-off frequency, twelve-channel BCC analysis could be<br>
applied to sub-bands at or below the first cut-off frequency, eleven-channel BCC analysis (excluding the<br>
first LFE channel) could be applied to sub-bands that are (1) above the first cut-off frequency and (2) at<br>
or below the second cut-off frequency, and ten-channel BCC analysis (excluding both LFE channels)<br>
could be applied to sub-bands above the second cut-off frequency.<br>
Similarly, some consumer multi-channel equipment is purposely designed with different output<br>
channels having different frequency ranges. For example, some 5.1 surround sound equipment have two<br>
rear channels that are designed to reproduce only frequencies below 7kHz. The present invention could<br>
be applied to such systems by specifying two cut-off frequencies: one for the LFE channel and a higher<br>
one for the rear channels. In this case, six-channel BCC analysis could be applied to sub-bands at or<br>
below the LFE cut-off frequency, five-channel BCC analysis (excluding the LFE channel) could be<br>
applied to sub-bands that are (1) above the LFE cut-off frequency and (2) at or below the rear-channel<br>
cut-off frequency, and three-channel BCC analysis (excluding the LFE channel and the two rear<br>
channels) could be applied to sub-bands above the rear-channel cut-off frequency.<br>
The present invention can be generalized further to apply parametric audio coding to two or<br>
more different subsets of input channels for two or more different frequency regions, where the<br><br>
parametric audio coding could be other than BCC coding and the different frequency regions are chosen<br>
such that the frequency content of the different input channels is reflected in these regions. Depending<br>
on the particular application, different channels could be excluded from different frequency regions in<br>
any suitable combinations. For example, low-frequency channels could be excluded from high-<br>
frequency regions and/or high-frequency channels could be excluded from low-frequency regions. It<br>
may even be the case that no single frequency region involves all of the input channels.<br>
As described previously, although the input channels 208 can be downmixed to form a single<br>
combined (e.g., mono) channel 212, in alternative implementations, the multiple input channels can be<br>
downmixed to form two or more different "combined" channels, depending on the particular audio<br>
processing application. More information on such techniques can be found in U.S. patent application<br>
no. 10/762,100, filed on 01/20/04, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In some implementations, when downmixing generates multiple combined channels, the<br>
combined channel data can be transmitted using conventional audio transmission techniques. For<br>
example, when two combined channels are generated, conventional stereo transmission techniques may<br>
be able to be employed. In this case, a BCC decoder can extract and use the BCC codes to synthesize a<br>
multi-channel signal (e.g., 5.1 surround sound) from the two combined channels. Moreover, this can<br>
provide backwards compatibility, where the two BCC combined channels are played back using<br>
conventional (i.e., non-BCC-based) stereo decoders that ignore the BCC codes. Analogously, backwards<br>
compatibility can be achieved for a conventional mono decoder when a single BCC combined channel is<br>
generated. Note that, in theory, when there are multiple "combined" channels, one or more of the<br>
combined channels may actually be based on individual input channels.<br>
Although BCC system 200 can have the same number of audio input channels as audio output<br>
channels, in alternative embodiments, the number of input channels could be either greater than or less<br>
than the number of output channels, depending on the particular application. For example, the input<br>
audio could correspond to 7.1 surround sound and the synthesized output audio could correspond to 5.1<br>
surround sound, or vice versa.<br>
In general, BCC encoders of the present invention may be implemented in the context of<br>
converting M input audio channels into N combined audio channels and one or more corresponding sets<br>
of BCC codes, where M&gt;N≥1. Similarly, BCC decoders of the present invention may be implemented<br>
in the context of generating P output audio channels from the N combined audio channels and the<br>
corresponding sets of BCC codes, where P&gt;N, and P may be the same as or different from M.<br>
Depending on the particular implementation, the various signals received and generated by both<br>
BCC encoder 202 and BCC decoder 204 of Fig. 2 may be any suitable combination of analog and/or<br>
digital signals, including all analog or all digital. Although not shown in Fig. 2, those skilled in the art<br>
will appreciate that the one or more combined channels 212 and the BCC cue code data stream 216 may<br><br>
be further encoded by BCC encoder 202 and correspondingly decoded by BCC decoder 204, for<br>
example, based on some appropriate compression scheme (e.g., ADPCM) to further reduce the size of<br>
the transmitted data.<br>
The definition of transmission of data from BCC encoder 202 to BCC decoder 204 will depend<br>
on the particular application of audio processing system 200. For example, in some applications, such as<br>
live broadcasts of music concerts, transmission may involve real-time transmission of the data for<br>
immediate playback at a remote location. In other applications, "transmission" may involve storage of<br>
the data onto CDs or other suitable storage media for subsequent (i.e., non-real-time) playback. Of<br>
course, other applications may also be possible.<br>
Depending on the particular implementation, the transmission channels may be wired or wire-<br>
less and can use customized or standardized protocols (e.g., IP). Media like CD, DVD, digital tape<br>
recorders, and solid-state memories can be used for storage. In addition, transmission and/or storage<br>
may, but need not, include channel coding. Similarly, although the present invention has been described<br>
in the context of digital audio systems, those skilled in the art will understand that the present invention<br>
can also be implemented in the context of analog audio systems, such as AM radio, FM radio, and the<br>
audio portion of analog television broadcasting, each of which supports the inclusion of an additional in-<br>
band low-bitrate transmission channel.<br>
The present invention can be implemented for many different applications, such as music<br>
reproduction, broadcasting, and telephony. For example, the present invention can be implemented for<br>
digital radio/TV/internet (e.g., Webcast) broadcasting such as Sirius Satellite Radio or XM. Other<br>
applications include voice over IP, PSTN or other voice networks, analog radio broadcasting, and<br>
Internet radio.<br>
Depending on the particular application, different techniques can be employed to embed the sets<br>
of BCC codes into a combined channel to achieve a BCC signal of the present invention. The<br>
availability of any particular technique may depend, at least in part, on the particular<br>
transmission/storage medium(s) used for the BCC signal. For example, the protocols for digital radio<br>
broadcasting usually support inclusion of additional enhancement bits (e.g., in the header portion of data<br>
packets) that are ignored by conventional receivers. These additional bits can be used to represent the<br>
sets of auditory scene parameters to provide a BCC signal. In general, the present invention can be<br>
implemented using any suitable technique for watermarking of audio signals in which data<br>
corresponding to the sets of auditory scene parameters are embedded into the audio signal to form a<br>
BCC signal. For example, these techniques can involve data hiding under perceptual masking curves or<br>
data hiding in pseudo-random noise. The pseudo-random noise can be perceived as comfort noise. Data<br>
embedding can also be implemented using methods similar to bit robbing used in TDM (time division<br><br>
multiplexing) transmission for in-band signaling. Another possible technique is mu-law LSB bit<br>
flipping, where the least significant bits are used to transmit data.<br>
The present invention may be implemented as circuit-based processes, including possible<br>
implementation on a single integrated circuit. As would be apparent to one skilled in the art, various<br>
functions of circuit elements may also be implemented as processing steps in a software program. Such<br>
software may be employed in, for example, a digital signal processor, micro-controller, or general-<br>
purpose computer.<br>
The present invention can be embodied in the form of methods and apparatuses for practicing<br>
those methods. The present invention can also be embodied in the form of program code embodied in<br>
tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable storage<br>
medium, wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer,<br>
the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. The present invention can also be<br>
embodied in the form of program code, for example, whether stored in a storage medium, loaded into<br>
and/or executed by a machine, or transmitted over some transmission medium or carrier, such as over<br>
electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via electromagnetic radiation, wherein, when the<br>
program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an<br>
apparatus for practicing the invention. When implemented on a general-purpose processor, the program<br>
code segments combine with the processor to provide a unique device that operates analogously to<br>
specific logic circuits.<br>
It will be further understood that various changes in the details, materials, and arrangements of<br>
the parts which have been described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of this invention may<br>
be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as expressed in the<br>
