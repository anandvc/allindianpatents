Therefore, the SIN ratio can be promoted. Further, there can be constituted the arrangement in which adjacent coils are arrayed proximately to<br>
each other without overlapping the coils and the degree of freedom can be promoted.<br>

Equations (4) and (5),<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>

In order to dispense with the mutual interference among coils, the conditions are that cross talk terms in Equations (1)', (2)'. and (3)' become "0". Accordingly,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Eliminating w from Equations (8) and (9),<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Eliminating  w   from Equations   (9)   and   (10),<br>
(Equation Removed)In the meantime, the respective coils 1 through 3 must be resonated at the object angular frequency u&gt; and accordingly, underlined terms in Equations (1) ' , (2) ' and (3) ' need to be "0".<br>
Hence, as a result, values of the capacitors may be set as follows.<br>
(Step 1) The coils 1 through 3 are fabricated and the inductances LI through L3 are measured.<br>
(Step 2) The coils 1 through 3 are disposed in a desired arrangement and the mutual inductances Ml through M3 are measured.<br>
(Step 3) Cl' is pertinently determined. Then, Cml is determined from Equation (19) .<br>
(Step 4) C3 ' is pertinently determined. Then, Cm2 is determined from Equation (18) .<br>
(Step 5) C2 ' is determined such that Equations (8), (9) and (10) are established by ~r.e :o:ect angular frequency<br>
The mutual interference among three pieces of the coils 1 through 3 can be dispensed with by Step 1 through Step 5, described above.<br>

Solving the equations in respect of C2 ' by substituting Equations (18) and (19) for Equation (10),<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
C2 ' must be a positive value. Accordingly,<br>
In the meantime, when Equations (18), (19) and (20) are<br>

(Step a} The coils 1 through 3 are fabricated and the inductances L1 through L3 are measured.<br>
(Step b) The coils 1 through 3 are disposed in a desired arrangement and the mutual inductances Ml through M3 are measured. At this occasion, the coils 1 through 3 are arranged such that Equation (23) is satisfied.<br>
(Stepc) C1' is determined such that Equations (21), (22) and (24) are satisfied. Then, Cml is determined from Equation (19) .<br>
(Step d) C3 ' and Cm2 are sec such that C3 ' = C1' and Cm2<br>
= Cml.<br>
(Step e) C2 ' is deiermined from Equation (20). (Step f} C1 is determined such that the underlined term in Equation (1) ' becomes "0".<br>
(Step g) C2 is determined such that the underlined term in Equation (2)' becomes "0".<br>
(Step h) C3 is set such that C3 = Cl.<br>
By the above-described procedure, the mutual interference among three pieces of the coils 1 through 3 can be dispensed with, further, the resonance can be carried out at the frequency cu .<br>
Next, an explanation will be given of Step a through Step h by a numerical value example.<br>
(Step a) The first coil 1, the second coil 2 and the third coil 3 are respectively formed in a shape of an athletic track and is made of copper with dimensions of linear portions of about 330 mm, radii of semicircular portions of about 110 mm, a conductor width of about 50 mm'and a conductor thickness of about 1 mm. At this occasion, L = 830 nH.<br>
(Step b) The first coil 1, the second coil 2 and the third coil -3 are arrayed proximately to each other with respective coil faces opposed to each other and an interval between the first coil 1 and the second coil 2 and an interval between the second coil 2 and the third coil 3 are respectively about 150 mm. At this occasion, Ml = M2 = 186.5 nH and M3 = 69.5<br>
nH.<br>
(Step c) From Equations (21), (22) and (23), 300 pF 
(Step d) C2 ' and Cm2 are set such that C2' = Cl' = 600 pF and Cm2 = Cml = 712.8 pF.<br>
(Step e) From Equation (20) , C2 ' = 246.8 pF is calculated. (Step f) Cl = 874 pF is calculated from the condition in which the underlined term in Equation (1) ' becomes "0". (Step g) C2 = 1054 pF is calculated from the condition in which the underlined term in Equation (2)' becomes "0". (Step h) C3 is set such that C3 = Cl = 874.pF. By the above-described procedure, there can be realized the RF coil 100 having no mutual interference in which three pieces of the coils 1 through 3 are arrayed proximately to each other.<br>
Fig. 3 is an equivalent circuit diagram of essential portions assuming a case in which only the loop current I1 of the first coil 1 flows.<br>
By the loop current I1 of the first coil 1 and the intercoil mutual operation Ml and M2, induced voltage of<br>
-jwM1Il is generated across both ends of the coil intermediary connecting capacitor 5 (C2 ' ) of the second coil 2 and induced voltage of -jwM3Il is generated across both<br>
ends of the coil intermediary connecting capacitor 6 (C3') of the third coil 3.<br>
In the meantime, voltage across both ends of the coil intermediary connecting capacitor 4 (C1') of the first coil 1 is transmitted to the both ends of the coil intermediary connecting capacitor (C21) of the second coil 2 via the neutralizing capacitors 14 (Cml) and 15 (Cml) and is transmitted to the both ends of the coil intermediary connecting capacitors 6 (C3 ' ) of the third coil 3 further via the neutralizing capacitors 16 (Cm2) and 17 (Cml).<br>
When the induced voltage -jwM1Il generated across the both ends of the coil intermediary connecting capacitor 5 (C21) of the second coil 2, is canceled by the voltage transmitted to the both ends of the coil intermediary connecting capacitor 5 (C2 ') via the neutralizing capacitors 14 (Cml) and 15 (Cml), the first coil 1 does not effect influence on the second coil 2. That is, the first coil 1 does not effect influence on the second coil 2 when the following equation is established. Further, when induced voltage -; wM3Il generated across the both ends of the coil interred-ary connecting capacitor<br>
6 (C3 ' ) of the third coil 3 is canceled by the voltage transmitted to the both ends of the coil intermediary-connecting capacitor 6 (C3') of the third coil 3 via the neutralizing capacitors 14 (Cml), 15 (Cml) , 16 (Cm2) and 17 (Cm2) , the first coil 1 does not effect influence on the third coil 3.<br>
Next, the following equation is established in the loop circuit in which the loop current Iml flows.<br>
Next, the following equation is established in the loop circuit in which the loop current Im2 flows.      <br>
From Equations (11) through (14), Equations (8) and (10) , mentioned above, are derived.<br>
Equation (9) , mentioned above, is derived assuming a<br>
case in which only the loop current 12 of the second coil 2 flows (or, a case in which only the loop current 13 of the third coil 3 flows) similar to the above-described.<br>
Accordingly, it can be understood that Equations (8) (9) and (10), mentioned above, signify that by transmitted voltage transmitted from both ends of a coil intermediary connecting capacitor of one coil to both ends of a coil intermediary connecting capacitor of other coil via parallel connection lines and neutralizing capacitors, induced voltage generated across both ends of the coil intermediary connecting capacitor of the other coil by the one coil via mutual inductance is canceled.<br>
According to the RF coil 100, mentioned above, there is no intercoil mutual operation and accordingly, influence of a noise component of other coil is not effected and NMR signals in respective allocated regions can be received by three pieces of the coils 1, 2 and 3 independently from each other. Therefore, compared with the case in which the intercoil mutual operation is present, the S/N ratio can be promoted. Further, the RF coil 100, mentioned above, can be used as a transmitting coil as well as a receiving coil. -Second Embodiment-Fig. 4 is an equivalent circuit of an RF coil according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The RF coil 200 is constituted so that passive decoupling<br>
circuits 31 and 32 are added to the RF coil 100 according to<br>
the first embodiment.<br>
By adding'the passive decoupling circuits 31 and 32 in<br>
this way, when transmission at high frequency is carried out<br>
from other transmitting coil, current can be prevented from<br>
flowing in the RF coil 200.<br>
Accordingly, the RF coil 200 is useful as a reception<br>
exclusive coil.<br>
-Third Embodiment-<br>
Although according to the first embodiment and the second embodiment, the neutralizing capacitors 14 and 15 respectively having the equal capacitance Cml are interposed in the parallel connection lines 10 and 11, these may be provided with capacitances different from each other. Further, although the neutralizing capacitors 16 and 17 respectively having the equal capacitance Cm2 are interposed in the parallel connection lines 12 and 13, these may be provided with capacitances different from each other.<br>
Further, a single piece of a neutralizing capacitor may be interposed in only one of the parallel connection lines 10 and 11 and a single piece of a neutralizing capacitor may be interposed in only one of the parallel connection lines 12 and 13 or .pluralities of pieces of neutralizing capacitors may respectively be interposed in the parallel connection lines 10, 11, 12 and 13.<br>
In brief, voltage transmitted to both ends of a coil intermediary connecting capacitor may cancel induced electromotive force by intercoil mutual operation by the neutralizing capacitor.<br>
Further, when the object angular frequency  is high, in order to remove influence of floating capacitance, it is preferable to interpose respective pluralities of neutralizing capacitors in the parallel connection lines 10, 11, 12 and 13. -Fourth Embodiment-<br>
Although according to the first and the second embodiment, an explanation has been given of the RF coils 100 and 200 using three pieces of the coils 1, 2 and 3, also in the case of an RF coil using four pieces or more of coils, condition equations may be derived and values of coil intermediary connecting capacitors, neutralizing capacitors and resonance capacitors may be determined similar to the above-described. -Fifth Embodiment-<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective view showing essential portions of an MRI apparatus according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The MRI apparatus 300 is a vertical magnetic field type MRI apparatus for generating a main magnetic field in the vertical direction and is provided with a lower magnet 140<br>
and an upper magnet 150 which are opposed to each other in the up. and down direction, a cradle 120 going into and coming out from a space between the magnets 140 and 150 and the RF coil 100 installed above the cradle 120.<br>
The RF coil 100 is the RF coil according to the present invention explained in the above-described embodiment and is installed such that a coil face thereof is directed in the longitudinal direction of the cradle 120.<br>
A detected member (broken lines) is mounted above the cradle 120 such that a trunk portion thereof penetrates coil faces of the respective coils of the RF coil 100.<br>
According to the MR.I apparatus 300, there is no intercoil mutual operation among three pieces of the coils (1, 2 and 3) constituting the RF coil 100 and accordingly, NMR signals of respective allocated regions can be received by three pieces of the coils 1,2 and 3 independently from each other without undergoing influence of a noise component of other coil. Accordingly, the SIN ratio can be promoted in comparison with a case in which the intercoil mutual operation is present.<br>
