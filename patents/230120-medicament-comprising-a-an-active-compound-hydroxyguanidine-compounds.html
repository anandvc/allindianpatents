				<td>Hydroxyamidine and hydroxyguanidine compounds as<br>
urokinase inhibitors<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds for<br>
inhibiting the urokinase plasminogen activator 	(uPA),<br>
which have high bioavailability and oral administer-<br>
ability, and also to the use thereof as therapeutic<br>
active compounds for the treatment of urokinase- or/and<br>
urokinase receptor-associated disorders such as, for<br>
example, tumors and metastasizing. The invention<br>
relates in particular to compounds containing hydroxy<br>
amidine or hydroxyguanidine) groups.<br>
The plasminogen activator of the urokinase type (uPA)<br>
plays a key part in tumor invasion and the formation of<br>
metastases (Schmit: et al., J. Obst. Gyn. 21 (1995),<br>
151-165). uPA is expressed in many different types of<br>
tumor cells (Kwaar, Cancer Metastasis Rev. 11 (1992),<br>
291-311) and binds to the tumor-associated uPA receptor<br>
(uPAR) where activation of plasminogen to plasmin<br>
occurs. Plasmin is capable of degrading various<br>
components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), such as<br>
fibronectin, laminin and type IV collagen. It also<br>
activates some other ECM-degrading enzymes, in<br>
particular matrix metalloproteinases. Large amounts of<br>
tumor-associated uPA correlate with a higher risk of<br>
metastasizing for cancer patients (Harbeck et al.,<br>
Cancer Research 52 (2002), 4617-4622). Inhibition of<br>
the proteolytic activity of uPA is therefore a good<br>
starting point for an antimetastatic therapy.<br>
Some active and selective urokinase inhibitors have<br>
been described previously. Thus, EP 1 098 651 discloses<br>
benzamidine-type uPA inhibitors, and WO 01/96286 and<br>
WO 02/14349 disclose arylguanidine-type uPA inhibitors.<br>
A common feature of these synthetic inhibitors is a<br><br>
basic radical consisting of an amidino or/and guanidino<br>
group.<br>
However, the known urokinase inhibitors have the<br>
disadvantage of being absorbed poorly when applied<br>
orally and thus car. exert only a low pharmacological<br>
action in the body with this type of administration.<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations are therefore administered<br>
to the patient intravenously usually once, but up to<br>
twice weekly over a period, of several hours. This puts<br>
a great strain on the patient, since this requires<br>
considerable time and frequent hospital visits and<br>
demands a high level of cooperation of the patient.<br>
Moreover, intravenous administration carries the risk<br>
of infections and, especially in the case of para-<br>
vasally escaping irfusate, severe local irritations up<br>
to tissue necroses may occur, which require time-<br>
consuming subsequent treatments and monitoring.<br>
Intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of administration<br>
also do not offer any advantages, since here frequently<br>
severe pain at the injection sites and also irritations<br>
up to tissue necroses may occur, which likewise require<br>
a time-consuming after-treatment.<br>
As discussed above, the amidine- and guanidine-<br>
containing urokinase inhibitors exhibit only low<br>
pharmacological action when applied orally. A<br>
precondition for the therapeutic effect of an active<br>
compound is the bioavailability of the latter. Oral<br>
administration requires absorption from the gastro-<br>
intestinal tract. An important mechanism of this kind<br>
of membrane penetration is passive diffusion (Gangvar<br>
S. et al., DDT (1997) 148-155). The lipophilicity of an<br>
active compound was assumed in some parts of the<br>
literature to play an important part in passive<br>
diffusion via tha membrane barriers of the gastro-<br>
intestinal tract Thus, EP 0 708 640 describes for<br><br>
pentamidines with antihelminthic action a modification<br>
of amidine functions to give amidoxime, amidoxime ester<br>
and oxadiazole, with preference being given to using<br>
the amidoxime esters and oxadiazole as suitable<br>
modifications.<br>
On the other hand, however, it was shown that the<br>
degree of lipophilicity alone is not sufficient (Hansch<br>
et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 86 (1964) 1616-1626) and that<br>
an increase in the lipophilicity of the compounds is<br>
not an appropriate parameter for predicting membrane<br>
penetration. Thus, a direct relation between lipophilicity<br>
 and memorane permeation was not found<br>
(Conradi et al., Pharm. Res. 9 (1992) 435-439).<br>
The increase in lipophilicity may therefore, in<br>
individual cases, increase membrane permeation, but not<br>
necessarily lead to an increased oral bioavailability.<br>
Thus, in the case of argatroban, conversion of the<br>
basic radical to the amidoxime as a prodrug results in<br>
improved permeability but, in addition, in the loss of<br>
activity (Rewinkel, Adang Cur. Pharm. Design 5 (1999)<br>
1043-1075). It is therefore not readily predictable,<br>
whether and which modifications can improve membrane<br>
penetration of an active compound in the gastro-<br>
intestinal tract. It is even less predictable which<br>
influence said modifications may have on the<br>
pharmaceutical properties of the active compound.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide<br>
novel medicaments for inhibiting urokinase, whose<br>
bioavailability and activity in the organism, in the<br>
case of oral administration, is distinctly increased.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
a medicament, which comprises, as an active compound,<br>
one or more compounds of the general formula I and/or<br>

and also salts thereof, for example the hydrogen<br>
sulfates such as, for example, WX-671 • HS04.<br>
The compounds of :he invention may be used, where<br>
appropriate, together with suitable pharmaceutical<br>
adjuvants or carriers for the preparation of<br>
medicaments. Administration is possible here in<br>
combination with other active compounds, for example<br>
other urokinase inhibitors, such as, for example,<br>
antibodies and/or peptides, or else with chemotherapeutics<br>
 and cytostatics or/and cytostatic active<br>
compounds.<br>
The medicaments may be administered to humans and<br>
animals topically, rectally or parenterally, for<br>
example intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly,<br>
intraperitoneally, sublingually, nasally or/and<br>
inhalationally, for example in the form of tablets,<br>
coated tablets, capsules, pellets, suppositories,<br>
solutions, emulsions, suspensions, liposomes,<br>
inhalation sprays or transdermal systems such as<br>
plasters, and particularly preferably orally, for<br>
example as a slow-release/retard formulation.<br>
The compounds of the invention are suitable for<br>
controlling diseases associated with pathological over-<br><br>
expression of uPA or/and urokinase plasminogen-activator<br>
receptor (uPAR). For example, they are capable of<br>
inhibiting in a highly efficient manner the growth<br>
or/and the spreading of malignant tumors and<br>
metastasizing of tumors. Examples thereof are neoplastic<br>
disorders, for example breast cancer, lung cancer,<br>
cancer of the bladder, stomach cancer, cervix cancer,<br>
ovarian cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer and soft<br>
tissue sarcomas, in particular tumors associated with a<br>
high rate of metastasizing. The compounds may be used,<br>
where appropriate, together with other tumor agents or<br>
with other types of treatment, for example radiation<br>
or/and surgical procedures.<br>
The compounds of the invention are furthermore also<br>
active for other uPA-associated or/and uPAR-associated<br>
disorders. Examples of such disorders are, for example,<br>
pulmonary hypertension and/or cardiac disorders (e.g.<br>
WO 02/00248), disorders of the stomach and intestine,<br>
such as, for example, inflammatory bowel disease,<br>
premalignant colon adenomas, inflammatory disorders<br>
such as, for example, septic arthritis, osteoarthritis,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, or other disorders such as<br>
osteoporosis, cholesteatoma, disorders of the skin and<br>
the eyes and also viral or bacterial infections, with<br>
reference being made explicitly to the disorders<br>
mentioned in EP-A-0 691 350, EP-A-l 182 207 and US<br>
patent 5,712,291.<br>
The compounds of the general formula I may be prepared,<br>
for example, as in the synthesis schemes in figures 1,<br>
2 and 3.<br>
The compounds of the general formulae II and III may be<br>
prepared, for example, as in the synthesis schemes in<br>
figures 4 and 6.<br>
uPA inhibitors of the invention are preferably<br>
characterized in that they have a bioavailability which<br><br>
is at least 5 times, preferably 10 times, and<br>
particularly preferably 100 times, higher than that of<br>
the corresponding irokinase inhibitors of this class<br>
which have a nonmodafied amidino or guanidino function,<br>
after oral administration.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that the uPA inhibitors of<br>
the invention have not only improved bioavailability<br>
but also a distinctly improved activity to a primary<br>
tumor.<br>
The inventive substances of the formulae I, II and III<br>
may be used alone or in combination with other<br>
physiologically active substances, for example with<br>
radiotherapeutics or with cytotoxic or/and cytostatic<br>
agents, for example chemotherapeutics, such as, for<br>
example, cisplatir, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, taxol<br>
derivatives, or/ard other chemotherapeutic agents, for<br>
example selected from the group consisting of<br>
alkylating agents, antimetabolites, antibiotics,<br>
epidophyllotoxins and vinca alkaloids. A combination<br>
with radiotherapy or/and surgical interventions is also<br>
possible.<br>
The invention provides a process for inhibiting<br>
urokinase in living organisms, in particular humans, by<br>
administering an active amount of at least one compound<br>
of the general formula I, II or/and III. The dose to be<br>
administered depends on the type and severity of the<br>
disorders to be treated. The daily dose, for example,<br>
is in the range from 0.01-100 mg/kg active substance.<br>
Finally, the invention relates to novel inhibitors of<br>
the urokinase plasminogen activator of the general<br>
formulae I, II and III.<br>
The following figures and the examples are intended to<br>
illustrate the invention in more detail.<br><br>

 of compounds WX-671 (figures 1 and 2), WX-683<br>
(figure 3) and WX-678: (figures 4 and 6) .<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1: Preparation of WX-671<br>
1.1 N-Acetyl-3-cyano-(D/L)-phenylalanine<br>
3-Cyanobenzyl bromade (935 g; 4.77 mol) , diethyl<br>
acetamidomalonate (1036 g; 4.77 mol) and potassium<br>
iodide (20 g) were dissolved in 5 1 of dioxane at 98°C<br>
under argon and stirred for 5 h. Subsequently, a<br>
solution of sodium ethoxide (340 g; 5 mmol) in 2 1 of<br>
ethanol was added dropwise over a period of 3 h. This<br>
was followed by adding 4.4 1 of 3M NaOH and stirring at<br>
98°C for another 2 h and then at room temperature (RT)<br>
overnight. The solution was concentrated to ~2 1 under<br>
vacuum, 3 1 of distilled water were added and the<br>
solution was cooled to RT. Adjusting the pH to &gt; 9 was<br>
followed by extracting 3x with 1 1 of ethyl acetate.<br>
The aqueous phase was adjusted to pH 1 with 4M HCl<br>
(approx. 4 1 of 4M Hcl) and extracted 4x with 1.2 1 of<br>
ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were washed<br>
with saturated NaCl, the solvent was evaporated and the<br>
residue was recrystallized from ethyl acetate.<br>
Yield 815 g (3.5 mol) 73%<br>
1.2 3-Cyano-(L)-phenylalanine (resolution of the<br>
racemates)<br>
N-Acetyl-3-cyano-(D/L)-phenylalanine (696 g; 3 mol) was<br>
dissolved in 2 1 of vater and 3 1 of 1M NaOH, the pH<br>
was adjusted to 7.2 with approx. 10 ml of 4M HC1 and<br>
the solution was heated to 37°C. After adding 28 g of<br>
acylase I (Aspergillus Melleus), the solution was<br>
stirred slowly at 370C for 60 h. After filtration of<br>
the resulting precipitate (product), the solution was<br>
concentrated to a volume of approx. 1.5 1 and the<br>
precipitate was filtered off. The combined filter cakes<br>
were suspended in 0.5 1 of water, stirred, filtered<br>

Example 4: In vivo assay of the uPA inhibitor prodrug<br>
WX-671 with regard to tumor spreading, tumor<br>
growth and metastasizing in rats<br>
Breast cancer model<br>
Fragments of 10-25 mm3 of the BN472 breast cancer (Kort<br>
et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst 72, 709-713, 1984) from a<br>
donor animal were implanted underneath the fatty body<br>
of a mammary gland of groups (n = 15 per group) of<br>
female brown Norwegian rats aged 7-8 weeks. The treatments<br>
 started 72 h after tumor implantation and were<br>
repeated daily until the animals were sacrificed after<br>
30 days. The control group (A) received 0.75 ml of the<br>
substance-free substance carrier solution consisting of<br>
5% ethanol, 5% D-mannitol and 5% Tween 20 in water<br>
orally by gavage. The treatment groups (B and C)<br>
received, orally by gavage, either 1 mg/kg (group B) or<br>
5 mg/kg (group C) WK-671 in a volume of 0.7 5 ml of<br>
substance carrier solution. The comparative group D<br>
received 1 mg/kg WX-UK1 dissolved in 5% D-mannitol by<br>
intraperitoneal injection.<br>
Growth of the inoculated tumors was determined in the<br>
dimensions length and width twice weekly, using a slide<br>
gauge. After the animals had been sacrificed, the<br>
therapy end points, tumor weight, weights of the<br>
axillary and intraperitoneal lymph nodes and also the<br>
number of macroscopic lung metastases were determined.<br>
Summary of the results<br>
In all experiments, treatment with WX-671 achieved a<br>
considerable reduction in the size and, respectively,<br>
the weight of the tumors and in the number and,<br>
respectively, mass of metastases, in comparison with<br>
the control group. In the mammary tumor model, the<br>
average tumor weights at the; end of the treatment were<br><br>
reduced in the WX-671-treated group by more than 66%<br>
(p.o.) compared to the control, while an i.p. treatment<br>
with the comparative inhibitor substance WX-UK1<br>
achieved only a reduction by approx. 5%. The number of<br>
lung foci in the inhibitor prodrug-treated groups was<br>
reduced by more than 42% (p.o.) and the average weights<br>
of the axillary lymph nodes by more than 63% (p.o.)<br>
(figure 5) .<br>
The development of bodyweight increase and the<br>
comparison of organ weights between inhibitor- and<br>
vehicle-treated groups gave no indication of a possible<br>
considerable toxicity of the inhibitor under the<br>
conditions described.<br>
Example 5: Preparation and characterization of WX-671<br>
hydrogen sulfate<br>
Preparation<br>
6.0 g of the free base WX-671 were dissolved in 50 ml<br>
of acetone. 1.25 molar equivalents of H2S04 were added<br>
undiluted. The mixture was stirred at room temperature<br>
for 2 h. The hydrogen sulfate crystallized from the<br>
solution. After removing the solvent, the remaining<br>
white solid was dried under vacuum.<br>
Characterization<br>
The solubility of the hydrogen sulfate in water at 25°C<br>
was 1172.5 mg/1 (calculated for the base). The purity<br>
was &gt; 98% (area% afte:: HPLC) .<br>
5 g of hydrogen sulfate were stirred in 25 ml of water/<br>
acetone (80/20) for 7 days, filtered and dried at room<br>
temperature for 60 h. The stoichiometry measured showed<br>
that the salt was stable to dissociation. After<br>
stirring, no increase in the content of organic<br>
contaminations was found (determination by HPLC).<br><br>
After storage as a solid substance at 90 °C for 1 week,<br>
by HPLC).<br>
On the basis of the results above, the hydrogen sulfate<br>
has excellent suitability for the preparation of<br>
pharmaceutical preparations.<br><br><br>
