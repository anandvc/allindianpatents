METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CLOCK CORRECTION IN MIMO OFDM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial<br>
No. 60/792,143 entitled "MIMO OFDM Sample Clock Offset Correction," filed on April 13,2006, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to methods and apparatus for applying phase correction to a receive clock in a communication system. More particularly, the disclosure relates to applying such phase correction in a wireless multiple input/multiple output (MIMO), orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) wireless system requiring a highly accurate clock.<br>
Background<br>
[0003] Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication; for instance, voice and/or data may be provided via such wireless communication systems. A typical wireless data system, or network, provides multiple users access to one or more shared resources. A system may use a variety of multiple access techniques such as Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Code Division Multiplexing (CDM), and others. [0004] Examples of wireless systems that enable various types of communication include Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) such as WLANs that comply with one or more of the IEEE 802.11 standards (e.g., 802.11 (a), (b), or (g)). Additionally, IEEE 802.11(e) has been introduced to improve some of the shortcomings of previous 802.11 standards. For example, 802.11(e) may provide Quality of Service (QoS) improvements.<br>
[0005] The IEEE 802.1 In standard for wireless communications, expected to be finalized in mid-2007, incorporates multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing into the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technology adopted by previous versions of the 802.11 standard. MIMO systems have the<br><br>
advantage of considerably enhanced throughput and/or increased reliability compared to non-multiplexed systems.<br>
[0006] Rather than sending a single serialized data stream from a single transmitting antenna to a single receiving antenna, a MIMO system divides the data stream into multiple unique streams which are modulated and transmitted in parallel at the same time in the same frequency channel, each stream transmitted by its own spatially separated antenna chain. At the receiving end, one or more MIMO receiver antenna chains receives a linear combination of the multiple transmitted data streams, determined by the multiple paths that can be taken by each separate transmission. The data streams are then separated for processing, as described in more detail below. [0007] In general, a MIMO system employs multiple transmit antennas and multiple receive antennas for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by the NT transmit and NR receive antennas may be decomposed into Ns eigenmodes corresponding to independent virtual channels, where Ns S min{//r, NR}.<br>
[0008] In a wireless communication system, data to be transmitted is first modulated onto a radio frequency (RF) carrier signal to generate an RF modulated signal that is more suitable for transmission over a wireless channel. For a MIMO system, up to iV&gt; RF modulated signals may be generated and transmitted simultaneously from the JV&gt; transmit antennas. The transmitted RF modulated signals may reach the NR receive antennas via a number of propagation paths in the wireless channel. The relationship of the received signals to the transmitted signals may be described as follows:<br>
SR = HST + n	Eq.(l)<br>
where SR is a complex vector of NR components corresponding to the signals received at each  of the NR receive  antennas;  Sj  is  a complex  vector of NT components corresponding to the signals transmitted at each of the NT transmit antennas; H is a NR X NT matrix whose components represent the complex coefficients that describe the amplitude of the signal from each transmitting antenna received at each receiving antenna; and n is a vector representing the noise received at each receiving antenna. [0009] The characteristics of the propagation paths typically vary over time due to a number of factors such as, for example, fading, multipath, and external interference. Consequently, the transmitted RF modulated signals may experience different channel conditions (e.g., different fading and multipath effects) and may be associated with<br><br>
different complex gains and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In equation (1), these characteristics are encoded in matrix H.<br>
[0010] In many wireless communication systems, one or more reference signals, known as pilot tones, are transmitted by the transmitter to assist the receiver in performing a number of functions. The receiver may use the pilot tones for estimating channel response, as well as for other functions including timing and frequency acquisition, data demodulation, and others. In general, one or more pilot tones are transmitted with parameters that are known to the receiver. By comparing the amplitude and phase of the received pilot tone to the known transmission parameters of the pilot tone, the receiving processor can compute channel parameters, allowing it to compensate for noise and errors in the transmitted data stream. Use of pilot tones is discussed further in United States Patent No. 6,928,062, titled "Uplink pilot and signaling transmission in wireless communication systems," the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0011] Embodiments of aspects of the disclosure include methods and apparatus that improve the signal to noise ration (SNR) in wireless communication systems employing, for example, MIMO and OFDM methods. The inventors have found that improving the phase accuracy of the receive clock in such systems, relative to the transmit clock, helps produce such an improvement. One way to improve the phase accuracy of the receive clock is to first, measure the frequency error in the receive clock relative to a received signal, and remove the measured error from the received signal; and, second, measure and remove a residual phase slope during data-carrying portions of the received signal.<br>

According to one variation, adjusting comprises adjusting based upon a moving average of the phase slope. In another variation, measuring further comprises:<br><br>
removing an average pilot phase from received pilot symbols; forming conjugates of received pilot symbols; combining the conjugates with the received pilot symbols; weighting the combined conjugates and received pilot symbols; computing angle information; and wherein adjusting further comprises: correcting packets received during a burst including the received pilot symbols using the angle information. [0013] According to aspects of another embodiment, apparatus performs a method of phase correction in a wireless device including: estimating a phase slope for an OFDM symbol in a data portion of a packet based on an elapsed time from the start of the packet; measuring a residual phase slope from tracking pilots for the OFDM symbol in the data portion of the packet; and adjusting a phase correction based upon the phase slope and the residual phase slope. According to one variation, adjusting comprises adjusting based upon a moving average of the phase slope. In another variation, measuring further comprises: removing an average pilot phase from received pilot symbols; forming conjugates of received pilot symbols; combining the conjugates with the received pilot symbols; weighting the combined conjugates and received pilot symbols; computing angle information; and wherein adjusting further comprises: correcting packets received during a burst including the received pilot symbols using the angle information.<br>
[0014] According to aspects of yet another embodiment, a machine-readable medium carries instructions for carrying out a method of phase correction in a wireless device including: estimating a phase slope for an OFDM symbol in a data portion of a packet based on an elapsed time from the start of the packet; measuring a residual phase slope from tracking pilots for the OFDM symbol in the data portion of the packet; and adjusting a phase correction based upon the phase slope and the residual phase slope. According to one variation, adjusting comprises adjusting based upon a moving average of the phase slope. In another variation, measuring further comprises: removing an average pilot phase from received pilot symbols; forming conjugates of received pilot symbols; combining the conjugates with the received pilot symbols; weighting the combined conjugates and received pilot symbols; computing angle information; and wherein adjusting further comprises: correcting packets received during a burst including the received pilot symbols using the angle information.<br><br>

The term "machine-readable medium" can include, without being limited to, wireless channels and various other media capable of storing, containing, and/or carrying instruction(s) and/or data. [0028] Referring now to Fig. 1, a wireless communication system 100 is illustrated in accordance with various aspects set forth herein. System 100 includes an Access Point (AP) 104 that is communicatively coupled to one or more User Terminals (UTs) 106i -106N, where N may be any positive integer. In accordance with 802.11 terminology, AP 104 and UTs 106i - 106Nare also referred to as stations or STAs herein. AP 104 and UTs 106i - 106N communicate via Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) 120.

Access point 104 communicates with any number of external devices or processes via network 102. Network 102 may be the Internet, an intranet, or any other wired, wireless, or optical network. Connection 110 carries signals from the network 102 to the access point 104. Devices or processes may be connected to network 102 or as UTs 106] - 106N (or via connections therewith) on WLAN 120.

Processes may include voice, video, data communications, etc. Various data streams may have varying transmission requirements, which may be accommodated by using varying QoS techniques. [0029J System 100 may be deployed with a centralized AP 104. All UTs 106i - 106N may communicate with AP 104 according to an example. Additionally or alternatively, two or more of the UTs 106i - 106N may communicate via direct peer-to-peer communication {e.g., employing Direct Link Set-Up (DLS) associated with 802.11(e)). Access may be managed by AP 104 and/or may be ad hoc {e.g., contention based). [0030] The receiver of an MIMO OFDM system uses a sample clock, sometimes referred to herein as a receive clock, to recover symbols from a received stream of message packets. Symbols are discriminated on the basis of very precise differences in phase and/or frequency of OFDM tones. The sample clock at the receiver of an MIMO<br><br>
OFDM system is not locked to the transmitter clock, so the phase and frequency information recovered from the received packet using the sample clock will always include a small, not infinitesimal, error, which may vary over the received packet. One effect of the error between the receiver and transmitter is a phase slope which appears across the OFDM tones. If the phase slope is not properly removed the receiver performance will suffer; this is especially true for long packets and higher order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulations, i.e., one with many tones closely spaced within the phase frequency constellation, often found in MIMO OFDM based systems. The problem manifests as an inability to distinguish tones that are spatially close within the constellations of allowed tones. The advantage to properly removing the phase slope is that the MIMO OFDM system is capable of operating at higher order QAM modulations (i.e., larger constellation of tones) at lower SNRs and therefore can achieve higher overall throughput.<br>
[0031] Two exemplary methods for measurement of timing drift for an OFDM system include: (i) determining the phase slope observed on pilot subcarriers; or (ii) drift of the correlation peak derived from the product of the cyclic prefix with the conjugate of the corresponding samples at the end of the associated OFDM symbol. [0032] In certain aspects, to correct for the phase slope a phase correction based on two phase slope estimates may be applied. The first estimate may be a combination of measured carrier frequency offset (CFO) and the carrier frequency to determine the clock offset. An estimated phase slope can then be computed for each OFDM symbol based on the elapsed time from the start of the packet. The measurement of the carrier frequency and CFO are susceptible to some error. However, any error in the carrier frequency measurement will result in an error in the estimated phase slope, which may then be corrected by measuring a residual phase slope from the tracking pilots on each OFDM symbol of the data portion of the packet. In further aspects, a moving average of the phase slope, to improve performance for long packets, may also be utilized. An advantage of using carrier measurements is that the estimate can be made before or during the data portion of transmission.<br>
[0033] In some aspects, the carrier frequency offset measurement may be made during the preamble portion of the packet to formulate an estimate of the time drift and apply that estimate on each OFDM symbol during the data portion of the packet. Further, the<br><br>
CFO measurement provides greater accuracy in determining the time drift than a direct measurement since the carrier frequency is much higher than the system bandwidth (or equivaiently the sample clock rate). For example, a simple frequency offset measurement can determine the frequency error to within +/- 1kHz. For a 2.4GHz carrier frequency system this is equivalent to an error of 0.4ppm. To achieve the same accuracy by a time-domain measurement would require measurement of 0.4nsec of drift over a 1msec packet, which is a much more difficult task.<br>
[0034] By removing the estimated phase slope based on the CFO measured during the preamble and subsequently removing any residual phase slope based on a measurement of the phase slope between the two outer pilots (tones +/- 21) an example MIMO OFDM system shows no performance degradation due to sampling frequency offset allowing the use of high order QAM modulations. Indeed, the phase slope is reduced to well below the 0.4 ppm that carrier frequency measurements alone would produce. [0035] Further, in some aspects, the above approach may be implemented utilizing a minimum of hardware, including in particular a sine/cosine look up table, a cordic function and multiplier/adder blocks. Such a structure is now explained. [0036] Fig. 2 illustrates a structure for a phase correction process, 200, having timing, 201, in accordance with one or more aspects.<br>
[0037] In the structure of Fig. 2, a frequency offset taken to be roughly constant over a burst of data is first multiplied, 202, by an elapsed time since the beginning of a packet, for example in 4(xsec increments. The result is an estimated phase slope at the point in time. This estimated phase slope is then multiplied, 203, by a phase slope correction, referred to as a residual phase slope and derived as now described. [0038] The output of a spatial multiply performed by a spatial processor (SPROC) is multiplied, 204, by a sin/cos value related to the total phase offset to be removed. The result is a phase corrected output that forms the output, and is also fed back to a module, 205, which removes the tracking pilot tone modulation. After removing the pilot tone modulation, the local oscillator (LO) phase offset is computed, 206. Next, the residual phase slope is computed from the LO phase offset, 207, for example using CORDIC plus slope averaging. As indicated above, the residual phase slope is multiplied, 203, by the estimated phase slope. The result is a total phase slope, which is then multiplied, 208, by a tone index, for example an integer between -26 and +26 in an exemplary<br><br>
embodiment, to produce a timing-adjusted phase value which changes from tone to tone.<br>
[0039] Finally, the LO phase offset is summed with the timing-adjusted phase value, modulo 2n, 209, to produce a phase offset. The phase offset is applied to a sin/cos look¬up table, to produce a sin/cos value applied to multiplier 204. [0040] As mentioned above, the sample clock at the receiver is not locked to the transmitter clock, so timing drifts over the received packet. For example, if the packet is 2 milliseconds long and the clock error is 40ppm (20 ppm at each end), then a drift of 80 nanoseconds or 1.6 samples occurs over a packet according to 802.11 framing. This is still small relative to the cyclic prefix, so adjustment of the FFT window is not necessary; however, with a shortened cyclic prefix, the FFT window should preferably be adjusted once slippage of 0.5 samples has occurred.<br>
[0041] The described timing drift results in a phase slope across the OFDM tones. A one-sample timing slip results in almost 180 degree shifts for the tones at the edge of the band. To correct for this phase slope the measured frequency offset relative to the carrier frequency is used to determine the clock offset. Then an estimated slope can be computed for each OFDM symbol based on the elapsed time from the start of the packet.<br>
[0042] The frequency measurement inevitably includes an error. The error in the frequency measurement results in an error in the phase slope correction. This error is not very great, and is significant only when a relatively large frequency error occurs on a long packet and in a system using a high order QAM constellation. According to one aspect, the residual phase slope is determined from the tracking pilots. Since the outer pilots (tones +/-21) have 3 times the error due to phase slope, only these are used in the phase slope computation.<br>
[0043] Once the mean pilot phase, as determined by the frequency measurement, is removed from the outer pilots (and the pilot scramble sign and pilot 21 inversion is corrected), the outer pilots are roughly ae!x and be'jx + noise. Therefore, equal gain combining, or other approaches, may be utilized to combine the conjugate of one pilot with the other pilot and obtain a complex value, p,<br>
P = P2\+P-i\=(a + b)eix + n » where n is noise.<br><br>
[0044] Since the phase, x, is quite small we average this complex value over a number of symbols. In simulation a simple one pole filter was used to generate an averaged,<br>
Pavei Pave = °P + (1 -CI)Pave  &gt;<br>
where a is 2'4,2"5, or 2"6.<br>
[0045] In certain aspects, the averaging may be performed on the complex value, not the phase. In this way a large noise value which decreases the amplitude of p does not degrade the performance. Then the phase slope correction (per tone phase slope) is the angle of pave divided by 21. The angle is determined by a CORDIC algorithm. [0046] In certain aspects the above approach may be embodied as shown in Fig. 5 and described as follows:<br>
501.	Remove average pilot phase from pilots p2i and p. 2i. This involves multiplying by the same phase correction factor which is used on the data tones for this OFDM symbol. (But this is not time critical, so a simpler complex multiply may be used if desired.)<br>
502.	Add P21 to the conjugate of p-2], weight these and add in to pave-<br>
503.	Compute the angle of pave and divide by 21.<br>
504.	Use this phase slope correction value for the data tones, probably on the next OFDM symbol. The delay is not critical, since averaging extends over ~32 OFDM symbols.<br>
[0047] The block diagram of Fig. 3 illustrates an implementation of a phase correction process in accordance with one or more aspects. Adaptive phase slope correction is a part of the overall exemplary time tracking processing. The end result of the process is the application of a phase correction applied at the output of a spatial processor (SPROC) on each OFDM subcarrier of the data portion of the packet. [0048] In accordance with the block diagram of Fig. 3, the structure of Fig. 2 is implemented using only two multiplexers, 301, 302, and one 16x16 multiplier, 303, along with several other components, all controlled by a simple state machine (not shown). This implementation is now described in greater detail.<br><br>
[0049] The first multiplexer, 301, selects between inputs of the constant frequency offset, the residual phase slope and the LO phase offset, the selected one of which is one input to the multiplier, 303. The second multiplexer, 302, selects between inputs of the elapsed time, C2i2nwA c2n. Using suitable inputs, the multiplier, 303, produces the estimated phase slope and the residual phase slope values, which are fed to adder, 304. They are added to produce a total estimated phase slope, which is multiplied by the tone value using a shift and add, 305, to produce the tone adjusted phase {see also, Fig. 2, the signal between multiplier 208 and adder 209). The tone adjusted phase is fed to a sin/cos look-up table (LUT), 306, whose output is passed to a complex multiplier, 307, having a second input received from the SPROC.<br>
[0050] The complex multiplier output, 307, may be used for the residual phase calculation, 308, 311, the LO phase calculation, 309, 310, or directly fed to the decoder as phase corrected data.<br>
[0051] In the case of the residual phase calculation, first the tracking pilot sign bit is removed and the four tracking pilot values are summed, 308. The result is fed to the CORDIC block, 311, which computes the LO phase offset input to the first multiplexer, 301.<br>
[0052] In the case of the LO phase calculation, the sum of the values oip2i and the conjugate ofp.21 is computed, 309, the value of Pave is updated, 310, and the result is fed to the CORDIC block, 311. The CORDIC block, 311, then computes the residual phase slope input to the first multiplexer, 301.<br>
[0053] In certain aspects, during the preamble portion of the packet the CFO is measured. This CFO is applied through a NCO working on the time domain signals in order to remove a single constant frequency offset between the transmitter and receiver clocks. In some aspects, time tracking, which may also be referred to as phase correction, processing involves the computation of a phase correction at each subcarrier during the data portion of the packet to compensate for the sampling frequency errors associated with 1) the local oscillator (LO) phase offset, e.g. the phase noise; and 2) the phase slope.<br>
[0054] The (complex I/Q) QAM symbols coming for the SPROC block are multiplied (on a tone-by-tone basis) with the computed phase correction factor (complex I/Q) and then sent to our decoder block. The necessary phase correction factors are computed<br><br>
before the information tones are sent through the spatial processor allowing the phase correction to be applied without additional system delay. [0055] Processing steps for each OFDM symbol in the data portion of the packet, shown in Fig. 6, is discussed below, according to an aspect:<br>
601.	Estimated phase slope is computed once per OFDM symbol by multiplying the CFO with the elapsed time from the start of the burst.<br>
602.	The estimated phase slope is multiplied (using shifts and adds) with the corresponding tone index for each of the four pilot tones (p.21, p.7, P7, P21) and the results are fed into sin/cos LUT.<br>
603.	The outputs of the sin/cos LUT are then used to correct the phase of the tracking pilots which have been processed by the SPROC and are passed in order to the phase correction block.<br>
604.	The phase corrected tracking pilots are summed (first removing the tracking pilot modulation on tone P21) and fed into the CORDIC function to compute the average tracking pilot phase (also known as the LO phase offset).<br>
605.	The sum of the estimated phase slope and the residual phase slope (see 608-611 below) are multiplied (using shifts and adds) with the corresponding tone index for each of the data tones to compute a time adjusted phase.<br>
606.	The timing adjusted phase is summed with the LO phase offset (modulo 2TC) and fed into the sin/cos LUT.<br>
607.	The outputs of the sin/cos LUT are then used to correct the phase of the information tones which have been processed by the SPROC and are passed in order to the phase correction block.<br>
608.	While the information tones are being processed, we compute the updated residual phase slope as described in the following steps.<br>
609.	Remove the estimated phase slope and average pilot phase from pilots P21 and p.21. To do this compute a new phase corrected output for the two<br><br>
pilots based on the pre-computed timing adjusted phase (602 above) and the LO phase offset for this OFDM symbol. This involves a new sin/cos LUT for each pilot and a complex multiply with the pilot data.<br>
610.	Add P21 to the conjugate of p.21, weight these and add in to pave.<br>
611.	Compute the angle of pave and divide by 21 (using a multiply and a power of two shift).<br>
612.	Use this phase slope correction value (also know as residual phase slope) for the data tones on the next OFDM symbol (605 above). The delay is not critical, since averaging extends over at least 32 OFDM symbols.<br>
[0056] The details of an exemplary hardware implementation are outlined in a block diagram in Fig. 3. The implementation consists of an eight-step state machine that allows the sharing of a 16x16 real multiplier, a CORDIC block, a sin/cos LUT and a 16x16 complex multiplier. The real multiplier is used for 3 operations; the computation of the estimated phase slope (CFO x elapsed time), the scaling of the LO phase offset into cycles, and the scaling of the residual phase offset into cycles, including the divide by 21.<br>
[0057] Fig. 4 shows an exemplary wireless communication system 1300. The wireless communication system 1300 depicts one access point and one terminal for sake of brevity. However, it is to be appreciated that the system can include more than one access point and/or more than one terminal, wherein additional access points and/or terminals can be substantially similar or different for the exemplary access point and terminal described below.<br>
[0058] Referring now to Fig. 4, on a downlink, at access point 1305, a transmit (TX) data processor 1310 receives, formats, codes, interleaves, and modulates (or symbol maps) traffic data and provides modulation symbols ("data symbols"). A symbol modulator 1315 receives and processes the data symbols and pilot symbols and provides a stream of symbols. A symbol modulator 1315 multiplexes data and pilot symbols and provides them to a transmitter unit (TMTR) 1320. Each transmit symbol may be a data symbol, a pilot symbol, or a signal value of zero. The pilot symbols may be sent continuously in each symbol period. The pilot symbols can be frequency division<br><br>
multiplexed (FDM), orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM), time division multiplexed (TDM), frequency division multiplexed (FDM), or code division multiplexed (CDM).<br>
[0059] TMTR 1320 receives and converts the stream of symbols into one or more analog signals and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters, and frequency upconverts) the analog signals to generate a downlink signal suitable for transmission over the wireless channel. The downlink signal is then transmitted through an antenna 1325 to the terminals. At terminal 1330, an antenna 1335 receives the downlink signal and provides a received signal to a receiver unit (RCVR) 1340. Receiver unit 1340 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and frequency downconverts) the received signal and digitizes the conditioned signal to obtain samples. A symbol demodulator 1345 demodulates and provides received pilot symbols to a processor 1350 for channel estimation. Symbol demodulator 1345 further receives a frequency response estimate for the downlink from processor 1350, performs data demodulation on the received data symbols to obtain data symbol estimates (which are estimates of the transmitted data symbols), and provides the data symbol estimates to an RX data processor 1355, which demodulates (/. e., symbol demaps), deinterleaves, and decodes the data symbol estimates to recover the transmitted traffic data. The processing by symbol demodulator 1345 and RX data processor 1355 is complementary to the processing by symbol modulator 1315 and TX data processor 1310, respectively, at access point 1305. [0060] On the uplink, a TX data processor 1360 processes traffic data and provides data symbols. A symbol modulator 1365 receives and multiplexes the data symbols with pilot symbols, performs modulation, and provides a stream of symbols. A transmitter unit 1370 then receives and processes the stream of symbols to generate an uplink signal, which is transmitted by the antenna 1335 to the access point 1305. [0061] At access point 1305, the uplink signal from terminal 1330 is received by the antenna 1325 and processed by a receiver unit 1375 to obtain samples. A symbol demodulator 1380 then processes the samples and provides received pilot symbols and data symbol estimates for the uplink. An RX data processor 1385 processes the data symbol estimates to recover the traffic data transmitted by terminal 1330. A processor 1390 performs channel estimation for each active terminal transmitting on the uplink.<br><br>
Multiple terminals may transmit pilot concurrently on the uplink on their respecting assigned sets of pilot subbands, where the pilot subband sets may be interlaced. [0062] Processors 1390 and 1350 direct (e.g., control, coordinate, manage, etc.) operation at access point 1305 and terminal 1330, respectively. Respective processors 1390 and 1350 can be associated with memory units (not shown) that store program codes and data. Processors 1390 and 1350 can also perform computations to derive frequency and impulse response estimates for the uplink and downlink, respectively. Further, processors 1390 and 1350 may perform the phase corrections as described herein, e.g. with respect to Figs. 1-3, based upon instructions contained in memory. [0063] Another technique, referred to as decision-directed phase estimation can be used, with or without separate frequency correction as described above. Decision-directed phase estimation also doe a coarse correction followed by a fine correction. Decision-directed phase estimation is now described.<br>
[0064] In a MIMO OFDM system, each data OFDM symbol contains data subcarriers and pilot subcarriers. The pilot subcarriers carry symbols that are known to both the transmitter and the receiver. The phase estimate may be obtained from the pilot symbol by demodulating the received signal and comparing the received symbol estimate to the known transmitted symbol, as follows:<br>
where <br>
•	p is the known transmitted pilot symbol,<br>
•	p is the estimate of the pilot symbol at the receiver, and<br>
•	9 is the estimate of the phase.<br>
•	When more than one pilot symbol is available, the dot products of the known and received symbols are summed over all dimensions, where a dimension may be a subcarrier, a spatial stream, etc. For example, if an OFDM symbol contains Np pilot symbols, the phase estimate would be obtained as follows:<br><br><br><br>
where N'PilolSlreams (k) is the number of pilot streams on subcarrier index k. The number<br>
of pilot streams may be one, equal to the number of data streams, max(number of transmit antennas, number of receive antennas), or independent of all these parameters. The number of pilot streams may vary from subcarrier to subcarrier or from OFDM symbol to OFDM symbol. In a SISO system, the number of pilot streams is one. [0066] The number of pilot symbols is typically much smaller than the number of data symbols. Thus, it is possible to improve the estimate of the phase by using the data symbols. The data symbols are not known at the receiver; however, the receiver can obtain an estimate of the transmitted symbols by demodulating the received data and making hard decisions on the demodulated symbols. That is, the receiver makes a decision based on the best estimate it can made as to which symbol is has received. The hard decisions are then compared to the demodulated symbols, and the phase estimate is determined in the same manner as for the pilot symbols. For example, if an OFDM<br>
symbol contains    s data symbols, the phase estimate would be obtained as follows:<br>
where <br>
•	st is the estimate of the received symbol (obtained by MMSE receiver, for<br>
example) and<br>
•	5, is the hard decision made on £,.<br>
[0067] Hard decisions may be made because the data rate (and thus, the constellation<br>
used) is known.<br>
[0068] In a MIMO OFDM system, the number of data symbols is the sum of all data<br>
streams over all data subcarriers (   Daasubcamers y<br><br><br>
where the summations are made over all dimensions, that is, summations are made over all subcarriers and spatial streams. Scaling factors //, and a, are applied to the ^*i, and<br>
p\pi terms, respectively, to account for differences in signal to noise ratio (SNR) and<br>
errors in making the hard decisions that may vary from symbol to symbol. These factors depend generally on the SNR and QAM constellation in use, but may also vary with such other parameters as the skilled artisan may find useful. Incorrect decisions regarding the determination of s, can still bias the result. Better scaling may be<br>
achieved by separating the terms S S and p1 pt into their Real and Imaginary parts and applying complex scale factors having both Real and Imaginary parts, ReQx,), lm(^t,), Re(ai) and Im(a,), allowing errors in the determination of st to be removed by adjusting<br>
the relative scaling of Real and Imaginary components of the term.<br>
[0070] On each OFDM symbol, the phase estimate is obtained as described above, and<br><br>
the received signal is corrected by e     on all subcarriers and streams. Following the phase correction, the data subcarriers are demodulated (using MMSE receiver, as an example) and decoded to obtain bit decisions.<br>
[0071] The phase offset caused by an error in the frequency offset estimate causes a phase slope over time. Thus, at each OFDM symbol, a running total of all previous phase corrections is kept:<br><br><br>
A<br>
where 0tolal is initialized to zero at the first OFDM symbol. On each OFDM symbol,<br>
prior to MMSE demodulation and making hard decisions, the received signal is<br>
corrected by e~je'°al.<br>
[0072] A flowchart of the phase estimation and correction process, shown in Fig. 7,<br>
may be summarized in the following procedure:<br>
A<br>
701.	Initialization: 6total - 0, OFDM symbol index n = 0.<br>
702.	Correct received OFDM symbol by e~J8,Ml.<br>
703.	Demodulate pilot symbols, obtain dot product sum of the known transmitted and estimated pilot symbols over all dimensions.<br>
704.	Demodulate data symbols, perform hard decisions on the estimated symbols, obtain dot product sum of hard decisions and estimated symbols over all dimensions.<br>
705.	Sum the complex numbers obtained in 703 and 704, and obtain phase of the<br>
A<br>
resulting complex number, 6.<br>
706.	Correct received OFDM symbol by inverse of the phase, demodulate<br>
(MMSE) data symbols, and decode.<br><br>
[0073] Note that each symbol is phase-corrected and decoded twice, 702-704 and 705-<br>
706.<br>
[0074] The above phase estimation technique was described for the case when a<br>
residual frequency offset error causes a phase slope over time. However, this method<br>
may also be used for phase error that does not grow in time, but is a random walk from<br>
one OFDM symbol to the next, such as phase noise. Furthermore, the technique may be<br>
used with multiple streams and varying rates on the streams.<br>
[0075] The above method requires the data symbols to be demodulated twice.<br>
Assuming a small residual frequency error, the phase obtained on OFDM symbol n may<br>
be applied to OFDM symbol n + 1. Thus, the current OFDM symbol would only be<br>
/}	A<br>
corrected by   "&gt;'al and not corrected by #. To obtain a correction on the initial OFDM<br><br>
symbol, a phase estimate would be obtained from the OFDM symbol immediately preceding the data portion of the packet, such as the MIMO training. [0076] The reduced-complexity phase estimation and correction procedure, shown in Fig. 8, would thus be:<br>
801.	Initialization:<br>
A	A	A<br>
•	@totai ~ @Pre' where 0pre is the phase estimate obtained from the OFDM symbol immediately preceding the data,<br>
•	OFDM symbol index n = 0.<br><br>
802.	Correct received OFDM symbol by e_A""".<br>
803.	Demodulate pilot symbols, obtain dot product sum of the known transmitted and estimated pilot symbols over all dimensions.<br>
804.	Demodulate data symbols, perform hard decisions on the estimated symbols, obtain dot product sum of hard decisions and estimated symbols over all dimensions.<br>
805.	Sum the complex numbers obtained in 803 and 804, and obtain phase of the<br>
A<br>
resulting complex number, 9.<br>
806.	Decode demodulated data symbols from 804.<br><br>
[0077] Again, each symbol is phase-corrected and decoded twice, 802-804 and 805-806.<br>
[0078] When eigensteering is used at the transmitter, the multiple spatial channels created have varying SNRs. As a result, the best way to obtain a phase estimate is by doing maximal ratio combining (MRC) based on the SNRs on the different streams. This technique is general and works with any transmission scheme; when the SNRs on all streams are equal, this technique reduces to that described immediately above. [0079] One way to do MRC is to combine over spatial streams on a per-subcarrier basis. As a result, all subcarriers are treated equally. For an OFDM symbol that contains both data and pilot symbols, the phase estimate is obtained by using information from both sources, as follows:<br><br><br>
where ys (/) is the is the SNR on the data symbol on dimension /' and yP (i) is the SNR on the pilot symbol on dimension /. This phase estimate also includes scale factors applied to the S S, and p1 pi terms, which may be similarly understood and varied as<br>
described in paragraph [0069],<br>
[0081] For an OFDM symbol that contains both data and pilot symbols, the phase<br>
estimate is obtained by using information from both sources, as follows:<br><br>
where the summation is performed over all data symbol subcarriers and pilot symbol subcarriers, and only the highest-mode symbols (denoted by the subscript 0) are used.<br><br>
[0082] Since the SNRs on the different streams are different, another way to obtain a phase estimate is to use the highest-SNR symbols, which, in the case of eigensteering, corresponds to using the symbols transmitted on the principal eigenmode. [0083] The techniques described herein may be implemented by various means. For example, these techniques may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof.
