It is also possible to use hydrogen peroxide or a periodate (sodium periodate for example), in an inert solvent such as 1-4C aliphatic alcohol (methanol or ethanol for example), water or a mixture of these solvents, at a temperature of between 0 and 20°C. It is also possible to carry out the procedure using tert-butyl hydroperoxide in the presence of titanium tetraisopropoxide in a 1--4C aliphatic alcohol (methanol or ethanol for example) or a water-alcohol mixture, at a temperature close to 25°C or using oxoneR(potassium peroxymonosulfate), in a 1-4C aliphatic alcohol (methanol or ethanol for example), in the presence of water, acetic acid or sulfuric acid, at a temperature close to 20°C.<br>

carried out in DMSO, using the sulfurtrioxide-pyridine complex, at a temperature close to 20°C or using dimethyl sulfoxide, in the presence of oxalyl chloride and triethylamine, at a temperature of between -70 and -50°C.<br>
In step E, the procedure is carried out according to the method described by GRISAR M. et al., in J. Med. Chem., 885 (1973). The magnesium compound of<br>
the brominated derivative is formed and then the nitrile is reacted, in an ether such as ethyl ether, at a temperature of between 0°C and the boiling temperature of the reaction medium.

It is understood for persons skilled in the art that, to carry out the processes according to the invention which are described above, it may be necessary to introduce groups protecting amino, hydroxyl and carboxyl functions in order to avoid side reactions. These groups are those which allow removal<br>
without affecting the rest of the molecule. As examples of groups protecting the amino function, there may be mentioned tert-butyl or methylcarbamates which may be regenerated using iodotrimethylsilane or allyl using palladium catalysts. As examples of groups protecting the hydroxyl function, there may be mentioned triethylsilyl and tert-butyldimethylsilyl which may be regenerated using tetrabutylammonium fluoride or alternatively asymmetric acetals (methoxymethyl or tetrahydropyranyl for example) with regeneration using hydrochloric acid. As groups protecting carboxyl functions, there may be mentioned esters (allyl or benzyl for example), oxazoles and 2-alkyl-l,3-oxazolines. Other protecting groups which can be used are described by GREENE T.W. et al., Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, second edition, 1991, John Wiley &amp; Sons.<br>

The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting it.<br>
Example 1<br>
0.3 cm3 of methanesulfonyl chloride is added to a solution of 1 g of 1-benzhydryl-3-[(methylsulfonyl)(phenyl)methyl-(RS)]azetidin-3-ol in<br>
10 cm3 of pyridine, cooled to 5°C. The mixture is stirred for 2 hours at 5°C and then 1 g of 4-dimethylaminopyridine is added in 10 cm3 of dichloromethane at 5°C. The solution is stirred for 15 hours at room temperature and then concentrated to a dryness under reduced pressure (2.7 kPa). The residue obtained is chomatographed on a silica gel column (particle size 0.04-0.06 mm, diameter 3 cm, height 25 cm), eluting at a nitrogen pressure of 0.5 bar with dichloromethane and collecting 80 cm3 fractions. Fractions 17 to 20 are combined and then concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure (2.7 kPa). The residue is crystallized from 10 cm3 of ethyl ether. 0.14 g of 1-benzhydryl-<br>
3-[(methylsulfonyl)(phenyl)methylene]azetidine is obtained melting at 210°C [NMR spectrum in DMSO-d6, T=300K, 5 in ppm (300 MHz): 2.95 (3H, s, SCH3), 3.80 (2H, s, NCH,), 4.20 (2H, s, NCH,), 4.75 (1H, s, NCH) , 7.20 (2H, t, J=7Hz, 2CH arom.), 7.30 (4H, t, J=7Hz, 4CH arom.), between 7.40 and 7.60 (9H, m, 9 CH arom.)]. l-Benzhydryl-3-[(methylsulfonyl)(phenyl)-methyl-(RS)]azetidin-3-ol may be obtained in the following manner: 6.25 cm3 of 1.6 N n-butyllithium in solution in hexane are added to a solution of 1.4 cm3 of diisopropylamine in 10 cm3 of tetrahydrofuran, under an argon atmosphere, cooled to 0°C, and then the mixture is cooled to -70°C. A mixture of 1.7 g of benzyl methyl<br>
sulfone in 30 cm3 of tetrahydrofuran are then added and the stirring is maintained for 45 minutes at -70°C. 2.4 g of l-benzhydrylazetidin-3-one are added and then the mixture is stirred for 20 minutes while allowing the mixture to return to room temperature. The reaction mixture is filtered and then concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure (2.7 kPa). The residue is taken up in 50 cm3 of ethyl acetate, 30 cm of water and 20 cm3 of normal hydrochloric acid. The precipitate is filtered, washed with 30 cm3 of distilled water, drained and dried. 2 g of 1-benzhydryl-<br>
3-[(methylsulfonyl)(phenyl)methyl-(RS)]azetidin-3-ol are obtained melting at 260°C.<br>
l-Benzhydrylazetidin-3-one may be prepared according to the procedure described by KATRITZKY A.R. et al. in J. Heterocycl. Chem., 271 (1994).<br>
Example 2<br>
On carrying out the operation according to the procedure of Example 1 starting with 1.9 g of l-benzhydryl-3-[(3-methylphenyl)(methylsulfonyl)methyl-(RS)]azetidin-3-ol, 0.52 cm3 of methanesulfonyl chloride and 1.7 g of 4-dimethylaminopyridine, the residue obtained is purified by chromatography on a silica gel column (particle size 0.04-0.06 mm, diameter 3 cm, height 17 cm) at a nitrogen pressure of 0.5 bar with<br>
dichloromethane and then a dichloromethane and ethanol mixture (98.5/1.5 by volume) as eluents and collecting 100 cm3 fractions. Fractions 5 and 6 are combined and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure (2.7 kPa).
