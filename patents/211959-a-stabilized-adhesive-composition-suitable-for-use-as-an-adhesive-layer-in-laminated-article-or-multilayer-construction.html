STABILIZED ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING HIGHLY SOLUBLE. HIGH EXTINCTION. PHOTOSTABLE HYDROXYPHENYL-s-TRIAZINE UV ABSORBERS AND<br>
LAMINATED ARTICLES DERIVED THEREFROM<br>
This invention pertains to stabilized adhesive compositions containing an effective amount of a s-triazine UV absorber or mixtures of s-triazine UV absorbers such as 2,4-bis (2,4-dimethylphenyl)-6-[2-hydroxy-4-(3-nonyloxy’-2-hydroxypropyloxy)-5-a-cumylphenyl]-s-triazine (‘ denotes a mixture of octyloxy, nonyloxy and decyloxy groups) having very high molar extinction values, enhanced solubility and excellent photostability.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Adhesives are made up of various components such as polymers, pacifiers, waxes and oils. Adhesive formulations based on these ingredients are susceptible to degradation. The consequences of degradation are discoloration, loss of elongation, loss of tensile strength, loss of tack and change in viscosity, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Degradation can be caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight. Sunlight contains invisible ultraviolet (UV) radiation with wavelengths between 290 and 400 nm. This radiation is responsible for the initiation of photodegradation.<br>
Absorption of UV light by chromophores present in the adhesive formulation transforms the chromophores into their excited states which can undergo further undesired reactions. Some polymers contain strongly absorbing chromophores as a major part of their structures. Other polymers contain unintentional impurities such as ketones and hydroperoxide moieties and catalyst residues which act as chromophores. Absorption of UV radiation by these chromophores eventually results in bond cleavage, chain scission and/or crosslinking reactions.<br>
Photostabilization of adhesives can be achieved by the addition of UV absorbers which convert the absorbed energy into harmless heat. An ideal UV absorber should be extremely photostable and have increased absorption over the UV range from 290 to 400 nm, but particularly the range of 350 to 400 nm. Classes of UV absorbers include the calculates, cyanoacrylates, ammoniates, oxanilides, benzophenones, s-treasons and benzotriazoles.<br><br>
Salicylates, cyanoacrylates, malonates and oxanilides absorb UV light primarily at the lower wavelengths of the UV range. These compounds have little to no absorption in the range of 350 to 400 nm which make them unsuitable for the instant applications. Benzophenones absorb over the lower half of the UV range, and they tend to be prone to yellowing upon light exposure due to photodegradation. Recently, it has been shown photochemically that benzophenones decompose prematurely in ethylene-vinyl acetate encapsulates which lead to the production of polemic chromophores. This color generation from light yellow to brown is not only highly undesirable and unsightly in adhesive systems, but also can results in a loss of adhesive properties. By contrast, selected s-triazine UV absorbers are particularly useful because of their increased photostability.<br>
Some polymers such as polycarbonates, polyesters and aromatic polyurethanes contain strongly absorbing chromophores as a major and integral part of their structures. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate) (PEN) are particular examples the latter of which absorbs into the red UV region and especially need red-shifted s-triazines for UV protection. Adding an adhesive UV screening layer containing the s-triazines especially those described in the instant invention, further protects such polymers in multilayered constructions and articles.<br>
The description, preparation and uses of the s-triazine UV absorbers are described for automotive coatings, photographic application, polymeric film coatings and ink jet printing. Automotive coatings are described in British 2,317,174A and 2,317,893A and in United States Patent Nos. 5,556,973; 5,681,955; 5,726,309 and 5,106,891. Photographic applications are disclosed in United States Patent No. 3,843,371 and cop ending application Serial No. 08/974,263. Polymeric film coatings are described in United States Patent Nos. 4,619,956 and 4,740,542. Inkjet printing is disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,096,489. From each of these patents, the s-triazines UV absorbers are revealed as very photostable.<br>
The s-triazine UV absorbers can be prepared by the general synthetic procedures outlined in United States Patent Nos. 5,726,309; 5,681,955 and 5,556,973; British 2.317,714A and WO 96/28431.<br>
The use of UV absorbers in adhesives is known as well. United States Patent Nos. 5,683.804; 5,387,458; 5.618,626 and 5.643,676 demonstrate the use of UV absorbers in the<br><br>
adhesive layers of various articles. Typically benzophenones, cyanoacrylates, benzotriazoles and salicylates are used. The benzophenones, cyanoacrylates and salicylates do not provide acceptable performance in these applications. The benzotriazoles lack the high molar extinction values exhibited by the instant s-triazine UV absorbers. Quite surprisingly, the instant s-triazines are amazingly soluble in the adhesives making them especially well-suited for use in these applications. The use of s-triazine UV absorbers in adhesive compositions is not known in the prior art.<br>
It is known in the art that the concomitant use of a hindered amine light stabilizer with a UV absorber such as an s-triazine provides excellent stabilization in many polymer compositions as summarized by G. Berner and M. Rembold, "New Light Stabilizers for High Solids Coatings", Organic Coatings and Science and Technology. Vol. 6, Dekkar, New York, pp 55-85.<br>
Molecules containing both a UV absorber moiety and a hindered amine moiety with N-H, N-alkyI, N-alkaloid and N-hydrocarbyloxy derivatives are described in United States Patent Nos. 4.289,686; 4,344,876; 4,426.471; 4,314.933; 4,481.315; 4.619,956 and 5,021,478; British 2,188,631; and L. Award et al., "New Anti-UV Stabilizers for Automotive Coatings: (presented at the 1988 Annual Meeting of the Federation off Societies for Coatings Technology).<br>
The concomitant use of a separate hindered amine molecule and a separate UV absorber is also taught in United States Patent No. 4.619,956.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,204,390 teaches pressure-sensitive, hot melt adhesives for application to plasticized surfaces. It is generically taught that benzotriazoles and 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyphenyl)-s-triazine might be used in such products.<br>
The effect of UV light on laminated articles that are exposed to the sun or other sources of UV light are of great concern to the manufacturers of such articles. Over time, constant or repeated exposure to UV light can result in dye and/or pigment fade for dyes and/or pigments used in such articles and in the degradation or breakdown of the adhesives, polymers or other materials used in the construction of the articles. The aforementioned<br><br>
fading and degradation shorten the useful life of the articles in question, making protection from UV light exposure an issue of great importance to the manufacturers of such articles.<br>
Molecules known as UV absorbers are generally known in the art. However, due to the differences discussed above between the various UV absorber classes, it is the s-triazines and articles containing them which will be discussed here. Due to the incompatibility and low solubility of certain UV absorbers, a need exists for a s-triazine UV absorber that is highly soluble and which is very photostable and with a high molar extinction value.<br>
T. Nagashima and H. Kuramashi, J. Non-Cryst. Solids, 178, (1994), 182 report "Recently ultraviolet light (UV) shielding glass, which is UV absorbing over the range of long wavelengths (320-400 nm) to avoid sunburn effects, has become an important issue because of the possible hazard of skin cancer due to depletion of the ozone layer."<br>
The use of s-triazine UV absorbers in adhesive compositions and articles addresses these concerns and is not known in the prior art. In addition, articles which incorporate the s-triazine UV absorber of the instant invention are useful in protecting interior textiles and fabrics from UV induced photodegradation.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,770,114 discloses stabilized compositions containing soluble benzotriazoles that are used in electrochromic devices. This patent discloses that 2-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole is effective in stabilizing such electrochromic devices against degradation from UV radiation, but that it is not soluble enough in aprotic solvents, e.g. propylene carbonate, to provide suitable protection forelectrochromic devices for very long periods of time. This indicates that any acceptable UV absorber must also exhibit excellent solubility in substrates and solvents in order to be acceptable.<br>

s-Triazine UV Absorber Solubility in Adhesive<br>
To measure the solubility of the s-triazine UV absorber compounds, the compound is added to a typical adhesive GELVA®263 (Solutia) which is a 44.5% solution of a polyacrylate in a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane. The polyacrylate is a copolymer of methyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate.<br>
The test s-triazine is dissolved in 5 mL of ethyl acetate, toluene or a mixture of ethyl acetate and toluene. To the solution is added 5 g of GELVA® 263 and 2-3 mL of the resulting solution is placed into individual watch glasses. Solubility is then evaluated based upon observed crystallization once the solvent has evaporated. Observations start after several hours and then continue over a period of several weeks.<br>
The solubility values given in the table below are approximate maximum concentrations where no sign of subsequent crystallization is evident. Solubilities are reported in weight of total s-triazine added to GELVA® 263 as is. From these data it is clear that some of the instant s-triazines are considerably more soluble in adhesives (in this case GELVA® 263) than many benzotriazoles of the prior art. The use of many UV absorbers in adhesives has been limited in the past by the limited solubility and compatibility of some UV absorber compounds. By using selected instant s-triazines the use levels can be increased substantially to add greatly increased stabilization protection which is further augmented by the excellent photostability of the instant s-triazine UV absorbers.<br>

Example 3 Weathering Experiments<br>
To ascertain the effect of durability and loss rate of the s-triazine UV absorber test compounds, the following test is carried out on adhesive compositions in selected articles.<br><br>
GELVA® 263 (Solutia) adhesive is described in Example 2. A biaxially oriented poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film is obtained from United States Plastics.<br>
The GELVA® 263 is reduced 50% by dilution with ethyl acetate to a final resin solids content of 23%. The test stabilizer is dissolved in the GELVA® 263 solution and samples are prepared in duplicate. The formulations seen in the table below are based on total coating solids. Approximately 8 micron coatings are applied to 1.5 inch glass discs for each formulation using a Headway Research Inc. Photo Resist Spinner (Model EC101DT) operating at 5000 rpm for 10 seconds. All formulations receive the same 80^C x 3 minute bake in a Hereaus model LUT 6050F oven operating at 3 air changes/minute.<br>
Since the adhesive remains tacky even after baking a direct thickness measurement is not possible. Indirect film thickness is determined by creating an adhesive sandwich between to layers of PET film and comparing its thickness versus two PET sheets without adhesive using magnetic induction methodology.<br>
The spin coating conditions are thus obtained. Further, since the spin coating conditions are not changed for applying the adhesive onto the glass, very little if any thickness variations are expected. After curing it in an oven, a layer of PET (ca 2 mils) is placed over the adhesive and pressed down.<br>
Absorbance spectra are collected using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 Spectrophotometer running UVWINLAB software. Absorbance data are collected from 400-300 nm every half nanometer at a speed of 240 nm/minute and a slit width of 2 nm.<br>
Weathering is done at a controlled irradiance at 6500 W. The cycle is as follows: 3.8 hours straight irradiance with no water spray, followed by one hour darkness. In the light cycle, the black panel temperature is controlled at 89°C. The chamber (dry bulb) temperature is 62°C in the light cycle. The relative humidity in the light cycle is in the range of 50-55% and in the dark cycle 95%. The chamber (dry bulb) temperature is 38^C in the dark cycle.<br>
The test samples are placed in a Xenon Arc Weather-O-meter with the glass facing the Xenon lamp to emulate articles such as solar films. UV spectra are obtained at about<br><br>
250 hour intervals. UV spectra are obtained at 500 hours and the samples are rotated to insure that all samples receive similar weathering conditions.<br>
To follow the loss of the UV absorber from the adhesive composition, UV spectra measured initially and after weathering. The UV spectrophotometer measure absorbance linearly up to 5.5 absorbance units using a reference beam attenuation technique.<br>
It is assumed that the degradation products for the UV absorber do not contribute to the UV spectrum. This is tested by following the ratio of absorbance of the band at 300 nm and the band at about 340 nm. The ratio does not change upon weathering the sample. This suggests that the UV spectrum of the weathered films correspond to the amount of UV absorber remaining in the film with very little if any contribution to the spectrum by the photodegradants.<br>
The results after 1050 hours exposure are given in the table below.<br>
Absorbance	UV Absorber<br>

(Compound K given in the list in Example 1).<br>
These data clearly show that the instant s-triazine is especially durable in adhesives as measured by the low loss rate of absorbance values after exposure to actinic radiation. In<br><br>
summary, the instant s-triazines combine both great photostability and unexpectedly high solubility in adhesive systems.<br>

To ascertain the effect of durability and loss rate of other s-triazine UV absorber test compounds, the following test is carried out on adhesive compositions in selected articles as described in Example 3.<br>
Each of the test samples also contain 0.5% by weight of the hindered amine bis(1-octyloxy-2.2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl) sebacate. The results after 1338 hours exposure are given in the table below.<br>

summary, the instant s-triazines combine both great photostability and unexpectedly high solubility in adhesive systems.<br>
Example 5<br>
Windshield Interlayer Assembly<br>
When an adhesive composition containing a s-triazine UV absorber is placed between two sheets of glass, the assembly resembles a typical windshield. In this confined environment there is no chance that the s-triazine stabilizer can escape by volatility since the glass sheets provide a impervious container for the adhesive interlayer. The photostability and durability of the soluble s-triazine stabilizer is now paramount. s-Triazine UV absorbers whose structures causes them to be volatile and which precludes their use in other types of applications can be used in such windshield interlayer assemblies with impunity to achieve long lasting and stable windshield structures.<br>
A windshield or windscreen prototype structure is exposed to weathering according to the procedure described in Example 3. The GELVA® 263 (Solatia) adhesive is placed between two sheets of glass and additionally contains 3.2 to 4% by weight of selected test UV absorbers. The structure is then exposed to weathering for 1338 hours as described in Example 3.<br>
The results are seen in the table below. Each test sample also contains 0.5% of the hindered amine bis(1-octyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl) sebacate.<br>

III	is 2,4-bis(4-biphenylyl)-6-(2-hydroxy-4-octyloxycarbonylethylideneoxyphenyl)-s-triazine<br>
(Compound E given in the list in Example 1).<br>
These data clearly show that the instant s-triazines are especially durable in adhesives as measured by the low loss rate of absorbance values after exposure to actinic radiation. Additionally, it is seen that these s-triazines are far superior to the benzophenones in adhesive compositions. Furthermore, the combination of the s-triazines with a hindered amine stabilizer offers quite superior performance.

To ascertain the effect of durability and loss rate of the s-triazine UV absorber test compounds, the following test is carried out in polyurethane films.<br>
Polyurethane Film Preparation<br>
RK 4037, acrylic polyl, 75% solids in methyl amy! ketone, from DuPont is used in these experiments. The molecular weight is 7.000 - 9,000 and OH Number 145. To 595 g of the acrylic polyol, 26.2 g of butyl acetate 5.8 g, ethyl acetate and 0.4 g of 50% strength FC 430 are added and mixed. 0.75 g of Bis(1-octyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-2-yl) sebacate (Tinuvin 123) is added to the mix (1% weight based in resin solids). To 2.43 g of the above mix, 0.9 g of Desmodur® N-3390. an aliphatic polyisocyanate, 90% solids, from Bayer is added. The test UV absorbers are incorporated into the acrylic polyol portion. The coating is applied onto a quartz disc by spin coating at 1,000 rpm for 2 seconds. The wet coating is cured at 260°F (127’^0) for 30 minutes.<br>
UV spectra are collected using the A.-9 UV spectrophotometer from Perkin Elmer every half nm at 120 nm/min using a slit width of 2 nm.<br><br>
Weathering Conditions<br>
Loss rates are measured from a 1.4 mil coating. The absorbance of the long wavelength UV absorbance band is around 2.3 before weathering. Weathering is done according to SAEJ 1960 (exterior automotive weathering conditions): 0.55 watts/sq. m at 340 nm using an inner and outer borosilicate filters; 40' straight irradiance with no water spray; 20' light plus front spray; 60' light and 60' dark plus rear spray (condensation). Black panel temperature in light cycle is TOt^'C and relative humidity of 50 - 55% in light cycle and 100% in dark. The loss of the long wavelength absorbance band is followed after approximately every 200 hours.<br>
The results after 2012 hours exposure are given in the table below.<br><br>
