				<td>Title:        Process and apparatus for the production of sulphur oxides<br>
The invention is directed to a process and apparatus for the removal of hydrogen sulphides from streams containing them, in particular from wastewater streams, and production of sulphur oxides from said removed hydrogen sulphides.<br>
In many industrial production processes a stream containing organic material and sulphate is produced, in particular in production processes wherein organic material and sulphuric acid are used. Examples of such processes are processes which involve the use of sulphuric acid for the release and hydrolysis of lignocellulose, so that the sugar containing groups that are thus produced can be used in a fermentation process for the production of ethanol, lactic acid, citric acid, and the like. Commonly the sulphate in these streams is converted to hydrogen sulphide, in particular using anaerobic treatment processes, after which a step is carried out for removing the hydrogen sulphide.<br>
In the art several processes are known for removing hydrogen sulphide from process gases. US-A-5 928 620, for example, discloses a process wherein H2S is converted to elemental sulphur.<br>
The present invention seeks to provide an efficient process for removing H2S from process streams. At the same time, the process should make it possible that the removed H2S may be converted into useful sulphur oxide compounds.<br>
It was found that this object can be met by removing H2S from process streams, in particular from liquid process streams, more particularly aqueous process streams, by vacuum stripping followed by burning of the removed H2S. Thus in one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a process for the removal of hydrogen sulphide from a liquid stream, comprising the steps of - feeding said liquid stream to a stripper;<br>
-	contacting said liquid stream in said stripper under reduced pressure with a<br>
stripping gas, which stripping gas comprises steam that is generated in said<br>
stripper, whereby at least part of said hydrogen sulphide is transferred to said<br>
stripping gas, whereby a loaded stripping gas is obtained;<br>
-	subjecting said loaded stripping gas from said vacuum stripper to a step<br>
wherein water is condensed, thus producing a H2S rich stream; and<br>
-	burning H2S in said H2S rich stream, preferably using air, thus producing a<br>
stream rich in oxides of sulphur.<br>
In accordance with the present invention an aqueous solution of sulphide may be used. Aqueous hydrogen sulphide containing solutions may originate e.g. from anaerobic bioreactors, in which sulphur compounds (e.g. sulphate, sulphite, thiosulphate, certain amino acids, etc.), are converted to sulphide, while organic compounds are used as an electron donor. Also H2, electricity and redox mediators can be used as electron donor. The use of aqueous sulphide containing streams in accordance with the present invention is particularly advantageous, because the gas that is produced in the vacuum stripper, comprises water vapour and hydrogen sulphide. It was found that the steam in this gas stream can be condensed relatively easily, whereby a gas stream with a high hydrogen sulphide concentration is obtained.<br>
One particular type of bioprocesses are anaerobic biological acidifying processes, in which the organic material is mainly converted into fatty acids, which fatty acids are in turn not converted to methane and CO2. By result, the fatty acids accumulate and the pH drops. A low pH is favourable for subsequent sulphide removal, as can be explained by the following reaction equations:<br>
S2-	+        H+            HS-	(1)<br>
HS-        +       H+          H2S	(2)<br>
At increased H+ concentrations, the equilibrium of (2) shifts to the right hand side and the H2S concentration increases. By result, the H2S can be transferred more easily to the stripping gas. Thus acidifying bioprocesses are preferred according to the present invention. For this type of processes it was found that the suitable pH is preferably from 6 to 6.9, in particular about 6.5.<br>
The contacting of the stripping gas and the H2S containing liquid may be carried out in various ways. The stripping gas may be directed through the liquid in the form of bubbles. It is also possible to have the gaseous phase as the continuous phase and finely divide the liquid, e.g. by spraying the liquid from the top of the stripping column. In the latter case, it is usually preferred to have column packings present in the stripper, in order to increase the contact area between stripping gas and liquid. Preferred packings are Pall rings and/or saddle rings. Usually, when a strip gas is to be added to the stripper, the gas is fed at the bottom and the liquid at the top.<br>
DE-A-376 633 describes a vacuum stripping method which involves heating under vacuum. Such a method is disadvantageous because it requires more energy. Furthermore, this method is not suitable for treating a liquid feed stream that originates from a bioreactor and comprises living bacteria, these bacteria will generally not survive such high temperatures.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the stripping is carried out in vacuum, viz. under reduced pressure, i.e. at pressures lower than atmospheric, typically lower than 0.5 bara. Preferably the pressure in the stripper is from 0.01 to 0.2 bara, more preferably from 0.05 to 0.1 bara. These low pressures can easily be applied by using vacuum pumps, which are placed down stream of the stripper, in combinations with suitable restriction upstream of the low pressure segment. As a result of these low pressures, the water which contains the sulphides may commence boiling at already very low temperatures, e.g. at about 30 °C. It was found that by using very low pressures, H2S can be removed without heating and bacteria can survive the vacuum stripping step.<br>
By employing a lower pressure, water evaporates from the liquid and the thus formed steam enters the gas phase, where it will (co-)act as a strip gas. Another advantage of the removal of water from the liquid phase is that the concentration of H2S in the liquid phase increases, as result of which the transfer of H2S to gaseous phase is further improved. Preferred temperatures for operating the stripper are from 20 to 80 °C, more preferably from 25 to 35 °C, typically around 30 °C.<br>
The mean residence time of the stripping gas in the stripper is typically from 1 to 100 seconds.<br>
One of the advantages of the present invention is that the concentrations of the loaded strip gas, viz. the gas which contains the H2S stripped from the liquid phase, may be relatively high. Typically, the loaded stripping gas comprises 5-40 wt.% H2S, preferably 25-35 wt.% H2S on a dry gas basis. High concentrations of H2S are particularly desirable because the H2S is to be burnt, as will be explained in more detail hereinbelow. Although the burning of H2S is exothermic, the amount of heat produced is too low at low H2S concentrations, thus requiring the addition of extra fuel, which is not desirable from an economic point of view. Thus operating at a H2S concentration that is as high as possible is desirable. At H2S concentrations above 4.5 wt.% in air, H2S can burn in a self supporting flame.<br>
In addition to the steam that is produced in the stripper, extra stripping gas may added to the bottom of the stripper. This extra stream of stripping gas may be e.g. air, which under certain circumstances has additional advantages, as will be explained in more detail hereinbelow. It is also possible to apply this stream of air in a separate stripper, not necessarily a vacuum stripper, which is in line with the vacuum stripper.<br>
In a subsequent step, the loaded stripping gas is subjected to a step wherein the water content of the gas is reduced, e.g. by means of a condenser. In this way a dry H2S rich stream is produced. Apart from H2S and depending on the upstream process, the dry H2S rich gas may comprise other gases, such<br>
as CO2. Typically the dry gas further comprises 95-60 wt% CO2, preferably 65-75 wt.% CO2, based on dry gas.<br>
The sulphide containing liquid, from which the sulphide is recovered in accordance with the present invention, may originate from various sources, such as from a wastewater treatment process (such as tannery wastewater); or from a. process for the production of fermentation products (such as ethanol, lactic acid, citric acid, etc.).<br>
The (dry) H2S rich stream produced in accordance with the present invention may be processed further. For instance, it is possible to produce elemental sulphur (Sx) from H2S by means of the well known Glaus process.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, however, the HaS rich gas stream is converted to a stream rich in oxides of sulphur, such as SO2 and/or SO3. Usually this is done by reacting the HaS with oxygen, whereby the HaS is thus effectively burnt, whereby normally SO2 is formed. SO2 may consequently be further oxidized to SO3 by means of a suitable catalyst. In a next step the SO3 may be dissolved in water, forming H2SO4 The burning of the H2S is preferably carried out using air. As indicated hereinabove, it is even more preferred if the air is entered at the vacuum stripper and/or in the second or further separate stripper, so that it may contribute in stripping action.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the liquid feed stream originates from an anaerobic biological wastewater treatment reactor. Such a system effectively converts low value energy of organic compounds that are dissolved in wastewater to high value energy, such as the heat from burnt H2S. This high value energy can be used for different purposes, for example to reduce costs. Thus, this embodiment of the present invention provides in effect a biological heat pump, in which low value energy are converted by using mechanical energy (the compressor) into high value energy.<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically an embodiment in which two strippers are used in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment wastewater enters anaerobic reactor 1, in which acidification and sulphate<br>
reduction takes place. The liquid effluent is passed to separator 2, from which sludge is returned to reactor 1. The effluent is passed to an anaerobic post treatment process, which is carried out in reactor 3. the liquid effluent of the reactor 3 is passed to stripper 4, which is fed by air at the bottom. The gaseous stream which leaves stripper 4 is rich in air (oxygen) and also contains considerable amounts of H2S and is subsequently fed to H2S burner 6, where this gas stream is used as an oxygen source. Another liquid effluent from reactor 1 is fed directly to vacuum stripper 5, which produces a H2S rich stream that is fed to the burner, where it is burnt using at least part of the oxygen coming from stripper 4. Optionally extra air may be fed to burner 4, if necessary. It is also possible to place stripper 4 before post treatment reactor 3.<br>
In a specific embodiment of the present invention, the stream rich in oxides of sulphur that is produced by oxidizing the sulphides is contacted with water, thus producing a sulphuric acid rich stream, which sulphuric acid rich stream is fed to a step wherein it is contacted with biomass, thus producing a stream rich in monosaccharides and/or polysaccharides, which stream rich in monosaccharides and/or polysaccharides is subsequently subjected to a fermentation step, whereby fermentation products are formed and whereby a sulphate rich stream is formed, which sulphate rich stream is at least in part converted to hydrogen sulphide in said liquid stream, which liquid stream is fed to said stripper.<br>
In wastewater treatment processes, as well as in fermentation production processes, usually one or more alkaline substances are added to the process stream to neutralize acids that are formed at some stage in these processes. The present inventors have found that these alkaline substances, when used, are preferably selected from Mg(OH)2, NaOH and KOH. Ca(OH)2 is less preferred, because it may lead to undesired precipitation in the stripping column. Mg(OH)2 is particularly preferred when (baker's) yeast is used, since it is more sensitive to Na+ and K+.<br>
nother application of the present invention is the treatment of tail gas from a Glaus plant. In a Glaus process oxides of sulphur (SOX) are produced. This SOX may be absorbed in water and the aqueous stream thus obtained can be treated in the same way as the sulphur compound containing wastewater streams as described herein above. The sulphur compounds are converted to sulphide, which is subsequently stripped in the vacuum stripper in accordance with the present invention. The sulphide can be fed to the burner in the Glaus process.<br>
When the process of the present invention is used in producing fermentation products (e.g. ethanol) from lignocellulose, it may be advantageous to take an acidic feed stream that is obtained from the hydrolysis step (by membrane extraction), which is carried out using sulphuric acid and bypass the fermentation reactor. This sulphuric acid stream is then passed directly to the acidification reactor, or even directly to the vacuum stripper because this results in lowering the pH in the stripper, which is favourable for the stripping action, as explained above. The sulphuric acid is maintained in the liquid effluent and fed back to the bioreactor, where it may be converted into sulphide. Thus, according to this preferred embodiment, a relatively clean, acidic wastewater stream is fed to the vacuum stripper, preferably to the top of the vacuum stripper.<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
To a biological acidification reactor of 5 dm3 was added a synthetic wastewater stream comprising sucrose, yeast extract and sodium sulphate. The amount of sulphur from sulphate was 460 mg S/dm3 and the sucrose amount was 3200 mg/dm3. The pH in the bioreactor was kept constant by feeding NaOH solution using a pH-stat. The effluent of the reactor was allowed to flow to a settling tank (5 dm3) where the sludge was allowed to settle and<br>
the liquid was removed. The sludge was returned to the reactor. The liquid effluent was fed to a stripping column (1.5 dm3), which was operated at a pressure of 0.08 bara and a temperature of 30 °C. The liquid effluent contained only 10 mg sulphide/dm3. The gas was removed using a membrane pump. No external stripping gas was used.<br>
The sucrose was converted mainly into acetic acid and the sulphate disappeared. The sulphide formed from the sulphate could be removed for 98 wt.% in the vacuum stripper, despite the low H2S concentration in the Liquid. The gas from the stripper was subsequently dried by condensing the water. After drying it contained 30 wt.% H2S and 70 wt.% CO2.<br>
It was found that a pH of 6.5 in the bioreactor was optimal. A lower pH resulted in a lower biological activity and a higher pH resulted in a lower stripping efficiency.<br>
After mixing it with air, a gas resulted comprising 9 wt.% H2S and 14 wt.% O2.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (Reference)<br>
Example 1 was repeated. Again, the liquid effluent that was fed to the stripper contained 10 mg hydrogen sulphide per dm3 and the pH was 6.5. This time, however, an ordinary (atmospheric) stripper was used, employing N2 as the stripping gas. The dry gas produced contained only 0.25 wt.%<br><br><br>
