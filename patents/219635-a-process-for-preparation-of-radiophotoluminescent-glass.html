				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of radiophotoluminescent glass for recording and measurement of gamma radiation.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Radiophotoluminescent glasses are utilised for recording and measurement of gamma radiations. These glasses work on the principle that the gamma radiation, incident on these glasses, cause structural changes in the glass leading to the formation of luminescent centers. When this glass block is excited with the ultraviolet light, it emits visible light, which in turn can be measured by a reading device comprising a photodiode. This visible light is a measure of gamma radiation absorbed by the radiophotoluminescent glass. These radiophotoluminescent glasses are known to the prior art. However, these glasses, known in the prior art, suffer from following disadvantages.<br>
Main disadvantage of the processes for the preparation of radiophotoluminescent glasses, known in the prior art, is that these processes result in radiophotoluminescent glasses that have a slow build up time and which require more than twenty-four hours to indicate even 90% of the total intensity of the gamma radiation exposed thereon.<br>
Another disadvantage of the processes for the preparation of radiophotoluminescent glasses, known in the prior art, is that these processes result in radiophotoluminescent glasses which suffer from fading with the result that the recorded information regarding the absorbed gamma radiation fades over a period of time.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of the processes for the preparation of radiophotoluminescent glasses, known in the prior art, is that these processes result in radiophotoluminescent glasses which do not provide linear response to the absorbed gamma radiation.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the processes for the preparation of radiophotoluminescent glasses, known in the prior art, is that these processes result in radiophotoluminescent glasses, which are also sensitive to incident neutrons and as such these glasses can not be exclusively utilised for measurement of gamma radiation.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Primary object of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of radio photoluminescent glass which is able to record and measure the gamma<br><br>
radiation, incident. upon it, thereby working as a sensor of incident gamma radiation.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of radio photoluminescent glass, which does not record incident neutron radiation and thereby functions exclusively as a sensor for incident gamma radiation.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of radio photoluminescent glass, which has a fast build-up time and which is capable of providing information about total 100% incident gamma radiation.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of radiophotolumlnescent glass, which has almost no fading and the recorded informtion regarding incident gamma radiation fades only by 5X over a period of six months.<br>
Yet further 'object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of radio photoluminescent glass, which has unit sensitivity and has one to one correspondence with the incident gamma radiation.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of radio photoluminescent glass, which is weather stable and which does not suffer from the loss of its characteristics over a period of time.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of radio photoluminescent glass, which has high sensitivity and is able to record even as low as 1 centi gray of incident radiation.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of radio photoluminescent glass,<br>
which  is  capable of recording incident gamma  radiation  having intensity from 1 centi gray to 1000 centi gray.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION 0F THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process tor preparation for radiophotoluminescent glass comprising the steps of :<br>
(i)       Preparing a mixture by mixing aluminium phosphate, lithium carbonate and silver nitrate with ortho phospheric acid in a crucible<br>
(ii)      drying of said mixture<br>
(iii)     polymerising the mixture of glass matrix in calcination furnace by heating<br>
(iv)      casting of glass matrix in a pre-heated sintered mould<br>
(v)       annealing of glass<br>
(vi)      polishing of the glass block<br>
(vii)     cleaning of glass block<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the process for the preparation of radiophotoluminescent glass comprises of fol1 owing steps:<br>
( i) Preparation of batch by mixing of almunium phosphate. 1ithium carbonate and si 1ver nitrate with ortho phospheric acid in an aluminium crucib1e<br>
30-40X  (weight  wise) aluminum  phosphate,  15-17%	(weight<br>
wise) lithium carbonate and 3-4* (weight wise) silver nitrate are<br>
well mixed to form a powdered mix.  This powdered mix is	added to<br>
54-56*  (weight  wise)  ortho  phospheric  acid  in  an	aluminum<br>
crucible under continuous stirring by a silica rod.  The	uniform<br>
agitation  of  the slurry helps in uniform  distribution	of  the<br>
si 1ver.<br>
(ii)      Drying of batch in oven at control 1ed temperature t<br>
The  batch  in  the crucible is placed in an  oven  and  the<br>
o temperature  is raised at the rate of 100 C per hour up to 140  _+<br>
o 10 C  and  then this temperature is maintained for  12-18  hours.<br>
During  the drying process, the batch is  stirred  intermittently with silica rod to facilitate evaporation of water.<br><br>
( i i i )     Pol ymerisat ion of g 1 ass ma tr.i x in ca i cinati on furnace by contro11ed heat ing<br>
After  drying of the batch, the crucible with the  batch  is<br>
transferred to a calcination furnace already preheated at  around<br>
o	o<br>
100-200 C  preferably  at  150 C.  Then the  temperature  of  the<br>
furnace   is  further  increased  in  two  stages.   First,	the<br>
o<br>
temperature  is raised upto 260 C with the rate of  increase	in<br>
o<br>
temperature  controlled at the rate of 10 C per hour.  Next,	the<br>
o        o	o<br>
temperture is raised from 260 C to 750 C at the rate of 45 +	5 C<br>
per  hour.  the  batch  is kept for four  hours  at  this  raised temperature for polymerisation of phosphate tetrahedra.<br>
( i v )      Casting of g lass matr i x in a_ pre-heated s intered graphite mould<br>
The crucible with the glass matrix is transferred to  a<br>
o electrically  heated melting furnace kept at 750 C.  The  furnace<br>
is  hearth type and the temperature of the furnace is  raised  at<br>
o the rate of 100 C per hour.  The melt is stirred with silica  rod<br>
o	o<br>
intermittnetly  between  1250 C  to  1340 C  for   homogenisation<br>
o purpose.  Next, the temperature is brought down to 1150 i 10 C at<br>
o the rate of 5 C per hour.  After melting of the glass matrix, the<br>
crucible  is  taken out and the glass is poured on  a  pre-heated<br>
o (upto  200 C) sintered graphite mould of size 150 x 110 x  16  mm<br>
and is gently pressed with a graphite block of size 100 x 70 x 15 mm on the free surface of the glass.(v) Annealing of glass<br>
The complete block along with the glass is transferred to a muffle type annealing furnace kept at 400 °C. The glass is kept at 400 °C for 20 minutes and then is allowed to cool at the rate of 40-50 °C per hour up 300 °C. The furnace is then switched off and the glass is allowed to cool to room temperature with the natural cooling rate of the chamber.<br>
(vi) Polishing of the glass block<br>
The glass is cut to optimum size ( 15x 12 x 4 mm) and polished with a surface finish of X./4.<br>
(vii) Cleaning of glass block<br>
Finally, the polished glass block is washed with benzene, acetone, and water. The cleaned polished glass block is kept in clean tissue papers.<br>
The properties of the radiophotoluminescent glass, prepared in above manner, are as in the following.<br>
