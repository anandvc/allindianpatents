				<td>A heat exchanger plate, a plate pack and a plate heat exchanger<br>
THE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART<br>
The present invention refers to a heat exchanger plate for a plate<br>
heat exchanger, wherein the plate includes at least a first area with<br>
a corrugation of ridges and valleys, the plurality of which extends in<br>
a first direction, wherein the plate has a central rotary axis which<br>
extends in parallel with a normal line of the plate. The invention<br>
also refers to a plate package for a plate heat exchanger, and a<br>
plate heat exchanger.<br>
Such heat exchanger plates for rotation a quarter of a round are<br>
known from EP-A-165 179. The plates have a substantially square<br>
shape and form a plate package where the inlets and the outlets<br>
extend through the sides of the plate package, i. e. the heat<br>
exchanger media flow into and out of the plate package in a<br>
direction which is substantially parallel to the main extension plane<br>
of the plates. Each plate has four side edges, wherein two opposite<br>
side edges are folded downwardly and the two other opposite side<br>
edges are folded upwardly. Every second plate is rotated 90째 in the<br>
plate package, wherein the downwardly folded side edges of a plate<br>
abut the upwardly folded side edges of an adjacent plate, wherein<br>
these side edges are connected to each other by means of a weld<br>
joint. In each corner of each plate a tab is formed, which extends<br>
along a diagonal direction and in a plane that is substantially<br>
perpendicular to the extension plane of the plates.<br>
The plates disclosed in EP-A-165 179 have an active heat<br>
exchanging surface with a corrugation OT ridges and valleys, which<br><br>
extend in a diagonal direction that is inclined 45째 to the side edges<br>
of the plates. Due to reasons of the manufacturing technology, a<br>
corrugation may not extend to the side edges but there has to be an<br>
edge area in order to enable, for instance, bending of the edge. The<br>
edge area may in principle be only a substantially line-shaped<br>
bending area but preferably the edge area has a substantially plane<br>
surface that has a width of 10-15 mm. By such a corrugation the<br>
plate becomes very rigid with regard to the shape in the diagonal<br>
direction, in which the ridges and the valleys extend, but is<br>
significantly less rigid transversely to the corrugation.<br>
The plates are manufactured by compression moulding and when<br>
the plates are compressed for the shaping of the pattern, the<br>
material is extended transversally to the corrugation. When the<br>
press tool then is open and the plate is released, a certain<br>
backspring is obtained due to the elasticity of the material. Since<br>
the main backspring occurs in the direction in which the plate has<br>
the lowest shape rigidity the deformation becomes relatively large.<br>
The original square plate thus obtains after the compression<br>
moulding a rhombic shape. Such a rhombic shape leads to poor<br>
pattern fitting of the adjacent plates in the complete plate package,<br>
which in turn leads to lower pressure strength of the plate package.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to remedy the problems<br>
mentioned above. In particular, it is aimed at a plate, at a plate<br>
package with such a plate, and a plate heat exchanger with such a<br>
plate package, wherein the plate package is designed to maintain<br>
its outer shape after the compression moulding. The maintaining of<br>
the outer shape after the compression moulding. The maintaining of<br>
the outer shape after the compression moulding is important during<br>
the joining of the plates with modern welding methods such as laser<br>
beam welding.<br><br>
This object is achieved by the plate initially defined, which is<br>
characterised in that the plate includes at least a second area with<br>
a corrugation of ridges and valleys, the plurality of which extends in<br>
a second direction, wherein these areas have a respective contour,<br>
which coincides with a respective imaginary stationary contour in a<br>
first rotary position of the plate with regard to said rotary axis and<br>
after a rotation of 90째 to a second rotary position of the plate with<br>
regard to the rotary axis.<br>
Since the heat exchanging surface includes two areas, which have<br>
a corrugation extending in a respective direction, the deformation of<br>
the shape in one of the areas may be counteracted by the<br>
deformation of the shape in the other area and vice versa.<br>
Consequently, the total deformation of the shape of the plate may<br>
be prevented or reduced and the original outer shape may<br>
substantially be maintained also after the compression moulding of<br>
the plate. The definition contour refers to the outer and inner<br>
contour of an area. One of said areas may for instance be<br>
completely enclosed in another of said areas, wherein the border of<br>
the latter outer area to the inner area forms the inner contour of the<br>
outer area.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the area of said first<br>
area is substantially equal to the area of said second area.<br>
Furthermore, the first direction is advantageously perpendicular to<br>
the second direction. By such a design of the plate, the deformation<br>
of the shape may be prevented substantially completely.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the plate<br>
includes a diagonal line, wherein the first direction is substantially<br>
parallel to the diagonal line.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the plate has a<br>
contour that coincides with an imaginary stationary contour in said<br>
first rotary position and in said second rotary position. Such a<br>
contour involves for instance a circular or a polygonal shape with at<br>
least four side edges, wherein the plate may have at least four<br><br>
corners and wherein said diagonal line extends between two<br>
opposite ones of said corners.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the plate has an<br>
edge, which extends around the plate, and an edge area, which<br>
extends around the plate inside the edge. The total area of the edge<br>
area is relatively small in relation to the area of said first and<br>
second areas, which form an active heat exchanging surface.<br>
Furthermore, the plate may be substantially square and have four<br>
side edges, wherein two first of said side edges are parallel and<br>
folded in a first direction along a respective folding line extending in<br>
said edge area in parallel with the side edge in question, wherein<br>
two second of said side edges are parallel and folded in a second<br>
direction along a respective folding line extending in said edge area<br>
in parallel with the side edge in question, and wherein the first<br>
direction is opposite to the second direction.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the plate<br>
includes a support area, which extends around said first and second<br>
areas inside the edge area and includes a corrugation of ridges and<br>
valleys. In such a corrugated support area, the ridges and valleys<br>
may be given a direction that is favourable for the specific position<br>
in which they will be located in the complete plate package so that<br>
the load is equalised between the different support points. By such<br>
a particular corrugation for the support area, the number of support<br>
points in this area in the proximity of the side edges of the plate<br>
may be substantially increased. At least a large number of the<br>
ridges and valleys in the support area may thus extend in a<br>
direction which deviates from the diagonal direction of the ridges<br>
and valleys of the heat exchanging surface. The ridges and the<br>
valleys of the support area will be shorter in their extension<br>
direction in comparison with the ridges and valleys of the heat<br>
exchanging surface. Advantageously, the plate includes a marked<br>
border line between the heat exchanging surface and the support<br>
area.<br><br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the support area has<br>
in each corner such a ridge or valley, which extends in a direction<br>
that substantially coincides with a diagonal line between the<br>
corners. Furthermore, substantially each ridge and valley of the<br>
support area along a central part of the side edges may extend in a<br>
direction which is substantially perpendicular to the side edge lying<br>
most closely to said ridge and valley. By such a design of the<br>
support area the number of support points in this area may be<br>
increased with up to 50%. The ridges and the valleys in the support<br>
area may also have substantially the same spacing as the ridges<br>
and valleys of the heat exchanging surface. Advantageously, the<br>
direction of the ridges and the valleys of the support area changes<br>
successively from the substantially diagonal direction in the corners<br>
to the substantially perpendicular direction in the central parts.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the plate<br>
includes an extension plane, which extends in and in parallel to the<br>
edge area, wherein said valleys of the first and second areas are<br>
located at the extension plane and said ridges of the first and<br>
second areas are located above the extension plane. Said valleys<br>
of the support area may advantageously be located below the<br>
extension plane and said ridges of the support area above the<br>
extension plane.<br>
The object is also achieved by a plate package for a plate heat<br>
exchanger, which includes a number of plates arranged on each<br>
other as defined above. The plates in the plate package may<br>
advantageously be arranged in such a way that every second plate<br>
is rotated 90째 around said rotary axis and in such a way that<br>
interspaces are formed between adjacent plates, wherein said first<br>
and second areas have such a shape that the contour of the first<br>
area coincides for all plates in the plate package and that the<br>
contour of the second area coincides for all plates in the plate<br>
package. Furthermore, the plates in the plate package may be<br>
welded to each other, wherein the plates are arranged on each<br>
other in such a way, that said first side edges of a plate abut said<br>
second side edges of an adjacent plate, and wherein these side<br><br>
edges are connected to each other by means of a weld joint.<br>
Substantially ail plates in the plate package may be substantially<br>
identical. Furthermore, said interspaces may include a number of<br>
first interspaces and a number of second interspaces, wherein the<br>
first interspaces are arranged to convey a first medium through the<br>
plate package and the second interspaces are arranged to convey a<br>
second medium through the plate package.<br>
The object is also achieved by a plate heat exchanger including a<br>
plate as defined above.<br>
The object is also achieved by a plate heat exchanger including a<br>
plate package as defined above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Figs 1-3 disclose a plate heat exchanger 1. The plate heat<br>
exchanger 1 includes an outer casing 2 and a plate package 3,<br>
which is arranged inside the casing 2. The plate package 3 includes<br>
a number of heat exchanger plates 4 which are stacked on and<br>
attached to each other.<br>
The plates 4 have a central rotary axis x, which extends in parallel<br>
with a normal line of a main extension plane p of each plate 4. All<br>
plates 4 are substantially identical and have in the embodiment<br>
disclosed a substantially square shape with four corners. It is to be<br>
noted that the plates 4 also may have another polygonal or circular<br>
shape. The plates 4 are rotatable around the axis x in such a way<br>
that the outer contour of the plates 4 coincides with an imaginary<br>
stationary contour in a first rotary positioned and after rotation 90째<br>
to a second rotary position.<br>
Each plate 4 has a heat exchanging surface 5 with a corrugation of<br>
ridges and valleys, see Fig. 4. Each plate 4 also has an edge, which<br>
extends round the plate 4, and a substantially line-shaped or<br>
surface-shaped edge area 6, which extends around the heat<br>
exchanging surface 5 inside the edge. In the embodiment disclosed,<br>
the edge forms four side edges 7', 7". Two 7' of the side edges are<br>
parallel to each other and folded downwardly in a first direction<br>
along a respective folding line that extends in the edge area 6 in<br>
parallel with the side edge 7' in question. The two second 7" side<br>
edges are also parallel to each other and folded upwardly in a<br>
second opposite direction along a respective folding line extending<br>
in the edge area 6 in parallel with the side edge 7" in question. In<br>
each corner of each plate 4 a tab 8 is formed when folding the side<br>
edges, which extends along a diagonal direction and in a plane<br>
which is substantially perpendicular to the extension plane p of the<br>
plates 4. These tabs 8 function as attachment members for<br>
mounting the plates 4 and the plate package 3 in the casing 2. More<br>
specifically, the tabs 8 are directly or indirectly attached in<br><br>
longitudinal groves in four corner posts 9 which are arranged in a<br>
respective corner in the inner space of the casing 2. The corner<br>
posts 9 also function to delimit four part spaces 10 between the<br>
casing 2 and the plate package 3.<br>
Every second plate 4 in the plate package 3 is rotated 90째 around<br>
the rotary axis x, wherein the plates 4 are arranged in the plate<br>
package 3 in such a way that interspaces 13', 13" are formed<br>
between adjacent plates 4 and that the first side edges 7' of a plate<br>
4 abut the second side edges 7" of an adjacent plate 4. The<br>
adjacent side edges 7' and 7" are attached to each other by means<br>
of a weld joint 14, see Fig. 7. The weld joint 14 may be obtained by<br>
means of laser beam welding or electron beam welding. The<br>
interspaces 13', 13" include a number of first interspaces 13' and a<br>
number of second interspaces 13", see Figs. 4-7. In such a way,<br>
the plate package 3, seen from two opposite sides, will be open<br>
with regard to the first interspaces 13' and closed with regard to the<br>
second interspaces 13". Seen from the two other opposite sides,<br>
the plate package 3 will be closed with regard to the first<br>
interspaces 13' and opened with regard to the second interspaces<br>
13". The first interspaces 13' are arranged to convey a first medium<br>
through the plate package 3 and second interspaces 13" are<br>
arranged to convey a second medium through the plate package 3.<br>
The plate heat exchanger 1 includes a first inlet 16 and a first outlet<br>
17 for the first medium, and a second inlet 18 and a second outlet<br>
19 for the second medium. The inlets and the outlets to the plate<br>
package 3 proper extend though the sides of the plate package 3, i.<br>
e. the heat exchanger media flow into and out of the plate package<br>
3 in a direction that is substantially parallel to the main extension<br>
plane p of the plates 4. In the embodiment disclosed, the plate<br>
package 3 includes three part packages a, b, c. The part packages<br>
a, b, c are delimited from each other by means of two delimiting<br>
plates 21, 22. It is to be noted that the plate package 3 may include<br>
another number of part packages, for instance 1, 2, 4 or more such<br>
part packages.<br><br>
In the embodiment disclosed, the first medium is conveyed in<br>
through the first inlet 16 into the part package a through one side to<br>
the first interspaces 13'. The first medium leaves the part package a<br>
through the opposite side and is conveyed into the part space 10. In<br>
the part space 10, the first media is conveyed passing the delimiting<br>
plate 21 and into the part package b through a side to the first<br>
interspaces 13'. The media leaves the part package b through the<br>
opposite side and enters the opposite part space 10. In this part<br>
space 10 the first media is conveyed passing the second delimiting<br>
plate 22 and into the part package c through the side to the first<br>
interspaces 13'. Thereafter, the first media leaves to plate heat<br>
exchanger 1 via the opposite side of the part package c, the part<br>
space 10 and the second outlet 17. In a corresponding manner the<br>
second media is conveyed into the first inlet 18 through the plate<br>
heat exchanger 1 and via the second inlet 19. It is to be noted that<br>
the second media also may be conveyed in counterflow to the first<br>
media in such a way that the outlet 19 forms an inlet and the inlet<br>
18 an outlet.<br>
The heat exchanging surface 5 includes in the embodiment<br>
disclosed in Fig. 4 a first area 31with a corrugation of ridges and<br>
valleys, and a second area 32 with a corrugation of ridges and<br>
valleys. The valleys of both the areas 31, 32 of the heat exchanging<br>
surface 5 are located at or at the level of the extension plane p and<br>
the ridges of both the areas 31, 32 of the heat exchanging surface 5<br>
are located above the extension plane p.<br>
The ridges and the valleys in the first area 31 extend in a first<br>
direction A, and the ridges and the valleys in the second area<br>
extend in a second direction B. The first direction A is substantially<br>
perpendicular to the second direction B. Furthermore, the first<br>
direction A is substantially parallel to a diagonal line extending<br>
between two opposite corners of the plate 4, and the second<br>
direction B is parallel to a diagonal line extending between the other<br>
two opposite corners of the plate 4. It is to be noted that the ridges<br>
and the valleys of the areas 31, 32 of the heat exchanging surface 5<br>
may extend along other directions than those disclosed. The ridges<br><br>
and valleys in the first area 31 do not need to extend<br>
perpendicularly to the ridges and valleys in the second area 32 but<br>
it is important that the ridges and valleys in the first area 31 form an<br>
angle to the ridges and valleys in the second area 32. The ridges<br>
and valleys of the areas 31, 32 of the heat exchanging surface 5<br>
may also extend along curved path and have larger or smaller<br>
interruptions or irregularities, for instance in order to form support<br>
points in relation to adjacent surfaces or in order to influence the<br>
flow through the plate heat exchanger 1. Inserted portions with<br>
deviating patterns may also be present for other reasons.<br>
The area of the first area 31 is substantially equal to the area of the<br>
second area 32. Each of the areas 31, 32 also has an outer and/or<br>
inner contour which coincides with a respective imaginary stationary<br>
contour in the first rotary position of the plate 4 with regard to the<br>
rotary axis x and after a rotation of 90째 to the second rotary position<br>
of the plate 4 with regard to the rotary axis x. The second inner<br>
area 32 is square and rotated 45째 in relation to the first outer area<br>
31, which also is square. The outer contour of the inner area 32<br>
forms or coincides with the inner contour of the outer area 31. In<br>
the plate package 4 a ridge of the heat exchanging surface 5 will<br>
substantially always abut a valley of the heat exchanging surface 5<br>
of an adjacent plate 4,. wherein this ridge crosses this valley in such<br>
a way that a support point or a small support area is formed.<br>
Each plate 4 includes a support area 41, which extends around the<br>
heat exchanging surface 5 inside the edge area 6. The support area<br>
41 also includes a corrugation of ridges 42 and valleys 43. The<br>
border between the support area 41 and the heat exchanging<br>
surface 5 is marked with a border line 44 that is located at or at the<br>
level of the extension plane p. The valleys 43 of the support area 41<br>
are located below the extension plane p and the ridges 42 of the<br>
support area 41 are located above the extension plane p.<br>
In the proximity of each corner, the support area 41 has such a<br>
ridge 42 or valley 43 extending in a direction that substantially<br>
coincide with a diagonal line between the corners. Along a central<br><br>
part of the side edges, substantially each ridge 42 and valley 43 of<br>
the support area 41 extends inside one of the side edges in a<br>
direction which is substantially perpendicular to the side edge which<br>
lies most closely to said ridge 42 and valley 43. The direction of the<br>
ridges 42 and the valleys 43 of the support area 41 changes<br>
successively from the diagonal direction in the corners to the<br>
perpendicular direction in the central parts.<br>
The ridges 42 and the valleys 43 of the support area 41 are thus<br>
positioned in such a way that each valley 43 in the support area 41<br>
of a plate 4 abuts a ridge 42 in the support area of a plate 4 lying<br>
therebelow, see Figs. 6 and 7. In such a way support lines, or<br>
elongated support surfaces, will always be formed between all<br>
adjacent plates 4 in the plate package 3, which support lines extend<br>
in the directions of the ridges 42 and the valleys 43. Also the<br>
support area 41 has such a shape that the outer and inner contour<br>
of the support area 41 coincide for all plates 4 in the plate package<br>
3.<br>
Fig 8 discloses a plate 4 with a heat exchanging surface 5 which is<br>
divided in into two areas 31, 32 according to a second embodiment.<br>
The inner area 32 is shaped as a square that is positioned in such a<br>
