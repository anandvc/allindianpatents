				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a comb for temperature and volume controlled oiling and massaging of scalp.<br>
The present invention particularly provides a novel comb for temperature and volume controlled oiling and massaging of scalp, which will find usage in applying warm massage oil over the human scalp / hair roots. The novel comb of the present invention for temperature and volume controlled oiling and massaging of scalp, will be able to apply warm oil, pre-heated to a pre-set temperature, over the scalp very conveniently and ensure the desired quantity of oil to be applied each time.<br>
In India as well as in other parts of the world, conventionally people massage different kind of oils on their scalp for stimulation of the hair roots for better growth. Some times it is prescribed by dermatologists to apply hot/warm oil on the scalp for good blood circulation, which in turn gives much better results in terms of hair growth and strengthening of the hair roots. But as a practice people put some oil (cold or hot) on their palm top and apply it directly on the scalp. The main drawback of this method is that only a small quantity of oil will reach the scalp or the hair roots as most of it will be consumed by the hair.<br>
Extensive efforts have been made all over the world for the development of suitable oiling devices for scalp use. The continual efforts made by inventors to develop scalp/hair oiling devices, is revealed by search of patent databases. The relevant hitherto known prior art are given here beiow.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. EP0497080, entitled: "A fountain comb", as shown in figure 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The invention is primarily for oiling the hair or for any suitable application. It comprises generally an absorbent or absorbing means to be saturated with oil or perfume and received in the main body of the comb. The said oil or perfume is dispensed between the teeth of the comb via passage formed in said teeth so that the hair<br><br>
can be arranged as desired by way of grooming and oiling. The main disadvantage of this device is that it does not have the control on the temperature and volume of the oil to be applied over the scalp. Another disadvantage is that the absorbent has to be changed frequently to prevent foul smell of oils due to bacterial growth in the absorbent.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent no. 4,055,195, entitled "Fluid-reservoir hair comb". This invention is directed towards a hair comb, which includes a fluid (e.g., hair oil) reservoir in the body of the comb as shown in figure 2 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The fluid/oil in the fluid reservoir is positively ejected under the influence of an air pump into the teeth of a comb. The fluid passes through an adjustable needle valve so that the feed rate to the teeth of the comb is precisely variable over a wide range. The fluid then passes around roller or ball bearings mounted in the teeth ends of the comb, for uniform distribution over the hair and scalp. The combination of a positive pressure fluid dispenser, and adjustable needle valve to control the positive flow of oil and distribution means, via roller bearings, provides an improved, precisely controllable, oil-reservoir hair comb with uniform fluid distribution. The main disadvantage of this invention is that it requires electricity to apply oil over the hairs as it has an air pump. Another disadvantage is that the total oil in the container has to be heated which may not be required at one time so there is wastage of electricity this process may also deteriorate the quality of the unused oil. Moreover this comb is very complicated and costly. Yet another disadvantage of this device is that the rollers at the tip of the teeth may get jammed due to the deposit of dirt present on the scalp and may entangle some hairs in the rollers.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent no. 4,213,473, entitled "Afro oil comb". Disclosed herein is a means for providing oil commonly used as a hair dressing, to be disposed on a person's head simultaneously with combing ones hair. This is possible by providing a comb having hollow teeth and an oil reservoir or chamber as well as means for controlling the volume of hair dressing oil that is to<br><br>
be deposited as illustrated in figure 3 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The main disadvantage of this invention is that in this comb the oil has to be supplied by external oil reservoir, which makes it inconvenient for regular use for a common man. Another disadvantage is that it will use comparatively large quantity of oil, as all the teeth are hollow so all the tubes have to be filled up with oil, which will lead to use of higher quantity of hair oil, which is not desirable.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent no. 5,325,878, entitled, "Fluid dispensing comb", as illustrated in figure 4 of the drawings accompanying this specification. In this invention a fluid dispensing comb for applying a fluid to the hair has a body upon which a plurality of teeth are formed such that they are configured to have a V-shape, thereby defining a groove. An absorbent pad is disposed within the groove defined by the teeth and functions as a reservoir and application means for containing and dispensing a fluid such as hair oil, coloring, or conditioner to the hair. The absorbent pad is preferably replaceable and may be inserted into the groove of the teeth from the end of the comb, from the top of the comb, or alternatively by pivoting the teeth along a living hinge, formed at the apex or one end thereof. Alternatively, the absorbent pad may be permanently molded into the groove of the teeth. A cuff may optionally be disposed upon the comb to catch and/or absorb excess fluid, which would otherwise tend to drip therefrom. The main disadvantage of this invention is that the absorbent pad will have to be replaced frequently. For different liquid it need to be replaced again.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent no. 5,343,880, entitled, "Fluid dispensing wand", as shown in the schematic diagram in figure 5 of the drawings accompanying this specification. In this invention a fluid dispensing wand having a fluid reservoir removably attachable to a wand for applying a fluid such as hair oil, coloring, lightener, highlight, de-tangler, or conditioner to the hair. A fluid delivery means disperses fluid from the reservoir throughout the wand to effect even distribution of the fluid throughout the hair. The fluid delivery means<br><br>
comprises a series of conduits and/or a porous material. Teeth and/or fins are formed upon the wand such that the wand may be moved through the hair in a comb-like fashion to effect transfer of the fluid thereto. An absorbent covering may optionally be formed over the wand intermediate the teeth or fins to further enhance the even distribution of fluid. A plug or seal preferably closes the reservoir, thus providing a fluid cartridge. Thus, various cartridges may be installed upon the wand to effect application of various desired fluids to the hair. Several valve arrangements for selectively facilitating fluid communication between the reservoir and wand are disclosed. In additional configurations, fluid is pumped, via a plunger or bulb, from the reservoir to the wand. The main disadvantage of this invention is that it is very complicated and has several valves to function the device properly. Another disadvantage is that it does not have a temperature control device. Yet another disadvantage is that it requires more oil to apply properly over the scalp.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. GB191417550, entitled " Improvements in or relating to apparatus for cleansing the head or applying liquids to the hair ". The schematic diagram in figure 6, of the drawings accompanying this specification, represents this device wherein an apparatus for cleansing the head or applying liquids to the hair comprises one or more containers d1, d2 for liquid, a pump a for supplying compressed air to the surface of the liquid, and a comb with hollow perforated teeth and a hollow stem t connected to the containers through a pipe n. The comb may be provided with a valve w, and in addition to the perforated teeth 3, the comb may have other teeth 4 similar to those of a fine-toothed comb. When two containers are used, a four-way junction may be employed leading to the containers, pump and comb respectively. The head may first be treated with a mixture of equal parts of paraffin and olive oil for destroying vermin and subsequently with warm vinegar to remove the paraffin. The main disadvantage of this invention is that it requires a big set up and can be used in a parlour, which is not a handy one.<br><br>
Reference may be made to patent no. GB478781 entitled, "Improvements in or relating to liquid reservoir hair combs" as shown in figure 7 of the drawings accompanying this specification. This invention relates to a liquid reservoir hair-comb C the hot oil or other liquid is supplied by squeezing a rubber container A which is screwed into the top of the comb, every tooth of which has a duct D. A screw plug E is removed when it is desired to clean the comb. This is a handy set but the main disadvantage that it does not have a warming facility. Another disadvantage is that the device does not have a control over the volume of the oil as it is based on squeezing action.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. GB521091, entitled "Improvements in or relating to combs". This invention relates to a comb, which perfumes the hair while smoothing it is made of wood impregnated with perfumed oil. The wood may be heated, subjected to a  vacuum in order to remove air from its pores and then immersed in a bath of the oil. This process is repeated and the comb dried after each immersion. The body of the comb may be hollow and contain a sealed reservoir of the perfumed oil. Protection against evaporation is provided by a close fitting case for the teeth and an impervious lining for the back of the comb. The main disadvantage of this device and its manufacturing process is that it is inconvenient now-a-days.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. GB632544, entitled "Improved means for dyeing, bleaching and treating living hair". This invention relates to a brush or comb for dyeing, bleaching, waving or otherwise treating living hair is made of a mass of chemically inert water-soluble synthetic polymers, e.g. methyl cellulose or polyvinyl alcohol, with which is incorporated a dyestuff, bleaching agent or other treating agent, which mass is cut to form a comb or cut into thin bars or rods which are attached to a backing to form a brush. This is again a device to apply different chemicals to the hair. The main disadvantage is that the chemical stuff itself has to be cut into thin comb like teeth that is inconvenient, which makes it a complicated device and can be used by professionals only.<br><br>
Reference may be made to US patent no. 6,793,434, entitled, "Brush". This invention relates to a brush having a brush member, and adjustable handle, and an optionally convex cover. The brush member accommodates a sponge. A first plurality of bristles extends from the brush member and each of a second plurality of orifices is disposed between the bristles, optionally in an offsetting relation. The handle extends from the brush member. The cover has a pair of slots accommodating the handle and overlays the sponge during use. The main disadvantage of this invention is that the device does not have a control over the volume of the oil as it is based on squeezing action. Another disadvantage of this invention is that the sponge has to be replaced for different liquids.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. CN1319438, entitled "Brain-arousing refreshment method and device thereof ". This invention belongs to a kind of comb, and is characterized by that it is equipped with a liquor-discharging device in which the refreshing liquor is held. The described refreshing liquor contains liquid mixture comprised of menthocamphorate 20%-50%, peppermint extract 20%-40%, camphor 10%-30%, dabuliu liquor 2%-10% ealenao liquor 5%-15%, bay oil or eugenol 6%-15%, and other component including essence and plant liquor capable of stimulating brain nerve 8-20%. Said invented comb not only can be used for combing hair, but also possesses refreshing function and massage action. This particular invention provides more emphasis on the refreshing liquid and not the intricacy of the device. The main disadvantages of this invention are that it does not mention anything about the volume and the temperature control of the device.<br>
The other patents found in the search were patent nos. US2755807, entitled "Hair oil dispensing comb"; CN2033617U, entitled "Hair oil auto-applying comb"; CN2067081U, entitled "Hair comb for applying oil and dressing hair"; CN2046330U entitled, "Comb with hair oil"; CN85204666U, "Comb being able to feed pomade or hair oil automatically".<br><br>
All the above-mentioned inventions are of different kind of device for oiling hairs. The disadvantages of these inventions are in their complicated designs, which lead to higher cost and inconvenience in applying the oil.<br>
Another disadvantage of some of the prior art devices is the requirement of frequent changing of the absorbent pads as in the case of patent No. EP0497080, US5325878, US5343880, US 6793434.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of some of the prior arts is that of having no control of volume of the oil to be applied in the hairs as in patent No. GB191417550, GB478781, GB521091, GB632544, US6793434 and CN1319438.<br>
Still yet another disadvantage in the prior art devices as mentioned above have many hollow teeth, which increase the spillage of oil, as only few teeth (two or three) that are inside the hairs can transfer the oil into the scalp during combing. The other hollow teeth will spill the oil over the hairs to make it look more oily, this is again not desired.<br>
Hence, it is clear from the hitherto known prior art, as detailed herein above, that no attempt has yet been made to provide a comb for temperature and volume controlled oiling and massaging of scalp.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a comb for temperature and volume controlled oiling and massaging of scalp, which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a simple and economical oiling and massaging device for the scalp.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a temperature controlled oiling device for the scalp and the hair.<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a volume controlled oiling device for the scalp and the hair, which will inject the exact amount of oil as desired, such as prescribed by a dermatologist.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a mild massage with oiling over the scalp to improve the blood circulation.<br>
In the present invention there is provided a comb for temperature and volume controlled oiling and massaging of scalp, which is useful as a device for pre-warming oil to a preset temperature before applying the cosmetic/therapeutic oil and massaging human scalp using desired amount of oil. The device is a multi-tooth comb wherein only one tooth is hollow, which is connected through a tube to a calibrated syringe en suited in the comb handle. The syringe is provided with a peripherally embedded heating element having thermostatic control for warming the oil to a desired preset temperature. The embedded heating element is provided with a push-switch for controlling the power supply. When the piston of the syringe is pulled back using the ring-handle to draw / suck a required volume of oil, the said ring-handle pushes the switch of the heating element to "ON" position indicated by a light emitting diode. The power supply to the heating element is controlled by the push-switch and also through the thermostat cut-off. As there is only one hollow tooth to allow the oil to come out of the device, chance of oil spillage reduces considerably. The device will also provide a gentle massage to the scalp by means of solid spherical beads at the comb teeth tips.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a comb for temperature and volume controlled oiling and massaging of scalp, which comprises a multi-tooth comb, characterized in that the said comb has one hollow tooth, the upper end of the said hollow tooth being connected through a tube to a syringe en suited in the handle of the said comb, the said syringe being provided with a peripherally embedded heating element having thermostatic control and a push-switch, both the thermostatic control and the push-switch being connected to a power source,<br><br>
the said push-switch being positioned such that the piston of the said syringe on being pulled back by a the piston handle pushes the said switch of the said heating element to "ON" position indicated by a light emitting diode.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the hollow tooth tip allows drawing oil from a bottle or from palm top by attaching a tube to the said tip.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the comb is provided with solid spherical beads at the comb teeth tips.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the syringe is a calibrated syringe fitted in the handle of the comb to enable drawing and delivery of a desired / calculated amount of oil onto a scalp.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the thermostat controlled heating element allows heating of the oil filled syringe to a desired predetermined temperature.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention, the push-switch of the heating element is in "ON" position when the piston of the syringe is pulled backward and pushes against the switch and is in "OFF" position when the piston is pushed forward.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the handle of the syringe piston is such as a ring-handle.<br>
In a still further embodiment of the present invention, the power source is such as a battery or regular power supply.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the calibrated syringe having thermostatically controlled peripherally embedded heating element is mounted on a holder fixed to the comb handle.<br>
The present invention is illustrated in figure 8 of the drawings accompanying this specification. In this drawing like reference numbers/letters indicate corresponding parts in the various figures.<br>
The figure-8 of the drawings represents a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the various constituting parts of the comb of the present invention for temperature and volume controlled oiling and massaging of scalp. The solid teeth (1) of about 5 cm length are provided with solid spherical beads (2) to provide gentle massage over the scalp. There is only one hollow tooth (11) in the entire comb so that the oil can be sucked/drawn from the palm top or the oil bottle. A narrow pipe (not shown) may also be temporarily attached to this hollow tooth during suction of the oil from a bottle or palm top. A calibrated cylindrical syringe (5) is fitted in the space of the handle (4). There is a nozzle (8) fitted at the end of the piston for inter-connecting the syringe and the hollow tooth (11) through a tube (3). This syringe (5) has a piston (9) with a ring shaped pusher (6) in which a finger can be inserted to draw oil from the bottle and to push it to apply the oil in different places of the scalp as and when required during brushing. A heating element (7) with a thermostat is fitted on the outer periphery of the syringe (5) to heat the oil to a fixed temperature (say 50°C). The heating element will start heating the oil when the piston is pulled back along with oil and during which the ring shaped pusher (6) puts the switch (12) in 'ON' position. The heating element is connected to a power source, sue as a battery or regular electrical connection through plug (13) as shown in the figure. There will be a cut-out signal given by the light emitting diode (LED) (14) to show that the heating is complete. The piston along with the heating element is mounted on a holder (10) to fit in the handle (4) space.<br><br>
In the present invention a calibrated syringe is used to draw oil in desired / calculated amount to heat the oil to a predetermined temperature by the heating element controlled by the thermostat and this warm oil can be applied over the scalp by pushing the piston while in a combing action.<br>
The novelty of the present invention resides in the ability of the comb to provide temperature and volume controlled oil to the scalp, which is has simplicity of design, has easy working and having low cost of manufacture. Further, it does not require much skill to use it. It is also very convenient to carry the device in small bag. It will also take less time to perform this job, which may be at par with the paucity of time in this modern age to visit a parlor for an oil massage.<br>
Another novelty of this present invention is to use a simple piston syringe to transfer the oil from the palm top or oil bottle and flush it to the scalp in a controlled way and wherever it is required it is actuated by the pressure of the finger. As an average Indian male uses/applies about 2-2.5ml of oil every day over the hair, the piston is calibrated to check by himself the oil quantity. Thus the oil quantity can be regulated and controlled by this syringe.<br>
Still another novelty of the present invention is to heat the oil by a heating element (7) which is controlled by a thermostat at a pre-set temperature so that the oil temperature cannot be increased inadvertently which may in turn damage or burn the scalp.<br>
Yet still another novelty of the present invention is the fixed solid beads (2), which may be used to provide a gentle massage to increase the blood circulation over the scalp. It does not have rollers as used in the prior art patent No US4055195, which may get jammed due to the deposit of dirt present on the scalp and may entangle some hairs in the rollers to make further inconvenience.<br><br>
Another novelty is the presence of only one hollow tooth in the entire comb, which will help in suction of the oil and its distribution over the scalp. The prior arts mentioned as figure 1-7 have many hollow teeth, which increase the spillage of oil, and only few teeth (two or three) that are inside the hairs can transfer the oil into the scalp. The other hollow teeth will spill the oil over the hairs to make it look oily this is again not desired. This also eliminates use of many valves as used in patent No GB191417550 as mentioned in the prior art.<br>
Yet another novelty of the present invention is that the comb is washable by flushing the syringe by soapy water several times and may be used for different oil. The requirement of different absorbent, their washing and replacement does not arise here. This makes it cheaper than those mentioned in the prior arts like US patent No. 6793434; patent No. US5343880; patent No. US5325878 etc.<br>
The novelty of the comb of the present invention for temperature and volume controlled oiling and massaging of scalp and for applying cosmetic oil in scalp and hair, has been realized by the non-obvious inventive steps of providing in combination a hollow tooth of a comb, a syringe provided with a peripherally fixed thermostatically controlled heating element; wherein the heating element is activated on pulling the piston of the syringe and deactivates during pushing action in the time of oil application. The presence of soft beads in the tips of the teeth also helps in improving blood circulation of the scalp.<br>
The following example is given by way of illustration of the working of the invention in actual practice and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example -1<br>
The temperature and volume controlled oiling device of the present invention for applying oil in scalp and hairs, in accordance with the present specification were<br><br>
manufactured as mentioned in figure 8 of the drawing. Used plastic injection syringes (without the needles) were sterilized and utilized, which were fitted in the handle of the comb shaped device. A heating element which is controlled by a thermostat that can raise the temperature of the oil upto 55° C was infused in the side of the syringe. The samples were distributed to some of the users and also to some parlors.<br>
It was found that the device of the present was far more convenient than those available in the market. The volume of the oil used per person per day was much less than normally consumed by the conventional method. The results were also encouraging that there was less entanglement of hairs and therefore less hair loss. The users appreciated the device, as this appliance was more comfortable than the usual item/method of oiling and massaging the scalp and hairs. There was no loss of oil in the absorbent pad as in case of other oiling devices.<br>
The main advantages of the comb of the present invention for temperature and volume controlled oiling of scalp are:<br>
1.	It has a very simple engineering design and hence easy and economical to manufacture.<br>
2.	It will be very cheap then the existing oiling and massaging comb.<br>
3.	Enables to reduce the spillage of costly hair oil.<br>
4.	Ensures to heat the oil to a pre-calculated temperature to prevent over heating.<br>
5.	Ensures less electricity consumption for the application of oil over the scalp.<br>
6.	Ensures users safety, as during applying the oil, he will push the piston away from the switch, which will put off the switch automatically to disconnect the electrical connection.<br>
7.	Hair/scalp oiling can be done even where there is no electricity by using pre-warmed oil.<br><br>
8.	Ensures less maintenance cost than other prior arts, as the device of the present invention comprises of very simple parts.<br>
9.	The device will be lightweight in compared to the prior art claming the same utility.<br>
10.	Using this device the oil will first reach the scalp which is welcomed and then<br>
the remaining oil will be absorbed by the hair by rubbing instead of applying<br>
the oil on the hair and rubbing it to reach the scalp, which is not desired.<br><br><br><br>
