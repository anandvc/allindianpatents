				<td>PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SUBSTITUTED METHYLAMINE COMPOUND AND<br>
TRIAZINE DERI VATIVE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process that enables a substituted methylamine compound, such as a pyridylmethylamine compound, which is useful as an intermediate for the production of agricultural chemicals and medicines and the like, to be produced easily, with good yield, and at low cost, and also relates to an N-methylidene-substituted methylaniine oligomer that acts as a production intermediate.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Substituted methylaniine compounds, including pyridymethylamine compounds such as 2-chloro-5-pyridylmeithylamine are  useful as intermediates for the production of agricultural chemicals and medicines.<br>
Conventionally, known processes for producing pyridylmethylamine compounds include a process in which 2-chlQro-5-chloromethylpyridine is reacted with potassium phthaiimide to obtain N-(2-chloro 5-pyridylmethyl)phthalimide, which is subsequently reacted v,'ith hydrazine (see Patent Document 1), a process in which 2-chloro-S-(chloromethyl)pyridine is reacted with hexamethylenetetramine to obtain 2-chloro-'5-pyridylmethylhexamethylenetetraammonium chloride, and a hydrolysis is subsequently performed in the presence of a lower alcohol and a mineral acid (see Patent Document 2),<br><br>
and a process in which 2-chloro-5-pyridylmethylhexamethylenetetrammonium  chloride is hydrolyzed using water or alkaline water to generate N-methylidene-2-chlpro'5-pyridylmethylamine, which is subsequently isolated  and then  hydrolyzed in an acid (see Patent Document 3).<br>
[0003]<br>
However, none of these production processes can be claimed to be entirely satisfactory- from an industrial perspective. Namely, the first process requires the use of the comparatively expensive potassium phthalimide as a raw material, meaning the process is undesirable from an economic perspective. Further, because an operation is required to remove phthalazine from the hydrazine reaction mixture, the post-processing operation tends to be complex. In the case of the second process, the amount of solvent used in the reaction is large, and a large amount of comparatively expensive hexamethylenetetramine must also be used, and therefore the process is undesirable from an economic perspective. Further, in this process, because the generated 2-chloro-5-pyridylmethylhexamethylenetetraammonium chloride must be first isolated, before being subjected to hydrolysis, a problem arises in that the operation is overly complex, In  the third process a problem arises in that the isolated N-uitthy'iuciiC--^ vchloro! â€¢ pyridinemethylamine is unstable and difficult to handle-<br>

[0043]<br>

Further, in the present invention, the N-metliylideneamine oligomer (11) may also be obtained in a suigle step by reacting the substituted methyl compound (XI) with hexametliyleuetetramine and a base.<br>
In this case also, the pH of the reaction liquid is typically vrithin a range from 9 to 12, and is preferably controlled withm a range from 9.5 to 11.5, and more preferably from 10 to 11.

In this case also, the pH of the reaction liquid is typically within a range from 9 to 12, and is preferably controlled within a range from 9.5 to 11.5, and more preferably from 10 to 11.

[0048]<br>
Becau.se this process replaces hexamethylenetetramine with ammonia or an ammonium salt and formaldehyde or a formaldehyde equivalent, all of which are low-cost industrial raw materials, it is particularly advantageous in the case of mass<br>
[0049]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on tlie ammonia used, and gaseous ammonia or an aqueous solution or alcohol solution or the like of aranioma may be used. In tjiose cases where an ammonia aqueous solution is used, the concentration of the solution is typically within a range from 5 to 25%, and is preferably from 10 to 25%. Further, an anxuionium salt may be used in.'jtead of the ammonia.

[0050J<br>
There me no particular restrictions on the foritialdehyde used, and an aqueous solution or alcohol solution or the like of formaldehyde may be used.  Ftutheraiore, a fonnaldehyde equivalent may also be used instead of foimaldebyde. An. example of the formaldehyde equivalent is paraformaldehyde, which is a polymer of formaldehyde.

[0052]<br>
Furthermore, in those cases where the solution containing the recovered anamonia and fonnaldehyde is used in a continuotis process, the solution may be used as is, although m those cases where the ratio of ammonia and formaldehyde within the<br><br>
recovered Solution differs from the ratio required to en.'jure continuvty of the inaction, a supplementan' amount of the component among the auimonia and the aldehyde that is lacking must be added to the solution. In other words, if the amount of ammonia is insufficient, then amtnonia or an ammonium salt is added, whereas if the amount of the formaldehyde is insufficient, fonnaldehyde or a fonnaldehyde equivalent is added, thereby adjusting the ratio between the aumionia and the formaldehyde to the optimum ratio. This optimum ratio varies depending on factors such as the reaction conditions, but the amount of the formaldehyde is typically within a i^mge from 0.1 to 20 mol, and preferably fiom 1 to 2 mol, per 1 mol of the ammonia. [0053]<br>
In those cases where a mixture of the substituted raethyl compound (XI) with either hexamethylenetetramine, or ammonia or the like and formaldehyde or the like is used instead of the axnmonium salt compound (I), the base and solvent used, and other factors such as the reaction temperatoe and the like may aU be the same as those described above for the reaction that uses the ammonium salt compo^md (I).

An additional 4 ml of toluene was then added to the reaction mij^ture, and the toluene layer and water layer<br><br>
were each separated. The hexamethylenctetTajiiine was recovered from the water layer-arid the recovery rate was 69" o, .<br>
[0091]<br>
Orx the other hand, 7 g of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to the toluene layer, and tlie resulting water layer containing the hydrochloride salt of an N-methyUdene-(2-cMoro-pyridin-5-yl)methylarDine oligomer (11-5) or a mixture of two or more such salts was separated. 3.2 g of methanol was added to the separated water layer, and the resulting mixture was treated for 3 hours at 60^*0, yielding an aqueous solution of the hydrochloride salt of (2.chloropyridin-5-yl)methylamine. Analysis by HPLC revealed an amount of the (2-chloropyridin-5-yl)methylamiae of 1.28 g (yield: 90%).<br>
