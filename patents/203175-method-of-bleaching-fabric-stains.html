1.   TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
METHOD OF BLEACHING FABRIC STAINS<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, of Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method for bleaching stained fabrics, more particularly by pretreating the stained fabric, before washing, with a pretreatment composition that comprises an organic ligand that forms a transition metal complex as bleach catalyst.  The invention further relates to the use of the ligand or complex in a pretreatment composition for applying to stained fabrics prior to washing in an aqueous wash liquor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
EP-A-0909809 discloses a class of iron coordination complexes useful as catalysts for the bleach activation of peroxy compounds, including iron complexes comprising the ligand N,N-bis(pyridin-2-yl-methyl)-1, 1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-1-aminoethane, also referred to as MeN4Py.  These catalysts are said to be useful in bleaching systems comprising a peroxy compound or a precursor thereof, such as in the washing and bleaching of substrates including laundry, dishwashing and hard surface cleaning, or for bleaching in the textile, paper and woodpulp industries, and in waste water treatment.<br>
In our co-pending application PCT/GB99/02876, we describe methods for catalytically bleaching substrates with atmospheric oxygen in aqueous medium, using metal ligand complexes as catalytic bleaching agents.  These methods are said to be particularly applicable to bleaching of laundry fabrics, suitably in detergent formulations, but also may be used for hard surface cleaning, waste-water treatment, pulp bleaching in paper manufacture, leather manufacture, dye<br><br><br>
transfer inhibition, food processing, starch bleaching, sterilisation, whitening in oral hygiene preparations and/or contact lens disinfection.<br>
However, there remains a need for improved methods of bleaching stained laundry fabrics.  Thus, it would be desirable to be able to effect improved bleaching of particular stain types.  It would also be desirable to be able to bleach a broader profile of stain types more effectively.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
We have now found that improved or -broader stain profile<br>
bleaching can be achieved in accordance with the present<br>
invention, by using a specified ligand or transition metal<br>
complex bleach catalyst to pretreat stained fabrics prior to<br>
washing.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a method of bleaching fabric stains comprising applying a pretreatment composition to a stained fabric, and subsequently washing the pretreated fabric in an aqueous wash liquor, wherein:<br>
the pretreatment composition comprises a ligand which forms a complex with a transition metal, the complex catalysing bleaching of stains by atmospheric oxygen; and<br>
one or both of the pretreatment composition and the wash liquor are substantially devoid of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system.<br><br><br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides the use of a ligand which forms a complex with a transition metal, the complex catalysing bleaching of stains by atmospheric oxygen, in a pretreatment composition for applying to stained fabrics prior to stain bleaching by washing the pretreated fabric in an aqueous wash liquor.<br>
Preferably, the ligand is N,N-bis(pyridin-2-yl-methyl)-1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-1-aminoethane, and the complex is an iron complex.<br>
We have found that certain stain types can be more effectively bleached on stained fabrics by the pretreatment. Thus, the bleaching of oily stains such as tomato stain can be improved by the pretreatment.  For stains of this type, a peroxygen bleach such as hydrogen peroxide, or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system, may be present or absent in the pretreatment composition, but preferably is absent. Bleaching of tea stains may also be improved by the pretreatment.  For stains of this type, a peroxygen bleach such as hydrogen peroxide, or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system, should be present in the pretreatment composition.<br>
In order to provide a more effective bleaching performance over a range of different stain types, it is preferred that one of the pretreatment composition and the wash liquor comprises a peroxygen bleach such as hydrogen peroxide or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system. Thus, the other of the pretreatment composition and the wash liquor is free of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach<br><br><br>
system.  Since the specificity of catalytic bleaching for particular stain types may be altered according to the presence or absence of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach systems, a broader stain profile may be bleached more effectively by ensuring that either the pretreatment or the wash liquor, but not both, comprise peroxy bleach.<br>
For example, it may be postulated that 'catalytic bleaching with atmospheric oxygen will predominate in the wash liquor during the wash cycle when the wash liquor is substantially devoid of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system, so as to favour bleaching of tomato stain types over tea stain types, whereas peroxy bleach catalysis will predominate during the pretreatment if the pretreatment compotition comprises peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system, so as to favour bleaching of tea stain types over tomato stain types.<br>
Alternatively, the peroxygen bleach or peroxy-based or -generating bleach system could absent from the pretreatment composition and present only in the wash liquor so as to favour the bleaching of tomato stain types during the pretreatment and the bleaching of tea stain types during the main wash cycle.  By altering the specificity of bleaching for particular stain types between the pretreatment step and the main wash step, a broad stain profile bleaching can be effected.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, therefore, the pretreatment composition comprises peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or<br><br><br>
-generating bleach system and the wash liquor is substantially devoid of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system.  In this embodiment, preferably the stained fabric comprises a tea stain.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the pretreatment composition is substantially devoid of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system and the wash liquor comprises peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system.  In this embodiment, preferably the stained fabric comprises a tomato, oil or tomato/oil stain.<br>
We have also found that the bleaching effect on certain stain types, for example tomato/oil stain types, may be enhanced by the presence of unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, or esters thereof, preferably unsaturated fatty acid oils, in the pretreatment composition.  Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the pretreatment composition comprises an unsaturated fatty acid oil in combination with the ligand or complex.  The unsaturated fatty oils are relatively inexpensive and it is postulated that similar materials will serve to provide a similar bleach enhancing activity. Enhancement of the bleaching process will likely be found in compounds having a hydrogen that is relatively prone to abstraction by a free radical. Other examples of compounds that are likely suitable as bleach enhancers are found in compounds containing an allylic hydrogen, a hydrogen alpha to an ether (anomeric effect), a hydrogen alpha to an amine, a benzylic hydrogen etc.<br><br><br>
Any suitable fabric that is susceptible to stain bleaching or one that one might wish to subject to bleaching may be used.  Preferably the fabric is a laundry fabric or garment. In a preferred embodiment, the method according to the present invention is carried out on a laundry fabric using an aqueous pretreatment composition.  In particular, the treatment may be effected prior to a conventional wash cycle.<br>
The pretreatment composition will comprise at least the ligand or complex in combination with a suitable medium, such as an agueous or nonaqueous solvent, or an inert carrier such as a filler.  It will .be appreciated that the composition may take any suitable form, such as a solid, powder, paste, gel or liquid.  Preferably, the pretreatment composition is in the form of a liquid.<br>
The pretreatment composition may be applied to the stained fabric by any suitable delivery method, for example by spraying as a liquid or dry powder, from a liquid, gel or paste applicator, or from a bar.  Preferably, the pretreated fabric is left for at least 5 minutes, preferably at least 15 minutes, more preferably at least 50 minutes, before washing.<br>
The pretreatment composition may be contacted to the textile fabric in any suitable manner.  For example, it may be applied in dry form, such as in powder form, particularly to wetted fabrics, or in a liquor, for example as an aqueous spray-on fabric treatment fluid, or a non-aqueous dry<br><br><br>
cleaning fluid or spray-on aerosol fluid, to dry or wet fabrics.<br>
Suitable pretreatment means for application of the ligand or complex to the textile material prior to the main wash include sprays, pens, roller-ball devices, bars, soft solid applicator sticks and impregnated cloths or cloths containing microcapsules. Such means are well known in the analogous art of deodorant application and/or in spot treatment of textiles.<br>
The present invention also extends to a commercial package comprising a ligand or complex preferably as defined below together with instructions for its use.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION oF THE INVENTION<br>

Alternatively, the catalyst may comprise a free ligand that complexes with a transition metal already present in the water or that complexes with a transition metal present in the substrate.

aminoalkylene, alkylene ether, carboxylic ester or carboxylic amide, and<br>
each R5 independently represents an optionally N-substituted aminoalkyl group or an optionally substituted heteroaryl group selected from pyridinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, benzimidazolyl, pyrimidinyl, triazolyl and thiazolyl.<br>
Ligands of the class represented by general formula (IVE) are also particularly preferred according to the invention. The iigand having the general formula (IVE), as defined above, is a pentadentate Iigand.  By pentadentate' herein is meant that five hetero atoms can coordinate to the metal M ion in the metal-complex.<br>
In formula (IVE), one coordinating hetero atom is provided by the nitrogen atom in the methylamine backbone, and preferably one coordinating hetero atom is contained in each of the four R1 and R2 side groups.  Preferably, all the coordinating hetero atoms are nitrogen atoms.<br>
The Iigand of formula (IVE) preferably comprises at least two substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl groups in the four side groups.  The heteroaryl group is preferably a pyridin-2-yl group and, if substituted, preferably a methyl-or ethyl-substituted pyridin-2-yl group.  More preferably, the heteroaryl group is an unsubstituted pyridin-2-yl group. Preferably, the heteroaryl group is linked to methylamine, and preferably to the N atom thereof, via  a methylene group. Preferably, the Iigand of formula (IVE) contains at least one optionally substituted amino-alkyl side group, more<br><br><br>
preferably two amino-ethyl side groups, in particular 2-(N-alkyl)amino-ethyl or 2-(N,N-dialkyl)amino-ethyl.<br>
Thus, in formula (IVE) preferably R1 represents pyridin-2-yl or R2 represents pyridin-2-yl-methyl.  Preferably R2 or R1 represents 2-amino-ethyl, 2-(N-(m)ethyl)amino-ethyl or 2-(N,N-di(m)ethyl)amino-ethyl.  If substituted, R5 preferably represents 3-methyl pyridin-2-yl.  R3 preferably represents hydrogen, benzyl or methyl.<br>

In a fifth embodiment of the second variant, the ligand represents a pentadentate or hexadentate ligand of general formula (VE):<br>
R1N1-W-NF1R2<br>
(VE) wherein<br>
each R1 independently represents -R3-V, in which R3 represents optionally substituted alkylene, alkenylene, oxyalkylene, aminoalkylene or alkylene ether, and V represents an optionally substituted heteroaryl group selected from pyridinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, benzimidazolyl, pyrimidinyl, triazolyl and thiazolyl;<br>
W represents an optionally substituted alkylene bridging group selected from<br>
-CH2CH2-, -CH2CH2CH2-, -CH2CH2CH2CH2-, -CH2-C6H4-CH2-, -CH2-C6H10-CH2-, and -CH2-C10H6-CH2-; and<br><br><br>
R2 represents a group selected from R1, and alkyl, aryl and arylalkyl groups optionally substituted with a substituent selected from hydroxy, alkoxy, phenoxy, carboxylate, carboxamide, carboxylic ester, sulphonate, amine, alkylamine and N+(R4)3 , wher.ein R4 is selected from hydrogen, alkanyl, alkenyl, arylalkanyl, arylalkenyl, oxyalkanyl, oxyalkenyl, aminoalkanyl, aminoalkenyl, alkanyl ether and alkenyl ether.<br>
The ligand having the general formula (VE), as defined above, is a pentadentate ligand or, if R1=R2, can be a hexadentate ligand.  As mentioned above, by pentadentate' is meant that five hetero atoms can coordinate to the metal M ion in the metal-complex.  Similarly, by 'hexadentate' is meant that six hetero atoms can in principle coordinate to the metal M ion.  However, in this case it is believed that one of the arms will not be bound in the complex, so that the hexadentate ligand will be penta coordinating.<br>
In the formula (VE), two hetero atoms are linked by the bridging group W and one coordinating hetero atom is contained in each of the three R1 groups.  Preferably, the coordinating hetero atoms are nitrogen atoms.<br>
The ligand of formula (VE) comprises at least one optionally substituted heteroaryl group in each of the three R1 groups. Preferably, the heteroaryl group is a pyridin-2-yl group, in particular a methyl- or ethyl-substituted pyridin-2-yl group.  The heteroaryl group is linked'to an N atom in formula (VE), preferably via  an alkylene group, more preferably a methylene group.  Most preferably, the<br><br><br>
heteroaryl group is a 3-methyl-pyridin-2-yl group linked to an N atom via  methylene.<br>
The group R2 in formula (VE) is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aryl or arylalkyl group, or a group R1. However, preferably R2 is different from each of the groups R1 in the formula above.  Preferably, R2 is methyl, ethyl, benzyl, 2-hydroxyethyl or 2-methoxyethyl.  More preferably, R2 is methyl or ethyl.<br>
The bridging group W may  be a substituted or unsubstituted alkylene group selected from -CH2CH2-, -CK2CH2CH2-, -CH2CH2CH-2CH2-, -CH2-C6H4-CH2-, -CH2-C6H10-CH2-, and -CH2-C10H.5-CH2-(wherein -C6H4-, -C6H10, -C1oH5- can be ortho-, para-,   or meta-CeHi-,   -CGH10-, -C10H6-) .  Preferably, the bridging group W is an ethylene or 1,4-butylene group, more preferably an ethylene group.<br>
Preferably, V represents substituted pyridin-2-yl,<br>
especially methyl-substituted or ethyl-substituted pyridin-<br>
2-yl, and most preferably V represents 3-methyl pyridin-2-<br>
yl.	■■'<br>
(F)  Ligands of the classes disclosed in WO-A-98/39098 and WO-A-98/39406.<br>
The counter ions Y in formula (Al) balance the charge z on the complex formed by the ligand L, metal M and coordinating species X.  Thus, if the charge z is positive, Y may be an anion such as RCOO", Bph4", C104", BF4", PF6", RS03", RS04", S042' , N03~, F~, CI", Br", or I",  with R being hydrogen,<br><br><br>
optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted aryl. If z is negative, Y may be a common cation such as an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or (alkyl)ammonium cation.<br>
Suitable counter ions Y include those which give rise to the formation of storage-stable solids.  Preferred counter ions for the preferred metal complexes are selected from R7COO~, C104", BF4~, PF5~, RSCV (in particular CF3SO3") , RS04~, S042~ , N03", F~, Cl~, Br", and I", wherein R represents hydrogen or optionally substituted phenyl, naphthyl or C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
It will be appreciated that the complex (Al) can be formed by any appropriate means, including in  situ   formation whereby precursors of the complex are transformed into the active complex of general formula (Al) under conditions of storage cr use.  Preferably, the complex is formed as a well-defined complex or in a solvent mixture comprising a salt of the metal M and the ligand L or ligand L-generating species.  Alternatively, the catalyst may be formed in  situ from suitable precursors for the complex, for example in a solution or dispersion containing the precursor materials. In one such example, the active catalyst may be formed in situ  in a mixture comprising a salt of the metal M and the ligand L, or a ligand L-generating species, in a suitable solvent.  Thus, for example, if M is iron, an iron salt such as FeS04 can be mixed in solution with the ligand L, or a ligand L-generating species, to form the active complex. Thus, for example, the composition may formed from a mixture of the ligand L and a metal salt MXn in which preferably n=l-5, more preferably 1-3.  In another such example, the ligand L, or a ligand L-generating species, can be mixed with metal<br><br><br>
M ions present in the substrate or wash liquor to form the active catalyst in  situ.     Suitable ligand L-generating species include metal-free compounds or metal coordination complexes that comprise the ligand .L and can be substituted by metal M ions to form the active complex according the formula (Al) .<br>
In typical washing compositions the level of the catalyst is such that the in-use level is from luM to 50mM, with preferred in-use levels for domestic laundry operations falling in the range 10 to 100 uM.<br>
Preferably, the pretreatment medium or wash liquor has a pH in the range from pK 6 to 13, more preferably from pH 6 tc 11, still more preferably from pH 8 to 11, and most preferably from pH 8 to 10, in particular from pK 9 to 10.<br>
In the context of the present invention bleaching should be understood as relating generally to the decolourisation of stains or of other materials attached to or associated with a substrate.  However, it is envisaged that the present invention can be applied where a requirement is the removal and/or neutralisation by an oxidative bleaching reaction of malodours or other undesirable components attached to or otherwise associated with a substrate.  Furthermore, in the context of the present invention bleaching is to be understood as being restricted to any bleaching mechanism or process that does not require the presence of light or activation by light.  Thus, photobleaching compositions and processes relying on the use of photobleach catalysts or<br><br><br>
photobleach activators and the presence of light are excluded from the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, one or both of the pretreatment composition and the wash liquor are substantially devoid of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system, whereby the catalytic bleaching by atmospheric oxygen or 'air will predominate. However, in this case it will be appreciated that small amounts of hydrogen peroxide or peroxy-based or -generating systems may be included in the composition, if desired. Therefore, by "substantially aevoid of peroxygen bleach or peroxy-based or -generating bleach systems" is meant that the composition contains from 0 to 50 %, preferably from 0 to 10 %, more preferably from 0 to 5 %, and optimally from 0 to 2 % by molar weight on an oxygen basis, of peroxygen bleach or peroxy-based or -generating bleach systems. Preferably, however, the composition will be wholly devoid of peroxygen bleach or peroxy-based or -generating bleach systems.<br>
Thus, at least 10 %, preferably at least, 50 % and optimally at least 90 % of any bleaching of the s-tai.n substrate is effected by oxygen sourced from the air.<br>
According to the present invention, preferably one of the pretreatment composition and the wash liquor contains a peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating system. The peroxy bleach may be a compound which is capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide  in  aqueous  solution.   Hydrogen peroxide sources are well known in the art. They include the alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxides such as urea<br><br><br>
peroxide, and inorganic persalts, such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates persilicates and persulphates. Mixtures of two or more such compounds may also be suitable.<br>
Particularly preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate and, especially, sodium perborate monohydrate. Sodium perborate monohydrate is preferred because of its high active oxygen content. Sodium percarbonate may also be preferred for environmental reasons. The amount thereof in the composition of the invention usually will be within the range of about 5-35 % by weight, preferably from 10-25 % by weight.<br>
Another suitable hydrogen peroxide -generating system is a combination of a C1-C4 alkanol oxidase and e.  C1-C4 alkanol, especially a combination of methanol oxidase (MOX) and ethanol. Such combinations are disclosed in WO-A-9507972, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Alkylhydroxy peroxides are another class of peroxy bleaching compounds. Examples of these materials include cumene hydroperoxide and- t-butyl hydroperoxide.<br>
Organic peroxyacids may also be suitable as the peroxy bleaching compound. Such materials normally have the general formula:<br>
O II Y-R-C—O-OH<br>
wherein R is an alkyl- or alkylidene- or substituted alkylene group containing from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms,<br><br><br>
optionally having an internal amide linkage; or a phenylene or substituted phenylene group; and Y is hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, aryl, an imido-aromatic or non-aromatic group, a -COOH or -COOOH group or a quaternary ammonium group.<br>
Typical monoperoxy acids useful herein include, for example: (i)  peroxybenzoic acid and ring-substituted peroxybenzoic<br>
acids, e.g. peroxy-a-naphthoic acid; (ii) aliphatic, substituted aliphatic and arylalkyl<br>
monoperoxyacids, e.g. peroxylauric acid, peroxystearic<br>
acid and N,N-phthaloylaminoperoxy caproic acid (PAP);<br>
and (iii)     6-octylamino-6-oxo-peroxyhexanoic acid.<br>
Typical diperoxyacids useful herein include, for example:<br>
(iv) 1,12-diperoxydodecanedioic acid (DPDA);<br>
(v)  1,9-diperoxyazelaic acid;<br>
(vi) diperoxybrassylic acid; diperoxysebacic acid and<br>
diperoxyisophthalic acid; (vii)     2-decyldiperoxybutane-l, 4-dioic acid; and (viii)    4,4'-sulphonylbisperoxybenzoic acid.<br>
Also inorganic peroxyacid compounds are suitable, such as for example potassium monopersulphate (MPS). If organic or inorganic peroxyacids are used as the peroxygen compound, the amount thereof will normally be within the range of about 2-10 % by weight, preferably from 4-8 % by weight.<br>
All these peroxy compounds may be utilized alone or in conjunction with a peroxyacid bleach precursor and/or an organic bleach catalyst not containing a transition metal.<br><br>
Generally, the pretreatment composition can be suitably formulated to contain from 2 to 35%, preferably from 5 to 25% by weight, of the peroxy bleaching agent.<br>
Peroxyacid bleach precursors are known and amply described in literature, such as in GB-A-836988; GB-A-864,798; GB-A-907,356; GB-A-1, 003, 310 and GB-A-1,'519, 351; DE-A-3, 337, 921 ; EP-A-0,185, 522; EP-A-0,174,132; EP-A-0, 120, 591; andUS-A-1,246,339; US-A-3,332,882; US-A-4,128,494; US-A-4,412,934 and US-A-4,675,393.<br>
Another useful class of peroxyacid bleach precursors is that of the cationic i.e. quaternary ammonium substituted peroxyacid precursors as disclosed in US-A-4,751,015 and US-A-4,397, /57, in EP-A-0,284,292 and EP-A-331,229.  Examples of peroxyacid bleach precursors of this class are: 2-(N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium) ethyl sodium-4-sulphophenyl carbonate chloride - (SPCC);<br>
N-octyl,N, N-dimethyl-Nio-carbophenoxy decyl ammonium chloride - (ODC) ;<br>
3-(N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium) propyl sodium-4-sulphophenyl carboxylate; and N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium toluyloxy benzene sulphonate.<br>
A further special class of bleach precursors is formed by the cationic nitriles as disclosed in EP-A-303,520; EP-A-458,396 and EP-A-464,880.<br><br><br>
Any one of these peroxyacid bleach precursors can be used in the present invention, although some may be more preferred than others.<br>
Of the above classes of bleach precursors, the preferred classes are the esters, including acyl phenol sulphonates and acyl alkyl phenol sulphonates; the acyl-amides; and the quaternary ammonium substituted peroxyacid precursors including the cationic nitriles.<br>
Examples of said preferred peroxyacid bleach precursors or activators are sodium-4-benzoyloxy benzene sulphonate (SBOBS); N,N,N'N!-tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED); sodium-l-methyl-2-benzoyloxy benzene-4-sulphonate; sodium-4-methyl-3-benzolcxy benzoate; 2-(N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium) ethyl sodium-4-sulphophenyl carbonate chloride (SPCC); trimethyl ammonium toluyloxy-benzene sulphonate; sodium nonanoyloxybenzene sulphonate (SNOBS); sodium 3,5,5-trimethyl hexanoyl-oxybenzene sulphonate (STHOBS); and the substituted cationic nitriles.<br>
The precursors may be used in an amount of up to 12 %, preferably from 2-10 % by weight, of the pretreatment composition.<br>
The method of the present invention has particular application as a pretreatment in detergent bleaching, especially for laundry cleaning.  Accordingly, the method preferably uses a wash liquor that contains a surface-active material, optionally together with detergency builder.<br><br><br>
Optionally, the pretreatment composition may also include a surface-active material, optionally together with detergency builder.  The pretreatment composition may contain a surface-active material in an amount, for example, of from 10 to 50% by weight.<br>
The surface-active material may be naturally derived, such as soap, or a synthetic material selected from anionic, nonionic, amphoteric, zwitterionic, cationic actives and mixtures thereof.  Many suitable actives are commercially available and are fully described in the literature, for example in "Surface'Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
Typical synthetic anionic surface-actives are usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of organic sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl groups containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term "alky]." being used to include the alkyl portion of higher aryl groups.  Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds are sodium and ammonium alkyl sulphates, especially those obtained by sulphating higher (C8-C18) alcohols produced, for example, from tallow or coconut oil; sodium and ammonium alkyl (C9-C20) benzene sulphonates, particularly sodium linear secondary alkyl (C10-C15) benzene sulphonates; sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil fatty acid monoglyceride sulphates and sulphonates; sodium and ammonium salts of sulphuric acid esters of higher (C9-C18) fatty alcohol alkylene oxide, particularly ethylene oxide, reaction products; the reaction products of fatty acids such<br><br><br>
as coconut fatty acids esterified with isethionic acid and neutralised with sodium hydroxide; sodium and ammonium salts of fatty acid amides of methyl taurine; alkane monosulphonates such as those derived by reacting alpha-olefins (C8-C20) with sodium bisulphite and those derived by reacting paraffins with S02 and Cl2 and then hydrolysing with a base to produce a random sulphonate; sodium and ammonium (C7-C12) dialkyl sulphosuccinates; and olefin sulphonates, which term is used to describe material made by reacting olefins, particularly (C1o-C2o) alpha-ol'efins, with S03 and then neutralising and hydrolysing the reaction product.  The preferred anionic detergent compounds are sodium (C10-C15) aikylbenzene sulphonates, and sodium (C16-C19) alkyl ether sulphates.<br>
Examples of suitable nonionic surface-active compounds which may be used, preferably together with the anionic surface-active compounds, include, in particular, the reaction products of alkylene oxides, usually ethylene oxide, with alkyl (C6-C22) phenols, generally 5-25 EO, i.e. 5-25 units of ethylene oxides per molecule; and the condensation products of aliphatic (C8-C18) primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, generally 2-30 EO.  Other so-called nonionic surface-actives include alkyl polyglycosides, sugar esters, long-chain tertiary amine oxides, long-chain tertiary phosphine oxides and dialkyl sulphoxides.<br>
Amphoteric or zwitterionic surface-active compounds can also be used in the compositions of the invention but this is not normally desired owing to their relatively high cost.  If<br><br><br>
any amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compounds are used, it is generally in small amounts in compositions based on the much more commonly used synthetic anionic and nonionic actives.<br>
The pretreatmervt composition will preferably comprise from 1 to 15 % wt of anionic surfactant and from 10 to 40 % by weight of nonionic surfactant.  In a further preferred embodiment, the detergent active system is free from C16-C12;.: fatty acid soaps.<br>
The pretreatment composition may also contain a detergency builder, for example in an amount of from about 5 to 80 I by weight, preferably from about 10 to 60 % by weight.<br>
Builder materials may be selected from 1) calcium sequestrant materials, 2) precipitating materials, 3) calcium ion-exchange materials and 4) mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of calcium sequestrant builder materials include alkali metal polyphosphates, such as sodium tripolyphosphate; nitrilotriacetic acid and its water-soluble salts; the alkali metal salts of carboxymethyloxy succinic acid, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, mellitic acid, -benzene polycarboxylic acids, citric acid; and polyacetal carboxylates as disclosed in US-A-4,144,226 and US-A-4,146, 495 .<br>
Examples of precipitating builder materials include sodium orthophosphate and sodium carbonate.<br><br><br>
Examples of calcium ion-exchange builder materials include the various types of water-insoluble crystalline or amorphous aluminosilicates, of which zeolites are the best known representatives, e.g. zeolite A, zeolite B (also known as zeolite P), zeolite C, zeolite X, zeolite Y and also the zeolite P-type as described in EP-A-0,384,070.<br>
In particular, the pretreatment composition or wash liquor may contain any one of the organic and inorganic builder materials, though, for environmental reasons, phosphate builders are preferably omitted or only used in very small amounts.  Typical builders usable in the present invention are, for example, sodium carbonate, calcite/carbonate, the sodium salt of nitrilotriacetic acid, sodium citrate, carboxymethyloxy malonate, carboxymethyloxy succinate and water-insoluble crystalline or amorphous aluminosilicate builder materials, each of which can be used as the main builder, either alone or in admixture with minor amounts of other builders or polymers as co-builder.<br>
It is preferred that the pretreatment composition contains not more than 5% by weight of a carbonate builder, expressed as sodium carbonate, more preferably not more than 2.5 % by weight to substantially nil, if the composition pH lies in the lower alkaline region of up to 10.<br>
Apart from the components already mentioned, the pretreatment composition or wash liquor can contain any of the conventional additives in amounts of which such materials are normally employed in fabric washing detergent compositions.  Examples of these additives include buffers<br><br><br>
such as carbonates, lather boosters, such as alkanolamides, particularly the monoethanol amides derived from palmkernel fatty acids and coconut fatty acids; lather depressants, such as alkyl phosphates and silicones; anti-redeposition agents, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and alkyl or substituted alkyl cellulose ethers; stabilisers, such as phosphonic acid derivatives (i.e. Bequest® types); fabric softening agents; inorganic salts and alkaline buffering agents, such as sodium sulphate and sodium silicate; and, usually in very small amounts, fluorescent agents; perfumes; enzymes, such as proteases, cellulases, lipases, amylases and oxidases; germicides and colourants.<br>
Transition metal sequestrants such as EDTA, and phosphonic acid derivatives such as EDTMP (ethylene diamine tetra(methylene phosphonate)) may also be included, in addition to the catalyst ligand specified, for example to improve the stability sensitive ingredients such as enzymes, fluorescent agents and perfumes, but provided the composition remains bleaching effective.  However, the pretreatment composition containing the catalyst, is preferably substantially, and more preferably completely, devoid of transition metal sequestrants (other than the catalyst ligand).<br>

Example 2<br>
In Example 2 the iron chloride complex of MeN4py [FeMeM4pyCl;] was used.  The iron chloride complex of MeN4py was prepared as follows from the MeN4py ligand synthesised as in EP 0909809.  MeN4Py ligand (33.7 g; 88.5mmoles) was dissolved in 500ml dry methanol. Small portions of FeCl2.4H20 (0.95eq; 16.7g; 84.0 mmoles) were added, yielding a clear red solution. After addition, the solution was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature, after which the methanol was removed (rotary-evaporator). The dry solid was ground and 150 ml of ethylacetate was added and the mixture was stirred until a fine red powder was obtained. This powder was washed twice with ethyl acetate, dried in the air and further dried under vacuum (40 °C). El. Anal. Calc. for<br>

Oils were applied on the BC-1 cloth by the following procedure. First an oil was dissolved in a heptane solution<br><br><br>
(40 mg liquid per ml heptane solution), then 0.72 ml of this solution was applied to a BC-1 (tea) cloth of 6x6 cm, yielding 5% oil on the cloth. The two oils employed were medium chain triglyceride oil (fully saturated oil) and sunflower oil (SF) (poly-unsaturated oil containing a high quantity of 2 or 3 double bonds in the esterified fatty acid chains). Subsequently the cloths were brought into contact with a 10 mM carbonate buffer solution (pH 10) containing 10 microM of FeMeN4pyCl2 in and mixed for 30 minutes at 30 :C (liquor-to-cloth ratio of 40:1). In comparative experiments the same cloths were treated without the iron catalyst in the buffer solution.<br>
After incubation, the cloths were washed three times with demin-water, then dried in a tumble drier and stored in the dark (wrapped in aluminum foil). The bleach results of the cloths, obtained after various periods of times are given in the table below. The reflectance of the cloths was measured with a Minolta™ 3700d spectrophotometer at 460 nm. The difference in reflectance before and after the wash/storage is defined as a AR460 value; a higher value indicates a better bleaching of the BC-1 stain. The bleaching values were determined immediately after the wash, after 4, 10, 17 and 24 days storage.<br>
Table 3: bleaching performance of the iron catalyst on BC-1 in the absence of oil, in the presence of MCT oil and Sunflower oil. The bleaching activity is expressed as a AR460 value (a higher value indicates a cleaner cloth).<br><br><br>

The results given in Table 3 are indicative of that the presence of unsaturated oil in treatment gives an increased BC-1 bleaching upon storage in the air (last column). Thus the pre-treatment of the stain with unsaturated oil yields as detailed above provides improved air bleaching.<br><br><br>
