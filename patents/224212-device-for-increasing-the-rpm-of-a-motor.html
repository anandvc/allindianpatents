				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a device to increase revolution per minute of any electric<br>
motor. Particularly, the present device is able to increase the rptn of existing motor 5 to 50<br>
tunes.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
Hiectric motors are basically used to convert electric energy into mechanical energy for<br>
performing various task and activities in various fields. Therefore, various types of motors,<br>
which are characterised on the basis of power, revolution per minute, load carrying capacity,<br>
exist in the industry and day-to-day work. In previous years, various models of motors have<br>
been launched which are very specific and directed for specific task and activity. Some time<br>
the motors are selected for getting high load carrying capacity, less noise, higher rpm etc.<br>
Industrial motors come in a variety of basic types. These variations are suitable for many<br>
different applications. Naturally, some types of motors are more suited for certain<br>
applications. The motors available are,<br>
• AC Motors<br>
• DC Motors<br>
• Brushless DC Motors<br>
• Servo Motors<br>
• Brushed DC Servo Motors<br>
• Brushless A ( ' Servo Motors<br>
• Stepper Motors<br>
• Linear Motors<br>
AC Motors<br>
The most common and simple industrial motor is the three-phase AC induction motor,<br>
sometimes known as the "squirrel cage" motor. The disadvantages associated with these are<br>
• Expensive speed control<br>
• Inability to operate at low speeds<br>
• Poor positioning control<br>
Expensive speed control<br>
Speed control is expensive. The electronics required to handle an AC inverter drive are<br>
considerably more expensive than those required to handle a DC motor. However, if<br>
performance requirements can be met - meaning that the required speed range is over l/3rd<br>
of base speed -- AC inverters and AC motors are usually more cost-effective than DC motors<br>
and DC drives for applications larger than about 10 horsepower, because of cost savings in<br>
the AC motor.<br>
Inability to operate at desired speeds<br>
Standard AC motors should not be operated at speeds less than about 3 to 10 times of base<br>
speed. This is due to thermal considerations. A DC motor should be considered for these<br>
applications.<br>
Poor positioning control<br>
Positioning control is expensive and crude. Even a vector drive is very crude when<br>
controlling a standard AC motor. Servomotors are more appropriate for these applications.<br>
DC Motors<br>
The bnished DC motor is one of the earliest motor designs. The disadvantages associated<br>
with these are<br>
• Expensive to produce<br>
• Can't reliably control at lowest speeds<br>
• Physically larger<br>
• High maintenance<br>
• Dust<br>
• Distortion of brushes<br>
Presently the motors are available, which can run at any desired rpm efficiently. The size of<br>
motors have to designed for specific load and rpm, at the same time the rpm can be controlled<br>
by varying input voltage by means of auto transformer/autotransformer or any other control<br>
means. Hence, manufacturing a motor with such features involve very high cost. There is no<br>
such device known or available, which enhances the rpm of motor, without utilizing such<br>
voltage transformer, or rheostat, means. In order to overcome the above-said drawbacks the<br>
applicants have come out with a novel device, which can be mounted with any motor<br>
available in the market and capable to increase its rpm for at any desired level.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a device for increasing revolution<br>
per minute of a motor More particularly, the device increases the speed of the motor by 5 to<br>
50 times.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a device for increasing revolution per<br>
minute, which is cost effective, simple and reliable in operation.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to develop a device, which obviate the aforesaid<br>
drawbacks.<br>

The device for increasing rpm of a motor comprising one or more housing, which are made<br>
of cast iron, being connected to the outer cover of motor, through one or more connecting<br>
means. The housing accommodates two or more ball bearings. The ball bearings are being<br>
mounted on a primary shaft of housings. The ball bearings are located in each housing such<br>
that they do not remain in adjacent contact to one other i.e., one step of larger diameter is<br>
provided on the primary shaft between two ball bearings. The said steps prevent adjacent<br>
contact of ball bearings during operation. While the ball bearings are mounted on the primary<br>
shaft there always-small clearance is provided between shaft and inner race of ball bearing.<br>
1 lie tolerance is provided in the range of + 0,01 to + 0.03 mm.<br>
I he ball bearings have rough finish on its outer surface to prevent rotation of the bearings in<br>
housing. The ball bearings are made of case hardened steel.<br>
One end of the primary shaft has a cavity and other end having external thread. The shape<br>
and size of cavity is kept in accordance with corresponding male part of an attachment<br>
means. The shape of cavity may be in square, circular, triangular and hexagonal. The other<br>
end having external thread upon which a screw means is used for tightening a pulley on<br>
primary shaft. The pulley is made of Aluminum, Brass, Copper or Plastics of high surface<br>
finish. More preferably it is used made of glass filled Nylon.<br>
hach housing mean has one connecting mean, for connecting the housing with outer cover of<br>
motor. The connecting mean may be an integral part of housing and having two or more<br>
holes on the projected portion, which must be co-align with holes available on the outer cover<br>
of motor. There screw is used to fix housing means on motor. The length of connecting<br>
means selected such that the housing means should not come in contact to outer body of<br>
motor. The connecting is made of Cast iron, Steel or Aluminum.<br>
The said one or more pulley mounted on primary shaft being connected to one or more wheel<br>
mounted on parallel main shaft of a motor, through power transmitting means. The motor<br>
comprising a main shaft, consist one or more ball bearings of similar or variable diameter.<br>
One or more bearing of smaller diameter is mounted near to fan side and other bearings are<br>
mounted near to wheel More preferably, bearing of larger size is mounted near to wheel and<br>
bearing of smaller size near to fan for providing proper balancing and preventing eccentricity.<br>
The Applicant have found that if bearing of smaller diameter is mounted on wheel side and<br>
bearing of larger is mounted on fan cover side, there may be misalignment take place and<br>
consequently shaft may break or bend, which cause improper locking and bubbling while<br>
rotation.<br>
The said one or more wheel having grooves to hold power transmitting means. The grooves<br>
may be of any shape like round, V shape, half round, oval shape or edge round flat groove.<br>
The shape of groove is selected in such a way that power transmitting means like belt or any<br>
other means do not slip. The Applicants have found that for proper and desired power<br>
transmission the elongation percentage of selected belt material should be in the range of 250<br>
to 350 %. The width of the belt depend upon the size of wheel grooves which may be<br>
preferred 1mm to 2 mm for increasing 10 times higher rpm. The said belt is used to transmit<br>
power from wheel to primary pulley, which is mounted on primary shaft. The ratio of wheel<br>
diameter to pulley diameter is in the range of 10:1 to 50:1.<br>
