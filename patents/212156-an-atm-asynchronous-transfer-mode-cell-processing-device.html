				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a connecting scheme for a mobile<br>
communication system, and in particular, to a mobile communication system<br>
having a scheme for performing ATM-based connections between a<br>
controller and a transceiver subsystem of a base station, and between the<br>
base station and a mobile switching center.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
A typical mobile communication system includes a mobile switching center<br>
(MSC), a base station (BS) connected to the MSC by wire, and a mobile<br>
terminal or station (MT) with a wireless connection to the BS. The base<br>
station includes a base station controller (BSC) and a base station transceiver<br>
subsystem (BTS).<br>
In the conventional mobile communication system, a synchronous transfer<br>
mode (STM) or a connectionless packet transfer mode is used for the<br>
connection between the mobile switching center and the base station<br>
controller and the connection between the base station controller and the<br>
base station transceiver subsystem. Therefore, when connecting the mobile<br>
switching center to the base station controller or connecting the base station<br>
controller to the base station transceiver subsystem using a plurality of<br>
physical links, it can happen that the traffic becomes concentrated on just<br>
one of the physical links, thereby reducing the utilization efficiency of the<br>
overall system.<br>
In addition, in the STM system, each channel band (i.e, time slot) is assigned<br>
to a specific source for transmitting the traffic. Therefore, when the source<br>
has no traffic to transmit, the corresponding channel remains empty and the<br>
empty channel cannot be used by other sources. This reduces traffic<br>
transmission efficiency.<br>
In the near future, mobile communication systems will provide multimedia<br>
traffic services including the voice, data and image information. The voice,<br>
data and image information have different QoS (Quality of Service)<br>
conditions with respect to data loss and transmission delay, so that it is<br>
necessary to process the traffic according to QoS requirements. For example,<br>
with regard to voice transmission, the service quality is not greatly affected<br>
by minor data loss, but is drastically degraded when transmission delay<br>
occurs. On the contrary, with regard to data transmission, the service quality<br>
is not greatly affected by transmission delay, but is very susceptible to the<br>
effects of data loss. However, in the STM or connectionless packet transfer<br>
mode mobile communication system, it is not easy to manage the service<br>
quality according to the type of media or type of traffic so that it is not<br>
possible to provide an optimal service quality for each of the respective<br>
media.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

efficiency of physical links in a mobile communication system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described herein<br>
below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in<br>
detail since they would obscure this invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
In a mobile communication system according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the connection between the mobile switching center and<br>
the base station controller or between the base station controller and the base<br>
station transceiver subsystem is made based on the ATM (Asynchronous<br>
Transfer Mode) technique rather than the STM or connectionless packet<br>
transfer mode technique. Although the invention will be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to a mobile communication system, it is also<br>
possible to apply the invention to every ATM-based communication system<br>
employing IMA (Inverse Multiplexing for ATM) and AAL2 techniques.<br>
The invention has the following features. First, the invention uniformly<br>
disperses the traffic to a plurality of physical links by employing the IMA<br>
technique, thereby increasing utilization efficiency of the physical links.<br>
Second, since the invention uses the ATM technique, the channel band<br>
(virtual connection) is not fixed to a specific source. Therefore, any source<br>
having traffic to transmit can transmit the traffic through an available<br>
channel band, thus increasing the transmission efficiency of the traffic flow.<br>
Third, the invention sets an ATM virtual connection on the physical link by<br>
using the AAL2 (ATM Adaptation Layer 2) technique, and transmits the<br>
traffic over the set physical link. In ATM, an information unit having a fixed<br>
size, called a "cell", is used. Therefore, when the channel traffic to be<br>
transmitted is smaller in size than the payload of the cell, more than one<br>
traffic channel can be transmitted by multiplexing. Accordingly, as long as<br>
there is channel traffic to transmit, a cell is not transmitted with the payload<br>
being partially empty, thus increasing transmission efficiency. Fourth, by<br>
employing the ATM technique, the invention can control the service quality<br>
(loss and delay) according to ATM requirements.<br>
That is, when each service requires different quality, it is possible to satisfy<br>
the required service quality by setting the ATM connection suitable for the<br>
service quality.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a mobile communication system having an ATM-based<br>
connecting scheme according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The mobile communication system includes a base station transceiver<br>
subsystem (BTS) 100, a base station controller (BSC) 200, and a mobile<br>
switching center (MSC) 300. More specifically, the BTS 100, the BSC 200<br>
and the MSC 300 have ATM cell processors 170, 250 and 350, respectively.<br>
The BTS 100 includes an ATM interface 190 for connection with the BSC<br>
200; the BSC 200 includes an ATM interface 230 for connection with the<br>
BTS 100 and an ATM interface 270 for connection with the MSC 300; and<br>
the MSC 300 includes an ATM interface 330 for connection with the BSC<br>
200. Further, the MSC 300 includes an ATM interface 370 for ATM<br>
connection with another MSC or another network (e.g., ATM or STM). The<br>
ATM interface 230 in the BSC 200 can also be connected to a plurality of<br>
BTSs.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the BTS 100 includes a BTS main processor (BTP)<br>
110, an RF (Radio Frequency) processor 130, an RF-ATM converter 150, an<br>
ATM cell processor 170 and the ATM interface 190. The BTP 110 controls<br>
the overall operation of the BTS 100. The RF processor 130 exchanges radio<br>
information with mobile terminals (MT) 10-12, for radio connection (or<br>
access) to the mobile terminals 10-12. The RF processor 130 includes an<br>
antenna, a duplexer, a receiver, a transmitter and a baseband processor. The<br>
RF-ATM converter 150 converts the radio information received from the<br>
mobile terminals 10-12 to information having a format suitable for a fixed<br>
network, and converts information received from the fixed network to a<br>
format suitable for the radio network. In an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the RF-ATM converter 150 performs ATM adapation layer<br>
processing and multiplexing on the radio traffic received from the mobile<br>
terminals 10-12, and then converts the processed radio traffic to an ATM<br>
cell proper for the ATM network. The ATM adaptation layer processing<br>
performs convergence processing on the packetized radio information,<br>
reassembles the convergence-processed packet information into a plurality<br>
of cells, and inserts a header at the head of each cell to create a information<br>
filed. The ATM adaptation layer processing corresponds to AAL2<br>
processing. Unlike this, AAL5 processing attaches only the trailer at the end<br>
of each cell. The header is inserted in each information field created by the<br>
ATM adaptation layer processing, thereby creating the ATM cell. For<br>
converting the information received from the fixed network to the format<br>
suitable for the radio network, the RF-ATM converter 150 performs the<br>
reverse operation.<br>
FIGS. 2A and 2B show ATM cell processors 170 and 250 included in the<br>
BTS 100 and the BSC 200, respectively. More specifically, FIG. 2A shows<br>
the detailed structure of ATM cell processor 170 in the BTS 100 and its<br>
connection with the ATM interface 190, and FIG. 2B shows the detailed<br>
structure of the ATM cell processor 250 in the BSC 200 and its connection<br>
with the ATM interface 230. Though not illustrated separately, the ATM cell<br>
processor 350 in the MSC 300 preferably has the same structure and<br>
operation as that of the ATM cell processors 17- and 250.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2A and ATM cell processor 170, which performs ATM &amp;<br>
AAL2 routing and switching as well as an AAL2 multiplexing, includes an<br>
ATM switch 172 and an AAL2 cell processor 180. The ATM switch 172<br>
receives an ATM cell from the RF-ATM converter 150, determines a routing<br>
path for the received ATM cell according to switching information provided<br>
from the processor BTP 110, and then switches the ATM cell according to<br>
the determined routing path. The switching information is received from the<br>
upper layer processor BTP 110 during call setup, and is stored in a routing<br>
table of layer processor BTP 110 during call setup, and is stored in a routing<br>
table of the ATM switch 172 until the call is released. The ATM switch 172<br>
is provided with the switching information to be stored in its routing table<br>
from the processor 110 via a control bus, and switches the ATM cell to a<br>
routing path determined according to the switching information stored in the<br>
routing table. The switching information stored in the routing table of the<br>
ATM switch 172 includes an output virtual path identifier (VPI), an output<br>
virtual channel identifier (VCI) and an output channel number, and the<br>
routing path is determined by analyzing the VPI/VCI of an input ATM cell<br>
and using the switching information. The switching information stored in the<br>
routing table of the ATM switch 172 and the information for the CID<br>
(Channel Identifier) changing and AAL2 switching operation of the AAL2<br>
cell processor 180 are received from the processor 110 during call setup and<br>
stored in a look-up memory 183 of the AAL2 cell processor 180; this<br>
information is shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B, by way of example, and is used<br>
until the call is released. In the ATM cells (ATM cell stream) switched by<br>
the ATM switch 172, a plurality of AAL2 packets are multiplexed. Such an<br>
ATM cell stream has the structure shown in FIG. 3, and is applied to the<br>
ATM interface 190 having the structure shown in FIG. 12.<br>
FIG. 12 shows the detailed structure of the ATM interfaces 190 and 230<br>
included in the BTS 100 and the BSC 200, respectively. Though not<br>
illustrated separately, it should be noted that the ATM interface 270 in the<br>
BSC 200 and the ATM interfaces 330 and 370 in the MSC 300 preferably<br>
have the same structure.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, the ATM interface 190, which performs an IMA<br>
function and an ATM physical layer function, includes an IMA processor<br>
195 and a plurality of physical links 191-193. The IMA processor 195<br>
receives the ATM cell stream, and disperses the AAL2 packets (or ATM<br>
cells) multiplexed in the received ATM cell stream to the physical links.<br>
That is, the IMA processor 195 sequentially disperses the ATM cell stream<br>
to Nth physical links PHY_LINK_#1 to PHY_LINK_#N. For example, if<br>
the ATM cell stream is comprised of ATM cells CELL# 1 -CEL#N, the<br>
IMA processor 195 transmits CELL#1 over the first physical link 191,<br>
CELL#2 over the second physical link 192, and CELL#N over the Nth<br>
physical link 193. The physical links can be a T1 trunk (1.544Mbps), a E1<br>
trunk (2.048Mbps), a DS3 trunk (45Mbps) and a E3 trunk (34Mbps). In an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, eight E1 trunks are used for the<br>
physical links.<br>
The respective cells of the ATM cell stream, dispersedly transmitted by the<br>
IMA processor 195 over the first to Nth physical links 191-193, are applied<br>
to an IMA processor 235 in the ATM interface 230 of the BSC 200 over the<br>
physical links 231-233. The IMA processor 235 then restores the original<br>
ATM cell stream which is identical in format to the input ATM cell stream<br>
of the IMA processor 195 in the BTS 100. That is, the IMA processor 235<br>
restores the dispersed ATM cells to the ATM cell stream. The restored ATM<br>
cell stream is applied to the ATM cell processor 250 in the BSC 200.<br>
For more information about the ATM cell stream restoring method, please<br>
see "Inverse Multiplexing for ATM (IMA) Specification Version 1.0", AF-<br>
PHY-0086.000, ATM Forum Technical Committee, July 1997.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2B, the ATM cell processor 250 in the BSC 200 includes<br>
an ATM switch 252 and an AAL2 cell processor 260, and performs the same<br>
operation as the ATM cell processor 170 of FIG. 2A. The AAL2 cell<br>
processor 260 includes an ATM interface 261, an AAL2 synchronizer 262, a<br>
look-up memory 263, a CID changer 264, an AAL2 switch 266, an AAL2<br>
formatter 267 and an internal ATM (IATM) formatter 268. Performing<br>
AAL2 processing on the ATM cell stream, into which a plurality of ATM<br>
cells (AAL2 packets) are multiplexes by the AAL2 cell processor 260,<br>
increases the efficiency of the transmission bandwidth and prevents<br>
transmission delay. Since the ATM cell processor 250 of the BSC 200<br>
performs AAL2 processing on the ATM cell stream restored by the IMA<br>
processor 230 in the same manner as in the ATM cell processor 170 of the<br>
BTS 100, the detailed operational description of the ATM cell processor 250<br>
will be replaced with a description of the ATM cell processor 170 of the<br>
BTS 100, which will be made below with reference to FIG. 2A.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2A, on a first path, the AAL2 cell processor 180 directly<br>
transmits the ATM cell stream switched by the ATM switch 172 to the ATM<br>
interface 190. However, on a second path, the AAL2 cell processor 180 is<br>
provided with the ATM cell stream restored by the ATM cell interface 190<br>
after being dispersed by the ATM interface 230 of the BSC 200. The second<br>
path is from ATM interface 190 to ATM switch 172 through AAL2 cell<br>
processor. The AAL2 cell processor 180 includes an ATM interface 181, an<br>
AAL2 synchronizer 182, a look-up memory 183, a CID changer 184, an<br>
AAL2 switch 186, an AAL2 formatter 187 and an I ATM formatter 188. The<br>
ATM interface 181 performs ATM layer processing on an ATM cell<br>
received after physical layer processing, and outputs the processed AAL2<br>
CPS-PDU (Common Part Convergence Sublayer-Protocol Data Unit,<br>
hereinafter, referred to as an AAL2 cell) having the format shown in FIG.3<br>
to the AAL2 synchronizer 182.<br>
The physical layer processing function refers to the function of extracting a<br>
bit stream from the light beam or electric waveform transmitted from a<br>
transmission medium (e.g. optical fiber or coaxial cable), detecting valid<br>
samples therefrom, and outputting an ATM cell. The ATM layer processing<br>
function refers to the function of multiplexing/demultiplexing an ATM cell,<br>
performing cell routing (including virtual path (VP) routing and virtual<br>
channel (VC) routing), creating/deleting a cell header, identifying/extracting<br>
a prioritized/non-prioritized cell, controlling a generic flow, processing a<br>
signaling VC, and performing OAM (Operation, Administration and<br>
Maintenance) functions. Since the physical layer processing function and the<br>
ATM layer processing function are well known to those skilled in the art and<br>
are not directly related to operation of the present invention, a detailed<br>
description of the functions will be avoided herein. However, herein, the<br>
ATM interface 181 performs a cell routing operation of demultiplexing a<br>
received ATM cell according to ATM virtual circuit and virtual path<br>
connections depending on the ATM cell header and outputs the resulting<br>
AAL2 cell. During cell routing, the ATM interface 181 is controlled by the<br>
processor (BTP) 110. The processor (BTP) 110 is connected to the ATM<br>
interface 181 and the IATM formatter 188 via a control bus (not shown), to<br>
provide them with VPI/VCI information for cell routing, thereby performing<br>
VPI/VCI conversion.<br>
The AAL2 synchronizer 182 receives the AAL2 cell processed by the ATM<br>
interface 181. The AAL2 cell input to the AAL2 synchronizer 182 is an<br>
ATM cell of FIG. 2, from which an ATM cell header is deleted, i.e. the<br>
AAL2 CPS-PDU. A user information filed INFORMATION of the AAL2<br>
cell includes at least one AAL2 packet header (i.e., AAL2 CPS-packet<br>
header) and a payload CPS-INFO. The user information field can include at<br>
least one AAL2 packet, i.e., one or more AAL2 packet header and their<br>
associated payloads. For example, in the user information field of the AAL2<br>
cell, real-time voice data and other data having a short length can be<br>
multiplexed as a plurality of packets. The AAL2 synchronizer 182 performs<br>
of one or more AAL2 packets multiplexed in each AAL2 cell of the ATM<br>
virtual circuits. By this AAL2 synchronizing function, the following CID<br>
changing operation and AAL2 switching operation can be performed on a<br>
packet unit basis for every ATM virtual circuit. The AAL2 synchronizing<br>
function is performed by using an offset field OSF included in the AAL2<br>
CPS-PDU header and a length indicator LI included in the AAL2 packet<br>
header. The starting point of the first AAL2 packet is detected by using the<br>
OSF, and starting point of each succeeding AAL2 packets can be detected<br>
by using the LI, since it is possible to calculate the length of the AAL2<br>
packet depending on the LI included in the previous AAL2 packet header.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the AAL2 CPS-PDU format defined by ITU-T<br>
Recommendation 1.363.2(D), which is input to the AAL2 synchronizer 182<br>
of FIG. 2A.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the AAL2 CPS-PDU (i.e., AAL2 cell) is comprised of a<br>
1-byte (8-bit) CPS-PDU header, user information, and a pad. The CPS-PDU<br>
header (hereinafter, referred to as an AAL2 cell header) is comprised of a 6-<br>
bit OSF, a 1-bit SN (Sequence Number) filed, and a 1-bit P (Parity) filed.<br>
The OSF (Offset Field), information about the starting point of the AAL2<br>
CPS-packet payload CPS-INFO, indicates an interval between the OSF and<br>
the CPS-packet payload. The SN indicates a sequence number of the CPS-<br>
PDU, and is determined on a modula-2 basis. The P indicates a parity, and<br>
an odd parity is preferably used.<br>
The user information is comprised of a 24-bit (3-byte) AAL2 CPS-packet<br>
header (hereinafter, referred to as an AAL2 packet header) and a 45/64-byte<br>
payload CPS-INFO. The AAL2 packet header is comprised of a 8-bit CID, a<br>
6-bit LI, a 5-bit UUI (User-to-User Information), and 5-bit HEC (Header<br>
Error Control). Here, the CID (Channel Identification) field a unique<br>
number identifying an AAL2 packet channel. The CID is assigned by a CID<br>
assigning part which will be described later, and is used until the AAL2<br>
channel is released. The LI (Length Indicator) indicates the length of the<br>
CPS-packet payload, and can indicate the length of 45 or 64 bytes in<br>
maximum since the CPS-packet payload can include information of 45 or 64<br>
bytes in maximum. The UUI is used for communication between CPS users.<br>
The HEC is used for detecting errors generated in the CPS-packet header.<br>
The CPS-packet payload CPS-INFO is a field for carrying real-time<br>
information which has a short length, such as voice data, and can carry a<br>
plurality of packets by multiplexing. Here, CPS-INFO can carry packets<br>
having a length of 45 or 64 bytes in maximum. Although FIG. 2 shows that<br>
the user information field includes one AAL2 packet for simplicity, the user<br>
information field can include a plurality of AAL2 packets.<br>
The AAL2 CPS-PDU format shown in FIG. 3 is an AAL2 cell format which<br>
is applied to the AAL2 synchronizer 182 after a received ATM cell<br>
undergoes physical layer processing and ATM layer processing by the ATM<br>
interface 181. The AAL2 cell is applied to the CID changer 184 after<br>
synchronization processing by the AAL2 synchronizer 182. The CID<br>
changer 184 is required for the following reason. A CID value, which is a<br>
unique number for each AAL2 channel, is assigned by the CID assigning<br>
part according to ATM virtual circuits (VCs). The CID is used to identify<br>
the channels being multiplexed within a single VC. However, a collision can<br>
happen between such assigned CIDs after switching operation by the AAL2<br>
switch 126, because the AAL2 switch is working with mapping more than<br>
one virtual circuit VC to another. Therefore, the CID changing function is<br>
required in order to prevent the collision. More specifically, when the AAL2<br>
packets transmitted through different ATM virtual circuits VCs are AAL2-<br>
switched and then transmitted to the same single ATM virtual circuit, their<br>
CID values might be identical to each other. Since there is no way to identify<br>
the AAL2 packet when there are a plurality of identical CID values on a<br>
single ATM virtual circuit VC, it is necessary to change the CID values of<br>
the AAL2 packets, which are to be output to the same ATM virtual circuit<br>
VC at the same time, so as to be unique to each other. Here, the term "ATM<br>
virtual circuit" is used, but the principles can apply to any ATM<br>
connections, including virtual paths VPs as well as virtual channels VCs,<br>
over which the ATM cell is transferred. In the following description, the<br>
ATM connection will be limited to only the virtual channel VC, for<br>
0convenience of explanation.<br>
The look-up memory 183 stores cell routing (VCI) information, CID routing<br>
information, and routing tag (PT) information for ATM switching, as shown<br>
in FIGS. 5A and 5B. The above routing-related information is provided by<br>
the processor 110 after performing a signaling procedure with the other party<br>
during call setup.<br>
The CID hanger 184 judges from the CID values stored in the look-up<br>
memory 183 whether it is necessary to change the CID values for the AAL2<br>
packets, and when necessary, changes the CID values of the AAL2 packet.<br>
That is, the CID changer 184 changes the CID values of the AAL2 packets<br>
such that the CID values of the AAL2 packets are not identical to each other,<br>
when the AAL2 packets to be output to the same VC at the same time are<br>
assigned the identical CID during establishment of the AAL2 packet. For<br>
example, when the AAL2 packets of first and second VCs are input with the<br>
same CID and they are to be output on a certain single VC, the CID for the<br>
AAL2 packet of the first VC can be changed to a new CID which is not used<br>
in the AAL2 packet of the other VC. Instead of changing the CID for the<br>
AAL2 packet of the first VC, it is also possible to have a method of<br>
changing the CID for the AAL2 packet of the second VC. The CID changed<br>
at this point is used until the AAL2 packet is released.<br>
The processor 110 controls the overall operation of the BTS 100. In one<br>
embodiment, the processor 110 controls operation of the ATM switch 172,<br>
the AAL2 cell processor 180 and the ATM interface 190. More specifically,<br>
the processor 110 performs the function of assigning the VPI/VCI value to<br>
be used for the ATM virtual circuit, i.e., performs cell routing control. In<br>
order to perform the VPC/VCI value assigning function, the processor 110 is<br>
provided with cell routing (VPI/VCI) information through signaling with the<br>
other party during call setup, and controls the ATM interface 181 and the<br>
IATM formatter 188 according to the cell routing information. In addition,<br>
the processor 110 also performs an ATM cell copy function and an AAL2<br>
packet copy function. In order to perform the ATM cell copy function, the<br>
processor 110 provides the IATM formatter 188 with routing tag<br>
information and ATM cell header information required for cell copying, and<br>
the ATM switch 172 performs a switching operation based on this<br>
information. The ATM cell copy function can also be performed by having<br>
the processor 110 directly control the ATM switch 172. The AAL2 packet<br>
copy function is performed by having the processor 110 control the AAL2<br>
switch 186. Further, the processor 110 performs a function of assigning the<br>
CID identifying each AAL2 packet, and FIG. 4 shows the structure of the<br>
processor 110 for performing the CID assignment function.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the processor 110 includes a CID assignment controller<br>
412 and a CID buffer 414, and assigns the CID for each AAL2 packet<br>
through AAL2 signaling with the other party. The CID buffer 414 stores a<br>
plurality of idle CIDs. Upon receipt of an AAL2 channel (packet)<br>
establishment request, the CID assignment controller 412 generates a read<br>
signal READ and reads a CID stored in the front end of the CID buffer 414<br>
to assign the read CID as the CIF for the AAL2 channel (packet). While<br>
assigning the CIDs to the AAL2 packets, the CID assignment controller 412<br>
generates a write signal WRITE to write the CID for the released AAL2<br>
channel in the rear end of the CID buffer 414. That is, the CID buffer 414<br>
stores the idle CIDs for assignment, and upon receipt of an AAL2 channel<br>
establishment request, the CID assignment controller 412 reads a CID stored<br>
in the CID buffer 414 on a FIFO (First-in-First-Out) basis to assign the read<br>
CID, and then writes the released CID in the CID buffer 414 on the FIFO<br>
basis.<br>
Turning back to FIG. 2A, the AAL2 switch 186 performs a switching<br>
function on an AAL2 packet unit basis, under the control of the processor<br>
110.<br>
Further, the AAL2 switch 186 can perform a copy function on an AAL2<br>
packet unit basis. Here, the copy function refers to simultaneously outputting<br>
a specific AAL2 packet to several ATM VCs. For this copy function, it is<br>
necessary to use a CID to separately identify the packet to be copied. Since<br>
information about the CID to be used for the packet to be copied can also be<br>
stored in the look-up memory 183, the AAL2 switch 186 determines a CID<br>
to be used for the packet to be copied by using the information stored in the<br>
look-up memory 183 and performs the copy function for the AAL2 packet<br>
indicated by the determined CID.<br>
The AAL2 formatter 187 assembles the AAL2 packets to be multiplexed to<br>
the same ATM VC out of the AAL2 packets switched by the AAL2 switch<br>
186, to generate an AAL2 CPS-PDU (i.e., AAL2 cell). That is, the AAL2<br>
formatter 187 multiplexes the AAL2 packets, generates an AAL2 cell having<br>
the same format as the AAL2 cell received from the AAL2 synchronizer<br>
182, and outputs the generated AAL2 cell to the IATM formatter 188.<br>
The IATM formatter 188, which is connected to the processor 110 via the<br>
control bus, converts the AAL2 cell, to which a plurality of AAL2 packets<br>
are multiplexed, into an internal ATM cell used in the system. Here, the<br>
operation of generating an internal ATM cell refers to the operation of<br>
adding, at the head of the internal ATM cell, a routing tag and an ATM cell<br>
header for enabling ATM switching. Information about the routing tag and<br>
the ATM cell header is provided from the processor 110.<br>
The ATM switch 172 switches the internal ATM cell generated by the<br>
IATM formatter 188. A general ATM switch can be used for the ATM<br>
switch 172.<br>
The AAL2 cell processor 180 inside the ATM cell processor 170 has the<br>
structure shown in FIG. 2A and performs the AAL2 processing function as<br>
described above. A description will be now made regarding an AAL2<br>
processing operation performed by the device according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. FIGS. 5A to 11 B are diagrams for explaining the<br>
AAL2 processing operation and its associated ATM switching operation<br>
according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIGS. 5A and 5B show the structure of the routing tables for performing an<br>
operation according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Such routing tables can be implemented in the look-up memory 183 of FIG.<br>
2A.<br>
More specifically, FIG. 5A shows a routing table according to the time for<br>
processing a current mini-cell (i.e. AAL2 packet) and FIG. 5B shows a<br>
routing table according to the time for processing the next mini-cell. In the<br>
routing tables, VCI1 and VCIO, which indicate input and output virtual<br>
channel identifiers, respectively, are provided from the processor 110 to the<br>
AAL2 switch 186. CID1 and CIDO which indicate AAL2 input and output<br>
packet numbers, respectively, are provided from the processor 110 to the<br>
CID changer 184. PT1 and PTO, which indicate ATM cell input and output<br>
ports, respectively, of the ATM switch 172, are provided to the IATM<br>
formatter 188 under the control of the processor 110.<br>
Now, say that an ATM cell has been input to the ATM cell processor 180,<br>
then the ATM interface 181 performs ATM layer processing on the input<br>
ATM cell and outputs the resulting processed ATM cell. As shown in FIG.<br>
6, this ATM cell includes an AAL2 CPS-PDU in which a plurality of AAL2<br>
packets are multiplexed. In FIG. 6, "H" denotes the ATM cell header shown<br>
in FIG. 3, hatched blocks denote the CPS-PDU headers, latticed blocks<br>
denote the AAL2 packet headers, and circled numerals 1 to 8 denote CIDs of<br>
the AAL2 packets. For convenience of explanation, FIG. 6 shows that the<br>
CIDs of the AAL2 packets have already been assigned. However, it should<br>
be noted that the CID is assigned on a packet unit basis when an AAL2<br>
channel establishment request occurs, and is used until the channel is<br>
released.<br>
The AAL2 synchronizer 182 in the AAL2 cell processor 180 receives the<br>
AAL2 cell (AAL2 CPS-PDU) in the format of FIG. 6 from the ATM<br>
interface 181. At this point, the AAL2 packets included in the AAL2 cells of<br>
different ATM VCs have not been synchronized with each other. Therefore,<br>
the AAL2 synchronizer 182 identifies the AAL2 packet and synchronizes<br>
the AAL2 packets of the different ATM VCs with each other. Next, the CID<br>
changer 184 receives the cells, synchronized according to the different ATM<br>
VCs, and changes the CID on a packet unit basis, when necessary. When<br>
this happens, the CID changer 184 is provided with a new CID value<br>
changed from the original CID value during channel establishment from the<br>
processor 110 having the CID assignment function, and this CID value is<br>
stored in the look-up memory 183 and maintained until the channel is<br>
released.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, at the current time t1, the CID of VCI=41 AAL2 packet<br>
and the CID of the VCI=43 AAL2 packet are both "2", and at the next time<br>
t2, the CID of the VCI=42 AAL2 packet and the CID of the VCI=44 AAL2<br>
packet are both "9". This, of itself, is not a problem. However, both the "2"<br>
VCI=41 AAL2 packet and the "2" VCI=43 AAL2 packet are mapped to the<br>
same outgoing VC, VCIo, 83, as shown in FIG. 5A. In the same manner,<br>
both the "9" VCI=42 AAL2 packet and the "9" VCI=44 packet are mapped<br>
to the same outgoing VC, VCIo 84, as shown in FIG. 5B. Therefore, the CID<br>
changer 184 needs to change the CID for this and other cases where the<br>
AAL2 packets of different ATM VCs having the identical CID are<br>
multiplexed to the identical VCI, so as to prevent CID collision. For<br>
example, the CID changer 184 performs CID changing on the VCI=41<br>
AAL2 packet at the current time tl and the VCI=42 AAL2 packet at the next<br>
time t2. By this CID changing operation, the CID of the VCI=41 AAL2<br>
packet is changed from "2" to "3" at the current time tl, and the CID of the<br>
VCI=42 AAL2 packet is changed from "9" to "1" at the next time t2.<br>
Therefore, although the VCI=41 AAL2 packet and the VCI=43 AAL2<br>
packet are multiplexed in the same VC at the current time tl or the VCI=42<br>
AAL2 packet and the VCI=44 AAL2 packet are multiplexed in the same VC<br>
at the next time t2 by the following AAL2 switching operation, the CIDs of<br>
the multiplexed AAL2 packets do not overlap. These newly changed CID<br>
values are provided from the CID assignment controller 412 of the processor<br>
110.<br>
The AAL2 switch 186 performs the switching operation shown in FIGS. 8A<br>
and 8B on the AAL2 packets on which the CID changing function has been<br>
performed on a packet unit basis. At this point, the AAL2 switch 186<br>
performs the switching operation using the VCI1 and VCIo values in the<br>
routing tables shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B, provided from the processor 110.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8A, at the current mini-cell (AAL2 packet) time t1, the<br>
AAL2 switch 186 performs switching such that a VCI,=41 packet "3" is<br>
output to VCIo=83, a VCI1=42 packet "7" is output to VCIo=84, a VCI1=43<br>
packet "2" is output to VCIo=83, and a VCI1=44 packet "5" is output to<br>
VCIo=81.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8B, at the next mini-cell (AAL2 packet) time t2, the AAL2<br>
switch 186 performs switching such that a VCI1==41 packet "4" is output to<br>
VCIo=81, a VCI1=42 packet "1" is output to VCIo=84, a VCI1=43 packet "6"<br>
is output to VCIo=82, and a VCI1=44 packet "9" is output to VCIo=84.<br>
Since the packet length is not fixed but variable as shown in FIG. 3, the<br>
AAL2 switch 186 is difficult to perform in hardware like the ATM switch<br>
172. Instead, it is preferable for the AAL2 switch 186 to be implemented in<br>
software as a packet switch.<br>
The AAL2 formatter 187 multiplexes the AAL2 packets, which were<br>
switched to the same ATM VC by the AAL2 switch 186, to generate a single<br>
AAL2 cell (AAL2 CPS-PDU) in the format of FIG. 3. The generated AAL2<br>
cell is shown in FIG. 9 by way of example. Here, the packet "8" is a<br>
previously switched AAL2 packet.<br>
The IATM formatter 188 converts the AAL2 cell output from the AAL2<br>
formatter 187 to an IATM cell in the format of FIG. 10, which is the proper<br>
format to be switched by the ATM switch 172. AT this point, the routing tag<br>
and ATM cell header are added at the head of each cell.<br>
The ATM switch 172 receives the IATM cell generated by the IATM<br>
formatter 188 and performs switching as shown in FIGS. 11A and 11B. At<br>
this point, the ATM switch 172 performs the switching operation using the<br>
routing tag information (PTo value) on the routing table shown in FIGS. 5A<br>
and 5B, provided form the processor 110.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11 A, at the current IATM cell time, the ATM switch 172<br>
performs switching such that a cell input at an input port #0 is output to an<br>
output port #1, a cell input at an input port #1 is output to an output port #2,<br>
a cell input at a port #2 is output to an output port #3, and a cell input at an<br>
input port #3 is output to an output port #0.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11B, at the next IATM cell time, the ATM switch 172<br>
performs switching such that a cell input at an input port #0 is output to an<br>
output port #0, a cell input at an input port #1 is output to an output port #3,<br>
a cell input at an input port #2 is output to an output port #1, and a cell input<br>
at an input port #3 is output to an output port #2.<br>
One IATM cell time corresponds to a plurality of AAL2 packet (mini-cell,<br>
CPS-packet) times. Since the AAL2 packet size is variable, the number of<br>
the AAL2 packet times corresponding to one IATM cell time can be varied.<br>
That is, although the IATM cell time is fixed, the mini-cell time is variable<br>
depending on the AAL2 packet size.<br>
Turning back to FIG. 1, the processors BTP 110, BMP (BSC Main<br>
Processor) 210 and MMP (MSC Main Processor) 310 in the BTS 100, BSC<br>
200 and MSC 300, respectively, perform inter-processor communication<br>
(IPC) by exchanging ATM cells with each other. The BSC 200 and the MSC<br>
300 include application programs 290 and 390 shown in FIG. 1 for<br>
performing various operations. Further, the ATM interface 370 in the MSC<br>
300 can also be connected to either another MSC or to other networks<br>
through an ATM switch or a STM switch. That is, the MSC 300 shown in<br>
FIG. 1 can be connected to another MSC and other networks via an ATM<br>
NNI (Network Node Interface).<br>
FIG. 13 shows a block diagram explaining various exemplary applications of<br>
the ATM cell processing system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, the novel ATM cell processing system includes an<br>
ATM switch 172, an AAL2 cell processor 180 and an ATM (IMA) interface<br>
190, as shown in FIG. 1. Various service devices can be connected to the<br>
ATM switch 172 via an interface 400. That is, a mobile terminal (MT) 10<br>
can be connected to the interface 400 via the RF processor 130 of FIG. 1. In<br>
this case, the interface 400 converts radio information received from the<br>
mobile terminal 10 to a format proper for the fixed network after RF<br>
processing in the RF processor 130, and converts information received from<br>
the fixed network to a format proper for the radio network. This operation<br>
corresponds to an operation of the RF-ATM converter 150 of FIG. 1.<br>
In addition, an ATM PABX (Private Automatic Branch Exchange) 410 and<br>
an ATM terminal 420 can also be connected to the interface 400. Further, a<br>
non-ATM terminal 430 can also be connected to the interface 400 via an<br>
ATM adapter 432. Here, since the information received from the ATM<br>
PABX 410, the ATM terminal 420 and the non-ATM terminal 430 have the<br>
format suitable for the fixed network i.e., the ATM cell format, the interface<br>
400 can directly provide the input ATM cell to the ATM switch 172, without<br>
separate processing.<br>
As described above, the novel mobile communication system uses not only<br>
the fundamental ATM technique but also the AAL2 and IMA techniques. By<br>
using the ATM technique, it is possible to increase transmission efficiency<br>
and facilitate multimedia traffic processing by statistical multiplexing. In<br>
addition, it is possible to increase transmission efficiency within virtual<br>
circuits by using the AAL2 technique, and increase the utilization efficiency<br>
of the physical links by using the IMA technique.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled<br>
in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by<br>
