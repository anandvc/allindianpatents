				<td>This invention relates to a process for the reclamation of crude oii contaminated soil. This invention particularly relates to an eco-friendly process for the reclamation of crude oii contaminated soil by using a bio-formulation.<br>
The process of the present invention which incorporates a bio-formulation can be used for reclamation of crude oii contaminated soil. The process of the present invention for the reclamation of crude oii contaminated soil will find wide usage particularly in and around oii field areas and generally in areas contaminated due to crude oii spillage.<br>
The North Eastern region of India, in particular, has vast petroleum reserves. In oii fields, during drilling, gathering, transporting or in other operations, some quantity of crude oii is spilled out from drilling and operating sites. The spilled crude oii is an ecologica! threat, particularly to the flora and fauna. Beneficia! microbes such as nitrogen fixers, phosphate solublisers, sulphur oxidisers, cellulase degraders, are also affected because of crude oi! spillage. Moreover, some quantity of Chemicals present in the spilled crude oi! leaches out or percoiates to the rhizosphere of the soil. The soil gets contaminated so badly that no vegetation takes place in such affected area. It takes years to return to he normal condition.<br>
The methods for treating soil contaminated by petroleum and its by-products are previously known in the art. The search of patent data bases provided the following prior art references:<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. EP-1008396. The invention relates to environmental control and can be used for cleaning soils polluted with recent or aged crude oii or petroleum product spills. The invention essentially relates to a method for cleaning soils polluted with petroleum products, and comprising mixing of the soil with thermally-split graphite, adding of water thereto and separating the sorbent floated to the surface together with the adsorbed<br>
petroleum products. The soil and sorbent can be mixed in situ using agricultura! or road-building machines, as well as in mixing vessels. To accelerate the process, treatment of the aged petroleum products spills can include adding of an extractive agent such as kerosene, the application of cavitation action, or a combination thereof. The thermally-split graphite can be regenerated repeatedly by sublimating the sorbent-recovered petroleum products, by extracting or squeezing processes.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. US-6036849, a method of removing hydrocarbons from soils contaminated with various hydrocarbons such as gasoline, diesel fuel, solvents, motor oii and crude oii. The process first screens the soil to remove oversized rocks and debris and to reduce the contaminated soil to uniformly sized particles. The soil particles are moved along a conveyor and first sprayed with an oxidizer diluted with ionized water and then sprayed with only ionized water. The washed particles are then vigorously mixed with their entrained oxidizer and ionized water in an auger mixer for several minutes to oxidize almost all of the remaining hydrocarbons. The washed and hydrocarbon-free soil is then moved by conveyor to a stockpile for storage, testing and drying.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. US-6444204, wherein the invention relates to the field of bio-technologies and environmental protection, and refers the cleaning of water, soil and other media polluted with petroleum products. The cleaning method of the present invention is carried out with a biological preparation that comprises a pool of yeast of the Candida maltosa genus from the strains deposited under No. VKPM Y-2256 and No. VKPM Y-2257. These strains rnay be present in the pool in any ratio but preferably in the ratio of 1:1. The biological preparation may be used for removing pollution caused by a wide range of hydrocarbons contained in crude oii and petroleum products, for example fuel oii, oils, etc. The biological preparation affords recovery of oii<br>
pollution at temperatures up to +41 C. and pH 3.0-9.0, and may be used in saline ecosystems. The process for producing the biological preparation eofnprises simultaneously cultivating the above-mentioned yeast strains on a liquid medium followed by separation and removal of the biomass thus grown. To obtain a powdered preparation, the biomass is subjected to drying. When cleaning the above-cited media from oii pollution, an aqueous suspension of the biological preparation with a nitrogen-phosphate additive is used<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. WO 9531408, wherein the proposed biological preparation for removing crude oii and petroleum-product contaminants from water and soil consists of a mixture of the following hydrocarbon-oxidising strains of micro-organism: rhodococcus sp. BKM-AC-1500 D, rhodococcus maris BKM-AC-1501 D, rhodococcus erythropolis BKM-AC-1502 D, pseudomonas stutzeri BKM-B-1972 D, Candida sp. BKM-Y-2778 D. The relative proportions of these strains are (0-1):(0-1):(0-1):(0-1):(0-1). The prepar ation in question is a naturally occurring association of microorganisms or mixture of individual micro-organism strains. The proposed method of removing crude oii and petroleum-product contaminants from water and soil involves treating the water or soil with the biological preparation containing the strains rh. sp. BKM-AC-1500 D, rh. maris BKM-AC-1501 D, rh. erythropolis BKM-AC-1502 D, ps. stutzeri BKM-B-1972 D, and C. sp. BKM-Y-2778 D. The preparation used contains no fewer than 2 x 10 live microbial cells for every square metre of contaminated area. Treatment of the water and/or soil is carried out by sprinkling a suspension of the preparation in a solution of mineral salts. For the treatment of soil, trenches are cut in the soil. Water and/or soil with a salinity of up to 10 % is treated in this way. The preparation can be used for treating reservoirs and saline soil and brackish water ecosystems.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. US-6153017, a method for removal of hydrocarbon materials from solid particulate soil contaminated with the<br>
hydrocarbon materials. The method comprises forming an aqueous slurry of a mixture of a hydrophobic adsorbent selected from foamed synthetic materials or natural materials which entrap gas, with the soil in the presence of water. The adsorbent has a density less than water. The slurry is mixed for a period of time, and a gravity separation of the adsorbent from the aqueous admixture thus obtained is effected.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. US-6110372, bioremediation of petroleum pollutants with alkane-utilizing bacteria, wherein alkane-utilizing bacteria are used to degrade pollutants comprising petroleum compounds. In-situ or ex-situ techniques may be used to reduce or eliminate petroleum pollutants from liquid, gas and solid sources. In a preferred embodiment, petroleum concentrations in various environments are reduced by contacting the petroleum pollutants with butane-utilizing bacteria in the presence of oxygen to degrade the petroleum pollutants by cometabolism or direct metabolism. Suitable alkane-utilizing bacteria include Pseudomonas, Variovorax, Nocardia, Chryseobacterium, Comamonas, Acidovorax, Rhodococcus, Aureobacterium, Micrococcus, Aeromonas, Stenotrophomonas, Sphingobacterium, Shewanella, Phyllobacterium, Clavibacter, Alcaligenes, Gordona, Corynebacterium and Cytophaga.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. US-5415777, process for the decontamination of soils contaminated by petroleum products, wherein a method of decontaminating soil contaminated by petroleum products on the site of the contamination is described. Such decontamination is accomplished by chemical breakdown, enzymatic action and biologica! microbial degradation. Significant byproducts of this degradation of the hydrocarbon material are: water, sodium salts, ammonium salts, carbon dioxide, free amino acids and heat. The invention relates to a process for decontaminating soils contaminated by petroleum products. Specifically, the invention relates to a method of treating contaminated soils by applying carbonate salts, ammonium hydroxide, and dilute organic acids<br>
to the soil at the site of the contamination. This can be followed by the addition of proteinase enzymes and bacterial inoculates.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. US-5128262, microbial decontamination of soils contaminated with hydrocarbons, in particular mineral oils by microbial oxidation. The microbial decontamination of soils contaminated with hydrocarbons, in particular with mineral oils, by microbial oxidation is improved by a process in which in addition to supplying the oxygen necessary for degradation, by aeration, soluble nutrients, water and soluble or dispersed biosurfactants as such or mixed with chemical surfactants are metered into the contaminated soils directly or into the removed contaminated soil layers, in one or more batches at time intervals, in an amount such that the formation of toxic intermediates which slow down or block microbial degradation in prevented, the accessibility of mineral oils and their products for the microorganisms is simultaneously increased and, as a result, accelerated, virtually complete mineralization by respiration to CO.sub.2 and H.sub.2 O is effected.<br>
The methods for treating soil contaminated by petroleum and its by-products which are previously known in the art, have all hâd disadvantages relating to the fact that, in most cases, the contaminated soil must be excavated and transported to a decontamination site with a resulting increase in expense and time. Furthermore, most of the methods involve the addition of strong Chemicals to the contaminated soil which themselves have the potenţial of being environmentally hazardous. Additionally, many of the known methods are not able to completely degrade the contaminating substances from soil, but instead, succeed only in separating the most hazardous of the contaminants from the soil in a form in which they can be more easily disposed of.<br>
There is a need to provide a process for reclamation of such contaminated soil, particularly by biological means, which is an ideal and eco-friendly method to revive soil condition rapidly and to restore the environment.<br>
