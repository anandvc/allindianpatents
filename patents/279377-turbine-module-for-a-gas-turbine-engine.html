				<td>Turbine module for a gas turbine engine<br>
The present invention relates to the field of gas turbine engines and is aimed in particular at a turbine module, particularly the high pressure module.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
An axial-flow gas turbine engine comprises a rotary assembly forming a compressor, feeding a fixed combustion chamber which itself delivers hot gases to a rotary assembly forming a turbine. A turbine rotor fixedly attached to a compressor rotor forms a spool or a body and the engine may comprise one or more spools, usually two or three rotating at different speeds. Thus a twin spool engine comprises a low pressure LP spool and a high pressure HP spool. In order to make it easier to mount the engine and reduce the mounting and removal times, its architecture is often divided into modules. For example, for the high pressure spool of a twin spool engine, all the parts forming the compressor are placed in an HP compressor module and all the parts forming the turbine rotor are placed in an HP turbine module.<br>
The latter module consists only of the rotating parts, for example a turbine disk onto which a labyrinth seal assembly and a shell with an upstream assembly flange and a seal assembly associated with a downstream bearing are bolted.<br>
Description of the prior art<br>
Usually, the HP compressor and HP turbine modules are assembled by means of specific flanges; these flanges transmit the engine torque from the turbine to the compressor. The connection via these flanges must therefore be sufficiently strong to fulfill this function.<br>
In addition, the modules must be supplied for assembly perfectly balanced in rotation. In the case of a module of the HP turbine type, an upstream balancing plane and a downstream balancing plane are provided. The<br>
balancing plane is the plane in which the balancing weights are placed at a determined distance from the axis and at a determined angle. In the solution with an assembly flange, the flange that is at the frontier of the module forms an appropriate balancing plane. The balancing weights are therefore placed in the zone of the frontier flange. This is particularly the case at the frontier between the HP compressor module and the HP turbine module. Each module is therefore presented for assembly balanced in this manner.<br>
The use of specific assembly flanges is convenient but carries a weight penalty. An effort has therefore been made to develop a module whose assembly to the compressor can be achieved without a specific assembly flange. In particular, the possibility of achieving assembly to the compressor directly onto the turbine disk of the module has been examined.<br>
The problem then arises of the turbine module being preassembled and delivered perfectly balanced. Specifically, it is important for the assembly engineers responsible for assembling the modules not to have to work on the module itself, otherwise the value of modularity would be diminished.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The Applicant has therefore set itself the objective of developing a turbine module that meets these requirements.<br>
According to the invention, the turbine module for a gas turbine engine comprising at least one turbine disk and a disk-shaped component mounted upstream on the turbine disk relative to the gas flow, said module comprising a means of assembly between the compressor of said engine and the turbine disk, is characterized in that the component, before the module is assembled to the compressor, is preassembled to the turbine disk by bolting to an attachment flange fixedly attached to the turbine disk.<br>
Thus, via the solution of the invention which consists in directly attaching the compressor module to the turbine disk and in connecting the component,<br>
placed between the compressor and the turbine disk, to the turbine disk separately, it is possible to reduce the weight without losing assembly security and a module preassembly that can where necessary be balanced.<br>
Preferably, the means of assembling the compressor to the turbine disk comprises said attachment flange.<br>
Particularly, when the component is disk-shaped with a wheel center between its hub and its periphery, and is mounted onto said flange by bolts through first drillings in the wheel center, second drillings are made in the wheel center for the assembly by bolts of the turbine module to the compressor.<br>
According to another feature, the component is attached to said flange by bolts numbering between 2 and 8 distributed over the circumference.<br>
Advantageously, the bolts are held by nuts swaged onto the flange, on the downstream side, together with nuts for assembling the module to the compressor. The bolts for attaching the component more particularly have a specifically shaped head which differs from the heads of the bolts for attaching the compressor.<br>
According to another feature, the component comprises an upstream balancing device placed on said component independently of the means of assembly to the compressor.<br>
The invention applies in particular to a module whose component is a disk supporting labyrinth seal elements.<br>
The invention also covers the compressor associated with the module to form a gas turbine engine, comprising a downstream flange for attaching to the module. On this flange, housings or passageways are made for the heads of the attaching bolts already in place on the module.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>

-	figure 6 is a section along VI-VI of figure 2 or 3 and shows the detail of<br>
the assembly of the nuts on the attachment flange fixedly attached to<br>

-	figure 7 shows a variant of the turbine module of figure 1, the module<br>
being fitted with an upstream balancing device.<br>
Description of the preferred embodiments<br>
Figure 1 shows a half-module of an HP turbine in axial section. This module comprises a turbine disk 3, with a hub with an axial section with increasing thickness toward the shaft, and on the periphery of which the turbine blades 4 are mounted. The latter are housed in axial slots made on the rim of the disk. A component 5 is mounted on the disk 3 upstream, that is to say on the left in the figure. Upstream and downstream are defined relative to the flow of gases in the engine. The component here is a disk with symmetry of revolution relative to the axis of the machine. This disk comprises a hub with increasing thickness toward the shaft of the engine, a part forming a wheel center 51 going toward the periphery. The disk, at its periphery, supports radial annular<br>
blades 53 forming the rotating part of labyrinth seals. Their counterpart is not shown.<br>
The disk 5 is attached to the disk 3 by bolting to an attachment flange 31 fixedly attached to the disk upstream of the latter. The bolts 7 comprise a head 71, a stem 72 passing through an orifice made in the wheel center 51 and a drilling machined in the flange 31, and interacting with a nut 73.<br>
On the downstream side of the module, a disk 6 can be seen with a trunnion 61 forming a support for a downstream bearing 62. The disk is bolted to a downstream attachment flange 33. The attaching bolts 64 are distributed over the whole periphery of the disk. It also comprises sealing elements 63 for a labyrinth seal. The disk 6 forms a downstream balancing plane. Balancing weights are mounted with the attaching bolts.<br>
The module as shown in figure 1 is preassembled ready for mounting and assembled to a compressor. The function of the bolts 7 is to hold the component 5 fixedly attached to the turbine disk during the operations. The bolts 7 are preferably four in number and are equidistant on the circumference. Their number may lie between 2 and 8. Account should be taken in fact of the bolts for attaching the compressor to the disk. The bolts 7 do not come to disrupt the blade spacing between the disk 3 and the disk 5.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show the bolting detail after the turbine module has been attached to an attachment flange 9 of the compressor. The latter is not shown. The attachment flange 9 is annular and forms the downstream frontier of the compressor. Figure 2 shows a partial axial section made along a bolt 7 for attaching the component 5 to the disk 3. Figure 3 shows a partial axial section made along a bolt 8 for attaching the flange 9 to the disk 3.<br>
The heads 71 of the bolts 7 are engaged in wide lips of the flange 9 so that they come to engage directly with the disk of the component 5. These bolts therefore have no effect on the connection of the flange 9.<br>
The bolts 8 of figure 3 each participate in attaching the flange 9 to the disk 3. The heads 81 are pressing against the upstream surface of the flange 9 that is held tight against the disk 5 by the nut 83 pressing against the downstream face of the flange 31. The stem 82 of the bolt 8 passes through the disk of the component 5 and the two flanges 9 and 31.<br>
Figure 4 shows the annular flange 9, seen from the upstream side. It comprises scallop-shaped recesses to allow it to circumvent the heads 71 of the bolts 7 and come to press against the disk of the component 5. It also comprises drillings for the shanks 82 of the bolts 8 to pass through, whose head 81 presses on the edge of the drillings.<br>
Figure 5 shows a variant of an attachment flange 9' of the compressor. For the heads 71 of the bolts for attaching the disk 5 to pass through, instead of scallops, the passageway has been limited to a circular orifice with a diameter slightly greater than that of the heads 71.<br>
The component 5 has the same drillings in the wheel center 51 capable of allowing either the bolts 7 or the bolts 8 to pass through.<br>
To prevent confusion between the bolts 7 and 8, provision can be made for the heads 71 and 81 of the bolts to have different shapes.<br>
For example, splined heads can be provided for some and broad heads (a broad head is a head broader than the tightening operation requires; it corresponds to that of a broader barrel) for the others or vice versa.<br>
The use of this type of head, while also preventing confusion, also has the advantage of preventing the bolts 8 from seizing at the time of the modular dismantling of the compressor and the turbine. If the bolts 8 remain immovable, the specific heads 81 of the bolts 8 are capable of supporting a violent excess torque to shear the barrel 82 from the head 81. In any case, modular dismantling is achieved.<br>
Figure 6 shows the flange 31 seen from the downstream side. The nuts 73 and 83 are preferably mounted and swaged in place before the parts are assembled. It should be noted that they have a tab 731 respectively 831 of rectangular shape in order to provide mutual locking in rotation. This makes it easier to tighten the bolts 7 and 8 during assembly. The nuts 73 and 83 swaged onto the flange 31 are identical.<br>
The numbers of attaching bolts 8 and 7 are, in a concrete example, respectively 28 and 4. It has been verified that the 28 bolts can safely attach the compressor to the disk. The difference of 4 relative to an assembly of 32 has no effect. The calculations have thus demonstrated it particularly for the torquing, the mechanical stresses, the lifetime of the parts, etc.<br>
Finally it is observed that this arrangement allows blade spacing between the compressor module and the turbine module.<br>
In order to allow the balancing of the module, provision is made to place weights on the upstream face of the disk of the component 5 which then advantageously forms the upstream balancing plane. A module comprising this balancing device is shown in figure 7. The module comprises a flange 10 for coupling the weights to this face. The flange 10 is annular with a face perpendicular to the axis of the module, and comprises a plurality of machinings for the mounting of the weights. The number of machinings is preferably equal to that of the number of fins mounted on the turbine disk.<br>
Figure 7 shows a weight 11 in place held by bolts 111. In this case, installing these weights makes it possible to restore the upstream balancing plane of the HP turbine module rotor. This contributes to one of the conditions of delivery of a so-called clean module.<br>
A module according to the present invention does not adversely affect the maintenance of the surrounding modules.<br>
