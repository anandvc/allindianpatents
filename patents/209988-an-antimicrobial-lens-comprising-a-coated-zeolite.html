This patent application claims priority of a provisional application, U.S. Ser. No. 60/309,642 which was filed on August 2, 2001.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to antimicrobial lenses as well as methods of their production, and use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Contact lenses have been used commercially to improve vision since the 1950s. The first contact lenses were made of hard materials. They were used by a patient during waking hours and removed for cleaning. Current developments in the field gave rise to soft contact lenses, which may be worn continuously, for several days or more without removal for cleaning. Although many patients favor these lenses clue to their increased comfort, these lenses can cause some adverse reactions to the user. The extended use of the lenses can encourage the buildup of bacteria or other microbes, particularly, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, on the surfaces of soft contact lenses. The buildup of bacteria and other microbes can cause adverse side effects such as contact lens acute red eye and the like. Although the problem of bacteria and other microbes is most often associated with the extended use of soft contact lenses, the build-up of bacteria and other microbes occurs for users of hard contact lens wearers as well.<br>
Therefore, there is a need to produce contact lenses that inhibit the growth of bacteria or other microbes and/or the adhesion of bacterial or other microbes on the surface of contact lenses. Further there is a need to produce contact lenses which do not promote the adhesion and/or growth of bacteria or other microbes on the surface of the contact lenses. Also there is a need to produce contact lenses that inhibit adverse responses related to the growth of bacteria or other microbes.<br>
Others have recognized the need to produce soft contact lenses that inhibit the growth of bacteria or other microbes One reference discloses that silver, a known antimicrobial agent, can be incorporated into contact lenses<br>
1<br><br>
using a silver zeolite to give an antimicrobial lens. This reference, EP 1050314 A1, teaches that a certain weight percentage of silver zeolites can be molded into a lens. However, the teaching of this reference does not solve the problem of microbial growth or adhesion on contact lenses.<br>
The antimicrobial effect of the lenses of EP 1,050,314 is caused by the exchange of silver between the zeolites and the surrounding tissues. However, since the zeolites of EP 1,050,314 rapidly release silver, the antimicrobial activity of these lenses reduces rapidly as silver diffuses into the ocular environment and the surrounding tissues, fn some cases it has been shown that lenses containing silver zeolites lose their antimicrobial effect En less than 24 hours. For lenses that are meant to be used for a period of a week or more, an antimicrobial effect of less than 24 hours is insufficient. Therefore there exists a need to produce lenses whose antimicrobial effect extends for more than 24 hours. This need is filled by the invention described below.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1       Lens Movement versus Silver Content<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention includes an antimicrobial lens comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a coated zeolite.<br>
As used herein, the term, "antimicrobial lens; means a lens that exhibits one or more of the following properties, the inhibition of the adhesion of bacteria or other microbes to the lenses, the inhibition of the growth of bacteria or other microbes on lenses., and the killing of bacteria or other microbes on the surface of lenses or in an area surrounding the lenses, For purposes of this invention, adhesion of bacteria or other microbes to lenses, the growth of bacteria or other microbes on lenses and the presence of bacterial or other microbes on the surface of lenses is collectively referred to as "microbial colonization." Preferably, the lenses of the invention exhibit at least a 1-log reduction (&gt; 90% inhibition) of viable bacteria or other microbes, more preferably a 2-log reduction (&gt; 99% inhibition) of viable bacteria or other microbes. Such bacteria or other microbes include but are not limited to those organisms found in the eye, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa,<br>
2<br><br>
Acanthamoeba species, Staphyloccus. aureus, E coli, Staphyloccus epidermidls, and Serratia marcesens.<br>
As use herein, the term "zeolites" means an aluminosilicate having a three dimensional skeletal structure that is generally represented by xM2/n O Al2O3:ySiO22H2O written,with Al2O3as a basis, wherein M represents an ion-exchangeable cationic species, which is usually the ion of a monovalent or divalent metal; n corresponds to the valence of the metal; x is a coefficient of the metal oxide; y is a coefficient of silica; and z is the number of waters of crystallization. The metal component of the zeolite includes metals that have antimicrobial activity such as silver, copper, zinc, mercury, tin, lead, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, nickei! or a combination of two or more of these metals. Aside from metals M can be other cationic species for example ammonium cations such as tetramethylammonium. Often zeolites contain a mixture of metals, including metals that do not confer antimicrobial activity. Examples of these metal cations include potassium, sodium, calcium, and the like. These metals may be present in zeolites of the invention in addition to the metais that confer antibacterial activity.

Further, the invention includes an antimicrobial lens comprising, consisting of, or consisting essentially of, a coated zeolite having a duration of antimicrobial activity greater than that of a lens comprising a non-coated zeolite.<br>
The terms lens, antimicrobial, coated zeolite, and zeolite all have their aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges. The phrase "duration of antimicrobial activity" means the amount of time that the lenses of the invention reduce microbial colonization on the lenses. The duration of antimicrobial activity can be tested by a broth assay or a vortex assay.<br>
In the vortex assay a culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ATCC# 15442 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) was grown overnight in a nutrient medium. The bacterial inoculum was prepared to result in a final concentration of approximately 1 x 108 colony forming units/mL. Three contact lenses were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 +0.2. Each rinsed contact lens was combined with two (2) mL of bacterial inoculum into a sterile glass vial, which was rotated in a shaker-incubator (100 rpm) for two (2) hrs. at 37 + 2°C. Each lens was rinsed with PBS-to remove-loosely bound cells, placed into 10 mL of PBS containing 0,05% w/v Tween™ 80 and vortexed at 2000 rpm for three minutes. The resulting supernatant was enumerated for viable bacteria, and the results, reported of the detected viable bacteria attached to three lenses were averaged.<br>
   in the biological broth assay, lenses of the invention are washed with<br>
8<br><br>
Dulbecco's Phosohate Buffered Saline without calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, are placed into 1000 µl of Mueller Hinton Broth containing approxiamtely 108 cfu/ml Pseudomonss aeruginosa (ATCC 15442), and sre incubated at 37 + 20C overnight. The resulting solutions were observed for opacity and cultured to enumerate the bacteria, and compared to similar lenses without coated zeolites.<br>
Although the lenses of the invention may not sustain the same level of activity for the duration of its recommended use, the lenses of the invention sustain their antimicrobial activity for a longer period of time than lenses prepared from uncoated zeolites.<br>
Still further, the invention Includes a method of reducing the adverse effects associated with microbial colonization in the ocular regions of a mammal comprising, consisting of, or consisting essentially of, placing an antimicrobial lens comprising a coated zeolite on the eye of a mammal.<br>

produce a coated zeolite<br>
(b)	adding the coated zeolite of step (a) to a lens formulation prior to<br>
curing said lens formulation.<br>
The terms lens, antimicrobial lens, and hydrophobic monomer, coated zeolite all have their aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges. The coating of the zeolites can be accomplished by a number of methods which include but<br>
9<br><br>
are not limited to stirring, spraying, sonicating, plasma coating, or heating the zeolite with a silane or a hydrophobic monomer.<br>

Yet even further still, the invention includes a method of coating a zeolite with a silane comprising contacting the zeolite with a silane at a pH of about greater than 10 and about less than 12.<br>
Even, yet further still, the invention includes a method of producing an antimicrobial lens comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a coated zeolite<br>
where the method comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the steps of<br>
(a)	coating a zeolite containing a non-antimicrobial metal with a silane or a hydrophobic monomer to form a coated zeolite;<br>
(b)	adding the zeolite of step (a) to a lens formulation prior to curing said lens formulation;<br>
(c)	curing the lens formulation to produce a lens and<br>
(d)	treating the lens of step (d) with an solution containing soluble salts of an antimicrobial metal.<br>
The terms lens, antimicrobial iens, and coated zeolite ail have their aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges. The term "non-antimicrobial metal" refers to metais that impart little or no antimicrobial activity to zeolites and lenses made from those zeolites. The non-antimicrobial metals include but are not limited to potassium, sodium, and calcium. The preferred non-antimicrobial metal is sodium. The antimicrobial metals are metals that confer antimicrobial activity to the zeolites and lenses made from those zeolites. The preferred antimicrobial metals are silver, copper, and zinc, or a combination thereof. If the antimicrobial metal is silver, the soluble salts of that metal include but are not limited to silver nitrate, silver acetate, silver citrate, silver sulfate, and silver plcrate.

Providing a lens that fits a wide range of patients has been a quest of eye care practitioners and lens manufacturers for a number of years. In order to produce such a lens, many variables, such as lens material, design, surface treatments, and additional components such as ophthalmic drugs, tints, dyes and pigments can come into play. For example it has been shown that if one adds too much of an additional component, such as an antimicrobial agent, a lens that will become adhered to the eye is produced. However, if one is attempting to produce an antimicrobial lens, a balance should be struck between producing a lens that contains enough antimicrobial agent to produce the desired effect without producing a iens that adheres to the eye.<br>
One way to assess if a lens fit is acceptable (i.e. the lens is not adhered) is to assess the tightness of the fit of a lens. (Young, G. et al, Influence of Soft Contact Lens Design on Clinical Performance, Optometry and Vision Science, Vol 70, No., 5 pp. 394403) Tightness of a lens may be assessed using an In vivo push up test. In that test, a lens is placed on a patient's eye. Subsequently, an eye care practitioner presses hie or her finger digitally upward against the lower lid of the patient's eye and observes whether the lens moves on the patient's eye (Id.). Lenses that do not move under these circumstances are not considered to be a good fit for the patient's eye, for lenses that are too tight will not move when the patient blinks and may become uncomfortable. Therefore one of the objects of this invention is to produce an antimicrobial lens that does not adhere to the patient's eye.<br>
To meet this objective, the invention includes an antimicrobial lens comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of silver, wherein said lens has sufficient movement on the eye of a patient, provided that the iens does not contain significant amounts of un-coated zeolites having a diameter of greater that 200 nm.<br>
The terms lens, antimicrobial lens, all have their aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges. The phrase "movement on the eye of a patient" refers to whether a lens, when placed on the eye of a patient moves under the push-up test described above. This test Is described in further detail in Contact Lens Practice, Chapman &amp; Hall, 1994, edited by M, Ruben and M. Guillen, pgs. 589-99. Under this test lenses are given an -2 rating if they do<br>

not move on the eye of a patient in the digital push-up test. Therefore lenses that score greater than a "-2" on the digital push-up test are lenses that move on a patient's eye. In a statistically significant patient population, lenses that may be suitable for one patient may not be suitable for another. Therefore, tenses having sufficient movement are lenses that move on at least about 50 to about 100% of a given patient population. Preferably, said lenses move on about 75 to about 100%, of patients, more preferably, about 80 to about 100%, most preferably about 90 to about 100%,<br>
The term "silver" refers to silver metal of any oxidation state (Ag°, Ag1+ or Ag2+) that is incorporated into a lens, where the preferred oxidation state is oxidized silver. The amount of silver that is Incorporated into the lenses ranges from about 20 ppm to about 100,000 ppm, where any lens containing at least about 20 ppm has antimicrobial properties. The preferred amount of silver that is incorporated Into the lens is about 20 ppm to about 4,000 ppm, more preferably, 20 ppm to about 1,500 ppm, even more preferably about 30 ppm to about 600 ppm.<br>
Lenses containing zeolites or coated zeolites are one way of producing an antibacterial lens that contains silver and have sufficient movement on the eye of a patient. However, they are not only lenses containing silver that may have sufficient movement. Other methods of incorporating into contact lenses may be used, provided that those methods produce lenses having sufficient movement on the eye of a patient. For example, lenses containing monomers that reversibiy bind to silver ("Monomers of 030") are another way of producing such a lens. The preparation and use of lenses containing Monomers of 030 is disclosed in U.S. Provisional App. Ser. No. 60/257,030, filed on December 21, 2000 and in a U.S. patent application entitled "Antimicrobial Contact Lenses And Methods For Their Production," that was filed on December 20, 2001 and claims priority from the provisional application. This reference is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, in addition to the methods disclosed in the filed application, one can bind silver to Monomers of 030 prior to incorporation into lens formulations to produce lenses containing silver and Monomers of 030.<br>

Another method of incorporating silver into lenses is to treat a lens that does not contain silver with a silver containing solution. Therefore, the invention includes a method of adding silver to an antimicrobial lens. comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of heating a lens with a silver containing solution.<br>
Silver may be added to the lens by washing the cured and hydrated lens in a silver solution such as silver nitrate In delonized water ("DC). Other sources of silver include but are not limited to silver acetate, silver citrate, silver iodide, silver lactate, silver picrate, and silver sulfate. The concentration of silver in these solutions can vary from the concentration required to add a known quantity of silver to a lens to a saturated silver solution. In order to calculate the concentration of the silver solution needed, the following calculation is used: the concentration of silver solution is equal to the desired amount of silver per lens, multiplied by the dry weight of the lens divided by the total volume of treating solution.<br>
silver solution concentration (ug/mL) = [desired silver in lens (ug/g) x<br>
average dry lens weight (g)]/ total volume of treating solution (mL) For example, If one requires a lens containing 40 pg/g of silver, the dry weight of the lens is 0.02 g, and the vessel used to treat said lens has a volume of 3mL, the required silver concentration would be 0.27 µg/mL<br>
As used herein "heating" has its common meaning where the temperature at which the lens is heated is from about 40 to about 130°C.<br>
Yet another method of incorporating silver into lenses is to add silver salts to lens formulations. Silver salts that may be added include but are not limited to silver acetate, silver citrate, silver iodide, silver lactate, silver picrate, and silver sulfate.<br>
Yet, still another method of incorporating silver into lenses is to produce lenses containing nano-sized zeolites. Therefore the invention includes an antimicrobial lens comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of nano-<br>
sized zeolites.<br>
The terms, lens, antimicrobial lens, silver, and zeolites all have their aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges. The term "nano-sized" refers to the diameter of the zeolites. The diameter of the nano-sized zeolites used in<br>
13<br><br>
this invention is about 10 to about 200 nanometers (nm). preferably, about 10 to about 150 nm, most preferably about 50 nm to about 100 nm.<br>
Still, yet another method of incorporating silver into lenses is to produce lenses containing silver and an oxidizing agent. Often when silver is incorporated into lenses, the lenses turn from clear to a discolored appearance over time. This discoloration may compromise the visual acuity of the lens and can be esthetieally unappealing to the patient Therefore, preventing or reducing discoloration is a goal of any lens producer. To meet this goal, the invention includes an antimicrobial lens comprising silver and an oxidizing agent.<br>
The terms, antimicrobial, lens, and silver all have their aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges. "Oxidizing agents" are substances that remove an electron from Ag° to produce Ag+1 or Ag+2, Oxidizing agents include but are not limited to hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides such as, peracetic acid, performic acid, perbenzoic acid, or inorganic oxidants such as sodium hypochlorite, potassium permanganate, oxygen, iodine, sodium iodate, nitric acid, sodium or potassium nitrate, sodium peroxide, sodium or potassium periodate, sodium or potassium perchlorate, potassium persulfate, sodium perborate, and potassium peroxydiphosphate. The preferred oxidants for use in this invention are those with good water solubility and low toxicity such as hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, sodium or potassium nitrate and sodium hypochlorite. The most preferred oxidant is hydrogen peroxide. Oxidizing agents are added to contact lens formulations prior to curing at a concentration of about 10 to about 1000 ppm,<br>
In addition to preparing antimicrobial lenses containing silver and oxidizing agents, there are other methods of reducing discoloration in lenses containing silver that are prone to discoloration. Therefore, the invention includes a method of reducing discoloration in an antimicrobial lens comprising, consisting essentially of or consisting of contacting said antimicrobial lens with an oxidizing agent.<br>
The terms, antimicrobial, lens, and oxidizing agent all have their aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges.   The term "contacting" includes any means of placing the oxidizing agent in close physical proximity<br>
14<br><br>
with the lens. The most common method of contacting is to prepare an aqueous solution of the oxidizing agent and to stir, soak, or otherwise mix the lens in said solution.<br>
In order to illustrate the invention the following examples are included. These examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest a method of practicing the invention. Those knowledgeable in contact lenses as well as other specialties may find other methods of practicing the invention. However, those methods are deemed to be within the scope of this invention.<br>

Macromer 2 Preparation<br>
To a dry container housed in a dry box under nitrogen at ambient temperature wag added 30.0 g (0.277 mol) of bis(dimethylamino)methylsilan8, a solution of 13,75 mL of a 1M solution of TBACB (386,0 g TBACB in 1000 mL. dry THF), 61.39 g (0.578 mol) of p-xylene, 154.28 g (1.541 mol) methyl methacrylate (1.4 equivalents relative to initiator), '892.13 (9.352 mol) 2-(trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate (8.5 equivalents relative to initiator) and 4399.78 g (61.01 mol) of THF. To a dry,, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermocouple and condenser, all connected to a nitrogen source, was charged the above mixture prepared in the dry box.<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled to 15 °C while stirring and purging with nitrogen. After the solution reached 15 °C, 191.75 g (1.100 mol) of v trimethyisiloxy-1-methoxy-2-methy!propene (1 equivalent) was injected into the reaction vessel. The reaction was allowed to exotherm to approximately 62 0C and then 30 mL of a 0,40 M solution of 154.4 g TBACB in 11 mL of dry THF was metered in throughout the remainder of the reaction. After the temperature of reaction reached 30 °C and the metering began, a solution of 467.56 g (2.311 mol) 2-(tri,methylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate (2.1 equivalents relative to the initiator), 363S.S. g (3.463 mol) n-butyl monomethacryloxypropyl-polydimethylsiloxane (3.2 equivalents relative to the initiator). 3573.84 g (3.689<br>
16<br><br>
mol), TRIS (7.9 equivalents relative to the initiator) and 20.0 g bis(dimethylamino)methylsilang was added.<br>
The mixture was allowed to exotherm to approximately 38-42 °C and then allowed to cool to 30 °C. At that time, a solution of 10.0 g (0.076 mol) bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane, 154,26 g (1.540 mol) methyl methacryfate (1.4 equivalents relative to the initiator) and 1892,13 g (9.352 mol) 2-trimethylsiIoxy)ethyl methacrylate (8.5 equivalents relative to the initiator) was added and the mixture again alowed to exotherm to approximately 40 °C, The reaction temperature dropped to approximately 30 °C and 2 gallons of THF were added to decrease the viscosity. A solution of 439.69 g water, 740.6 g methanol and 8.8 g (0.068 mol) dichloroacetic acid was added and the mixture refluxed for 4.5 hours to de-block the protecting groups on the HE-MA. Volatiles were then removed and toluene added to aid in removal of the water until a vapor temperature of 110 °C was reached.<br>
The reaction flask was maintained at approximately 110 °C and a solution of 443 g (2.201 mol) TMI and 5.7 g (0.010 mol) dibutyltin dilaurate were added. The mixture was reacted until the isocyanate peak was gone by IR. The toluene was evaporateo under reduced pressure to yield an off-white, anhydrous, waxy reactive monomer. The macromer was placed into acetone at a weight basis of approximately 2:1 acetone to macromer, After 24 hrs, water was added to precipitate out the macromer and the macromer was filtered and dried using a vacuum oven between 45 and 60 °C for 20-30 hrs.<br>

Example 1 Ereparation of Octadecyl Trimethoxysilane Coated .Zeolites Type A zeolite particles (15.0 grams, average particle size 1000nm to 2000 nm) containing 10% silver by weight were added to methanol (150 mL). Glacial acetic acid (9 µL) and octadecyltrimethoxysliane (15 mL) were added and the suspension was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. The solvent was removed by vacuum filtration to give a solid. This solid was re-susponded in ethanol and isolated by vacuum filtration 3 times. The resulting solid was dried under vacuum to give Zeolite A1 as a fine powder.<br>
Example 2 Preparation of Lenses Al A hydrogel blend was made from the following monomer mix (all amounts were calculated as weight percent of the total weight of the combination): 17.98% Macromer 2, 28.0% rnPDMS, 14.0% TRIS, 26.0% DMA, 5.0% HEMA, 1.0% TEGDMA, 5.0% PVP, 1.0% CGI 1850, 2.0% Norbloc, and 0.02% Blue HEMA. To 80 part (wgt) of this blend were added 0.19 parts Zeolites of Example 1,1.0 part acetic acid (when Macromer 4 is used, no acetic acid is added) and 20 parts 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol, Zeolites of Example 1 (0,24%) were added to the hydrogel blend. This mixture was sonicated until all components were dispersed (ca.30 minutes). The sonicated mixture was loaded to an eight cavity lens mold of the type described in U.S. Patent 4,640,489 and cured for 1200 sec. Polymerization occurred under a nitrogen purge and was photoinitiated with visible light generated with a Philips TL 20W/03T fluorescent bulbs, at temperatures of 45 to 75°C. After curing, the molds were opened, and the ienses were released into 60% IPA, then leached<br>
18<br><br>
in an IPA/DI water step down to remove any residual monomers and diluent. Finally, the lenses are equilibrated in either D| water or physiological borate-buffered saline to give Lenses A<br>
Example 3 Preparation of Di-vinyl Ethylene Oxide Zeolites and. Lenses B1 Type A zeolites (10% silver 1000-2000 nm) were dried In a vacuum oven at 100°C overnight and loaded into a modified plasma chamber as described by V. Panchalingam, X. Chen, C. R. Savage, R. B. Timmons and R. C. Eberhart, J. Appl. Polm. Sci.: Appl. Polym. Symp., 54,123 (1994). This device was modified by replacing the stationary chamber with a rotating chamber. The dried zeolites were placed loaded into the rotating chamber and treated with an argon plasma pulsed at 10/100 milli-seconds on/off cycle ("ms cycle") and 100 Watts for 15 minutes The argon treated zeolites were subsequently treated with E02V plasma, pulsed at 10/200 ms cycle and 100 W for 100 minutes. The resulting particles were removed from the chamber and passed through a 400-mesh stainless sieve. These filtered particles were treated a second time with E02V plasma, pulsed at 10/200 ms cycle and 100 W for 100 minutes and collected to give Zeolite B1 as a solid. One percent (1.0%) of Zeolite BVas added to the hydrogel blend of Example 2.

Example 7 Preparation of Nanoscate Zeolites Nanoscale zeolites were prepared with a tetramethylammonium template, using the procedure described by B.J. Schoeman et. al. In ZEOLITES, 1994, Vol. 14, February, 1994, p. 110-116, following the procedure to make A1, but without the addition of NaOH. Particle size analysis using a BECKMAN Coulter Particle Size Analyzer showed the particles to have a mean size of 164 nm with a standard deviation of 44 nm. These particles were rinsed three times with borate buffered saline solution, once with deionized water, three times with methanol, in each case isolating the zeolites by ultracentrifugation. 3.42 g of zeolite was suspended in 34.2 g methanol. 3.42 ml deionized water, 0.34 g acetic acid, and 3.42 g octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS) were added, The suspension was stirred for 71 hours at room temperature, then rinsed three times with 25 ml methanol and ultracentrifuged. Silicone hydrogel lenses were made by combining 0.25% (wgt) of this OTS-treated nanozeolite with the hydrogel blend of Example 2 and lenses were prepared by the method of Example 2. These lenses were treated with silver<br>
21<br><br>
by placing them into 5.0% aqueous silver nitrate solution at 45eC for five minutes and subsequently rinsing them with DI.<br>
Example 8 The procedure of Example 7 was followed, except using triethylamins amine in place of acetic acid to catalyze the OTS reaction.<br>
Example 9 Preparation of Lenses .G1<br>
Using a procedure adapted from Chem. Mater. 5(6), 1993, 869-875, silver zeolite (2 g Type A zeolites, 20% Ag by weight), 200mg of polybutadiene (average Mn = 3,000, 0.066mmole), and 20mL of dichloromethane were charged in a 150mL beaker flask. The apparatus was connected to a rotary evaporator and rotated for 30 minutes with the heating bath set at 40eC. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and a solution of 60mg of 2,21-azobisisobutyronitrile (0.375mmole) in 5mL of dichloromethane was added to the suspension. The flask was connected to the rotary evaporator, and the solvent was removed with rapid rotation, while maintaining the temperature below 200C.<br>
The solid reactant system was spread as a thin layer in a crystallizing dish. The vessel was covered with filter paper and placed in a vacuum oven at 100°C for three hours to crosslink the polybutadiene coating. The yield was 1.85g of white hydrophobic material (84.09%, Note- the zeolite used !n the process had a water content of around 10% by weight, isolated yield is greater than that reported (closer to 92%)).<br>
The coated zeolite (0.5% w/w) w2s dispersed into the hydrogel blend of Example 2 and lenses were fabricated using the method of Example 2 to give lens G1. The release assay of Example 5 was carried out and the results are tabulated in Table 3.<br>
E-xample 10 Preparation of Lenses H1 2 grams of zeolite containing 10% Ag zeolite (Type A having an average<br>

particle diameter of 1000 to 2000 nm), 50 mL methylene chloride, 500 mL H20, 100 mL triethylamine were combined in a 250 ml beaker and stirred until uniform consistency achieved (typically 30-60 min). .250 mL of octadecyltrichlorosilane was added every 15 minutes to a total of 2 mL of siiane (8 additions- 2 hours). The sample was filtered using the following procedure: 1) vacuum filter to dry powder, 2) re-suspend in methylene chloride, shaking vigorously, 3) repeat (1) and (2) 4 times. After the fourth filtration procedure the isolated solid dried under vacuum for 4 hr at room temperature. Prior to use, the zeolite powder was ground with a mortar and pestle.<br>

Example 12 Alternative Monomer Formulations Base Monomer Formations<br>
Formulations B-R, listed in Table 4, are the base monomer mixes (all amounts are calculated as weight percent of the total weight of the monomer mix combination). The coated zeolites (0.0005%w/w (50 ppm) to about 1.0 % w/w) of the invention may be added to all of the compositions of Table 1 and contact lenses may be prepared according to the following method.<br>
Contact Lens Formation<br>
The blends are sonicated at 25-37°C until all components are dissolved or dispersed (30-120 minutes) and are subsequently loaded to an eight cavity lens mold of the type described in U.S. Patent 4,640,489 and cured for 1200 sec.<br>

Example 13 Preparation of Lenses Containing an Oxidizing Agent A hydrogel blend was made from the following monomer mix (all amounts were calculated as weight percent of the total weight of the combination): 17.98% Macromer 2. 28.0% mPDMS, 14.0% TRIS, 26.0% DMA, 5.0% HEMA, 1.0% TEGDMA, 5.0% PVP, 1.0% CGI 1850, and 2.0% Norbioc, blended with D30 as a diluent in a ratio of 80 parts mixture with 20 parts diluent. To this blend was added 1.0 part acetic acid, 1000 ppm (wt) A-type zeolite containing 20% (wt) silver and 354 ppm hydrogen peroxide. This mixture was sonicated until all components were dispersed (ca.45 minutes). The sonicated mixture was loaded to an eight cavity lens thermoplastic mold and cured for 1200 sec. Polymerization occurred under a nitrogen purge and was photoinitiated with visible light generated with a Philips TL 20W/03T fluorescent bulbs, curing for 25 minutes at 500C, After curing, the molds were opened, and the lenses were released into 50% IPA in water, then leached In tPA to remove any residual monomers and diluent. Finally, the lenses are equilibrated in physiological borate-buffered saline. After four days at room temperature these lenses were colorless, as compared to lenses that were made without addition of H202, which had developed a visible brown color. Additional concentrations of hydrogen peroxide tested as described above and the observations of lens color are listed in Table 5.<br><br><br>
Lenses; were made following example 13, but with addition of 0.25% (wt) type-A zeolite containing 20% (wt) silver and without addition of hydrogen peroxide to the monomer mix. These lenses were placed into optically transparent cells containing test or control lens storage solution. The lenses were then either stored under a bank of fluorescent lights for two months. The test solution was a solution of sodium borate, boric acid, and sodium perborate sufficient to generate up to 0.006% hydrogen peroxide (sold under the trade name Quick Care FINISHING SOLUTION by CIBA Vision Corporation), and the test solution was borate buffered saline without the sodium perborate. The color of the lenses was measured using the CIELAB convention with an portable sphere spectrophotometer from X-Rite, incorporated. The L, a, and b values of three lens measurements were averaged and are reported in Table 6, The small changes in the a and b values of the perborate-treated stored lenses, as compared to the saline-stored lenses, illustrate that the perborate prevents discoloration of the lenses. The b color coordinate indicates the amount of yellowness (higher positive b value = more yellowness) in a given material or its blueness (lower negative b value - mere blueness). Comparison of the b values of Table 6 show that the yellowing of lenses is prevented in perborate containing solution,<br><br>
Example 15 Treatment of Lenses With an Oxidizina Agent Lenses were prepared as in Example 13, but without addition of silver-zeolite ot addition of hydrogen peroxide to the monomer mix. These lenses were placed into commercial foil-sealed polypropylene lens packages, along with 10 µl of of a 0.10% aqueous solution of H202, 20 µl of a solution of Ag+ (0.75 wt% Ag), and diluted with a solution of 9.26 g/L boric acid, 1.86 g/L<br>
27<br><br>
sodium borate and an appropriate surfactant in water to a total volume of 1.0 ml. The sealed lenses were autoclaved for 30 minutes at 121°C. The solution was colorless, as compared to a comparative experiment which omitted the H202, in which the solution was visibly yellow.<br>
Example 16 Treatment of Lenses With an Oxidizing Aqent Lenses were made as in Example 13, but with 1000 ppm cf 10% (wt) silver-zeolites, and without the hydrogen peroxide in the monomer mix, The lenses were placed individually into glass vials with 2 ml borate-buffered saline containing 1,5% H202. The lenses were observed over a period of 48 hours, over which time they remained colorless. Analysis for silver immediately after lens formation and 48 hours later showed no drop in silver level. The lenses exhibited a 1.7 log drop in viable bacteria in the vortex assay described above as compared to lenses without the silver-zeolites and not treated in H202.<br>
Example 17 Dispersion of Monomer Formulations with Particulate Matter A dispersion that may be used to form some of the lenses of the invention, such as lenses containing silver salts*, Momomer of 030 that are bound to silver, or zeolites, is prepared by the following method. Once formed this dispersion may be cured using the methods of Example 1. Pre-Disperslon<br>

Example 18 Movement of Lenses Lenses were prepared using the method of Example 2. Ail lenses contained 0.25 weight percent of Type A zeolites. The zeolites of entries 2-13 contain 20% active silver by weight based upon the weight of the added zeolites. The silver content of entry 1 was 10 % active silver by weight based upon the weight of the added zeolites, In addition, the zeolites of entry 1 were coated with EO2 V as described in Exampte 3. Entry 14 was prepared using 0.25 % of a Type A zeolite that contains sodium instead of silver. This zeolite was coated with OTS using the method of Example 1 and subsequently treated with a silver solution before it was incorporated into the lens formulation of example 2, Prior to insertion in patient's eyes, the amount of silver in the lenses was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission. The movement of each lens type was tested on ten (10) subjects per type of lens using the push up assay (Contact tens Practice, Chapman &amp; Hall, 1994, edited by M. Ruben and M Guillen, pgs. 589-99). All lenses were evaluated 30 minutes after placing the lenses on patients' eyes. The percentage of lenses having acceptable movement qualities was calculated as follows. Any lens having a score of greater than -2 on the push up test was an acceptable lens. In a each patient study, the number of acceptable lenses was divided by the total number lenses. Lenses having a percentage of movement equal to or greater than 50% are acceptable, In addition, prior to insertions in a patient's eyes the efficacy of the lenses tested using the Vortex Assay. The activity of<br>

the lenses in these assays is listed in Table 7 as the log reduction of the assay. Figure 1 shows the percentage lenses having acceptable movement vs the amount of silver in each tens.<br>
