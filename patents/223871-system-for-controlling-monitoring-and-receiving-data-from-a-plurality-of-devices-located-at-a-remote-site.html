				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to electronic systems for remotely<br>
controlling and for remotely monitoring a plurality of electrical apparatuses, and<br>
which provides for internet-based two-way communication, monitoring<br>
control. More particularly, the present invention relates to such systems that are<br>
scalable to permit many additional apparatuses to be easily added to the existing<br>
system at a remote site, in which the newly added apparatuses automatically<br>
register upon the system during periodic registration subroutines and in which<br>
the real-time clocks of the system components are periodically corrected to the<br>
current Greenwich Mean Time by a time synchronization subroutine.<br>
[0002] A prior monitoring and control system is shown in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,236,332, entitled Control and Monitoring System, which is assigned to the<br>
assignee of this invention and which discloses a two-way wireless<br>
communications system for permitting the control, monitoring and collection of<br>
data from electrical apparatus includes a host computer, control and monitoring<br>
units remotely located from the host computer, and subscriber software for<br>
establishing communication protocol with each unit. The host computer includes<br>
a customer interface gateway, which handles communications from the<br>
subscriber software to the host system, a wireless service gateway, which<br>
handles all communications with the remotely located units, and a product data<br>
processor for processing data obtained from either a customer via the subscriber<br>
software or a particular remote unit. The subscriber software permits customers<br>
to have desktop control of their electrical apparatus associated with a remote<br>
unit. Each remote unit contains a motherhood, power supply, and modem. Each<br>
unit is capable of real-time monitoring and control of the electrical apparatus<br>
associated with the unit. This system provides for two-way signaling, but does<br>
not contemplate control of a plurality of devices by the remote unit. Neither does<br>
this patent provide for automatic registration of system compounds or <br>
automatic time synchronization among the system components.<br>
[0003] Another known system for remotely controlling electrical apparatus is<br>
shown and described in U. S. Patent No. 5,936,362, entitled Programmable<br>
remote control systems for electrical apparatuses, which is also assigned to the<br>
assignee of this invention and which discloses a control system for remotely<br>
controlling the application of electric power to a plurality of electric apparatuses<br>
includes a radio transmitting device at a central location, and a radio receiving<br>
device and a control unit at each electrical apparatus location. Programming<br>
signals designating the operating protocol or mode and the location of the<br>
electrical apparatus are transmitted by a radio-programming signal to the control<br>
unit associated with each electrical apparatus. Subsequently, timing reference<br>
signals are transmitted to the control units of all electrical apparatus. Each<br>
control unit interprets and responds to the timing signals in accordance with<br>
previously received programming signals to control the application of electric<br>
power to the electrical apparatus in accordance with a predetermined operating<br>
protocol. The system disclosed in this patent has wide application to a variety of<br>
different remotely located apparatus, including the lighting of signs, climate<br>
control, irrigation control, traffic control and so forth. However, this system<br>
operates through the one-way wireless transmission of radio signals from the<br>
host computer. Thus, the remote site is generally limited to a location within the<br>
range of reliable radio signaling. Electronic signaling equipment must generally<br>
be replicated at each site where the remotely controlled apparatus is located.<br>
[0004] Yet another system is located in U. S. Patent No. 5,898,384, entitled<br>
Programmable remote control systems for electrical apparatuses, which is also<br>
assigned to the assignee of this invention and which discloses a control system<br>
for remotely controlling the application of electric power to a plurality of electrical<br>
apparatuses (10) includes a radio transmitting device (20) at a central location,<br>
and a radio receiving device (22) and a control unit (16) at each electrical<br>
apparatus location. During set-up an electrical apparatus, programming signals<br>
designating the operating protocol or mode and the location of the electrical<br>
apparatus are transmitted by a radio-programming signal to the control unit (16)<br>
associated with each electrical apparatus. Subsequently, timing reference signals<br>
containing a multiple-digit computer generated code designating the time of<br>
delay and the time of sunrise and sunset on a particular day within particular<br>
latitudinal zones are transmitted by a radio to the control units (16) of all<br>
electrical apparatus (10). Each control unit interprets and responds to the timing<br>
signals in accordance with previously received programming signals to control<br>
the application of electric power to the electrical apparatus in accordance with a<br>
predetermined operating protocol. Each control unit is also provided with a two-<br>
way communication answer back capability to advise the control command<br>
center that previously sent messages have been received and to provide status<br>
report information. As taught in the preferred embodiment, this patent teaches<br>
the use of radio frequency (RF) pagers to remotely activate or deactivate<br>
electrical apparatus, with one pager required for each remote device. This<br>
system is also a one-way wireless transmission of radio signals.<br>
[0005] A need exits for a system for remotely controlling and monitoring<br>
apparatus in which many additional devices may be easily and inexpensively<br>
added to the system without having to replicate the entire remote potion of the<br>
system at each remote site for each additionally added device.<br>
[0006] A need also exists for automatically registering each system component<br>
on the control and monitoring system so that a network operating center can<br>
quickly communicate with existing and newly installed devices.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] The present invention provides a microprocessor-based system for<br>
controlling and monitoring a plurality of remotely located electrical devices. A<br>
network operating center (NOC) communicates with the plurality of remotely<br>
located devices to provide control commands, to monitor current status and to<br>
receive alert conditions. Customers may connect to the NOC from their personal<br>
computers (PCs) via an Internet connection, or via a<br>
worldwide data communications service to provide communication with devices at any remotely<br>
located site.<br>
[008] Microprocessor-based communications equipment at the remotely located site is provided<br>
with a two-way communications link to receive and transmit communications from and to the<br>
NOC. This equipment in turn communicates with a plurality of dedicated communications<br>
equipment. For example, the remotely located communications equipment may communicate<br>
with and through each piece of dedicated communications equipment to enable any of the<br>
devices to receive commands from the NOC and to send alert notifications from one or more<br>
devices to the NOC. Any additional devices to be added to the system at a later date need only<br>
be equipped to communicate with the already existing remotely located communications<br>
equipment. The NOC and/or the communications equipment at the remote location can also<br>
automatically register any newly installed devices or other communications equipment onto the<br>
system to quickly become fully operational with the NOC. The system also automatically<br>
synchronizes the real-time clocks of the system components by periodically initiating a time<br>
synchronization subroutine.<br>
[009] Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a system for<br>
remotely controlling and monitoring electrical apparatus via internet-based two-way<br>
communications.<br>
[0010] Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system that is easily and<br>
inexpensively expandable or scalable, such as by the addition of multiple new devices.<br>
[0011] Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system for remotely controlling<br>
and monitoring a plurality of devices that provides for automatic registration of the system<br>
components, including the devices.<br>
[0012] A further object of the present invention is to enable customers to remotely access such a<br>
control and monitoring system to determine the present status of any remotely located devices<br>
and to reprogram any control conditions via an Internet connection to a web page associated with<br>
the NOC.<br>
[0013] Another object of the present invention is to provide for periodic synchronization of all<br>
system components, including the remotely located devices, by periodic initiation of a time<br>
synchronization subroutine.<br>

[0025] FIG. 11 is a simplified flowchart illustrating the operation of the typical remote device<br>
shown in FIG. 10.<br>
[0026] Referring to the Figures, and particularly FIG. 1, a system, generally designated by<br>
reference numeral 20, controls and monitors remotely located devices. The system 20 utilizes<br>
two-way communications in accordance with the invention. FIG. 1 shows the data<br>
communications links between a network operating center (NOC) 22, customers 24, and each<br>
remote site 26 of the present invention. Each customer 24 is capable of communicating with the<br>
NOC 22 through the Internet 28 or by direct connection 30. Such customer communication may<br>
include, but is not limited to, a personal computer (PC), direct dial-up telephone line, facsimile,<br>
paging, email, data networks or even human-to-human contact.<br>
[0027] Typically, customers will have access to software that is adapted to each particular<br>
application. For example, applications may include remotely monitoring heating, ventilation and<br>
air conditioning (HVAC), street and/or parking lot lighting, sign lighting, commercial freezers<br>
and refrigerators, traffic flow, utilities, storage tanks, and the like. This gives customers desktop<br>
control and also permits near real-time monitoring of conditions at the remote sites. Data is<br>
preferably transmitted between each customer's PC and the NOC 22 via telephone lines and<br>
modems, such as by logging onto the Internet site associated with the NOC 22.<br>
[0028] A customer interface gateway 32 permits full duplex communication between the<br>
customer and the NOC 22. When data is sent from the customer to the NOC, the data is stored in<br>
a server database 34. Inbound messages 36 from customers may also be routed through a<br>
customer interface gateway, such as a data processor 38. Processor 38 processes the data<br>
received from a customer 24 and periodically scans the data for commands.<br>
[0029] Each remote site 26 communicates with the NOC 22 via the wireless service gateway 40.<br>
Inbound messages 44 received from the remote sites may also be transmitted through a two-way<br>
wireless service network 42 (FIG.2) to data processor 46 and then to NOC 22. For example, one<br>
wireless data service that enables worldwide coverage of remotely located devices is the Mobitex<br>
data service, which is operated by Cingular Wireless in the United States. Ericcson of Piano, TX<br>
makes and sells radios for Mobitex systems. Further information about Mobitex may be found at<br>
the websites www.ericsson.com/network operators/mobitex/ and at www.mobitex.org which are<br>
incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.<br>
[0030] Alternatively, the wireless service network 42 may utilize one of the digital cellular<br>
telephone standards such as GSM, TDMA or CDMA.<br>
[0031] Data processor 46 processes data received from the remote sites 26 and periodically scans<br>
the data for inbound messages from the remote sites for processing. NOC 22 then relays data to<br>
the appropriate end receivers and provides a notification routine, which may be conducted<br>
through email, facsimile, paging networks, text embedded devices, human to human, or the like.<br>
[0032] NOC 22 is a centralized control and monitoring facility that provides international access<br>
to remote sites and/or devices. It is also keeps track of all remote sites, all control and<br>
monitoring equipment installed at the remote sites, and all devices that are being controlled and<br>
monitored at the remote sites. NOC 22 is on line, runs continuously, and includes auxiliary<br>
power units for back up power supply in the event of a power failure. Preferably, NOC 22 is<br>
located in a secure, climate controlled facility that has access to auxiliary power. A redundant<br>
NOC 22 may also be employed; preferably in a geographical area that is served by a different<br>
electrical utility and by a different telephone company. NOC 22 activates and deactivates the<br>
customer applications, stores the "alert" notification signals and forwards the alert notifications,<br>
as necessary. Alert notifications generally occur when a sensed condition at one of the devices<br>
92-94 falls outside of a programmed range, or above or below a programmed threshold, for<br>
example. NOC 22 also sends commands to the devices located at each remote site 26. NOC 22<br>
further regularly communicates with the devices located at each remote site 26, and can poll<br>
them to inquire if an alert notification has been generated, or if any other performance problems<br>
are present in the system. NOC 22 also scans and processes new commands and communicates<br>
with the devices at the remote sites 26 through the wireless data network 42, for example.<br>
[0033] The commands are preferably sent in a protocol consisting of serially transmitted frames.<br>
Two different protocols may be used for sending and receiving information, each having two<br>
layers. One layer is application independent and defines the type of interaction between each<br>
remotely located device and NOC 22 at the application level. The second layer of protocol is<br>
application dependent and defines additional information. The protocol is structured so that<br>
many types of information can be sent in the same packet of data. Each frame contains different<br>
information such as customer identification bits, product identification bits, remote unit<br>
identification bits, remote device identification bits, and the like.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIG. 3, the operation of NOC 22 is shown in flowchart format. The<br>
operation of NOC 22 begins at start block 48. The NOC 22 then determines at block 50 whether<br>
it needs to perform a particular function. The function to be performed can be, for example,<br>
transmitting a command signal to a remotely located device to activate or deactivate its<br>
associated apparatus. While making this determination at block 50, NOC 22 is in its so-called<br>
comparison mode.<br>
[0035] If NOC 22 needs to perform a function, it does so at block 52 and then returns to its idle<br>
mode at the start block 48. For example, one of the functions that may be performed at block 52<br>
is to poll the master unit to determine if the master unit is synchronized to Greenwich Mean<br>
Time (GMT), which is also used by NOC 22. If no function is to be performed at decision block<br>
50, NOC determines at decision block 54 whether it has received a message from an external<br>
source. If not, NOC returns to its idle mode. If so, the NOC receives the message, processes it<br>
and stores it in memory as indicated at execution block 56, so that the data can be accessed at a<br>
future time.<br>
[0036] Thereafter, NOC 22 determines at decision block 58 whether the message was sent by a<br>
customer or from a different source, such as from a remote device or from service personnel at<br>
the remote site. If a customer sent the received message, no alert notification subroutine needs to<br>
be performed and the NOC returns to its idle mode. However, if a customer did not send the<br>
received message, the NOC determines at decision block 60 whether it needs to perform an alert<br>
notification subroutine. If the NOC needs to perform the alert notification subroutine, it does so<br>
at block 62 and then returns to the idle mode. If not, the NOC immediately returns to its idle<br>
mode.<br>
[0037] The remotely located site, generally designated by reference numeral 66, of the control<br>
and monitoring system 20 is illustrated in FIG. 2. Remote site 66 communicates with the NOC<br>
22 via the two-way wireless network 42, which is described above. Remote site 66 includes a<br>
collection of one or more master units 68 and 70. The remote site 66 can be scaled up to include<br>
a nearly infinite number of master units 68-70, each with a unique address or identity. The<br>
actual number of master units that can be employed will be limited in practice by the available<br>
memory of the NOC 22 or by the addressing capabilities of the NOC 22. This immense<br>
scalability provides unusual near real-time control and monitoring of large numbers of devices at<br>
a plurality of remote sites 66.<br>
[0038] Master units 68-70 are each provided with a radio frequency (RF) transceiver to send and<br>
receive information from the wireless network 42. These master units 68 and 70 are<br>
commercially available from Profile Systems, LLC of Merrillville, IN under part number P1810.<br>
The P1810 master unit is also shown in FIG. 4. Further information about its functionality is<br>
presented in the flowchart of FIG. 5, which is described in more detail below.<br>
[0039] More information about the entire P1800 family of products of Profile Systems is<br>
available on the website www.profile-systems.com. which is incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety.<br>
[0040] Each master unit, for example unit 68, in turn bidirectionally communicates, such as over<br>
wire conductors, with a plurality of remote units, such as remote units 72 through 74. Preferably,<br>
communication between the master units and the remote units is pursuant to the RS485 industry<br>
standard. The number of remote units that is addressable or identifiable by a master unit is<br>
limited only by the available memory of each master unit. Remote units 72-74 are each provided<br>
with an RF transceiver to communicate in a wireless mode to a plurality of remote slave units<br>
84-90. For example, the RF communication links 80 and 82 may be 900 MHz full duplex radio<br>
links. Remote units 72-78 are commercially available from Profile Systems, LLC under part<br>
number P1820. The P1820 remote unit is also shown in FIG. 6. Further information about its<br>
functionality is presented in the flowchart of FIG. 7, which is described in more detail below.<br>
[0041] Each remote unit 72-78 in turn bidirectionally communicates, such as over the wireless<br>
links 80-82, with a plurality of remote slave units 84 through 90. The number of remote slave<br>
units that is addressable or identifiable by each remote unit is limited only by the available<br>
memory of each remote unit. like the remote units 72-78, each of the remote slave units 84-90<br>
is provided with an RF transceiver to communicate over the wireless links 80-82 to an assigned<br>
remote unit 72 or 74. Remote slave units 84-90 are commercially available from Profile<br>
Systems, IXC under part number P1830. The P1830 remote slave unit is also shown in FIG. 8.<br>
Further information about its functionality is presented in the flowchart of FIG. 9, which is<br>
described in more detail below.<br>
[0042] Each of the master units 68-70, remote units 72-78 and remote slave units 84-90 uses an<br>
application independent protocol, which includes an application dependent protocol. These<br>
protocols permit a device specific message to be routed therethrough from the NOC 22 to the<br>
intended device 92 or 94. These protocols also permit a group message to be routed<br>
therethrough, such as to a group of devices 92-94. Such group commands are particular useful in<br>
simultaneously controlling groups of devices, such as to activate, deactivate or reprogram a<br>
plurality of devices.<br>
[0043] The nature of the devices 92-94 varies depending upon the conditions to be monitored or<br>
controlled. For example, devices 92-94 may sense temperature, pressure, humidity, light<br>
intensity, or the like. They may also interface with dry contacts, relays, position sensors,<br>
thermostats, or the like. In general, devices 92-94 are uniquely addressable and utilize a base<br>
command set that is device independent, such as poll by address, query model by address,<br>
respond to model inquiry by address and respond to real-time clock synchronization inquiry.<br>
Devices 92-94 also utilize a specific command set that is used to program the devices and to<br>
query device specific inputs and/or outputs. For example, analog inputs and/or outputs, digital<br>
inputs/outputs or other device specific control or monitor points. One example of devices 92-94<br>
are the programmable temperature control devices commercially available from TCS/Basys<br>
Controls of Middleton, WI, including model numbers SZ1031, SZ1144, SZ2165, or the like.<br>
These controls are particularly applicable to HVAC system control and monitoring. Further<br>
information about these programmable temperature controls, and about TCS/Basys, is available<br>
at website www.tcsbasys.com. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0044] The mechanical structure of the P1810 master unit 68 or 70 is illustrated in FIG. 4. An<br>
antenna 100 is adapted to receive or transmit data from or to NOC 22 in a manner well known in<br>
the art. RF circuitry 102 demodulates received data and modulates data to be sent. Light<br>
emitting diodes (LEDs) 104 indicate the status of the master unit, such as power on, transmitting<br>
or receiving data, and the like. Another set of LEDs 106 indicates the status of other circuits, test<br>
modes and so forth. A battery 108 provides a back-up power supply during temporary power<br>
outages. A real-time clock 110 provides a time reference for the master unit. Power is received<br>
at a terminal block 112. Master unit 68 or 70 has provision for analog inputs at connector 114,<br>
digital inputs/outputs at connector 116 and a master bus at connector 118, such as for hard wiring<br>
to one or more of the remote units 72-78.<br>
[0045] The operation of the P1810 master unit is shown in FIG. 5, and begins at the start block<br>
124. The master unit first determines whether it is registered with the NOC 22 at decision block<br>
126. If not, the registration procedure is initiated at block 128. If the master unit is already<br>
registered, operation proceeds to decision block 130 where it determines if a message has been<br>
received from the NOC 22. If so, the message is processed at block 132. If there is any failure<br>
in processing the message, a communication alarm is sent at block 134.<br>
[0046] If there was no message from the NOC 22 at block 130, the operation proceeds to<br>
determining if it is time to poll the remote units 72-78. If so, the master unit polls the next<br>
remote at block 138. If the polling is successful at block 140, the master unit increments to poll<br>
the next remote unit at block 142. If the polling at block 138 encounters communication<br>
problems, as at block 140, a communications alarm is generated at block 144. If it is not time to<br>
poll at block 136, the master unit determines whether any function needs to be performed at<br>
block 146. The master units 68 or 70 may poll their respective remote units 72-78 as one of the<br>
functions to determine if the remote units are synchronized to GMT; and if not, any of the remote<br>
units 72-78 may correct its time to the GMT time included in the inquiry. If any other functions<br>
are pending, those functions are also executed at block 148. If not, the process goes to decision<br>
block 150 to determine if any alert condition has been received from any remote unit. If so, the<br>
alert condition is transmitted to NOC 22 at block 152. After taking the appropriate actions,<br>
blocks 128,134,148,152, and the "no" branch of decision block 150, all return to the idle state<br>
at start block 124.<br>
[0047] The mechanical configuration of the P1820 remote units 72-78 is shown in FIG. 6. An<br>
antenna 158 receives or transmits data over the transmission links 80-82 from and to the remote<br>
slave units 84-90. RF circuitry 160 demodulates received data and modulates data to be sent In<br>
a manner similar to the P1810 master units 68-70, a connector 162 is provided for the master<br>
bus, a connector 164 is provided for analog inputs, and a connector 166 is provided for digital<br>
inputs/outputs. A plurality of LEDs 168 provide various status indications, including power,<br>
receive/transmit, and the like. A real-time clock 170 provides a time reference for the remote<br>
unit. Power is received at a connector 172.<br>
[0048] The operation of the P1820 remote unit 72-78 is illustrated in FIG. 7. As can be readily<br>
seen, operation of the P1820 remote unit is analogous to the operation of the P1810 master unit,<br>
except that it operates from a different hierarchical level in the system. From the start position of<br>
block 176, the remote unit first determines whether it is registered with its associated master unit<br>
68 or 70 at block 178. If not, the registration procedure is initiated at block 180. If the remote<br>
unit is already registered, operation proceeds to decision block 182 where it. determines if a<br>
message has been received from its associated master unit. If so, the message is processed at<br>
block 184. If there is any failure in processing the message, a communication alarm is sent at<br>
block 186.<br>
[0049] If there was no message from the associated slave unit 68 or 70, the operation proceeds to<br>
determining if it is time to poll a remote slave unit 84-90 at block 188. If so, the next remote<br>
slave unit is polled. If the polling is successful at block 192, the remote unit increments to poll<br>
the next remote slave unit at block 194. If the polling at block 190 encounters any<br>
communication problems, as at block 192, a communications alarm is generated at block 196. If<br>
it is not time to poll at block 188, the remote unit determines whether any function needs to be<br>
performed at block 198. The remote units may poll their respective remote slave units 84-90 as<br>
one of the functions to determine if the remote slave units are synchronized to GMT; and if not,<br>
any of the remote slave units 84-90 may correct its time to the GMT time included in the inquiry.<br>
If any other functions are pending, those functions are also executed at block 200. If not, the<br>
process continues to decision block 202 to determine if any alert condition has been received<br>
from any remote slave unit. If so, the alert condition is transmitted to the associated master unit<br>
at block 204. After taking the appropriate actions, blocks 180, 186, 200, 204, and the "no"<br>
branch of decision block 202, all return to the idle state at start block 176.<br>
[0050] The mechanical configuration of the P1830 remote slave units 84-90 is shown in FIG. 8.<br>
As can be seen by comparison with the mechanical configuration of the P1820 remote unit<br>
shown in FIG. 6, these respective units are quite similar. Thus, the same reference numerals will<br>
be used for similar elements, and the description of these elements will not be repeated here.<br>
[0051] The operation of the P1830 remote slave unit is illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 9.<br>
While there are some similarities to the operation of the remote unit in FIG. 7, there are also<br>
numerous differences. Operation of the remote slave unit 84-90 begins at the start block 210.<br>
The remote slave unit first determines whether it is registered with its associated remote unit at<br>
decision block 212. If not, the registration procedure is initiated at block 214. If the remote<br>
slave unit is already registered, operation proceeds to decision block 216 where it determines if a<br>
message has been received from its associated remote unit. If so, the message is processed at<br>
block 218. If there is any failure in processing the message, a communication alarm is sent at<br>
block 220.<br>
[0052] If there was no message from the associated remote unit at block 216, the operation<br>
proceeds to determining if it is time to poll the next device 92 or 94 at block 224. If the polling<br>
is successful at block 224, the remote slave unit increments to poll the next device at block 228.<br>
If the polling at block 224 encounters communication problems, as at block 226, a<br>
communications alarm is generated at block 230. If it is not time to poll at block 222, the remote<br>
slave unit determines whether it is time to identify any new devices on the system at block 232.<br>
If so, the remote slave unit polls for any new devices at block 234. If new devices are found at<br>
block 236, such new devices are registered on the system at block 238. If it was not time to<br>
identify any new devices at block 232, the remote slave unit determines whether any function<br>
needs to be performed at block 240. The remote slave units 84-90 may poll their respective<br>
devices 92-94 as one of the functions to determine if the devices are synchronized to GMT; and<br>
if not, any of the devices 92-94 may correct its time to the GMT time included in the inquiry. If<br>
any other functions are pending, those functions are also executed at block 242. If not, the<br>
process continues to decision block 244 to determine if any alert condition has been received<br>
from any device 92-94. If so, the alert condition is transmitted to the associated remote unit at<br>
block 246. After taking the appropriate actions, blocks 214, 220, 236, 238, 242, and the "no"<br>
branch of decision block 244, all return to the idle state at start block 210.<br>
[0053] A typical device 92-94 is shown in FIG. 10. Due to the wide variety of applications and<br>
the wide variety of remotely sensed, controlled or monitored conditions of the system 20, devices<br>
92-94 may take on many forms and/or sizes. However, in general, a device bus connector 250<br>
will facilitate interconnection with and communication between each device and an associated<br>
remote slave unit, preferably in accordance with the RS485 industry standard. For example, if<br>
eight-bit addressing is utilized, the remote slave unit 84 can communicate with up to 256 devices<br>
92-94. However, if one of the eight-bit addresses is reserved for an idle mode, such as the<br>
address consisting of all zeros, 255 potential addresses remain. The device may also have an<br>
analog to digital input connector 252 to interface with external sensors such as fox sensing<br>
temperature, pressure, humidity, light intensity, and the like. The device may also have a digital<br>
input/output connector 254 to interface with digital sensors, such as position sensors, relays, and<br>
the like. Logic circuitry 256 will convert analog sensor signals to digital signals. Non-volatile<br>
memory 258 will store the configuration of the device, including its unique address or identity.<br>
External power may be provided at a connector 260.<br>
[0054] The operation of a typical device 92-94 may vary considerably depending upon the<br>
application. However, some common and basic functions are shown in FIG. 11. Operation<br>
begins at start block 266, and proceeds to block 268 to determine if the device is registered with<br>
its associated remote slave unit. If not, registration is initiated at block 270. If the device is<br>
already registered, block 272 determines whether a message has been received from its<br>
associated remote slave unit. If so, the message is processed at block 274. If no message has<br>
been received, block 276 determines whether any function needs to be performed. If so, the<br>
function is executed at block 278. If not, the process continues to block 280 to determine if the<br>
device or its sensors have detected any alert condition. If so, the alert condition is transmitted to<br>
the remote slave unit associated with the device. After taking any appropriate actions, blocks<br>
270, 274, 278, 282, and the "no" branch of decision block 280, all return to the idle state at start<br>
block 266.<br>
[0055J When any alert condition is detected at device 92 or 94, the alert condition is transmitted<br>
from the device to the associated P1830 remote slave unit, which in turn transmits the alert<br>
condition to its associated P1820 remote unit, which in turn transmits the alert condition to its<br>
associated P1810 master unit, which in turn transmits the alert condition to the NOC 22. Any<br>
alert condition is thus daisy-chained from the device that detected the condition to NOC 22.<br>
[0056] While the NOC 22, the master units 68-70, the remote units 72-78 and the remote slave<br>
units 84-90 keep reasonably accurate time, typical devices may or may not be accurate in time.<br>
It is thus important in determining the time of any alert notification to periodically update and<br>
synchronize the time to the GMT time throughout the system 20, including at the devices 92-94.<br>
The NOC 22 is also capable of keeping diurnal time for accurately activating or deactivating<br>
devices 92-94 that are related to sunset and sunrise, such as lighting systems. The NOC also<br>
automatically adjusts for Daylight Savings Time.<br>
[0057] Similarly, devices 92 and 94 register with the P1830 remote slave unit 84, the P1830<br>
remote slave unit 84 registers with the P1820 remote unit 72 and the P1820 remote unit 72<br>
registers with the P1810 master unit 68. All of these registration steps are daisy chained to NOC<br>
22. Of course, the P1810 master unit 68 registered directly with NOC 22. Thus, NOC 22 knows<br>
the architecture of its system and the identity of all components on the system. New components<br>
can be added to the system, or components can be removed from the system, and NOC 22 will be<br>
periodically updated on such changes through the registration subroutines of each component on<br>
the system.<br>
[0058] With the structure and functionality of the remote control and monitoring system 20<br>
considered above, it may now be instructive to consider a typical installation of the remote<br>
portion 66 of the system at a remote site 26. One example is a HVAC system installed at a<br>
shopping center. About 20 to 50 HVAC units may be disposed on the roof of a large shopping<br>
center, with each HVAC unit responsible for controlling the temperature of a particular area or<br>
zone in the shopping center. A device 92 and a remote slave unit 84 will be located at each<br>
HVAC unit to monitor its performance. Each device 92 may have a remotely located<br>
temperature sensor disposed in a respective zone to monitor the interior temperature. One master<br>
unit 68 and one remote unit 72 may be located anywhere that provides effective communication<br>
over the wireless link 80 between the remote unit 72 and the plurality of remote slave units 84 at<br>
each HVAC unit. It can be readily appreciated that this wireless link 80 saves on the significant<br>
expense of hard-wiring the remote unit 72 to the plurality of remote slave units that are scattered<br>
across the roof of the shopping center. Of course, if attempted, any hard-wiring may have to be<br>
in metal conduit with weatherproof fittings to conform to local building codes and electrical<br>
codes. If additional HVAC units are added, or some existing HVAC units are removed, the<br>
system 20 easily accommodates such modifications without the need to change a hard-wired<br>
system.<br>
[0059] While particular embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it will be<br>
obvious to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made therein without<br>
departing from the invention in its broader aspects. Therefore, the aim of the appended claims is<br>
to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the<br>
