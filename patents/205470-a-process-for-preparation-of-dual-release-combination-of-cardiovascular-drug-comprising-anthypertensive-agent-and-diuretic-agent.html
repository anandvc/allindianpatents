Technical Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for dual release of cardiovascular drugs when in combination, wherein one of the active pharmaceutical agents is diuretic in the form of sustained release and the other agent is selective pi blocker in the form of immediate release. Formulation is developed by using any of the technology like multilayer tablet or press coated tablet or drug loading or multirelease granules in capsule.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
ABOUT INDAPAMIDE:<br>
&gt;	Indapamide is the first of a new class of antihypertensive/diuretics, the indolines.<br>
&gt;	Indapamide is a white or almost white powder practically insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol, slightly soluble in ether.<br>
&gt;	Indapamide contains not less than 98.0% and not more than the equivalent of 102.0% of (RS)-chloro-3-sulphamoyl-N-(2_methyl-,3-dihydro-lH-indol-l-yl) benzamide, calculated with reference to anhydrous substance.<br>
&gt;	Its molecular formula is C16H16CIN3O3S and its molecular weight is 365.8.<br>
&gt;	mdapamide is preferentially and reversibly taken up by the erythrocytes in the peripheral blood.<br>
&gt;	Indapamide is an extensively metabolized drug with only about 7% of the total dose administered, recovered in the urine as unchanged drug during the first 48hrs after administration.<br>
&gt;	Thiazide diuretics increase urinary excretion of Sodium and water by inhibiting Sodium reabsorption in the cortical (thick) portion of the ascending limb of Henle's loop and in the early distal tubules. They also increase excretion of chloride, potassium and to a lesser extent, bicarbonate ions.<br>
ABOUT ATENOLOL:<br>
&gt;	Atenolol, a synthetic, Bi- selective (cardio selective) adrenoreceptor blocking agent, maybe chemically described as benzene acetamide, 4-[2y hydroxy -3y - 1 [(1- methyl ethyl) amino] propoxy]- phenyl acetamide.<br>
&gt;	(3-blockers are competitive inhibitors and interfere with the action of stimulating hormones on J3 - adrenergic receptors in the nervous system.<br>
&gt;	Atenolol is soluble in ethanol, sparingly soluble in water, slightly soluble in dichloromethane, practically insoluble in ether.<br>
&gt;	Atenolol contains not less than 99% and not more than 101% of C14H22N2O3 calculated with reference to the dried substance.<br><br><br>
&gt;	Atenolol is white or almost white crystalline powder which is almost odorless<br>
&gt;	Hypertension may be treated with these drugs because of their ability to increase the diameter of the blood to flow less under pressure.<br>
&gt;	Blockage of myocardial pi receptors causes sinoatrial brandycardia, suppression of some ectopic pacemakers, decreased force of myocardial contraction, slowing of atrioventricular conduction and atrioventricular refractoriness<br>
The effect to slow the heart rate increases the duration of diastole and thus increases coronary blood flow to the subendocardial region.<br>
Chinese Patent No. CN 13.94.60.4 to Yan Jie claims a slowly release tablet of Indapamide as a single - ingredient formulation with a core and a coating.<br>
Pharmaceutical composition designed in the form of membrane - covered center containing efficient quantity of Indapamide as active substance is descripted in the Russian Patent No, RU 22.Q1.7.51 .granted to Khim.<br>
UK Patent No. GB 2123293, to Molle Daniel and Labeyrie Etienne provides pharmaceutical compositions and preparations comprising a combination of thiachromans with Indapamide (Equivalent patents).<br>
KoreanJPatent.No, 9507207 to Park Sok-Ryon describes a drug composition for treatment of hypertension comprising a pi-blocking agent as a sympathetic nerve blocking agent, a B.1 -blocking agent, a ACE inhibitor and a diuretic. The pi-blocking agent is selected from acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, nanolol, propranolol, timolol, penputolol, cateolol or pindolol; the al-blocking agent is selected from prazosin, terazosin or doxazosin; the ACE inhibitor is selected from captopril, enalapril, lisinopril or cilazapril; and the diuretic is selected from bendroflumethiazide, hydroflumethiazide, methyclothiazide, polythiazide, trichlormethiazide, chlorthalidone, Indapamide, metolazone, quinethazone or cyclothiazide.<br>
I However, none of the above patents deal with a combination of anti-hvdpertensive and<br>
I diuretic agents wherein one of the drugs namely the diuretic is suitably formulated for<br>
sustained release while the P-blocker antihypertensive agents is incorporated suitably for<br>
immediate release.<br><br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for dual release cardiovascular drug comprising of two active ingredients which are formulated in a single dosage form providing different release profile. The process involves use of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose polymer with polyvinyl pyrrolidon which helps to sustain the release of drug over specific period of time and independent of pH.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The process claimed in present invention comprises formulating in one of the compartment which is the lower layer and which releases the diuretic active agent, Indapamide, over a period of time, ensuring uniform &amp; constant blood levels after absorption and the upper layer which compressed on to the lower layer and which is formulated for immediate release of the (3-blocker, atenolol.<br>
Until now, Indapamide has been orally administered at a dose of 2.5 mg per day by means of an immediate release form .The immediate release formulation leads to; Cmax in just two hours after administration of tablet and these results in the unfavorable hydro electrolytic type or metabolic disturbances. Due to this and in accordance with the international guidelines recommending the use of low doses of antihypertensive agents, new formulation of Indapamide i.e. Indapamide sustained release has-been developed. (P,Clinical Pharmacokinetic, 1999, 37, suppl 1: 13-9) This new formulation eliminates plasma peak, prolongs t max and reduces peak concentration while maintaining minimum concentration. The speed of release must be reproducible and correlated with the blood concentration observed after administration. The new SR formulation which allows reduction in the daily dose of Indapamide from 2.5 to 1.5 mg leads to an improvement in its efficacy or tolerability ratio (Fundamental &amp; Clinical Pharmacology, 2000, 14/2, 139-146). The mechanism employed to control the release of a soluble active principle from the formulation may be by -<br>
1)	Controlling diffusion of drug through polymer or diffusion control of drug release by water soluble or insoluble polymer.<br>
2)	Dissolution control of drug release via dissolution rate &amp; thickness of membrane barrier coat<br>
3)	Dissolution control of drug release by polymer core erosion or   polymer coating erosion<br>
4)	Controlling   the   release   of  drug   due   to   osmotic   pressure   gradient   across semipermeable membrane.<br>
Release of active drug is controlled by embedding drug in matrix of hydrophilic polymers, melted mixture of fat &amp; wax and capillary network of plastic material.<br><br><br>
Hydrophilic polymers utilised for building material are sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl pyrollidone, polyvinyl acetate, carboxy polymethlyne, algenic acid, gelatin &amp; natural *ums.<br>
The matrix is compressed by direct compression of the blend of active ingredients and certain hydrophilic carriers, wet granulation containing the drug and hydrophilic matrix material.<br>
rhe diffusion of drug is through a gel formed after swelling of hydrophilic polymer Drought into contact with dissolving liquid (in vitro) or gastrointestinal fluid ( in vivo).<br>
fhe drug release is controlled by gel diffusion barrier that is formed and / or tablet erosion.<br>
rhe drug is incorporated into fat wax granulation by spray congealing in air, blend congealing in an aqueous media with or without aid of surfactant and spray drying Cechnique. The drug embedded into a melt of fat &amp; waxes is released by leaching and /or hlydrolysis as well as dissolution of fats under the influences of enzymes and pH change in GIT in general; primary constituents of fat wax matrix are fatty acid and fatty esters.<br>
Release through plastic matrix is usually delayed because the dissolved drug has to diffuse through capillary network of compacted particles. Commonly used plastic materials are polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, vinyl acetate /vinyl chloride copolymer, vinylidene chloride, acrylate/methacrylate copolymer, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate.<br>
Plastic matrix tablet, in which the active ingredient is embedded in tablet with coherent ind porous skeletal structure, is easily prepared by direct compression of drug with Mastic material provided the plastic material comminuted or granulated to desired oarticle size to facilitate mixing with drug particle.<br>
rhe matrix tablet described in present invention combines in a novel manner, two polymers of different chemical families, which allows a precisely controlled release of ptive principle.<br>
JI a preferred embodiment of the invention, the finished dosage form is accomplished hrough a drug delivery system suitable for oral administration with an immediate release compartment, which contains a compressed blend of an active agent and one or more jolymers, substantially enveloped by an extended release compartment which contains a compressed blend of the active agent and hydrophilic and hydrophobic constituents and substantially enveloped by an optional immediate release compartment, which provides a lose sufficient to exceed the livers metabolic capacity and to maintain therapeutic levels, preferably throughout a 24hr period.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the active agent in the extended release compartment is diffuse out first, resulting in a first order release rate.<br>
As the active agent &amp; soluble polymers in the extended release compartment disintegrate, water will penetrate through the extended compartment and cause the immediate release compartment to expand; creating a bursting effect that further disrupts any remaining integrity of the extended release compartment.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation of present invention is prepared by press coating technique. It allows the compaction of a dry coating around the tablet core produced on the same machine. The technique is utilized in the present invention as to avoid use of solvent, whether aqueous or organic in nature. Press coated tablet having multiple layer, formed by press coating a core containing a medicinal active ingredient with one or more kind of polymers. Another layer, pressed around the core, containing different medicinal active ingredient. Core of press coated tablet provides sustained release of medicinal active ingredient for a period of 0 to 24 hrs. Other medicinal active ingredient coated on core provides immediate release.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation of present invention is prepared by coating/loading medicinal active ingredient on the core containing another medicinal active ingredient with different kind of polymers that allows sustained release for period of 0 to 24 hrs. Core is in the form of dried granules, nonpareils pellets or drug crystals or tablet. There are a layer between core and coat that works as barrier for the excipient to interfere in the release of both the medicinal active ingredient. A film coat is applied to the core. The final coated particles are filled into two piece hard gelatin capsule or compacted into tablets.<br>
