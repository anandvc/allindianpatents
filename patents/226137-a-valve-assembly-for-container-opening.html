				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a valve assembly comprising a base<br>
body for fitting at an opening which has to be sealed of<br>
container, hose or the equivalent.<br>
BACKBROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It relates to a valve assembly which make, possible the<br>
entry and/or the withdrawal of a liquid, gaseous or powdery of<br>
fluid in or rather out of a container or pouch by meansof a ram<br>
or a needle which may be operated fro, outside which can be<br>
combined with a hose or equivalent through which the fluid can be<br>
supplied or rather drained off. These processes are frequently<br>
automatically controlled and take place on narrowest space. As<br>
per a generic term a valve assembly (WO 90/ 482O3) with a valve<br>
unit is known which is planned outside of a fluid through passage<br>
of the valve assembly. This requires expensive design measures<br>
which complicate the production and fitting of the valve assembly<br>
and are counter productive for minimising of a dimensioning of<br>
the valve assembly. It is further known (WO 48/23972) to plan<br>
instead of a separtely produced component a single piece assembly<br>
in doing so the valve unit is planned further out side of a fluid<br>
through passage in fact the preduction is made easier through the<br><br><br>
single piece design, however the valve assembly does not differ<br>
otherwise from the known previously mentioned two pieces assembly<br>
and over and above that undesired forming burrs can generate<br>
which can impair the sealing function of the valve assembly. For<br>
the state of the art, it is further referred to US - A-3 768501<br>
and 3871 422.<br>
Through the invention in contrast to this a valve assembly<br>
of the type mentioned at he entry with reliable sealing function<br>
are procured, which is robust and lets it minimise design wise<br>
easily . Further the components of the valve assembly will<br>
be produced economically through injection casting and can be<br>
built - up with few steps, preferably automatically to a unit<br>
finished for input.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This assignment is solved through the features of the<br>
invention. The invention allows the preparation of a valve<br>
assembly in which the valve unit can be assembled within the<br>
contour line of the base body as for example of a pipe piece or<br>
weld-in piece and it is not required to leave the location either<br>
in sealing or in release position. This makes possible a design<br>
minimising of the valve assembly under the dimensioning of the<br><br><br>
bora or opening with which the valve assembly will act together<br>
so that it can be used as a usual plug. At tha same time tha<br>
valva assembly is less susceptible to failure against aictarnal<br>
influences than the known assemblies mentioned at the entry since<br>
no projecting parts are present at which at emptying of a<br>
container it's wall parts can put up. The main component of the<br>
valve assembly, namely, their base body and valve unit, represent<br>
plastic shaping parts to be produced economically. Their fitting<br>
can take place in one step, preferably automatically.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Tha invention is axplainad closer following with the help of<br>
an axecution design and the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 in longitudinal section view a valve assembly<br>
as per as ecxecution design of tha invention,<br>
fittad in a pipe to be sealed.<br>
Figure 2 valva assembly as per figure 1 in a view rotated<br>
around 45Â°.<br>
Figura 3 a view of the valve assembly along the line<br>
III-III in Figure 1 in taken away valve unit.<br><br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Though the invention is described followingly in<br>
coobionation with the sealing of a pipe, in which the valve<br>
assembly can be input as per the type of a plug and as for<br>
example can be held sealed through press fit, the invention is<br>
not limited on this use. The valve assembly can be developed much<br>
more also in other way, in particular as weld-in-part for input<br>
in a slit shaped opening of a container out of foil type<br>
material, in doing so it can be combined with the foil material<br>
of the container through welding or in another suitable way as<br>
sealed. The basic design of a weld-in part is known to specialist<br>
so that closer explanations with regard to this are superfluous.<br>
The valve assembly coverst as represented, a pipe shaped<br>
base body 1, which is entered in the pipe 2 as per type of a<br>
plug. The base body 1 is through put from a through passage 3<br>
which extends from an axial end of the base body 1 to it's other<br>
axial end. In the through passage 3 a valve unit 4 is assambled<br>
which covers a central shank area 5 with a decreased radial size<br>
D, which extends between end sided areas 6, 7 thickened in the<br><br>
circumferential dimensions. One thickened area 6 cab have in<br>
cross section a bell - or cup shaped configuration and shows an<br>
extarnal circumferential araa 8, which produce, a first valve<br>
saat. A further internal circumferential araa 9 is planned at a<br>
mouth - or and area 10 of tha basa body 1 near an axial end of<br>
tha through passage 3 and producas a second valva seat. Between<br>
tha valva saats 8, 9 there exist, a sealing ralation when the<br>
valva unit 4 is locatad in it's closing position shown in tha<br>
drawing, in which the through passage 3 is sealad.<br>
Tha oppositely lying other thickened area 7 of the	valve<br>
unit 4 contains a profile recess 11 opening away from the	shank<br>
araa 5, in which a profiled top part 12 of a pipe shaped	1 ram<br>
item 13 can grip in.<br>
Tha ram item 13 can be entered in the through passage 3 by<br>
it's other axial end and can be combined with a pipe or hose (not<br>
shown) through which a fluid can be supplied. At the external<br>
circumference of the ram item 13 a seeling 14 in design as for<br>
example of an O-ring can be assembled which can tread in a<br>
sealing relation with a neighbouring area of tha internal<br>
circumference of the base body 1. In the circumferential wall of<br><br><br>
the ram item 13 near the top piece 12 piar cings 15 are planned,<br>
through which the fluid from the inside, of the ram item 13 can<br>
gat into the tnrough passage 3. The ram item 13 if reoquired can<br>
be brought out from the coupling engagement with the valve unit 4.<br><br>
From the internal circumference of the base body 1 near the<br>
second valva seat 9 a multiple number (presently four) stop arms<br>
In the shown rest - or operating position the stop	aroa 16<br>
and in a close distanca from external circumference 2O	of the<br>
shank area 9 of the valva unit 4, as it is indicated in	19, so<br>
thet batwaan the arms 16 and the valva unit 4 no	touching<br>
16 assambled in same circumferential distance from each other<br>
projects obliquely towards inside and in direction on the<br>
thickened area 7 of the valva unit 4. Tna stop arms 16 hava axial<br>
stop area, 17 with which a ring shaped shoulder area 18 can come<br>
at the thickanad area 7 of tna valva unit 4 in the installation<br>
in ordtr to rastrict an axial movement of the valva unit 4 in<br>
direction on its' a raleasa position in which the first valva seat<br>
8 remains with second valva saat 9 out of saaling ralation. The<br>
axial shifting of the valva unit 4 can take place through it that<br>
the ram item 13 existing in coupling ralation with the valva unit<br>
4 is pushed forward in the through passage 3.<br><br><br>
engagement takes place . The arms 16 are dimensioned so that they<br>
under a force, acting axially on it can taw turned off or rather<br>
can give in from the rest - or operatine position towards<br>
outside. In the rest - or operating position the stop area 16<br>
define a free internal passage 24 with a passage width a, compare<br>
Figure 3.<br>
As further Figure 2 shows at the internal circumference of<br>
the base body 1 a Multiple number of guiding ledges, 21 (prevently<br>
four ledges) can be formed in same circumferential distance from<br>
each extend, which stretch in axial direction and have internal<br>
guiding areas 22, longitudinally to which the thickened area 7 of<br>
the valve unit 4 can be moved. The radial sice D2 of the<br>
external circumference 23 of the thickened area 7 is such that a<br>
minimum free gap to the guiding area 22 of guiding ledges 21 is<br>
maintained and the thickened area 7 experiences then only a<br>
support to the guiding area 22 when the valve unit 4 is brought<br>
out from it's specified axial and radial alignment through<br>
external interference forces.<br>
As it is represented in the diagram, the valve unit 4 is<br>
admitted in it's release - as also in closing position within the<br>
circumferential and axial limitations of the through passage 3 or<br><br>
rather of the base body 1. This ie Made possible through the<br>
elastic stop arm 16 in which these can be positioned bent in<br>
input of the valve unit 4 in the through passage 3 on the part of<br>
it's mouth area 10, so thet the passage width d of the passage 24<br>
is enlarged temporarily such thet the thickened area 7 of the<br>
valva unit 4 can pass the stop arms l6. Thereafter the stop arms<br>
14 spring back in their shown starting position in ordar to sarva<br>
as stops which rastrict the movement of the valva unit 4 in the<br>
ralaasa position and at the same time prevent the valva unit at a<br>
drop out from the through passage.<br>
The closing position, which is defined through the<br>
engagement between the first and second valve seat 8,9 can tread<br>
on valve unit 4 in other suitable way stop re,trictively in<br>
installation with a shoulder 26 at the base body 1 which is<br>
planned near the second valve seat 9.<br>
Though the invention makes possible the full integration	of<br>
the valve unit within the through passage of the base body it	is<br>
not restricted on it. The first and sacond valve seat, could	be<br>
planned also outside of the axial ends of the through passage	in<br><br><br>
which at the valve unit a top flange with a seeled face can be<br>
formed which can tread with a front sided sealed face of the<br>
base body in sealing relation. The sealing relation could alone<br>
be maintained through the effect of a positive pressure in the<br>
container. Instead of four or more stop arms and guiding ledges,<br>
also only one pair of such type step arms and guiding ledges<br>
lying opposite to each other diametrically can be planned. The<br>
base body and the valve unit are, separate plastic shaped parts<br>
from same or different plastic materials preferably produced as<br>
per the injection casting process.<br><br>
