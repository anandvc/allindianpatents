The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
697/MUMNP/2005    <br><br>
The present invention is directed to an improved on-board tool cycle counter for use in a tool for producing parts in a production press.<br>
Background<br>
Production tools such as injection molds, blow molds, casting die or stamping dies, are frequently swapped in and out of a given press or between different presses to accommodate production schedules. As a result, it has been desirable for a tool to have a reliable tool cycle counter associated with it. One approach to such tool cycle counters is found in U.S. Patent No. 5,571,539 issued to D&amp;L Incorporated and co-owned by the assignee of the present application. Such on board counters, that is, counters designed to travel with a tool are to be distinguished from "tooling press" counters which are integrated within the tooling press and typically count the number of parts tooled during a production cycle or the number of times a tooling press has been cycled prior to maintenance on the tool press, or in some cases, are reset to reflect the number of parts produced on a given shift. In contrast, the on board tool   .. counters stay with the tool which, as set forth above, may be periodically switching into and out of a tool press so that a "tool press" cycle count can significantly diverge from the cycle count for individual tools used with a tool press. As the tool may be used in test runs where it is cycled without engaging a "tool press" counter, there are additional opportunities for the "tool press" counter cycle count and on board counter cycle count to significantly differ. From a tool maintenance perspective, it is desirable to have an accurate cycle count which includes all open to closed cycles for a given tool whether for test runs or any other purpose, whether or not they are recorded by a tool press cycle counter. Although the on board counters or tool counters disclosed in the '539 patent function well for their intended purpose, there is still a need for improvements in the current on board counters.<br>
On problem with such counters is that they require a machined pocket within one of the tool portions to receive the counter. The machining of the pocket typically requires a separate machining set up step which takes considerable time and effort and thus incurs additional expense. The machining of such a pocket and securing of the counter to the tool portion requires more time and effort than is desirable. Thus, it is<br><br><br>
on object of the invention to provide an improved on board counter that is easier and less expensive to install and secure than prior counters.<br>
Another problem with current on board counters is the relatively large size and bulk of the current counters. This undesirable bulk leads to another problem for a tool designer or end user. The physical space on the tool is at a premium since a considerable number of tool components, water lines, electrical wiring are arranged throughout the tool, particularly near the parting line. The issue of lack of space is particularly acute on the core portion or half of the tool. For this reason, it has been found that more compact tool counters are desired.<br>
Another problem with the current on board counters is that they are designed for installation in a particular orientation within the tool. If they are installed on an opposing tool portion, in order to have the counter actuator properly configured relative to the tool cavity, the tool count indicia is backward with the "single" digits portion of the indicia located to the left of the "tens" digit portion of the indicia. Thus, there is a need for an on board counter that is orientated for installation in the "cavity" portion of the tool.<br>
Summary<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an improved tool cycle counter is provided which includes a numerical indicia for displaying a stored tool cycle count; a counter assembly for recording the occurrence of a tool cycle, the counter assembly being operably associated with the numerical indicia; and a substantially cylindrical housing enclosing the counter assembly. The cylindrical housing of the present invention allows for a particularly compact on board tool cycle counter design. The cylindrical shape of the housing also provides for simplified installation within a tool portion since the housing can be installed in a bore drilled into the tool portion with the same machining set up as used when the mold's guide pins and bushings are machined, rather than requiring the separate machining set up of the rectangular pocket used with prior tool counters. The installation of the cylindrical counter of this embodiment of the invention typically saves labor costs for the tool manufacturer relative to installation of the prior counter designs. Preferably, the tool cycle counter of the invention includes an actuator which is movable in response to completion of a tool cycle.<br><br><br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, an on board tool cycle counter is provided in which the counter actuator, when installed in the cavity portion of the tool, may be oriented toward the tool cavity with the numerical indicia properly oriented with descending digit places, e.g., hundreds, tens, ones, etc., from left to right. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, an on board tool cycle counter is provided, in which the counter actuator, when installed in the core portion of the tool, may be oriented toward the tool cavity with the numerical indicia properly orientated with digit places of descending order oriented from left to right By providing alternate tool cycle counters with oppositely oriented counter actuators and displays, applicant can ensure that the tool cycle counter can always be installed in the correct orientation in a tool portion. In another aspect of the invention, the cylindrical housing of the counter is designed for use in either the core portion version or cavity portion version of the counter. In this way, the cost of manufacturing the counters is reduced since only a single tooling is necessary to tool the counter housing for both versions.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the counter includes an electronic chip havinga memory device for storing information concerning the operation of the tool. The chip may also preferably include a timer and calendar means for tracking time dependent data that may be used for calculating cycle times and other operational parameters. It may further include a processor programmed to process data stored in the memory device or input data and/or calculate useful operational information from such data. Utilizing these programmable features, the counter can track useful operational information, such as, for example, the cycle time for a particular part, dates on which the tool was in production, part name, part number, tool I.D. number, materials used for a particular part, part counts per run, total part counts for multiple runs, total tool cycles during the tool life, identification of tooling supplier, recommended maintenance schedules, the actual maintenance history of the tool, operational history, count down from last maintenance to next scheduled maintenance, bill of materials, recommended replacement tooling components, cycles remaining before next recommended maintenance, calculating the time period until the next recommended maintenance based on current or historical operation parameters, etc. With the date and time information, as well as the specific parts being run, there may be provided a history with respect to the number of specific parts made<br><br><br>
and the date of their manufacture, as well as their average cycle time or other information so as to provide a better history of the tool operation.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the counter which includes an electronic chip, the counter includes an input and output through which the information may be added to of retrieved from the memory device or processor. Such communication input and output ports may be connectable to a readout device which preferably is a hand-held, readout device. The input and out ports may be physically connected through a detachable wired connection or connected through use of a wireless communication device to the readout device. Alternatively, the ports could be connected to a computer or computer system which could interrogate the counter for a complete readout of that which has been stored in memory or output from the processor. The readout device may also preferably function as an input device which can input information into the memory or the processor, and may be used to reprogram or upgrade the software running the processor or memory device. The read out device may also be toggled between a variety of counting functions that are simultaneously being tracked, for example, total cycles in the tool life, cycle count down from a predetermined count to zero for either scheduled maintenance or a part count, a count,, -up for the current operation, or sum total count of parts made during multiple runs. Alternately, the simultaneous counts may be displayed on an electronic display built into the counter which may be toggled between the various simultaneously tracked counts.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, an improved method of installing a tool cycle counter into a tool plate having a predetermined height and defining at least a portion of the parting line constituting the boundry between the core half and cavity half of the tool. The method including the steps of: forming a substantially cylindrical bore in the tool plate from the side of the plate opposite the parting line; and mounting the substantially cylindrical tool cycle counter within the substantially cylindrical bore. The method may also preferably include the step of matching the height of the counter to the predetermined height of the tool plate and forming an aperature in the exterior side wall of the tool plate through which the counter display may be viewed.<br>
The present invention further includes a method of installing a substantially cylindrical cycle counter within a tool including the steps of measuring a distance<br><br><br>
from an exterior surface of a movable tool portion that is less than the predetermined diameter of the substantially cylindrical tool cycle counter, forming a substantially cylindrical bore in the movable tool portion having a diameter greater than the predetermined diameter of the substantially cylindrical tool cycle counter such that an aperture is formed in the exterior surface of the tool portion; placing the substantially cylindrical tool cycle counter within the substantially cylindrical bore in an orientation in which the count indicia may be viewed through the aperture formed in the exterior surface of the tool portion; and securing the substantially cylindrical counter within the substantially cylindrical bore.<br>

Detailed Description of the Illustrated Embodiment<br>
As shown in the drawings for purposes of illustration, one embodiment of the present invention includes an tool 10 with an improved cycle counter 38, which includes an upper tool half or cavity tool half 11 and a lower tool half or core tool half 12. It should be understood that the counter of the present invention can be mounted in a range of production tools, such as, blow mold, injection molds, casting dies, thermo- forming molds, or stamping dies, to provide a tooling cycle count which travels with the tool. In this instance, the lower tool half 12 is shown in a lowered, open position and is mounted for vertical, reciprocal movement to an upper, closed position on four vertical guide pins 14 which are stationary or fixedly mounted at their upper ends to the upper tool half 11. The lower tool half 12 has guide pin-receiving bushings 15 which slide along the respective posts 14 as the lower tool half is raised and lowered to complete a typical tooling cycle in a tooling press (not shown). The particular tool has an upper sprqe or opening 16 through which the hot, molten plastic may be injected into a cavity in the upper tool half as well as a cavity 19 in the lower tool half which mates with the upper tool cavity to form the part 20. The part 20 is typically ejected by an upward movement of an ejector plate 22, which is mounted for vertical movement on four, vertical, small posts 24. The ejector plate 22 is mounted between the upper, horizontal tool block 26 and a lower, horizontal plate 28. A pair of side plates 30 connect the upper tool block 26 to the lower tool<br><br><br>
plate 28. Manifestly, the tool portions 11 and 12 may come in various sizes and shapes that differ from those illustrated herein. More specifically, some tools for parts having complex shapes may be formed of three or more moving tool portions which define the tool cavity when held in a closed position, rather than being defined by a pair of tool halves as illustrated. The tool halves 11 and 12 are shown in their conventional orientation when the tools are being constructed by a tool maker or being stored. It is to be understood that, in use when installed in a tool press (not shown), the tool is rotated ninety degrees (90°) so that the tooled part falls from the tool cavity by force of gravity after ejection from the tool cavity.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the tool 10 is provided with its own counter 35, which includes an actuator 36 (FIGS. 3-4) to be actuated with each opening and closing movement of the tool when it is in a tooling press. Associated with the actuator 36 is a cycle counter 38 assembly (FIG. 10), which maintains the cycle count in the counter for a prolonged period of time, whether the tool is in the press or out of the press.<br>
The first illustrated counter 35 has a substantially cylindrical housing 45 with a block-shaped extension 46, which forms a tough, closed body or housing for substantially enclosing and protecting the internal components, which in this embodiment are shown in FIGS. 7-10. The counter 35 may be mounted in various manners--that is, attached to the tool in various ways. When, as is preferred, the monitor is built into the tool, such as shown in FIGS. 1 and 19, a cylindrical bore 48 is machined in the tool block 26 from the side of the mold plate opposite the parting line with the housing 45 being received in the pocket. The diameter of the bore 51 is selected and it is located so that when it is machined in the block 26 a small circular aperture 115 is formed in the top surface 55 to accommodate the actuator 36 at the parting line and a side opening 117 is formed in its exterior side 53. The counter actuator 36 extends through vertical opening or bore 51 in the top surface 55 and the extension 46 and display portion 114 extends into the side opening 117 in the exterior side 53. Preferably, after installation, the upper top wall 54 of the monitor is recessed below the top surface 55-of the tool half 26 through aperature 115 (FIGS. 1 and 19) with only the plunger actuator 36 projecting through aperature 115 above the plane of the top surface 55 of the tool block 26. The preferred method of installing the cylindrical counter of the present invention will be discussed in more detail below.<br><br><br>
As the tool block is raised, the plunger actuator is lifted upwardly to abut the underside 57 of the top tool half 11, which is stationary in this instance, although it could be movable. The stationary, lower surface 57 then depresses the plunger actuator 36 to advance the counter assembly 38 for one cycle. Of course, when the tool opens and lowers the top surface 55 of the lower tool half from the undersurface of the top tool half, the plunger 36 is urged by an internal spring to again project above the top wall 54 of the monitor to be ready to be actuated upon the next closing cycle of the tool.<br>
Turning more specifically to the internal portions of the counter 35 and referring to FIGS. 4-11, the counter assembly 38 has a conventional interlocking wheel stroke counter mechanism 102 (FIG. 10) which has been specially adapted f6r use in tool cycle counting. The counter assembly 38 is hermetically sealed in counter housing 45. The counting mechanism 102 registers a count upon sufficient rotation of plunger or stem 110 associated therewith. The stem 110 extends through end plate 112 which defines a top surface 113 of the counter mechanism 102. Upon sufficient rotation of the stem 110, the stroke counter registers a count with the counting mechanism 102 which can be seen on the display 114.<br>
The counter mechanism 102 has a cross bore 116 drilled in the stem 110 at the end 118 of the stem 110 extending out of the counter housing 45 as shown in FIG. 10. It has been found that it is easiest to drill the bore 116 in the stem 110 with the stem 110 depressed so that it is in contact with the back of the counter housing 45. After drilling the cross bore 116, a pin 118 (FIG. 10) is inserted in the bore 116 for engagement by a cam actuator 120. To provide the requisite rotary motion to the stem 118 for registering a count with the counter mechanism 102 as the tool halves 11 and 12 are moved to their are closed position, the cam actuator 120 is spring loaded on the stem 110. Referring to FIGS. 10-11, the cam actuator 120 includes a transverse spring engaging surface 160 intermediate a top cap portion 162 and a bottom pin engaging portion 164 thereof. A central longitudinal bore 166 extends from the bottom of the pin engaging portion 164 to just above the spring engaging portion 160 in the cap portion 162. The central bore 166 can have a length generally corresponding to the length of the stem 110 in its extended state as it projects from the protective housing 104. The spring engaging portion 164 further includes flattened<br><br>
edges 163 which are adapted to engage a pair of legs (not shown) extending radially inwardly from the back half 124 of the housing 45.<br>
A spring 168 is mounted between the top surface 113 of the end plate 112 of the counter mechanism 102 and the spring engaging portion 160 of the cam actuator 120 to continuously bias the cam actuator 120 to its extended state shown in FIG. 10. The top surface 170 of the cap portion 162 is adapted to be engaged so as to push the stem 110 against the bias of the spring 168 into a depressed position while rotating the spring to register a count with the counter mechanism 102, as illustrated in FIG. 10. To do this, the pin engaging portion 164 of the cam actuator 120 includes cam surfaces 172 for engagement with the pin 118 of the stem 110. The cam surfaces 172 form arcuate paths 174 and 176 spaced 180° from each other around the stem all along their paths with the pin portions 178 and 180 extending from either side of the stem 110 traversing respective arcuate paths as the top cap surface 170 is engaged and the cam actuator 120 is depressed. In this manner, the stem is caused to rotate sufficient to register a count with the counter mechanism 102. Thus, with the counter assembly 106 described herein including the cam actuator 120 and the rotatable stem 110 and pin 118, the linear, straight line movement of the tool halves 11 and 12 towards a closed position is converted to a rotary movement of the stem 110 which registers a count in the counter mechanism 102. The change in the count can be seen on the display 114 through window 85 formed in block extension 46 the cylindrical housing 45.<br>
Turning to FIGS 7-9, the counter mechanism 102 includes end plate 112, slidably mounted on stem 110 which passes through a longitudinally extending aperture formed through the interior of numbered wheels 106 and mounting in the central orifice 107 of end cap 109. Fixedly mounted on the stem 110 is spring loaded plate 104 having springing extension 103 dimensioned to engage notches formed in the interior surface of the first of wheel 106 located adjacent of the end plate 112. Rotation of the stem 110 causes the spring extensions of the fixedly mounted spring loaded plate 104 to engage the wheel 106 and rotate to record a cycle count. A series of conventional linkages between the respective wheels cause each to advance on the appropriate count.<br>
The housing 45 of the counter 35 has a two-part construction with front half 122 containing the window 85 and a back half 124 joined thereto. Each of the halves<br><br>
122 and 124 have a first end 126 with a bore dimensioned to receive the plunger 36 and a second end 127 with an end wall 131 having a tongue 123 adapted to receive a groove 111 formed on the end cap 109. Central orifice 107 of end cap 109 receives the stem 110. The grooved rectangular extension 129 of the end cap 109 mates with the tongued rectangular cut-out of the end wall 131 of the window half 122. A<br>
cylindrical slot 125 (not shown, see FIG. 14 for corresponding part 322) formed in the inner periphery of both the window half 122 and back half 124 is dimensioned to receive end plate 112 with stem 110 passing through a central passageway. Legs 121 are spaced apart to receive flattened edges 163 of cam actuator 120.<br>
The internal structure of the protective housing 45 is the same as the structure illustrated in FIGS. 12-15 which shows the left handed or cavity version of the counter 235. The housing 245 of the cavity version 235 of the counter is merely a the housing flipped over with a oppositely oriented counter mechanism having a stem 310 extending from the left side of the counter mechanism 302 when the number wheels are oriented right side up. The numbering convention of the right handed<br>
embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-11 have been maintained with the reference numbers between 1-99 corresponding to numbers between 200-299 and the numbers between 100-199 corresponding to the numbers between 300-399. As shown in FIG. 12, the cavity half counter 235 is designed to be positioned in the stationary, upper half of the tgol to be actuated by the movable, lower half; however, both the upper and lower<br>
tool halves could be movable towards each other. As shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 12-16, in order to view the numerical display in the proper orientation the display and plunger must be orientated as a mirror image of the cavity half embodiment of the counter shown in FIG. 1-11.<br>
The housing 245 of the counter 235 has a two-part construction with front half 322 containing the window 385 and a back half 324 joined thereto. Each of the halves 322 and 324 have a first end 326 with a bore dimensioned to receive the plunger 236 and a second end 327 with an end wall 331 having a tongue 323 adapted to receive a groove 311 formed on the end cap 309. Central orifice 307 of end cap 309 receives the stem 310. The grooved rectangular extension 329 of the end cap 309 mates with the tongued rectangular cut-out of the end wall 331  of the window half 322. A cylindrical slot 325 formed in the inner periphery of both the window half 322 and back half 324 is dimensioned to receive end plate 312 with stem 310 passing through<br><br><br>
a central passageway. Legs 321 are spaced apart to receive flattened edges 363 of cam actuator 320.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, an electronic chip can be mounted in the housing 445. The housing 445 is shown in a core half embodiment in FIGS 17-18. However, it is to be understood that the chip may be mounted in either the cavity version 235 or core version 35 of the counter described above. The chip preferably includes a switch 461 that is actuated when the tool block(not shown) is raised, the plunger actuator 436 is lifted upwardly to abut the underside of the top tool half (not show). The lower surface (not shown) depresses the plunger actuator 436 to close a switch contact 461 (FIG. 17) to cause operation of the counter mechanism 502 for one cycle.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention, the counter display may be a mechanical numerical display as described above or may optionally be an LCD or LED display 477 (See FIG. 17). The use of a mechanical display being preferred in application where battery life is deemed critical by the tool maker since it does not need to draw power to display a cycle count.<br>
The actuator 436 may be the mechanical actuator described above with reference to the prior embodiment or may also be a proximity switch (not shown). Where a proximity switch is used a ferromagnetic body would need to be installed across the parting line from the first end of the counter. When the tool portions are brought into contact, the attractive force of the ferromagnetic would overcome a<br>
biasing force on a movable armature within the switch and cause it to close indicating the completion of a tool cycle. As the tool portions move apart, the biasing force would again open the switch. Such proximity switch actuation of electrical cycle counters is well known in the art.<br>
In the embodiment of the invention where an LCD or LED 477 display is utilized, the display 477 may be toggled between various settings to alternately display multiple counting functions that are being simultaneously tracked and stored in memory.  For example, the total cycles in a tool  life, cycle count down to a predetermined count for scheduled maintenance, part count for a production run, or summary count for multiple production runs may be simultaneously stored in the memory 465 of chip 460. A toggle switch 477 is provided on the exterior of the monitor which may be depressed to access information from memory 465 which is displayed sequentially in response to depressing the toggle switch 477. In this way, a<br><br><br>
default display such as count down to maintenance may be shown on display 477 until the tool operator depressed the toggle switch 477 to sequentially show other stored counts in the memory 465. The use of toggled display is advantageous since the use of multiple displays in a counter undesirably increases energy consumption which can shorten battery life and because the inclusion of multiple displays would require a larger counter and housing. As mentioned above, keeping the size of the counter to a minimum is important because space on the tool at the parting line is at a premium.<br>
The chip 460 is preferably located adjacent to the end plate (not shown) of the counter 435. Of course, when the tool opens and lowers the top surface 455 of the lower tool half from the undersurface of the top tool half, the plunger 436 is urged by an internal spring to again project above the top wall 454 of the counter to be ready to be actuated upon the next closing cycle of the tool. The chip 460 has a memory device 465 which is programmed to stores the current cycle count.<br>
It is preferred that the counter 435 have a number of other functions which are provided by the circuitry of the electronic chip 460. An input device 462 can be utilized to store a part identification number or part into the memory 465 so that each part being run on the tool may be specifically identified. Further, it is preferred that the chip 460 also include'a settable date and'time clock 464 by which the date and the time of day are kept. The date and clock device are particularly useful for retaining the history of operation of the tool in a memory 465. The memory 465 (shown in FIG. 17) is programmed to keep a log of the dates when the tool is in used and also may record the number of cycles to count to number of parts that have been made during each of those production runs. Particularly where the tool is used for just-in-time production, there may be a series of dates stored in memory and a total count of the number of parts made over the time periods when the tool was actually in the press and tooling parts. Whatever the particular arrangement, the date and clock may be used to provide in memory a history of the particular times of usage of the tool.<br>
It is preferred that there be communication input and output ports 470, which can be connected to a readout device which preferably is a hand-held, readout device (not shown) that is commercially available.   Such readout devices preferably is a suitably programmed personal digital assistance or similar hand held device, having communication input and out components, whether wired or wireless, to send and<br><br><br>
receive data from the chip 460. Alternatively, the ports 470 could be connected or be connectabie to a computer or computer system which could interrogate the counter for a complete readout, for specific information, or calculations that which has been stored in memory 465. The readout device is preferably also an input device which can input information into the memory 465 with respect to a particular preventive maintenance operation that have been performed or that are scheduled to be performed in the future so that the tool includes a maintenance history and/or maintenance schedule which may be accessed by the readout device.<br>
In addition, it is preferred that the monitor, as shown in FIG. 17, have an average cycle time circuit or means 475 by which the cycle times are accumulated and then averaged; so that the average cycle time to make and eject a part can be displayed or read out, such as through the ports 470. Alternatively, a separate display may be provided on the counter face to show the average cycle time or display other data stored in memory 465. This may be accomplished by having a toggle switch on the face of the counter 435 that is programmed to display a variety of data when pressed  in  a predetermined  sequence.   For  example,  the memory  465  may  be simultaneously storing a count down from a preset cycle count to a reading or zero indicating that scheduled maintenance is to be performed, the number or parts made in a particular production run, the sum total of parts made in different production runs of the same part, and the total number of tool cycles for the life of the tool. These counts  may  be serially  displayed  on  alternate digital  display (not shown)  by depressing the toggle switch in a predetermined sequence. Further, the memory 465 can be programmed to simultaneously store multiple countdowns or deadlines for schedules maintenance.<br>
Preferably, the monitor not only includes the counter 435, which accumulates the total number of cycles which have occurred, but also includes the maintenance switch means 440 which can be set to a specific number, and when the counter 435 reaches' this specific number set in the maintenance switch means 440, the latter actuates the alarm or indicator 444 to indicate to the press operator that the tool needs to receive preventive maintenance. The maintenance switch means 440 and alarm indicator can be reset either by use of a reset bottom (not shown) on the exterior to the housing 445 or by use of the input device.<br><br><br>

Another preferred aspect of the invention includes improved methods of installing the cylindrical tool cycle counters disclosed herein. In one preferred method of installing the substantially cylindrical counter, the counter is mounted in a plate<br><br><br>
130 defining a portion of the parting line between the mold portions 11 and 12. Although the method is described herein with reference to installation in the core half of the tool, it should be understood that these preferred methods are equally applicable to installation of cavity version of the counter in the cavity half of the tool. As best seen in FIGS. 19 and 20, plate 130 has a top surface or a parting line surface 55 and an opposite surface 134 as well as a front exterior surface 53. The distance between the parting line surface 55 and the opposite surface 134 is defined as the height "P" of the plate side wall as shown in FIG. 19. In this preferred method, the height "C" of the counter, which is defined as the distance between the first end 126 and second end 131, as illustrated in FIG. 5, is selected to be slightly less than the height P of plate 130. It is particularly advantages for the substantially cylindrical bore 51 to be formed in plate 130 from opposite surface 134 and extending upwardly toward the parting line surface 55, but to not reach it. This is so because the.plate 130 may be machined at the same time and using the same "set up" as for machining the guide pins 14 and bushings 15 of the tool. With past counters which were typically installed in rectangular pockets formed in the mold, the tool would need a separate "set up" step to properly orient it formachining the pocket. This process is more costly and cumbersome than desirable.<br>
After the counter 35 is installed within plate 130, it is preferably held in place when the next plate 138 forming the tool is mounted to the core half 26 of the tool portion. Where the tool is made from a single plate or other plates are spaced apart from it, other bore blocking structures may be installed to secure the counter, such a rail or ledge. If it is desirable to leave the lower portion of the bore open, a thread opening (not shown) can be machined into the sidewall of the cylindrical bore 51 and set screw can be installed to hold the counter in place.<br>
Where a mechanical actuator is being used such as in the counter 35 shown in FIGS. 19 &amp; 20, a smaller circular aperature 115 is also formed from opposite surface 134 and is dimensioned to receive the actuator 36 of counter 35. However, if the counter includes a proximity switch, the circular aperature may not be necessary, or in some cases where a less sensitive switch is used, may need to be enlarged to allow more intimate contact between the armature and ferromagnet. When forming the substantially cylindrical bore 51, care should be taken that the bore diameter B, as best shown in FIG. 20, is slightly larger than the counter diameter D, as best seen in<br><br><br>
FIG. 4. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 19 and 20, a side opening 117, is formed in the side wall 53 of tool block 26 which is substantially rectangular in shape and is dimensioned to receive the block extension 46 of counter 35. Preferably, the side opening or aperature 117 is formed by walking a cutting tool to the outside of the plate 130 and engaging surface 53 of plate 130 with the cutting tool. Preferably the aperature 117 formed in the exterior side wall 53 is dimensioned to snugly receive the block portion 46 of the counter 35. In this way, the interior walls 140 defining the aperature 117 can engage the block portion 46 to prevent rotation about the counter's longitudinal axis during operation of the tool in a press. In order to allow a tool maker maximum flexibility, it is desirable that the cylindrical counter of the present invention be manufactured in a variety of counter heights which approximately match commonly used plates heights that define a portion of the parting line of the tool. The manufacture of counters approximately matching the predetermined heights of the most common plate sidewalls can greatly facilitate installation of the counters.<br>
In an installation where the height of the plates defining the parting line are of a non-standard height (not shown), an actuator rod which functions to extend the length of the actuator may be attached. Under these circumstances, the actuator includes a threaded end which is dimensioned to engage a threaded bore formed on the end of the rod. It has been found that providing threaded actuators and actuating rods provides a more stable connection to a counter than had been previously possible with actuators joined by dowel pins and the like. This actuator extension technique may also be used when it is necessary to place the counter away from the parting line in a plate that is at least one plate removed from the parting line. In such an installation, the circular aperature (not shown) is extended through one or more plates to reach the parting line. An appropriate length actuator rod is chosen so that it may-extend above the parting line and be actuated by contact from the opposing tool portion.<br>
While it is preferred that the block extension 46 is flush with the exterior surface 53 of the tool portion, it is to be understood that, in an alternate method of installation described below, the surface of block extension 46A extends past the side 53 A of the exterior of the tool portion. (See FIG. 21). In this method, the diameter D of cylindrical portion of the tool cycle counter (see FIG. 4) is determined. Next, the dimensions of the block extension 46A of the display portion 114A of the counter are<br><br>
determined and a tool is selected for forming a bore 51A diameter substantially equal to or slightly larger than dimension D, locating the boring tool above the tool portion to receive the counter 35A at a position calculated to form an opening 117A in the front exterior side 53 A of the tool portion of sufficient dimensions to accommodate the block extension 46A to the extent that display 114A is visible through me side opening 117A in the side of the tool 53 A.<br>
In accordance with this preferred arrangement, the present invention further includes a method of installing a substantially cylindrical cycle counter within a tool including the steps of measuring the depth DP (FIG. 4) of the block extension 46 of the mould counter 35, measuring a distance from an exterior surface of a tool portion that is substantially equal to DP, measuring the diameter D of the substantially cylindrical portion of the tool cycle counter 35; selecting a substantially cylindrical boring tool having a diameter equal to or greater diameter D, locating, at the parting line, the boring tool a distance T from the side 53 of the block 26, and boring a substantially cylindrical aperture in the tool block 26 having a circular aperture 115 and side opening 119, placing the substantially cylindrical tool cycle counter 35 within the substantially cylindrical bore in an orientation in which the display 114 is   . substantially flush with the exterior side 53 of the block 26. In some case, depending on the relative dimensions of D to DP, it may be necessary to machine the side opening 117 to accommodate the block extension 46. In this way, the end user can ensure that display 114 may be viewed through the opening 117. The cylindrical counter 35 is preferably retained within the cylindrical bore by a snug friction fit and may also be adhered to the block 26 by use of a suitable adhesive. In an another alternate embodiment, the counter 35 can be mounted to the block 26 by screws (not shown) extending through aligned inter-mediate bosses (not shown) and into tapped holes (not shown) formed on the tool.<br><br><br>
