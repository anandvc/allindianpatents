FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a connecting device for the connection of a hose to a fluid-transporting line.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to automotive engineering, but also referring to other applications, it is important again and again that hoses be<br>
connected to lines and connecting nipples of other units, such as, for example, pumps, cooling devices, etc. This is difficult, at<br>
least in those cases in which only extremely minimal design space is available for establishing the connection or for the<br>
connection itself, in particular, in view of minimal space available in longitudinal direction of the hose that is to be connected. On<br>
the other hand, it is actually expected, in automotive engineering, that hose connections be tight and be made to last for a long<br>
time even under adverse conditions, such as corrosive attack, temperature changes and mechanical stress, such as vibrations<br>
and the like. Such connections are, in particular, nipple-to-hose connections that are used to attach connecting nipples to hoses.<br>
Such nipple connections must not be too long in axial direction.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of this, it is the object of the invention to provide a nipple-to-hose connection that can be established by a reliable<br>
process, is tight, is made to last for a long time, and is short.<br>
This object is achieved with the connecting device is accordance with Claim 1:<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventive connecting device comprises a connecting nipple and a compression sleeve which is used to hold the hose to be<br>
connected on the nipple. The connecting nipple is provided with an annular ring which is encompassed by a plastically deformed<br>
connecting area of the compression sleeve. The connecting area secures the compression sleeve on the connecting nipple in a<br>
form-closed manner. As opposed to this, the hose fitting section of the compression sleeve presses the hose against the<br>
peripheral surface of the connecting nipple, thus securing said connecting nipple in a sealed manner.<br>
As a result of the radially inward direction of compression of the connecting area in direct radial alignment relative to the annular<br>
ring, the space required for securing the compression sleeve on the connecting nipple becomes very small. Directly adjoining the<br>
annular ring, the nipple is free toward the outside. For example, the nipple may be provided with an external thread and<br>
screwed into tapped bores. Inasmuch as only the area of the bead is used to fix the compression sleeve in position, the entire<br>
remaining length of the connecting means can be used to fit the hose and to secure said hose on the connecting nipple. In so<br>
doing, even very short connecting nipples can be used to implement seal lengths of more than 20 mm. Furthermore, the<br>
compression of the connecting area with the annular ring effects not only the axial securing of the compression sleeve on the<br>
connecting nipple by a reliable process and in a long-lasting manner, but this compression also contributes to the seal created at<br>
the hose on the nipple.<br>
It is considered advantageous when the connecting area has a wall thickness that is greater than the wall thickness of the hose<br>
fitting section. In so doing, the connecting area forms a highly compact annular component that extends in a tubular manner<br>
away from the hose fitting section. Preferably, the connecting area, when it has not been deformed yet, has an internal annular<br>
shoulder that accommodates the annular ring of the nipple. In so doing, a connecting area configured as an abutment acts, on<br>
the one hand, as the support of the connecting area<br><br>
an the peripheral surface of the nipple, and acts, on the other hand, as an axial stop, and thus as a positioning aid before and<br>
during the subsequent compressing of the connecting area. During the compression, the support of the support section on the<br>
nipple has the effect that the inward-directed forces deform the connecting area in such a manner that the material of the<br>
connecting area flows around the bead without flattening it. This is of particular advantage in the case of thin-walled connecting<br>
nipples, as are usually used in the interest of savings with respect to material and weight, as well as in the interest of the largest<br>
possible dimensions of the end-to-end fluid channel. A nipple is considered thin-walled, when the annular ring used for mounting<br>
is configured as a pipe on the outside of the nipple, as well as a groove on the inside of said nipple. In most cases, this is true<br>
when the radial wall thickness of the nipple is smaller than the axial length of the annular ring.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the connecting area and the annular bead are matched in such a manner that the plastically<br>
deformed area of the connecting area is flush with the bead. With the use of this measure, an optimal axial attachment to the<br>
compression sleeve on the connecting nipple is achieved without requiring installation space on the free connecting side of the<br>
nipple, i.e., on the side facing away from the hose. In addition, the compression can thus be achieved with minimal deformation<br>
forces and by reliable process.<br>
In so doing, the connection between the compression sleeve and the connecting nipple can be achieved in a very simple and, at<br>
the same time, cost-effective manner and by means of a reliable process. For example, the nipple may receive its desired<br>
external profile by means of a rolling process. A cost-effective manufacture is possible. For example, the compression sleeve<br>
may also be manufactured by means of a rolling process. It may have an internal profile that has already been largely adapted<br>
to the annular ring of the nipple. At any rate, considering these embodiments, the compression sleeve is so short that its end<br>
away from the connected hose does not, or at least does not substantially, project beyond the annular ring. In compressed<br>
state, the compression sleeve preferably is flush on its face in a plane which also marks the beginning of the annular ring.<br>
Additional detains of advantageous embodiments of the invention are obvious from the drawings, the description and/or the<br>
subclaims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a connecting device 1 by means of which a hose 2, in particular, a fluid-transporting hose 2, is<br>
connected to an assembly 3, for example, configured as a coolant compressor, an oil-transporting assembly, such<br>
as, for example a hydraulic device or the like. The hose 2 and the assembly 3 enclose a fluid-transporting channel<br>
4. This channel extends through a connecting nipple 5 shown in Figure 2 by itself. The connecting nipple is<br>
designed in a substantially tubular manner and encloses a fluid channel, which extends from the face to its other<br>
face and is not illustrated in detail. On its outside, said connecting nipple has a cylindrical peripheral surface 5<br>
which may also have the form of a truncated cone. In such cases, the angle of taper, however, is rather minimal.<br>
On one end of the cylindrical peripheral surface 6, i.e., the end facing away from the hose, the connecting nipple 5<br>
has an annular ring 7, details of which are obvious from Figure 5. Said annular ring has an essentially arcuate<br>
cross-section and a height H over the peripheral surface 6, which corresponds approximately to the wall thickness D<br>
of the connecting nipple 5. Its length L, measured in longitudinal direction, corresponds preferably to two to three<br>
times the wall thickness. Both flanks of the annular ring 7, together with the peripheral surface 6, subtend an angle<br>
of 30° to 50°, preferably 40°. The annular ring 7 is rounded. Its connection to the cylindrical peripheral surface 6 is<br>
formed by the edges 8, 9 having a radius of curvature R of, for example, 1 mm. The total length of the connecting<br>
area is 25 mm, for example, whereby more than 20 mm are taken up by the section of the peripheral surface 6<br>
located between the annular ring 7 and the free end 11. On the other side of the annular ring 7, the connecting<br>
nipple 5 may continue as a straight pipe, as is shown by figure 4, for example, or said connecting nipple may be<br>
provided with an external thread 12, for example, in order to be screwed into a tapped bore. The thread 12 may<br>
extend up to the annular ring 7. It is also possible to provide an annular shoulder 14, as is indicated in Figure 2.<br>
A compression sleeve 15 that holds the hose 2 tightly on the connecting nipple 5 is used to mount the hose 2 to the<br>
connecting nipple 5. To do so, the compression sleeve 15 is appropriately deformed, as will be explained later in<br>
detail. The not deformed compression sleeve is shown in Figures 2, 3 and 6 (in detail). As is particularly obvious<br>
from Figure 2, the compression sleeve 15 has an annular connecting area 16, from which extends a pipe-shaped<br>
hose fitting section 17. The hose fitting section 17 is designed as a hollow cylinder and has an inside diameter<br>
which substantially matches the outside diameter of the hose 2. The wall thickness of the hose fitting section 17 is<br>
distinctly smaller than the connecting area 16. On the outside, the not deformed compression sleeve 15 is designed<br>
in a cylindrical manner, i.e., the connecting area 16 and the hose fitting section 17 have the same outside diameter.<br>
At the transition between the connecting area 16 and the hose fitting section 17, a support section 18 is provided,<br>
said support section, together with the hose fitting section, defining an annular shoulder 19. This annular shoulder<br>
is used for the end-face abutment of the hose 2. The support section 18 extends as a radially inward-directed<br>
annular rib up to a narrow cylindrical annular surface 21 having a diameter which substantially matches the<br><br>
 diameter of the peripheral surface 6. The annular surface 21 is one dimension of play greater than the peripheral<br>
surface 6, so that the compression sleeve 15 can be easily slipped onto the connecting nipple 5.<br>
As is obvious, in particular, from Figure 6, adjoining the annular surface 21 is a slanted face 22 forming a chamfer.<br>
Consequently, this chamfer forms a chamfered shoulder toward the cylindrical internal face 23 of the connecting<br>
area 16. The internal face 23 has a chamfer 24 adjoining the axial end face of the connecting area 16. The length<br>
of the internal face 23 in axial direction corresponds approximately to the length L of the annular ring 7. The inside<br>
diameter 23 matches the largest outside diameter of the annular ring 7.<br>
The hose connection is established with the connecting nipple 5 and the compression sleeve 15 as follows:<br>
In order to establish the connection, the hose 2, the compression sleeve 15 and the connecting nipple 5, as<br>
shown by Figure 2, are first slid together, as is obvious from Figure 3. In so doing, the hose 2 is already seated<br>
somewhat tightly on the peripheral surface 6 of the connecting nipple 5. Its face abuts against the annular<br>
shoulder 19. The support section 18 abuts against the annular ring 7. The inside face of the hose fitting section 17<br>
abuts against the outside of the hose 2 or displays minimal play with respect thereto. The internal face 23 abuts<br>
with minimal play against the annular ring 7 and extends beyond said annular ring.<br>
Now, a compression tool, such as, for example a jointing clamp, or a revolving compression tool moving rollers on<br>
an orbital path about the compression sleeve 15 and, in so doing, exerting inward pressure, is used to cause a<br>
radial deformation of the compression sleeve 15. In so doing, the hose fitting section 17, as well as the connecting<br>
area 16, is plastically deformed in radially inward direction. In so doing, the hose fitting section 17 is pressed<br>
inward, specifically in at least one and preferably more, annular zones 26, 27. As a result of this, the hose fitting<br>
section 17 is imparted with a wavy shape in longitudinal section. Consequently, as is obvious from Figure 7, in<br>
particular, the hose 2 is pressed tightly against the peripheral surface 6 of the connecting nipple 5, thereby<br>
achieving fluid-tightness.<br>
During the deformation of the connecting area 16, in particular, the section being in radial alignment with the<br>
annular ring 7 is pressed radially inward, in which case the external circumference of the connecting area 16<br>
remains substantially cylindrical. The support section 18 is not deformed radially inward. In so doing, the annular<br>
face 21, however, is still pressed slightly inward and thus comes into tight contact with the peripheral surface 6 of<br>
the connecting nipple 5. The remaining material of the connecting area 16 flows around the annular ring 7,<br>
enclosing it in a form-closed manner. In so doing, the plastic deformation of the connecting area 16 is relatively<br>
minimal. During the deformation, the face 25 is - and remains - at one height with the edge 8 and thus is flush<br>
with the annular ring 7. In so doing, after the completed deformation, the connecting area 16 forms an edge 28, on<br>
which the area of the face 25 in abutment with the annular ring 7 subtends an acute angle of 50°, for example.<br>
Due to the support of the connecting area over the support section 18 on the connecting nipple 5, a flattening of<br>
the annular ring 7 is avoided during the plastic deformation of the connecting area 18. Rather, the material of the<br>
connecting area 16 abuts in a flat manner against the annular ring 7 and flows around annular ring. Thus, a tight<br>
seal and an axially form-closed securing of the compression sleeve 15 and the hose 2 on or at the connecting<br>
nipple 5 is achieved.<br><br>
Above, the inventive connecting device 1 has been described with respect to a screw nipple. However, as already<br>
mentioned, the compression sleeve 15 can also be used for affixing the hose 2 to a pipe provided with an annular<br>
ring 7, as is obvious from Figure 4. Referring to the embodiment shown in Figure 4, the above descriptions use<br>
the same reference numbers and are applicable accordingly.<br>
A connecting device 1, consisting of a connecting nipple 5 with an annular ring 7 and a compression sleeve 15,<br>
has a particularly short design, in that the compression sleeve 15 has a connecting area 16 having a substantially<br>
square cross-section, whereby said connecting area 16 is pressed onto the annular ring 7. In so doing, the<br>
connecting area 16 ensures the axial attachment of the compression sleeve to the connecting nipple 5. The latter<br>
encloses and extends beyond the annular ring 7. However, it does not engage behind it, i.e., it does not have a<br>
section extending beyond the annular ring 7. As a result of this, the connecting device 1 is particular short in axial<br>
direction and makes a long sealing length possible. The total length of the connecting device 1 is exclusively<br>
defined by the length of the peripheral surface 6 that is used to provide the seal with respect to the axial length of<br>
the annular ring 7. No additional space for sections extending potentially behind the annular ring 7 is required.<br><br>
