Process for Preparation of g-Hydroxvcarboxylic Acid Amides<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of a-hydroxycarboxylic acid amides which are valuable intermediates for the production of fungicidally active compounds. The present invention further relates to novel intermediates used in the process according to the invention.<br>
The a-hydroxycarboxylic acid amides which can be produced by the process according to the present invention may be used as intermediates for fungicidally active phenyl-propargylether derivatives which are described, for example, in WO 01/87822. These fungicidally active phenyl-propargylether derivatives correspond to the formula la<br><br>
wherein<br>
Ri is hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyi or optionally substituted aryl,<br>
Ri and Rm are each independently hydrogen or alkyl,<br>
Rive is alkyl,<br>
Rg, Rive. Rio, and Rvm are each independently hydrogen or alkyl,<br>
Rick is hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl or optionally<br>
substituted alkynyl,<br>
Rx is optionally substituted aryl or optionally substituted heteroaryl, and<br>
Z is halogen, optionally substituted aryloxy, optionally substituted alkoxy, optionally<br>
substituted alkenyloxy, optionally substituted alkynyloxy, optionally substituted arylthio,<br>
optionally substituted alkylthio, optionally substituted alkenylthio, optionally substituted<br>
alkynyl thio, optionally substituted alkylsulfinyl, optionally substituted alkenylsulfinyl,,<br>
optionally substituted alkynylsulfinyl, optionally substituted alkylsulfonyl, optionally<br>
substituted alkenylsulfonyl or optionally substituted alkynylsulfonyl,<br>
including the optical isomers thereof and mixtures of such isomers.<br>
In WO 01/87822 a variety of methods for the preparation of the compounds of the above formula la have been described with reference to reaction schemes 1 to 4 a which are briefly discussed below.<br><br><br>
This reaction scheme comprises two altemative methods. According to the first alternative an acid of formula (1) or a carboxy-activated derivative of an acid of formula (1) is reacted with an amine of formula (2) to obtain a carboxylic acid amide of the formula (3), which is further reacted with a compound of the formula (4) to form a compound of the formula I. Alternatively, an amine of the formula (5) is reacted with an acid of the formula (2) to obtain a compound of the formula 1. The two alternatives are based on the same types of reaction and are only distinguished by the order of the reaction steps involved.<br><br><br>
According to this scheme compounds of subformula la are prepared starting from N-formyl-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylamine (6) which is etherified with compound (4) to compound (7) the N-formyl group of which is converted into a isonitrile group as shown in compound (8). Isonitrile (8) is reacted with ketone (9) in the presence of acid (10) to a-hydroxy acid ester (11) which is hydrolysed to a'hydroxyacid amide (12), which compound can also be obtained directly from isO nitrile (8) or from N-formyl compound (7) by reaction with ketone (9). The a-hydroxylase amide (12) is then reacted with compound (13) to form the compound of the subformula la which compound can alternatively be obtained by reacting either compound (15) or compound (15a) with hydroxy-compound (14).<br><br><br>
According to this method a dioxolanone (16) which can be obtained by reacting the corresponding a-hydroxyacid with acetone in the presence of a strong acid is alkylated to form a dioxolanone (17) or the corresponding a-hydroxyacid (18) is then reacted with substituted 2-phenylethylamine (5) to obtain a compound (12).<br><br>
According to this method a a-hydroxyacid (18a), which can be obtained either by chlorinating a ketone (19) in acetic acid and hydrolyzing the a, -dichloroketone (20) or by transforming an aldehyde (21) into the corresponding cyanohydrins (22) and hydrolyzing of the •<br><br>
latter, is reacted with a ketone (23) to form a dioxolanone (16a). The dioxolanone (16a) thus obtained is then reacted with a 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylamine (24) to obtain carboxylic acid amide (25) which is di-etherified with compound (26) to obtain a compound of the subformula lb.<br>
In view of the excellent fungicidal activity of the phenyi-propargyiether derivatives of the above formula la there exists a need for a process for their preparation which is suitable to be performed on an industrial scale. Since the processes contemplated in the hitherto unpublished co-pending international application PCT/EP01/05530 are not satisfactory for that purpose it is the object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of intermediates which can be easily transformed into the phenyl-propargylether derivatives of the above formula la.<br>
According to the present invention it is suggested to prepare 2-phenyl-2-hydroxy-N-[2-(3-alkoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-acetamide of the formula I<br><br>
wherein Ri , R2 and R3 are as defined above with a a-hydoxycarboxylic acid ester of the formula III or a dioxolanone of the formula Ilia<br><br><br>
wherein R4 is as defined above, and R5, Re and R7 independently of each other are lower alkyl.<br>
According to a one embodiment the process is carried out in the absence of a solvent at a temperature at or above the melting temperature of the reaction mixture. The process according to the present invention is advantageously carried out by intimately mixing a 2-(3-alkoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylamine of the formula II with a a-hydroxycarboxylic acid ester of the formula III and heating the mixture to a temperature within the range from the melting temperature of the reaction mixture and a temperature of up to +100°C above the melting temperature of the reaction mixture. Preferably the reaction is carried out at a temperature within the range of from the melting temperature and a temperature of -i-50°C above the melting temperature of the reaction mixture, and most preferably at a temperature of from the melting temperature and a temperature of +20°C above the melting temperature of the reaction mixture.<br>
The a-hydroxycarboxylic acid ester of the formula III or Ilia and the 2-(3-alkoxy-4-hy-droxyphenyl)-ethylamine of the formula II may be used in a molar ratio of from 1 : 2, preferably 1 : 1,2. Most preferably the a-hydroxycarboxylic acid ester of the formula III and the 2-(3-alkoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylamine of the formula II are used in equimolar amount. According to a preferred embodiment the reaction of a 2-(3-alkoxy-4-hydroxyphe-nyl)-ethylamine of the formula II in the absence of a solvent to a 2-aryl-2-hydroxy-N-[2-(3-alkoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-acetamide is carried out with an a-hydroxycarboxylic acid ester of the formula 111.<br>
As a rule the reaction can be carried out in the absence of a catalyst. However, if acidic impurities are present, such as traces of the carboxylic acid of the ester used, a base can be advantageously added to the reaction mixture in order to complete the reaction. Suitable bases are, for example, tertiary amines, such as triethylamine.<br>
As a rule the molten product obtained by the process according to the present invention can be immediately used for the further conversion into a compound of the formula la. If necessary, the molten product can be dissolved in an organic solvent and purified by crystallization and/or extraction. Further, it is possible, to dissolve the product in an aqueous base,<br><br>
such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, and further reacting the corresponding phenolate salt formed in a two-phase system in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. In comparison to the previously described process in which a solvent is used, the process according to the invention is advantageous in that a considerably shorter reaction time is needed. Further, the yield per volume of the process according to the invention is higher than in the previously described process and the conversion to the desired a-hydroxycar-boxylic acid amide of the formula I is practically quantitative.<br>
According to another embodiment the reaction of a 2-(3-alkoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)- ethyl-amine of the formula II with a a-hydroxycarboxylic acid ester of the formula III or Ilia is carried out in the presence of an inert solvent and in the presence of an organic or inorganic base at a temperature within the range of from -SOX to +200°C. Suitable solvents are, for example, aromatic and aliphatic or halogenated optionally haloge-nated hydrocarbons, ethers, alcohols and nitriles. Especially suitable solvents are chlorohy-drocarbons, such as dichloromethane or chlorobenzene, hydrocarbons, such as n-hexane, cyclohexane or toluene, ethers, such as diethyl ether, tert-butyl-methyl ether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or sec-butanol. Mixtures of the afore-mentioned solvents can also be used.<br>
Suitable organic bases are, for example, triethylamine, N,N-isopropyl-ethylamine, pyridine, N-ethylpiperidine and N-methylmorpholine. Examples for suitable inorganic bases are sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate.<br>
Within the temperature range of from -80X to +200°C the range of 0°C to +140°C is preferred.<br>
The reaction of a 2-(3-alkoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)- ethylamine of the formula II to a 2-aryl-2-hy-<br>
dory -N-[2-(3-alkoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-acetamide of the formula I in the presence of<br>
an inert solvent is preferably carried out with a dioxolanone compound of the formula Ilia.<br>
The dioxolanones of the formula Ilia are novel compounds and are, therefore, also a part of<br>
the present inventive concept.	|<br>
The dioxolanones of the formula Ilia may be obtained by reacting an a-hydroxyacid of the formula IV<br><br>
wherein R4 is as defined for formula I, in the presence of a strong acid with a ketone of the formula V<br><br><br>
wherein R5 and Re are each independently of each other lower alkyl. Suitable strong acids are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, benzene sulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid, and nitric acid, with sulfuric acid being preferred. Lower alkyl groups R5 and Re contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferably R5 and Re represent methyl or ethyl and most preferably methyl.<br>
In the above definition of the formula I aryl includes aromatic hydrocarbon rings like phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl and biphenyl like 1,3-biphenyl and 1,4-biphenyl, with phenyl being preferred. The same definition applies where aryl is part of aryloxy or arylthio.

‘H-NMR (de-DMSO) d(ppm): 2.3 - 2.4 (m, 2H together with DMSO); 2.5 (t, 2H); 2.5 - 3.6 (broad, 3H together with H2O); 3.5 (s, 3H); 6.2 - 6.5 (m, 3H).<br><br>
A solution of sodium cyanide (10.2 g) in water (50 ml) is added to a mixture of vanillin (15.5 g) and methanol (30 ml) at O’C. Concentrated hydrochloric acid (28.5 g 32%) is introduced<br><br>
at 0°C to+5°C within 30 to 45 minutes. After confirming that the conversion has proceeded to a satisfactory level by HPLC, the mixture is extracted with t-butyl methyl ether (100 ml). After aqueous layer is drained, the organic phase is washed twice with 10% aqueous bisulfate (50 ml) and once with water (40 ml). The obtained crude cyanohydrin-solution is dried over sodium sulfate right after work-up. Most of the solvent is removed in vacuum and the remainder is dissolved in anhydrous, acidified methanol (50 ml). The ethanolic solution is added to a mixture of 10% palladium on charcoal 11.4g), anhydrous methanol (100 ml) and concentrated sulfuric acid (13.0 g) over a period of 1 hour at room temperature, while the mixture is kept under a pressurized hydrogen atmosphere. Hydrogen addition is continued for 3 hour at room temperature. After water (80 mi) is added, the catalyst is removed by filtration, and most of the methanol is removed by distillation. During the adjustment of the pH of the obtained solution to 10.5, the amino phenol precipitates as a sticky semisolid, which slowly crystallized on further stirring at room temperature. The crystallized product is isolated by filtration. The retained light yellow crystals are dried in vacuum (m.p. 156-158°C). ‘H-NMR (de-DMSO) d(ppm): 2.3 - 2.4 (m, 2H / DMSO); 2.5 (t, 2H); 2.5 - 3.6 (broad, 3H / H2O); 3.5 (s, 3H); 6.2 - 6.6 (m, 3H).<br><br>
Method A:	A 80 % solution of properly bromide in toluene (39,1 g, 0,263 mol) is<br>
added slowly at room temperature to a mixture of 2-(4-chloro-phenyl)-2-hydroxy-N-[2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-acetamide (35.25 g, 0,105 mol), 30 % sodium hydroxide solution (52,4 ml, 0,524 mmol) and tetrabutylammonium bromide (1,8 g) in 180 ml of dichloroethane. The reaction mixture is stirred for 16 hours at +40°C. Subsequently the mixture is evaporated and the residue is diluted with water (100 ml) and dichloroethane (100 ml). The organic phase is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with dichloroethane. The combined organic phases are washed with brine (150 ml), dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated. The remaining oil is purified by chromatography on silica<br><br>
gel (ethyl acetate / hexane 1 : 1) to yield 2-(4-chlcro-phenyl)-N-[2-(3-methoxy-4-prop-2-ynyloxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-2-prop-2-ynyloxy-acetamide.  m.p. 90 - 92°C. ‘H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCI3): 2.42(t, 1H), 2.47(t, IH), 2.74 (t, 2H), 3.50(1, 2H), 3.79(s, 3H), 3.91 (dd, 1H, 4.14(dd, 1H), 4.69(d, 2H), 4.91 (s. IH1, 6.62 -7.29(m, 7H).<br>
Method B:<br>
A mixture of 2-(4-chloro-phenyl)-2-hydroxy-N-[2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-acetamide (5.6 g), 30% potassium hydroxide solution (5.6 g), methyl-tributylammonium chloride (0.43 g) and water (9.7 g) is stirred at roan temperature. Methanesulfonic acid prop-2-ynyl ester (10 g) is added dropwise over a period of 2 hours, and stirring is continued at room temperature for further 4 hours. The mixture is allowed to separate and the aqueous phase is discarded. To the remaining organic phase a 30% potassium hydroxide solution (2.8 g), methyl-tributylammonium chloride (0.3 g) and water (2.8 g) are added and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature. During 1 hour the methanesulfonic acid prop-2-ynyl ester (5 g) is added. Stirring is continued for 18 hours at room temperature for 18 hours before the triethylamine (1.1 g) is added and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for another 30 minutes. Toluene (10 g) is added and the mixture is allowed to s separate. After discarding the aqueous phase the organic phase is washed with 15% hydrochloric acid. Then 10 g of acetone are added to the organic phase and it is washed with a 8.7% sodium hydrogen carbonate solution ‘3 g). The organic phase is collected and the solvent is evaporated, yielding the desired 2-{4-chloro-phenyl)-N-[2-(3-methoxy-4-prop-2-ynyloxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-2-prop-2-ynyloxy-acetamide, which exhibits identical physic-chemical data as the product prepared by Method A is obtained.<br><br><br><br><br>
