				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The subject of the present invention is a new stable formulation, in the form of sustained-release microgranules containing Ginkgo Biloba extract as well as the process for preparing it.<br>
More precisely, the present invention relates to microgranules in the form of a core containing Ginkgo Biloba extract with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, an intermediate layer coating said core, and an outer layer, which enables sustained release of Ginkgo Biloba from the core.<br>
Ginkgo Biloba extract contains flavone glycosides (flavonoids), such as quercetin, kaemferol, isorhamnetin and terpenes (heterosides) such as Bilobadide, ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, ginkgolide C, ginkgolide J.<br>
Flavonoids are known to have anti Platelet-activiting Factor properties, thus terpenes have corticoid-like, anti-ischaemic properties and are known to be antagonists of peripherical benzodiapine receptors, inducing anti stress activity.<br>
Powders extracted from plant substances are usually very hygroscopic and they therefore pump moisture from the granules and from the gelatin capsule, which become brittle. This leads to poor stability properties.<br>
Plant extracts have poor flowability and compressibility properties. Thus, formulation of such extracts in the form of sustained release tablets is not possible, as it requires homogeneous mixtures of<br><br>
extracts  with  pharmaceutical  excipients  during  all compression steps.<br>
WO 00/69414 relates to granules containing at least one plant substance, characterized in that they each comprise a neutral core, which has a grain size of. between 200 and 4 000 µm and which is coated with a layer containing the plants substance, combined with a pliarmaceutically suitable excipient.<br>
The multiparticulate form of the invention maikes it possible to obtain a stable and reproducible sustained release multiparticulate dosage form comprising Ginkgo Biloba extract, with the advantage of boing stable during storage, particularly in accelerated storage conditions, defined in ICH as 40°C for temperature and 75% for relative humidity.<br>
According to the present invention, the sustained release micx'ogranules contain a Ginkgo Biloba extract, characteriaed by the release of total flavone glycosides having the following profile of dissolution rates, measured at 37.0°C + 0.5°C/ with a Dissolution Test Apparatus I (Basket method at 100 rpm, 900 mL of purified water, UV Detection : 272 nm) :<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
More specifically, the sustained release microganules are characterized by the following prrofile ;<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
These granules containing Ginkgo Biloba extract are further characterized in that they comprise :<br>
a neutral core coated with a. layer containing<br>
Ginkgo  Biloba   extract,   with  at   least  one<br>
pnartnaceutically acceptable excipient,<br>
an optionnal water-repellent layer,  coating said<br>
core,   comprising  at  least  a  polymer  or  a<br>
thermoplastic excipient,<br>
an outer polymeric layer which sustain the release<br>
of said extract from the active core.<br>
Ginkgo Biloba extract may be in a concentrated preparation which are liquid, solid or of intermediate consistency, generally obtained from dried plant raw materials, preferably leaves, or in a powder-form.<br>
Fluid extracts are liquid preparations of which, in general, a pox Lion by mass or by volume corresponds to a portion by mass of dried raw material. These preparations are adjusted, if necessary, so as to meet the requirements of content of solvents, of constituents or of dry residue.<br>
Soft extracts are preparations having an intermediate coneialency between fluid extracts and dry extracts. Soft extracts are prepared by partial evaporation of the solvent which served for their preparation. Only ethanol at an appropriate title or water is used. Soft extracts have in general a dry<br><br>
residue which is not less than 70 per cent by weight. They may contain appropriate antimicrobial preservatives.<br>
Dry extracts are solid preparations obtained by evaporation of the solvent which served for their production. Dry extracts have in general a dx-y residue which  is  not  less  than  95  per  cent  by  weight . Appropriate inert substances may be added.<br>
The plant powders are obtained from whole plants or fragmented or cut plant portions, used as they are, in desiccated form.<br>
Ginkgo Biloba extracts contain up to 40% by weight of flavonoids, and up 10% by weight of terpenes.<br>
Preferred Ginkgo Biloba extracts contain 24% by weight of flavonoids and 6% by weight of terpenes.<br>
The neutral core consists of a substance? chosen, from sugar, starch, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, cellulose, talc and mixtures thereof.<br>
The neutral core may also consist of a starch/sucrose core in 80/20 mass ratios which as coated with 80% by weight of starch. In such neutral cores, the proportion by mass of sugar is advantageously less than 20%.<br>
The layer containing the Ginkgo Biloba extract contains at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, selected from the group comprising a binder, an antistatic agent or a lubricant, preferably a binder.<br>
The binder is selected from the group consisting of cellulosic polymers, such as ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, acrylic polymers, such as insoluble acrylate ammoniomethacrylate copolymer, polyacrylate as polyroethacrylic copolymer, povidones,<br><br>
copovidones, polyvinylalcohols, shellac, alginic acid, sodium alginate, starch, pregelatinized starch, sucrose and its derivatives, guar gum, polyethylene glycol, preferably polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or shellac.<br>
The binder is used in proportions of at most about 50%, preferably at most 20% by weight of Ginko Biloba extract.<br>
The antistatic agent, which can be used as flow aid, is selected from the group consisting of micronised or non micronised talc, fumed silica {Aerosila R972), colloidal silica (Aerosil®200), precipitated silica (Sylold® FP244) and mixtures thereof.<br>
The antistatic agent is used in proportions of at most 5%, preferably 2% by weight relative to the weight of said granules of GB extract.<br>
The  lubricant  is  selected  from  the  group<br>
consisting of magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium<br>
stearyl   fumarate,   micronised  polyoxyethyleneglycol<br>
(micronised Macrogol  6000),  ieukine,  sodium benzoate<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of lubricant is from 0 to 3 %, preferably from 1 to 2 % by weight, based on the weight of the granules.<br>
In order to prevent sticking between granules, mainly due to Ginkgo Biloba extract, it is necessary to optionally appiy an intermediate layer between the active layer- comprising the Ginkgo Biloba extract and the polymeric layer ensuring sustained release of said extract.<br>
Said intermediate water-repellent layer-comprises at least a polymer or a thermoplastic excipient.<br><br>
Microgranules can be manufactured by a number of different processes, for example extrusion-spheronisationf fluid air bed process or a coating-pan<br>
method.<br>
Extrusion-Spheronization is suitable for pellets with high content of active substance, but need more equipment.<br>
For the manufacture of the granules of the invention, the coating-pan method is preferred, as it requires only simple equipment and operation.<br>
Good sphericity and appropriate size of microgranule benefit to control drug release by coat ing film and to achieve good stability of the finished product.<br>
The process for the preparation of sustained-release microgranulea containing Ginkgo Biloba extract comprises the successive steps consisting in;<br>
Applying over a neutral core, a layer comprising Ginkgo Biloba extract, and at least one pnarmaceutical excipient, preferably a binder. Coating said core with an intermediate; Layer over the thus obtained granules by spraying thereon a suspension, or a solution comprising a polymer or a thermoplastic excipient<br>
Coating the thus coated granules with an outer layer by spraying a suspension, a. dispersion or a solution of a sustained-release coating composition, Drying the thus obtained coated granules.<br>
In this process, all stepa can be performed in different or in the same equipment, each step being performed in the presence of a mixture of excipients which are identical or different.<br><br>
The prepared coating liquid is either water-based or prepared using organic solvents, preferably isopropylic alcohol. According to an advantageous embodiment, this coating liquid is suitable to be sprayed with conventional spray layering equipment, as for example a coating pan or a fluidized air bed equipped with a top insert or bottom (wurster) insert .<br>
According to the process of the invention, the cores are obtained by powder-coat ing, advantageously carried out by alternately spraying an alcoholic or aqueous-alcoholic solution comprising at least one pharmaceutical excipient, preferably a binder, and the Ginkgo Biloba extract.<br>
The granules according to the invention are prepared according to coating techniques known .in the art, preferably in a pan or in a fluidized air bed.<br>
