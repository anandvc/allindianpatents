				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a polyester resin<br>
composition, a method for its production and a molded<br>
product made thereof. More particularly, it relates to<br>
a polyester resin composition whereby formation of a<br>
cyclic trimer as a byproduct during melt molding is<br>
little and soiling or the like of the mold during the<br>
molding is little, a method for its production and a<br>
molded product thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Heretofore, a polyester resin such as polyethylene<br>
terephthalate has been used for various applications,<br>
e.g. for films, sheets or bottles, since it is<br>
excellent in various physical properties such as<br>
mechanical strength, transparency, electrical<br>
characteristics and thermal properties. Especially, its<br>
application to containers for beverage products such as<br>
carbonated beverages, fruit juice beverages or various<br>
other beverages, has been expanding.<br>
Such a polyester resin is produced by using a<br>
terephthalic acid component and an ethylene glycol<br>
component as the main components, and subjecting these<br>
components to an esterification reaction or an ester<br>
exchange reaction, followed by melt polycondensation<br><br>
and, if necessary, solid phase polycondensation. At<br>
that time, an antimony compound is widely used as a<br>
polycondensation catalyst.<br>
However, the antimony compound is likely to<br>
precipitate as metallic antimony in the polyester resin<br>
and may become foreign matters when the resin is formed<br>
into films, etc. Further, when it is used as a<br>
container for a beverage, the antimony remaining in the<br>
resin is feared to elute into the beverage. Accordingly,<br>
it is desired not to use such an antimony compound at<br>
all during the production and use another metal<br>
compound as the catalyst, or to use it in a very small<br>
amount if used.<br>
As the polycondensation catalyst, a germanium<br>
compound can be used instead of the antimony compound.<br>
However, the germanium compound is expensive since its<br>
production amount is small, and it is disadvantageous<br>
from the viewpoint of costs to use it for the<br>
production of a polyester. Various proposals have been<br>
made with respect to a method for using an inexpensive<br>
and safe titanium compound as a substitute. A titanium<br>
compound as a polycondensation catalyst has high<br>
activities as compared with an antimony compound or a<br>
germanium compound, and the amount to be used may be<br>
small, and it is inexpensive as compared with the<br>
germanium compound. Thus, the titanium compound is a<br><br>
catalyst highly worth consideration of its industrial<br>
application.<br>
On the other hand, the polyester resin is formed<br>
into various molded products such as films, sheets or<br>
bottles by melt molding. However, during such melt<br>
molding, a cyclic trimer contained in the resin or a<br>
byproduct such as a cyclic trimer formed during the<br>
melt molding, has been problematic in that, for example,<br>
it causes soiling of the casting roll or the like<br>
during film forming.<br>
As a method for reducing such a cyclic trimer, etc.<br>
during melt molding, a method has been proposed to<br>
preliminarily reduce a cyclic trimer, etc. by solid<br>
phase polycondensation (Patent Documents 1 and 2).<br>
However, such a method has been inadequate, since it<br>
can not suppress a byproduct such as a cyclic trimer<br>
formed during the melt molding.<br>
As a method for suppressing a byproduct such as a<br>
cyclic trimer to be formed during the melt molding, a<br>
method has been proposed wherein after solid phase<br>
polycondensation, the polycondensation catalyst in the<br>
resin is deactivated by hot water treatment (Patent<br>
Document 3). However, the effects vary depending upon<br>
the type of the polycondensation catalyst, and as a<br>
result of the study by the present inventors, it has<br>
been found that some effects are observed when a<br><br>
germanium compound is used as the polycondensation<br>
catalyst, but no substantial effects are observed when<br>
an antimony compound or a titanium compound is used as<br>
the polycondensation catalyst.<br>
Further, a method is also proposed wherein to a<br>
polyester resin, a different polyester resin containing<br>
a phosphorus compound is incorporated to deactivate the<br>
polycondensation catalyst (Patent Documents 4 and 5) .<br>
However, such a method is merely to disclose<br>
incorporation of a phosphorus compound, or even if a<br>
polyester resin containing a phosphorus compound is<br>
disclosed, in order to incorporate the phosphorus<br>
compound, the phosphorus compound is blended by an<br>
extruder, and by such a method, it has been difficult<br>
to produce a polyester resin containing a phosphorus<br>
compound. Further, in the examples, only cases wherein<br>
an antimony compound was used as the polycondensation<br>
catalyst, are disclosed, and the effects were<br>
inadequate, and there was a problem such that foreign<br>
matters would be formed by precipitation of antimony.<br>
Further, a method of incorporating a polyester<br>
resin containing a phosphorus compound to improve the<br>
thermal stability of the resulting polyester resin<br>
composition, is also disclosed (Patent Document 6).<br>
However, such a method is directed only to improvement<br>
of the thermal stability of the polyester resin<br><br>
obtained by melt polymerization, and no mention is made<br>
with respect to the effects for suppressing formation<br>
of an oligomer as a byproduct.<br>
Further, a method of incorporating a polyester<br>
resin containing at least 250 ppm, as phosphorus atoms,<br>
of a phosphorus compound to control the amount of an<br>
oligomer to be formed in the resulting polyester resin<br>
composition, is disclosed (Patent Document 7) . However,<br>
in such a method, an antimony compound in an amount of<br>
at least 150 ppm is used as a polymerization catalyst<br>
for the polyester resin containing at least 250 ppm, as<br>
phosphorus atoms, of a phosphorus compound, and by such<br>
a method, it is impossible to prevent a trouble by<br>
foreign matters derived from the antimony compound.<br>
Still further, a method has been proposed wherein<br>
a polyester resin copolymerized with a phosphorus<br>
compound, is employed to deactivate a polycondensation<br>
catalyst in a polyester resin formed by using a<br>
titanium compound or an aluminum compound as the<br>
polycondensation catalyst and simultaneously to<br>
suppress the amount of a byproduct cyclic ester<br>
oligomer formed during the molding (Patent Documents 8<br>
and 9) . However, in this method, no mention is made<br>
with respect to a polyester resin having a volume<br>
resistivity suitable for film forming, and the method<br>
was still inadequate for film forming.<br><br><br><br>

acid, gallic acid, trimethylolethane,<br>
trimethylolpropane, glycerol and pentaerythritol, may<br>
be employed as copolymerizable components.<br><polyester resin><br>
The polyester resin (A) to be used in the method of<br>
the present invention is a resin produced by using<br>
mainly a germanium compound as a polycondensation<br>
catalyst at the time of its production. Here, "mainly"<br>
means that basically only a germanium compound is used<br>
as the polycondensation catalyst. However, if necessary,<br>
a small amount of another metal compound may be used in<br>
combination as the polycondensation catalyst. For<br>
example, in a case where an antimony compound is used<br>
in combination as another metal compound, its amount is<br>
at most 1.0 mol, preferably at most 0.5 mol as antimony<br>
atoms per ton of the resin obtainable. When a germanium<br>
compound is used as the polycondensation catalyst, it<br>
is possible to minimize the influence for deactivation<br>
of the polymerization catalyst by phosphorus of the<br>
phosphorus compound to be used as a stabilizer, whereby<br>
good polymerization activities can be obtained.<br>
Specifically, the germanium compound may, for<br>
example, be germanium dioxide, germanium tetraoxide,<br>
germanium hydroxide, germanium fluoride, germanium<br>
chloride, germanium bromide, germanium iodide,<br><br>
germanium dichlorinated oxide, germanium sulfide,<br>
germanium tetraacetate, tetraphenylgermanium, germanium<br>
oxalate, germanium tetraethoxide or germanium tetra-n-<br>
butoxide. Particularly preferred is germanium dioxide.<br>
With respect to the content of the germanium<br>
compound in the polyester resin (A), the upper limit as<br>
germanium atoms per ton of the resin is 1.5 mol,<br>
preferably 1.2 mol, more preferably 1 mol, particularly<br>
preferably 0.7 mol. If the content exceeds the above<br>
limit, coloration is likely to result during the drying,<br>
and such will be also costly and thus undesirable. The<br>
lower limit is 0.1 mol, preferably 0.15 mol, further<br>
preferably 0.2 mol, particularly preferably 0.25 mol.<br>
If the content is lower than the lower limit, no<br>
adequate polycondensation activities may sometimes be<br>
obtainable, such being undesirable.<br>
In a case where an antimony compound is added as<br>
another metal compound to be used in combination as the<br>
polycondensation catalyst, if antimony atoms exceed 1.0<br>
mol per ton of the resin, foreign matters attributable<br>
to the antimony metal are likely to be formed in the<br>
resin thereby obtained. Further, other metal compounds<br>
may be used in combination with the germanium compound<br>
as the polycondensation catalyst, but such use in<br>
combination is not preferred because of the influence<br>
over deactivation of the catalyst by phosphorus or<br><br>
because such metal compounds are likely to form foreign<br>
matters.<br>
It is essential that the polyester resin (A)<br>
contains phosphorus atoms, and usually, such phosphorus<br>
atoms are derived from a phosphorus compound which is<br>
added as a stabilizer during the production of the<br>
resin. Specifically, the phosphorus compound to be used<br>
may, for example, be orthophosphoric acid;<br>
polyphosphoric acid; a pentavalent phosphorus compound<br>
such as trimethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, tri-n-<br>
butyl phosphate, trioctyl phosphate, triphenyl<br>
phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, tris(triethylene<br>
glycol) phosphate, ethyldiethyl phosphonoacetate,<br>
methyl acid phosphate, ethyl acid phosphate, isopropyl<br>
acid phosphate, butyl acid phosphate, monobutyl<br>
phosphate, dibutyl phosphate, dioctyl phosphate or<br>
triethylene glycol acid phosphate; phosphorous acid;<br>
hypophosphorous acid; or a trivalent phosphorus<br>
compound such as diethyl phosphite, trisdodecyl<br>
phosphite, trisnonyldecyl phosphite or triphenyl<br>
phosphite. Among them, a trivalent phosphorus compound<br>
usually has a higher reducing property than a<br>
pentavalent phosphorus compound, and a metal compound<br>
added as a polycondensation catalyst is likely to be<br>
reduced and precipitated to cause formation of foreign<br>
matters. Accordingly, a pentavalent phosphorus compound<br><br>
is preferred.<br>
As a phosphorus compound to be used for the<br>
production of the polyester resin (A), orthophosphoric<br>
acid, polyphosphoric acid, diethyl phosphite, ethyl<br>
acid phosphate or triethyl phosphate is preferred, and<br>
orthophosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid or ethyl acid<br>
phosphate is particularly preferred.<br>
The content of the phosphorus compound in the<br>
polyester resin (A) is at least 10 mol as phosphorus<br>
atoms per ton of resin, as represented by the following<br>
formula (1) wherein PI is the content (mol) of<br>
phosphorus atoms, preferably at least 15 mol, further<br>
preferably at least 20 mol:<br>
Pl&gt;10	(1)<br>
If the content of the phosphorus compound is less<br>
than the lower limit, there may be a case where no<br>
adequate effect for suppressing formation of a<br>
byproduct such as a cyclic trimer is obtainable unless<br>
the weight ratio of the polyester resin (A) to the<br>
polyester resin (B) (polyester resin (A)/polyester<br>
resin (B) ) is made high when the polyester resin (A)<br>
and the polyester resin (B) are melt-kneaded, such<br>
being undesirable. The upper limit for the content of<br>
the phosphorus compound is not particularly limited.<br>
However, the presence in a large amount may sometimes<br>
lower the polymerization rate, and the content is<br><br>
preferably at most 100 mol.<br>
In the polyester resin (A), when the content (mol)<br>
of germanium atoms per ton of the resin is represented<br>
by Gel, the lower limit of the ratio of the germanium<br>
atoms to the phosphorus atoms (Gel/Pi) in the resin (A)<br>
is 0.001, preferably 0.005, further preferably 0.008,<br>
particularly preferably 0.01. If the ratio is less than<br>
the lower limit, the polymerizability may sometimes be<br>
inadequate. The upper limit is 0.15, preferably 0.1,<br>
more preferably 0.075, particularly preferably 0.050.<br>
If the ratio exceeds the upper limit, coloration of the<br>
polymer tends to be substantial, and consequently, the<br>
color of the obtainable polyester resin composition (C)<br>
tends to deteriorate, such being undesirable.<br>
If the polyester resin (A) contains foreign matters<br>
derived from the polycondensation catalyst, other<br>
additives, etc., the physical properties of the<br>
polyester resin composition (C) obtainable by the<br>
present invention tend to deteriorate, and the quality<br>
of a molded product such as a film or bottle formed<br>
from such a composition (C) tends to be poor.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred that the number of foreign<br>
matters having sizes of at least 0.1 mm contained in<br>
the polyester resin (A) is at most 1 per 50 g of the<br>
polyester resin (A) , and no foreign matter having a<br>
size of at least 0.3 mm is contained. Here, the size of<br><br>
a foreign matter is represented by the length of the<br>
longest portion of the foreign matter.<br><catalyst etc. for the production of polyester resin></catalyst>
(B)&gt;<br>
In the production of the polyester resin (B), as a<br>
catalyst to be used for the polycondensation reaction,<br>
a known polycondensation catalyst may be employed such<br>
as a germanium compound, an antimony compound, an<br>
aluminum compound, a tin compound or a titanium<br>
compound. However, in the present invention, it is<br>
essential to employ at least a titanium compound, and<br>
it is preferred not to use or to use in an amount as<br>
small as possible a catalyst which can be a cause for<br>
foreign matters, such as an antimony compound. The<br>
titanium compound may be suitably selected for use<br>
among conventional titanium compounds, and an oxide, a<br>
hydroxide, an alkoxide, an acetate, a carbonate, an<br>
oxalate or a halide of titanium may, for example, be<br>
mentioned.<br>
Specifically, the titanium compound may, for<br>
example, be a titanium alkoxide such as tetra-n-propyl<br>
titanate, tetra-i-propyl titanate, tetra-n-butyl<br>
titanate tetramer, tetra-t-butyl titanate,<br>
tetracyclohexyl titanate, tetraphenyl titanate or<br>
tetrabenzyl titanate, a titanium oxide obtainable by<br>
hydrolysis of a titanium alkoxide, a titanium/silicon<br><br>
or zirconium composite oxide obtainable by hydrolysis<br>
of a mixture of a titanium alkoxide with a silicon<br>
alkoxide or a zirconium alkoxide, titanium acetate,<br>
titanium oxalate, titanium potassium oxalate, titanium<br>
sodium oxalate, potassium titanate, sodium titanate, a<br>
titanic acid/aluminum hydroxide mixture, titanium<br>
chloride, a titanium chloride/aluminum chloride mixture,<br>
titanium bromide, titanium fluoride, potassium<br>
hexafluorotitanate, cobalt hexafluorotitanate,<br>
manganese	hexafluorotitanate,	ammonium<br>
hexafluorotitanate or titanium acetyl acetonate. Among<br>
them, a titanium alkoxide such as tetra-n-propyl<br>
titanate, tetra-i-propyl titanate or tetra-n-butyl<br>
titanate, titanium oxalate or titanium potassium<br>
oxalate is preferred, and tetra-n-butyl titanate is<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
With respect to the content of titanium atoms in<br>
the polyester resin (B) , the lower limit is preferably<br>
0.002 mol, more preferably 0.02 mol, further preferably<br>
0.04 mol, per ton of the polyester resin (B) . If the<br>
amount is less than the lower limit, the activities as<br>
the catalyst tend to be inadequate. The upper limit is<br>
preferably 1 mol, more preferably 0.5 mol, further<br>
preferably 0.3 mol. If the content is larger than the<br>
upper limit, yellowing of the polyester resin (B) tends<br>
to be strong, and consequently, yellowing tends to be<br><br>
strong with the polyester resin composition (C) after<br>
the melt-kneading.<br>
Further, the polyester resin (B) preferably<br>
contains phosphorus atoms, and such phosphorus atoms<br>
are usually derived from a phosphorus compound which is<br>
added as a stabilizer at the time of the production -of<br>
the resin (B) . The phosphorus compound to be used may<br>
be a compound similar to one which is used for the<br>
production of the above polyester resin (A) . Namely,<br>
the phosphorus compound to be used for the production<br>
of the polyester resin (B) is preferably a pentavalent<br>
phosphorus compound, more preferably orthophosphoric<br>
acid, trimethyl phosphate or ethyl acid phosphate,<br>
particularly preferably ethyl acid phosphate.<br>
By the use of such a phosphorus compound, it is<br>
possible to suppress formation of foreign matters made<br>
of a metal compound and a phosphorus compound added at<br>
the time of the polycondensation.<br>
With respect to the content of phosphorus atoms in<br>
the polyester resin (B), the ratio to titanium atoms is<br>
required to satisfy the following formula (4) wherein<br>
P2 represents the content of phosphorus atoms, and Til<br>
represents the content of titanium atoms, per ton of<br>
the resin:<br>
0^P2/Til^80	(4)<br>
The ratio of phosphorus atoms to titanium atoms<br><br>
(P2/Til) is preferably from 0.1 to 40, more preferably<br>
from 0.2 to 20, further preferably from 1 to 10.<br>
The content of phosphorus atoms is usually at most<br>
4 mol, preferably at most 2 mol, more preferably at<br>
most 1 mol and usually at least 0 mol, preferably at<br>
least 0.03 mol, further preferably at least 0.1 mol,<br>
particularly preferably at least 0.15 mol, per ton of<br>
the resin. If the content of the phosphorus atoms is<br>
too small i.e. less than 0.03 mol, the effects as the<br>
stabilizer during the production tend to be inadequate,<br>
and if it exceeds 4 mol, the polycondensation reaction<br>
rate tends to be low, such being undesirable.<br>
Further, in the polyester resin (B) of the present<br>
invention, the content of the cyclic trimer is<br>
preferably at most 8,000 g, more preferably at most<br>
5,000 g, further preferably at most 3,000 g, per ton of<br>
the resin. If the content of the cyclic trimer exceeds<br>
8,000 g, for example, soiling of the casting roll is<br>
likely to take place when a polyester resin composition<br>
(C) of the present invention obtainable by using the<br>
polyester resin (B) thereby obtained, is formed into a<br>
film.<br><other catalysts etc. for the production of polyester></other>
resins (A) and (B)&gt;<br>
Further, the polyester resin (A) and the polyester<br>
resin (B) to be used for the method of the present<br><br>
invention may further contain at least one type of<br>
metal atoms selected from the group consisting of metal<br>
elements in Group 1A of the Periodic Table, metal atoms<br>
in Group 2A of the Periodic Table, manganese, iron and<br>
cobalt, derived from metal compounds other than the<br>
above-mentioned polycondensation catalysts, which may<br>
be used as a co-catalyst, an esterification catalyst,<br>
etc. Such compounds may, for example, be oxides,<br>
hydroxides alkoxides, acetates, carbonates, oxalates<br>
and halides, of lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium,<br>
calcium, manganese, iron and cobalt. Specifically,<br>
lithium acetate, sodium acetate, potassium acetate,<br>
magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium<br>
alkoxide, magnesium acetate, magnesium carbonate,<br>
calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium acetate,<br>
calcium carbonate, manganese oxide, manganese hydroxide,<br>
manganese acetate, ferric acetate, cobalt formate,<br>
cobalt acetate, cobalt oxalate, cobalt carbonate,<br>
cobalt bromide and cobalt acetyl acetonate may, for<br>
example, be mentioned. Among them, a magnesium compound<br>
is preferred, and particularly preferred is magnesium<br>
acetate or its hydrate.<br>
In the polyester resin (B), a bivalent metal<br>
compound is preferably added to have its volume<br>
resistivity suppressed to be low. Such a bivalent metal<br>
compound may be suitably selected for use among the<br><br>
above-mentioned bivalent metal compounds, so that the<br>
desired volume resistivity can be obtained.<br>
Such a metal compound may be added at an optional<br>
time from the initiation of the esterification reaction<br>
or the ester exchange reaction to the completion of the<br>
polycondensation reaction. However, it is preferably<br>
added during a period from the initiation of the<br>
esterification reaction or the ester exchange reaction<br>
to the initiation of the polycondensation reaction.<br>
Particularly in the case of the esterification reaction,<br>
it is preferred to add it during a period of from<br>
completion of the esterification reaction to the<br>
initiation of the polycondensation reaction. As<br>
preferred metal compounds, a calcium compound and a<br>
magnesium compound may be mentioned. Among them,<br>
calcium acetate and magnesium acetate are preferred,<br>
and magnesium acetate is particularly preferred.<br>
The volume resistivity of the resin (B) is<br>
preferably at most 50xl07 Q.cm, more preferably at most<br>
20xl07 Q.cm. Here, the volume resistivity is a value<br>
calculated by the measuring method which will be<br>
described hereinafter.<br>
If the volume resistivity is higher than the above<br>
value, the contact between the sheet extruded from the<br>
die and the cooling drum, during the film formation by<br>
using the resulting polyester resin composition (C) ,<br><br>
tends to be poor, and as a result, cooling tends to be<br>
inadequate, whereby it tends to be difficult to<br>
increase the film forming rate.<br><polyester resin composition><br>
The polyester resin composition (C) of the present<br>
invention is a polyester resin composition (C) obtained<br>
by melt-kneading the polyester resin (A) containing<br>
phosphorus atoms and germanium atoms and the polyester<br>
resin (B) containing titanium atoms, and the<br>
composition (C) is a composition which satisfies the<br>
following formula (6) and at the same time satisfies<br>
the following condition (a):<br>
(P3/Ti2)&gt;5 (6)<br>
provided that P3 is the content (mol) of phosphorus<br>
atoms and Ti2 is the content (mol) of titanium atoms,<br>
per ton of the composition (C),<br>
(a) Y^8000 and Y-X^2500, where when the polyester<br>
resin (A) and the polyester resin (B) are melt-kneaded<br>
at 285°C for 20 minutes in a nitrogen atmosphere, X is<br>
the content (g) of a cyclic trimer per ton of the<br>
polyester resin composition before the melt kneading,<br>
and Y is the content (g) of a cyclic trimer per ton of<br>
the composition (C) after the melt kneading.<br>
In the polyester resin composition (C), the ratio<br>
(P3/Ti2) of the content (mol) of phosphorus atoms to<br>
the content (mol) of titanium atoms, per ton of the<br><br>
composition, represented by the above formula (6) is<br>
required to be at least 5, but is preferably at least<br>
10, more preferably at least 20. If the ratio is less<br>
than 5, the amount of a cyclic trimer or the like to be<br>
formed as a byproduct when the composition is melted<br>
for molding, tends to be large, or the color of the<br>
polyester resin composition (C) is likely to<br>
deteriorate, such being undesirable. Further, such a<br>
molar ratio is preferably at most 1,000, more<br>
preferably at most 500, further preferably at most 200.<br>
If it exceeds 1,000, the polycondensation rate tends to<br>
be slow during the production of the raw material resin<br>
for the polyester resin composition (C) , such being<br>
undesirable.<br>
Further, the polyester resin composition (C) of the<br>
present invention is required to satisfy the above<br>
condition (a). Namely, Y^8000 and Y-X^2500, where when<br>
the polyester resin (A) and the polyester resin (B) are<br>
melt-kneaded at 285°C for 20 minutes in a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere, X is the content (g) of a cyclic trimer per<br>
ton of the polyester resin composition before the melt<br>
kneading, and Y is the content (g) of a cyclic trimer<br>
per ton of the composition (C) after the melt kneading.<br>
The upper limit for Y is 8,000, but preferably 6,000,<br>
further preferably 4,000. If Y exceeds 8,000, a foreign<br>
matter tends to be easily formed during the molding,<br><br>
such being undesirable.<br>
Further, the upper limit for Y-X is 2,500, but<br>
preferably 2,000, particularly preferably 1,000. If Y-X<br>
exceeds 2,500, formation of an oligomer such as a<br>
cyclic trimer during the molding at a high temperature<br>
tends to be substantial, whereby a foreign matter is<br>
likely to be formed, such being undesirable.<br>
Further, at the time of obtaining the polyester<br>
resin composition (C) of the present invention, the<br>
weight ratio of the polyester resin (A) to the<br>
polyester resin (B) (polyester resin (A)/polyester<br>
resin (B) ) is preferably at most 0.5, more preferably<br>
at most 0.25, further preferably at most 0.1. If this<br>
weight ratio is higher than 0.5, the amount of the<br>
polyester resin (A) in the composition (C) tends to be<br>
large, and accordingly, the amount of the metal<br>
compound to be used as a polycondensation catalyst,<br>
such as a germanium compound, tends to be large and<br>
costly, or when an antimony compound is used, its<br>
content will be large, and consequently, foreign<br>
matters from such a composition tend to be substantial<br>
in the molded product.<br>
Further, the lower limit of such a weight ratio is<br>
more than 0, but is preferably at least 0.01, more<br>
preferably at least 0.02. If the lower limit is 0, i.e.<br>
if no polyester resin (A) is used, no effects for<br><br>
suppressing a byproduct such as a cyclic trimer to be<br>
formed, will be obtained, such being undesirable.<br>
In the polyester resin composition (C) of the<br>
present invention, in addition to the above polyester<br>
resin (A) and the polyester resin (B) , another resin<br>
(third component) may also be used, as the case<br>
requires. However, the weight ratio of the total amount<br>
of the polyester resins (A) and (B) to the polyester<br>
resin composition (C) [((A)+(B))/(C)] is preferably at<br>
least 0.9, more preferably at least 0.95, particularly<br>
preferably at least 0.99. If the weight ratio is less<br>
than 0.9, the effect for suppressing a byproduct such<br>
as a cyclic trimer to be formed tends to be inadequate<br>
by an influence of the third component other than the<br>
polyester resins (A) and (B), such being undesirable.<br><production of polyester resins and><br>
For the production of the polyester resins (A) and<br>
(B) to be used in the method of the present invention,<br>
a common method for producing polyester resins may<br>
basically be used except that they are respectively<br>
adjusted to contain the prescribed amounts of<br>
phosphorus atoms and germanium atoms (resin (A)) and<br>
the prescribed amount of the titanium atoms (resin (B))<br>
Namely, the above-mentioned dicarboxylic acid component<br>
containing terephthalic acid or its ester-forming<br>
derivative as the main component and the diol component<br><br>
containing ethylene glycol as the main component, are<br>
subjected to an esterification reaction in an<br>
esterification reactor usually at a temperature of from<br>
240 to 280°C usually under a pressure at a level of a<br>
relative pressure of from 0 to 4xl05 Pa to the<br>
atmospheric pressure, with stirring for from about 1 to<br>
10 hours, or to an ester exchange reaction in the<br>
presence of an ester exchange catalyst, and then, the<br>
obtained polyester low molecular weight product as the<br>
esterification reaction product or the ester exchange<br>
reaction product, is transferred to a polycondensation<br>
tank and subjected to melt polycondensation in the<br>
presence of a polycondensation catalyst and a<br>
phosphorus compound usually at a temperature of from<br>
250 to 290°C under normal pressure and then gradually<br>
reduced pressure and finally under a reduced pressure<br>
of from 1,333 to 13.3 Pa as the absolute pressure, with<br>
stirring for from 1 to 20 hours. This method may be of<br>
a continuous type or a batch type.<br>
Further, at that time, preparation of the starting<br>
material slurry comprising the dicarboxylic acid<br>
component containing terephthalic acid or its ester<br>
forming derivative as the main components and the diol<br>
component containing ethylene glycol as the main<br>
component, is preferably carried out so that the molar<br>
ratio of the total diol component to the total<br><br>
dicarboxylic acid component is within a arrange of from<br>
1.0 to 2.5. Further, the esterif ication ratio of the<br>
polyester raw material product as the esterification<br>
reaction product or the ester exchange reaction product<br>
(the proportion of the one reacted with the diol<br>
component and esterified among the total carboxyl<br>
groups of the raw material dicarboxylic acid component)<br>
is preferably at least 95%.<br>
The addition of the polycondensation catalyst, the<br>
phosphorus compound and the optional compound of at<br>
least one metal selected from the group consisting of<br>
metal elements in Group 1A of the Periodic Table,<br>
elements in Group 2A of the Periodic Table, manganese,<br>
iron and cobalt, at the time of the polycondensation,<br>
may be made at an optional stage in the process for<br>
preparing a slurry of terephthalic acid and ethylene<br>
glycol as the raw material, and other dicarboxylic acid<br>
component employed as the case requires or in the<br>
process for the esterification reaction or ester<br>
exchange reaction, or at an initial stage of the melt<br>
polycondensation step.<br>
Further, within a range not to impair the effect of<br>
the present invention, various additives such as other<br>
known esterification catalyst, ester exchange catalyst,<br>
polycondensation catalyst, nucleating agent, inorganic<br>
filler, lubricant, inorganic filler, lubricant,<br><br>
slipping agent, anti-blocking agent, stabilizer,<br>
antistatic agent, anti-fogging agent and pigment, may<br>
be used in necessary amounts.<br>
The resin obtained by the above melt<br>
polycondensation is usually withdrawn in the form of a<br>
strand from the discharge outlet provided at the bottom<br>
of the polycondensation tank and cut by a cutter under<br>
cooling with water or after cooling with water into<br>
particulates such as pellets or chips. Further, as the<br>
case requires, the particulates after such melt<br>
polycondensation are usually heated at a temperature of<br>
from 60 to 180°C in an inert gas atmosphere such as<br>
nitrogen, carbon dioxide or argon or in a steam<br>
atmosphere, or in a steam-containing inert gas<br>
atmosphere to have the surface of the resin<br>
particulates crystallized and then subjected to heat<br>
treatment usually at a temperature of from immediately<br>
below the adhesive temperature of the resin to lower by<br>
80°C than the adhesive temperature usually for a period<br>
of at most 50 hours in an inert gas atmosphere and/or<br>
under a reduced pressure of from about 1,333 to 13.3 Pa<br>
as the absolute pressure, while the particulates are<br>
permitted to flow to avoid fusion to one another, for<br>
solid phase polycondensation. By this solid phase<br>
polycondensation, the particulates can further be<br>
highly polymerized, and at the same time, it is<br><br>
possible to reduce the content of a cyclic trimer as<br>
the reaction byproduct, or the content of acetaldehyde.<br><production of polyester resin composition><br>
The polyester resin composition (C) of the present<br>
invention can be prepared by melt-kneading the above-<br>
described polyester resins (A) and (B) in the above-<br>
mentioned suitable weight ratio. Usually, it is<br>
obtained by kneading and extruding by an extruder a<br>
resin blend having the polyester resins (A) and (B)<br>
uniformly mixed, followed by pelletizing. Otherwise,<br>
the above-mentioned pelletized polyester resins (A) and<br>
(B)	are introduced into a raw material hopper of e.g.<br>
an extruder for forming a film or an injection molding<br>
machine for molding bottles, whereby the composition<br>
(C)	is obtainable in the melting zone of the cylinder<br>
of the extruder or the injection molding machine, and<br>
it is thereby possible to suppress formation of a<br>
cyclic trimer as a byproduct during the melting.<br>
The polyester resin composition (C) of the present<br>
invention can be used suitably as a raw material for<br>
various fabrication employing a common method such as<br>
melt extrusion or injection molding, i.e. as a raw<br>
material for films, bottles or sheets. For films or<br>
sheets, the melting time in the extrusion process is<br>
long as compared with for bottles, whereby the effects<br>
for suppressing formation of a cyclic trimer as a<br><br>
byproduct can suitably be obtained, such being<br>
particularly preferred. Further, for films or sheets,<br>
it is necessary to lower the volume resistivity in<br>
order to improve the productivity during the<br>
fabrication. For this purpose, it is preferred to<br>
employ one having a low volume resistivity as the<br>
polyester resin (B) . Further, in general, the larger<br>
the content of phosphorus atoms in the polyester resin,<br>
the higher the volume resistivity. However, with the<br>
films or sheets made of the polyester resin composition<br>
(C) produced by the method of the present invention,<br>
the volume resistivity is lower than the volume<br>
resistivity normally expected from the content of<br>
phosphorus atoms in the composition, and the<br>
productivity is good.<br>
The volume resistivity of the polyester resin<br>
composition (C) obtained by the method of the present<br>
invention is preferably at most 60xl07 Q .cm, more<br>
preferably at most 30xl07 Q .cm. If the volume<br>
resistivity is higher than this, the contact between<br>
the cooling drum and the sheet extruded from the die at<br>
the time of the film forming tends to be poor as<br>
mentioned above, and consequently, cooling tends to be<br>
inadequate and it will be difficult to increase the<br>
film forming speed.<br>
It is preferred that a film formed from the<br><br>
polyester resin composition (C) obtained by the method<br>
of the present invention, has protrusions having<br>
heights of at least 0.27 um at a rate of at most 100<br>
2<br>
protrusions/10 cm and protrusions having heights of at<br>
least 0.54 um at a rate of at most 30 protrusions/10 cm2,<br>
on the film surface. The measurement of protrusions on<br>
the film surface is in accordance with the after-<br>
mentioned measuring method.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to Preparation Examples and<br>
Working Examples. However, it should be understood that<br>
the present invention is by no means restricted to such<br>
specific Examples.<br>
Further, in the present invention, various<br>
measuring methods are as follows.<br>
1.	Content of metal atoms<br>
2.5 g of a polyester resin sample was ashed and<br>
completely decomposed by a usual method in the presence<br>
of sulfuric acid and then adjusted to 50 ml with<br>
distilled water, followed by quantitative analysis by<br>
plasma emission spectrometry.<br>
2.	Intrinsic viscosity<br>
0.50 g of a freeze-pulverized polyester resin<br>
sample was dissolved in a solvent mixture of phenol/<br>
tetrachloroethane (weight ratio: 1/1) at a<br><br>
concentration (a) of 1.0 g/dl at 110°C for 30 minutes,<br>
and then, the relative viscosity (nrel) to the stock<br>
solution was measured at 30°C by means of an Ubbelohde<br>
capillary viscometer. A ratio (nsp/a) of the specific<br>
viscosity (nsp) obtained from this relative viscosity<br>
(nrel)-l to the concentration (a) is obtained, and with<br>
respect to cases where the concentration (a) was<br>
changed to 0.5 g/dl, 0.2 g/dl and 0.1 g/dl, the<br>
respective ratios (nsp/a) were obtained in the same<br>
manner, whereupon from these values, a ratio (nsp/a)<br>
when the concentration (a) being 0 was extrapolated,<br>
was obtained as the intrinsic viscosity [n] (dl/g).<br>
3.	Content of cyclic trimer<br>
4 mg of a polyester resin sample was dissolved in 3<br>
ml of a solvent mixture of chloroform/<br>
hexafluoroisopropanol (volume ratio:2/1) and further<br>
diluted by an addition of 40 ml of chloroform. With<br>
respect to the obtained solution, quantitative analysis<br>
was carried out by means of GPC ("HLC-8120GPC",<br>
manufactured by TOSOH CORPORATION).<br>
4.	Color<br>
A polyester resin sample was filled fully in a<br>
cylindrical powder calorimetric cell having an inner<br>
diameter of 36 mm and a depth of 15 mm, and by means of<br>
a calorimetric color difference meter ("ZE-2000",<br>
manufactured by Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd.),<br><br>
color coordinate b of the Hunter's color difference<br>
formula in the Lab colorimetric system disclosed in<br>
Japanese Industrial Standards, 1970 Edition (JIS Z8730<br>
Reference 1), was obtained as a simple average value of<br>
four portions measured by rotating the cell 90° at a<br>
time by a reflection method.<br>
5. Volume resistivity<br>
15 g of a polyester resin sample was put into a<br>
branched test tube having an inner diameter of 20 mm<br>
and a length of 180 mm, and after replacing the<br>
interior of the test tube sufficiently with nitrogen,<br>
the test tube was immersed in an oil bath of 250°C. The<br>
interior of the test tube was evacuated to at most 1<br>
Torr by a vacuum pump and vacuum dried for 20 minutes.<br>
Then, the oil bath temperature was raised to 285°C to<br>
have the polyester resin sample melted. Then, nitrogen<br>
pressurization and depressurization were repeated to<br>
remove the included air bubbles. In this melt, two<br>
stainless steel electrode sheets having an area of 1 cm2<br>
were inserted in parallel with a distance of 5 mm (the<br>
rear sides not facing to each other are covered with an<br>
insulator), and after the temperature was stabilized, a<br>
DC voltage of 100 V was applied by a resistance meter<br>
("MODEL HP4339B" manufactured by Hewlett-Packard), and<br>
the resistance at that time was calculated and taken as<br>
the volume resistivity (QZcm).<br><br>
6.	Measurement of the number of foreign matters of at<br>
least 0.1 mm in polyester resin (A)<br>
50 g of a polyester resin sample was put into a<br>
mesh basket having apertures not to let the sample pass<br>
therethrough, and pure water was poured on the sample<br>
to thoroughly wash it. The washed sample was dried at<br>
60°C for 1 hour.<br>
The sample was spread on a table provided with a<br>
backlight of a fluorescent lamp, and the sample grains<br>
were thoroughly inspected one by one by means of a<br>
magnifying glass of two magnifications. With respect to<br>
a sample containing foreign matters, the size of each<br>
foreign matter was inspected by a magnifier of 10<br>
magnifications, manufactured by PEAK Co., and among<br>
foreign matters contained in the sample, the numbers of<br>
foreign matters of from 0.1 to 0.2 mm, from 0.2 to 0.3<br>
mm and more than 0.3 mm were counted and taken as the<br>

matter was represented by the length of its longest<br>
portion. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
7.	Evaluation of the number of protrusions on the<br>
biaxially stretched film surface (FE evaluation)<br>
10 kg of a polyester resin (C) sample was<br>
crystallized and dried at 180°C for 2 hours in a hot air<br>
dryer to bring the moisture content to not more than<br>
100 ppm. The dried resin sample was melt-extruded at a<br><br><br>
resin temperature of 285°C at an extrusion rate of 8<br>
kg/hr by a tubular film forming machine having a metal<br>
fiber sintered filter (95% screening precision: 25 um)<br>
built in a single screw extruder of 40 mm in diameter<br>
and equipped with a quadruple spiral ring die of 80 mm<br>
in diameter, and cooled by a cooling ring of 60 mm in<br>
diameter for tubular forming to obtain a tubular film<br>
having a thickness of 210 um and a folded width of 10<br>
cm. Then, by means of a biaxial stretching machine<br>
(manufactured by T.M. Long Co.), the non-stretched film<br>
was preliminarily heated at 92°C for 2 minutes and then<br>
simultaneously biaxially stretched 4.0 times in a<br>
longitudinal direction and 3.5 times in a transverse<br>
direction at a stretching speed of 20,000%/min and<br>
after the stretching, subjected to heat setting at 92°C<br>
for 1 minute to obtain a biaxially stretched film.<br>
With respect to the obtained biaxially stretched<br>
film, the number of protrusions on the film surface was<br>
observed by the following method and evaluated by the<br>
following standards, and the results are shown in Table<br>
3.<br>
The biaxially stretched film was put on an angular<br>
metal frame made of stainless steel and subjected to<br>
aluminum vapor deposition in a vacuum vapor deposition<br>
machine. Then, on its surface, a frame of 2.0 cm x 2.5<br>
cm was marked at random, and the number of coarse<br><br>
protrusions within the area was observed by a two-beam<br>
interference microscope using, as a light source, white<br>
light of a halogen lamp filtered through a G filter. A<br>
coarse protrusion is observed as interference fringe<br>
contour lines, and as the height of the protrusion<br>
increases, the number of such contour lines increases.<br>
In the present invention, the number of protrusions was<br>
counted by the following classification depending upon<br>
the number of contour lines for each of the protrusion<br>
heights of 0.54 um and 0.81 um and calculated per a<br>
film area of 10 cm2.<br>
(1)	Number of protrusions having a height of at least<br>
0.27 um having at least one contour line.<br>
(2)	Number of protrusions having a height of at least<br>
0.54 um having at least two contour lines.<br><evaluation of biaxially stretched film surface><br>
o: Very good film<br>
The number of protrusions having a height of at<br>
least 0.27 um is at most 50 protrusions/10 cm2, and the<br>
number of protrusions having a height of at least 0.54<br>
um is at most 10 protrusions/10 cm2.<br>
I: Useful film<br>
The number of protrusions having a height of at<br>
least 0.27 um is at most 100 protrusions/10 cm2, and the<br>
number of protrusions having a height of at least 0.54<br>
um is at most 30 protrusions/10 cm2.<br><br>
The number of protrusions having a height of at<br>
least 0.27 urn is more than 100 protrusions/10 cm2, or<br>
the number of protrusions having a height of at least<br>
0.54 urn is more than 30 protrusions/10 cm2.<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE A-l<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>
A slurry comprising 43 kg (260 mol) of terephthalic<br>
acid and 19 kg (312 mol) of ethylene glycol, was<br>
supplied over a period of 4 hours to an esterification<br>
reactor having about 50 kg of bis(hydroxyethyl)<br>
terephthalate preliminarily charged and maintained at a<br>
temperature of 250°C under a relative pressure of<br>
1.2xi05 Pa, and the esterification reaction was carried<br>
out for further 1 hour after completion of the supply.<br>
50 kg of the product of this esterif ication reaction<br>
was transferred to a polycondensation tank.<br>
Then, orthophosphoric acid and germanium dioxide<br>
were added every 5 minutes in the form of an ethylene<br>
glycol solution to the above polycondensation tank<br>
having the esterification reaction product transferred.<br>
They were added so that 4 0 mol of phosphorus atoms and<br>
0.5 mol of germanium atoms per ton of the obtained<br>
resin, would be contained. Then, the interior of the<br>
reaction system was heated from 250°C to 280°C over a<br>
period of 2 hours and 30 minutes, and at the same time,<br><br>
the pressure was reduced from atmospheric pressure to<br>
400 Pa (absolute pressure) in 1 hour, and while the<br>
same pressure was maintained, melt polycondensation was<br>
carried out for a time until the intrinsic viscosity of<br>
the obtained resin would be 0.64 dl/g, whereupon the<br>
resin was withdrawn in the form of a strand from the<br>
discharge outlet provided at the bottom of the<br>
polycondensation tank, cooled with water and then<br>
formed into pellets by a cutter, to obtain about 40 kg<br>
of a polyester resin (A) . The physical properties of<br>
the obtained resin are shown in Table 1.<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE A-2<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>

changed to ethyl acid phosphate.<br><br>
The physical properties of the obtained resin are<br>
shown in Table 1.<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE A-4<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>
50 kg (260 mol) of dimethyl terephthalate and 32.3<br>
kg (520 mol) of ethylene glycol were supplied to an<br>
ester exchange reactor at 150°C, and as an ester<br>
exchange catalyst, magnesium acetate tetrahydrate was<br>
added so that 4.1 mol of magnesium atoms would be<br>
contained per ton of the resin obtained as an ethylene<br>
glycol solution, and then, the temperature of the<br>
reactor was raised to 225°C over a period of 3 hours,<br>
and then maintained at that temperature for 1 hour to<br>
complete the ester exchange reaction. This ester<br>
exchange reaction product was transferred to a<br>
polycondensation tank.<br>
Then, orthophosphoric acid and germanium dioxide<br>
were added every 5 minutes in the form of an ethylene<br>
glycol solution to the above polycondensation tank<br>
having the ester exchange reaction product transferred.<br>
They were added so that 35.5 mol of phosphorus atoms<br>
and 0.6 mol of germanium atoms would be contained per<br>
ton of the obtained resin. Then, the interior of the<br>
reaction system was heated from 225°C to 280°C over a<br>
period of 2 hours and 30 minutes, and at the same time,<br>
the pressure was reduced from normal pressure to 400 Pa<br><br>
(absolute pressure) in 85 minutes, and while the same<br>
pressure was maintained, melt polycondensation was<br>
carried out for a time until the intrinsic viscosity of<br>
the obtained resin would be 0.64 dl/g, and the resin<br>
was withdrawn in the form of a strand from the<br>
discharge outlet provided at the bottom of the<br>
polycondensation tank, cooled with water and then<br>
formed into pellets by a cutter to obtain about 40 kg<br>
of a polyester resin (A)-4. The physical properties of<br>
the obtained resin are shown in Table 1.<br>
PREPARATION COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>
50 kg (260 mol) of dimethyl terephthalate and 32.3<br>

exchange catalyst, manganese acetate tetrahydrate was<br>
added so that 2.1 mol of manganese atoms would be<br>
contained per ton of the resin obtained as an ethylene<br>
glycol solution. Then, the temperature of the reactor<br>
was raised to 225°C over a period of 3 hours. After 20<br>
minutes from the initiation of distillation of methanol<br>
formed by the ester exchange reaction, antimony<br>
trioxide was added so that 1.6 mol of antimony atoms<br>
would be contained per ton of the resin.<br>
The temperature was raised to 225°C over a<br>
prescribed time, and after the temperature rise, the<br><br>
temperature was maintained at that level for 1 hour,<br>
and trimethyl phosphate (TMA) was added so that 13 mol<br>
of phosphorus atoms would be contained per ton of the<br>
resin, and the ester exchange reaction was<br>
substantially completed. This reaction product was<br>
transferred to a polycondensation tank, and potassium<br>
acetate was added so that 1.3 mol of potassium atoms<br>
would be contained per ton of the resin. Then, the<br>
interior of the reaction system was heated from 225°C to<br>
280°C over a period of 2 hours and 30 minutes, and at<br>
the same time, the pressure was reduced from normal<br>
pressure to 400 Pa (absolute pressure) in 85 minutes,<br>
and while the same pressure was maintained, melt<br>
polycondensation was carried out for a time until the<br>
intrinsic viscosity of the obtained resin would be 0.60<br>
dl/g, and the resin was withdrawn in the form of a<br>
strand from the discharge outlet provided at the bottom<br>
of the polycondensation tank, cooled with water formed<br>
into pellets by a cutter to obtain about 40 kg of a<br>
polyester resin (A)-5. The physical properties of the<br>
obtained resin are shown in Table 1.<br>
PREPARATION COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>
A polyester resin (A)-6 was prepared in the same<br>
manner as in Preparation Comparative Example 1 except<br>
that in Preparation Comparative Example 1, the amount<br><br>
of trimethyl phosphate added was changed to 40 mol as<br>
phosphorus atoms per ton of the resin, by carrying out<br>
the polycondensation reaction until the intrinsic<br>
viscosity became 0.60 dl/g. The physical properties of<br>
the obtained resin are shown in Table 1.<br>
In the polyester resins (A) obtained in these<br>
Preparation Comparative Examples 1 and 2, foreign<br>
matters of at least 0.1 ram were contained, such being<br>
undesirable for the production of a film from the resin<br>
composition (C) of the present invention.<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE A-5<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>
Melt polycondensation was carried out for a time<br>
until the intrinsic viscosity of the obtained resin<br>
would be 0.6 4 dl/g in the same manner as in the method<br>
for producing the polyester resin (A)-l in Preparation<br>
Example A-l except that orthophosphoric acid and<br>
germanium dioxide were added in such amounts that 12<br>
mol of phosphorus atoms and 1.5 mol of germanium atoms<br>
would be contained per ton of the resin, and the resin<br>
was withdrawn in the form of a strand from the<br>
discharge outlet provided at the bottom of the<br>
polycondensation tank, cooled with ice and then formed<br>
into pellets by a cutter to obtain about 40 kg of a<br>
polyester resin (A). The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
The color of the polyester resin (A)-7 obtained in this<br><br>
Example was slightly poor.<br>

orthophosphoric acid and germanium dioxide were added<br>
in such amounts that 40 mol of phosphorus atoms and<br>
0.18 mol of germanium atoms would be contained per ton<br>
of the resin. In this reaction system, polymerizability<br>
was poor, and although the experiment was continued for<br>
5 hours, the intrinsic viscosity did not reach 0.55<br>
dl/g, whereby the desired resin was not obtained. The<br>
results are shown in Table 1.<br>
PREPARATION COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>
A polyethylene terephthalate resin was prepared in<br>
the same manner as in the method for producing the<br>

that tetra-n-butyl titanate was used instead of the<br>
germanium dioxide, and further magnesium acetate was<br>
added. The respective additives were added so that 40<br>
mol of phosphorus atoms, 0.1 mol of titanium atoms and<br>
0.4 mol of magnesium atoms would be contained per ton<br>
of the resin. In this reaction system, the<br>
polymerizability was poor, and even when the<br><br>
polycondensation reaction was carried out for 5 hours,<br>
a polymer having the prescribed intrinsic viscosity was<br>
not obtained, and thus the experiment was terminated.<br>
PREPARATION COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>
Melt polycondensation was carried out in the same<br>
manner as in the method for producing the polyester<br>
resin (A)-l in Preparation Example A-l except that<br>
orthophosphoric acid was added in such an amount that 2<br>
mol of phosphorus atoms would be contained per ton of<br>
the resin. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE B-l<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>
A polyethylene terephthalate resin was prepared in<br>
the same manner as in the method for producing the<br>
above polyester resin (A)-l in Preparation Example A-l<br>
except that ethyl acid phosphate was used instead of<br>
orthophosphoric acid, tetra-n-butyl titanate was used<br>
instead of germanium dioxide, and magnesium acetate was<br>
added. The respective additives were added so that 0.2<br>
mol of phosphorus atoms, 0.1 mol of titanium atoms and<br>
0.4 mol of magnesium atoms would be contained per ton<br>
of the resin.<br>
Then, the polyester resin pellets thus obtained<br>
were continuously supplied into an agitation<br>
crystallizer held at about 160°C for a retention time of<br><br>
about 5 minutes for crystallization and dried in an<br>
inert oven ("IPHH-201 Model, manufactured by ESPEC Co.)<br>
in a nitrogen stream of 40 liter/min at 160°C for 4<br>
hours and then heated for solid phase polycondensation<br>
at 215°C until the intrinsic viscosity became 0.85 dl/g<br>
to obtain a polyester resin (B)-l. The content of a<br>
cyclic trimer in the obtained polyester resin (B)-l was<br>
measured and found to be 2,800 g per ton of the resin.<br>
Further, the volume resistivity was 18*107 Oucm.<br>
PREPARATION B-2<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>
A resin sample was continuously prepared by means<br>
of a continuous polycondensation apparatus as shown in<br>
Fig. 1 constituted by a slurry preparation tank<br>
composed of one agitation tank, esterification reaction<br>
tanks composed of two agitation tanks connected in<br>
series, and a total of three melt polycondensation<br>
reaction tanks composed of an agitation tank and the<br>
subsequent two horizontal plug flow type reaction tanks.<br>
A slurry was prepared by supplying to the slurry<br>
preparation tank 1 an ethylene glycol solution of ethyl<br>
acid phosphate (concentration: 0.3 wt%) in such an<br>
amount that 0.48 mol of phosphorus atoms would remain<br>
per ton of the resin to be formed and terephthalic acid<br>
and ethylene glycol in a ratio of terephthalic<br>
acidrethylene glycol=865:485 (weight ratio). This<br><br>
slurry was continuously supplied to the esterification<br>
reaction tanks. The reaction conditions in the<br>
esterification reaction tanks were such that the first<br>
stage 2 was carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere at<br>
270°C under a relative pressure of 10 kPa (0.1 kg/cm2G)<br>
for an average retention time of 2.5 hours, and the<br>
second stage 3 was carried out likewise in the nitrogen<br>
atmosphere at 26 5°C under a relative pressure of 0 kPa<br>
(0.0 kg/cm2G) for an average retention time of 1.0 hour.<br>
In the two stage esterification process, ethylene<br>
glycol was supplied through a pipe 4 provided in the<br>
second stage esterification reaction tank. In this case,<br>
the esterification rate in the esterification second<br>
stage was 95%. The esterification reaction product was<br>
continuously supplied to the melt polycondensation<br>
reactors via pipe 7. At that time, the discharge<br>
pressure of the transfer pump provided at the pipe 7<br>
was 600 kPa, and the pressure before a control valve<br>
provided before the inlet of the melt polycondensation<br>
reactor, was 150 kPa. At intermediate points of the<br>
pipe 7, to the esterification reaction product, an<br>
ethylene glycol solution of magnesium acetate<br>
tetrahydrate (concentration: 0.6 wt%) was continuously<br>
added in such an amount that 0.82 mol of magnesium<br>
atoms would remain per ton of the resin to be formed<br>
and further an ethylene glycol solution of tetra-n-<br><br>
butyl titanate (concentration: 0.2 wt%) was<br>
continuously added in such an amount that 0.11 mol of<br>
titanium atoms would remain per ton of the polyester<br>
resin to be formed, via pipes 5 and 6.<br>
The reaction conditions in the melt<br>
polycondensation reactors were such that the first<br>
stage was at 266°C under an absolute pressure of 3.25<br>
kPa (25 Torr) for an average retention time of 0.85<br>
hour; the second stage was at 270°C under an absolute<br>
pressure of 0.3 kPa (2.5 Torr) for an average retention<br>
time of 0.90 hour; and the third stage was at 272°C<br>
under an absolute pressure of 0.26 kPa (1.7 Torr) for<br>
an average retention time of 0.66 hour. The melt<br>
polycondensation reaction product was extruded in the<br>
form of a strand from the die, cooled and solidified<br>
and then cut by a cutter to obtain prepolymer chips<br>
having an average weight per chip of 2 4 mg. The<br>
intrinsic viscosity of this chip was 0.54 dl/g.'<br>
Such prepolymer chips were continuously supplied to<br>
a crystallizer maintained in a nitrogen atmosphere and<br>
at about 160°C and held for about 60 minutes with<br>
stirring, whereupon the chips were continuously<br>
supplied via a preheater to a tower-type solid phase<br>
polycondensation apparatus and subjected to a solid<br>
phase polycondensation reaction in a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere at 210°C for 15 hours to obtain a polyester<br><br>
resin (B)-2. The content of a cyclic trimer in the<br>
obtained polyester resin (B)-2 was measured and found<br>
to be 4,500 g per ton of the resin. Further, the<br>
intrinsic viscosity was 0.67 dl/g, and the volume<br>
resistivity was 10xl07Q.cm.<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE B-3<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>
50 kg (260 mol) of dimethyl terephthalate and 32.3<br>
kg (520 mol) of ethylene glycol were supplied to an<br>
ester exchange reactor at 150°C, and as an ester<br>
exchange catalyst, magnesium acetate tetrahydrate was<br>
added in the form of an ethylene glycol solution so<br>
that 4.1 mol of magnesium atoms would be contained per<br>
ton of the resin to be obtained. Then, the temperature<br>
of the reactor was raised to 225°C over a period of 3<br>
hours and held at that temperature for 1 hour to<br>
complete the ester exchange reaction. This ester<br>
exchange reaction product was transferred to a<br>
polycondensation tank.<br>
Then, ethyl acid phosphate and tetra-n-butyl<br>
titanate were added in the form of an ethylene glycol<br>
solution intermittently every five minutes to the above<br>
polycondensation tank to which the ester exchange<br>
reaction product was transferred. They were added so<br>
that 0.4 mol of phosphorus atoms and 0.4 mol of<br>
titanium atoms would be contained per ton of the resin<br><br>
to be obtained. Then, the interior of the reactor was<br>
heated from 225°C to 280°C over a period of 2 hours and<br>
30 minutes, and at the same time, the pressure was<br>
reduced from normal pressure to 400 Pa (absolute<br>
pressure) in 85 minutes, and while the pressure was<br>
maintained at that level, melt polycondensation was<br>
carried out for a time until the intrinsic viscosity of<br>
the resin to be obtained would be 0.64 dl/g, and the<br>
resin was withdrawn in the form of a strand from the<br>
discharge outlet provided at the bottom of the<br>
polycondensation tank, cooled with ice and then formed<br>
into pellets by a cutter to obtain about 40 kg of a<br>
polyester resin.<br>
Then, the polyester resin pellets thus obtained<br>
were continuously supplied into an agitation<br>
crystallizer held at about 160°C for a retention time of<br>
about 5 minutes for crystallization and then dried in<br>
an inert oven ("IPHH-201 Model, manufactured by ESPEC<br>
Co.) in a nitrogen stream of 40 liter/min at 160°C for 4<br>
hours and then heated for solid phase polycondensation<br>
at 215°C until the intrinsic viscosity became 0.78 dl/g<br>
to obtain a polyester resin (B)-3. The content of a<br>
cyclic trimer in the obtained polyester resin (B)-3 was<br>
measured and found to be 5,400 g per ton of the resin.<br>
Further, the volume resistivity was 5.1xl07 Q.cm. The<br>
physical properties of the obtained resin are shown in<br><br>
Table 2.<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE B-4<br><preparation of polyester resin><br>
A polyester resin was prepared in the same manner<br>
as for the polyester resin (B)-l in Preparation Example<br>
B-l except that magnesium acetate tetrahydrate was<br>
added in an amount of 0.1 mol as magnesium atoms per<br>
ton of the resin to be obtained.<br>
Then, the polyester resin pellets thus obtained<br>
were continuously supplied into an agitation<br>
crystallizer held at about 160°C for a retention time of<br>

hours and then heated for solid phase polycondensation<br>
at 215°C until the intrinsic viscosity became 0.80 dl/g<br>
to obtain a polyester resin (B)-4. The content of a<br>
cyclic trimer in the obtained polyester resin (B)-4 was<br>
measured and found to be 3,200 g per ton of the resin.<br>
Further, the volume resistivity was 56xl07 £2.cm. The<br>
physical properties of the obtained resin are shown in<br>
Table 2.<br>

A polyester resin (B)-l was obtained in the same<br>
manner as in Preparation Example B-l except that in the<br><br>
method for producing the polyester resin (B)-l in<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br><preparation of polyester resin composition><br>
Pellets of the polyester resins (A)-l and (B)-l<br>
obtained in Preparation Examples A-l and B-l, were<br>
mixed uniformly at a weight ratio [(A)/(B)] of 0.05 to<br>
obtain a polyester resin blend. The content of a cyclic<br>
trimer (CT1) in the obtained blend was measured.<br>
Then, the polyester resin blend was subjected to<br>
melt-kneading for 20 minutes in a Labo plastomill<br>
("20C200 Model", manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho,<br>
LTD.) set at 285°C at a rotational speed of 50 rpm to<br>
obtain a polyester resin composition (C) . The content<br>
of a cyclic trimer (CT2) in the obtained composition<br>
(C) was quantified. In the composition (C) , the<br>
increase in the content of the cyclic trimer between<br><br>
before and after the melt-kneading of the blend [(CT2)-<br>
(CT1)] was 300 g per ton of the resin. Further,<br>
evaluation of a biaxially stretched film was carried<br>
out to measure the number of protrusions (FE) as<br>
observed on the film. Further, the volume resistivity<br>
was measured. The results are shown in Table 3.<br>
