AIR FLOW CONTROL APPARATUS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to fluid control devices. More<br>
particularly although not exclusively it discloses an<br>
improved pressure cutoff valve for vehicle tyres.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Correct pressure in vehicle tyres is of considerable<br>
importance. Excessive pressure can cause premature tread<br>
wear and loss of traction in the wet. Low pressure on the<br>
other hand can cause loss of stability when cornering and<br>
tyre failure from excessive wall flexing. While most<br>
service stations provide facilities for drivers to check<br>
their tyres the gauges are often defective or at best<br>
inaccurate. In order to alleviate such problems valves have<br>
been proposed for tyres which during filling automatically<br>
cut off the air supply once a preset pressure is reached.<br>
The user therefore does not need to be concerned about<br>
monitoring tyre pressure during filling. Rather it is only<br>
necessary to maintain the air hose fitting on the tyre<br>
valve until it automatically cuts off. These valves<br>
typically use a piston which is biased to an open position<br>
by a compression spring during filling but is moved against<br>
said bias to a closed position when an applied force from<br>
the internal tyre pressure reaches a preset amount of say<br>
200 kpa. Existing valves have the disadvantage however that<br>
the compression spring and piston are located in the base<br>
of the valve assembly which is therefore enlarged and<br><br>
WO 2004/030952	PCT/AU2003/001283<br>
-2-<br>
protrudes a substantial distance through into the interior<br>
of the tyre rim. This obstructs the fitting of the tyre and<br>
can result in the base of the valve housing being damaged<br>
during initial inflation as the tyre bead expands onto the<br>
rim.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to ameliorate<br>
the aforementioned disadvantage and accordingly a apparatus<br>
for regulating air flow into a rim mounted pneumatic<br>
vehicle tyre is disclosed, said apparatus having an<br>
elongated valve housing with an inlet end, an outlet end<br>
and a central portion, the outlet end including a rim<br>
insertion portion configured to fit into an aperture in the<br>
tyre rim, a piston disposed within said housing and<br>
including a valve member, a coil spring acting between said<br>
housing and piston whereby in use of said apparatus the<br>
piston is biased to an open position for passage of air<br>
into said tyre and is movable against said bias under force<br>
of air pressure build-up in said tyre to a closed position<br>
at which the valve member seals against a valve seat to<br>
close off said passage of air wherein the piston and spring<br>
are located within said central portion of the housing<br>
clear of the rim insertion portion so that said rim<br>
insertion portion is of a reduced size not to obstruct the<br>
mounting of said tyre.<br>
Preferably said piston is fitted with a visual indicator to<br><br>
WO 2004/030952	PCT/AU2003/001283<br>
-3-<br>
show position.<br>
It is further preferred that said spring acts in<br>
compression between a flange on the piston and an interior<br>
shoulder of the valve housing.<br>
It is further preferred that the visual indicator is a band<br>
which is visible through a transparent portion of a cap<br>
fitted to the housing.<br>
It is further preferred that the cap is adapted to be<br>
turned down onto a threaded seat to an over-ride position<br>
whereby said band and piston are held to said open position<br>
irrespective of tyre pressure<br>
It is further preferred that the valve housing be fitted<br>
with a schrader type one way valve at the inlet end.<br>

	second embodiment of an automobile tyre<br>
	valve according to this invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring first to figures 1 and 2 the valve housing 1 may<br>
comprise an elongated cylindrical casing with an inlet 1A<br>
at the top as shown and an outlet 2 at the bottom. The<br>
outlet end of the housing preferably comprises an insertion<br>
sleeve 3 with a groove 4 and shoulder 5 which adapt said<br>
sleeve for fitting through an aperture 4A in a pneumatic<br>
tyre rim 5A. Preferably the outlet end is moulded from<br>
rubber or other suitable material to obtain the necessary<br>
pressure tight seal to the rim. At the inlet end 1A there<br>
is a short pipe section 6 of reduced diameter to connect<br>
with an air supply hose nozzle such as that provided at<br>
service stations. Immediately below this is a transparent<br>
cap 7 through which the position of an internal indicator<br>
band (which may be coloured red) can be viewed as described<br>
later.<br><br>
WO 2004/030952	PCT/AU2003/001283<br>
-5-<br>
Referring more specifically to figures 2 and 3 there is a<br>
piston 8 which is longitudinally slidable between the<br>
housing cylinder wall 9 and a central tube 10. The tube 10<br>
is part of a sub-assembly which includes the pipe 6 with a<br>
schrader type inlet valve 11 of known construction. This<br>
sub-assembly is threaded into or otherwise rigidly<br>
connected to the housing at 12. The transparent cap 7 also<br>
fits onto the housing at this location and provides a view<br>
window between the top of said housing 12A and the pipe 6.<br>
As the pipe 6 and housing are fixed relative to one another<br>
this cap 7 takes no load and can therefore be of<br>
nonstructural material such as a low cost plastic. There<br>
are 0-rings 13, 14 fitted to provide a sliding pressure<br>
tight fit between both the outside of piston 8 and cylinder<br>
9 as well as the internal piston bore 15 and tube 10.<br>
Preferably a directional low friction cup seal 16 may also<br>
be fitted into a nich 17 in the piston immediately below 0-<br>
ring 13 to further ensure against air leakage between the<br>
piston and cylinder. The piston 8 at its upper end mounts<br>
the indicator band 18 and towards the lower end the bore 15<br>
is fitted with a valve member having a bevelled head 19 and<br>
upwardly directed needle 20. The needle extends up through<br>
a seat 21 formed at the base of tube 10. The seat is shaped<br>
to form a pressure tight seal when engaged by the bevelled<br>
head 19 of the valve member. There is also a tension spring<br>
22 which acts between a transverse pin 23 located across<br>
the housing just above the insertion sleeve and the centre<br><br>
WO 2004/030952	PCT/AU2003/001283<br>
-6-<br>
24 of the piston. Preferably the spring at one end hooks<br>
over pin 23 and at the other end seats in spiral grooves<br>
around the centre of the piston. In figure 2 the piston is<br>
held to its lowermost position where the band 18 abuts the<br>
top of the housing. In accordance with this invention it<br>
will be noted that the tension spring 22 and piston 8 move<br>
within the centre portion of the housing above the<br>
insertion sleeve 3. This allows the rim insertion sleeve at<br>
the outlet end to be greatly reduced in diameter and<br>
length. It therefore provides virtually no obstruction to<br>
the tyre bead during initial mounting and inflation of said<br>
tyre on the rim. The moulded rubber construction of the<br>
insertion sleeve with the current embodiment also allows<br>
the housing 1 to flex relative to the tyre rim to reduce<br>
the chances of breakage.<br>
In the open position of figure 2 a supply of pressurised<br>
air is able to flow through the inlet schrader valve 11,<br>
down through tube 10, around open valve member 19, through<br>
ports 26, along clearance space 27 between the spring 22<br>
and housing to enter the tyre (not shown) through outlet 2.<br>
As the pressure inside the tyre builds up however a force<br>
(arrow B) acts against the underside of the piston moving<br>
it upward. At a preset cutoff pressure of say between 80<br>
and 1000 kpa determined by the underside area of the piston<br>
8, the deflection constant of the spring 22 and the<br>
position of valve seat 21 the upward displacement of the<br><br>
WO 2004/030952	PCT/AU2003/001283<br>
-7-<br>
piston 8 causes the valve head 19 to close into said seat<br>
as shown in figure 4. This cuts off further air flow into<br>
the tyre. It will also be noted from figure 4 that the band<br>
18 simultaneously moves upward within transparent cap 7 to<br>
indicate that the preset pressure has been reached in the<br>
tyre and the cutoff valve 19 is closed. If tyre pressure<br>
subsequently falls below this preset pressure the piston<br>
and indicator band 18 move downwardly under the tension<br>
force of spring 22 to show low pressure and the valve 19<br>
opens in preparation for filling. Leakage of air out of the<br>
tyre however is prevented by the one way operation of the<br>
schrader valve 11 which only allows discharge through<br>
deliberate depression of insert stem 28.<br>
As an alternative to the fixed transverse pin 23 for<br>
holding the lower end of the spring 22 a threaded anchor<br>
plug 29 as shown in cross-section by figure 5 may be turned<br>
into the housing at the same location. This plug has an<br>
upstanding pin 30 with a circumferential groove 31. The<br>
lower end of the spring is then shaped to seat in this<br>
groove so that rotation of the plug using an alien key or<br>
the like on socket 32 adjusts the spring tension and thus<br>
the cutoff pressure of the valve. A series of apertures 33<br>
around the periphery of the plug allows air to pass through<br>
to the outlet 2.<br>
With the second embodiment of the invention shown in figure<br><br>
WO 2004/030952	PCT/AU2003/001283<br>
8<br>
6 the main items that correspond in function to those of<br>
figures 1, 2 and 4 are indentified by the same<br>
numbers/letters which are however primed (') to distinguish<br>
them.<br>
In this case the spring 22' is still located well clear of<br>
the rim insert portion 3' but now acts in compression<br>
between a circular flange 35 near the bottom of the piston<br>
8' and an interior shoulder 36 of the valve housing 1'. A<br>
cup seal 36A is also fitted in place of the inner o-ring 14<br>
of the first embodiment. With the valve in the open<br>
position shown the piston 8' is held down by the spring 22'<br>
so that air can flow through the inlet schrader valve 11',<br>
down through the tube 10', past the open valve seat 21' and<br>
through ports 37 to enter the tyre via outlet 2'. As<br>
pressure within the tyre builds up a force (arrows B') acts<br>
against the underside of the piston 8' to move it upward<br>
against the compression force of the spring 22'. At the<br>
preset cutoff pressure this upward displacement becomes<br>
sufficient to cause valve member 19' to close off the valve<br>
seat 21'. This cuts off further air flow into the tyre. If<br>
tyre pressure subsequently falls below the preset pressure<br>
the piston 8' moves downwardly under the compression force<br>
of spring 22' and the valve 19' opens in preparation for<br>
filling. During these operations the indicator band 18' and<br>
viewing cap 7' operate in a similar manner to the first<br>
embodiment.<br><br>
WO 2004/030952	PCT/AU2003/001283<br>
-9-<br>
A further feature of this second embodiment is an over-ride<br>
mode which is obtained by turning the cap 7' completely<br>
down onto the threads 38 so as to display a coloured (e.g.<br>
yellow) ring 39. This procedure also simultaneously<br>
conceals the band 18' behind an opaque upper portion 40 of<br>
the cap 7' and holds said band and connected piston<br>
assembly 18' down to the open position irrespective of tyre<br>
pressure. In this mode the device can be operated via the<br>
schrader valve 11' and the tyre inflated to any desired<br>
pressure. Preferably the ring 39 is also adapted to<br>
function as a moisture/dust seal or secondary gas seal in<br>
the event of leakage past primary cup seal 16'.<br>
For installation the threaded sleeve 3' of this embodiment<br>
is fitted through aperture 4A' of the wheel rim 5A1 and is<br>
held in place by a lock nut 41 of any suitable design.<br>
There is also a rubber grommet 42 fitted under the lock nut<br>
for sealing purposes.<br>
It will thus be appreciated that this invention at least in<br>
the form of the embodiment disclosed provides a novel and<br>
useful improvement to vehicle tyre valves. Clearly however<br>
the example described is only the currently preferred form<br>
of the invention and a wide variety of modifications may be<br>
made which would be apparent to a person skilled in the<br>
art. For example the shape and configuration of the<br>
transparent cap and the preset cutoff pressure may be<br><br>
WO 2004/030952	PCT/AU2003/001283<br>
-10-<br>
changed according to application. Also while it is<br>
currently preferred to construct the valve and housing from<br>
a corrosion resistant metal such as brass the invention<br>
extends to the use of any other suitable material.<br>
For the purposes of this specification expressions such as<br>
"top", "bottom", "below", "upper" and "lower" etc refer   to<br>
the valve housing in one position of use as illustrated  are<br>
are not to be taken as necessarily limiting.<br><br>
