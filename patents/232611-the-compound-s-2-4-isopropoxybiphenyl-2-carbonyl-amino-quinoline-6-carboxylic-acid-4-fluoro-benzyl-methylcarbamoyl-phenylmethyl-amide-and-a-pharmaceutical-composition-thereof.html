				<td>The   present   invention   relates   to   the   compound   (S)-2-[(4'-isopropoxybiphenyl-2-<br>
carbonyl)amino]quinoline-6-carboxylic	acid	{[(4-fluoro-<br>
benzyl)methylcarbamoyl]phenylmethyl} amide    and    a    pharmaceutical    composition thereof.<br>
This invention relates to substituted quinoline compounds and the use thereof. The present compounds are inhibitors of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and/or apolipoprotein B (Apo B) secretion and are useful, for example, for weight management and for the treatment of obesity and associated diseases. The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and to methods of treating obesity, atherosclerosis, and related diseases and/or conditions with said compounds, used either alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents, including lipid lowering agents- Further still, the invention relates to certain chemical processes and intermediates that are useful in the preparation of the compounds of the present invention.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Obesity is a major public health concern because of its increasing prevalence and associated health risks. Moreover, obesity may affect a person's quality of life through limited mobility and decreased physical endurance as well as through social, academic and job discrimination.<br>
Obesity and overweight are generally defined by body mass index (BMI), which is correlated with total body fat and serves as a measure of the risk of certain diseases. BMI is calculated by weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). Overweight is typically defined as a BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2, and obesity is typically defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher.<br>
Recent studies have found that obesity and its associated health risks are not limited to adults, but also affect children and adolescents to a startling degree.    Risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure, occur with increased frequency in overweight children and adolescents compared with normal-weight subjects of similar age.  Also, type 2 diabetes, previously considered an adult disease, has increased dramatically in children and adolescents.<br>
Health risks associated with being overweight or obese include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance,<br><br>
hyperinsulinemia, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris. congestive heart failure, stroke, gallstones, cholescystitis, cholelithiasis, gout, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea and respiratory problems, gall bladder disease, colitis, certain forms of cancer (e.g., endometrial, breast, prostate, and colon) and psychological disorders (such as depression, eating disorders, distorted body image and low self esteem).<br>
It has been reported that inhibitors of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and/or Apo B secretion are useful in reducing food intake in mammals (European patent application publication No. 1 099 438 A2) and for treating obesity and associated diseases. See, for example, U.S. patent Nos. 5,919,795; 6,369,075; 6,121,282; 5,712,279; 5,968,950; 6,066,653 and 6,492,365; PCT patent application publication Nos. WO 96/40640, WO 97/43257, WO 98/27979, WO 00/05201, WO 02/28835 and WO 03/002533; European patent/application publication Nos. 0 584 446 81; 0 643 057 A1; and 1 099 701 A1; Wetterau et al., Science, 258, 999-1001, (1992) and Wetterau et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 875, 610-617 (1986),.<br>
Although investigations are ongoing, there still exists a need for a more effective and safe therapeutic treatment of obesity and for reducing or preventing weight-gain.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In the discussion which follows, certain common chemical abbreviations and acronyms have been employed which include: UHP (urea-hydrogen peroxide adduct), PyBroP (bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate), BOC (tert-butoxycarbonyl), EtOAc (ethyl acetate), NaH (sodium hydride), NaBH(OAc)3 (sodium triacetoxy borohydride). HOST (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), EDC (1-ethyl-3-(dimethylarninopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride) and THF (tetrahydrofuran).<br>
The present compounds may be envisioned as being composed of a central quinoline core and left- and right-hand appendages the individual components of which are represented below by compounds D, E and G respectively:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Preparation of the present compounds may proceed by combining E and 0, then adding G to E-D. Alternatively, D and G may be combined to give D-G, which is then combined with E.<br>
Scheme la below illustrates one means for preparing compounds of Formula (I) where -C(R3)(R4)- is -C(O)- and R1 is R1". The corresponding compounds where R1 is R16 may be similarly prepared by patterning compound (E) in the scheme below after R1b instead of R1a as described below.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The carboxylic acid functionality in the quinolinecarboxylic acid (A) is protected using standard carboxylic acid protection procedures well known in the art, e.g., by formation of the corresponding ester, to give compound (g). For example, the benzyl ester (R21 is benzyl in (g)) may be prepared by treating a solution of compound (A) in EtOAc at room temperature with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole to produce the activated, imidazolide derivative of (A), then adding benzyl alcohol to the reaction mixture.<br>
The oxidation of compound (B) to the corresponding N-oxfde, compound (C) may be conducted by procedures well known in the art. For example, the tert-butyl ester of (B) upon treatment with peroxytrifluoroacetic acid, generated from trifluoroacetic anhydride and UHP, provides the corresponding tert-butyl ester derivative of (C).<br>
Similarly, addition of the benzyl ester of (g) to a mixture of UHP and phthalic anhydride in methylene chloride under an inert atmosphere at room temperature gives the corresponding benzyl ester of (C).<br>
The N-oxide (C) is treated with a sulfonyl chloride, preferably p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, to produce the corresponding sulfonate derivative, and the reaction mixture is then treated with a source of ammonia, e.g., aqueous ammonium hydroxide or ammonia in methanol to give the 2-aminoquinoline compound (D). Alternatively, the ammonia may be produced in situ in an organic solvent from an ammonium salt and an appropriate base. For example, where R21 is benzyl, the compound (£)-sulfonyl chloride reaction mixture is added very slowly under an inert atmosphere to a suspension of ammonium chloride in methylene chloride and triethylamine with adequate cooling to control the resulting exotherm and contain the temperature in about the 25 to30 'C range to give compound (D) where R21 is benzyl.<br>
The group "L" in compound (§) is -OH or a leaving group ("LG") such as a chlorine atom or an N-imidazole group. The activated carboxylic acid (E), in which L is LG, may be readily prepared from the corresponding carboxylic acid using materials and methods that are well known in the art. For example, the acid chloride compound (E) where X is -C(R8)- and R8 is an optional substitutuent on the phenyt may be prepared from the corresponding carboxylic acid by treatment with, for example, oxalyl chloride or sulfonyl chloride. The corresponding compound (JE) where L in an N-imidazole group may be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding free acid (E) with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole.   The carboxylic acids of (|E) where X is -C(Ra)- are commercially available (e.g., 2-bipoenylcarboxylic acid, 4'-methyl-2-biphenylcarboxylic acid and 4'-trifluoromethyl-2-bipbenylcarboxylic acid), are known in the literature (e.g. European patent No. EP 0 059 983), or may be readily prepared by one of average skill in the art using materials and methods that are wed known in the art. For example, a general synthesis of acids (E) where X is -C(R')- involves Suzuki coupling between an arylboronic acid (e.g., 4-isopropylphenylboronic acid) and a halogenated benzoic ackJ ester derivative (e.g., ethyl-2-iodobenzoate), followed by hydrolysis of the ester function. Conditions for the Suzuki coupling involve heating the boronic acid and halogenated<br>
benzole acid ester in the presence of a base (e.g., cesium carbonate, 2 equiv.) and a transition metal catalyst (e.g., tetrakistriphenylphosphlnepalladium (0). 1 mol %) in a solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane.-<br>
Also, the acids corresponding to those of compound (£) except that the R8-bearing phenyl group is replaced with a (C4-C7)cycloalkyl group, e.g., 2-cyclohexylbenzoic acid and 2-cyclopentylbenzoic acid, may be prepared as described by Knochel et al (Tetrahedron 2000. 56,4197) whereby ethyl 2-iodobenzoate is coupled with the corresponding cycloalkylzinc iodide in the presence of a nickel catalyst (Ni(acac)2) to give the 2-cycloalkylbenzoic acid ethyl ester, which may then be converted to the corresponding acid by standard hydrolysis (e.g. aqueous LiOH/MeOH/THF).<br>
The amide compound (F) where R10 is H is formed by coupling the carboxylic acid (£) with the amino compound (D). The coupling may be achieved using a number of amide-bond forming methods and reagents well established in the chemical literature. A preferred procedure involves combination of the acid of (§_) with the amino compound (D) in the presence of excess 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbqdiimide and excess 4-dimethylaminopyridine dissolved in methylehe chloride. Another preferred method for coupling the acid of (E) with the amino compound (£&gt;) involves reaction between (£&gt;) and the acid chloride of (£). The reaction is carried out in the presense of a base (e.g., pyridine) using a solvent such as methylene chloride. Methods and reagents (e.g., oxalyl chloride) for preparing the acid chloride derived from E are well known to those of average skill in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the coupling step and the step in which the activated carboxylic acid of (E) (L is a LG) is prepared from the acid of (£) (L is -OH) may in certain cases be conducted in the same pot.   For example, addition, as a solid, of amine (D) where R21 is benzyl to the product mixture formed by the reaction of the free acid of (E) with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole in THF, and heating the reaction mixture at reflux temperature gives compound (F) where R10 is H and R21 is benzyl.<br>
The ester protecting group in compound (F) may be removed to give the carboxylic acid (Fa) or a salt thereof by saponification. For example, treatment of a mixture of compound (F) where R21 is benzyl in 2-propanol with an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide, and heating the reaction mixture at reflux temperature gives the<br>
potassium salt of compound (F-a) where R10 is H. The benzyl ester of compound (F) may also be deprotected by hydrogenation using conventional hydrogenation procedures.   Alternatively, in an example where the protecting group is a tert-butyl ester, it may be hydrolyzed with strong acid such as trifluoracetic acid or a solution of hydrochloric acid.<br>
Compounds of Formula (F) or (F-a) in which R10 is alkyl may be prepared by alkylating compound (F) or (F-a) under standard conditions. For example, compound (F-a) where R10 is methyl may be prepared by treating a solution of (Fa.) (R10 is H) in toluene with dimethyl sulfate in the presence of potassium carbonate, potassium hydroxide and tetrabutyl ammonium sulfate as described in the Examples section for the preparation of the intermediate 2-[methyl-(4'-trifluoromethyl-biphenyl-2-carbonyl)-aminoJ-quinoline-6-carboxylic acid.<br>
The coupling of intermediates (£3) and (£} into the final compound (IA-2) may be conducted using conventional amidation procedures well known in the art such as, for example, those disclosed in PCT patent application publication No. WO 03/002533. In one method, a base such as diisopropylethylamine is added in the cold to a solution of compounds (F-a), (G). HOBT and a coupling agent such as EDC in an organic solvent such as methylene chloride to give the final product amide (IA-2).  Alternatively, the potassium salt of compound (F-g) may be converted into a mixed anhydride, for example by treatment of the potassium salt in EtOAc and TEA in the cold with a solution of isopropyl chloroformate in toluene followed by allowing the reaction mixture to warm to room temperature. To this reaction mixture is added a solution of compound (GJ in EtOAc in the cold (e.g., ~ -20 °C) to give compound (IA-2). On work-up it may be advantageous to crystallize the product from the reaction mixture (after solvent displacement into ethanol via azeotropic distillation of EtOAc and toluene with ethanol) in the presence of an amine base such as aqueous ammonium hydroxide to remove any residual compound (F-a) starting material.<br>
Appropriately substituted intermediate (G_) in which the carbon atom to which R8 is attached is chiral or racemic may be prepared by conventional procedures well known in the art (see, for example, WO 03/002533 supra and U.S. patent No.. 6,369,075).<br>

Compound (J), which is commercially available, is treated with triphenylmethyl chloride in (he presence of triethylamine in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane to give the amine-protected compound (J-l). which is then treated with a Y-halide in the presence of a base (e.g., NaH) in an organic solvent (e.g., THF) to give, after removal of the triphenylmethyl group by treatment with acid (e.g.. 4 M HCl/dioxane), compound (G-2).<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Compound {GJ where R* is -CH2N(RC}(R13) may be prepared as illustrated in the equation below for the compound in which n is 0, R9 is H and X1 is -CH- (compound (£bi)). Compound (J-gb) may be prepared from compound {hi) in a manner analogous to that described above for the preparation of compound (&amp;J.) from (H). Compound (J-2b) is reduced by treatment with, for example, lithium aluminum hydride in THF to give, after removal of the BOC protecting group, the amine (0-4).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
An alternative method for making certain of the compounds of Formula (!) in which Re is -CH2N(RC)(R") proceeds via the azide intermediate (G-31 which may be prepared as illustrated in the equations below.  A solution of compound (J-2) and triethylamine in methylene chloride is treated with methanesulfonyl chloride in the cdd to give the corresponding methanesulfonate ester U~2a). which upon treatment.with sodium azide in dimethyl sulfoxide affords the azide (G-31.<br>

Compound £Gjv3) may 6e coupled with the appropriately substituted quinoiine-6-carboxylic acid derivative (F-aj to give the corresponding amide adduct in which R6 is -CH2N3. Treatment with triphenyl phosphine, then with sodium hydroxide (1 N solution) gives the corresponding -CH2NH2 compound which may be suitably derivatized to<br>
provide compounds of Formula {1} in which R6 is -CH2N(RC)(R13) (see, for example, Examples 5 and 6 below).<br>
Scheme Ib below illustrates an alternative method for preparing compounds of Formula (I) where -C(R3XR'1)- is -C(0)- and R1 is R1a. As above,.the corresponding compounds where R1 is Rtb may be similarly prepared by patterning compound (£) in the scheme below after R1b instead of R1<br>

Similarly, compound (D-G) may be then coupled with compound (£) (L is -OH or LG) under amidation conditions similar to those described above for the coupling of compound (D) with (E) in Scheme la, to give product (IA-2),<br>

The aldehyde (K) was combined with intermediate (G.) in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxy borohydride to give the compound of Formula (I) where R3 and R4 are each H, compound HA-31 in Scheme II.<br>

The drugs are admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier, and any preservatives, buffers, or propellants that may be required.<br>
Many of the present compounds are poorly soluble in water, e.g., less than about 1 ug/mL Therefore, liquid compositions in solubilizing, non-aqueous solvents such as the medium chain triglyceride oils discussed above are a preferred dosage form for these compounds.<br>
Solid amorphous dispersions, including dispersions formed by a spray-drying process, are also a preferred dosage form for the poorly soluble compounds of the invention. By "solid amorphous dispersion" is meant a solid material in which at least a portion of the poorly soluble compound is in the amorphous form and dispersed in a water-soluble polymer. By "amorphous" is meant that the poorly soluble compound is not crystalline. By "crystalline" is meant that the compound exhibits long-range order in three dimensions of at least 100 repeat units in each dimension. Thus, the term amorphous is intended to include not only material which has essentially no order, but also material which may have some small degree of order, but the order is in less than three dimensions and/or is only over short distances. Amorphous material may be characterized by techniques known in the art such as powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) crystallography, solid state NMR, or thermal techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).<br>
Preferably, at least a major portion (i.e., at least about 60 wt%) of the poorly soluble compound in the solid amorphous dispersion is amorphous. The compound can<br><br>
exist within the solid amorphous dispersion in relatively pure amorphous domains or regions, as a solid solution of the compound homogeneously distributed throughout the polymer or any combination of these states or those states that lie intermediate between them. Preferably, the solid amorphous dispersion is substantially homogeneous so that the amorphous compound is dispersed as homogeneously as possible throughout the polymer. As used herein, "substantially homogeneous" means that the fraction of the compound that is present in relatively pure amorphous domains or regions within the solid amorphous dispersion is relatively small, on the order of less than 20 wt%, and preferably less than 10 wt% of the total amount of drug.<br>
Water-soluble polymers suitable for use in the solid amorphous dispersions should be inert, in the sense that they do not chemically react with the poorly soluble compound in an adverse manner, are pharmaceutically acceptable, and have at least some solubility in aqueous solution at physiologically relevant pHs {e.g. 1-8). The polymer can be neutral or ionizable, and should have an aqueous-solubility of at least 0,1 mg/mL over at least a portion of the pH range of 1-8.<br>
Water-soluble polymers suitable for use with the present invention may be cellulosic or non-cellulosic. The polymers may be neutral or ionizable in aqueous solution. Of these, ionizable and cellulosic polymers are preferred, with ionizable cellulosic polymers being more preferred.<br>
Exemplary water-soluble polymers include hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate (HPMCP), carbbxy methyl ethyl cellulose (CMEC), cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), methyl cellulose (MC), block copdymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (PEO/PPO, also known as poloxamers), and mixtures thereof. Especially preferred polymers include HPMCAS, HPMC, HPMCP, CMEC, CAP, CAT, PVP, poloxamers, and mixtures thereof. Most preferred is HPMCAS. See European Patent Application Publication No. 0 901 786 A2, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The solid amorphous dispersions may be prepared according to any process for forming solid amorphous dispersions that results in at least a major portion (at least<br>
60%) of the poorly soluble compound being in the amorphous state. Such processes include mechanical, thermal and solvent processes. Exemplary mechanical processes include milling and extrusion; melt processes including high temperature fusion, solvent-modified fusion and melt-congeal processes; and solvent processes including non-solvent precipitation, spray coating and spray drying. See, for example, the following U.S. Patents, the pertinent disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference: Nos. 5,456,923 and 5,939,099, which describe forming dispersions by extrusion processes; Nos. 5,340,591 and 4,673,564, which describe forming dispersions by<br>
*«<br>
milling processes; and Nos. 5,707,646 and 4,894,235, which describe forming<br>
dispersions by melt congeal processes. In a preferred process, the solid amorphous<br>
dispersion is formed by spray drying, as disclosed in European Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 0 901 786 A2. In this process, the compound and polymer are dissolved<br>
in a solvent, such as acetone or methanol, and the solvent is then rapidly removed from<br>
the solution by spray drying to form the solid amorphous dispersion. The solid<br>
amorphous dispersions may be prepared to contain up to about 99 wt% of the<br>
compound, e.g., 1 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 25 wt%, 50 wt%, 75 wt%, 95 wt%, or 98 wt% as<br>
desired.	'   •	'	,<br>
The solid dispersion may be used as the dosage form itself or it may serve as a manufacturing-use-product (MUP) in the preparation of other dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, solutions or suspensions. An example of an aqueous suspension is an aqueous suspension of a 1:1 (w/w) compound/HPMCAS-HF spray-dried dispersion containing 2.5 mg/mL of compound in 2% polysorbate-80. Solid dispersions for use in a tablet or capsule will generally be mixed with other excipients or adjuvants typically found in such dosage forms. For example, an exemplary filler for capsules contains a 2:1 (w/w) compound/HPMCAS-MF spray-dried dispersion (60%), lactose (fast flow) (15%), microcrystalline cellulose (e.g., AviceP-102) (15,8%), sodium starch (7%), sodium lauryl sulfate (2%) and magnesium stearate (1%).<br>
The HPMCAS polymers are available in low, medium and high grades as Aqoal""-LF, Aqoat|Bl-MF and AqoaF"-HF respectively from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., LTD, Tokyo, Japan. The higher MF and HF grades are generally preferred.<br><br>
The following paragraphs describe exemplary formulations, dosages, etc. useful for non-human animals. The administration of the compounds of the present invention and combinations of the compounds of the present invention with anti-obesity agents can be effected orally or non-orally.<br>
An amount of a compound of the present invention or combination of a compound of the present invention with another anti-obesity agent is administered such that an effective dose is received. Generally, a daily dose that is administered orally to an animal is between about 0.01 and about 1,000 mg/kg of body weight, e.g., between about 0.01 and about 300 mg/kg or between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg or between about 0.01 and about 50 mg/kg of body weight, or between about 0.01 and about 25 mg/kg, or about 0.01 and about 10 mg/kg or about 0.01 and about 5 mg/kg'.<br>
Conveniently, a compound of the present invention (or combination) can be carried in the drinking water so that a therapeutic dosage of the compound is ingested with the daily water supply. The compound can be directly metered into drinking water, preferably in the form of a liquid, water-soluble concentrate (such as an aqueous solution of a water-soluble salt).<br>
Conveniently, a compound of the present invention (or combination) can also be added directly to the feed, as such, or in the form of an animal feed supplement, also referred to as a premix or concentrate. A premix or concentrate of the compound in an excipient, diluent or carrier is more commonly employed for the inclusion of the agent in the feed. Suitable excipients, diluents or carriers are liquid or solid, as desired, such as • water, various meals such as alfalfa meal, soybean meal, cottonseed oil meal, linseed oil meal, corncob meal and corn meal, molasses, urea, bone meal, and mineral mixes such as are commonly employed in poultry feeds. A particularly effective excipient, diluent or carrier is the respective animal feed itself; that is, a small portion of such feed. The carrier facilitates uniform distribution of the compound in the finished feed with which the premix is blended. Preferably, the compound is thoroughly blended into the premix and, subsequently, the feed. In this respect, the compound may be dispersed or dissolved in a suitable oily vehicle such as soybean oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, and the like, or in a volatile organic solvent and then blended with the carrier. It will be appreciated that the proportions of compound in the concentrate are capable of wide<br>
variation since the amount of the compound in the finished feed may be adjusted by blending the appropriate proportion of prerriix with the feed to obtain a desired level of compound.<br>
High potency concentrates may be blended by the feed manufacturer with proteinaceous carrier such as soybean oil meal and other meats, as described above, to produce concentrated supplements, which are suitable for direct feeding to animals. In such instances, the animals are permitted to consume the usual diet. Alternatively, such concentrated supplements may be added directly to the feed to produce a nutritionally balanced, finished feed containing a therapeutically effective level of a compound of the present invention. The mixtures are thoroughly blended by standard procedures, such as in a twin shell blender, to ensure homogeneity.<br>
If the supplement is used as a top dressing for the feed, it likewise helps to ensure uniformity of distribution of the compound across the top of the dressed feed. Drinking water and feed effective for increasing lean meat deposition and for improving lean meat to fat ratio are generally prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention with a sufficient amount of animal feed to provide from about 10'3 to about 500 ppm of the compound in the feed or water.  •<br>

Solid Amorphous Dispersion Formulations MTPI Dispersion Examples<br>
Formulation Example 1.<br>
The following process was used to form a spray-dried solid amorphous dispersion containing 25 wt% the compound of Example 1 ("Compound 1") and 75 wt% HPMCAS-HG (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, AQOAT-HG, available from Shin Etsu, Tokyo, Japan). First, a spray solution was formed'Containing 1.25 wt% of Compound 1, 3.75 wt% HPMCAS-HG, and 95 wt% acetone as follows. Compound 1 and acetone were combined in a container and mixed for about 2 hours, allowing the compound to dissolve. Next, HPMCAS-HG was added directly to this mixture, and the mixture stirred for an additional 2 hours. This mixture was then passed through a filter with a screen size of 200 um, thus forming the spray solution. The spray solution was pumped using a high-pressure pump to a spray drier (a Niro<br>

type XP Portable Spray-Drier with a Liquid-Feed Process Vessel ("PSD-1")), equipped with a pressure nozzle (Spraying Systems Pressure Nozzle and Body) (SK 72-16). The PSD-1 was equipped with a 9-inch chamber extension. The chamber extension was added to the spray drier to increase the vertical length of the drier. The spray drier was also equipped with a 316 stainless steel circular diffuser plate with 1/16-inch drilled holes, having a 1% open area. This small open area directed the flow of the drying gas to minimize product recirculation within the spray drier. The nozzle sat flush with the diffuser plate during operation. The spray solution was delivered to the nozzle at about 190 g/min at a pressure of 140 psig. The pump was followed by a pulsation dampener to minimize pulsation at the nozzle. Drying gas (e.g., nitrogen) was delivered to the diffuser plate at a flow rate of 1800 g/min, and an inlet temperature of 105°C. The evaporated solvent and wet drying gas exited the spray drier at a temperature of 45°C. The spray-dried solid amorphous dispersion formed by this process was collected in a cyclone, then post-dried using a Gruenberg single-pass convection tray drier operating at 40'C for 4 hours. The properties of the dispersion after secondary drying were as follows:<br>

Formulation Example 2<br>
A solid amorphous dispersion of 25 wt% of the compound of Example 1 ("Compound 1") and 75 wt% HPMCAS-HG was also prepared using a "mini" spray-drier. A spray solution was prepared by dissolving 25 mg Compound 1 and 75 mg HPMCAS in 20 g of acetone. The mini spray-drier consisted of an atomizer in the top cap of a vertically oriented 11-cm diameter stainless steel pipe. The atomizer was a two-fluid nozzle (Spraying Systems Co. 1650 fluid cap and 64 air cap), where the atomizing gas was nitrogen delivered to the nozzle at 70"C and a flow rate of 15 gm/min, and the solution to be spray dried was delivered to the nozzle at room temperature and a flow rate of 1.3 rnL/min using a syringe pump. Filter paper with a supporting screen was clamped to the bottom end of the pipe to collect the solid spray-dried material and allow the nitrogen and evaporated solvent to escape.<br>
Formulation Example 3<br>
The following process was used to form a spray-dried solid amorphous dispersion containing 25 wt% of the compound of Example 135 ("Compound 135") and 75 wt% HPMCAS-HG. First, a spray solution was formed containing 9.89 g Compound<br>
135, 29,67 g HPfvtCAS-HG, and 525.58 g acetone. .The spray solution was added to a tank and pressurized using compressed nitrogen to pass the solution through a pressure-swirl atomizer (Schlick #2 pressure nozzle) located in a spray-drying chamber.<br>
The spray-drying chamber consisted of three'sections: a top section, a straight-side section, and a cone section. The top section had a diameter of 10.875 inches (27.6 cm), and was equipped with a drying-gas inlet and a spray-solution inlet. The top section also contained an upper perforated plate and a lower perforated plate for dispersing the drying gas within the spraydrying chamber. The upper perforated plate extended across the diameter of the top section and formed an upper chamber in the top section of the spray-drying chamber. The upper perforated plate contained 0.0625-inch (0.16 cm) diameter holes at a uniform spacing of 0.5 inches (1,27-cm). The lower perforated plate extended across the diameter of the top section of the spray-drying chamber and formed a tower chamber of the top section of the spray-drying chamber. The lower perforated plate contained 0.0625-inch (0.16 cm) diameter holes at a uniform spacing of 0.25 inches (0.64-cm). The drying gas entered the upper chamber in the top section through the drying-gas inlet and then passed through the holes in the upper perforated plate. The drying gas then entered the lower chamber and passed through the holes in the lower perforated plate. The drying gas then entered the straight side section of the spray-drying chamber.<br>
The spray solution was fed to the spray-drying chamber through the spray-solution inlet. The pressure-swirl atomizer was mounted flush with the bottom of the lower perforated plate. The spray solution was then sprayed into the straight-side section of the spray-drying chamber. The straight-side section had a diameter of 10,5 inches (26.7 cm) and a length of 31.75 inches (80.6 cm). The flow rate of drying gas and spray solution were selected such that the atomized spray solution was sufficiently dry by the time it reached the waffs of the straight-side section fhat it did not stick to the walls.<br>
The so-formed solid particles were collected in the cone section of the spray-drying chamber. The cone section had an angle of 58 degrees. The diameter of the cone section at the top was 10.5 inches (26.7 cm), and the distance from the top of<br>
the cone section to the bottom was 8.625 inches (21.9 cm). At the bottom of the cone section was a 1-inch (2.54-cm) diameter outlet port.<br>
The spray-dried particles, evaporated solvent, and drying gas were removed from the spray-drying chamber through the outlet port and sent to a cyclone separator where the spray-dried particles were collected. The evaporated solvent and drying gas were then sent to a filter for removal of any remaining particles before discharge.<br>
To form the spray-dried dispersion, the spray solution was delivered to the nozzle at a pressure of about 140 psi and at a flow rate of about 37 g/min. Drying gas (nitrogen) entered the spray-drying chamber at a flow of about 425 g/min and an inlet temperature of about 111°C. The evaporated solvent and drying gas exited the spray drier at a temperature of 45°C. The resulting solid amorphous dispersion was collected in a cyclone.<br>

The spray solution was prepared by dissolving 20 mg Compound 135 and 60 mg HPMCAS in 8 g of acetone. The atomizing gas was nitrogen delivered to the nozzle at 70°C and a flow rate of about 8 gm/min, and the solution to be spray dried was delivered to the nozzle at room temperature and a flow rate of 0.65 mL/min using a syringe pump. Filter paper with a supporting screen was clamped to the bottom end of the pipe to collect the solid spray-dried material and allow the nitrogen and evaporated solvent to escape.<br>

and 579.26 g acetone. The spray solution was added to a tank and pressurized using compressed nitrogen to pass the solution through a pressure-swirl atomizer (Schlick #2 pressure nozzle) located in the spray-drying chamber, as described above for Formulation Example 3.<br>
To form .the spray-dried solid amorphous, the spray solution was delivered to the nozzle at a pressure of about 150 psi, and at a flow rate of about 38 g/min. Drying gas (nitrogen) entered the spray-drying chamber at a flow of about 425 g/min and an inlet temperature of about 115°C. The evaporated solvent and drying gas exited the spray drier at a temperature of 45°C. The resulting solid amorphous dispersion was collected in a cyclone.<br>

Biological Assays<br>
The utility of the compounds of the present invention as pharrnaceutically active agents in the treatment of metabolic diseases (such as are detailed herein) in animals, particularly mammals (e.g. humans), is demonstrated by the activity of the compounds of the present invention in conventional assays and the In vitro and in vivo assays described below. Such assays also provide a means whereby the activities of the compounds of the present invention can be compared with the activities of other known compounds. The results of these comparisons are useful for determining dosage levels. All of the cpmpounds listed in the Examples section above were tested in either the Apo-B secretion inhibition assay or the MTP (canine) inhibition assay described below,<br>
and the IC50 values for these compounds were found to be less than 200 nM under the conditions of those assays.<br>
Food Intake<br>
Healthy, young adult (1 to 3 years of age) male and female beagles (Marshall Farms, North Rose, New York, NY 14516) weighing 13 -19 kg at the start of the treatment period are employed as test subjects.<br>
The test compound is provided as a powder. The dosing solution, administered by oral gavage. is provided employing a Miglyol/cremaphor/water 20/5/75 solution as the test vehicle. MiglyoFis available from Condea Vista Co., Cranford, NJ. The dosing solution is prepared at 0.5 to 2 mg/mL activity so that    0.5 ml is delivered per kg of body weight at dosages of 0.25 to 1 mg/kg. Following a seven-day acclimation period, a four- to seven-day evaluation study is effected.<br>
The study consists of three groups of animals containing 2 male and 2 female dogs each. Each group of four animals is randomly assigned to receive 0.25, 0.5 or 1 mg/kg test compound. On Days 0 to 3 or 6, each dog receives the dosing solution administered as a single dose at Time 0 on each dosing day via a feeding tube. This is followed by a 10 mL water rinse to ensure total delivery of dosing solution. Each test animal is permitted ad libitum access to water and IAMS Mini-Chunks'5 (The lams Company, P.O. Box 14597, Dayton, OH) dry food each day during the study and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour post-dose.<br>
Reduction in food intake is quantitated by weighing individual food bowls each day prior to feeding and at the end of each 24-hour consumption period during the acclimation period and again during the treatment period. The difference between the weight of the full bowl prior to feeding and the weight of the bowl and amount of food    . remaining at the end of the 24-hour consumption period represents the reduction in food intake attributable to the test compound.<br>
APO B Secretion Inhibition<br>
The ability of the compounds of the present invention to inhibit the secretion of apo B can be determined using the following cell-based assay, which measures the secretion of apo B in HepG2 cells.<br>
HepG2 cells (ATCC, HB-8065, Manassas, VA) are grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Growth medium; Gibco. Grand Island, NY) in 96-well culture plates in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide until they are approximately 70% confluent. Test compounds are dissolved at 10 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). From this stock, the initial dose concentration is prepared in 70% EtOH and subsequent serial dilutions made in 70%EtOH with DMSO at a concentration equivalent to the initial dilution. Dilutions of test compounds are prepared at 100x the desired final concentation and are added in triplicate to separate wells of a 96-well culture plate containing HepG2 celts. Forty hours later, growth medium is collected and assayed by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Apo B. Inhibitors are identified as compounds that decrease Apo B secretjon into the medium. The ELISA assay for Apo B is performed as follows; Polyclonal antibody against human Apo B (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) is diluted 1:1000 in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and 100ul are added to each well of a 96-wel) plate (NUNC Maxisorb, Rochester, NY). After 5 hours incubation at room temperature, the antibody solution is removed and wells are washed four times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/0.05%Tween* 20 (Tween* 20 is available from Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor Ml). Non-specific sites on the plastic are blocked by incubating wells for 1 to 1.5 hours jn a solution of 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% Tween* 20 made in PBS. One hundred microliters (100 nD of a 1:20 dilution of growth medium from the HepG2 cells (made in 0.004% Tween* 20/1% BSA in PBS) are added to each well and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. Wells are aspirated and washed four times (0.05% Tween820 in PBS) prior to adding lOOuLof a 1/1000 dilution (~5ug/mL) of the secondary antibody, mouse anti-human Apo B (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). After 2 hours incubation at room temperature, this solution is aspirated and the wells are again washed 4 times as above. One hundred microliters (100uL) of a 1:10.000dilution (in PBS/1 %BSA/0.1% Tween* 20) of peroxidase-conjugated affinpure<br>
goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME)) are then added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. After aspirating, the wells are washed 4 times as above and 50u,l of 1-step Ultra 1MB (tetramethylbenzidine) EL1SA reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) are added to each well and incubated for 5 minutes. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 50&gt;L of 2M H2S04 and absorbance of each well is read at 450 nm. Percent inhibition is calculated using absorbance from vehicle-treated supernatants minus the absorbance from media alone as the total or 100% value. The percent inhibition at each concentration of test compound is Imported into GraphPad Prism software and !C5 values are determined.<br>
MTP (canine Inhibition<br>

(A). Canine heoatlc microsome isolation:<br>
Canine microsomes are first isolated from canine liver by thawing frozen liver on ice and rinsing several times with 0.25 M sucrose. A 50% liver homogenate (w/v) is made in 0.25 M sucrose. The homogenate is diluted 1:1 with 0.25 M sucrose, and centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4°C for 20 minutes. The supernatant is saved. The pellet is re-suspended in a minimal volume of 0.25 M sucrose and re-centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants are combined and centrifuged at 105,000g for 75 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant is discarded and the resulting microsomal pellet is saved. The microsomal pellet is re-suspended in a minimum volume of 0.25 M sucrose and diluted to 3 ml per gram liver weight in 0.15M Tris-HCI, pH= 8.0. The resulting suspension is divided into 12 tubes and centrifuged at 105,000 g for 75 minutes. The resulting microsomal pellets are stored at -80°C until needed.<br>
MTP is isolated by thawing the microsomal pellet tube and suspending it in 12 ml/tube of cold 50 mM Tris-HCI, 50mM KCI, 2 mM MgCI pH=7.4, and slowly adding 1,2mL of a 0.54% deoxycholate pH=7.4 solution. After a 30-minute incubation on ice with gentle mixing, the solution is centrifuged at 105,000 g for 75 minutes at 4°C. The<br>
supernatant containing soluble MTP, is dialyzed for 2-3 days with 5 changes of assay<br>
buffer (15.0 mM Tris-HCI, 40 mM NaCI, 1mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 pH=7.4).<br>

Donor liposomes are created by adding 447u,M egg phosphatidylcholine (68Ml/20mLs), 83u,M bovine heart cardiolipin (169nl/20mLs) and 0.91nM [14Cltriolein (110Ci/mol) (20u.l/20mLs). The lipids are available in chloroform and are first dried under nitrogen and then hydrated in assay buffer to the volume needed. To create liposomes, lipids are sonicated for -7 minutes. Lipids are centrifuged at 105,000 g for 2 hours and liposomes are harvested by removing the top'~80% of supernatant into separate tube.<br>
Acceptor liposomes are created by adding 1.33mM egg phosphatidylcholine {404uJ/40mLs}, 2.6nM triolein (100uJ/40mLs) and O.SnM [3H]egg phosphatidylcholine (50Ci/mol) (10uJ/40mLs). The lipids are available in chloroform and are first dried under nitrogen and then hydrated in assay buffer to the volume needed. To create liposomes, lipids are sonicated for 7 20 minutes. Lipids are peAtrifuged at 105,000 g for 2 hours and are harvested by removing the top -80% of supernatant into separate tube. (gl. MTP in vitro Hold transfer inhibition assay:         -<br>
Appropriately diluted drug or control samples in 100fil assay buffer containing 5% BSA are added to reaction tubes containing assay buffer, 50ul donor liposomes, 10Ojal acceptor liposomes. and partially purified liver MTP. The tubes are vortexed and incubated on a tube shaker for 1 hour at 37°C to allow lipid transfer reaction to occur. Donor liposomes are precipitated by adding 300(il of a 50% (w/v) DEAE cellulose suspension in assay buffer to each tube. The tubes are centrifuged at -1000 rpm to pellet resin. 400nl of supernatant is transferred into a scintillation vial with scintillation fluid and DPM counts for both [3H] and [UC] are determined. Triolein transfer is calculated by comparing the amount of (14CJ and [3H] remaining in the supernatant to [14C] and [3H] in the original donor and acceptor liposomes, respectively. % Triolein Transfer = ([14C]supernatant/['4C]donor) X ([3Hlacceptor/[3H]supernatant) X 100 ICso values are obtained using standard methods and first order kinetic calculations.<br>
Fat Absorption Inhibition<br>
Healthy female CF1 mice (Charles River) weighing 18-20 grams upon arrival are employed as test subjects. The mice are housed in groups of 10 in standard caging, and are allowed to acclimate for one week prior to testing. Mice are fasted overnight in a separate procedure room prior to testing. Each treatment group typically consists of 5 mice.<br>
The test compounds are preferably provided as a powder in a glass vial. The dosing solution (0.10ml/25g body weight) administered by oral gavage consists of an emulsion of Miglyol* 812 (20%), Cremaphor*(5%) and water (75%). An appropriate volume of Miglyol* (available from Condea Vista Co., Cranford. NJ) is first added to the test compound, and the vial is vortexed for approximately 1 minute. The appropriate. volume of Cremaphor is then added, and the vial is again vortexed as before. The appropriate volume of water is added, and an emulsion is formed by vortexing and briefly sonicating.<br>
Hamster liquid diet (Bioserve F0739) (dose volume 0.5ml/25g body weight) is prepared by adding (for every 10 ml needed) 2.5 grams liquid diet powder, 10 mL water and 5 microcuries glycerolH-trioleate {Amersham TRA191) to a laboratory blender. The mixture is then blended at high speed for approximately 1 minute. The liquid diet is stored at 4°C until needed. Sample tubes are weighed (Falcon 15 ml polypropylene conical). Three milliliters of 2.5N KOH is added to each tube.<br>
Following overnight fasting, each mouse is dosed (see above volumes) with test compound followed immediately by liquid diet. Positive (a known potent MTP inhibitor) and negative control groups (vehicle) are included in each assay. One scintillation vial is sham-dosed every 30 mice in order to determine the activity of the initial bolus.<br>
At two hours post dose the mice are euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation, the abdominal cavity opened, and the small intestines removed and placed in the KOH conical tube. Each tube is then weighed. Tubes containing intestines are then placed in a 75°C water bath for 1.5-2 hours. Following saponification, the tubes are vortexed and 200uL saponate placed in a 20mL liquid scintillation vial. Samples are decolorized (for 30 minutes) by adding 2001 of 30% (w/w) hydrogen peroxide. Each sample is neutralized by the addition of 200ul of 3N HCL Ten milliliters of Ready Safe(Beckman) liquid scintillation fluid are added and the samples are counted on a<br>
Beckman Coulter LS 6500 scintillation system.<br>
The calculations are carried out as follows: ,<br>
weight of saponate = weight of tube (KOH + intestine) - weight of empty tube<br>
saponate fraction = 0.227 saponate weight (density of the saponate =1.1 g/mL;<br>
therefore the weight of the aliquot is equal to 0.22g)<br>
total DPM for the entire intestine = DPM of sample/saponate fraction<br>
The initial bolus DPM is calculated by averaging the counts from the sham-<br>
dosed scintillation vials.	••<br>
The fraction of bolus recovered from the intestine (percent recovery) = total DPM/ bolus count.<br>
Percent recovery from each test group = average of percent recovery from each mouse. Interpretation of results:<br>
To compare efficacy of test compounds, an ED25 for intestinal fat absorption is calculated. The (average) percent triglyceride recovery (percent unabsorbed and remaining in the intestine) of the vehicle control group is adjusted to equal 0%, and the (average) percent recovery of the compound control group is adjusted to equal 100%. The same calculations are applied to the percent recovery values obtained for test compounds and an adjusted percent recovery is obtained (% recovery of the test sample - % recovery of vehicle control group / (% recovery of positive control group - % recovery of vehicle control group)). An ED;S is then calculated by plotting a graph of compound concentration vs. adjusted percent recovery.<br><br>

The mice are housed in groups of 10 in standard caging, and were allowed to acclimate for one week prior to testing. Mice are fasted overnight in a separate procedure room prior to testing. Each treatment group typically consists of 10 mice.<br>
The test compound is preferably provided as a powder in a glass vial. The dosing solution (0.250mL/25g body weight) administered by oral gavage consists of an emulsion of Miglyol* 812 (40%), Cremaphor* (10%) and water (50%). An appropriate volume of Miglyol'3 (available from Condea Vista Co., Cranford, NJ) is first added to the test compound, and the vial vortexed for approximately 1 minute. Next, the appropriate volume of Cremaphor is added, and the vial again vortexed as previously. The appropriate volume of water is then added and an emulsion is formed by vortexing and briefly sonicating.<br>
Following overnight fasting, each mouse is dosed (see above volumes) with test compound. At 1-hour post dose the mice are euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation and blood collected for triglyceride quantitation.<br>
Serum triglyceride values are quantitated using a colorimetric endpoint assay (Wako Triglyceride E kit # 432-4021) on a Spectra Max 250 plate reader with Softmax Pro software. All samples are run in duplicate.<br>
For comparison of triglyceride values, the percent change from control is calculated. The average triglyceride value of the test compound group is divided by the average triglyceride value of the vehicle group, multiplied by 100 and then subtracted from 100%. The ED25 value is than calculated by plotting a graph of compound concentration versus percent change from control.<br>
The relative values of the ED2S for triglyceride lowering and the ED25 for inhibition of intestinal fat absorption are used as a means to compare selectivity of the test compounds.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
