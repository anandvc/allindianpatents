TURBOCHARGER ASSEMBLY WITH CATALYST COATING<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to turbochargers for internal combustion<br>
engines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Internal combustion engines may use an exhaust driven compressor or<br>
turbocharger assembly to increase the manifold air pressure or MAP, thereby<br>
providing increased engine performance for a given engine, displacement. A typical<br>
turbocharger assembly includes a turbine assembly in fluid communication with the<br>
exhaust gases and a compressor assembly in fluid communication with the inlet gases.<br>
A portion of the energy contained within the exhaust gases operate 10 spin or rotate a<br>
turbine wheel disposed within the turbine assembly. The turbine wheel is connected<br>
to a compressor impeller, disposed within the compressor assembly, through a<br>
common shaft. As such, the turbine wheel and compressor impeller rotate unitarily.<br>
In operation, as the exhaust gases rotate the turbine wheel, the rotating compressor<br>
impeller inducts or draws intake gases into the compressor assembly where it is<br>
pressurized for subsequent introduction to the internal combustion engine.<br>
|0003]	Recent advances in turbocharger design have led to the introduction of<br>
so-called variable geometry turbochargers. The variable geometry turbocharger<br>
typically includes a plurality of movable vanes disposed in one or both of the<br>
compressor assembly and turbine assembly, which operate to vary the operating<br>
characteristics of the turbocharger. Such variable geometry turbochargers may be<br>
effective in reducing so-called "turbo lag" in addition to improving the operating<br>
efficiency of the turbocharger assembly over a range of engine speeds. The<br>
accumulation of deposits, such as hydrocarbons and soluble organic fraction on the<br>
internal aerodynamic surfaces of the compressor housing and/or turbine housing may<br>
reduce the efficiency of the turbocharger and possibly cause sticking of the movable<br>
vanes contained therein.<br><br>
GP-308314-PTE-CD<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	A turbocharger assembly is provided having a turbine assembly with<br>
at least one internal aerodynamic surface and a compressor assembly having at least<br>
one internal aerodynamic surface. At least one of said at least one internal<br>
aerodynamic surface of said turbine assembly and said at least one internal<br>
aerodynamic surface of said compressor assembly is at least partially coated with a<br>
catalyst material operable to effect burn-off of hydrocarbon deposits.<br>
[0005]	The turbine assembly may include a turbine housing having a volute.<br>
The at least one internal aerodynamic surface of said turbine assembly may be at<br>
least partially defined by said volute of said turbine housing. Additionally the<br>

aerodynamic surface of the turbine assembly. The turbine assembly may further<br>
include a turbine wheel and variable geometry mechanism each of which may<br>
partially define the internal aerodynamic surface of the turbine assembly. The<br>
variable geometry mechanism of the turbine assembly may include a plurality of<br>
movable vanes.<br>
[0006]	The compressor assembly may include a compressor housing having<br>
a volute. The volute may at least partially define the internal aerodynamic surface<br>
of the compressor assembly. Additionally, the compressor assembly may include a<br>
compressor, impeller, diffuser, and variable geometry mechanism each of which may<br>
partially define the internal aerodynamic surface of the compressor assembly. The<br>

movable vanes.<br>
[0007]	An internal combustion engine incorporating the disclosed<br>
turbocharger assembly is also provided. The internal combustion engine may<br>
include an exhaust gas recirculation system operable to recirculate exhaust gas<br>
through the internal combustion engine.<br>
[0008]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br><br>
GP-308314-PTE-CD<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0009]	Figure 1 is a schematic diagrammatic illustration of an internal<br>
combustion engine having a turbocharger assembly mounted thereto; and<br>
[0010]	Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of the turbocharger assembly shown<br>
schematically in Figure 1.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT'S<br>
[0011]	Referring to figure 1, there is shown a schematic illustration of an<br>
internal combustion engine, generally indicated at 10. The internal combustion<br>
engine 10 may be a compression ignited or spark ignited type internal combustion<br>
engine. The internal combustion engine 10 includes an engine block 12 defining a<br>
plurality of cylinders 14. Although four cylinders 14 are shown in Figure 1, those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that engines having an alternative number of<br>
cylinders, such as 1,2, 6, 8, 10, and 12, may be used while remaining within the scope<br>
of that which is claimed. An intake manifold 16 and an exhaust manifold 18 are<br>
mounted with respect to the internal combustion engine 10. The intake manifold 16<br>
operates to communicate inlet gases 20, such as air, recirculated exhaust gases (EGR),<br>
etc.,.to the cylinders 14 of the internal combustion engine 10. The cylinders 14 at<br>
least partially define a variable volume combustion chamber operable to combust the<br>
intake gases 20 with a fuel, not shown. The products of combustion or exhaust gases<br>
22 are expelled from the cylinders 14 into the exhaust manifold 18.<br>
[0012]	The internal combustion engine 10 includes a turbocharger assembly<br>
24. The turbocharger assembly 24 includes a turbine assembly 26, a compressor<br>
assembly 28, and a center housing 30. The turbine assembly 26 includes a turbine<br>
wheel 32 rotatable within the turbine assembly 26. Similarly, the compressor<br>
assembly 28 includes a compressor impeller 34 rotatable within the compressor<br>
assembly 28. The center housing 30 rotatably supports a shaft 36 operable to<br>
interconnect the turbine wheel 32 with the compressor impellor 34. As such, the<br><br>
GP-308314-PTE-CD<br>
4<br>
turbine wheel 32 and compressor impellor 34 rotate unitarily. The compressor<br>
assembly 28 is provided in fluid communication with an inlet duct 38 operable to<br>
introduce inlet gases 20 to the turbocharger assembly 24. The compressor assembly<br>
28 is also provided in fluid communication with the intake manifold 16 to introduce<br>
inlet gases 20 thereto. Additionally, the turbine assembly 26 is provided in fluid<br>
communication with the exhaust manifold 18 to receive exhaust gases 22 therefrom.<br>
Exhaust gases 22 are communicated from an outlet 40 to an exhaust discharge pipe 42<br>
for subsequent release to the atmosphere.<br>
[0013J	The internal combustion engine 10 includes an exhaust gas<br>
recirculation, or EGR, system 44. The EGR system 44 includes a valve 46 operable<br>
to selectively and variably communicate a portion 48 of the exhaust gases 22 into a<br>
passage 50 for subsequent introduction to the inlet duct 38. The portion 48 of the<br>
exhaust gases 22 may be introduced to the passage 50 either upstream or downstream<br>
of the turbine assembly 26. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the use the<br>
EGR system 44 has proven to be an effective means of reducing certain emission<br>
constituents, such as oxides of nitrogen.<br>
[0014]	In operation of the internal combustion engine 10, exhaust gases 22 arc<br>
expelled from the cylinders 14 into the exhaust manifold 18. The exhaust gases 22<br>
are ducted into the turbine housing 26 where a portion of the energy contained within<br>
the exhaust gases 22 is utilized to spin or rotate the turbine wheel 32. The exhaust<br>
gases 22 are then communicated to the exhaust discharge pipe 42. The rotating<br>
turbine wheel 32 will cause the compressor impeller 34 to spin or rotate by virtue of<br>
the shall 36. The rotating compressor impeller 34 will induct inlet gases 20 into the<br>
compressor assembly 28 where the inlet gases 20 are pressurized and introduced to<br>
the intake manifold 16 for introduction to the cylinders 14. By increasing the pressure<br>
within the intake manifold 16, the density of the inlet gases 20 is increased thereby<br>
enabling a greater amount of fuel to be oxidized and combusted within the cylinders<br>
14 thereby increasing the peak pressure within the cylinders. As such, a greater<br>
amount of power may be produced from a turbocharged internal combustion engine<br>
compared to a naturally aspirated internal combustion engine of the same<br><br>
GP-308314-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
displacement. The turbocharger assembly 24 will be discussed in greater detail<br>
hereinbelow with reference to Figure 2.<br>
[0015]	Figure 2 is a cross sectional view illustrating an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the turbocharger assembly 24 of Figure 1. The turbine assembly 26<br>
includes a turbine housing 52. The turbine housing 52 defines a scroll or volute 54<br>
operable to direct exhaust gases 22 radially inwardly toward the turbine wheel 32 to<br>
effect rotation thereof. The turbine assembly 26 further includes a variable geometry<br>
mechanism 56 operable to vary the flow pattern of the exhaust gases 22 from the<br>
volute 54 to the turbine wheel 32. The variable geometry mechanism 56 of the<br>
turbocharger assembly 24 includes a plurality of radially arranged vanes 58 disposed<br>
about the turbine wheel 32. The vanes 58 are preferably movable in unison through<br>
an actuation means such as a control ring 60. Those skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that other variable geometry mechanisms may be used within the turbine assembly 26<br>
while remaining within the scope of that which is claimed.<br>
[0016]	Portions of the volute 54, variable geometry mechanism 56, turbine<br>
wheel 32, and outlet 40 at least partially constitute the internal aerodynamic surfaces<br>
of the turbine assembly 26. The internal aerodynamic surfaces are surfaces in contact<br>
with the exhaust gases 22 as the exhaust gases 22 flow through the turbine<br>
asscmbly32. Consistent with the present invention, at least a portion of at least one of<br>
the internal aerodynamic surfaces is preferably coated with a catalyst material 61,<br>
shown schematically in Figure 1. The catalyst material 61 must be durable and<br>
activatable within the range of temperature of the exhaust gases 22. Additionally, the<br>
catalyst material 61 is preferably effective in the oxidation of hydrocarbons such that<br>
any hydrocarbon material coming in contact with the catalyst material 61 will oxidize<br>
and burn and therefore not be deposited on the respective internal aerodynamic<br>
surface. This is especially beneficial since excessive hydrocarbon deposits within the<br>
turbine assembly 26 may cause the variable geometry mechanism 56 to malfunction<br>
and/or reduce the flow efficiency of the turbine assembly 26.<br><br>
GP-308314-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
[0017]	The compressor assembly 28 includes a compressor housing 61. which<br>
defines an inlet 62 operable to direct inlet gases 20 axially toward the compressor<br>
impeller 34. The compressor assembly 28 further includes a diffuser section 64<br>
operable to reduce the speed of the inlet gases 20 and a variable geometry mechanism<br>
66 operable to vary the flow pattern of the inlet gases 20 from the compressor<br>
impeller 34 to a volute 68 defined by the compressor housing 61. The variable<br>
geometry mechanism 66 of the turbocharger assembly 24 includes a plurality of<br>
radially arranged vanes 70 disposed about the compressor impeller 34. The vanes 70<br>
are preferably movable in unison through an actuation means such as a control ring<br>
72. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other variable geometry mechanisms<br>
may be used within the compressor assembly 28 while remaining within the scope of<br>
that which is claimed.<br>
[0018]	Portions of the inlet 62, compressor impeller 34, diffuser 64, variable<br>
geometry mechanism 66, and volute 68, at least partially constitute the internal<br>
aerodynamic surfaces of the compressor assembly 28. The internal aerodynamic<br>
surfaces are surfaces in contact with the intake gases 20 as the intake gases 20 flow<br>
through the compressor assembly 28. Consistent with the present invention, at least a<br>
portion of at least one of the internal aerodynamic surfaces is preferably coated with a<br>
catalyst material 61. The catalyst material 61 must be durable and activatable within<br>
the range of temperature of the inlet gases 20. Additionally, the catalyst material 61 is<br>
preferably effective in the oxidation of hydrocarbons such that any hydrocarbon<br>
material coming in contact with the catalyst material 61 will oxidize and burn and<br>
therefore not be deposited on the respective internal aerodynamic surface. This is<br>
especially beneficial since excessive hydrocarbon deposits, such as those that may<br>
occur as a result of operation of the EGR system 44, within the compressor assembly<br>
28 may cause the variable geometry mechanism 66 to malfunction and/or reduce the<br>
How efficiency of the compressor assembly 28.<br>
10019]	The catalyst material 61 provided on the internal aerodynamic surfaces<br>
of the turbine assembly 26 and the compressor assembly 28 may include surface<br>
binding material, precious metals (platinum, palladium, etc), stabilizers, activity<br>
enhancers, and carriers produced by certain thin layer catalyst washcoat technologies.<br><br>
GP-308314-PTE-CD<br>
7<br>
Additionally, the catalyst material 61 is preferably operable to oxidize hydrocarbons,<br>
soluble organic fractions, and/or particulatc matter over a broad range on engine<br>
operating conditions. Further, the catalyst material 61 may provide an amount of<br>
reduction of oxides of nitrogen within the turbine assembly 26.<br>
