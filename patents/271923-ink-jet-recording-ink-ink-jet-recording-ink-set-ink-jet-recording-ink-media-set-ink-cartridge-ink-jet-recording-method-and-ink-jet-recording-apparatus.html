DESCRIPTION<br>
INK-JET RECORDING INK, INK-JET RECORDING INK SET,<br>
INK-JET RECORDING INK MEDIA SET, INK CARTRIDGE,<br>
INK-JET RECORDING METHOD AND INK-JET RECORDING<br>
APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an ink-jet recording ink,<br>
an ink-jet recording ink set, an ink-jet recording ink media set,<br>
an ink cartridge, an ink-jet recording method and an ink-jet<br>
recording apparatus which are superior in increasing image<br>
density, improving color development and reducing color bleeding<br>
on plain paper, and which are capable of recording high-quality<br>
images that are comparable with those produced by commercial<br>
printing such as offset printing, when the ink-jet recording ink of<br>
the present invention is combined with a specific recording<br>
medium.<br>
Background Art<br>
Ink-jet recording is known as a superior recording method<br>
that is not much affected by the types of recorded materials.<br>
Recording apparatuses, recording methods, recording materials<br>
and the like based upon ink-jet recording have been actively<br>
studied and developed. Hitherto, inks containing aqueous dyes<br><br><br>
composed mainly of water have been most commonly used for<br>
ink-jet recording inks. The inks are still most commonly used in<br>
present-day ink-jet recording because they have many such<br>
advantages as follows coloring materials high in absorption<br>
coefficient and also high in color purity can be easily obtained to<br>
prepare them, the inks can be easily made multicolored so as to<br>
widen color exhibiting ranges, the inks' long-term storage<br>
stability and the inks' stability against heat can be secured, and<br>
most notably inks capable of reducing the occurrence of kogation<br>
can he produced.<br>
However, since the dye inks are disadvantageous in terms<br>
of weatherability and water resistance, studies on pigment inks<br>
that contain pigments instead of aqueous dyes have been<br>
remarkable in recent years, and pigment inks are put on the<br>
market these days. Unfortunately though, pigment inks still<br>
remain more problematic than dye inks in color-developing<br>
ability and stability;, and along with the improvements in<br>
techniques for increasing image quality, particularly in relation<br>
to printers for office automation, pigment inks have been<br>
required to exhibit printing quality, hues, color saturation,<br>
glossiness, storage stability and the like on plain paper that are<br>
comparable with those exhibited by dye inks.<br>
Additionally, in general, magenta inks and cyan inks used<br>
particularly as pigment inks contain C. I. Pigment Red 122 and C.<br><br><br>
I. Pigment Blue lo-"3 respectively, and thus pigment inks have<br>
color reproducing ranges that are different from those of dye inks.<br>
Also, in order to reduce hue errors, toning is often carried out, in<br>
which case the color saturation inevitably decreases, thereby<br>
causing a problem with printing quality.<br>
Meanwhile, in order to change hues without depending<br>
upon toning, pigments themselves are improved as well. For<br>
instance, Patent Literature 1 proposes a cyan pigment having a<br>
hue in the same color gamut as that of a cyan dye, by employing a<br>
phthalocyanine pigment with a specific crystal structure!<br>
however, not all requirements are satisfied, as there are problems<br>
concerning costs, etc.<br>
There are many other proposals including the proposal of<br>
Patent Literature 2, which discloses an ink set wherein a pigment<br>
is used for a coloring material for a black ink, whereas dyes are<br>
used for coloring materials for yellow, magenta and cyan inks.<br>
However, pigment-containing inks which have satisfactory<br>
printing properties on plain paper have not yet been obtained in<br>
reality.<br>
Additionally, as an ink set including a black ink and color<br>
inks, Patent Literature 3 discloses an ink set including a black<br>
ink that contains a self-dispersible carbon black as a coloring<br>
material, and color inks that contain coloring materials, wherein<br>
the coloring material for the black ink and the coloring materials<br><br><br>
for the color inks have opposite polarities. Further, patent<br>
Literature 4 discloses an ink set including inks in which<br>
colorant-containing resins are dispersed, wherein the inks have<br>
different ionicities. However, as to printed matter produced<br>
using these ink sets, although bleeding on boundaries between<br>
colors can be reduced, other printing properties on plain paper<br>
still remain unsatisfactory.<br>
Meanwhile, as a low surface-tension aqueous pigment ink<br>
with stable ejection properties and improved wettability, for<br>
instance, Patent Literature 5 proposes an ink-jet printing ink<br>
containing a water-soluble organic solvent, a colorant, water and<br>
a perfluoroalkyl sulfonate. Additionally, as described in Patent<br>
Literature 6 to Patent Literature 8, there are some proposals of<br>
ink compositions for which fluorochemical surfactants are used.<br>
However, all these proposals present such a problem that in the<br>
case where pigments are used for colorants, the colorants are<br>
inferior in dispersion stability, fixation on recording media and <br>
color-developing ability. Also, in general, low surface-tension<br>
aqueous inks with improved wettability (including the inks of<br>
Patent Literature 5 to Patent Literature 8) present such a<br>
drawback that fluorochemical surfactants used in the inks cause<br>
the inks to foam greatly, and thus there are very serious effects<br>
on the ink feeding capability and the ejection stability of nozzles.<br>
As for media, conventional ink-jet paper, particularly<br><br><br>
ink-jet glossy media, can be classified into swellable media and<br>
void-type media; these days, void-type media, which are superior<br>
in ink drying rate, are more popular. As these void-type media,<br>
media each incorporating an ink-absorbing layer that has voids<br>
through which ink is to be supplied onto a substrate, and also<br>
incorporating, if necessary, a porous glossy layer are most<br>
commonly used. As disclosed in Patent Literature 9 and Patent<br>
Literature 10, each of such void-type media can be obtained as<br>
follows-* a coating solution in which silica or an alumina hydrate<br>
is dispersed is applied onto a substrate in one or more layers; and,<br>
if necessary, a glossy layer containing a large amount of colloidal<br>
silica is applied over the layer(s). Paper of this type is designed,<br>
with importance being placed on its compatibility with dye inks<br>
that are most commonly used at present, and the paper is already<br>
widely used as ink-jet paper, particularly as glossy paper. Use<br>
of the paper makes it possible to obtain very high definition<br>
output with high glossiness; on the other hand, since materials<br>
for the paper are very expensive and processes of producing the<br>
paper are complicated, the production costs of the paper are far<br>
higher than those of ordinary glossy coated paper for commercial<br>
printing. Thus, the use of the paper tends to be limited to cases<br>
where high-definition output such as photographic output is<br>
needed; and in reality the paper is difficult to use in the field of<br>
commercial printing where a great deal of output is required at<br><br><br>
low costs, for example in the production of handbills, catalogues,<br>
pamphlets, etc. These days, for the sake of higher image quality,<br>
the number of colors of inks used in printing tends to be increased,<br>
and the required ink absorbability tends to be increased as well.<br>
To increase the ink absorbability of media, it is reasonable to<br>
increase the thickness of ink receiving layers (coat layers);<br>
however, the thicker they are, the more expensive the materials<br>
therefor are, which leads to a rise in the unit prices of the media.<br>
For pigments that form the ink-absorbing layers (receiving<br>
layers), it is necessary to use materials which are small in<br>
refractive index and have low concealing properties, in other<br>
words which are capable of keeping the transparency of the layers<br>
high and which absorb large amounts of oil (have large specific<br>
surface areas). Thus, in reality, there is no choice but to use<br>
large amounts of expensive low refractive-index, high<br>
oil-absorbing pigments such as silica or alumina hydrates, as<br>
opposed to inexpensive white pigments such as calcium carbonate<br>
and kaolin. Specifically, this is because if pigments having low<br>
transparency and high concealing properties are used for the<br>
ink-absorbing layers, coloring materials in inks that have soaked<br>
into the ink-absorbing layers are concealed by these pigments<br>
having high concealing properties, thereby causing a reduction in<br>
density. In fact, when paper which contains a pigment having<br>
high concealing properties is subjected to ink-jet printing with a<br><br><br>
dye ink, density is derived only from a coloring material present<br>
in the vicinity of a surface layer of the paper, no matter now<br>
increased the amount of ink to be applied is; thus, the density is<br>
low as a whole, and an image with little contrast is produced.<br>
Meanwhile, when a material which absorbs only a small amount<br>
of oil is used, ink absorption is insufficient, and thus beading<br>
easily arises.<br>
Accordingly, these days, attempts to achieve a favorable<br>
balance between the refractive index and the whiteness are made<br>
by using fine organic particles having a small refractive index, as<br>
disclosed in Patent Literature 11; however, the fine organic<br>
particles, too, are high in production cost, and so it is still<br>
difficult to obtain inexpensive ink receiving paper which is<br>
compatible with dye inks.<br>
As for the design concept for long-term storage stability of<br>
images produced, since dye molecules themselves are not highly<br>
resistant to ultraviolet rays or ozone, such a method is most<br>
commonly employed that a dye is made to soak into an ink<br>
receiving layer of a medium as deeply as possible so as to<br>
minimize the effects of the air and ultraviolet rays, and the dye is<br>
protected with an antioxidant or stabilizer previously added into<br>
an image receiving layer of the medium. Accordingly, by using a<br>
large amount of ink in which the concentration of a coloring<br>
material is relatively low, deep penetration of the ink is secured<br><br><br>
(ensured) and Image storage stability is maintained.<br>
Consequently, the amount of ink necessary to output images<br>
thereby increases, which not only makes it difficult to<br>
miniaturize cartridges but also raises printing costs.<br>
Judging from the above-mentioned points, in ink-jet<br>
recording, it is very difficult to provide inexpensive ink-jet paper<br>
and a printing method which are capable of high-definition<br>
output.<br>
Meanwhile, in recent years, note has been taken of<br>
pigment inks for ink-jet recording. Since pigments are insoluble<br>
in water, pigment inks in which pigments are formed as fine<br>
particles and dispersed in solvents are generally used. As<br>
pigment inks for ink-jet recording, however, pigment inks in<br>
which pigments are dispersed in water are most commonly used<br>
in view of safety, etc. Generally, aqueous pigment inks easily<br>
cause flocculation or precipitation of pigment particles in<br>
comparison with dye inks; in order for the long-term, storage<br>
stability of the aqueous pigment inks to be comparable with that<br>
of dye inks, various dispersion conditions and additives are<br>
necessary; also, dispersion stabilizers cause kogation; thus, the<br>
aqueous pigment inks are difficult to use with thermal heads, and<br>
also there is such a drawback that many of them contain coloring<br>
materials which are narrower in color exhibiting range than dyes.<br>
Nevertheless, the aqueous pigment inks have been attracting<br><br><br>
more and more attention for their printing quality, such as their<br>
capability of obtaining high black density, and for their storage<br>
stability and water resistance after recording. Ink-jet printers<br>
using the pigment inks are deemed able to approximate the<br>
texture of printed matter to that of printed matter produced by<br>
commercial printing because the coloring materials contained in<br>
the pigment inks are similar to those contained in ordinary<br>
commercial printing inks; however, when coated paper for<br>
commercial printing is actually printed with images or the like<br>
using conventional pigment inks, the pigment inks do not dry as<br>
quickly as they should, and thus the images or the like bleed, or<br>
pigments are not fixed at all after dried, for example;<br>
consequently, as in related art, the ink-jet printers are only<br>
suitable for printing onto media which have high ink-absorbing<br>
properties, such as plain paper and ink-jet paper. This is<br>
because the design concept concerning the formation of ink-jet<br>
images is no different from the concept in the case where dye inks<br>
are used; specifically, the pigments as coloring materials are<br>
merely viewed as dyes having high light resistance, and<br>
characteristics of the pigment inks are not considered at all.<br>
Patent Literature 12 and Patent Literature 13 each<br>
disclose an image recording method employing an ink-jet<br>
recording method in which pigment inks are applied onto<br>
inexpensive general-purpose paper for commercial printing, not<br><br><br>
ink-jet paper. However, the image recording method presents<br>
the following problems; the inks are attached in large amounts to<br>
the inexpensive general-purpose paper for commercial printing,<br>
which necessitates spending a great deal of time in drying the<br>
inks; moreover, in this state where the inks are excessively-<br>
attached to the printing paper surface, the inks having different<br>
colors become adjacent to one another before being absorbed into<br>
the printing paper, and thus bleeding between the different colors<br>
easily arises.<br>
Patent Literature 14 discloses a method in which in order<br>
to produce a color proof using an ink-jet printer, a precoating<br>
solution having a function of flocculating a pigment is attached<br>
onto a recording medium before printing is performed by the<br>
ink-jet printer. However, this method is problematic in that the<br>
process of attaching the precoating solution makes operation<br>
complicated, and also in that when the precoating solution is<br>
attached onto the recording medium, the amount of water<br>
attached per unit area of the recording medium is large, which<br>
easily causes troubles in conveying the recording medium, such<br>
as curling and cockling.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The following explains in detail an ink-jet recording ink,<br>
an ink-jet recording ink set, an ink-jet recording ink media set,<br>
an ink cartridge, an ink-jet recording method and an ink-jet<br>
recording apparatus of the present invention.<br>
As a result of carrying out a series of earnest examinations<br>
to achieve the aim of increasing image density, improving color<br>
development and reducing color bleeding on plain paper, the<br>
present inventors have found that since an ink-jet recording ink<br>
of the present invention includes a pigment as a colorant and is<br>
combined with a fluorochemical surfactant having a specific<br>
structure, the ink-jet recording ink has head ejection stability<br>
and is excellent in increasing image density, improving color<br>
development and reducing color bleeding on plain paper. As to<br><br><br>
the foregoing, it is inferred that when included in the ink, the<br>
fluorochemical surfactant for use in the present invention gives<br>
the ink great wettability, makes ink components other than the<br>
colorant quickly penetrate into the plain paper after ink droplets<br>
have come into contact with the plain paper, and makes the<br>
colorant remain on the paper surface, thereby yielding an<br>
increase in image density; also, it is inferred that since the ink's<br>
great wettability produces a strong effect of making the colorant<br>
remain uniformly on the plain paper, the uniformity of a solid<br>
image portion or the like improves, thereby yielding an<br>
improvement in color development. Additionally, it is inferred<br>
that the uniform penetration of the ink components other than<br>
the colorant into the plain paper promotes uniform fixation of the<br>
colorant and reduces bleeding between colors. Further, it has<br>
been found that this fluorochemical surfactant is, due to its<br>
structure, superior in leveling ability at the gas-liquid interface,<br>
very effective in preventing foaming of the ink, and superior in.<br>
supplying the ink to a head, and has a great effect on ejection<br>
stability in high-speed printing, etc.<br>
As to fluorochemical surfactants in general, there has been<br>
concern over their safety and effects on the environment (e.g.<br>
accumulation of PFOS or PFOA in the human body) in recent<br>
years, and the effects are viewed as an environmental problem.<br>
However, the fluorochemical surfactant used in the present<br><br><br>
invention is accepted by United States Environmental Protection<br>
Agency (EPA) as safe for the environment, and so the<br>
fluorochemical surfactant can be suitably used in terms of safety<br>
as well. The amount of at least one fluorochemical surfactant<br>
selected from compounds represented by Structural Formula (1)<br>
above, in the ink-jet recording ink is preferably 0.01% by mass to<br>
10% by mass, more preferably 0.1% by mass to 5% by mass.<br>
When the amount is less than 0.01% by mass, there is no<br>
remarkable effect on improvement in color development in terms<br>
of image quality. When the amount is greater than 10% by mass,<br>
there is an adverse effect on dispersion of the pigment serving as<br>
a colorant in the ink, which lowers dispersion stability and<br>
causes thickening of the ink and flocculation of particles, and<br>
thus there is an adverse effect on the storage stability of the ink.<br>
[Recording Media]<br>
Next, recording media will be explained.<br>
Generally, ink-jet coated paper (an ink-jet medium) for<br>
realizing a high-quality image is designed such that an ink<br>
receiving layer (coat layer) formed of an inorganic pigment is<br>
present on or near a base surface, and an image is formed as the<br>
ink receiving layer itself absorbs ink (or ink penetrates into the<br>
ink receiving layer). This is deeply related to the fact that<br>
ink-jet recording technologies have been developed based upon<br>
dye inks.<br><br><br>
In essence, dyes are color-developing substances that are<br>
supposed to penetrate into substances with affinity and to bond<br>
with them (covalent bond, ionic bond or van der Waals bond),<br>
whereas pigments have no (or little) bonding force and need to be<br>
bonded by adhesives (binders). Therefore, in the case of ink-jet<br>
recording using dye ink, ink receiving layer material is, in effect,<br>
dyed. This fact has prompted technological concepts, for<br>
example an idea of dyeing an ink receiving layer as uniformly as<br>
possible or dyeing ink receiving layer material as much as<br>
possible using ink-jet ink; in order to obtain high-density,<br>
high-quality images, techniques for soaking ink-jet ink deeper<br>
into ink receiving layers, techniques for combining ink-jet ink<br>
and ink receiving layer material as firmly as possible, and<br>
techniques for achieving a favorable balance between ink<br>
absorbability and color-developing ability have been developed.<br>
As described above, the most common method for<br>
producing present-day ink-jet paper includes forming an<br>
ink-absorbing layer which is porous and highly transparent,' to<br>
realize this method, it is necessary to primarily use a material<br>
having a low refractive index and a large specific surface area,<br>
and in reality the ink-jet paper inevitably depends upon an<br>
expensive material such as silica or an alumina hydrate and an<br>
elaborate production method. It goes without saying that<br>
printing costs are very high, and application of the ink-jet paper<br><br><br>
to mass printing, etc. is difficult.<br>
As a result of carrying out earnest studies on a lower-cost<br>
ink-jet recording method in light of the foregoing, the present<br>
inventors have devised a low-cost image forming method based<br>
upon a novel design concept, realized by combining a highly<br>
penetrative pigment ink and a medium having low ink-absorbing<br>
properties, as opposed to a conventional medium.<br>
Specifically, the present inventors have found that a<br>
favorable balance between sufficient image density and drying<br>
capability can be achieved with a small amount of ink in the<br>
following manner; by conducting printing onto a recording<br>
medium whose ink-absorbing properties (ink penetration<br>
properties) have been reduced so as to prevent a pigment as a<br>
coloring material in the ink from soaking into the recording<br>
medium as much as possible, using a small amount of extremely<br>
penetrative pigment ink, only a solvent (water and an organic<br>
solvent) that is a component of the ink is selectively soaked into a<br>
support, and only the coloring material (pigment) in the ink is<br>
made to remain efficiently on the medium surface.<br>
The recording medium having reduced ink-absorbing<br>
properties in the present invention can be realized by providing<br>
(for example applying) a layer for preventing pigment<br>
penetration (barrier layer) on a support composed mainly of<br>
cellulose pulp, in other words on a paper substrate. By<br><br><br>
approximating the appearance of this barrier layer to that of<br>
printing paper, it is even possible to obtain printed matter which<br>
is similar in quality to ordinary commercial printed matter. It<br>
has been found that by limiting the pore size, diameter, thickness,<br>
etc. of the barrier layer, the ink penetration properties (barrier<br>
properties) can be reduced to a desired level.<br>
In order to promote separation of the pigment and the ink<br>
solvent in the ink, the thickness of the barrier layer needs to be<br>
less than or equal to a predetermined thickness; specifically, the<br>
thickness of the barrier layer needs to be 10µm or less, preferably<br>
5µm or less. When the thickness is greater than lOum,<br>
penetration of the ink solvent takes a long time, beading,<br>
bleeding and the like easily arise, causing the image quality to<br>
lower, and degradation of drying capability easily causes offset<br>
and the like. Also, since it is necessary to make the barrier<br>
layer thin and therefore to prevent offset (a phenomenon in which<br>
the color of a coloring material printed on one side of paper can<br>
also be seen from the other side) of the coloring material, for<br>
example, an inorganic pigment having a high refractive index and<br>
high concealing properties needs to be contained in large<br>
amounts in the barrier layer, as opposed to a conventional ink"jet<br>
medium; specifically, it is necessary for the barrier layer to<br>
contain 30% by mass or more of the inorganic pigment having a<br>
refractive index of 1.5 or greater. Silica, a material that has a<br><br><br>
low refractive index and low concealing properties and that is<br>
used for conventional ink-jet media, may be contained in the<br>
barrier layer; however, if a highly transparent pigment is<br>
contained in large amounts in the barrier layer, offset intensifies<br>
and the cost increases; therefore, it is necessary for the amount of<br>
silica to be 10% by mass or less. Thus, by using a material<br>
having a high refractive index as a white pigment that forms the<br>
barrier layer, offset can be reduced even when the barrier layer is<br>
made thin, and the cost can be further lowered.<br>
Additionally, some alumina hydrates can be used as<br>
pigments having high refractive indices; however, if a material<br>
which absorbs too much oil such as an alumina hydrate is<br>
contained in large amounts in the barrier layer, the ink solvent<br>
does not easily move from the barrier layer to the substrate. An<br>
alumina hydrate having absorbed a large amount of solvent is not<br>
desirable in the present invention because when stored for a long<br>
period of time, it induces discoloration and image bleeding<br>
related to migration of a pigment.<br>
The function necessary for the barrier layer in the present<br>
invention is to separate the pigment and the solvent in the ink<br>
from each other and make only the solvent penetrate into the<br>
substrate. In order for that to take place, it is desirable that the<br>
barrier layer have small holes (pores). If the barrier layer has<br>
no pores whatsoever, penetration of solvent components of the ink<br><br><br>
takes place slowly, thereby easily causing a phenomenon in which<br>
the ink does not dry. Conversely, if pores are too large in<br>
diameter, or the number of pores is too large, the function of<br>
separating the pigment and the solvent in the ink from each other<br>
degrades, the image density decreases, and the pigment which is<br>
present on the medium surface after printing migrates into the<br>
medium with time, causing a change in color. Therefore, it is<br>
necessary for the pores to be 1µm or less in diameter, and the<br>
pores preferably occupy 40% or less of the medium surface in<br>
area.<br>
The pore diameter and the area of the pores with respect to<br>
the area of the medium surface can be measured through surface<br>
observation in accordance with SEM. The pore diameter and the<br>
area ratio can be calculated by binarizing an image of a pore<br>
portion base upon a photograph of the surface. In the present<br>
invention, the field-emission scanning electron microscopes<br>
JSM-7400F (manufactured by JEOL Ltd.) and FE-SEM S-4200<br>
(manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.) are used as SEMs, and<br>
POPIMAGING (ver. 3.51) (manufactured by Digital being kids Co.,<br>
Ltd.) is used for image processing.<br>
[Ink]<br>
A pigment ink essential for the present invention is<br>
required to be extremely penetrative; at 25°C, the pigment ink<br>
has a surface tension of 20mN/m to 35mN/m, preferably 23mN/m<br><br><br>
to 33mN/m, more preferably 25mN/m to 30mN/m. Also, at 25°C,<br>
the pigment ink has a viscosity of 5mPa-s or greater, preferably<br>
5mPa-s to 15mPa-s, more preferably 5mPas to 10mPa-s. As for a<br>
surfactant used in the present invention, one or more<br>
fluorochemical surfactants each having a specific structure are<br>
contained in the ink. The total amount of a water-dispersible<br>
resin (A) and a colorant (B) present in the ink is preferably 5% by<br>
mass to 40% by mass, and the mass ratio (A)/(B) of the<br>
water-dispersible resin (A) to the colorant (B) is preferably in the<br>
range of 0.5 to 4, more preferably in the range of 1 to 2.5.<br>
The following explains components of the ink essential for<br>
the present invention.<br>
The recording ink of the present invention includes water,<br>
a water-soluble organic solvent, a pigment as a colorant, and a<br>
fluorochemical surfactant having a specific chemical structure,<br>
and further includes other components in accordance with the<br>
necessity.<br>
For the fluorochemical surfactant having the specific<br>
chemical structure, at least one selected from compounds<br>
represented by Structural Formula (1) below is used.<br><br><br><br>
Structural Formula (1)<br>
(In Structural Formula (1), R1 denotes any one of a hydrogen<br>
atom, an alkyl group and a perfluoroalkyl group, R2 denotes any<br>
one of a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group and a fluorine -containing<br>
group, Rf denotes a fluorine-containing group, and m and n each<br>
denote an integer of 1 or greater.)<br>
In Structural Formula (1), Rf denotes a<br>
fluorine-containing group, particularly preferably a<br>
perfluoroalkyl group.<br>
The perfluoroalkyl group is preferably a perfluoroalkyl<br>
group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably a<br>
perfluoroalkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in view of safety,<br>
and examples thereof include -CF3, -CF2CF3, -CF2CF2CF3 and<br>
-CF2CF2CF2CF3, with particular preference being given to -CF3<br>
and -CF2CF3. Each of R1 and R2 may be a hydrogen atom, an<br>
alkyl group such as methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group or<br>
butyl group, or a fluorine-containing group such as -CF3,<br>
-CF2CF3, -CF2CF2CF3 or -CF2CF2CF2CF3, with particular<br><br>
preference being given to -CF3 and -CF2CF3 in terms of<br>
improvement in image quality. As to m and n, it is desirable<br>
that m be an integer of 6 to 25 and n be an integer of 1 to 10, and<br>
it is more desirable that m be an integer of 10 to 22 and n be an<br>
integer of 4 to 8 in terms of tbe dispersion stability of the pigment<br>
as a colorant and tbe storage stability of the ink.<br>
Such a fluorochemical surfactant is different in structure<br>
from fluorochemical surfactants (each of which is a<br>
fluorochemical surfactant having ammonium base sulfonates or<br>
hydroxy groups at both terminals of a main chain) described in<br>
PCT/US2006/029862 and US2007/0088101 A; examples of such a<br>
fluorochemical surfactant include POLYFOX PF-151N and<br>
AT-1202 produced by OMNOVA Solutions Inc., which can be<br>
effectively used in the present invention.<br>
Also as to the ink of the present invention, the mass ratio<br>
of the colorant (B) to the water-dispersible resin (A) is reduced<br>
and at least one type of fluorochemical surfactant having a<br>
specific structure is contained as a surfactant in the ink so as to<br>
improve the wettability and penetrability of the ink; uniformity<br>
of coloring material on paper is produced; and at least one<br>
selected from an anionic self-emulsifiable ether-based<br>
polyurethane resin emulsion and an acrylic-silicone resin<br>
emulsion is contained in the water-dispersible resin (A); thus,<br>
printed matter capable of being firmly fixed onto an inexpensive<br><br><br>
medium, of the present invention and comparable with<br>
commercial printed matter can be achieved by a combination of<br>
the ink and the medium.<br>
For the water-dispersible resin (A) able to be used in the<br>
present invention, at least one selected from a polyurethane resin<br>
emulsion and an acrylic-silicone resin emulsion, or a combination<br>
thereof is suitable. Also, the water-dispersible resin (A) is<br>
present as an O/W emulsion when used as a raw material in<br>
preparation of the ink or after the ink has been prepared.<br>
When at least one selected from a polyurethane resin<br>
emulsion and an acrylic-silicone resin emulsion is used, the<br>
emulsion/emulsions is/are present in the ink by a total of 1% by<br>
mass to 40% by mass, preferably a total of 1% by mass to 20% by<br>
mass.<br>
Polyurethane resin emulsions are classified into emulsions<br>
produced by emulsifying ordinary polyurethane resins that are<br>
relatively hydrophilic with the external use of emulsifiers, and<br>
self-emulsifiable emulsions in which functional groups serving as<br>
emulsifiers are introduced into resins themselves by<br>
copolymerization or the like. In terms of a combination of the<br>
water-dispersible resin (A) and the pigment, etc. able to be used<br>
in the ink of the present invention, it is anionic self-emulsifiable<br>
polyurethane resin emulsions that are always superior in<br>
dispersion stability. In the case where an anionic<br><br><br>
self-emulsifiable polyurethane resin emulsion is used, it is<br>
desirable that the polyurethane resin be based upon an ether<br>
rather than a polyester or polycarbonate in terms of the fixation<br>
and dispersion stability of the pigment. For some unknown<br>
reason, in many cases, polyurethane resins that are not based<br>
upon ethers have little resistance to solvent and thus easily cause<br>
flocculation of particles and a rise in ink viscosity when ink is<br>
stored at high temperatures.<br>
The ether polyurethane resin emulsion has an average<br>
particle diameter of 300nm or less, preferably 100nm or less,<br>
more preferably 80nm or less. In particular, by reducing its<br>
average particle diameter to 100nm or less, it is possible to<br>
improve the reliability of an ink-jet printer, for example ink<br>
ejection stability after the ink-jet printer has been left unused for<br>
a long period of time.<br>
The glass transition temperature of the ether<br>
polyurethane resin emulsion is preferably in the range of -50°C<br>
to 150°C, more preferably in the range of -10°C to 100°C. For<br>
some unknown reason, when the glass transition temperature is<br>
higher than 150°C, the ether polyurethane resin emulsion is hard<br>
like glass with respect to its film forming properties, but a<br>
printed portion, formed as particles of the pigment and the ether<br>
polyurethane resin emulsion simultaneously come into contact<br>
with an image support, has unexpectedly little abrasion<br><br><br>
resistance; when the glass transition temperature is 150°C or<br>
lower, the ether polyurethane resin emulsion is soft like rubber<br>
with respect to its film forming properties, but a printed portion<br>
is superior in abrasion resistance. Meanwhile, when the glass<br>
transition temperature is lower than -50°C, the film is too soft<br>
and a printed portion is inferior in abrasion resistance. Thus, it<br>
has been found that when there is no difference in the amount of<br>
the ether polyurethane xesin emulsion added, the range of -50°C<br>
to 150°C is suitable for its glass transition temperature in terms<br>
of the abrasion resistance of printed matter. Additionally, the<br>
glass transition temperature of the resin mentioned in the<br>
present invention can be measured in accordance with either DSC<br>
(differential scanning calorimetry) or TMA (thermo-mechanical<br>
analysis).<br>
The minimum film forming temperature of the ether<br>
polyurethane resin emulsion is preferably lower than or equal to<br>
room temperature, more preferably lower than or equal to 25°C.<br>
When the ether polyurethane resin emulsion is formed into a film<br>
at a temperature which is lower than or equal to room<br>
temperature, particularly at a temperature which is lower than<br>
or equal to 25°C, it is favorable because binding of paper fiber<br>
automatically proceeds without the need to heat, dry, etc. an<br>
image support where an image has been formed.<br>
Here, the "minimum film forming temperature (MFT)" is<br><br><br>
defined as the minimum temperature at which a continuous<br>
transparent film is formed, when aqueous emulsion particles<br>
obtained by dispersing ether polyurethane resin emulsion<br>
particles into water are thinly cast onto a metal plate made of<br>
aluminum or the like and the temperature is increased.<br>
Next, acrylic-silicone resin emulsions able to be used in<br>
the present invention will be described.<br>
The acrylic-silicone resin emulsion of the present<br>
invention is a silicone-modified acrylic resin emulsion which can<br>
be obtained by polymerizing an acrylic monomer and a silane<br>
compound in the presence of an emulsifier.<br>

acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters, fatty acid diethanol amides<br>
and formalin condensates of naphthalene sulfonic acid. Here,<br>
examples of the salts include sodium and ammonium.<br>
Also, as the emulsifier of the present invention, a reactive<br>
emulsifier having an unsaturated double bond may be used as<br>
well. Examples of the reactive emulsifier include ADEKA<br>
REASOAP SE, NE and PP (produced by Asahi Denka Co., Ltd.),<br>
LATEMUL S-180 (produced by Kao Corporation), ELEMINOL<br>
JS-2 and B,S-30 (produced by Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd.)<br>
and AQUALON RN-20 (produced by Dai-Ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co.,<br><br><br>
Ltd.).<br>
Examples of the silane compound include<br>
tetramethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
dimethyldimethoxysilane, phenyltrimethoxysilane,<br>

phenyltriethoxysilane, diphenyldiethoxysilane,<br>
hexyltrimethoxysilane, hexyltriethoxysilane,<br>
decyltrimethoxysilane and trifluoropropyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
Also, monomers generally known as silane coupling agents<br>
may be used as well, and examples thereof include<br>
vinyltrichlorsilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane,<br>
p -styryltrimethoxysilane,<br>
3-methacryloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane,<br>
3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane,<br>
3-methacryloxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane,<br>
3-methacryloxypropyltriethoxysilane,<br>

3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide and<br>
3-isocyanatepropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
In the present invention, the term "hydrolyzable silyl<br>
group" denotes a silyl group which contains a hydrolyzable group,<br>
and examples of the hydrolyzable group include alkoxy groups,<br>
mercapto groups, halogen groups, amide groups, acetoxy group,<br>
amino groups and isopropenoxy group.<br>
A silyl group hydrolyzes into a silanol group, and the<br>
silanol group dehydrates and condenses to yield a siloxane bond.<br>
In the silicone-modified acrylic resin used for the ink of the<br>
present invention, it is desirable that the hydrolyzable silyl<br>
group hydrolyze as a result of polymerization reaction and finally<br>
disappear. If the hydrolyzable silyl group remains, it is not<br>
favorable because of degradation of the storage stability of the<br>
ink that has been prepared.<br>
Fine particles of the silicone-modified acrylic resin<br>
preferably have an average diameter of 10nm to 300nm, more<br>
preferably 40nm to 200nm. When the ink is synthesized such<br>
that the average particle diameter is less than 10nm, the<br>
viscosity of the resin emulsion increases, and thus it is difficult to<br><br><br>
yield an ink viscosity which enables a printer to eject the ink.<br>
When the average particle diameter is greater than 300nm, the<br>
particles clog a nozzle of the printer, and thus ejection failure<br>
arises.<br>
The amount of silicone derived from the silicone-modified<br>
acrylic resin, contained in the ink of the present invention is<br>
preferably in the range of 100ppm to 400ppm. When the amount<br>
of silicone is less than 100ppm, it is impossible to obtain a coating<br>
film superior in abrasion resistance or marker resistance. When<br>
the amount of silicone is greater than 400ppm, there is an<br>
increase in hydrophobic property and a decrease in the stability<br>
of the silicone in the aqueous ink.<br>
The minimum film forming temperature of the<br>
silicone-modified acrylic resin used in the ink of the present<br>
invention is preferably 20°C or lower. When the minimum film<br>
forming temperature is higher than 20°C, sufficient fixation of<br>
the ink on a printing medium cannot be yielded. In other words,<br>
if a printed portion is scratched or marked with a marker, for<br>
example, the pigment becomes separated from the printed portion,<br>
thus smearing the printing medium.<br>
Next, the following provides an explanation of why the<br>
total amount of the water-dispersible resin (A) and the colorant<br>
(B) of the present invention present in the ink is 5% by mass to<br>
50% by mass, and the mass ratio (A)/(B) of the water-dispersible<br><br><br>
resin. (A) to the colorant (B) is in the range of 0.5 to 4.<br>
Printed matter capable of being firmly fixed onto the<br>
inexpensive medium in the present invention and comparable<br>
with commercial printed matter can be achieved by a combination<br>
of the ink and the medium described in the present invention," as<br>
for important factors concerning the ink in the present invention,<br>
it has been found in the present invention thatthe total solid<br>
content of the water-dispersible resin (A) and the colorant (B) in<br>
the ink and the ratio of the water-dispersible resin (A) to the<br>
colorant (B) are necessary factors in achieving the object.<br>
Specifically, the total solid content of the water-dispersible<br>
resin (A) and the colorant (B) in the ink needs to be 5% by mass to<br>
40% by mass. When the total solid content is less than 5% by<br>
mass, the ink is not sufficiently fixed onto the medium used in<br>
the present invention, for example. When the total solid content<br>
is greater than 40% by mass, the ink viscosity becomes so high<br>
that there is an adverse effect on the reliability of the ink in<br>
terms of ink ejection stability and the like. Additionally, the<br>
total solid content is preferably 5% by mass to 20% by mass. A<br>
pigment that contains resin in a dispersed manner or that is<br>
coated with resin can also be used depending upon the type of a<br>
coloring material described below, in which case a resin<br>
dispersant or the coating resin, and the water-dispersible resin<br>
(A) are added together as the resin solid content (A).<br><br><br>
As for the fact that the mass ratio (A)/(B) of the<br>
water-dispersible resin. (A) to the colorant (B) is in the range of<br>
0.5 to 4, when the mass ratio is less than 0.5, the ink is not<br>
sufficiently fixed onto the medium used in the present invention,<br>
for example; when the mass ratio is greater than 4, the<br>
concentration of the coloring material is so low with respect to<br>
that of the resin that there are degradations of image quality<br>
such as a decrease in image density and a reduction in image<br>
uniformity. For this reason, in view of the medium used in the<br>
present invention, important factors concerning the ink used in<br>
the present invention are that the total amount of the<br>
water-dispersible resin (A) and the colorant (B) in the ink is 5%<br>
by mass to 40% by mass, and that the mass ratio (A)/(B) of the<br>
water-dispersible resin (A) to the colorant (B) is in the range of<br>
0.5 to 4. It is more desirable that the mass ratio be in the range<br>
of 1 to 2.5 in terms of image quality.<br>
Next, components constituting the ink of the present<br>
invention, and compositions thereof will be described.<br>

The pigment ink essential for the present invention<br>
includes at least water, a colorant in the form of particles, a<br>
fixative for the colorant, and a water-soluble organic solvent, also<br>
includes a wetting agent and a surfactant, and further includes<br>
other components in accordance with the necessity.<br>
As to the object of the present invention, a fluorochemical<br>
surfactant having a specific structure is used as the surfactant,<br>
the mass ratio of the colorant (B) to the water-dispersible resin<br>
(A) is lowered, and at least one selected from an anionic<br>
self-emulsifiable ether-based polyurethane resin emulsion and an<br>
acrylic-silicone resin emulsion is contained in the<br><br><br>
water-dispersible resin; thus, printed matter capable of being<br>
firmly fixed onto the inexpensive medium of the present<br>
invention and comparable with commercial printed matter can be<br>
achieved by a combination of the ink and the medium.<br>
Examples of the colorant (B) include dyes such as<br>
water-soluble dyes, oil-soluble dyes and disperse dyes, and the<br>
pigment. Oil-soluble dyes and disperse dyes are preferable in<br>
terms of adsorption and encapsulation, while the pigment is<br>
preferable in terms of the light resistance of images obtained.<br>
It is desirable that each of the dyes dissolve in an organic<br>
solvent, e.g. a ketone-based solvent, at a rate of 2g/l or greater,<br>
more desirably at a rate of 20g/l to 600g/l, in view of the fact that<br>
the dyes can be efficiently encapsulated in fine polymer particles.<br>
The colorant (B) used in the present invention will be<br>
explained below.<br>
Examples of the pigment used in the present invention<br>
include the following; as a black pigment, carbon black." as color<br>
pigments, anthraquinone, phthalocyanine blue, phthalocyanine<br>
green, diazo, monoazo, pyranthron, perylene, heterocyclic yellow,<br>
quinacridone and (thio)indigoid. Typical examples of<br>
phthalocyanine blue include copper phthalocyanine blue and<br>
derivatives thereof (Pigment Blue 15). Typical examples of<br>
quinacridone include Pigment Orange 48, Pigment Orange 49,<br>
Pigment Red 122, Pigment Red 192, Pigment Red 202, Pigment<br><br><br>

Typical examples of thioindigoid include Pigment Red 86,<br>
Pigment Red 87, Pigment Red 88, Pigment Red 181, Pigment Red<br>
198, Pigment Violet 36 and Pigment Violet 38. Typical examples<br>

Yellow 138. Other suitable examples of coloring pigments are<br>
described in "The Colour Index, third ed., The Society of Dyers<br>
and Colourists, 1982", for instance.<br>
For the pigment in the ink of the present invention, it is<br>
possible to use a pigment that is provided with at least one<br>
hydrophilic group, which is bonded to the pigment surface<br>
directly or via other atomic group, and that can therefore be<br>
stably dispersed without using a dispersant. The pigment of the<br>
present invention provided with a hydrophilic group, which is<br>
introduced onto the pigment surface, preferably has ionic<br>
properties, and an anionically charged pigment or a cationically<br>
charged pigment is suitable for the pigment.<br><br><br>
Examples of anionic hydrophilic groups include -COOM,<br>
-SO3M, -PO3HM, -PO3M2, -SO2NH2 and -SO2NHCOR (in these<br>
formulae, M denotes a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal,<br>
ammonium or an organic ammonium, and R denotes an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a phenyl group that may have<br>
a substituent, or a naphthyl group that may have a substituent).<br>
In the present invention, among these, use of—COOM and —SO3M,<br>
each of which is bonded to the pigment surface, is particularly<br>
preferable. Examples of methods for obtaining an anionically<br>
charged pigment include a method of oxidizing a pigment with<br>
sodium hypochlorite, a method utilizing sulfonation, and a<br>
method of making a pigment and a diazonium salt react together;<br>
however, it should be noted that the present invention may<br>
employ other methods.<br>
As the hydrophilic group bonded to the surface of the<br>
cationically charged pigment, a quaternary ammonium group can<br>
be used, for instance. Ideally, a.pigment provided with at least<br>
one of the following quaternary ammonium groups, which is<br>
bonded to the pigment surface, is used as the pigment.<br>
As to the pigment used in the ink of the present invention,<br>
a pigment dispersion in which the pigment is dispersed in an<br>
aqueous medium by a dispersant can also be used. Suitable<br>
examples of the dispersant include known dispersants used in<br>
preparing pigment dispersion solutions; specifically, the suitable<br><br><br>
examples include the following compounds.<br>
Polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, acrylic<br>
acid-acrylonitrile copolymers, vinyl acetate-acrylic acid ester<br>
copolymers, acrylic acid-acrylic acid alkyl ester copolymers,<br>
styrene-acrylic acid copolymers, styrene-methacrylic acid<br>
copolymers, styrene-acrylic acid-acrylic acid alkyl ester<br>
copolymers, styrene-methacrylic acid-acrylic acid alkyl ester<br>
copolymers, styrene-crmethylstyrene-acrylic acid copolymers,<br>

copolymers, vinyl acetate-fatty acid vinyl ethylene copolymers,<br>
vinyl acetate-maleic acid ester copolymers, vinyl acetate-crotonic<br>
acid copolymers and vinyl acetate-acrylic acid copolymers.<br>
A nonionic dispersant or an anionic dispersant used to<br>
disperse the pigment may be suitably selected according to the<br>
type of the pigment or the ink formulation." examples of the<br>
nonionic dispersant include polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers such as<br>
polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene myristyl ether,<br>
polyoxy ethylene cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene stearyl ether and<br>
polyoxyethylene oleyl ether; polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers<br>
such as polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether and polyoxyethylene<br>
nonylphenyl ether; polyoxyethylene crnaphthyl ether,<br>
polyoxyethylene p-naphthyl ether, polyoxyethylene<br><br><br>
monostyrylphenyl ether, polyoxyethylene distyrylphenyl ether,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkylnaphthyl ether, polyoxyethylene<br>
monostyrylnaphthyl ether, polyoxyethylene distyrylnaphthyl<br>
ether, and polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymers.<br>
Also, it is possible to use dispersants produced by replacing part<br>
of the polyoxyethylene of these dispersants with<br>
polyoxypropylene, and dispersants produced by condensing<br>
aromatic ring-containing compounds such as polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylphenyl ethers, using formalin or the like.<br>
The HLB of the nonionic dispersant is preferably in the<br>
range of 12 to 19.5, more preferably in the range of 13 to 19.<br>
When the HLB is less than 12, the dispersant is not compatible<br>
with the dispersion medium, and thus the dispersion stability<br>
tends to degrade. When the HLB is greater than 19.5, the<br>
dispersant does not easily adsorb to the pigment, and thus the<br>
dispersion stability tends to degrade in this case as well.<br>
It is particularly desirable that the nonionic dispersant be<br>
selected from compounds represented by Structural Formula (2)<br>
below. By dispersing the pigment with the use of any of these<br>
compounds, the average particle diameter of the pigment becomes<br>
small, and the particle size distribution can be made narrower.<br>
The polymerization degree n of the ethylene oxide moiety in<br>
Structural Formula (2) given below is preferably in the range of<br>
20 to 200, more preferably in the range of 25 to 60. In the case<br><br><br>
where a is less than 20, the dispersion stability lowers, the<br>
average particle diameter of the pigment becomes large, and the<br>
color saturation of images tends to decrease. In the case where<br>
n is greater than 200, the viscosity of the pigment dispersion<br>
becomes high, the ink viscosity becomes high as well when an ink<br>
has been prepared, and printing based upon an ink-jet recording<br>
method tends to become difficult to achieve.<br><br>
Structural Formula (2)<br>
(In Structural Formula (2), E denotes an alkyl group having 1 to<br>
20 carbon atoms, m denotes an integer of 0 to 7, and n denotes an<br>
integer of 20 to 200.)<br>
Examples of the alkyl group include methyl group, ethyl<br>
group, n-propyl group, i-propyl group, n-butyl group, i-butyl<br>
group, t-butyl group, n-pentyl group, i-pentyl group, n-hexyl<br>
group, i-hexyl group, n-heptyl group, i-heptyl group, n-octyl<br>
group, i-octyl group, n-nonyl group, i-nonyl group, n-decyl group,<br>
i-decyl group, n-undecyl group, i-undecyl group, n-dodecyl group,<br>
i-dodecyl group, cyclopropyl group, cyclobutyl group, cyclopentyl<br><br>
group, cyclohexyl group, cycloheptyl group and cyclooctyl group.<br>
Examples of the anionic dispersant include<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfates, polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylphenyl ether sulfates, polyoxyethylene monostyrylphenyl<br>
ether sulfates, polyoxyethylene distyrylphenyl ether sulfates,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl ether phosphates, polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylphenyl ether phosphates, polyoxyethylene monostyrylphenyl<br>
ether phosphates, polyoxyethylene distyrylphenyl ether<br>
phosphates, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether carhoxylates,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ether carhoxylates, polyoxyethylene<br>
monostyrylphenyl ether carhoxylates, polyoxyethylene<br>
distyrylphenyl ether carhoxylates, formalin condensates of<br>
naphthalene sulfonates, formalin condensates of melanin<br>
sulfonates, dialkylsulfosuccinic acid ester salts, disodium alkyl<br>
sulfosuccinates, disodium polyoxyethylene alkylsulfosuccinates,<br>
alkylsulfoacetates, α-olefin sulfonates, alkyl henzene sulfonates,<br>
alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, alkyl sulfonates, N-acylamino acid<br>
salts, acylated dipeptides and soaps. Among these, particular<br>
preference is given to sulfates and phosphates of polyoxyethylene<br>
alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers and<br>
polyoxyethylene distyrylphenyl ethers.<br>
The amount of the dispersant added preferably equals 10%<br>
by mass to 50% by mass of the amount of the pigment. When the<br>
amount of the dispersant added equals less than 10% by mass of<br><br><br>
the amount of the pigment, the storage stability of the pigment<br>
dispersion and the ink lowers, or dispersion takes a great deal of<br>
time. When the amount of the dispersant added equals more<br>
than 50% by mass of the amount of the pigment, the ink viscosity<br>
becomes too high, and thus the ejection stability tends to lower.<br>
Further, for the colorant (B), a resin-coated colorant can<br>
also he suitably used as explained below.<br>
The resin-coated colorant is made of a polymer emulsion in<br>
which fine polymer particles contain a coloring material which is<br>
insoluble or sparingly soluble in water. In the present<br>
specification, the expression "fine polymer particles contain a<br>
coloring material" means either or both of a state in which the<br>
coloring material is encapsulated in the fine polymer particles,<br>
and a state in which the coloring material is adsorbed on the<br>
surface of the fine polymer particles. In this case, it is not that<br>
all of the coloring material included in the ink of the present<br>
invention needs to be encapsulated in or adsorbed on the fine<br>
polymer particles but that the coloring material may be dispersed<br>
in the emulsion to such an extent that the effects of the present<br>
invention are not impaired. The coloring material is not<br>
particularly limited and may be suitably selected in accordance<br>
with the intended use, as long as it is insoluble or sparingly<br>
soluble in water and can be adsorbed by the polymer. In the<br>
present specification, the expression "insoluble or sparingly<br><br><br>
soluble in water" means that not more than 10 parts by mass of<br>
the coloring material dissolves in 100 parts by mass of water at<br>
20°C, whereas the term "dissolve" means that neither division<br>
nor sedimentation of the coloring material is confirmed at the<br>
surface layer or bottom layer of the aqueous solution by visual<br>
observation. Examples of the coloring material include dyes<br>
such as oil-soluble dyes and disperse dyes, and the pigment.<br>
Oil-soluble dyes and disperse dyes are preferable in terms of<br>
adsorption and encapsulation, while the pigment is preferable in<br>
terms of the light resistance of images obtained.<br>
It is desirable that the colorant of the present invention<br>
dissolve in an organic solvent, e.g. a ketone-based solvent, at a<br>
rate of 2g/l or greater, more desirably at a rate of 20g/l to 600g/l,<br>
in view of the fact that the colorant can be efficiently<br>
encapsulated in fine polymer particles. Examples of the polymer<br>
constituting the polymer emulsion include vinyl-based polymers,<br>
polyester-based polymers and polyurethane-based polymers.<br>
Among these, particular preference is given to vinyl-based<br>
polymers and polyester-based polymers, specifically the polymers<br>
disclosed in JP-A Nos. 2000-53897 and 2001-139849. The<br>
amount of the colorant is preferably 10 parts by mass to 200 parts<br>
by mass, more preferably 25 parts by mass to 150 parts by mass,<br>
per 100 parts by mass of the polymer. The fine polymer particles<br>
containing the colorant preferably have an average diameter of<br><br><br>
0.16µm or less in the ink.<br>
The amount of the fine polymer particles contained in the<br>
recording ink is preferably 8% by mass to 20% by mass, more<br>
preferably 8% by mass to 12% by mass, as a solid content.<br>
As the colorant used in the present invention, the pigment<br>
is most favorable. Meanwhile, for the resin-coated colorant, a<br>
dye can be used as well. The following shows a set of examples<br>
of water-soluble dyes. It is desirable that those superior in<br>
water resistance and light resistance be used.<br>

dyes such as C.I. Acid Yellow 17, 23, 42, 44, 79 and 142; C.I. Acid<br>

In the present invention, use of a surfactant, notably the<br>
fluorochemical surfactant having a specific structure, makes it<br>
possible to improve the wettability and penetrability of the ink to<br>
recording paper. Fluorochemical surfactants are generally<br>
known to have high foaming properties, and inks containing those<br>
fluorochemical surfactants easily foam in many cases, causing<br>
adverse effects on the ink feeding capability and the ink ejection<br>
stability." however, the fluorochemical surfactant having a<br>
specific structure in the present invention is reduced in foaming<br>
property, superior in ink feeding capability and ink ejection<br>
stability and excellent in safety, and makes it possible to yield<br>
high color-developing properties and uniformity of a coloring<br><br><br>
material on the ink-jet recording medium, used in. the present<br>
patent and reduce beading greatly, and thus excellent images can<br>
be obtained. Although details as to why its effectiveness can be<br>
obtained are not known, it is inferred that the fluorochemical<br>
surfactant having a specific structure in the present invention is,<br>
due to its structure, superior in leveling ability, highly effective<br>
in making uniform the surface tension at the gas-liquid interface,<br>
and therefore superior in antifoaming ability, and that the<br>
leveling ability has an effect of evenly dispersing the coloring<br>
material and evenly enlarging image element diameters in a wet<br>
manner on the ink-jet recording medium, which enables beading<br>
to be greatly reduced, thereby making it possible to provide an<br>
ink-jet recording ink, an ink-jet recording ink set, an ink-jet<br>
recording ink media set, an ink cartridge, an ink-jet recording<br>
method and an ink-jet recording apparatus, wherein a<br>
combination of the ink-jet pigment ink and the ink-jet recording<br>
medium shown in the present invention makes it possible to<br>
obtain printed matter which is inexpensive, excellent in quality,<br>
superior in density, glossiness and image reliability and<br>
comparable with commercial printed matter, and it is possible to<br>
secure superior reliability in terms of ejection stability, storage<br>
stability and the like.<br>
In addition to the fluorochemical surfactant represented<br>
by Structural Formula (1) in the present invention, any of the<br><br><br>
following fluorochemical surfactants can be used: perfluoroalkyl<br>
sulfonates, perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, perfluoroalkyl<br>
phosphoric acid esters, perfluoroalkyl ethylene oxide adducts,<br>
perfluoroalkyl betaine, perfluoroalkyl amine oxide compounds<br>
and the like. Examples of those which are commercially<br>
available as fluorine-based compounds, easily obtainable and<br>
able to be used in the present invention include SURFLON S-lll,<br>
S-112, S-113, S121, S131, S132, S-141, S-145 and S-386 (produced<br>
by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.), FLUORAD FC-93, F095, FC-98,<br>
FC-129, FC-135, FC-170C, FO430, FC-431 and FC-4430<br>
(produced by Sumitomo 3M Limited), MEGAFAC F-470, F-1405<br>
and F474 (produced by Dainippon Ink And Chemicals,<br>
Incorporated), ZONYL FS-300, FSN, FSN-100 and FSO (produced<br>
by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company), and EFTOP EF-351,<br>
352, 801 and 802 (produced by JEMCO Inc.). Among these,<br>
particular preference is given to ZONYL FS-300, FSN, FSN-100<br>
and FSO (produced by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company),<br>
which are excellent in reliability and improving color<br>
development.<br>
Examples of surfactants able to be used in addition to the<br>
above-mentioned fluorochemical surfactants include interfacial<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetates, dialkyl sulfosuccinates,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl esters, polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers,<br>
polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymers,<br><br><br>
polyoxyetnylene alkyl esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid<br>
esters and acetylene glycol-based surfactants. More specifically,<br>
as to anionic surfactants, use of a polyoxyetnylene alkyl ether<br>
acetate and/or a dialkyl sulfosuccinate having a branched alkyl<br>
chain whose carbon chain has 5 to 7 carbon atoms makes it<br>
possible to improve the wettability of the ink to plain paper.<br>
Note that any of these surfactants can be stably present in the<br>
ink of the present invention without disturbing the dispersed<br>
state of ingredients. The amount of any of these other<br>
surfactants added is preferably in the range of 0.0001% by mass<br>
to 5% by mass, and is preferably in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 (as an<br>
active solid content mass ratio) per 1 of the surfactant in<br>
Structural Formula (1).<br>
A polyol having 7 to 11 carbon atoms, used as a penetrant<br>
in the present invention, can be any one of 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol<br>
and 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3"pentanediol, for example. The amount<br>
of the polyol added is preferably in the range of 0.1% by mass to<br>
20% by mass, more preferably in the range of 0.5% by mass to<br>
10% by mass. When the amount is smaller than or equal to the<br>
lower limit, the penetrability of the ink to paper degrades;<br>
therefore, the paper may be smeared when conveyed, as recorded<br>
matter is possibly scratched by a roller, or the paper may be<br>
smeared when reversed for double-sided printing, as the ink is<br>
possibly attached to a conveyance belt, and thus it is impossible<br><br><br>
to secure sufficient adaptability to high-speed printing or<br>
double-sided printing-. When the amount is greater than or<br>
equal to the upper limit, there may be an increase in printing dot<br>
diameter, thereby possibly causing the line width of<br>
letters/characters to increase, or causing the image clarity to<br>
decrease.<br>
Examples of additives include an antifungal agent, an<br>
antirust agent and a pH adjuster.<br>
Use of l,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one as an antifungal agent<br>
makes it possible to provide an ink capable of securing reliability<br>
in terms of storage stability, ejection stability and the like, and<br>
superior in antifungal effect. Especially when combined with<br>
the wetting agent of the present invention, the antifungal agent<br>
can be sufficiently effective even if its amount is deemed too<br>
small in related art to reduce the generation of germs or fungi;<br>
thus, by reducing the amount of the antifungal agent added, it<br>
becomes possible to prevent such phenomena as flocculation of<br>
particles and thickening of ink, and so the performance of the ink<br>
can be maintained for a long period of time. As an active<br>
ingredient amount, the amount of 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one<br>
added is preferably 0.01 parts by mass to 0.04 parts by mass in<br>
relation to the total amount of the ink. In the case where the<br>
amount is less than 0.01 parts by mass, there is a slight reduction<br>
in antifungal property. In the case where the amount is 0.04<br><br><br>
parts by mass or greater, flocculation of particles arises or the ink<br>
viscosity increases by 50% to 100% in comparison with the initial<br>
ink viscosity, when the ink is stored for a long period of time (e.g.<br>
for two years at room temperature, or for one to three months at a<br>
temperature of 50°C to 60°C), for example; hence, there is a<br>
problem with the long-term storage stability of the ink, and the<br>
initial printing performance cannot be maintained.<br>
For the pH adjuster, any substance may be used as long as<br>
it can adjust the pH to 7 or greater without having an adverse<br>
effect on the ink to be prepared.<br>
Examples of the pH adjuster include amines such as<br>
diethanolamine and triethanolamine; hydroxides of alkali metals<br>
such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and potassium<br>
hydroxide; ammonium hydroxide, hydroxides of quaternary<br>
ammonium, and hydroxides of quaternary phosphonium;<br>
carbonates of alkali metals such as lithium carbonate, sodium<br>
carbonate and potassium carbonate; and aminopropanediol<br>
derivatives. Aminopropanediol derivatives are water-soluble<br>
organic basic compounds, and examples thereof include<br>
l-amino-2,3-propanediol, l-methylamino-2,3-propanediol,<br>
2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol and<br>
2-amino-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol, with particular preference<br>
being given to 2-araino-2-ethyl"1,3-propanediol.<br>
Examples of the antirust agent include acid sulfites,<br><br><br>
sodium thiosulfate, ammonium thiodiglycolate,<br>
diisopropylammonium nitrite, pentaerythritol tetranitrate and<br>
dicyclohexylammonium nitrite.<br>
Also, a water-soluble ultraviolet absorber, a water-soluble<br>
infrared absorber or the like may be added to the antirust agent<br>
in accordance with the intended use.<br>
[Ink-jet Recording]<br>
In the present invention, the total amount of the ink needs<br>
to be strictly controlled in order to secure drying properties of the<br>
ink as well as to prevent the coloring material (pigment) in the<br>
ink from soaking into a medium and efficiently make the coloring<br>
material present in the vicinity of the medium surface." if a large<br>
amount of ink is used as in conventional ink-jet recording, the<br>
pigment in the ink possibly penetrates into the medium along<br>
with the ink solvent because the pigment separating ability of a<br>
barrier layer becomes insufficient for the large amount of ink, or<br>
there is possibly a great problem with the ink drying capability<br>
because solvent components of the ink may not penetrate into the<br>
medium as quickly as they should. It has turned out that in<br>
view of the barrier layer performing its function, the total<br>
amount of ink is 15g/m2 at the most, preferably 12g/m2 or less.<br>
The ink amount can be easily adjusted by controlling the amount<br>
of the penetrant (EHD) and the amount of the fluorochemical<br>
surfactant, etc. Also, by reducing the total amount of ink<br><br><br>
necessary for printing-, it is possible to make the capacity of an<br>
ink cartridge smaller than in a conventional ink-jet printer and<br>
thus to make an apparatus compact. Additionally, when an ink<br>
cartridge having a size similar to that of a conventional ink<br>
cartridge is used, the rate at which the ink cartridge is replaced<br>
can be reduced, and thus printing becomes possible at a lower<br>
cost. Basically, the smaller the total amount of ink is, the<br>
greater the pigment separating ability of the barrier layer is;<br>
however, if the total amount of ink is too small, there is such a<br>
drawback that the image dot diameter becomes too small after<br>
printing, so that it is desirable to set the total amount of ink<br>
within the above-mentioned range in accordance with a desired<br>
image.<br>
In the present invention, the total amount of ink is<br>
measured in accordance with a weight method. Specifically, a<br>
5cmx20cm rectangle is printed onto a sheet of TYPE 6200<br>
(produced by Ricoh Company, Ltd.), which is PPC paper, then the<br>
weight of the printed sheet is measured immediately after the<br>
printing, the weight of the sheet before the printing is subtracted<br>
from the measured weight, and the obtained value is multiplied<br>
by 100 so as to serve as the total amount of ink.<br>
The highly penetrative ink of the present invention can<br>
also be used for printing onto a conventional void-type ink-jet<br>
medium. It should, however, be noted that since the ink<br><br><br>
absorption rate is far higher than in the case where the ink is<br>
used for printing onto the recording medium of the present<br>
invention, the solvent penetrates into the void-type ink-jet<br>
medium before dots spread in a wet manner, after ink droplets<br>
have come into contact with the medium surface, and thus the dot<br>
diameter becomes small. Consequently, the image density easily<br>
decreases, and particles become easier to notice in an image.<br>
Thus, production of a high-quality image requires printing which<br>
is higher in resolution than printing onto the recording medium<br>
of the present invention, thereby leading to a decrease in printing<br>
speed and an increase in ink consumption. Hence, it is desirable<br>
to use the recording medium of the present invention.<br>
[Recording Media]<br>
Examples of the inorganic pigment contained in the<br>
barrier layer in the present invention include magnesium<br>
carbonate, talc, kaolin, illite, clay, calcium carbonate, calcium<br>
sulfite, titanium white, magnesium carbonate and titanium<br>
dioxide. Use of a pigment with a relatively high refractive index<br>
among these pigments makes it possible to reduce the thickness<br>
of the barrier layer. In terms of cost, use of calcium carbonate or<br>
kaolin is preferable. These pigments may be used in<br>
combination as long as the effects of the present invention are not<br>
impaired; also, these pigments may be combined with other<br>
pigments not included in the above-mentioned examples. Kaolin<br><br><br>
is preferable in that it is superior in gloss developing property<br>
and mates it possible to yield a texture which, approximates that<br>
of paper for offset printing. Examples of the kaolin include<br>
delaminated kaolin, calcined kaolin, and engineered kaolin<br>
produced by surface modification or the like. In view of gloss<br>
developing properties, it is desirable that 50% by mass or more of<br>
the whole kaolin be occupied by kaolin having a particle size<br>
distribution in which 80% by mass or more of the particles are<br>
2µm or less in diameter. The amount of the kaolin contained is<br>
preferably 50 parts by mass or more. When the amount is less<br>
than 50 parts by mass, sufficient effectiveness may not be<br>
obtained with respect to glossiness.<br>
Although the upper limit of the amount of the kaolin<br>
contained is not particularly limited, it is further desirable in<br>
terms of coating suitability that the amount be less than 90 parts<br>
by mass, in view of the kaolin's fluidity, especially thickening<br>
properties in the presence of high shearing force.<br>
These pigments that have high refractive indices may be<br>
used in combination with silica and/or organic pigments that<br>
have low refractive indices. Examples of the organic pigments<br>
include water-soluble dispersions containing styrene-acrylic<br>
copolymer particles, styrene-butadiene copolymer particles,<br>
polystyrene particles, polyethylene particles, etc. Each of these<br>
organic pigments may be used in combination with two or more.<br><br><br>
The organic pigments are superior in. gloss developing property<br>
and smaller in specific gravity than the inorganic pigments,<br>
thereby making it possible to obtain coating layers which are<br>
bulky, highly glossy and excellent in surface coating property.<br>
When the amount of any of the organic pigments added is less<br>
than 2 parts by mass, such effects cannot be obtained. When the<br>
amount thereof is greater than 5 parts by mass, ink<br>
strike-through is liable to arise, and also the cost will rise, which<br>
is economically unfavorable. Examples of the forms of the<br>
organic pigments include dense type, hollow type and doughnut<br>
type; in light of a balance among the gloss developing property,<br>
the surface coating property, and the fluidity of coating solution,<br>
it is desirable that the organic pigments be in the range of 0.2µm<br>
to 3.0µm in average particle diameter, and it is further desirable<br>
to employ a hollow-type organic pigment having a void ratio of<br>
40% or more.<br>
The binder of the layer for preventing pigment penetration<br>
(barrier layer) used in the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited as long as it firmly adheres to the pigment and base paper<br>
that constitute the barrier layer and it is made of an aqueous<br>
resin, an emulsion or the like which does not cause blocking.<br>
Examples of the aqueous binder include polyvinyl alcohol;<br>
starches such as starch oxide, esterified starch, enzyme-modified<br>
starch and cationated starch; cellulose derivatives such as casein,<br><br><br>
soya bean proteins, carboxy methyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose; and styrene-acrylic copolymer resins,<br>
isobutylene-maleic anhydride copolymer resins, acrylic emulsions,<br>
vinyl acetate emulsions, vinylidene chloride emulsions, polyester<br>
emulsions, styrene-butadiene copolymer latex and<br>
acrylonitrile'butadiene copolymer latex. Among these, use of<br>
starches or styrene-butadiene copolymer latex is preferable in<br>
terms of cost. The styrene-butadiene copolymer latex contains<br>
styrene and butadiene as monomers, and these monomers may be<br>
copolymerized with other monomers according to the necessity, or<br>
the styrene-butadiene copolymer latex may be copolymer latex<br>
commonly used for paper coating, in which the copolymer has<br>
been modified by chemical reaction. Typical examples of the<br>
other monomers include vinyl-based monomers such as acrylic<br>
acid, methacrylic acid, altyl esters of (meth)acrylic acid,<br>
acrylonitrile, maleic acid, fumaric acid and vinyl acetate. Also,<br>
the styrene-butadiene copolymer latex may contain a<br>
cross-linking agent such as methylolated melamine, methylolated<br>
urea, methylolated hydroxypropylene urea or isocyanate or may<br>
be a copolymer with self-crosslinking ability that includes<br>
N-methylolacrylamide or other unit. Each of these may be used<br>
alone or in combination with two or more.<br>
The amount of the aqueous binder added into the barrier<br>
layer in the present invention is preferably 50% by mass to 70%<br><br><br>
by mass, more preferably 55% by mass to 60% by mass, in relation<br>
to the total coating layer solid content. When the amount is<br>
smaller than the lower limit, the barrier layer is deficient in<br>
adhesion, and thus there is concern that the strength of the ink<br>
receiving layer might decrease, the internal bonding strength<br>
might decrease, and detachment of particles might arise.<br>
Further, other components may be added to the barrier<br>
layer of the present invention in accordance with the necessity, to<br>
such an extent that the object and effects of the present invention<br>
are not impaired. Examples of the other components include<br>
auxiliary agents contained in pigments for ordinary coated paper,<br>
such as a dispersant, a thickener, a water retention agent, an<br>
antifoaming agent and a water resistant additive; and additives<br>
such as a pH adjuster, an antiseptic agent, an antioxidant and a<br>
cationic organic compound.<br>
A surfactant used in the barrier layer is not particularly<br>
limited and may be suitably selected in accordance with the<br>
intended use. For the surfactant, any one of an anionic<br>
surfactant, a cationic surfactant, an amphoteric surfactant and a<br>
nonionic surfactant may be used, with particular preference<br>
being given to a nonionic surfactant.<br>
Examples of the nonionic surfactant include higher alcohol<br>
ethylene oxide adducts, alkylphenol ethylene oxide adducts, fatty<br>
acid ethylene oxide adducts, polyhydric alcohol fatty acid ester<br><br><br>
ethylene oxide adducts, higher aliphatic amine ethylene oxide<br>
adducts, fatty acid amide ethylene oxide adducts, ethylene oxide<br>
adducts of fats, polypropylene glycol ethylene oxide adducts, fatty<br>
acid esters of glycerol, fatty acid esters of pentaerythritol, fatty<br>
acid esters of sorbitol and sorbitan, fatty acid esters of sucrose,<br>
alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, and fatty acid amides of<br>
alkanolamines. Each of these may be used alone or in<br>
combination with two or more.<br>
The polyhydric alcohols are not particularly limited and<br>
may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use.<br>
Examples thereof include glycerol, trimethylolpropane,<br>
pentaerythrite, sorbitol and sucrose. As to the ethylene oxide<br>
adducts, ones in which an alkylene oxide, for example propylene<br>
oxide or butylene oxide, is substituted for part of ethylene oxide<br>
to such an extent that their water solubility can be maintained<br>
are also effective. The substitution ratio is preferably 50% or<br>
less. The HLB (hydrophile-lipophile balance) of the nonionic<br>
surfactant is preferably 4 to 15, more preferably 7 to 13.<br>
A cationic organic compound is not necessarily required,<br>
and a cationic organic compound is not particularly limited and<br>
may be suitably selected in accordance with the intended use.<br>
Examples of the cationic organic compound include<br>
dimethylamine-epichlorhydrin polycondensates,<br>
dimethylamine-ammonia-epichlorhydrin condensates,<br><br><br>
poly(trimethylaminoethyl methacrylate-methylsulfate),<br>
diallylamine hydrochloride-acrylamide copolymers,<br>
poly (diallylamine bydrochloride-sulfur dioxide), polyallylamine<br>
hydrochloride, poly(allylamine hydrochloride-diallylamine<br>
hydrochloride), acrylamide-diallylamine copolymers,<br>
polyvinylamine copolymers, dicyandiamide,<br>
dicyandiamide-ammonium chloride-urea-formaldehyde<br>
condensates, polyalkylene polyamine-dicyandiamide ammonium<br>
salt condensates, dimethyldiallylammonium chloride,<br>
polydiallylmethylamine hydrochloride,<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride),<br>
polyCdiallyldimethylammonium chloride-sulfur dioxide),<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride-diallylamine<br>
hydrochloride derivatives),<br>
acrylaraide-diallyldimethylammonium chloride copolymers,<br>
acrylate-acrylamide-diallylamine hydrochloride copolymers,<br>
polyethylenimine, ethylenimine derivatives such as acrylamine<br>
polymers, and modified products of polyethylenimine alkylene<br>
oxides. Each of these may be used alone or in combination with<br>
two or more.<br>
The support used in the present invention is produced by<br>
mixing together chemical pulp, mechanical pulp, recycled pulp<br>
and the like with an arbitrary ratio, and the raw materials to<br>
which an internally added sizing agent, a yield improver, a paper<br><br><br>
strength increasing agent and the like nave been added in<br>
accordance with the necessity are made into paper using, for<br>
example, a fourdrinier former, a gap-type twin-wire former, or a<br>
hybrid former in which a posterior portion of a fourdrinier section<br>
is composed of twin wires.<br>
The pulp used in the support of the present invention may<br>
contain a virgin chemical pulp (CP), for example one produced by<br>
chemically treating a wood material such as leaf bleached kraft<br>
pulp, needle bleached kraft pulp, leaf unbleached kraft pulp,<br>
needle unbleached kraft pulp, leaf bleached sulfite pulp, needle<br>
bleached sulfite pulp, leaf unbleached sulfite pulp or needle<br>
unbleached sulfite pulp, or other fiber raw material; and a virgin<br>
mechanical pulp (MP), for example one produced by mechanically<br>
treating a wood material such as ground, pulp, chemiground pulp,<br>
chemimechanical pulp or semi-chemical pulp, or other fiber raw<br>
materiaL<br>
Also, recycled pulp may be used as well, and examples of<br>
the raw material for the recycled pulp include articles shown in<br>
the "Used Paper Standard Quality Specification List" released by<br>
Paper Recycling Promotion Center, such as high-quality white<br>
paper, white paper with lines and marks, cream-colored paper,<br>
card, medium-quality white paper, low-quality white paper, simili<br>
paper, white-colored paper, Kent paper, white art paper,<br>
medium-quality colored paper, low-quality colored paper,<br><br><br>
newspaper and magazine.<br>
Specific examples thereof include used paperboards and<br>
used papers of the following papers- printer papers such as<br>
uncoated computer paper, thermosensitive paper and<br>
pressure-sensitive paper that are related to information; OA<br>
(office automation) related papers such as paper for PPC (plain<br>
paper copier); coated papers such as art paper, coated paper,<br>
finely coated paper and matte paper; and uncoated papers such as<br>
high-quality paper, high color quality paper, notebook, letter<br>
paper, packing paper, fancy paper, medium-quality paper,<br>
newspaper, woody paper, super wrapping paper, simili paper,<br>
pure white roll paper and milk carton. More specific examples<br>
thereof include chemical pulp paper and high-yield<br>
pulp-containing paper. Each of these may be used alone or in<br>
combination with two or more.<br>
The recycled pulp is generally produced by a combination<br>
of the following four steps.<br>
(1)	Defibration: used paper is treated with mechanical force<br>
and chemicals using a pulper and thusly fiberized, and printing<br>
ink is separated from the fiber.<br>
(2)	Dust removal: foreign matter (plastic, etc.) and dust<br>
contained in the used paper is removed by a screen, a cleaner or<br>
the like.<br>
(3)	Ink removal: the printing ink that has been separated from<br><br><br>
the fiber using a surfactant is removed from the system by a<br>
flotation method or washing method.<br>
(4) Bleaching: the whiteness of the fiber is enhanced utilizing<br>
oxidation or reduction.<br>
When the recycled pulp is mixed with other pulp, it is<br>
desirable that the mixture ratio of the recycled pulp in the whole<br>
pulp be 40% or less so as to prevent curl after recording.<br>
For a filler able to be used in the support of the present<br>
invention, use of calcium carbonate is effective, and the following<br>
materials may be additionally used: inorganic fillers exemplified<br>
by silicates such as kaolin, fired clay, pyrophyllite, sericite and<br>
talc; and organic pigments such as satin white, barium sulfate,<br>
calcium sulfate, zinc sulfide, plastic pigments and urea resins.<br>
The internally added sizing agent used in the support of<br>
the present invention is not particularly limited and may be<br>
suitably selected from known internally added sizing agents used<br>
for ink-jet recording paper. Suitable examples of the internally<br>
added sizing agent include rosin emulsion sizing agents.<br>
Examples of the internally added sizing agent used in producing<br>
the support include neutral rosin sizing agents used in neutral<br>
papermaking, alkenyl succinic anhydrides (ASA), alkyl ketene<br>
dimers (AKD) and petroleum resin sizing agents. Among these,<br>
neutral rosin sizing agents and alkenyl succinic anhydrides are<br>
particularly suitable. Although the alkyl ketene dimers can be<br><br><br>
added in small amounts due to their strong sizing effects, they<br>
may be unfavorable in terras of paper conveyance at the time of<br>
ink-jet recording because the friction coefficient of the recording<br>
paper (medium) surface decreases and thus the surface easily<br>
becomes slippery.<br>
The amount of the internally added sizing agent used is<br>
preferably 0.1 parts by mass to 0.7 parts by mass per 100 parts by<br>
mass of bone-dry pulp; however, the amount is not limited<br>
thereto.<br>
For the internally added filler in the support, a pigment<br>
which is conventionally known as a white pigment is used, for<br>
instance- Examples of the white pigment include white<br>
inorganic pigments such as light calcium carbonate, heavy<br>
calcium carbonate, kaolin, clay, talc, calcium sulfate, barium<br>
sulfate, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, zinc carbonate,<br>
satin white, aluminum silicate, diatomaceous earth, calcium<br>
silicate, magnesium silicate, synthetic silica, aluminum<br>
hydroxide, alumina, lithopone, zeolite, magnesium carbonate and<br>
magnesium hydroxide,' and organic pigments such as<br>
styrene-based plastic pigments, acrylic plastic pigments,<br>
polyethylene, microcapsules, urea resins and melamine resins.<br>
Each of these may be used alone or in combination with two or<br>
more.<br><method for producing barrier layer><br><br><br>
The method for providing the barrier layer over the<br>
support of the present invention by coating is not particularly<br>
limited. For instance, it is possible to utilize a method of<br>
directly coating a support with a barrier layer, a method in which<br>
a barrier layer that has been applied onto another base material<br>
is transferred onto original paper, or a method of applying a<br>
barrier layer in the form of a mist, using a spray or the like.<br>
Examples of the method of directly coating a support with a<br>
barrier layer include film transfer methods such as roll coater<br>
method, air knife coater method, gate roll coater method, size<br>
pressing, Symsizer method, and rod metalling size press coater<br>
method; and blade coater methods such as fountain method and<br>
roll application.<br>
The barrier layer can be dried using a hot-air drying oven<br>
or a thermal drum, for instance. Further, the barrier layer may<br>
be subjected to a surface-finishing process using a calendering<br>
device (supercalender, soft calender, gloss calender, etc.) so as to<br>
flatten its surface or increase the strength of its surface.<br>
The barrier layer of the present invention can be provided<br>
by coating, as described above; in addition, as a result of carrying<br>
out an earnest study, the present inventors have found that the<br>
barrier layer of the present invention can also be produced by<br>
polishing the surface of existing coated paper for printing. It is<br>
inferred that this is possible because the thickness of the coat<br><br><br>
layer is reduced by the polishing to the thickness shown in the<br>
present invention, a resin layer present on the outermost surface<br>
is shaved, which makes pores appear, and thus a layer<br>
functioning as a barrier layer is obtained.<br>
The existing coated paper for printing denotes coated<br>
paper used for commercial printing exemplified by offset printing,<br>
gravure printing, etc., and examples thereof include art paper<br>
(A0, A1), A2 coated paper, A3 coated paper, B2 coated paper, light<br>
coated paper and finely coated paper.<br>

As seen in many documents, a coat layer of ordinary<br>
commercial printing paper is formulated so as to contain a binder<br>
(resin, emulsion, starch, etc.) by approximately 10 parts by mass<br>
to 15 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of an inorganic pigment<br>
(kaolin, calcium carbonate, etc.). Here, when the manner in<br>
which the pigment is present in the coat layer, and further, the<br>
concentration gradient of the pigment in the coat layer are taken<br>
into consideration, the following can be regarded as possible: (1)<br>
formation of a clear layer or the like on the outermost surface of a<br><br><br>
coating film, as often seen in the case of paint, etc.; (2)<br>
penetration of binder components into original paper, which, may<br>
cause the tipper and lower layers to have asymmetrical<br>
concentration distributions. As to (1), it has been found that<br>
matters related to (1) are scarcely discussed in documents<br>
(documents concerning the glossiness, etc. of coated paper) in the<br>
relevant field. It is inferred that since the ratio of resin to other<br>
components in the coat layer is lower than the ratio of resin to<br>
other components in ordinary paint or the like, and the amount of<br>
the resin in the coat layer is not large enough for the resin to be<br>
deposited on the surface, anything like a clear layer does not<br>
easily form.<br>
In meetings aimed at exchanging technical opinions with<br>
experts engaged in producing commercial coated paper, many of<br>
them are found to have a technological concept that a binder<br>
should have a function of providing strength to such an extent<br>
that a layer can be prevented from peeling off at the time of<br>
printing or particles can be prevented from detaching at the time<br>
of cutting; also, perhaps the production of coated paper is liable<br>
to become troublesome, as the amount of resin increases;<br>
accordingly, in the case of this type of paper, some hope to add a<br>
binder as little as possible.<br>
As to (2), it is actually said that as the resin in the coating<br>
solution penetrates into the original paper, there arises a<br><br><br>
phenomenon in which the proportion of the resin in a coating<br>
layer becomes lower (than the proportion of the resin in the<br>
coating solution) or a layer is formed at the interface between the<br>
coating layer and the original paper; however, an example of<br>
creation of a gradient in the layer itself has not yet been<br>
confirmed (even in documents). Nevertheless, formation of a<br>
resin-rich layer at the interface between the coating layer and the<br>
original paper is possible, in which case lower parts of the layer<br>
have higher resin concentrations.<br>
Examples of the method for polishing the outermost layer<br>
of the coated paper include, but are not limited to, a method of<br>
polishing with the use of sandpaper or wrapping paper, a method<br>
of polishing with the use of a wire brush, a method of polishing<br>
with the use of a polishing roller or an endless polishing belt, and<br>
a method of polishing with the use of a sandblast.<br>
In producing the coated paper, the polishing may be<br>
carried out by arbitrarily providing a polishing process<br>
immediately after drying, before or after calendering, or in a<br>
process subsequent to coating, such as a slit process or packing<br>
process; alternatively, a user may carry out the polishing before<br>
printing, using a polishing device. Also, the polishing device<br>
may be installed in a printer so as to perform polishing each time<br>
printing is conducted.<br>
As to the polishing, the whole surface of paper may be<br><br><br>
polished, or only an area to be subjected to ink-jet printing may<br>
be selectively polished.<br>
For instance, the following paper usage is possible- the<br>
above-mentioned ordinary printing paper is subjected to offset<br>
printing or gravure printing in advance, then only an area which<br>
requires ink-jet printing is polished, and the area is printed with<br>
images, letters/characters, etc.<br>
According to this method, hybrid printing, which has<br>
conventionally been performed using paper suitahle for both<br>
ink-jet printing and ordinary printing, can also be performed<br>
using the above-mentioned ordinary printing paper, and thus it<br>
becomes possible for ordinary printing and ink-jet printing to<br>
employ paper in common. Also, this method enables printing of<br>
an address, etc. by ink-jet printing, which has been deemed<br>
difficult to achieve in ordinary printing.<br>
Additionally, the polishing device may be installed in a<br>
unit of the printer, or may be independently prepared as a<br>
separate unit.<br>
Specially made coated paper can be substituted for the<br>
medium of the present invention, as long as it satisfies the<br>
requirements of the present invention. In particular, coated<br>
paper in which the air permeability of a coat layer itself is high<br>
can be used. Examples of the coated paper in which the air<br>
permeability of a coat layer is high include some coated paper for<br><br><br>
electronic photographs, and coated paper for gravure printing.<br>
Specific examples thereof include POD GLOSS COAT (produced<br>
by Oji paper Co., Ltd.), FL GRAVURE (produced by Nippon Paper<br>
Group, Inc.), and ACE (produced by Nippon Paper Group, Inc.).<br>
These products include coat layers having large numbers of pores,<br>
and so any of these products can be used as the medium including<br>
the barrier layer of the present invention.<br>
The ink included in the ink media set of the present<br>
invention can be suitably used for printers equipped with ink-jet<br>
heads of any type, including the piezo type in which ink droplets<br>
are ejected by deforming a diaphragm that forms a wall surface of<br>
an ink flow path, with the use of a piezoelectric element as a<br>
pressure generating unit that pressurizes ink in the ink flow path,<br>
and thusly changing the volume of the ink flow path (refer to<br>
JP-A No. 02-51734); the thermal type in which bubbles are<br>
generated by heating ink in an ink flow path with the use of an<br>
exothermic resistive element (refer to JP-ANo. 61-59911); and<br>
the electrostatic type in which ink droplets are ejected by placing<br>
a diaphragm and an electrode, which form a wall surface of an ink<br>
flow path, to face each other, then deforming the diaphragm by<br>
electrostatic force generated between the diaphragm and the<br>
electrode, and thusly changing the volume of the ink flow path<br>
(refer to JP-A No. 06-71882).<br>
As described above, the recording medium in the ink media<br><br><br>
set is used in combination with the ink in the ink media set. The<br>
combination of the recording medium and the ink can be suitably<br>
used in various fields, notably in image recording apparatuses<br>
(printers) based upon ink-jet recording; for instance, the<br>
combination of the recording medium and the ink can be<br>
particularly suitably used for an ink cartridge, ink recorded<br>
matter, an ink-jet recording apparatus and an ink-jet recording<br>
method of the present invention described below.<br>
[Ink Cartridge]<br>
An ink cartridge of the present invention includes a<br>
container to house the ink included in the ink media set of the<br>
present invention, and further includes other members, etc.<br>
suitably selected in accordance with the necessity.<br>
The container is not particularly limited, and the shape,<br>
structure, size, material and the like thereof may be suitably<br>
selected in accordance with the intended use. Suitable examples<br>
thereof include a container having an ink bag or the like formed<br>
of an aluminum laminated film, resin film, etc.<br>
Next, the ink cartridge will be explained with reference to<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2. Here, FIG. 1 is a diagram showing one example<br>
of the ink cartridge of the present invention, and FIG. 2 is a<br>
diagram exemplarily showing the ink cartridge of FIG. 1 with the<br>
inclusion of a case (outer covering).<br>
In respect of an ink cartridge (200), as shown in FIG. 1, the<br><br><br>
ink of the present invention is supplied from, an ink inlet (242)<br>
into an ink bag (241), and the ink inlet (242) is closed by means of<br>
fusion bonding after air is discharged. When the ink cartridge is<br>
used, an ink ejection outlet (243) made of a rubber material is<br>
pricked with a needle of an apparatus main body, and the ink is<br>
thus supplied to the apparatus.<br>
The ink bag (241) is formed of an air-impermeable packing<br>
material such as an aluminum laminated film. As shown in FIG.<br>
2, this ink bag (241) is normally housed in a plastic cartridge case<br>
(244) and detachably mounted on a variety of ink-jet recording<br>
apparatuses.<br>
The ink cartridge of the present invention houses the ink<br>
included in the ink media set of the present invention and can be<br>
detachably mounted on a variety of ink-jet recording apparatuses.<br>
It is particularly desirable that the ink cartridge be detachably<br>
mounted on an ink-jet recording apparatus of the present<br>
invention described below.<br>
[Ink-jet Recording Method and Ink-jet Recording Apparatus]<br>
An ink-jet recording apparatus of the present invention<br>
includes at least an ink jetting unit, and further includes other<br>
units suitably selected in accordance with the necessity, such as a<br>
stimulus generating unit and a controlling unit.<br>
An ink-jet recording method of the present invention<br>
includes at least an ink jetting step, and further includes other<br><br><br>
steps suitably selected in accordance with, the necessity, such as a<br>
stimulus generating step and a controlling step.<br>
The ink-jet recording method of the present invention can<br>
be suitably performed by the ink-jet recording apparatus of the<br>
present invention, and the ink jetting step can be suitably<br>
performed by the ink jetting unit. Also, the other steps can be<br>
suitably performed by the other units.<br>
The ink jetting step is a step of jetting the ink included in<br>
the ink media set of the present invention so as to record an<br>
image on the recording medium included in the ink media set, by<br>
applying a stimulus to the ink.<br>
The ink jetting unit is a unit configured to jet the ink<br>
included in the ink media set of the present invention so as to<br>
record an image on the recording medium included in the ink<br>
media set, by applying a stimulus to the ink. The ink jetting<br>
unit is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include<br>
nozzles for ejecting ink. .<br>
In the present invention, at least part of a liquid chamber,<br>
a fluid resistance unit, a diaphragm and a nozzle member of an<br>
ink-jet head is preferably formed of a material containing at least<br>
either silicone or nickel.<br>
Also, the diameter of the ink-jet nozzle is preferably 30µm<br>
or less, more preferably 1µm to 20µm.<br>
Additionally, sub-tanks for supplying ink onto the ink-jet<br><br><br>
head are preferably provided such, that the sub-tanks are<br>
replenished with ink from the ink cartridge via a supply tube.<br>
Further, in the ink-jet recording method of the present<br>
invention, the maximum amount of the ink attached onto the<br>
recording medium is preferably 8g/m2 to 20g/m2 at a resolution of<br>
300dpi or higher.<br>
The stimulus can, for example, be generated by the<br>
stimulus generating unit, and the stimulus is not particularly<br>
limited and may be suitably selected in accordance with the<br>
intended use. Examples thereof include heat, pressure,<br>
vibration and light. Each of these may be used alone or in<br>
combination with two or more. Among these, heat and pressure<br>
are suitable.<br>
Examples of the stimulus generating unit include heaters,<br>
pressurizers, piezoelectric elements, vibration generators,<br>
ultrasonic oscillators and lights. Specific examples thereof<br>
include a piezoelectric actuator such as a piezoelectric element, a<br>
thermal actuator that uses a thermoelectric conversion element<br>
such as an exothermic resistive element and utilizes phase<br>
change caused by film boiling of a liquid, a shape-memory-alloy<br>
actuator that utilizes metal phase change caused by temperature<br>
change, and an electrostatic actuator that utilizes electrostatic<br>
force.<br>
The manner in which the ink included in the ink media set<br><br><br>
jets is not particularly limited and varies according to the type or<br>
the like of the stimulus. In the case where the stimulus is "heat",<br>
there is, for example, a method in which thermal energy<br>
corresponding to a recording signal is given to the ink in a<br>
recording head, using a thermal head or the like, hubbies are<br>
generated in the ink by the thermal energy, and the ink is ejected<br>
as droplets from nozzle holes of the recording head by the<br>
pressure of the bubbles. Meanwhile, in the case where the<br>
stimulus is "pressure", there is, for example, a method in which<br>
by applying voltage to a piezoelectric element bonded to a site<br>
called a pressure chamber that lies in an ink flow path in a<br>
recording head, the piezoelectric element bends, the volume of<br>
the pressure chamber decreases, and thus the ink is ejected as<br>
droplets from nozzle holes of the recording head.<br>
It is desirable that the ink droplets jetted be, for example,<br>
lpl to 40pl in size, 5m/s to 20m/s in ejection velocity, 1kHz or<br>
greater in drive frequency and 300dpi or greater in resolution.<br>
The controlling unit is not particularly limited and may be<br>
suitably selected in accordance with the intended use, as long as<br>
it can control operations of the aforementioned units. Examples<br>
thereof include apparatuses such as a sequencer and a computer.<br>
One aspect of performing the ink-jet recording method of<br>
the present invention by the ink-jet recording apparatus of the<br>
present invention will be explained with reference to the<br><br><br>
drawings. The ink-jet recording apparatus in FIG. 3 includes an<br>
apparatus main body (101), a paper feed tray (102) for feeding<br>
paper that is loaded thereon into the apparatus main body (101),<br>
a paper discharge tray (103) for storing paper which has been<br>
loaded into the apparatus main body (101) and on which images<br>
have been recorded (formed), and an ink cartridge loading section<br>
(104). An operation unit (105) composed of operation keys, a<br>
display and the like is placed on the upper surface of the ink<br>
cartridge loading section (104). The ink cartridge loading<br>
section (104) has a front cover (115) capable of opening and<br>
closing to attach and detach an ink cartridge (200).<br>
In FIGS. 3 and 4, (111) denotes an upper cover of the<br>
ink-jet recording apparatus, and (112) denotes a front surface of<br>
the ink-jet recording apparatus.<br>
In the apparatus main body (101), as shown in FIGS. 4 and<br>
5, a carriage (133) is freely slidably held in the main scanning<br>
direction by a guide rod (131), which is a guide member laterally<br>
passed between left and right side plates (not shown), and a stay<br>
(132)." and the carriage (133) is moved for scanning in the<br>
direction indicated by the arrow A in FIG. 5 by a main scanning<br>
motor (not shown). The belt moves in the direction indicated by<br>
the arrow B in FIG. 5 to convey paper.<br>
A recording head (134) composed of four ink-jet recording<br>
heads which eject ink droplets of yellow (Y), cyan (C), magenta<br><br><br>
(M) and black (Bk) is installed in the carriage (133) such, that a<br>
plurality of ink ejection outlets are aligned in the direction<br>
intersecting the main scanning direction and that the ink droplet<br>
ejection direction faces downward.<br>
For each of the ink-jet recording heads composing the<br>
recording head (134), it is possible to use, for example, a head<br>
provided with any of the following actuators as a<br>
energy-generating unit for ejecting ink: a piezoelectric actuator<br>
such as a piezoelectric element, a thermal actuator that uses a<br>
thermoelectric conversion element such as an exothermic<br>
resistive element and utilizes phase change caused by film<br>
boiling of a liquid, a shape-memory-alloy actuator that utilizes<br>
metal phase change caused by temperature change, and an<br>
electrostatic actuator that utilizes electrostatic force.<br>
Also, the carriage (133) incorporates sub-tanks (135) of<br>
each color for supplying inks of each color to the recording head<br>
(134). Each sub-tank (135) is supplied and replenished with the<br>
ink included in the ink media set of the present invention from<br>
the ink cartridge (200) of the present invention loaded into the<br>
ink cartridge loading section (104), via an ink supply tube (not<br>
shown).<br>
Meanwhile, as a paper feed unit for feeding sheets of paper<br>
(142) loaded on a paper loading section (pressure plate) (141) of<br>
the paper feed tray (102), there are provided a half-moon roller<br><br><br>
(paper feed roller (143)) which, feeds the sheets of paper (142) one<br>
by one from the paper loading section (141), and a separation pad<br>
(144) which faces the paper feed roller (143) and is formed of a<br>
material with a large friction coefficient. This separation pad<br>
(144) is biased toward the paper feed roller (143) side.<br>
As a conveyance unit for conveying the paper (142), which<br>
has been fed from this paper feed unit, under the recording head<br>
(134), there are provided a conveyance belt (151) for conveying<br>
the paper (142) by means of electrostatic adsorption; a counter<br>
roller (152) for conveying the paper (142), which is sent from the<br>
paper feed unit via a guide (145), such that the paper (142) is<br>
sandwiched between the counter roller (152) and the conveyance<br>
belt (151); a conveyance guide (153) for making the paper (142),<br>
which is sent upward in the substantially vertical direction,<br>
change its direction by approximately 90° and thusly correspond<br>
with the conveyance belt (151); and an end pressurizing roller<br>
(155) biased toward the conveyance belt (151) side by a pressing<br>
member (154). Also, there is provided a charging roller (156) as<br>
a charging unit for charging the surface of the conveyance belt<br>
(151).<br>
The conveyance belt (151) is an endless belt and is capable<br>
of moving in circles in the belt conveyance direction, passed<br>
between a conveyance roller (157) and a tension roller (158).<br>
The conveyance belt (151) has, for example, a surface layer<br><br><br>
serving as a paper adsorbing surface, that is formed of a resinous<br>
material such, as an ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer<br>
(ETFE) having a thickness of approximately 40µm for which<br>
resistance control has not been conducted, and a back layer<br>
(intermediate resistance layer, ground layer) that is formed of the<br>
same material as this surface layer, for which resistance control<br>
has been conducted using carbon. On the back of the conveyance<br>
belt (151), a guide member (161) is placed correspondingly to a<br>
region where printing is carried out by the recording head (134).<br>
Additionally, as a paper discharge unit for discharging the paper<br>
(142) on which images or the like have been recorded by the<br>
recording head (134), there are provided a separation pawl (171)<br>
for separating the paper (142) from the conveyance belt (151), a<br>
paper discharge roller (172) and a paper discharge small roller<br>
(173), with the paper discharge tray (103) being placed below the<br>
paper discharge roller (172).<br>
A double-sided paper feed unit.(l8l) is mounted on a rear<br>
surface portion of the apparatus main body (101) in a freely<br>
detachable manner. The double-sided paper feed unit (181)<br>
takes in the paper (142) returned by rotation of the conveyance<br>
belt (151) in the opposite direction and reverses it, then refeeds it<br>
between the counter roller (152) and the conveyance belt (l5l).<br>
Additionally, a manual paper feed unit (182) is provided on an<br>
upper surface of the double-sided paper feed unit (181).<br><br><br>
In this ink-jet recording apparatus, the sheets of paper<br>
(142) are fed one by one from the paper feed unit, and the paper<br>
(142) fed upward in the substantially vertical direction is guided<br>
by the guide (145) and conveyed between the conveyance belt<br>
(151) and the counter roller (152). Further, the conveyance<br>
direction of the paper (142) is changed by approximately 90°, as<br>
an end of the paper (142) is guided by the conveyance guide (153)<br>
and pressed onto the conveyance belt (151) by the end<br>
pressurizing roller (155).<br>
On this occasion, the conveyance belt (151) is charged by<br>
the charging roller (156), and the paper (142) is electrostatically<br>
adsorbed onto the conveyance belt (151) and thusly conveyed.<br>
Here, by driving the recording head (134) according to an image<br>
signal while moving the carriage (133), ink droplets are ejected<br>
onto the paper (142) having stopped so as to carry out recording<br>
for one line, and after the paper (142) is conveyed by a<br>
predetermined distance, recording for the next line is carried out.<br>
On receipt of a recording completion signal or such a signal as<br>
indicates that the rear end of the paper (142) has reached the<br>
recording region, recording operation is finished, and the paper<br>
(142) is discharged onto the paper discharge tray (103).<br>
Once the amount of ink remaining in the sub-tanks (135)<br>
has been detected as too small, a required amount of ink is<br>
supplied from the ink cartridge (200) into the sub-tanks (135).<br><br><br>
As to this ink-jet recording apparatus, when ink in the ink<br>
cartridge (200) of the present invention has been used up, it is<br>
possible to replace only an ink bag inside the ink cartridge (200)<br>
by dismantling the housing of the ink cartridge (200). Also, even<br>
when the ink cartridge (200) is longitudinally placed and employs<br>
a front-loading structure, it is possible to supply ink stably.<br>
Therefore, even when the apparatus main body (101) is installed<br>
with little space over it, for example when the apparatus main<br>
body (101) is stored in a rack or when an object is placed over the<br>
apparatus main body (101), it is possible to replace the ink<br>
cartridge (200) with ease.<br>
It should be noted that although the ink-jet recording<br>
method of the present invention has been explained referring to<br>
an example in which it is applied to a serial-type (shuttle-type)<br>
ink-jet recording apparatus where a carriage performs scanning,<br>
the ink-jet recording method of the present invention can also be<br>
applied to line-type ink-jet recording apparatuses provided with<br>
line-type heads.<br>
Also, the ink-jet recording apparatus and the ink-jet<br>
recording method of the present invention can be applied to a<br>
variety of types of recording based upon ink-jet recording systems.<br>
For example, they can be particularly suitably applied to ink-jet<br>
recording printers, facsimile apparatuses, copiers,<br>
printer/fax/copier complex machines, and so forth.<br><br><br>
The following explains an ink-jet head to which the<br>
present invention is applied.<br>
FIG. 6 is an enlarged view showing elements of an ink-jet<br>
head to which the present invention has been applied, and FIG. 7<br>
is an enlarged cross-sectional view showing main parts of the<br>
ink-jet head with respect to the channel-to-channel direction.<br>
This ink-jet head is composed of a frame (10) provided with<br>
an ink supply port (not shown) (which supplies ink in the<br>
direction from the surface toward the back in FIG. 6 (toward the<br>
back surface of paper)) and an indentation serving as a common<br>
liquid chamber (12); a flow path plate (20) including a fluid<br>
resistance section (21), an indentation serving as a pressurized<br>
liquid chamber (22), and a communicating port (23)<br>
communicated with a nozzle (31); a nozzle plate (30) forming the<br>
nozzle (31); a diaphragm (60) provided with a diaphragm<br>
protrusion (61), a diaphragm part (62) and an ink flow-in port<br>
(63); a laminated piezoelectric element (50) joined to the<br>
diaphragm (60) with an adhesive layer (70) placed in between;<br>
and a base (40) on which the laminated piezoelectric element (50)<br>
is fixed. The base (40) is made of a barium titanate-based<br>
ceramic and joined to the laminated piezoelectric element (50)<br>
that is arranged in two rows.<br>
In the laminated piezoelectric element (50), piezoelectric<br>
layers (51), which are formed of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and<br><br><br>
each, one of which is 10µm to 50µm in thickness, and internal<br>
electrode layers (52), which are formed of silver-palladium (AgPd)<br>
and each one of which is several micrometers in thickness, are<br>
alternately deposited on top of one another. The internal<br>
electrode layers (52) are connected to external electrodes (53), at<br>
their ends on both sides.<br>
The laminated piezoelectric element (50) is formed into the<br>
shape of comb teeth by half-cut dicing, in which drive parts (56)<br>
and support parts (non-drive parts) (57) are alternately disposed<br>
(FIG. 7).<br>
The length of the outer end of one of the two external<br>
electrodes (53) (which is contiguous to the ends of the internal<br>
electrode layers (52) on one side in the direction of the surface or<br>
the back in FIG. 6 (the back surface of paper)) is limited by<br>
cutting or the like so as to be divided by half-cut dicing, and<br>
divided pieces serve as individual electrodes (54). The other of<br>
the two external electrodes (53) is not divided by dicing but<br>
electrically continuous, serving as a common electrode (55).<br>
An FPC (80) is welded to the individual electrodes (54) of<br>
the drive parts. With an electrode layer provided at an end of<br>
the laminated piezoelectric element, the common electrode (55) is<br>
joined to a Gnd electrode of the FPC (80) in a twisted manner.<br>
On the FPC (80), a driver IC (not shown) is mounted, which<br>
controls application of drive voltage to the drive parts (56).<br><br><br>
The diaphragm (60) is equipped with, the diaphragm part<br>
(62) formed as a thin film," the island-like convex portion (island<br>
part) (61) which is formed at the center of this diaphragm part<br>
(62) and joined to the drive parts (56) of the laminated<br>
piezoelectric element (50); a thick film portion including a beam<br>
joined to the support parts (not shown); and an opening serving<br>
as the ink flow-in port (63), formed by combining two Ni-plated<br>
films produced by electroforming. The diaphragm portion has a<br>
thickness of 3p.m. and a width of 35µm (with respect to one side).<br>
By patterning the adhesive layer (70) including a gap<br>
material, the island-like diaphragm protrusion (6l) of the<br>
diaphragm (60) is bonded to the drive parts (56) of the laminated<br>
piezoelectric element (50), and the diaphragm (60) is bonded to<br>
the frame (10).<br>
As to the flow path plate (20), the following members are<br>
patterned by etching with the use of a silicon single-crystal<br>
substrate: the fluid resistance section (21); the indentation<br>
serving as the pressurized liquid chamber (22); and a<br>
through-hole serving as the communicating port (23), placed in a<br>
position corresponding to the nozzle (31).<br>
The portions that remain unetched serve as partitions (24)<br>
of the pressurized liquid chamber (22). Additionally, this head<br>
is provided with a portion where the etching width is small to<br>
serve as the fluid resistance section (21).<br><br><br>
A nozzle plate (30) is formed of a metal material, for<br>
example an Ni-plated film produced by electroforming, and a<br>
large number of nozzles (31), which are minute ejection outlets<br>
for jetting ink droplets, are formed therein. The internal shape<br>
(inner shape) of each of these nozzles (31) is similar to the shape<br>
of a horn (which may otherwise be a substantially columnar<br>
shape or a substantially conical and trapezoidal shape). Also,<br>
the diameter of each of these nozzles (31) is approximately 20urn<br>
to 35µm as a diameter on the side where ink droplets exit.<br>
Additionally, the nozzle pitch in each row is 150dpi.<br>
An ink ejection surface (on the nozzle surface side) of the<br>
nozzle plate (30) is provided with a water-repellent layer (not<br>
shown) which has been subjected to water-repellent surface<br>
treatment. High image quality is obtained through stabilization<br>
of the droplet shape and jetting properties of ink by providing a<br>
water-repellent film selected in accordance with the ink<br>
properties, which is produced by PTFE-Ni eutectoid plating,<br>
electrodeposition of a fluorine resin, vapor deposition coating of<br>
an evaporable fluorine resin (such as a fluorinated pitch), baking<br>
of a silicone resin and a fluorine resin after application of solvent,<br>
etc. For instance, as to the fluorine resin among these, although<br>
a variety of materials are known as fluorine resins, superior<br>
water repellency can be obtained by subjecting a modified<br>
perfluoropolyoxetane (product name: OPTOOL DSX, produced by<br><br><br>
Daikin Industries, Ltd.) to vapor deposition so as to have a<br>
thickness of 30A to 100A.<br>
The frame (10) including the ink supply port and the<br>
indentation serving as the common liquid chamber (12) is<br>
produced by molding a resin.<br>
As to the ink-jet head with such a structure, by applying a<br>
drive waveform (a pulse voltage of 10V to 50V) to the drive parts<br>
(56) correspondingly to a recording signal, displacement of the<br>
lamination direction is generated in the drive parts (56), there is<br>
an increase in pressure as the pressurized liquid chamber (22) is<br>
pressurized, and thus ink droplets are ejected from the nozzle<br>
(31) formed in the nozzle plate (30).<br>
Thereafter, once ejection of ink droplets is over, the ink<br>
pressure in the pressurized liquid chamber (22) lowers, and<br>
negative pressure is generated in the pressurized liquid chamber<br>
(22) due to inertia of the flow of ink and a drive pulse discharge<br>
process, which is followed by an ink supply step. On this<br>
occasion, the ink supplied from an ink tank flows into the<br>
common liquid chamber (12), passes from the common liquid<br>
chamber (12) through the fluid resistance section (21) via the ink<br>
flowin port (63) and then is supplied into the pressurized liquid<br>
chamber (22).<br>
The fluid resistance section (21) is effective in reducing<br>
residual pressure vibrations after ink ejection; conversely, it<br><br><br>
serves as a resistance to refilling effected by surface tension. By<br>
suitably selecting the fluid resistance section, it becomes possible<br>
to balance reduction in residual pressure and refill time and to<br>
shorten the time spent in shifting to an ink droplet ejecting<br>
operation that follows (the driving cycle).<br>

A 0.3% slurry containing the components shown above was<br>
made into paper using a fourdrinier machine, the paper was<br>
subjected to machine calendering, and a support 1 having a basis<br>
weight of 79g/m2 was thus produced. Additionally, in a size<br>
pressing process in the papermaking step, a starch oxide aqueous<br>
solution was applied onto the paper at a rate of 1.0g/m2 as a solid<br>
content per side.<br>
(Paper Example 1)<br>
A coating solution having a solid content concentration of<br><br><br>
60% was prepared by adding the following- compounds and water<br>
to the support 1 produced in Original Paper Production Example<br>
i: 70 parts of kaolin (1.6 in refractive index, ULTRAWHITE 90<br>
(produced by Engelhard Corporation)) as a pigment, in which<br>
particles that are 2um or less in diameter occupy 97% of all<br>
particles; 30 parts of heavy calcium carbonate (1.6 in refractive<br>
index, CALSHITEG BRILLIANT-15 (produced by Shiraishi Kogyo<br>
Kaisha, Ltd.)) having an average particle diameter of 1.1 µm; 8<br>
parts of styrene-butadiene copolymer emulsion as an adhesive,<br>
having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of-5°C; 1 part of<br>
phosphoric acid-esterified starch; and 0.5 parts of calcium<br>
stearate as an auxiliary agent.<br>
This coating solution was applied onto both surfaces of the<br>
original paper using a blade coater such that the coating layer<br>
thickness was lum per side, and dried with hot air, then the<br>
original paper with this coating solution was subjected to a<br>
supercalendering process, and "recording paper 1" of the present<br>
invention was thus obtained.<br>
Printing was carried out on sheets of this recording paper<br>
1 as a recording medium at an image resolution of 600dpi, with<br>
the ink compositions and the ink sets shown in Tables 1 and 2,<br>
using a 300dpi drop on-demand experimental printer having<br>
nozzles with a nozzle resolution of 384. The amount of ink<br>
attached onto the recording paper 1 was controlled, as the<br><br><br>
maximum droplet size was set at 18pl and the total amount of a<br>
secondary color was limited to 140%. When solid images and<br>
letters/characters were printed on a sheet of the recording paper<br>
1, the total amount of ink attached thereto was controlled so as<br>
not to exceed 15g/m2 per area of 300 dots x 300 dots. The quality<br>
and reliability of the images obtained were evaluated. The<br>
results are shown in Table 3. Those evaluated as D are not<br>
suitable as ink-jet images.<br>
(Paper Example 2)<br>
Ink-jet recording was carried out in a manner similar to<br>
Paper Example 1, except that the coating layer thickness was<br>
changed to 10µm per side and "recording paper 2" was thus<br>
obtained.<br>
(Paper Example 3)<br>
Ink-jet recording was carried out in a manner similar to<br>
Paper Example 2, except that the inorganic pigment contained in<br>
the coating solution was changed to 100 parts (as a solid content)<br>
of TA-100 (anatase-type titanium oxide, 2.5 in refractive index,<br>
produced by Fuji Titanium Industry Co., Ltd.) and "recording<br>
paper 3" was thus obtained.<br>
(Paper Example 4)<br>
Ink-jet recording was carried out in a manner similar to<br>
Paper Example 1, except that the inorganic pigment contained in<br>
the coating solution was changed to 100 parts of TP-221 (light<br><br><br>
calcium carbonate, 1,6 (1.59) in refractive index, produced by<br>
OKUTAMA KOGYO CO., LTD.), the coating layer thickness was<br>
changed to 5µm per side and "recording paper 4" was thus<br>
obtained.<br>
(Paper Example 5)<br>
Ink-jet recording was carried out in a manner similar to<br>
Paper Example 1, except that the coated paper SPACE DX for<br>
gravure printing (which contains kaolin (1.6 in refractive index)<br>
and calcium carbonate (1.6 in refractive index); produced by<br>
Nippon Paper Group, Inc.) was used (as "recording paper 5") for<br>
the recording medium.<br>
(Paper Example 6)<br>
Ink-jet recording was carried out in a manner similar to<br>
Paper Example 1, except that the coated paper POD GLOSS for<br>
electronic photographs (which contains kaolin (1.6 in refractive<br>
index) and calcium carbonate (1.6 in refractive index); produced<br>
by Oji paper Co., Ltd.) was used (as "recording paper 6") for the<br>
recording medium.<br>
(Paper Example 7)<br>
Ink-jet recording was carried out in a manner similar to<br>
Paper Example 5, except that the surface of the coated paper POD<br>
GLOSS for electronic photographs (which contains kaolin (1.6 in<br>
refractive index) and calcium carbonate (1.6 in refractive index);<br>
produced by Oji paper Co., Ltd.) was polished 20 times with<br><br><br>
wrapping paper such that the coating layer thickness was 5.1p.m.<br>
per side, and this paper was used (as "recording paper 7") for the<br>
recording medium.<br>
As to the media of Paper Examples 1 to 7, as a result of<br>
binarizing the observation images with the use of FE-SEM S-4200<br>
manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd., it was confirmed that pores were<br>
lµm or less in diameter, the pores occupied 40% or less of the<br>
media surface in area, which was measured based upon the areas<br>
of pores that occupied the images, and thus all these Paper<br>
Examples satisfied the requirements concerning the pores in the<br>
barrier layers.<br>
