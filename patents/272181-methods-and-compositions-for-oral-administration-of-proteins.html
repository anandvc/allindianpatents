METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRA1 lun ur rROTEINS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[001] This invention provides compositions comprising a protein and an omega-3 fatty acid, and a method for administering same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] Due to improved biotechnology, the accessibility of biologically active peptides to the pharmaceutical industry has increased considerably. However, a limiting factor in the development of peptide drugs is the relative ineffectiveness when given perorally. Almost all peptide drugs are parenterally administered, although parenterally administered peptide drugs are often connected with low patient compliance.<br>
[003] Insulin is a medicament used to treat patients suffering from diabetes, and is the only treatment for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by a pathological condition of absolute or relative insulin deficiency, leading to hyperglycemia, and is one of the main threats to human health in the 21st century. The global figure of people with diabetes is set to rise to 220 million in 2010, and 3 00 million in 2025. Type I diabetes is caused primarily by the failure of the pancreas to produce insulin. Type II diabetes, involves a lack of responsiveness of the body to the action of insulin.<br>
[004] Approximately 20%-30% of all diabetics use daily insulin injections to maintain their glucose levels. An estimated 10% of all diabetics are totally dependent on insulin injections.<br>
[005] Currently, the only route of insulin administration is injection. Daily injection of insulin is causes considerable suffering for patients. Side effects such as lipodystrophy at the site of the injection, lipatrophy, lilpohypertrophy, and occasional hypoglycemia are known to occur. In addition, subcutaneous administration of insulin does not typically provide the fine continuous regulation of metabolism that occurs normally with insulin secreted from the pancreas directly into the liver via the portal vein.<br>
[006] The present invention addresses the need for an alternate solution for administration of insulin.<br><br>

[0077] In one embodiment, methods and compositions of the present invention have the advantage of more closely mimicking physiological insulin secretion by the pancreas. When insulin is secreted into the portal vein, the liver is exposed to a greater insulin concentration than peripheral tissues. Similarly, insulin administered according to the present invention reaches the intestine and is absorbed in the body through the intestine and through the portal system to the liver. This absorption route thus resembles the physiological secretion of insulin by the pancreas, enabling, in this embodiment, delicate control of the blood glucose level and the metabolic activities of the liver and the peripheral organs controlled by insulin. By contrast, when insulin is administered to insulin-deficient diabetic patients via the peripheral venous system, the concentration of insulin in the portal vein is similar to that in the peripheral circulation, resulting in hypoinsulinemia in the portal vein and the liver and hyperinsulinemia in the peripheral venous system. This leads, in one embodiment, to an abnormal pattern of glucose disposal<br>
[0078] In another embodiment, different constituents of compositions of the present composition are absorbed at different rates from the intestinal lumen into the blood stream. The absorption of the bile acid, in one embodiment, is significantly faster than the absorption of insulin.<br>

Each of the above excipients represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0083] In some embodiments, the dosage forms of the present invention are formulated to achieve an immediate release profile, an extended release profile, or a delayed release profile. In some embodiments, the release profile of the composition is determined by using specific excipients that serve for example as binders, disintegrants, fillers, or coating materials. In one embodiment, the composition will be formulated to achieve a particular release profile as known to one skilled in the art.<br><br>

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS SECTION<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
PROTECTION OF INSULIN FROM PROTEASES AND SUCCESSFUL ADMINISTRATION VIA THE DUODENUM IN DOGS<br>
MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS<br>
Formulation<br>
[0091] The day of dosing, a formulation containing 100 milligram (nig) EDTA (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 100 mg soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBT1; Sigma), 5 mg insulin (recombinant crystalline) dissolved in 2 milliliter (ml) fish oil was prepared and inserted into a transparent gelatin capsule.<br>
RESULTS<br>
[0092] To test whether insulin can be protected from proteases and absorbed via the duodenum;, a composition containing insulin, SBTI, EDTA? and fish oil was administered directly to the duodenum of an 8.8 kg beagle dog. Blood glucose was measured every 10 minutes following administration. As depicted below in Table 1, blood glucose levels were significantly reduced in response to the insulin.<br>
[0093] Thus, compositions comprising an omega-3 fatty acid can protect insulin from proteases in the small intestine and enable direct absorption of orally administered insulin.<br>
[0094] Table 1. Blood glucose concentrations following administration of insulin to the duodenum in experimental.<br><br><br><br>
MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS<br>
Formulation<br>
[0095] 4 days prior to dosing, a formulation was prepared containing 125 mg EDTA, 100 mg SBTI? and 5 mg insulin in 2 ml fish oil in a gelatin capsule. The formulation was stored in the refrigerator (4° C) until dosing,<br>
RESULTS<br>
[0096] In the next experiment, a formulation of SBTI, EDTA, and fish oil was prepared 4 days prior to dosing, then administered directly to the duodenum of a 9.0 kg beagle dog. As depicted below in Table 2, blood glucose levels were significantly reduced in response to the insulin.<br>
[0097] These results confirm the results of Example 1, showing that compositions comprising an omega-3 fatty acid can protect insulin from proteases in the small intestine and enable direct absorption of orally administered insulin. In addition, these results show that compositions of the present invention can be stored after constitution without losing potency.<br><br>

[00101] In one embodiment, a solution of the enteric coated polymer is prepared by dissolving the polymer in a methylene chloride+isopropyl alcohol mixture. The tablets are coated by spraying the solution within a mildly warmed jar under constant agitation. The solvent vapors are continuously aspirated.<br>
Measurement of levels and activity of recombinant insulin in subjects'plasma<br>
[00102] A human insulin radio-immunoassay (RIA) kit (Linco Research Inc, St Charles, Missouri) is used to measure levels of recombinant insulin. Levels of C peptide are measured as well, to determine the relative contributions of endogenous and exogenous insulin to observed rises in insulin levels.<br>
RESULTS<br>
[00103] A mixture of EDTA, SBTI, and insulin dissolved in fish oil is formulated into tablet or capsule cores, coated with an enteric coating or gelatin coating, and administered to human subjects. Blood glucose levels of the subjects are measured periodically as described in the previous Examples. In addition, the subjects* plasma levels of recombinant insulin and its activity are tested. The coated pills are shown to deliver functional insulin to the subjects, and the insulin significantly lowers their blood glucose levels, showing that active insulin can be delivered to the bloodstream via oral administration. Different types of commercially available delayed release coatings are tested to determine which coating provides the best delivery of insulin, and this coating is used in subsequent Examples.<br>
