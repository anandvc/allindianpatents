PHOTOACTIVE COPOLYMER;<br>
ROLIC AG, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS CHAMERSTRASSE 50, 6301 ZUG, SWITZERLAND.<br>
THE   FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH<br>
IT ISTO BE PERFORMED.<br>
ORIGINAL <br>
570/MUMNP/2003                 <br><br>
The present invention relates to a new photoactive copolymer and its use - alone or admixed with at least with one other photo¬active polymer - as orientation layers for liquid crystals and in the construction of unstructured and structured optical elements and multi-layer systems.<br>
The successful functioning of a liquid crystal device relies upon the ability of the liquid crystal molecules within that, device to adopt and maintain an alignment imposed upon them. Alignment of the liquid crystal molecules is achieved by use of an orientation layer which defines a direction of orientation for the liquid crystal molecules of the device with the result that the longitudinal axes of the molecules become aligned with the direction of orientation defined by the orientation layer. In addition to this directional alignment, the orientation layer is also able to impart to the liquid crystal molecules an angle of tilt so that the molecules align themselves at an angle to the surface of the orientation layer rather than lying parallel hereto.<br>
Tilt angles of between 1° and 15° are usual for nematic liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Some electro-optical effects used for LCDs, however, require alignment layers with very high pretilt angles. Vertically aligned nematic (VAN) LCDs for instance require pretilt angles between 85° and 90°, measured from the surface plane. In the case of hybrid aligned nematic (HAN) LCDs, the pretilt angle at one of the substrates has to be in the<br><br>
above range, whereas the tilt angle at the other substrate is low (typically 0° to 10°).<br>
Methods of preparing structured and unstructured orientation layers are well known to a skilled person. Customarily used uniaxially rubbed polymer orientation layers such as, for example, polyimides however impact a series of disadvantages like dust generation during rubbing process, destruction of thin film transistors and lack of structuring. The rubbing process consequently does not allow the production of structured layers. Orientation layers in which the direction of orientation can be predetermined by irradiation with polarized light have been known for some time. It is by that means possible to avoid the problems inherent in the rubbing process. In addition, it is possible to provide areas having different orientation and thus to structure the orientation layer as described for example in Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 31 (1992), 2155-64 (Schadt et al.). In that process the dimerisation of polymer-bonded photoreactive cinnamic acid groups induced by irradiation with linearly polarized light is employed leading to an anisotropic polymer network. Those photo-oriented polymer networks can be used wherever structured or unstructured liquid crystal orientation layers are required.<br>
EP-A-0611786 and WO-A-96/10049 (both F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG) , as well as EP-A-0763552 (Rolic AG), describe cinnamic acid poly mers that are suitable in principle for the synthesis of such anisotropically cross-linked, photostructured orientation layers for liquid crystals. In the case of the compounds described in EP-A-0763552 and WO-A-96/10049, on irradiation with linearly polarized light it is possible, in addition to inducing the de¬sired orientation, simultaneously to induce an angle of tilt. It is thus possible to produce layers having structuring in respect<br><br>
of surface orientation and angle of tilt.<br>
The above photostructured orientation layers have the disadvantage, however, that for certain applications, especially for use in TFT displays, they result in adjacent liquid crystal mixture having an insufficient electrical resistance value. In TFT displays, too low a resistance value of the liquid crystal medium leads to an inadequate "holding ratio", which is a measure of the voltage drop in the display after the voltage has been switched off. Low holding ratio values, however, bring about undesirable changes in brightness and contrast over time and thus result in unstable graduations of the grey tones.<br>
Recently, photoreactive materials for orientation layers with improved holding ratios were described in WO-A-99/49360 (Rolic AG),  JP-A-10-195296,  JP-A-10-232400  (both Samsung  Electron-Devices Co., Ltd.), WO-A-99/15576 (Rolic AG) and WO-A-99/51662 (Kanegafuchi Kagaku Kogyo KK) . In WO-A-99/49360, JP-A-10-195296-and JP-A-10-232400, blends of polymeric compounds containing photoreactive polymers on the one hand and polyimides on the other hand are proposed. A disadvantage of such blends is their limited miscibility.  Low contents of photoreactive polymers however lead to a loss of orienting properties and consequently to a reduced contrast ratio of liquid crystal layers to be oriented  whereas  a  reduced  polyimide  content  results  in insufficient holding ratios. In WO-A-99/x5576 and WO-A-99/51662 polyimides incorporating photoreactive cinnamate groups in their side chains are described.<br>
A usually important feature necessary for orientation layers used in LCDs is the photostability of tilt angles. Especially in displays using high light intensities, for instance in projec-tion displays, for the known photo orientation materials often<br><br>
changes in the predetermined tilt angles are observed with time. Such changes in tilt angle however lead to a continuous loss of picture contrast upon light exposition. There is consequently a need for photoalignment materials having good aligning properties and simultaneously the ability to induce angles of tilt of variable size, which show an improved stability over a long period of time. In addition high voltage holding ratios should be feasible whenever required.<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that the photoactive copolymer according to claim 1 fulfills at least partly these requirements.<br>
A first aspect of the present invention therefore provides a photoactive copolymer which contains side chains incorporating photoreactive groups and simultaneously side chains of the general formula I:<br><br>

Preferred components for mixtures together with the copolymer of the invention are photoreactive polymers based on acrylate, methacrylate, optionally N-lower-alkyl-substituted acrylamide, methacrylamide, vinyl ether, vinyl ester, styrene derivatives, imides, amic acids and their esters and amidimides where the side chains contain as photoreactive groups substructures of formula II or III.<br><br>
More preferred components for mixtures together with the copolymers of the invention are photopolymers based an imides, amic acids and amic acid esters incorporating cinnamic acid or coumarin derivatives as photoreactive side chains.<br>
Most preferred are mixtures containing a copolymer of the pres¬ent invention based on polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, polyvinl ether and polyvinyl ester together with a photoreactive polymer based on polyimide, polyamic acid and polyamic acid ester.<br>
The content of the copolymer according to the invention in the mixtures can vary in a broad range, depending on the miscibility of the components. Preferred are 
The polymer of formula I is characterized by being readily accessible. It may be prepared using methods that are known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The inventive copolymer, with acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, methacrylamide and styrene derivative as repeating monomer unit, can be prepared in principle according to two different processes. In addition to the direct polymerization of pre-finished monomers there exists the possibility of polymer-analogous reaction of reactive photoactive derivatives with functional polymers.<br>
For the direct polymerization, the monomers and the comonomers are firstly prepared separately from the individual components. The formation of the . copolymers is subsequently effected in a manner known per se under the influence of UV radiation or heat or by the action of radical or ionic catalysts. Potassium peroxodisulfate, dibenzoyl peroxide, azobisisobutyro-nitrile or<br><br>
di-tert-butyl peroxide are examples of radical initiators. Ionic catalysts are alkali-organic compounds such as phenyllithium or naphthylsodium or Lewis acids such as BF3, AICI3, SnCl3 or TiCl4. The monomers can be polymerized in solution, suspension, emulsion or substance.<br>
In the second process a polymer can also be produced in a polymer-analogous reaction from a pre-finished functional . polymer and suitable functionalized side-chain derivatives. Many known processes such as, for example, esteri-fication, trans-esterification, amidation or the etherification are suitable for polymer-analogous reactions.<br>
Such copolymers have a molecular weight MW between 1 000 and 5 000 000, preferably however between 5 000 and 2 000 000, especially advantageously however between 10 000 and 1 000 000.<br>
The preparation of the polyamic acids and polyimides according to the invention is generally carried out analogously to the methods frequently described in the polyimide literature, for example in Plast. Eng. 36 (1996) (Polyimides, fundamentals and applications) .<br>
For example, the polycondensation reaction for the preparation of the polyamic acids is carried out in solution in a polar aprotic organic solvent, such as γ-butyrolactone, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone or N,N-dimethylformamide. In most cases eguimolar amounts of the dianhydride and the diamine are used, that is to say one amino group per anhydride group. If it is desired to stabilize the molecular weight of the polymer, it is possible for that purpose to add an excess or a less-than-stoichiometric amount of one of the two components or to add a monofunctional com-pound in the form of a dicarboxylic<br><br>
Acid monoaiihydride or in the form of a monoamine. Examples of such monofunctional compounds are maleic acid anhydride, phthalic acid anhydride, aniline and so on. The reaction is carried out preferably at a temperature of less than 100 °C.<br>
For the preparation of mixtures containing comparatively apolar polymers like polyacrylates, polymetacrylates, polystyrols with polar polymers like polyamic acids, polyimides and polyamic acid esters, the above polycondensation reaction can . also be performed in the presence of the less polar polymer.<br>
The cyclisation of the polyamic acids to form the polyimides alone or in mixture with other types of polymers can be carried out by heating, that is to say by condensation with removal of water or by other imidisation reactions with reagents. When carried out purely thermally, the imidisation of the polyamic acids is not always complete, that is to say the resulting polyimides may still "contain proportions of polyamic acid. The imidisation reactions are generally carried out at a temperature of from 60 to 250 °C, but preferably at less than 200 °C. In order to achieve imidisation at rather lower temperatures there are additionally mixed into the reaction mixture reagents that facilitate the removal of water. Such reagents are, for example, mixtures consisting of acid anhydrides, such as acetic acid anhydriie, propionic acid anhydride, phthalic acid anhydride, trifluoroacetic acid anhydride, and tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, tributylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethy!.aniline, lutidine, collidine etc. . The amount of reagents used in that case is preferably at least two equival mts of amine and four equivalents of acid anhydride per equivalent of polyamic acid to be condensed.<br>
The  imidisation  reaction  can  be  carried  out  before  or<br><br>
alternatively only after application to a support. The latter variant is preferred especially when the polyimide in question has poor solubility in the customary solvents.<br>
Polyamic acids and polyimides according to the. present invention have an intrinsic viscosity preferably in range of 0.05 to 10 dL/g, more preferably 0.05 to 5 dL/g. Herein, the intrinsic viscosity (ηinh = In ηrel/C) is determined by measuring a solu¬tion containing a polymer in a concentration of 0.5 g/100 ml for its viscosity at 3 0 °C using itf-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as solvent.<br>
The number of monomer building blocks from which the polymer chains according to the invention are synthesized can vary within a wide range. It is generally from 2 to 2000, but especially from 3 to 200.<br>
The copolymer and the polymer mixtures according to the inven-tion may contain additives such as silane-containing compounds and epoxy-containing crosslinking agents for further improving the adhesion of the polymer to a substrate. Example for silane adhesion promoters were described in the literature, for example Plast. Eng. 36 (1996) (Polyimides, fundamentals and appli-cations) . The above epoxy-containing crosslinking agent prefera-bly includes 4, 4 "-methylene-bis- (N-N-diglycidylaniline) , tri-methylolpropane triglycidyl ether, benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarbo-xylic acid 1,2:4,5-N,N"-diglycidyldiimide, polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, N, N-diglyc idyl-eye lohexylamine and the like.<br>
The copolymer and the polymer mixtures according to the invention may contain additives such as a photosensitizer, a photoradical generator and/or a cationic photoinitiator. Example for such additives were 2,2-dimethoxy-phenylethanone, mixture of<br><br>
diphenylmethanone and N,N-dimethylbenzenamine or ethyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoate, xanthone, thioxanthone, IRGACDRE™ 184, 369, 500, 651 and 907 (Ciba), Michler"s ketone, triaryl sulfonium salt and the like.<br>
The copolymer and the polymer mixtures according to the invention can be applied to a support and, after any imidisation step which may be necessary, crosslinked by irradiation with linearly polarized light, that is to say by cycloaddition of their side-chains containing the photoreactive group, there being obtained, depending upon the direction of polarization of the light radiated in, a preferred direction of orientation and of the angle of tilt for liquid crystals that are bought into contact with the orientation layer. By spatially selective irradiation of the molecular units according to the invention it is hence possible for very specific regions of a surface to be aligned and provided with a defined angle of tilt. At the same time the orientation layer so produced is also stabilized by the cycloaddition.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to the use of the polymer according to the invention as orientation layer for liquid crystals, and to their use in liquid crystal cells of • displays, and for layers of optical constructional elements, especially in the production of hybrid layer elements.<br>
Such orientation layers can be produced, for example, by first preparing a solution of the polymer material, which is then applied to a support such tnat homogeneous layers of preferably 0.05 to 50 μm thickness are produced. The support may optionally be provided with further constructional elements such as an electrode layer (for example a glass plate coated with indium-tin oxide  (ITO)).  For applying the solution of the polymer<br><br>
material, different coating techniques may be used like spincoating, miniscuscoating, wirecoating, slotcoating, offsetprinting, flexoprinting, gravurprinting. Then, optionally after prior imidisation, the regions to be oriented can be irradiated, for example, with a highrpressure mercury vapour lamp, a xenon lamp or a pulsed UV laser, using a polarizer and optionally a mask for creating patterns or structures. The irradiation time is dependent upon the material and the output of the light source used. The dimerisation can also be carried out by irradiation of the homogeneous layer using filters that, for example, allow only the radiation suitable for the cross-linking reaction to pass through.<br>
Further aspects of the present invention are:<br>
a)	Optical or electro-optical devices having at least one orientation layer, characterized in that the orientation layer contains photoreactive copolymers incorporating side chains of formula I; and<br>
b)	Use of photoreactive copolymers incorporating side chains of formula I in the construction of unstructured and structured optical elements and multi-layer systems.<br>

Example 4<br>
Preparation of cell with high tilt<br>
A two percent by weight solution of the photoreactive copolymer Poly-3- [fcrans-4- [trans-4- (4-methylphenyl)cyclohexyl] cyclo-hexyl]propyl-2~methacrylate-co-2- [2-methoxy-4- (2-methoxycarbonylvinyl) phenyloxy] ethyl - 2 -methacrylate (1:3) (preparation see Example 1) was prepared using cyclopentanone as a solvent. The solution was stirred for 3 0 minutes at room temperature.<br><br>
This solution was spin-coated at 2000 rpm onto two ITO (indium-tin-oxide) coated glass plates, which were then dried for 30 minutes at 150 °c.<br>
Both substrates were subsequently exposed for one minute to the polarized ultraviolet light of a 350 W high pressure mercury lamp. The - intensity of the uv-light at the substrates position was measured as l.l mW/cm2.<br>
With the coated sides facing inwards, the two plates were assembled into a parallel liquid crystal cell using 20 urn thick glass rods as spacers. The cell was filled with the nematic liquid crystal mixture MLC12000-000 (Merck) at 105 °C, which is well above the clearing temperature (Tc = 90 °C) of the liquid crystal mixture. The cell was subsequently cooled down to 95 °C with a cooling rate of 3 °C/minute, from 95 °C to 85 °C with a cooling rate of 0.3 °C/min. and from 85 °C to 25 °C with a cooling rate of 5 °C/min. Above cooling procedure was applied to allow stress-free alignment of the liquid crystal mixture while passing the clearing temperature. When the cell was investigated with a polarizing microscope, the alignment quality was found to be excellent. With a tilting compensator which was introduced in the microscope the alignment of the long axis of the liquid crystal molecules was found to be parallel to the polarization direction of the uv-light which was used to photoaligr the photopolymer.<br>
The tilt angle generated in the liquid crystal material by the photoaligned layer was measured using the standard crystal rotation method. The commercial instrument TBA105 from Autronics Melchers was used for that purpose. The pretilt angle was evaluated to 89.1° respective to the surface plane.<br><br>
Example 5 Preparation of cell with medium tilt<br>
Following exactly the procedure of Example 4 a second parallel cell was prepared. However,, different to Example 4, a two percent by weight solution of the photoreactive copolymer Poly-3- [trans-4- [trans-4- (3,4-difluorophenyl) cyclohexyl] cyclohexyl] -propyl-2-methacrylate-co-2- [2-methoxy-4- (2-methoxycarbonyl-vinyl) phenyloxy] ethyl-2-methacrylate (1:3) from Example 1 in cyclopentanone was used.<br>
This  solution was  coated onto both substrates which were subsequently photoaligned using the conditions of Example 4.<br>
From the crystal rotation measurement a pretilt angle of 49.6° was observed.<br>
Example 6<br>
Preparation of an orientation layer using blends<br>
Solution 1: A mixture of a photoreactive polyamic acid (9 parts) of the type disclosed in WO-A-99/15576 - also available as ROP-401 from Rolic Research Ltd., Switzerland - and poly- (cholesteryl-2-metha-cry-late) -co-6- [4- (2-methoxycarbonyl-vinyl) -phenyloxy]-hexyl-2-methacrylate (1:4) from Example 1 (1 part) was added to cyclopentanone to achieve a totally 2 %wt solution of polymers. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 10 min. to get a clear solution.<br><br>
 Solution 2:   A solution of photoreactive polyamic acid RQP-401<br>
(97   parts)    and   of   poly-(cholesteryl-2-methacrylate)-co-6-[4-(2-methoxycarbonylvinyl)-phenyloxy]hexyl-2-methacrylate (1:4) (3 parts) was prepared  according  to  the  preparation  of Solution 1.<br>
Solution 1 and Solution 2 were each filtered over a 0.2 urn Teflon filter and applied to a glass plate, which had been coated with indium-tin oxide (ITO) , in a spin-coating apparatus at 3000 rev./min. in the course of 60 seconds. The resulting film was then predried for 15 minutes at 130 °C and then imidised for 1 hour at 200 °C to form the polyimide.<br>
The glass plate so coated was then irradiated for 15 seconds with the linearly polarized uv light of a 350 W high-pressure mercury vapor lamp. A liquid-crystalline mixture of diacrylates was then applied by spin-coating to the irradiated layer and subsequently cross-linked by isotropic UV light for 5 minutes. Under a polarization microscope, a uniaxially double-refractive layer of oriented liquid crystal molecules was observed and a contrast ratio as high as 1500:1 was measured. Using a tilt compensator it was ascertained that the direction of orientation agreed with the direction of polarization of the UV light used for the polyimide layer irradiation.<br>
Example 7<br>
Production of an orientation layer having a defined high angle<br>
of tilt<br>
Two glass plates coated with Solution l according to Example 6 were irradiated for 4 minutes with linearly polarized UV light,<br>
 The direction of incidence of the light being inclined by 40° relative to the plate normal. The direction of polarization of the light was kept in the plane defined by the direction of incidence of the light and the plate normal. From both plates a cell of 20 μm spacing was built such that the illuminated surfaces were facing each other and the previous polarization directions of illumination were parallel. The cell was then filled with liquid crystal mixture MLC12000-000 from Merck at 100 °C (isotropic phase) . The cell was then gradually cooled to room temperature at a rate ranging from 0.1 °C/min to 2 °C/min. Between crossed polarizers a uniformly oriented liquid crystal layer was observed. The tilt angle of this parallel cell, determined by crystal rotation method, was 70°.<br>
Example 8<br>
Production of an orientation layer having a defined low angle of<br>

Following the same procedure as in Example 7 but using Solution 2 of Example 6, a tilt angle of 5.5° has been achieved.<br>
Example 9<br>
Optical stability of tilt angle<br>
. The cell according to Example 8 having an orientation layer exhibiting a defined angle of tilt of 5.5° was subjected to photostability experiments using a focused halogen lamp. The light impact on the sample had a cut-off at 400 nm and an irradiance of 3 W/cm2. After an irradiation time of 600 hours no significant change of the above tilt angle was observed.<br><br>
Example 10<br>
Determination of the voltage holding ratio (VHR)<br>
Two glass plates coated with Solution 2 according to Example 6 were irradiated perpendicularly during 4 minutes with linearly polarized"UV light. From both plates a cell of 10 μm spacing was built such that the illuminated surfaces were facing each other and the previous polarization directions of illumination were parallel. This cell was then maintained at 120°C under high vacuum for 14 hours and thereafter filled with TFT liquid crystal mixture MLC12000-000 from Merck in vacuo at room temperature. Between crossed polarizers a uniformly oriented liquid crystal layer was observed. Prior to testing the voltage holding ratio (VHR) the cell was first subjected to ageing for 50 hours at 120 °c. The voltage decay V (at T = 20 ms) of a voltage surge of 64 us with V0 (V at t = 0) = 0.2 V was then measured over a period of T = 20 ms. The voltage holding ratio then determined, given by VHR = Vrms (t = T)/V0, was 99 % at room temperature and 88 % at 80 °C.<br><br>
