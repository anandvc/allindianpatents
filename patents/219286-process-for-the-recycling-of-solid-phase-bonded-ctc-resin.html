Process for the recycling of solid phase bonded ctc-resin<br>
Trityl resins are useful solid phase bonded protecting groups, originally developed for solid phase peptide synthesis and as well used for solid phase organic synthesis. Solid phase bonded 2-chlorotrityl chloride (2-CTC resin) is commercial available [CBL Patras] and based on crosslinked polystyrene (Ps) or modified polystyrenes (e.g. teritagel, polystyrene grafted with polyethylerieglycol) [1: catalog ACTj NoviabiocherhJ: The 2-<br>

WO 01/85758 A2 [7] discloses the recycling of carboxylic acid (e.g. preferably trifluoroacedic acid) trityl ester resins with HC1 in CH2CI2- Apart of the fact that trifluoroacedic acid trityl esters are subject to hydrolysis [8: ZVPhy. Chem. 113 (1978) 199] and therefore difficult to hancUe, the reexamination of the example given in [7] achieved only 77% of the content of active chloride [6] before use.<br><br><br>
