				<td>PURIFICATION OF MUPIROCIN<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for purification of the antibiotic mupirocin (pseudomonic acid A).<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
It is known that Pseudomonas fluorescens strains are able to biosynthesize, in addition to pseudomonic acid A, other related antibiotics designated by the tetters B-D in small quantities [E. B. Chain, G. Mellows, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans I. 318 (1977); J. P. Clayton et a/., Tetrahedron Lett., 21, 881 (1980); P. J. O. Hanlon, N. H. Rogers, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans I. 2665 (1983)]. Among the pseudomonic acid antibiotics, from a therapeutic point of view the most valuable is pseudomonic acid A, which has a growth inhibiting effect mainly against Gram positive bacteria.<br>
One method for the isolation of pseudomonic acid A from the antibiotic complex-containing culture broth is the liquid-liquid extraction. According to German Patent No. 2227739 and US Patent No. 4289703, soluble barium salts are added to the fermentation broth, then the microorganism cells with the insoluble inactive agents are separated by centrifugation and finally the antibiotics are extracted by methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). The antibiotics are then removed from the methyl isobutyl ketone extract by alkaline water and the resulting alkaline aqueous extract is cleaned by reextraction with methyl isobutyl ketone. The crude product obtained is chromatographed, and an ester derivative is prepared from the pseudomonic acid antibiotic complex and purified with preparative thin layer chromatography. The acid form of the pure antibiotic is obtained by hydrolysis.<br>
Belgian Patent No. 870,855 relates to a process in which the culture broth is extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone and from the extract the active substance is extracted by sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. Materials insoluble in alkaline water are separated by filtration, then the pH of the filtrate is acidified and extracted by methyl isobutyl ketone. Finally the pseudomonic acid A is obtained by the concentration of the extract and crystallization from a methyl isobutyl ketone-n-heptane mixture.<br>
US patent no. 4222942 relates to a process for the isolation of mupirocin by extracting a solution of crude mupirocin preparation in a water immiscible organic solvent with an aqueous media, lowering the pH of said aqueous solution, and extracting the solution with a polar water immiscible organic solvent and thereafter adding a diluent which is sufficiently non-polar to reduce the polarity of, but is miscible with, said polar organic solvent so as to effect crystallization of mupirocin. The steps of this reaction scheme are manifold and, as a consequence, the scheme requires a large quantity of solvent.<br>
US patent 6254921 discloses a process for the isolation of mupirocin comprising extracting an acidified culture broth using a chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon or isobutyl acetate, such that a mupirocin-containing extract is obtained; and purifying the mupirocin from said extract by distributing the extract between an aqueous phase and an organic phase comprising at least one organic solvent and evaporating the organic solvent.<br>
None of the above methods are satisfactory from a commercial and ecological view. Accordingly, there remains a need for a novel method for purification of mupirocin, which is free from at least some of the disadvantages of the known processes and the application of which, in production scale, may result in a high yield of the recovery of the above-mentioned antibiotic.<br>
The present invention provides a method for purification of mupirocin, which meets at least some of the above defined objectives in that it is economically sound and, preferably, less ecologically deleterious, and results in a high yield of mupirocin having a high purity. The method comprises precipitation of mupirocin from an aqueous solution of mupirocin, and dissolution of the precipitate in an organic solvent.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for purifying mupirocin, comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	precipitation of mupirocin from an aqueous solution of mupirocin;<br>
b)	recovery of the precipitate;<br>
c)	dissolution of the precipitate in an organic solvent; and optionally<br>
ci)       recovery of mupirocin from the solvent.<br>
The term "mupirocin" is meant to comprise mupirocin as defined in any of the above-mentioned references, as well as natural occurring and synthetic derivatives thereof. The<br>
term comprises the acidic form and salts thereof, such as the calcium salt, as well as solvates and polymorphic forms of these.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the solution of mupirocin is fermentation broth, such as clarified broth, such as clarified by centrifugation or filtration. The source of the fermentation broth is not crucial, and the broth can be obtained as disclosed in the prior art, for example as disclosed in the above-mentioned references, in US 3977943, 4071536 and 4289703, WO 00/46389 or WO 03/000910. Optionally, the broth can be concentrated before precipitation of mupirocin. Solutions other than fermentation broths can be used, e.g. a solution resulting from chemical synthesis of mupirocin or a derivative thereof.<br>
Mupirocin may be precipitated from the aqueous solution by adding an acid, such as an acid selected from the group consisting of acetic acid; citric acid; sulfuric acid; and hydrochloric acid. When using an acid, the pH during precipitation conveniently is in the range of 2.0 to 6.0, preferably in the range of 3.5 to 5.0, and most preferred in the range of 4.2 to 4.6. In one embodiment the solution is left stirring until mupirocin has precipitated, such as for a period of 10-40 minutes.<br>
The mupirocin containing precipitate may be recovered by centrifugation or filtration, centrifugation being preferred. The centrifugation should be carried out under such conditions that a gel is formed, e.g. by centrifuging for 5-30 minutes at 5000-15000g, or in an continuous centrifuge at 5000-15000g.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the recovered precipitate is dissolved in a polar, substantially water immiscible organic solvent. As solvent, a ketone, e.g. having the formula alkyl-C(=O)-alkyl, such as methyl isobutyl ketone; an ester, e.g. having the formula alkyl-C(=O)-O-alkyl, such as ethyl acetate; an alkanol, e.g. having the formula alkyl-OH, such as n-butanol; or a mixture comprising any of these can be used. Herein, the term "alkyl," when referring to alcohols, refers to aliphatic hydrocarbon groups of greater than four carbons and includes a straight or branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbon group that is saturated or unsaturated and, in other solvents, the term "alkyl" refers to a straight or branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbon group which is saturated or unsaturated and has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more carbon atoms.<br>
Presently it is preferred that the solvent is pure methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). That is the solvent should comprise more that 90% (such as more than 92%, more than 94%, more than 96%, or even more than 98% or 99%) MIBK. If needed, the mupirocin can be recovered from the solvent, such as by crystallization, optionally after water removal from the solvent.<br>
In another embodiment, the method of the invention comprises one or more further steps, in order to obtain a more pure antibiotic. Such steps might be applied before step a) and/or after step d), and/or between steps a) and b) and/or between steps b) and c) and/or after step c), and comprises steps selected from the group consisting of: a decolourisation step; a step for removal of hydrophilic components; a concentration step; an evaporation step; a clarification step; a water removal step; a drying step; a filtration step; an extraction step; and a crystallization step. It is presently preferred that the further step(s) are applied after the step d) above.<br>
The method of the invention is preferably carried out at a temperature between the freezing point of the solutions and room temperature, such as a temperature in the range 0-25°C, more preferred in the range 5-20°C. Optionally drying and evaporation steps can be carried out at an elevated temperature, such as in the range 20-50°C.<br>
The invention also relates to mupirocin obtained by a method of the invention. The mupirocin of the invention is more pure than mupirocin obtained by the methods of the prior art. By the method of the invention, it is possible to obtain mupirocin having a purity of at least 93%, for example at least 95%, preferably least 96%, more preferably least 97% and most preferably even at least 98%. Typically, the mupirocin of the invention has a specific activity of at least 950 ug/mg, and preferably at least 960 ug/mg.<br>
Following the teaching of the prior art (e.g. US 5569672 and US 5594026, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein) it is also possible to generate calcium salts and different polymorphic forms of pseudomonic acid.<br>

Example 3: Repeated aqueous precipitation at low PH<br>
3 ml aqueous precipitate obtained as in Example 2a was dissolved in 16 ml of 8% ammonium hydroxide. pH of the resulting clear solution (pH = 8.5) was adjusted to 4.4 by addition of 3 ml concentrated acetic acid. The sample was left at 4° Celsius over night before centrifugation in a refrigerated centrifuge at 13,000 g for 20 minutes. The supernatant was poured off leaving a gel. Total recovery in the second precipitation was 99%.<br>
Example 4: Dissolution of mupirocin in organic solvent<br>

Aqueous precipitate containing 25 g of mupirocin obtained as in Example 2a was dissolved in 250 ml of ethyl acetate. The mixture was filtered.<br>
Example 5: Further purification<br>
Example 5A: Removal of hydrophilic components<br>
180 ml of mupirocin in MIBK obtained as in Example 4a was transferred to a separation funnel and extracted with 20 ml of MilliQ water. The two phases were left to separate and the aqueous phase was removed and discarded. The extraction of the organic phase was repeated 4 times and mupirocin was thereafter recovered from the organic phase.<br>
Example 5B: Color removal by carbon treatment<br>
180 ml of mupirocin in MIBK obtained as in Example 4a was added 4.5 g of activated carbon (Norit C extra) and left stirring for 30 minutes before the carbon was filtered off and the filter cake washed with 30 ml MIBK.<br>
Example 6: Crystallization<br>
Example 6A: Preparation of pseudomonic acid polymorphous Form I 200ml of the organic solution obtained in Example 5a, containing 17 g mupirocin, was evaporated under vacuum In a laboratory rotary evaporator (60 mbar, 40°C). The evaporation was stopped when 102 ml solution was left in the product flask. 5 ml heptane was added and the solution was left with stirring at room temperature. After 22 hours with stirring the crystalline material was filtered. The filter cake was washed three times with 40 ml MIBK, and thereafter dried (
Example 6B: Preparation of pseudomonic acid polymorphous Form II 100ml of organic solution, containing 17 g mupirocin, obtained as described in Example 5b, is added 150 ml heptane over about 2 hours with stirring.
