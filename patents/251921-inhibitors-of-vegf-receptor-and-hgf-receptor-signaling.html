INHIBITORS OF VEGF RECEPTOR AND HGF RECEPTOR SIGNALING<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This invention relates to the inhibition of VEGF receptor signaling and HGF receptor signaling. More particularly, the invention relates to compounds and methods for the inhibition of VEGF receptor signaling and HGF receptor signaling.<br>
Summary of the Related Art<br>
[0002]     Angiogenesis is an important component of certain normal physiological processes such as embryogenesis and wound healing, but aberrant angiogenesis contributes to some pathological disorders and in particular to tumor growth.1'2 VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor A) is a key factor promoting neovascularization (angiogenesis) of tumors.3-7 VEGF induces endothelial cell proliferation and migration by signaling through two high affinity receptors, the fins-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt-1, and the kinace insert domain-containing receptor, KDR.8,9,10. These signaling responses are critically dependent upon receptor dirnerization and activation of intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity. The binding of VEGF as a disulfide-linked homodimer stimulates receptor dimerization and activation of the RTK domain 11.The kinase activity autophosphorylales cytoplasmic receptor tyrosine residues, which then serve as binding sites for molecules involved in the propagation of a signaling cascade. Although multiple pathways are likely to be elucidated for both receptors, KDR signaling is most extensively studied, with a mitogenic response suggested to involve ERK-1 and ERK-2 mitogen-activated protein kinases 12. [0003]     Disruption of VEGF receptor signaling is a highly attractive therapeutic target<br>
in cancer, a CLIENT-HOST DIVIDED ARCHITECTURE FOR INPUT-OUTPUT COORDINATION ure endothelium remains relatively quiescent (with the exception ot the temale reproductive system and wound healing). A number of experimental approaches to inhibiting VEGF signaling have been examined, including use of neutralizing antibodies 13,l4,15, receptor antagonists 16, soluble receptors 17, antisense constructs18 and dominant-negative strategies<br>
19<br>
[0004]     Despite the attractiveness of anti-angiogenic therapy by VEGF inhibition alone, several issues may limit this approach. VEGF expression levels can themselves be elevated by numerous diverse stimuli and perhaps most importantly, the hypoxic state of tumors resulting from VEGFr inhibition, car. leal to the induction of factors that themselves<br><br>
WO 2006/010264	PCT/CA2005/001177<br>
promote tumor invasion and metastasis thus, potentially undermining the impact of VEGF inhibitors as cancer therapeutics20<br>
[0005]     The HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) and the HGF receptor, c-met, are<br>
implicated in the ability of tumor cells to undermine the activity of VEGF inhibition20.<br>
HGF derived from either stromal fibroblasts surrounding tumor cells or expressed from the<br>
tumor itself has been suggested to play a critical role in tumor angiogenesis, invasion and<br>
metastasis 21,22. For example, invasive growth of certain cancer cells is drastically enhanced<br>
by tumor-stromal interactions involving the HGF/c-Met (HGF receptor) pathway 23,24,25<br>
HGF, which was originally identified as a potent mitogen forhepatocytes26,27 is primarily<br>
secreted from stromal cells, and the secreted HGF can promote motility and invasion of<br>
various cancer cells that express c-Met in a paracrine manner 28,29,30. Binding of HGF to c-<br>
Met leads to receptor phosphorylation and activation of Ras/mitogen-activated protein<br>
kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, thereby enhancing malignant behaviors of cancer cells<br>
30&gt;31. Moreover, stimulation of the HGF/c-met pathway itself can lead to the induction of<br>
VEGF expression, itself contributing directly to angiogenic activity32'<br>
[0006]     Thus, anti-tumor anti-angiogenic strategies or approaches that target both<br>
VEGF/VEGFr signaling and HGF/c-met signaling may circumvent the ability of rumor cells<br>
to overcome VEGF inhibition alone and may represent improved cancer therapeutics.<br>
[0007]	Here we describe small molecules that are potent inhibitors of both the VEGF<br>
receptor KDR and the HGF receptor c-met.<br>

proliferative diseases. The compounds of the invention are dual function inhibitors, capable<br>
of inhibiting both VEGF and HGF. Accordingly, the invention provides new inhibitors of<br>
VEGF receptor signaling and HGF receptor signaling, including the VEGF receptor KDR<br>

signaling, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, excipient, or diluent.<br>
[0012]     In a fourth aspect, the invention provides a method of simultaneously<br>
inhibiting VEGF receptor signaling and HGF receptor signaling in a cell, comprising<br>
contacting a cell in which inhibition of VEGF receptor signaling and HGF receptor<br>

[0013]     The foregoing merely summarizes certain aspects of the invention and is not<br>
intended to be limiting in nature. These aspects and other aspects and embodiments are<br>
described more fully below.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TIIE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0014]     The invention provides compounds and methods for inhibiting the VEGF receptor iCDR and the HGF receptor c-met. The invention also provides compositions and methods for treating cell proliferative diseases and conditions. The patent and scientific literature referred to herein establishes knowledge that is available to those with skill in the art. The issued patents, applications, and references that are cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. In the case of inconsistencies, the present disclosure will prevail.<br>
[0015]     For purposes of the present invention, the following definitions will be used (unless expressly stated otherwise):<br>
[0016]     The terms" inhibitor of VEGF receptor signaling" and "inhibitor of HGF receptor signaling" are used to identify a compound having a structure as defined herein, which is capable of interacting with a HGF receptor and a VEGF receptor and inhibiting the activity of HGF and VEGF. In some preferred embodiments, such reduction of activity is at least about 50%, more preferably at least about 75%, and still more preferably at least about 90%.<br>
[0017]     For simplicity, chemical moieties aie defined and referred to throughout primarily as univalent chemical moieties (e.g., alkyl, aryl, etc.). Nevertheless, such terms are also used to convey corresponding multivalent moieties under the appropriate structural circumstances clear to those skilled in the art. For example, while an "alkyl" moiety generally refers to a monovalent radical (e.g. CH3-CH2-), in certain circumstances a bivalent linking moiety can be "alkyl," in which case those skilled in the art will understand the alkyl to be a divalent radical (e.g., -CH2-CH2-), which is equivalent to the term "alkylene."<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/010264	PCT/CA2005/OO1177<br>
(Similarly, in circumstances in which a divalent moiety is required and is stated as being "aryl," those skilled in the art will understand that the term "aryl" refers to the corresponding divalent moiety, arylene.) All atoms are understood to have their normal number of valences for bond formation (i.e., 4 for carbon, 3 for N, 2 for O, and 2,4, or 6 for S, depending on the oxidation state of the S). On occasion a moiety may be defined, for example, as (A)3-B-, wherein a is 0 or 1. In such instances, when a is 0 the moiety is B- and when a is 1 the moiety is A-B-. Also, a number of moieties disclosed herein exist in multiple tautomeric forms, all of which are intended to be encompassed by any given tautomeric structure.<br>

These schemes serve to exemplify some procedures that can be used to make the compounds of the invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that other general synthetic procedures may be used. The compounds of the invention can be prepared from starting components that are commercially available. Any kind of substitutions can be made to the starting components to obtain the compounds of the invention according to procedures that are well known to those skilled in the art. I. Synthesis (general schemes)<br>
[0229]   Thieno[3,2-b]pyridine based compounds of formula A-Q may be prepared according to the procedures illustrated in the scheme A. Thus, thieno[3,2-b]pyridine-7-ol (I) upon treatment with POCI3 is converted to the chloride II. Treatment of this material with a strong base such as rc-BuLi followed by an addition of carbon dioxide affords the carboxylate HI which is used without purification in the next step, providing the acyi chloride IV (presumably as a hydrochloride salt) upon its reaction with oxalyl chloride. The acyl chloride IV is used for the next step without further purification as well: upon its reaction with different primary and secondary amines the compound IV is converted to a variety of primary and secondary amides V which can further be derivatized via a substitution of the chlorine atom in the pyridine ring.<br>
[0230]   Thus, V reacting with substituted 4-nitrophenols in a high boiling point solvent, such as diphenyl ether in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, produced the nitro derivatives VI which then are reduced to the amines VII upon treatment with a mixture NiCk/NaBKt (or other conventional reagents). The amines VII also may be used for the next step without further purification, and upon treatment with 2-phenylacetyl isothiocyanates afford phenylacetylthioureas VIII bearing the amido-substituents such as the ones shown in the scheme A.<br>

[0237]   Thus, XVIII reacting with substituted 4-nitrophenols in a high boiling point solvent, such as diphenyl ether in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, produced the nitro derivatives XIX which are then reduced to the amines XX upon treatment with a mixture NiCk/NaBHj (or other conventional reagents). The amines XX could be used for the next step without further purification, and upon treatment with 2-phenylacetyl isothiocyanates afford the phenylacetylthioureas XXI bearing the heteroaryl substituents such as the ones shown in the scheme C. Heteroaryls shown in the scheme B, in turn may bear additional substituents exemplified (but not limited to) alky Is, amines, alkylamino, aminoaikyls, alkoxyalkyls, hydroxyalkyls, alkylsulfonylalkyls, etc.- known in the art as solubilizing functionalities.<br>

[0239]   Pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine based compounds of formula B-0 may be prepared according to the procedures illustrated in the scheme D. Treatment of the 4-chloro-7i?-pyrro!o[2,3-d]pyrimidine (XXII) with an alkyl halide in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride affoids the alkylated chlorides XXIII, which reacting with substituted 4-nitrophenols in a high boiling point solvent, such as diphenyl ether in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate, produced the nitro derivatives XXIV reduced to the amines XXV upon hydrogenation (or treatment with conventional reducing agents).

[0241]   Thieno[3,2-b]pyridine based phenylacetylureas of formula A-0 bearing aryl substituents may be prepared according to the procedures illustrated in the scheme E. Thus vhloride II upon lithiation and subsequent bromination is converted to the bromide XXVII that reacting with substituted 4-nitrophenols produces more elaborated compound XXVIII. This material can be used for Suzuki type (and like) reactions with a variety of aryl boronic acids (or boronates), in particular with the ones functionalized with basic groups, thus providing compounds XXIX.

These phenols reacting with different alcohols (Mitsunobu reaction), in particular functional ized with basic groups, provide compounds XXXIII.

In Vitro Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Assays (c-Met/HGF receptor and VEGF receptor KDR)<br>
[0597]   These tests measure the ability of compounds to inhibit the enzymatic activity of recombinant human c-Met/HGF receptor and VEGF receptor enzymatic activity. [0598]   A 1.3-kb cDNA corresponding to the intracellular domain of c-Met or c-Met IC (Genbank accession number NP000236-1 amino acid 1078 to 1337) was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of the pBlueBacHis2A vector (Invitrogen) for the production of a histidine-tagged version of that enzyme. This constuct was used to generate recombinant baculovirus using the Bac-N-Blue™ system according to the manucfacturer's instructions "(Invitrogen)<br>
[0599]   The c-Met IC protein was expressed in Hi-5 cells (Trichoplnsia Ni) upon infection with recombinant baculovirus construct. Briefly, Hi-5 cells grown in suspension and maintained m serum-free medium (SfflOO II supplemented with gentamycin) at a cell density of about 2 X 106 cells/ml were infected with the abovementioned viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2 during 72 hours at 27°C with agitation at 120 rpm on a rotary shaker. Infected cells were harvested by centrifugation at 398g for 15 min. Cell pellets were frozen at -S0°C until purification was performed.<br>
[0600]   All steps described in cell extraction and purification were performed at 4°C. Frozen Hi-5 cell pellets infected with the C-Met IC recombinant baculovirus were thawed and gently resuspended in Buffer A (20mM Tris pH 8.0,10% giycerol, lug/ml pepstatin, 2ug/ml Aprotinin and leupeptin, 50µg/ml PMSF, 50µg/mi TLCK and 10µM E64, 0.5mM DTT and lmM Levamisole) using 3 ml of buffer per gram of cells.

Briefly, Sf5 ceiis grown in suspension and maintained in serum-free medium (Sf900 II supplemented with gentamycin) at a cell density of about 2 X 106 cells/ml were infected with the abovementioned viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 during 72 hours at 27°C with agitation at 120 rpm on a rotary shaker. Infected cells were harvested by centrifitgation at 39Sg for 15 min. Cell pellets were frozen at -80°C until purification was performed. [0604]    All steps described in cell extraction and purification were performed at 4°C.

[0606]   Inhibition of c-Met/HGF receptor and VEGFR/KDR. was measured in a DELF1A™ assay (Perkin Elmer). The substrate poly(Glu4,Tyr) was immobilized onto black high-binding polystyrene 96-well plates. The coated plates were washed and stored at 4 °C. During the assay, enzymes were pre-incubated with inhibitor and Mg-ATP on ice in polypropylene 96-well platesTor 4 minutes, and then transferred to the coated plates. The subsequent kinase reaction took place at 30 °C for 10-30 minutes. ATP concentrations in the assay were 10 uM for C-Met (5X the Km) and 0.6 uM for VEGFR/KDR (2X the Km). Enzyme concentration was 25 nM (C-Met) or 5 nM (VEGFR/KDR). After incubation, the kinase reactions were quenched with EDTA and the platen were washed. Phosphorylated product was detected by incubation with Europium-iabeled anti-phosphotyrosine MoAb. After washing the plates, bound MoAb was detected by time-resolved fluorescence in a Gemini SpectraMax reader (Molecular Devices). Compounds were evaluated over a range of concentrations and ICso's (concentration of compounds giving 50% inhibition of enzymacic activity) were determined. C-Met phosphoryiatioR eell-basetl assay<br>
[0607]   This test measures the ability of compounds to inhibit HGF stimulated auto-phosphorylation of the c-Met/HGF receptor itself in a whole cell system. [0608]   MNNGHOS cell line expressing TPR-MET fusion protein were purchased from ATCC. The TPR-MET is the product of a chromosomal translocation placing the TPR locus on chromosome 1 upstream of the MET gene on chromosome 7 encoding for it's cyioplasmic region catalytic domain. Dimerization of the Mr 65,000 TPR-Met oncoprotein through a leucine zipper motif encoded by the TPR portion leads to constitutive activation of the met kinase. Constitutive autophosphorylation occurs on residues Tyr361/365/366 of TPR-Met. These residues are homologous to Tyrl230/1234/]235 of MET which become phosphorylated upon dimerization of the receptor upon HGF binding.

Tyr361/365/366 of TPR-Met were detected with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against tyrosine phosphorylated Met (Biosource International) and secondary antibodies anti-rabbit -horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) by chemiluminescenee assays (Amersham, ECL) were performed according to theT manufacturer's instructions and followed by film exposure. Signal was quantitated by densitometry on Alpha-Imager. IC50 values were defined as the dose required to obtain 50% inhibition of the maximal HGF stimulated phosphorylated c-Met levels.<br>
In Vivo Solid Tamor Disease Model<br>
[0611]   This test measures the capacity of compounds to inhibit solid tumor growth. [06121   Tumor xenografts were established in the flank of female athymic CD1 mice (Charles River Inc.). by subcutaneous injection of 1X106U87, A431 or SKLMS cells/mouse. Once established, tumors were then serially passaged s.c. in nude mice hosts. Tumor fragments from these host animals were used in subsequent compound evaluation experiments. For compound evaluation experiments female nude mice weighing approximately 20g were implanted s.c. by surgical implantation with tumor fragments of ~30 mg from donor tumors. When the tumors were approximately 100 mm3 in size (~7-10 days following implantation), the animals were randomized a separated into treatment and control groups. Each group contained 6-S tumor-bearing mice, each of which was ear-tagged and followed individually throughout the experiment<br>
[0613]   Mice were weighed and tumor measurements are taken by calipers three times weekly, starting on Day 1. These tumor measurements were converted to tumor volume by the well-known formula (L+W/4)3 4/3#. The experiment was terminated when the control tumors reached a size of approximately 1500 mm3. In this model, the change in mean tumor volume for a compound treated group / the change in mean tumor volume of the control group (non-treated or vehicle treated) x 100 (##T / ##C) was subtracted from 100 to give the percent tumor growth inhibition (%TGI) for each test compound. In addition to tumor volumes, body weight of animals were monitored twice weekly for up to 3 weeks.<br>
