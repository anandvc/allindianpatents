				<td>I. Field<br><br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to the field of computer graphics and, more specifically, to techniques for efficiently rendering 3D images on a stereo- enabled display.<br><br>
II. Background<br><br>
[0002] Computational complexity of stereo video processing is a major factor in rendering of 3D graphics and, specifically, in visualization of 3D scenes and video games in low-power (i.e., battery-powered) devices, such as mobile phones, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) devices, and the like.<br><br>
[0003] In general, the difficulties in rendering of 3D graphics on a stereo-enabled display (e.g., autostereoscopic or stereoscopic display) come from the efficiency and reality aspects of the stereo video processing. Limited computational resources of the low-power devices may cause rendering of 3D graphics to be an excessively time- consuming routine. Despite the considerable efforts devoted to increasing performance of stereo video processing, further improvements would be desirable. [0004] There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to efficiently implement reality-enhanced rendering of 3D video images on a stereo-enabled display.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br><br>
[0005] Techniques for efficient rendering of 3D video images on a stereo-enabled display are described herein. In an embodiment, during a 3D model-view transformation of video data, facets facing away from a viewer are culled. For a first view (for example, Left View), first foreground facets corresponding to scene elements disposed closer than a pre-determined depth threshold and first background facets corresponding to such elements disposed beyond the pre-determined depth threshold are selectively defined. For a second view, second foreground facets corresponding to the <br><br>
scene elements disposed closer than the pre-determined depth threshold are defined, whereas the first background facets are adopted as second background facets. Lighting is determined for the first foreground facets, the first background facets, and the second foreground facets. Screen mapping and scene rendering calculations are performed for the first view based on the first foreground facets and the first background facets, and based on the second foreground facets and the first background facets for the second view, respectively.<br><br>
[0006] In one design, the method is used for visualization of video images on a stereoscopic or autosterescopic display of a battery-powered device, such as a mobile phone, a mobile computer, a video game platform, or a PDA device. [0007] Various aspects and embodiments of the invention are described in further detail below.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br><br>
[0008] FIG. 1 shows a flow diagram illustrating a method for rendering 3D video images on a stereo-enabled display.<br><br>
[0009] FIG. 2 shows a schematic diagram illustrating a method for determining a depth threshold during facet classification procedure used in the method of FIG. 1. [0010] FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of an exemplary device adapted for using the method of FIG. 1.<br><br>
[0011] To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures, except that suffixes may be added, when appropriate, to differentiate such elements. The images in the drawings are simplified for illustrative purposes and are not depicted to scale. It is contemplated that features or steps of one embodiment may be beneficially incorporated in other embodiments without further recitation.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br><br>
[0012] Referring to the figures, FIG. 1 depicts a flow diagram illustrating a method 100 for rendering 3D video images on a stereo-enabled display in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In exemplary applications, the method 100 is used to reduce power consumption and complexity of calculations for displaying stereo <br><br>
graphics on battery-powered (i.e., low-power) devices and to improve performance and, specifically, depth and reality sensations of the visualized images. The battery-powered devices may include, without limitation, a mobile phone, a mobile computer, a video game platform, or a PDA device.<br><br>
[0013] The method 100 generates separate views for the left and right eyes (i.e. Left and Right views) by visualizing a scene from different angles and observation points, where depth sensation is enhanced by reproducing binocular parallax caused by the interocular distance between viewer's eyes. The views are selectively guided to the left and right eyes of a viewer and, from the viewer's perspective, differences between the Left and Right views increase the depth and reality sensations. [0014] Sequences of the method steps corresponding to rendering the Left and Right Views are denoted as 103 and 105, respectively. Hereafter, suffixes "A" and "B" are used to differentiate between processes that are performed on inputted video data for rendering the Left and Right Views. Illustratively, the suffix "A" identifies method steps performed for rendering the Left View.<br><br>
[0015] In various embodiments, method steps of the method 100 are performed in the depicted order or at least two of these steps or portions thereof may be performed contemporaneously, in parallel, or in a different order. For example, steps 140A and 140B, or steps 160A and 170B may be performed contemporaneously or in parallel, and step 152A may be performed before step 150A. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the order of executing at least a portion of other discussed below method steps, processes, or routines may also be modified.<br><br>
[0016] At step HOA, a 3D model-view transformation of inputted video data is performed for the Left View. During a 3D model-view transform routine, a viewer is placed at a center facing the z-dimension of a 3D world coordinate system and geometric objects in the scene are mapped into Left View facets (e.g., triangle facets). [0017] At step 120A, to save computational resources and, as such, increase efficiency of video processing, the facets that are facing away from the viewer (i.e., invisible to the viewer facets) are culled, or removed, from a database of the facets to be used for rendering the Left View.<br><br>
[0018] At step 130A, the remaining Left View facets (i.e., facets corresponding to visible to the viewer's left eye elements of the geometric objects of the scene) are <br><br>
classified in two categories. A first category includes Left View foreground facets corresponding to scene elements disposed closer than a pre-determined depth threshold<br><br>
Z0 (shown in FIG. 2). Accordingly, the second category includes Left View background facets corresponding to the scene elements disposed beyond the pre-determined depth threshold.<br><br>
[0019] The classification of the facets is based on the observation that disparity between the geometric objects in the scene, as measured in units of pixels between image points in the Left and Right Views, decreases as a distance from the viewer to the objects increases and, eventually, becomes zero when these objects are disposed away far enough from the viewer.<br><br>
[0020] The depth threshold Zo may be defined as a maximum distance from the viewer beyond which any object, when is observed by either one of the viewer's eyes, corresponds to the same pixels (discussed in detail below in reference to FIG. 2).<br><br>
Correspondingly, shading of the objects disposed beyond the depth threshold Z0 may be performed for only one view (herein, the Left View), as discussed below in reference to steps 170A and 170B.<br><br>
[0021] At step 140A, a lighting process is performed to determine color properties for the Left View foreground facets and the Left View background facets.<br><br>
[0022] At step 150A, a 3D-to-2D perspective transformation is performed to project the Left View foreground facets onto a 2D image plane.<br><br>
[0023] At step 152A, the 3D-to-2D perspective transformation is performed for the<br><br>
Left View background facets.<br><br>
[0024] At step 160A, in the 2D image plane, a screen mapping process is performed for the Left View. The screen mapping process scales the Left View foreground facets and the Left View background facets to fit the size of a visible screen of the display, thus removing geometric objects or portions thereof that fall outside the screen. During step 16OA, at least a portion of data corresponding to screen mapping of the Left View background facets is selectively saved in a respective memory medium<br><br>
(e.g., random access memory (RAM)) for a future use in calculations of the Right View, as discussed below in reference to step 160B.<br><br>
[0025] At step 170A, a screen rendering process is performed for the Left View.<br><br>
The screen rendering process includes at least a portion of the following computational <br><br>
routines: (i) a shading routine determining intensity values for pixels rendering visible to the viewer portions of the Left View foreground and background facets, (ii) a Hidden Surface Removal (HSR) routine determining and removing invisible to the viewer portions of the Left View foreground and background facets, (iii) a texture mapping routine converting the visible Left View foreground and background facets into Left View object facets, and (iv) a blending routine selectively combining pixels of the Left View object facets to define properties of the pixels.<br><br>
[0026] During step 170A, at least a portion of data corresponding to screen rendering of the Left View background facets is selectively saved in the memory medium for a future use in calculations of the Right View, as discussed below in reference to step 170B.<br><br>
[0027] At step HOB, the 3D model- view transformation of the inputted video data is performed for the Right View. Using computational results of steps 120A and 130A (shown with a link 121A), during the transform routine vertices of triangle facets are filtered in a manner providing that only Right View foreground facets of visible to the viewer's right eye elements of the geometric objects are generated. Collectively, these Right View facets correspond to the scene elements disposed closer than the predetermined depth threshold Zo. In addition, the Left View background facets (defined at preceding step 130A) are adopted as Right View background facets. [0028] Culling the facets facing away from the viewer based only on a one-side view (i.e., Left View) significantly reduces the amount of video data processing, but, in some instances, may cause approximation errors in rendering of the Right View. However, experiments and computer simulations have demonstrated that closeness of the viewer's eyes to one another allows, in most applications, to maintain such errors at an acceptably low level.<br><br>
[0029] At step 140B, a lighting process is performed to determine color properties for the Right View foreground facets.<br><br>
[0030] At step 150B, a 3D-to-2D perspective transformation projecting the Right View foreground facets onto a 2D image plane is performed.<br><br>
[0031] At step 160B, in the 2D image plane, a screen mapping process is performed for the Right View. The screen mapping process of step 16OB scales the Right View foreground facets to fit the size of the visible screen of the display and, additionally, <br><br>
adopts saved at step 160A computational results for screen mapping of the Left View background facets as screen mapping data for the Right View background facets (shown using a link 161A). In operation, utilization of the results of calculations performed during step 160A reduces an amount of data processing and computational complexity of the screen mapping process for the Right View.<br><br>
[0032] At step 170B, a screen rendering process is performed for the Right View. The screen rendering process of step 17OB includes at least a portion of the following computational routines: (i) a shading routine determining intensity values for pixels rendering visible to the viewer portions of the Right View foreground facets, (ii) a Hidden Surface Removal (HSR) routine determining and removing invisible to the viewer portions of the Right View foreground facets, (iii) adopting (shown using a link 171A) saved at step 170A results of screen rendering the Left View background facets as screen rendering data for the Right View background facets, (iv) a texture mapping routine converting the visible Right View foreground facets and the visible Left View background facets into Right View object facets, and (v) a blending routine selectively combining pixels of the Right View object facets to define properties of screen pixels. [0033] Due to utilization of the results of calculations performed, at steps 160a and 170A, for the Left View background facets, an amount data processing and computational complexity of the screen rendering process for the Right View is further significantly reduced.<br><br>
[0034] At step 175, using computational results of the blending routines of steps 170A and 170B in a frame forming process, the 3D image contained in the inputted video data is visualized on an autostereoscopic display.<br><br>
[0035] Alternatively, at step 180, using results of the blending routines of steps 170A and 170B, an anaglyph image is generated and, at step 185, the frame forming process produces the corresponding 3D image on a stereoscopic display. [0036] In operation, the discussed above method steps are cyclically repeated to sequentially visualize, in a form of stereo graphics, images contained in inputted data streams.<br><br>
[0037] In exemplary embodiments, the method 100 may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof in a form of a computer program product comprising one or more computer-executable instructions. When <br><br>
implemented in software, the computer program product may be stored on or transmitted using a computer-readable medium, which includes computer storage medium and computer communication medium.<br><br>
[0038] The term "computer storage medium" refers herein to any medium adapted for storing the instructions that cause the computer to execute the method. By way of example, and not limitation, the computer storage medium may comprise solid-sate memory devices, including electronic memory devices (e.g., RAM, ROM, EEPROM, and the like), optical memory devices (e.g., compact discs (CD), digital versatile discs (DVD), and the like), or magnetic memory devices (e.g., hard drives, flash drives, tape drives, and the like), or other memory devices adapted to store the computer program product, or a combination of such memory devices.<br><br>
[0039] The term "computer communication medium" refers herein to any physical interface adapted to transmit the computer program product from one place to another using for example, a modulated carrier wave, an optical signal, a DC or AC current, and the like means. By way of example, and not limitation, the computer communication medium may comprise twisted wire pairs, printed or flat cables, coaxial cables, fiberoptic cables, digital subscriber lines (DSL), or other wired, wireless, or optical serial or parallel interfaces, or a combination thereof.<br><br>
[0040] FIG. 2 shows a schematic diagram 200 illustrating a method for determining the depth threshold Z0 during facet classification procedure used in the method 100 of FIG. 1. In particular, FIG. 2 depicts fields of sight 201L and 201R for the left (L) and right eyes of the viewer, a 3D point T(x, y, z) in a displayed scene 210, a projection plane 202, and the depth threshold Zo.<br><br>
[0041] Coordinates Tl and T2 of projected points of the 3D point T(x, y, z) on the projection plane 202 for the left (Tl) and right (T2) eyes of the viewer may be calculated using the following equations:<br><br><br>
Tl = Eq. (2) <br><br>
where A and B are model- view transform matrixes of the 3D point T(x, y, z) for the left and right eyes of the viewer, respectively, and C is the projection and screen mapping matrix.<br><br>
[0042] When the 3D point T(x, y, z) is located farther than the depth threshold Z0, in the projection plane 202, the projected points overlap. Accordingly, when the 3D point T(x, y, z) is located closer than the depth threshold Z0, the projected points are shifted horizontally and, in the projection plane 202, a distance between these points defines a disparity d = Xl -X2 between the Left and Right Views, where Xl and X2 are horizontal coordinates of Tl and T2. For the 3D points located beyond the depth threshold Z0, the disparity is greater than 1 (i.e., |d| &gt;1), and pixels corresponding to the Left and Right Views overlap.<br><br>
[0043] Using the equations (1) and (2) and based on the monotonic property of the perspective viewing (i.e., an object monotonically appears smaller as the distance between the object and a viewer increases), the depth threshold Z0 may be calculated by solving the equation<br><br>
Tl -Tl = = C(A -B) Eq. (4)<br><br>
and choosing a maximal component among m solutions z^ of the equation (4) for sampling vertices in the displayed scene, i.e., Zo = max(zi, Z2,...xm), wherein l=k=m. A triangle facet generated during a 3D model-view transformation (steps HOA, HOB of the method 100) is classified as a foreground facet when all of its vertices are located closer than the depth threshold Z0, otherwise the facet is classified as a background facet.<br><br>
[0044] FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of an exemplary device 300 adapted for using the method 100 of FIG. 1. Illustratively, the device 300 (e.g., a mobile phone, a mobile computer, a video game platforms, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) device, and the like) includes a stereoscopic or autostereoscopic display 310, a processor 320, a memory 330, support circuits 340, an input/output (I/O) module 350, and user controls 360.<br><br>
[0045] The memory 330 (e.g., dynamic random excess memory (DRAM), hard drive, compact disc (CD), or any other electronic, magnetic, or optical computer <br><br>
readable medium) contains, among other program codes, a program code that, when executed by the processor 320, facilitates execution of the method 100. The support circuits 340 collectively include buses, circuits, and devices integrating functional components of the device 300 in an operable unit. Video data is provided to the device 300 via the input/output (I/O) module 350 and then processed by the processor 320 to generate stereo graphics imagery on the display 310.<br><br>
