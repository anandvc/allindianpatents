TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an ink refilling device, more particularly, to an ink jet printer for refilling printer cartridge.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Ink jet printers are each equipped with an ink container for supplying ink to the print head. A replaceable printer cartridge is widely used as the means for providing the new supply. Such printer cartridges may be in the form of a simple ink contamer or in a fonn that is unified with a printer head, In the present application, the term 'printer cartridge" covers both types and therefore can include a replaceable cartridge, at least a part of which constitutes an ink container.<br>
Disposable printer cartridges have a head portion and an mk containing portion capable of supplying ink to the head portion. The ink containing portion is usually made of a non-transparent material for the purpose of protecting the properties of the ink m the container thereof.<br>
Today, a majority of the printer cartridges for ink jet printers sold are a one¬way product, i.e. it has to be discarded after tiie depletion of the ink supply. This is highly undesirable on economic reasoning since such depleted printer cartridges, but for their ink depletion, are still functional and this includes especially, valuable components such as the nozzle plates through which ink is ejected.<br>
In addition, environmental concerns also call for the "reuse" of printer cartridges.<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an apparatus that is capable of refilling printer cartridges. With such objective, there is a widely used method whereby an ink supply container in ±e form of a simple injector mounts to a joint portion of the printer cartridge, and the ink contamer is caused to collapse thereby to inject ink into the printer cartridge to render the printer cartridge reusable.<br>
One disadvantage of such a prior art refilling method is that the quality of ink required in the printer cartridge is uncertain since the ink container of the cartridge is not visible. This is especially so where refilling is to be as a precautionary exercise, ie; before full depletion. Moreover, where the mk being supplied to the printer cartridge is supplied at an excessive pressure or at an excessive rate its flow can divert. Therefore, a desired quantity of ink may not be properly delivered.<br>
Manual refill kits for printer cartridges are available in the market, However, such manual refill kits come with too many parts and they require lengthy procedures to be followed by users in order to affect the refill process. If users are not familiar with the refiUmg procedure, it can result m ink leaking fi-om the<br>
a.<br><br>
cartridge during the refilling process and feus causmg an unnecessary mess to die users' equipment.<br>
To overcome at least some of these difficulties or to provide an alternative to such ink refillmg supplies and apparatus and such mk refilling method one or more of the following is desirable:<br>
1.	The quantity of the ink required for tiie ink refilling process is as close as possible to the quantity of the ink filled mto the printer cartridge. While usage efficiency of the refilling ink can be achieved, it too enables the size of die consumable ink supply device to be reduced.<br>
2.	The mefliod of refilling is simplified and thus users can affect die refill easily.<br>
3.	The refilled printer cartridge is still capable of providing high quality printing.<br>

DETAE^ED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention offers the users a method to refill a printer cartridge of their ink jet printer widiout difSculty.<br>
The present invention preferably comes with a holder tray to enable the printer cartridge and the ink replenishment cartridge be simply located as part of a docking procedure. By closing the holder tray, the printer cartridge will then in contact with a sealing rubber within tiie device, so to complete the communication between the printer cartridge and the flow system includes conduits (eg; plastic tubes) and a bidirectional a pump.<br>
Various light indicators and sensors are incorporated. Once the holder tray is properly closed, these light indicators and sensors are able to indicate to the user that the printer cartridge and/or the ink replenishment cartridge are now present in the device system respectively.<br>
The ink replenishment cartridge witiiin the device is in connection with the filling circuit of the flow system via two metal needles or cannula. These needles will each penetrate through a rubber seal of the ink replenishment cartridge, one in the ink supply chamber (eg; a collapsible blow moulded bottle) and the ink receiver defined in the cartridge housing. See our patent applications filed simultaneously herewith. The two preferably metal needles together wiUi a motorised pump ensures movement of the refill ink via various Jinked tubes as welJ as receipt of waste ink thus can be effected.<br>
The pump is preferably capable to perform a reversing pumping direction. With such function, waste ink can then be transferred back to the ink receive or receptacle chamber of preferably the ink replenishment cartridge.<br>
The overall system includes various valves. These valves are mstalled not only to regulate pressure and to prevent excessive pressure, but also enable control of the amount of or onset of the ink return to ink receiver.  As such, the designed<br>
i<br><br>
valves are to assist in minimizing the risk of ink bursting free of the apparatus while controlling the amount of wasted ink from the filling process.<br>
A T-joint within the conduiting of the flow system allows the strildng of a balance between the required degree of pressure and the ink flow rate. As a result, ink flow is genfler and the resultant print quality of The refilled printer cartridge will be better.<br>
The flow system also includes a damper or filter which locates in between the pump ouflet and inlet to the printer cartridge. The damper is capable of performing a double filtering fimction (so it helps to filter off and prevent unwanted particles from entering the printer cartridge). Such a filtering/damping effect leads to noise reduction as well as a reduction of clogging the printer cartridge's printing nozzle. The damper is also able to absorb (ie; damp) pulses and reduces bubbles. In this connection, it helps smoothing the ink flow prior to the ink filling into the printer cartridge.<br>
The damper Ihus has significantly improved the filling ability of the system and the quality of ink.<br>
The present invention is designed in such a manner that various sensors and light indicators are connected to a central control device (electronic controller), so to ensure a close monitoring as well as controlling of the refill process while it is taking place. The electronic controller preferably provides an automatic processing means whereby users will have a simple operation by just pressing one button to start and stop the refill process once the ink cartridge is fiilly filled.<br>
The apparatus can either run by battery power or via appropriate DC voltage adaptor as individual user's needs.<br>
Figure 1 is a flow diagram showing the filling of a depleted printer cartridge 10 by transferring ink from the ink replenishment cartridge 20 by means of tubes 90 to 96 using pump 30 driven by a motor 31. The overall filling process is monitored and controlled by the electronic controller 40.<br>
The printer cartridge 10, as well as the ink replenishment cartridge 20 are simply dropped into a holder tray. Upon closing of the holder tray, the printer cartridge 10 is in contact with a sealing rubber with which it seals. The contact and sealing completes communication between the printer cartridge and filling cfrcuit formed by tubes 90 to 96 and pump 30.<br>
The circuit is controlled by electronic controller 40 which contams sensors SI, S2, S3 and LED light indicators LI, L2, L3. On proper closing of the holder tray, the printer cartridge 10 activates sensor switch S3 indicating the presence of printer cartridge in the system.<br>
The ink replenishment cartridge 20 is in connection with the filling circuit via two metal needles or cannula that penetrate through a rubber seal (not shown) in the<br>
7<br><br>
slid back to the closed position. In the door fully closed position, the printer cartridge activates sensor S3 and the ink replenishment cartridge activates sensor S2. Control electronic 40 continuously monitors the system and senses the presence of both print cartridge and ink tank and to indicate that status and that the door is closed properly, it changes the LED LI to display green color light to signify that the system is now ready for the filling process.<br>
User presses start button switch Bl to now activate the filling process. Control electronics 40 now changes the LED LI to display a blinking green light indicating that the device is now in the filling process. The process starts with a reverse pump direction to withdraw air in the printer cartridge and any possible waste ink left in the printer cartridge (This is subsequently call as &amp;e vacuum process). It also helps clear minor nozzle clog that may be caused by the printer cartridge having been left for a period of time before refilling. The initial vacuum process stops after a pre¬determined time is up.<br>
The system process now activates the actual ink filling process that has the pump 30 rotating in a forward direction that will draw ink from the ink chamber 21 in the ink replenishment cartridge 20 and move it in the print cartridge 10 dnection as shown in Figure 3. The first filling cycle is to run to a pro-determined time to fill up ink in Ihe tubes 90 to 96. The control electronic 40 will not check for ink supply status now as die tubes are all empty. At die end of the first filling cycle, some of the air in the empty tubes has been forced mto the printer cartridge 10. Therefore, a vacuum cycle is activated for a short period to withdraw the air fiiDm tiie printer cartridge 10.<br>
The ink filling process starts again to fill ink into the printer cartridge 10. Control electronics 40 now monitors the ink supply channel to ensure that there is an ink supply to be filled in the printer cartridge 10. The ink filling process is carried out for a period of time. While ink is fUlmg mto the printer cartridge, there might be some air being introduced into the printer cartridge 10 as well. Hence, there could be a pressure build up inside the print cartridge and a slowing down of tiie fillmg rate. At this stage, the control electronic stops the pump for a very short while and activates the vacuum process. This is achieved by reversing ihe pump to backward direction as shown in Figure 4. The vacuum process reduces pressure inside the printer cartridge 10 and withdraws air fi:om the printer cartridge 10 as well. The air withdrawn from the printer cariridge 10 is in tiny bubble forms and may otherwise contaminate ink m the supply chaimel. It is to be discharged out of the tubing system into the ink receiver of receptacle chamber 22 m the ink replenishment cartridge.<br>
The ink discharge channel is installed with another pressure check valve 50. The pressure check valve 50 enables bubbled ink {subsequently called waste ink) to<br>
1<br><br>
be pressurized and compressed before discharging. This ensures that air bubbles are collected before the pressure check valve 50 and discharge first when tiie pressure check valve 50 is opened. The arrangement minimizes tiie amount of ink discharged out of the system and maximizes uik filled mto the printer cartridge 10.<br>
The ink filling and vacuum cycle is repeated continuously while the control electronic 40 continues to monitor various sensors and switches status.<br>
The added advantage of the device is the ability to regulate pressure within the filling system, Sometimes, the pressure in the system can be very high especially when the filling rate of ink into the printer cartridge 10 is slower tb^n the ink supply rate fi'om the pump 30; One of the reasons is a non-perfect nozzle 60 condition of the printer head. Another reason may include air trapped in the nozzle 60 area. In general, all tubes joint and, in particularly the nozzle seal area a has limited pressure limit that it can withstand before mk can leak or burst out. If such a case happens, not only flie filling process has failed, but the entire device is fouled. Accordingly a pressure check valve 51 is installed to regulate internal pressure as shown in Figure 5. The pressure check valve 51 is pre-set to a pressure Y in between pressure X required to fill the printer cartridge and fiie hmit pressure Z that the system can withstand without ink leak or burst such that X 
Another design aspect applicable to pressure control is the use of a T-joint 81 at the cartridge seal area. The T-joint allows ink to flow straight in the pressure regulating circuit through pressure check valve 51. As well understood, tiie print nozzle of printer cartridge 10 is very tiny. Therefore, ink flow rate is substantially low, but yet sufficient pressure is requhed allowing ink to flow through the tiny nozzle 60. As such, it very difficult to strike a perfect balance of high pressure and low flow rate. The T-joint allows ink pressure to stay high enou^ that enables ink to flow through the printer nozzle 60. At the same time it allows only a small amount of mk flow through the print nozzle 60 and excess ink is re-circulated in the pressure regulating circuit. This results m gentle flow of ink on refilling of the printer cartridge 10, which ensures a best flU result and print quality after refill.<br>
Another added advantage of this invention is the introduction of a damper 80 m between the pmnp outlet and the inlet to the printer cartridge 10. The damper 80 is in feet a component such as fluid filter as commonly used in a chemical laboratory. It doubles as a filter to filter off foreign, imwanted big size particles (that<br>
10<br><br>
may clog the printer cartridge's printing nozzle should they enter the printer cartridge 10). The main effect of tiie damper is analogous to a capacitor in an electronic circuit. It reduces noise and smooths ink flow into tiie printer cartridge 10. As commonly understood, ink flow at the pump outlet (being pump out by the pump) has gamed high pressure. The presstire increase is pulsile as a consequence of the pump 30. The high pressure increases flow rate significantly. Although this high pressure is desired to transport the mk and force it to fill mto printer cartridge 10, it also introduces air bubbles as ink is bemg forced out of the pump like a jet stream. The damper 80 absorbs the pulses and reduces bubbles and thus smooths the ink flow before it is filled into the printer cartridge 10. It therefore, significantly unproves both the ink quality and fill ability of Ihe system.<br>
When &amp;e fillmg is completed successMly (i.e. all ink from the ink chamber 21 in the ink replenishment cartridge 20 has been fully consumed) sensor SI detects that ink is absent in the supply channel. The control electronic picks up the signal and stops the ink filling process immediately. It then activates the final vacuum process for a pre-determined period of time. The final vacuum process reduces internal pressure in the printer cartridge 10 and removes an- at ttie nozzle area 60. The final vacuum process also serves as a priming process to ensure that air bubbles are removed from nozzle 60 and fills all nozzles with ink so that it will be ready for printing-immediately. The reduced pressure in the mtemal chamber of the printer cartridge also ensures no leaking of ink when it is removed from the device.<br>
With the filling process successfully completed, the control electronics change the LED LI to display orange color light indicating that the filling has been completed successfully. The start button switch Bl will he disabled thus the system will not start another filling cycle. At this stage, the door can be opened and both the printer cartridge 10 and ink replenishment cartridge 20 can be taken out from die device. The printer cartridge 10 is ready to the used again and the empty mk tank 20 can be disposed off.<br>
As a safety measure, m case the mk m the ink chamber 21 m the mk replenishment cartridge 20 is not consumed completely in the pre-determined period of time (e.g. 5 minutes), such as when the user drops in a half used printer cartridge (i.e. there is still plenty of unused ink in the printer cartridge), the conttol electronics will stop the filling process and perform Ihe final vacuum process. At the end of the process, the control electronic change the LED L3 to display red blinkmg light indicating that the filling has stop after a pre-determined period of time.<br>
In ±e event there is something wrong to the filling process, floe user can press and hold down the start button switch BI continuously for the pre-determmed time frame (e.g. 2 seconds), the system will stop operation completely and the control<br>
/(<br><br>
electronic will change both the LED LI and LED L3 to be bimking in red color light indicating that the system has been stopped in an emergency.<br>
In case the printer cartridge leaks after removing from the device or during printing, user can put the printer cartridge back into die device together with an ink receiver, close the door so that the system is ready with LED LI displaying green Ught, user can press and hold down the start button switch BI continuously for a pre-determined period of time (e.g. 5 seconds). The system will be activated to start the final vacuum process only. At the end of the vacuum process, the system displays LED LI in orange light indicating that the printer cartridge can be removed from the device and be used for printing again.<br>
In the event that the device is running with battery power, the control electronics checks for the power level and ensures it is sufficient to complete the entire filling cycle. If the power level is low to the extent that it is unable to complete one filling cycle, the control electronic will change LED L2 to display a flashmg red light mdicating tiiat the battery power is low that user need to change battery before using it again.<br>
The device as showed in Figure 6 to Figure 12 show the concrete realization of the concepts as shown in Figure 2 to Figure 5.<br>
The cumulative device is provided with a five-part housing, which is comprisfed-of lower base housing 110, top cover housing i20,-4eft'-eover housing 130, right cover housing 131 and back panel housing 132. Major intemal components of the device are constructed with five main parts, viz. a holder tray 140 with door cover 150, main frame 160, fi^me linkage 161 and swivel needle holder 170.<br>
In the top cover housuig 120, the printed circuit board PCB 42 is mounted. On the PCB, there exists a sensor holder component (fuse holder like component) that allows the ink supply channel to be fixed on the PCB upon assembly. The ink supply passes through two metal tubes separated apart at a short distance. The ink, being electrically conductive, closes the electrical circuit between the two metal tubes when ink flow in the tubing system when filling, thus sending signal to the control electronic 40 indicating the presence of uik in the supply channel 92. On the other side of die PCB, diere exists start button swhch Bl that is close to start button 121 which is fixed onto start button spring holder 122 before attachmg onto top cover housing 120. LED LI is underneath the start button 121 and LED L2 and LED L3 is directly fix onto start button spring holder 122.<br>
On the back panel housing 132, the main power switch 41 and DC power jack 133 is attached.<br>
On the lower base housing 110, battery coimectors 113 are installed and battery compartment door 111 is attached at the bottom side. On the iimer side of<br>
X<br><br>
the lower base housing 110, a sensor PCB 43 with sensors S2 and S3 on it, is attached. Then the main Same 160 is securely mounted onto the lower base housing 110. Upon assembly of the main frame 160, the frame linkage 161 are assembled with attaching cartridge seal holder 162 and cartridge nozzle rubber seal 163 and moimt them securely onto the main frurae 160 with all required springs 164 and 165 in their position. Then the swivel needle holder 170 is also assembled onto the main frame 160. Finally, the motor 31 and pump 30 are also attached securely onto flie main frame 160.<br>
With all the components on the main frame 160 assembled, tubing 90 to 96 and connectors and check valves tiiat link tubes 90 to 96 togetiier are fitted to complete the tubing circuitry. Then electrical wires are connected to various electrical components such as the motor 31, main power switch 41, DC jack 133 and sensor PCB 43 leaving the other end of the main wire connector to be connected to the main PCB 42.<br>
The left cover housing 130 and right cover housing 131 can now be fixed together followed by fixing the back panel housmg 132. Finally, the ink supply channel with metal tubmg portion is fixed in place onto PCB 42 and the main wire connector is also attached to the main PCB 42. The top cover housing 120 is now attached to complete the device assembly.<br>
The door-cover-150 is pre-assembled onto the holder ti-ay 140sepMately. The assembled holder tray 140 can now be slid into the device and door cover 150 closed and is clicked securely onto the main device body.<br>
To begm operation, the closed cover 150 is opened and the holder tray 140 is pulled out of the device. In a fiiU open position, the seating position of the printer cartridge 10 and the ink replenishment cartridge 20 is fiiUy exposed to the user. Therefore, user can simply drop the printer cartridge 10 to be filled and an ink replenishment cartridge 20 onto their seating position respectively. Undemeath the holder tray, there exists support legs 142 to prevent topple over of the device due to weight of the printer cartridge 10 and ink tank 20 or pressure applied by the user when putting the printer cartridge 10 and ink replenishment cartridge 20 onto their seating position.<br>
The holder tray 140 is then slid into the device by closing the door cover 150 until it clicks securely onto the main device. While shding in the holder tray, the printer cartridge 10 come into contact with the cartridge nozzle rubber seal 163. This contact is accomplished by a cam mechanism activated by the protruding cam 143 on the holder tray 140 onto Hie cam surface 165 on the frame hnkage 160 to bring down the cartridge seal holder 162. Before printer cartridge 10 reaches the cartridge nozzle rubber seal 163 (i.e. before the cam surfaces meet), the cartridge nozzle rubber seal 163 is above the printer cartridge nozzle surface 60, lifted and<br>
fS<br><br>
maintained in position by spring 165, with sufficient clearance. This ensures the sensitive printer cartridge nozzle 60 is not damaged by the mechanical contact and scratches on mechanical movement. When the cam surfaces start to meet, the printer cartridge 10 is stopped by a stopper 166 on the main ftame 160 with the holder tray 140 continuing to slide in. The cam surfaces meet and the fiame linkage 161 starts to move down due to the cam mechanism. It brings down the cartridge nozzle rubber seal 163 to be in contact with the printer cartridge surface 60 and compresses springs 164. On reaching a fiilly closed position, die cartridge is securely positioned by the spring 144 on holder tray 140 and the four springs 164 are being compressed and exert sufficient force that creates a sealing contact that can withstand pre-determined amount of pressure to prevent ink leakage during filling process.<br>
While the holder tray is sliding in, the ink replenishment cartridge 20 is also coming into contact witii the needle 171 and 172 held on the swivel needle holder 170. Continuous sliding of die holder tray 140 causes the needles 171 and 172 penetrate through the rubber seal 23 and 24 that connect into the receptacle chamber 22 and ink chamber 21 respectively, thus, completing the fluid communication circuit. The needles 171 and 172 are deep mside the device with safety taken into consideration during designing of die device. It is not easily reachable and thus user is unlikely to be hurt by the needles. The swivel needle holder 170 is spring loaded with a built in spring 173 that maintains it in an upright position that ensures that the end tip of the needles 171 and 172 meet the center of the rubber seals 23 and 24 in ink replenishment cartridge 20 before penetrating. When penetrating, the ink replenishment cartridge 20 is still moving forward due to the continuous sUding of the holder tray 140. This causes strain on the needle 171 and 172 and rubber seal 23 and 24 as the angle has been changed in the movement. The swivel needle holder 170 is therefore designed to allow some degree of rotating movement to correct die angle of the needle during penetrating into the rubber seal 23 and 24 and thus eliminate strain that may cause mbber to be tom and its lose sealing effect on the needle cannula thereby breaking the fluid ti^tness of the connection in the system.<br>
On proper closing of the door 150 i.e. the holder has fully slid in, die printer cartridge 10 is pressing on sensor switch S3 and the ink tank 20 is pressing on sensor switch S2. At this stage, if power supply is on, the LED LI will light as a green color indicating the filling process can be started.<br>
LED LI lighting in an orange color indicates the filling process is completed successfully, whereupon the door 150 is opened and the holder tray 140 is slid out. The slidmg out causes the cam surfaces to disengage and open clearance between cartridge nozzle surface 11 and nozzle rubber seal 163. Again, the clearance prevents the cartridge nozzle being damaged by mechanical movement. At the same<br>
1^<br><br>
time, the needless 171 and 172 disengage from the rubber seal 23 and 24 of the ink replenishment cartridge 20. The rubber is atrtomaticaUy self seals back to close holes of penetration and prevent waste ink from leaking out of die ink replenishment cartridge 20.<br>
Therefore, upon the door 150 being fiilly opened, the ink replenishment cartridge 20 can be dispose off cleanly and the printer cartridge 10 is ready for printing. The device is also ready for the next filling process immediately or any time later on.<br>
