SUPERABSORBENTS, NANOFIBER NONWOVENS FINISHED THEREWITH<br>
AND USE THEREOF<br>
The invention relates to a superabsorbent powder consisting of polymer<br>
particles which have a core swelling in the presence of water and a superficially<br>
postcured shell, its use for the finishing of textile webs made of super-fine fibers<br>
or super-fine filaments having a diameter of less than 10 urn, as well as to the<br>
use of a nanofiber nonwoven, finished with the superabsorbent for the absorption<br>
and retention of hydrophilic fluids, for the absorption and/or release of one or<br>
more fluids or mixtures of fluids.<br>
„Superabsorbents" are to be understood as polymer materials which have the<br>
ability of absorbing water or other fluids up to a thousand times their mass,<br>
thereby swelling to form a gel. As the uptake and retention capability of the<br>
superabsorbents is subject to a rapid and strong limitation due to the „gel<br>
blocking" effect, the agglutinating of the superabsorbent particles which have<br>
started to swell or are fully swollen up, various methods of a superficially<br>
occurring postcure of the superabsorbent particles have already been suggested,<br>
resulting in a gradient of the cross-linking degree of the particles which increases<br>
inside out, i.e. a core having a lower cross-linking degree and a shell having a<br>
higher cross-linking degree. Modified superabsorbents of this kind and methods<br>
of their manufacture are known from Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial<br>
Chemistry, 6th Ed., Vol. 35, pp. 73 ff., 2003, just as their use for the finishing of<br>
sanitary products such as diapers and other incontinence products, sanitary<br>
napkins and wound dressings.<br>
According to studies, approximately 15 million in Western Europe and about<br>
the same number of people in the USA suffer from urinary incontinence. This<br>
disturbance of health can be found with women 10 times more frequently than<br>
with men. Approximately 25 % of the women at the age of 30 to 59 years are at<br>
least temporarily incontinent. Even 10 to 20% of the younger women at the age of<br>
about 20 years are affected, too. More than 5.2 billion pieces of incontinence<br>
products such as diapers for adults are used in Western Europe every year. In<br>
the USA the annual expenses for incontinence products are estimated at more<br><br>
than 16.4 billion US dollars, about 35 % of which accruing in nursing homes. This<br>
results in the big social and economic importance of the development of<br>
improved superabsorbents specifically adapted to textile webs, in most cases<br>
nonwovens, which are used for such incontinence products.<br>
Incontinence products primarily have the function to take up urine, firmly<br>
absorb and effectively bind it. At the same time, moisture is to be kept away from<br>
the skin and developing odors are to be suppressed. This is achieved by a multi-<br>
ply structure made up of a foil acting as a liquid barrier towards outside, various<br>
nonwoven webs for controlling the fluid distribution, and superabsorbents for a<br>
reliable fluid absorption.<br>
Apart from this technical functionality, a certain wearing comfort, good fit,<br>
discretion (channels of distribution, volume, crackling/rustling) and a hygienic<br>
manageability are desired.<br>
Already today, incontinence products make it possible for less affected<br>
persons to live a mostly normal everyday life. Nevertheless, the mobility is limited<br>
and the abidance is confined to an environment with sanitary infrastructure, which<br>
in the end has an influence on the social and work-related situation, as well.<br>
In the case of a more pronounced incontinence these impairments will<br>
especially become evident, although it is possible to master technical problems<br>
with the materials available today and with constructions of incontinence<br>
products, but to the account of the wearing comfort, fit, discretion and handling.<br>
As incontinence is a social taboo subject, the social/psychological component<br>
of this disturbance of health has a special importance in particular for younger<br>
women and may lead right up to isolation, loneliness and loss of self-confidence<br>
and autonomy.<br>
Materials of a new type for the use in novel incontinence products can<br>
produce relief here, which especially account for the need for discretion by a<br>
small volume, low thickness, reduced noise and a high wearing comfort.<br>
From U.S. Patent 5,629,377 it is already known to use superabsorbent<br>
powders made of superficially postcured polymer particles for the finishing of<br>
diapers and other incontinence products. It has turned out, however, that<br><br>
commercially available superabsorbent powders in combination with super-fine<br>
fiber nonwovens, which are preferred because of a preferably dry skin surface of<br>
the user of these products, are still not optimal. It was not possible to process<br>
them in a problem-free manner, they were not properly integrated in the<br>
nonwoven structure and oozed out of the nonwoven structure upon wetting.<br>
„Nanofiber nonwovens" are supposed to be nonwovens made of textile fibers<br>
having a diameter of less than 10 urn, preferably less than 1 urn. Nanofiber<br>
nonwovens and methods for their manufacturing are known, for instance, from<br>
the U.S. Patent 4,043,331 and the International Patent Application WO 01/27365.<br>
The nanofiber nonwovens known from prior art are not finished with<br>
superabsorbents, but for their part were used for the finishing of sanitary products<br>
and wound dressings.<br>
The invention is based on the object to provide a superabsorbent powder<br>
which is especially suitable for combining it with super-fine fiber nonwovens,<br>
while the use of such powder in the finishing of textile webs such as sanitary<br>
products results in more economical production options, as well as to provide<br>
application ways for the super-fine fiber nonwovens finished with the<br>
superabsorbent for the absorption and retention of hydrophilic fluids, in which the<br>
advantageous properties of the nanofiber nonwovens finished in this way<br>
manifest particularly clearly in economical, ecological or technical terms.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention with a superabsorbent<br>
powder of the type initially mentioned in that the powder is a screening fraction of<br>
such polymer particles which have not been crushed after the superficial postcure<br>
of their shell.<br>
It has turned out surprisingly that the customary superabsorbent powders<br>
failed even if they had in principle an optimum grain size and a suitable grain size<br>
distribution for a particular super-fine fiber nonwoven, because they have been<br>
crushed several times in the course of their manufacture, even after their<br>
postcure, whereby the core/shell structure of the particles was damaged and the<br>
gel blocking effect began anew. This is the reason why optimum water absorption<br>
and water retention values could not be achieved with super-fine fiber<br>
nonwovens, although acceptable results could be achieved with ..normal" or<br>
coarser fiber nonwovens with the same customary superabsorbent powders.<br><br>
Only when carefully screened, uncrushed particles as superabsorbent powders<br>
were selected and used in combination with super-fine fiber nonwovens, the<br>
desired optimum water absorption and water retention values appeared. This not<br>
only applies to the absorption and retention of water, but also to the absorption<br>
and retention of other hydrophilic fluids.<br>
If the employed screening fraction shows a grain size distribution of d50 = 55<br>
to 100 µm and d100 = 100 to 150 µm, the best results are achieved according to<br>
the invention in combination with nanofiber nonwovens. The specification „d50 =<br>
55 µm" means that 50 % by weight of the particles have a grain size of up to<br>
55 µm, actually 55 µm or less, and „d100 = 100µm" means that 100 % by weight<br>
of the particles have a grain size of up to 100 µm, i.e. no particle is larger than<br>
100 µm.<br>
It is preferred that the polymer, of which the superabsorbent particles are<br>
consisting, is a (meth)acrylate or a (meth)acryl copolymer; it is particularly<br>
preferred that the polymer is sodium polyacrylate.<br>
According to the invention, the superabsorbent powder of the selected<br>
screening fraction is used for the finishing of textile webs made of super-fine<br>
fibers or super-fine filaments having a diameter of less than 10 µm. The fibers or<br>
filaments preferably have a diameter of less than 1 µm. Such super-fine fibers<br>
are referred to as microfibers or nanofibers.<br>
The use of the superabsorbent powders for the finishing of nanofiber<br>
nonwovens, in particular of those made of electrostatically spun nanofibers, has<br>
turned out to be particularly advantageous, which will be explained in detail<br>
below.<br>
The fibers or filaments preferably consist of a thermoplastic and hydrophilic or<br>
hydrophilized polymer which is melt-spinnable with polyurethane being<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
The superabsorbent powder according to the invention is preferably used for<br>
the finishing of sanitary products which are made of textile webs. It is particularly<br>
preferred that, according to the invention, diapers and other incontinence<br>
products, sanitary napkins and wound dressings are finished so as to be fluid<br>
absorbing.<br><br>
Thus, a preferred result of the use according to the invention is an elastic,<br>
superabsorbent nonwoven of nanofibers for the use in novel sanitary articles, in<br>
particular in incontinence products with improved wearing comfort, safe odor<br>
binding and enhanced discretion. The sanitary article consists of a nonwoven<br>
fabric of thermoplastic polyurethane, in which the superabsorbent powder made<br>
of polyacrylate having a specific grain size distribution and a specific postcure<br>
treatment is mechanically integrated. The proportion of specific superabsorbent<br>
may amount up to 85 % by weight of the total weight of the finished textile piece.<br>
The nanofiber nonwoven finished with the superabsorbent according to the<br>
invention for the absorption and retention of hydrophilic fluids is preferably used<br>
for the absorption and/or sustained release of at least one of the following fluids:<br>
body fluids, sweat of humans and animals, water, including cooling water,<br>
condensation water and water vapor, chemicals, including agrochemicals and<br>
pesticides, pharmaceuticals, biocides, germicides and fungicides, agents for use<br>
in diagnostics, fire protection and fire extinguishing agents, cleaning agents,<br>
hydraulic fluids, heating and cooling fluids, sewage, including radioactively<br>
contaminated fluids, perfumes.<br>
For the uptake and/or sustained release of body fluids the nanofiber<br>
nonwoven according to the invention is preferably used as an incontinence<br>
article, diaper, sanitary napkin, wound dressing, cooling compress, sanitary<br>
tissue, cosmetic pad or bed inlay or as a part of the aforementioned goods.<br>
For the uptake and/or sustained release of sweat of human or animal origin,<br>
the nanofiber nonwoven according to the invention preferably is used as a sweat<br>
absorbing padding material for shoes, garments, headgears, headbands, gloves,<br>
upholstered furniture, vehicle seats, saddles, bed linen, bedspreads, horse<br>
blankets, sports goods or pieces of sports equipment.<br>
For the uptake and/or sustained release of water, including cooling water,<br>
condensation water and water vapor, the nanofiber nonwoven according to the<br>
invention preferably is used as a wipe, floor cloth, casualty protection mat,<br>
camping mat, tarpaulin, wet cloth, drying cloth, polishing cloth, cleaning cloth or<br>
washleather or as a part of the aforementioned goods.<br><br>
In the field of construction the nanofiber nonwoven according to the invention<br>
is used for the uptake and/or sustained release of water, including cooling water,<br>
condensation water and water vapor, preferably as a floor covering or wall<br>
covering, parquet underlay sheeting, roof underlay sheeting, fire protection mat,<br>
leakage protection mat, mat for the lining of damp rooms, tents, vehicles, tanks or<br>
containers or as a part of the aforementioned goods.<br>
A further preferred use of the nanofiber nonwoven according to the invention<br>
is possible as a filter material, packaging material, sheathing, insulating material<br>
or sealing material or as a part of the aforementioned goods. Examples of<br>
preferred uses are the packaging of dangerous goods, the sheathing of tubes<br>
and conduits, of pipelines, of electric cables, including communication cables and<br>
power supply cables, and of all objects in which fluids of the aforementioned type<br>
are stored or transported, develop in the form of condensation water and water<br>
vapor, or may escape in consequence of leakages or accidents.<br>
For the uptake and/or sustained release of chemicals, including<br>
agrochemicals and pesticides, the nanofiber nonwoven according to the invention<br>
preferably is used as a geo web, drainage mat, agro web or as a nonwoven for<br>
the sustained release of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fertilizers or pesticides. In<br>
this field of application, nonwovens may be involved which are spread out across<br>
large areas in greenhouses or across the soil over fields, acres and plantations,<br>
in order to either imbibe the cited agents or release them with some delay. An<br>
important application field for the nanofiber nonwovens according to the invention<br>
are ecological disasters in which large amounts of environmentally detrimental<br>
fluids have escaped, for instance in consequence of traffic accidents.<br>
In the application possibilities, proposed according to the invention, of the<br>
nanofiber nonwovens finished with the superabsorbent, the high water and fluid<br>
retention capability and the high speed of the water and fluid uptake with a<br>
concurrent, particularly slow and retarded (re-)release of the absorbed fluid<br>
amounts manifest at advantage. Due to this, even larger amounts of spilled fluids<br>
can be taken up and eliminated in a very short time.<br>
On the other hand, the nonwovens can be preventively employed throughout<br>
those places where leakages are to be feared and where water, but also<br>
poisonous, corrosive, acidic, alkaline or environmentally hazardous fluids may<br><br>
escape from conduits, containers, packagings, tanks, vehicles, industrial plants<br>
etc, the emerging fluids will immediately be taken up by the nonwovens with<br>
which the conduits etc. have been sheathed or packed or lined, and are absorbed<br>
due to a wicking effect which begins very rapidly.<br>
The advantages of the invention will be explained in the following by example<br>
of sanitary products based on textile webs, but are not construed to be limiting:<br>
1. Improved Discretion<br>
The reason for the thickness and bulkiness of incontinence products is<br>
primarily due to the fact that superabsorbent powder (SAP) swells upon<br>
contacting water and the particles agglutinate, whereby further absorption of<br>
water is made more difficult or prevented (gel blocking). In order to avoid gel<br>
blocking, it was common practice hitherto to use SAP always in a mixture<br>
together with short cellulose fibers (pulp), which are supposed to keep the<br>
particles apart. In doing so, the proportion of SAP may amount to 50 % at the<br>
maximum. Pulp has a very low density, is therefore very bulky and considerably<br>
blows up the volume of the amount of SAP/pulp which is needed for the uptake of<br>
fluid.<br>
In order to avoid these disadvantages and to be able to do without pulp, while<br>
ensuring at the same time a large surface area as with SAP, there have been<br>
made various attempts to use the superabsorbent not in the form of a powder,<br>
but in another make-up, for instance as foam, fiber nonwoven or in the form of<br>
fibers and nonwovens coated with superabsorbents. These constructs, however,<br>
could not be used because of serious disadvantages such as a loss of strength<br>
after wetting, brittleness/fragility in the dry state or a marked anisotropy of the<br>
wetting behavior.<br>
The novel approach of the material according to the invention now is to<br>
incorporate the individual particles of the superabsorbent powder with a defined<br>
grain size distribution in an elastic nonwoven structure in such a manner that the<br>
particles are spatially separated from each other, that they are wetted all-over by<br>
contact with water and are able to freely swell in all three dimensions. Due to the<br>
elasticity of the nonwoven matrix gel blocking is being prevented, as the<br>
nonwoven matrix yields in view of the increasing space requirements during<br><br>
swelling of the superabsorbent, thereby the particles are being largely kept away<br>
from each other.<br>
2.	Improved Wearing Comfort<br>
Due to the elastic nonwoven structure with a high proportion of<br>
superabsorbents, it is possible to replace bulky SAP/pulp mixtures which are<br>
common at present and to avoid the disadvantages of customary incontinence<br>
articles. The thickness is reduced to 1/10. It is due to the smoothness, elasticity<br>
and the low thickness of the material according to the invention that the designer<br>
of incontinence articles has all options to unite a clothing-like wearing comfort<br>
with discretion and technical performance.<br>
3.	Simplified Manufacturing Process of the Sanitary Articles<br>
Further, a simplification of the diaper manufacturing process is achieved, by<br>
expensive conditioning plants for pulp and plants for mixing SAP with pulp<br>
arranged upstream of a diaper machine are replaced with a placement of the<br>
elastic, superabsorbent nonwovens in the form of webs, strips or coil goods. In<br>
addition, any diaper construction is simplified, because one can. do without<br>
construction elements such as tissue and corewrap. The diaper structure is<br>
reduced to e.g. an elastic, breathing membrane, onto which the object according<br>
to the invention (elastic and absorbing nonwoven) is applied during the<br>
manufacturing process, and the covering with distributing and/or coating<br>
nonwoven. It may happen already during the manufacturing process of the<br>
material according to the invention that it is applied onto a membrane or foil as a<br>
carrier material and covered in the subsequent process step with conventional<br>
nonwovens. In the so obtained composite, the membrane or foil correlates to a<br>
customary back sheet, the material according to the invention to a customary<br>
absorbent core and the coating nonwoven to the distribution layer or top web, or<br>
with both in case of a suitable construction.<br>
4.	Odor<br>
Any conventional approaches for the odor binding assume that volatile,<br>
mostly amine-type compounds as odor carriers are formed by the bacterial<br>
decomposition of urine components. According to this, one tries to put a stop to<br>
the propagation and activity of microorganisms by adjustment of the<br><br>
neutralization level of the superabsorbents, and the use of pH buffers or<br>
bacteriostatic agents. Here, the use of bacteriostatic agents or even bactericides<br>
is highly controversial because of the associated risks to produce allergies.<br>
Based on the fact that urinary odor substantially is the odor of gaseous<br>
ammonia which is formed by the enzymatic decomposition of urea, and that the<br>
active enzyme indeed is used by microorganisms for the metabolic digestion of<br>
urea, but the effectiveness and the occurrence of the enzyme is not bound to<br>
living cells, the novel approach for the solution of this problem with customary<br>
incontinence articles is not to combat microorganisms, but to block the<br>
effectiveness of ureolytic enzymes by specific enzyme blockers.<br>
Substituting harmless enzyme blockers for customary allergy-producing<br>
cytotoxins such as bactericides does not limit technologies for binding odor to<br>
patients or cases where a corresponding balance of benefit/risk is available, but<br>
allows a broad application to the improvement of the quality of life of incontinent<br>
people.<br>
The enzyme blockers may be added to the spinning mass during the<br>
manufacture of the elastic nonwoven and be active at the surface of the fibers<br>
after diffusion, or they may be subsequently applied on the fiber surface in the<br>
form of an impregnation.<br>
5. Textile Webs<br>
From literature, for instance from U.S. Patent 4,043,331 it is known that<br>
polymers from solution can be processed to nonwovens of endless filaments by<br>
means of the electrospinning technology. Electrospinning is still a not very<br>
widespread, predominantly experimental technology for the production of<br>
nonwoven webs. Like no other nonwoven laying technology, however, it offers<br>
the possibility to produce endless filaments from different polymers, also<br>
elastomers, which have diameters in the nanometer range, and to lay down in the<br>
form of a kind of spun nonwoven and to mechanically incorporate particles such<br>
as grains or microcapsules (filled with active agents, aromatic substances et al.,<br>
activatable by water or temperature) in the nonwoven structure during the<br>
spinning process. In addition, there is the possibility to add active agents such as<br>
enzymes, enzyme blockers, vitamins, detergents, wetting agents et al. to the<br><br>
spinning solution, which due to diffusion to the surface of the spun fibers can<br>
develop their activity there.<br>
L. M. Hansen et. al. write in Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 95, pp.<br>
427-434 (2005) about a nonwoven made of thermoplastic polyurethane and<br>
produced by an electrospinning method, which is filled with a superabsorbent in<br>
the form of modified starch from the company Grain Processing Corp.,<br>
Muscatine, IA, with the trade name „Waterlock". This material already has<br>
interesting properties which, however, do not fulfill the requirements in terms of<br>
specific absorption, speed of the fluid uptake and the maximum filling level with<br>
absorber as a substitute for an absorbent core in sanitary articles.<br>
In expectation to be able to fulfill the requirements when the modified starch<br>
(Waterlock) of the existent material is replaced with polyacrylates, as they are<br>
commonly used as superabsorbents in sanitary articles, commercial<br>
superabsorbent powder was crushed down to a grain size which appeared to be<br>
needed for the incorporation in said nanofiber nonwoven; with this material, a<br>
nano-nonwoven was produced which contained a superabsorbent. As expected,<br>
an absorption behavior was observed which was improved compared to<br>
nonwovens filled with modified starch (Waterlock), but filling levels of more than<br>
50% could not render a measurable improvement of the specific absorption due<br>
to gel blocking.<br>
Surprisingly it was found that superabsorbent particles of sodium polyacrylate<br>
with suitable grain size, which were not manufactured by crushing customary<br>
superabsorbent powders, but obtained as a screening fraction of superficially<br>
postcured particles, give the overall construct of preferably polyurethane<br>
nonwoven and superabsorbent distinctly superior properties, despite a basically<br>
sustained absorption in comparison with customary superabsorbent powder. Only<br>
the use of superficially postcured superabsorbent powder of polyacrylate or<br>
another suitable copolymer with intact core/shell structure and a suitable grain<br>
size distribution allows a rapid uptake and distribution of the fluid and a high<br>
specific absorption concomitantly with a high filling level of up to approx. 85% of<br>
the superabsorbent nonwovens consisting of thermoplastic polyurethane and<br>
superabsorbent powder with diameters of the individual filaments in the<br>
nanometer to micrometer range.<br><br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below according to examples:<br>
Test Methods<br>
A.	Teabag Absorption Test (Tb)<br>
The „teabag" absorption test gives information about the resistance-less fluid<br>
absorption. A defined amount of a SAP sample is filled in a commercial teabag;<br>
the teabag is immersed for 30 minutes in excessive 0,9 % solution of sodium<br>
chloride and is taken out; after this the bag is left for 10 minutes in order to drip<br>
off.<br>
The Tb value in [g/g] is the ratio between the absorbed amount of water and<br>
the original amount of SAP.<br>
B.	Water Retention Test<br>
The test shows the water retention of the swollen SAP sample. The swollen<br>
teabag from the Tb test is put into a centrifuge and is centrifuged for 3 minutes<br>
with an acceleration of 250 g.<br>
The CRC value in [g/g] is the ratio between the retained amount of water and<br>
the original amount of SAP.<br>
C.	Vertical Wicking Effect<br>
The test gives information on the speed and the preferential direction of the<br>
spreading of the water absorption. An adhesive tape of the size of 10x1 cm with<br>
an SAP sample sticking thereon is marked at equal distances of 1 cm and<br>
perpendicularly immersed in a 0,9 % solution of NaCI as far as to the first 1 cm<br>
mark; the fluid extension is compensated by adjusting the strip with respect to the<br>
mark. The time is measured at which the run of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm is reached by<br>
the upward movement of the solution on the tape.<br>
Results<br>
Nonwovens of thermoplastic polyurethane and various absorbing materials<br>
with different charge amounts were manufactured according to the<br>
electrospinning method on a laboratory spinning facility or pilot spinning facility<br>
and subjected to the above described tests.<br><br>
In the experiments 3, 4, 6 and 7 according to the invention, superficially cross-<br>
linked sodium polyacrylate powder with a core/shell structure with a grain size<br>
distribution of the screening fraction of d50 approx. 100µ and d100 approx. 150µ,<br>
Tb approx. 38 g/g and CRC approx. 22 g/g was used as superabsorbent (SAP).<br>
Comparison experiment 5 was carried out with mechanically crushed (and<br>
therefore not according to the invention) and subsequently screened<br>
superabsorbent (SAP) with a grain size distribution of the screening fraction of<br>
d50 approx. 55µ and d100 of 100µ, Tb approx. 38 g/g, CRC approx. 22 g/g.<br>
Commercially available SAP, in grain size fractions as they are usual today in<br>
customary sanitary articles, turned out to be too coarse. It was not possible to<br>
process them in a trouble-free manner, they were not perfectly integrated in the<br>
nonwoven structure and oozed out of the nonwoven structure upon wetting. This<br>
is why first pilot experiments with commercial SAP types were ceased already.<br>
The results of the experiments are summarized in Table 1.<br>
It turned out that by the use of superficially cross-linked sodium polyacrylate<br>
powder with a core/shell structure with filling levels of about 50% and a grain size<br>
of d50 = 100µ, d100 = 150µ the speed of the water uptake could be lowered from<br>
450 sec. to 80 sec. and the water uptake could be augmented from 29 g/g to 40<br>
g/g and from 16 g/g to 22 g/g, respectively. With a filling level of 50 %, gel<br>
blocking can still not be ascertained, the Tb and CRC values rather achieving the<br>
theoretical values of pure SAP. A sample with the same composition which was<br>
produced on a larger pilot spinning facility showed comparably good results and<br>
confirms the reproducibility (experiment 6).<br>
It further turned out in experiment 5 that any damage of the postcured shell of<br>
the SAP particles by mechanical crushing and a concomitant increase of the<br>
proportion of smaller grain sizes in the screening fraction of the SAP has a<br>
detrimental effect on the speed of the fluid uptake and fluid distribution in the<br>
nonwoven.<br>
The experiments also demonstrated that only the combination of an elastic<br>
nonwoven structure with superficially postcured SAP with intact core/shell<br>
structure and suitable grain size results in the specifically desired markedness of<br>
the essential quality features such as speed of the fluid uptake and fluid<br><br>
distribution and absorption capability (Tb, CRC). It was surprisingly found that it is<br>
not an especially fine powder which shows the best effect, as was expected<br>
because of the fine nonwoven structure, but that an optimum of the particle size<br>
exists, which is distinctly coarser than the dimensions of the nonwoven<br>
structures.<br><br><br>
