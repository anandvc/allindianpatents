By this interactive function using the television as the medium, for example, response contents to the main broadcast (on-screen program) such as quiz and interview can be automatically transmitted by simple manipulation of the television remote controller, so that the viewer can participate in the main broadcasting program easily.<br>
FIG. 27 is a block diagram showing the constitution of the parts in the interactive television system of a type of broadcasting programs participated by viewers of the televisions according to this embodiment, and same parts as in FIG. 25 are identified with same reference numerals, and their explanation is omitted.<br>
Herein, the modem 34 is used for connecting the multimedia teletext receiver ,33 to the public telephone line, and through this modem 34, the data handled in the multimedia teletext receiver 33 can be transmitted by automatically dialing to the line connection<br>
destination given by the interactive teletext decoder of the receiver 33 (built in the reception script), for example, to the telephone reception service 4 having the accumulate processing function.  That is, by specific key input operation of the television remote controller 308, the information registered in the registration setting unit [PS] of machine control and individual identification information of the ROM mentioned below can be transmitted through the modem 34 by automatically dialing to the line connection destination or the telephone reception service 4 given from the interactive teletext decoder (built in the reception script).<br>
The internal structure of the multimedia teletext receiver 33 in this third embodiment is also similar to that in the first embodiment, and detailed description is omitted (see FIGS. 4 and 5).<br>
The transmission timing of the control data in the third embodiment (script and screen control , information) is also same as in the first embodiment, and detailed description is omitted (see FIGS. 6A and 6B).<br>
An example of operation of the third embodiment is described below.<br>
From the transmission antenna 2 of the broadcasting station 1, in the transmission format as shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, the script and the television<br>
wave for teletext (coded transmission type teletext) incorporating transfer destination information (for example, telephone number) in the script are transmitted in the VBI (step S21 in FIG. 26).<br>
Herein, in the vertical blanking interval (VBI) included in the video signal of main broadcast, the script for presenting plural types of additional information independent of the main broadcast (including the script main body (program) describing the processing procedure, header, form, and resource), and the telephone number incorporated in the script are transmitted.<br>
In this example, a quiz program participated by viewers is transmitted.<br>
The interactive television receiver (TV) 3 receives the television wave (broadcast wave) carrying the quiz program participated by viewers of the televisions, and stores (buffers) the reception script included in the broadcast wave.  That is, the multimedia teletext receiver 33 provided in the interactive television receiver (TV) 3 discriminates and takes in the VBI data from the received broadcast wave, and separates into the data of ordinary teletext program and data of interactive teletext program (herein, the data of plural types of additional information independent of main broadcast), and generates display data of ordinary teletext program and<br>
display data of plural types of additional information independent of the main broadcast, and stores (buffers) them in the RAM 305 (step S22 in FIG. 26).<br>
Herein, when the viewer manipulates the mode selection key (i key) of the television remote controller 308 and makes the interactive mode valid, the "i" mark appears in the upper left corner of the display unit (CRT) 32, telling that the interactive mode is valid (step S23 in FIG. 26).<br>
Furthermore, along with the manipulation of the mode selection key (i key), by the execution of the script process by the interactive teletext decoder realized by execution of the process of script process module [SCR] in the ROM 302 by the CPU 301, for example, a response input screen having plural selectors by participation of viewers in the quiz of the on-screen program is displayed (step S24 in FIG. 26).<br>
On this response input screen, as the viewer manipulates the direction command key of the television remote controller 308, the selected and designated selector is emphasized in display (for example, displayed by flickering), and the specified selector is clarified (steps S25, S26 in FIG. 26),<br>
Furthermore, on this response input screen, when the "decision" key is manipulated, the response content of the viewer is transmitted to the telephone reception<br>
service 4 (step S27 in FIG. 26).<br>
The process of transmitting to the telephone reception service 4 is transmitted by automatic dialing using the telephone number contained in the script, and at this time there are means for transmitting the response information automatically by using a common telephone number and means for transmitting automatically by varying the telephone number for every content of response (selector).  In the means for transmitting automatically by varying the telephone number for every content of response (selector), an individual telephone number is assigned for every response of each selector and preliminarily contained in the script, and when the CPU 301 of the interactive TV receiver 3 transmits to the telephone reception service 4, the telephone reception service 4 is called by the individual telephone number for the response content (selector).<br>
The telephone reception service 4 receives the response information from multiple interactive TV receivers 3 in the telephone line by the common telephone number or in the telephone line by the individual telephone number in every response content (selector), and transmits the accumulated information to the broadcasting station 1 (or network service 5) (steps S28, S29 in FIG. 26).<br>
In this way, by the interactive function through the medium of television, the response content to, for<br>
example, the main broadcast (on-screen program) such as quiz or interview, can be transmitted automatically by simple operation of the television remote controller, and the viewer can easily participate in the main broadcasting program.<br>
Thus, the third embodiment constructs an interactive television system of a type of broadcasting programs participated by viewers of the televisions for general household in an economically advantageous system configuration, by effectively utilizing the broadness in coverage and rapidity in reporting which are basic features of television broadcast, coding transmission system in vertical blanking interval (VBI) of television broadcast, and public telephone line as the existing infrastructure.<br>

By this interactive information exchange function using the television as the medium, the viewer can receive, by simple button operation of the television remote controller 308, desired information exchange service (for example, educational program presentation, catalog request guide, merchandise purchase guide, mailing guide, ticket reservation guide, local program presentation, mail exchange, home helper booking, use of registered main box (emergency report, etc.), hospital and other facility booking, and other information exchange service).<br>
Specifically, by providing the server 4 with, for example, a transaction processing function of executing<br>
*<br>
the reception process of commodity designated by the viewer, and acquiring the address information of the ordering viewer by retrieval of subscriber database (local database (L-DB) 42A and master database (M-DB) 43A) according to the identification information, varied transaction procedures such as catalog request, merchandise purpose, mailing, and ticket reservation can be executed easily by simple manipulation of the television remote controller.<br>
Also by providing the server 4 with the mail exchange and storing mechanism, mails can be exchanged between interactive TV receivers 3.<br>
Moreover, by utilizing the mail exchange function by the interactive TV receiver 3 and server 4, not<br>
requiring dial operation or sound (voice) response at all, helper system or emergency report system for general household can be easily constructed.<br>
The constitution of the parts in the interactive television system having online bidirectional function not relating to the broadcast is same as in the fifth embodiment, that is, the first embodiment, and detailed description is omitted (see FIG. 3).<br>
The internal structure of the multimedia teletext receiver 33 and transmission timing of the control data in the sixth embodiment (script and screen control information) are also same as in the fifth embodiment, that is, the first embodiment, and detailed description is omitted (see FIGS. 4, 5, 6A and 6B).<br>
An example of operation of the sixth embodiment is described below.  The' bidirectional information exchange service using the broadcast wave is explained in the fifth embodiment, and detailed description is omitted.<br>
The information exchange service not relating to broadcast wave is described below.<br>
First, the viewer operates button of the television remote controller 308 to request online information presentation not relating to broadcast (step S71 in FIG. 40).<br>
The interactive TV receiver 3,when.receiving the request of online information presentation by button<br>
operation of the television remote controller 308 from the viewer, transmits the request to the sever 4, by automatically dialing to the server 4 according to the telephone number information of the line connection destination stored in the communication control block [CCB] in the RAM 305 (step S72 in FIG. 40).<br>
The server 4, when receiving the request of online information presentation by manipulation of the television remote controller 308 by the viewer, retrieves the local database (L-DB) 42A (or master database (M-DB) 43A) according to identification information to disclose the presented information guide to the viewer, and acquires the telephone number of the demanding viewer, and transmits the presented information guide menu to the demanding viewer (step S73 in FIG. 40).<br>
At this time, if the private telephone number of the viewer is included in the information received from the interactive TV receiver 3, the process of acquisition of demanding viewer telephone number from the database is skipped, and the line is connected automatically by using the received telephone number.<br>
The interactive TV receiver 3 displays the presented information guide menu on the display screen of the display unit (CRT) 32 according to the data received from the server 4.<br>
On the presented information guide menu screen,<br>
the viewer operates the button of the television remote controller 308, and selects the desired information exchange service from the presented information guide menu (for example, educational program presentation, catalog request guide, merchandise purchase guide, mailing guide, ticket - reservation guide, local program presentation, mail exchange, home helper booking, use of registered main box (emergency report, etc.), hospital and other facility booking, and other information exchange service) by, for example, designation operation of a selector (step S74 in FIG. 40).<br>
At this time, on the presented information guide menu screen, as the viewer manipulates the direction command key of the television remote controller 308, the selected and designated selector is emphasized in display (for example, displayed by flickering), and the specified selector is clarified.<br>
Furthermore, on this screen, when the "decision" key is manipulated, the selection content (request of information exchange service) of the viewer is transmitted to the server 4 (step S75 in FIG. 40).<br>
The server 4, when receiving the request of information exchange service from the viewer, calls the information exchange service information according to the request from the local database (L-DB) 42A or master database (M-DB) 43A, and saves in the transfer<br>
data store buffer not shown, and transmits the information exchange service data according to the request to the demanding interactive TV receiver 3, thereby starting presentation of information exchange service (step S76 in FIG. 40).<br>
At this time, depending on the content of the information exchange service (for example, presentation of pay TV program), the fee processing is started. That is, when presentation of information exchange service is started, in the subscriber database in the local database (L-DB) 42A or master database (M-DB) 43A, the feed control region of the database is updated and controlled, to the subscriber presented with the information exchange service, by transfer information quantity, simple time calculation, or package unit calculation.<br>
In this way, the viewer of the interactive TV receiver 3 can receive information exchange service presented from the server 4 according to the  request, through the medium of the TV receiver.<br>
To terminate the use of this information exchange service, the viewer being presented with the information manipulates, for example, the "menu button" which instructs end of communication of the television remote controller 308, and the information exchange service is terminated, and the selection menu screen for information exchange having plural selectors appears<br>
again.<br>
By the interactive information exchange function by using the general household television receiver as the medium and utilizing the public telephone line, in the system configuration easy to construct and distribute, extremely saving the user's cost, the viewer can receive desired information exchange service (for example, educational program, catalog request, merchandise purchase, mailing, ticket reservation, and local program presentation) by simple button operation of the television remote controller 308.<br>
Specifically, by providing the server 4 with the transaction processing function for executing the reception process of the merchandise designated by the viewer, and acquiring the address information of the viewer by retrieval of the subscriber database (local database (L-DB) 42A, master database (M-DB) 43A) according to the identification information, varied transaction procedures of catalog request, merchandise purchase, mailing, ticket reservation and others can be done easily by simple manipulation of the television remote controller.<br>
Or, by providing the server 4 with the transaction processing function for executing the reception process of the merchandise designated by the viewer, and acquiring the address (address, name, postal code, etc.) information of the demanding viewer by retrieval<br>
of the subscriber database according to the identification information, varied transaction procedures of catalog request, merchandise purchase, mailing, ticket reservation and others can be done easily by simple manipulation of the television remote controller.<br>
Also by providing the server 4 with the mail exchange and storing mechanism, mails can be exchanged between interactive TV receivers 3.<br>
Moreover, by utilizing the mail exchange function by the interactive TV receiver 3, not requiring dial operation or sound (voice) response at all, helper system or emergency report system for general household can be easily constructed.<br>
Thus, the sixth embodiment constructs an online interactive television system, not relating to the broadcast, of high utility and excellent controllability for general household in an economically advantageous system configuration, by effectively utilizing the broadness in coverage and rapidity in reporting which are basic features of television broadcast, public telephone lines, etc., spread widely as the existing infrastructure.<br>
