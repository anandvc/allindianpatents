Cigarette Pack age<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a cigarette pack of the hinge-lid-box (hinge-lid-pack) type, comprising a box part, a lid connected thereto and a collar, the box part and lid forming corresponding, upright front ana rear pack edges with a round cross section - round edges.<br>
Hinge-lid boxes with rounded pack edges are known (EP 0 204 933) . The rounded portion of the pack edges, in the case of this known configuration, is adapted to the dimensions of the cigarettes, that is to say to the radius of a cigarette.<br>
The object of the invention is for a cigarette pack or hinge-lid box with round edges to be developed further and improved so as to achieve improved handling and a higher degree of stability for the pack without more material being used.<br>
In order to achieve this object, the cigarette pack according to the invention is defined in that an (imaginary) radius of the round edges is considerably larger than the radius of a cigarette, that is to say it has, in particular, a radius of 6 mm to 10 mm, preferably of approximately 8 mm. The radius of a cigarette is approximately 3.8 mm.<br>
As a result of the configuration of the round edges according to the invention, the greatest part of the s i de wal 1 s of the packs i s formed by the rounded portions or round edges. A side strip of side walls of the packs, this side strip being defined between the round edges,  is planar according to one particular<br><br>
embodiment of the pack, and according to another embodiment is likewise rounded with a radius considerably larger than the radius of the round edges.<br>
The configuration of the pack according to the invention ensures material-saving production. Furthermore, handling by the user is improved on account of the pronounced rounded portions. Finally, the latter also give rise to increased dimensional stability of the pack overall.<br>
One special feature is the configuration of the blanks, to be precise, on the one hand, in respect of the preparation of folding tabs for forming the rounded portions and, on the other hand, in respect of the configuration of corner tabs which, in the region of a base wall and of an end wall, on account of the geometrical shape and arrangement, give rise to an increase in the dimensional stability in the region of the rounded portions.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the packs according to the invention are explained in more detail hereinbelow with reference to the drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 shows a perspective illustration of a rounded hinge-lid box for cigarettes in the closed position,<br>
figure 2 shows the pack according to figure 1 with the lid open,<br>
figure 3 shows a spread-out, non-folded blank for a pack according to figures 1 and 2,<br>
figure 4 shows a blank of a collar for a pack according to figures 1 and 2,<br>
figure 5  shows another exemplary embodiment of a pack<br><br>
in an illustration corresponding to figure 1,<br>
figure 6  shows the pack according to figure 5 in the open position,<br>
figure 7  shows a spread-out, non-folded blank for a pack according to figures 5 and 6,<br>
figure 8 shows a blank for a collar of the pack according to figures 5 and 6,<br>
figure 9 shows a pack according to figures 1 and 2 in a horizontal section along section plane IX-IX from figure 1, and<br>
figure 10 shows an illustration analogous to figure 9 for the pack according to figures 5 and 6 along section plane X-X from figure 5.<br>
The exemplary embodiments shown deal with packs of the hinge-lid-box type for accommodating cigarettes 10. Such a pack comprises a (bottom) box part 11 and a lid 12. The latter is connected in a pivotable manner to the box part 11. This pack also contains a collar 13, which is anchored in the front of the box part 11 and has a top region projecting out of the box part 11.<br>
The pack contents are, namely a cigarette group 14 is, fully enclosed by an inner blank 15 made of tin foil or paper, a cigarette block 16 thus being formed. The pack is usually wrapped in an outer film (not shown) , which is wholly or partially removed when the pack is opened for the first time.<br>
The box part 11 comprises a front wall 17, a rear wall 18,  side  walls  19  and 20  and  a  base wall  21. Analogously, the lid comprises a lid front wall 22, lid rear wall 23, lid side walls 24, 25 and a top end wall 26. The lid rear wall 23 is connected to the rear wall<br><br>
18 of the box part 11 via a transversely directed linear articulation 27.<br>
The blank for this type of pack is constructed such that the front wall 17, base wall 21, rear wall 18, lid rear wall 23, end wall 2 6 and lid front wall 22 successively form a unit. Fitted on the free border of the lid front wall 22 is a customary lid inner tab 28 which, when the pack is finished, is folded against the inside of the lid front wall 22 and is connected to the latter.<br>
The side walls 19, 20 and lid side walls 24, 25 comprise partially overlapping side tabs, namely outer side tabs 29, inner side tabs 30, outer lid side tabs 31 and inner lid side tabs 32.<br>
The collar 13 comprises a separate blank (figures 4 and 8), forming a collar front wall 33 and collar side tabs 34.<br>
One special feature of the packs is the configuration of the side walls 19, 20 and lid side walls 24, 25. These  are  all  rounded,  with  pronounced  rounded portions.<br>
In the case of the exemplary embodiment according to figures 1 to 4 and figure 9, the side walls 19, 2 0 and 24, 25 are all rounded throughout. The side walls 19, 20; 24, 25 comprise rounding regions of different shapes and sizes and with different radii, albeit such that the individual regions merge into one another, and into the associated pack walls, in a step-free manner, namely approximately tangentially.<br>
In the case of a hinge-lid box, customary, upright pack edges 35, 3 6 are provided with a marked rounded portion. Each of these round pack edges 35, 36 extends - as seen in cross section - over a region which is<br><br>
considerably smaller than that of a quarter-circle. The rounded portion, that is to say the radius of the pack edges 35, 36, is considerably larger than the rounded portion of a cigarette 10, that is to say it has a radius of 6 mm to 10 mm in particular of approximately 8 mm. A round intermediate component, namely a rounding region 37, is formed between the resulting pack edges<br>
35,	36. This rounding region adjoins the rounded<br>
portions of the pack edges 35, 3 6 in a transition-free<br>
manner to produce a smooth round shape of the side<br>
walls 19, 20; 24, 25 overall. The side walls thus<br>
comprise three adjoining rounded portions overall. The<br>
central rounding region 37 has a considerably larger<br>
radius than the rounded portions of the pack edges 35,<br>
36,	namely in the order of magnitude of 15 mm to 2 0 mm,<br>
in particular approximately 17 mm.<br>
The side walls 19, 20; 24, 25 are formed by the side tabs 29, 30; 31, 32. The abovementioned side tabs overlap one another exclusively in the region of the central rounding region 37.<br>
The collar 13 is adapted to the inner shape of the pack, namely parallel to the rounded portions of the front pack edges 35, 36. At the rear, the collar side tabs 34 extend up to the pack edges 35, 36.<br>
In the case of the hinge-lid box according to figures 5 to 9 and 10, the round pack edges 35, 36 are more clearly defined, that is to say they extend precisely over a quarter-circle. These corresponding round pack edges 35, 36 are adj oined by a side strip 38 which, with the pack edges 35, 36, forms the side wall 19, 2 0 and lid side wall 23, 24. The rounded portions of the pack edges 35, 36 merge tangentially here into the side strip 38, on the one hand, and into the front wall 17, 22 and rear wall 18, 23, on the other hand. The width of the side strip 3 8 is attained from the transverse dimensions of the pack in dependence on the number of<br><br>
cigarettes 10 and, in the case of the exemplary embodiment shown, is approximately 7 mm to 8 mm. It is also the case with this example that the pack edges have a radius of approximately 8 mm.<br>
The side tabs 29, 30; 31, 32 overlap one another exclusively in the region of the central side strip 38, to be precise only in a central subregion of the same, a spacing of approximately 0.5 mm being left on both sides (figure 10).<br>
The blanks for producing the packs are coordinated in a particular way with the shape of the latter. The blank for a pack in the cross-sectional shape of figure 9, this blank being shown in figure 3, is prepared for the round regions over the entire width of the side tabs 29, 30 and lid side tabs 31, 32, to be precise by virtue of these blank parts being pretreated correspondingly, specifically by the provision of longitudinally running parallel scorings 39, which are introduced by virtue of the blanks being stamped. The blank regions prepared by scoring 39 are defined by dashed parallel lines.<br>
The base wall 21 and end wall 26 are adapted to the cross-sectional contour of the pack (figure 9). Lateral borders 40 are rounded, to be precise in accordance with the abovedescribed contour of the side walls 19, 20; 24, 25 in figure 9, that is to say with a plurality of adjoining rounded portions.<br>
Corner tabs 41, 42, which are assigned to the base wall 21, on the one hand, and the end wall 26, on the other hand, are designed in a particular way. The corner tabs 41, 42 are fitted on the inner side tabs 3 0 and lid side tabs 32, to be precise - in the initial position -in a free region alongside the base wall 21 and end wall 26.<br><br>
Each side is assigned two corner tabs 41, 42, which are separated from one another by a wedge-shaped punching 43. When the pack is finished (figure 2) , the two corner tabs 41, 42 each butt on the inside against the end wall 26, and analogously against the base wall 21, in the region of a side wall 19, 20. The relative position is shown in figure 2 with reference to the end wall 26. On account of the rounded portion, on the one hand, and of the V-shaped punching 43, on the other hand, the two corner tabs 41, 42 butt directly against one another without overlapping.<br>
A further special feature is the contour of the corner tab 42, which is assigned in each case to a rounded, front pack edge 35. The essentially trapezoidal corner tab 42 has, on the outside, an initially arcuate and then rectilinear, sloping contour 44. This contour is designed such that the corner tab 42 butts, by way of this contour 44, against the associated round pack edge 3 5 and adjoining regions of the front wall 17 and lid front wall 22 (figure 2) . The corner tab 42 thus helps to stabilize the shape of the pack in the region of the front round pack edge 35. The corner tabs 41, 42 are expediently connected to the base wall 21 and end wall 26 by adhesive bonding.<br>
The blank for configuring the pack according to figure 10 is designed in a particular way. The outer side tab 29 is provided with scorings 39 over the entire surface area. The inner side tabs 30 are provided with scorings 39 in a rounded region, namely with a scoring strip 49 being formed in the process. A border strip 45 which is free of scorings is located alongside the same. This border strip 45 extends in the region of the side strip 38, that is to say it is not of arcuate configuration. The outer side tab 29 may be designed analogously, that is to say likewise with a scoring-free border strip.<br><br>
It is also the case with this exemplary embodiment that the corner tabs 42 are designed such that form-fitting positioning on the inside of the base wall 21 and end wall 2 6 is possible. An outer edge 46 extends in the longitudinal direction of the blank. An inner edge 47 runs in a slightly sloping manner.<br>
The collar 13 (figure 8) is designed in the same way as for the exemplary embodiment described above.<br>
In the case of the exemplary embodiments shown, the lid inner tab 28 is provided with a peripheral punched-out portion 48 for the purpose of creating a closing aid for the lid 12, which is known in the case of hinge-lid boxes.<br>
The cigarettes 10 may be formed in various ways within the cigarette pack designed in the above manner. An advantageous arrangement is one according to figures 9 and 10 with transverse rows each with three cigarettes 10 one beside the other or with two cigarettes 10 one beside the other. It is thus possible for the cigarettes 10 - with the exception of the region of a central transverse plane - to be placed in a "saddle position", that is to say in an offset manner in relation to one another. Two cigarettes 10 located one beside the other are positioned in each case against the respective side walls 19, 20 and lid side walls 24, 25.<br><br><br><br>
