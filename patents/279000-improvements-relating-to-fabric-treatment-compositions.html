IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO FABRIC TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to core shell polymer particles comprising a benefit agent, which is preferably a perfume.  It also relates to the use of such particles for delivery to fabric during laundering.  The invention will be described with specific reference to the delivery of perfume as the particularly preferred benefit agent although it is not intended to exclude other benefit agents.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Perfume is an expensive component of laundry treatment compositions and many attempts have been made to improved the deposition of perfume during the wash and obtain a longer-lasting release of perfume.  There are other expensive benefit agents, for example anti-microbials and lubricants, but perfume accounts for a large proportion of the cost of a laundry cleaning or conditioning composition. One approach to improving the effective deposition of perfume and other materials has been the use of microcapsules.  Micro-encapsulation has been proposed for other benefit agents.<br>

EP1502646 Al (The Procter &amp; Gamble Company) discloses microcapsules for use in liquid detergents having a core and a polyelectrolyte complex shell in the form of a semi¬permeable membrane having specific bursting force and 5  density properties. The shell is an ionic complex: of poly-cations and poly-anions. The core is a perfume. EP1244768 Bl. (EASF Aktiengesellschaft) discloses microcapsules of 1 - 100 micron in size that have a liquid core made of a hydrophobic material including a perfume<br>
10  substance and a capsule envelope, which can be obtained by i) radical polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising 3 0 to 100 weight percent of one or more CI -C24 -alkylester of acrylic and/or methacrylie acid, 0 to 70 weight percent of one bifunctional or polyfunctional<br>
15  monomer, 0 to 40 weight percent of other monomers or ii) acid-induced condensation of melamine formaldehyde precondensates and/or the CI -C 4 -alkylethers thereof.<br>
Microencapsulates of perfume made by precipitation and 20  deposition of polymers at an interface such as in<br>
coacervates, for example are disclosed in GE-A-0 751 600., US-A-2 341 466 and EP-A-0 385 534, or other polymerisation routes such as interfacial condensation as described in US-A-3577515, US-A-2003/0125222, US-A-6020066, 25  WO2003/101606 and/or US-A-5 066 419.<br>
A particularly useful means of encapsulation is using the melamine/urea - formaldehyde condensation reaction as described in US-A-3516941, U3-A-5066 419 and US-A-5154842. 30  Such capsules are made by first emulsifying perfume in small<br>

droplets in a pre-condensate medium obtained by the reaction of melamine/urea and formaldehyde and then allowing the polymerisation reaction to proceed along with precipitation at the oil-water interface.  The encapsulates ranging in 5  size from a few micrometer to a millimeter are then obtained in the form of a suspension in an aqueous medium.<br>
There are numerous disclosures concerning the use of particles in non-aqueous liquids, especially for unit dose 10  applications, e.g., WO-A-2003/48293 and WO-A-02/057402.<br>
Incorporation of such core-in-shell encapsulates in detergent powders is relatively straightforward. The capsule slurries can be mixed with the detergent as is known from 15  US-A-5 066 419 or spray dried and then blended with detergent granules as described in US-A-2003/0125222.<br>
Microcapsule formation is a relatively eaqpensive processing step and this can significantly increase the already high<br>
20  cost of benefit agents such as perfume.  Losses of perfume due to breakage of the capsule during formulation, transport and storage can occur. It is therefore important to improve survival, deposition and adherence of the encapsulated perfume during the steps from addition to the formulation<br>
25  through to the end of a laundering process.<br>
Core-shell encapsulation, as used in the present invention is not the only method known for the encapsulation of benefit agents. Other methods include adsorpticn onto a 30  porous material such as a zeolite which may then be coated<br>

with a water soluble shell to prevent premature release of the perfume.<br>
Many approaches are known for the improvement of deposition 5 of materials in the wash. EP1432782 is directed to a water dispersible particle comprising a deposition enhancing part of one or more polymeric units and a benefit agent attached to the deposition enhancing part. Preferably the deposition aid has a hydrolysable group (based on esters), such as 10 Cellulose Mono-Acetate (CMA). The CMA grafted materials exhibit enhanced wash deposition.<br>
VJO2004/056850 is directed towards a process for the preparation of polysaccharide grafted latex particles, which 15  comprises conventional emulsion polymerisation, and to the materials thus produced. The particles have been used as carriers for benefit agents, including softeners, for deposition under main wash conditions.<br>

Definition of the Invention<br>
We have now determined that improved benefit-agent containing particulates can be formed by polymerisation of 25  outer shells around preformed particulates in which the<br>
outer shell contains a polymer, preferably a polysaccharide, which is capable of binding to cellulose.<br>
Accordingly, a first aspect of the invention provides an 30  encapsulate comprising a benefit agent core, one or mere<br>

inner shells and an outer shell comprising a structural polymer and an uncharged polymer which is substantive to cellulose, at least one of said shells being impermeable to the benefit agent, and the core being formed prior to the 5  shells.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention provides a method for forming encapsulates which comprises the step of forming a outer polymeric shell on a pre-existing core-shell 10  benefit-agent encapsulate, wherein the outer polymeric shell is formed in the presence of an uncharged cellulose substantive polymer.<br>
A third aspect of the present invention comprises a method 15  for treating cellulosic textile articles which comprises laundering the articles in the presence of the aforementioned benefit-agent encapsulates.<br>
A  fourth aspect of the present invention comprises a laundry 20  treatment composition which comprises the aforementioned<br>
benefit-agent encapsulates and at least one detergent or at least one fabric conditioner.<br>
The presence of the cellulose-substantive polymer in the 25  outer shell makes the core-shell encapsulates substantive to cotton and regenerated cellulose containing articles, this assists in the deposition of the encapsulates during the wash and the retention of the encapsulates on the article being washed. During subsequent use of the articles the<br>

A particular advantage of having an uncharged polymer is that it does not interact with other formulation components through anionic-cationic binding (such as would be the case with cationic polymers and anionic surfactants). Polymers 5  without cationic groups are also generally envisaged to be less toxic and less prone to malcdor production.<br>
It is particularly preferable that the benefit agent comprises perfume components. It is particularly 10  advantageous that, as compared with 'off the shelf perfume encapsulates, the encapsulates of the present invention deliver more perfume impact.<br>
1s  Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In order that the present invention may be better understood certain preferred and optional features of the invention will now be described: 20<br>
The pre-formed particle:<br>
As mentioned above the pre-formed particle is a core-shell encapsulate. Such encapsulates, particularly those in which 25  the benefit agent is a perfume, are available in the marketplace or may be manufactured.<br>

Examples of perfume capsules which are available in the marketplace include 'Bayscent Lemon' (TM ex. Lanxess, previously Bayer Chemicals). It is sold as a 50% water based dispersion of a polyurethane encapsulate containing a liquid 5  lemon fragrance oil. The perfume level of which is typically around 40-50%.<br>
The manufacture of encapsulate particles is described in a number of patents. These particles may have a simple single 10  shell or the shell may be made up of layers providing, for example, water-insolubility, structural strength and impermeability. It is however commonplace for a single shell to provide all of these features.<br>
15  It is preferable that the pre-formed particle has an existing shell, which is both water-insoluble and impermeable to the benefit agent (such as perfume). However it is envisaged that the shell of the preformed particle may be permeable to the benefit agent but provide physical<br>
20  stability to the pre-formed particle, with the outer shell adding both the affinity for cellulose and the impermeability.<br>
Preferred pre-formed particles are the so-called 25  polyurethane, polymethyl-methacrylate, melamine-urea or<br>
melamine-formaldehyde encapsulates. These can be formed by interfacial polymerisation as is known in the art. The pre¬formed capsules can also be co-acervate derived particles where the shell is formed from anionic and cationic polymers 30  in complex form.<br>
 <br>

-8-<br>
The outer shell:<br>
The structural polymer used in the outer shell of 5  encapsulates according to the present invention can comprise a wide range of monomeric units. By "monomer units" as used herein is meant the monomeric units of the polymer chain, thus references to "a polymer comprising insoluble monomer units" as used herein means that the polymer is derived from 10  insoluble monomers, and so forth.<br>
Preferably, the monomer units are suitable for free radical polymerisation.  Therefore, preferably the monomer contains at least one ethylenically unsaturated group capable of 15  undergoing addition polymerisation.<br>
Suitable classes of monomers are given in the group consisting of olefins, ethylene, vinylaromatic monomers, esters of vinyl alcohol with mono- and di-carboxylic acids,<br>
20  esters of  , -monoethylenically unsaturated mono- and dicarboxylic acids with alcohols, nitriles of  , -monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, conjugated dienes,  , -monoethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids and their amides, rnethacrylic acid and<br>
25  its esters with alcohols and diols, acrylic acid and its esters with alcohols and diols, dimethyl or di-n-butyl maleate, and vinyl-sulfonic acid and its water-soluble salts, and mixtures thereof.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/062833	PCT/EP2006/011472<br>
-9<br>
The shell may optionally comprise monomers which are cross-linkers. Such crosslinkers may have at least two non-conjugated ethylenically unsaturated double bonds. Examples are alkylene glycol diacrylates and dimethacrylates. A further type of suitable cross-linking monomers are those that are conjugated, such as divinyl benzene. If present, these monomers constitute from 0.1 to 10 % by weight, based on the total amount of monomers to be polymerised in the shell. The level of cross-linker can be used to control the breakage strength of the shell.<br>
The monomers are more preferably selected from the following:-<br>
a)	vinyl octate; Vinyl decanote; vinyl laurate; vinyl stear3te; esters of acrylic, methacrylic, maleic, fumaric or itaconic acid with decyl, dodecyl, tetadecyl, hexadecyl and octadecyl alcohol,<br>
b)	styrene;  -methylstyrene; o-chlorostyrene vinyl acetate; vinyl propionate; vinyl n-butyrate; esters of acrylic, methacrylic, maleic, fumaric or itaeonic acid with methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, n-hexyl and 2-ethylhexyl alcohol; 1,2-butadiene; 2,3 dimethyl butadiene; and isoprene,<br>
c)	acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric<br>
acid, itaeonic acid, poly (alkylene oxide) monoacrylates and<br>
monomethacrylates, N-vinyl-pyrrolidone, methacrylic and<br>

monomer mixture at levels of up to 10 % based on weight of monomers used.<br>
5  The cellulose binding polymer:<br>
As noted above, the outer shell is formed in the presence of an uncharged cellulose-binding polymer. The presence cf this cellulose-binding polymer in the outer shell is believed to 10  provide encapsulates with their affinity for cotton and other cellulosic materials.<br>
Preferably, the cellulose-binding polymer is a polysaccharide. The polysaccharide preferably has a £-1,4-15  linked backbone.<br>
Preferably the polysaccharide is a cellulose, a cellulose<br>
derivative, or another p-1,4-linked polysaccharide having an affinity for cellulose, such as polymannan, polyglucan, 20  polyglucomannan, polyzcyloglucan and polygalactomannan or a mixture thereof.<br>
The polysaccharide may gain its affinity for cellulose upon hydrolysis, such as is the case with cellulose mono-acetate 25  or, preferably, may have a natural affinity for cellulose.<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide-is selected from the group consisting of poly:-:yloglucan and polygalactomannan. Naturally-occuring polymers or the shorter hydrolysis 30  products of naturally occurring polymers are particularly<br>

preferred. For example, preferred polysaccharides are locust bean gum, tamarind xyloglucan, guar gum or mixtures thereof. Preferred molecular weights for the polymers fall in the range 4OkDalton-lMDalton<br>
5<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the polysaccharide is locust bean gum (LEG). This does not hydrolyse and has a natural affinity for cellulose. LEG is (also called Carob bean gum and Carubin) is extracted from the seed (kernels)<br>
10  of the carob tree {Ceratonia siliqua).<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide backbone has only £-1,4 linkages. Optionally, the polysaccharide has linkages in addition to the £-1,4 linkages, such as £-1,2 linkages.<br>
15  Thus, optionally some other linkages are present.<br>
Polysaccharide backbones which include some material which is not a saccharide ring are also within the ambit of the present invention (whether terminal or within the polysaccharide chain).<br>
20<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched. Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least soma degree of branching, or at any rate at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups (which are<br>
25  therefore not in themselves counted in determining the<br>
degree of substitution) on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide is present at levels of between 0.1% to 20% w/w by weight of the total amount of 20  monomer in the outer shell. Particularly preferred levels<br>

are 1-3% w/w where sufficient affinity is obtained v;ithout excessive use of polysaccharide.<br>
5  The benefit agent:<br>
The core of the encapsulate comprises a benefit agent. When used in laundering, the core-shell polymer particle deposits onto the fabric. The core-shell polymer particle may<br>
10  therefore be used in the treatment of fabric. Such treatment may provide a softening, conditioning, lubricating, crease reducing, ease of ironing, moisturising, colour preserving and/or anti-pilling, quick drying, UV protecting, shape retaining, soil releasing, texturising, insect repelling,<br>
15  fungicidal, dyeing and/or fluorescent benefit to the fabric. However, the preferred benefit is the delivery of perfume.<br>
The core shell polymer particle may be incorporated into a laundry treatment composition and used in the treatment of 20  cotton-containing fabric.<br>
The core shell polymer particle may confer a protection benefit to the benefit agent from the action of surfactants. The protection is conferred before and after the benefit<br>
25  agent has been deposited onto a surface. For example, during a laundry process, whilst the particle is present in the wash liquor, the polymer keeps the benefit agent bound up within the particle thereby preventing it from being leached out of the particle by the surfactants, thus keeping it<br>
30  available for deposition onto the fabric. After deposition<br>

of the particle onto fabric, the polymer in the core protects the benefit agent from being -washed away by surfactants, thus enhancing longevity of substantivity of the benefit agent to the fabric. 5<br>
A wide range of benefit agents may be used in the present invention. Suitably, the benefit agent may be selected from the group consisting of fabric softeners, conditioners, soil release polymers, shape retention agents, anti-crease<br>
10  agents, ease of ironing aids, quick drying aids, lubricants, texturising agents, insecticides, insect repellents, fungicides, photofading inhibitors, dyes, pigments, fluorescers, and sunscreens, or mixtures thereof. Benefit agents are preferably chemical and/or mechanical protective<br>
15  agents, such as fabric softeners, conditioners, shape<br>
retention agents, anti-crease agents, ease of ironing aids, lubricants, texturising agents, insecticides, insect repellents, fungicides, photofading inhibitors and sunscreens, or mixtures thereof. Cosmetic and pharmaceutical<br>
20  benefit agents may also be used.<br>
The benefit agent may be a lubricant, such as a silicone, mineral oil, vegetable oil and sugar polyester. The benefit agent is preferably a biodegx-adeable lubricant, such as 25  vegetable oils and sugar polyesters. A highly preferred<br>
lubricant in the context of the present invention is a sugar polyester (SPE). They are known in fabric conditioners and/or softeners. These materials are non-toxic and inherently biodegradable.<br>

Typically these materials are the products obtainable by esterification of a sugar, such as a saccharide (or other cyclic polyol), with a fatty material. In the context of the invention, the sugar is preferably a disaccharide,<br>
5  preferably sucrose, that is esterified with fatty acid, -wherein the degree of esterif ication is from 1 (mono) to 8 (octa). The fatty acid preferably has a chain length of from C12 to C22 and may be monounsaturated. Examples of suitable fatty acids are Laurie (C12), Myristic(C14), Palmitic(C16),<br>
10  Stearic (£18), Oleic(CI8:1), Eehenic(C22) and Erucic(C22:l).<br>
The HydrOphilic-Lipophilic Balance (HLB) value of the SPE's that are suitable for use in the invention are suitably from 0 to 4, preferably from 0 to 2. HLB is a well known 15  parameter to those skilled in the art and a literature reference is: "Modern Aspects of Emulsion Science", The Royal Society of Chemistry, 1998, page 179.<br>

noted that these sucrose polyesters normally contain a spread of.degree of substitution on the saccharide rings, for example, sucrose tetrastearate also comprises tristearate, pentastearate, hexastearate, etc. Furthermore, 5  the sugar polyesters may contain traces of surfactant which is separate from the main surfactant and the co-surfactant. The SPE can be a mixture of different fatty acids, such as a mixture of oleate and stearate, for example, palm kernal contains a mixture of laurie acid, stearic acid, myristic 10  acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid.<br>
A highly preferred sugar polyester for use in the present invention is ER-290 ex Mitsubishi Ryoto, which is a sucrose tetraerucate and according to the manufacturers spec is 15  mainly Pentaerucate, Tetraerucate and Hexaerucate and has a HLB value of 2.<br>
The lubricant (such as a sugar polyester) can be incorporated into the core at a wide range cf levels. For 20  example, of from 0.1 to 59 %, preferably from 50 to 59 % by weight of the total core.<br>
Further suitable lubricants are amino functional silicone oils such as Rhodorsil Oil Extrasoft supplied by P.hodia 25  Silicones. Other silicones may be selected from those<br>

As noted above, particularly preferred benefit agents are perfumes. As also noted above, pre-formed encapsulated perfumes are available in the marketplace.<br>
Useful components of the perfume include materials of both natural and synthetic origin. They include single compounds and mixtures. Specific examples of such components may be found in the current literature, e.g., in Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavor Ingredients, 1975, CRC Press; Synthetic Food Adjuncts, 1947 by M. B. Jacobs, edited by Van Ncstrand; or Perfume and Flavor Chemicals by S. Arctander 1969, Montclair, W.J. (USA) . These substances are well known to the person skilled in the art of perfuming, flavoring, and/or aromati-ing consumer products, i.e., of imparting an odor and/or a flavor or taste to a consumer product traditionally perfumed or flavored, or of modifying the odor and/or taste of said consumer product.<br>
By perfume in this context is not only meant a fully formulated product fragrance, but also selected components of that fragrance, particularly those which are prone to loss, such as the so-called 'top notes'.<br>
Top notes are defined by Poucher (Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists 6(2):8O [1955]).  Examples of well known top-notes include citrus oils, linalool, linalyl acetate, lavender, dihydromyrcenol, rose oxide and cis-3-hexanol. Top notes typically comprise 15-25%Wt of a perfume composition and in those embodiments of the invention which contain an<br>

Typical perfume components which it is advantageous to 5  encapsulate, include those with a relatively low boiling point, preferably those with a boiling point of less than 300, preferably less than 250 Celsius. It is also advantageous to encapsulate perfume components which have a low LogP (ie. those which will be partitioned into water), 10  preferably with a LogP of less than 3.0.

It is commonplace for a plurality of perfume components to be present in a formulation. In the encapsulates of the present invention it is envisaged that there will be four oi¬ls  more, preferably five or more, more preferably six or more or even seven or more different perfume components from the list given of delayed blooming perfumes given above present in the encapsulated perfume.<br>
20  Another group of perfumes with which the present invention can be applied are the so-called * aromatherapy' materials. These include many components also used in perfumery, including components of essential oils such as Clary Sage, Eucalyptus, Geranium, Lavender, Mace Extract, Meroli,<br>
25  Nutmeg, Spearmint, Sweet Violet Leaf and Valerian.  By means of the present invention these materials can be transferred to textile articles that will be worn or otherwise come into contact with the human body (such as handkerchiefs and bed-linen) .<br>

Particularly preferred encapsulates are those in which the core comprises perfume components as a benefit agent and the outer polymeric shell comprises a cellulose-binding polysaccharide is selected from the group of locust bean 5  gum, tamarind xyloglucan, guar gum or mixtures thereof. Manufacture:<br>
The preferred process for the manufacture of encapsulates according to the present invention is radical polymerisation 10  of an outer shell around an existing encapsulate.<br>
The shell-forming polymers mentioned above, particularly vinyl acetates, are suitable for radical polymerisation. Those skilled in the art will recognise that a chemical 15  initiator will generally be required but that there are<br>
instances in which alternative forms of initiation will be possible, e.g. ultrasonic initiation or initiation by irradiation.<br>
20  A preferred process comprises the steps of:<br>
(i)   obtaining an encapsulated benefit agent,<br>
(ii)  suspending the encapsulated benefit agent in a 25        aqueous medium which is preferably free of added surfactants and contains both the monomer and the cellulose-binding polysaccharide,<br>
(iii) adding an initiator such that polymerisation 30        proceeds.<br>

In a typical embodiment the reaction mixture is heated to 50-100 Celsius to facilitate polymerisation over a period of 1-5 hours.<br>
5  The initiator is preferably a chemical or chemicals capable of forming free radicals. Typically, free radicals can be formed either by hemolytic scission (i.e. hemolysis) of a single bond or by single electron transfer to or from an ion or molecule (e.g. redox reactions).<br>
10<br>
Suitably, in context of the invention, hemolysis may be achieved by the application of heat (typically in the range of from 50 tol00°C). Some examples of suitable initiators in this class are those possessing peroxide (-0-0-) or aco (-<br>
15  II=II-) groups, such as benzoyl peroxide, t-butyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile and ammonium persulphate. Hemolysis may also be achieved by the action of radiation (usually ultraviolet), in which case it is termed photolysis. Examples are the dissociation of 2,2'-asobis (2-<br>
20  cyanopropane) and the formation of free radicals from benzophehone and benzoin.<br>
Redox reactions can also be used to generate free radicals. In this case an oxidising agent is paired with a reducing 25  agent which then undergo a redox reaction. Some examples of appropriate pairs in the context of the invention are ammonium persulphate/ sodium metabisulphite, cumyl hydroperoxide/ ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide/ ascorbic acid.<br>
 <br>

Preferred initiators are selected from the following:<br>
Homolytic:    benzoyl peroxide, t-t-utyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile, ammonium persulphate, 2,2'-acobis (cyanopropane), benzophenone, benzoin,<br>
Redox:        ammonium persulphate/ sodium rnetabisulphite mixture, cumyl hydroperoxide/ ferrous ion mixture and/or hydrogen peroxide/asorbic acid mixture. Preferred initiators are ammonium persulphate and hydrogen peroxide/asorbic acid mixture.<br>
The preferred level of initiator is in the range of from 0.1 to 5.0 % w/w by weight of monomer, more preferably, the level is in the range of from 1.0 to 3.0 % w/w by weight of monomer.<br>
Where the benefit agent is SPE, the preferred initiator is ammonium persulphate and the aqueous phase is buffered with sodium bicarbonate.<br>
Chain transfer agents can optionally be used to reduce the degree of polymerisation and hence the final molecular weight of the polymer. A chain transfer agent contains very labile hydrogen atoms that are easily abstracted by a propagating polymer chain. This terminates the polymerisation of the growing polymer, but generates a new reactive site on the chain transfer agent that can then<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/062833<br>
 <br>
PCT/EP2006/011472<br>
 <br>

proceed to initiate further polymerisation of the remaining monomer. Chain transfer agents in the context of the invention typically contain thiol (mercaptan) functionality and can be represented by the general chemical formula RS-H, 5  such as n-dodecyl mercaptan and 2-mercaptoethanol.<br>
Preferred chain transfer agents are mono-thioglycerol and n-<br>
dodecyl mercaptan, used at levels of, pi-eferably from 0 to 5<br>
% w/w based on the weight of the monomer and more preferably<br>
10  at a level of 0.25 % w/w based on the weight of the monomer.<br>
It is believed that the cellulose-binding polysaccharide can take a useful part in the polymerisation reaction. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that in the<br>
15  presence of the initiator the polysaccharide become<br>
radically active and the species formed can both initiate and terminate the radical chain propagation. This is believed to result in the covalent attachment of the polysaccharide to the particle surface, in addition to<br>
20  entrapment or physical adsorption on the polymer as it is being formed from the monomers.<br>
The ratio of encapsulate to coating is preferably better than 40:50, and more preferably 50:50 or better. Typically, 25  the ratio will lie in the range 50:50 to 90:10. Above 90:10 there is reduced deposition.<br>

Particularly suitable is a protease obtained from a strain 5  of Eacillus having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, being commercially available, e.g. from Novozymes Industri A/S under the registered trade-names Esperase (Trade Mark) and Savinase (Trade-Mark). The preparation of these and analogous enzymes is described in GB 1 243 735. 10  Other commercial proteases are Kazusase (Trade Mark<br>
obtainable from Showa-Denko of Japan), Optimase (Trade Mark from Miles Kali-Chemie, Hannover, West Germany), and Superase (Trade Mark obtainable from Pfizer of U.S.A.).<br>
15  Detergency enzymes are commonly employed in granular form in amounts Of from about 0.1 to about 3.0 wt%. However, any suitable physical form of enzyme may be used.<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain alkali metal, 20  preferably sodium carbonate, in order to increase detergency and ease processing. Sodium carbonate may suitably be present in amounts ranging from 1 to 60 wt%, preferably from 2 to 40 wt%. However, compositions containing little or no sodium carbonate are also within the scope of the invention. 25<br>

compositions have bulk densities of at least 650 g/litre, more preferably at least 700 g/litre.<br>
Such powders may be prepared either by post-tower densification of spray-dried powder, or by wholly non-tower methods such as dry mixing and granulation; in both cases a high-speed mixer/granulator may advantageously be used. Processes using high-speed mixer/granulators are disclosed, for example, in EP 340 013A, EP 267 339A, EP 390 251A and EP 420 317A (Unilever).<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations. Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in compact form which means it will contain a lower level of water compared to a conventional liquid detergent.<br>
Product forms include powders, liquids, gels, tablets, any of which are optionally incorporated in a water-soluble or water dispersible sachet. The means for manufacturing any o the product forms are well known in the art.

Linitest Equipment and Procedure<br>
A section of unfluoresced cotton measuring 20 cm by 20 cm was placed into each linitest pot containing the wash liquor-and polymer particles and the pot was sealed.<br>
The Linitest is a laboratory scale washing machine (Ex. Heraeus) . The equipment is designed and built to comply with the requirements for international standard test specifications.  It is used for small scale detergency and stain removal testing particularly when lov; liquor to cloth ratios are required.<br>
There are various models of the Linitest commercially<br>
<br>
30 available. The model used in this case has a single rotation<br>

speed of 40 rpm.  The carrier is capable of accommodating twelve 500ml steel containers and can be operated at temperatures up to 100°C.<br>
5  The Linitest comprises a 20 litre tank, control system and drive mechanism.  Permanent thermostatically controlled tubular heating elements in the base of the tank heat the bath liquor to the required temperature.  The stainless steel construction throughout ensures efficient heat<br>
10  transfer to the specimen containers that are mounted on a rotating horizontal carrier driven by a geared motor.  The rotating movement of the carrier 'throws' the liquid from one end of the container to the other in a continuous action. This movement simulates the mechanical washing<br>
15  process and additional mechanical action can be obtained by using steel ball bearings or discs.<br>
The Linitest pots were attached to the Linitester cradle and rotated 4 5 minutes at 40°C to simulate the main wash.<br>
20  The cloths were then removed and wrung by hand and a 5ml aliquot of the remaining wash liquor was taken and the absorbance at 4 00nm measured using a 1cm cuvette as before. From interpolation of the initial calibration curve, the concentration of the particles remaining the liquor after<br>
25  the wash could be determined and hence the level deposited (wash deposition) on the cloth could be determined by difference.<br>
The Linitest pots were then thoroughly rinsed and the 30  'wrung' cloths returned to the pots and 125ml of de-ionised<br>

water was added. The Linitester bath water was drained and the pots attached to the cradle and rotated for 10 minutes at ambient temperature (-20°C) to simulate a rinse procedure. The clothes were then removed and wrung by hand.<br>
5  A 5ml aliquot of the rinse solution was taken and the<br>
absorbance at 4 00nm determined. As before interpolation of the initial calibration plot allowed the particle concentration removed from the cloth during the rinse to be determined and by comparison to the initial level deposited<br>
10  prior to the rinse, the percentage loss from the cloth could be determined. This procedure was repeated a further two times to simulate and determine losses from the second and third rinse. The final rinsed cloths were hung up overnight to dry.<br>

For the wash in Example 3 above all samples were dosed at 5  the same solids level (i.e. 4 00ppm) on wash liquor. However Example 1 and 2 particles contain only half the level of perfume (as half the material in each particle is the shell) compared to unmodified Bayscent Lemon or comparative example A. Hence, it was necessary to normalise the perfume scores 30  on the assumption that perfume intensity varies linearly with level present for the unmodified and comparative example A.<br>
