HAIR TREATMENT COMPOSITION COMPRISING DISCRETE DROPLETS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
- 1 -<br>
HAIR TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
5      Shampoo compositions which provide a combination of<br>
cleansing and conditioning to the hair are known in the prior art.  Such shampoo compositions typically comprise one or more surfactants for shampooing or cleansing purposes and one or more conditioning agents.  The purpose of the 10  conditioning agent is to make the hair easier to comb when wet and more manageable when dry, e.g. less static and fly¬away.  Typically, these conditioning agents are either water-insoluble oily materials or cationic materials.<br>
15  Amongst the most popular conditioning agents used in shampoo products are silicone polymers, present in the shampoo as emulsion droplets.  Conditioning is achieved by the silicone being deposited onto the hair resulting in the formation of a film.  Whilst the silicone film gives excellent<br>
20  conditioning, for example wet comb properties, the repeated use of compositions containing silicones can lead to a build-up of silicone and undesirable affects such as a heavy, oily feel to the hair.  This can lead to the perception by some users that their hair is not clean.<br>
25<br>
A problem associated with use of cationic polymers and cationic surfactants as conditioning agents is that the anionic surfactants commonly employed in shampoo compositions as cleansing surfactants. can interact with the<br>
3 0  cationic conditioning agents resulting in poorer performance of the conditioning agent and/or the cleansing surfactant.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
Attempts to overcome this problem have been made by employing nonionic, amphoteric and/or cationic co-surfactants as cleansing agents, but these systems do not generally provide as high a level of cleansing or foaming as 5  do surfactant systems comprising anionic surfactant.<br>
Many consumers habitually apply triglycerides to their hair as part of their regular grooming habits.  Coconut oil is frequently used as a grooming aid by such consumers.<br>
10  Silicones in hair treatment formulations are not generally compatible with film formation on oiled hair to provide conditioning benefits.  There is a need for hair treatment compositions which can provide conditioning benefits to oiled hair.<br>
15<br>
Another class of conditioning agents used in hair treatment compositions is non-silicone water-insoluble oily materials. Such oily materials have been used to a far lesser degree than silicone and cationic conditioning agents.  One reason<br>
2	0  for this is the incompatibility of such materials with hair<br>
treatment surfactants, especially anionic surfactants used in shampoos to provide good cleaning.  Another reason is the inherent instability of emulsions of these oily materials in aqueous-based hair treatment compositions.  This often 25  results in a lack of homogeneity in the hair treatment composition and/or inadequate shelf-life.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for hair treatment compositions containing reduced levels of silicone oily conditioning<br>
3	0  agents to prevent build-up yet which deliver both good<br>
conditioning performance, and which are also stable in the<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
hair treatment composition.  There is also a need for hair treatment compositions which are effective for conditioning the hair of consumers who regularly apply triglycerides to their hair.  There is also a need for hair treatment 5  compositions which deliver conditioning benefits from a cleansing composition without making the users feel that their hair is not clean after use.<br>
EP 0 742 64 discloses aqueous conditioning shampoos 10  comprising anionic or amphoteric surfactant, cationic or nonionic conditioning agents, and a water miscible saccharide.  Suitable conditioning agents include silicones, resinous materials, waxy materials and oily materials.<br>
15  WO 93/08787 discloses conditioning shampoos including<br>
anionic surfactant, dispersed non-volatile nonionic silicone conditioning agent, a water-soluble cationic organic hair-conditioning polymer of specified charge density and an organic, non-volatile, water-insoluble liquid selected from<br>
20  hydrocarbon oils, fatty esters and mixtures thereof.<br>
US 5,344,643 discloses shampoo compositions comprising an anionic surfactant, an oily, water-insoluble conditioning agent, a carboxyvinyl polymer suspending and stabilising 25  agent for the oily conditioning agent and a cationic conditioning agent.<br>
FR 2788971 discloses a hair treatment composition containing an oil with at least one amine and one urethane group and a 3 0  conditioner which may be polyolefin, cationic or amphoteric polymers, cationic proteins and their hydrolysates,<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
silicones, mineral oils, ceramide-type compounds or cationic surfactants.<br>
It has now found that by the use of discrete droplets 5  containing both mineral oil and functionalised silicone, pre-emulsified before its addition to the hair treatment composition, a composition can be provided which supplies conditioning benefits to the hair of hair oil users. Compositions according to the invention can also be 0  beneficial in reducing the long-term build up of silicones on the hair.  Compositions according to the invention can also provide conditioning benefits from a cleansing product with good stability.<br>
5  Summary of the Invention<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there ..is provided a composition for hair treatment comprising discrete droplets characterised in that the droplets, within the same 0  droplet comprise both;<br>
(i)  a functionalised silicone and, (ii) a hydrocarbon oil.<br>
5  Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
By "water-insoluble" is meant that a material is not soluble in water at a -concentration of 0.5% by weight, based on. weight of watex, at 25°C.<br><br>
~ 5 -<br>
Where values for viscosity are specified, these refer to kinematic viscosities measured using suitable apparatus at 25°C.  A suitable apparatus is a capillary viscometer.<br>
5  As used herein, the term "mixture droplet" is used to refer to the discrete droplets comprising both hydrocarbon oil and functionalised silicone.<br>
By discrete droplets, it is meant that whereas the main body 10  of the composition is water-cantinuotis, the droplets form a separate, discontinuous, non-aqueous phase.<br>
It is essential to the invention that both hydrocarbon oil and functionalised silicone are present within common<br>
15  droplets.  In other words, within a single droplet, both<br>
hydrocarbon oil and functionalised silicone must be present together.  However, it is not essential to the invention that every non-aqueous droplet within the composition has this form, so long as an effective amount of the mixture<br>
20  droplets is present in the composition.<br>
In a preferred form of a composition according to the invention, the composition comprises at 0.25 to 0.5% by weight of the mixture droplets. 25<br>
It is also preferred if the mixture droplets comprise at least 5% by weight of functional silicone and at least 5% by weight of hydrocarbon oil expressed as a percentage of the weight or the mixture droplets.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Functionalised Silicone<br>
The functionalised silicone is present in the mixture droplets at a level of at least 5 percent by weight, 5  preferably at least 25  percent by weight, more preferably at least 4 0 percent by weight and most preferably at least 50% by weight based on the total weight of the mixture droplets.<br>
Suitably, the functionalised silicone has a kinematic<br>
2 -l 10  viscosity of less than 1000 mm s  , preferably less than 500<br>
2-1	2-1<br>
mm s  , more preferably less than 200 mm s  at 25 °C.<br>
Suitable functionalised silicones include, for example, amino-, carboxy-, betaine-, quaternary ammonium-, 15  carbohydrate-, hydroxy- and alkoxy-substituted silicones.<br>
Preferably, the functionalised silicone contains multiple substitutions.<br>
20  By functionalised silicone is meant a polymer or oligomer with a backbone consisting essentially of polydialkylsiloxane monomers, preferably polydimethylsiloxane monomers, wherein the alkyl groups have been partially substituted by functional organic groups.<br>
25<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, as regards hydroxyl-substituted silicones, a polydimethylsiloxane merely having hydroxyl end groups (which ha^r.e, ..the ..GTF&amp;. designation- d±m.ethicoriol) Is r.ot considered a functionalised silicone within the present<br>
3 0  invention.  However, a polydimethylsiloxane having hydroxyl<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
substitutions along the polymer chain is considered a functionalised silicone.<br>
Preferred functionalised silicones are amino-functionalised 5  silicones.  Suitable amino functionalised silicones are described in EP 455,185 (Helene Curtis) and include trimethylsilylamodimethicone as depicted below: Si(CH3)3 - 0 - [Si(CH3)2 - 0 - ]x - [Si (CH3) (R - Nff - Rx NH2) - 0 -]y - Si (CH3)3 10<br>
wherein x + y is a number from about 50 to about 500 and wherein R is an alkylene group having from 2 to 5 carbon<br>
atoms and Ri is a second alkylene group having from 2 to 4<br>
carbon atoms.  Preferably, the number z + y is in the range 15  of from about 100 to about 300.<br>
As expressed here, the weight percent amine functionality is measured by titrating a sample of the amino-functionalised silicone against alcoholic hydrochloric acid to the 20  bromocresol green end point.  The weight % amine is<br>
calculated using a molecular weight of 45 (corresponding to<br>
CH3- CH2-NH2).<br>
Suitably, the weight percent amine functionality measured 25  and calculated in this way is from 0.3% to 8%, preferably from 0.5% to 4%.<br>
An example of a commercially available amino-fuTicrtionalised silicone useful in the silicone component of the composition 30  of the invention is DCS220 available from Dow Corning, which<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
has a viscosity of 150 mm2 s-1  at 25 °C and a weight percent amine functionality of 2.0%.<br>
Hydrocarbon oil<br>
5<br>
The hydrocarbon oil is present in the mixture droplets at a level of at least 5 percent by weight, preferably at least 15 percent by weight more preferably at least 2 0 percent by weight and most preferably at least 3 0% by weight based on 10  the total weight of the mixture droplets.<br>
Suitably, the hydrocarbon oil has a viscosity at 25°C of<br>
2-1	2-1<br>
less than 500 mm s  , preferably less than 3 00 mm s  , more<br>
2 -l preferably less than 200 mm s and most preferably less than<br>
2 -l 15  50 mm s<br>
t<br>
Hydrocarbon oils include cyclic hydrocarbons, straight chain aliphatic hydrocarbons (saturated or unsaturated), and branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbons (saturated or 2 0  unsaturated).  The hydrocarbon oils will preferably contain from 12 to 60 carbon atoms.  Also suitable are polymeric<br>
hydrocarbons of alkenyl monomers, such as C2-C6 alkenyl<br>
monomers.  These polymers can be straight or branched chain polymers.  The straight chain polymers will typically be 25  relatively short in length, having a total number of carbon atoms as described above for straight chain hydrocarbons in general.. .The branched, chain polymers can have substantially higher chain length.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
Specific examples of suitable hydrocarbon oils include paraffin oil, mineral oil, saturated and unsaturated dodecane, saturated and unsaturated tridecane, saturated and unsaturated tetradecane, saturated and unsaturated 5  pentadecane, saturated and unsaturated hexadecane, and mixtures thereof.  Branched-chain isomers of these compounds, as well as of higher chain length hydrocarbons, can also be used.  Exemplary branched-chain isomers are highly branched saturated or unsaturated alkanes, such as<br>
10  the permethyl-substituted isomers, e.g., the permethyl-<br>
substituted isomers of hexadecane and eicosane, such as 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8-dimethyl-10-methylundecane and 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6-dimethyl-8-methylnonane, sold by Permethyl Corporation.  A further example of a hydrocarbon polymer is<br>
15  polybutene, such as the copolymer of isobutylene and butene. A commercially available material of this type is L-14 polybutene from Amoco Chemical Co. (Chicago, 111., U.S.A.).<br>
Particularly preferred hydrocarbon oils are the various 20  grades of mineral oils.  Mineral oils are clear oily liquids obtained from petroleum oil, from which waxes have been removed, and the more volatile fractions removed by distillation.  The fraction distilling between 250°C  to 300°C is termed mineral oil, and it consists of a mixture of 25  hydrocarbons ranging from C16H34 to C21H44.  Suitable<br>
commercially available materials of this type include Sirius M85 and Sirius M45, available from Silkolerie (Tradema.rk) .<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
Mixture Droplets<br>
In compositions according to the invention, the mixture droplets form a separate, discontinuous phase from the 5  continuous phase of the hair treatment composition. Generally, the continuous phase of the hair treatment composition will be water-continuous.<br>
In order for the mixture droplets to remain stable as 10  discrete droplets over time, it is preferred if the functionalised silicone and the hydrocarbon oil are insoluble in the continuous phase of the hair treatment composition.<br>
15  In a preferred form of the invention, the continuous phase of the hair treatment composition will be water-based and the hydrocarbon oil and functionalised silicone will be water-insoluble.  In this case, the mixture droplets will be dispersed in the composition as the oil droplets of an oil-<br>
2	0  in-water emulsion.<br>
The mixture droplets may be liquid, semi-solid or solid in nature, so long as they are substantially uniformly dispersed in the fully formulated product.  The mixture 25  droplets are preferably present as either liquid or semi¬solid droplets, more preferably as liquid droplets.<br>
The D3,2 "average droplet size of the mixture droplets is<br>
preferably greater than 0.05 micrometre, more preferably at<br>
3	0  least 0.5 micrometre, most preferably at least 1 micrometre.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
Additionally, the D3,2 average droplet size of the mixture<br>
droplets is no greater than 2 5 micrometres, preferably no greater than 20 micrometres, more preferably no greater than 15 micrometres.  It should be noted that suitable droplet<br>
5  size ranges include any maximum D3,2 average droplet size<br>
associated with any minimum D3,2 average droplet size.  A<br>
preferred range is from 0.05 to 25 micrometres, more preferably from 0.5 to 20 micrometres, most preferably from 1 to 15 micrometres. 10<br>
Methods for measuring the D3,2 average droplet size  are well<br>
known to those skilled in the art, and may require dilution of the composition prior to measurement.  One suitable method is by means of a laser light scattering technique, 15  using a 2600D Particle Sizer from Malvern Instruments.<br>
It is a highly preferred aspect of the invention that the mixture droplets be in the form of the discontinuous phase of an aqueous oil-in-water emulsion which may itself be<br>
20  added to the hair treatment composition during manufacture. Preferably, the aqueous emulsion is mechanically-formed.  In such emulsions, it is preferable that the emulsion additionally includes at least one emulsifier in order to stabilise the emulsion.<br>
25<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method for incorporating discrete droplets comprising both a functionalised silicone and a hydrocarbon oil in. the same droplets, into a hair treatment composition, comprising the<br>
3 0  steps of;<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
i)   forming an intimate, non-aqueous blend<br>
comprising the functionalised silicone and the hydrocarbon oil,<br>
ii)  preparing an aqueous emulsion comprising droplets comprising both a functionalised silicone and a hydrocarbon oil in the same droplets and<br>
i)   mixing said aqueous emulsion with the hair treatment composition.<br>
10<br>
Suitable emulsifiers for use in the preparation of the aqueous emulsion are well known in the art and include anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, amphoteric and nonionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof.  Examples of anionic<br>
15  surfactants used as emulsifiers for the silicone particles are alkylarylsulphonates, e.g., sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, alkyl sulphates e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, alkyl ether sulphates, e.g., sodium lauryl ether sulphate nEO, where n is from 1 to 20 alkylphenol ether sulphates,<br>
20  e.g., octylphenol ether sulphate nEO where n is from 1 to 20, and sulphosuccinates, e.g., sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate.<br>
Examples of nonionic surfactants used as ernulsifiers for the 25  silicone particles are alkylphenol ethoxylates, e.g.,<br>
nonylphenol ethoxylate nEO, where n is from 1 to 50 and alcohol ethoxylates, e.g., lauryl alcohol nEO, where n is from 1 to 50, ester ethoxylates, e.g., polyoxyethylene monostearate where the number of oxyethylene units is from 1 30  to 30.<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
It is preferred if the emulsifier is blended into the oil phase prior to the formation of the aqueous emulsion of the mixture droplets.<br>
5  A preferred process for preparing aqueous emulsions of the mixture droplets which can then be incorporated in the hair treatment compositions involves use of a high-shear mixer. Suitable mixers should be capable of handling high viscosity liquids at low temperatures.  Preferably, the mixer is a<br>
0 hollow cylinder or bowl-shaped and comprises a centrally-mounted, rotatable shaft carrying thereon tools or blades which rotate with the shaft.<br>
Suitably, the clearance of the tips of the tools or blades 5  from the wall of the mixer is relatively small, e.g. less than 2 0 mm, preferably less than 15 mm, more preferably less than 10 mm.  The speed of rotation of the shaft will vary depending on the dimensions of the mixer but will typically be in the region of 100-1200 rpm. 0<br>
Preferably, the mixer is also capable of having the temperature of mixing controlled, e.g. it comprises a jacket through which a heat transfer fluid can be circulated.<br>
5  In order to obtain an intimate blend of the functionalised silicone and the hydrocarbon oil in the mixture droplets, it is highly preferred that both components should be liquid at the temperature at which mixing and emulsification takes place.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>

The total amount of anionic cleansing surfactant in shampoo compositions of the invention is generally from 5 to 30, preferably from 6 to 20, more preferably from 8 to 18 wt%.<br>
5  The shampoo composition can optionally include co-surfactants, to help impart aesthetic, physical or cleansing properties to the composition.<br>
A preferred example is an amphoteric or zwitterionic 10  surfactant, which can be included in an amount ranging from 0 to about 8, preferably from 1 to 4 percent by weight of the composition.<br>

15  to about 2 000 000 unified atomic mass units.  The polymers will have cationic nitrogen containing groups such as quaternary ammonium or protonated amino groups or a mixture thereof.<br>
2 0  The cationic nitrogen-containing group will generally be<br>
present as a substituent on a fraction of the total monomer units of the deposition polymer.  Thus when the polymer is not a homopolymer it can contain spacer non-cationic monomer units.  Such polymers are described in the CTFA Cosmetic<br>
2	5  Ingredient Directory, 3rd edition.  The ratio of the cationic<br>
to non-cationic monomer units is selected to give a polymer having a cationic charge density in the required range.<br>

The propellant gas can be any liquefiable gas conventionally 10  used for aerosol containers.  Examples of suitable<br>
propellants include dimethyl ether, propane, n-butane and isobutane, used singly or in admixture.<br>
The amount of the propellant gases is governed by normal 15  factors well known in the aerosol art.  For hair mousses, the level of propellant is generally from 3 to 30, preferably from 5 to 15 percent by weight of the total composition.<br>
20  Small quantities of surfactant ranging anywhere from 0.1 to 10, preferably from 0.1 to about 1, for example 0.3 percent by weight of the composition may be present in the hair mousse compositions of the invention.  The surfactant may be an anionic, nonionic or cationic emulsifier.  Particularly<br>
25  preferred are nonionic emulsifiers which are formed from alkoxylation of hydrophobes such as fatty alcohols, fatty acids and phenols.<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
