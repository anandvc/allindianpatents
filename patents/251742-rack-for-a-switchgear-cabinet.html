				<td>The invention relates to a rack for a switchgear cabinet assembled frorr. frame members which form in the base area of the switchgear cabinet a base frame surrounding an cpeng closable by means of base plates, said frame being connectable with or connected to a plinth<br>
The rack for a switchgear cabinet as a rule consists of twelve identical frame members as shown by 32 33  44 598 <br>
01 in this case, increasing demands are made of the frams members with respect to the possibilities of     fitting cut the inner space and sealing the wail elements and the cabinet dear; this requires an expensive frame profile.  in these known racks, the base frame is also constructed from four complex frame members, although as a rule in this area only base plates with cable  inlets<br>
must close off the lower opening of the switchgear<br>
connected to the base frame, upon which the. base plates<br>
lie and are secured  This complex base frame requires a<br>
iarga amount of space, which in most oases is lost as<br>
installation space for the switchgear cabinet.  In<br>
addition, the known base frame with the support profiles<br>
members the rack and thus the switchgear cabinet more<br>
expensive.  it is the object of the invention to provide<br>
a rack of the type already mentioned, whose base frame<br><br>
can be manufactured in a more cost-effective way, which requires less installation space in the switchcear cabinet and can be used in a simple way for securing the base plates.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention in that the bass frame is assembled from four U-profile sections out to length and four square corner pieces, the U-profile sections being open in an upward direction, having an outer edge bent up at right angles and an L-shaped inner edge aligned towards the outer edge, while the corner pieces cover the U-profile sections abutting on one another with attachment flanges, and ara   connected thereto, and in that the corner pieces abut with an inwardly lying corner angle on the inner sides of the inner edges of the U-profile sections abutting on one another and complete the outer edge of the base frame with an outwardly-lying external angle in the corner areas.<br>
The u-profile sections are extremely simple and have only a small constructive height.  The corner pieces are simple stamped and bent parts and supplement "he base frame to form a closed unit.  The L-shaped inner edge affords the opportunity of simple support and attachment for the base plates.<br>
The connection between the U-profiie section and the corner pieces is according to one development such that the attachment, flanges of the corner pieces are offset upwards, and cover the U-profile sections abutting one another in the area of their base arms, and are welded<br>
If, according to one development, the corner pieces are provided in their square base plates with attachment receiving means, then the base frame can be screwed in a simple way to the plinth Of the switch-gear cabinet.<br>
The connection between the base frame and the vertical frame members of the rack is provided according to one development in such a way that the corner pieces carry upwardly aligned connecting flanges for attachment of the vertical frame members of the rack.<br>
A simple opportunity of attachment for the base plates is provided in that the end sections of the L-shaped inner edges form support edges for support sections of base plates, and in that the base places are secured by means of U-shaped clamps provided with clamp screws to the L-shapsd inner edges of the U-profile sections.<br>
The base opening of the rack can be subdivided in that the inner edge oÂ£ the bass frame is provided on sides<br>
opposed to one another with receiving means aligned to one another for a secondary rail section, upon which partial base plates are supported and secured.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a rack for a switchgear cabinet, which is constructed from frame members which form a base frame surrounding an opening closable by means of a base plate, said base frame being connectable with or connected to a plinth, characterised in that<br>
the base frame is constructed from four U-profile sections cut to length and four square corner pieces, the U-profile sections being open in an upward direction, and having an outer edge bent upwards at right angles, and an L-shaped inner edge aligned towards the outer edge, while the corner pieces cover the U-profile sections abutting one another with attachment flanges, and are connected thereto, and in that the corner pieces lie with an inwardly-lying corner angle on the inner sides of the inner edges of the U-profile sections abutting on one another, and, with an outwardly-lying outer angle in the corner areas, complete the outer edge of the base frame.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be described in more detail with reference to two embodiments given by way of example and shown in perspective in the drawings.  Shown are:<br>
Figure 1: a square base frame, which can be closed by means of base plates, and<br>
Figure 2: a rectangular base frame, which is subdivided by means of a secondary rail into two areas closable by means of base plates, a" cable inlet being provided in one area.<br>
As Figure 1 shows, a square base frame 10 according to the invention is constructed from four equal-length U-profile sections 11 and four square corner pieces 20. The U-profile sections 11 are provided in Figure 1 with an upwardly-aligned outer edge 12 and with an L-shaped inner edge 13,14, the end section 14 of the inner 3dge being aligned towards the outer edge 12, and forming a support for support edges 41 of base plates 40.<br>
The corner pieces 20 have a square base panel 21 with attachment receiving means 21a.  Upwardly-aligned corner<br>
angles 22 and 23 are bent onto the base panel 21, the inwardly-lying corner angle 23 being applied to the inner<br>
sec-ions 11 abutting on one another, while the outwardiy-tying corner angle 22 completes the outes adge 12 in the associated corner area of the base frame 10.  Attached to the base panel 21 are attachment flanges 24 and 25, which are offset upwards relative to the base panel 21 by the thickness of the base leg of the U-profile sections 11, so that said attachment flanges extend over the base panel and can be connected thereto.  Thus the attachment flanges 24 and  25 are preferably welded, e.g. spct-weided to the U-profiie sections 11.<br>
Tf the base plates 40 are strengthened by angled edges 42 at the sides standing vertically to the support, edges 41, then these edges 42 are left open in the area of the. support edges 41.  The base frame 10 is open towards the top and can be screwed to a plinth via the attachment receiving means 21a of the corner pieces 20.<br>
As Figure 1 shows, upwardiy-aiigned connecting lianges 20 and 27 with attachment bores 2 3 and 2 3 can also be attached to the corner pieces 20, and the vertical frame members of the rack can be securely screwed to said bores.  The rack then forms a unit with the base frame 10.<br>
The base plates 40 lie with the support edges 41 on the end sections 14 of the inner edge of the base frame 10. U-shaped clamps 43 accommodate the end section 14 and the support adge 41, and both are clamped in the clamp 4 3 by means of a clamp screw 44.<br>
As shown in the embodiment according to Figure 2, the base frame 10 can also be rectangular, a subdivision being undertaken in the longitudinal direction.  For this purpose receiving means 51 are opened out in the inner edge 11,12 on sides racing one another, said receiving means accommodating a secondary rail section 5C in a flush manner, which also forms support adges for part base planes 40' .  These part base plates 40' lie with support edges 42 on the end section 14 of the inner edge and on the secondary rail section Â£C and arc secured thereto by means of U-shaped clamps 43.<br>
The part base plates 40' can be aligned towards one another with seal edges 45, which carry seal strips 46 formed from plastic foam material blocks, arc are formed as a cable inlet.  Drawn off from the sea_ strip 46 are protective strips 47, so that they can be connected by the exposed adhesive layer to rhe seal edges 45 of the part base plates 40'.<br>
The base frame 10 can also be further subdivided by a plurality of secondary rail sections 50.  Moreover, in this way a pluralley of cable inlets can also be provided in the base area in 'his way.<br>
The outer edge and the inner edge of the base frame 10 is aliened upwards and has a small constructive height, so that the base frame occupies only a small negligible proportion, of a predetermined cabinet heigh" .  Moreover, the new base frame 10 offers direct opportunities Of attachment and subdivision for base plates.  The base frame 10 is simple in construction and  may be manufactured cost-effectively, as only simple stamped and bent parts are necessary as corner pleces 20, apart from the 0-profile sections 11 cut to length.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
