CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]    The present invention claims the benefit of priority from U S Patent Application No 10/780,039, filed February 17, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]    This invention relates in general to the field of power management  More particularly, this invention relates to a system and method of controlling power usage by individual components within a computing device in order to reduce acoustic emissions to simulate an OFF condition while remaining in an ON state to run applications<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]   As the functionality of PCs begins to converge with that of consumer electronics (CE) devices such as personal-video recording (e g , digital video recorders (DVR), eHome PCs, etc), PCs will likely move from locations such as the den or home office into the living room, so they can be connected to a home entertainment center (e g, TV, stereo receiver, set-top box, etc)  This move creates a challenge for the PC, in that users will expect very high reliability and ease of use, similar to CE devices  Expectations for PCs have historically been much lower than CE devices because PCs have been difficult to use and prone to stability problems that have to do with both hardware and software   Thus, to succeed in the CE space, the PC must behave more like an appliance and less like a conventional PC<br>
[0004]    PCs also differ significantly from CE devices with regard to powering ON and OFF Conventionally, to be instantly available from an off state, the PC is placed into a low-power standby state (ACPI S3)  Typically, this low-power state enables the PC to power on in less than two seconds  However, while the PC is in the low-power state, the only action it can perform is waking the system to a fully "on" state (ACPI SO) such that we PC may perform other functions  In addition, the latency between S3 and "on" depends on many factors, both hardware and software  Although it might take less than two seconds to power on one time, it might take five or seven seconds the next For this reason, the PC low-power standby state cannot provide the mstant-on behavior that users expect from a CE device<br><br>
[0005]    Thus, there is a need for an improved system for restoring a PC to a fully "on" state from a reduced power state, wherein the PC may perform certain functions in the reduce power state  The present invention provides such a solution<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]    The present invention is directed to systems and methods for providing a simulated off condition in a computing device  In accordance with a first aspect, there is provided a method of creating a simulated off condition in a computing device via a set of software extensions  The method includes providing a device driver for each component to be managed, providing a policy driver to coordinate information from device drwers to determine a power state of the computing device, receiving a signal to change the power state of the computing device, and instructing system components to change their respective power states in accordance with the signal   If the signal is representative of a request to enter a low power state, the power consumption of the system components are reduced such that the computing device enters a simulated off state  However, the computing system remains at a fully on and system components remain enabled to run applications when the computing device is in the simulated off condition If the signal is representative to a request to enter a fully on power state, then the system is returned to the fully on power state<br>
[0007]    In accordance with features of the invention, human interface devices are locked by discarding inputs, and a predefined input sequence may be detected that represents the signal noted above  In addition, the policy may periodically poll each device driver for state information Also, a system service may be provided that instructs processors within the system to clock-down to a lowest state, discontinues a display signal to turn off a monitor, reduces a power supply output, turns off cooling fans, and indicates that the computing device is in the simulated off condition<br>
[0008]    In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a computing device having a simulated off state  The device includes a power supply having a power supply heat sink having a first fin onentation matching a direction airflow through the power supply and first cross-cuts to induce airflow turbulence, a central proce-sing unli having a CPU heat sink having a bi-metallic outer portion and base, a graphics processing unit having a GPU heat sink having a second fin onentation matching a direction airflow over the graphics processing unit and second cross-cuts to induce airflow turbulence, a hard disk dnve, and a random access memory When the computing device is powered down, the computing device is placed into the simulated off state by placing the system components<br>
into a low power state such that the computing device appears to be off In accordance with this aspect of the invention, the computing device remains enabled to run applications when in the simulated off state<br>
[0009]    In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of producing a simulated off condition in a computing device when the computing device is in an ACPI SO state  The method includes providing a device driver for each component to be managed, providing a policy driver to coordinate information from device drivers to determine a power state of the computing device, receiving a signal to change the power state of the computing device, and instructing system components to change their respective power states in accordance with the signal   If the signal is representative of a request to entei a low power state, the power consumption of the system components is reduced using ACPI methods such that the computing device enters a simulated off state The computing system remains at a fully on and system components remain enabled to run applications when the computing device is in the simulated off condition  However, if the signal is representative to a request to enter a fully on power state, the system components are returned to the fully on power state using ACPI methods<br>

[0027]    Computer 110 typically includes a variety of computer readable media Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer 110 and includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media  By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may compnse computer storage media and communication media   Computer storage media includes both volaa'e and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data  Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disKS (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can accessed by computer 110 Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules oi other data in a modulated data signal such as a carner wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media  The term "modulated data signal" means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal   By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media   Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media<br>
[0028]    The system memory 130 includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and/or non-volatile memory such as ROM 131 and RAM 132   A basic input/output system 133 (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer 110, such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM 131 RAM<br>
132 typically contains data and/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and/or presently being operated on by processing unit 120  By way of example, and not limitation, Fig 1 illustrates operating system 134, application programs 135, other program modules 136, and program data 137<br>
[0029J    The computer 110 may also include othei removable/non-removable, volatile/non-volatile computer storage media By way of example only, Fig 1 illustrates a hard disk dnve 141 that reads from or writes to non-removable, non-volatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk dnve 151 that reads from or wntes to a removable, non-volatile magnetic disk 152, and an optical disk dnve 155 that reads from or writes to a removable, non-volatile optical disk 156, such as a CD-ROM or other optical media  Other removable/non¬removable, volatile/non-volatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like  The hard disk dnve 141 is typically connected to the system bus 121 through a non¬removable memory interface such as interface 140, and magnetic disk drive i51 and optical disk drive 155 are typically connected to the system bus 121 by a removable memory interface, such as interface 150<br>

[0033]    Exemplary Embodiments of the Always Ready Computing Device<br>
[0034]    Modern PC operating systems, such as WINDOWS XP at ailable from Microsoft Corp , Redmond, WA, have the ability to control the amount of power that certain components of the system draw through Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) methods   Such components include, but are not limited to, the CPU, graphics processor (GPU), monitor, hard disk dnves, power supplies, cooling fans, eto   This has the benefit of reducing power utilization to make the system more energy efficient, while also reducing acoustic emissions from cooling fans  Particularly, the largest noise contributors in PCs today are the cooling fans, including CPU fans, GPU fans, power supply fans, and system case fans   As devices draw less power and emit less heat, the need to actively dissipate heat through fans is reduced, thus lowering acoustic emissions   In order for PCs to<br>
gain acceptance in the living room, these sources of noise will need to be significantly reduced<br>
[0035]   The present invention is directed to a PC system having a "smart off state (a simulated off state) wherein the PC remains in an "on" state (ACPI SO) while appearing fo the user to be "off" In accordance with the present invention, when the power button ("smart off power button") on a PC is pressed (either on the system case, through a remote control, or keyboard or mouse action), the system registers the "off event and instead of signaling the operating system to enter an ACPI state (e g, S1, S3, S4 or S5) other than the current running state (SO), a series of power management triggers are set to power down system components such as the CPU, GPU, monitor, fans, etc through custom software and ACPI methods Thus, the PC is "always on" and ready to perform tasks Alternatively, the present invention may first enter the "smart off state, and then after a predetermined perod of time, transition to S3   In this case, when some event occurs (e g, the PC is tasked as a PVR, etc), the system wakes from S3 to "smart off (1 e, the monitor is off, audio is muted, etc) and performs the task and then returns to S3 after a period of inactivity<br>
[0036]    This technique makes for a system that is unobtrusive and appears "off in many ways while being able to process low intensity tasks   The system may turn itself back "on" as needed to accomplish higher intensity tasks   For example, if the user turned the PC off, but scheduled a TV program to be recorded at a predetermined time while at the same time another user is streaming media from the PC, the PC may turn itself back "on" to     provide the processing power and cooling necessary to accomplish these tasks  The system covld then be programmed to turn itself back "off after the task has completed<br>
[0037]    In accordance with the present invention, five "pseudo-off states witnin SO are contemplated, as follows<br>
[0038]    (1) On with user interaction  This state is when the user is interacting with the system by watching TV, playing music, watching a DVD, etc   This could also include any other typical PC use such as word processing or internet browsing<br>
[0039]    (2) Smart Off As noted above, this state is entered when the user is finished with their entertainment or computing experience and presses the "off button on the PC  The PC remains in the SO state, but all devices are clocked down, all cooling fans are stopped, input devices such as mice and keyboards are locked, etc , indicating io the user that the device is off Because of the reduced clocking, the system is in a lower powei state than in itate (1) and able to be cooled via passive cooling<br>
 [0040]    (3) Smart Off with user interaction  In this state, the user is aole perform certain tasks on the PC without fully "waking" from Smart Off to state (1)   Fcr example, "Smart Off provides enough processing power to carry ou+ music playback  It may be preferable that user is able to play audio on their PC without the fans oi monitor turning on In this instance, the PC may include a front-panel display similar to those used on DVD/CD players to indicate what track is playing, time remaining, etc<br>
[0041]    (4) On without user interaction  This state is entered, for example, after the PC was in state (2), but was required to return to state (1) without the screen coming back on For example, this state could be entered when the system is tasked to record a TV show that requires full CPU or GPU processing (e g, a personal video recorder (PVR))   This state results in higher acoustic emissions from fans than state (2), but lower acoustic emissions that state (1)<br>
[0042]    (5) Active Smart Off This state is similar to state (1), however, the processing workload is small enough that the PC can handle it while remaining in state (2) In this state, the PC processes tasks without turning on the fans and continues to appear off even though it is processing instructions   It is also possible that the PVR scenario noted in the descnption of state (4) could be accomplished in this state  It may be desirable to light an LED so the user can visually confirm that the task is being accomplished with the PC "off," similar to a VCR lighting up a light indicating that a show is being recoided<br>
[0043]    From any of the SO states noted above, the user will be able to completely shut down the system to S5 / G3 state as well    This may be implemented with a second power button or "off switch" (e g, at the rear of the chassis)  In addition, it may be desirable to implement a long push (e g, 4 sec) of the smart off power button to bring the system to S5/G3   Lastly, the user can still shut down the system using the Operating System's user interface controls<br>
[0044]    In accordance with the present invention, the following, non limiting list of components may be pov/ered down in the following manners to achieve lower acoustic emissions<br>
[0045]    CPU<br>
[0046]    Current CPU technology allows for regulation of frequency and voltage of the CPU during use to vary the power consumption based on system needs   For example, when video is rendered, a 3 06 GHz processor may clock-up to its full frequency and voltage to provide the highest processing power possible, which would equal roughly 90 Watts<br>
When the system is at idle, howevet, the CPU may clock-down to a much lov/er voltage and frequency (e g, sub 800 MHz) which would then only draw approximately 10-35 Watts<br>
[0047]    Conventional cooling solutions for CPUs are designed to cool for the highest power possible at all times, so unnecessarily high acoustic emissions result during lower power operations  However, in accordance with the present invention, a heat sink is used for the CPU that may passively cool 35 Watts, or whatever wattage results from the clocked-down frequency the CPU supports, thus the CPU fan may turn completely off when the smart off power button is pressed<br>
[0048]    GPU<br>
[0049]    In much in the same way as a CPU, the cooling solution for most graphics adapters is designed for the highest power utilization scenarios, whether the adapters are discrete or integrated  By implementing the same technique as descnbed for CPUs above, the GPU fan can be turned off when the smart off power button is pressed  In addition to turning off the GPU fan, the video signal may also be immediately removed to provide the appearance on the display that the device is off<br>
[0050]    System Case Fans<br>
[0051]    System case fans are employed to reduce the ambient temperature of the system chassis, which helps to maximize the effectiveness of component fans as well as provide airflow for passively cooled devices in the system  Depending on system load, these fans can be turned off or driven at a very slow speed, which would produce acoustic emissions below the human threshold of hearing<br>
[0052]    Hard Disk Dnves<br>
[0053]    Hard disk drive technology has improved to the point where acoustic emissions outside of the PC chassis are not perceptible, however, it is possible to spin down the dnve based on inactivity  It is pieferable that hard dnves continue to spin while the PC is in the smart off state such that the PC will be able perform background functions such as updated system code or downloading media content from a cable feed or the Internet<br>
[0054]    Power Supply<br>
[0055]    By employing the solutions descnbed earlier, the load on the power supply will decrease significantly when the components in the system are placed in lower power states  By reducing the load on the power supply, passive heat sinks of an appropnate size may be used to cool the power supply such that the power supply far may be turned off dunng the lower power state<br>
 [0056]    In accordance with the present invention the preferred implementation uses software drivers that control the frequency and voltage of the CPU using existing ACPI methods   Similarly, the GPU is controlled through a defined API to throttle down the GPU as requested by the PC operating system   Software dnvers may be used to control other components, such as fans and the power supply, etc<br>
[0057]    The communication protocol used in a prefened implementation is SMBus (Systems Management Bus Interface), which utilizes an existing microcontroller in a power supply As shown in Fig 2, through an SMBus Interface 200, various components, including a SMBus system host 202, power supply 204 and other devices 206 can communicate to control the system host fan, buttons, and LEDs   The SMBus interface is described in the "System Management Bus (SMBus) Specification," Version 2 0, August 3, 2000, published by the SBS Implementers Forum, which is incorporated herein by reterence in its entirety<br>
[0058]    The power supply 204 may consist of a power supply unit that converts AC to DC, a battery, and an integral battery chargei   The power supply 204 monitors particular environmental parameters to provide adequate information for power management and charge control legardless of the particular power supply unit's size, or the size and chemistry of the battery  The host 110 to power supply 204 communication is used to get data that is either presented to a user or to the host's 110 power management system  The user may obtain two types of data from the power supply factual and predictive  Factual data can be measured, such as temperature or battery charge/discharge state, or it can be a battery charactenstic, such as the battery's chemistry  Predictive data is calculated, based on the PSU's and battery's present state<br>
[0059]    In accordance with the present invention, the power management system may query a device driver to determine if an action will cause harm to the system's mtegnty For example, spinning up a disk drive while the power supply 204 is at maximum load may cause its output voltage to drop below acceptable limits, thus causing a system failure  In order to prevent this, the device driver needs information from the power supply that will yield desirable results   If the driver queues the power supply 204 and discovers that not enough power is available, it can then request that the power management system turn otf a non-oritical pow er use or change the power/performance operating point of system components<br>
[0060]    The power supply 204 has me ability to inform the host 110 of potentially critical conditions These notifications repiesent an effort on the part of the power supply 204<br>
to inform the host 110 that power is about to fail 01 that the battery charge is low  The power supply 204 expects that the user or host 110 will take the appropriate corrective action  Such critical notifications may originate from the power supply 204 using an SMBAlert to signal the host 110 that the power supply 204 state has changed<br>
[0061]    Alternatively, the CPU frequency and voltage may be controlled through a hardware mechanism involving microcode in a microcontroller (such as a system BIOS) This could be triggered by the power supply using a control protocol (e g, SMBus or other control protocol) to notify the CPU to change frequency and voltage based on an event of loss of AC power and/or the presence of DC power (battery power)  This implementation does not rely on ACPI and is completely HW/firmware based<br>
[0062]    Refemng now to Figs 3 and 4, theie are illustrated flow charts of the<br>
transitions between various pseudo-off states within APCI SO described above  At step 300,<br>
the PC is at a fully "on" state, described above as State (1)   At step 302, the user has<br>
completed his/her interaction with the PC and presses the smart off power button on the PC<br>
At step 304 the system determines if any active applications require full processing power<br>
and notifies the user (step 306) that actions will be canceled if the system is turned off At<br>
step 308 the user may cancel the actions noted at step 306, where the process returns to step<br>
304, or may choose not to cancel the actions, where the PC returns to step 300 and remains in<br>
the full on state	<br>
[0063]    If at step 304 the active application do not require full processing power then at step 310, system components are notified of a low power request  Next, at sttp 312, the CPU clocks-down to the lowest state and the CPU fan is stopped   At step 314, the GPU turns off, the fan is stopped and the video signal is cut  At step 316, the HDD may flush the cache and spin down to further reduce power consumption  At step 318, the system case fan stops and then the power supply output is decreased and the fan stops at step 320  At step 322, the power button (or case LED) indicates an off state (I e , Smart Off) such that the PC appears off (step 324)<br>
[0064]    Fig 4 illustrates the process of returning to a fully on state when the system is in the smart off state (step 326)  At step 328, it is determined if there is an application that requires more power   Such applications may be scheduled or triggered by user interaction   If no applications lequire more power, then the process returns to step 236   If there are applications that require additional power, then at step 330, the power supply fan turns on, followed by the system case fan at step 332  At step 334, the hard drie spins up and then the GPU and its fan turn on at step 336   At step 338, the CPU clocks-up and it fan turns on  At<br>
step 340, the power button then indicates that the PC is on, where by the PC is now at a fully<br>
on state (step 342)	«.<br>
[0065]    Tig 5 illustrates an exemplary graph of power consumption versus APCI /Smart Off state   When the PC is in APCI SO state, the vanous components within the PC are allowed to run at full power  Thus, the power consumption of the PC is relatively high, ranging from approximately 50 Watts to over 200 Watts  However, v/hen the user initiates the Smart Off, power consumption is aggressively managed to limit consumption to a threshold value, e g, 60 Watts (or other amount that can be passively cooled)   When in the Smart Off state, the PC remains in SO and the components are managed such that the total consumption remains below the threshold value  The PC is able to perform processing tasks in this state  When in the Smart Off state, the PC attempts to curtail power betow the threshold, while meeting application processing demands   Should the PC be tasked to ron applications that require more processing than is possible under the power restrictions of the Smart Off state, the PC components are powered-up and active cooling components reenergized  The PC is thus returned to a full on (SO) state  However, if the user requests that the PC enter other APCI states (S3, S4/S5), power consumption is further reduced and the PC is unable to perform any processing tasks<br>
[0066]    An exemplary hardware implementation of an Always Ready Computing Device in accordance with the present invention will now be descnbed  The computing system preferably runs MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP, or higher  A system that implements the Always Ready feature includes a Human In'erface Device (HID)-comphant sleep button on the front of the computing device 100, a remote control, and optionally the Keyboard 162 For the purposes of this document, the HID-comphant sleep button will be referred to as the "Smart Off button " The Smart Off button is primarily responsible for transitioning tht system 100 to Smart Off from SO, and to SO from Smart Off In addition, the Smart Off button on the front of the device 100, and optionally on the remote control, can bring the system from the S5 or S4 state to SO<br>
[0067]    The following describes how the Smart Off button may be implemented in an Always Ready system, and how it may differ from a conventional HID sleep button  A dedicated USB header is exposed on the motherboard for connecting the USB port to the Smart Off button  To implement this solution, a low cost USB microcontroller may be programmed to be a HID device, supporting the Smart Off function  The USB microcontroller necessary to run the Smart Off button is programmed as a HID device and to send the HID usage code, used for power management  Because Always Ready uses<br>
loaded   Once the Always Ready ACPI driver is loaded for the new device, it sends an IOCTL to ACPI SYS to run the ARDY control method<br>
[0072]    The name and hardware ID of the device to be created in the ACPI namespace, as well as an exemplary ARDY control method is as follows<br>
// Define smart off device Device(\_SB SOFF){<br>
Name(_HID, "ARiOOOl")  // Always Ready device<br>
Method(ARDY, 1){<br>
// Add control method here<br>
} }<br>
[0073]    A Light Emitting Diode (LED) which communicates the active power state of the system should also be able to represent the Smart Off state in addition to all of the supported ACPI power states   The connection of the LED to a Smart Off compliant system is physically connected the same way as a power LED to support an ACPI fixed power bu'ton However, two LEDs may be necessary for the system if both an ACPI fixed power button in addition to the Smart Off button is piesent on the system System state for each of these LEDs should match at all times, regardless of system state<br>
[0074]    The Smart Off button LED utilizes the System Status object C_SST) as defined in the ACPI namespace, to properly indicate whether the system is in the Smart Off state or not   When the ARDY control method is executed (thereby indicating that the system is transitioning to Smart Off), the BIOS should change the _SST object from the working state of "1" to the sleeping state of "3"  When this control method is run again to wake the system from the Smart Off state, the value of the JSST object should be changed back to the working state of "1"<br>
[0075]    The Power Supply used with the Always Ready computing device can range in implementation as long as the acoustics requirements noted above, l e , the fans may be stopped when the device is in the Smart Off state  Many system factors should be taken into consideration for the power supply such as power draw, component layout, chassis design, as well as the selection of system components such as the CPU and graphics card  While these factois will vary from system to system, the following areas are considered wnen choosing, or designing a power supply for an Always Ready computing device fan control, heat c nk design, and operating efficiency<br>
[0076]    Wlnle turning the fans off with Smart Off is preferred, it may be unreasonable to do so, depending on the system factors mentioned in the list above  As an alternative, it may be more leasonable to have a high level of fan control of tht power supply,<br>
enabling the fan to run at a silent speed when in the Smart Off state   Whethei the power supply fan turns off or spins a slower speed, when going into Smart Off, the control of the fan itself must be accomplished in some manner  Fan control can be accomplished by running Always Ready software on the computing device, through the BIOS, or can be managed by the power supply itself<br>
[0077]    Fan operation of a power supply is normally controlled through the power supply itself either running the fan at a predetermined speed (voltage) constantly when the PC is on, and turning the fan off when the system is sleeping or off Because an Always Ready system is in SO substantially 100% of the time, a typical power supply has no mechanism to determine when the system transitions to and from Smart Off Special modifications need to be made to a power supply that is designed to work optimally with Always Ready technology, as will now be described<br>
[0078]    Fan speed control can be exposed to the system through the FanC signal, which is defined in section 4 3 of the ATX Specification, vei sion 2 2   A General Purpose I/O (GPIO) header is exposed on the motherboard to which the FanC signal line from the power supply connects   In addition, a device driver may be used with the Always Ready policy driver to control the fan when transitioning to and from Smart Off This device driver is implemented to communicate directly with the GPIO that the FanC signal is connected to Alternatively, the GPIO to control the power supply fan can be controlled through the BIOS rather than through a device driver  Alternatively, the system designer may choose to use the MICROSOFT POWER SENSE technologies Power Supply, which provides FanC/FanM fan control<br>
[0079]    Fan speed control of the power supply may also be accomplished through the envuonmental contioller function of the motherboard's Super I/O chip  Usually, these controllers ha\e multiple fan outputs which can be used to control the fan of the power supply<br>
[0080]   It is noted that different methods for fan control of the power supply may be implemented  For example, in the event that a thermal condition arises in the power supply the power supply must also be designed to override the fan control   This is necessary because the power supply does not communicate thermal information to the system<br>
[0081]    In order foi the power supply to be silently cooled while in Smart Off, it is • necessary that the power supply heat sinks should be designed with this goai in mind. Thermal analyses indicated that the stock heat sinks provided on the power supply mam PC A.<br>
would not be adequate under either forced or natural convection conditions Additionally, these stock heat sinks were designed to fit in a much tighter enclosed area<br>
[0082]    Referring now to Fig 6, there is illustrated a power supply heat sink 40/. designed to passively dissipate the generated heat of the power load in an Ah/ays Ready computing device  The physical size of this heat sink is maximized to fit in the available space within the system enclosure, while leaving clearance for board-mounted components, wiring, and surrounding geometry  Fm orientation 404 matches the direction of prevailing airflow in through the power supply, and cross-cuts 406 help induce airflow turbulence  This heat sink is anodized in a black color to help maximize the transfer capability of radiative heat<br>
[0083]    The nature of power supply designs is such that optimum efficiency ,s achieved when the power supply is running at full load   Table 1 shows the efficiency of a power supply rated for a 200 watt DC load when running at full capacity<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 1<br>
[0084]    As indicated in Table 1, in ordei to deliver 190 85 watts of continuous DC power to the PC, the power supply is capable of an AC input of 270 watts to accommodate the loss of 79 15 watts, which is due to the power dissipation from converting AC to DC This equates to a rated efficiency of the power supply at 71% at 100% load   In contrast, when a power supply load is significantly lowered, the loss in the power supply increases<br>
Table 2 demonstrates the efficiency of a power supply rated for a 20Q watt DC load when running at 20% load<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 2<br>
[0085]    As indicated in Table 2, in order to dehvei 36 75 watts of continuous DC power to the PC, the power supply must provide an AC input of 68 watts to accommodate the loss of 31 25 watts, which is due to the power dissipation from converting AC to DC  This equates to an efficiency of 54% at 20% load  By increasing the optratmg efficiency of the power supply from 71%o (as indicated in Table 1), the loss at lower operating levels will decrease significantly  This will result in higher power sa\ ings for the end user, as well as a thermal design for the power supply that will be able to more easily accommodate passive cooling when in Smart Off<br>
[0086]    When the ARDY control method is ran to notify the BIOS that the system is tiansitioning between on and Smart Off, the BIOS can take the appropriate action to control the power supply fan, depending on the value of the ARDY control method  1 his is typically achieved through a Super I/O chip (SIO) in the system that monitors temperature mforrrfation for the CPU and system, and has multiple fan control points  The SIO chips with smaif fan control are capable of varying fan speed based on values which are configured in fan and temperature control registers<br>
[0087]    An aspect of the Always Ready design is the ability of the CPU to run at a lower frequency and voltage resulting in a lower power state when the system goes into Smart Off This ability significantly lowers the powei draw when in Smart Off, resulting in a<br>
much smaller thermal envelope for the CPU which can be dissipated passi\ely without the need to spin the fan<br>
[0088]    The CPU related hardware to design an optimized Always Ready PC are as follows a CPU that supports ACPI processoi performance control, and a custom heat sink design  A processor that supports processor performance states, as defined in section 8 3 3 of the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Specification, allows the CPU to enter a lower power consumption state  This is typically achieved through the modification of the frequency (CLK) and voltage (VDD) of the processor  Alternatively, the processor may implement stop clock throttling, as defined in section 8 11 of the ACPI specification, to increase the duty value of the clock off time of the processor  This has the same effect as lower the frequency, although the voltage is not lowered meaning power savings is not as significant as implementing processor performance control<br>
[0089]    For exemplary purposes, in an AMD ATHLON 64 processor Table 3 shows CPU temperatures, system power consumption, and CPU utilization for different scenarios when in Smart Off<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 3<br>
[0090]    Because conventional heat sinks that fit with the appropriate motherboard are designed to work under forced convection using an integrated cooling fan, these heat sinks have geometry (pins, closely spaced fins, folded sheet metal fins, and so on) that maximizes mass and surface area for best thermal conduction under forced convection conditions  However, conventional heat sinks indicated do not perform well under natural convection conditions because air tends to travel around, not thiough, the tightly spaced fins Additionally, integrally mounted fans tend to insulate the heat sink when the fan is not providing forced airflow<br>
 [0091]    Some fan-less heat sinks are available commercially, however they are fai too large to fit in the limited space available in the typical computing device  Thus, a design is required that has both good thermal performance under both natural and forced convection conditions   Such a design is shown in Fig 7<br>
[0092]    Because the design of the CPU heat sink 408 has high thermal conductivity, a copper base 410 is utilized to distribute heat away from the processor chip  However, copper is heavy, expensive, and not as easy to extmde during the manufacturing process  To minimize these drawbacks, the outer portion 412 of this heat sink design consists of aluminum fins bonded to the copper base, which provide the surface area and thermal mass lequired to dissipate heat into the air  These heat sink fins 414 are spaced lelatively far apart to allow for good conduction under natural convection situations  Additionally, the aluminum portion of this heat sink extends past the copper base to maximize thermal mass and surface area  Enclosme mlet/outlet and fan deflector geometry is also adjusted to provide the best cooling scenario under forced convection<br>
[0093]    The ideal physical size of this heat sink was determined by maximizing the size of the overall geometry to fit in the available space within the system enclosure, while leaving clearance for motherboard-mounted components and wiring  The copper base size was chosen to fit the profile and mounting hole layout specified by the AMD ATHLON 64 The thickness of this base is selected in such a way that the aluminum portion of the heat sink (mounted to the outer surface of the copper portion) could extend over the motherboard, while still clearing nearby components   This provides a simple, flat geometric transition are? allowing for simple and low-cost manufacturabihty<br>
[0094]    The finned aluminum geometry above the copper heat sink base was designed to maximize the available space above the motherboard, which provides the1 most surface area and thermal mass possible, given the overall configuration of the computing device's enclosure  Fin spacing is selected to allow standard machine tooling to cut the heat sink fins without requiring special tooling oi processes (such as EDM machining)  This design provides a high-aspect ratio fin geometry, spaced relatively far apart to provide good heat transfer under both forced and natural convection conditions, as described above Additionally, a thin cross-cut 416 was made perpendicular to the fin orientation to provide an airflow "interruption" which helps to induce airflow turbulence, hence merer sing theheat transfer capability of the heat sink<br>
[0095]    The aluminum portion of the heat sink is anodized in a black color to help maximize its radiative heat transfer capability  Black anodize has thermal emissivity which is<br>
several times greater than bare alummum This improved heat transfer efficiency is especially important when using the convection cooling mode<br>
[0096]    An Always Ready compliant system BIOS -mplements processor performance control, as defined in section 8 3 3 of the Advanced Configuration and Tower Interface Specification   This enables the Always Ready user-mode service to execute the NTPowerlnformation API to put the CPU into its lowest support P-state when going into Smart Off<br>
[0097]    CPU fan control is achieved through the notification to the system BTOS that the system has entered Smart Off by the ARDY control method  The BIOS then takes the appropnate action to turn the fan off Thermal override must be taken mto consideration, however, to ensure that even in Smart Off, that CPU temperature does not rise to levels beyond the manufacturer's recommended limit   This functionality is typically achieved through a Super I/O chip in the system that monitors temperature information ior the CPU and system, and has multiple fan control points   The SIO chips with smart fan control aAe capable of varying fan speed based on values configured in fan and temperature control registers<br>
[0098]    In many systems, the graphics card may consume iiearly as much power as the CPU when in use  This poses a difficult thermal challenge to solve when the system enters Smart Off However, since the user is not actively using the display wn°n the system is in Smart Off, the need for high graphics performance is not necessary  This allows the graphics vendor the possibility to aggressively manage the GPU of the card as necessary when entering Smart Off In addition, heat sink design can be taken into consideration io develop a solution which can be passively cooled when in Smart Off<br>
[0099]      In order to ensure that the GPU temperature did not rise higher than the manufacturer's published specifications dunng Smart Off, a heat sink 418 design as shown in Fig 8 may be used This design is used where GPU throttling and fan control are not implemented  hi addition, the stock heat sink provided with most graphics cards do not provide adequate heat transfer characteristics   In particular, the video card is mounted with the heat sink facing downward in an area that was not in the direct path of most of the airflow in the system  Additionally, the orientation of the fins 420 of the stock heat smk was perpendicular to the prevailing airflow in that area of the enclosure<br>
[0100]    As with the CPU heat sink, the physical size of this heat sink is maximized to fit in the available space within the system enclosure, while leaving clearance for board-mounted components, wiring, and surrounding geometry  Fm orientation better matches the<br>
direction of prevailing airflow in that area of the enclosure, and cross-cuts 422 help induce airflow turbulence  This heat sink is also anodized in a black color to help maximize radiative heat transfer capability<br>
[0101]    Software Implementation<br>
[0102]    A set of Always Ready Extensions are managed via a suite of drivers and a usei-mode services   The block diagram in Fig 9 illustrates these software components and their logical relationship to each other  Rectangular boxes are drivers and ARPohcy, ARHidFlt and ARACPI are not specific to any particular hardware implementation  The AREnv dnver is partially hardware-dependent  The ARService is a user-mode Always Ready service  The service is not hardware dependent<br>
[0103]    In WINDOWS operating systems, all dnvers are standard kei^el-mode WDM dnvers  All the drivers in the diagram are instantiated through standard PnP means, either as a result of the PCI bus dnver associating the dnver with a given VID/DID, as a filter dnver, or as root enumerated device The user-mode service is started during system boot, at the typical system service start time<br>
[0104]    Each of the elements in Fig 9 will now be descnbed  The ARPohcy dnver 424 (or other apphcably named driver) is responsible for collecting mfonnation from other Always Ready dnvers and cooperating entities  ARPohcy 424 uses the information to determine the system's Always Ready state  This state information is then distnbuted by ARPohcy to all cooperating entities throughout the system  The AREnv dnver 426 is provided as an example of how to support any specialized haidware that needs to be informed of the changes in the system's Always Ready state The ARHidFlt dnver 428 .s the HID filter dnver  When the system is in Smart Off, this dnver "locks" the USB keyboard (by discarding all user keystrokes) and USB mouse (by discarding mouse movement notifications) This dnver also detects a predefined key sequence that is used to toggle to and from Smart Off and on (an alternative to the Smart Off button)   The ARACPI dnver 430 claims the Always Ready specific de\ice (if one exists) that is defined wrlhin the system's ACPI name space  The ARACPI driver 430 calls a specific method that is defined in this device's ACPI name space (directly below the device) whenever the system enters or leaves Smart Off state  The ARService 432 is the user-mode service that performs Always Ready operations that are more easily implemented in user mode  These operations include powenng down the main video display, muting the audio, pausing audio playback that is in progress, land reducing the CPU speed  These operations may be accomphshti using<br>
conventional functions  The specific functions ARScrvice 432 performs on entrance to S0-Looks-Off state is controlled by registry keys, as defined below<br>
[0105]    The communication between ARPolicy and integral kernel-mode components will now be described  ARXxxx drivers (1 e , drivers to control components that are under the direction of ARPolicy) generally will not take autonomous actions to change their states as a result of hardware status changes or events that they internally deiect  Rather, changes in hardware status identified by an ARXxxx dnver will lesult in that dnver generating one or more event notifications to the ARPolicy Driver  The ARPolicy driver integrates information collected from the various components throughout the system and uses this information to define the system's current Always Ready state ARPolicy communicates any changes in the system's Always Ready state to the othei ARXxxx drivers using command notifications  The ARXxxx dnvers use information they receive from ARPolicy about the current Already Ready system state to manage their control points<br>
[0106]    Communication between ARPolicy and the other ARXxxx dnvers is accomplished by means of a pair of named executive callbacks   The first is an "Event" callback  This callback (named ARPCJ3VENT_CALLBACK_NAME) is notified by an ARXxxx driver to send system status reporting information to ARPolicy  Each ARXxxx dnver (other than ARPolicy) opens this callback, and uses it for event notification  ARPolicy opens this callback and registers a callback routine which will be called as a result of each notification<br>
[0107]    The second is a "Command" callback  This callback (ARPC_COMMAND_CALLBACK_NAME) is notified by ARPohcy when it has a command to send to one or more of the ARXxxx dnveis   Each ARXxxx driver (other than ARPolicy) opens this callback and registers a callback routine, which is called as a result of ARPolicy notifying the callback<br>
[0108]    Kernel callbacks are preferable as the mam communication method because they are relativel} lightweight yet can provide a 1-to-many (broadcast type) communication mechanism  Additionally, notifications pass two arguments to the callback routine which provides significant flexibility  Because callback notifications are processed synchronously, all dnvers in the Always Ready suite will process their callbacks quickly and without blocking  It is also preferable that communication in this system is between ARPolicy and one of the other ARXxxx dnvers  ARXxxx dnvers never communicate directly with each other<br>
 [0109]    When a callback is notified, whether by ARPolicy or any of the other ARXxx drivers, two 32-bit arguments are passed an AR_COMMAND structure, and'an additional 32-bit value that is referred to herein as Value2   The use of Value2 depends on the contents of AR_COMMAND   The AR_COMMAND structure will be used to communicate between ARPolicy and the other ARxxx drivers<br>
[0110]    The format of an exemplary structure is shown in Fig 10, whire the AR_COMMAND field definitions are as follows<br>
C/E. Set to indicate that the AR_COMMAND structure describes a command and. that this AR_COMMAND originates from ARPolicy and is primarily directed to the dnver identified in the Driver field  Clear to indicate that the ARCOMMAND structure describes an event pnmarily targeted to the ARPolicy dnver, and that this ARCOMIVIAND ongmated from the ARXxx driver identified by the Driver field<br>
ID Contains a 7-bit value that uniquely identifies a particular command or eve/)*<br>
Driver. If C/E equals 1 (indicating a command), Driver contams the AR_DRIVER number of the dnver that is the pnmary target for this command  When C/E equals 1 and Driver is OxF (AR_DRIVER_ALL), the target is all ARXxxx objects If C/E is 0 (indicating an event), Driver contains the AR_DRIVER number of the dnver generating the event<br>
Seq If C/E equals 1 (indicating a command), this is the command sequence number If C/E equals 0 (indicating an event), this is eithei (1) the sequence number from the Seq field of a previously leceived command, to indicate that this event is a response to a specific command, or (2) 0 to indicate that this event is not generated in response to a previously received command<br>
F/S: When C/E equals 0, F/S is set to indicate that the AR_COMMAND structure describes an event that is at least partially in erroi   The data in Valuel (see below) maytbe partial or incorrect  This bit is most typically set when an ARXxxx dnver attempts to process a command fiom ARPolicy, but fails   In this case, the command ID contains the command from ARPolicy<br>
Valuel* Contains data (such as a command argument or event value) cssociatod with and defined by the specific command or event indicated in ID<br>
[0111]    Several examples of event IDs are as follows<br>
ARPC_EVENT_ENTER_SMARTOFF - Valuel and Value2 are Doth zero for this event<br>
ARPCJEVENT„EXIT_SMARTOFF - Valuel and Value2 are both ?ero foi this event<br>
 [0112]    An exemplary command may be<br>
ARPC_COMMAND_SET_ALWAYS_READY_SYSTEM_STAT£-Value' is zero, and Value2 contains an ARPOLICY_STATE structure<br>
[0113]    Whenever ARPolicy receives an event notification, it evaluates the effect of the event on the Always Ready state of the system   If the event results in a change in the s) stem's Always Ready state, ARPolicy will build an AR_COMMAND with the command ID ARPC_COMMANDjSET__ALWAYS_READY_SYSTEM_STATE, and will pass the system's new Always Ready state, as described by an ARPOLICYSTATE structure, in Value2 when the command notification is performed<br>
[0114]    The format of an exemplary ARPOLICY_STATE structure is shown in Fig 11   As show in Fig 11, the ARPOLICY_STATE field definitions are as follows<br>
PowerState. The system's current S-state (S0-S5), or SO-Looks-Off<br>
CpuUsage The current CPU utilization percentage, in deciles (l e the values 1 through 10 meaning 10% through 100%)<br>
Application A bit mask, where each bit in the range of 0-14 represents a specific "Always Ready Aware" application that is active  The bit numbei is the index into an array of names of Always Ready Aware applications in the registiy  Bit 15, when L.et, indicates that one or more additional "Always Ready Aware" applications are currently active<br>
Reserved These fields are reserved for future use and are ignored<br>
[0115]    Cooperating kernel-mode entities, other than the ARXxxx drivers may also communicate changes in state information to ARPolicy  They do this by opening the Event callback (ARPC_EVENT_CALLBACK_NAME) and notifying this callback as previously described for ArXxxx drivers, passing an AR_COMMAND structure and additional DWORD argument (Value2)  Because cooperating entities are not integral parts of the Always Ready software suite, they set the Driver field of the ARCOMMAND structure to DRIVER_OTHER, and the Seq and S/F fields to zero<br>
[0116]    For example, a driver for a cooperating HID device might want to notify ArPohcy of the occurrence of a HID event that should cause the system to enter S0-Looks-Off state  The HID driver could accomplish this using cede that looks something like the following<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0117]    In the above example, DeviceExtension-&gt;smartof fcaiibaci' containsia pointer to the previously opened callback object named<br>
ARPCJEVENT_CALLBACKJNAME)  Because cooperating entities are not integrally designed members of the Always Ready software suite, it is preferred that they do not open the Command callback object (ARPCj:OMMAND_CALLBACK^NAME)  Such entities may, however, be notified of changes in the system's Always Ready state by registering for target device change notifications from ARPohcy  This is described elsewhere in this document<br>
[0118]   ARPolic) communicates changes in the system's Always Ready state to user-mode components and both integral and non-integral cooperating kernel-mode components by sending custom target device change notification PnP events   WINDOWS operating systems identify target device change notification events using GUIDs  Always Ready defines two specific target device change notification events defined for communication with user-mode and other cooperating entities<br>
ARPOLICY_COMMAND_NOTIFICATION_GUID - When the event associated with this GUID is tnggered, the custom data that is sent is the same 32-bit AR._COMMAND and 32-bit Value2 values described previously<br>
ARPOLICY^ALWAYS_READY_NOTIFICATION„GUID - When the event associated with this GUID is tnggered, one byte of custom data is sent A value of 0 is used to indicate that the system is in SO, a value of 1 indicates that the system is in SO-Looks-Off state<br>
[0119]   Phases of Operation<br>
[0120]    As previously noted, the drivers developed as part of this project are fully compliant with WDM PnP and power management guidelines  The dnveis are instantiated as follows<br>
ARPohcy - Root is enumerated as RootVARPohcy<br>
AREnv — Root is enumerated as RootVAREnv<br>
ARHidFIt - Loads as an upper filter of the HID class driver<br>
ARACPI — Loads on ACPI-defmed device, ACPI\PNPxxyy<br>
 [0121 ]    Dunng system startup, all ARXxxx drivers other than ARPohcy will wait for ARPohcy to enable its interface (ARPOLICY_DRTVER_INTERFACE)   Once ARPohcy's interface has been enabled, drivers that raise events that impact the system's Always Ready state will raise events to indicate the starting state of the system  These initial states»'ill be used by ARPohcy to build the first<br>
ARPC_COMMAND_SET_ALWAYS_READY„SYSTEM_STATE command for the system  As soon as the above events have been received by ARPohcy, the first ARPC_COMMAND_SET_ALWAYS_READY_SYSTEM_STATE command will be issued, via both the command callback notification and GUID<br>
ARPOLICY_COMMAND_NOTIFICATION_GUID taiget device change notification Prior to receipt of this command, individual ARXxxx drivers may set their devices to appropriate default states  Dunng system startup, ARPohcy may or may not issue a custom target device change notification for ARPOLICY_ALWAYS_READY_NOTIFICATION_GUID  Tnus, dunng startup elements utilizing this notification shall assume the system state to be SO<br>
[0122] During normal system operation, ARXxxx dnvers and coope^tmg entities will interact with their hardware as appropriate Each ARXxxx driver will penodically, but no less than every 5 seconds, determine the state of its component and transmit any change matenally affecting the system's Always Ready state to ARPohcy by raising an event<br>
[0123]    ARPohcy will typically issue ARPC_COMMAND_SET_ALWAYS_READY„SYSTEM_STATE commands (via callback notification and tnggering the ARPOLICY_COMMAND_NOTIFICATION_GUID and target device change event) only as a result of a change in the system's Always Rea^y state  Hovvever, it is preferable that components be able to accept receiving sequential, identical, ARPC_COMMAND_SET_ALWAYS_READY_SYSTEM_STATE commands<br>
[0124]    To provide for a quality user expenence, and feedback that's as close as possible to "real time", ARPohcy will trigger a custom target device change e\ent with a ARPC_COMMAND_SET_ALWAYS_READY_SYSTEM_STATE command indicating a change in SO-Looks-Off state to ARPOLICY_COMMAND_NOTIFICATION_GUID on receipt of either an Entei Smart Off or Exit Smart Off event  This allows ARService and other such entities to perform human interface mteractions as close to the time of the request as possible<br>
[0125]    Aftei a suitable period to collect any additional pending state changes, ' ARPohcy will issue the ARPC COMMAND SET ALWAYS READY SYSTEM STATE command with me<br>
new system state reflecting (at least) the change in SO-Looks-Off state  This command is sent via callback notification and ARPOLICY_COMMAND_NOTIFICATION_GUID custom target device change notification   Subsequently, a custom target device change notification is also sent to ARPOLICY_ALWAYS„READY_NOTIFICATION__GUID to indicate the riew SO-Looks-Off state<br>
[0126]   ARPohcy notifies most cooperating system components about the system's entry and exit from SO-Looks-Off state via a custom target device change event, identified by the GUID ARPOLICY_ALWAYS_READY_NOTIFICATION_GUID   While ARPolicy will typically trigger this target device change event only on a change of state, entities utilizing this event check the custom data byte included with this notification to see if there has indeed been a change in the SO/SO-Looks-Off state of the system and act accordingly<br>
[0127]    Component Registry Values<br>
[0128]    The default behavior of the integral components in the Always Ready system may be tailored according to platform requirements   This is preferably done through the use of Registry entries   The Registry entries may be as follow s<br>
KeyProcesses - list of executable image names that will cause the "CPU ceiling" to be lifted when the system is in Smart Off<br>
ProcessTimer - the time, in milliseconds, between ARPohcy polling intervals.<br>
BlankDisplay - Boolean value indicating whether or not the display should be blanked when entering Smart Off<br>
PauseMedia - Boolean value indicating whether or not the currently open instance of a media player should be paused when entering Smart Off and resumed when exiting<br>
MuteAudio - Boolean value indicating whether or not the mam audio should be muted<br>
when entering Smart Off	<br>
ThrottleProcessor - Boolean value indicating whether or not the processor will be throttled to its lowest possible P-state when entering Smart Off<br>
EntcrKeys - a list of HID pages and usages of keys that cause the system to ENTER Smart Off<br>
DontPassExitKeys - list of HID pages and usages of keys that should cause the system to EXIT Smart Off<br>
PassExitKeys - list of HID pages and usages of keys that should cause the system to EXIT Smart Off<br>
[0129]    It is noted that the Smart Off functionality may be accomplished via an operating system kernel   The implementation within the operating system well generally<br>
consist of modifying power management policy to comprehend putting the system into a lower-power "SO" state when the power button is pressed, if the OS is configured by the user to do so   This would entail using existing mechanisms to lower power on the CPU (the same being used by the other two implementations), and implementing ACPI thermal zones in the BIOS to change fan behavior when going into the lower power SO state  In addition, Screen blank ng, audio muting would also be handled through internal OS mechanisms, or throagh a service<br>
