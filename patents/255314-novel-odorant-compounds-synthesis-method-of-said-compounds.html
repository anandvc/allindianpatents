NOVEL ODORANT COMPOUNDS, SYNTHESIS METHOD, AND USES OF SAID<br>
COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention relates to novel odorous<br>
5 compounds which can be used in perfumery. The invention<br>
relates in particular to novel aldehydes, to their<br>
corresponding alcohols and ethers, to their process of<br>
synthesis and to their uses in perfumery.<br>
The term "perfumery" is used here to denote not<br>
10 only perfumery in the usual sense of the term but also the<br>
other fields in which the odor of products is important.<br>
Perfumery compositions in the usual sense of the term may<br>
be involved, such as fragrance bases, perfume concentrates,<br>
eaux de Cologne, toilet waters, fragrances and similar<br>
15 products; topical compositions, in particular cosmetics,<br>
such as creams for the face and body, talcum powders, hair<br>
oils, shampoos, hair lotions, bath salts and oils, shower<br>
and bath gels, toilet soaps, antiperspirants and deodorants<br>
for the body, shaving lotions and creams, soaps, creams,<br>
20 toothpastes, mouthwashes, pomades and similar products; and<br>
cleaning products, such as softeners, detergents, washing<br>
powders, air fresheners and similar products.<br>
Aldehydes represent one of the main families of<br>
odorous molecules used in perfumery. In this family, the<br>
25 aldehydes having between 8 and 12 carbon atoms play an<br>
important role. Terpene aldehydes, which have floral odors,<br>
are included among these aldehydes. Linear aldehydes<br>
derived from fatty acids, which have fresh notes typical of<br>
fruit of the citrus family, are also included.<br>
30 Aldehydes combining both these types of odor<br>
currently do not exist. In any case, the need remains for<br>
novel odorous agents in order to extend the range of the<br>
notes which can be introduced into a composition and the<br>
options available for adding these notes.<br>
35 A subject matter of the present invention is the<br>
novel compounds represented by the following general<br>
formula (I):<br><br>
WO 2006/077305 PCT/FR2006/000080<br>
-	2 –<br><br><br>
in which X is a CHO, CH2OH, CH2OC(O)R or CH(OR)2 group and R<br>
5 represents a linear or branched C1-C5 alkyl or alkenyl<br>
chain, and<br>
the bond given as a dotted line is present or absent.<br>
The compound of formula (I) can be present in the<br>
form of an isomer or of a mixture of isomers, in particular<br>
10 of an enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers, or of a<br>
racemic mixture, or of a diastereoisomer or of a mixture of<br>
diastereoisomers.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to a<br>
compound of formula (I) in which the bond given as a dotted<br>
15 line is present and X represents a -CHO group; this novel<br>
aldehyde, of formula (1) below, is 6,8-dimethylnon-7-enal<br>
(1). The invention also relates to the process of synthesis<br>
and to the use of this compound (1) as odorous agent by<br>
virtue of its fresh, orange peel and herbaceous notes with<br>
20 coriander leaf accents.<br><br><br><br><br>

1,6-diene and is represented by the following scheme:<br><br>
Hydroformylation is a well known reaction. A person<br>
5 skilled in the art today has a choice between several<br>
catalysts which allow him to introduce an aldehyde<br>
functional group into an unsaturated molecule and will thus<br>
be in a position to choose the catalyst or system of<br>
catalysts and to determine the reaction conditions.<br>
10 Use may be made, as an example, in the process<br>
according to the invention, of a system of catalysts,<br>
bis (N)4-1, 5-cyclooctadiene) di (p-methoxy) dirhodium(I) (A) and<br>
diphenylphosphino-1,8-dimethyl-9,9-xanthene (Xantphos) (B),<br>
described by Claudia Foca, Humberto J.V. Barros, Eduardo N.<br>
15 dos Santos, Elena V. Gusevskaya and J.C. Bayon, New Journal<br>
of Chemistry (2003), 27(3), 533-539. This system of<br>
catalysts is advantageous as a result of the ease of the<br>
synthesis thereof and of the use thereof. It forms, in the<br>
presence of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, an active complex<br>
20 [RhH(diphosphine)CO2] which reacts with the alkene present.<br>
Other diphosphines can also be used to form a diphosphine-<br>
rhodium complex, as shown, for example, by Immaculada del<br>
Rio, Wim G.J. de Lange, Piet W.N.M. van Leeuwen and Carmen<br>

Of course, the rhodium catalyst [Rh{OMe) (COD) 2] (A)<br>
30 can also be substituted by catalysts such as<br>
[Rh(acac)(CO)2] or [Rh(OAc)(COD)]2, for example, as<br><br><br>

According to one embodiment of the process<br>
according to the invention, use is thus made, as<br>
hydroformylation catalyst, of the system of catalysts<br>
bis (n4 —1, 5-cyclooctadiene) di (u-methoxy) dirhodium(I) (A) and<br>
10 diphenylphosphino-1,8-dimethyl-9,9-xanthene (Xantphos) (B).<br>
The reaction can then be carried out using from 1 x 10~3 to<br>
1 x 10-4 equivalent, preferably from 2 x 10-4 to 5 x 10-4<br>
equivalent, of catalyst with respect to the starting<br>
alkene.<br>
15 According to this embodiment, the reaction is<br>
carried out in an autoclave into which the 5,7-<br>
dimethylocta-1,6-diene, thoroughly degassed, is charged<br>
under nitrogen. The catalyst (A) and the cocatalyst (B) are<br>
also added under nitrogen. The reaction can be carried out<br>
20 using from 1 x 10-3 to 1 x 10-4 equivalent, preferably from<br>
2 x 10-4 to 5 x 10-4 equivalent, of catalyst with respect to<br>
the alkene. The autoclave is subsequently closed and purged<br>
several times with an equimolar mixture of carbon monoxide<br>
and hydrogen. The internal pressure of the autoclave can be<br>
25 adjusted to a value from approximately 5 x 103 to<br>
8 x 104 HPa, preferably from 3 x 104 to 6 x 104 HPa, and the<br>
reaction medium is heated, in particular to a temperature<br>
from approximately 60 to 120°C, preferably 100°C. The<br>
conversion is monitored by gas chromatography and the<br>
30 product is recovered after approximately 12 hours and<br>
directly distilled, providing the 6,8-dimethylnon-7-enal<br>

-CH(OR)2 group where R represents a linear or branched C1-C5<br>
10 alkyl or alkenyl chain and the bond given as a dotted line<br>
is present or absent, to their process of synthesis and to<br>
their use as odorous agents.<br>
The present invention also relates to the<br>
unsaturated alcohol (2) and the saturated alcohol (2')<br>

The alcohols (2) and (2') of the present invention<br>
can be easily prepared by reduction of the compounds of<br>
25 formula (1) under conditions well known to a person skilled<br>
in the art. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the<br><br><br>
WO 2006/077305 PCT/FR2006/000080<br>
- 6 -<br>
unsaturated alcohol (2) is obtained by selective reduction<br>
of the aldehyde functional group (1) by a reducing agent,<br>
such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) , and the saturated<br>
alcohol (2') is synthesized by reduction of the aldehyde<br>
5 functional group and of the C-C double bond of the compound<br>
(1) by hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, such as<br>
palladium-on-charcoal.<br>
The saturated aldehyde (1') of the present<br>
invention can be prepared by oxidation of (2') according to<br>
10 methods well known to a person skilled in the art, such as,<br>
for example, by Corey's reagent (CrO3/pyridine/HCl) .<br>
The present invention also relates to the esters<br>
(3) and (3') derived from the alcohols (2) and (2')<br>
respectively, that is to say the compounds of formula (I)<br>
15 where X represents a -CH2OC(O)R group where R represents a<br>
linear or branched Ci-C5 alkyl or alkenyl chain* and the<br>
bond given as a dotted line is present (3) or absent (3'),<br>

WO 2006/077305 PCT/FR2006/000080<br>
- 7 -<br>
The invention also relates to the process for the<br>
synthesis of these esters and to their use as odorous<br>
agents.<br>
The esters (3) and (3') of the present invention<br>
5 can be respectively prepared from (2) and (2' ) in<br>
particular by esterification of the appropriate linear or<br>
branched C1-C5 acids or acyl chlorides, according to<br>
conditions well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
A scheme for the synthesis of the compounds of the<br>
10 invention is given below, as nonlimiting example:<br><br>
R = linear or branched C1-C5 alkyl or alkenyl chain<br>

formula (I) have a great variety of uses in perfumery,<br>
within the meaning explained in detail above, in particular<br>
and without implied limitation in cosmetics and for<br>
cleaning products.<br>
5 Another subject matter of the invention is the use<br>
of at least one compound of formula (I) according to the<br>
invention as odorous agent, as odor-masking agent or as<br>
odor-neutralizing agent, alone or as a mixture with one or<br>
more other odorous compounds known to a person skilled in<br>

to choose according to the effect desired. The additional<br>
odorous agent or agents can be compounds of formula (I) or<br>
other odorous agents known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Another subject matter of the invention is the<br>
15 compositions comprising a base product and an effective<br>
amount of one or more compounds of formula (I) according to<br>
the invention.<br>
It can be a composition which is itself odorous or<br>
a composition in which the odorous agent is used to mask or<br>
20 neutralize certain odors.<br>
The base product will be easily determined by a<br>
person skilled in the art according to the composition<br>
envisaged and thus the use envisaged, the usual components<br>
for which, such as solvent(s) and/or adjuvant(s), are well<br>
25 known.<br>
The effective amount of the compounds of formula<br>
(I) according to the invention incorporated in the<br>
composition will vary according to the nature of the<br>
composition, the odorous effect desired and the nature of<br>
30 the other odorous or nonodorous compounds possibly present<br>
and can be easily determined by a person skilled in the<br>
art, it being known that it can vary within a very broad<br>
range from 0.1 to 99% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 50%<br>
by weight, in particular 0.1 to 30% by weight.<br>
35 The compounds of formula (I) according to the<br><br><br>
WO 2006/077305 PCT/FR2006/000080<br>

5 The following examples further illustrate the novel<br>
odorous compounds, their process of synthesis, their<br>
advantage and their uses. These examples are presented only<br>
with an illustrative purpose and may not be regarded as<br>
limitations on the invention.<br>
10<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of 6,8-dimethylnon-7-enal (1)<br>
138.0 g {1.00 mol) of degassed 5,7-dimethylocta-l,6-diene<br>
are charged under nitrogen to an autoclave in which a glass<br>
container has been placed. 232 mg (0.48 mmol) of bis (r|4-<br>
15 1,5-cyclooctadiene)di(p-methoxy)dirhodium(I) (A) and 836 mg<br>
(1.44 mmol) of diphenylphosphino-1,8-dimethyl-9,9-xanthene<br>
(B) are added. The autoclave is closed and purged three<br>
times with an equimolar mixture of carbon monoxide and<br>
hydrogen. The internal pressure is adjusted to 3 x 104 HPa.<br>
20 Heating is carried out slowly to 100°C, taking the<br>
exothermicity of the reaction into consideration, without<br>
exceeding a bulk temperature of 120°C. The reaction medium<br>
is heated under these conditions for 12 hours. Cooling is<br>
carried out to ambient temperature and then the product is<br>
25 transferred into a distillation apparatus. After having<br>
recovered the 5,7-dimethylocta-l,6-diene (41.6 g, B.p.:<br>
35°C/60 HPa), 88.2 g (0.48 mol) of 6,8-dimethylnon-7-enal<br>
(1), B.p.: 48°C/3.5 HPa, are obtained. The yield is 48%.<br>
The analyses of the infrared, NMR and mass spectra<br>
30 correspond to the structure of the aldehyde (1).<br>
Example 2: Synthesis of 6,8-dimethylnon-7-enol (2)<br>
18 g (0.11 mol) of 6,8-dimethylnon-7-enal (1) and 96.0 g of<br>
ethanol are placed in a 500 ml round-bottomed flask<br>
35	equipped with a thermometer. Cooling is carried out to 5°C<br><br><br>
WO 2006/077305 PCT/FR2006/000080<br>
- 11 -<br>
and 2.0 g of sodium borohydride are added in small portions<br>
without exceeding a bulk temperature of 10°C. The mixture<br>
is stirred at ambient temperature for 16 hours. Cooling is<br>
carried out to 5°C and 20.0 g (1.36 mol) of acetone are<br>
5 added dropwise to destroy the excess reducing agent without<br>
exceeding a bulk temperature of 10°C. The reaction medium<br>
is acidified with 20.0 g of 10% hydrochloric acid without<br>
exceeding a bulk temperature of 10°C. 40 g of water are<br>
also added, followed by 70 g of toluene, with vigorous<br>
10 stirring. The phases are separated and the organic phase is<br>
washed once with 50 g of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution<br>
and twice with 50 g of water. The organic phase is dried<br>
and filtered, and the toluene is evaporated at reduced<br>
pressure. After distillation, 13.4 g (0.08 mol) of (B.p.:<br>
15 105°C/10 torr) are obtained. The yield is 72.7%. The<br>
analyses of the infrared, NMR and mass spectra correspond<br>
to the expected alcohol.<br>
Example 3: 6,8-Dimethylnon-7-enol acetate<br>
20 13 g (76 mmol) of 6,8-dimethylnon-7-enol (2), 10.8 g<br>
(107 mmol) of triethylamine and 200 ml of t-butyl methyl<br>
ether (MTBE) are placed in a 500 ml round-bottomed flask<br>
equipped with a thermometer and with a dropping funnel.<br>
Cooling is carried out to 5°C and 8.4 g (107 mmol) of<br>
25 acetylchloride diluted in 20 ml of MTBE are added without<br>
exceeding a bulk temperature of 10°C. The mixture is<br>
stirred at ambient temperature for 14 hours. Cooling is<br>
carried out at 5°C and neutralization is carried out with<br>
100 ml of a 10% hydrochloric acid solution. The phases are<br>
30 separated and the organic phase is washed once with 100 ml<br>
of saturated aqueous NaHCC3 solution and then with aqueous<br>
saline solution to neutrality. The organic phase is dried<br>
and filtered, and the solvent is evaporated under reduced<br>
pressure. The acetate is purified by a distillation under<br>

Example 5: Olfactory evaluation of the pure compound (1)<br>
In a first step, the odorous characteristics of the pure<br>
compound (1) were evaluated by a panel. The evaluation<br>
panel was composed of several professionals who<br>
10 quantitatively evaluate the compound. The compound (1) was<br>
described as fresh, orange peel and herbaceous with<br>
coriander leaf accents. If the aldehyde (1) is diluted to<br>
1% in propylene glycol, its fruity notes become dominant<br>
and a melon note may be perceived.<br>

Example 6: Olfactory evaluation of the compound (1) in two<br>
compositions<br>
Subsequently, two fragrance compositions were created in<br>
which the olfactory impact of the compound (1) was<br>
20 examined. These fragrance compositions can be used for<br>
topical cosmetic products of shampoo, shower gel or cream<br>
type, and the like.<br>
In each case, the evaluations of the olfactory impact were<br>
carried out at to, t+48h and t+i68h in order to evaluate the<br>
25 top, middle and base notes of the composition comprising<br>
the compound (1) (test 2), in comparison with a composition<br>
not comprising the compound (test 1).<br>

5 The presence of 6,8-dimethylnon-7-enal (1) in composition<br>
No. 1 considerably changes its odor from an apple to a<br>
sweet, fleshy and very pleasantly natural green melon.<br>
The 6,8-dimethylnon-7-enal (1) contributes fruity notes, in<br>
10 particular green melon, and the seaside to composition No.<br>
2.It also gives more strength to the top notes.<br>
The loss in intensity with time appears to be fairly<br>
linear, without allowing a significant change in odorous<br>
15 characteristic to appear.<br>
The results of these evaluations show, without the<br>
slightest doubt, that the compound (1) according to the<br>
invention exhibits advantageous olfactory characteristics<br>
20 which will find application in perfumery, in particular in<br>
cosmetics and cleaning products and generally in any<br>
odorous composition or composition having an odor which it<br>
is desired to mask or neutralize.<br>
25 Example 7: Olfactory evaluation of compound (2), pure and<br>
in a composition<br>
An evaluation panel similar to that of example 5 drew up,<br>
for the pure compound (2), the following olfactory<br>
30 description: rustic, floral, bergamot, cinnamon.<br>
The olfactory impact of compound (2) was subsequently<br>
tested in a synthetic bergamot composition (test 2), in<br>
comparison with a composition not comprising the compound<br>
35 (test 1) .<br><br><br>
WO 2006/077305 PCT/FR2006/000080<br>
- 18 -<br><br>
The tests carried out show that the presence of 6,8-di-<br>
methylnon-7-enol reinforces the bergamot note and gives<br>
5 strength to the product. Its effect is even more striking<br>
after 2 h 00 of evaporation; the bergamot note persists in<br>
the middle.<br><br><br>
