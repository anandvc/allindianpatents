				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an ignition apparatus for an<br>
engine, particularly relates to a technology that is effective for<br>
applying to a contactless full-transistor ignition apparatus for<br>
use in ignition of an engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventionally, as to a full-transistor ignition apparatus for<br>
use in ignition of an engine, such a method is employed that the<br>
current has previously energized to the primary side (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as primary current) ; when the energy of the primary<br>
side of an ignition coil w which satisfies the equation of w=(L*I)/<br>
2 is enhanced, the current which has energized to the primary side<br>
is rapidly interrupted; back electromotive force is induced on the<br>
primary side of the ignition coil; and a high voltage generated on<br>
the secondary side at that time is made discharged at a spark plug<br>
and ignited to an air-fuel mixture within an engine.<br>
In a full-transistor ignition apparatus for use in ignition of<br>
an engine as the aforementioned one, for example, in the analog<br>
control of the primary current of the ignition coil, in a four-<br>
wheeled vehicle, a shape of the pickup coil is different from that<br>
for a two-wheeled vehicle, and like the primary current control<br>
circuit, between a pickup coil and a transistor for switching an<br>
ignition coil, dwell angle control circuit comprising a diode, a<br>
condenser and resistance is connected, and the operating point; of<br>
the transistor is changed by the generated voltage of the pickup<br>
coil and the charge stored in the condenser.<br><br>
In such a primary current control circuit, for example, at the<br>
time of lower rotation rate in the generated voltage of the pickup<br>
coil, the transistor could be turned off by slight negative<br>
voltage, to the contrary, at the time of higher rotation rate, the<br>
working voltage of the transistor is transferred to the larger<br>
negative voltage side. Therefore, as to switching on time of t.he<br>
transistor, as the rate becomes higher, the more dwell angle<br>
increases and the longer switching on time becomes. In this way,<br>
the dwell angle control is performed by utilizing the generation<br>
voltage of the pickup coil itself of a signal generator increasing<br>
with a rise of rotation rate and by lowering the operating point of<br>
the transistor with an increase of the generation voltage and the<br>
lowering of the generated second voltage of the ignition coil at<br>
the time of higher rotation rate is prevented. This has been<br>
explained hereinafter with reference to illustrative drawings.<br>
However, even in the analogue control of the primary current<br>
using the primary current control circuit as aforementioned,<br>
although an energizing time of an ignition coil is changed, it<br>
is difficult to energize only certain time at the time of a<br>
lower rotation rate through at the time of a higher<br><br>
rotation rate, since the primary current is made flown for a<br>
time longer than a time being necessary, it is required to add<br>
an ignition protection circuit, and it is estimated to wastefully<br>
consume the power. Specifically, since it is required that the<br>
primary current is made flown and interrupt per each rotation<br>
of an engine, the time for which the current can be flown to<br>
the ignition coil is limited by the number of rotations of the<br>
engine per certain time, for example, in order to generate a<br>
sufficient secondary voltage, it is necessary to flow the primary<br>
current only for a time on the order of 5 ms (millisecond) , however,<br>
at the time of a lower rotation rate, the current is made flown<br>
for a longer time such as for a time on the order of 60 ms.<br>
Moreover, in the case of a two-wheeled vehicle (analogue<br>
control), since an ignition advance angle range is determined<br>
by the width of a reluctor, it is difficult to employ a pickup<br>
as a conventional example employs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hence, an object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a full-transistor ignition apparatus for optimally controlling<br>
an energizing time of the primary current of an ignition coil<br>
per each rotation, being capable of obtaining the necessary and<br>
minimum primary current energizing time at the time of lower<br>
rotations per second through at the time of higher rotations<br>
per second, thereby utilizing a conventional ACG flywheel for<br>
a two-wheeler as it is and being capable of making the timing<br>
of the energizing initiation precise and suppressing the<br><br>
consuming power as well.<br>
The present invention utilizes a CR time constant of a<br>
condenser and a resistance, and the frequency characteristics<br>
of the CR circuit in the primary current control, and carries<br>
out comparison control and the optimum correction per one period.<br>
Specifically, a full-transistor ignition apparatus according<br>
to the present invention has comparison control means for<br>
comparing voltages of two sets of CR circuits having different<br>
time constants and having inverse charging discharging timings<br>
respectively and voltages of condensers of these two sets of<br>
CR circuits, when the voltage of one of condensers of the CR<br>
circuits is higher than that of the other condenser of the CR<br>
circuits, controlling the voltage so as to energize the primary<br>
current by switching a transistor for use in switching of the<br>
ignition coil on, and a correction control means, being<br>
connecting one condenser of the CR circuit, for performing the<br>
optimum correction per each rotation by utilizing a pulser signal<br>
and for optimally controlling an energizing time during which<br>
the primary current flows through the ignition coil.<br>
According to a full-transistor ignition apparatus of the<br>
present invention, the following advantages can be obtained:<br>
(1) Since an energizing time of the primary current can<br>
be optimally controlled per each rotation by having comparison<br>
control means for comparing and controlling voltages of two sets<br>
of CR circuits having the respective different time constants<br>
and inverse charging and discharging timings and voltages of<br>
condensers of these two sets of CR circuits and correction control<br><br>
means for performing optimal correction per each rotation by<br>
utilizing a pulser signal and optimally controlling an energizing<br>
time for energizing the primary current through an ignition coil,<br>
it is possible that a necessary and minimum energizing time of<br>
the primary current is obtained at the time of lower rotation<br>
rate through at higher rotation rate.<br>
(2)	According to the aforementioned (1), a conventional<br>
flywheel of ACG for a two-wheeler can be utilized as it is.<br>
(3)	According to the aforementioned (1), the initiation<br>
of energizing timing can be precisely performed by comparison<br>
and the optimal correction per each rotation and the consuming<br>
electric power can be suppressed.<br>

BACKGROUND ART<br>
In a full-transistor ignition apparatus for use in ignition of<br>
an engine as the aforementioned one, for example, in the analog<br>
control of the primary current of the ignition coil, in a four-<br>
wheeled vehicle, a shape of the pickup coil is different from that<br>
for a two-wheeled vehicle as shown in Fig. 4A (a: for a four<br>
wheeled vehicle, b: for a two-wheeled vehicle), and like the<br>
primary current control circuit shown in Fig. 5, between a pickup<br>
coil and a transistor for switching an ignition coil, dwell angle<br>
control circuit comprising a diode, a condenser and resistance is<br>
connected, and the operating point of the transistor is changed by<br>
the generated voltage of the pickup coil and the charge stored in<br>
the condenser.<br>
In such a primary current control circuit, for example, as<br>
shown in Fig. 5, at the time of lower rotation rate in the<br>
generated voltage of the pickup coil, the transistor could be<br>
turned off by slight negative voltage, to the contrary, at the time<br>
of higher rotation rate, the working voltage of the transistor is<br>
transferred to the larger negative voltage side. Therefore, as to<br>
switching on time of the transistor, as the rate becomes higher,<br><br>
the more dwell angle increases and the longer switching on time<br>
becomes. In this way, the dwell angle control is performed by<br>
utilizing the generation voltage of the pickup coil itself of a<br>
signal generator increasing with a rise of rotation rate and by<br>
lowering the operating point of the transistor with an increase of<br>
the generation voltage and the lowering of the generated second<br>
voltage of the ignition coil at the time of higher rotation rate is<br>
prevented.<br>

of the present invention.<br>
First, according to Fig. 1, one example of a configuration of<br>
a full-transistor ignition apparatus in the present embodiment of<br>
the present invention will be described below. A full-transistor<br>
ignition apparatus of the present embodiment is, for example,<br>
employed for an engine for a two-wheeled vehicle, comprises an AC3<br>
coil 1, a pulser coil 2, a control circuit 3, an ignition coil 4, a<br>
spark plug 5 and the like and is configured so that a wave<br>
signal outputted from the ACG coil 1 and the pulser<br><br>

generated in the control circuit 3 is supplied to the primary<br>
coil of the ignition coil 4 and the secondary voltage generated<br>
in the second coil at the time of interruption of the primary<br>
current is discharged at the spark plug 5.<br>
The control circuit 3 comprises a regulator/rectifier 11,<br>
an electric source section for the primary coil 12, an electric<br>
source section for control circuit 13, a control section 14,<br>

an ignition timing range control section 21, an advance angle<br>
control circuit 22 , a primary current control section of a primary<br>
coil 23 and the like are provided.<br>
The regulator/rectifier 11 is connected to an input<br>
terminal of the ACG coil 1. An ACG signal is outputted from<br>
the ACG coil 1 and the current is rectified by the ACG signal<br>
as an input. The rectified voltage is outputted to the electric<br>
source section for the primary coil 12 and to the electric source<br>
section for the control circuit 13.<br>
The electric source section for the primary coil 12 is<br>
connected to an output of the regulator/rectifier 11. The<br>
voltage outputted from the regulator/rectifier 11 is made as<br>
an input and, based on this voltage, a voltage for supplying<br>
to the primary coil of the ignition coil 4 is generated. The<br>
generated voltage is outputted to the output terminal to which<br>
the primary coil of the ignition coil 4 is connected.<br>
The electric source section for the control circuit 13<br>
is connected to an output of the regulator/rectifier 11, in<br><br>
parallel with the electric source for the primary coil 12. A<br>
voltage outputted from the regulator/rectifier 11 is made as<br>
an input and, based on this voltage, a voltage for operating<br>
the control section 14 is generated. The generated voltage is<br>
outputted to a connection terminal of the control section 14.<br>
In the control section 14, the ignition timing range<br>
control section 21 is connected to an input terminal of the pulser<br>
coil 2 via a connection terminal of the control section 14. A<br>
pulser signal outputted from the pulser coil 2 is made as an<br>
input and, based on the pulser signal, an ignition timing range<br>
signal is generated. The generated ignition timing range signal<br>
is outputted to the advance angle control circuit 22 and the<br>
primary current control section of the primary coil 23.<br>
The advance angle control circuit 22 is connected to an<br>
output of the ignition timing range control section 21 as well<br>
as connected to an input terminal of the pulser coil 2 via a<br>
connection terminal of the control section 14 that is parallel<br>
with the ignition timing control section 21. A pulser signal<br>
outputted from the pulser coil 2 and an ignition timing range<br>
signal outputted from the ignition timing range control section<br>
21 are made as inputs, and an ignition advance control signal<br>
is generated based on these pulser signal and ignition timing<br>
range signal. The ignition control signal is outputted to the<br>
primary current control section of the primary coil 23.<br>
The primary control section of the primary coil 23 is<br>
connected to outputs of the ignition timing range control section<br>
21 and the advance angle control circuit 22, respectively, as<br><br>
well as connected to an input terminal of the pulser coil 2 via<br>
a connection terminal of the control section 14 which is parallel<br>
with the ignition timing range control section 21 and the advance<br>
angle control circuit 22. A pulser signal outputted from the<br>
pulser coil 2, an ignition timing range signal outputted from<br>
the ignition timing range control section 21 and an ignition<br>
advance control signal outputted from the advance angle control<br>
circuit 22 are made as inputs and, based on these pulser signal,<br>
ignition timing range signal and ignition advance control signal,<br>
a primary current control signal of the primary coil is generated,<br>
so that the primary current control signal of the primary coil<br>
is outputted to the base of the power transistor 15 via a connection<br>
terminal of the control section 14.<br>
As to the power transistor 15, its base is connected to<br>
a connection terminal of the control section 14 that is connected<br>
to an output of the primary current control section of the primary<br>
coil 23, its collector is connected to an output terminal to<br>
the ignition coil 4 , and its emitter is connected to the grounded<br>
voltage, respectively. The power transistor 15 is controlled<br>
by a primary current control signal of the primary coil outputted<br>
from the primary current control section of the primary coil<br>
23. When the voltage level of a primary current control signal<br>
of the primary coil is high, the power transistor 15 is switched<br>
on, collector current flows, so that the primary current flows<br>
to the primary coil of the ignition coil 4. On the contrary,<br>
when the voltage level of a primary current control signal of<br>
the primary coil is low, the power transistor 15 is switched<br><br>
off.<br>
Next, according to Fig. 2, one example of a configuration<br>
of the primary current control section of the primary coil 21<br>
configuring a full-transistor ignition apparatus of the present<br>
embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail<br>
below. The primary current control section of the primary coil<br>
23 of the present embodiment comprises a plurality of transistors<br>
TR1 to TR6 (TR1, TR3 and TR6 are NPN type transistors, TR2, TR4<br>
and TR5 are of PNP type transistors), a plurality of condensers<br>
C1 and C2, a plurality of resistors Rl to R20, a plurality of<br>
diodes Dl and D2, a comparator CP and the like. The primary<br>
current control section of the primary coil 23 is so configured<br>
that a pulser signal outputted from the pulser coil 2 , an ignitior<br>
timing range signal outputted from the ignition timing range<br>
control section 21, an ignition advance control signal outputtec<br>
from the advance angle control circuit 22 are inputted<br>
respectively, a primary current control signal of the primary<br>
coil is outputted from the power transistor 15, and the electric<br>
source is supplied from the electric source for the control<br>
circuit 13.<br>
The primary current control section of the primary coil<br>
23 has , particularly as two sets of CR circuits having respective<br>
different time constants and inverse charging and discharging<br>
timings, a first CR circuit 31 comprising the condenser C1 and<br>
the resistors R7 to R9 and a second CR circuit 32 comprising<br>
of the condenser C2 and the resistors R10 to R12. The primary<br>
current control section of the primary coil 23 further has a<br><br>
comparator CP as comparison control means for comparing the<br>
voltages of the condenser C1 and the condenser C2. When the<br>
voltage of the condenser C1 is higher than that of the condenser<br>
C2, the comparator CP switches the power transistor 15 on, which<br>
is in charge of switching of the ignition coil 4, and controls<br>
to energize the primary current to the primary coil.<br>
In the primary current control section of the primary coil<br>
23, a timing of switching on the comparator CP can be changed<br>
by utilizing the difference of frequency characteristics of the<br>
respective CR circuits. However, if only frequency<br>
characteristics is used, the optimum energizing time of the<br>
primary current cannot be obtained at the time of the lower<br>
rotation rate through at the time of the higher rotation rate.<br>
Then, further the optimum correction per each rotation is<br>
performed to one of the condensers, i.e., the condenser C1 by<br>
utilizing a pulser signal, and a correction circuit 33 comprising<br>
the transistor TR4 and the resistor R12 is provided as correction<br>
control means for optimally controlling an energizing time to<br>
energize the primary current to the primary coil of the ignition<br>
coil 4.<br>
An operation of the primary current control section of<br>
the primary coil 23 configured above will be described below<br>
on the basis of the timing diagram showing an operating waveform<br>
of Fig. 3. A pulser signal outputted from the pulser coil 2<br>
is inputted into a node A of the primary current control section<br>
of the primary coil 23 . The pulse signal is a pulse wave generated<br>
at the most advanced time when the range in which an ignition<br><br>
control is performed is the most advanced, and at the most delayed<br>
time when the range in which an ignition control is performed<br>
is the most delayed. A waveform in each single pulse wave shape<br>
is positive at the most advanced time and negative at the most<br>
delayed time.<br>
Charging and discharging are carried out in the first CR<br>
circuit 31 and the second CR circuit 32, respectively, on the<br>
basis of a pulser signal in each signal pulse shape, which is<br>
positive at the most advanced time and negative at the most delayed<br>
time. In one of the CR circuits, i.e., the first CR circuit<br>
31, like a voltage waveform of a node B, charging is initiated<br>
at the generation timing of negative pulse wave, and charging<br>
is continued until the positive pulse wave is generated. Then,<br>
charging is switched into the discharging by the generation<br>
timing of the positive pulse wave, and discharging is continued<br>
until the negative pulse wave is generated. At this moment,<br>
charging is determined by a time constant of the condenser C1<br>
and the resistances R8 and R9 for dividing voltages when the<br>
TR1 and TR2 of the transistors are switched on. Moreover,<br>
discharging is determined by a time constant of the condenser C1 and the resistant R7 when the transistor TR3 is switched on.<br>
In the other second CR circuit 32 , like a voltage waveform<br>
of a node C, charging is initiated at the generation timing of<br>
the positive pulse wave, and the charging is continued until<br>
the negative pulse wave is generated. Then, charging is changed<br>
to discharging at the generation timing of the negative pulse<br>
wave, and discharging is continued until the positive pulse wave<br><br>
is generated. At this moment, charging is determined by a time<br>
constant of the condenser C2 and the resistors R10 and Rll for<br>
dividing voltages when the TR1 and TR2 of the transistors are<br>
switched on. Moreover, discharging is determined by a time<br>
constant of the condenser C2 and the resistant R12 when the<br>
transistor TR4 is switched on.<br>
Since each signal of the node B and C that is changed as<br>
described above is inputted into the comparator CP, the<br>
comparator CP outputs a signal when the signal level of the node<br>
B exceeds over the signal level of the node C. While a signal<br>
is outputted from this comparator CP, the transistor TR5 is<br>
switched on, the signal at this moment becomes a control signal<br>
of the power transistor 15, then, the primary current flows<br>
through the primary coil of the ignition coil 4 when the power<br>
transistor 15 is switched on and on the contrary, the primary<br>
current does not flow when the power transistor 15 is switched<br>
off.<br>
At this moment, a waveform of the primary current which<br>
flows through the primary coil of the ignition coil 4 is a waveform<br>
as shown in Fig. 3. Specifically, per each cycle, the current<br>
increases from the timing when a signal B and a signal C are<br>
crossed, and it becomes certain level at the predetermined<br>
current. For this certain time, for example, only for a time<br>
on the order of 5 ms, the current flows through the primary coil<br>
of the ignition coil 4. After this certain time passes, the<br>
timing when the primary current is interrupted is an ignition<br>
timing. Moreover, a time from the time when the primary current<br><br>
is made low level until the time when the signal B and the signal<br>
C are crossed is an off time of the primary current.<br>
Moreover, since the timing when the signal B and the signal<br>
C are crossed can be obtained by comparing voltage waveforms<br>
of the first CR circuit 31 and the second CR circuit 32 each<br>
other, the timing is changed corresponding to the rotation rate<br>
of an engine . Specifically, at the time of higher rotation rate,<br>
as shown with alternate long and short dash lines in Fig. 3,<br>
the waveform of the node B is transferred to higher voltage<br>
direction, and the waveform of the node C is inversely transferred<br>
to lower voltage direction by the correction circuit 33, the<br>
timing when the signal B and the signal C are crossed is hastened<br>
and the ignition advance control is carried out. Specifically,<br>
as to the signal C, in the case where the correction circuit<br>
33 is absent, the signal C is transferred to higher voltage<br>
direction just like the signal B, but by providing the correction<br>
circuit 33 comprising transistor TR4 utilizing a pulser signal<br>
and the resistor R12, for a split second when the positive side<br>
on which a pulser is generated is generated, the transistor TR4<br>
is switched on and the resistor R12 is connected, discharging<br>
is carried out by changing the time constant and the waveform<br>
can be lowered by the rise of rotation rate. Owing to this,<br>
the timing of the current increasing of the waveform of the primary<br>
current at the time of higher rotation rate is hastened compared<br>
to that at the time of lower rotation rate (continuous line).<br>
It is energized at an earlier timing compared to at the time<br>
of lower rotation rate, and the primary current can be flown<br><br>
through the primary coil of the ignition coil 4 only for an<br>
approximately same time period on the order of 5 ms.<br>
In this way, the primary current has been previously<br>
energized through the primary coil of the ignition coil 4 only<br>
for the optimum time period corrected per each rotation at the<br>
lower rotation rate through at the higher rotation rate. When<br>
the energy of the primary coil of the ignition coil 4 is enhanced,<br>
the primary current energized through the primary coil of the<br>
ignition coil 4 is rapidly interrupted. A back electromotive<br>
force is induce in the primary coil of the ignition coil 4 and,<br>
at this moment, high voltage generated on the secondary coil<br>
of the ignition coil 4 is discharged at the spark plug 5, so<br>
that the mixture within an engine can be ignited.<br>
Therefore, according to a full-transistor ignition<br>
apparatus of the present embodiment of the present invention,<br>
an energizing time of the primary current can be optimally<br>
corrected per each rotation and the energizing time of the primary<br>
current can be optimally controlled by providing the primary<br>
current control section of the primary coil 23 including the<br>
first CR circuit 31 and second CR circuit 32; the comparator<br>
CP for comparing voltages of the respective condenser C1 and<br>
condenser C2; and the correction circuit 33 connected to one<br>
of the condensers, i.e., the condenser C1. Therefore, it is<br>
capable of obtaining a necessary and minimum energizing time<br>
of the primary current at the lower rotation rate through at<br>
the higher rotation rate.<br>
It goes without saying that the present invention is not<br><br>
limited to the embodiment aforementioned and various<br>
modifications may be made without departing from the scope of<br>
its intention of the invention.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>

of said second CR circuit and controlling so as to energize the<br>
current through the primary coil by switching on a transistor<br>
for switching an ignition coil when voltage of a condenser of<br>
said first CR circuit is higher than voltage of a condenser of<br>
said second CR circuit; and<br>
correction and control means, being connected to the<br>
condenser of said second CR circuit, for optimally correct per<br>
each rotation by utilizing a pulser signal and for optimally<br>
controlling an energizing time for energizing the current through<br>
the primary coil of said ignition coil.<br><br>
2. A full-transistor ignition apparatus, substantially as herein<br>
described, particularly with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br><br>
A full-transistor ignition apparatus is provided, by which<br>
an energizing time of the primary current of an ignition coil<br>
can be optimally controlled per each rotation and a necessary<br>
and minimum energizing time of the primary current can be obtained<br>
at the time of the lower rotation rate through at the time of<br>
the higher rotation rate. The apparatus has a primary current<br>
control section of the primary coil 23 comprising first and second<br>
CR circuits 31 and 32 having different time constants and having<br>
inverse charging and discharging timings; a comparator CP for<br>
comparing voltages of respective condensers C1 and C2; and a<br>
correction circuit 33 connected to one of the condensers C1.<br>
At the time of a higher rotation rate, a signal waveform of the<br>
first CR circuit 31 is transferred to the higher voltage direction,<br>
and a signal waveform of the second CR circuit 32 is inversely<br>
transferred to the lower voltage direction from the correction<br>
circuit 33 , so that a timing of crossing is hastened. The current<br>
is energized at an early timing at the time of a higher rotation<br>
rate compared to at the time of a lower rotation rate, and the<br>
primary current flows through the primary coil of an ignition<br>
coil only for an approximately same time period.</td>
